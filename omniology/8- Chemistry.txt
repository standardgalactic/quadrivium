Nivaldo Tro is a professor of chemistry at 
Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California, 
where he has been a faculty member since 1990. 
He received his Ph.D. in chemistry from Stanford 
University for work on developing and using 
optical techniques to study the adsorption and 
desorption of molecules to and from ­surfaces 
in ultrahigh vacuum. He then went on to the 
University of California at Berkeley, where he 
did postdoctoral research on ultrafast reaction 
dynamics in solution. Since coming to West-
mont, Professor Tro has been awarded grants 
from the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund, from Research 
Corporation, and from the National Science Foundation to study the dynamics of 
various ­processes occurring in thin adlayer films adsorbed on dielectric surfaces. He 
has been honored as Westmont’s outstanding teacher of the year three times and 
has also received the college’s outstanding researcher of the year award. Professor 
Tro lives in Santa Barbara with his wife, Ann, and their four children, Michael, Ali, 
Kyle, and Kaden.

Preface
real progress and opens the door to what could be misin-
formed policies. For example, I have heard conservative pun-
dits say that volcanoes emit more carbon dioxide—the most 
significant greenhouse gas—than does petroleum combus-
tion. I have also heard a liberal environmentalist say that we 
have to stop using hairspray because it is causing holes in the 
ozone layer that will lead to global warming. Well, the claim 
about volcanoes emitting more carbon dioxide than petro-
leum combustion can be refuted by the basic tools you will 
learn to use in Chapter 4 of this book. We can easily show that 
volcanoes emit only 1/50th as much carbon dioxide as petro-
leum combustion. As for hairspray depleting the ozone layer 
and thereby leading to global warming, the chlorofluorocar-
bons that deplete ozone have been banned from hairspray 
since 1978, and ozone depletion has nothing to do with global 
warming anyway. People with special interests or axes to grind 
can conveniently distort the truth before an ill-informed pub-
lic, which is why we all need to be knowledgeable.
So this is why I think you should take this course. Not 
just to satisfy the requirement for your major, and not just 
to get a good job some day, but to help you to lead a fuller 
life and to make the world a little better for everyone. I wish 
you the best as you embark on the journey to understand 
the world around you at the molecular level. The rewards 
are well worth the effort.
To the Professor
First and foremost, thanks to all of you who adopted this 
book in its previous editions. You helped to make this book 
one of the most popular general chemistry textbooks in the 
world. I am grateful beyond words. Second, I have listened 
carefully to your feedback on the previous edition. The 
changes you see in this edition are the direct result of your 
input, as well as my own experience using the book in my 
general chemistry courses. If you have reviewed content or 
have contacted me directly, you will likely see your sugges-
tions reflected in the changes I have made. Thank you.
Some of the most exciting changes in this edition are in 
the media associated with the book. I have added approxi-
mately 57 new Key Concept Videos and 61 new Interactive 
Worked examples to the media package. You can see a more de-
tailed description of these videos in the following section enti-
tled What’s New in This Edition. This means that you now have 
a library of over 150 interactive videos to enhance your course. 
In my courses, I use these videos to implement a before, during, 
after strategy for my students. My goal is simple: Engage students 
in active learning before class, during class, and after class. To that 
end, I assign a key concept video before each class session.  
To the Student
As you begin this course, I invite you to think about your 
­reasons for enrolling in it. Why are you taking general 
­chemistry? More generally, why are you pursuing a college 
education? If you are like most college students taking general 
chemistry, part of your answer is probably that this course is 
required for your major and that you are pursuing a college 
education so you can get a good job some day. Although these 
are good reasons, I would like to suggest a better one. I think 
the primary reason for your education is to prepare you to live 
a good life. You should understand chemistry—not for what it 
can get you—but for what it can do to you. Understanding 
chemistry, I believe, is an important source of happiness and 
fulfillment. Let me explain.
Understanding chemistry helps you to live life to its full-
est for two basic reasons. The first is intrinsic: through an un-
derstanding of chemistry, you gain a powerful appreciation 
for just how rich and extraordinary the world really is. The 
second reason is extrinsic: understanding chemistry makes 
you a more informed citizen—it allows you to engage with 
many of the issues of our day. In other words, understanding 
chemistry makes you a deeper and richer person and makes 
your country and the world a better place to live. These rea-
sons have been the foundation of education from the very 
beginnings of civilization.
How does chemistry help prepare you for a rich life and 
conscientious citizenship? Let me explain with two exam-
ples. My first one comes from the very first page of Chapter 1 
of this book. There, I ask the following question: What is the 
most important idea in all of scientific knowledge? My an-
swer to that question is this: the behavior of matter is de-
termined by the properties of molecules and atoms. 
That simple statement is the reason I love chemistry. We hu-
mans have been able to study the substances that compose 
the world around us and explain their behavior by reference 
to particles so small that they can hardly be imagined. If you 
have never realized the remarkable sensitivity of the world we 
can see to the world we cannot, you have missed out on a fun-
damental truth about our universe. To have never encoun-
tered this truth is like never having read a play by Shakespeare 
or seen a sculpture by Michelangelo—or, for that matter, like 
never having discovered that the world is round. It robs you 
of an amazing and unforgettable experience of the world and 
the human ability to understand it.
My second example demonstrates how science literacy 
helps you to be a better citizen. Although I am largely sympa-
thetic to the environmental movement, a lack of science lit-
eracy within some sectors of that movement and the resulting 
anti-environmental backlash create confusion that impedes 

	
Preface	
xxiii
In the two-column format, the left column shows the stu-
dent how to analyze the problem and devise a solution strat-
egy. It also lists the steps of the solution, explaining the 
rationale for each one, while the right column shows the 
implementation of each step. In the three-column format, 
the left column outlines the general procedure for solving 
an important category of problems that is then applied to 
two side-by-side examples. This strategy allows students to 
see both the general pattern and the slightly different ways 
in which the procedure may be applied in differing contexts. 
The aim is to help students understand both the concept of 
the problem (through the formulation of an explicit concep-
tual plan for each problem) and the solution to the problem.
Third, Chemistry: A Molecular Approach is a visual book. 
Wherever possible, I use images to deepen the student’s in-
sight into chemistry. In developing chemical principles, mul-
tipart images help show the connection between everyday 
processes visible to the unaided eye and what atoms and mol-
ecules are actually doing. Many of these images have three 
parts: macroscopic, molecular, and symbolic. This combina-
tion helps students to see the relationships between the for-
mulas they write down on paper (symbolic), the world they 
see around them (macroscopic), and the atoms and molecules 
that compose that world (molecular). In addition, most fig-
ures are designed to teach rather than just to illustrate. They 
are rich with annotations and labels intended to help the stu-
dent grasp the most important processes and the principles 
that underlie them. The resulting images are rich with infor-
mation but also uncommonly clear and quickly understood.
Fourth, Chemistry: A Molecular Approach is a “big picture” 
book. At the beginning of each chapter, a short paragraph 
helps students to see the key relationships between the dif-
ferent topics they are learning. Through a focused and con-
cise narrative, I strive to make the basic ideas of every chapter 
clear to the student. Interim summaries are provided at se-
lected spots in the narrative, making it easier to grasp (and 
review) the main points of important discussions. And 
to make sure that students never lose sight of the forest for 
the  trees, each chapter includes several Conceptual Connec-
tions,  which ask them to think about concepts and solve 
problems without doing any math. I want students to learn 
the concepts, not just plug numbers into equations to churn 
out the right answer. This philosophy is also integral to the 
Key Concept Videos, which concisely reinforce student appre-
ciation of the core concepts in each chapter.
Chemistry: A Molecular Approach is lastly a book that de-
livers the depth of coverage faculty want. We do not have to 
cut corners and water down the material in order to get our 
students interested. We have to meet them where they are, 
challenge them to the highest level of achievement, and sup-
port them with enough pedagogy to allow them to succeed.
I hope that this book supports you in your vocation of 
teaching students chemistry. I am increasingly convinced of 
the importance of our task. Please feel free to email me with 
any questions or comments about the book.

The video introduces students to a key concept for that day and 
gets them thinking about it before they come to class. During 
class, I expand on the concept and use Leaning Catalytics to 
question my students. Instead of passively listening to a lec-
ture, they are interacting with the concepts through questions 
that I pose. Some of these questions are answered individually; 
other times I have them pair up with a partner. This approach 
has changed my classroom. Students engage in the material in 
new ways. They have to think and process and interact. It is 
deeply satisfying for me to see my students so engaged. Finally, 
after class, I give them another assignment, often an interactive 
worked example with a follow-up question. At this point, they 
have to apply what they have learned to solve a problem.
The results have been fantastic. My students are enjoying 
the process because they are engaged before, during, and after 
class rather than only looking at material the night before a 
problem set is due. I have seen evidence of their improved 
learning through increases in their scores on the American 
Chemical Society Standard General Chemistry Exam, which I 
always administer as the final exam for my course.
Although we have added exciting new media elements 
and made other changes to the book, the book’s goal re-
mains the same: to present a rigorous and accessible treatment 
of general chemistry in the context of relevance. Teaching gen-
eral chemistry would be much easier if all of our students 
had exactly the same level of preparation and ability. But 
alas, that is not the case. Even though I teach at a relatively 
selective institution, my courses are populated with stu-
dents with a range of backgrounds and abilities in chemis-
try. The challenge of successful teaching, in my opinion, is 
figuring out how to instruct and challenge the best students 
while not losing those with lesser backgrounds and abili-
ties. My strategy has always been to set the bar relatively 
high, while at the same time providing the motivation and 
support necessary to reach the high bar. That is exactly the 
philosophy of this book. We do not have to compromise 
away rigor in order to make chemistry accessible to our stu-
dents. In this book, I have worked hard to combine rigor 
with accessibility—to create a book that does not dilute the 
content, yet can be used and understood by any student 
willing to put in the necessary effort.
Chemistry: A Molecular Approach is first and foremost a 
student-oriented book. My main goal is to motivate students 
and get them to achieve at the highest possible level. As we all 
know, many students take general chemistry because it is a 
requirement; they do not see the connection between chem-
istry and their lives or their intended careers. Chemistry: A 
Molecular Approach strives to make those connections consis-
tently and effectively. Unlike other books, which often teach 
chemistry as something that happens only in the laboratory 
or in industry, this book teaches chemistry in the context of 
relevance. It shows students why chemistry is important to 
them, to their future careers, and to their world.
Second, Chemistry: A Molecular Approach is a pedagogi-
cally driven book. In seeking to develop problem-solving 
skills, a consistent approach (Sort, Strategize, Solve, and 
Check) is applied, usually in a two- or three-column format.

Acknowledgments
The book you hold in your hands bears my name on the 
cover, but I am really only one member of a large team that 
carefully crafted this book. Most importantly, I thank my edi-
tor, Terry Haugen. Terry is a great editor and friend. He gives 
me the right balance of freedom and direction and always 
supports me in my endeavors. Thanks, Terry, for all you have 
done for me and for general chemistry courses throughout 
the world. I am also grateful to Jennifer Hart, who has now 
worked with me on multiple editions of several books and in 
several different roles, including her role overseeing develop-
ment. Jennifer, your guidance, organizational skills, and wis-
dom are central to the success of my projects, and I am 
eternally grateful. I also thank my development editor Erin 
What’s New in This Edition?
The book has been extensively revised and contains more 
small changes than can be detailed here. The most significant 
changes to the book and its supplements are listed below:
• NEW! Chapter 12: Solids and Modern Materials. This 
chapter contains new topics and consolidates content 
on materials that was found in other parts of the book 
in previous editions into one new chapter. All chapters 
beyond Chapter 12 have been renumbered.
• With the help of my colleagues, Thomas Greenbowe 
(University of Oregon), Kristin Ziebert (Oregon State Uni-
versity), and Michael Everest (Westmont College), I have 
added two new categories of end-of-chapter questions 
designed to help students build what we call “twenty-
first-century skills.” The first new category of questions is 
Data Interpretation and Analysis. These questions present 
real data in real-life situations and ask students to analyze 
that data. These in-depth exercises give students much 
needed practice in reading graphs, digesting tables, and 
making data-driven decisions. The second new category 
of questions is Questions for Group Work. Our group work 
questions give students the opportunity to work with 
their peers in small groups. The questions can be used in 
or out of the classroom, but the idea is to foster collabora-
tive learning and to encourage students to work together 
as a team to solve problems.
• I have added approximately 57 new Key Concept Videos 
and 61 new Interactive Worked Examples to the media 
package that accompanies the book. (Since the previ-
ous edition had 40 Interactive worked examples, there 
is now a total of 158 interactive videos.) These tools are 
designed to help professors engage their students in ac-
tive learning. Recent research has conclusively demon-
strated that students learn better when they are active in 
the learning process, as opposed to passively listening 
and simply taking in content. The Key Concept Videos 
are brief (two to five minutes), and each introduces a key 
concept from a chapter. The student does not just pas-
sively listen to the video; the video stops in the middle 
and poses a question to the student. The student must 
answer the question before the video continues. Each 
video also includes a follow-up question that is assign-
able in MasteringChemistryTM. The Interactive Worked 
Examples are similar in concept, but instead of explain-
ing a key concept, they walk the student through one 
of the in-chapter worked examples from the book. Like 
the Key Concept Videos, Interactive Worked Examples 
stop in the middle and force the student to interact 
by completing a step in the example. The examples 
also have a follow-up question that is assignable in 
­MasteringChemistryTM. The power of interactivity to 
make connections in problem solving is immense. I did 
not quite realize this power until we started creating the 
Interactive Worked Examples and I saw how I could use 
the animations to make connections that are just not 
possible on the static page.

Ann. Her patience and love for me are beyond description, and 
without her, this book would never have been written. I am also 
indebted to my children, Michael, Ali, Kyle, and Kaden, whose 
smiling faces and love of life always inspire me. I come from a 
large Cuban family whose closeness and support most people 
would envy. Thanks to my parents, Nivaldo and Sara; my sib-
lings, Sarita, Mary, and Jorge; my siblings-in-law, Jeff, Nachy, 
Karen, and John; and my nephews and nieces, Germain, 
Danny, Lisette, Sara, and Kenny. These are the people with 
whom I celebrate life.
I am especially grateful to Michael Tro, who put in many 
hours proofreading my manuscript, working problems and 
quiz questions, and organizing art codes and appendices. 
­Michael, you are an amazing kid—it is my privilege to have 
you work with me on this project.
I would like to thank all of the general chemistry stu-
dents who have been in my classes throughout my 25 years as 
a professor at Westmont College. You have taught me much 
about teaching that is now in this book.
Lastly, I am indebted to the many reviewers, listed on the 
following pages, whose ideas are embedded throughout this 
book. They have corrected me, inspired me, and sharpened 
my thinking on how best to teach this subject we call chemis-
try. I deeply appreciate their commitment to this project. I 
am particularly grateful to Thomas ­Greenbowe, Michael Ever-
est, Kristin Ziebart, Michael Burand, Jeff Bryan,and Ali Sezer 
who played particularly important roles in many of the new

Mulligan, who has worked with me on many projects over 
several editions. Erin is an outstanding thinker and word-
smith who also has a great eye for detail and helps me tremen-
dously on all aspects of my projects. Thank you, Erin. Thanks 
also to my media editor, Jackie Jakob. Jackie has been instru-
mental in helping me craft and develop the Key Concept Vid-
eos and Interactive Worked Examples that accompany this 
text. Her expertise, vision, and attention to detail are second 
to none. The quality and success of these videos are largely 
attributable to Jackie. Thanks, Jackie.
New to this edition is Sarah Shefveland. Although we 
have only worked together a short while, I am already indebted 
to her helpfulness. I am also grateful to Lindsey Pruett, who 
helped with organizing reviews, as well as numerous other 
tasks associated with keeping the team running smoothly. I 
am also grateful to Jeanne Zalesky, Editor-in-Chief for Physical 
Sciences. She has supported me and my projects and allowed 
me to succeed. I am also grateful to my team of marketing 
managers, Chris Barker and Elizabeth Ellsworth. Chris and I 
go way back, and I am excited to work with him in this new 
role. Elizabeth and I have only worked together for a short 
while, but I am already impressed by her energy and ideas for 
marketing this book. I continue to owe a special word of 
thanks to Glenn and Meg Turner of Burrston House, ideal col-
laborators whose contributions to the first edition of the book 
were extremely important and much appreciated. Quade and 
Emiko Paul, who make my ideas come alive with their art, 
have been with us from the beginning, and I owe a special 
debt of gratitude to them. I am also grateful to Derek Bacchus 
and Elise ­Landson for their ­creativity and hard work in craft-
ing the design of this text. ­Finally, I would like to thank Beth 
Sweeten and the rest of the Pearson production team. They 
are a first-class operation—this text has benefited immeasur-
ably from their talents and hard work. I also thank Francesca 
Monaco and her coworkers at CodeMantra. I am a picky au-
thor and Francesca is endlessly patient and a true professional. 
I am also greatly indebted to my copy editor, Betty Pessagno, 
for her dedication and ­professionalism, and to Eric Schrader 
for his exemplary photo research. And of course, I am contin-
ually grateful for Paul Corey, with whom I have now worked 
for over 15 years and 12 projects. Paul is a man of incredible 
energy and vision, and it is my great privilege to work with 
him. Paul told me many years ago (when he first signed me on 
to the Pearson team) to dream big, and then he provided the 
resources I needed to make those dreams come true. Thanks, 
Paul. I would also like to thank my first editor at Pearson, Kent 
Porter-Hamann. Kent and I spent many good years together 
writing books, and I continue to miss her presence in my work.
I acknowledge the help of my colleagues Allan Nishimura, 
Kristi Lazar, David Marten, Stephen Contakes, Michael Everest, 
and Carrie Hill who have supported me in my department 
while I worked on this book. I am also grateful to Gayle Beebe 
and Mark Sargent, the president and provost (respectively) of 
Westmont College, who have allowed me the time and space to 
work on my books. Thank you, Gayle and Mark, for allowing 
me to pursue my gifts and my vision. I am also grateful to those 
who have supported me personally. First on that list is my wife,

NEW! Data Interpretation and 
Analysis questions present real 
data in real life situations and  
ask students to analyze that data. 
These in-depth exercises give 
students practice reading graphs, 
digesting tables, and making  
data-driven decisions.
21st Century Skills
Tro’s approach to General Chemistry addresses 21st century skills, 
including the ability to analyze and interpret data and the capacity  
to work well in groups. Concepts are covered in a thorough and 
approachable manner, which ensures that every explanation is relevant 
and helps students see the real-world importance and applications of 
Chemistry.  Students can learn concepts and build skills through

▲ This image portrays the 
Disneyland ride, Adventure Thru 
Inner Space. The premise of the

an atom. The red and white

and hydrogen atoms bound 
together to form water molecules.
W
hat do you think is the most important idea in all of human knowledge? 
There are, of course, many possible answers to this question—some practical, 
some philosophical, and some scientific. If we limit ourselves only to scien-
tific answers, mine would be this: the properties of matter are determined by 
the properties of atoms and molecules. Atoms and molecules determine how 
matter behaves—if they were different, matter would be different. The properties of 
water molecules determine how water behaves, the properties of sugar molecules deter-
mine how sugar behaves, and the properties of the molecules that compose our bodies 
determine how our bodies behave. The understanding of matter at the molecular level 
gives us unprecedented control over that matter. For example, our understanding of 
the details of the molecules that compose living organisms has revolutionized biology 
over the last 50 years.

Atoms and Molecules
As I sat in the “omnimover” and listened to the narrator’s voice telling me that I was 
shrinking down to the size of an atom, I grew apprehensive but curious. Just min-
utes before, while waiting in line, I witnessed what appeared to be full-sized humans 
entering a microscope and emerging from the other end many times smaller. I was 
seven years old, and I was about to ride Adventure Thru Inner Space, a Disneyland ride 
Atoms and Molecules

Chapter 1  Matter, Measurement, and Problem Solving
(in Tomorrowland) that simulated the process of shrinking down to the size of an 
atom. The ride began with darkness and shaking, but then the shaking stopped and 
giant snowflakes appeared. The narrator explained that you were in the process of 
shrinking to an ever-smaller size (which explains why the snowflakes grew larger 
and larger). Soon, you entered the wall of the snowflake itself and began to see water 
molecules all around you. These also grew larger as you continued your journey into 
inner space and eventually ended up within the atom itself. Although this Disney-
land ride bordered on being corny, and although it has since been shut down, it was 
my favorite ride as a young child.
That ride sparked my interest in the world of atoms and molecules, an interest that 
has continued and grown to this day. I am a chemist because I am obsessed with the con-
nection between the “stuff” around us and the atoms and molecules that compose that 
stuff. More specifically, I love the idea that we humans have been able to figure out the 
connection between the properties of the stuff around us and the properties of atoms and 
molecules. Atoms are sub-microscopic particles that are the fundamental building 
blocks of ordinary matter. Free atoms are rare in nature; instead they bind together in 
specific geometrical arrangements to form molecules. A good example of a molecule is 
the water molecule, which I remember so well from the Disneyland ride.
A water molecule is composed of one oxygen atom bound to two hydrogen atoms in 
the shape shown at left. The exact properties of the water molecule—the atoms that 
compose it, the distances between those atoms, and the geometry of how the atoms are 
bound together—determine the properties of water. If the molecule were different, water 
would be different. For example, if water contained two oxygen atoms instead of just 
one, it would be a molecule like this:
Hydrogen peroxide molecule
Hydrogen
atoms
Oxygen
atoms
This molecule is hydrogen peroxide, which you may have encountered if you have 
ever bleached your hair. A hydrogen peroxide molecule is composed of two oxygen 
atoms and two hydrogen atoms. This seemingly small molecular difference results in a 
huge difference in the properties of water and hydrogen peroxide. Water is the familiar 
and stable liquid we all drink and bathe in. Hydrogen peroxide, in contrast, is an unsta-
ble liquid that, in its pure form, burns the skin on contact and is used in rocket fuel. 
When you pour water onto your hair, your hair simply becomes wet. However, if you put 
diluted hydrogen peroxide on your hair, a chemical reaction occurs that strips your hair 
of its color.
The details of how specific atoms bond to form a molecule—in a straight line, at a 
particular angle, in a ring, or in some other pattern—as well as the type of atoms in the 
molecule, determine everything about the substance that the molecule composes. If 
we want to understand the substances around us, we must understand the atoms and 
molecules that compose them—this is the central goal of chemistry. A good simple 
definition of chemistry is
Chemistry—the science that seeks to understand the behavior of 
matter by studying the behavior of atoms and molecules.
Throughout this book, we explore the connection between atoms and molecules and 
the matter they compose. We seek to understand how differences on the atomic or 
molecular level affect the properties on the macroscopic level. Before we move on, let’s 
examine one more example that demonstrates this principle. Consider the structures of 
graphite and diamond shown on the next page.

The hydrogen peroxide we use as 
an antiseptic or bleaching agent is 
considerably diluted.
The term atoms in this definition 
can be interpreted loosely to include 
atoms that have lost or gained 
electrons.

Graphite structure
Diamond structure
Graphite is the slippery black substance 
(often called pencil lead) that you have probably 
used in a mechanical pencil. Diamond is the 
brilliant gemstone found in jewelry. Graphite 
and diamond are both composed of exactly the 
same atoms—carbon atoms. The striking differ-
ences between the substances are a result of how 
those atoms are arranged. In graphite, the atoms 
are arranged in sheets. The atoms within each 
sheet are tightly bound to each other, but the 
sheets are not tightly bound to other sheets. 
Therefore the sheets can slide past each other, 
which is why the graphite in a pencil leaves a 
trail as you write. In diamond, by contrast, the 
carbon atoms are all bound together in a three-
dimensional structure where layers are strongly 
bound to other layers, resulting in the strong, 
nearly unbreakable substance. This example 
illustrates how even the same atoms can com-
Although some Greek philosophers, 
such as Aristotle, did use observation 
to attain knowledge, they did 
not emphasize experiment and 
measurement to the extent that 
modern science does.
	 1.2	
The Scientific Approach to Knowledge
Throughout history, humans have approached knowledge about the physical world in 
different ways. For example, the Greek philosopher Plato (427–347 b.c.e.) thought that 
the best way to learn about reality was not through the senses but through reason. He 
believed that the physical world was an imperfect representation of a perfect and tran-
scendent world (a world beyond space and time). For him, true knowledge came not 
through observing the real physical world, but through reasoning and thinking about 
the ideal one.
The scientific approach to knowledge, however, is exactly the opposite of Plato’s. 
Scientific knowledge is empirical—it is based on observation and experiment. Scientists 
observe and perform experiments on the physical world to learn about it. Some obser-
vations and experiments are qualitative (noting or describing how a process happens), 
but many are quantitative (measuring or quantifying something about the process). For 
example, Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794), a French chemist who studied combustion 
(burning), made careful measurements of the mass of objects before and after burning 
them in closed containers. He noticed that there was no change in the total mass of 
material within the container during combustion. In doing so, Lavoisier made an 
important observation about the physical world.
Observations often lead scientists to formulate a hypothesis, a tentative interpreta-
tion or explanation of the observations. For example, Lavoisier explained his observations 
on combustion by hypothesizing that when a substance burns, it combines with a com-
ponent of air. A good hypothesis is falsifiable, which means that it makes predictions that 
can be confirmed or refuted by further observations. Scientists test hypotheses by experi-
ments, highly controlled procedures designed to generate observations that confirm or 
refute a hypothesis. The results of an experiment may support a hypothesis or prove it 
wrong—in which case the scientist must modify or discard the hypothesis.
In some cases, a series of similar observations leads to the development of a scien-
tific law, a brief statement that summarizes past observations and predicts future ones. 
Lavoisier summarized his observations on combustion with the law of conservation 
of mass, which states, “In a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed.” 
This statement summarized his observations on chemical reactions and predicted the

Such is the atomic and molecular world—small differences in atoms and molecules can 
result in large differences in the substances that they compose.

Chapter 1  Matter, Measurement, and Problem Solving
outcome of future observations on reactions. Laws, like hypotheses, are also subject to 
experiments, which can support them or prove them wrong.
Scientific laws are not laws in the same sense as civil or governmental laws. Nature 
does not follow laws in the way that we obey the laws against speeding or running a stop 
sign. Rather, scientific laws describe how nature behaves—they are generalizations about 
what nature does. For that reason, some people find it more appropriate to refer to them 
as principles rather than laws.
One or more well-established hypotheses may form the basis for a scientific theory. 
A scientific theory is a model for the way nature is and tries to explain not merely what 
nature does but why. As such, well-established theories are the pinnacle of scientific 
knowledge, often predicting behavior far beyond the observations or laws from which 
they were developed. A good example of a theory is the atomic theory proposed by 
English chemist John Dalton (1766–1844). Dalton explained the law of conservation of 
mass, as well as other laws and observations of the time, by proposing that matter is com-
posed of small, indestructible particles called atoms. Since these particles are merely rear-
ranged in chemical changes (and not created or destroyed), the total amount of mass 
remains the same. Dalton’s theory is a model for the physical world—it gives us insight 
into how nature works and, therefore, explains our laws and observations.
Finally, the scientific approach returns to observation to test theories. For example, 
scientists can test the atomic theory by trying to isolate single atoms or by trying to 
image them (both of which, by the way, have already been accomplished). Theories are 
validated by experiments; however, theories can never be conclusively proven because 
some new observation or experiment always has the potential to reveal a flaw. Notice 
that the scientific approach to knowledge begins with observation and ends with obser-
vation. An experiment is in essence a highly controlled procedure for generating critical 
observations designed to test a theory or hypothesis. Each new set of observations has 
the potential to refine the original model. Figure 1.1▼ summarizes one way to map the 
scientific approach to knowledge. Scientific laws, hypotheses, and theories are all sub-
ject to continued experimentation. If a law, hypothesis, or theory is proved wrong by an 
experiment, it must be revised and tested with new experiments. Over time, the scien-
tific community eliminates or corrects poor theories and laws, and valid theories and 
laws—those consistent with experimental results—remain.
Established theories with strong experimental support are the most powerful 
pieces of scientific knowledge. You may have heard the phrase “That is just a theory,” as 
if theories are easily dismissible. Such a statement reveals a deep misunderstanding of 
the nature of a scientific theory. Well-established theories are as close to truth as we get 
in science. The idea that all matter is made of atoms is “just a theory,” but it has over 
200 years of experimental evidence to support it. It is a powerful piece of scientific 
knowledge on which many other scientific ideas are based.
One last word about the scientific approach to knowledge: some people wrongly 
imagine science to be a strict set of rules and procedures that automatically leads to 
inarguable, objective facts. This is not the case. Even our diagram of the scientific 
approach to knowledge is only an idealization of real science, useful to help us see the

atoms were indestructible. Today,

key distinctions of science. Real science requires hard work, care, creativity, and even 
a bit of luck. Scientific theories do not just arise out of data—men and women of 
genius and creativity craft theories. A great theory is not unlike a master painting, 
and many see a similar kind of beauty in both. (For more on this aspect of science, see 
the box below entitled Thomas S. Kuhn and Scientific Revolutions.)

The Classification of Matter
Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. Your desk, your chair, and even 
your body are all composed of matter. Less obviously, the air around you is also matter—it 
too occupies space and has mass. We call a specific instance of matter—such as air, water, 
or sand—a substance. We classify matter according to its state (its physical form) and 
its composition (the basic components that make it up).
The Nature OF Science 
Thomas S. Kuhn and Scientific Revolutions
W
hen scientists talk about science, they often talk in 
ways that imply that theories are “true.” Further, they 
talk as if they arrive at theories in logical and unbiased ways. 
For example, a theory central to chemistry that we have 
discussed in this chapter is John Dalton’s atomic theory—
the idea that all matter is composed of atoms. Is this theory 
“true”? Was it reached in logical, unbiased ways? Will this 
theory still be around in 200 years?
The answers to these questions depend on how we view 
science and its development. One way to view science—let’s 
call it the traditional view—is as the continual accumulation 
of knowledge and the building of increasingly precise 
theories. In this view, a scientific theory is a model of the 
world that reflects what is actually in nature. New 
observations and experiments result in gradual adjustments 
to theories. Over time, theories get better, giving us a more 
accurate picture of the physical world.
In the twentieth century, a different view of scientific 
knowledge began to develop. A book by Thomas Kuhn  
(1922–1996), published in 1962 and entitled The Structure 
of Scientific Revolutions, challenged the traditional view. 
Kuhn’s ideas came from his study of the history of science, 
which, he argued, does not support the idea that science 
progresses in a smooth cumulative way. According to Kuhn, 
science goes through fairly quiet periods that he called 
normal science. In these periods, scientists make their data 
fit the reigning theory, or paradigm. Small inconsistencies are 
swept aside during periods of normal science. However, when 
too many inconsistencies and anomalies develop, a crisis 
emerges. The crisis brings about a revolution and a new 
reigning theory. According to Kuhn, the new theory is usually 
quite different from the old one; it not only helps us to make 
sense of new or anomalous information, but it also enables 
us to see accumulated data from the past in a dramatically 
new way.
Kuhn further contended that theories are held for 
reasons that are not always logical or unbiased, and that 
theories are not true models—in the sense of a one-to-one 
mapping—of the physical world. Because new theories are 
often so different from the ones they replace, he argued, and 
because old theories always make good sense to those 
holding them, they must not be “True” with a capital T; 
otherwise “truth” would be constantly changing.
Kuhn’s ideas created a controversy among scientists and 
science historians that continues to this day. Some, especially 
postmodern philosophers of science, have taken Kuhn’s ideas 
one step further. They argue that scientific knowledge is 
completely biased and lacks any objectivity. Most scientists, 
including Kuhn, would disagree. Although Kuhn pointed out 
that scientific knowledge has arbitrary elements, he also said, 
“Observation . . . can and must drastically restrict the range of 
admissible scientific belief, else there would be no science.” In 
other words, saying that science contains arbitrary elements is 
quite different from saying that science itself is arbitrary.
Q u e s t i o n
In his book, Kuhn stated, “A new theory . . . is seldom or 
never just an increment to what is already known.” From your 
knowledge of the history of science, can you think of any 
examples that support Kuhn’s statement? Do you know of any 
instances in which a new theory or model was drastically 
different from the one it replaced?

Crystalline Solid:
Regular

Glass and other amorphous solids 
can be thought of, from one point of 
view, as intermediate between solids 
and liquids. Their atoms are fixed in 
position at room temperature, but 
they have no long-range structure and 
do not have distinct melting points.
Solid matter
Gaseous matter
Liquid matter
▲ In a solid, the atoms or molecules are fixed in place and can only vibrate. In a liquid, 
although the atoms or molecules are closely packed, they can move past one another, allowing 
the liquid to flow and assume the shape of its container. In a gas, the atoms or molecules are 
widely spaced, making gases compressible as well as fluid (able to flow).
The state of matter changes from 
solid to liquid to gas with increasing 
temperature.
The States of Matter: Solid, Liquid, and Gas
Matter exists in three different states: solid, liquid, and gas. In solid matter, atoms 
or molecules pack closely to each other in fixed locations. Although the atoms and 
molecules in a solid vibrate, they do not move around or past each other. Conse-
quently, a solid has a fixed volume and rigid shape. Ice, aluminum, and diamond 
are examples of solids. Solid matter may be crystalline, in which case its atoms or 
molecules are in patterns with long-range, repeating order (Figure 1.2◀), or it may be 
amorphous, in which case its atoms or molecules do not have any long-range order. 
Table salt and diamond are examples of crystalline solids; the well-ordered geometric 
shapes of salt and diamond crystals reflect the well-ordered geometric arrangement 
of their atoms (although this is not the case for all crystalline solids). Examples of 
amorphous solids include glass and plastic. In liquid matter, atoms or molecules pack 
about as closely as they do in solid matter, but they are free to move relative to each 
other, giving liquids a fixed volume but not a fixed shape. Liquids assume the shape 
of their containers. Water, alcohol, and gasoline are all substances that are liquids at 
room temperature.
▲ Figure 1.2  Crystalline 
Solid  Diamond (first discussed 
in Section 1.1) is a crystalline 
solid composed of carbon atoms 
arranged in a regular, repeating 
pattern.
In gaseous matter, atoms or molecules have a lot of space between them and are free 
to move relative to one another, making gases compressible (Figure 1.3▶). When you 
squeeze a balloon or sit down on an air mattress, you force the atoms and molecules into 
a smaller space so that they are closer together. Gases always assume the shape and vol-
ume of their containers. Substances that are gases at room temperature include helium, 
nitrogen (the main component of air), and carbon dioxide.

Chapter 1  Matter, Measurement, and Problem Solving
The first division in the classification of matter is between a pure substance and a mixture. 
A pure substance is made up of only one component, and its composition is invariant (it 
does not vary from one sample to another). The components of a pure substance can be indi-
vidual atoms or groups of atoms joined together. For example, helium, water, and table salt 
(sodium chloride) are all pure substances. Each of these substances is made up of only one 
component: helium is made up of helium atoms, water is made up of water molecules, and 
sodium chloride is made up of sodium chloride units. The composition of a pure sample of 
any one of these substances is always exactly the same (because you can’t vary the composi-
tion of a substance made up of only one component).
A mixture, by contrast, is composed of two or more components in proportions 
that can vary from one sample to another. For example, sweetened tea, composed pri-
marily of water molecules and sugar molecules (with a few other substances mixed in), is 
a mixture. We can make tea slightly sweet (a small proportion of sugar to water) or very 
sweet (a large proportion of sugar to water) or any level of sweetness in between.
We categorize pure substances themselves into two types—elements and compounds—
depending on whether or not they can be broken down (or decomposed) into simpler 
substances. Helium, which we just noted is a pure substance, is also a good example of an 
element, a substance that cannot be chemically broken down into simpler substances. 
Water, also a pure substance, is a good example of a compound, a substance composed 
of two or more elements (in this case hydrogen and oxygen) in a fixed, definite propor-
tion. On Earth, compounds are more common than pure elements because most ele-
ments combine with other elements to form compounds.
We also categorize mixtures into two types—heterogeneous and homogeneous—
depending on how uniformly the substances within them mix. Wet sand is a 
­heterogeneous mixture, one in which the composition varies from one region of 
the mixture to another. Sweetened tea is a homogeneous mixture, one with the 
same composition throughout. Homogeneous mixtures have uniform compositions 
because the atoms or molecules that compose them mix uniformly. Heterogeneous 
mixtures are made up of distinct regions because the atoms or molecules that compose 
them separate. Here again we see that the properties of matter are determined by the 
atoms or molecules that compose it.
Classifying a substance according to its composition is not always obvious and 
requires that we either know the true composition of the substance or are able to test it 
in a laboratory. For now, we focus on relatively common substances that you are likely to 
have encountered. Throughout this course, you will gain the knowledge to understand 
the composition of a larger variety of substances.
All known elements are listed in the 
periodic table in the inside front cover 
of this book.

Pure Substances and Mixtures  Let a small circle represent an atom of one 
type of element and a small square represent an atom of a second type of element. Make 
a drawing of (a) a pure substance (a compound) composed of the two elements (in a 
one-to-one ratio), (b) a homogeneous mixture composed of the two elements, and (c) a 
heterogeneous mixture composed of the two elements.
Separating Mixtures
Chemists often want to separate a mixture into its components. Such separations can be 
easy or difficult, depending on the components in the mixture. In general, mixtures are 
separable because the different components have different physical or chemical proper-
ties. We can use various techniques that exploit these differences to achieve separation. 
For example, we can separate a mixture of sand and water by decanting—carefully 
pouring off—the water into another container. A homogeneous mixture of liquids can 
usually be separated by distillation, a process in which the mixture is heated to boil 
off the more volatile (easily vaporizable) liquid. The volatile liquid is then recondensed 
in a condenser and collected in a separate flask (Figure 1.4▶). If a mixture is composed 
of an insoluble solid and a liquid, we can separate the two by filtration, in which the 
mixture is poured through filter paper in a funnel (Figure 1.5▶).

Physical and Chemical Changes and 
Physical and Chemical Properties
Every day we witness changes in matter: ice melts, iron rusts, gasoline burns, fruit ripens, 
and water evaporates. What happens to the molecules or atoms that compose these sub-
stances during such changes? The answer depends on the type of change. Changes that 
alter only state or appearance, but not com-
position, are physical changes. The atoms 
or molecules that compose a substance do not 
change their identity during a physical change. 
For example, when water boils, it changes its 
state from a liquid to a gas, but the gas remains 
composed of water molecules, so this is a physi-
cal change (Figure 1.6▶).
H2O(l)
Water molecules change from liquid
to gaseous state: physical change.
H2O(g)
▶ Figure 1.6  Boiling, a Physical 
Change  When water boils, it turns into a gas but 
does not alter its chemical identity—the water 
molecules are the same in both the liquid and 
gaseous states. Boiling is a physical change, and 
the boiling point of water is a physical property.

Chapter 1  Matter, Measurement, and Problem Solving
In contrast, changes that alter the composition of matter are chemical changes. 
During a chemical change, atoms rearrange, transforming the original substances into 
different substances. For example, the rusting of iron is a chemical change. The atoms 
that compose iron (iron atoms) combine with oxygen molecules from air to form iron 
oxide, the orange substance we call rust (Figure 1.7◀). Figure 1.8▶ illustrates other 
examples of physical and chemical changes.
Physical and chemical changes are manifestations of physical and chemical proper-
ties. A physical property is a property that a substance displays without changing its 
composition, whereas a chemical property is a property that a substance displays 
only by changing its composition via a chemical change. The smell of gasoline is a phys-
ical property—gasoline does not change its composition when it exhibits its odor. The 
flammability of gasoline, in contrast, is a chemical property—gasoline does change its 
composition when it burns, turning into completely new substances (primarily carbon 
dioxide and water). Physical properties include odor, taste, color, appearance, melting 
point, boiling point, and density. Chemical properties include corrosiveness, flamma-
bility, acidity, toxicity, and other such characteristics.
The differences between physical and chemical changes are not always apparent. 
Only chemical examination can confirm whether a particular change is physical or 
chemical. In many cases, however, we can identify chemical and physical changes based 
on what we know about the changes. Changes in the state of matter, such as melting or 
boiling, or changes in the physical condition of matter, such as those that result from cut-
ting or crushing, are typically physical changes. Changes involving chemical reactions—
often evidenced by temperature or color changes—are chemical changes.
A physical change results in a 
different form of the same substance, 
while a chemical change results in a 
completely different substance.
In Chapter 19 we will discuss nuclear 
changes, which can involve atoms of 
one element changing into atoms of a 
different element.

Physical and Chemical Changes and Properties
Determine whether each change is physical or chemical. What kind of property 
(chemical or physical) is demonstrated in each case?
(a)	 the evaporation of rubbing alcohol
(b)	 the burning of lamp oil
(c)	 the bleaching of hair with hydrogen peroxide
(d)	 the formation of frost on a cold night
Solution
(a)	 When rubbing alcohol evaporates, it changes from liquid to gas, but it 
remains alcohol—this is a physical change. The volatility (the ability to 
evaporate easily) of alcohol is therefore a physical property.
(b)	 Lamp oil burns because it reacts with oxygen in air to form carbon dioxide 
and water—this is a chemical change. The flammability of lamp oil is 
therefore a chemical property.
(c)	 Applying hydrogen peroxide to hair changes pigment molecules in hair that 
give it color—this is a chemical change. The susceptibility of hair to 
bleaching is therefore a chemical property.
(d)	 Frost forms on a cold night because water vapor in air changes its state to 
form solid ice—this is a physical change. The temperature at which water 
freezes is therefore a physical property.

Energy: A Fundamental Part of Physical 
and Chemical Change
The physical and chemical changes discussed in Section 1.4 are usually accompanied by 
energy changes. For example, when water evaporates from your skin (a physical change), 
the water molecules absorb energy from your body, making you feel cooler. When you 
burn natural gas on the stove (a chemical change), energy is released, heating the food 
you are cooking. Understanding the physical and chemical changes of matter—that is, 
understanding chemistry—requires that you understand energy changes and energy flow.
The scientific definition of energy is the capacity to do work. Work is defined as the 
action of a force through a distance. For instance, when you push a box across the floor 
or pedal your bicycle across the street, you have done work.

▲ Figure 1.9  Energy 
Conversions  Gravitational potential 
energy is converted into kinetic 
energy when the weight is dropped. 
The kinetic energy is converted 
mostly to thermal energy when the 
weight strikes the ground.
In Chapter 20 we will discuss how 
energy conservation is actually part of 
a more general law that allows for the 
interconvertibility of mass and energy.
Force acts through distance; work is done.
The total energy of an object is a sum of its kinetic energy (the energy associated 
with its motion) and its potential energy (the energy associated with its position or 
composition). For example, a weight held several meters above the ground has potential 
energy due to its position within Earth’s gravitational field (Figure 1.9◀). If you drop the 
weight, it accelerates, and its potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. When the 
weight hits the ground, its kinetic energy is converted primarily to thermal energy, 
the energy associated with the temperature of an object. Thermal energy is actually a 
type of kinetic energy because it is associated with the motion of the individual atoms or 
molecules that make up an object. When the weight hits the ground, its kinetic energy is 
essentially transferred to the atoms and molecules that compose the ground, raising the 
temperature of the ground ever so slightly.
The first principle to note about how energy changes as the weight falls to the 
ground is that energy is neither created nor destroyed. The potential energy of the weight 
becomes kinetic energy as the weight accelerates toward the ground. The kinetic energy 
then becomes thermal energy when the weight hits the ground. The total amount of 
thermal energy that is released through the process is exactly equal to the initial poten-
tial energy of the weight. The idea that energy is neither created nor destroyed is known 
as the law of conservation of energy. Although energy can change from one type 
into another, and although it can flow from one object to another, the total quantity of 
energy does not change—it remains constant.

1.6  The Units of Measurement

The second principle to note about the 
raised weight and its fall is the tendency of sys-
tems with high potential energy to change in a 
way that lowers their potential energy. For this 
reason, objects or systems with high potential 
energy tend to be unstable. The weight lifted 
several meters from the ground is unstable 
because it contains a significant amount of 
potential energy. Unless restrained, the 
weight will naturally fall, lowering its poten-
tial energy (due to its position in Earth’s grav-
itational field). We can harness some of the 
raised weight’s potential energy to do work. For example, we can attach the weight to a 
rope that turns a paddle wheel or spins a drill as the weight falls. After the weight falls to 
the ground, it contains less potential energy—it has become more stable.
Some chemical substances are like the raised weight just described. For example, the 
molecules that compose gasoline have a relatively high potential energy—energy is con-
centrated in them just as energy is concentrated in the raised weight. The molecules in 
the gasoline tend to undergo chemical changes (specifically combustion) that lower the 
molecules’ potential energy. As the energy of the molecules is released, some of it can be 
harnessed to do work, such as moving a car forward (Figure 1.10▲). The molecules that 
result from the chemical change have less potential energy than the original molecules 
in gasoline and are more stable.
Chemical potential energy, such as the energy contained in the molecules that 
compose gasoline, arises primarily from electrostatic forces between the electrically 
charged particles (protons and electrons) that compose atoms and molecules. We will 
learn more about those particles, as well as the properties of electrical charge, in Chapter 
2, but for now, know that molecules contain specific, usually complex, arrangements of 
these charged particles. Some of these arrangements—such as the one within the mole-
cules that compose gasoline—have a much higher potential energy than others. When 
gasoline undergoes combustion, the arrangement of these particles changes, creating 
molecules with much lower potential energy and transferring a great deal of energy 
(mostly in the form of heat) to the surroundings.
Summarizing Energy:
▶
▶
Energy is always conserved in a physical or chemical change; it is neither created 
nor destroyed.
▶
▶
Systems with high potential energy tend to change in ways that lower their poten-
tial energy, releasing energy into the surroundings.

The Units of Measurement
In 1999, NASA lost the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter. The chairman of the commis-
sion that investigated the disaster concluded, “The root cause of the loss of the spacecraft 
was a failed translation of English units into metric units.” As a result, the orbiter—which 
was supposed to monitor weather on Mars—descended too far into the Martian atmo-
sphere and burned up. In chemistry as in space exploration, units—standard quantities 
used to specify measurements—are critical. If we get them wrong, the consequences can 
be disastrous.
The two most common unit systems are the metric system, used in most of  
the world, and the English system, used in the United States. Scientists use the 
­International System of Units (SI), which is based on the metric system.
Standard Units
Table 1.1, on the next page, shows the standard SI base units. In this chapter, we focus 
on the first four of these units: the meter, the standard unit of length; the kilogram, the

unit of temperature.
The Meter: A Measure of Length
The meter (m) is slightly longer than a yard (1 yard is 36 inches, while 1 meter is 
39.37 inches).
Yardstick
Meterstick
Thus, a 100-yard (yd) football field measures only 91.4 m. The meter was originally 
defined as 1>10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole (through 
Paris). The International Bureau of Weights and Measures now defines it more precisely 
as the distance light travels through a vacuum in a certain period of time, 1>299,792,458 
second. A tall human is about 2 m tall, and the Empire State Building stands 443 m tall 
(including its mast).
The Kilogram: A Measure of Mass
The kilogram (kg), defined as the mass of a metal cylinder kept at the International 
Bureau of Weights and Measures at Sèvres, France, is a measure of mass, a quantity dif-
ferent from weight. The mass of an object is a measure of the quantity of matter within 
it, while the weight of an object is a measure of the gravitational pull on its matter. If you 
could weigh yourself on the moon, for example, its weaker gravity would pull on you with 
less force than does Earth’s gravity, resulting in a lower weight. A 130-pound (lb) person on 
Earth would weigh only 21.5 lb on the moon. However, a person’s mass—the quantity of 
matter in his or her body—remains the same on every planet. One kilogram of mass is the 
equivalent of 2.205 lb of weight on Earth, so expressed in kilograms, a 130-lb person has a 
mass of approximately 59 kg and this book has a mass of about 2.5 kg. A second common 
unit of mass is the gram (g). One gram is 1>1000 kg. A nickel (5¢) has a mass of about 5 g.
The velocity of light in a vacuum is 
3.00 * 108 m>s.
Scientists commonly deal with a 
wide range of lengths and distances. 
The separation between the sun and 
the closest star (Proxima Centauri) 
is about 3.8 * 1016 m, while many 
chemical bonds measure about 
1.5 * 10 - 10 m.

duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation emitted from a certain transition in 
a cesium-133 atom. (We discuss transitions and the emission of radiation by atoms in 
Chapter 7.) Scientists measure time on a large range of scales. The human heart beats 
about once every second, the age of the universe is estimated to be about 4.32 * 1017 s 
(13.7 billion years), and some molecular bonds break or form in time periods as short as 
1 * 10 - 15 s.
The Kelvin: A Measure of Temperature
The kelvin (K) is the SI unit of temperature. The temperature of a sample of matter 
is a measure of the average kinetic energy—the energy due to motion—of the atoms or 
molecules that compose the matter. The molecules in a hot glass of water are, on average, 
moving faster than the molecules in a cold glass of water. Temperature is a measure of 
this molecular motion.
Temperature also determines the direction of thermal energy transfer, what we com-
monly call heat. Thermal energy transfers from hot objects to cold ones. For example, 
when you touch another person’s warm hand (and yours is cold), thermal energy flows 
from his or her hand to yours, making your hand feel warmer. However, if you touch an ice 
cube, thermal energy flows out of your hand to the ice, cooling your hand (and possibly 
melting some of the ice cube).
Figure 1.11▼ shows the three common temperature scales. The most common in 
the United States is the Fahrenheit (°F) scale, shown on the left in Figure 1.11. On the 
Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32 °F and boils at 212 °F at sea level. Room temperature 
is approximately 72 °F. The Fahrenheit scale was originally determined by assigning 0 °F 
to the freezing point of a concentrated saltwater solution and 96 °F to normal body 
temperature.
Scientists and citizens of most countries other than the United States typically use 
the Celsius (°C) scale, shown in the middle in Figure 1.11. On this scale, pure water 
freezes at 0 °C and boils at 100 °C (at sea level). Room temperature is approximately  
22 °C. The Fahrenheit scale and the Celsius scale differ both in the size of their respective 
degrees and the temperature each designates as “zero.” Both the Fahrenheit and Celsius 
scales allow for negative temperatures.
Normal body temperature was later 
measured more accurately to be 
98.6 °F.

The Celsius Temperature Scale

The SI unit for temperature is the kelvin, shown in Figure 1.11. The Kelvin scale 
(sometimes also called the absolute scale) avoids negative temperatures by assigning 0 
K to the coldest temperature possible, absolute zero. Absolute zero (-273 °C or -459 °F) 
is the temperature at which molecular motion virtually stops. Lower temperatures do 
not exist. The size of the kelvin is identical to that of the Celsius degree; the only dif-
ference is the temperature that each scale designates as zero. We can convert between 
the temperature scales with these formulas:
 °C = (°F - 32)
1.8
 K = °C + 273.15
Throughout this book we provide examples worked out in formats that are designed 
to help you develop problem-solving skills. The most common format uses two columns 
to guide you through the worked example. The left column describes the thought pro-
cesses and steps used in solving the problem, while the right column shows the imple-
mentation. Example 1.2 follows this two-column format.
Note that we give Kelvin temperatures 
in kelvins (not “degrees Kelvin”) or K 
(not °K).
Example 1.2	
Converting between Temperature Scales
A sick child has a temperature of 40.00 °C. What is the child’s temperature in (a) K and (b) °F?
Solution
(a)	 Begin by finding the equation that relates the quantity that is given 
(°C) and the quantity you are trying to find (K).
K = °C + 273.15
Since this equation gives the temperature in K directly, substitute in 
the correct value for the temperature in °C and calculate the answer.
 K = °C + 273.15
 K = 40.00 + 273.15 = 313.15 K
(b)	 To convert from °C to °F, first find the equation that relates these 
two quantities.
°C = (°F - 32)
1.8
Since this equation expresses °C in terms of °F, solve the equation 
for °F.
 °C = (°F - 32)
1.8
 1.8(°C) = (°F - 32)
 °F = 1.8(°C) + 32
Now substitute °C into the equation and calculate the answer.
Note: The number of digits reported in this answer follows significant 
figure conventions, covered in Section 1.7.
 °F = 1.8(°C) + 32
 °F = 1.8(40.00 °C) + 32 = 104.00 °F

stop at absolute zero because of

Prefix Multipliers
Scientific notation (see Appendix IA) allows us to express very large or very small quanti-
ties in a compact manner by using exponents. For example, the diameter of a hydrogen 
atom is 1.06 * 10 - 10 m. The International System of Units uses the prefix multipliers 
listed in Table 1.2 with the standard units. These multipliers change the value of the unit 
by powers of 10 (just like an exponent does in scientific notation). For example, the kilo-
meter has the prefix kilo meaning 1000 or 103.  Therefore,
1 kilometer = 1000 meters = 103 meters
Similarly, the millimeter has the prefix milli meaning 0.001 or 10 - 3.
1 millimeter = 0.001 meters = 10 - 3 meters

Table 1.2  SI Prefix Multipliers
When reporting a measurement, choose a prefix multiplier close to the size of the 
quantity you are measuring. For example, to state the diameter of a hydrogen atom,

Derived Units: Volume and Density
A derived unit is a combination of other units. For example, the SI unit for speed is 
meters per second (m>s), a derived unit. Notice that this unit is formed from two other 
SI units—meters and seconds—put together. You are probably more familiar with speed 
measured in miles>hour or kilometers>hour—these are also examples of derived units. 
Two other common derived units are those for volume (SI base unit is m3) and density 
(SI base unit is kg>m3).

Volume
Volume is a measure of space. Any unit of length, when cubed (raised to the third 
power), becomes a unit of volume. The cubic meter (m3), cubic centimeter (cm3), and 
cubic millimeter (mm3) are all units of volume. The cubic nature of volume is not always 
intuitive, and studies have shown that our brains are not naturally wired to process 
abstract concepts such as volume. For example, consider this question: how many small 
cubes measuring 1 cm on each side are required to construct a large cube measuring 10 
cm (or 1 dm) on a side?
The answer to this question, as you can see by carefully examining the unit cube in 
Figure 1.12◀, is 1000 small cubes. When we go from a linear, one-dimensional distance 
to three-dimensional volume, we must raise both the linear dimension and its unit to 
the third power (not multiply by 3). Thus the volume of a cube is equal to the length of 
its edge cubed.
volume of cube = (edge length)3
A cube with a 10-cm edge has a volume of (10 cm)3 or 1000 cm3, and a cube with a  
100-cm edge has a volume of (100 cm)3 = 1,000,000 cm3.
Other common units of volume in chemistry are the liter (L) and the milliliter 
(mL). One milliliter (10 - 3 L) is equal to 1 cm3. A gallon of gasoline contains 3.785 L. 
Table 1.3 lists some common units—for volume and other quantities—and their 
equivalents.
A 10-cm cube contains

Density
An old riddle asks, “Which weighs more, a ton of bricks or a ton of feathers?” The 
answer is neither—they both weigh the same (1 ton). If you answered bricks, you con-
fused weight with density. The density (d) of a substance is the ratio of its mass (m) to 
its volume (V).
Density =
mass
volume  or  d =  m
V
Density is a characteristic physical property of substances (see Table 1.4 on the next 
page) that depends on temperature. Density is an example of an intensive property, 
one that is independent of the amount of the substance. The density of aluminum, for 
example, is the same whether you have a gram or a kilogram. Intensive properties are 
often used to identify substances because these properties depend only on the type of 
substance, not on the amount of it. For example, from Table 1.4 you can see that pure 
gold has a density of 19.3 g>cm3. One way to determine whether a substance is pure gold 
is to determine its density and compare it to 19.3 g>cm3. Mass, in contrast, is an exten-
sive property, one that depends on the amount of the substance. If you know only the 
mass of a sample of gold, that information alone will not allow you to identify it as gold.
The units of density are those of mass divided by volume. Although the SI-derived 
unit for density is kg>m3,  the density of liquids and solids is most often expressed in 
g>cm3  or g>mL. (Remember that cm3 and mL are equivalent units: 1 cm3 = 1 mL.) 
­Aluminum is among the least dense metals with a density of 2.7 g>cm3, while platinum 
is one of the densest metals with a density of 21.4 g>cm3.

	
1.6  The Units of Measurement

Calculating Density
We can calculate the density of a substance by dividing the mass of a given amount of 
the substance by its volume. For example, suppose a small nugget we suspect to be gold 
has a mass of 22.5 g and a volume of 2.38 cm3.  To find its density, we divide the mass by 
the volume:
d = m
V =
22.5 g
2.38 cm3 = 9.45 g>cm3
In this case, the density reveals that the nugget is not pure gold because the density of 
gold is 19.3 g>cm3.

Example 1.3	
Calculating Density
A man receives a platinum ring from his fiancée. Before the wedding, he notices 
that the ring feels a little light for its size, and so he decides to determine its density. 
He places the ring on a balance and finds that it has a mass of 3.15 g. He then finds 
that the ring displaces 0.233 cm3 of water. Is the ring made of platinum? (Note: The 
volume of irregularly shaped objects is often measured by the displacement of 
water. To use this method, the object is placed in water and the change in volume 
of the water is measured. This increase in the total volume represents the volume of 
water displaced by the object and is equal to the volume of the object.)
Set up the problem by writing the important 
information that is given as well as the infor-
mation that you are asked to find. In this case, 
we need to find the density of the ring and 
compare it to that of platinum.
Note: In Section 1.8, we discuss this standardized 
way of setting up problems.
GIVEN:  m = 3.15 g
V = 0.233 cm3
FIND:  Density in g>cm3
Next, write down the equation that defines 
density.
EQUATION  d = m
V
Solve the problem by substituting the correct 
values of mass and volume into the expres-
sion for density.
SOLUTION 
d = m
V =
3.15 g
0.233 cm3 = 13.5 g>cm3
The density of the ring is much too low to be platinum (platinum density is 
21.4 g>cm3), and the ring is therefore a fake.
For Practice 1.3  The woman in Example 1.3 is shocked that the ring is fake 
and returns it. She buys a new ring that has a mass of 4.53 g and a volume of 
0.212 cm3. Is the new ring genuine?
For More Practice 1.3  A metal cube has an edge that is 11.4 mm long and a 
mass of 6.67 g. Calculate the density of the metal and use Table 1.4 to determine the 
likely identity of the metal.

Carbon monoxide is a colorless gas emitted by motor vehicles and found in

steoporosis—which means porous bone—is a condi-
tion in which bone density becomes low. The healthy 
bones of a young adult have a density of about 1.0 g>cm3. 
Patients suffering from osteoporosis, however, can have 
bone densities as low as 0.22 g>cm3. These low densities 
indicate that the bones have deteriorated and weakened, 
resulting in increased susceptibility to fractures, especially 
hip fractures. Patients suffering from osteoporosis can also 
experience height loss and disfiguration such as dowager’s 
hump, a condition in which the patient becomes hunched 
over due to compression of the vertebrae. Osteoporosis is 
most common in postmenopausal women, but it can also 
occur in people (including men) who have certain diseases, 
such as insulin-dependent diabetes, or who take certain 
medications, such as prednisone. Osteoporosis is usually 
diagnosed and monitored with hip X-rays. Low-density 
bones absorb less of the X-rays than do high-density 
bones, producing characteristic differences in the X-ray 
image. Treatments for osteoporosis include calcium and  
vitamin D supplements, drugs that prevent bone weaken-
ing, exercise and strength training, and, in extreme cases, 
hip-replacement surgery.

The first thing you should notice about these values is that they decrease over time. 
For this decrease, we can thank the Clean Air Act and its amendments, which have 
resulted in more efficient engines and specially blended fuels and consequently in cleaner 
air in all major U.S. cities over the last 30 years. The second thing you might notice is the 
number of digits to which the measurements are reported. The number of digits in a 
reported measurement indicates the certainty associated with that measurement. A less 
certain measurement of carbon monoxide levels might be reported as follows:

Notice that the first set of data is reported to the nearest 0.1 ppm while the second 
set is reported to the nearest 1 ppm. Scientists report measured quantities in an agreed-
upon standard way. The number of reported digits reflects the certainty in the measure-
ment: more digits, more certainty; fewer digits, less certainty. Numbers are usually 
written so that the uncertainty is in the last reported digit. (We assume that uncertainty 
to be ±1 in the last digit unless otherwise indicated.) By reporting the 2013 carbon mon-
oxide concentration as 1.9 ppm, the scientists mean 1.9{0.1 ppm. The carbon monox-
ide concentration is between 1.8 and 2.0 ppm—it might be 2.0 ppm, for example, but it 
could not be 3.0 ppm. In contrast, if the reported value was 2 ppm (as in the second set 
of measurements), this would mean 2{1 ppm, or between 1 and 3 ppm. In general,
Scientific measurements are reported so that every digit is certain 
except the last, which is estimated.
For example, consider the following reported number:
5.213
certain
estimated
The first three digits are certain; the last digit is estimated.
The number of digits reported in a measurement depends on the measuring device. 
Consider weighing a pistachio nut on two different balances (Figure 1.13▶). The balance 
on the top has marks every 1 g, while the balance on the bottom has marks every 0.1 g. 
For the balance on the top, we mentally divide the space between the 1- and 2-g marks 
into ten equal spaces and estimate that the pointer is at about 1.2 g. We then write the 
measurement as 1.2 g, indicating that we are sure of the “1” but we have estimated the 
“.2.” The balance on the bottom, with marks every tenth of a gram, requires that we write 
the result with more digits. The pointer is between the 1.2-g mark and the 1.3-g mark. 
We again divide the space between the two marks into ten equal spaces and estimate the 
third digit. For the figure shown, we report 1.27 g.
▲ Figure 1.13  Estimation 
in Weighing  (a) This scale has 
markings every 1 g, so we mentally 
divide the space into ten equal 
spaces to estimate the last digit. This 
reading is 1.2 g. (b) Because this 
balance has markings every 0.1 g, 
we estimate to the hundredths place. 
This reading is 1.27 g.
Meniscus
Example 1.4	
Reporting the Correct Number of Digits
The graduated cylinder shown in the right margin has markings every  
0.1 mL. Report the volume (which is read at the bottom of the meniscus) to the 
correct number of digits. (Note: The meniscus is the crescent-shaped surface at 
the top of a column of liquid.)
Solution
Since the bottom of the meniscus is between the 4.5 and 4.6 mL markings, men-
tally divide the space between the markings into ten equal spaces and estimate 
the next digit. In this case, you should report the result as 4.57 mL.
What if you estimated a little differently and wrote 4.56 mL? In general, a  
one-unit difference in the last digit is acceptable because the last digit is estimated 
and different people might estimate it slightly differently. However, if you wrote 
4.63 mL, you would have misreported the measurement.
For Practice 1.4  Record the temperature on the thermometer shown in the 
right margin to the correct number of digits.

Chapter 1  Matter, Measurement, and Problem Solving
Counting Significant Figures
The precision of a measurement—which depends on the instrument used to make 
the measurement—must be preserved, not only when recording the measurement, 
but also when performing calculations that use the measurement. We can accomplish 
the preservation of this precision by using significant figures. In any reported measure-
ment, the non–place-holding digits—those that are not simply marking the decimal 
place—are called significant figures (or significant digits). The greater the num-
ber of significant figures, the greater the certainty of the measurement. For example, the 
number 23.5 has three significant figures while the number 23.56 has four. To deter-
mine the number of significant figures in a number containing zeroes, we distinguish 
between zeroes that are significant and those that simply mark the decimal place. For 
example, in the number 0.0008, the leading zeroes (zeroes to the left of the first non-
zero digit) mark the decimal place but do not add to the certainty of the measurement 
and are therefore not significant; this number has only one significant figure. In con-
trast, the trailing zeroes (zeroes at the end of a number) in the number 0.000800 do 
add to the certainty of the measurement and are therefore counted as significant; this 
number has three significant figures.
Exact Numbers
Exact numbers have no uncertainty and thus do not limit the number of significant 
figures in any calculation. We can regard an exact number as having an unlimited num-
ber of significant figures. Exact numbers originate from three sources:
• From the accurate counting of discrete objects. For example, 3 atoms means 
3.00000. . . atoms.
• From defined quantities, such as the number of centimeters in 1 m. Because 100 cm 
is defined as 1 m,
100 cm = 1 m means 100.00000ccm = 1.0000000cm
• From integral numbers that are part of an equation. For example, in the equation 
radius = diameter
2
, the number 2 is exact and therefore has an unlimited number of 
significant figures.

1.	 All nonzero digits are significant.
28.03

2.	 Interior zeroes (zeroes between two nonzero digits) are significant.

3.	 Leading zeroes (zeroes to the left of the first nonzero digit) are not significant. 
They only serve to locate the decimal point.

4.	 Trailing zeroes (zeroes at the end of a number) are categorized as follows:
• Trailing zeroes after a decimal point are always significant.
45.000
3.5600
• Trailing zeroes before a decimal point (and after a nonzero number) are  
always significant.

• Trailing zeroes before an implied decimal point are ambiguous and should be 
avoided by using scientific notation.

Significant Figures in Calculations
When we use measured quantities in calculations, the results of the calculation must 
reflect the precision of the measured quantities. We should not lose or gain precision 
during mathematical operations. Follow these rules when carrying significant figures 
through calculations.

the result carries the same 
number of significant figures 
as the factor with the fewest

In addition and subtraction, it is helpful to draw a  
line next to the number with the fewest decimal  
places. This line determines the number of decimal  
places in the answer.
3.	 When rounding to the cor-
rect number of significant fig-
ures, round down if the last 
(or leftmost) digit dropped 
is four or less; round up if 
the last (or leftmost) digit 
dropped is five or more.
Rounding to two significant figures:
5.37 rounds to 5.4
5.34 rounds to 5.3
5.35 rounds to 5.4
5.349 rounds to 5.3
Notice in the last example (5.349) that only the  
leftmost digit being dropped (in this example, the 4)  
determines how you round the number. You ignore  
all the digits to the right of the leftmost digit you  
are dropping (in this example, you ignore the 9).
Example 1.5	
Determining the Number of Significant Figures in a Number
How many significant figures are in each number?

(c)	 10 dm = 1 m	
(d)	 1.000 * 105 s	
(e)	 0.00002 mm	
(f)	 10,000 m
Solution
(a)	 0.04450 m
Four significant figures. The two 4s and the 5 are significant (Rule 1). The trailing zero is after a  
decimal point and is therefore significant (Rule 4). The leading zeroes only mark the decimal place 
and are therefore not significant (Rule 3).
(b)	 5.0003 km
Five significant figures. The 5 and 3 are significant (Rule 1), as are the three interior zeroes (Rule 2).
(c)	 10 dm = 1 m
Unlimited significant figures. Defined quantities have an unlimited number of significant figures.
(d)	 1.000 * 105 s
Four significant figures. The 1 is significant (Rule 1). The trailing zeroes are after a decimal point and 
therefore significant (Rule 4).
(e)	 0.00002 mm
One significant figure. The 2 is significant (Rule 1). The leading zeroes only mark the decimal place 
and are therefore not significant (Rule 3).
(f)	 10,000 m
Ambiguous. The 1 is significant (Rule 1), but the trailing zeroes occur before an implied  
decimal point and are therefore ambiguous (Rule 4). Without more information, you would  
assume one significant figure. It is better to write this as 1 * 105 to indicate one significant figure 
or as 1.0000 * 105 to indicate five (Rule 4).
For Practice 1.5  How many significant figures are in each number?
(a)	 554 km	
(b)	 7 pennies	
(c)	 1.01 * 105 m	
(d)	 0.00099 s	
(e)	 1.4500 km	
(f)	 21,000 m
A few books recommend a slightly 
different rounding procedure for cases 
in which the last digit is 5. However, 
the procedure presented here is 
consistent with electronic calculators 
and will be used throughout this book.

Example 1.6	
Significant Figures in Calculations
Notice that for multiplication or division, the quantity with the fewest significant 
figures determines the number of significant figures in the answer, but for addition and 
subtraction, the quantity with the fewest decimal places determines the number of deci-
mal places in the answer. In multiplication and division, we focus on significant figures, 
but in addition and subtraction we focus on decimal places. When a problem involves 
addition or subtraction, the answer may have a different number of significant figures 
than the initial quantities. Keep this in mind in problems that involve both addition or 
subtraction and multiplication or division. For example,
 1.002 - 0.999
3.754
= 0.003
3.754
 = 7.99 * 10 - 4
 = 8 * 10 - 4
The answer has only one significant figure, even though the initial numbers had three or 
four.

	
1.7  The Reliability of a Measurement	
25
Precision and Accuracy
Scientists often repeat measurements several times to increase confidence in the result. 
We distinguish between two different kinds of certainty—accuracy and precision—­
associated with such measurements. Accuracy refers to how close the measured value 
is to the actual value. Precision refers to how close a series of measurements are to one 
another or how reproducible they are. A series of measurements can be precise (close to 
one another in value and reproducible) but not accurate (not close to the true value). 
Consider the results of three students who repeatedly weighed a lead block known to 
have a true mass of 10.00 g (indicated by the solid horizontal blue line on the graphs in 
the accompanying figure).

• The results of student A are both inaccurate (not close to the true value) and impre-
cise (not consistent with one another). The inconsistency is the result of random 
error, error that has equal probability of being too high or too low. Almost all 
measurements have some degree of random error. Random error can, with enough 
trials, average itself out.
• The results of student B are precise (close to one another in value) but inaccurate. 
The inaccuracy is the result of systematic error, error that tends to be either too 
high or too low. In contrast to random error, systematic error does not average out 
with repeated trials. For instance, if a balance is not properly calibrated, it will sys-
tematically read too high or too low.
• The results of student C display little systematic error or random error—they are 
both accurate and precise.

Solving Chemical Problems
Learning to solve problems is one of the most important skills you will acquire in this 
course. No one succeeds in chemistry—or in life, really—without the ability to solve 
problems. Although no simple formula applies to every chemistry problem, you can 
learn problem-solving strategies and begin to develop some chemical intuition. Many 
of the problems you will solve in this course are unit conversion problems, where you are 
given one or more quantities and asked to convert them into different units. Other prob-
lems require that you use specific equations to get to the information you are trying to 
find. In the sections that follow, you will find strategies to help you solve both of these 
types of problems. Of course, many problems contain both conversions and equations, 
requiring the combination of these strategies, and some problems may require an alto-
gether different approach.
Converting from One Unit to Another
In Section 1.6, we discussed the SI unit system, the prefix multipliers, and a few other 
units. Knowing how to work with and manipulate these units in calculations is central to 
solving chemical problems. In calculations, units help to determine correctness. Using 
Chemistry IN YOUR DAY | Integrity in Data Gathering
M
ost scientists spend many hours collecting data in the 
laboratory. Often, the data do not turn out exactly as 
the scientist had expected (or hoped). A scientist may then 
be tempted to “fudge” the results. For example, suppose 
you are expecting a particular set of measurements to fol-
low a certain pattern. After working hard over several days 
or weeks to make the measurements, you notice that a few 
of them do not quite fit the pattern that you anticipated. You 
might find yourself wishing that you could simply change or 
omit the “faulty” measurements. Altering data in this way is 
considered highly unethical in the scientific community and, 
when discovered, is punished severely.
In 2004, Dr. Hwang Woo Suk, a stem cell researcher at 
the Seoul National University in Korea, published a research 
paper in Science (a highly respected research journal) claim-
ing that he and his colleagues had cloned human embryonic 
stem cells. As part of his evidence, he showed photographs 
of the cells. The paper was hailed as an incredible break-
through, and Dr. Hwang traveled the world lecturing on his 
work. Time magazine even included him on its “people that 
matter” list for 2004. Several months later, however, one of 
his coworkers revealed that the photographs were fraudulent. 
According to the coworker, the photographs came from a 
computer data bank of stem cell photographs, not from a 
cloning experiment. A university panel investigated the re-
sults and confirmed that the photographs and other data had 
indeed been faked. Dr. Hwang was forced to resign his presti-
gious post at the university.
Although not common, incidents like this do occur from 
time to time. They are damaging to a community that is large-
ly built on trust. A scientist’s peers (other researchers in sim-
ilar fields) review all published research papers, but usually 
they are judging whether the data support the conclusion—
they assume that the experimental measurements are au-
thentic. The pressure to succeed sometimes leads research-
ers to betray that trust. However, over time, the tendency of 
scientists to reproduce and build upon one another’s work  
results in the discovery of the fraudulent data. When that 
happens, the researchers at fault are usually banished from 
the community and their careers are ruined.

units as a guide to solving problems is called dimensional analysis. Units should 
always be included in calculations; they are multiplied, divided, and canceled like any 
other algebraic quantity.
Consider converting 12.5 inches (in) to centimeters (cm). We know from Table 1.3 
that 1  in = 2.54 cm (exact), so we can use this quantity in the calculation.
12.5 in * 2.54 cm
1 in
= 31.8 cm
The unit, in, cancels, and we are left with cm as our final unit. The quantity 2.54 cm
1 in  is a 
conversion factor—a fractional quantity with the units we are converting from on the 
bottom and the units we are converting to on the top. Conversion factors are constructed 
from any two equivalent quantities. In this example, 2.54 cm = 1 in, so we construct the 
conversion factor by dividing both sides of the equality by 1 in and canceling the units.
2.54 cm = 1 in
2.54 cm
1 in
= 1 in
1 in
2.54 cm
1 in
= 1
Because the quantity 2.54 cm
1 in  is equivalent to 1, multiplying by the conversion factor 
affects only the units, not the actual quantity. To convert the other way, from centime-
ters to inches, we must—using units as a guide—use a different form of the conversion 
factor. If we accidentally use the same form, we will get the wrong result, indicated by 
erroneous units. For example, suppose that we want to convert 31.8 cm to inches.
31.8 cm * 2.54 cm
1 in
= 80.8 cm2
in
The units in the answer (cm2>in), as well as the value of the answer, are obviously 
wrong. When we solve a problem, we always look at the final units. Are they the desired 
units? We must always look at the magnitude of the numerical answer as well. Does it 
make sense? In this case, our mistake was the form of the conversion factor. It should 
have been inverted so that the units cancel as follows:
31.8 cm *
1 in
2.54 cm = 12.5 in
We can invert conversion factors because they are equal to 1 and the inverse of 1 is 1. 
Therefore,
2.54 cm
1 in
= 1 =
1 in
2.54 cm
Most unit conversion problems take the following form:
 Information given   *  conversion factor(s) = information sought
 Given unit   * 
 desired unit
given unit
 = desired unit
In this book, we diagram problem solutions using a conceptual plan. A conceptual 
plan is a visual outline that helps us to see the general flow of the problem solution. For 
unit conversions, the conceptual plan focuses on units and the conversion from one 
unit to another. The conceptual plan for converting in to cm is:
2.54 cm
1 in
cm
in
The conceptual plan for converting the other way, from cm to in, is just the reverse, with 
the reciprocal conversion factor:
1 in
2.54 cm
in

28	
Chapter 1  Matter, Measurement, and Problem Solving
Each arrow in a conceptual plan for a unit conversion has an associated conversion fac-
tor, with the units of the previous step in the denominator and the units of the follow-
ing step in the numerator. In the following section, we incorporate the idea of a 
conceptual plan into an overall approach to solving numerical chemical problems.
General Problem-Solving Strategy
In this book, we introduce a standard problem-solving procedure that you can adapt 
to many of the problems encountered in general chemistry and beyond. One of the 
difficulties beginning students encounter when trying to solve problems in general 
chemistry is not knowing where to begin. To solve any problem, you must assess the 
information given in the problem and devise a way to determine the requested infor-
mation. In other words, you must do the following:
• Identify the starting point (the given information).
• Identify the end point (what you must find).
• Devise a way to get from the starting point to the end point using what is given as 
well as what you already know or can look up. (As we just discussed, this is the­ 
 conceptual plan.)
In graphic form, we can represent this progression as:
Given i Conceptual Plan i Find
Although no problem-solving procedure is applicable to all problems, the following 
four-step procedure can be helpful in working through many of the numerical problems 
you will encounter in this book.
1.	 Sort.  Begin by sorting the information in the problem. Given information is the 
basic data provided by the problem—often one or more numbers with their associ-
ated units. Find indicates what information you will need for your answer.
2.	 Strategize.  This is usually the most challenging part of solving a problem. In this 
process, you must develop a conceptual plan—a series of steps that take you from the 
given information to the information you are trying to find. You have already seen 
conceptual plans for simple unit conversion problems. Each arrow in a conceptual 
plan represents a computational step. On the left side of the arrow is the quantity 
you had before the step, on the right side of the arrow is the quantity you have after 
the step, and below the arrow is the information you need to get from one to the 
other—the relationship between the quantities.
Often such relationships take the form of conversion factors or equations. These 
may be given in the problem, in which case you will have written them down under 
“Given” in step 1. Usually, however, you will need other information—which may 
include physical constants, formulas, or conversion factors—to help get you from what 
you are given to what you must find. This information comes from what you have 
learned or can look up in the chapter or in tables within the book.
In some cases, you may get stuck at the strategize step. If you cannot figure out how 
to get from the given information to the information you are asked to find, you might 
try working backward. For example, you can look at the units of the quantity you are try-
ing to find and attempt to find conversion factors to get to the units of the given quan-
tity. You may even try a combination of strategies; work forward, backward, or some of 
both. If you persist, you will develop a strategy to solve the problem.
3.	 Solve.  This is the easiest part of solving a problem. Once you set up the problem 
properly and devise a conceptual plan, you simply follow the plan to solve the 
problem. Carry out any mathematical operations (paying attention to the rules for 
significant figures in calculations) and cancel units as needed.
4.	 Check.  This is the step beginning students most often overlook. Experienced 
problem solvers always ask, “Does this answer make sense? Are the units correct?  
Is the number of significant figures correct?” When solving multistep problems, 
Most problems can be solved in 
more than one way. The solutions 
in this book tend to be the most 
straightforward but certainly are not 
the only way to solve the problem.

errors can easily creep into the solution. You can catch most of these errors by sim-
ply checking the answer. For example, suppose you are calculating the number of 
atoms in a gold coin and end up with an answer of 1.1 * 10 - 6 atoms. Could the 
gold coin really be composed of one-millionth of one atom?
In Examples 1.7 and 1.8, this problem-solving procedure is applied to unit conver-
sion problems. The procedure is summarized in the left column, and two examples of 
applying the procedure are provided in the middle and right columns. This three-­
column format is used in selected examples throughout this text. It allows you to see 
how to apply a particular procedure to two different problems. Work through one prob-
lem first (from top to bottom) and then see how you can apply the same procedure to 
the other problem. Recognizing the commonalities and differences between problems is 
a key part of developing problem-solving skills.

Units Raised to a Power
When building conversion factors for units raised to a power, remember to raise both the 
number and the unit to the power. For example, to convert from in2 to cm2, we construct 
the conversion factor as follows:
 2.54 cm = 1 in
 (2.54 cm)2 = (1 in)2
 (2.54)2 cm2 = 12 in2
 6.45 cm2 = 1 in2

Order-of-Magnitude Estimations
Calculation is an integral part of chemical problem solving. But precise numerical calcu-
lation is not always necessary, or even possible. Sometimes data are only approximate; 
other times we may not need a high degree of precision—a rough estimate or a simpli-
fied “back of the envelope” calculation is enough. We can also use approximate calcu-
lations to get an initial feel for a problem or to make a quick check to see whether our 
solution is “in the right ballpark.”
One way to make such estimates is to simplify the numbers so that they can be 
manipulated easily. The technique known as order-of-magnitude estimation is based on 
focusing only on the exponential part of numbers written in scientific notation, accord-
ing to these guidelines:
• If the decimal part of the number is less than 5, just drop it. Thus, 4.36 * 105  
becomes 105 and 2.7 * 10 - 3 becomes 10 - 3.
• If the decimal part is 5 or more, round it up to 10 and rewrite the number as a power 
of 10. Thus, 5.982 * 107 becomes 10 * 107 = 108, and 6.1101 * 10 - 3  
becomes 10 * 10 - 3 = 10 - 2.
When we make these approximations, we are left with powers of 10, which are eas-
ier to multiply and divide. Of course, our answer is only as reliable as the numbers used 
to get it, so we should not assume that the results of an order-of-magnitude calculation 
are accurate to more than an order of magnitude.
Suppose, for example, that we want to estimate the number of atoms that an 
immortal being could have counted in the 14 billion (1.4 * 1010) years that the universe 
has been in existence, assuming a counting rate of ten atoms per second. Since a year has 
3.2 * 107 seconds, we can approximate the number of atoms counted as follows:
	
1010  years	
* 	
 107 seconds

* 	
101 atoms

STRATEGIZE  Draw the conceptual plan by 
beginning with the given quantity—in this 
case the volume in liters (L). The overall goal of 
this problem is to find the mass. You can con-
vert between volume and mass using density 
(g>cm3). However, you must first convert the 
volume to cm3. After you convert the volume 
to cm3, use the density to convert to g. Finally, 
convert g to kg.

magnitude to the given volume (173,231 L or 1.73231 * 105 L), as expected for a density close to 1(0.768 g>cm3).

Chapter 1  Matter, Measurement, and Problem Solving
A million trillion atoms (1018) may seem like a lot, but as we discuss in Chapter 2, a speck 
of matter made up of a million trillion atoms is nearly impossible to see without a 
microscope.
In our general problem-solving procedure, the last step is to check whether the 
results seem reasonable. Order-of-magnitude estimations often help us catch the kinds 
of mistakes that can happen in a detailed calculation, such as entering an incorrect 
exponent or sign into a calculator, or multiplying when we should have divided.
Problems Involving an Equation
We can solve problems involving equations in much the same way as problems involv-
ing conversions. Usually, in problems involving equations, we must find one of the vari-
ables in the equation, given the others. The conceptual plan concept outlined earlier can 
be used for problems involving equations. For example, suppose we are given the mass 
(m) and volume (V) of a sample and asked to calculate its density. The conceptual plan 
shows how the equation takes us from the given quantities to the find quantity:
d
m,V
d = m
V
Here, instead of a conversion factor under the arrow, this conceptual plan has an equa-
tion. The equation shows the relationship between the quantities on the left of the arrow 
and the quantities on the right. Note that at this point the equation need not be solved 
for the quantity on the right (although in this particular case it is). The procedure that 
follows, as well as the two examples, offer guidance for developing a strategy to solve 
problems involving equations. We again use the three-column format. Work through 
one problem from top to bottom and then see how you can apply the same general pro-
cedure to the second problem.

Key Concepts
Atoms and Molecules (1.1)
▶
▶All matter is composed of atoms and molecules.
▶
▶Chemistry is the science that investigates the properties of matter 
by examining the atoms and molecules that compose it.
The Scientific Approach to Knowledge (1.2)
▶
▶Science begins with the observation of the physical world. A num-
ber of related observations can be summarized in a statement or 
generalization called a scientific law.
▶
▶A hypothesis is a tentative interpretation or explanation of obser-
vations. One or more well-established hypotheses may prompt 
the development of a scientific theory, a model for nature that  
explains the underlying reasons for observations and laws.
▶
▶Laws, hypotheses, and theories all give rise to predictions that 
can be tested by experiments, carefully controlled procedures de-
signed to produce critical new observations. If scientists cannot 
confirm the predictions, they must modify or replace the law,  
hypothesis, or theory.
The Classification of Matter (1.3)
▶
▶We classify matter according to its state (solid, liquid, or gas) or ac-
cording to its composition (pure substance or mixture).
▶
▶A pure substance can either be an element, which cannot be 
chemically broken down into simpler substances, or a com-
pound, which is composed of two or more elements in fixed 
proportions.
▶
▶A mixture can be either homogeneous, with the same composi-
tion throughout, or heterogeneous, with different compositions 
in different regions.
The Properties of Matter (1.4)
▶
▶We classify the properties of matter into two types: physical and 
chemical. Matter displays its physical properties without chang-
ing its composition.
▶
▶Changes in matter in which composition does not change are 
physical changes. Changes in matter in which composition does 
change are chemical changes.
Energy (1.5)
▶
▶In chemical and physical changes, matter often exchanges ener-
gy with its surroundings. In these exchanges, the total energy is  
always conserved; energy is neither created nor destroyed.
▶
▶Systems with high potential energy tend to change in the direction 
of lower potential energy, releasing energy into the ­surroundings.
The Units of Measurement and Significant  
Figures (1.6, 1.7)
▶
▶Scientists use SI units, which are based on the metric system. The 
SI base units include the meter (m) for length, the kilogram (kg) for 
mass, the second (s) for time, and the kelvin (K) for temperature.
▶
▶Derived units are formed from a combination of other units. 
Common derived units include those for volume (cm3 or m3)  
and density (g>cm3).
▶
▶The number of digits in a reported measurement reflects the  
uncertainty in the measurement. Significant figures are the non–
place-holding digits in a reported number.

	140. 	Nanotechnology, the field of building ultrasmall structures one 
atom at a time, has progressed in recent years. One potential 
application of nanotechnology is the construction of artificial 
cells. The simplest cells would probably mimic red blood cells, 
the body’s oxygen transporters. Nanocontainers, perhaps 
constructed of carbon, could be pumped full of oxygen and 
injected into a person’s bloodstream. If the person needed 
additional oxygen—due to a heart attack perhaps, or for the 
purpose of space travel—these containers could slowly release 
oxygen into the blood, allowing tissues that would otherwise 
die to remain alive. Suppose that the nanocontainers were cubic 
and had an edge length of 25 nm.

ness of the nanocontainer’s wall.)

gen pressurized to a density of 85 g>L. How many grams of 
oxygen could each nanocontainer contain?
c.	 Air typically contains about 0.28 g of oxygen per liter. An aver-
age human inhales about 0.50 L of air per breath and takes 
about 20 breaths per minute. How many grams of oxygen does 
a human inhale per hour? (Assume two significant figures.)
d.	What is the minimum number of nanocontainers that a per-
son would need in his or her bloodstream to provide 1 hour’s 
worth of oxygen?
e.	 What is the minimum volume occupied by the number of 
nanocontainers calculated in part d? Is such a volume feasi-
ble, given that total blood volume in an adult is about 5 L?

Data Interpretation and Analysis
Density of Water
	155.	 The graph in Figure a▼ plots the density of water as a function 
of temperature at a pressure of 1.00 atm. The graph in Figure b▼ 
plots the density of water as a function of temperature over a 
narrower range, between 0 °C and 10 °C. 
Use the information provided in the figures to answer the 
following questions:
a.	 Compare the density of solid ice at 0 °C to the density of 
­liquid water at 4 °C. Use this information to explain why ice 
floats on water and why ice forms on the top of ponds and 
lakes in winter in places such as Wisconsin and Minnesota, 
allowing fish to survive in the water below the ice.
b.	 Observations by the Hubble Space Telescope estimate Pluto’s 
mean density is between 1.8 g>cm3 and 2.1 g>cm3. In 2006 
the International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto 
from a planet to a dwarf planet in part due to Pluto’s low 
density. By comparison, the mean density of Earth’s moon 
is 3,346.4 kg>m3. The crust of Earth’s moon is composed pri-
marily of rock containing oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, 
calcium, and aluminum. Given this information, answer the 
following questions:
i.	 Does the mean density of Pluto support a claim that Pluto 
is mostly ice or does it indicate that Pluto is mostly rock?
ii.	 The temperature of Pluto ranges from -233 °C to -223 °C. 
A cold winter day in Antarctica is -65.1 °C. How does the 
density of H2O on Pluto compare to the density of H2O in 
Antarctica? (Extrapolate data as needed.)
c.	 Antarctica contains 26.5 million cubic kilometers of ice. 
­Assume that the average temperature of this ice during the 
summer months is -20 °C. If all of this ice melted, how many 
km3 of liquid water would form at 4 °C?
d.	 Pluto has a mass of 1.27 
 * 1022 kg and contains about 30% 
ice. ­Assume that the density of this ice is the same as it is at  
-175 °C. If humans traveled to Pluto on a spacecraft and were 
able to remove all of the ice from Pluto, and melt the ice, how 
many km3 of liquid water would form at 4 °C? Is there more 
water on Antarctica or on Pluto?

theory gives the underlying reasons for them.
Pure Substances and Mixtures

Chemical and Physical Changes
1.3	 View (a) best represents the water after vaporization. Vapor-
ization is a physical change, so the molecules must remain the 
same before and after the change.
The Mass of a Gas
1.4	 No, the mass does not change. The water vaporizes and becomes 
a gas, but the water molecules are still present within the flask 
and have the same mass.
Prefix Multipliers
1.5	 The prefix micro (10 - 6) is appropriate. The measurement would 
be reported as 55.7 mm.
Density
1.6	 (c) The copper sample expands. However, because its mass re-
mains constant while its volume increases, its density decreases.

f you cut a piece of graphite from the tip of a pencil into smaller and smaller 
pieces, how far could you go? Could you divide it forever? Would you eventually 
run into some basic particles that were no longer divisible, not because of their 
sheer smallness, but because of the nature of matter? This fundamental question 
about the nature of matter has been asked by thinkers for over two millennia. Their 
answers have varied over time. On the scale of everyday objects, matter appears con-
tinuous, or infinitely divisible. And until about 200 years ago, many scientists 
thought that matter was indeed continuous—but they were proven wrong. If you 
were to divide the graphite from your pencil tip into smaller and smaller pieces (far 
smaller than the eye could see), you would eventually end up with individual car-
bon atoms. The word atom comes from the Greek atomos, meaning “indivisible.” 
You cannot divide a carbon atom into smaller pieces and still have carbon. Atoms 
compose all ordinary matter—if you want to understand matter, you must begin by 
understanding atoms.

Brownian Motion: Atoms Comfirmed
In 1827, Scottish botanist Robert Brown (1773–1858) looked through his microscope at 
water-suspended particles that had come from pollen grains. He noticed that the pollen 
particles were in continuous motion. Any one particle traveled a random, jittery path 

46	
Chapter 2  Atoms and Elements
through the liquid water. Brown initially thought that the particles might be alive and 
were perhaps the male sexual cells of plants (similar to sperm). However, similar parti-
cles from plants long dead exhibited the same jittery motion, and so did the dust from 
pulverized stones. Brown concluded that the source of the motion must not come from 
the particles themselves. What was causing this motion?
The definitive answer to this question did not come until 1905, when Albert  
Einstein (1879–1955) developed a theory that quantitatively explained what was by 
then called Brownian motion. Einstein’s model explained the motion Brown had 
observed as a result of the molecular bombardments of the particles due to the ther-
mal energy of the surrounding water. In other words, the water molecules in liquid 
water—constantly in motion due to thermal energy—were continuously battering 
the pollen and dust particles, causing them to oscillate and move. In Einstein’s 
model, the jittering pollen particles are like a beach ball that is thrown into a crowd 
at a graduation ceremony. As the eager graduates strike the ball over and over again, 
the ball moves through the crowd in a jittery random path. The difference is that,  
in the case of Brownian motion, the “crowd” is composed of molecules much too 
small to see.
In 1908, French physicist Jean Perrin (1870–1942) conducted experimental mea-
surements to test Einstein’s model. His measurements confirmed that Einstein’s model 
was valid. In 1926, Perrin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. During the award 
speech, the presenter said, “the object of the researches of Professor Jean Perrin which 
have gained for him the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1926 was to put a definite end to the 
long struggle regarding the real existence of molecules.” In other words, the work of 
Einstein, and then Perrin, removed any lingering doubt about the particulate nature 
of matter.
In Einstein’s day, the existence of atoms was inferred from the jittery motion 
first witnessed by Brown. Today, with a type of microscope called a scanning tunnel-
ing microscope (STM), we can form images of atoms themselves. In fact, STM can be 
used to pick up and move individual atoms, allowing structures and patterns to be 
made one atom at a time. Figure 2.1◀, for example, shows the Kanji characters for 
the word “atom” written with individual iron atoms on top of a copper surface. If all 
of the words in the books in the Library of Congress—35 million books occupying 
840 miles of shelves—were written in letters the size of these Kanji characters, they 
would fit into an area of about five square millimeters. Scientists at IBM have also 
succeeded in making a short video entitled A Boy and His Atom, in which the main 
character (a boy) is animated using a few dozen atoms. In the video, which has been 
viewed millions of times on YouTube, the boy plays with an atom like a real boy 
would play with a ball.
As we discussed in Chapter 1, it was only 200 years ago that John Dalton proposed 
his atomic theory, and about 100 years ago that the theory was confirmed through 
the work of Einstein and Perrin. Yet today we can image atoms, move them, and even 
build tiny machines out of just a few dozen atoms (an area of research called nano-
technology). These atomic machines, and the atoms that compose them, are almost 
unimaginably small. To get an idea of the size of an atom, imagine picking up a grain 
of sand at a beach. That grain contains more atoms than you could count in a lifetime. 
In fact, the number of atoms in one sand grain far exceeds the number of grains on an 
entire beach.
In spite of their small size, atoms are the key to connecting the macroscopic and 
microscopic worlds. An atom is the smallest identifiable unit of an element. There are 
about 91 different naturally occurring elements. In addition, scientists have suc-
ceeded in making over 20 synthetic elements (elements not found in nature). In this 
chapter, we learn about atoms: what they are made of, how they differ from one 
another, and how they are structured. We also learn about the elements that are com-
posed of these different kinds of atoms and about some of their characteristic proper-
ties. We will also discuss how the elements can be organized in a way that reveals 
patterns in their properties and helps us to understand what underlies those 
properties.

Early Ideas about the Building  
Blocks of Matter
The first people to propose that matter was composed of small, indestructible parti-
cles were Leucippus (fifth century b.c., exact dates unknown) and his student Dem-
ocritus (460–370 b.c.). These Greek philosophers theorized that matter is ultimately 
composed of small, indivisible particles they named atomos. Democritus wrote, “Noth-
ing exists except atoms and empty space; everything else is opinion.” Leucippus and 
Democritus proposed that many different kinds of atoms exist, each different in shape 
and size, and that they move randomly through empty space. Other influential Greek 
thinkers of the time, such as Plato and Aristotle, did not embrace the atomic ideas of 
Leucippus and Democritus. Instead, Plato and Aristotle held that matter had no small-
est parts and that different substances were composed of various proportions of fire, 
air, earth, and water. Since there was no experimental way to test the relative merits of 
the competing ideas, Aristotle’s view prevailed, largely because he was so influential. 
The idea that matter is composed of atoms took a back seat in intellectual thought for 
nearly 2000 years.
In the sixteenth century, modern science began to emerge. A greater emphasis on 
observation led Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543) to publish On the Revolution of the 
Heavenly Orbs in 1543. The publication of that book—which proposed that the sun, not 
Earth, is at the center of the universe—marks the beginning of what we now call the 
scientific revolution. The next 200 years—and the work of scientists such as Francis Bacon 
(1561–1626), Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), Galileo Galilei (1564–1642), Robert Boyle 
(1627–1691), and Isaac Newton (1642–1727)—brought rapid advancement as the scien-
tific approach became the established way to learn about the physical world. By the 
early 1800s, certain observations led the English chemist John Dalton (1766–1844) to 
offer convincing evidence that supported the early atomic ideas of Leucippus and 
­Democritus. However, debate continued about whether atoms actually exist until the 
description of Brownian motion by Einstein in 1905 and subsequent experimental veri-
fication of the description in 1908 by Perrin (see Section 2.1).
	 2.3	
Modern Atomic Theory and the Laws 
That Led to It
Recall the discussion of the scientific approach to knowledge from Chapter 1. The atomic 
theory (the idea that all matter is composed of atoms) grew out of observations and 
laws. The three most important laws that led to the development and acceptance of the 
atomic theory are the law of conservation of mass, the law of definite proportions, and 
the law of multiple proportions.
The Law of Conservation of Mass
In 1789, as we saw in Chapter 1, Antoine Lavoisier formulated the law of conserva-
tion of mass, which states:
In a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed.
In other words, when a chemical reaction occurs, the total mass of the substances 
involved in the reaction does not change. For example, consider the reaction between 
sodium and chlorine to form sodium chloride. The combined mass of the sodium and 
chlorine that react (the reactants) exactly equals the mass of the sodium chloride that 
forms (the product). This law is consistent with the idea that matter is composed of small, 
indestructible particles. The particles rearrange during a chemical reaction, but the 
amount of matter is conserved because the particles themselves are indestructible (at 
least by chemical means).
We will see in Chapter 20 that the 
law of conservation of mass is a 
slight oversimplification. However, the 
changes in mass in ordinary chemical 
processes are so minute that they 
can be ignored for all practical 
purposes.

The Law of Conservation of Mass  When a log completely burns in a 
campfire, the mass of the ash is much less than the mass of the log. What happens to 
the matter that composed the log?
The Law of Definite Proportions
In 1797, the French chemist Joseph Proust (1754–1826) made observations on the com-
position of compounds. He found that the elements composing a given compound 
always occur in fixed (or definite) proportions in all samples of the compound. In con-
trast, the components of a mixture can be present in any proportions whatsoever. Proust 
summarized his observations in the law of definite proportions:
All samples of a given compound, regardless of their source or how 
they were prepared, have the same proportions of their constituent 
elements.
For example, the decomposition of 18.0 g of water results in 16.0 g of oxygen and  
2.0 g of hydrogen, or an oxygen-to-hydrogen mass ratio of:
Mass ratio =  
16.0 g O
2.0 g H  =  8.0 or 8:1
This ratio holds for any sample of pure water, regardless of its origin. The law of definite 
proportions applies to every compound. Consider ammonia, a compound composed of 
nitrogen and hydrogen. Ammonia contains 14.0 g of nitrogen for every 3.0 g of hydro-
gen, resulting in a nitrogen-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 4.7.
Mass ratio =  
14.0 g N
3.0 g H =  4.7 or 4.7:1
The law of definite proportions is 
sometimes called the law of constant 
composition.

	
2.3  Modern Atomic Theory and the Laws That Led to It	
49
Again, this ratio is the same for every sample of ammonia. The law of definite pro-
portions also hints at the idea that matter is composed of atoms. Compounds have defi-
nite proportions of their constituent elements because the atoms that compose them, 
each with its own specific mass, occur in a definite ratio. Since the ratio of atoms is the 
same for all samples of a particular compound, the ratio of masses is also the same.
Answers to For Practice and For More 
Practice Problems can be found in 
Appendix IV.
Two samples of carbon dioxide are decomposed into their constituent elements. 
One sample produces 25.6 g of oxygen and 9.60 g of carbon, and the other 
produces 21.6 g of oxygen and 8.10 g of carbon. Show that these results are 
consistent with the law of definite proportions.
Solution
To show this, for both samples calcu-
late the mass ratio of one element to 
the other by dividing the mass of one 
element by the mass of the other. For 
convenience, divide the larger mass by 
the smaller one.
For the first sample:
Mass oxygen
Mass carbon = 25.6
9.60 = 2.67 or 2.67:1
For the second sample:
Mass oxygen
Mass carbon = 21.6
8.10 = 2.67 or 2.67:1
The ratios are the same for the two samples, so these results are consistent with 
the law of definite proportions.
For Practice 2.1  Two samples of carbon monoxide are decomposed into their 
constituent elements. One sample produces 17.2 g of oxygen and 12.9 g of carbon, 
and the other sample produces 10.5 g of oxygen and 7.88 g of carbon. Show that 
these results are consistent with the law of definite proportions.
Example 2.1	
Law of Definite Proportions
The Law of Multiple Proportions
In 1804, John Dalton published his law of multiple proportions:
When two elements (call them A and B) form two different com-
pounds, the masses of element B that combine with 1 g of element  
A can be expressed as a ratio of small whole numbers.
Dalton suspected that matter was composed of atoms, so that when two elements A and 
B combine to form more than one compound, an atom of A combines with either one, 
two, three, or more atoms of B (AB1, AB2, AB3, etc.). Therefore, the 
masses of B that react with a fixed mass of A are always related to 
one another as small whole-number ratios. Consider the com-
pounds carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide 
and carbon dioxide are two compounds composed of the same 
two elements: carbon and oxygen. We saw in Example 2.1 that 
the mass ratio of oxygen to carbon in carbon dioxide is 2.67:1; 
therefore, 2.67 g of oxygen reacts with 1 g of carbon. In carbon 
monoxide, however, the mass ratio of oxygen to carbon is 1.33:1, 
or 1.33 g of oxygen to every 1 g of carbon.
The ratio of these two masses is itself a small whole number.
Mass oxygen to 1 g carbon in carbon dioxide
Mass oxygen to 1 g carbon in carbon monoxide = 2.67
1.33 = 2
With the help of the molecular models in the margin, we can see why the ratio is 
2:1—carbon dioxide contains two oxygen atoms to every carbon atom, while carbon 
monoxide contains only one. Of course, neither John Dalton nor Joseph Proust had 
access to any kind of modern instrumentation that could detect individual atoms—­
Dalton supported his atomic ideas primarily by using the masses of samples.
Mass oxygen that combines
with 1 g carbon = 2.67 g
Mass oxygen that combines
with 1 g carbon = 1.33 g

Law of Multiple Proportions
Nitrogen forms several compounds with oxygen, including nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen monoxide. Nitrogen dioxide 
contains 2.28 g oxygen to every 1.00 g nitrogen, while dinitrogen monoxide contains 0.570 g oxygen to every 1.00 g 
nitrogen. Show that these results are consistent with the law of multiple proportions.
Solution
Calculate the ratio of the mass of oxygen from 
one compound to the mass of oxygen in the 
other. Always divide the larger of the two 
masses by the smaller one.
Mass oxygen to 1 g nitrogen in nitrogen dioxide
Mass oxygen to 1 g nitrogen in dinitrogen monoxide = 2.28
0.570 = 4.00
The ratio is a small whole number (4); these results are consistent with the law of multiple proportions.
For Practice 2.2  Hydrogen and oxygen form both water and hydrogen peroxide. The decomposition of a sample  
of water forms 0.125 g hydrogen to every 1.00 g oxygen. The decomposition of a sample of hydrogen peroxide forms  
0.0625 g hydrogen to every 1.00 g oxygen. Show that these results are consistent with the law of multiple proportions.
Chemistry IN YOUR DAY | Atoms and Humans
Y
ou and I are composed of atoms. We get those atoms 
from the food we eat. Yesterday’s cheeseburger contrib-
utes to today’s skin, muscle, and hair. Not only are we made 
of atoms, but we are made of recycled atoms. The carbon 
atoms that compose our bodies were used by other living 
organisms before we got them. And they will be used by still 
others when we are done with them. In fact, it is likely that 
at this moment, your body contains some (over one trillion*) 
carbon atoms that were at one time part of your chemistry 
professor.
The idea that humans are composed of atoms acting in 
accord with the laws of chemistry and physics has significant 
implications and raises important questions. If atoms com-
pose our brains, for example, do those atoms determine our 
thoughts and emotions? Are our feelings caused by atoms 
acting according to the laws of chemistry and physics?
Richard Feynman (1918–1988), a Nobel Prize–winning 
physicist, said that “The most important hypothesis in all of 
biology is that everything that animals do, atoms do. In other 
words, there is nothing that living things do that cannot be 
understood from the point of view that they are made of at-
oms acting according to the laws of physics.” Indeed, biology 
has undergone a revolution in the last 50 years, mostly 
through investigation of the atomic and molecular basis for 
life. Some people have seen the atomic view of life as a de-
valuation of human life. We have always wanted to distin-
guish ourselves from everything else, and the idea that we 
are made of the same basic particles as all other matter 
takes something away from that distinction . . . or does it?
Q u e s t i o n s
Do you find the idea that you are made of recycled atoms 
disturbing? Why or why not? Reductionism is the idea that 
complex systems can be understood by understanding their 
parts. Is reductionism a good way to understand humans?  
Is it the only way?
*This calculation assumes that all of the carbon atoms metabolized by 
your professor over the last 40 years have been uniformly distributed into 
atmospheric carbon dioxide, and subsequently incorporated into the 
plants you have eaten.
John Dalton and the Atomic Theory
In 1808, John Dalton explained the laws we just discussed with his atomic theory:
1.	 Each element is composed of tiny, indestructible particles called atoms.
2.	 All atoms of a given element have the same mass and other properties that distin-
guish them from the atoms of other elements.
3.	 Atoms combine in simple, whole-number ratios to form compounds.
4.	 Atoms of one element cannot change into atoms of another element. In a chemical 
reaction, atoms only change the way they are bound together with other atoms.
Today, the evidence for the atomic theory is overwhelming. Matter is indeed composed 
of atoms.
In Section 2.6, we will see that, 
contrary to Dalton’s theory, all atoms 
of a given element do not have exactly 
the same mass.

	 2.4	
The Discovery of the Electron
By the end of the nineteenth century, scientists were convinced that matter is made 
up of atoms, the permanent, supposedly indestructible building blocks that com-
pose everything. However, further experiments revealed that the atom itself is com-
posed of even smaller, more fundamental particles.
Cathode Rays
In the late 1800s, an English physicist named J. J. Thomson (1856–1940), working at 
Cambridge University, performed experiments to probe the properties of ­cathode 
rays. Thomson constructed a partially evacuated glass tube called a cathode 
ray tube, shown in Figure 2.2▼. Thomson then applied a high electrical voltage 
between two electrodes at either end of the tube. He found that a beam of particles, 
called cathode rays, traveled from the negatively charged electrode (which is called 
the cathode) to the positively charged one (which is called the anode).
Thomson found that the particles that compose the cathode ray have the follow-
ing properties: they travel in straight lines; they are independent of the composition of 
the material from which they originate (the cathode); and they carry a negative 
­electrical charge. Electrical charge is a fundamental property of some of the particles 
that compose atoms and results in attractive and repulsive forces—called electrostatic 
forces—between those particles. The area around a charged particle where these forces 
exist is called an electric field. The characteristics of electrical charge are summarized in 
the figure in the margin. You have probably experienced excess electrical charge when 
brushing your hair on a dry day. The brushing action causes the accumulation of charged 
particles in your hair, which repel each other, making your hair stand on end.

charge.
J. J. Thomson measured the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles by 
deflecting them using electric and magnetic fields, as shown in Figure 2.3▶, on the next 
page. The value he measured, -1.76 * 108 coulombs (C) per gram, implied that the 
cathode ray particle was about 2000 times lighter (less massive) than hydrogen, the 
lightest known atom. These results were revolutionary—the indestructible atom could 
apparently be chipped!
J. J. Thomson had discovered the electron, a negatively charged, low-mass particle 
present within all atoms. He wrote, “We have in the cathode rays matter in a new state, a 
state in which the subdivision of matter is carried very much further . . . a state in which 
all matter . . . is of one and the same kind; this matter being the substance from which all 
the chemical elements are built up.”

the effects of the two fields (electric 
and magnetic) cancel exactly, leaving 
the beam undeflected, he was able 
to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio 
of the electron.
Millikan’s Oil Drop Experiment:  
The Charge of the Electron
In 1909, American physicist Robert Millikan (1868–1953), working at the University 
of Chicago, performed his now famous oil drop experiment in which he deduced the 
charge of a single electron. The apparatus for the oil drop experiment is shown in 
Figure 2.4▼.
In his experiment, Millikan sprayed oil into fine droplets using an atomizer. The 
droplets were allowed to fall under the influence of gravity through a small hole into the 
lower portion of the apparatus where Millikan viewed them with the aid of a light source 
and a viewing microscope. During their fall, the drops acquired electrons Millikan had 
produced by bombarding the air in the chamber with ionizing radiation (a kind of 
energy described in Chapter 7). The electrons imparted a negative charge to the drops. 
In the lower portion of the apparatus, Millikan could create an electric field between two 
metal plates. Since the lower plate was negatively charged, and since Millikan could vary 
the strength of the electric field, he could slow or even reverse the free fall of the nega-
tively charged drops. (Remember that like charges repel each other.)
By measuring the strength of the electric field required to halt the free fall of the 
drops, and by figuring out the masses of the drops themselves (determined from their 
radii and density), Millikan calculated the charge of each drop. He then reasoned that, 
since each drop must contain an integral (or whole) number of electrons, the charge of 
each drop must be a whole-number multiple of the electron’s charge. Indeed, Millikan 
was correct; the measured charge on any drop is always a whole-number multiple of 
-1.60 * 10 - 19 C, the fundamental charge of a single electron.

2.5  The Structure of the Atom	
53
With this number in hand, and knowing Thomson’s mass-to-charge ratio for elec-
trons, we can deduce the mass of an electron:
 Charge *
mass
charge = mass
 -1.60 * 10 - 19 C *
g
-1.76 * 108 C
= 9.10 * 10 - 28 g
As Thomson had correctly determined, this mass is about 2000 times lighter than hydro-
gen, the lightest atom.
Why did scientists work so hard to measure the charge of the electron? Since the 
electron is a fundamental building block of matter, scientists want to know its proper-
ties, including its charge. The magnitude of the charge of the electron is of tremendous 
importance because it determines how strongly an atom holds its electrons. Imagine 
how matter would be different if electrons had a much smaller charge, so that atoms 
held them more loosely. Many atoms might not even be stable. On the other hand, 
imagine how matter would be different if electrons had a much greater charge, so that 
atoms held them more tightly. Since atoms form compounds by exchanging and shar-
ing electrons (more on this in Chapter 3), there could be fewer compounds or maybe 
even none. Without the abundant diversity of compounds, life would not be possible. 
So, the magnitude of the charge of the electron—even though it may seem like an insig-
nificantly small number—has great importance.

The Structure of the Atom
The discovery of negatively charged particles within atoms raised a new question. Since 
atoms are charge-neutral, they must contain a positive charge that neutralizes the nega-
tive charge of the electrons—but how do the positive and negative charges fit together? 
Are atoms just a jumble of even more fundamental particles? Are they solid spheres? Do 
they have some internal structure? J. J. Thomson proposed that the negatively charged 
electrons were small particles held within a positively charged sphere.
This model, the most popular of the time, became known as the plum-pudding 
model (shown at right). The model suggested by Thomson, to those of us not familiar 
with plum pudding (an English dessert), was like a blueberry muffin; the blueberries are 
the electrons, and the muffin is the positively charged sphere.
The discovery of radioactivity—the emission of small energetic particles from 
the core of certain unstable atoms—by scientists Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) and Marie 
Curie (1867–1934) at the end of the nineteenth century allowed researchers to experi-
mentally probe the structure of the atom. At the time, scientists had identified three dif-
ferent types of radioactivity: alpha (a) particles, beta (b) particles, and gamma (g) rays. 
We will discuss these and other types of radioactivity in more detail in Chapter 20. For 
now, just know that a particles are positively charged and that they are by far the most 
massive of the three.
In 1909, Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937), who had worked under Thomson and sub-
scribed to his plum-pudding model, performed an experiment in an attempt to confirm 
Thomson’s model. Rutherford’s experiment, which employed a particles, proved 
Thomson wrong instead. In the experiment, Rutherford directed the positively charged 
a particles at an ultrathin sheet of gold foil, as shown in Figure 2.5▶, on the next page.
These particles were to act as probes of the gold atoms’ structure. If the gold atoms 
were indeed like blueberry muffins or plum pudding—with their mass and charge spread 
throughout the entire volume of the atom—Rutherford reasoned that these speeding 
probes would pass right through the gold foil with minimum deflection.

with little or no deﬂection.
▶ Figure 2.5  Rutherford’s Gold 
Foil Experiment  Alpha particles are 
directed at a thin sheet of gold foil. 
Most of the particles pass through 
the foil, but a small fraction are 
deflected, and a few even bounce 
backward.
Rutherford and his coworkers performed the experiment, but the results were not 
what they expected. The majority of the particles did pass directly through the foil, but 
some particles were deflected, and some (approximately 1 in 20,000) even bounced 
back. The results puzzled Rutherford, who wrote that they were “about as credible as if 
you had fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.” 
What sort of atomic structure could explain this odd behavior? Rutherford created a new 
model—a modern version of which is shown in Figure 2.6▼ alongside the plum-pudding 
model—to explain his results.
Rutherford realized that to account for the deflections he observed, the mass and 
positive charge of an atom must be concentrated in a space much smaller than the size 
of the atom itself. He concluded that, in contrast to the plum-pudding model, matter 
must not be as uniform as it appears. It must contain large regions of empty space dotted 
with small regions of very dense matter. Building on this idea, he proposed the nuclear 
theory of the atom, with three basic parts:
1.	 Most of the atom’s mass and all of its positive charge are contained in a small core 
called the nucleus.
2.	 Most of the volume of the atom is empty space, throughout which tiny, negatively 
charged electrons are dispersed.
3.	 There are as many negatively charged electrons outside the nucleus as there are 
positively charged particles (named protons) within the nucleus, so the atom is 
electrically neutral.

Although Rutherford’s model was highly successful, scientists realized that it was 
incomplete. For example, hydrogen atoms contain one proton, and helium atoms con-
tain two, yet a hydrogen atom has only one-fourth the mass of a helium atom. Why? 
The helium atom must contain some additional mass. Later work by Rutherford and one 
of his students, British scientist James Chadwick (1891–1974), demonstrated that the 
previously unaccounted for mass was due to neutrons, neutral particles within the 
nucleus. The mass of a neutron is similar to that of a proton, but a neutron has no elec-
trical charge. The helium atom is four times as massive as the hydrogen atom because its 
nucleus contains two protons and two neutrons (while hydrogen contains only one pro-
ton and no neutrons).
The dense nucleus contains over 99.9% of the mass of the atom but occupies very 
little of its volume. For now, we can think of the electrons that surround the nucleus in 
analogy to the water droplets that make up a cloud—although their mass is almost neg-
ligibly small, they are dispersed over a very large volume. Consequently, an atom, like a 
cloud, is mostly empty space.
Rutherford’s nuclear theory was a success and is still valid today. The revolutionary 
part of this theory is the idea that matter—at its core—is much less uniform than it 
appears. If the nucleus of the atom were the size of the period at the end of this sentence, 
the average electron would be about 10 meters away. Yet the period would contain nearly 
all of the atom’s mass. Imagine what matter would be like if atomic structure were differ-
ent. What if matter were composed of atomic nuclei piled on top of each other like mar-
bles in a box? Such matter would be incredibly dense; a single grain of sand composed of 
solid atomic nuclei would have a mass of 5 million kilograms (or a weight of about  
11 million pounds). Astronomers believe there are some objects in the universe com-
posed of such matter—neutron stars.
If matter really is mostly empty space, as Rutherford suggested, then why does it 
appear so solid? Why can we tap our knuckles on a table and feel a solid thump? Matter 
appears solid because the variation in its density is on such a small scale that our eyes 
cannot see it. Imagine a scaffolding 100 stories high and the size of a football field as 
shown in the margin. The volume of the scaffolding is mostly empty space. Yet if you 
viewed it from an airplane, it would appear as a solid mass. Matter is similar. When you 
tap your knuckle on the table, it is much like one giant scaffolding (your finger) crashing 
into another (the table). Even though they are both primarily empty space, one does not 
fall into the other.

Subatomic Particles: Protons, 
Neutrons, and Electrons in Atoms
All atoms are composed of the same subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and 
electrons. Protons and neutrons, as we discussed earlier, have nearly identical 
masses. In SI units, the mass of the proton is 1.67262 * 10 - 27 kg, and the mass of 
the neutron is 1.67493 * 10 - 27 kg. A more common unit to express these masses is 
the atomic mass unit (amu), defined as 1/12 the mass of a carbon atom that con-
tains six ­protons and six neutrons. The mass of a proton or neutron is approximately  
1 amu. Electrons, by contrast, have an almost negligible mass of 0.00091 * 10 - 27 kg 
or 0.00055 amu.
The proton and the electron both have electrical charge. We know from Millikan’s 
oil drop experiment that the electron has a charge of -1.60 * 10 - 19 C. In atomic (or 
relative) units, the electron is assigned a charge of -1 and the proton is assigned a 
charge of +1. The charge of the proton and the charge of the electron are equal in magnitude 
but opposite in sign, so that when the two particles are paired, the charges sum to zero. 
The neutron has no charge.
Matter is usually charge-neutral (it has no overall charge) because protons and elec-
trons are normally present in equal numbers. When matter does acquire charge imbal-
ances, these imbalances usually equalize quickly, often in dramatic ways. For example, 
the shock you receive when touching a doorknob during dry weather is the equalization 
If a proton had the mass of a
baseball, an electron would have
the mass of a rice grain.

Elements: Defined by Their Numbers of Protons
If all atoms are composed of the same subatomic particles, what makes the atoms of 
one element different from those of another? The answer is the number of these par-
ticles. The most important number to the identity of an atom is the number of protons 
in its nucleus. The number of protons defines the element. For example, an atom with two 
protons in its nucleus is a helium atom, an atom with six protons in its nucleus is a car-
bon atom (Figure 2.7▼), and an atom with 92 protons in its nucleus is a uranium atom. 
The number of protons in an atom’s nucleus is its atomic number and is given the 
symbol Z. The atomic numbers of known elements range from 1 to 116 (although evi-
dence for the synthesis of additional elements is currently being considered), as shown 
in the periodic table of the elements (Figure 2.8▶). In the periodic table, described in 
more detail in Section 2.7, the elements are arranged so that those with similar proper-
ties are in the same column.
Each element, identified by its unique atomic number, is represented with a unique 
chemical symbol, a one- or two-letter abbreviation listed directly below its atomic 
number on the periodic table. The chemical symbol for helium is He; for carbon, the 
symbol is C; and for uranium, it is U. The chemical symbol and the atomic number 
always go together. If the atomic number is 2, the chemical symbol must be He. If the 
atomic number is 6, the chemical symbol must be C. This is another way of saying that 
the number of protons defines the element.
of a charge imbalance that developed as you walked across the carpet. Lightning is an 
equalization of charge imbalances that develop during electrical storms.
A sample of matter—even a tiny sample, such as a sand grain—composed of only 
protons or only electrons, would have extraordinary repulsive forces inherent within it 
and would be unstable. Luckily, matter is not that way. Table 2.1 summarizes the proper-
ties of protons, neutrons, and electrons.
Negative charge builds up on clouds.
Positive charge builds up on ground.

The Periodic Table
▲ Figure 2.8  The Periodic Table  Each element is represented by its symbol and atomic 
number. Elements in the same column have similar properties.
Most chemical symbols are based on the English name of the element. For exam-
ple, the symbol for sulfur is S; for oxygen, O; and for chlorine, Cl. Several of the old-
est known elements, however, have symbols based on their original Latin names. For 
example, the symbol for sodium is Na from the Latin natrium, and the symbol for tin 
is Sn from the Latin stannum. Early scientists often gave newly discovered elements 
names that reflect their properties. For example, argon originates from the Greek 
word argos meaning inactive, referring to argon’s chemical inertness (it does not 
react with other elements). Chlorine originates from the Greek word chloros mean-
ing pale green, referring to chlorine’s pale green color. Other elements, including 
helium, selenium, and mercury, are named after figures from Greek or Roman 
mythology or astronomical bodies. Still others (such as europium, polonium, and 
berkelium) are named for the places where they were discovered or where their dis-
coverers were born. More recently, elements have been named after scientists; for 
example, curium for Marie Curie, einsteinium for Albert Einstein, and rutherford-
ium for Ernest Rutherford.
Isotopes: When the Number of Neutrons Varies
All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons; however, they do not 
necessarily have the same number of neutrons. Since neutrons have nearly the same 
mass as protons (1 amu), this means that—contrary to what John Dalton originally 
proposed in his atomic theory—all atoms of a given element do not have the same 
mass. For example, all neon atoms contain 10 protons, but they may contain 10, 11, 
or 12 neutrons. All three types of neon atoms exist, and each has a slightly different 
mass. Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are

isotopes. Some elements, such as beryllium (Be) and aluminum (Al), have only one 
naturally occurring isotope, while other elements, such as neon (Ne) and chlorine 
(Cl), have two or more.
The relative amount of each different isotope in a naturally occurring sample of a 
given element is roughly constant. For example, in any natural sample of neon atoms, 
90.48% of them are the isotope with 10 neutrons, 0.27% are the isotope with 11 neu-
trons, and 9.25% are the isotope with 12 neutrons. These percentages are the natural 
abundance of the isotopes. Each element has its own characteristic natural abundance 
of isotopes. However, advances in mass spectrometry (see Section 2.8) have allowed 
accurate measurements that reveal small but significant variations in the natural abun-
dance of isotopes for many elements.
The sum of the number of neutrons and protons in an atom is its mass number. 
We represent mass number with the symbol A.
A = number of protons (p) + number of neutrons (n)
For neon, with 10 protons, the mass numbers of the three different naturally occurring 
isotopes are 20, 21, and 22, corresponding to 10, 11, and 12 neutrons, respectively.
We symbolize isotopes using the notation:
X
A
Z
Mass number
Atomic number
Chemical symbol
where X is the chemical symbol, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number. 
Therefore, the symbols for the neon isotopes are:
20
10Ne 21
10Ne 22
10Ne
Notice that the chemical symbol, Ne, and the atomic number, 10, are redundant: if the 
atomic number is 10, the symbol must be Ne. The mass numbers, however, are different 
for the different isotopes, reflecting the different number of neutrons in each one.
A second common notation for isotopes is the chemical symbol (or chemical name) 
followed by a dash and the mass number of the isotope.
X-A
Mass number
Chemical symbol
or name
In this notation, the neon isotopes are:
Ne@20

We summarize the neon isotopes in the following table:

Notice that all isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons (other-
wise they would be different elements). Notice also that the mass number is the sum of 
the number of protons and the number of neutrons. The number of neutrons in an iso-
tope is therefore the difference between the mass number and the atomic number (A–Z). 
The different isotopes of an element generally exhibit the same chemical behavior—the 
three isotopes of neon, for example, all exhibit chemical inertness.

(a)	 What are the atomic number (Z), mass number (A), and symbol of the chlorine isotope with 18 neutrons?
(b)	 How many protons, electrons, and neutrons are present in an atom of 52

Solution
(a)	 Look up the atomic number (Z) for chlorine on the periodic table. 
The atomic number specifies the number of protons.
The mass number (A) for an isotope is the sum of the number of 
protons and the number of neutrons.
The symbol for an isotope is its chemical symbol with the atomic 
number (Z) in the lower left corner and the mass number (A) in 
the upper left corner.
Z = 17, so chlorine has 17 protons.
 A = number of protons + number of neutrons
 = 17 + 18 = 35

17Cl
(b)	 For any isotope (in this case 52
24Cr) the atomic number located at 
the lower left indicates the number of protons. Since this is a neu-
tral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons.
The number of neutrons is equal to the mass number (upper left) 
minus the atomic number (lower left).
Number of protons = Z = 24
Number of electrons = 24 (neutral atom)
Number of neutrons = 52 - 24 = 28

Isotopes  Carbon has two naturally occurring isotopes: C-12 (natural abundance is 
98.93%) and C-13 (natural abundance is 1.07%). Using circles to represent protons and 
squares to represent neutrons, draw the nucleus of each isotope. How many C-13 atoms 
are present, on average, in a 10,000-atom sample of carbon?
Ions: Losing and Gaining Electrons
The number of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons in its 
nucleus (designated by its atomic number Z). During chemical changes, however, atoms 
can lose or gain electrons and become charged particles called ions. For example, neu-
tral lithium (Li) atoms contain three protons and three electrons; however, in many 
chemical reactions lithium atoms lose one electron (e -) to form Li + ions.
Li ¡ Li + + 1 e -
The charge of an ion is indicated in the upper right corner of the chemical symbol. Since 
the Li+ ion contains three protons and only two electrons, its charge is 1+ (ion charges 
are written as the magnitude first followed by the sign of the charge; for a charge of 1+, 
the 1 is usually dropped and the charge is written as simply +).
Ions can also be negatively charged. For example, neutral fluorine (F) atoms contain 
nine protons and nine electrons; however, in many chemical reactions fluorine atoms 
gain one electron to form F - ions.
F + 1e - ¡ F -
The F - ion contains nine protons and 10 electrons, resulting in a charge of 1- (written 
simply as –). For many elements, such as lithium and fluorine, the ion is much more com-
mon than the neutral atom. In fact, lithium and fluorine occur in nature mostly as ions.
Positively charged ions, such as Li +, are cations, and negatively charged ions, 
such as F -, are anions. Ions behave quite differently than their corresponding atoms. 
Neutral sodium atoms, for example, are extremely unstable, reacting violently with

Chemistry IN YOUR DAY | Where Did Elements Come From?
W
e find ourselves on a planet containing many different kinds of ele-
ments. If it were otherwise, we would not exist and would not be here 
to reflect on why. Where did these elements come from? The story of element 
formation is as old as the universe itself, and we have to go back to the very 
beginning to tell the story.
The birth of the universe is described by the Big Bang theory, which as-
serts that the universe began as a hot, dense collection of matter and en-
ergy that expanded rapidly. As it expanded, it cooled, and within the first 
several hours, subatomic particles formed the first atomic nuclei: hydrogen 
and helium. These two elements were (and continue to be) the most abun-
dant in the universe. As the universe continued expanding, some of the hy-
drogen and helium clumped together under the influence of gravity to form 
nebulae (clouds of gas) that eventually gave birth to stars and galaxies. 
These stars and galaxies became the nurseries where all other ­elements 
formed.
Stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, which we will discuss in more detail in 
Chapter 20. Under the conditions within the core of a star, hydrogen nuclei can 
combine (or fuse) to form helium. Fusion gives off enormous quantities of en-
ergy, which is why stars emit so much heat and light. The fusion of hydrogen to 
helium can fuel a star for billions of years.
After it burns through large quantities of hydrogen, if a star is large 
enough, the helium that builds up in its core can in turn fuse to form carbon. 
The carbon then builds up in the core and (again, if the star is large enough) 
can fuse to form even heavier elements. The fusion process ends with iron, 
which has a highly stable nucleus. By the time iron is formed, however, the 
star is near the end of its existence and may enter a phase of expansion, 
transforming into a supernova. Within a supernova, which is in essence a 
large exploding star, a shower of neutrons allows the lighter elements (which 
formed during the lifetime of the star through the fusion processes just de-
scribed) to capture extra neutrons. These neutrons can transform into protons 
(through processes that we discuss in Chapter 20), contributing ultimately to 
the formation of elements heavier than iron, all the way up to uranium. As the 
supernova continues to expand, the elements present within it are blown out 
into space, where they can incorporate into other nebulae and perhaps even 
eventually form planets that orbit stars like our own sun.

Eagle Nebula (also known as M16). This 
image was taken by the Hubble Space 
Telescope and shows a gaseous pillar in a

most things they contact. Sodium cations (Na +), by contrast, are relatively inert—we 
eat them all the time in sodium chloride (table salt). In ordinary matter, cations and 
anions always occur together so that matter is charge neutral overall.

Finding Patterns: The Periodic Law and 
the Periodic Table
The modern periodic table grew out of the work of Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907), 
a nineteenth-century Russian chemistry professor. In his time, scientists had 
­discovered about 65 different elements, and chemists had identified many of the

Mendeleev organized the known elements in a table consisting of a series of rows 
in which mass increases from left to right. He arranged the rows so that elements 
with similar properties fall in the same vertical columns (Figure 2.10▶).
Since many elements had not yet been discovered, Mendeleev’s table con-
tained some gaps, which allowed him to predict the existence (and even the 
properties) of yet undiscovered elements. For example, Mendeleev predicted the 
existence of an element he called eka-silicon, which fell below silicon on the 
table and between gallium and arsenic (eka means the one beyond). In 1886, eka-
silicon was discovered by German chemist Clemens Winkler (1838–1904), who 
named it germanium, after his home country.

properties of these elements—such as their relative masses, their chemical activity, 
and some of their physical properties. However, no one had developed any system-
atic way of organizing them.
In 1869, Mendeleev noticed that certain groups of elements had similar properties. 
He also found that when he listed elements in order of increasing mass, these similar 
properties recurred in a periodic pattern (Figure 2.9▼). Mendeleev summarized these 
observations in the periodic law:
When the elements are arranged in order of increasing mass,  
certain sets of properties recur periodically.

Chapter 2  Atoms and Elements
Modern Periodic Table Organization
Mendeleev’s original listing evolved into the modern periodic table shown in  
Figure 2.11▼. In the modern table, elements are listed in order of increasing atomic 
number rather than increasing relative mass. The modern periodic table also contains 
more elements than Mendeleev’s original table because more have been discovered 
since his time. Mendeleev’s periodic law was based on observation. Like all scientific 
laws, the periodic law summarizes many observations but does not give the underlying 
reason for the observations—only theories do that. For now, we accept the periodic law 
as it is, but in Chapters 7 and 8 we will examine a powerful theory—called quantum 
mechanics—that explains the law and gives the underlying reasons for it.
We can broadly classify the elements in the periodic table as metals, nonmetals, 
or metalloids, as shown in Figure 2.11. Metals lie on the lower left side and middle of 
the periodic table and share some common properties: they are good conductors of 
heat and electricity, they can be pounded into flat sheets (malleability), they can be 
drawn into wires (ductility), they are often shiny, and they tend to lose electrons 
when they undergo chemical changes. Chromium, copper, strontium, and lead are 
typical metals.
Nonmetals lie on the upper right side of the periodic table. The dividing line 
between metals and nonmetals is the zigzag diagonal line running from boron to asta-
tine. Nonmetals have varied properties—some are solids at room temperature, others 
are liquids or gases—but typically they tend to be poor conductors of heat and electric-
ity, and they all tend to gain electrons when they undergo chemical changes. Oxygen, 
carbon, sulfur, bromine, and iodine are nonmetals.

▲ Figure 2.12  The Periodic Table: Main-Group and Transition Elements  The elements 
in the periodic table fall into columns. The two columns at the left and the six columns at the 
right comprise the main-group elements. Each of these eight columns is a group or family. 
The properties of main-group elements can generally be predicted from their position in the 
periodic table. The properties of the elements in the middle of the table, known as transition 
elements, are less predictable.
Many of the elements that lie along the zigzag diagonal line that divides metals and 
nonmetals are metalloids and exhibit mixed properties. Several metalloids are also 
classified as semiconductors because of their intermediate (and highly temperature-
dependent) electrical conductivity. Our ability to change and control the conductivity 
of semiconductors makes them useful to us in the manufacture of the electronic chips 
and circuits central to computers, cellular telephones, and many other modern devices. 
Good examples of metalloids are silicon, arsenic, and antimony.
We can also divide the periodic table, as shown in Figure 2.12▲, into main-
group elements, whose properties tend to be largely predictable based on their 
position in the periodic table, and transition elements or transition metals, 
whose properties tend to be less predictable based simply on their position in the 
periodic table. Main-group elements are in columns labeled with a number and the 
letter A. Transition elements are in columns labeled with a number and the letter B. 
An alternative numbering system does not use letters, but only the numbers 1–18. 
Both numbering systems are shown in most of the periodic tables in this book. 
Each column within the main-group regions of the periodic table is a family or 
group of elements.
The elements within a group usually have similar properties. For example, the 
group 8A elements, called the noble gases, are mostly unreactive. The most familiar 
noble gas is probably helium, used to fill buoyant balloons. Helium is chemically sta-
ble—it does not combine with other elements to form compounds—and is therefore 
safe to put into balloons. Other noble gases are neon (often used in electronic signs), 
argon (a small component of our atmosphere), krypton, and xenon.
The group 1A elements, the alkali metals, are all reactive metals. A marble-sized 
piece of sodium explodes violently when dropped into water. Lithium, potassium, 
and rubidium are also alkali metals.
The group 2A elements, the alkaline earth metals, are also fairly reactive, 
although not quite as reactive as the alkali metals. Calcium, for example, reacts fairly 
vigorously when dropped into water but does not explode as dramatically as sodium. 
Other alkaline earth metals include magnesium (a common low-density structural 
metal), strontium, and barium.
Metalloids are sometimes called 
semimetals.

Chapter 2  Atoms and Elements
The group 7A elements, the halogens, are very reactive nonmetals. One of the 
most familiar halogens is chlorine, a greenish-yellow gas with a pungent odor. Because 
of its reactivity, chlorine is used as a sterilizing and disinfecting agent. Other halogens 
include bromine, a red-brown liquid that easily evaporates into a gas; iodine, a purple 
solid; and fluorine, a pale-yellow gas.
Ions and the Periodic Table
In chemical reactions, metals tend to lose electrons (forming cations) and nonmetals 
tend to gain them (forming anions). The number of electrons lost or gained, and there-
fore the charge of the resulting ion, is often predictable for a given element, especially 
main-group elements. Main-group elements tend to form ions that have the same num-
ber of electrons as the nearest noble gas (i.e., the noble gas that has the number of elec-
trons closest to that of the element).
• A main-group metal tends to lose electrons, forming a cation with the 
same number of electrons as the nearest noble gas.
• A main-group nonmetal tends to gain electrons, forming an anion with 
the same number of electrons as the nearest noble gas.
For example, lithium, a metal with three electrons, tends to lose one electron, forming a 
1+ cation that has the same number of electrons (two) as helium. Chlorine, a nonmetal 
with 17 electrons, tends to gain one electron, forming a 1- anion that has the same 
number of electrons (18) as argon.
In general, the alkali metals (group 1A) tend to lose one electron and form 1+ ions. 
The alkaline earth metals (group 2A) tend to lose two electrons and form 2+ ions. The 
halogens (group 7A) tend to gain one electron and form 1- ions. The oxygen family 
nonmetals (group 6A) tend to gain two electrons and form 2- ions. More generally, for 
the main-group elements that form cations with predictable charge, the charge is equal 
to the group number. For main-group elements that form anions with predictable 
charge, the charge is equal to the group number minus eight. Transition elements may 
form various different ions with different charges. Figure 2.13▶ shows the ions formed 
by the main-group elements that form ions with predictable charges. In Chapters 7 and 
8, we will introduce quantum-mechanical theory, which more fully explains why these 
groups form ions as they do.

(a)	 Aluminum is a main-group metal and tends to lose electrons to form a cation 
with the same number of electrons as the nearest noble gas. Aluminum 
atoms have 13 electrons and the nearest noble gas is neon, which has  
10 electrons. Aluminum therefore loses three electrons to form a cation with 
a 3+ charge (Al3 +).
(b)	 Sulfur is a nonmetal and tends to gain electrons to form an anion with the 
same number of electrons as the nearest noble gas. Sulfur atoms have  
16 electrons and the nearest noble gas is argon, which has 18 electrons. Sulfur 
therefore gains two electrons to form an anion with a 2- charge (S2 -).

our bodies are 65% oxygen (because of the large 
amount of water), 18% carbon, and 10% hydrogen, with a 
few other elements present in smaller quantities, as shown 
in Figure 2.14▶ and Table 2.2. Because the atoms of dif-
ferent elements have different masses (more on this in 
Sections 2.8 and 2.9), if we consider number of atoms (in-
stead of mass), hydrogen comes in first (because hydrogen 
atoms are so light), with oxygen second and carbon third.

Atomic Mass: The Average Mass  
of an Element’s Atoms
An important part of Dalton’s atomic theory is that all atoms of a given element have 
the same mass. In Section 2.6, we learned that because of isotopes, the atoms of a given 
element often have different masses, so Dalton was not completely correct. We can, 
however, calculate an average mass—called the atomic mass—for each element.
The atomic mass of each element is listed directly beneath the element’s symbol in 
the periodic table and represents the average mass of the isotopes that compose that 
element, weighted according to the natural abundance of each isotope. For example, the 
Atomic mass is sometimes called 
atomic weight or standard atomic 
weight.

66	
Chapter 2  Atoms and Elements
periodic table lists the atomic mass of chlorine as 35.45 amu. Naturally occurring chlo-
rine consists of 75.77% chlorine-35 atoms (mass 34.97 amu) and 24.23% chlorine-37 
atoms (mass 36.97 amu). We can calculate its atomic mass accordingly:
Atomic mass = 0.7577(34.97 amu) + 0.2423(36.97 amu) = 35.45 amu
Notice that the atomic mass of chlorine is closer to 35 than 37. Naturally occurring chlo-
rine contains more chlorine-35 atoms than chlorine-37 atoms, so the weighted average 
mass of chlorine is closer to 35 amu than to 37 amu.
In general, we calculate the atomic mass with the equation:
 Atomic mass = a
n
(fraction of isotope n) * (mass of isotope n)
 = (fraction of isotope 1 * mass of isotope 1)
 + (fraction of isotope 2 * mass of isotope 2)
 + (fraction of isotope 3 * mass of isotope 3) + c
where the fractions of each isotope are the percent natural abundances converted to 
their decimal values. The concept of atomic mass is useful because it allows us to assign a 
characteristic mass to each element, and, as we will see shortly, it allows us to quantify 
the number of atoms in a sample of that element.
17
Cl
35.45
chlorine
In this book, we use the atomic 
masses recommended by IUPAC for 
users needing an atomic mass value 
for an unspecified sample. Detailed 
studies of the atomic masses of 
many samples, however, have shown 
that atomic masses are not constants 
of nature because the exact isotopic 
abundances in any given sample 
depend on the history of the sample 
(see the Chemistry in Your Day box 
later in this section).
When we use percentages in 
calculations, we convert them to their 
decimal value by dividing by 100.
Example 2.5	
Atomic Mass
Copper has two naturally occurring isotopes: Cu-63 with a mass of 62.9291 amu and a natural abundance of 69.17%, and 
Cu-65 with a mass of 64.9278 amu and a natural abundance of 30.83%. Calculate the atomic mass of copper.
Solution
Convert the percent natural abundances into 
decimal form by dividing by 100.
Fraction Cu@63 = 69.17
100
= 0.6917
Fraction Cu@65 = 30.83
100
= 0.3083
Calculate the atomic mass using the equation 
given in the text.
 Atomic mass = 0.6917(62.9296 amu) + 0.3083(64.9278 amu)
 = 43.5284 amu + 20.0172 amu = 63.5456 = 63.55 amu
For Practice 2.5  Magnesium has three naturally occurring isotopes with masses of 23.99 amu, 24.99 amu, and 
25.98 amu and natural abundances of 78.99%, 10.00%, and 11.01%, respectively. Calculate the atomic mass of 
magnesium.
For More Practice 2.5  Gallium has two naturally occurring isotopes: Ga-69 with a mass of 68.9256 amu and a 
natural abundance of 60.11%, and Ga-71. Use the atomic mass of gallium from the periodic table to find the mass of Ga-71.

Connection 2.6 
Atomic Mass  Recall from Conceptual Connection 2.4 that carbon has two natu-
rally occurring isotopes: C-12 (natural abundance is 98.93%; mass is 12.0000 amu) and 
C-13 (natural abundance is 1.07%; mass is 13.0034 amu). Without doing any calcula-
tions, determine which mass is closest to the atomic mass of carbon.

Mass Spectrometry: Measuring the Mass of Atoms 
and Molecules
The masses of atoms and the percent abundances of isotopes of elements are measured 
using mass spectrometry, a technique that separates particles according to their 
mass. In a mass spectrometer, such as the one in Figure 2.15▶, the sample (containing

the atoms whose mass is to be measured) is injected into the instrument and vaporized. 
The vaporized atoms are ionized by an electron beam—the electrons in the beam col-
lide with the atoms, removing electrons and creating positively charged ions. The ions 
are then accelerated into a magnetic field. When ions drift through a magnetic field, 
they experience a force that bends their trajectory. The amount of bending depends 
on the mass of the ions—the trajectories of lighter ions are bent more than those of 
heavier ones.
In the right side of the spectrometer in Figure 2.15, you can see three different paths, 
each corresponding to ions of different mass. Finally, the ions strike a detector and pro-
duce an electrical signal that is recorded. The result is the separation of the ions according 
to their mass, producing a mass spectrum such as the one in Figure 2.16▶. The position of 
each peak on the x-axis indicates the mass of the isotope that was ionized, and the intensity 
(indicated by the height of the peak) indicates the relative abundance of that isotope.
The mass spectrum of an elemental sample can be used to determine the atomic 
mass of that sample of the element. For example, consider the mass spectrum of a natu-
rally occurring sample of silver:
100%
50%
Intensity %
107
Mass (amu)
109
Ag-107 Ag-109
The two peaks correspond to the two isotopes of silver. We can determine the percent 
abundance of each isotope from the intensity of each line. However, the total intensity 
must be normalized—it must be made to equal 100%. We can accomplish this by divid-
ing the intensity of each peak by the total intensity:
 Abundance of Ag@107 =  
100.0%
100.0% + 92.90% * 100% = 51.84%
 Abundance of Ag@109 =  
92.90%
100.0% + 92.90% * 100% = 48.16%
Then we can calculate the atomic mass of silver:
 Ag atomic mass = 0.5184 (106.905 amu) + 0.4816 (108.904 amu)
 = 55.4195 amu + 52.4482 amu = 107.8677 = 107.87 amu
Mass spectrometry can also be used on molecules. Because molecules often 
­fragment (break apart) during ionization, the mass spectrum of a molecule usually

Chemistry IN YOUR DAY | Evolving Atomic Masses
A
t the beginning of 2011, IUPAC (International Union of 
Pure and Applied Chemistry) published a new periodic 
table with atomic masses that looked different from previ-
ous IUPAC periodic tables. For the first time, instead of 
listing a single atomic mass for each element, IUPAC listed 
upper and lower bounds for the atomic masses of several 
elements (see the periodic table in this box). For example, 
previous IUPAC periodic tables reported the atomic mass of 
O (rounded to four significant figures) as 16.00. However, 
the new periodic table reports the atomic mass as [15.99, 
16.00] denoting the upper and lower bounds for the possible 
atomic masses of terrestrial oxygen.
Why did this happen? The changes were necessary be-
cause developments in mass spectrometry have increasingly 
demonstrated that the atomic masses of several elements are 
not constant from one sample to another because the isotopic 
composition is not constant from one sample to another. In 
other words, the isotopic composition of a sample of a given 
element can vary depending on the source of the sample.  
For example, the lower bound for the atomic mass of oxygen 
(15.99 amu) comes from measurements of oxygen from 
Antarctic precipitation, and the upper bound (16.00 amu) 
comes from measurements of oxygen in marine n2o (dinitro-
gen monoxide). Although we have long treated atomic masses 
as constants of nature, they are not, and the new periodic ta-
ble reflects this.
So what do we do if we need an atomic mass for an ele-
ment of unknown or unspecified origin? IUPAC has recom-
mended values that apply to most samples found on Earth. 
The values are rounded so that atomic mass variations in 
samples found on Earth are plus or minus one in the last digit 
(just like accepted significant figure conventions). These val-
ues are adopted throughout all of the periodic tables in this 
book except the one shown below, which displays the upper 
and lower bound for those elements in which variation occurs. 
For further reading see IUPAC. Pure Appl. Chem. 2011, 83(2), 
359–396.
contains many peaks representing the masses of different parts of the molecule, as well 
as a peak representing the mass of the molecule as a whole. The fragments that form 
upon ionization, and therefore the corresponding peaks that appear in the mass spec-
trum, are specific to the molecule, so a mass spectrum is like a molecular fingerprint.

Mass spectroscopy can be used to identify an unknown molecule and to determine 
how much of it is present in a particular sample. For example, mass spectrometry has 
been used to detect organic (carbon-containing) compounds present in meteorites, a 
puzzling observation that some scientists speculate may be evidence of life outside of 
our planet. Most scientists think that the carbon compounds in meteorites probably 
formed in the same way as the first organic molecules on Earth, indicating that the 
formation of organic molecules may be common in the universe.
Since the early 1990s, researchers have also successfully applied mass spectrometry 
to biological molecules, including proteins (the workhorse molecules in cells) and 
nucleic acids (the molecules that carry genetic information). For a long time, these mol-
ecules could not be analyzed by mass spectrometry because they were difficult to vapor-
ize and ionize without being destroyed, but modern techniques have overcome this 
problem. A tumor, for example, can now be instantly analyzed by mass spectrometry to 
determine whether it contains specific proteins associated with cancer.

Molar Mass: Counting Atoms  
by Weighing Them
Shrimp are normally sold by count, which indicates the number of shrimp per pound. 
For example, 41–50 count shrimp means that there are between 41 and 50 shrimp per 
pound. The smaller the count, the larger the shrimp. Big tiger prawns have counts as low 
as 10–15, which means that each shrimp can weigh up to 1/10 of a pound. One advantage 
of categorizing shrimp in this way is that we can count the shrimp by weighing them. 
For example, two pounds of 41–50 count shrimp contains between 82 and 100 shrimp.
A similar (but more precise) concept exists for atoms. Counting atoms is much more 
difficult than counting shrimp, yet as chemists we often need to know the number of atoms 
in a sample of a given mass. Why? Because chemical processes happen between particles. For ele-
ments, those particles are atoms. For example, when hydrogen and oxygen combine to 
form water, two hydrogen atoms combine with one oxygen atom to form one water mole-
cule. If we want to know how much hydrogen to react with a given mass of oxygen to form 
water, we need to know the number of atoms in the given mass of oxygen. We also need to 
know the mass of hydrogen that contains exactly twice that number of atoms.
As another example, consider intravenous fluids—fluids that are delivered to 
patients by directly dripping them into veins. These fluids are saline (sodium chloride) 
solutions that must have a specific number of sodium and chloride ions per liter of fluid. 
The number of particles in the fluid directly influences the properties of the fluid. 
Administering an intravenous fluid with the wrong number of sodium and chloride 
ions could be fatal.
Atoms are far too small to count by any ordinary means. As we noted earlier, even if 
you could somehow count atoms, and counted them 24 hours a day for as long as you 
lived, you would barely begin to count the number of atoms in something as small as a 
sand grain. Therefore, if we want to know the number of atoms in anything of ordinary 
size, we count them by weighing.
The Mole: A Chemist’s “Dozen”
When we count large numbers of objects, we often use units such as a dozen (12 objects) 
or a gross (144 objects) to organize our counting and to keep our numbers more manage-
able. With atoms, quadrillions of which may be in a speck of dust, we need a much larger 
number for this purpose. The chemist’s “dozen” is the mole (abbreviated mol). A mole 
is the amount of material containing 6.02214 * 1023 particles.
1 mol = 6.02214 * 1023 particles
This number is Avogadro’s number, named after Italian physicist Amedeo Avogadro 
(1776–1856), and is a convenient number to use when working with atoms, molecules, 
and ions. In this book, we usually round Avogadro’s number to four significant figures or 
The Mole Concept

Chapter 2  Atoms and Elements
6.022 * 1023. Notice that the definition of the mole is an amount of a substance. We 
often refer to the number of moles of substance as the amount of the substance.
The first thing to understand about the mole is that it can specify Avogadro’s number 
of anything. For example, one mole of marbles corresponds to 6.022 * 1023 marbles, and 
one mole of sand grains corresponds to 6.022 * 1023 sand grains. One mole of anything is 
6.022 * 1023 units of that thing. One mole of atoms, ions, or molecules, however, makes 
up objects of everyday sizes. Twenty-two copper pennies, for example, contain approxi-
mately 1 mol of copper atoms, and 1 tablespoon of water contains approximately 1 mol 
of water molecules.
The second, and more fundamental, thing to understand about the mole is how it 
gets its specific value.
The value of the mole is equal to the number of atoms in exactly 12 g 
of pure carbon@12 (12 g C = 1 mol C atoms = 6.022 : 1023 C atoms).
The definition of the mole gives us a relationship between mass (grams of carbon) and 
number of atoms (Avogadro’s number). This relationship, as we will see shortly, allows 
us to count atoms by weighing them.
Converting between Number of Moles  
and Number of Atoms
Converting between number of moles and number of atoms is similar to convert-
ing between dozens of eggs and number of eggs. For eggs, you use the conversion fac-
tor 1 dozen eggs = 12 eggs. For atoms, you use the conversion factor 1 mol atoms =  
6.022 * 1023 atoms. The conversion factors take the following forms:
1 mol atoms
6.022 * 1023 atoms or 6.022 * 1023 atoms
1 mol atoms
Example 2.6 demonstrates how to use these conversion factors in calculations.
One tablespoon of water
contains approximately 1
mol of water molecules.
One tablespoon is approximately  
15 mL; one mol of water occupies 
18 mL.
Example 2.6	
Converting between Number of Moles and Number of Atoms
Calculate the number of copper atoms in 2.45 mol of copper.
SORT  You are given the amount of copper in moles 
and asked to find the number of copper atoms.
GIVEN:  2.45 mol Cu
FIND:  Cu atoms
STRATEGIZE  Convert between number of moles and 
number of atoms by using Avogadro’s number as a 
conversion factor.
CONCEPTUAL PLAN

RELATIONSHIPS USED 
6.022 * 1023 = 1 mol (Avogadro’s number)
SOLVE  Follow the conceptual plan to solve the prob-
lem. Begin with 2.45 mol Cu and multiply by Avoga-
dro’s number to get to the number of Cu atoms.
SOLUTION 
2.45 mol Cu * 6.022 * 1023 Cu atoms
1 mol Cu
= 1.48 * 1024 Cu atoms
CHECK  Since atoms are small, it makes sense that the answer is large. The given number of moles of copper is almost 2.5,  
so the number of atoms is almost 2.5 times Avogadro’s number.
For Practice 2.6  A pure silver ring contains 2.80 * 1022 silver atoms. How many moles of silver atoms does it 
contain?
Twenty-two copper pennies
contain approximately 1 mol
of copper atoms.
Before 1982, when they became 
almost all zinc with only a copper 
coating, pennies were mostly copper.

	
2.9  Molar Mass: Counting Atoms by Weighing Them 	
71
Converting between Mass and Amount  
(Number of Moles)
To count atoms by weighing them, we need one other conversion factor—the mass of 
1 mol of atoms. For the isotope carbon-12, we know that the mass of 1 mol of atoms is 
exactly 12 g, which is numerically equivalent to carbon-12’s atomic mass in atomic mass 
units. Since the masses of all other elements are defined relative to carbon-12, the same 
relationship holds for all elements.
The mass of one mole of atoms of an element is its molar mass.
An element’s molar mass in grams per mole is numerically equal to 
the element’s atomic mass in atomic mass units.
For example, copper has an atomic mass of 63.55 amu and a molar mass of 63.55 g>mol. 
One mole of copper atoms therefore has a mass of 63.55 g. Just as the count for shrimp 
depends on the size of the shrimp, so the mass of 1 mol of atoms depends on the ele-
ment: 1 mol of aluminum atoms (which are lighter than copper atoms) has a mass of 
26.98 g, 1 mol of carbon atoms (which are even lighter than aluminum atoms) has a 
mass of 12.01 g, and 1 mol of helium atoms (lighter yet) has a mass of 4.003 g.
26.98 g aluminum = 1 mol aluminum = 6.022 × 1023 Al atoms
Al

He
12.01 g carbon = 1 mol carbon = 6.022 × 1023 C atoms
4.003 g helium = 1 mol helium = 6.022 × 1023 He atoms
The lighter the atom, the less mass in 1 mol of atoms.
The molar mass of any element is the conversion factor between the mass (in grams) 
of that element and the amount (in moles) of that element. For carbon:
12.01 g C =  1 mol C  or  
12.01 g C
mol C   or  1 mol C
12.01 g C
Example 2.7, on the next page, demonstrates how to use these conversion factors.
1 dozen marbles
1 dozen peas
▲ The two dishes contain the same number of objects (12), but the masses are different 
because peas are less massive than marbles. Similarly, a mole of light atoms will have less 
mass than a mole of heavier atoms.

Converting between Mass and Amount (Number of Moles)
Calculate the amount of carbon (in moles) contained in a 0.0265 g pencil “lead.” (Assume that the pencil lead is made of 
pure graphite, a form of carbon.)
SORT   You are given the mass of carbon and asked to find 
the amount of carbon in moles.

SOLUTION

1 mol C
12.01 g C = 2.21 * 10 - 3 mol C
CHECK  The given mass of carbon is much less than the molar mass of carbon, so it makes sense that the answer  
(the amount in moles) is much less than 1 mol of carbon.
For Practice 2.7  Calculate the amount of copper (in moles) in a 35.8 g pure copper sheet.
For More Practice 2.7  Calculate the mass (in grams) of 0.473 mol of titanium.
We now have all the tools to count the number of atoms in a sample of an element 
by weighing it. First, we obtain the mass of the sample. Then we convert it to an amount 
in moles using the element’s molar mass. Finally, we convert it to number of atoms 
using Avogadro’s number. The conceptual plan for these kinds of calculations takes the 
following form:
molar mass
of element
mol element
Avogadro’s
number
number of atoms
g element
Examples 2.8 and 2.9 demonstrate these conversions.

The Mole Concept—Converting between Mass and Number of Atoms
How many copper atoms are in a copper penny with a mass of 3.10 g? (Assume that the penny is composed of  
pure copper.)
SORT  You are given the mass of copper and 
asked to find the number of copper atoms.
GIVEN:  3.10 g Cu

STRATEGIZE  Convert between the mass 
of an element in grams and the number of

the problem. Begin with 3.10 g Cu and 
multiply by the appropriate conversion 
­factors to arrive at the number of Cu atoms.
SOLUTION 
3.10 g Cu *
1 mol C
63.55 g Cu * 6.022 * 1023 Cu atoms
1 mol Cu
= 2.94 * 1022 Cu atoms
CHECK  The answer (the number of copper atoms) is less than 6.022 * 1023 (1 mol). This is consistent with the given mass 
of copper atoms, which is less than the molar mass of copper.
For Practice 2.8  How many carbon atoms are there in a 1.3-carat diamond? Diamonds are a form of pure carbon. 
(1 carat = 0.20 g)
For More Practice 2.8  Calculate the mass of 2.25 * 1022 tungsten atoms.
Notice that numbers with large exponents, such as 6.022 * 1023, are almost unbe-
lievably large. Twenty-two copper pennies contain 6.022 * 1023 or 1 mol of copper 
atoms, but 6.022 * 1023 pennies would cover Earth’s entire surface to a depth of 300 m. 
Even objects small by everyday standards occupy a huge space when we have a mole of 
them. For example, a grain of sand has a mass of less than 1 mg and a diameter of less 
than 0.1 mm, yet 1 mol of sand grains would cover the state of Texas to a depth of several 
feet. For every increase of 1 in the exponent of a number, the number increases by a fac-
tor of 10, so 1023 is incredibly large. Of course 1 mol has to be a large number if it is to 
have practical value because atoms are so small.

You are asked to find the radius of the sphere.

Key Concepts
Brownian Motion (2.1)
▶
▶Brownian motion is the erratic, jittery motion of small particles 
that was first observed by Robert Brown in 1827. The description 
of Brownian motion by Einstein in 1905 and confirmation by 
Perrin in 1908 removed any lingering doubt about the particulate 
nature of matter.
The Atomic Theory (2.2, 2.3)
▶
▶Each element is composed of indestructible particles called atoms.
▶
▶All atoms of a given element have the same mass and other 
properties.
▶
▶Atoms combine in simple, whole-number ratios to form 
­compounds.
▶
▶Atoms of one element cannot change into atoms of another ele-
ment. In a chemical reaction, atoms change the way that they are 
bound together with other atoms to form a new substance.
The Electron (2.4)
▶
▶J. J. Thomson discovered the electron in the late 1800s through 
experiments with cathode rays. He deduced that electrons are 
negatively charged, and he measured their charge-to-mass ratio.
▶
▶Robert Millikan measured the charge of the electron, which—in 
conjunction with Thomson’s results—led to the calculation of the 
mass of an electron.
The Nuclear Atom (2.5)
▶
▶In 1909, Ernest Rutherford probed the inner structure of the atom 
by working with a form of radioactivity called alpha radiation and 
developed the nuclear theory of the atom.
▶
▶Nuclear theory states that the atom is mainly empty space, with 
most of its mass concentrated in a tiny region called the nucleus 
and most of its volume occupied by relatively light electrons.
Subatomic Particles (2.6)
▶
▶Atoms are composed of three fundamental particles: the proton 
(1 amu, +1 charge), the neutron (1 amu, 0 charge), and the elec-
tron (∼0 amu, -1 charge).
▶
▶The number of protons in the nucleus of the atom is its atomic 
number (Z) and defines the element.
▶
▶The sum of the number of protons and neutrons is the mass 
number (A).
▶
▶Atoms of an element that have different numbers of neutrons 
(and therefore different mass numbers) are isotopes.
▶
▶Atoms that lose or gain electrons become charged and are 
ions. Cations are positively charged and anions are negatively 
charged.
The Periodic Table (2.7)
▶
▶The periodic table tabulates all known elements in order of in-
creasing atomic number.
▶
▶The periodic table is arranged so that similar elements are 
grouped together in columns.
▶
▶Elements on the left side and in the center of the periodic table 
are metals and tend to lose electrons in chemical changes.
▶
▶Elements on the upper right side of the periodic table are non-
metals and tend to gain electrons in chemical changes.
▶
▶Elements located on the boundary between metals and nonmetals 
are metalloids.
Atomic Mass and the Mole (2.8, 2.9)
▶
▶The atomic mass of an element, listed directly below its symbol 
in the periodic table, is a weighted average of the masses of the 
naturally occurring isotopes of the element.
▶
▶One mole of an element is the amount of that element that con-
tains Avogadro’s number (6.022 * 1023) of atoms.
▶
▶Any sample of an element with a mass (in grams) that equals its 
atomic mass contains one mole of the element. For example, the 
atomic mass of carbon is 12.011 amu; therefore, 12.011 g of carbon 
contains 1 mol of carbon atoms.
Key Equations and Relationships
Relationship between Mass Number (A), Number of Protons (p), 
and Number of Neutrons (n) (2.6)
A = number of protons (p) + number of neutrons (n)
Atomic Mass (2.8)
atomic mass = a
n
(fraction of isotope n) * (mass of isotope n)
Avogadro’s Number (2.9)
1 mol = 6.0221421 * 1023 particles

many lead atoms would be in your lungs? (Assume a total lung 
volume of 5.50 L.)
	123. 	Pure gold is usually too soft for jewelry, so it is often alloyed

268,601 square miles.
	125. 	Use the concepts in this chapter to obtain an estimate for the 
number of atoms in the universe. Make the following assump-
tions: (a) All of the atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms 
in stars. (This is not a ridiculous assumption because over 
three-fourths of the atoms in the universe are in fact hydrogen. 
Gas and dust between the stars represent only about 15% of the 
visible matter of our galaxy, and planets compose a far tinier 
fraction.) (b) The sun is a typical star composed of pure hydro-
gen with a density of 1.4 g>cm3 and a radius of 7 * 108 m.  
(c) Each of the roughly 100 billion stars in the Milky Way gal-
axy contains the same number of atoms as our sun. (d) Each of 
the 10 billion galaxies in the visible universe contains the same 
number of atoms as our Milky Way galaxy.

Conceptual Problems

ratio of hydrogen to oxygen.
b.	When hydrogen and oxygen react, the mass of water formed 
is exactly equal to the mass of hydrogen and oxygen that 
­reacted.

tant that both of these definitions reference the same isotope? 
What would be the result, for example, of defining the mole 
with respect to C-12, but the amu with ­respect to Ne-20?

by each element. Without consulting a periodic table, arrange 
the cards so that atomic mass increases from left to right and 
elements with similar properties are above and below each 
other. Copy the periodic table you have invented onto a piece of 
paper. There is one element missing. Predict its mass and a

Data Interpretation and Analysis
Heavy Metals in Recycled Paper Packages
	142.	 Demand for recycled paper has increased as consumers have 
become more aware of the environmental issues surrounding 
waste disposal. Paper is a natural raw material made from 
renewable wood and plants. Recycled paper is made from waste 
paper and paperboard. Both new paper and recycled paper 
contain traces of heavy metals. However, some types of recycled 
paper contain more heavy metals than new paper due, in part, 
to the inks used for printing or adding color to the original 
paper. Metals can migrate from the paper packaging and 
containers used for food to the food itself. This metal migration 
is controlled and monitored to reduce the exposure of humans 
to heavy metals.
Food agencies in each country determine the limit of cad-
mium, zinc, nickel, and copper in packaging materials. Most 
countries impose a limit of heavy metals in recycled paper not 
to exceed 100.0 ppm or 100.0 mg>kg. The limit for lead in egg-, 
fruit-, or vegetable-packaging is lower—not to exceed—20.0 
mg>kg. The table in Figure a▼ lists the results of the analysis of 
samples of recycled paper produced by a manufacturer during a 
three-month period.
The goal of the manufacturer is to reduce the amount of 
heavy metals—especially lead—in the recycled paper it produc-
es and sells. From March to May, the manufacturer varied the 
methods of production each month to determine which meth-
od would produce paper with the lowest metal content. Each 
month, lab technicians cut small samples of recycled paper with 
an area of 1.000 dm2 and a thickness of 0.0500 cm. The techni-
cians then prepared the samples for analysis. The average density 
of the samples is 800.0 { 0.0245 kg>m3. 
Use the information provided in the figure to answer the 
following questions:
a.	 Did the company reduce the amount of lead in its product 
between March and May?
b.	 Which metal was not reduced?
c.	 Each month’s sample represents a different manufacturing 
process. Which process would you recommend the manu-
facturer choose to continue to use over the next year while 
additional processes are tested? Why?
d.	 What is the total amount of the five metals for the April 
sample (in mg>kg)?
e.	 What is the total mass (in mg) of the five metals for the April 
sample found in the 1.000 dm2 * 0.0500 cm sample?
f.	 Lead has four stable isotopes: 204Pb, 206Pb, 207Pb, 208Pb with 
% abundances of 1.40, 24.10, 22.10, and 52.40, respectively. 
Determine the mass (in mg) of 208Pb in the April sample.

is nearly representative of a natural sample. What is the average 
mass of the atoms in your drawing? What is the atomic mass of

(the mass of a single item is given in parentheses): electrons 
(9.10938 * 10 - 28 g), protons (1.67262 * 10 - 24 g), neutrons 
(1.67493 * 10 - 24 g), atoms of carbon-12 (1.992646 * 10 - 23 g), 
and doughnuts (74 g). Compare the mass of one mole of 
carbon-12 atoms to the sum of the masses of the particles that 
it contains. If the doughnut mentioned in this question were 
made entirely of carbon, how many atoms would it contain?

Answers to Conceptual Connections
The Law of Conservation of Mass
2.1	 Most of the matter that composed the log undergoes a chemi-
cal change by reacting with oxygen molecules in the air. The 
products of the reaction (mostly carbon dioxide and water) are 
released as gases into the air.
The Laws of Definite and Multiple Proportions
2.2	 The law of definite proportions applies to two or more samples 
of the same compound and states that the ratio of one element to 
the other is always the same. The law of multiple proportions 
applies to two different compounds containing the same two ele-
ments (A and B) and states that the masses of B that combine 
with 1 g of A are always related to each other as a small whole-
number ratio.
The Millikan Oil Drop Experiment
2.3	 The drop contains three excess electrons (3 * (-6 * 10 - 19 C)
= -4.8 * 10 - 19 C).
Isotopes
2.4	
C-12 nucleus
C-13 nucleus
A 10,000-atom sample of carbon, on average, contains 107 C-13 
atoms.
The Nuclear Atom, Isotopes, and Ions
2.5	 (b) The number of neutrons in the nucleus of an atom does not 
affect the atom’s size because the nucleus is miniscule compared 
to the atom itself.
Atomic Mass
2.6	 (a) Since 98.93% of the atoms are C-12, we would expect the 
atomic mass to be very close to the mass of the C-12 isotope.
Avogadro’s Number
2.7	 Avogadro’s number is defined with respect to carbon-12—it 
is the number equal to the number of atoms in exactly 12 g of 
carbon-12. If Avogadro’s number was defined as 1.00 * 1023 (a 
nice round number), it would correspond to 1.99 g of carbon-12 
atoms (an inconvenient number). Avogadro’s number is defined 
with respect to carbon-12 because, as you recall from Section 2.6, 
the amu (the basic mass unit used for all atoms) is defined rela-
tive to carbon-12. Therefore, the mass in grams of 1 mol of any 
element is equal to its atomic mass. As we have seen, these two 
definitions together make it possible to determine the number 
of atoms in a known mass of any element.
The Mole
2.8	 (b) The carbon sample contains more atoms than the copper 
sample because carbon has a lower molar mass than copper. 
Carbon atoms are lighter than copper atoms, so a 1-g sample of 
carbon contains more atoms than a 1-g sample of copper. The car-
bon sample also contains more atoms than the uranium sample 
because even though the uranium sample has 10 times the mass 
of the carbon sample, a uranium atom is more than 10 times as 
massive (238 g>mol for uranium versus 12 g>mol for carbon).

▲ When a balloon filled with H2 
and O2 is ignited, the two elements

H
ow many different substances exist? Recall from Chapter 2 that about 91 
­different elements exist in nature, so there are at least 91 different substances. 
However, the world would be dull—not to mention lifeless—with only 91 dif-
ferent substances. Fortunately, elements combine with each other to form compounds. 
Just as combinations of only 26 letters in our English alphabet allow for an almost 
limitless number of words, each with its own specific meaning, combinations of the 
91 naturally occurring elements allow for an almost limitless number of compounds, 
each with its own specific properties. The great diversity of substances that we find in 
nature is a direct result of the ability of elements to form compounds. Life, for exam-
ple, could not exist with just 91 different elements. It takes compounds, in all of their 
diversity, to make life possible.
	 3.1	
Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Water
Hydrogen (H2) is an explosive gas used as a fuel in rocket engines. Oxygen (O2), also 
a gas, is a natural component of the air on Earth. Oxygen itself is not flammable but 
must be present for combustion (burning) to occur. Hydrogen and oxygen both have 
extremely low boiling points, as you can see from the table on the following page. 
When hydrogen and oxygen combine to form the compound water (H2O), however, a 
dramatically different substance results.

88	
Chapter 3  Molecules, Compounds, and Chemical Equations
First of all, water is a liquid rather than a gas at room temperature, and its boiling 
point is hundreds of degrees higher than the boiling points of hydrogen and oxygen. 
Second, instead of being flammable (like hydrogen gas) or supporting combustion (like 
oxygen gas), water actually smothers flames. Water is nothing like the hydrogen and 
oxygen from which it forms. The dramatic difference between the elements hydrogen 
and oxygen and the compound water is typical of the differences between elements and 
the compounds that they form. When two or more elements combine to form a compound, 
an entirely new substance results.
Consider as another example common table salt, a highly stable compound composed 
of sodium and chlorine. Elemental sodium, by contrast, is a highly reactive, silvery metal 
that can explode on contact with water. Elemental chlorine is a corrosive, greenish-yellow 
gas that can be fatal if inhaled. Yet the compound formed from the combination of these 
two elements is sodium chloride (or table salt), a flavor enhancer that tastes great on steak.
Although some of the substances that we encounter in everyday life are elements, 
most are compounds. As we discussed in Chapter 1, a compound is different from a mix-
ture of elements. In a compound, elements combine in fixed, definite proportions; in a 
mixture, elements can mix in any proportions whatsoever. Consider the difference 
between a hydrogen–oxygen mixture and water in Figure 3.1▼. A hydrogen–oxygen 
mixture can have any proportions of hydrogen and oxygen gas. Water, by contrast, is 
composed of water molecules that always contain two hydrogen atoms to every one oxy-
gen atom. Water has a definite proportion of hydrogen to oxygen.
In this chapter you will learn about compounds: how to represent them, how to name 
them, how to distinguish between their different types, and how to write chemical equa-
tions showing how they form and change. You will also learn how to quantify the elemental 
composition of a compound. This is important in determining how much of a particular 
element is contained within a particular compound. For example, patients with high blood 
pressure (hypertension) often have to reduce their sodium ion intake. The sodium ion is nor-
mally consumed in the form of sodium chloride, so a hypertension patient needs to know

how much sodium is present in a given amount of sodium chloride. Similarly, an  
iron-mining company needs to know how much iron it can recover from a given amount of 
iron ore. This chapter provides the tools to understand and answer these kinds of questions.
	 3.2	
Chemical Bonds
Compounds are composed of atoms held together by chemical bonds. Chemical bonds 
form because of the attractions between the charged particles (the electrons and pro-
tons) that compose atoms. We discuss these interactions in more detail in Chapter 9 (see 
Section 9.2). For now, remember that, as we discussed in Section 2.4, charged particles 
exert electrostatic forces on one another: like charges repel and opposite charges attract. 
These forces are responsible for chemical bonding.
We can broadly classify most chemical bonds into two types: ionic and covalent. 
Ionic bonds—which occur between metals and nonmetals—involve the transfer of elec-
trons from one atom to another. Covalent bonds—which occur between two or more 
nonmetals—involve the sharing of electrons between two atoms.
Ionic Bonds
Recall from Chapter 2 that metals have a tendency to lose electrons and that nonmetals 
have a tendency to gain them. Therefore, when a metal interacts with a nonmetal, it can

which in the solid phase is composed of a lattice—a regular three-dimensional array—of 
alternating cations and anions.
Covalent Bonds
When a nonmetal bonds with another nonmetal, neither atom transfers its electron to 
the other. Instead the bonding atoms share some of their electrons. The shared electrons 
have lower potential energy than they do in the isolated atoms because they interact 
with the nuclei of both atoms. The bond is a covalent bond and the covalently bound 
atoms compose a molecule. Each molecule is independent of the others—the molecules 
are themselves not covalently bound to one another. Therefore, we call covalently 
bonded compounds molecular compounds.
We can begin to understand the stability of a covalent bond by considering the most 
stable (or lowest potential energy) configuration of a negative charge interacting with 
two positive charges (which are separated by some small distance). Figure 3.3▼ shows 
that the lowest potential energy occurs when the negative charge lies between the two 
positive charges because in this arrangement the negative charge can interact with both 
positive charges. Similarly, shared electrons in a covalent chemical bond hold the bonding 
atoms together by attracting the positively charged nuclei of both bonding atoms.

Representing Compounds: Chemical 
Formulas and Molecular Models
The quickest and easiest way to represent a compound is with its chemical formula, 
which indicates the elements present in the compound and the relative number of atoms 
or ions of each element. For example, H2O is the chemical formula for water—it indicates 
that water consists of hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a two-to-one ratio. The formula con-
tains the symbol for each element and a subscript indicating the relative number of atoms 
of the element. A subscript of 1 is typically omitted. Chemical formulas generally list the 
more metallic (or more positively charged) elements first, followed by the less metallic 
(or more negatively charged) elements. Other examples of common chemical formulas 
include NaCl for sodium chloride, indicating sodium and chloride ions in a one-to-one 
ratio; CO2 for carbon dioxide, indicating carbon and oxygen atoms in a one-to-two ratio; 
and CCl4 for carbon tetrachloride, indicating carbon and chlorine in a one-to-four ratio.
Types of Chemical Formulas
We can categorize chemical formulas into three different types: empirical, molecular, 
and structural. An empirical formula gives the relative number of atoms of each ele-
ment in a compound. A molecular formula gives the actual number of atoms of each 
element in a molecule of a compound. For example, the empirical formula for hydrogen 
peroxide is HO, but its molecular formula is H2O2. The molecular formula is always a

Structural Formulas  Write the structural formula for water.
whole-number multiple of the empirical formula. For some compounds, the empirical 
formula and the molecular formula are identical. For example, the empirical and molec-
ular formula for water is H2O because water molecules contain two hydrogen atoms and 
one oxygen atom, and no simpler whole-number ratio can express the relative number 
of hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms.
A structural formula uses lines to represent covalent bonds and shows how 
atoms in a molecule connect or bond to each other. The structural formula for H2O2 is:
H ¬ O¬ O¬ H
We can also write structural formulas to convey a sense of the molecule’s geometry. For 
example, we can write the structural formula for hydrogen peroxide as:
H
O
O
H
This version of the formula represents the approximate angles between bonds, giving a 
sense of the molecule’s shape.
Structural formulas can also depict the different types of bonds that occur within 
molecules. For example, consider the structural formula for carbon dioxide:
O “ C “ O
The two lines between each carbon and oxygen atom represent a double bond, which is 
generally stronger and shorter than a single bond (represented by a single line). A sin-
gle bond corresponds to one shared electron pair, while a double bond corresponds to 
two shared electron pairs. We will learn more about single, double, and even triple 
bonds in Chapter 9.
The type of formula we use depends on how much we know about the compound 
and how much we want to communicate. A structural formula communicates the most 
information, while an empirical formula communicates the least.
Example 3.1	
Molecular and Empirical Formulas
Write empirical formulas for the compounds represented by the molecular 
formulas.
(a)	 C4H8	
(b)	 B2H6	
(c)	 CCl4
Solution
To determine the empirical formula from a molecular formula, divide the sub-
scripts by the greatest common factor (the largest number that divides exactly 
into all of the subscripts).
(a)	 For C4H8, the greatest common factor is 4. The empirical formula is therefore CH2.
(b)	 For B2H6, the greatest common factor is 2. The empirical formula is therefore BH3.
(c)	 For CCl4, the only common factor is 1, so the empirical formula and the 
molecular formula are identical.

Molecular Models
A molecular model is a more accurate and complete way to specify a compound. A 
­ball-and-stick molecular model represents atoms as balls and chemical bonds as 
sticks; how the two connect reflects a molecule’s shape. The balls are typically color-
coded to specific elements. For example, carbon is customarily black, hydrogen is white, 
nitrogen is blue, and oxygen is red. (For a complete list of colors of elements in the 
molecular models used in this book, see Appendix IIA.)
In a space-filling molecular model, atoms fill the space between each other to 
more closely represent our best estimates for how a molecule might appear if scaled to 
visible size. Consider the following ways to represent a molecule of methane, the main 
component of natural gas:

The molecular formula of methane indicates the number and type of each atom in the 
molecule: one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. The structural formula indicates 
how the atoms connect: the carbon atom bonds to the four hydrogen atoms. The ball-
and-stick model clearly portrays the geometry of the molecule: the carbon atom sits in 
the center of a tetrahedron formed by the four hydrogen atoms. And finally, the space-
filling model gives the best sense of the relative sizes of the atoms and how they merge 
together in bonding.
Throughout this book, you will see molecules represented in all of these ways. As 
you look at these representations, keep in mind what you learned in Chapter 1: the 
details about a molecule—the atoms that compose it, the lengths of the bonds between 
atoms, the angles of the bonds between atoms, and its overall shape—determine the 
properties of the substance that the molecule composes. Change any of these details 
and those properties change. Table 3.1 shows various compounds represented in the dif-
ferent ways we have just discussed.

geometrical shape characterized by  
four equivalent triangular faces.

Representing Molecules  Based on what you learned in Chapter 2 about 
atoms, what part of the atom do you think the spheres in the molecular space-filling 
models shown in Table 3.1 represent? If you were to superimpose a nucleus on one of 
these spheres, how big would you draw it?

An Atomic-Level View of Elements  
and Compounds
Recall from Chapter 1 that we categorize pure substances as either elements or com-
pounds. We can subcategorize elements and compounds according to the basic units 
that compose them, as shown in Figure 3.4▶. Elements may be either atomic or molecu-
lar. Compounds may be either molecular or ionic.
Atomic elements exist in nature with single atoms as their basic units. Most ele-
ments fall into this category. For example, helium is composed of helium atoms, alumi-
num is composed of aluminum atoms, and iron is composed of iron atoms. Molecular 
elements do not normally exist in nature with single atoms as their basic units.

Molecular Elements
▶ Figure 3.5  Molecular 
Elements  The highlighted elements 
exist primarily as diatomic molecules 
(yellow) or polyatomic molecules 
(red).
Instead, they exist as molecules—two or more atoms of the element bonded together. 
Most molecular elements exist as diatomic molecules. For example, hydrogen is com-
posed of H2 molecules, nitrogen is composed of N2 molecules, and chlorine is composed 
of Cl2 molecules. A few molecular elements exist as polyatomic molecules. Phosphorus 
exists as P4, and sulfur exists as S8. Figure 3.5▲ shows the elements that exist primarily 
as diatomic or polyatomic molecules.
Molecular compounds are usually composed of two or more covalently bonded 
nonmetals. The basic units of molecular compounds are molecules composed of the 
constituent atoms. For example, water is composed of H2O molecules, dry ice is com-
posed of CO2 molecules, and propane (often used as a fuel for grills) is composed of C3H8 
molecules as illustrated in Figure 3.6(a)▼.
Ionic compounds are usually composed of a metal ionically bonded to one or more 
nonmetals. The basic unit of an ionic compound is the formula unit, the smallest, 
electrically neutral collection of ions. A formula unit is not a molecule—it does not usu-
ally exist as a discrete entity but rather as part of a larger lattice. For example, the ionic 
Some ionic compounds, such as 
k2napo4, contain more than one type 
of metal ion.

compound table salt, with the formula unit NaCl, is composed of Na + and Cl - ions in a 
one-to-one ratio. In table salt, Na + and Cl - ions exist in a three-dimensional alternating 
array. Because ionic bonds are not directional, no one Na + ion pairs with a specific Cl - 
ion. Rather, as illustrated in Figure 3.6(b)◀, any one Na + cation is surrounded by Cl - 
anions and vice versa.
Many common ionic compounds contain ions that are themselves composed of a 
group of covalently bonded atoms with an overall charge. For example, the active ingre-
dient in household bleach is sodium hypochlorite, which acts to chemically alter color-
causing molecules in clothes (bleaching action) and to kill bacteria (disinfection). 
Hypochlorite is a polyatomic ion—an ion composed of two or more atoms—with the 
formula ClO -. (Note that the charge on the hypochlorite ion is a property of the whole 
ion, not just the oxygen atom; this is true for all polyatomic ions.) The hypochlorite ion 
is often found as a unit in other compounds as well (such as KClO and Mg(ClO)2). Other 
common compounds that contain polyatomic ions include sodium bicarbonate 
(NaHCO3), also known as baking soda; sodium nitrite (NaNO2), an inhibitor of bacterial 
growth in packaged meats; and calcium carbonate (CaCO3), the active ingredient in 
antacids such as TUMS®.

household products such as bleach, 
which contains sodium hypochlorite 
(NaClO).

Ionic and Molecular Compounds  Which statement best summarizes the 
difference between ionic and molecular compounds?
(a)	 Molecular compounds contain highly directional covalent bonds, which result

result (in the solid phase) in the formation of ionic lattices—extended networks 
of alternating cations and anions.
(b)	 Molecular compounds contain covalent bonds in which one of the atoms 
shares an electron with the other one, resulting in a new force that holds the 
atoms together in a covalent molecule. Ionic compounds contain ionic bonds 
in which one atom donates an electron to the other, resulting in a new force 
that holds the ions together in pairs (in the solid phase).
(c)	 The key difference between ionic and covalent compounds is the types of 
­elements that compose them, not the way that the atoms bond together.

Ionic Compounds: Formulas and Names
Ionic compounds occur throughout Earth’s crust as minerals. Examples include lime-
stone (CaCO3), a type of sedimentary rock; gibbsite [Al(OH)3], a mineral; and soda ash 
(Na2CO3), a natural deposit. We can also find ionic compounds in the foods that we 
eat. Examples include sodium chloride (NaCl), which is table salt; calcium carbonate 
(CaCO3), a source of calcium necessary for bone health; and potassium chloride (KCl), a 
source of potassium necessary for fluid balance and muscle function. Ionic compounds 
are generally very stable because the attractions between cations and anions within ionic 
compounds are strong and because each ion interacts with several oppositely charged 
ions in the crystalline lattice.
▶ Calcite (left) is the main 
component of limestone, marble, 
and other forms of calcium 
carbonate (caco3) commonly found 
in Earth’s crust. Trona (right) is a 
crystalline form of hydrated sodium 
carbonate (na3H(co3)2 # 2 H2o).
See Figure 2.13 to review the 
elements that form ions with a 
predictable charge.
Writing Formulas for Ionic Compounds
Since ionic compounds are charge-neutral, and since many elements form only one 
type of ion with a predictable charge, we can deduce the formulas for many ionic 
compounds from their constituent elements. For example, the formula for the ionic 
compound composed of sodium and chlorine must be NaCl because in compounds 
Na always forms 1+ cations and Cl always forms 1- anions. In order for the com-
pound to be charge-neutral, it must contain one Na + cation for every one Cl - anion. 
The formula for the ionic compound composed of calcium and chlorine, however, is 
CaCl2 because Ca always forms 2+ cations and Cl always forms 1- anions. In order 
for this compound to be charge-neutral, it must contain one Ca2 + cation for every 
two Cl - anions.

Naming Ionic Compounds
Some ionic compounds—such as NaCl (table salt) and NaHCO3 (baking soda)—have 
common names, which are nicknames of sorts learned by familiarity. However, 
chemists have developed systematic names for different types of compounds includ-
ing ionic ones. Even if you are not familiar with a compound, you can determine its 
systematic name from its chemical formula. Conversely, you can deduce the formula of 
a compound from its systematic name.
The first step in naming an ionic compound is to identify it as one. Remember, ionic 
compounds are usually composed of metals and nonmetals; any time you see a metal and one 
or more nonmetals together in a chemical formula, assume that you 
have an ionic compound. Ionic compounds can be categorized into 
two types, depending on the metal in the compound. The first type 
contains a metal whose charge is invariant from one compound to 
another. Whenever the metal in this first type of compound forms 
an ion, the ion always has the same charge.
Since the charge of the metal in this first type of ionic com-
pound is always the same, it need not be specified in the name of 
the compound. Sodium, for instance, has a 1+ charge in all of its 
IONIC COMPOUNDS

one type of ion.
Metal forms more

Metals Whose Charge Is Invariant from One Compound to Another

compounds with other charges, but these are rare.)
compounds. Figure 3.7▲ lists some examples of these types of metals; the charges of 
these metals can be inferred from their group number in the periodic table.
The second type of ionic compound contains a metal with a charge that can differ 
in different compounds. In other words, the metal in this second type of ionic com-
pound can form more than one kind of cation (depending on the compound), and its 
charge must therefore be specified for a given compound. Iron, for instance, forms a 2+ 
cation in some of its compounds and a 3+ cation in others. Metals of this type are often 
transition metals (Figure 3.8◀). However, some transition metals, such as Zn and Ag, 
form cations with the same charge in all of their compounds, and some main-group 
metals, such as Pb and Sn, form more than one type of cation.
Naming Binary Ionic Compounds Containing  
a Metal That Forms Only One Type of Cation
Binary compounds contain only two different elements. The names of binary ionic 
compounds take the form:
name of
cation
(metal)
base name of
anion (nonmetal)
+ -ide
For example, the name for KCl consists of the name of the cation, potassium, 
followed by the base name of the anion, chlor, with the ending -ide. Its full name is 
potassium chloride.
KCl  potassium chloride
The name for CaO consists of the name of the cation, calcium, followed by the 
base name of the anion, ox, with the ending -ide. Its full name is calcium oxide.
CaO  calcium oxide
The base names for various nonmetals, and their most common charges in ionic 
compounds, are shown in Table 3.2.

Example 3.5	
Naming Ionic Compounds Containing a Metal 
That Forms Only One Type of Cation
Naming Binary Ionic Compounds Containing  
a Metal That Forms More Than One Kind of Cation
For these types of metals, the name of the cation is followed by a Roman numeral (in 
parentheses) that indicates the charge of the metal in that particular compound. For 
example, we distinguish between Fe2 + and Fe3 + as follows:
Fe2 +    iron(II)
Fe3 +    iron(III)
The full names for compounds containing metals that form more 
than one kind of cation have the form:
charge of cation (metal)
in Roman numerals
in parentheses
name of
cation
(metal)
base name of
anion (nonmetal)
+ -ide
You can determine the charge of the metal cation by inference from the 
sum of the charges of the nonmetal anions—remember that the sum of all 
the charges in the compound must be zero. Table 3.3 shows some of the 
metals that form more than one cation and their most common charges. 
For example, in CrBr3, the charge of chromium must be 3+ in order for the 
compound to be charge-neutral with three Br- anions. The cation is 
named:
Cr3 +  chromium(III)
Note that there is no space between 
the name of the cation and the 
parenthetical number indicating its 
charge.
The full name of the compound is:
CrBr3  chromium(III) bromide
Similarly, in CuO the charge of copper must be 2+ in order for the com-
pound to be charge-neutral with one O2 - anion. The cation is therefore 
named:
Cu2 +  copper(II)

system, chromium(II) oxide is named chromous oxide. Addition-
ally, the suffix -ous indicates the ion with the lesser charge, and -ic 
indicates the ion with the greater charge. We will not use the older 
system in this text.

Naming Ionic Compounds Containing Polyatomic Ions
We name ionic compounds that contain a polyatomic ion in the same way as other ionic 
compounds, except that we use the name of the polyatomic ion whenever it occurs. 
Table 3.4 lists common polyatomic ions and their formulas. For example, NaNO2 is 
named according to its cation, Na + (sodium), and its polyatomic anion, NO2
- (nitrite). Its 
full name is sodium nitrite.
NaNO2  sodium  nitrite
FeSO4 is named according to its cation iron, its charge (II), and its polyatomic ion sulfate. 
Its full name is iron(II) sulfate.
FeSO4  iron(II)  sulfate
If the compound contains both a polyatomic cation and a polyatomic anion, use 
the names of both polyatomic ions. For example, NH4NO3 is ammonium nitrate.
NH4NO3  ammonium  nitrate
You should be able to recognize polyatomic ions in a chemical formula, so become 
familiar with the ions listed in Table 3.4. Most polyatomic ions are oxyanions, anions 
containing oxygen and another element. Notice that when a series of oxyanions con-
tains different numbers of oxygen atoms, they are named systematically according to 
Name the compound PbCl4.
Solution
The charge on Pb must be 4+ for the compound to be charge-neutral with four 
Cl - anions. The name for PbCl4 is the name of the cation, lead, followed by the 
charge of the cation in parentheses (IV) and the base name of the anion, chlor, 
with the ending -ide. The full name is lead(IV) chloride.
PbCl4 lead(IV) chloride

the number of oxygen atoms in the ion. If there are only two ions in the series, the one 
with more oxygen atoms has the ending -ate and the one with fewer has the ending -ite. 
For example, NO3

- is nitrite.
NO3

NO2

If there are more than two ions in the series, then the prefixes hypo-, meaning less than, 
and per-, meaning more than, are used. So ClO - is hypochlorite (less oxygen than chlo-
rite), and ClO4
- is perchlorate (more oxygen than chlorate).

Hydrated Ionic Compounds
The ionic compounds called hydrates contain a specific number of water molecules asso-
ciated with each formula unit. For example, the formula for epsom salts is MgSO4 # 7 H2O, 
and its systematic name is magnesium sulfate heptahydrate. The seven H2O molecules 
associated with the formula unit are waters of hydration. Waters of hydration can usually 
be removed by heating the compound. Figure 3.9▶ shows a sample of cobalt(II) chloride 
hexahydrate (CoCl2 # 6 H2O) before and after heating. The hydrate is pink and the anhy-
drous salt (the salt without any associated water molecules) is blue. Hydrates are named just 
as other ionic compounds, but they are given the additional name “prefixhydrate,” where 
the prefix indicates the number of water molecules associated with each formula unit.
Common hydrated ionic compounds and their names are as follows:
CaSO4 # 1
2 H2O
calcium sulfate hemihydrate
BaCl2 # 6 H2O
barium chloride hexahydrate
CuSO4 # 5 H2O
copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate

Molecular Compounds: Formulas  
and Names
In contrast to ionic compounds, the formula for a molecular compound cannot readily 
be determined from its constituent elements because the same combination of elements 
may form many different molecular compounds, each with a different formula. For exam-
ple, carbon and oxygen form both CO and CO2, and hydrogen and oxygen form both 
H2O and H2O2. Nitrogen and oxygen form all of the following molecular compounds: 
NO, NO2, N2O, N2O3, N2O4, and N2O5. In Chapter 9, we will discuss the stability of these

Chapter 3  Molecules, Compounds, and Chemical Equations
various combinations of the same elements. For now, we focus on naming a molecular 
compound based on its formula and writing its formula based on its name.
Naming Molecular Compounds
Like ionic compounds, many molecular compounds have common names. For example, 
H2O and NH3 have the common names water and ammonia. However, the sheer number 
of existing molecular compounds—numbering in the millions—necessitates a system-
atic approach to naming them.
The first step in naming a molecular compound is identifying it as one. Remember, 
molecular compounds are composed of two or more nonmetals. In this section, we discuss 
how to name binary (two-element) molecular compounds. Their names have the form:
preﬁx
preﬁx
name of
1st
element
base name of
2nd element
+ -ide
When writing the name of a molecular compound, as when writing the formula, we 
first list the more metal-like element (toward the left and bottom of the periodic table). 
Generally, we write the name of the element with the smallest group number first. If the 
two elements lie in the same group, then we write the element with the greatest row 
number first. The prefixes given to each element indicate the number of atoms present:
mono = 1
 
hexa = 6
di = 2
 
hepta = 7
tri = 3
 
octa = 8
tetra = 4
 
nona = 9
penta = 5
 
deca = 10
If there is only one atom of the first element in the formula, the prefix mono- is nor-
mally omitted. For example, we name NO2 according to the first element, nitrogen, with 
no prefix because mono- is omitted for the first element, followed by the prefix di-, to 
indicate two oxygen atoms, and the base name of the second element, ox, with the end-
ing -ide. Its full name is nitrogen dioxide.
NO2  nitrogen  dioxide
We name the compound N2O, sometimes called laughing gas, similarly except that 
we use the prefix di- before nitrogen to indicate two nitrogen atoms and the prefix mono- 
before oxide to indicate one oxygen atom. Its full name is dinitrogen monoxide.
N2O  dinitrogen  monoxide
These prefixes are the same as those 
used in naming hydrates.
When a prefix ends with “o” and the 
base name begins with “o,” the first 
“o” is often dropped. For example, 
mono-oxide becomes monoxide.
Name each compound.
(a)	 NI3	
(b)	 PCl5

followed by the base name of the second element, iod, prefixed by tri- to 
indicate three and given the suffix -ide.

followed by the base name of the second element, chlor, prefixed by penta- to

metal. Names for binary acids have the form:
Conceptual 
Connection 3.6 
Nomenclature  The compound NCl3 is nitrogen trichloride, but AlCl3 is simply 
aluminum chloride. Why?
Naming Acids
We can define acids in a number of ways, as we will discuss in Chapter 16. For now we 
define acids as molecular compounds that release hydrogen ions (H +) when dissolved 
in water. Acids are composed of hydrogen, usually written first in their formula, and one 
or more nonmetals, written second. For example, HCl is a molecular compound that, 
when dissolved in water, forms H +(aq) and Cl -(aq) ions, where aqueous (aq) means dis-
solved in water. Therefore, HCl is an acid when dissolved in water. To distinguish between 
gaseous HCl (which is named hydrogen monochloride because it is a molecular com-
pound) and HCl in solution (which is named hydrochloric acid because it is an acid), we 
write the former as HCl(g) and the latter as HCl(aq).
Acids are characterized by their sour taste and their ability to dissolve many metals. 
For example, hydrochloric acid is present in stomach fluids, and its sour taste becomes 
painfully obvious during vomiting. Hydrochloric acid also dissolves some metals. For 
example, if we put a strip of zinc into a test tube of hydrochloric acid, it slowly dissolves 
as the H +(aq) ions convert the zinc metal into Zn2 +(aq) cations (Figure 3.10▼).
Acids are present in foods such as lemons and limes and are used in household prod-
ucts such as toilet bowl cleaner and Lime-A-Way. In this section, we discuss how to name 
them; in Chapter 16 you will learn more about their 
properties. We categorize acids into two types: binary 
acids and oxyacids.
▲ Many fruits are acidic and have 
the characteristically sour taste of 
acids.
(c)	 The name of the compound is the name of the first element, phosphorus, 
prefixed by tetra- to indicate four, followed by the base name of the second 
element, sulf, prefixed by deca- to indicate ten and given the suffix -ide.

Naming Oxyacids
Oxyacids contain hydrogen and an oxyanion (an anion containing a nonmetal and 
oxygen). The common oxyanions are listed in the table of polyatomic ions (Table 3.4). 
For example, HNO3(aq) contains the nitrate (NO3
-) ion, H2SO3(aq) contains the sulfite 
(SO3
2 -) ion, and H2SO4(aq) contains the sulfate (SO4
2 -) ion. Oxyacids are a combina-
tion of one or more H + ions with an oxyanion. The number of H + ions depends on the

ertain pollutants—such as NO, no2, and so2—form 
acids when mixed with water. NO and no2, primarily 
emitted in vehicular exhaust, combine with atmospheric 
­oxygen and water to form nitric acid, Hno3(aq). so2, emitted 
primarily from coal-powered electricity generation, combines 
with atmospheric oxygen and water to form sulfuric acid, 
H2so4(aq). Both Hno3(aq) and H2so4(aq) result in acidic 
rainwater. The problem is greatest in the northeastern 
­United States where pollutants from midwestern electrical 
power plants combine with rainwater to produce rain that is 
up to ten times more acidic than normal.
Acid rain can fall or flow into lakes and streams, making 
these bodies of water more acidic. Some species of aquatic 
animals—such as trout, bass, snails, salamanders, and 
clams—cannot tolerate the increased acidity and die. This in 
turn disturbs the ecosystem of the lake, resulting in imbal-
ances that may lead to the death of other aquatic species. 
Acid rain also weakens trees by dissolving and washing away 
nutrients in the soil and by damaging leaves. Appalachian red 
spruce trees have been the hardest hit, with many forests 
showing significant acid rain damage.
In addition, acid rain degrades building materials because 
acids dissolve iron, the main component of steel, and caco3 
(limestone), a main component of marble and concrete. Con-
sequently, acid rain has damaged many statues, buildings, 
and bridges in the northeastern United States.
Acid rain has been a problem for many years, but legisla-
tion passed toward the end of the last century has begun to 
address this issue. In 1990, Congress passed several amend-
ments to the Clean Air Act that included provisions requiring 
electrical utilities to lower so2 emissions. Since then, so2 
emissions have decreased and rain in the northeastern Unit-
ed States has become less acidic. With time, and with contin-
ued enforcement of the acid rain regulation, lakes, streams, 
and forests damaged by acid rain should recover.

Summary of Inorganic Nomenclature
In Section 3.5 and Section 3.6, we discussed naming inorganic compounds, specifically 
ionic compounds, molecular compounds, and acids. However, we often have to name 
a compound without initially knowing the category into which it falls. In other words, 
real-life nomenclature is a bit messier than the categorized nomenclature we just worked 
through. Figure 3.11▼ summarizes inorganic nomenclature in a flowchart that will help 
you to tackle nomenclature from beginning to end.

Chapter 3  Molecules, Compounds, and Chemical Equations
To use the flowchart, begin by determining what type of compound you are try-
ing to name. For example, to name the compound MgCl2, you need to decide if the 
compound is ionic, molecular, or an acid. In this case, since MgCl2 is composed of a 
metal and nonmetal, it is ionic. Therefore, you begin at the box labeled “IONIC” at 
the far left side of the flowchart.
Next, decide whether the metal in the compound forms only one type of ion or 
more than one type. You can determine this by looking for the metal (in this case mag-
nesium) in Figure 3.7. Since magnesium is listed in the figure, it forms only one type of 
ion; therefore, you take the left branch in the flowchart as shown in Figure 3.12◀.
Finally, name the compound according to the blocks at the end of the path in the 
flowchart. In this case, write the name of the cation (the metal) followed by the base 
name of the anion (the nonmetal) appended with the ending -ide. Its full name is mag-
nesium chloride.

nated as aqueous, it is an acid.
Next determine whether the acid contains oxygen. Since HClO4 con-
tains oxygen, it is an oxyacid.
Then determine whether the name of the oxyanion ends in -ate or -ite. 
Since the oxyanion is perchlorate, it ends in -ate.
Finally, name the acid as the base name of the oxyanion, perchlor, with 
the ending -ic, followed by the word acid.

of ion or more than one type. Since Co is not listed in Figure 3.7, it must 
form more than one type of ion.

For example, the formula mass of carbon dioxide, CO2, is:
             
x Multiply by 2 because formula has two oxygen atoms. 
 Formula mass = 12.01 amu + 2(16.00 amu)
  = 44.01 amu
and that of sodium oxide, Na2O, is:
          
x           Multiply by 2 because formula has two sodium atoms.
Formula mass = 2(22.99 amu) + 16.00 amu
 
= 61.98 amu
Molar Mass of a Compound
In Chapter 2 (Section 2.9), we saw that an element’s molar mass—the mass in grams 
of one mole of its atoms—is numerically equivalent to its atomic mass. We then used 
the molar mass in combination with Avogadro’s number to determine the number of 
atoms in a given mass of the element. We can apply the same concept to compounds. 
The molar mass of a compound—the mass in grams of 1 mol of its molecules or formula 
units—is numerically equivalent to its formula mass. For example, we just calculated the 
formula mass of CO2 to be 44.01 amu. The molar mass is, therefore:
CO2 molar  mass = 44.01 g>mol
Using Molar Mass to Count Molecules by Weighing
The molar mass of CO2 is a conversion factor between mass (in grams) and amount (in 
moles) of CO2. Suppose we want to find the number of CO2 molecules in a sample of dry 
ice (solid CO2) with a mass of 10.8 g. This calculation is analogous to Example 2.8, where 
we found the number of atoms in a sample of copper of a given mass. We begin with the 
Remember, ionic compounds do 
not contain individual molecules. 
In casual language, the smallest 
electrically neutral collection of ions 
is sometimes called a molecule but is 
more correctly called a formula unit.
Example 3.12	
Calculating Formula Mass
Calculate the formula mass of glucose, C6H12O6.
Solution
To find the formula mass, add the atomic masses of each atom in the chemical formula.
 Formula mass = 6 * (atomic mass C) + 12 * (atomic mass H) + 6 * (atomic mass O)
 = 6(12.01 amu)         + 12(1.008 amu)          + 6(16.00 amu)
 = 180.16 amu

Composition of Compounds
A chemical formula, in combination with the molar masses of its constituent elements, 
indicates the relative quantities of each element in a compound, which is extremely use-
ful information. For example, about 35 years ago, scientists began to suspect that syn-
thetic compounds known as chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were destroying ozone (O3) 
in Earth’s upper atmosphere. Upper atmospheric ozone is important because it acts as a 
shield, protecting life on Earth from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet light.
CFCs are chemically inert compounds used primarily as refrigerants and industrial 
solvents. Over time, CFCs accumulated in the atmosphere. In the upper atmosphere, 
sunlight breaks bonds within CFCs, releasing chlorine atoms. The chlorine atoms react 
with ozone, converting it into O2. So the harmful part of CFCs is the chlorine atoms that 
they carry. How can we determine the mass of chlorine in a given mass of a CFC?
One way to express how much of an element is in a given compound is to use the 
element’s mass percent composition for that compound. The mass percent composi-
tion or mass percent of an element is that element’s percentage of the compound’s 
total mass. We calculate the mass percent of element X in a compound from the chemi-
cal formula as follows:
Mass percent of element X =
mass of element X in 1 mol of compound
mass of 1 mol of the compound
* 100%
Suppose, for example, that we want to calculate the mass percent composition of Cl 
in the chlorofluorocarbon CCl2F2. The mass percent Cl is given by:
Mass percent Cl = 2 × molar mass Cl × 100%
molar mass CCl2F2
CCl2F2
We multiply the molar mass of Cl by 2 because the chemical formula has a subscript of 2 
for Cl, indicating that 1 mol of CCl2F2 contains 2 mol of Cl atoms. We calculate the 
molar mass of CCl2F2 as follows:
 Molar mass = 12.01 g>mol + 2(35.45 g>mol) + 2(19.00 g>mol)
 = 120.91 g>mol
So the mass percent of Cl in CCl2F2 is:
 Mass percent Cl = 2 *  molar mass Cl
molar mass  CCl2F2
* 100%
 =
2 * 35.45 g>mol
120.91 g>mol
* 100%
 = 58.64%

Mass Percent Composition as a Conversion Factor
The mass percent composition of an element in a compound is a conversion fac-
tor between mass of the element and mass of the compound. For example, we saw  
that the mass percent composition of Cl in CCl2F2 is 58.64%. Since percent means per hun-
dred, there are 58.64 g Cl per hundred grams CCl2F2, which can be expressed as the ratio:
58.64 g Cl : 100 g CCl2F2
or, in fractional form:
58.64 g Cl
100 g CCl2F2  or  
100 g CCl2F2
58.64 g Cl

Chapter 3  Molecules, Compounds, and Chemical Equations
Conversion Factors from Chemical Formulas
Mass percent composition is one way to understand how much chlorine is in a particular 
chlorofluorocarbon or, more generally, how much of a constituent element is present in 
a given mass of any compound. However, we can also approach this type of problem in 
a different way. Chemical formulas contain within them inherent relationships between 
atoms (or moles of atoms) and molecules (or moles of molecules). For example, the for-
mula for CCl2F2 tells us that 1 mol of CCl2F2 contains 2 mol of Cl atoms. We write the 
ratio as:
1 mol CCl2F2 : 2 mol Cl
With ratios such as these—which come from the chemical formula—we can directly 
determine the amounts of the constituent elements present in a given amount of a com-
pound without having to calculate mass percent composition. For example, we calculate 
the number of moles of Cl in 38.5 mol of CCl2F2 as follows:
Conceptual Plan
mol Cl
mol CCl2F2
 2 mol Cl
1 mol CCl2F2
Solution
38.5 mol CCl2F2 *
2 mol Cl
1 mol CCl2F2
= 77.0 mol Cl
As we have seen, however, we often want to know, not the amount in moles of an ele-
ment in a certain number of moles of compound, but the mass in grams (or other units) 
of a constituent element in a given mass of the compound. Suppose we want to know 
the mass (in grams) of Cl in 25.0 g CCl2F2. The relationship inherent in the chemical 
formula (2 mol Cl : 1 mol CCl2F2) applies to the amount in moles, not to mass. There-
fore, we first convert the mass of CCl2F2 to moles CCl2F2. Then we use the conversion 
factor from the chemical formula to convert to moles Cl. Finally, we use the molar mass 
of Cl to convert to grams Cl.
Conceptual Plan
g Cl
mol Cl
mol CCl2F2
g CCl2F2
 1 mol CCl2F2
120.91 g CCl2F2
 2 mol Cl
1 mol CCl2F2

1 mol Cl
Solution
25.0 g CCl2F2 *
1 mol CCl2F2
120.91 g CCl2F2
*
2 mol Cl
1 mol CCl2F2
*
35.45 g Cl
1 mol Cl
= 14.7 g Cl
Notice that we must convert from g CCl2F2 to mol CCl2F2 before we can use the 
chemical formula as a conversion factor. Always remember that the chemical formula 
­indicates the relationship between the amounts (in moles) of substances, not between the 
masses (in grams) of them.
The general form for solving problems in which we need to find the mass of an ele-
ment present in a given mass of a compound is:
Mass  compound ¡ moles  compound ¡ moles  element ¡ mass  element 
We use the atomic or molar mass to convert between mass and moles, and we use rela-
tionships inherent in the chemical to convert between moles and moles.

Hydrogen may be used in the future to replace gasoline as a fuel. Most major automobile companies are developing 
vehicles that run on hydrogen. These cars have the potential to be less environmentally harmful than our current

Chemistry and Medicine | Methylmercury in Fish
I
n the last decade, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has grown in-
creasingly concerned about mercury levels in fish. Mercury—which is present in fish 
as methylmercury—affects the central nervous system of humans who eat the fish, 
especially children and developing fetuses. In a developing fetus, excessive mercury 
exposure can result in slowed mental development and even retardation. Some lakes 
now have warnings about eating too much fish caught in the lakes.
Recent regulations force fish vendors to alert customers about the dangers of 
eating too much of certain kinds of commercial fish, including shark, tuna, and mack-
erel. These fish tend to contain high levels of methylmercury and therefore should be 
eaten in moderation, especially by children and pregnant women. The U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) action level—the level below which the FDA claims the food 
has no adverse health effects—for methylmercury in fish is 1.0 ppm or 1.0 g of 
methylmercury per million grams of fish. However, a number of environmental advoca-
cy groups, including the EPA, have suggested that, while this level may be safe for 
adults, it is too high for children and pregnant women. Consequently, the FDA sug-
gests that pregnant women limit their intake of fish to 12 ounces per week.
Question
The levels of methylmercury in fish are normally tested by laboratory techniques that 
measure only the mercury (Hg). Suppose a lab analyzes a 14.5 g sample of fish and 
finds that it contains 1.03 * 10 - 5 g of mercury. How much methylmercury (HgCH3Cl) is 
in the fish in parts per million (ppm)? Is this above the FDA action level?
▲ Lakes containing mercury—
either from natural sources or from 
pollution—often have posted limits for 
the number of fish from the lake that 
can be eaten safely.
	 3.10	 Determining a Chemical Formula from 
Experimental Data
In Section 3.8, we calculated mass percent composition from a chemical formula. Can we 
also do the reverse? Can we calculate a chemical formula from mass percent composition? 
This question is important because many laboratory analyses of compounds list the rela-
tive masses of each element present in the compound. For example, if we decompose water 
into hydrogen and oxygen in the laboratory, we can measure the masses of hydrogen and 
oxygen produced. Can we determine a chemical formula from this data? The answer is a 
qualified yes. We can determine a chemical formula, but it is an empirical formula (not a 
molecular formula). To get a molecular formula, we need additional information, such as 
the molar mass of the compound.
Suppose we decompose a sample of water in the laboratory and find that it produces 
0.857 g of hydrogen and 6.86 g of oxygen. How do we determine an empirical formula from 
these data? We know that an empirical formula represents a ratio of atoms or a ratio of 
moles of atoms, not a ratio of masses. So the first thing we must do is convert our data from 
mass (in grams) to amount (in moles). How many moles of each element are present in the 
sample? To convert to moles, we divide each mass by the molar mass of that element:
 Moles H = 0.857  g H * 1 mol H
1.01  g H = 0.849 mol H
 Moles O = 6.86  g O *
1 mol O
16.00  g O = 0.429 mol O
From these data, we know there are 0.849 mol H for every 0.429 mol O. We can now 
write a pseudoformula for water:
H0.849O0.429
To get the smallest whole-number subscripts in our formula, we divide all the subscripts 
by the smallest one, in this case 0.429:
H0.849
0.429
O0.429
0.429
= H1.98O = H2O

	
3.10  Determining a Chemical Formula from Experimental Data

Our empirical formula for water, which also happens to be the molecular formula, is 
H2O. You can use the procedure shown here to obtain the empirical formula of any 
compound from experimental data giving the relative masses of the constituent ele-

Chapter 3  Molecules, Compounds, and Chemical Equations
Determining Molecular Formulas for Compounds
We can find the molecular formula of a compound from the empirical formula if we also 
know the molar mass of the compound. Recall from Section 3.3 that the molecular for-
mula is always a whole-number multiple of the empirical formula:
Molecular formula = empirical formula * n, where n = 1, 2, 3,...
Suppose we want to find the molecular formula for fructose (a sugar found in fruit) 
from its empirical formula, CH2O, and its molar mass, 180.2 g>mol. We know that the 
molecular formula is a whole-number multiple of CH2O:
 Molecular formula = (CH2O) * n
 = CnH2nOn
We also know that the molar mass is a whole-number multiple of the empirical for-
mula molar mass, the sum of the masses of all the atoms in the empirical formula.
Molar mass = empirical formula molar mass * n
For a particular compound, the value of n in both cases is the same. Therefore, we can 
find n by calculating the ratio of the molar mass to the empirical formula molar mass:
n =
molar mass
empirical formula molar mass
For fructose, the empirical formula molar mass is:
Empirical formula molar mass
= 12.01 g>mol + 2(1.01 g>mol) + 16.00 g>mol = 30.03 g>mol
Therefore, n is:
n =
180.2 g>mol
30.03 g>mol = 6
We can then use this value of n to find the molecular formula:
Molecular formula = (CH2O) * 6 = C6H12O6
Example 3.19	
Determining a Molecular Formula from an Empirical Formula and Molar Mass
Butanedione—the component responsible for the smell and taste of butter and cheese—contains the elements carbon, 
hydrogen, and oxygen. The empirical formula of butanedione is C2H3O, and its molar mass is 86.09 g>mol. Determine 
its molecular formula.
SORT  You are given the empirical formula 
and molar mass of butanedione and asked to 
find the molecular formula.
GIVEN:  Empirical formula = C2H3O
molar mass = 86.09 g>mol
FIND:  Molecular formula
STRATEGIZE  A molecular formula is always 
a whole-number multiple of the ­empirical 
formula. Divide the molar mass by the 
­empirical formula molar mass to find the 
whole number.
Molecular formula = empirical formula * n
n =
molar mass
empirical formula molar mass
SOLVE  Calculate the empirical formula mass.
Divide the molar mass by the empirical 
­formula mass to find n.
Multiply the empirical formula by n to obtain 
the molecular formula.
Empirical formula molar mass 
= 2(12.01 g>mol) + 3(1.008 g>mol) + 16.00 g>mol = 43.04 g>mol
n =
molar mass
empirical formula molar mass =
86.09 g>mol
43.04 g>mol = 2
 Molecular formula = C2H3O * 2
 = C4H6O2

Combustion Analysis
In the previous section, we discussed how to determine the empirical formula of a com-
pound from the relative masses of its constituent elements. Another common (and 
related) way to obtain empirical formulas for unknown compounds, especially those 
containing carbon and hydrogen, is combustion analysis. In combustion analysis, 
the unknown compound undergoes combustion (or burning) in the presence of pure 
oxygen, as shown in Figure 3.13▼. When the sample burns, all of the carbon converts 
to CO2, and all of the hydrogen converts to H2O. The CO2 and H2O are weighed. With 
these masses, we can use the numerical relationships between moles inherent in the for-
mulas for CO2 and H2O (1 mol CO2 : 1 mol C and 1 mol H2O : 2 mol H) to determine the 
amounts of C and H in the original sample. We can determine the amounts of any other 
elemental constituents, such as O, Cl, or N, by subtracting the sum of the masses of C 
and H from the original mass of the sample. Examples 20 and 21 illustrate how to per-
form these calculations for a sample containing only C and H and for a sample contain-
ing C, H, and O.
Combustion is a type of chemical 
reaction. We discuss chemical 
reactions and their representation in 
Section 3.11.
CHECK  Check the answer by calculating the molar mass of the formula as follows:
4(12.01 g>mol) + 6(1.008 g>mol) + 2(16.00 g>mol) = 86.09 g>mol
The calculated molar mass is in agreement with the given molar mass.

	 3.11	 Writing and Balancing Chemical 
Equations
Combustion analysis (which we just examined in Section 3.10) employs a chemical 
­reaction, a process in which one or more substances are converted into one or more dif-
ferent ones. Compounds form and change through chemical reactions. For example, water 
is formed by the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen. A combustion reaction is a par-
ticular type of chemical reaction in which a substance combines with oxygen to form one 
or more oxygen-containing compounds. Combustion reactions also emit heat. The heat 
produced in a number of combustion reactions is critical to supplying our society’s energy 
needs. For example, the heat from the combustion of gasoline expands the gaseous com-
bustion products in a car engine’s cylinders, which push the pistons and propel the car. We 
use the heat released by the combustion of natural gas to cook food and to heat our homes.
We represent a chemical reaction with a chemical equation. For example, we rep-
resent the combustion of natural gas with the equation:
CH4 + O2 ¡ CO2 + H2O
	
reactants	
products
The substances on the left side of the equation are the reactants, and the substances on 
the right side are the products. We often specify the states of each reactant or product 
in parentheses next to the formula as follows:
CH4(g) + O2(g) ¡ CO2(g) + H2O(g)
The (g) indicates that these substances are gases in the reaction. Table 3.5 summarizes 
the common states of reactants and products and their symbols used in chemical 
equations.
The equation just presented for the combustion of natural gas is not complete, how-
ever. If we look closely, we can immediately spot a problem.
O2(g)
CH4(g) +
H2O(g)
CO2(g) +
2 O atoms  +  1 O atom = 
 
3 O atoms
2 O atoms
The left side of the equation has two oxygen atoms, while the right side has three. The 
reaction as written, therefore, violates the law of conservation of mass because an oxy-
gen atom formed out of nothing. Notice also that the left side has four hydrogen atoms, 
while the right side has only two.
O2(g)
CH4(g) +
H2O(g)
CO2(g) +
2 H atoms
4 H atoms
Two hydrogen atoms have vanished, again violating mass conservation. To correct 
these problems—that is, to write an equation that more closely represents what actually 
happens—we must balance the equation. We need to change the coefficients (the

bers, multiply all the subscripts by 
a small whole number to get whole-
number subscripts.

The correct empirical formula is 
C5H12.
The subscripts are whole numbers; 
no additional multiplication is 
needed. The correct empirical 
­formula is C10H12O.

numbers in front of the chemical formulas), not the subscripts (the numbers within the 
chemical formulas), to ensure that the number of each type of atom on the left side of 
the equation is equal to the number on the right side. New atoms do not form during a 
reaction, nor do atoms vanish—matter must be conserved.
When we add coefficients to the reactants and products to balance an equation, we 
change the number of molecules in the equation but not the kind of molecules. To bal-
ance the equation for the combustion of methane, we put the coefficient 2 before O2 in 
the reactants, and the coefficient 2 before H2O in the products.

2 O2(g)
CO2(g)

+
2 H2O(g)
The equation is now balanced because the numbers of each type of atom on either 
side of the equation are equal. The balanced equation tells us that one CH4 molecule 
reacts with two O2 molecules to form one CO2 molecule and two H2O molecules. We 
verify that the equation is balanced by summing the number of each type of atom on 
each side of the equation.
CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) ¡ CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)
Reactants
Products
1 C atom (1 * cH4)
1 C atom (1 * co2)
4 H atoms (1 * cH4)
4 H atoms (2 * H2o)
4 O atoms (2 * o2)
4 O atoms (1 * co2 + 2 * H2o)
The number of each type of atom on both sides of the equation is now equal—the equa-
tion is balanced.
We can balance many chemical equations simply by trial and error. However, some 
guidelines are useful. For example, balancing the atoms in the most complex substances 
first and the atoms in the simplest substances (such as pure elements) last often makes 
the process shorter. The following examples of how to balance chemical equations are 
presented in a two- or three-column format. The general guidelines are shown on the 
left, with the application of the guidelines on the right. This procedure is meant only as 
a flexible guide, not a rigid set of steps.
We cannot change the subscripts 
when balancing a chemical equation 
because changing the subscripts 
changes the substance itself, while 
changing the coefficients changes 
the number of molecules of the 
substance. For example, 2 H20 is 
simply two water molecules, but H202
is hydrogen peroxide, a drastically 
different compound.

	 3.12	 Organic Compounds
Early chemists divided compounds into two types: organic and inorganic. They des-
ignated organic compounds as those that originate from living things. Sugar—from 
sugar-cane or the sugar beet—is a common example of an organic compound. Inorganic 
compounds, on the other hand, originate from the earth. Salt—mined from the ground 
or from the ocean—is a common example of an inorganic compound.
Not only did early chemists view organic and inorganic compounds as different in 
their origin, but also they recognized organic and inorganic compounds to be different 
in their properties. Organic compounds are easily decomposed. Inorganic compounds, 
however, are typically more difficult to decompose. Eighteenth-century chemists could 
synthesize inorganic compounds in the laboratory, but they could not synthesize 
organic compounds. This was considered to be another great difference between the 
two different types of compounds. Today, chemists can synthesize both organic and 
inorganic compounds, and even though organic chemistry is a subfield of chemistry, 
the differences between organic and inorganic compounds are now viewed as primarily 
organizational (not fundamental).
Organic compounds are common in everyday substances. Many smells—such as 
those in perfumes, spices, and foods—are caused by organic compounds. When you 
sprinkle cinnamon onto your French toast, some cinnamaldehyde—an organic com-
pound present in cinnamon—evaporates into the air. As you inhale cinnamaldehyde 
molecules, you experience the unique smell of cinnamon. Organic compounds are the 
major components of living organisms. They are also the main components of most 
fuels, such as gasoline, oil, and natural gas, and they are the active ingredients in most 
pharmaceuticals, such as aspirin and ibuprofen.
Organic compounds are composed of carbon and hydrogen and a few other ele-
ments, including nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. The key element in organic chemistry, 
however, is carbon. In its compounds, carbon always forms four bonds. The simplest 
organic compound is methane, or CH4.

compounds, which is why a general survey of organic chemistry is a yearlong course.
Hydrocarbons
We can begin to scratch the surface of organic chemistry by categorizing organic com-
pounds into types: hydrocarbons and functionalized hydrocarbons.
Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. 
Hydrocarbons compose common fuels such as oil, gasoline, liquid propane gas, and nat-
ural gas. Hydrocarbons containing only single bonds are alkanes, while those contain-
ing double or triple bonds are alkenes and alkynes, respectively. The names of simple, 
straight-chain hydrocarbons consist of a base name, which is determined by the number 
of carbon atoms in the chain, and a suffix, determined by whether the hydrocarbon is an 
alkane (-ane), alkene (-ene), or alkyne (-yne).

The term functional group derives 
from the functionality or chemical 
character that a specific atom or 
group of atoms imparts to an organic 
compound. Even a carbon–carbon 
double bond can justifiably be called a 
“functional group.”
The base names for a number of hydrocarbons are listed here:
meth = 1
 
hex = 6
eth = 2
 
hept = 7
prop = 3
 
oct = 8
but = 4
 
non = 9
pent = 5
 
dec = 10

Functionalized Hydrocarbons
Functionalized hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons in which a functional group—a char-
acteristic atom or group of atoms—is incorporated into the hydrocarbon. For example, 
alcohols are organic compounds that have an ¬ OH functional group. We designate the 
hydrocarbon portion of a molecule as “R,” and we write the general formula for an alcohol

A group of organic compounds with the same functional group forms a family. Metha-
nol and isopropyl alcohol are both members of the alcohol family of compounds.
The addition of a functional group to a hydrocarbon usually alters the properties of 
the compound significantly. Take methanol, which can be thought of as methane with 
an ¬ OH group substituted for one of the hydrogen atoms. Methanol is a liquid at room 
temperature, whereas methane is a gas. Although each member of a family is unique, the 
common functional group bestows some chemical similarities on members of the same 
family. The names of functional groups have suffixes or endings unique to that func-
tional group. Alcohols, for example, always have names that end in -ol. Table 3.7 pro-
vides examples of some common functional groups, their general formulas, and their 
characteristic suffixes or endings.
▲ Rubbing alcohol is isopropyl 
alcohol.

Chapter 3  Molecules, Compounds, and Chemical Equations
Key Concepts
Chemical Bonds (3.2)
▶
▶Chemical bonds, the forces that hold atoms together in com-
pounds, arise from the interactions between nuclei and electrons 
in atoms.
▶
▶In an ionic bond, one or more electrons are transferred from one 
atom to another, forming a cation (positively charged) and an 
anion (negatively charged). The two ions are drawn together by 
the attraction between the opposite charges.
▶
▶In a covalent bond, one or more electrons are shared between two 
atoms. The atoms are held together by the attraction between 
their nuclei and the shared electrons.
Representing Molecules and Compounds (3.3, 3.4)
▶
▶A compound is represented with a chemical formula, which indi-
cates the elements present and the number of atoms of each.
▶
▶An empirical formula gives only the relative number of atoms, 
while a molecular formula gives the actual number of atoms pres-
ent in the molecule.
▶
▶Structural formulas show how atoms are bonded together, while 
molecular models portray the geometry of the molecule.
▶
▶Compounds can be divided into two types: molecular com-
pounds, formed between two or more covalently bonded 
nonmetals, and ionic compounds, usually formed between a 
metal ionically bonded to one or more nonmetals. The smallest 
identifiable unit of a molecular compound is a molecule, and the 
smallest identifiable unit of an ionic compound is a formula unit: 
the smallest electrically neutral collection of ions.
▶
▶Elements can also be divided into two types: molecular elements, 
which occur as (mostly diatomic) molecules, and atomic ele-
ments, which occur as individual atoms.
Naming Inorganic Ionic and Molecular Compounds 
and Acids (3.5–3.7)
▶
▶A flowchart for naming simple inorganic compounds is provided 
in Section 3.7.
Formula Mass and Mole Concept for Compounds 
(3.8)
▶
▶The formula mass of a compound is the sum of the atomic masses 
of all the atoms in the chemical formula. Like the atomic masses 
of elements, the formula mass characterizes the average mass of a 
molecule (or a formula unit).
▶
▶The mass of one mole of a compound is the molar mass of that 
compound and equals its formula mass (in grams).
Chemical Composition (3.9, 3.10)
▶
▶The mass percent composition of a compound indicates each ele-
ment’s percentage of the total compound’s mass. We can deter-
mine the mass percent composition from the compound’s chemi-
cal formula and the molar masses of its elements.
▶
▶The chemical formula of a compound provides the relative 
number of atoms (or moles) of each element in a compound, 
and we can therefore use it to determine numerical relation-
ships between moles of the compound, and moles of its 
constituent elements. We can extend this relationship to mass 
by using the molar masses of the compound and its constitu-
ent elements.
▶
▶If the mass percent composition and molar mass of a com-
pound are known, we can determine its empirical and molecu-
lar formulas.
Writing and Balancing Chemical Equations (3.11)
▶
▶In chemistry, we represent chemical reactions with chemical 
equations. The substances on the left-hand side of a chemical 
equation are the reactants, and the substances on the right-hand 
side are the products.
▶
▶Chemical equations are balanced when the number of each type 
of atom on the left side of the equation is equal to the number on 
the right side.
Organic Compounds (3.12)
▶
▶Organic compounds are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and a few 
other elements such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur.
▶
▶The simplest organic compounds are hydrocarbons, compounds 
composed of only carbon and hydrogen.
▶
▶Hydrocarbons are categorized into three types based on the 
bonds they contain: alkanes contain single bonds, alkenes con-
tain double bonds, and alkynes contain triple bonds.
▶
▶All other organic compounds can be thought of as hydrocarbons 
with one or more functional groups—characteristic atoms or 
groups of atoms.
▶
▶Common functionalized hydrocarbons include alcohols, ethers, 
aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, and amines.

Ionic and Molecular Compounds
3.5	
Choice (a) best describes the difference between ionic and mo-
lecular compounds. Answer (b) is incorrect because there are 
no “new” forces in bonding (just rearrangements that result in 
lower potential energy) and because ions do not group togeth-
er in pairs in the solid phase. Answer (c) is incorrect because 
the main difference between ionic and molecular compounds 
is the way that the atoms bond. Answer (d) is incorrect be-
cause ionic compounds do not contain molecules.
Nomenclature
3.6	
This conceptual connection addresses one of the main errors 
you can make in nomenclature: the failure to correctly catego-
rize the compound. Remember that you must first determine 
whether the compound is an ionic compound, a molecular 
compound, or an acid, and then you must name it according-
ly. NCl3 is a molecular compound (two or more nonmetals), 
and therefore in its name prefixes indicate the number of each 
type of atom—so NCl3 is nitrogen trichloride. The compound 
AlCl3, however, is an ionic compound (metal and nonmetal), 
and therefore does not require prefixes—so AlCl3 is aluminum 
chloride.
Molecular Models and the Size of Molecules
3.7	
(c) Atomic radii range in the hundreds of picometers, while 
the spheres in these models have radii of about a centimeter. 
The scaling factor is therefore about 108 (100 million).
Chemical Formula and Mass Percent Composition
3.8	
C 7 O 7 H Since carbon and oxygen differ in atomic mass 
by only 4 amu, and since there are six carbon atoms in the 
formula, we can conclude that carbon constitutes the great-
est fraction of the mass. Oxygen is next because its mass is  
16 times that of hydrogen and there are only six hydrogen at-
oms for every one oxygen atom.
Chemical Formulas and Elemental Composition
3.9	
(c) The chemical formula for a compound gives relationships 
between atoms or moles of atoms. The chemical formula for wa-
ter states that water molecules contain two H atoms to every 
one O atom or 2 mol H to every 1 mol H2O. This does not im-
ply a two-to-one relationship between masses of hydrogen and 
oxygen because these atoms have different masses. It also does 
not imply a two-to-one relationship between volumes.
Balanced Chemical Equations
3.10	 Both (a) and (d) are correct. When the number of atoms 
of each type is balanced, the sum of the masses of the sub-
stances will be the same on both sides of the equation. Since 
molecules change during a chemical reaction, the number of 
molecules is not the same on both sides, nor is the number of 
moles necessarily the same.

I feel sorry for people who don’t know 
anything about chemistry. They are  
missing an important source of happiness.
—Linus Pauling (1901–1994)

T
he amount of product formed in a chemical reaction is related to the amount of 
reactant that reacts. This concept makes sense intuitively, but how can we describe 
and understand this relationship more fully? The first half of this chapter focuses 
on chemical stoichiometry—the numerical relationships between the amounts of reac-
tants and products in chemical reactions. In Chapter 3, you learned how to write bal-
anced chemical equations for chemical reactions. Here we examine more closely the 
meaning of those balanced equations. In the second half of this chapter, we turn to de-
scribing chemical reactions that occur in water. You have probably witnessed many of 
these types of reactions in your daily life because they are so common. Have you ever 
mixed baking soda with vinegar and observed the subsequent bubbling or noticed the 
hard water deposits that form on plumbing fixtures? These reactions—and many others, 
including those that occur within the watery environment of living cells—are aqueous 
chemical reactions, the subject of the second half of this chapter.

Climate Change and the Combustion  
of Fossil Fuels
The temperature outside my office today is a cool 48 °F, lower than normal for this 
time of year on the California coast. However, today’s “chill” pales in comparison 
with how cold it would be without the presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

One of the products, carbon 
dioxide, is the main greenhouse 
gas implicated in global climate 
change.

Chapter 4  Chemical Quantities and Aqueous Reactions
These gases act like the glass of a greenhouse, allowing sunlight to enter the atmo-
sphere and warm Earth’s surface but preventing some of the heat generated by the 
sunlight from escaping, as shown in Figure 4.1▲. The balance between incoming and 
outgoing energy from the sun determines Earth’s average temperature.
If the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were not present, more heat energy would 
escape, and Earth’s average temperature would be about 60 °F colder than it currently is. The 
temperature outside of my office today would be below 0 °F, and even the sunniest U.S. cities 
would most likely be covered with snow. However, if the concentration of greenhouse gases 
in the atmosphere were to increase, Earth’s average temperature would rise.
In recent decades scientists have become increasingly concerned because the quan-
tity of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)—Earth’s most significant greenhouse gas—is 
rising. More CO2 enhances the atmosphere’s ability to hold heat and is believed to lead 
to global warming, an increase in Earth’s average temperature. Since 1860, atmospheric 
CO2 levels have risen by 38% (Figure 4.2▼), and Earth’s average temperature has risen by 
about 1.2 °F (0.7 °C) (as shown in Figure 4.3▼).
Most scientists believe that the primary cause of rising atmospheric CO2 concentra-
tion is the burning of fossil fuels (natural gas, petroleum, and coal), which provides 90% 
of our society’s energy. Some people, however, have suggested that fossil fuel combus-
tion does not significantly contribute to global warming and climate change. They 
argue that the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere by natural 
sources, such as volcanic eruptions, far exceeds that from fossil fuel combustion. Which 
group is right? One way to judge the validity of the naysayers’ argument is by calculating 
how much carbon dioxide is emitted by fossil fuel combustion and comparing that 
amount to the amount released by volcanic eruptions.

Reaction Stoichiometry: How Much 
Carbon Dioxide?
The balanced chemical equations for fossil fuel combustion reactions provide the exact 
relationships between the amount of fossil fuel burned and the amount of carbon diox-
ide emitted. In this discussion, we use octane (a component of gasoline) as a representa-
tive fossil fuel. The balanced equation for the combustion of octane is:
2 C8H18(l) + 25 O2(g) ¡ 16 CO2(g) + 18 H2O(g)
The balanced equation shows that 16 CO2 molecules are produced for every two mole-
cules of octane burned. We can extend this numerical relationship between molecules 
to the amounts in moles as follows:
The coefficients in a chemical equation specify the relative amounts 
in moles of each of the substances involved in the reaction.
In other words, from the equation, we know that 16 moles of CO2 are produced for every 
two moles of octane burned. The numerical relationships between chemical amounts in 
a balanced chemical equation are called reaction stoichiometry. Stoichiometry allows 
us to predict the amounts of products that will form in a chemical reaction based on the 
amounts of reactants that react. Stoichiometry also allows us to determine the amount 
of reactants necessary to form a given amount of product. These calculations are central 
to chemistry, allowing chemists to plan and carry out chemical reactions to obtain prod-
ucts in the desired quantities.
Making Pizza: The Relationships among Ingredients
The concepts of stoichiometry are similar to a cooking recipe. Calculating the amount 
of carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of a given amount of a fossil fuel is anal-
ogous to calculating the number of pizzas that can be made from a given amount of 
cheese. For example, suppose we use the following pizza recipe:
1 crust + 5 ounces tomato sauce + 2 cups cheese ¡ 1 pizza
The recipe contains the numerical relationships between the pizza ingredients. It says 
that if we have two cups of cheese—and enough of everything else—we can make one 
pizza. We can write this relationship as a ratio between the cheese and the pizza:
2 cups cheese : 1 pizza
What if we have six cups of cheese? Assuming that we have enough of everything else, 
we can use the ratio as a conversion factor to calculate the number of pizzas:
6 cups cheese *
1 pizza
2 cups cheese = 3 pizzas
Six cups of cheese are sufficient to make three pizzas. The pizza recipe contains numeri-
cal ratios between other ingredients as well, including the crust and the tomato sauce:
1 crust : 1 pizza
5 ounces tomato sauce : 1 pizza
Making Molecules: Mole-to-Mole Conversions
In a balanced chemical equation, we have a “recipe” for how reactants combine to form 
products. From our balanced equation for the combustion of octane, for example, we 
can write the following stoichiometric ratio:
2 mol C8H18 : 16 mol CO2
We can use this ratio to determine how many moles of CO2 form when a given number of 
moles of C8H18 burns. Suppose that we burn 22.0 moles of C8H18; how many moles of 
Stoichiometry is pronounced  
stoy-kee-AHM-e-tree.
Reaction Stoichiometry

142	
Chapter 4  Chemical Quantities and Aqueous Reactions
CO2 form? We use the ratio from the balanced chemical equation in the same way that we 
used the ratio from the pizza recipe. The ratio acts as a conversion factor between the 
amount in moles of the reactant (C8H18) and the amount in moles of the product (CO2):
22.0 mol C8H18 * 16 mol CO2
2 mol C8H18
= 176 mol CO2
The combustion of 22.0 moles of C8H18 adds 176 moles of CO2 to the atmosphere.
Making Molecules: Mass-to-Mass Conversions
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the world burned 3.3 * 1010 barrels of 
petroleum in 2013, the equivalent of approximately 3.7 * 1015 g of gasoline. We can 
estimate the mass of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere from burning this much gasoline 
using the combustion of 3.7 * 1015 g octane as the representative reaction. This calcu-
lation is similar to the one we just did, except that we are now given the mass of octane 
instead of the amount of octane in moles. Consequently, we must first convert the mass 
(in grams) to the amount (in moles). The general conceptual plan for calculations in 
which we are given the mass of a reactant or product in a chemical reaction and asked to 
find the mass of a different reactant or product takes the form:
Amount B
(in moles)
Amount A
(in moles)
Mass A
Mass B
where A and B are two different substances involved in the reaction.
We use the molar mass of A to convert from the mass of A to the amount of A (in 
moles). We use the appropriate ratio from the balanced chemical equation to convert 
from the amount of A (in moles) to the amount of B (in moles). And finally, we use the 
molar mass of B to convert from the amount of B (in moles) to the mass of B. To calculate 
the mass of CO2 emitted upon the combustion of 3.7 * 1015 g of octane, we use the fol-
lowing conceptual plan:
Conceptual Plan

16 mol CO2
2 mol C8H18
1 mol C8H18
114.22 g C8H18

1 mol CO2
Relationships Used
2 mol C8H18 : 16 mol CO2 (from the chemical equation)
molar mass C8H18 = 114.22 g>mol
molar mass CO2 = 44.01 g>mol
Solution
We follow the conceptual plan to solve the problem, beginning with g C8H18 and  
canceling units to arrive at g CO2:
3.7 * 1015 g C8H18 *
1 mol C8H18
114.22 g C8H18
*
16 mol CO2
2 mol C8H18
*
44.01 g CO2
1 mol CO2
= 1.1 * 1016 g CO2
The world’s petroleum combustion produces 1.1 * 1016 g CO2 (1.1 * 1013 kg)  per 
year. In comparison, volcanoes produce about 2 * 1011 kg CO2 per year.* In other 
words, volcanoes emit only 
2 * 1011 kg
1.1 * 1013 kg
* 100% = 1.8% as much CO2 per year as  
*Gerlach, T. M., Present-day CO2 emissions from volcanoes. Eos, Transactions, American Geophysical 
Union. 1991 72, 249, 254–255.
The percentage of Co2 emitted by 
volcanoes relative to all fossil fuels 
is even less than 1.8% because the 
combustion of coal and natural gas 
also emits Co2.

petroleum combustion. The argument that volcanoes emit more carbon dioxide than 
fossil fuel combustion is clearly mistaken. Examples 4.1 and 4.2 provide additional prac-
tice with stoichiometric calculations.
Example 4.1

6 CO2(g) + 6 H2O(l) ˚˚˚˚
 "
sunlight  6 O2(g) + C6H12O6(aq)
Suppose that a particular plant consumes 37.8 g of CO2 in one week. Assuming that there is more than enough water  
present to react with all of the CO2, what mass of glucose (in grams) can the plant synthesize from the CO2?
SORT  The problem provides 
the mass of carbon dioxide  
and asks you to find the  
mass of glucose that can be  
produced.
GIVEN:  37.8 g CO2
FIND:  g C6H12O6
STRATEGIZE  The conceptual 
plan follows the general pat-
tern of mass A S  amount A 
(in moles) S  amount B (in 
moles) S  mass B. From the 
chemical equation, deduce the 
relationship between moles of 
carbon dioxide and moles of 
glucose. Use the molar masses 
to convert between grams and 
moles.

SOLVE  Follow the conceptual 
plan to solve the problem. 
Begin with g CO2 and use the 
conversion factors to arrive at 
g C6H12O6.
SOLUTION

44.01 g CO2
* 1 mol C6H12O6
6 mol CO2
*
180.2 g C6H12O6
1 mol C6H12O6
= 25.8 g C6H12O6
CHECK  The units of the answer are correct. The magnitude of the answer (25.8 g) is less than the initial mass of CO2 
(37.8  g). This is reasonable because each carbon in CO2 has two oxygen atoms associated with it, while in C6H12O6 each 
carbon has only one oxygen atom associated with it and two hydrogen atoms, which are much lighter than oxygen. 
Therefore, the mass of glucose produced should be less than the mass of carbon dioxide for this reaction.
For Practice 4.1  Magnesium hydroxide, the active ingredient in milk of magnesia, neutralizes stomach acid,  
primarily HCl, according to the reaction:
Mg(OH)2(aq) + 2 HCl(aq) ¡ 2 H2O(l) + MgCl2(aq)

SORT  The problem gives the mass

STRATEGIZE  The conceptual plan 
follows the standard format of  
mass S  amount (in moles) S  
amount (in moles) S  mass. Since 
the original quantity of SO2 is 
given in kilograms, you must first 
convert to grams. You can deduce 
the relationship between moles of 
sulfur dioxide and moles of sulfuric 
acid from the chemical equation. 
Since the final quantity is requested 
in kilograms, convert to kilograms 
at the end.

SOLVE  Follow the conceptual 
plan to solve the problem. Begin 
with the given amount of SO2 in 
kilograms and use the conversion 
factors to arrive at kg H2SO4.

1000 g = 38 kg H2SO4
CHECK  The units of the final answer are correct. The magnitude of the final answer (38 kg H2SO4)  is larger than the 
amount of SO2 given (25 kg). This is reasonable because in the reaction each SO2 molecule “gains weight” by reacting with 
O2 and H2O.
For Practice 4.2  Another component of acid rain is nitric acid, which forms when NO2, also a pollutant, reacts with 
oxygen and water according to the simplified equation:
4 NO2(g) + O2(g) + 2 H2O(l) ¡ 4 HNO3(aq)
The generation of the electricity used by a medium-sized home produces about 16 kg of NO2 per year. Assuming that 
there is adequate O2 and H2O, what mass of HNO3, in kg, can form from this amount of NO2 pollutant?

Let’s return to our pizza analogy to understand three more important concepts in reac-
tion stoichiometry: limiting reactant, theoretical yield, and percent yield. Recall our pizza 
recipe from Section 4.2:
1 crust + 5 ounces tomato sauce + 2 cups cheese ¡ 1 pizza
Suppose that we have four crusts, ten cups of cheese, and 15 ounces of tomato sauce. 
How many pizzas can we make?
We have enough crusts to make:
4 crusts *
1 pizza
1 crust = 4 pizzas
We have enough cheese to make:
10 cups cheese *
1 pizza
2 cups cheese = 5 pizzas
We have enough tomato sauce to make:
15 ounces tomato sauce ×
= 3 pizzas
1 pizza
5 ounces tomato sauce
Smallest number of pizzas
Limiting reactant
We have enough crusts for four pizzas and enough cheese for five pizzas, but enough 
tomato sauce for only three pizzas. Consequently, unless we get more ingredients, we 
can make only three pizzas. The tomato sauce limits how many pizzas we can make. If 
the pizza recipe were a chemical reaction, the tomato sauce would be the limiting 
reactant, the reactant that limits the amount of product in a chemical reaction.  
Notice that the limiting reactant is the reactant that makes the least amount of product. 
The term limiting reagent is sometimes 
used in place of limiting reactant.

Chapter 4  Chemical Quantities and Aqueous Reactions
The reactants that do not limit the amount of product—such as the crusts and the 
cheese in this example—are said to be in excess. If this were a chemical reaction, three 
pizzas would be the theoretical yield, the maximum amount of product that can be 
made in a chemical reaction based on the amount of limiting reactant.
Let us carry this analogy one step further. Suppose we go on to cook our pizzas and 
accidentally burn one of them. Even though we theoretically have enough ingredients 
for three pizzas, we end up with only two. If this were a chemical reaction, the two pizzas 
would be our actual yield, the amount of product actually produced by a chemical reac-
tion. (The actual yield is always equal to or less than the theoretical yield because a small 
amount of product is usually lost to other reactions or does not form during a reaction.) 
Finally, our percent yield, the percentage of the theoretical yield that was actually 
attained, is calculated as the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield:

100% = 67%

Since one of our pizzas burned, our percent yield for pizzas is 67%.
Summarizing Limiting Reactant and Yield:
▶
▶
The limiting reactant (or limiting reagent) is the reactant that is completely 
consumed in a chemical reaction and limits the amount of product.
▶
▶
The reactant in excess is any reactant that occurs in a quantity greater than is 
required to completely react with the limiting reactant.
▶
▶
The theoretical yield is the amount of product that can be made in a chemical 
reaction based on the amount of limiting reactant.
▶
▶
The actual yield is the amount of product actually produced by a chemical  
reaction.
▶
▶
The percent yield is calculated as 
actual yield
theoretical yield * 100%.
Calculating Limiting Reactant, Theoretical Yield,  
and Percent Yield
We can apply these concepts to a chemical reaction. Recall from Section 3.11 our bal-
anced equation for the combustion of methane:
CH4(g) + 2 O2(g)
CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)
If we start out with five CH4 molecules and eight O2 molecules, what is our limiting 
reactant? What is our theoretical yield of carbon dioxide molecules? First we calculate 
the number of CO2 molecules that can be made from five CH4 molecules:
5 CH4 × 1 CH4
1 CO2
= 5 CO2

	
4.3  Limiting Reactant, Theoretical Yield, and Percent Yield

We then calculate the number of CO2 molecules that can be made from eight O2 
molecules:
8 O2 ×
2 O2
1 CO2
= 4 CO2

Least amount
of product
We have enough CH4 to make five CO2 molecules and enough O2 to make four CO2 
molecules; therefore, O2 is the limiting reactant, and four CO2 molecules is the theoreti-
cal yield. The CH4 is in excess.
An alternative way to calculate the limiting reactant (which we describe here but do 
not use again in this book) is to pick any reactant and determine how much of the other 
reactant is necessary to completely react with it. For the reaction we just examined, we 
have five CH4 molecules and eight O2 molecules. Let’s pick the five CH4 molecules and 
determine how many O2 molecules are necessary to completely react with them:
5 CH4 *
2 O2
1 CH4
= 10 O2
Since we need ten O2 molecules to completely react with the five CH4 molecules, and 
since we have only eight O2 molecules, we know that the O2 is the limiting reactant. The 
same method can be applied by comparing the amounts of reactants in moles.

Calculating Limiting Reactant, Theoretical Yield,  
and Percent Yield from Initial Reactant Masses
When working in the laboratory, we normally measure the initial quantities of reactants 
in grams, not in number of molecules. To find the limiting reactant and theoretical yield 
from initial masses, we must first convert the masses to amounts in moles. Consider the 
reaction:
2 Mg(s) + O2(g) ¡ 2 MgO(s)
A reaction mixture contains 42.5 g Mg and 33.8 g O2; what is the limiting reactant and 
theoretical yield?
To solve this problem, we must determine which of the reactants makes the least 
amount of product.

Chapter 4  Chemical Quantities and Aqueous Reactions
Conceptual Plan
We can find the limiting reactant by calculating how much product can be made from 
each reactant. However, we are given the initial quantities in grams, and stoichiometric 
relationships are between moles, so we must first convert to moles. We then convert 
from moles of the reactant to moles of product. The reactant that makes the least amount 
of product is the limiting reactant. The conceptual plan is:
g Mg

mol MgO
2 mol MgO

g O2
mol O2
mol MgO
2 mol MgO
1 mol O2
1 mol O2
32.00 g O2
Smallest amount
determines limiting reactant.
In this conceptual plan, we compare the number of moles of MgO made by each reac-
tant and convert only the smaller amount to grams. (Alternatively, we can convert both 
quantities to grams and determine the limiting reactant based on the mass of the 
product.)
Relationships Used
molar mass Mg = 24.31 g>mol
molar mass O2 = 32.00 g>mol
2 mol Mg : 2 mol MgO
1 mol O2 : 2 mol MgO
molar mass MgO = 40.31 g>mol

how much product can be made from each:

reactant
Since Mg makes the least amount of product, it is the limiting reactant, and O2 is in 
excess. Notice that the limiting reactant is not necessarily the reactant with the least 
mass. In this case, the mass of O2 is less than the mass of Mg, yet Mg is the limiting reac-
tant because it makes the least amount of MgO. The theoretical yield is 70.5 g of MgO, 
the mass of product possible based on the limiting reactant.
Suppose that after the synthesis, the actual yield of MgO is 55.9 g. What is the per-
cent yield? We calculate the percent yield as follows:
% yield =
actual yield
theoretical yield * 100% =
55.9 g
70.5 g * 100% = 79.3%

Since NO makes the least amount of product, it is the limiting reactant, and the theo-

CHECK  The units of the answer (g NH3) are correct. The magnitude (49.0 g) seems reasonable given that 86.3 g NO is the 
limiting reactant. NO contains one oxygen atom per nitrogen atom and NH3 contains three hydrogen atoms per nitrogen 
atom. Since three hydrogen atoms have less mass than one oxygen atom, it is reasonable that the mass of NH3 obtained is 
less than the mass of NO.

	 4.4 	 Solution Concentration and Solution 
Stoichiometry
The reactions that occur in lakes, streams, and oceans, as well as the reactions that 
occur in every cell within our bodies, take place in water. Chemical reactions involv-
ing reactants dissolved in water are among the most common and important. A 
homogeneous mixture of two substances—such as salt and water—is a solution. 
The majority component of the mixture is the solvent, and the minority compo-
nent is the solute. An aqueous solution is one in which water acts as the solvent. 
In this section, we first examine how to quantify the concentration of a solution 
(the amount of solute relative to solvent) and then turn to applying the principles of 
stoichiometry, which we discussed in the previous section, to reactions occurring in 
­solution.
Solution Concentration
The amount of solute in a solution is variable. For example, we can add just a little salt to 
water to make a dilute solution, one that contains a small amount of solute relative to 
the solvent, or we can add a lot of salt to water to make a concentrated solution, one 
that contains a large amount of solute relative to the solvent (Figure 4.4▼). A common 
way to express solution concentration is molarity (M), the amount of solute (in moles) 
divided by the volume of solution (in liters):
Molarity (M) = amount of solute (in mol)
volume of solution (in L)
Notice that molarity is a ratio of the amount of solute per liter of solution, not per liter of 
solvent. To make an aqueous solution of a specified molarity, we usually put the solute 
into a flask and then add water to reach the desired volume of solution. For example,

to make 1 L of a 1 M NaCl solution, we add 1 mol of NaCl to a flask and then add enough 
water to make 1 L of solution (Figure 4.5▲). We do not combine 1 mol of NaCl with 1  L 
of water because the resulting solution would have a total volume different from 1  L 
and therefore a molarity different than 1 M. To calculate molarity, divide the amount of 
the solute in moles by the volume of the solution (solute and solvent) in liters, as shown 
in Example 4.5.

double-checked.

Using Molarity in Calculations
We can use the molarity of a solution as a conversion factor between moles of  
the solute and liters of the solution. For example, a 0.500 M NaCl solution contains 
0.500 moles NaCl for every liter of solution:
L solution

This conversion factor converts from liters solution to mole NaCl. If we want to convert 
in the other direction, we invert the conversion factor:

When diluting acids, always add 
the concentrated acid to the water. 
Never add water to concentrated 
acid solutions, as the heat generated 
may cause the concentrated acid to 
splatter and burn your skin.
Solution Dilution
To save space in storerooms, laboratories often store solutions in concentrated forms 
called stock solutions. For example, hydrochloric acid is frequently stored as a 12 M 
stock solution. However, many lab procedures call for much less concentrated hydro-
chloric acid solutions, so we must dilute the stock solution to the required concentra-
tion. How do we know how much of the stock solution to use? The easiest way to solve 
dilution problems is to use the following dilution equation:
	
M1V1 = M2V2 
[4.1]
where M1 and V1 are the molarity and volume of the initial concentrated solution, and 
M2 and V2 are the molarity and volume of the final diluted solution. This equation works 
because the molarity multiplied by the volume gives the number of moles of solute, 
which is the same in both solutions.
 M1V1 = M2V2
 mol1 = mol2
In other words, the number of moles of solute does not change when we dilute a 
solution.
For example, suppose a laboratory procedure calls for 3.00 L of a 0.500 M CaCl2 
solution. How should we prepare this solution from a 10.0 M stock solution? We solve 
Equation 4.1 for V1, the volume of the stock solution required for the dilution, and then 
substitute in the correct values to calculate it.
 M1V1 = M2V2
 V1 = M2V2
M1
 =
0.500 mol>L * 3.00 L
10.0 mol>L
 = 0.150 L
Consequently, we make the solution by diluting 0.150 L of the stock solution to a total 
volume of 3.00 L (V2). The resulting solution will be 0.500 M in CaCl2 (Figure 4.6▶).

CHECK  The final units (L) are correct. The magnitude of the answer is reasonable because the solution is diluted from 15.0 
M to 3.00 M, a factor of five. Therefore, the volume should increase by a factor of five.

Solution Stoichiometry
In Section 4.2 we discussed how we can use the coefficients in chemical equations as 
conversion factors between the amounts of reactants (in moles) and the amounts of 
products (in moles). In aqueous reactions, quantities of reactants and products are often 
specified in terms of volumes and concentrations. We can use the volume and con-
centration of a reactant or product to calculate its amount in moles. We can then use 
the stoichiometric coefficients in the chemical equation to convert to the amount of 
another reactant or product in moles. The general conceptual plan for these kinds of 
calculations begins with the volume of a reactant or product:
Volume A
Volume B
Amount A
(in moles)
Amount B
(in moles)
We make the conversions between solution volumes and amounts of solute in moles 
using the molarities of the solutions. We make the conversions between amounts in 
moles of A and B using the stoichiometric coefficients from the balanced chemical equa-
tion. Example 4.8 demonstrates solution stoichiometry.

stoichiometry requires 2 mol of KCl per mole of Pb(NO3)2. Since the concentrations of the two solutions are not very dif-

the problem.

Chapter 4  Chemical Quantities and Aqueous Reactions
	 4.5 	 Types of Aqueous Solutions and 
Solubility
Consider two familiar aqueous solutions: salt water and sugar water. Salt water is a 
homogeneous mixture of NaCl and H2O, and sugar water is a homogeneous mixture 
of C12H22O11 and H2O. You may have made these solutions yourself by adding table 
salt or sugar to water. As you stir either of these two substances into the water, the 
substance seems to disappear. However, you know that the original substance is still 
present because the mixture tastes salty or sweet. How do solids such as salt and sugar 
dissolve in water?
When a solid is put into a liquid solvent, the attractive forces that hold the solid 
together (the solute–solute interactions) compete with the attractive forces between 
the solvent molecules and the particles that compose the solid (the solvent–solute 
interactions), as shown in Figure 4.7◀. For example, when sodium chloride is put 
into water, there is a competition between the attraction of Na + cations and Cl - 
anions to each other (due to their opposite charges) and the attraction of Na + and 
Cl - to water molecules. The attraction of Na + and Cl - to water is based on the polar 
nature of the water molecule. For reasons we discuss later in this book (Section 9.6), 
the oxygen atom in water is electron-rich, giving it a partial negative charge (d -), as 
shown in Figure 4.8◀. The hydrogen atoms, in contrast, are electron-poor, giving 
them a partial positive charge (d +). As a result, the positively charged sodium ions are 
strongly attracted to the oxygen side of the water molecule (which has a partial nega-
tive charge), and the negatively charged chloride ions are attracted to the hydrogen 
side of the water molecule (which has a partial positive charge), as shown in Figure 
4.9▼. In the case of NaCl, the attraction between the separated ions and the water 
molecules overcomes the attraction of sodium and chloride ions to each other, and 
the sodium chloride dissolves in the water (Figure 4.10▼).
Electrolyte and Nonelectrolyte Solutions
As Figure 4.11▶ illustrates, a salt solution conducts electricity while a sugar solution does 
not. The difference between the ways that salt (an ionic compound) and sugar (a molec-
ular compound) dissolve in water illustrates a fundamental difference between types of

solutions. Ionic compounds such as the sodium chloride in the previous example dissociate 
into their component ions when they dissolve in water. An NaCl solution, represented as 
NaCl(aq), does not contain any NaCl units, but rather dissolved Na + ions and Cl - ions. The 
dissolved ions act as charge carriers, allowing the solution to conduct electricity. Substances 
that dissolve in water to form solutions that conduct electricity are electrolytes. Sub-
stances such as sodium chloride that completely dissociate into ions when they dissolve in 
water are strong electrolytes, and the resulting solutions are strong electrolyte solutions.
In contrast to sodium chloride, sugar is a molecular compound. Most molecular 
compounds—with the important exception of acids, which we discuss shortly—dissolve 
in water as intact molecules. Sugar dissolves because the attraction between sugar mole-
cules and water molecules (shown in Figure 4.12▼) overcomes the attraction of sugar 
molecules to each other (Figure 4.13▼). So unlike a sodium chloride solution

(which is composed of dissociated ions), a sugar solution is composed of intact C12H22O11 
molecules homogeneously mixed with the water molecules. Compounds such as sugar 
that do not dissociate into ions when dissolved in water are called nonelectrolytes, 
and the resulting solutions—called nonelectrolyte solutions—do not conduct electricity.
Acids, which we introduced in Section 3.6, are molecular compounds, but they 
do ionize—form ions—when they dissolve in water. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a 
molecular compound that ionizes into H + and Cl - when it dissolves in water. HCl is 
an example of a strong acid, one that completely ionizes in solution. Since strong 
acids completely ionize in solution, they are also strong electrolytes. We represent the 
complete ionization of a strong acid with a single reaction arrow between the acid 
and its ionized form:
HCl(aq) ¡ H +(aq) + Cl -(aq)
Many acids are weak acids; they do not completely ionize in water. For example, acetic 
acid (HC2H3O2), the acid in vinegar, is a weak acid. A solution of a weak acid is composed 
mostly of the nonionized acid—only a small percentage of the acid molecules ionize. 
We represent the partial ionization of a weak acid with opposing half arrows between 
the reactants and products:
HC2H3O2(aq) ∆H +(aq) + C2H3O2
-(aq)
Weak acids are weak electrolytes, and the resulting solutions—called weak electrolyte 
solutions—conduct electricity only weakly. Figure 4.14▼ summarizes the electrolytic 
properties of solutions.
The Solubility of Ionic Compounds
As we have just discussed, when an ionic compound dissolves in water, the result-
ing solution contains not the intact ionic compound itself, but its component ions  
dissolved in water. However, not all ionic compounds dissolve in water. If we add AgCl to

water, for example, it remains solid and appears as a white powder 
at the bottom of the water.
In general, a compound is termed soluble if it dissolves in 
water and insoluble if it does not. However, these classifications 
are a bit of an oversimplification. (In reality, solubility is a contin-
uum and even “insoluble” compounds dissolve to some extent, 
though usually orders of magnitude less than soluble com-
pounds.) For example, silver nitrate is soluble. If we mix solid 
AgNO3 with water, it dissolves and forms a strong electrolyte solu-
tion. Silver chloride, as we just saw, is almost completely insolu-
ble. If we mix solid AgCl with water, virtually all of it remains as a 
solid within the liquid water.
Whether a particular compound is soluble or insoluble depends on several factors. 
In Section 12.3, we will examine more closely the energy changes associated with solu-
tion formation. For now, we can follow a set of empirical rules that chemists have 
inferred from observations on many ionic compounds. Table 4.1 summarizes these solu-
bility rules.
The solubility rules state that compounds containing the sodium ion are soluble. 
That means that compounds such as NaBr, NaNO3, Na2SO4, NaOH, and Na2CO3 all dis-
solve in water to form strong electrolyte solutions. Similarly, the solubility rules state 
that compounds containing the NO3
- ion are soluble. That means that compounds 
such as AgNO3, Pb(NO3)2, NaNO3, Ca(NO3)2, and Sr(NO3)2 all dissolve in water to form 
strong electrolyte solutions.
Notice that when compounds containing polyatomic ions such as NO3
- dissolve, 
the polyatomic ions dissolve as intact units.
The solubility rules also state that, with some exceptions, compounds contain-
ing the CO3
2 - ion are insoluble. Therefore, compounds such as CuCO3, CaCO3, 
SrCO3, and FeCO3 do not dissolve in water. Note that the solubility rules contain 
many exceptions. For example, compounds containing CO3
2 - are soluble when 
paired with Li +, Na +, K +, or NH4
+. Thus Li2CO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3, and (NH4)2CO3 are 
all soluble.

Chapter 4  Chemical Quantities and Aqueous Reactions
	 4.6 	 Precipitation Reactions
Have you ever taken a bath in hard water? Hard water contains dissolved ions such as 
Ca2 + and Mg2 + that diminish the effectiveness of soap. These ions react with soap to 
form a gray curd that may appear as a “bathtub ring” after you drain the tub. Hard water 
is particularly troublesome when washing clothes. Consider how your white shirt would 
look covered with the gray curd from the bathtub and you can understand the problem. 
Consequently, most laundry detergents include substances designed to remove Ca2 + 
and Mg2 + from the laundry mixture. The most common substance used for this purpose 
is sodium carbonate, which dissolves in water to form sodium cations (Na +) and carbon-
ate (CO3
2 -) anions:
Na2CO3(aq) ¡ 2 Na +(aq) + CO3
2 -(aq)
Sodium carbonate is soluble, but calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate are not 
(see the solubility rules in Table 4.1). Consequently, the carbonate anions react with dis-
solved Mg2 + and Ca2 + ions in hard water to form solids that precipitate from (or come out 
of) solution:
Mg2 +(aq) + CO3
2 -(aq) ¡ MgCO3(s)
Ca2 +(aq) + CO3
2 -(aq)  ¡ CaCO3(s)
The precipitation of these ions prevents their reaction with the soap, eliminating curd 
and preventing white shirts from turning gray.
The reactions between CO3
2 - and Mg2 + and Ca2 + are examples of precipitation 
reactions, reactions in which a solid or precipitate forms when we mix two solu-
tions. Precipitation reactions are common in chemistry. As another example, consider 
potassium iodide and lead(II) nitrate, which form colorless, strong electrolyte solu-
tions when dissolved in water separately. When the two solutions are combined, how-
ever, a brilliant yellow precipitate forms (Figure 4.15▶). We describe this precipitation 
reaction with the following chemical equation:
2 KI(aq) + Pb(NO3)2(aq) ¡ PbI2(s) + 2 KNO3(aq)
Precipitation reactions do not always occur when two aqueous solutions are mixed. For 
example, if we combine solutions of KI(aq) and NaCl(aq), nothing happens (Figure 4.16▶, 
on page 164):
KI(aq) + NaCl(aq) ¡ NO REACTION
The key to predicting precipitation reactions is to understand that only insoluble 
compounds form precipitates. In a precipitation reaction, two solutions containing soluble 
compounds combine and an insoluble compound precipitates. Consider the precipita-
tion reaction described previously:
2 KI(aq)
soluble
+ Pb(NO3)2

that is visible after you drain the 
bathwater.

Molecular, Ionic, and Complete  
Ionic Equations
Consider the following equation for a precipitation reaction:
Pb(NO3)2(aq) + 2 KCl(aq) ¡ PbCl2(s) + 2 KNO3(aq)
This equation is a molecular equation, an equation showing the complete neutral 
formulas for each compound in the reaction as if they existed as molecules. In actual 
solutions of soluble ionic compounds, dissolved substances are present as ions. We can 
write equations for reactions occurring in aqueous solution in a way that better shows 
the dissociated nature of dissolved ionic compounds. For example, we can rewrite the 
previous equation as:
Pb2 +(aq) + 2 NO3
-(aq) + 2 K +(aq) + 2 Cl -(aq) ¡ PbCl2(s) + 2 K +(aq) + 2 NO3
-(aq)
Equations such as this, which list all of the ions present as either reactants or products in 
a chemical reaction, are complete ionic equations. Strong electrolytes are always rep-
resented as their component ions in ionic equations—weak electrolytes are not.
Notice that in the complete ionic equation, some of the ions in solution appear 
unchanged on both sides of the equation. These ions are called spectator ions because 
they do not participate in the reaction.

	 4.8 	 Acid–Base and Gas-Evolution Reactions
Two other important classes of reactions that occur in aqueous solution are acid–base 
reactions and gas-evolution reactions. In an acid–base reaction (also called a neu-
tralization reaction), an acid reacts with a base and the two neutralize each other, 
producing water (or in some cases a weak electrolyte). In a gas-evolution reaction, 
a gas forms, resulting in bubbling. In both cases, as in precipitation reactions, the

as the reaction of hydrochloric

­reactions occur when the anion from one reactant combines with the cation of the 
other. Many gas-evolution reactions are also acid–base reactions.
Acid–Base Reactions
Our stomachs contain hydrochloric acid (HCl), which acts in the digestion of food. Cer-
tain foods or stress, however, can increase the stomach’s acidity to uncomfortable levels, 
causing acid stomach or heartburn. Antacids are over-the-counter medicines that work 
by reacting with and neutralizing stomach acid. Antacids employ different bases—sub-
stances that produce hydroxide (OH -) ions in water—as neutralizing agents. Milk of 
magnesia, for example, contains Mg(OH)2 and Mylanta contains Al(OH)3. All antacids, 
regardless of the base they employ, have the same effect of neutralizing stomach acid 
and relieving heartburn through acid–base reactions.
Recall from Chapter 3 that an acid forms H + ions in solution, and we just saw that a 
base is a substance that produces OH - ions in solution. More formally:
• Acid: Substance that produces H + ions in aqueous solution
• Base: Substance that produces OH - ions in aqueous solution
These definitions of acids and bases, called the Arrhenius definitions, are named 
after Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius (1859–1927). In Chapter 15, we will learn more 
general definitions of acids and bases, but these definitions are sufficient to describe 
neutralization reactions.
According to the Arrhenius definition, HCl is an acid because it produces H + ions in 
solution:
HCl(aq) ¡ H +(aq) + Cl -(aq)
An H + ion is a bare proton. In solution bare protons normally associate with water mol-
ecules to form hydronium ions (Figure 4.17◀):
H +(aq) + H2O(l) ¡ H3O +(aq)
Chemists use H +(aq) and H3O +(aq) interchangeably to mean the same thing—a hydro-
nium ion. The chemical equation for the ionization of HCl and other acids is often written 
to show the association of the proton with a water molecule to form the hydronium ion:
HCl(aq) + H2O(l) ¡ H3O +(aq) + Cl -(aq)
As we discussed in Section 4.5, some acids are weak acids—they do not completely ion-
ize in solution. We represent the partial ionization of a weak acid with opposing half arrows.
HC2H3O2(aq) ∆ H +(aq) + C2H3O2
-(aq)
Some acids—called polyprotic acids—contain more than one ionizable proton and 
release them sequentially. For example, sulfuric acid, H2SO4, is a diprotic acid. It is 
strong in its first ionizable proton, but weak in its second:
H2SO4(aq) ¡ H +(aq) + HSO4
-(aq)
HSO4
-(aq) ∆H +(aq) + SO4
2 -(aq)
According to the Arrhenius definition, NaOH is a base because it produces OH - ions 
in solution:
NaOH(aq) ¡ Na +(aq) + OH -(aq)
In analogy to diprotic acids, some bases such as Sr(OH)2 produce two moles of OH - per 
mole of the base:
Sr(OH)2(aq) ¡ Sr2 +(aq) + 2 OH -(aq)
Table 4.2 lists common acids and bases. You can find acids and bases in many everyday 
substances. Foods such as citrus fruits and vinegar contain acids. Soap, baking soda, and 
milk of magnesia all contain bases.
When we mix an acid and a base, the H +(aq) from the acid—whether it is weak or 
strong—combines with the OH -(aq) from the base to form H2O(l) (Figure 4.18▶). Con-

Chapter 4  Chemical Quantities and Aqueous Reactions
The word salt in this sense applies to 
any ionic compound and is therefore 
more general than the common 
usage, which refers only to table salt 
(NaCl).
Acid–base reactions generally form water and an ionic compound—called a salt—
that usually remains dissolved in the solution. The net ionic equation for acid–base reac-
tions involving a strong acid is:
H +(aq) + OH -(aq) ¡ H2O(l)
However, if the acid is a weak acid, the net ionic equation is slightly different. For exam-
ple, consider the acid–base equation between hydrofluoric acid and sodium hydroxide:
HF(aq)
acid
+ NaOH(aq)
base
¡ H2O(l)
water
+ NaF(aq)
salt

(Complete ionic 

equation)
 HF(aq) + OH -(aq) ¡ H2O(l) + F -(aq)

(Net ionic equation)
Notice that, since HF is a weak acid, we do not show it as ionized in the ionic equations.

potassium hydroxide:

Again, notice the pattern of acid and base reacting to form water and a salt.
	
Acid + Base i Water + Salt	
(acid–base reactions)
When writing equations for acid–base reactions, write the formula of the salt using the 
procedure for writing formulas of ionic compounds demonstrated in Section 3.5.
Example 4.13 	 Writing Equations for Acid–Base Reactions Involving a Strong Acid
Write a molecular and net ionic equation for the reaction between aqueous HI and aqueous Ba(OH)2.

acid and the base combine to form water and a salt.

Next, balance the equation; this is the molecular equation.

Write the net ionic equation by removing the spectator ions.
Net ionic equation:

or simply H +(aq) + OH -(aq) ¡ H2O(l)
For Practice 4.13  Write a molecular and a net ionic equation for the reaction that occurs between aqueous  
HBr and aqueous LiOH.

(HC2H3O2) and aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH).
Solution  Begin by writing the molecular equation 
in which the acid and the base combine to form water 
and a salt. (The equation is already balanced.)

(and a weak electrolyte).

For Practice 4.14  Write the net ionic equation for the reaction between HCHO2 (a weak acid) and NaOH.
Acid–Base Titrations
We can apply the principles of acid–base neutralization and stoichiometry to a common 
laboratory procedure called a titration. In a titration, a substance in a solution of 
known concentration is reacted with another substance in a solution of unknown con-
centration. For example, consider the following acid–base reaction:
HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) ¡ H2O(l) + NaCl(aq)
The net ionic equation for this reaction eliminates the spectator ions:
H +(aq) + OH -(aq) ¡ H2O(l)
Suppose we have an HCl solution represented by the molecular diagram shown at right 
(we have omitted the Cl - ions and the H2O molecules not involved in the reaction from 
this representation for clarity).
In titrating this sample, we slowly add a solution of known OH - concentration, as 
shown in the molecular diagrams in Figure 4.19▼. As we add the OH -, it reacts with and 
neutralizes the H +, forming water. At the equivalence point—the point in the titra-
tion when the number of moles of OH - added equals the number of moles of H + ini-
tially in solution—the titration is complete. The equivalence point is typically signaled 
by an indicator, a dye whose color depends on the acidity or basicity of the solution 
(Figure 4.20▶, on the next page).

Example 4.15 	 Acid–Base Titration
The titration of 10.00 mL of HCl solution of unknown concentration requires 12.54 mL of a 0.100 M NaOH solution to 
reach the equivalence point. What is the concentration of the unknown HCl solution in M?
SORT  You are given the volume and concentration of 
NaOH solution required to titrate a given volume of HCl 
solution. You are asked to find the concentration of the 
HCl solution.
GIVEN:  12.54 mL of NaOH solution, 0.100 M NaOH  
solution, 10.00 mL of HCl solution
FIND:  concentration of HCl solution
STRATEGIZE  Since this problem involves an acid–base 
neutralization reaction between HCl and NaOH, start 
by writing the balanced equation, using the techniques 
covered earlier in this section.
The first part of the conceptual plan has the form volume 
A S  moles A S  moles B. The concentration of the 
NaOH solution is a conversion factor between moles 
and volume of NaOH. The balanced equation provides 
the relationship between number of moles of NaOH and 
number of moles of HCl.
In the second part of the conceptual plan, use the num-
ber of moles of HCl (from the first part) and the volume 
of HCl solution (given) to calculate the molarity of the 
HCl solution.

We cover acid–base titrations and indicators in more detail in Chapter 17. In most 
laboratory titrations, the concentration of one of the reactant solutions is unknown, 
and the concentration of the other is precisely known. By carefully measuring the vol-
ume of each solution required to reach the equivalence point, we can determine the 
concentration of the unknown solution, as demonstrated in Example 4.15.

	
4.8  Acid–Base and Gas-Evolution Reactions	
173
Gas-Evolution Reactions
In a gas-evolution reaction, two aqueous solutions mix to form a gaseous product that 
bubbles out of solution. Some gas-evolution reactions form a gaseous product directly 
when the cation of one reactant combines with the anion of the other. For example, 
when sulfuric acid reacts with lithium sulfide, dihydrogen sulfide gas forms:
H2SO4(aq) + Li2S(aq) ¡ H2S(g) + Li2SO4(aq)
	
gas
Other gas-evolution reactions often form an intermediate product that then decom-
poses (breaks down into simpler substances) to form a gas. For example, when aqueous 
hydrochloric acid is mixed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate, the following reaction 
occurs (Figure 4.21▶, on the next page):
HCl(aq) + NaHCO3(aq) ¡ H2CO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) ¡ H2O(l) + CO2(g) + NaCl(aq)
	
intermediate product	
gas
The intermediate product, H2CO3, is not stable and decomposes into H2O and gaseous 
CO2. Other important gas-evolution reactions form either H2SO3 or NH4OH as interme-
diate products:
HCl(aq) + NaHSO3(aq) ¡ H2SO3(aq) + NaCl(aq) ¡ H2O(l) + SO2(g) + NaCl(aq)
	
intermediate product	
gas
NH4Cl(aq) + NaOH(aq) ¡ NH4OH(aq) + NaCl(aq) ¡ H2O(l) + NH3(g) + NaCl(aq)

Table 4.3 lists the main types of compounds that form gases in aqueous reactions, as well 
as the gases formed.
Many gas-evolution reactions such as 
this one are also acid–base reactions. 
In Chapter 16 we will learn how 
ions such as Co3
2 - act as bases in 
aqueous solution.
The intermediate product nH4oH 
provides a convenient way to think 
about this reaction, but the extent to 
which it actually forms is debatable.

SOLVE  In the first part of the solution, determine the 
number of moles of HCl in the unknown solution.
In the second part of the solution, divide the number 
of moles of HCl by the volume of the HCl solution in L. 
10.00 mL is equivalent to 0.01000 L.
SOLUTION 
12.54 mL NaOH *
1 L
1000 mL * 0.100 mol NaOH

*
1 mol HCl
1 mol NaOH = 1.25 * 10 - 3 mol HCl
Molarity = 1.25 * 10 - 3 mol HCl
0.01000 L
= 0.125 M HCl
CHECK  The units of the answer (M HCl) are correct. The magnitude of the answer (0.125 M) is reasonable because it is 
similar to the molarity of the NaOH solution, as expected from the reaction stoichiometry (1 mol HCl reacts with 1 mol 
NaOH) and the similar volumes of NaOH and HCl.
For Practice 4.15  The titration of a 20.0-mL sample of an H2SO4 solution of unknown concentration requires  
22.87 mL of a 0.158 M KOH solution to reach the equivalence point. What is the concentration of the unknown H2SO4 
solution?
For More Practice 4.15  What volume (in mL) of 0.200 M NaOH do we need to titrate 35.00 mL of 0.140 M HBr to

	 4.9 	 Oxidation–Reduction Reactions
Oxidation–reduction reactions or redox reactions are reactions in which elec-
trons transfer from one reactant to the other. The rusting of iron, the bleaching of hair, 
and the production of electricity in batteries involve redox reactions. Many redox reac-
tions involve the reaction of a substance with oxygen (Figure 4.22▼).

Hydrogen and oxygen react to form gaseous water.
▲ Figure 4.22  Oxidation–Reduction Reaction  The hydrogen in the balloon reacts with 
oxygen upon ignition to form gaseous water (which is dispersed in the flame).
However, redox reactions need not involve oxygen. Consider, for example, the reaction 
between sodium and chlorine to form sodium chloride (NaCl), depicted in Figure 4.23▶, 
on the next page:
2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) ¡ 2 NaCl(s)
This reaction is similar to the reaction between sodium and oxygen, which forms sodium 
oxide:
4 Na(s) + O2(g) ¡ 2 Na2O(s)
In both cases, a metal (which has a tendency to lose electrons) reacts with a nonmetal 
(which has a tendency to gain electrons). And in both cases, metal atoms lose electrons 
to nonmetal atoms. A fundamental definition of oxidation is the loss of electrons, 
and a fundamental definition of reduction is the gain of electrons.
The transfer of electrons does not need to be a complete transfer (as occurs in the for-
mation of an ionic compound) for the reaction to qualify as oxidation–reduction. For 
example, consider the reaction between hydrogen gas and chlorine gas:
H2(g) + Cl2(g) ¡ 2 HCl(g)
Even though hydrogen chloride is a molecular compound with a covalent bond, and 
even though the hydrogen has not completely transferred its electron to chlorine ­during 
The reaction between sodium and 
oxygen forms other oxides as well.
Helpful Mnemonic: O I L R I G— 
Oxidation Is Loss; Reduction Is Gain.
The ability of an element to attract 
electrons in a chemical bond is 
called electronegativity. We cover 
electronegativity in more detail in 
Section 9.6.

the reaction, we can see from the electron density diagrams (Figure 4.24◀) that hydro-
gen has lost some of its electron density—it has partially transferred its electron to chlo-
rine. In the reaction, hydrogen is oxidized and chlorine is reduced and, therefore, this is 
a redox reaction.
Oxidation States
Identifying whether or not a reaction between a metal and a nonmetal is a redox reac-
tion is fairly straightforward because of ion formation. But how do we identify redox 
reactions that occur between nonmetals? Chemists have devised a scheme to track 
electrons before and after a chemical reaction. In this scheme—which is like book-
keeping for electrons—each shared electron is assigned to the atom that attracts the 
electrons most strongly. Then a number, called the oxidation state or oxidation 
number, is given to each atom based on the electron assignments. In other words, 
the oxidation number of an atom in a compound is the “charge” it would have if 
all shared electrons were assigned to the atom with the greatest attraction for those 
­electrons.
For example, consider HCl. Since chlorine attracts electrons more strongly than 
hydrogen, we assign the two shared electrons in the bond to chlorine; then H (which 
has lost an electron in our assignment) has an oxidation state of +1, and Cl (which 
has gained one electron in our assignment) has an oxidation state of -1. Notice that 
in contrast to ionic charges, which are usually written with the sign of the charge 
after the magnitude (1+ and 1-, for example), oxidation states are written with the 
sign of the charge before the magnitude (+1 and -1, for example). We use the follow-
ing rules to assign oxidation states to atoms in elements, ions, and compounds.

5.	 In their compounds, nonmetals are assigned oxidation states according to the table 
shown here. Entries at the top of the table take precedence over entries at the bot-
tom of the table.
When assigning oxidation states, keep these points in mind:
• The oxidation state of any given element generally depends on what other ele-
ments are present in the compound. (The exceptions are the group 1A and 2A met-
als, which are always +1 and +2, respectively.)
• Rule 3 must always be followed. Therefore, when following the hierarchy shown in 
rule 5, give priority to the element(s) highest on the list and then assign the oxida-
tion state of the element lowest on the list using rule 3.
• When assigning oxidation states to elements that are not covered by rules 4 and 5 
(such as carbon), use rule 3 to deduce their oxidation state once all other oxidation 
states have been assigned.
Do not confuse oxidation state with 
ionic charge. Unlike ionic charge—
which is a real property of an ion—the 
oxidation state of an atom is merely a 
theoretical (but useful) construct.

Chapter 4  Chemical Quantities and Aqueous Reactions
In most cases, oxidation states are positive or negative integers; however, on occa-
sion an atom within a compound can have a fractional oxidation state. Consider KO2. 
The oxidation states are assigned as follows:
KO2
+1- 1
2
sum: +1+2 a- 1
2b = 0
In KO2, oxygen has a -1
2 oxidation state. Although this seems unusual, it is accepted 
because oxidation states are merely an imposed electron bookkeeping scheme, not an 
actual physical quantity.
Identifying Redox Reactions
We can use oxidation states to identify redox reactions, even between nonmetals. For 
example, is the following reaction between carbon and sulfur a redox reaction?
C + 2 S ¡ CS2
Conceptual 
Connection 4.9 
Oxidation Numbers in Polyatomic Ions  Which statement best 
describes the difference between the charge of a polyatomic ion and the oxidation states of 
its constituent atoms? (For example, the charge of NO3
- is 1-, and the oxidation states 
of its atoms are +5 for the nitrogen atom and -2 for each oxygen atom.)
(a)	 The charge of a polyatomic ion is a property of the entire ion, while the  
oxidation states are assigned to each individual atom.
(b)	 The oxidation state of the ion is the same as its charge.
(c)	 The charge of a polyatomic ion is not a real physical property, while the  
oxidation states of atoms are actual physical properties.
The oxidation state of oxygen is -2 (rule 5). The oxidation state of 
carbon must be deduced using rule 3, which says that the sum of the 
oxidation states of all the atoms must be 0.
(d)	 CO2
(C ox state) + 2(O ox state) = 0
(C ox state) + 2(-2) = 0
(C ox state) = +4
CO2
+4-2
sum: +4+2(-2) = 0
The oxidation state of oxygen is -2 (rule 5). You would ordinarily expect 
the oxidation state of S to be -2 (rule 5). However, if that were the case, 
the sum of the oxidation states would not equal the charge of the ion. 
Since O is higher on the list than S, it takes priority and you calculate the 
oxidation state of sulfur by setting the sum of all of the oxidation states 
equal to -2 (the charge of the ion).
(e)	 SO4
2 -
(S ox state) + 4(O ox state) = -2
(S ox state) + 4(-2) = -2
S ox state = +6
SO4
2 -
+6-2
sum: +6 + 4(-2) =  -2
The oxidation state of potassium is +1 (rule 4). You would ordinarily 
expect the oxidation state of O to be -2 (rule 5), but rule 4 takes priority, 
and you deduce the oxidation state of O by setting the sum of all of the 
oxidation states equal to 0.
(f)	 K2O2
2(K ox state) + 2(O ox state) = 0
2(+1) + 2(O ox state) = 0
O ox state = -1

If so, what element is oxidized? What element is reduced? We can use the oxidation state 
rules to assign oxidation states to all elements on both sides of the equation.

Oxidation
Reduction
Carbon changes from an oxidation state of 0 to an oxidation state of +4. In 
terms of our electron bookkeeping scheme (the assigned oxidation state), carbon 
loses electrons and is oxidized. Sulfur changes from an oxidation state of 0 to an oxida-
tion state of -2. In terms of our electron bookkeeping scheme, sulfur gains electrons 
and is reduced. In terms of oxidation states, oxidation and reduction are defined as 
follows:
• Oxidation: An increase in oxidation state
• Reduction: A decrease in oxidation state
Remember that a reduction is a 
reduction in oxidation state.
Example 4.18 	 Using Oxidation States to Identify Oxidation and Reduction
Use oxidation states to identify the element that is oxidized and the element that is reduced in the following redox 
reaction:
Mg(s) + 2 H2O(l) ¡ Mg(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)
SOLUTION
Begin by assigning oxidation states to each atom in the reaction.

Since Mg increased in oxidation state, it was oxidized. Since H decreased in oxidation state, it was reduced.
For Practice 4.18  Use oxidation states to identify the element that is oxidized and the element that is reduced in 
the following redox reaction:
Sn(s) + 4 HNO3(aq) ¡ SnO2(s) + 4 NO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)
For More Practice 4.18  Determine whether or not each reaction is a redox reaction. If the reaction is a redox reac-
tion, identify which element is oxidized and which is reduced.
(a)	 Hg2(NO3)2(aq) + 2 KBr(aq) ¡ Hg2Br2(s) + 2 KNO3(aq)
(b)	 4 Al(s) + 3 O2(g) ¡ 2 Al2O3(s)
(c)	 CaO(s) + CO2(g) ¡ CaCO3(s)
Notice that oxidation and reduction must occur together. If one substance loses elec-
trons (oxidation), then another substance must gain electrons (reduction). A substance 
that causes the oxidation of another substance is an oxidizing agent. Oxygen, for 
example, is an excellent oxidizing agent. In a redox reaction, the oxidizing agent is always 
reduced. A substance that causes the reduction of another substance is a reducing 
agent. Hydrogen, for example, and group 1A and group 2A metals (because of their ten-
dency to lose electrons) are excellent reducing agents. In a redox reaction, the reducing 
agent is always oxidized.
In Section 19.2 you will learn more about redox reactions, including how to balance 
them. For now, be able to identify redox reactions, as well as oxidizing and reducing 
agents, according to the following guidelines.

Redox reactions:
• Any reaction in which there is a change in the oxidation states of atoms in going 
from reactants to products.
In a redox reaction:
• The oxidizing agent oxidizes another substance (and is itself reduced).
• The reducing agent reduces another substance (and is itself oxidized).

Oxidation and Reduction  Which statement is true?
(a)	 A redox reaction involves either the transfer of an electron or a change in the 
oxidation state of an element.
(b)	 If any of the reactants or products in a reaction contain oxygen, the reaction is a 
redox reaction.
(c)	 In a reaction, oxidation can occur independently of reduction.
(d)	 In a redox reaction, any increase in the oxidation state of a reactant must be ac-
companied by a decrease in the oxidation state of a reactant.

Chemistry IN YOUR DAY | Bleached Blonde
H
ave you ever bleached your hair? Most home kits for 
hair bleaching contain hydrogen peroxide (H2o2), an 
excellent oxidizing agent. When applied to hair, hydrogen 
peroxide oxidizes melanin, the dark pigment that gives hair 
its color. Once melanin is oxidized, it no longer imparts 
a dark color, leaving the hair with the familiar bleached 
look. Hydrogen peroxide also oxidizes other components of 
hair. For example, protein molecules in hair contain ­—sH 
groups called thiols. Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes these thiol 
groups to sulfonic acid groups, —so3H. The oxidation of 
thiol groups to sulfonic acid groups causes changes in the 
proteins that compose hair, making the hair more brittle 
and more likely to tangle. Consequently, people with heav-
ily bleached hair generally use conditioners, which contain 
compounds that form thin, lubricating coatings on individual 
hair shafts. These coatings prevent tangling and make hair 
softer and more manageable.
Q u e s t i o n
The following is a reaction of hydrogen peroxide with an 
alkene:
H2O2 + C2H4 ¡ C2H4O + H2O
Can you see why this reaction is a redox reaction? Can you 
identify the oxidizing and reducing agents?
▲ The bleaching of hair involves a redox reaction in which 
melanin—the main pigment in hair—is oxidized.

Combustion Reactions
We encountered combustion reactions, a type of redox reaction, in the opening sec-
tion of this chapter. Combustion reactions are important because most of our society’s 
energy is derived from them (Figure 4.25▼).
As we discussed in Section 4.1, combustion reactions are characterized by the reac-
tion of a substance with O2 to form one or more oxygen-containing compounds, often 
including water. Combustion reactions also emit heat. For example, as we saw earlier in 
this chapter, natural gas (CH4) reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water:
CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) ¡ CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)

Chapter 4  Chemical Quantities and Aqueous Reactions
Example 4.20 	 Writing Equations for Combustion Reactions
Write a balanced equation for the combustion of liquid methyl alcohol (CH3OH).
SOLUTION 
Begin by writing an unbalanced equation showing the 
reaction of CH3OH with O2 to form CO2 and H2O.
CH3OH(l) + O2(g) ¡ CO2(g) + H2O(g)
Balance the equation using the guidelines in Section 3.10.
2 CH3OH(l) + 3 O2(g) ¡ 2 CO2(g) + 4 H2O(g)
For Practice 4.20  Write a balanced equation for the complete combustion of liquid C2H5SH.
In this reaction, carbon is oxidized and oxygen is reduced. Ethanol, the alcohol in alco-
holic beverages, also reacts with oxygen in a combustion reaction to form carbon diox-
ide and water:
C2H5OH(l) + 3 O2(g) ¡ 2 CO2(g) + 3 H2O(g)
Compounds containing carbon and hydrogen—or carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen— 
always form carbon dioxide and water upon complete combustion. Other combustion 
reactions include the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon dioxide:
C(s) + O2(g) ¡ CO2(g)
and the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to form water:
2 H2(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 H2O(g)

Chapter 4  Chemical Quantities and Aqueous Reactions
Key Concepts
Climate Change and the Combustion of Fossil 
Fuels (4.1)
▶
▶Greenhouse gases warm Earth by trapping some of the sunlight 
that penetrates Earth’s atmosphere. Global warming, result-
ing from rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, is potentially 
harmful.
▶
▶The largest atmospheric carbon dioxide source is the burning of 
fossil fuels. This can be verified by reaction stoichiometry.
Reaction Stoichiometry (4.2)
▶
▶Reaction stoichiometry refers to the numerical relationships be-
tween the reactants and products in a balanced chemical ­equation.
▶
▶Reaction stoichiometry allows us to predict, for example, the 
amount of product that can be formed for a given amount of reac-
tant, or how much of one reactant is required to react with a given 
amount of another.
Limiting Reactant, Theoretical Yield, and Percent 
Yield (4.3)
▶
▶When a chemical reaction actually occurs, the reactants are usu-
ally not present in the exact stoichiometric ratios specified by the 
balanced chemical equation. The limiting reactant is the one that 
is available in the smallest stoichiometric quantity—it will be 
completely consumed in the reaction, and it limits the amount of 
product that can be made.
▶
▶Any reactant that does not limit the amount of product is in ex-
cess.
▶
▶The amount of product that can be made from the limiting reac-
tant is the theoretical yield.
▶
▶The actual yield—always equal to or less than the theoretical 
yield—is the amount of product that is actually made when the 
reaction is carried out.
▶
▶The percentage of the theoretical yield that is actually produced 
when the reaction is carried out is the percent yield.
Solution Concentration and Stoichiometry (4.4)
▶
▶An aqueous solution is a homogeneous mixture of water (the sol-
vent) with another substance (the solute).
▶
▶We express the concentration of a solution in molarity, the num-
ber of moles of solute per liter of solution.
▶
▶We can use the molarities and volumes of reactant solutions  
to predict the amount of product that forms in an aqueous  
reaction.
Aqueous Solutions and Precipitation  
Reactions (4.5, 4.6)
▶
▶Solutes that completely dissociate (or completely ionize in the 
case of the strong acids) to ions in solution are strong electrolytes 
and their solutions are good conductors of electricity.
▶
▶Solutes that only partially dissociate (or partially ionize) are weak 
electrolytes.
▶
▶Solutes that do not dissociate (or ionize) are nonelectrolytes.
▶
▶A substance that dissolves in water to form a solution is soluble.
▶
▶In a precipitation reaction, we mix two aqueous solutions and a 
solid (precipitate) forms.
▶
▶The solubility rules are an empirical set of guidelines that help pre-
dict the solubilities of ionic compounds; these rules are especially 
useful when determining whether or not a precipitate will form.
Equations for Aqueous Reactions (4.7)
▶
▶We can represent an aqueous reaction with a molecular equation, 
which shows the complete neutral formula for each compound in 
the reaction.
▶
▶We can also represent an aqueous reaction with a complete ionic 
equation, which shows the dissociated nature of the aqueous ion-
ic compounds.
▶
▶A third representation of an aqueous reaction is the net ionic equa-
tion, in which the spectator ions—those that do not change in the 
course of the reaction—are left out of the equation.
Acid–Base and Gas-Evolution Reactions (4.8)
▶
▶In an acid–base reaction, an acid, a substance that produces H + 
in solution, reacts with a base, a substance that produces OH - in 
solution, and the two neutralize each other, producing water (or 
in some cases a weak electrolyte).
▶
▶An acid–base titration is a laboratory procedure in which a reac-
tion is carried to its equivalence point—the point at which the 
reactants are in exact stoichiometric proportions; titrations are 
useful in determining the concentrations of unknown solutions.
▶
▶In gas-evolution reactions, two aqueous solutions combine and a 
gas is produced.
Oxidation–Reduction Reactions (4.9)
▶
▶In oxidation–reduction reactions, one substance transfers elec-
trons to another substance.
▶
▶In oxidation–reduction reactions, the substance that loses  
electrons is oxidized and the substance that gains them is reduced.
▶
▶An oxidation state is a fictitious charge given to each atom in an 
oxidation–reduction reaction by assigning all shared electrons to 
the atom with the greater attraction for those electrons. An oxida-
tion state is an imposed electronic bookkeeping scheme, not an 
actual physical state.
▶
▶The oxidation state of an atom increases upon oxidation and de-
creases upon reduction.
▶
▶A combustion reaction is a specific type of oxidation–reduction 
reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen, emitting heat 
and forming one or more oxygen-containing products.

Data Interpretation and Analysis
Fluoride in Drinking Water
	146.	 In most communities in the United States, fluoride ions are 
added to public drinking water to help reduce dental caries 
(cavities in teeth). Fluoride ions in water react with calcium 
­hydroxyapatite, a chemical component of teeth, to form 
hydroxyfluorapatite according to this reaction:
Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + F - ¡ Ca10(PO4)6FOH +  OH -
Hydroxyfluorapatite reduces the rate of demineralization 
of tooth enamel; demineralization can lead to dental caries. 
However, too much fluoride in drinking water can cause dental 
fluorosis and/or enamel fluorosis, which stain teeth. Figure a▼ 
lists the 1962 recommended and maximum fluoride ion con-
centration for drinking water in the United States as a function 
of annual average air temperature.
Use the information provided in the figures to answer the 
­following questions:
a.	 Sodium fluoride (NaF) and sodium fluorosilicate (Na2SiF6) 
are commercially available in 100.0-lb bags. Calculate the 
mass, in kg, of fluoride ion in a 100.0-lb bag for each of these 
two compounds.
b.	 The density of fluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) is related to its per-
cent by weight as shown in Figure c▼.
A 1994 World Health Organization committee recom-
mended an optimal level of fluoride in drinking water from 0.5 to 
1.0 mg>L (milligrams per liter), depending on climate region. 
Municipalities typically use three commercially available com-
pounds to add fluoride ions to public drinking water. Figure b▼ 
lists the three compounds containing fluoride ions along with 
their molar mass, percent fluoride in the pure compound, and 
percent pure compound in the commercial product.

drinking water provides about 75% of an adult’s daily fluo-

i.	 If a community is located in a cold climate (10.0–12.0 °C) 
and the water has the optimum level of fluoride ions, cal-
culate the mg of fluoride ion present in one glass of water. 
(Note that: 1 glass = 12.0 ounces of water = 0.355 liters.)
ii.	A public water treatment plant located in a hot climate 
has a lower fluoride ion concentration in the drinking wa-
ter compared to the water from a public water treatment 
plant located in a colder climate. Both meet the recom-
mended daily F- guideline. Explain how this is possible.

Oxidation Numbers in Polyatomic Ions
4.9	 (a) The charge of a polyatomic ion is the charge associated 
with the ion as a whole. The oxidation states of the individual 
atoms must sum to the charge of the ion, but they are assigned 
to the individual atoms themselves. Answer (b) is incorrect be-
cause oxidation state and charge are not identical, even though 
the charge of a monoatomic ion is equal to its oxidation state. 
Answer (c) is incorrect because charge is a physical property 
of ions. Conversely, the oxidation states of atoms are not real 
physical properties, but an imposed electron bookkeeping 
scheme.
Oxidation and Reduction

and two hydrogen molecules remain after the reactants have 
reacted as completely as possible.
Reactant in Excess
4.4	 The limiting reactant is the 1 mol H2O, which is completely 
consumed. The 1 mol of H2O requires 3 mol of NO2 to com-
pletely react; therefore, 2 mol NO2 remain after the reaction is 
complete.
Solutions
4.5	 (b) The mass of a solution is equal to the mass of the solute plus 
the mass of the solvent. Although the solute seems to disappear, 
it really does not, and its mass becomes part of the mass of the 
solution, in accordance with the law of mass conservation.
Solution Dilution
4.6	 (c) Since the volume has doubled, the concentration is halved, 
so the same volume should contain half as many solute  
molecules.

So many of the properties of matter, especially when in 
the gaseous form, can be deduced from the hypothesis 
that their minute parts are in rapid motion, the velocity 
increasing with the temperature, that the precise nature 
of this motion becomes a subject of rational curiosity.

uman beings can survive for weeks without food, days without water, but only 
minutes without air. Fortunately, we live at the bottom of a vast ocean of air, 
held to Earth by gravity. We inhale a lungful of this air every few seconds, keep 
some of the molecules for our own uses, add some molecules that our bodies no longer 
need, and exhale the mixture back into the surrounding air. The air around us is matter 
in the gaseous state. What are the fundamental properties of these gases? What laws 
describe their behavior? What theory explains these properties and laws? Recall that 
the scientific approach (see Section 1.2) proceeds in this way—from observations to 
laws to theories—exactly the way we will proceed in this chapter. The gaseous state is 
the simplest and best-understood state of matter. In this chapter, we examine that state.
	 5.1	
Supersonic Skydiving and the  
Risk of Decompression
On October 14, 2012, just after midday in New Mexico, Austrian daredevil Felix 
Baumgartner stepped into the dark void of space 24 miles (38.6 km) above the Earth’s 
surface. Baumgartner’s 20-minute journey back to the desert floor broke the sound bar-
rier and shattered the previous skydiving record of 19.5 miles (31.4 km).
When Baumgartner stepped into space, he was protected from the surrounding vac-
uum by a pressurized suit. The suit contained air at a pressure similar to that found on 
197

Chapter 5  Gases
the surface of Earth. Pressure is the force exerted per unit area by gas particles as they 
strike the surfaces around them (Figure 5.1◀). Just as a ball exerts a force when it bounces 
against a wall, so a gaseous atom or molecule exerts a force when it collides with a sur-
face. The result of these collisions is pressure—a constant force on the surfaces exposed 
to any gas. The total pressure exerted by a gas depends on several factors, including the 
concentration of gas particles in the sample; the lower the concentration, the lower the 
pressure. At 24 miles (38.6 km) above the Earth’s surface, the concentration of gas parti-
cles is much lower than it is at sea level; consequently, the pressure at that high altitude 
is very low. Without the pressurized suit, Baumgartner could not have survived the 
space-like conditions.
One of the primary risks that Baumgartner faced while in space was uncontrolled 
decompression. Any significant damage to his suit could have caused the air within the 
suit to escape, resulting in a large pressure drop. While the effects of a large pressure drop 
are sometimes exaggerated—for example, one urban myth claims that a person can 
explode—they are nonetheless lethal. If a pressure drop had occurred fast enough, a 
large pressure difference would have quickly developed between the air in Baumgart-
ner’s lungs and the surrounding vacuum. The pressure difference would have caused his 
lungs to expand too much, resulting in severe lung damage. Fortunately, Baumgartner’s 
suit worked just as it was designed to do, and he plunged safely back to Earth.
	 5.2	
Pressure: The Result of Molecular 
Collisions
Air can hold up a jumbo jet or knock down a building. How? As we discussed in  
Section 5.1, air contains gaseous atoms and molecules in constant motion. The particles 
collide with each other and with the surfaces around them. Each collision exerts only 
a small force, but when the forces of the many particles are summed, they quickly add 
up. The result of the constant collisions between the atoms or molecules in a gas and the 
surfaces around them is pressure. Because of pressure, we can drink from straws, inflate 
basketballs, and breathe. Variation in pressure in Earth’s atmosphere creates wind, and 
changes in pressure help us to predict weather. Pressure is all around us and inside of us.
The pressure that a gas sample exerts is the force that results from the collisions of 
gas particles divided by the area of the surface with which they collide:
	
Pressure = force
area = F
A
[5.1]
The pressure exerted by a gas sample, therefore, depends on the number of gas particles 
in a given volume—the fewer the gas particles, the lower the force per unit area and the 
lower the pressure (Figure 5.2◀). Since the number of gas particles in a given volume

generally decreases with increasing altitude, pressure decreases with 
increasing altitude. Above 30,000 ft, for example, where most com-
mercial airplanes fly, the pressure is so low that a person could pass 
out due to a lack of oxygen. For this reason, most airplane cabins are 
artificially pressurized.
You may sometimes feel the effect of a drop in pressure as a 
brief pain in your ears. This pain arises within the air-containing 
cavities in your ear (Figure 5.3▶). When you ascend to a higher alti-
tude, the external pressure (the pressure that surrounds you) drops, 
while the pressure within your ear cavities (the internal pressure) 
remains the same. This creates an imbalance—the greater internal 
pressure forces your eardrum to bulge outward, causing pain. With 
time, and with the help of a yawn or two, the excess air within your 
ear’s cavities escapes, equalizing the internal and external pressure 
and relieving the pain.
Pressure Units
We measure pressure in several different units. A common unit 
of pressure, the millimeter of mercury (mmHg), originates 
from how pressure is measured with a barometer (Figure 5.4▼). 
A barometer is an evacuated glass tube, the tip of which is sub-
merged in a pool of mercury (Hg). Atmospheric pressure on the 
liquid mercury’s surface forces the mercury upward into the 
evacuated tube. Because mercury is so dense (13.5 times more dense than water), 
atmospheric pressure can support a column of Hg that is only about 0.760 m or  
760 mm (about 30 in) tall. (By contrast, atmospheric pressure can support a column 
of water that is about 10.3 m tall.) This makes a column of mercury a convenient way 
to measure pressure.
In a barometer, when the atmospheric pressure rises, the height of the mercury col-
umn rises as well. Similarly, when atmospheric pressure falls, the height of the column 
falls. The unit millimeter of mercury is often called a torr, after the Italian physicist Evan-
gelista Torricelli (1608–1647) who invented the barometer:
1 mmHg = 1 torr
A second unit of pressure is the atmosphere (atm), the average pressure at sea 
level. Since one atmosphere of pressure pushes a column of mercury to a height of  
760 mm, 1 atm and 760 mmHg are equal:
1 atm = 760 mmHg
A fully inflated mountain bike tire has a pressure of about 6 atm, and the pressure at the 
top of Mount Everest is about 0.31 atm.
The SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa), defined as 1 newton (N) per square meter:
1 Pa = 1 N/m2
The pascal is a much smaller unit of pressure than the atmosphere:
1 atm = 101,325 Pa
Other common units of pressure include inches of mercury (in Hg) and pounds per 
square inch (psi):
1 atm = 29.92 in Hg  1 atm = 14.7 psi
Table 5.1, on the next page, summarizes common pressure units.

The Manometer: A Way to Measure  
Pressure in the Laboratory
We can measure the pressure of a gas sample in the laboratory 
with a manometer. A manometer is a U-shaped tube contain-
ing a dense liquid, usually mercury, as shown in Figure 5.5◀. 
In this manometer, one end of the tube is open to atmospheric 
pressure and the other is attached to a flask containing the 
gas sample. If the pressure of the gas sample is exactly equal to 
atmospheric pressure, then the mercury levels on both sides of 
the tube are the same. If the pressure of the gas sample is greater 
than atmospheric pressure, the mercury level on the left side of 
the tube is higher than the level on the right. If the pressure of 
the sample is less than atmospheric pressure, the mercury level 
on the left side is lower than the level on the right. This type of 
manometer always measures the pressure of the gas sample rela-
tive to atmospheric pressure. The difference in height between 
the two levels is equal to the difference between the sample’s

Converting between Pressure Units
A high-performance road bicycle tire is inflated to a total pressure of 132 psi. What is this pressure in mmHg?
SORT  The problem gives a pressure in psi and asks you 
to convert the units to mmHg.
GIVEN:  132 psi
FIND:  mmHg
STRATEGIZE  Since Table 5.1 does not have a direct 
conversion factor between psi and mmHg but does 
provide relationships between both of these units and 
atmospheres, convert to atm as an intermediate step.
CONCEPTUAL PLAN 
mmHg

1 atm
14.7 psi
760 mmHg

RELATIONSHIPS USED 
1 atm = 14.7 psi
760 mmHg = 1 atm (both from Table 5.1)
SOLVE  Follow the conceptual plan to solve the prob-
lem. Begin with 132 psi and use the conversion factors 
to arrive at the pressure in mmHg.
SOLUTION 
132 psi *
1 atm
14.7 psi *
760 mmHg
1 atm
= 6.82 * 103 mmHg
CHECK  The units of the answer are correct. The magnitude of the answer (6.82 * 103 mmHg) is greater than the given  
pressure in psi. This is reasonable since mmHg is a much smaller unit than psi.
For Practice 5.1  Your local weather report announces that the barometric pressure is 30.44 in Hg. Convert this 
pressure to psi.

Chemistry and Medicine | Blood Pressure

lood pressure is the force within our arteries that drives 
the circulation of blood throughout the body. Blood pres-
sure in the body is analogous to water pressure in a plumb-
ing system. Just as water pressure pushes water through the 
pipes to faucets and fixtures throughout a house, blood pres-
sure pushes blood to muscles and other tissues throughout 
the body. However, unlike the water pressure in a plumbing 
system—which is typically nearly constant—blood pressure 
varies with each heartbeat. When the heart muscle con-
tracts, blood pressure increases; between contractions it 
­decreases. Systolic blood pressure is the peak pressure dur-
ing a contraction, and diastolic blood pressure is the lowest 
pressure between contractions. Just as excessively high 
water pressure in a plumbing system can damage pipes, 
blood pressure that is too high in a circulatory system can 
damage the heart and arteries, resulting in increased risk of 
stroke and heart attack.
Medical professionals usually measure blood pressure 
with an instrument called a sphygmomanometer—an 
­inflatable cuff equipped with a pressure gauge—and a 
stethoscope. The cuff is wrapped around the patient’s arm 
and inflated with air. As air is pumped into the cuff, the 
pressure in the cuff increases. The cuff tightens around the 
arm and compresses the artery, momentarily stopping 
blood flow. The person measuring the blood pressure lis-
tens to the artery through the stethoscope while slowly re-
leasing the air pressure in the cuff. When the air pressure 
in the cuff equals the systolic blood pressure (the peak 
pressure), a pulse is heard through the stethoscope. The 
pulse is the sound of blood getting through the com-
pressed artery during a contraction of the heart. The pres-
sure reading at that exact moment is the systolic blood 
pressure. As the pressure in the cuff continues to de-
crease, the blood can flow through the compressed ­artery 
even between contractions, so the pulsing sound stops. 
The pressure reading when the pulsing sound stops is the 
diastolic blood pressure (the lowest pressure).
A blood pressure measurement is usually reported as two 
pressures, in mmHg, separated by a slash. For example, a 
blood pressure measurement of 122>84 indicates that the 
systolic blood pressure is 122 mmHg and the diastolic blood 
pressure is 84 mmHg. Although the value of blood pressure 
can vary throughout the day, healthy (or normal) values are 
usually considered to be below 120 mmHg for systolic and 
below 80 mmHg for diastolic (Table 5.2). High blood pres-
sure, also called hypertension, entails the health risks men-
tioned previously.
Risk factors for hypertension include obesity, high salt 
(sodium) intake, high alcohol intake, lack of exercise, stress, 
a family history of high blood pressure, and age (blood pres-
sure tends to increase as we get older). Mild hypertension 
can be managed with diet and exercise. Moderate to severe 
cases require doctor-prescribed medication.

sample, we also need a barometer to measure atmospheric pressure (which can vary 
from day to day).

The Simple Gas Laws: Boyle’s Law, 
Charles’s Law, and Avogadro’s Law
We have learned about pressure and its characteristics in Section 5.2. We now broaden 
our discussion to include the four basic properties of a gas sample: pressure (P), volume 
(V), temperature (T), and amount in moles (n). These properties are interrelated—when 
one changes, it affects the others. The simple gas laws describe the relationships between 
Simple Gas Laws and Ideal 
Gas Law

202	
Chapter 5  Gases
pairs of these properties. For example, one simple gas law describes how volume varies 
with pressure at constant temperature and amount of gas; another law describes how 
volume varies with temperature at constant pressure and amount of gas. These laws were 
deduced from observations in which two of the four basic properties were held constant 
in order to elucidate the relationship between the other two.
Boyle’s Law: Volume and Pressure
In the early 1660s, the pioneering English scientist Robert Boyle (1627–1691) and his 
assistant Robert Hooke (1635–1703) used a J-tube (Figure 5.6▼) to measure the volume 
of a sample of gas at different pressures. They trapped a sample of air in the J-tube and 
added mercury to increase the pressure on the gas. Boyle and Hooke observed an inverse 
relationship between volume and pressure—an increase in one causes a decrease in the 
other—as shown in Figure 5.7▼. This relationship is now known as Boyle’s law.
Boyle’s law: V ∝1
P (constant T and n)
Boyle’s law follows from the idea that pressure results from the collisions of the gas 
particles with the walls of their container. When the volume of a gas sample decreases, 
the same number of gas particles is crowded into a smaller volume, resulting in more 
collisions with the walls and therefore an increase in pressure (Figure 5.8▶).
Scuba divers learn about Boyle’s law during certification because it explains why a 
diver should not ascend toward the surface without continuous breathing. For every 
10 m of depth that a diver descends in water, she experiences an additional 1 atm of 
pressure due to the weight of the water above her (Figure 5.9▶). The pressure regulator 
used in scuba diving delivers air into the diver’s lungs at a pressure that matches the 
external pressure; otherwise the diver could not inhale the air (see Chemistry in Your 
Day: Extra-Long Snorkels on page 205). For example, when a diver is 20 m below the sur-
face, the regulator delivers air at a pressure of 3 atm to match the 3 atm of pressure 
around the diver (1 atm due to normal atmospheric pressure and 2 additional atmo-
spheres due to the weight of the water at 20 m). Suppose that a diver inhaled a lungful 
of air at a pressure of 3 atm and swam quickly to the surface (where the pressure is 
1 atm) while holding her breath. What would happen to the volume of air in her lungs? 
Boyle’s law assumes constant 
temperature and constant amount  
of gas.

◀ Figure 5.8  Molecular 
Interpretation of Boyle’s Law  As 
the volume of a gas sample 
decreases, gas molecules collide 
with surrounding surfaces more 
frequently, resulting in greater 
pressure.
Since the pressure decreases by a factor of 3, the volume of the air in her lungs would 
increase by a factor of 3—a dangerous situation. The volume increase in the diver’s 
lungs would be so great that she would not be able to hold her breath all the way to the 
surface—the air would force itself out of her mouth but probably not before the 
expanded air severely damaged her lungs, possibly killing her. Consequently, the most 
important rule in diving is never hold your breath. To avoid catastrophic results, divers 
must ascend slowly and breathe continuously, allowing the regulator to bring the air 
pressure in their lungs back to 1 atm by the time they reach the surface.
We can use Boyle’s law to calculate the volume of a gas following a pressure change 
or the pressure of a gas following a volume change as long as the temperature and the 
amount of gas remain constant. For these types of calculations, we write Boyle’s law in a 
slightly different way.
Since V ∝1
P,  then V = (constant) * 1
P or V = (constant)
P
If we multiply both sides by P, we find that the product of P and V is equal to a constant:
PV = constant
If two quantities are proportional, then 
one is equal to the other multiplied by 
a constant.

P = 3 atm
 Depth = 0 m

◀ Figure 5.9  Increase in 
Pressure with Depth  For every 
10 m of depth, a diver experiences 
approximately 1 additional 
atmosphere of pressure due to the 
weight of the surrounding water. 
At 20 m, for example, the diver 
experiences approximately  
3 atm of pressure (1 atm of normal 
atmospheric pressure plus an 
additional 2 atm due to the weight of 
the water).

Chapter 5  Gases
This relationship indicates that if the pressure increases, the volume decreases, but 
the product P * V always equals the same constant. For two different sets of conditions, 
we can say that:
P1V1 = constant = P2V2
or:
	
P1V1 = P2V2 
[5.2]
where P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume of the gas and P2 and V2 are the final 
volume and pressure.

Chemistry IN YOUR DAY | Extra-Long Snorkels
S
everal episodes of The Flintstones cartoon featured Fred 
Flintstone and Barney Rubble snorkeling. Their snorkels, 
however, were not the modern kind, but long reeds that 
stretched from the surface of the water down to many meters 
of depth. Fred and Barney swam around in deep water while 
breathing air provided to them by these extra-long snorkels. 
Would this work? Why do people bother with scuba diving 
equipment if they could instead simply use 10-meter snor-
kels as Fred and Barney did?
When we breathe, we expand the volume of our chest 
cavity, reducing the pressure in our lungs to less than 1 atm 
(Boyle’s law). Because of this pressure differential, air from 
outside our lungs flows into them. Extra-long snorkels do not 
work because the pressure exerted by water at depth is too 
great. A diver at 10 m experiences an external pressure of  
2 atm. This is more than the muscles of the chest cavity can 
overcome. Instead, the chest cavity and lungs are com-
pressed, resulting in an air pressure within them of more 
than 1 atm. If the diver had a snorkel that went to the sur-
face—where the air pressure is 1 atm—air would flow out of 
the diver’s lungs (from greater pressure to less pressure), not 
into them. It would be impossible for the diver to breathe.
Q u e s t i o n
A diver takes a balloon with a volume of 2.5 L from the 
surface, where the pressure is 1.0 atm, to a depth of 20 m, 
where the pressure is 3.0 atm. What happens to the volume of 
the balloon? What if the end of the submerged balloon is on a 
long pipe that goes to the surface and is attached to another 
balloon? Which way would air flow as the diver descended?
▲ In the popular cartoon The 
Flintstones, cavemen used long 
reeds to breathe surface air while 
swimming at depth. This would 
not work because the increased 
pressure at depth would force air 
out of their lungs; the pressure 
would not allow them to inhale.
From the plot we can see a relationship between volume and temperature: the volume of a 
gas increases with increasing temperature. Looking at the plot more closely reveals more—
volume and temperature are linearly related. If two variables are linearly related, plotting 
one against the other produces a straight line.
Another interesting feature emerges if we extend or extrapolate each line in the plot 
in Figure 5.10 backward from the lowest measured temperature. The dotted extrapolated 
lines show that the gas should have a zero volume at -273.15 °C. Recall from Chapter 1 
that -273.15 °C corresponds to 0 K (zero on the Kelvin scale), the coldest possible tem-
perature. The extrapolated lines indicate that below -273.15 °C, the gas would have a 
negative volume, which is physically impossible. For this reason, we refer to 0 K as abso-
lute zero—colder temperatures do not exist.
The first person to carefully quantify the relationship between the volume of a gas 
and its temperature was J. A. C. Charles (1746–1823), a French mathematician and physi-
cist. Charles was interested in gases and was among the first people to ascend in a hydro-
gen-filled balloon. The direct proportionality between volume and temperature is 
named Charles’s law after him.
Charles’s law:   V ∝T   (constant P and n)
When the temperature of a gas sample increases, the gas particles move faster; colli-
sions with the walls are more frequent, and the force exerted with each collision is 
greater. The only way for the pressure (the force per unit area) to remain constant is for 
P = 1 atm
P = 3 atm

were joined by a long 
tube and one end was 
submerged in water,

to the volumes of the 
two balloons?

pressure and constant amount of gas.

Chapter 5  Gases
the gas to occupy a larger volume so that collisions become less frequent and occur over 
a larger area (Figure 5.11▲).
Charles’s law explains why the second floor of a house is usually warmer than the 
ground floor. According to Charles’s law, when air is heated, its volume increases, result-
ing in a lower density. The warm, less dense air tends to rise in a room filled with colder, 
denser air. Similarly, Charles’s law explains why a hot-air balloon can take flight. The gas 
that fills a hot-air balloon is warmed with a burner, increasing its volume, lowering its 
density, and causing it to float in the colder, denser surrounding air.
You can experience Charles’s law directly by holding a partially inflated balloon 
over a warm toaster. As the air in the balloon warms, you can feel the balloon expand-
ing. Alternatively, you can put an inflated balloon into liquid nitrogen and watch it 
become smaller as it cools.
We can use Charles’s law to calculate the volume of a gas following a temperature 
change or the temperature of a gas following a volume change as long as the pressure and 
the amount of gas are constant. For these calculations, we rearrange Charles’s law as 
follows:
Since V ∝T, then V = constant * T
If we divide both sides by T, we find that V>T is equal to a constant:
V>T = constant
If the temperature increases, the volume increases in direct proportion so that the 
quotient, V>T, is always equal to the same constant. So, for two different measurements, 
we can say that:
V1>T1 = constant = V2>T2
or
	
V1
T1
= V2
T2

[5.3]
where V1 and T1 are the initial volume and temperature of the gas and V2 and T2 are the 
final volume and temperature. The temperatures must always be expressed in kelvins (K) 
because, as shown in Figure 5.10, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its abso-
lute temperature, not its temperature in °C. For example, doubling the temperature of a 
gas sample from 1 °C to 2 °C does not double its volume, but doubling the temperature 
from 200 K to 400 K does.

Example 5.3	
Charles’s Law
A sample of gas has a volume of 2.80 L at an unknown temperature. When the sample is submerged in ice water at 
T = 0.00 °C, its volume decreases to 2.57 L. What was its initial temperature (in K and in °C)?
To solve the problem, first solve Charles’s law for T1.

Before you substitute the numerical values to calculate T1, convert 
the temperature to kelvins (K). Remember, gas law problems must 
always be worked with Kelvin temperatures.
T2(K) = 0.00 + 273.15 = 273.15 K
Substitute T2 and the other given quantities to calculate T1.
 T1 = V1
V2
T2
 
 = 2.80 L

 =  297.6 K
Calculate T1 in °C by subtracting 273.15 from the value in kelvins.
T1(°C) = 297.6 - 273.15 = 24 °C
For Practice 5.3  A gas in a cylinder with a moveable piston has an initial volume of 88.2 mL. If we heat the gas  
from 35 °C to 155 °C, what is its final volume (in mL)?

Boyle’s Law and Charles’s Law  The pressure exerted on a sample of a fixed 
amount of gas is doubled at constant temperature, and then the temperature of the gas 
in kelvins is doubled at constant pressure. What is the final volume of the gas?
(a)	 The final volume is twice the initial volume.
(b)	 The final volume of the gas is four times the initial volume.
(c)	 The final volume of the gas is one-half the initial volume.
(d)	 The final volume of the gas is one-fourth the initial volume.
(e)	 The final volume of the gas is the same as the initial volume.
Avogadro’s Law: Volume and Amount (in Moles)
So far, we have discussed the relationships between volume and pres-
sure, and volume and temperature, but we have considered only a con-
stant amount of a gas. What happens when the amount of gas changes? 
The volume of a gas sample (at constant temperature and pressure) as 
a function of the amount of gas (in moles) in the sample is shown in 
Figure 5.12▶. We can see that the relationship between volume and 
amount is linear. As we might expect, extrapolation to zero moles shows 
zero volume. This relationship, first stated formally by Amedeo Avoga-
dro (1776–1856), is Avogadro’s law.
Avogadro’s law:  V ∝n  (constant T and P)
When the amount of gas in a sample increases at constant temperature 
and pressure, its volume increases in direct proportion because the greater 
number of gas particles fill more space.

Chapter 5  Gases
You experience Avogadro’s law when you inflate a balloon. With each exhaled 
breath, you add more gas particles to the inside of the balloon, increasing its volume. We 
can use Avogadro’s law to calculate the volume of a gas following a change in the amount 
of the gas as long as the pressure and temperature of the gas are constant. For these types of 
calculations, we express Avogadro’s law as:
	
V1
n1
= V2
n2

[5.4]
where V1 and n1 are the initial volume and number of moles of the gas and V2 and n2 are 
the final volume and number of moles. In calculations, we use Avogadro’s law in a man-
ner similar to the other gas laws, as demonstrated in Example 5.4.
Avogadro’s law assumes constant 
temperature and constant pressure 
and is independent of the nature of 
the gas.
Example 5.4	
Avogadro’s Law
A male athlete in a kinesiology research study has a lung volume of 6.15 L during a deep inhalation. At this volume, his 
lungs contain 0.254 mol of air. During exhalation, his lung volume decreases to 2.55 L. How many moles of gas did the 
athlete exhale? Assume constant temperature and pressure.
To solve the problem, first solve Avogadro’s law for the number of moles 
of gas left in the athlete’s lungs after exhalation, n2. Then substitute the 
given quantities to calculate n2. 
Since the lungs initially contained 0.254 mol of air, calculate the 
amount of air exhaled by subtracting the result from 0.254 mol. (In 
Chapter 1, we introduced the practice of underlining the least [right-
most] significant digit of intermediate answers but not rounding the 
final answer until the very end of the calculation. We continue that 
practice throughout the book. However, in order to avoid unnecessary 
notation, we will not carry additional digits in cases, such as this one, 
where doing so does not affect the final answer.)
SOLUTION

n2
 n2 = V2
V1

 = 2.55 L
6.15 L 0.254 mol
 
 =  0.105 mol
 moles exhaled = 0.254 mol - 0.105 mol
 = 0.149 mol
For Practice 5.4  A chemical reaction occurring in a cylinder equipped with a moveable piston produces 0.621 mol 
of a gaseous product. If the cylinder contained 0.120 mol of gas before the reaction and had an initial volume of 2.18 L, 
what is its volume after the reaction? (Assume constant pressure and temperature and that the initial amount of gas 
completely reacts.)
	 5.4	
The Ideal Gas Law
The relationships that we have discussed so far can be combined into a single law that 
encompasses all of them. So far, we have shown that:
 V ∝1
P    (Boyle’s law)
 V ∝T  
 (Charles’s law)
 V ∝n  
 (Avogadro’s law)
Combining these three expressions, we find that V is proportional to nT>P:
V ∝nT
P
The volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas and to 
the temperature of the gas, but is inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas.  
Simple Gas Laws and Ideal 
Gas Law

	
5.4  The Ideal Gas Law	
209
We can replace the proportionality sign with an equals sign by incorporating R, a pro-
portionality constant called the ideal gas constant:
V = RnT
P
Rearranging, we get the equation:
	
PV = nRT 
[5.5]
This equation is the ideal gas law, and a hypothetical gas that exactly follows this law 
is an ideal gas. The value of R, the ideal gas constant, is the same for all gases and has 
the value:
R = 0.08206 L # atm
mol # K
The ideal gas law contains within it the simple gas laws that we have discussed. For 
example, recall that Boyle’s law states that V ∝1>P when the amount of gas (n) and the 
temperature of the gas (T) are kept constant. We can rearrange the ideal gas 
law as follows:
PV = nRT
First, divide both sides by P:
V = nRT
P
Then put the variables that are constant, along with R, in parentheses:
V = (nRT)1
P
Since n and T are constant in this case, and since R is always a constant,  
we can write:
V ∝(constant) * 1
P
which means that V ∝1>P.
The ideal gas law also shows how other pairs of variables are related. For example, 
from Charles’s law we know that V ∝T at constant pressure and constant number of 
moles. But what if we heat a sample of gas at constant volume and constant number of 
moles? This question applies to the warning labels on aerosol cans such as hair spray or 
deodorants. These labels warn against excessive heating or incineration of the can, even 
after the contents are used up. Why? An “empty” aerosol can is not really empty but con-
tains a fixed amount of gas trapped in a fixed volume. What would happen if we were to 
heat the can? We can rearrange the ideal gas law to clearly see the relationship between 
pressure and temperature at constant volume and constant number of moles:
 PV = nRT
 P = nRT
V
= a nRT
V bT
Since n and V are constant and since R is always a constant:
P = (constant) * T
This relationship between pressure and temperature is also known as Gay-Lussac’s 
law. As the temperature of a fixed amount of gas in a fixed volume increases, the pressure 
increases. In an aerosol can, this pressure increase can blow the can apart, which is why 
aerosol cans should not be heated or incinerated. They might explode.
We can use the ideal gas law to determine the value of any one of the four variables 
(P, V, n, or T ) given the other three. To do so, we must express each of the quantities in 
the ideal gas law in the units within R:
• pressure (P) in atm
• volume (V) in L
• moles (n) in mol
• temperature (T) in K

Applications of the Ideal Gas Law: Molar 
Volume, Density, and Molar Mass of a Gas
We just examined how we can use the ideal gas 
law to calculate one of the variables (P, V, T, or n) 
given the other three. We now turn to three other 
applications of the ideal gas law: molar volume, 
density, and molar mass.
Molar Volume at Standard 
Temperature and Pressure
The volume occupied by one mole of a substance 
is its molar volume. For gases, we often spec-
ify the molar volume under conditions known 
as standard temperature (T = 0 °C or 273 K) 
and pressure (P = 1.00 atm), abbreviated as 
STP. Applying the ideal gas law, we can deter-
mine that the molar volume of an ideal gas at 
STP is:
 V = nRT
P
 =
1.00 mol * 0.08206 L # atm
mol # K * 273 K
1.00 atm
 = 22.4 L
SOLVE  To solve the problem, first solve the ideal gas 
law for n.
Before substituting into the equation, convert P and 
T into the correct units.
Finally, substitute into the equation and calculate n.
SOLUTION 
 PV = nRT
 n = PV
RT
 P = 24.3 psi *
1 atm
14.7 psi = 1.6531 atm
(Since rounding the intermediate answer would result in a slightly 
different final answer, mark the least significant digit in the inter-
mediate answer but don’t round until the end.)
 T (K) = 25 + 273 = 298 K
 
 n =
1.6531 atm * 3.24 L
0.08206 L # atm
mol # K * 298 K
= 0.219 mol
CHECK  The units of the answer are correct. The magnitude of the answer (0.219 mol) makes sense because, as you will see 
in the next section, one mole of an ideal gas under standard temperature and pressure (273 K and 1 atm) occupies 22.4 L. 
At a pressure that is 65% higher than standard pressure, the volume of 1 mol of gas is proportionally lower. Since this gas 
sample occupies 3.24 L, the answer of 0.219 mol is reasonable.
For Practice 5.6  What volume does 0.556 mol of gas occupy at a pressure of 715 mmHg and a temperature of 58 °C?
For More Practice 5.6  Determine the pressure in mmHg of a 0.133-g sample of helium gas in a 648-mL container 
at 32 °C.

Chapter 5  Gases
The molar volume of an ideal gas at STP is useful because—as we saw in the Check steps of 
Examples 5.5 and 5.6—it gives us a way to approximate the volume of an ideal gas under 
conditions that are close to STP.
Conceptual 
Connection 5.2 
Molar Volume  Assuming ideal behavior, which of these gas samples has the 
­greatest volume at STP?
(a)	 1 g of H2	
(b)	 1 g of O2	
(c)	 1 g of Ar
Density of a Gas
Since one mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 L under standard temperature and pressure, 
we can readily calculate the density of an ideal gas under these conditions. Because den-
sity is mass>volume, and because the mass of one mole of a gas is simply its molar mass, 
the density of a gas is its molar mass divided by its molar volume:
Density =  molar mass
molar volume
We can calculate the density of a gas at STP by using 22.4 L as the molar volume. For 
example, the densities of helium and nitrogen gas at STP are:
dHe =
4.00 g>mol
22.4 L>mol = 0.179 g>L  dN2 =
28.02 g>mol
22.4 L>mol = 1.25 g>L
Notice that the density of a gas is directly proportional to its molar mass. The greater the 
molar mass of a gas, the more dense the gas. For this reason, a gas with a molar mass 
lower than that of air tends to rise in air. For example, both helium and hydrogen gas 
(molar masses of 4.00 and 2.01 g>mol, respectively) have molar masses that are lower 
than the average molar mass of air (approximately 28.8 g>mol). Therefore, a balloon 
filled with either helium or hydrogen gas floats in air.
We can calculate the density of a gas more generally (under any conditions) by using 
the ideal gas law. To do so, we can arrange the ideal gas law as:
 PV = nRT
 n
V =
P
RT
Since the left-hand side of this equation has units of moles>liter, it represents the molar 
density. We obtain the density in grams>liter from the molar density by multiplying by 
the molar mass (M):

Notice that, as expected, density increases with increasing molar mass. Notice also that, 
as we discussed in Section 5.3, density decreases with increasing temperature.

oxygen (about one-fifth). We discuss

­follows that the density is lower.
For Practice 5.7  Calculate the density of xenon gas at a pressure of 742 mmHg and a temperature of 45 °C.

Molar Mass of a Gas
We can use the ideal gas law in combination with mass measurements to calculate the 
molar mass of an unknown gas. First, we measure the mass and volume of an unknown 
gas under conditions of known pressure and temperature. Then, we determine the 
amount of the gas in moles from the ideal gas law. Finally, we calculate the molar mass by 
dividing the mass (in grams) by the amount (in moles) as demonstrated in Example 5.8.

Molar Mass of a Gas
A sample of gas has a mass of 0.311 g. Its volume is 0.225 L at a temperature of 55 °C and a pressure of 886 mmHg. Find its 
molar mass.
SORT  The problem gives you the mass of a gas sample, 
along with its volume, temperature, and pressure. You are 
asked to find the molar mass.
GIVEN:  m = 0.331 g, V = 0.225 L,
T (°C) = 55 °C, P = 886 mmHg
FIND:  molar mass (g>mol)
STRATEGIZE  The conceptual plan has two parts. In the 
first part, use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles 
of gas.
In the second part, use the definition of molar mass to 
determine the molar mass.

Before substituting into the equation for n, convert the

Then substitute into the equation and calculate n, the

mass. If you calculated a very small number (such as any number smaller than 1) or a very large number, you solved the 
problem incorrectly. Most gases have molar masses between one and several hundred grams per mole.

Mixtures of Gases and Partial 
Pressures
Many gas samples are not pure, but are mixtures of gases. Dry air, for example, is a 
­mixture containing nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and a few other gases in 
trace amounts (Table 5.3).

Because the molecules in an ideal gas do not interact (as we will discuss further in 
Section 5.8), each of the components in an ideal gas mixture acts independently of the 
others. For example, the nitrogen molecules in air exert a certain pressure—78% of the 
total pressure—that is independent of the other gases in the mixture. Likewise, the oxy-
gen molecules in air exert a certain pressure—21% of the total pressure—that is also 
independent of the other gases in the mixture. The pressure due to any individual com-
ponent in a gas mixture is its partial pressure (Pn). We can calculate partial pressure 
from the ideal gas law by assuming that each gas component acts independently.
Pn = nn
RT
V  
For a multicomponent gas mixture, we calculate the partial pressure of each compo-
nent from the ideal gas law and the number of moles of that component (nn) as follows:
	
Pa = na RT
V ; Pb = nb RT
V ; Pc = nc RT
V ; c 
[5.7]
The sum of the partial pressures of the components in a gas mixture equals the total 
pressure:
	
Ptotal = Pa + Pb + Pc + c 
[5.8]
where Ptotal is the total pressure and Pa, Pb, Pc, care the partial pressures of the 
­components. This relationship is known as Dalton’s law of partial pressures.
Combining Equations 5.7 and 5.8, we get:
 Ptotal = Pa + Pb + Pc + c
 = na
RT
V + nb

[5.9]
The total number of moles in the mixture, when substituted into the ideal gas law, indi-
cates the total pressure of the sample.
If we divide Equation 5.7 by Equation 5.9, we get:
Pa
Ptotal
=
na(RT>V)
ntotal(RT>V) =
na
ntotal

[5.10]
The quantity na>ntotal, the number of moles of a component in a mixture divided by the 
total number of moles in the mixture, is the mole fraction (xa):
	
xa =
na
ntotal

[5.11]
Rearranging Equation 5.10 and substituting the definition of mole fraction gives:
Pa
Ptotal

Pa =

  Ptotal = xaPtotal
or simply
	
Pa = xaPtotal 
[5.12]
The partial pressure of a component in a gaseous mixture is its mole fraction multi-
plied by the total pressure. For gases, the mole fraction of a component is equivalent to 
its percent by volume divided by 100%. Therefore, based on Table 5.3, we calculate the 
partial pressure of nitrogen (PN2) in air at 1.00 atm as:
 PN2 = 0.78 * 1.00 atm
 = 0.78 atm

216	
Chapter 5  Gases
Likewise, the partial pressure of oxygen in air at 1.00 atm is 0.21 atm and the partial 
pressure of Ar in air is 0.009 atm. Applying Dalton’s law of partial pressures to air at 
1.00 atm, we can find the total pressure:
 Ptotal = PN2 + PO2 +  PAr
 Ptotal = 0.78 atm + 0.21 atm + 0.009 atm
 = 1.00 atm
For these purposes, we can ignore 
the contribution of the CO2 and other 
trace gases because they are so 
small.

SORT  The problem gives you the partial pressures of two of 
the three components in a gas mixture, along with the total

STRATEGIZE  You can find the mass of argon from the 
number of moles of argon, which you can calculate from the 
partial pressure of argon and the ideal gas law. Begin by using 
Dalton’s law to determine the partial pressure of argon.
Then use the partial pressure of argon together with the vol-
ume of the sample and the temperature to find the number 
of moles of argon.

Deep-Sea Diving and Partial Pressures
Our lungs have evolved to breathe oxygen at a partial pressure 
of PO2 = 0.21 atm. If the total pressure decreases—when we 
climb a mountain, for example—the partial pressure of oxy-
gen also decreases. On top of Mount Everest, where the total 
pressure is 0.311 atm, the partial pressure of oxygen is only 
0.065 atm. Low oxygen levels produce a physiological condi-
tion called hypoxia or oxygen starvation (Figure 5.13▶). Mild 
hypoxia causes dizziness, headache, and shortness of breath. 
Severe hypoxia, which occurs when PO2 drops below 0.1 atm, 
may result in unconsciousness or even death. For this reason, 
climbers hoping to make the summit of Mount Everest usually 
carry oxygen to breathe.
Though not as dangerous as a lack of oxygen, too much 
oxygen can also cause physiological problems. Recall from 
Section 5.3 that scuba divers breathe pressurized air. At 30 m, 
a scuba diver breathes air at a total pressure of 4.0 atm, making PO2 about 0.84 atm. 
This elevated partial pressure of oxygen raises the density of oxygen molecules in 
the lungs, resulting in a higher concentration of oxygen in body tissues. When PO2 
increases beyond 1.4 atm, the increased oxygen concentration in body tissues causes 
a condition called oxygen toxicity, which results in muscle twitching, tunnel 
vision, and convulsions. Divers who venture too deep without proper precautions 
have drowned because of oxygen toxicity. A second problem associated with breath-
ing pressurized air is the increase of nitrogen in the lungs. At 30 m, a scuba diver 
breathes nitrogen at PN2 = 3.12 atm, which increases the nitrogen concentration in 
body tissues and fluids. When PN2 increases beyond about 4 atm, a condition called 
nitrogen narcosis or rapture of the deep results. Divers describe this condition as 
feeling inebriated or drunk. A diver breathing compressed air at 60 m feels as if he 
has consumed too much wine.
To avoid oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narco-
sis, deep-sea divers—those who descend beyond 
50 m—breathe specialized mixtures of gases. One 
common mixture is heliox, a mixture of helium 
and oxygen. These mixtures usually contain a 
smaller percentage of oxygen than would be found 
in air, thereby lowering the risk of oxygen toxicity. 
Heliox also contains helium instead of nitrogen, 
eliminating the risk of nitrogen narcosis.
CHECK  The units of the answer are correct. The magnitude of the answer makes sense because the volume is 1.0 L, which 
at STP would contain about 1>22 mol. Since the partial pressure of argon in the mixture is about 1>3 of the total pressure, 
you can roughly estimate about 1>66 of one molar mass of argon, which is fairly close to your answer.
For Practice 5.9  A sample of hydrogen gas is mixed with water vapor. The mixture has a total pressure of 755 torr,

To calculate partial pressures calculate the total pressure and 
then use the mole fractions from the previous part to calcu-
late the partial pressures. Calculate the total pressure from 
the sum of the moles of both components. (Alternatively, 
you can calculate the partial pressures of the components 
individually, using the number of moles of each component. 
Then you can sum them to obtain the total pressure.)

Collecting Gases over Water
When the desired product of a chemical reaction is a gas, the gas is often collected by the 
displacement of water. For example, suppose we use the reaction of zinc with hydrochlo-
ric acid as a source of hydrogen gas:
Zn(s) + 2 HCl(aq) ¡ ZnCl2(aq) + H2(g)
To collect the gas, we can set up an apparatus like the one shown in Figure 5.14▼. As 
the hydrogen gas forms, it bubbles through the water and gathers in the collection 
flask. The hydrogen gas collected in this way is not pure, however. It is mixed with 
water vapor because some water molecules evaporate and combine with the hydro-
gen molecules.
The partial pressure of water in the mixture, called its vapor pressure, depends on 
temperature (Table 5.4). Vapor pressure increases with increasing temperature because 
higher temperatures cause more water molecules to evaporate. We will discuss vapor 
pressure more thoroughly in Chapter 11.
Suppose we collect hydrogen gas over water at a total pressure of 758.2 mmHg and a 
temperature of 25 °C. What is the partial pressure of the hydrogen gas? We know that 
the total pressure is 758.2 mmHg and that the partial pressure of water is 23.78 mmHg 
(its vapor pressure at 25 °C):
 Ptotal = PH2 + PH2O
 758.2 mmHg = PH2 + 23.78 mmHg
Therefore,
 PH2 = 758.2 mmHg - 23.78 mmHg
 = 734.4 mmHg
The partial pressure of the hydrogen in the mixture is 734.4 mmHg.

from the amount of oxygen in moles, which you 
can calculate from the ideal gas law if you know the

oxygen in the mixture by subtracting the partial 
pressure of water at 293 K (20 °C) from the total 
­pressure.
Next, use the ideal gas law to determine the number

Gases in Chemical Reactions: 
Stoichiometry Revisited
In Chapter 4, we discussed how to use the coefficients in chemical equations as conver-
sion factors between number of moles of reactants and number of moles of products in 
a chemical reaction. We can use these conversion factors to determine, for example, the 
mass of product obtained in a chemical reaction based on a given mass of reactant, or 
the mass of one reactant needed to react completely with a given mass of another reac-
tant. The general conceptual plan for these kinds of calculations is:
mass B
amount B (in moles)
amount A (in moles)
mass A
where A and B are two different substances involved in the reaction and the conversion 
factor between amounts (in moles) of each comes from the stoichiometric coefficients 
in the balanced chemical equation.
In reactions involving gaseous reactant or products, we often specify the quan-
tity of a gas in terms of its volume at a given temperature and pressure. As we have 
seen, stoichiometry involves relationships between amounts in moles. For stoichio-
metric calculations involving gases, we can use the ideal gas law to determine the 
amounts in moles from the volumes, or to determine the volumes from the amounts 
in moles.
n = PV
RT  V = nRT
P
The general conceptual plan for these kinds of calculations is:
P, V, T of gas B
amount B (in moles)
amount A (in moles)
P, V, T of gas A
Examples 5.12 and 5.13 demonstrate this kind of calculation.
—Continued on the next page
CHECK  The answer is in the correct units. You can quickly check the magnitude of the answer by using molar volume. 
Under STP one liter is about 1>22 of one mole. Therefore the answer should be about 1>22 the molar mass of oxygen 
(1>22 * 32 = 1.45). The magnitude of the answer seems reasonable.
For Practice 5.11  A common way to make hydrogen gas in the laboratory is to place a metal such as zinc in 
hydrochloric acid. The hydrochloric acid reacts with the metal to produce hydrogen gas, which is then collected over 
water. Suppose a student carries out this reaction and collects a total of 154.4 mL of gas at a pressure of 742 mmHg and a 
temperature of 25 °C. What mass of hydrogen gas (in mg) does the student collect?

by using the molar mass.
Then use the stoichiometric relationship from the bal-

more than one molar mass of methanol, which is therefore slightly more than one mole of methanol. From the equation 
you can see that you need 2 mol hydrogen to make 1 mol methanol, so the answer must be slightly greater than  
2 mol hydrogen. Under standard temperature and pressure, slightly more than 2 mol hydrogen occupies slightly more 
than 2 * 22.4 L = 44.8 L. At a temperature greater than standard temperature, the volume would be even greater; there-
fore, your answer is reasonable.

Kinetic Molecular Theory:  
A Model for Gases
In Chapter 1, we discussed how the scientific approach proceeds from observations to 
laws and eventually to theories. Remember that laws summarize behavior—for example, 
Charles’s law summarizes how the volume of a gas depends on temperature—whereas 
theories give the underlying reasons for the behavior. A theory of gas behavior explains, 
for example, why the volume of a gas increases with increasing temperature.
The simplest model for the behavior of gases is the kinetic molecular theory. In 
this theory, a gas is modeled as a collection of particles (either molecules or atoms, 
depending on the gas) in constant motion (Figure 5.15◀). A single particle moves in a 
straight line until it collides with another particle (or with the wall of the container). 
Kinetic molecular theory has three basic postulates (or assumptions):
1.	 The size of a particle is negligibly small.  Kinetic molecular theory assumes 
that the particles themselves occupy negligible volume, even though they have mass. 
This postulate is justified because, under normal pressures, the space between atoms or 
molecules in a gas is very large compared to the size of the atoms or molecules them-
selves. For example, in a sample of argon gas at STP, only about 0.01% of the volume is 
occupied by atoms, and the average distance from one argon atom to another is 3.3 
nm. In comparison, the atomic radius of argon is 97 pm. If an argon atom were the size 
of a golf ball, its nearest neighbor would be, on average, over 4 ft (1.2 m) away at STP.
2.	 The average kinetic energy of a particle is proportional to the tempera-
ture in kelvins.  The motion of atoms or molecules in a gas is due to thermal energy, 
which distributes itself among the particles in the gas. At any given moment, some par-
ticles are moving faster than others—there is a distribution of velocities—but the high-
er the temperature, the faster the overall motion and the greater the average kinetic 
energy. Notice that kinetic energy (1
2 mv2)—not velocity—is proportional to temperature. 
The atoms in a sample of helium and a sample of argon at the same temperature have 
the same average kinetic energy but not the same average velocity. Because the helium 
atoms are lighter, they must move faster to have the same kinetic energy as argon atoms.
3.	 The collision of one particle with another (or with the walls of its con-
tainer) is completely elastic.  When two particles collide, they may exchange  
energy, but there is no overall loss of energy. Any kinetic energy lost by one particle is 
completely gained by the other. In other words, the particles have no “stickiness,” 
and they are not deformed by the collision. An encounter between two particles in 
kinetic molecular theory is more like the collision between two billiard balls than 
the collision between two lumps of clay (Figure 5.16▼). Between collisions, the 
particles do not exert any forces on one another.
Kinetic Molecular Theory
▲ Figure 5.15  A Model for Gas 
Behavior  In the kinetic molecular 
theory of gases, a gas sample is 
modeled as a collection of particles 
in constant straight-line motion. The 
size of each particle is negligibly 
small, and the particles’ collisions 
are elastic.
Elastic collision
Inelastic collision
▲ Figure 5.16  Elastic versus Inelastic Collisions  When two billiard balls collide, the 
collision is elastic—the total kinetic energy of the colliding bodies is the same before and after 
the collision. When two lumps of clay collide, the collision is inelastic—the kinetic energy of 
the colliding bodies dissipates in the form of heat during the collision.
Kinetic Molecular Theory

	
5.8  Kinetic Molecular Theory: A Model for Gases 	
225
If we start with the postulates of kinetic molecular theory, we can mathematically 
derive the ideal gas law (as we demonstrate later). Since the ideal gas law follows directly 
from kinetic molecular theory, we have confidence that the assumptions of the theory 
are valid, at least under conditions where the ideal gas law applies.
How Kinetic Molecular Theory Explains Pressure and 
the Simple Gas Laws
Let’s examine how the concept of pressure as well as each of the gas laws we have exam-
ined in this chapter follow conceptually from kinetic molecular theory.
The Nature of Pressure
In Section 5.2, we defined pressure as force divided by area:
P = F
A
From Newton’s second law, the force (F) associated with an individual collision is given 
by F = ma, where m is the mass of the particle and a is its acceleration as it changes its 
direction of travel due to the collision.
According to kinetic molecular theory, a gas is a collection of particles in constant 
motion. The motion results in collisions between the particles and the surfaces around 
them. As each particle collides with a surface, it exerts a force upon that surface. The 
result of many particles in a gas sample exerting forces on the surfaces around them is a 
constant pressure.
Boyle’s Law
Boyle’s law states that for a constant number of particles at constant temperature, the 
volume of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure. According to kinetic molecular 
theory, if we decrease the volume of a gas, we force the gas particles to occupy a smaller 
space. As long as the temperature remains the same, the number of collisions with the 
surrounding surfaces (per unit surface area) must necessarily increase, resulting in a 
greater pressure.
Charles’s Law
Charles’s law states that for a constant number of particles at constant pressure, the 
volume of a gas is proportional to its temperature. According to kinetic molecular the-
ory, when we increase the temperature of a gas, the average speed, and thus the aver-
age kinetic energy, of the particles increases. Since this greater kinetic energy results in 
more frequent collisions and more force per collision, the pressure of the gas increases if 
its volume is held constant (Gay-Lussac’s law). The only way for the pressure to remain 
constant is for the volume to increase. The greater volume spreads the collisions out over 
a greater surface area so that the pressure (defined as force per unit area) is unchanged.
Avogadro’s Law
Avogadro’s law states that at constant temperature and pressure, the volume of a gas is 
proportional to the number of particles. According to kinetic molecular theory, when 
we increase the number of particles in a gas sample, the number of collisions with the 
surrounding surfaces increases. The greater number of collisions results in a greater over-
all force on surrounding surfaces; the only way for the pressure to remain constant is for 
the volume to increase so that the number of particles per unit volume (and thus the 
number of collisions) remains constant.
Dalton’s Law
Dalton’s law states that the total pressure of a gas mixture is the sum of the partial pres-
sures of its components. According to Dalton’s law, the components in a gas mixture 
act identically to, and independently of, one another. According to kinetic molecu-
lar theory, the particles have negligible size and they do not interact. Consequently, 
the only property that distinguishs one type of particle from another is its mass. 

226	
Chapter 5  Gases
However, even particles of different masses have the same average kinetic energy at a 
given temperature, so they exert the same force upon collision with a surface. Conse-
quently, adding components to a gas mixture—even different kinds of gases—has the 
same effect as simply adding more particles. The partial pressures of all the compo-
nents sum to the overall pressure.

Kinetic Molecular Theory I  As described by kinetic molecular theory, depict 
a gas sample containing equal molar amounts of argon and xenon. Use red dots to rep-
resent argon atoms and blue dots to represent xenon atoms. Give each atom a “tail” to 
represent its velocity relative to the others in the mixture.
Kinetic Molecular Theory and the Ideal Gas Law
We have just seen how each of the gas laws conceptually follows from kinetic molecu-
lar theory. We can also derive the ideal gas law from the postulates of kinetic molecular 
theory. In other words, the kinetic molecular theory is a quantitative model that implies 
PV = nRT. Let’s explore this derivation.
The pressure on a wall of a container (Figure 5.17▼) occupied by particles in con-
stant motion is the total force on the wall (due to the collisions) divided by the area of 
the wall.
	
P = Ftotal
A 
[5.13]
Recall that the force (F) associated with an individual collision is given by F =  ma, 
where m is the mass of the particle and a is its acceleration as it changes its direction of 
travel due to the collision. The acceleration for each collision is the change in velocity 
(∆v) divided by the time interval (∆t), so the force imparted for each collision is:
	
Fcollision = m ∆v
∆t 
[5.14]
If a particle collides elastically with the wall, it bounces off the wall with no loss of 
energy. For a straight-line collision, the change in velocity is 2v (the particle’s velocity 
was v before the collision and -v after the collision; therefore, the change is 2v). The 
force per collision is given by:
	
Fcollision = m 2v
∆t
[5.15]
The total number of collisions in the time interval ∆t on a wall of surface area A is 
proportional to the number of particles that can reach the wall in this time interval—in 
other words, all particles within a distance of v∆t of the wall. These particles occupy a 
Area = A
v∆t

[5.18]
Notice that Equation 5.18 contains within it Boyle’s law (P ∝1>V) and Avogadro’s 
law (V ∝n). We can get the complete ideal gas law from postulate 2 of the kinetic molec-
ular theory, which states that the average kinetic energy (1
2 mv2) is proportional to the 
temperature in kelvins (T):
	
mv2 ∝T
[5.19]
By combining Equations 5.18 and 5.19, we get:
P ∝T * n
V
	
PV ∝nT
[5.20]
The proportionality can be replaced by an equals sign if we provide the correct constant, R:
	
PV = nRT
[5.21]
In other words, the kinetic molecular theory (a model for how gases behave) pre-
dicts behavior that is consistent with our observations and measurements of gases—the 
theory agrees with the experiment. Recall from Chapter 1 that a scientific theory is the 
most powerful kind of scientific knowledge. In the kinetic molecular theory, we have a 
model for what a gas is like. Although the model is not perfect—indeed, it breaks down 
under certain conditions, as we shall see later in this chapter—it predicts a great deal 
about the behavior of gases. Therefore, the model is a good approximation of what a gas 
is actually like. A careful examination of the conditions under which the model breaks 
down (see Section 5.10) gives us even more insight into the behavior of gases.
Temperature and Molecular Velocities
According to kinetic molecular theory, particles of different masses have the same aver-
age kinetic energy at a given temperature. The kinetic energy of a particle depends on its 
mass and velocity according to the equation:
KE = 1
2 mv2
The only way for particles of different masses to have the same kinetic energy is for them 
to have different velocities as we saw in Conceptual Connection 5.6. In a gas mixture at a 
given temperature, lighter particles travel faster (on average) than heavier ones.

228	
Chapter 5  Gases
In kinetic molecular theory, we define the root mean square velocity (urms) of a 
particle as:
	
urms = 3u 2
[5.22]
where u2 is the average of the squares of the particle velocities. Even though the root 
mean square velocity of a collection of particles is not identical to the average velocity, 
the two are close in value and conceptually similar. Root mean square velocity is a spe-
cial type of average. The average kinetic energy of one mole of gas particles is given by 
the equation:
	
KEavg = 1
2NAmu 2
[5.23]
where NA is Avogadro’s number, and m is the mass of the particle.
Postulate 2 of the kinetic molecular theory states that the average kinetic energy is 
proportional to the temperature in kelvins. The constant of proportionality in this rela-
tionship is (3>2) R:
	
KEavg = (3>2)RT
[5.24]
where R is the gas constant, but in different units (R = 8.314 J>mol # K) than those we 
use in the ideal gas law. If we combine Equations 5.23 and 5.24, and solve for u 2, we get:
(1>2) NAmu2 = (3>2)RT
u2 =
(3>2)RT
(1>2)NAm = 3RT
NAm
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
	
3u 2 = urms = B
3RT
NAm
[5.25]
In Equation 5.25, m is the mass of a particle in kg and NA is Avogadro’s number. The 
product NAm, then, is the molar mass in kg>mol. If we call this quantity M, then the 
expression for mean square velocity as a function of temperature becomes the following 
important result:
	
urms = B
3RT
M

[5.26]
The root mean square velocity of a collection of gas particles is proportional to the 
square root of the temperature in kelvins and inversely proportional to the square root 
of the molar mass of the particles (which because of the units of R must be in kilograms 
per mole). The root mean square velocity of nitrogen molecules at 25 °C, for example, is  
515 m>s (1152 mi>hr). The root mean square velocity of hydrogen molecules at room 
temperature is 1920 m>s (4295 mi>hr). Notice that the lighter molecules move much 
faster at a given temperature.
The (3>2) R proportionality constant 
comes from a derivation that is 
beyond the scope of this textbook.

we will discuss in more detail in

The root mean square velocity, as we have seen, is a kind of average velocity. Some 
particles move faster and some move more slowly than this average. The velocities of all 
the particles in a gas sample form distributions like those shown in Figure 5.18▲. We can 
see from these distributions that some particles indeed travel at the root mean square 
velocity. However, many particles travel faster and many travel more slowly  than the root 
mean square velocity. For lighter particles, such as helium and hydrogen, the velocity dis-
tribution is shifted toward higher velocities and the curve becomes broader, indicating a 
wider range of velocities. Figure 5.19▶ illustrates the velocity distribution for nitrogen at 
different temperatures. As the temperature increases, the root mean square velocity 
increases and the distribution becomes broader.

Mean Free Path, Diffusion,  
and Effusion of Gases
We have just seen that the root mean square velocity of gas molecules at room tem-
perature is in the range of hundreds of meters per second. However, suppose that your 
roommate just put on too much perfume in the bathroom only 6 ft (1.8 m) away. Why 
does it take a minute or two before you can smell the fragrance? Although most mol-
ecules in a perfume bottle have higher molar masses than nitrogen, their velocities are 
still hundreds of meters per second, so why the delay? The answer is that even though 
gaseous particles travel at tremendous speeds, they also travel in haphazard paths (Fig-
ure 5.20▶). To a perfume molecule, the path from the perfume bottle in the bathroom 
to your nose 6 ft away is much like a bargain hunter’s path through a busy shopping 
mall during a clearance sale. The molecule travels only a short distance before it col-
lides with another molecule and changes direction, only to collide again, and so on. In 
fact, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, a molecule in the air experiences 

	
5.9  Mean Free Path, Diffusion, and Effusion of Gases 	
231
several billion collisions per second. The average distance that 
a molecule travels between collisions is its mean free path. At 
room temperature and atmospheric pressure, the mean free path 
of a nitrogen molecule with a molecular diameter of 300 pm 
(four times the covalent radius) is 93 nm, or about 310 molecular 
diameters. If the nitrogen molecule were the size of a golf ball, 
it would travel about 40 ft between collisions. Mean free path 
increases with decreasing pressure. Under conditions of ultrahigh 
vacuum (10 - 10 torr), the mean free path of a nitrogen molecule 
is hundreds of kilometers.
The process by which gas molecules spread out in response 
to a concentration gradient is diffusion, and even though the 
particles undergo many collisions, the root mean square velocity 
still influences the rate of diffusion. Heavier molecules diffuse 
more slowly than lighter ones, so the first molecules you smell 
from a perfume mixture (in a room with no air currents) are the 
lighter ones.
A process related to diffusion is effusion, the process by 
which a gas escapes from a container into a vacuum through a 
small hole (Figure 5.21▼). The rate of effusion is also related to 
root mean square velocity—heavier molecules effuse more 
slowly than lighter ones. The rate of effusion—the amount of gas 
that effuses in a given time—is inversely proportional to the 
square root of the molar mass of the gas as follows:
rate ∝
1
2M
The ratio of effusion rates of two different gases is given by Graham’s law of effusion, 
named after Thomas Graham (1805–1869):
	
rateA
rateB
= A
MB
MA

[5.27]
In this expression, rateA and rateB are the effusion rates of gases A and B, and MA and MB 
are their molar masses.
Graham’s law explains, in part, why helium balloons only float for a day or so. 
Because helium has such a low molar mass, it escapes from the balloon quite quickly. A 
balloon filled with air, by contrast, remains inflated longer.
Typical Gas Molecule Path
Te average distance between collisions is the mean free path.

CHECK  The units of the answer are correct. The magnitude of the answer seems reasonable for the molar mass of a gas.

Nonideal Behavior: The effect of particle volume
◀ Figure 5.24  The Effect of Particle 
Volume  At high pressures, 1 mol of argon 
occupies a larger volume than 1 mol of an 
ideal gas because of the volume of the argon 
atoms themselves. (This example was chosen 
to minimize the effects of intermolecular forces, 
which are very small in argon at 500 K, thereby 
isolating the effect of particle volume.)
very close to 22.41 L, meaning that they act very nearly as ideal gases. Gases behave ide-
ally when both of the following are true: (a) the volume of the gas particles is small com-
pared to the space between them, and (b) the forces between the gas particles are not 
significant. At STP, these assumptions are valid for most common gases. However, these 
assumptions break down at higher pressures or lower temperatures.
The Effect of the Finite Volume of Gas Particles
The finite volume of gas particles—that is, their 
actual sizes—becomes important at high pres-
sure because the volume of the particles them-
selves occupies a significant portion of the total 
gas volume (Figure 5.23▶). We can see the effect 
of particle volume by comparing the molar vol-
ume of argon to the molar volume of an ideal 
gas as a function of pressure at 500 K as shown 
in Figure 5.24▼. At low pressures, the molar 
volume of argon is nearly identical to that of an 
ideal gas. But as the pressure increases, the molar 
volume of argon becomes greater than that of 
an ideal gas. At the higher pressures, the argon 
atoms themselves occupy a significant portion 
of the gas volume, making the actual volume 
greater than that predicted by the ideal gas law.
▲ Figure 5.23  Particle Volume and Ideal Behavior  As a gas is 
compressed, the gas particles themselves begin to occupy a significant portion 
of the total gas volume, leading to deviations from ideal behavior.
In 1873, Johannes van der Waals (1837–1923) modified the ideal gas equation to fit the 
behavior of real gases. From the graph for argon in Figure 5.24 we can see that the ideal gas 
law predicts a volume that is too small. Van der Waals suggested a small correction factor 
that accounts for the volume of the gas particles themselves:
Ideal behavior         V = nRT
P
	
Corrected for volume of gas particles V = nRT
P

[5.28]
The correction adds the quantity nb to the volume, where n is the number of moles and 
b is a constant that depends on the gas (see Table 5.5). We can rearrange the corrected 
equation as follows:
	
(V - nb) = nRT

Chapter 5  Gases
The Effect of Intermolecular Forces
Intermolecular forces, which we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 11, are attrac-
tions between the atoms or molecules that compose any substance. These attractions 
are typically small in gases and therefore do not matter much at low pressure because 
the molecules are too far apart to “feel” the attractions. They also do not matter much 
at high temperatures because the molecules have a lot of kinetic energy. Therefore a 
weak attraction between them does not affect the collision much. At lower tempera-
tures, however, the collisions occur with less kinetic energy, and weak attractions can 
affect the collisions. We can understand this difference with an analogy to billiard balls. 
Imagine two billiard balls coated with a substance that makes them slightly sticky. If 
they collide when moving at high velocities, the stickiness will not have much of an 
effect—the balls bounce off one another as if the sticky substance was not even there. 
However, if the two billiard balls collide when moving very slowly (say barely rolling), 
the sticky substance would have an effect. The billiard balls might even stick together 
and not bounce off one another.
The effect of these weak attractions between particles is a decrease in the number 
of collisions with the surfaces of the container and a corresponding decrease in the 
pressure compared to that of an ideal gas. We can see the effect of intermolecular 
forces when we compare the pressure of 1.0 mol of xenon gas to the pressure of 1.0 mol 
of an ideal gas as a function of temperature and at a fixed volume of 1.0 L, as shown in 
Figure 5.25▼. At high temperature, the pressure of the xenon gas is nearly identical to 
that of an ideal gas. But at lower temperatures, the pressure of xenon is less than that of 
an ideal gas. At the lower temperatures, the xenon atoms spend more time interacting 
with each other and less time colliding with the walls, making the actual pressure less 
than that predicted by the ideal gas law.
From the graph for xenon shown in Figure 5.25 we can see that the ideal gas law 
predicts a pressure that is too large at low temperatures. Van der Waals suggested a small 
correction factor that accounts for the intermolecular forces between gas particles:

Corrected for intermolecular forces P = nRT

[5.30]
The correction subtracts the quantity a(n>V)2 from the pressure, where n is the number 
of moles, V is the volume, and a is a constant that depends on the gas (see Table 5.5). 
Notice that the correction factor increases as n>V (the number of moles of particles per

Van der Waals Equation
We can combine the effects of particle volume (Equation 5.29) and particle intermolec-

This equation is the van der Waals equation and we can use it to calculate the proper-
ties of a gas under nonideal conditions.
Real Gases
We can see the combined effects of particle volume and intermolecular forces by exam-
ining a plot of PV>RT versus P for 1 mol of a number of real gases (Figure 5.26▼). For an 
ideal gas, PV>RT = n, the number of moles of gas. Therefore, for 1 mol of an ideal gas, 
PV>RT is equal to 1, as shown in the plot. For real gases, PV>RT deviates from 1, but the 
deviations are not uniform. For example, water displays a large negative deviation from 
PV>RT because, for water, the effect of intermolecular forces on lowering the pressure 
(relative to an ideal gas) is far greater than the effect of particle size on increasing the 
volume. Notice from Table 5.5 that water has a high value of a, the constant that cor-
rects for intermolecular forces, but a moderate value of b, the constant that corrects for 
particle size. Therefore, PV>RT for water is lower than predicted from the ideal gas law.
By contrast, consider the behavior of helium, which displays a positive deviation 
from the ideal behavior. This is because helium has very weak intermolecular forces and 
the effect of these forces on lowering the pressure (relative to ideal gas) is small com-
pared to the effect of particle size on increasing the volume. Therefore  PV>RT for helium 
is greater than predicted from the ideal gas law.

Key Concepts
Pressure (5.1, 5.2)
▶
▶Gas pressure is the force per unit area that results from gas par-
ticles colliding with the surfaces around them. We use various 
units to measure pressure including mmHg, torr, Pa, psi, in Hg, 
and atm.
The Simple Gas Laws (5.3)
▶
▶The simple gas laws express relationships between pairs of vari-
ables when other variables are constant.
▶
▶Boyle’s law states that the volume of a gas is inversely propor-
tional to its pressure.
▶
▶Charles’s law states that the volume of a gas is directly propor-
tional to its temperature.
▶
▶Avogadro’s law states that the volume of a gas is directly propor-
tional to the amount (in moles).
The Ideal Gas Law and Its Applications (5.4, 5.5)
▶
▶The ideal gas law, PV = nRT, describes the relationship among all 
four gas variables and contains the simple gas laws within it.
▶
▶We can use the ideal gas law to find one of the four variables given 
the other three. We can use it to calculate the molar volume of an 
ideal gas, which is 22.4 L at STP, and to calculate the density and 
molar mass of a gas.
Mixtures of Gases and Partial Pressures (5.6)
▶
▶In a mixture of gases, each gas acts independently of the others so 
that any overall property of the mixture is the sum of the proper-
ties of the individual components.
▶
▶The pressure of any individual component is its partial pressure.
Gas Stoichiometry (5.7)
▶
▶In reactions involving gaseous reactants and products, we often 
report quantities in volumes at specified pressures and tempera-
tures. We can convert these quantities to amounts (in moles) 
using the ideal gas law. Then we can use the stoichiometric coef-
ficients from the balanced equation to determine the stoichiomet-
ric amounts of other reactants or products.
▶
▶The general form for these types of calculations is: volume A S  
amount A (in moles) S  amount B (in moles) S  quantity of B (in 
desired units).
▶
▶In cases where the reaction is carried out at STP, we can use the 
molar volume at STP (22.4 L = 1 mol) to convert between volume 
in liters and amount in moles.

Chapter 5  Gases
Kinetic Molecular Theory and Its Applications  
(5.8, 5.9)
▶
▶Kinetic molecular theory is a quantitative model for gases. The 
theory has three main assumptions: (1) gas particles are negligibly 
small, (2) the average kinetic energy of a gas particle is proportional 
to the temperature in kelvins, and (3) the collision of one gas parti-
cle with another is completely elastic (the particles do not stick to-
gether). The gas laws all follow from the kinetic molecular theory.
▶
▶We can use kinetic molecular theory to derive the expression 
for the root mean square velocity of gas particles. This veloc-
ity is inversely proportional to the molar mass of the gas, and 
therefore—at a given temperature—smaller gas particles are (on 
average) moving more quickly than larger ones.
▶
▶The kinetic molecular theory also allows us to predict the mean 
free path of a gas particle (the distance it travels between colli-
sions) and relative rates of diffusion or effusion.
Real Gases (5.10)
▶
▶Real gases differ from ideal gases to the extent that they do not 
always fit the assumptions of kinetic molecular theory.
▶
▶These assumptions tend to break down at high pressures where 
the volume is higher than predicted for an ideal gas because the 
particles are no longer negligibly small compared to the space 
between them.
▶
▶The assumptions also break down at low temperatures where the 
pressure is lower than predicted because the attraction between 
molecules combined with low kinetic energies causes partially 
inelastic collisions.
▶
▶The van der Waals equation predicts gas properties under noni-
deal conditions.

Data Interpretation and Analysis
Nitrogen Oxide from Automobiles
	153.	Air contains about 78.08% nitrogen gas, 20.95% oxygen gas, 
and 0.97% other gases by volume. When air is combusted in 
­automobile engines, nitrogen oxide gases form. One of these 
gases, nitric oxide (NO), rapidly oxidizes in air to form nitrogen 
­dioxide (NO2).
Scientists are concerned about the level of NOx gas (NOx is 
the term used to refer collectively to nitrogen oxide gases) 
being emitted by automobile exhaust. People breathing air 
with elevated levels of NO2 gas are susceptible to increased inci-
dence of asthma attacks, respiratory infection, and inflamma-
tion of the breathing airways, which leads to coughing and 
wheezing. As a result, government and state regulations require 
new cars to emit less nitrogen oxide gas than new cars did in 
the past and older cars to have yearly inspections to check the 
efficiency of their ­engines. One purpose of a three-way cata-
lytic converter is to convert the NOx gases produced as a by-
product of the combustion of gasoline with air to N2 and O2.
The EPA mandates that the overall average concentration 
of nitrogen dioxide in the air not exceed 0.053 ppmv and not 
exceed a one-hour average of 0.100 ppmv. Monitoring gas pol-
lutants in cities allows engineers and scientists to caution the 
public about possible health risks. Figure a▶ charts the aver-
age concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), 
gases over seven days from nine gas detection stations located 
equal distances from each other in a city. The particular gas 
detection system employed in this city can measure the con-
centration of NO2, O3, and CO gases but does not measure the 
concentration of NO.

Parts-per-billion-volume (ppbv) or parts-per-million-volume 
(ppmv) units are used in gas measurements. This unit is based on 
volume-to-volume ratio and is not the same as parts-per-billion 
(or parts-per-million) used in ­aqueous measurements, which is 
based on a mass-per-mass ratio. The following formula converts 
ppmv (parts-per-million-volume) to mg>m3 for a gas at a pressure 
of 1 atm:
mg>m3 = ppmv #
M
(0.08206 # T)
where M is the molar mass of a gas in units of grams per mole, T 
is the temperature in Kelvin, and 0.08206 is the ideal gas 
­constant in units of L # atm>mol # K.

Answers to Conceptual Connections
Boyle’s Law and Charles’s Law
5.1	 (e) The final volume of the gas is the same as the initial volume 
because doubling the pressure decreases the volume by a factor 
of two, but doubling the temperature increases the volume by a 
factor of two. The two changes in volume are equal in magnitude 
but opposite in sign, resulting in a final volume that is equal to 
the initial volume.
Molar Volume
5.2	 (a) Since one gram of H2 contains the greatest number of moles 
(due to H2 having the lowest molar mass of the listed gases), and 
since one mole of any ideal gas occupies the same volume, the H2 
occupies the greatest volume.
Density of a Gas
5.3	 Ne 6 O2 6 F2 6 Cl2
Partial Pressures
5.4	 PHe = 1.5 atm; PNe = 1.5 atm. Since the number of moles of 
each gas is equal, the mole fraction of each gas is 0.50 and the 
partial pressure of each gas is 0.50 * Ptot.
Pressure and Number of Moles
5.5	 (b) Since the total number of gas molecules decreases, the to-
tal pressure—the sum of all the partial pressures—must also de-
crease.
Kinetic Molecular Theory I
5.6	 Although the velocity “tails” have dif-
ferent lengths, the average length of 
the tails on the argon atoms in your 
drawing should be longer than the av-
erage length of the tails on the xenon 
atoms. Because the argon atoms are 
lighter, they must on average move faster than the xenon atoms 
to have the same kinetic energy.
Root Mean Square Velocity
5.7	 (b) The molar mass of neon (20.18 g>mol) is approximately one-
quarter the molar mass of krypton (83.80 g>mol), so the root 
mean square velocity of neon is 3 1
1>4 times that of kypton.
Kinetic Molecular Theory II
5.8	 (c) Since the temperature and the volume are both constant, 
the ideal gas law tells us that the pressure depends solely on the 
number of particles. Sample (c) has the greatest number of par-
ticles per unit volume and therefore has the greatest pressure. 
The pressures of samples (a) and (b) at a given temperature are 
identical. Even though the particles in (b) are more massive than 
those in (a), they have the same average kinetic energy at a given 
temperature. The particles in (b) move more slowly than those in 
(a), and so exert the same pressure as the particles in (a).
Real Gases
5.9	 A 6 B 6 C. Curve A is the lowest temperature curve because it 
deviates the most from ideality. The tendency for the intermo-
lecular forces in carbon dioxide to lower the pressure (relative to 
that of an ideal gas) is greatest at low temperature (because the 
molecules are moving more slowly and are therefore less able to 
overcome the intermolecular forces). As a result, the curve that 
dips the lowest must correspond to the lowest temperature.

Thermochemistry
There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all 
natural phenomena that are known to date. There 
is no known exception to this law—it is exact as 
far as we know. The law is called the conservation 
of energy. It states that there is a certain quantity, 
which we call energy, that does not change in the 
manifold changes which nature undergoes.

e have spent the first few chapters of this book examining one of the two major 
components of our universe—matter. We now turn our attention to the other 
major component—energy. As far as we know, matter and energy—which can 
be interchanged but not destroyed—make up the physical universe. Unlike matter, 
­energy is not something we can touch or hold in our hand, but we experience it in many 
ways. The warmth of sunlight, the feel of wind on our faces, and the force that presses us 
back when a car accelerates are all manifestations of energy and its interconversions. 
And of course energy is critical to society and to the world. The standard of living around 
the globe is strongly correlated with the access to and use of energy resources. Most of 
those resources, as we shall see, are chemical ones, and we can understand their advan-
tages as well as their drawbacks in terms of chemistry.

Chemical Hand Warmers
My family loves to snowboard. However, my wife hates being cold (with a passion), espe-
cially in her hands and toes. Her solution is the chemical hand warmer, a small pouch 
that comes sealed in a plastic package. She opens the package and places the pouch in her 
glove or boot. The pouch slowly warms up and keeps her hand (or foot) warm all day long.
Warming your hands with chemical hand warmers involves many of the principles 
of thermochemistry, the study of the relationships between chemistry and energy. 
When you open the package that contains the hand warmer, the contents are exposed

to air, and an exothermic reaction occurs. Most hand warmers use the oxidation of iron as 
the exothermic reaction:
4 Fe(s) + 3 O2(g) ¡ 2 Fe2O3(s) + heat
The useful product of this reaction is not a substance—it is heat. We’ll define heat 
more carefully later, but heat is what you feel when you touch something that is warmer 
than your hand (in this case, the hand warmer). Although some of the heat is lost 
through the minute openings in your gloves (which is why my wife prefers mittens, 
which have fewer openings), most of it is transferred to your hands and to the pocket of 
air surrounding your hands, resulting in a temperature increase. The magnitude of the 
temperature increase depends on the size of the hand warmer and the size of your glove 
(as well as some other details). But in general, the size of the temperature increase is pro-
portional to the amount of heat released by the reaction.
In this chapter, we examine the relationship between chemical reactions and 
energy. Specifically, we look at how chemical reactions can exchange energy with their 
surroundings and how we can quantify the magnitude of those exchanges. These kinds 
of calculations are important, not only for chemical hand warmers, but also for many 
other important processes such as the production of energy.

The Nature of Energy: Key Definitions
Recall that we briefly examined energy in Section 1.5. We defined energy as the 
capacity to do work and defined work as the result of a force acting through a dis-
tance. When you push a box across the floor, you have done work. Consider another 
example of work: a billiard ball rolling across a billiard table and colliding straight on 
with a second, stationary billiard ball. The rolling ball has energy due to its motion. 
When it collides with another ball it does work, resulting in the transfer of energy from 
one ball to the other. The second billiard ball absorbs the energy and begins to roll 
across the table.
As we just saw with chemical hand warmers, energy can also be transferred through 
heat, the flow of energy caused by a temperature difference. For example, if you hold a 
cup of coffee in your hand, energy is transferred, in the form of heat, from the hot coffee 
to your cooler hand. Think of energy as something that an object or set of objects pos-
sesses. Think of heat and work as ways that objects or sets of objects exchange energy.
Types of Energy
The energy contained in a rolling billiard ball is an example of kinetic energy, the 
energy associated with the motion of an object. The energy contained in a hot cup of 
coffee is thermal energy, the energy associated with the temperature of an object. 
Thermal energy is actually a type of kinetic energy because it arises from the motions 
of atoms or molecules within a substance. If you raise a billiard ball off the table, you 
increase its potential energy, the energy associated with the position or composition 
of an object. The potential energy of the billiard ball, for example, 
is a result of its position in Earth’s ­gravitational field. Raising the 
ball off the table, against Earth’s gravitational pull, gives the ball 
more potential energy. Another example of potential energy is 
the energy contained in a compressed spring. When you compress 
a spring, you push against the forces that tend to maintain the 
spring’s uncompressed shape, storing energy as potential energy. 
Chemical energy, the energy associated with the relative posi-
tions of electrons and nuclei in atoms and molecules, is also a 
form of potential energy. Some chemical compounds, such as the 
methane in natural gas or the iron in a chemical hand warmer, 
are like compressed springs—they contain potential energy, and 
a chemical reaction can release that potential energy. Figure 6.1◀  
summarizes these different kinds of energy.

Energy Conservation and Energy Transfer
The law of conservation of energy states that energy can be neither created nor 
destroyed. However, energy can be transferred from one object to another, and it can 
assume different forms. For example, if you drop a raised billiard ball, some of its 
potential energy becomes kinetic energy as the ball falls toward the table, as shown in 
Figure 6.2▲. If you release a compressed spring, the potential energy becomes kinetic 
energy as the spring expands outward, as shown in Figure 6.3▼. When iron reacts with 
oxygen within a chemical hand warmer, the chemical energy of the iron and oxygen 
becomes thermal energy that increases the temperature of your hand and glove.
A good way to understand and track energy changes is to define the system under 
investigation. For example, the system may be the chemicals in a beaker, or it may be the 
iron reacting in a hand warmer. The system’s surroundings are everything with which 
the system can exchange energy. If we define the chemicals in a beaker as the system, the 
surroundings may include the water in which the chemicals are dissolved (for aqueous 
solutions), the beaker itself, the lab bench on which the beaker sits, 
the air in the room, and so on. For the iron in the hand warmer, the 
surroundings include your hand, your glove, the air in the glove, and 
even the air outside of the glove.
In an energy exchange, energy transfers between the system and 
the surroundings, as shown in Figure 6.4▶ on the next page. If the 
system loses energy, the surroundings gain the same exact amount of 
energy, and vice versa. When the iron within the chemical hand 
warmer reacts, the system loses energy to the surroundings, produc-
ing the desired temperature increase within your gloves.
Units of Energy
We can deduce the units of energy from the definition of kinetic 
energy. An object of mass m, moving at velocity v, has a kinetic 
energy KE given by the equation:

Einstein showed that it is mass–
energy that is conserved; one can 
be converted into the other. This 
equivalence becomes important 
in nuclear reactions, discussed 
in Chapter 20. In ordinary 
chemical reactions, however, the 
interconversion of mass and energy 
is not a significant factor, and we 
can regard mass and energy as 
independently conserved.

The SI unit of mass is the kg and the unit of velocity is m>s. The SI unit of energy is

Joule (1818–1889).

One joule is a relatively small amount of energy—for example, a 100-watt lightbulb 
uses 3.6 * 105 J in 1 hour. Therefore, we often use the kilojoule (kJ) in our energy discus-
sions and calculations (1 kJ = 1000 J). A second commonly used unit of energy is the 
calorie (cal), originally defined as the amount of energy required to raise the tempera-
ture of 1 g of water by 1 °C. The current definition is 1 cal = 4.184 J (exact); a calorie is a 
larger unit than a joule. A related energy unit is the nutritional, or uppercase “C” 
­Calorie (Cal), equivalent to 1000 lowercase “c” calories. The Calorie is the same as a 
kilocalorie (kcal): 1 Cal = 1 kcal = 1000 cal. Electricity bills typically are based on 
another, even larger, energy unit, the kilowatt-hour (kWh): 1 kWh = 3.60 * 106 J. 
Electricity costs $0.08–$0.15 per kWh. Table 6.1 lists various energy units and their con-
version factors. Table 6.2 shows the amount of energy required for various processes.

	 6.3 	 The First Law of Thermodynamics: 
There Is No Free Lunch
Thermodynamics is the general study of energy and its interconversions. The laws of 
thermodynamics are among the most fundamental in all of science, governing virtually 
every process that involves change. The first law of thermodynamics is the law of 
energy conservation, which we state as follows:
The total energy of the universe is constant.
In other words, since energy is neither created nor destroyed, and since the universe 
does not exchange energy with anything else, its energy content does not change.
The first law has many implications: the most important one is that with energy, you 
cannot get something for nothing. The best you can do with energy is break even—there 
is no free lunch. According to the first law, a device that would continually produce 
energy with no energy input, sometimes known as a perpetual motion machine, cannot 
exist. Occasionally, the media report or speculate on the discovery of a machine that can 
produce energy without the need for energy input. For example, you may have heard 
someone propose an electric car that recharges itself while driving, or a new motor that 
can create additional usable electricity as well as the electricity to power itself. Although 
some hybrid (electric and gasoline powered) vehicles can capture energy from braking 
and use that energy to recharge their batteries, they could never run indefinitely without 
additional fuel. As for the motor that powers an external load as well as itself—no such 
thing exists. Our society has a continual need for energy, and as our current energy 
resources dwindle, new energy sources will be required. But those sources, whatever they 
may be, must follow the first law of thermodynamics—energy is always conserved.
Internal Energy
The internal energy (E) of a system is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of all of 
the particles that compose the system. Internal energy is a state function, which means that 
its value depends only on the state of the system, not on how the system arrived at that state. 
Chemistry IN YOUR DAY | Redheffer’s Perpetual Motion Machine
I
n 1812, a man named Charles Redheffer appeared in Philadelphia with a machine that he claimed could run forever with-
out any energy input—a perpetual motion machine. He set up the machine on the edge of town and charged admission to 
view it. He also appealed to the city for money to build a larger version of the machine. When city commissioners came out to 
inspect the machine, Redheffer did his best to keep them from viewing it too closely. Nonetheless, one of the commissioners 
noticed something suspicious: the gears that supposedly ran to an external driveshaft were cut in the wrong direction. The 
driveshaft that the machine was allegedly powering was instead powering the machine. 
The city commissioners hired a local engineer and clockmaker named Isaiah Lukens to 
make a similar machine to expose Redheffer’s deception. Lukens’s machine was even 
more ingenious than Redheffer’s, and Redheffer left Philadelphia exposed as a fraud.
Redheffer was persistent, however, and took his machine to New York. In 1813, dur-
ing a public display of the machine, the famous mechanical engineer Robert Fulton 
(1765–1815)—who had demonstrated the first successful steamboat six years earlier—
noticed a rhythm to the machine’s motion. It seemed to speed up and slow down at reg-
ular intervals. Fulton knew that such rhythmic motion is indicative of motion generated 
by a manual crank. He knocked away some boards in a wall next to the machine and dis-
covered a long belt that led to an enclosed room where, indeed, an old man sat turning a 
crank. Redheffer’s machine—like many other perpetual motion machines throughout 
­history—was again exposed as a hoax.

A State Function
Change in altitude depends only on the diﬀerence between the initial and ﬁnal values,
not on the path taken.
▶ Figure 6.5  Altitude as a 
State Function  The change in 
altitude during a climb depends only 
on the difference between the final 
and initial altitudes, not on the route 
traveled.
The state of a chemical system is specified by parameters such as temperature, pressure, 
concentration, and physical state (solid, liquid, or gas). Consider the mountain-climbing 
analogy depicted in Figure 6.5▲. The elevation at any point during a mountain climb 
is analogous to a state function. For example, when we reach 10,000 ft, our elevation is 
10,000 ft, no matter how we got there. The distance we traveled to get there, by contrast, is 
not a state function; we could have climbed the mountain by any number of routes, each 
requiring us to cover a different distance.
Since state functions depend only on the state of the system, the value of a change in 
a state function is always the difference between its final and initial values. If we start 
climbing a mountain at an elevation of 3000 ft and reach the summit at 10,000 ft, then 
our elevation change is 7000 ft (10,000 ft − 3000 ft), regardless of what path we traveled.
Like an altitude change, an internal energy change (ΔE) is determined by the differ-
ence in internal energy between the final and initial states:
ΔE = Efinal - Einitial
In a chemical system, the reactants constitute the initial state and the products consti-
tute the final state. So ΔE is the difference in internal energy between the products and 
the reactants:
	
ΔE =  Eproducts -  Ereactants
[6.2]
For example, consider the reaction between carbon and oxygen to form carbon 
dioxide:
C(s) + O2(g) ¡ CO2(g)
Just as we can portray the changes that occur when climbing a mountain with an alti-
tude diagram that depicts the altitude before and after the climb (see Figure 6.5), we can 
portray the energy changes that occur during a reaction with an energy diagram, which 
compares the internal energy of the reactants and the products:
C(s), O2(g)
(reactants)
Internal
energy
CO2(g)
(product)
∆E < 0 (negative)
The vertical axis of the diagram is internal energy, which increases as we move up on the 
diagram. For this reaction, the reactants are higher on the diagram than the products 
because they have higher internal energy. As the reaction occurs, the reactants become 
products, which have lower internal energy. Therefore, energy is given off by the reac-
tion and ΔE (that is, Eproducts - Ereactants) is negative.

Where does the energy lost by the reactants (as they transform to products) go? If 
we define the thermodynamic system as the reactants and products of the reaction, then 
energy flows out of the system and into the surroundings.

Now, suppose the reaction is reversed:
CO2(g) ¡ C(s) + O2(g)
The energy-level diagram is nearly identical, with one important difference: 
CO2(g) is now the reactant and C(s) and O2(g) are the products. Instead of 
decreasing in energy as the reaction occurs, the system increases in energy as 
shown at right. In this reversed reaction ΔE is positive and energy flows into 
the system and out of the surroundings:

Summarizing Energy Flow:

If the reactants have a higher internal energy than the products, ΔEsys is negative 
and energy flows out of the system into the surroundings.

energy flows into the system from the surroundings.
We can think of the internal energy of the system in the same way we think about 
the balance in a checking account. Energy flowing out of the system is like a withdrawal 
and therefore carries a negative sign. Energy flowing into the system is like a deposit and 
carries a positive sign.

Heat and Work
As we discussed in Section 6.2, a system can exchange energy with its surroundings 
through heat and work:
Heat (q)
Work (w)
System
Surroundings
According to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in the internal energy of the 
system (ΔE) is the sum of the heat transferred (q) and the work done (w):
	
ΔE = q + w
[6.4]
In Equation 6.4, and from this point forward, we follow the standard convention 
that ΔE (with no subscript) refers to the internal energy change of the system. As shown 
in Table 6.3, energy entering the system through heat or work carries a positive sign, and 
energy leaving the system through heat or work carries a negative sign. Recall our check-
ing account analogy. The system is like the checking account—withdrawals are negative 
and deposits are positive.
Table 6.3  Sign Conventions for q, w, and 𝚫E

+ system gains thermal energy
- system loses thermal energy
w (work)
+ work done on the system
- work done by the system
ΔE (change in internal energy)
+ energy flows into the system
- energy flows out of the system
We can define our system as the previously discussed billiard ball rolling across a 
pool table. The rolling ball has a certain initial amount of kinetic energy. When it 
reaches the other end of the table, the rolling ball collides head-on with a second ball. 
Assume that the first ball loses all of its kinetic energy so that it remains completely still 
(it has no kinetic energy) at the point of collision. The total change in internal energy 
(ΔE) for the first ball is the difference between its initial kinetic energy and its final 
kinetic energy (which is zero); the first billiard ball lost all of its energy. What happened 
to that energy? According to the first law, it must have been transferred to the surround-
ings. In fact, the energy lost by the system must exactly equal the amount gained by the 
surroundings:
∆Esys
−∆Esurr
=
Energy lost
by ﬁrst ball
Energy gained

The surroundings include both the pool table and the second ball. The pool table 
absorbs some of the ball’s kinetic energy as the ball rolls down the table. Minute bumps 
on the table surface cause friction, which slows the ball down by converting kinetic 
energy to heat (q). The second ball absorbs some of the ball’s kinetic energy in the form 
of work (w) upon collision.
Although it is always the case that ΔEsys = -ΔEsurr, the exact amount of work done 
on the second ball depends on the quality of the billiard table. On a smooth, high-­
quality billiard table, the amount of energy lost to friction is relatively small, as illus-
trated in Figure 6.6(a)▶. The speed of the first ball is not reduced by much as it travels 
across the table, and a great deal of its original kinetic energy is available to perform 
work when it collides with the second ball. In contrast, on a rough, poor-quality table, 
the ball loses much of its initial kinetic energy as heat, leaving only a relatively small 
amount available for work, as illustrated in Figure 6.6(b)▶.
Notice that the respective amounts of energy converted to heat and work depend on 
the details of the pool table and the path taken, while the change in internal energy of the 
rolling ball does not. Because internal energy is a state function, the value of ΔE for the 
process in which the ball moves across the table and collides with another ball depends

only on the ball’s initial and final kinetic energy. Work and heat, however, are not state 
functions; therefore, the values of q and w depend on the details of the ball’s journey 
across the table. On the smooth table, w is greater in magnitude than q; on the rough 
table, q is greater in magnitude than w. However, ΔE (the sum of q and w) is constant.

Chapter 6  Thermochemistry
The reason for this one-way transfer 
is related to the second law of 
thermodynamics, which we discuss in 
Chapter 18.
	 6.4 	 Quantifying Heat and Work
In the previous section, we calculated ΔE based on given values of q and w. We now turn 
to calculating q (heat) and w (work) based on changes in temperature and volume.
Heat
Recall from Section 6.2 that heat is the exchange of thermal energy between a system 
and its surroundings caused by a temperature difference. Notice the distinction between 
heat and temperature. Temperature is a measure of the thermal energy within a sample 
of matter. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy. Thermal energy always flows from mat-
ter at higher temperatures to matter at lower-temperatures. For example, a hot cup of 
coffee transfers thermal energy—as heat—to the lower-temperature surroundings as it 
cools down. Imagine a world where the cooler surroundings actually got colder as they 
transferred thermal energy to the hot coffee, which got hotter. Such a world exists only 
in our imaginations (or in the minds of science fiction writers), because the spontane-
ous transfer of heat from a hotter object to a colder one is a fundamental principle of our 
universe—no exception has ever been observed. The thermal energy in the molecules 
that compose the hot coffee distributes itself to the molecules in the surroundings. The 
heat transfer from the coffee to the surroundings stops when the two reach the same 
temperature, a condition called thermal equilibrium. At thermal equilibrium, there 
is no additional net transfer of heat.
Temperature Changes and Heat Capacity
When a system absorbs heat (q), its temperature changes by ΔT:
Heat (q)
∆T
System
Experiments show that the heat absorbed by a system and its corresponding tem-
perature change are directly proportional: q ∝ΔT. The constant of proportionality 
A potato cannon provides a good example of the heat and work associated with a 
chemical reaction. In a potato cannon, a potato is stuffed into a long cylinder that 
is capped on one end and open at the other. Some kind of fuel is introduced 
under the potato at the capped end—usually through a small hole—and ignited. 
The potato shoots out of the cannon, sometimes flying hundreds of feet, and the 
cannon emits heat to the surroundings. If the burning of the fuel performs 855 J 
of work on the potato and produces 1422 J of heat, what is ΔE for the burning of 
the fuel? (Note: A potato cannon can be dangerous and should not be constructed 
without proper training and experience.)
SOLUTION  To solve the problem, substitute the 
­values of q and w into the equation for ΔE. Since 
work is done by the system on the surroundings, 
w is negative. Similarly, because heat is released by 
the system to the surroundings, q is also negative.
 ΔE =
  q + w
 = -1422 J - 855 J
 = -2277 J
For Practice 6.1  A cylinder and piston assembly (defined as the system) is 
warmed by an external flame. The contents of the cylinder expand, doing work 
on the surroundings by pushing the piston outward against the external pressure. 
If the system absorbs 559 J of heat and does 488 J of work during the expansion, 
what is the value of ΔE ?

between q and ΔT is the system’s heat capacity (C), a measure of the system’s ability to 
absorb thermal energy without undergoing a large change in temperature.
	
Heat capacity
q = C × ∆T

[6.5]
Notice that the higher the heat capacity of a system, the smaller the change in tem-
perature for a given amount of absorbed heat. We define the heat capacity (C) of a 
system as the quantity of heat required to change its temperature by 1 °C. As we can 
see by solving Equation 6.5 for heat capacity, the units of heat capacity are those of 
heat (typically J) divided by those of temperature (typically °C):
C =
q

In order to understand two important concepts related to heat capacity, imagine 
putting a steel saucepan on a kitchen flame. The saucepan’s temperature rises rapidly 
as it absorbs heat from the flame. However, if you add some water to the saucepan, the 
temperature rises more slowly. Why? The first reason is that when you add the water, 
the same amount of heat must now warm more matter, so the temperature rises more 
slowly. In other words, heat capacity is an extensive property—it depends on the amount 
of matter being heated (see Section 1.6). The second (and more fundamental) reason is 
that water is more resistant to temperature change than steel—water has an intrinsically 
higher capacity to absorb heat without undergoing a large temperature change. The 
measure of the intrinsic capacity of a substance to absorb heat is its specific heat 
capacity (Cs), the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the 
substance by 1 °C. The units of specific heat capacity (also called specific heat) are 
J>g # °C. Table 6.4 lists the values of the specific heat capacity for several substances. 
Heat capacity is sometimes reported as molar heat capacity, the amount of heat 
required to raise the temperature of 1 mole of a substance by 1 °C. The units of molar heat 
capacity are J>mol # °C. We can see from these definitions that specific heat capacity and 
molar heat capacity are intensive properties—they depend on the kind of substance 
being heated, not on the amount.
Notice that water has the highest specific heat capacity of all the substances in Table 
6.4—changing the temperature of water requires a lot of heat. If you have ever experi-
enced the drop in temperature that occurs when traveling from an inland region to the 
coast during the summer, you have experienced the effects of water’s high specific heat 
capacity. On a summer’s day in California, for example, the temperature difference 
between Sacramento (an inland city) and San Francisco (a coastal city) may be as large as 
18 °C (30 °F)—San Francisco enjoys a cool 20 °C (68 °F), while Sacramento bakes at nearly 
38 °C (100 °F). Yet the intensity of sunlight falling on these two cities is the same. Why 
the large temperature difference? San Francisco sits on a peninsula, surrounded by the 
water of the Pacific Ocean. Water, with its high heat capacity, absorbs much of the sun’s 
heat without undergoing a large increase in temperature, keeping San Francisco cool. 
Sacramento, by contrast, is about 160 km (100 mi) inland. The land surrounding Sacra-
mento, with its low heat capacity, undergoes a large increase in temperature as it absorbs 
a similar amount of heat.
Similarly, only two U.S. states have never recorded a temperature above 100 °F. One of 
them is obvious: Alaska. It is too far north to get that hot. The other one, however, may 
come as a surprise. It is Hawaii. The high heat capacity of the water that surrounds the 
only island state moderates the temperature, preventing Hawaii from ever getting too hot.
We can use the specific heat capacity of a substance to quantify the relationship 
between the amount of heat added to a given amount of the substance and the corre-
sponding temperature increase. The following equation relates these quantities:

The Heat Capacity of Water  Suppose you are cold-weather camping and 
decide to heat some objects to bring into your sleeping bag for added warmth. You place 
a large water jug and a rock of equal mass near the fire. Over time, both the rock and the 
water jug warm to about 38 °C (100 °F). If you could bring only one into your sleeping 
bag, which one should you choose to keep you the warmer? Why?
where q is the amount of heat in J, m is the mass of the substance in g, Cs is the specific 
heat capacity in J>g # °C, and ΔT is the temperature change in °C. Example 6.2 demon-
strates the use of this equation.
ΔT in °C is equal to ΔT in K, but not 
equal to ΔT in °F (Section 1.6).
Example 6.2	
Temperature Changes and Heat Capacity
Suppose you find a penny (minted before 1982, when pennies were almost entirely copper) in the snow. How much heat 
is absorbed by the penny as it warms from the temperature of the snow, which is -8.0 °C, to the temperature of your 
body, 37.0 °C? Assume the penny is pure copper and has a mass of 3.10 g.
SORT  You are given the mass of copper as well as its initial 
and final temperature. You are asked to find the heat re-
quired for the given temperature change.

measure its heat capacity. She first weighs the rock and finds it has a mass of 4.7 g. She then finds that upon absorption 
of 57.2 J of heat, the temperature of the rock rises from 25 °C to 57 °C. Find the specific heat capacity of the substance 
composing the rock and determine whether the value is consistent with the rock being pure gold.

6.4   Quantifying Heat and Work

Thermal Energy Transfer
As we noted earlier, when two substances of different temperature are combined, ther-
mal energy flows as heat from the hotter substance to the cooler one. If we assume that 
the two substances are thermally isolated from everything else, then the heat lost by one 
substance exactly equals the heat gained by the other (according to the law of energy 
conservation). If we define one substance as the system and the other as the surround-
ings, we can quantify the heat exchange as:
qsys = -qsurr
Suppose a block of metal initially at 55 °C is submerged into water initially at 25 °C. 
Thermal energy transfers as heat from the metal to the water:
qmetal = −qwater
The metal becomes colder and the water becomes warmer until the two substances reach 
the same temperature (thermal equilibrium). The exact temperature change that occurs 
depends on the masses of the metal and the water and on their specific heat capacities. 
Since q = m * Cs * ΔT, we can arrive at the following relationship:
 qmetal = -qwater
 mmetal * Cs, metal * ΔTmetal = -mwater * Cs, water * ΔTwater
Example 6.3 shows how to work with thermal energy transfer.
Example 6.3	
Thermal Energy Transfer
A 32.5 g cube of aluminum initially at 45.8 °C is submerged into 105.3 g of water at 15.4 °C. What is the final temperature 
of both substances at thermal equilibrium? (Assume that the aluminum and the water are thermally isolated from 
everything else.)
SORT  You are given the masses of aluminum and water 
and their initial temperatures. You are asked to find the 
final temperature.
GIVEN:  mAl = 32.5 g mH2O = 105.3 g
Ti, Al = 45.8 °C;  Ti, H2O = 15.4 °C
FIND:  Tf
STRATEGIZE  The heat lost by the aluminum (qAl) equals 
the heat gained by the water (qH2O).
Use the relationship between q and ΔT and the given 
­variables to find a relationship between ΔTAl  and ΔTH2O.
Use the relationship between ΔTAl  and ΔTH2O  (that you 
just found) along with the initial temperatures of the 
aluminum and the water to determine the final tempera-
ture. Note that at thermal equilibrium, the final tempera-
ture of the aluminum and the water is the same, that is, 
Tf, Al = Tf, H2O = Tf.

SOLVE 
Write the equation for the relationship between the heat 
lost by the aluminum (qAl) and the heat gained by the 
­water qAI = -qH2O and substitute q = m * Cs * ΔT for 
each substance.
Substitute the values of m (given) and Cs (from Table 6.4) 
for each substance and solve the equation for ΔTAl.  (Alter-
natively, you can solve the equation for ΔTH2O.)  
Substitute the initial temperatures of aluminum and water 
into the relationship from the previous step and solve the 
expression for the final temperature (Tf).  Remember that 
the final temperature for both substances will be the same.

 = 17.3 °C
CHECK  The units °C are correct. The final temperature of the mixture is closer to the initial temperature of the water than 
the aluminum. This makes sense for two reasons: (1) water has a higher specific heat capacity than aluminum, and (2) 
there is more water than aluminum. Because the aluminum loses the same amount of heat that is gained by the water, the 
greater mass and specific heat capacity of the water make the temperature change in the water less than the temperature 
change in the aluminum.
For Practice 6.3  A block of copper of unknown mass has an initial temperature of 65.4 °C. The copper is immersed 
in a beaker containing 95.7 g of water at 22.7 °C. When the two substances reach thermal equilibrium, the final 
temperature is 24.2 °C. What is the mass of the copper block?

temperature of the two substances once thermal equilibrium is reached?
(a)	 The final temperature is closer to the initial temperature of substance A than it 
is to the initial temperature of substance B.
(b)	 The final temperature is closer to the initial temperature of substance B than it is 
to the initial temperature of substance A.
(c)	 The final temperature is exactly midway between the initial temperatures of 
substances A and B.
Work: Pressure–Volume Work
We have seen that energy transfer between a system and its surroundings can occur via 
heat (q) or work (w). We just calculated the heat associated with an observed tempera-
ture change. We now turn to calculating the work associated with an observed volume 
change. Although a chemical reaction can do several different types of work, for now 
we limit our discussion to pressure–volume work. We have already defined work as a 
force acting through a distance. Pressure–volume work occurs when the force is caused 
by a volume change against an external pressure. For example, pressure–volume work 
occurs in the cylinder of an automobile engine. The combustion of gasoline causes gases

constant force.
▲ The combustion of gasoline within

in the motion of the car.
within the cylinders to expand, pushing the piston outward and ultimately moving the 
wheels of the car.
We can derive an equation for the value of pressure–volume work from the defini-
tion of work as a force (F) acting through a distance (D):
	
w = F * D
[6.7]
When the volume of a cylinder increases (Figure 6.7▼), it pushes against an external 
force. That external force is the external pressure (Pext), which is defined as force (F) 
divided by area (A):
Pext = F
A  or  F = Pext * A
If we substitute this expression for force into the definition of work given in Equation 6.7, 
we arrive at the expression:
 w = F * D
 = Pext * A * D
The distance through which the force acts is the change in the height of the piston as it 
moves during the expansion (Δh). Substituting Δh for D, we get:
w = Pext * A * Δh
The volume of a cylinder is the area of its base times its height, so A * Δh is actually 
the change in volume (ΔV) that occurs during the expansion. Thus, the expression for 
work becomes the product of the pressure times the change in volume:
w = Pext ΔV
Still missing from the equation is the sign of the work done by the expanding gases. 
As the volume of the cylinder increases, work is done on the surroundings by the system, 
so w should be negative. However, upon expansion, V2 (the final volume) is greater than 
V1 (the initial volume) so ΔV is positive. In order for w to be negative for a positive 
expansion, we need to add a negative sign to our equation. In other words, w and ΔV 
must be opposite in sign:
	
w = -Pext ΔV

[6.8]
So the work caused by an expansion of volume is the negative of the pressure that 
the volume expands against multiplied by the change in volume that occurs during the 
expansion. The units of the work obtained by using this equation are those of pressure 
(usually atm) multiplied by those of volume (usually L). To convert between L # atm and 
J, we use the conversion factor 101.3 J = 1 L # atm.

balloon.

ings via heat and pressure–volume work:
Heat (q) = m × Cs × ∆T
Work (w) = −Pext ∆V
System
Surroundings
Recall from Section 6.3 that the change in internal energy that occurs during a chemi-
cal reaction (ΔE) is a measure of all of the energy (heat and work) exchanged with the 
surroundings (ΔE = q + w). Therefore, we can measure the changes in temperature (to 

	
6.5  Measuring ΔE for Chemical Reactions: Constant-Volume Calorimetry

calculate heat) and the changes in volume (to calculate 
work) that occur during a chemical reaction, and then 
sum them together to calculate ΔE. However, an easier 
way to obtain the value of ΔE for a chemical reaction is to 
force all of the energy change associated with a reaction 
to manifest itself as heat rather than work. We can then 
measure the temperature change caused by the heat flow.
Recall that ΔE = q + w and that w = -Pext ΔV.  If a 
reaction is carried out at constant volume, then ΔV = 0 
and w = 0. The heat evolved (or given off), called the heat 
at constant volume (qv), is then equal to ΔErxn:

at constant volume
∆Erxn = qv + w
∆Erxn = qv

[6.9]
We can measure the heat evolved in a chemical reac-
tion using calorimetry. In ­calorimetry, we measure the 
thermal energy exchanged between the reaction (defined 
as the system) and the surroundings by observing the 
change in temperature of the surroundings:
Heat

Surroundings
The heat capacity of the calorimeter, 
Ccal, has units of energy over 
temperature; its value accounts for 
all of the heat absorbed by all of the 
components within the calorimeter 
(including the water).
The magnitude of the temperature change in the sur-
roundings depends on the magnitude of ΔE for the reac-
tion and on the heat capacity of the surroundings.
Figure 6.8▶ shows a bomb calorimeter, a piece of 
equipment that measures ΔE for combustion reactions. In 
a bomb calorimeter, the reaction occurs in a sealed con-
tainer called a bomb, which ensures that the reaction occurs at constant volume. To use a 
bomb calorimeter, we put the sample to be burned (of known mass) into a cup equipped 
with an ignition wire. We then seal the cup into the bomb, which is filled with oxygen 
gas, and place the bomb in a water-filled, insulated container. The container is equipped 
with a stirrer and a thermometer. Finally, we ignite the sample with a wire coil and mon-
itor the ­temperature with the thermometer. The temperature change (ΔT) is related to 
the heat absorbed by the entire calorimeter assembly (qcal) by the equation:
	
qcal = Ccal * ΔT

[6.10]
where Ccal is the heat capacity of the entire calorimeter assembly (which is usually deter-
mined in a separate measurement involving the burning of a substance that gives off a 
known amount of heat). If no heat escapes from the calorimeter, the amount of heat 
gained by the calorimeter exactly equals that released by the reaction (the two are equal in 
magnitude but opposite in sign):
	
qcal = -qrxn
[6.11]
Since the reaction occurs under conditions of constant volume, qrxn = qv = ΔErxn. 
This measured quantity is the change in the internal energy of the reaction for the spe-
cific amount of reactant burned. To get ΔErxn per mole of a particular reactant—a more 
general quantity—we divide by the number of moles that actually reacted, as demon-
strated in Example 6.5.

Enthalpy: The Heat Evolved in a Chemical 
Reaction at Constant Pressure
We have just seen that when a chemical reaction occurs in a sealed container under 
conditions of constant volume, the energy evolves only as heat. However, when a 
chemical reaction occurs open to the atmosphere under conditions of constant pres-
sure—such as a reaction occurring in an open beaker or the burning of natural gas on 
a stove—the energy can evolve as both heat and work. As we have also seen, ΔErxn is a 
measure of the total energy change (both heat and work) that occurs during the reaction. 
However, in many cases, we are interested only in the heat exchanged, not the work 
done. For example, when we burn natural gas on a stove to cook food, we do not really 
care how much work the combustion reaction does on the atmosphere by expanding 
against it—we just want to know how much heat is given off to cook the food. Under 
conditions of constant pressure, a thermodynamic quantity called enthalpy represents 
exactly this.
We define the enthalpy (H) of a system as the sum of its internal energy and the 
product of its pressure and volume:
	
H = E + PV
[6.12]
Since internal energy, pressure, and volume are all state functions, enthalpy is also a 
state function. The change in enthalpy (ΔH) for any process occurring under constant 
pressure is given by the expression:
	
ΔH = ΔE + P ΔV
[6.13]
To better understand this expression, we can interpret the two terms on the right 
with the help of relationships already familiar to us. We saw previously that ΔE = q + w. 
If we represent the heat at constant pressure as qp, then the change in internal energy at 
constant pressure is ΔE = qp + w. In addition, from our definition of pressure–volume 
work, we know that Pext ΔV = -w.  Substituting these expressions into the expression 
for ΔH gives us the following expression:
 ΔH = ΔE + P ΔV
 = (qp + w) + P ΔV
 = qp + w - w
	
ΔH = qp

[6.14]
We can see that ΔH is equal to qp, the heat at constant pressure.
Conceptually (and often numerically), ΔH and ΔE are similar: they both represent 
changes in a state function for the system. However, ΔE is a measure of all of the energy 
(heat and work) exchanged with the surroundings, while ΔH is a measure of only the 
heat exchanged under conditions of constant pressure. For chemical ­reactions that do 
not exchange much work with the surroundings—that is, those that do not cause a large 
change in reaction volume as they occur—ΔH and ΔE are nearly identical in value. For 
chemical reactions that produce or consume large amounts of gas, and therefore result 
in large volume changes, ΔH and ΔE may differ slightly in value.

one mole of butane?
The signs of ΔH and ΔE follow the same conventions. A positive ΔH indicates 
that heat flows into the system as the reaction occurs. A chemical reaction with a 
­positive ΔH, called an endothermic reaction, absorbs heat from its surroundings.

The reaction that occurs in a chemical cold pack, often used to ice athletic injuries, is 
a good example of an endothermic reaction. When you break the barrier separating 
the reactants in a chemical cold pack, the substances mix, react, and absorb heat from 
the surroundings. The surroundings—including, say, your bruised wrist—get colder 
because they lose energy as the cold pack absorbs it.
A chemical reaction with a negative ΔH, called an exothermic reaction, gives off 
heat to its surroundings. The reaction that occurs in the chemical hand warmer dis-
cussed in Section 6.1 is a good example of an exothermic reaction. When the reaction 
takes place, heat is given off into the surroundings (including your hand and glove), 
making them warmer. The burning of natural gas is another exothermic reaction. As the 
gas burns, it gives off energy, raising the temperature of its surroundings.
Summarizing Enthalpy:

Identify each process as endothermic or exothermic and indicate the sign of ΔH.
(a)	 sweat evaporating from skin	
(b)	 water freezing in a freezer	
(c)	 wood burning in a fire
Solution
(a)	 Sweat evaporating from skin cools the skin and is therefore endothermic, 
with a positive ΔH. The skin must supply heat to the perspiration in order for 
it to continue to evaporate.
(b)	 Water freezing in a freezer releases heat and is therefore exothermic, with a 
negative ΔH. The refrigeration system in the freezer must remove this heat for 
the water to continue to freeze.
(c)	 Wood burning in a fire releases heat and is therefore exothermic, with a 
negative ΔH.

Exothermic and Endothermic Processes:  
A Molecular View
When a chemical system undergoes a change in enthalpy, where does the energy come 
from or go to? For example, we just saw that an exothermic chemical reaction gives off 
thermal energy—what is the source of that energy?
First, we know that the emitted thermal energy does not come from the original 
thermal energy of the system. Recall from Section 6.2 that the thermal energy of a sys-
tem is the total kinetic energy of the atoms and molecules that compose the system. This 
kinetic energy cannot be the source of the energy given off in an exothermic reaction 
because if the atoms and molecules that compose the system were to lose kinetic energy, 
their temperature would necessarily fall—the system would get colder. Yet we know that 
in exothermic reactions, the temperature of the system and the surroundings rises. So 
there must be some other source of energy.
Recall also from Section 6.2 that the internal energy of a chemical system is the sum 
of its kinetic energy and its potential energy. This potential energy is the source in an exo-
thermic chemical reaction. Under normal circumstances, chemical potential energy (or 
simply chemical energy) arises primarily from the electrostatic forces between the pro-
tons and electrons that compose the atoms and molecules within the system. In an exo-
thermic reaction, some bonds break and new ones form, and the nuclei and electrons 
reorganize into an arrangement with lower potential energy. As the molecules rearrange, 
their potential energy converts into thermal energy, the heat emitted in the reaction. 
Note that breaking bonds always absorbs energy. In an exothermic reaction, weak bonds 
break and stronger bonds form. It only takes a small amount of energy to break the weak 
bonds and a greater amount is given off when the stronger bonds form, resulting in net 
energy production. In an endothermic reaction, the opposite happens: strong bonds 
break and weak ones form. The nuclei and electrons reorganize into an arrangement 
with higher potential energy, absorbing thermal energy in the process.

absorbs heat, then why does it feel cold to the touch?
Stoichiometry Involving 𝚫H: Thermochemical Equations
The enthalpy change for a chemical reaction, abbreviated ΔHrxn, is also called the 
enthalpy of reaction or heat of reaction and depends on the amount of mate-
rial undergoing the reaction. In other words, the amount of heat generated or absorbed 
when a chemical reaction occurs depends on the amounts of reactants that actually 
react. We usually specify ΔHrxn in combination with the balanced chemical equation 
for the reaction. The magnitude of ΔHrxn reflects the stoichiometric amounts of reactants 
and products for the reaction as written. For example, consider the balanced equation and 
ΔHrxn for the combustion of propane, the main component of LP gas:
C3H8(g) + 5 O2(g) ¡ 3 CO2(g) + 4 H2O(g) ΔHrxn = -2044 kJ
The equation tells us that when 1 mol of C3H8 reacts with 5 mol of O2 to form 3 mol 
of CO2 and 4 mol of H2O, 2044 kJ of heat is emitted. We can write these relationships in 
the same way that we expressed stoichiometric relationships in Chapter 4, as ratios 
between two quantities. For example, for the reactants, we write the following ratios:
1 mol C3H8 : -2044 kJ  or  5 mol O2 : -2044 kJ
The ratios indicate that 2044 kJ of heat evolves when 1 mol of C3H8 and 5 mol of O2 com-
pletely react. We can use these ratios to construct conversion factors between amounts of 
reactants or products and the quantity of heat emitted (for exothermic reactions) or

bustion of a certain mass in grams of C3H8, we work with the following conceptual plan:

We use the molar mass to convert between grams and moles, and the stoichiometric 
relationship between moles of C3H8 and the heat of reaction to convert between moles 
and kilojoules, as demonstrated in Example 6.7.

For many aqueous reactions, we can measure ΔHrxn fairly simply using a coffee-cup 
­calorimeter shown in Figure 6.9▶. The calorimeter consists of two Styrofoam coffee 
cups, one inserted into the other, to provide insulation from the laboratory environment.

In an experiment to determine the enthalpy change for this reaction, 0.158 g of Mg metal is combined with enough 
HCl to make 100.0 mL of solution in a coffee-cup calorimeter. The HCl is sufficiently concentrated so that the Mg com-
pletely reacts. The temperature of the solution rises from 25.6 °C to 32.8 °C as a result of the reaction. Find ΔHrxn for the 
reaction as written. Use 1.00 g>mL as the density of the solution and Cs, soln = 4.18 J>g # °C as the specific heat capacity

quantities, together with the equation q = m * Cs * ΔT, 
to find qsoln.
In the second part, use qsoln to get qrxn (which simply 
involves changing the sign). Because the pressure is 
constant, qrxn is equivalent to ΔHrxn for the amount of 
magnesium that reacts.

The calorimeter is equipped with a thermometer and a stirrer. The reaction occurs in 
a specifically measured quantity of solution within the calorimeter, so that the mass 
of the solution is known. During the reaction, the heat evolved (or absorbed) causes 
a temperature change in the solution, which the thermometer measures. If we know 
the specific heat capacity of the solution, normally assumed to be that of water, we 
can calculate qsoln, the heat absorbed by or lost from the solution (which is acting as 
the surroundings) using the equation:
qsoln =  msoln * Cs, soln * ΔT
The insulated calorimeter prevents heat from escaping, so we assume that the 
heat gained by the solution equals that lost by the reaction (or vice versa):
qrxn = -qsoln
Because the reaction happens under conditions of constant pressure (open to 
the atmosphere), qrxn = qp = ΔHrxn. This measured quantity is the heat of reaction 
for the specific amount (which is measured ahead of time) of reactants that react. To 
find ΔHrxn per mole of a particular reactant—a more general quantity—we divide by 
the number of moles that actually reacted, as demonstrated in Example 6.8.

	 6.8 	 Relationships Involving 𝚫Hrxn
The change in enthalpy for a reaction is always associated with a particular reaction. If 
we change the reaction in well-defined ways, then ΔHrxn also changes in well-defined 
ways. We now turn our attention to three quantitative relationships between a chemical 
equation and ΔHrxn.

	
6.8  Relationships Involving ΔHrxn	
273
1.	 If a chemical equation is multiplied by some factor, then 𝚫Hrxn is also 
multiplied by the same factor.
Recall from Section 6.6 that ΔHrxn is an extensive property; it depends on the quantity of 
reactants undergoing reaction. Recall also that ΔHrxn is usually reported for a reaction 
involving stoichiometric amounts of reactants. For example, for a reaction  A + 2 B ¡ C, 
ΔHrxn is typically reported as the amount of heat emitted or absorbed when 1 mol A reacts 
with 2 mol B to form 1 mol C. Therefore, if a chemical equation is multiplied by a factor, 
then ΔHrxn is also multiplied by the same factor. For example,
 A + 2 B ¡ C   ΔH1
 2 A + 4 B ¡ 2 C   ΔH2 = 2 * ΔH1
2.	 If a chemical equation is reversed, then 𝚫Hrxn changes sign.
Recall from Section 6.6 that ΔHrxn is a state function, which means that its value depends 
only on the initial and final states of the system.
ΔH =  Hfinal - Hinitial
When a reaction is reversed, the final state becomes the initial state and vice versa. 
­Consequently, ΔHrxn changes sign:
A + 2 B ¡ C   ΔH1
C ¡ A + 2 B   ΔH2 = -ΔH1
3.	 If a chemical equation can be expressed as the sum of a series of steps, 
then 𝚫Hrxn for the overall equation is the sum of the heats of reaction 
for each step.
This last relationship, known as Hess’s law, also follows from the enthalpy 
of reaction being a state function. Since ΔHrxn is dependent only on the 
initial and final states, and not on the pathway the reaction follows, ΔH 
obtained from summing the individual steps that lead to an overall reac-
tion must be the same as ΔH for that overall reaction. For example,
 A + 2 B ¡ C  
 ΔH1
 C ¡ 2 D   ΔH2
 A + 2 B ¡ 2 D   ΔH3 = ΔH1 + ΔH2
We illustrate Hess’s law with the energy-level diagram in Figure 6.10▶.
These three quantitative relationships make it possible to determine 
ΔH for a reaction without directly measuring it in the laboratory. (For 
some reactions, direct measurement can be difficult.) If we can find 
related reactions (with known ΔH’s) that sum to the reaction of interest, 
we can find ΔH for the reaction of interest. For example, the following 
reaction between C(s) and H2O(g) is an industrially important method 
of generating hydrogen gas:
C(s) + H2O(g) ¡ CO(g) + H2(g)  ΔHrxn = ?
We can find ΔHrxn from the following reactions that have known ΔH’s:
C(s) + O2(g) ¡ CO2(g)  
 ΔH = -393.5 kJ
2 CO(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 CO2(g)  ΔH = -566.0 kJ
2 H2(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 H2O(g)  ΔH = -483.6 kJ
We just have to determine how to sum these reactions to get the overall reaction of 
interest. We do this by manipulating the reactions with known ΔH’s in such a way as to 
get the reactants of interest on the left, the products of interest on the right, and other 
species to cancel.

Chapter 6  Thermochemistry
Since the first reaction has C(s) as a reactant, and the 
reaction of interest also has C(s) as a reactant, we write the 
first reaction unchanged.
C(s) + O2(g) ¡ CO2(g) ΔH = -393.5 kJ
The second reaction has 2 mol of CO(g) as a reactant. 
However, the reaction of interest has 1 mol of CO(g) as a 
product. Therefore, we reverse the second reaction, change 
the sign of ΔH, and multiply the reaction and ΔH by 12.
12 * [2 CO2(g) ¡ 2 CO(g) + O2(g)]  ΔH = 12 * (+566.0 kJ)
In the third reaction H2(g)  is a reactant. In the reaction of 
interest, however, H2(g)  is a product. Therefore, we reverse the 
equation and change the sign of ΔH.  In addition, to obtain 
coefficients that match the reaction of interest, and to cancel 
O2, we must multiply the reaction and  ΔH by  12 . 
12 * [2 H2O(g) ¡ 2 H2(g) + O2(g)]   ΔH = 12 * (+483.6 kJ) 
Lastly, we rewrite the three reactions after multiplying 
through by the indicated factors and show how they sum to 
the reaction of interest.  ΔH for the reaction of interest is 
the sum of the ΔH’s  for the steps.
 C(s) + O2(g) ¡ CO2(g)  
 ΔH = -393.5 kJ
 CO2(g) ¡ CO(g) + 12 O2(g)  ΔH = +283.0 kJ

C(s) + O2(g) ¡ CO2(g)
   ΔH = -393.5 kJ
2 H2(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 H2O(g)
   ΔH = -483.6 kJ
Solution
To work this and other Hess’s law problems, manipulate the reactions with known ΔH’s in such a way as to get the 
­reactants of interest on the left, the products of interest on the right, and other species to cancel.
The first reaction has C3H8 as a reactant, and the reac-
tion of interest has C3H8 as a product, so reverse the 
first reaction and change the sign of ΔH.
3 CO2(g) + 4 H2O(g) ¡ C3H8(g) + 5 O2(g) ΔH = +2043 kJ
The second reaction has C as a reactant and CO2 as 
a product, just as required in the reaction of interest. 
However, the coefficient for C is 1, and in the reac-
tion of interest, the coefficient for C is 3. You need to 
multiply this equation and its ΔH by 3.
3 * [C(s) + O2(g) ¡ CO2(g)] ΔH = 3 * (-393.5 kJ)
The third reaction has H2(g) as a reactant, as required. 
However, the coefficient for H2 is 2, and in the reac-
tion of interest, the coefficient for H2 is 4. Multiply 
this reaction and its ΔH by 2.
2 * [2 H2(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 H2O(g)] ΔH = 2 * (-483.6 kJ)
Rewrite the three reactions after multiplying through 
by the indicated factors and show how they sum to 
the reaction of interest. ΔH for the reaction of inter-
est is the sum of the ΔH’s for the steps.
 3 CO2(g) + 4 H2O(g) ¡ C3H8(g) + 5 O2(g)   ΔH = +2043 kJ

Determining Enthalpies of Reaction 
from Standard Enthalpies of Formation
We have examined two ways to determine ΔH for a chemical reaction: experimentally 
through calorimetry and inferentially through Hess’s law. We now turn to a third and 
more convenient way to determine ΔH for a large number of chemical reactions: from 
tabulated standard enthalpies of formation.
Standard States and Standard Enthalpy Changes
Recall that ΔH is the change in enthalpy for a chemical reaction—the difference in 
enthalpy between the products and the reactants. Because we are interested in changes 
in enthalpy (and not in absolute values of enthalpy itself), we are free to define the zero 
of enthalpy as conveniently as possible. Returning to our mountain-climbing analogy, 
a change in altitude (like a change in enthalpy) is an absolute quantity. Altitude itself 
(like enthalpy), however, is a relative quantity, defined relative to some standard (such as 
sea level in the case of altitude). We define a similar, albeit slightly more complex, stan-
dard for enthalpy. This standard has three parts: the standard state, the standard 
enthalpy change (𝚫H °), and the standard enthalpy of formation (𝚫H °f ).
1.	 Standard State
• For a Gas:  The standard state for a gas is the pure gas at a pressure of exactly 1 atm.
• For a Liquid or Solid:  The standard state for a liquid or solid is the pure substance 
in its most stable form at a pressure of 1 atm and at the temperature of interest 
(often taken to be 25 °C).
• For a Substance in Solution:  The standard state for a substance in solution is a 
concentration of exactly 1 M.
2.	 Standard Enthalpy Change (𝚫H °)
• The change in enthalpy for a process when all reactants and products are in their 
standard states. The degree sign indicates standard states.
3.	 Standard Enthalpy of Formation (𝚫H °f )
• For a Pure Compound:  The change in enthalpy when 1 mol of the compound 
forms from its constituent elements in their standard states.
• For a Pure Element in Its Standard State:   ΔH °f = 0.
The standard enthalpy of formation is also called the standard heat of formation.
Assigning the value of zero to the standard enthalpy of formation for an element in 
its standard state is the equivalent of assigning an altitude of zero to sea level. Once we 
assume sea level is zero, we can then measure all subsequent changes in altitude relative 
to sea level. Similarly, we can measure all changes in enthalpy relative to those of pure 
elements in their standard states. For example, consider the standard enthalpy of forma-
tion of methane gas at 25 °C:
C(s, graphite) +  2 H2(g) ¡ CH4(g)  ΔH °f = -74.6 kJ>mol
For methane, as with most compounds, ΔH °f is negative. Continuing our analogy, if we 
think of pure elements in their standard states as being at sea level, then most compounds 
lie below sea level. The chemical equation for the enthalpy of formation of a compound is 
always written to form 1 mol of the compound, so ΔH °f has the units of kJ>mol. Table 6.5 
lists ΔH °f values for some selected compounds. A more complete list is in Appendix IIB.
The standard state was changed in 
1997 to a pressure of 1 bar, which is 
very close to 1 atm (1 atm = 1.013 
bar). Both standards are now in 
common use.
The carbon in this equation must be 
graphite (the most stable form of 
carbon at 1 atm and 25 °C).

6.9  Determining Enthalpies of Reaction from Standard Enthalpies of Formation	
277
Calculating the Standard Enthalpy Change  
for a Reaction
We have just seen that the standard enthalpy of formation corresponds to the formation 
of a compound from its constituent elements in their standard states:
elements ¡ compound   ΔH °f
Therefore, the negative of the standard enthalpy of formation corresponds to the decom-
position of a compound into its constituent elements in their standard states:
compound ¡ elements   -ΔH °f
We can use these two concepts—the decomposition of a compound into its ele-
ments and the formation of a compound from its elements—to calculate the enthalpy 
change of any reaction by mentally taking the reactants through two steps. In the 
first step we decompose the reactants into their constituent elements in their standard 
states; in the second step we form the products from the constituent elements in their 
standard states:
 reactants ¡ elements    ΔH1 = -ΣΔH °f  (reactants)
 elements ¡ products     ΔH2 = +ΣΔH °f  (products) 
 reactants ¡ products    ΔH °rxn = ΔH1 + ΔH2
In these equations, Σ means “the sum of” so that ΔH1 is the sum of the negatives of the 
heats of formation of the reactants and ΔH2 is the sum of the heats of formation of the 
products.
We can demonstrate this procedure by calculating the standard enthalpy change 
(ΔH °rxn) for the combustion of methane:
CH4(g) +  2 O2(g) ¡ CO2(g) +  2 H2O(g)   ΔH °rxn = ?
The energy changes associated with the decomposition of the reactants and the forma-
tion of the products are shown in Figure 6.11▼. The first step (1) is the decomposition of 
1 mol of methane into its constituent elements in their standard states. We can obtain 
the change in enthalpy for this step by reversing the enthalpy of formation equation for 
methane and changing the sign of ΔH °f :
(1) CH4(g) ¡ C(s, graphite) +  2 H2(g)  -ΔH °f = +74.6 kJ>mol
The second step, the formation of the products from their constituent elements, 
has two parts: (a) the formation of 1 mol CO2 and (b) the formation of 2 mol H2O. 
Because part (b) forms 2 mol H2O, we multiply the ΔH °f for that step by 2:
(2a) C(s, graphite) + O2(g) ¡ CO2(g)   ΔH °f = -393.5 kJ>mol
C(s, graphite) + 2 H2(g) + 2 O2(g)

Chapter 6  Thermochemistry
As we know from Hess’s law, the enthalpy of reaction for the overall reaction is the 
sum of the enthalpies of reaction of the individual steps:
(1) CH4(g) ¡ C(s, graphite) + 2 H2(g) 
 -ΔH °f = +74.6 kJ>mol
(2a) C(s, graphite) + O2(g) ¡ CO2(g) 
 ΔH °f = -393.5 kJ>mol
(2b) 2 H2(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 H2O(g) 
 2 * ΔH °f = -483.6 kJ>mol
CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) ¡ CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)   ΔH °rxn = -802.5 kJ>mol 
We can streamline and generalize this process as follows:
To calculate 𝚫H°rxn, subtract the enthalpies of formation of the 
reactants multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients from 
the enthalpies of formation of the products multiplied by their 
­stoichiometric coefficients.
In the form of an equation:
	
ΔH °rxn = a npΔH °f  (products) - a nrΔH °f  (reactants) 
[6.15]
In this equation, np represents the stoichiometric coefficients of the products, nr 
represents the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants, and ΔH °f represents the stan-
dard enthalpies of formation. Keep in mind when using this equation that elements in 
their standard states have ΔH °f = 0. Examples 6.11 and 6.12 demonstrate this process.
Example 6.11	  𝚫H°rxn and Standard Enthalpies of Formation
Use the standard enthalpies of formation to determine ΔH °rxn for the reaction:
4 NH3(g) + 5 O2(g) ¡ 4 NO(g) + 6 H2O(g)

and asked to find the enthalpy of reaction.
GIVEN:  4 NH3(g) + 5 O2(g) ¡ 4 NO(g) + 6 H2O(g)

STRATEGIZE  To calculate ΔH °rxn from stan-

by their stoichiometric coefficients from the 
heats of formation of the products multiplied 
by their stoichiometric coefficients.
CONCEPTUAL PLAN 
ΔH °rxn = Σnp ΔH °f  (products) - ΣnrΔH °f  (reactants)
SOLVE  Begin by looking up (in Appendix IIB) 
the standard enthalpy of formation for each 
reactant and product. Remember that the 
standard enthalpy of formation of pure ele-
ments in their standard state is zero.

oxide, is highly exothermic.
2 Al(s) + Fe2O3(s) ¡  Al2O3(s) + 2 Fe(s)
Use standard enthalpies of formation to determine ΔH °rxn for the thermite reaction.
▶ The reaction of powdered aluminum with 
iron oxide, known as the thermite reaction, 
releases a large amount of heat.
Example 6.12	
𝚫H°rxn and Standard Enthalpies of Formation
A city of 100,000 people uses approximately 1.0 * 1011 kJ of energy per day. Suppose all of that energy comes from the 
combustion of liquid octane (C8H18) to form gaseous water and gaseous carbon dioxide. Use standard enthalpies of 
formation to calculate ΔH °rxn for the combustion of octane and then determine the number of kilograms of octane 
necessary to provide this amount of energy.
SORT  You are given the amount of energy 
used and asked to find the mass of octane 
required to produce the energy.

	 6.10 	 Energy Use and the Environment
In this chapter, we explored the relationship between chemical reactions and energy 
changes. As noted earlier, our society derives the majority of its energy from the energy 
changes associated with burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuels have traditionally been regarded 
as convenient sources of energy due to their abundance and portability and because 
they undergo combustion reactions that have large negative enthalpies of reaction (the 
reactions are highly exothermic). However, the burning of fossil fuels also has some seri-
ous environmental impacts.
Energy Consumption
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the United States currently consumes close 
to 100 quads (1 quad = 1 quadrillion British thermal units = 1.06 * 1018 J) of energy 
per year in the categories shown in this chart.
This corresponds to over 100,000 kWh of energy use per 
person per year. If we used physical laborers to do the equiva-
lent amount of work, each person would need about 120 peo-
ple. In other words, the average American employs the work 
output of 120 people, day and night, all year long! For this rea-
son, Americans enjoy one of the highest standards of living in 
the world. However, our consumption of energy has significant 
environmental consequences.
Most U.S. energy comes from the combustion of fossil fuels, as shown in Figure 6.12▶. 
Fossil fuels include petroleum, natural gas, and coal, all of which have been considered con-
venient fuels because they are relatively abundant in Earth’s crust (and therefore relatively 
inexpensive), they are easily transportable, and their combustion is highly exothermic.

Environmental Problems Associated with Fossil Fuel Use
One of the main problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels is that even though 
they are abundant in Earth’s crust, fossil fules are also finite. Fossil fuels originate from 
ancient plant and animal life and are a nonrenewable energy source—once they are all 
burned, they cannot be replenished. At current rates of consumption, oil and natural gas 
supplies will be depleted in 50 to 100 years. Although there is enough coal to last much 
longer, it is a dirtier fuel (it produces more pollution) and, because it is a solid, is less con-
venient (more difficult to transport and use) than petroleum and natural gas.
The other major problems associated with fossil fuel use stem from the products of 
combustion. The chemical equations we show in this section of the chapter for fossil fuel 
combustion all produce carbon dioxide and water. However, these equations represent 
the reactions under ideal conditions and do not account for impurities in the fuel, side 
reactions, and incomplete combustion. When these are taken into account, we can iden-
tify three major environmental problems associated with the emissions of fossil fuel 
combustion: air pollution, acid rain, and global climate change. We discussed acid rain in 
Chapter 3 (see Chemistry in the Environment: Acid Rain in Section 3.6). Here we  address air 
pollution and global climate change, which we first touched on in Section 4.1.
Air Pollution
The air in all major cities in the world is polluted. Pollution comes from a number of 
sources, including electricity generation, motor vehicle emissions, and industrial waste. 
There are many different kinds of air pollutants.

Sulfur Oxides (SOx)
Sulfur oxides include SO2 and SO3, produced primarily during coal-fired electricity gen-
eration and industrial metal refining. The sulfur oxides are lung and eye irritants that 
affect the respiratory system and are the main precursors of acid rain (see Section 3.6).
Carbon Monoxide (CO)
Carbon monoxide forms during the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels (petroleum, 
natural gas, and coal). It is emitted mainly by motor vehicles. In humans and other ani-
mals, carbon monoxide displaces oxygen in the blood, forcing the heart and lungs to 
work harder. At high levels, CO can cause sensory impairment, decreased thinking abil-
ity, unconsciousness, and even death.
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)
The nitrogen oxides include NO and NO2, emitted by motor vehicles, fossil fuel–based 
electricity generation plants, and any high-temperature combustion process occurring 
in air. Nitrogen dioxide is an orange-brown gas that causes the dark haze over polluted 
cities. Nitrogen oxides are eye and lung irritants and precursors of acid rain.
Ozone (O3)
Ozone is produced when some of the products of fossil fuel combustion, especially nitro-
gen oxides and unburned volatile organic compounds (VOCs), react in the presence of 
sunlight. The products of this reaction, which include ozone, are called photochemical 
smog. Ozone produced in this way—sometimes called ground-level ozone—should not 
be confused with upper atmospheric or stratospheric ozone. Although ozone is always the 
same molecule (O3), stratospheric ozone is a natural part of our environment that pro-
tects Earth from harmful ultraviolet light. Stratospheric ozone does not harm humans 
because we are not directly exposed to it. Ground-level ozone, on the other hand, is a 
pollutant to which we are directly exposed; it is an eye and lung irritant, and prolonged 
exposure can cause permanent lung damage.
In the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has estab-
lished limits on these pollutants. Beginning in the 1970s, the U.S. Congress passed the 
Clean Air Act and its amendments, requiring U.S. cities to reduce their pollution and 
maintain levels below the standards set by the EPA. As a result of this legislation, pollut-
ant levels in U.S. cities have decreased over the last 30 years, even as the number of vehi-
cles has increased. According to the EPA, the levels of the major pollutants in the air of 
U.S. cities decreased significantly during the period 1980–2013, as shown in Table 6.6.
Although the levels of pollutants (especially ozone) in 
some cities are still above what the EPA considers safe, real 
progress has been made. These trends demonstrate that 
legislation can improve our environment.
Global Climate Change
One of the main products of fossil fuel combustion is car-
bon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas; it allows 
visible light from the sun to enter Earth’s atmosphere but 
prevents heat (in the form of infrared light) from escap-
ing. In doing so, carbon dioxide acts as a blanket, keeping 
Earth warm, which, in moderation, is a very good thing 
and allows life as we know it to exist on our planet. How-
ever, because of fossil fuel combustion, carbon dioxide 
levels in the atmosphere have been steadily increasing, 
as shown in Figure 6.13◀. This increase is expected to 
change the global climate and further raise Earth’s aver-
age temperature. Current observations suggest that Earth 
has already warmed by about 0.7 °C in the last century due 
to an approximately 38% increase in atmospheric carbon

dioxide. Computer models suggest that the warming could worsen if carbon dioxide 
emissions are not curbed. The possible effects of this warming include heightened storm 
severity, increasing numbers of floods and droughts, major shifts in agricultural zones, 
rising sea levels and coastal flooding, and profound changes in habitats that could result 
in the extinction of some plant and animal species.
Example 6.13	
Fossil Fuels and Climate Change
One way to evaluate fuels with respect to global warming is to determine how much heat they release during 
combustion relative to how much CO2 they produce. The greater the heat relative to the amount of CO2, the better the 
fuel. Use the combustion reactions of carbon, natural gas, and octane, in combination with the enthalpy of combustion 
for each reaction (all given earlier), to calculate the heat (in kJ) released by each fuel per 1.00 kg of CO2 produced.
SORT  You are given the mass of CO2 emitted and asked to find 
the energy output for three different fuels.
GIVEN:  1.00 kg CO2
FIND:  kJ
STRATEGIZE  First write the thermochemical equations for 
the combustion of each fuel given in Section 6.10.
C(s) + O2(g) ¡ CO2(g)

C8H18(l) + 25>2 O2(g) ¡ 8 CO2(g) + 9 H2O(g)
ΔH °rxn = -5074.1 kJ
The conceptual plan has two parts. In the first part, use the 
molar mass of CO2 to convert from mass of CO2 to moles of 
CO2. This step is the same for each fuel.
In the second part, use the stoichiometric relationship 
between moles of CO2 produced and kilojoules of energy 
released to calculate the energy output. Repeat the second part 
for each fuel using the appropriate stoichiometric relationship 
from the balanced equations.

OTHER RELATIONSHIPS USED 
1 kg = 1000 g
molar mass CO2 = 44.01 g>mol
SOLVE  Begin by converting kg CO2 to mol CO2.
Then, for each fuel, convert mol CO2 to kJ.
As you can see from the heat released in the production of 1 kg 
CO2, natural gas, CH4, provides the most energy per kg CO2; 
therefore, it is the best fuel with respect to climate change.

Chemistry in the Environment | Renewable Energy
B
ecause of their finite supply and environmental impacts, 
fossil fuels will not be our major source of energy in the 
future. What will replace them? Although the answer is not 
clear, several alternative energy technologies are beginning 
to emerge. Unlike fossil fuels, these technologies are renew-
able, and we can use them indefinitely.
Our planet’s greatest source of renewable energy is the 
sun. If we could capture and harness just a small fraction of 
the total sunlight falling on Earth, we could meet our energy 
needs several times over. The main problem with solar ener-
gy, however, is diffuseness—the sun’s energy falls over an 
enormous area. How do we concentrate and store it? In Cali-
fornia, some of the state’s electricity is generated by parabol-
ic troughs, solar power towers, and dish>engines.
These devices use reflective surfaces to focus the sun’s 
energy and produce enough heat to generate electricity. Al-
though the direct cost of generating electricity this way is high-
er than using fossil fuels, the benefits to the environment are 
obvious. In addition, with time, the costs are expected to fall.
Another way to capture the sun’s energy is in chemical 
bonds. For example, solar energy could be used to drive the 
decomposition of water:
h2O(l) ¡ h2(g) + 12 O2(g) ΔH °rxn = +285.8 kJ
The hydrogen gas produced could be stored until needed to 
provide energy by re-forming water in the reverse reaction:
h2(g) + 12 O2(g) ¡ h2O(l) ΔH °rxn = -285.8 kJ
This reaction can be carried out in an electrochemical 
­device called a fuel cell. In a fuel cell, hydrogen and oxygen 
gases combine to form water and produce electricity. In 
2015, Toyota introduced the Mirai (which means future in 
Japanese), the first mass-produced fuel cell vehicle. The 
Mirai has a 300-mile range and produces 153 horsepower. 
Unlike most electric vehicles (such as the Tesla Model S),  
a fuel cell vehicle can be refueled instead of recharged.  
The ­refueling process 
only takes a few min-
utes (compared to re-
charging, which can 
take several hours). 
California has ear-
marked $200 million 
to build a “hydrogen 
highway,” a series of 
100 hydrogen refuel-
ing stations to be operational by 2020.
Other renewable energy sources are hydroelectric power 
and wind power. Hydroelectric power plants—which generate 
approximately 7% of U.S. electricity—harness the gravitation-
al potential energy of water held behind a dam. Water is re-
leased at a controlled rate. As the released water falls, it 
acquires kinetic energy that is used to spin turbines, generat-
ing electricity. Wind power plants—which produce nearly 5% 
of U.S. electricity—consist of hundreds of turbines that are 
spun by the wind to generate electricity. Both of these tech-
nologies are cost competitive with fossil fuels, have no emis-
sions, and are 
completely renewable.
Our energy future 
will probably involve a 
combination of these 
technologies and 
some new ones, com-
bined with a focus on 
greater efficiency and 
conservation. One 
thing, however, is 
clear—the future of 
fossil fuels is limited.

Key Concepts
The Nature of Energy and Thermodynamics  
(6.2, 6.3)
▶
▶Energy, which is measured in the SI unit of joules (J), is the capac-
ity to do work.
▶
▶Work is the result of a force acting through a distance.
▶
▶Many different kinds of energy exist, including kinetic energy, 
thermal energy, potential energy, and chemical energy, a type 
of potential energy associated with the relative positions of elec-
trons and nuclei in atoms and molecules.
▶
▶The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be con-
verted from one form to another, but the total amount of energy 
is always conserved.
▶
▶The internal energy (E) of a system is the sum of all of its kinetic 
and potential energy. Internal energy is a state function, which 
means that it depends only on the state of the system and not on 
the pathway by which it got to that state.
▶
▶A chemical system exchanges energy with its surroundings 
through heat (the transfer of thermal energy caused by a tempera-
ture difference) or work. The total change in internal energy is the 
sum of these two quantities.
Heat and Work (6.4)
▶
▶We quantify heat with the equation q = m * Cs * ΔT. In this 
expression, Cs is the specific heat capacity, the amount of heat re-
quired to change the temperature of 1 g of the substance by 1 °C. 
Compared to most substances, water has a very high heat capacity—
it takes a lot of heat to change its temperature.
▶
▶The type of work most characteristic of chemical reactions is pres-
sure–volume work, which occurs when a gas expands against an 
external pressure. Pressure–volume work can be quantified with 
the equation w = -PextΔV.
▶
▶The change in internal energy (ΔE) that occurs during a chemical 
reaction is the sum of the heat (q) exchanged and the work (w) 
done: ΔE = q + w.
Enthalpy (6.6)
▶
▶The heat evolved in a chemical reaction occurring at constant 
pressure is the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for the reaction. Like in-
ternal energy, enthalpy is a state function.
▶
▶An endothermic reaction has a positive enthalpy of reaction; an 
exothermic reaction has a negative enthalpy of reaction.
▶
▶We can use the enthalpy of reaction to stoichiometrically deter-
mine the heat evolved when a specific amount of reactant reacts.
Calorimetry (6.5, 6.7)
▶
▶Calorimetry is a method of measuring ΔE or ΔH for a reaction.
▶
▶In bomb calorimetry, the reaction is carried out under condi-
tions of constant volume, so ΔE = qv. We can therefore use the 
temperature change of the calorimeter to calculate ΔE for the 
reaction.
▶
▶When a reaction takes place at constant pressure, energy may be 
released both as heat and as work.
▶
▶In coffee-cup calorimetry, a reaction is carried out under atmo-
spheric pressure in a solution, so q = ΔH. We use the temperature 
change of the solution to calculate ΔH for the reaction.
Calculating 𝚫Hrxn (6.8, 6.9)
▶
▶We can calculate the enthalpy of reaction (ΔHrxn) from known 
thermochemical data using the following relationships: (a) when 
a reaction is multiplied by a factor, ΔHrxn is multiplied by the same 
factor; (b) when a reaction is reversed, ΔHrxn changes sign; and (c) if 
a chemical reaction can be expressed as a sum of two or more steps, 

	
Chapter in Review	
287
ΔHrxn is the sum of the ΔH’s for the individual steps (Hess’s law). We 
can use these relationships to determine the enthalpy change of an 
unknown reaction from reactions with known enthalpy changes.
▶
▶A second method to calculate ΔHrxn from known thermochemi-
cal data involves using tabulated standard enthalpies of formation 
for the reactants and products of the reaction. These are usually 
tabulated for substances in their standard states, and the enthalpy 
of reaction is called the standard enthalpy of reaction (ΔH °rxn). For 
any reaction, we obtain ΔH °rxn by subtracting the sum of the en-
thalpies of formation of the reactants multiplied by their stoichio-
metric coefficients from the sum of the enthalpies of formation of 
the products multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients.
Environmental Problems Associated with Fossil 
Fuel Use (6.10)
▶
▶Fossil fuels are nonrenewable fuels; once humans consume them, 
they cannot be replaced.
▶
▶At current rates of consumption, natural gas and petroleum 
reserves will be depleted in 50–100 years.
▶
▶In addition to their limited supply, the products of the combus-
tion of fossil fuels—directly or indirectly formed—contribute to 
environmental problems including air pollution, acid rain, and 
global climate change, which involves an increase in Earth’s aver-
age temperature caused by CO2 emission.

bon dioxide produces a dense fog often used to create special ef-
fects. In a simple dry ice fog machine, dry ice is added to warm 
water in a Styrofoam cooler. The dry ice produces fog until it 
evaporates away, or until the water gets too cold to sublime the 
dry ice quickly enough. Suppose that a small Styrofoam cooler 
holds 15.0 L of water heated to 85 °C. Use standard enthalpies of

Data Interpretation and Analysis
Heat Content of Fuels
	144.	 To compare the energy content of fuels, we can use the 
quantities known as higher heating value (HHV) and lower heating 
value (LHV). The HHV assumes that the reaction product water 
is formed in the liquid state. The HHV is the same as the change 
in enthalpy of combustion, ΔHcomb. The LHV assumes that 
water is formed in the gas state. The LHV is therefore the sum 
of the HHV (which is negative) and the heat of vaporization of 
water (which is positive).

Answers to Conceptual Connections
System and Surroundings
6.1	 The correct answer is (a). When ΔEsys is negative, energy flows 
out of the system and into the surroundings. The energy in-
crease in the surroundings must exactly match the decrease in 
the system.
Heat and Work
6.2	 (a) heat, sign is positive (b) work, sign is positive (c) heat, sign is 
negative
The Heat Capacity of Water
6.3	 Bring the water into your sleeping bag; it has the higher heat ca-
pacity and will therefore release more heat as it cools.
Thermal Energy Transfer
6.4	 (c) The specific heat capacity of substance B is twice that of A, 
but since the mass of B is half that of A, the quantity m * Cs is 
identical for both substances so that the final temperature is ex-
actly midway between the two initial temperatures.
The Difference between 𝚫H and 𝚫E
6.5	 ΔH 
represents 
only 
the 
heat 
exchanged; 
therefore, 
ΔH = -2658 kJ. ΔE represents the heat and work exchanged; 
therefore, ΔE = -2661 kJ. The signs of both ΔH and ΔE are neg-
ative because heat and work are flowing out of the system and 
into the surroundings. Notice that the values of ΔH and ΔE are 
similar in magnitude, as is the case in many chemical reactions.
Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions
6.6	 An endothermic reaction feels cold to the touch because the 
reaction (acting here as the system) absorbs heat from the sur-
roundings. When you touch the vessel in which the reaction oc-
curs, you, being part of the surroundings, lose heat to the system 
(the reaction), which makes you feel cold. The heat absorbed 
by the reaction (from your body, in this case) does not increase 
its temperature, but rather becomes potential energy stored in 
chemical bonds.
Constant-Pressure versus Constant-Volume Calorimetry
6.7	 The value of qrxn with the greater magnitude (-12.5 kJ) 
must have come from the bomb calorimeter. Recall that 
ΔErxn = qrxn + wrxn. In a bomb calorimeter, the energy change 
that occurs in the course of the reaction all takes the form of heat 
(q). In a coffee-cup calorimeter, the amount of energy released as 
heat may be smaller because some of the energy may be used to 
do work (w).

The Quantum-Mechanical 
Model of the Atom
Anyone who is not shocked by quantum 
mechanics has not understood it.
—Niels Bohr (1885–1962)
296

▲ The thought experiment known 
as Schrödinger’s cat is intended to 
show that the strangeness of the 
quantum world does not transfer to 
the macroscopic world.
T
he early part of the twentieth century brought changes that revolutionized how we 
think about physical reality, especially in the atomic realm. Before then, all descrip-
tions of the behavior of matter had been deterministic—the present conditions 
completely determining the future. The new theory of quantum mechanics suggested 
that for subatomic particles—electrons, neutrons, and protons—the present does NOT 
completely determine the future. For example, if you shoot one electron down a path 
and measure where it lands, a second electron shot down the same path under the same 
conditions will most likely land in a different place! Several unusually gifted scientists, 
including Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Louis de Broglie, Max Planck, Werner Heisenberg, 
P. A. M. Dirac, and Erwin Schrödinger, developed quantum-mechanical theory. These sci-
entists did not necessarily feel comfortable with their own theory. Bohr said, “Anyone 
who is not shocked by quantum mechanics has not understood it.” Schrödinger wrote, “I 
don’t like it, and I’m sorry I ever had anything to do with it.” Albert Einstein disbelieved 
the very theory he helped develop, stating, “God does not play dice with the universe.” 
In fact, Einstein ­attempted to disprove quantum mechanics—without success—until he 
died. Today, quantum mechanics forms the foundation of chemistry—explaining the pe-
riodic table and the behavior of the elements in chemical bonding—as well as providing 
the practical basis for lasers, computers, and countless other applications.

Schrödinger’s Cat

have a mass of less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a gram, a size so small that it is 
297

Chapter 7  The Quantum-Mechanical Model of the Atom
immeasurable. A single speck of dust contains more electrons than the number of 
people who have existed on Earth over all the centuries of time. Electrons are small 
in the absolute sense of the word—they are among the smallest particles that make 
up matter. And yet, as we have seen in the preceding chapters, an atom’s electrons 
determine many of its chemical and physical properties. If we are to understand 
these properties, we must try to understand electrons.
In the early twentieth century, scientists discovered that the absolutely small (or 
quantum) world of the electron behaves differently than the large (or macroscopic) world 
that we are used to observing. Chief among these differences is the idea that, when 
unobserved, absolutely small particles like electrons can be in two different states at the same 
time. For example, through a process called radioactive decay (see Chapter 20) an atom 
can emit small (that is, absolutely small) energetic particles from its nucleus. In the mac-
roscopic world, something either emits an energetic particle or it doesn’t. In the quan-
tum world, however, the unobserved atom can be in a state in which it is doing 
both—emitting the particle and not emitting the particle—simultaneously. At first, this 
seems absurd. The absurdity resolves itself, however, upon observation. When we set out 
to measure the emitted particle, the act of measurement actually forces the atom into 
one state or the other.
Early twentieth-century physicists struggled with this idea. Austrian physicist Erwin 
Schrödinger (1887–1961), in an attempt to demonstrate that this quantum strangeness 
could never transfer itself to the macroscopic world, published a paper in 1935 that con-
tained a thought experiment about a cat, now known as Schrödinger’s cat. In the 
thought experiment, the imaginary cat is put into a steel chamber that contains radioac-
tive atoms such as the atom described in the previous paragraph. The chamber is 
equipped with a mechanism that, upon the emission of an energetic particle by one of 
the radioactive atoms, causes a hammer to break a flask of hydrocyanic acid, a poison. If 
the flask breaks, the poison is released and the cat dies.
Now here comes the absurdity: if the steel chamber is closed, the whole system 
remains unobserved, and the radioactive atom is in a state in which it has both emitted 
the particle and not emitted the particle (with equal probability). Therefore, the cat is 
both dead and undead. Schrödinger put it this way: “[the steel chamber would have] in it 
the living and dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal parts.” When the 
chamber is opened, the act of observation forces the entire system into one state or the 
other: the cat is either dead or alive, not both. However, while unobserved, the cat is 
both dead and alive. The absurdity of the both dead and undead cat in Schrödinger’s 
thought experiment was meant to demonstrate how quantum strangeness does not 
transfer to the macroscopic world.
In this chapter, we examine the quantum-mechanical model of the atom, a 
model that explains the strange behavior of electrons. In particular, we focus on how the 
model describes electrons as they exist within atoms, and how those electrons deter-
mine the chemical and physical properties of elements. You have already learned much 
about those properties. You know, for example, that some elements are metals and that 
others are nonmetals. You know that the noble gases are chemically inert and that the 
alkali metals are chemically reactive. You know that sodium tends to form 1+ ions and 
that fluorine tends to form 1- ions. But we have not explored why. The quantum-
mechanical model explains why. In doing so, it explains the modern periodic table and 
provides the basis for our understanding of chemical bonding.

The Nature of Light
Before we explore electrons and their behavior within the atom, we must under-
stand some of the properties of light. As quantum mechanics developed, light was 
(surprisingly) found to have many characteristics in common with electrons. Chief 
among these is the wave–particle duality of light. Certain properties of light are best 
described by thinking of it as a wave, while other properties are best described by

thinking of it as a particle. In this section, we first explore the wave behavior of light 
and its particle behavior. We then turn to electrons to see how they display the same 
wave–particle duality.
The Wave Nature of Light
Light is electromagnetic radiation, a type of energy embodied in oscillating electric 
and magnetic fields. A magnetic field is a region of space where a magnetic particle expe-
riences a force (think of the space around a magnet). An electric field is a region of space 
where an electrically charged particle experiences a force. A proton, for example, has an 
electric field around it. If you bring another charged particle into that field, that particle 
will experience a force.
We can describe electromagnetic radiation as a wave composed of oscillating, 
mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields propagating through space, as 
shown in Figure 7.1▼. In a vacuum, these waves move at a constant speed of 
3.00 * 108 m>s (186,000 mi>s)—fast enough to circle Earth in one-seventh of a sec-
ond. This great speed is the reason for the delay between the moment when you see a 
firework in the sky and the moment when you hear the sound of its explosion. The 
light from the exploding firework reaches your eye almost instantaneously. The 
sound, traveling much more slowly (340 m>s), takes longer. The same thing happens 
in a thunderstorm—you see the flash of lightning immediately, but the sound of 
thunder takes a few seconds to reach you. (The sound of thunder is delayed by five 
seconds for each mile between you and its origin.)

trough). The amplitude of the electric and magnetic field waves in light determines the 
light’s intensity or brightness—the greater the amplitude, the greater the intensity. The 
wavelength (L) of the wave is the distance between adjacent crests (or any two analogous 
points) and is measured in units such as meters, micrometers, or nanometers. Amplitude 
and wavelength can vary independently of one another, as shown in Figure 7.2▲.
Wavelength (λ)
Amplitude
Like all waves, light is also characterized by its frequency (n), the number of cycles 
(or wave crests) that pass through a stationary point in a given period of time. The units of 
frequency are cycles per second (cycle>s) or simply s - 1. An equivalent unit of frequency is 
the hertz (Hz), defined as 1 cycle>s. The frequency of a wave is directly proportional to the 
speed at which the wave is traveling—the faster the wave, the greater the number of crests 
that pass a fixed location per unit time. Frequency is also inversely proportional to the 
wavelength (l)—the farther apart the crests, the lower the number of crests that pass a 
fixed location per unit time. For light, therefore, we can write the equation:
	
n = c
l
[7.1]
where the speed of light, c, and the wavelength, l, are both expressed in the same unit of 
distance. Wavelength and frequency represent different ways of specifying the same 
information—if we know one, we can readily calculate the other.
For visible light—light that can be seen by the human eye—wavelength (or, alterna-
tively, frequency) determines color. White light, produced by the sun or by a lightbulb, 
contains a spectrum of wavelengths and therefore a spectrum of colors. We see these 
colors—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—in a rainbow or when white 
light passes through a prism (Figure 7.3▶). Red light, with a wavelength of about 750 
nanometers (nm), has the longest wavelength of visible light; violet light, with a wave-
length of about 400 nm, has the shortest. The presence of a variety of wavelengths in 
white light is responsible for the way we perceive colors in objects. When a substance

appears red because it reflects predominantly red light while absorbing most other col-
ors (Figure 7.4▲). Our eyes see only the reflected light, making the shirt appear red.

length. Use Equation 7.1, which 
relates frequency to wavelength. You

Wavelength and Frequency
The Electromagnetic Spectrum
Visible light makes up only a tiny portion of the entire electromagnetic ­spectrum, 
which includes all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. Figure 7.5▶ on the next 
page shows the main regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging in wavelength 
from 10 - 15 m (gamma rays) to 105 m (radio waves). In Figure 7.5, short-wavelength, 
high-frequency radiation is on the right and long-wavelength, low-frequency radiation 
is on the left.
We will see later in this section that short-wavelength light inherently has greater 
energy than long-wavelength light (because of the particle nature of light). The most 
energetic forms of electromagnetic radiation have the shortest wavelengths. The form of 
electromagnetic radiation with the shortest wavelength is the gamma (G) ray. Gamma 
rays are produced by the sun, other stars, and certain unstable atomic nuclei on Earth. 
Excessive exposure to gamma rays is dangerous to humans because the high energy of 
gamma rays can damage biological molecules.
Next on the electromagnetic spectrum, with longer wavelengths than gamma rays, 
are X-rays, familiar to us from their medical use. X-rays pass through many substances 
We will discuss gamma rays in more 
detail in Chapter 20.

that block visible light and are therefore used to image bones and internal organs. Like 
gamma rays, X-rays are sufficiently energetic to damage biological molecules. Although 
several annual medical X-rays are relatively harmless, too much exposure to X-rays 
increases cancer risk.
Sandwiched between X-rays and visible light in the electromagnetic spectrum is 
ultraviolet (UV) radiation, most familiar to us as the component of sunlight that 
produces a sunburn or suntan. Though not as energetic as gamma rays or X-rays, ultra-
violet light still carries enough energy to damage biological molecules. Excessive expo-
sure to ultraviolet light increases the risk of skin cancer and cataracts and causes 
premature wrinkling of the skin.
Next on the spectrum is visible light, ranging from violet (shorter wavelength, 
higher energy) to red (longer wavelength, lower energy). Visible light—at low to moder-
ate intensity—does not carry enough energy to damage biological molecules. It does, 
however, cause certain molecules in our eyes to change their shape, sending a signal to 
our brains that results in our ability to see.
Beyond visible light lies infrared (IR) radiation. The heat you feel when you 
place your hand near a hot object is infrared radiation. All warm objects, including 
human bodies, emit infrared light. Although infrared light is invisible to our eyes, 
infrared sensors can detect it and are often employed in night vision technology to 
help people “see” in the dark.
Beyond infrared light, at longer wavelengths still, are microwaves, used for radar 
and in microwave ovens. Although microwave radiation has longer wavelengths and 
therefore lower energies than visible or infrared light, it is efficiently absorbed by water 
and can therefore heat substances that contain water. The longest wavelengths on the 
electromagnetic spectrum are those of radio waves, which are used to transmit the sig-
nals responsible for AM and FM radio, cellular telephone, television, and other forms of 
communication.

-rays and gamma rays are sometimes called ionizing radiation because their 
short wavelengths correspond to high energies that can ionize atoms and mole-
cules. When ionizing radiation interacts with biological molecules, it can permanently 
change or even destroy them. Consequently, we normally try to limit our exposure to 
ionizing radiation. However, doctors use ionizing radiation to destroy molecules within 
unwanted cells such as cancer cells.
In radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) doctors aim X-ray or gamma-ray 
beams at cancerous tumors (groups of cells that divide uncontrollably and invade sur-
rounding healthy tissue). The ionizing radiation damages the molecules within the tu-
mor’s cells that carry genetic information—information necessary for the cell to grow 
and divide. Consequently, the cell dies or stops dividing. Ionizing radiation also dam-
ages molecules in healthy cells, but cancerous cells divide more quickly than normal 
cells, making them more susceptible to genetic damage. Nonetheless, harm to 
healthy tissues during radiation therapy treatments can result in side effects such as 
fatigue, skin lesions, hair loss, and organ damage. Medical workers try to reduce such 
effects by appropriate shielding (of healthy tissue) and by targeting the tumor from 
multiple directions, minimizing the exposure of healthy cells while maximizing the ex-
posure of cancerous cells.
Another side effect of exposing healthy cells to radiation is that the healthy  
cells may become cancerous. If a treatment for cancer may cause cancer, why 
do we continue to use it? In radiation therapy, as in most other disease thera-
pies, there is an associated risk. We take risks all the time, many of them for 
lesser reasons. For example, every time we fly in an airplane or drive in a car, 
we risk injury or even death. Why? Because we perceive the benefit—the con-
venience of being able to travel a significant distance in a short time—to be 
worth the relatively small risk. The situation is similar in cancer therapy, or any 
other medical therapy for that matter. The benefit of cancer therapy (possibly 
curing a cancer that might otherwise kill you) is worth the risk (a slight in-
crease in the chance of developing a future cancer).

Interference and Diffraction
Waves, including electromagnetic waves, interact with each other in a characteristic way 
called interference: they cancel each other out or build each other up, depending on 
their alignment upon interaction. For example, if two waves of equal amplitude are in 
phase when they interact—that is, they align with overlapping crests—a wave with twice 
the amplitude results. This is called constructive interference.

On the other hand, if two waves are completely out of 
phase when they interact—that is, they align so  
that the crest from one source overlaps with the 
trough from the other source—the waves cancel by 
destructive interference.

small slits, the two resulting waves interfere with each other. Whether the interference is 
constructive or destructive at any given point depends on the difference in the path lengths 
traveled by the waves. The resulting interference pattern appears as a series of bright and dark 
lines on a screen.
Waves also exhibit a characteristic behavior called diffraction (Figure 7.6▲). 
When a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that is comparable in size to its wave-
length, it bends (or diffracts) around it. The diffraction of light through two slits sepa-
rated by a distance comparable to the wavelength of the light, coupled with 
interference, results in an interference pattern, illustrated in Figure 7.7▼. Each slit acts

as a new wave source, and the two new waves interfere with each other. The resulting 
pattern is a series of bright and dark lines that can be viewed on a screen (or recorded 
on a film) placed a short distance behind the slits. At the center of the screen, the two 
waves travel equal distances and interfere constructively to produce a bright line. A 
small distance away from the center in either direction, the two waves travel slightly 
different distances, so they are out of phase. At the point where the difference in dis-
tance is one-half of one wavelength, the interference is destructive and a dark line 
appears on the screen. A bit further away from the center we see constructive interfer-
ence again because the difference between the paths is one whole wavelength. The 
end result is the interference pattern shown by the light and dark bars in Figure 7.7. 
Notice that interference results from the ability of a wave to diffract through two 
slits—an inherent property of waves.
The Particle Nature of Light
Prior to the early 1900s, and especially after the discovery of the diffraction of light, light 
was thought to be purely a wave phenomenon. Its behavior was described adequately 
by classical electromagnetic theory, which treated the electric and magnetic fields that 
constitute light as waves propagating through space. However, a number of discoveries 
brought the classical view into question. Chief among these discoveries was the photo-
electric effect.
The photoelectric effect is the observation that many metals emit electrons 
when light shines upon them, as shown in Figure 7.8▼. Classical electromagnetic the-
ory attributed this effect to the transfer of energy from the light to an electron in the 
metal, which resulted in the dislodgment of the electron. According to this explanation, 
only the amplitude (intensity) of the light affects the emission of electrons, not the 
wavelength. In other words, according to the classical description, the rate at which 
electrons leave the metal due to the photoelectric effect increases with increasing inten-
sity of the light. A dim light was expected to result in a lag time between the initial shin-
ing of the light and the subsequent emission of an electron. The lag time would be the

electromagnetic theory or classical 
mechanics, refers to descriptions of 
matter and energy before the advent 
of quantum mechanics.

Chapter 7  The Quantum-Mechanical Model of the Atom
minimum amount of time required for the dim light to transfer suffi-
cient energy to the electron to dislodge it.
The experimental results, however, did not support the classical 
prediction. Scientists found that a high-frequency, low-intensity light 
produces electrons without the predicted lag time. Furthermore, the 
light used to dislodge electrons in the photoelectric effect exhibits a 
threshold frequency, below which no electrons are emitted from the 
metal, no matter how long the light shines on the metal. Figure 7.9◀ 
is a graph of the rate of electron ejection from the metal versus the 
frequency of light used. Notice that increasing the intensity of the 
light does not change the threshold frequency. In other words, low-
frequency (long-wavelength) light does not eject electrons from a 
metal regardless of its intensity or its duration. But high-frequency 
(short-wavelength) light does eject electrons, even if its intensity is 
low. What could explain this odd behavior?
In 1905, Albert Einstein (1879–1955) proposed a bold explana-
tion for the photoelectric effect: light energy must come in packets. According to Einstein, 
the amount of energy (E) in a light packet depends on its frequency (n) according to the 
following equation:
	
E = hn 
[7.2]
where h, called Planck’s constant, has the value h = 6.626 * 10 - 34 J # s. A packet of light is 
called a photon or a quantum of light. Since n = c>l, the energy of a photon can also 
be expressed in terms of wavelength as follows:
	
E = hc
l 
[7.3]
Unlike classical electromagnetic theory, in which light was viewed purely as a wave 
whose intensity was continuously variable, Einstein suggested that light was lumpy. From 
this perspective, a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but a shower of 
particles (photons), each with energy hn.

Einstein was not the first to suggest 
that energy was quantized. Max 
Planck (1858–1947) used the 
idea in 1900 to account for certain 
characteristics of radiation from hot 
bodies.

particles, and any macroscopic collection must contain a large number of them.

Einstein’s idea that light is quantized elegantly explains the photoelectric effect. 
The emission of electrons from the metal depends on whether or not a single photon 
has sufficient energy (as given by hn) to dislodge a single electron. For an electron bound 
to the metal with binding energy f, the threshold frequency is reached when the energy 
of the photon is equal to f.

Low-frequency light does not eject electrons because no single photon has the mini-
mum energy necessary to dislodge the electron. We can draw an analogy between a pho-
ton ejecting an electron from a metal surface and a ball breaking a glass window. In this 
analogy, low-frequency photons are like ping-pong balls—a ping-pong ball thrown at a 
glass window does not break it (just as a low-frequency photon does not eject an electron). 
Increasing the intensity of low-frequency light is like increasing the number of ping-pong 
The symbol f is the Greek letter phi, 
pronounced “fi.”

Chapter 7  The Quantum-Mechanical Model of the Atom
balls thrown at the window—doing so simply increases the number of low-energy pho-
tons but does not produce any single photon with sufficient energy. In contrast, increas-
ing the frequency of the light, even at low intensity, increases the energy of each photon. In 
our analogy, a high-frequency photon is like a baseball—a baseball thrown at a glass win-
dow breaks it (just as a high-frequency photon dislodges an electron with no lag time).
As the frequency of the light increases past the threshold frequency, the excess 
energy of the photon (beyond what is needed to dislodge the electron) transfers to the 
electron in the form of kinetic energy. The kinetic energy (KE) of the ejected electron, 
therefore, is the difference between the energy of the photon (hv), and the binding 
energy of the electron, as given by the equation:
KE = hv - f
Although the quantization of light explained the photoelectric effect, the wave 
explanation of light continued to have explanatory power as well, depending on the cir-
cumstances of the particular observation. So the principle that slowly emerged (albeit 
with some measure of resistance) is what we now call the wave–particle duality of light. 
Sometimes light appears to behave like a wave, at other times like a particle. Which 
behavior we observe depends on the particular experiment.

Atomic Spectroscopy and the  
Bohr Model
The discovery of the particle nature of light began to break down the division that 
existed in nineteenth-century physics between electromagnetic radiation, which was 
thought of as a wave phenomenon, and the small particles (protons, neutrons, and elec-
trons) that compose atoms, which were thought to follow Newton’s laws of motion. Just 
as the photoelectric effect suggested the particle nature of light, so certain observations 
about atoms began to suggest a wave nature for particles. The most important of these 
observations came from atomic spectroscopy, the study of the electromagnetic radiation 
absorbed and emitted by atoms.
When an atom absorbs energy—in the form of heat, light, or electricity—it often 
reemits that energy as light. For example, a neon sign is composed of one or more 
glass tubes filled with neon gas. When an electric current is passed through the tube, 
the neon atoms absorb some of the electrical energy and reemit it as the familiar red 
light of a neon sign. If the atoms in the tube are different (that is, not neon), they 
emit light of a different color. In other words, atoms of each element emit light of a 
characteristic color. Mercury atoms, for example, emit light that appears blue, 
helium atoms emit light that appears violet, and hydrogen atoms emit light that 
appears ­reddish (Figure 7.10▶).
Remember that the color of visible light is determined by its wavelength. Closer 
inspection of the light emitted by various atoms reveals that it contains several distinct 
wavelengths. We can separate the light emitted by a single element in a glass tube into its 
constituent wavelengths by passing it through a prism (just like we separate the white 
▲ The familiar red light from a neon 
sign is emitted by neon atoms that 
have absorbed electrical energy, 
which the atoms reemit as visible 
radiation.

light from a lightbulb), as shown in Figure 7.11▼. The result is a series of bright lines 
called an emission spectrum. The emission spectrum of a particular element is always 
the same—it consists of the same bright lines at the same characteristic wavelengths. We 
can use the emission spectrum to identify the element. For example, light arriving from 
a distant star contains the emission spectra of the elements that compose the star. Anal-
ysis of the light allows us to identify the elements present in the star.
Notice the differences between a white light spectrum and the emission spectra of 
hydrogen, helium, and barium (shown in Figure 7.11). The white light spectrum is 
­continuous, meaning that there are no sudden interruptions in the intensity of the light as 
a function of wavelength—the spectrum consists of light of all wavelengths. The emission 
spectra of hydrogen, helium, and barium, however, are not continuous—they consist of 
bright lines at specific wavelengths, with complete darkness in between. That is, only cer-
tain discrete wavelengths of light are present. Classical physics could not explain why 
these spectra consisted of discrete lines. In fact, according to classical physics, an atom 
composed of an electron orbiting a nucleus should emit a continuous white light spec-
trum. Even more problematic, the electron should lose energy as it emits the light and 
spirals into the nucleus. According to classical physics, an atom should not even be stable.
Johannes Rydberg (1854–1919), a Swedish mathematician, analyzed many atomic 
spectra and developed an equation that predicts the wavelengths of the hydrogen emis-
sion spectrum. However, his equation (shown in the margin) gives little insight into why 
atomic spectra are discrete, why atoms are stable, or why his equation works.
The Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885–1962) attempted to develop a model for the 
atom that explained atomic spectra. In his model, electrons travel around the nucleus in

from the sun—Bohr’s orbits exist only at specific, fixed 
distances from the nucleus. The energy of each Bohr 
orbit is also fixed, or quantized. Bohr called these orbits 
stationary states and suggested that, although they obey 
the laws of classical mechanics, they also possess “a 
peculiar, mechanically unexplainable, stability.” Scien-
tists now know that the stationary states were really 
manifestations of the wave nature of the electron, 
which we will expand upon shortly. Bohr further pro-
posed that, in contradiction to classical electromag-
netic theory, an electron orbiting the nucleus in a 
stationary state emits no radiation. It is only when an 
electron jumps, or makes a transition, from one station-
ary state to another that radiation is emitted or 
absorbed (Figure 7.12◀).

Chemistry IN YOUR DAY | Atomic Spectroscopy, a Bar Code for Atoms

hen you check out of the grocery store, a laser scanner reads the bar code on the 
items that you buy. Each item has a unique code that identifies the item and its 
price. Similarly, each element in the periodic table has a spectrum unlike that of any other 
element. For example, Figure 7.13▼ shows the emission spectra of oxygen and neon. (In 
Figure 7.11, we saw the emission spectra of hydrogen, helium, and barium.) Notice that 
each spectrum is unique and, as such, can be used to identify the substance.
The presence of intense lines in the spectra of a number of metals is the basis for flame 
tests, simple tests used to identify elements in ionic compounds in the absence of a precise 
analysis of a compound’s spectrum. For example, the emission spectrum of sodium features 
two closely spaced, bright yellow lines. When a crystal of a sodium salt (or a drop of a solution 
containing a sodium salt) is put into a flame, the flame glows bright yellow (Figure 7.14▶). As 
Figure 7.14 shows, other metals exhibit similarly characteristic colors in flame tests. Each col-
or represents an especially bright spectral emission line (or a combination of two or more 
such lines). Similar emissions form the basis of the colors seen in fireworks.
Although the emission of light from elements is easier to detect, the absorption of light by 
elements is even more commonly used for purposes of identification. Whereas emission 
spectra consist of bright lines on a dark background, absorption spectra consist of dark lines 
on a bright background (Figure 7.15▶). An absorption spectrum is measured by passing 
white light through a sample and observing what wavelengths are missing due to absorption 
by the sample. Notice that, in the spectrum of mercury shown in Figure 7.15, the absorption 
lines are at the same wavelengths as the emission lines. This is because the processes that produce them are 
mirror images. In emission, an electron makes a transition from a higher-energy level to a lower-energy one. In 
absorption, the transition is between the same two energy levels, but from the lower level to the higher one.
▲ Fireworks typically contain the 
salts of such metals as sodium, 
calcium, strontium, barium, and 
copper. Emissions from these 
elements produce the brilliant 
colors of pyrotechnic displays.

The transitions between stationary states in a hydrogen atom are quite unlike 
transitions in the macroscopic world. The electron is never observed between states; it 
is observed only in one state or another. The emission spectrum of an atom consists 
of discrete lines because the stationary states exist only at specific, fixed energies. The 
energy of the photon emitted when an electron makes a transition from one station-
ary state to another is the energy difference between the two stationary states. Transi-
tions between stationary states that are closer together, therefore, produce light of 
lower energy (longer wavelength) than transitions between stationary states that are 
­farther apart.

The Wave Nature of Matter: The  
de Broglie Wavelength, the Uncertainty 
Principle, and Indeterminacy
The heart of quantum-mechanical theory is the wave nature of the electron, first pro-
posed by Louis de Broglie (1892–1987) in 1924 and confirmed by experiments in 1927. 
It seemed incredible at the time, but electrons—which were then thought of only 
as particles and known to have mass—also have a wave nature. The wave nature of 
The Davisson–Germer experiment 
of 1927 provided the first evidence 
of electron wave properties. In this 
experiment, electrons were observed 
to undergo diffraction by a metal 
crystal.
Absorption spectrometers, found in most chemistry laboratories, typically plot the intensi-
ty of absorption as a function of wavelength. Such plots are useful both for identifying sub-
stances (qualitative analysis) and for determining the concentration of substances (quantita-
tive analysis). Quantitative analysis is possible because the amount of light absorbed by a 
sample depends on the concentration of the absorbing substance within the sample. For 
­example, we can determine the concentration of Ca2 + in a hard water sample by measuring 
the quantity of light absorbed by the calcium ion at its characteristic wavelength.
In spite of its initial success in explaining the line spectrum of hydrogen, the Bohr model 
left many unanswered questions. It did, however, serve as an intermediate model between a 
classical view of the electron and a fully quantum-mechanical view, and therefore has great 
historical and conceptual importance. Nonetheless, it was ultimately replaced by a more com-
plete quantum-mechanical theory that fully incorporated the wave nature of the electron.

Chapter 7  The Quantum-Mechanical Model of the Atom
the electron is seen most clearly in its diffraction. If an electron beam is aimed at two 
closely spaced slits, and a series (or array) of detectors is arranged to detect the elec-
trons after they pass through the slits, an interference pattern similar to that observed 
for light (see Figure 7.6) is recorded behind the slits (Figure 7.16(a)▼). The detectors at 
the center of the array (midway between the two slits) detect a large number of elec-
trons—exactly the opposite of what you would expect for particles (Figure 7.16(b)▼). 
Moving outward from this center spot, the detectors alternately detect small numbers 
of electrons and then large numbers again and so on, forming an interference pattern 
characteristic of waves.
Counter to what might be our initial intuition about electron interference, the 
interference pattern is not caused by pairs of electrons interfering with each other, but rather 
by single electrons interfering with themselves. If the electron source is turned down to a 
very low level, so that electrons come out only one at a time, the interference pattern 
remains. In other words, we can design an experiment in which electrons come out of 
the source singly. We can then record where each electron strikes the detector after it has 
For interference to occur, the spacing 
of the slits has to be on the order of 
atomic dimensions.

waves produce the brightest strip directly in the center of the screen.

passed through the slits. If we record the positions of thousands of electrons over a long 
period of time, we find the same interference pattern shown in Figure 7.16(a).
This observation leads us to an important conclusion: the wave nature of the electron is 
an inherent property of individual electrons. Recall from Section 7.1 that unobserved electrons 
can simultaneously occupy two different states. In this case, the unobserved electron goes 
through both slits—it exists in two states simultaneously, just like Schrödinger’s cat—and 
interferes with itself. This wave nature explains the existence of stationary states (in the 
Bohr model) and prevents the electrons in an atom from crashing into the nucleus as pre-
dicted by classical physics. We now turn to three important manifestations of the electron’s 
wave nature: the de Broglie wavelength, the uncertainty principle, and indeterminacy.
The de Broglie Wavelength
As we have seen, a single electron traveling through space has a wave nature; its wave-
length is related to its kinetic energy (the energy associated with its motion). The faster 
the electron is moving, the higher its kinetic energy and the shorter its wavelength. The 
wavelength (l) of an electron of mass m moving at velocity v is given by the de Broglie 
relation:
	
l =
h
mv de Broglie relation 
[7.4]
where h is Planck’s constant. Notice that the velocity of a moving electron is related to its 
wavelength—knowing one is equivalent to knowing the other.
The mass of an object (m) times 
its velocity (v) is its momentum. 
Therefore, the wavelength of an 
electron is inversely proportional to 
its momentum.
Calculate the wavelength of an electron traveling with a speed of 2.65 * 106 m>s.

chemical bond is 1.2 * 10 - 10 m.

The de Broglie Wavelength of Macroscopic Objects  Since 
quantum-mechanical theory is universal, it applies to all objects, regardless of size. 
Therefore, according to the de Broglie relation, a thrown baseball should also exhibit 
wave properties. Why don’t we observe such properties at the ballpark?
The Uncertainty Principle
The wave nature of the electron is difficult to reconcile with its particle nature. How can 
a single entity behave as both a wave and a particle? We can begin to address this ques-
tion by returning to the single-electron diffraction experiment. How does a single electron 
aimed at a double slit produce an interference pattern? We saw previously that the electron 
travels through both slits and interferes with itself. This idea is testable. We simply have to 
observe the single electron as it travels through both of the slits. If it travels through both 
slits simultaneously, our hypothesis is correct. But here is where nature gets tricky.
Any experiment designed to observe the electron as it travels through the slits 
results in the detection of an electron “particle” traveling through a single slit and no 
interference pattern. Recall from Section 7.1 that an unobserved electron can occupy two 
different states; however, the act of observation forces it into one state or the other. Simi-
larly, the act of observing the electron as it travels through both slits forces it to go 
through only one slit. The electron diffraction experiment illustrated here is designed to 
observe which slit the electron travels through by using a laser beam placed directly 
behind the slits:
An electron that crosses the laser beam produces a tiny “flash” when a single pho-
ton is scattered at the point of crossing. If a flash shows up behind a particular slit, that 
indicates an electron is passing through that slit. When the experiment is performed, 
the flash always originates either from one slit or the other, but never from both at once. 
Furthermore, the interference pattern, which was present without the laser, is absent 
when the electrons are observed going through the slits. With the laser on, the electrons 
hit positions directly behind each slit, as if they were ordinary particles; their wavelike 
behavior is no longer manifested.

315
As it turns out, no matter how hard we try or whatever method we set up, we can 
never both see the interference pattern and simultaneously determine which hole the electron 
goes through. It has never been done, and most scientists agree that it never will. In the 
words of theoretical physicist P. A. M. Dirac (1902–1984),
There is a limit to the fineness of our powers of observation and the smallness of the 
­accompanying disturbance—a limit which is inherent in the nature of things and can never 
be surpassed by improved technique or increased skill on the part of the observer.
The single electron diffraction experiment demonstrates that we cannot simultane-
ously observe both the wave nature and the particle nature of the electron. When we try 
to observe which hole the electron goes through (associated with the particle nature of 
the electron), we lose the interference pattern (associated with the wave nature of the 
electron). When we try to observe the interference pattern, we cannot determine which 
hole the electron goes through. The wave nature and particle nature of the electron are 
said to be complementary properties. Complementary properties exclude one 
another—the more we know about one, the less we know about the other. Which of two 
complementary properties we observe depends on the experiment we perform—in 
quantum mechanics, the observation of an event affects its outcome.
As we just saw in the de Broglie relation, the velocity of an electron is related to its 
wave nature. The position of an electron, however, is related to its particle nature. (Particles 
have well-defined position, but waves do not.) Consequently, our inability to observe 
the electron simultaneously as both a particle and a wave means that we cannot simulta-
neously measure its position and its velocity. Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976) formalized 
this idea with the equation:
	
∆x * m∆v Ú
h
4p Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
[7.5]
where ∆x is the uncertainty in the position, ∆v is the uncertainty in the velocity, m is 
the mass of the particle, and h is Planck’s constant. Heisenberg’s uncertainty 
­principle states that the product of ∆x and m∆v must be greater than or equal to a 
finite number (h>4p). In other words, the more accurately we know the position of an 
electron (the smaller ∆x), the less accurately we can know its velocity (the bigger ∆v) and 
vice versa. The complementarity of the wave nature and particle nature of the electron 
results in the complementarity of velocity and position.
Although Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle may seem puzzling, it actually solves a 
great puzzle. Without the uncertainty principle, we are left with a paradox: how can 
something be both a particle and a wave? Saying that an object is both a particle and a 
wave is like saying that an object is both a circle and a square, a contradiction. Heisen-
berg solved the contradiction by introducing complementarity—an electron is observed 
as either a particle or a wave, but never both at once. This idea was captured by Schröding-
er’s thought experiment about the cat, which we discussed in Section 7.1: when 
observed, the cat is either dead or alive, not both.
Indeterminacy and Probability Distribution Maps
According to classical physics, and in particular Newton’s laws of motion, particles move 
in a trajectory (or path) that is determined by the particle’s velocity (the speed and direc-
tion of travel), its position, and the forces acting on it. Even if you are not familiar with 
Newton’s laws, you probably have an intuitive sense of them. For example, when you 
chase a baseball in the outfield, you visually predict where the ball will land by observ-
ing its path. You do this by noting its initial position and velocity, watching how these 
are affected by the forces acting on it (gravity, air resistance, wind), and then inferring its 
trajectory, as shown in Figure 7.17▶, on the next page. If you knew only the ball’s veloc-
ity, or only its position (imagine a still photo of the baseball in the air), you could not 
predict its landing spot. In classical mechanics, both position and velocity are required 
to predict a trajectory.

▲ Figure 7.18  Trajectory versus Probability  In quantum mechanics, we cannot calculate 
deterministic trajectories. Instead, it is necessary to think in terms of probability maps: 
statistical pictures of where a quantum-mechanical particle, such as an electron, is most likely 
to be found. In this hypothetical map, darker shading indicates greater probability.
Newton’s laws of motion are deterministic—the present determines the future. 
This means that if two baseballs are hit consecutively with the same velocity from the 
same position under identical conditions, they will land in exactly the same place. The 
same is not true of electrons. We have just seen that we cannot simultaneously know the 
position and velocity of an electron; therefore, we cannot know its trajectory. In quan-
tum mechanics, trajectories are replaced with probability distribution maps (Figure 7.18▼). 
A probability distribution map is a statistical map that shows where an electron is likely 
to be found under a given set of conditions.
To understand the concept of a probability distribution map, let us return to base-
ball. Imagine a baseball thrown from the pitcher’s mound to a catcher behind home 
plate (Figure 7.19◀). The catcher can watch the baseball’s path, predict exactly where it 
will cross home plate, and place his mitt in the correct place to catch it. As we have seen, 
the same predictions cannot be made for an electron. If an electron were thrown from 
the pitcher’s mound to home plate, it would land in a different place every time, even if 
it were thrown in exactly the same way. This behavior is called indeterminacy. A base-
ball’s future path is determined by its position and velocity when it leaves the pitcher’s 
hand. In contrast, the future path of an electron is indeterminate and can only be 
described statistically.
In the quantum-mechanical world of the electron, the catcher cannot know where 
the electron will cross the plate for any given throw. However, if he were to record hun-
dreds of identical electron throws, the catcher would observe a reproducible, statistical 
pattern of where the electron crosses the plate. He could even draw a map of the strike zone

This is a probability distribution map. In the sections that follow, we discuss quantum-
mechanical electron orbitals, which are essentially probability distribution maps for elec-
trons as they exist within atoms.

Quantum Mechanics and the Atom
As we have seen, the position and velocity of the electron are complementary properties—
if we know one accurately, the other becomes indeterminate. Since velocity is directly 
related to energy (recall that kinetic energy equals 1
2 mv2), position and energy are also com-
plementary properties—the more we know about one, the less we know about the other. 
Many of the properties of an element, however, depend on the energies of its electrons. 
For example, whether an electron is transferred from one atom to another to form an ionic 
bond depends in part on the relative energies of the electron in the two atoms.
In the following paragraphs, we describe the probability distribution maps for elec-
tron states in which the electron has well-defined energy but not well-defined position. In 
other words, for each of these states, we can specify the energy of the electron precisely, but 
not its location at a given instant. Instead, the electron’s position is described in terms of an 
orbital, a probability distribution map showing where the electron is likely to be found. 
Since chemical bonding often involves the sharing of electrons between atoms to form 
covalent bonds, the spatial distribution of atomic electrons is important to bonding.
The mathematical derivation of energies and orbitals for electrons in atoms comes 
from solving the Schrödinger equation for the atom of interest. The general form of the 
Schrödinger equation is:
	
Hc = Ec
[7.6]
The symbol H is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations that rep-
resents the total energy (kinetic and potential) of the electron within the atom. The symbol 
E is the actual energy of the electron. The symbol c is the wave function, a mathematical 
function that describes the wavelike nature of the electron. A plot of the wave function 
squared (c2) represents an orbital, a position probability distribution map of the electron.
Solutions to the Schrödinger Equation for  
the Hydrogen Atom
When the Schrödinger equation is solved, it yields many solutions—many possible 
wave functions. The wave functions themselves are fairly complicated mathemati-
cal ­functions, and we do not examine them in detail in this book. Instead, we intro-
duce graphical representations (or plots) of the orbitals that correspond to the wave 
functions. Each orbital is specified by three interrelated quantum numbers: n, the  
principal quantum number; l, the angular momentum quantum number 
These states are known as energy 
eigenstates.

An operator is different from a 
normal algebraic entity. In general, an 
operator transforms a mathematical 
function into another mathematical 
function. For example, d>dx is an 
operator that means “take the 
derivative of.” When d>dx operates 
on a function (such as x2), it returns 
another function (2x).

pronounced “sigh.”

Numbers

(sometimes called the azimuthal quantum number); and ml, the magnetic quantum 
number. These quantum numbers all have integer values, as had been hinted at by 
both the Rydberg equation and Bohr’s model. A fourth quantum number, ms, the spin 
quantum number, specifies the orientation of the spin of the electron. We examine 
each of these quantum numbers individually.
The Principal Quantum Number (n)
The principal quantum number is an integer that determines the overall size 
and energy of an orbital. Its possible values are n = 1, 2, 3, c  and so on. For 
the hydrogen atom, the energy of an electron in an orbital with quantum num-
ber n is given by the equation:
	
En = -2.18 * 10 - 18 J a 1
n2b  (n = 1, 2, 3, c) 
[7.7]
The energy is negative because the electron’s energy is lowered (made more neg-
ative) by its interaction with the nucleus (see the description of Coulomb’s law 
in Section 8.3). The constant, 2.18 * 10 - 18 J, is known as the Rydberg constant 
for hydrogen (RH). Notice that orbitals with higher values of n have greater (less 
negative) energies, as shown in the energy-level diagram at left. Notice also that, 
as n increases, the spacing between the energy levels decreases.
The Angular Momentum Quantum Number (l)
The angular momentum quantum number is an integer that determines the shape of 
the orbital. We will consider these shapes in Section 7.6. The possible values of l are 
0, 1, 2, c, (n - 1).  In other words, for a given value of n, l can be any integer (including 
0) up to n - 1. For example, if n = 1, then the only possible value of l is 0; if n = 2, the 
possible values of l are 0 and 1. To avoid confusion between n and l, values of l are often 
assigned letters as follows:
n = 4
E4 = −1.36 × 10−19 J
n = 3
E3 = −2.42 × 10−19 J
n = 2

E2 = −5.45 × 10−19 J

E1 = −2.18 × 10−18 J

designated with letters in alphabetical 
order so that l = 4 is designated g, 
l = 5 is designated h, and so on.

The magnetic quantum number is an integer that specifies the orientation of the orbital. 
We will consider these orientations in Section 7.6. The possible values of ml are the inte-
ger values (including zero) ranging from -l to +l. For example, if l = 0, then the only 
possible value of ml is 0; if l = 1, the possible values of ml are -1, 0, and +1.

The Spin Quantum Number (ms)
The spin quantum number specifies the orientation of the spin of the electron. Electron 
spin is a fundamental property of an electron (like its negative charge). One electron 
does not have more or less spin than another—all electrons have the same amount of 
spin. The orientation of the electron’s spin is quantized, with only two possibilities: that 
we can call spin up (ms = +1>2) and spin down (ms = -1>2). The spin quantum num-
ber becomes important in Section 8.3 when we begin to consider how electrons occupy 
orbitals. Here, we focus only on the first three quantum numbers.
Each specific combination of the first three quantum numbers (n, l, and ml) specifies 
one atomic orbital. For example, the orbital with n = 1, l = 0, and ml = 0 is known as 
the 1s orbital. The 1 in 1s is the value of n, and the s specifies that l = 0. There is only one 
1s orbital in an atom, and its ml value is zero. Orbitals with the same value of n are said to 
be in the same principal level (or principal shell). Orbitals with the same value of n 
and l are said to be in the same sublevel (or subshell). The following diagram shows all 
of the orbitals (each represented by a small square) in the first three principal levels:
The idea of a “spinning” electron is 
something of a metaphor. A more 
correct way to express the same idea 
is to say that an electron has inherent 
angular momentum.

orbital), with ml = 0. The l = 1 sublevel—called the 2p sublevel—contains three 2p 
orbitals, with ml = -1, 0, +1.
Summarizing Orbitals:
▶
▶
The number of sublevels in any level is equal to n, the principal quantum number. 
Therefore, the n = 1 level has one sublevel, the n = 2 level has two sublevels, and  
so on.
▶
▶
The number of orbitals in any sublevel is equal to 2l + 1. Therefore, the s sublevel 
(l = 0) has one orbital, the p sublevel (l = 1) has three orbitals, the d sublevel (l = 2) 
has five orbitals, and so on.
▶
▶
The number of orbitals in a level is equal to n2. Therefore, the n = 1 level has one 
­orbital, the n = 2 level has four orbitals, the n = 3 level has nine orbitals, and so on.

Quantum Numbers I
What are the quantum numbers and names (for example, 2s, 2p) of the orbitals in the n = 4 principal level? How many 
n = 4 orbitals exist?
Solution
First, determine the possible values of l (from the given 
value of n). For a given value of n, the possible values of l 
are 0, 1, 2, c, (n - 1).
n = 4; therefore, l = 0, 1, 2, and 3
Next, determine the possible values of ml for each value 
of l. For a given value of l, the possible values of ml are the 
integer values, including zero, ranging from -l to +l. The 
name of an orbital is its principal quantum number (n) 
­followed by the letter corresponding to the value l. The 
total number of orbitals is given by n2.

Light is emitted as
electron falls back to

▶ Figure 7.21  Excitation and 
Radiation  When an atom absorbs energy, 
an electron can be excited from an orbital in 
a lower-energy level to an orbital in a higher-
energy level. The electron in this “excited 
state” is unstable, however, and relaxes to 
a lower-energy level, releasing energy in the 
form of electromagnetic radiation.
Atomic Spectroscopy Explained
Quantum theory explains the atomic spectra of atoms we discussed in Section 7.3. 
Each wavelength in the emission spectrum of an atom corresponds to an electron 
transition between quantum-mechanical orbitals. When an atom absorbs energy, an 
electron in a lower-energy orbital is excited or promoted to a higher-energy orbital, 
as shown in Figure 7.21▼. In this new configuration, however, the atom is unstable, 
These sets of quantum numbers are each supposed to specify an orbital. One set, 
however, is erroneous. Which one and why?
(a)	 n = 3;  l = 0;  ml = 0	
(b)	 n = 2;  l = 1;  ml = -1
(c)	 n = 1;  l = 0;  ml = 0	
(d)	 n = 4;  l = 1;  ml = -2
Solution
Choice (d) is erroneous because for l = 1, the possible values of ml are only -1, 0, 
and +1.
For Practice 7.6  Each set of quantum numbers is supposed to specify an orbital. 
However, each set contains one quantum number that is not allowed. Replace the 
quantum number that is not allowed with one that is allowed.
(a)	n = 3; l = 3; ml = +2

and the electron quickly falls back or relaxes to a lower-energy orbital. As it does so, 
it releases a photon of light containing an amount of energy precisely equal to the 
energy difference between the two energy levels. We saw previously (see Equation 7.7) 
that the energy of an orbital in a hydrogen atom with principal quantum number n 
is given by En = -2.18 * 10 - 18 J (1>n2), where n = 1, 2, 3, c The difference in energy 
between two levels ninitial and nfinal is given by ∆E = Efinal - Einitial. If we substitute the 
­expression for En into the expression for ∆E, we get the following important expression 
for the change in energy that occurs in a hydrogen atom when an electron changes 
energy levels:
 ∆E = Efinal - Einitial

[7.8]
For example, suppose that an electron in a hydrogen atom relaxes from an orbital in 
the n = 3 level to an orbital in the n = 2 level. We determine ∆E, the energy difference 
corresponding to the transition from n = 3 to n = 2, as follows:
 ∆Eatom = E2 - E3
 = -2.18 * 10 - 18 J a 1
22b - c -2.18 * 10 - 18 J a 1
32b d
 = -2.18 * 10 - 18 J a 1
22 - 1
32b
 = -3.03 * 10 - 19 J
The energy carries a negative sign because the atom emits the energy as it relaxes from 
n = 3 to n = 2. Since energy must be conserved, the exact amount of energy emitted by 
the atom is carried away by the photon:
∆Eatom = -Ephoton
This energy determines the frequency and wavelength of the photon. Since the wave-
length of the photon is related to its energy as E = hc>l, we calculate the wavelength of 
the photon as:
 l = hc
E
 =
(6.626 * 10 - 34 J # s)(3.00 * 108 m>s)
3.03 * 10 - 19 J
 = 6.56 * 10 - 7 m or 656 nm
Consequently, the light emitted by an excited hydrogen atom as it relaxes from an 
orbital in the n = 3 level to an orbital in the n = 2 level has a wavelength of 656 nm 
(red). Similarly, we can calculate the light emitted due to a transition from n = 4 to 
n = 2, which is 486 nm (green). Notice that transitions between orbitals that are further 
apart in energy produce light that is higher in energy, and therefore shorter in wave-
length, than transitions between orbitals that are closer together. Figure 7.22▶ on the 
next page shows several of the transitions in the hydrogen atom and their ­corresponding 
wavelengths.
The Rydberg equation, 
1>l = R(1>m2 - 1>n2), can be 
derived from the relationships just 
covered. We leave this derivation to 
an exercise (see Problem 7.98).

and asked to find the wavelength of emitted light.

als using Equation 7.7 and subtract to find ∆Eatom.
In the second part, find Ephoton by taking the negative of

CHECK  The units of the answer (m) are correct for wavelength. The magnitude is reasonable because 10 - 6 m is in the 
infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. You know that transitions from n = 3 or n = 4 to n = 2 lie in the visible 
region, so it makes sense that a transition between levels of higher n value (which are energetically closer to one another) 
results in light of longer wavelength.

The Shapes of Atomic Orbitals
As we noted previously, the shapes of atomic orbitals are important because covalent 
chemical bonds depend on the sharing of the electrons that occupy these orbitals. In 
one model of chemical bonding, for example, a bond consists of the overlap of atomic 
orbitals on adjacent atoms. The shapes of the overlapping orbitals determine the shape 
of the molecule. Although we limit ourselves in this chapter to the orbitals of the hydro-
gen atom, we will see in Chapter 8 that the orbitals of all atoms can be approximated as 
being hydrogen-like and therefore having very similar shapes to those of hydrogen.
The shape of an atomic orbital is determined primarily by l, the angular momentum 
quantum number. Recall that each value of l is assigned a letter that corresponds to par-
ticular orbitals. For example, the orbitals with l = 0 are called s orbitals; those with 
l = 1, p orbitals; those with l = 2, d orbitals, and so on. We now examine the shape of 
each of these orbitals.
s Orbitals (l=0)
The lowest energy orbital is the spherically symmetrical 1s orbital shown in  
Figure 7.23(a)▼. This image is actually a three-dimensional plot of the wave function 
squared (c2), which represents probability density, the probability (per unit volume) 
of finding the electron at a point in space.
c2 = probability density =
probability
unit volume
▼ Figure 7.23  The 1s Orbital: Two 
Representations  In (a) the dot density is proportional 
to the electron probability density. In (b), the height 
of the curve is proportional to the electron probability 
density. The x-axis is r, the distance from the nucleus.

324	
Chapter 7  The Quantum-Mechanical Model of the Atom
The magnitude of c2 in this plot is proportional to the density of the dots shown in the 
image. The high dot density near the nucleus (at the very center of the plot) indicates a 
higher probability density for the electron. As you move away from the nucleus, the 
probability density decreases. Figure 7.23(b) on the previous page hows a plot of proba-
bility density (c2) versus r, the distance from the nucleus. The plot represents a slice 
through the three-dimensional plot of c2 and illustrates how the probability density 
decreases as r increases.
We can better understand probability density with the help of a thought experiment. 
Imagine an electron in the 1s orbital located within the volume surrounding the nucleus. 
Imagine also taking a photograph of the electron every second for 10 or 15 minutes. In 
one photograph, the electron is very close to the nucleus, in another it is farther away, 
and so on. Each photo has a dot showing the electron’s position relative to the nucleus 
when the photo was taken. Remember that we can never predict where the electron will 
be for any one photo. However, if we took hundreds of photos and superimposed all of 
them, we would have a plot similar to Figure 7.23(a)—a statistical representation of how 
likely the electron is to be found at each point.
This thought experiment can result in a possible misunderstanding: that the elec-
tron is moving around (like a moth near a flame) between photographs. However, in the 
quantum-mechanical model, that is not the case. Between photographs, the location of 
the electron is uncertain—in a sense its location is spread out over the entire volume of 
the orbital. Only when the photograph is taken (that is, when a measurement of the 
electron’s location is made) does the location of the electron become localized to one 
spot. Between measurements, the electron has no single location. Recall from Section 7.1 
that the measurement affects the outcome of any quantum system.
We can also represent an atomic orbital as a geometrical shape that encompasses the 
volume where the electron is likely to be found most frequently—typically, 90% of the 
time. For example, we represent the 1s orbital as the three-dimensional sphere shown in 
Figure 7.24◀. If we were to superimpose the dot-density representation of the 1s orbital on 
the shape representation, 90% of the dots would be within the sphere, meaning that 
when the electron is in the 1s orbital it has a 90% chance of being found within the sphere.
The plots we have just seen in Figures 7.23 and 7.24 represent probability density. How-
ever, they are a bit misleading because they seem to imply that the electron is most likely 
to be found at the nucleus. To get a better idea of where the electron is most likely to be 
found, we use a plot called the radial distribution function, shown in Figure 7.25◀ 
for the 1s orbital. The radial distribution function represents the total probability of finding 
the electron within a thin spherical shell at a distance r from the nucleus:
Total radial probability (at a given r) =
probability
unit volume * volume of shell at r
The radial distribution function represents, not probability density at a point r, but total 
probability at a radius r. In contrast to probability density, which has a maximum at the 
nucleus, the radial distribution function has a value of zero at the nucleus. It increases to 
a maximum at 52.9 pm and then decreases again with increasing r.
The shape of the radial distribution function is the result of multiplying together 
two functions with opposite trends in r. The two functions are:
1.	 the probability density function (c2), which is the probability per unit volume, has a 
maximum at the nucleus, and decreases with increasing r; and
2.	 the volume of the thin shell, which is zero at the nucleus and increases with 
­increasing r.
At the nucleus (r = 0), for example, the probability density is at a maximum; however, 
the volume of a thin spherical shell is zero, so the radial distribution function is zero. As 
r increases, the volume of the thin spherical shell increases. We can understand this by 
making an analogy to an onion. A spherical shell at a distance r from the nucleus is like a 
layer in an onion at a distance r from its center. If the layers of the onion all have the 
same thickness, then the volume of any one layer—think of this as the total amount of 
onion in the layer—is greater as r increases. Similarly, the volume of any one spherical 
shell in the radial distribution function increases with increasing distance from the

nucleus, resulting in a greater total probability of finding the electron within that shell. 
Close to the nucleus, this increase in volume with increasing r outpaces the decrease in 
probability density, reaching a maximum at 52.9 pm. Farther out, however, the density 
tapers off faster than the volume increases.
The maximum in the radial distribution function, 52.9 pm, turns out to be the very 
same radius that Bohr had predicted for the innermost orbit of the hydrogen atom. How-
ever, there is a significant conceptual difference between the two radii. In the Bohr 
model, every time you probe the atom (in its lowest energy state), you would find the 
electron at a radius of 52.9 pm. In the quantum-mechanical model, you would generally 
find the electron at various radii, with 52.9 pm having the greatest probability.
The probability densities and radial distribution functions for the 2s and 3s ­orbitals 
are shown in Figure 7.26▼. Like the 1s orbital, these orbitals are spherically symmetric.

These orbitals are larger in size than the 1s orbital, and, unlike the 1s orbital, they con-
tain at least one node. A node is a point where the wave function (c), and therefore the 
probability density (c2) and radial distribution function, all pass through zero. A node in 
a wave function is much like a node in a standing wave on a vibrating string. We can see 
nodes in an orbital most clearly by looking at a slice through the orbital. Plots of proba-
bility density and the radial distribution function as a function of r both reveal the pres-
ence of nodes. The probability of finding the electron at a node is zero.

distribution function is the same for each of the three 2p orbitals when the x-axis of the graph 
is taken as the axis containing the lobes of the orbital.
d Orbitals (l=2)
Each principal level with n = 3 or greater contains five d orbitals (ml = -2, -1, 0, +1, +2). 
The five 3d orbitals are shown in Figure 7.28▶. Four of these orbitals have a cloverleaf 
shape, with four lobes of electron density around the nucleus and two perpendicular 
nodal planes. The dxy, dxz, and dyz orbitals are oriented along the xy, xz, and yz planes, 
respectively, and their lobes are oriented between the corresponding axes. The four lobes 
of the dx2 - y2 orbital are oriented along the x- and y-axes. The dz2 orbital is different in 
shape from the other four, having two lobes oriented along the z-axis and a donut-
shaped ring along the xy plane. The 4d, 5d, 6d, ..., orbitals are all similar in shape to the 
3d orbitals, but they contain additional nodes and are progressively larger in size.
f Orbitals (l=3)
Each principal level with n = 4 or greater contains seven f orbitals (ml = -3, -2
 -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3), as shown in Figure 7.29▶. These f orbitals have more lobes and 
nodes than d orbitals.
p Orbitals (l=1)
Each principal level with n = 2 or greater contains three p orbitals (ml = -1, 0, +1). The 
three 2p orbitals and their radial distribution functions are shown in Figure 7.27▼. The p 
orbitals are not spherically symmetric like the s orbitals, but they have two lobes of elec-
tron density on either side of the nucleus and a node located at the nucleus. The three p 
orbitals differ only in their orientation and are orthogonal (mutually perpendicular) to 
one another. It is convenient to define an x-, y-, and z-axis system and then label each p 
orbital as px, py, and pz. The 3p, 4p, 5p, and higher p orbitals are all similar in shape to the 
2p orbitals, but they contain additional nodes (like the higher s orbitals) and are progres-
sively larger in size.
A nodal plane is a plane where the 
electron probability density is zero. 
For example, in the dxy orbitals, the 
nodal planes lie in the xz and yz 
planes.

The wave on the left has a positive amplitude over its entire length, whereas the wave on 
the right has a positive amplitude over half of its length and a negative amplitude over the 
other half. The sign of the amplitude of a wave—positive or negative—is known as its 
phase. In these images, blue indicates positive phase and red indicates negative phase. The 
phase of a wave determines how it interferes with another wave as we saw in Section 7.2.

Chapter 7  The Quantum-Mechanical Model of the Atom
Just as a one-dimensional wave has a phase, so does a three-dimensional wave. We 
often represent the phase of a quantum-mechanical orbital with color. For example, the 
phases of a 1s and 2p orbital are represented as follows:
2p orbital
1s orbital
In these depictions, blue represents positive phase and red represents negative phase. The 
1s orbital is all one phase, whereas the 2p orbital exhibits two different phases. The phase 
of quantum-mechanical orbitals is important in bonding, as we shall see in Chapter 10.
The Shape of Atoms
If some orbitals are shaped like dumbbells and three-dimensional cloverleafs, and if most 
of the volume of an atom is empty space diffusely occupied by electrons in these orbit-
als, then why do we often depict atoms as spheres? Atoms are drawn as spheres because 
most atoms contain many electrons occupying a number of different orbitals. Therefore, 
the shape of an atom is obtained by superimposing all of its orbitals. If we superimpose 
the s, p, and d orbitals, we get a roughly spherical shape, as shown in Figure 7.30◀.
▲ Figure 7.30  Why Atoms Are 
Spherical  Atoms are depicted as 
roughly spherical because all the 
orbitals together make up a roughly 
spherical shape.

Key Concepts
The Realm of Quantum Mechanics (7.1)
▶
▶The theory of quantum mechanics explains the behavior of par-
ticles, such as photons (particles of light) and electrons, in the 
atomic and subatomic realms.
▶
▶Since the electrons of an atom determine many of its chemical 
and physical properties, quantum mechanics is foundational to 
understanding chemistry.
The Nature of Light (7.2)
▶
▶Light is a type of electromagnetic radiation—a form of energy 
embodied in oscillating electric and magnetic fields that travels 
through space at 3.00 * 108 m>s.
▶
▶The wave nature of light is characterized by its wavelength—the 
distance between wave crests—and its ability to experience inter-
ference (constructive or destructive) and diffraction.
▶
▶The particle nature of light is characterized by the specific quan-
tity of energy carried in each photon.
▶
▶The electromagnetic spectrum includes all wavelengths of elec-
tromagnetic radiation from gamma rays (high energy per photon, 
short wavelength) to radio waves (low energy per photon, long 
wavelength). Visible light is a tiny sliver in the middle of the elec-
tromagnetic spectrum.
Atomic Spectroscopy (7.3)
▶
▶Atomic spectroscopy is the study of the light absorbed and emit-
ted by atoms when an electron makes a transition from one ­energy 
level to another.
▶
▶The wavelengths absorbed or emitted in atomic spectra depend 
on the energy differences between the levels involved in the tran-
sition; large energy differences result in short wavelengths, and 
small energy differences result in long wavelengths.
The Wave Nature of Matter (7.4)
▶
▶Electrons have a wave nature with an associated wavelength; the 
de Broglie relation quantifies the wavelength of an electron.
▶
▶The wave nature and particle nature of matter are complemen-
tary—the more we know of one, the less we know of the other.
▶
▶The wave–particle duality of electrons is quantified in Heisen-
berg’s uncertainty principle, which states that there is a limit to 
how well we can know both the position of an electron (associ-
ated with the electron’s particle nature) and the velocity times the 
mass of an electron (associated with the electron’s wave nature)—
the more accurately one is measured, the greater the uncertainty 
in measurement of the other.
▶
▶The inability to simultaneously know both the position and the ve-
locity of an electron results in indeterminacy, the inability to pre-
dict a trajectory for an electron. Consequently, electron behavior is 
described differently than the behavior of everyday-sized particles.
▶
▶The trajectory we normally associate with macroscopic objects 
is replaced, for electrons, with statistical descriptions that show 
not the electron’s path, but the region where it is most likely to 
be found.
The Quantum-Mechanical Model of  
the Atom (7.5, 7.6)
▶
▶The most common way to describe electrons in atoms according 
to quantum mechanics is to solve the Schrödinger equation for 
the energy states of the electrons within the atom. When the elec-
tron is in these states, its energy is well defined but its position is 
not. The position of an electron is described by a probability distri-
bution map called an orbital.
▶
▶The solutions to the Schrödinger equation (including the ener-
gies and orbitals) are characterized by four quantum numbers:  
n, l, ml, and ms.
▶
▶The principal quantum number (n) determines the energy of the 
electron and the size of the orbital; the angular momentum quan-
tum number (l) determines the shape of the orbital; the magnetic 
quantum number (ml) determines the orientation of the orbital; 
and the spin quantum number (ms) specifies the orientation of 
the spin of the electron.

Chapter 7  The Quantum-Mechanical Model of the Atom
	 98. 	Before quantum mechanics was developed, Johannes Rydberg 
developed an equation that predicted the wavelengths (l) in 
the atomic spectrum of hydrogen:

Data Interpretation and Analysis
UV Radiation and Sunscreen
	114.	 On average sunlight shines on the surface of Earth with an 
­intensity of 910 Watts>m2. Some of this energy is in the form  
of ­ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The compounds in chemical 
­sunscreens absorb ultraviolet rays and release the energy as 
­lower-energy infrared (IR) rays, thereby preventing the skin-
damaging UV rays from reaching the skin. You may have ­noticed 
references to UV-A (320–400 nm) and UV-B (280–320 nm) pro-
tection in sunscreen packaging and advertisements. Figure a▶ 
lists the chemical formula and molar mass of two compounds, 
2-ethylhexyl p-methoxycinnamate (2-EHMC), a UV-B sun-
screen, and terephthalylidenedicamphor sulfonic acid (TDSA), 
a UV-A sunscreen.

Answers to Conceptual Connections
Frequency of Light
7.1	 (b) Infrared light has a lower frequency range than visible light, 
which in turn has a lower frequency range than ultraviolet light.
The Photoelectric Effect
7.2	 Observation A corresponds to 632 nm, observation B corre-
sponds to 325 nm, and observation C corresponds to 455 nm. 
The shortest wavelength of light (highest energy per photon) 
corresponds to the photoelectrons with the greatest kinetic 
­energy. The longest wavelength of light (lowest energy per pho-
ton) corresponds to the instance in which no photoelectrons 
were observed.
The de Broglie Wavelength of Macroscopic Objects
7.3	 Because of the baseball’s large mass, its de Broglie wavelength is 
minuscule. (For a 150-g baseball, l is on the order of 10 - 34 m.) 
This minuscule wavelength is insignificant compared to the size 
of the baseball itself, and therefore its effects are not observable.
The Relationship between n and l
7.4	 (c) Since l can have a maximum value of n - 1 and since n = 3, 
l can have a maximum value of 2.
The Relationship between l and ml
7.5	 (d) Since ml can have the integer values (including 0) be-
tween -l and +l and since l = 2, the possible values of ml are 
-2, -1, 0, +1, and +2.
Emission Spectra
7.6	 (c) The energy difference between n = 3 and n = 2 is great-
est because the energy differences become closer together with 
­increasing n. The greater energy difference results in an emitted 
photon of greater energy and therefore shorter wavelength.

ation as elements do, organic molecules absorb over a broad 
range of wavelengths. Figure b▼ plots absorbance versus wave-

reat advances in science occur not only when a scientist sees something new, but 
also when a scientist sees what everyone else has seen in a new way. In other 
words, great scientists often see patterns where others have seen only disjointed 
facts. Such was the case in 1869 when Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907), a Russian chem-
ist, saw a pattern in the properties of elements. Mendeleev’s insight led to the periodic 
table, arguably the single most important tool for chemists. Recall that scientists devise 
theories that explain the underlying reasons for observations. Mendeleev’s periodic 
­table is a compact way to summarize a large number of observations; quantum mechan-
ics (covered in Chapter 7) is the theory that explains the underlying reasons for the 
­periodic table. Quantum mechanics explains how electrons are arranged in atoms, 
which in turn determines the element’s properties. Since the periodic table is organized 
according to those properties, quantum mechanics beautifully accounts for 
Mendeleev’s periodic table. In this chapter, we see a continuation of the theme we have 
been developing since page one of this book—the properties of macroscopic substances 
(in this case, the elements in the periodic table) are explained by the properties of the 
particles that compose them (in this case, atoms and their electrons).
	 8.1	
Nerve Signal Transmission
As you sit reading this book, tiny pumps in the membranes of your cells are working 
hard to transport ions—especially sodium (Na +) and potassium (K +)—through those 
membranes. Amazingly, the ions are pumped in opposite directions. Sodium ions are 

338	
Chapter 8  Periodic Properties of the Elements 
pumped out of cells, while potassium ions are pumped into cells. The result is a chemical 
gradient for each ion: the concentration of sodium is higher outside the cell than within, 
whereas just the opposite is true for potassium. These ion pumps are analogous to the 
water pumps in a high-rise building that pump water against the force of gravity to a 
tank on the roof. Other structures within the membrane, called ion channels, are like 
the building’s faucets. When these open, sodium and potassium ions flow back down 
their gradients—sodium flowing in and potassium flowing out. This movement of ions 
is the basis for the transmission of nerve signals in the brain and throughout the body. 
Every move you make, every thought you have, and every sensation you experience is 
mediated by these ion movements.
How do the pumps and channels differentiate between sodium and potassium ions 
to selectively move one out of the cell and the other into the cell? To answer this ques-
tion, we must examine the ions more closely. Both ions are cations of group 1A metals. 
All group 1A metals tend to lose one electron to form cations with a 1+ charge, so that 
cannot be the decisive factor. Potassium (atomic number 19) lies directly below sodium 
in the periodic table (atomic number 11), indicating that it has more protons, neutrons, 
and electrons than sodium. How do these additional subatomic particles affect the 
properties of potassium? As we will see in this chapter, although a higher atomic num-
ber does not always result in a larger ion (or atom), it does in the case of potassium (rela-
tive to sodium). The potassium ion has a radius of 133 pm whereas the sodium ion has a 
radius of 95 pm. (Recall that 1 pm = 10 - 12 m.) The pumps and channels within cell 
membranes are so sensitive that they distinguish between the sizes of these two ions and 
selectively allow only one or the other to pass.
r = 95 pm
r = 133 pm

K+
The relative size of sodium and potassium ions is an example of a periodic property: 
one that is predictable based on an element’s position within the periodic table. In this 
chapter, we examine several periodic properties of elements, including atomic radius, ion-
ization energy, and electron affinity. We will see that these properties, as well as the overall 
arrangement of the periodic table, are explained by quantum-mechanical theory, which 
we examined in Chapter 7. The arrangement of elements in the periodic table—originally 
based on similarities in the properties of the elements—reflects how electrons fill quantum-
mechanical orbitals.
	 8.2	
The Development of the Periodic Table
Prior to the 1700s, the number of known elements was relatively small, consisting 
mostly of the metals that had long been used for coinage, jewelry, and weapons. From 
the early 1700s to the mid-1800s, however, chemists discovered over 50 new elements. 
The first attempt to organize these elements according to similarities in their proper-
ties was made by the German chemist Johann Döbereiner (1780–1849), who grouped 
elements into triads: three elements with similar properties. For example, Döbereiner 
formed a triad out of barium, calcium, and strontium, three fairly reactive metals. About 
50 years later, English chemist John Newlands (1837–1898) organized elements into 
octaves, in analogy to musical notes. When arranged this way, the properties of every 
eighth element were similar, much as every eighth note in the musical scale is similar. 
Newlands endured some ridicule for drawing an analogy between chemistry and music, 
including the derisive comments of one colleague who asked Newlands if he had ever 
tried ordering the elements according to the first letters of their names.
The modern periodic table is credited primarily to the Russian chemist Dmitri Men-
deleev, even though a similar organization had been suggested by the German chemist 
Julius Lothar Meyer (1830–1895). Recall from Chapter 2 that Mendeleev’s table is based

on the periodic law, which states that when elements are arranged in order of increasing 
mass, certain properties recur periodically. Mendeleev arranged the elements in a table 
in which mass increases from left to right and elements with similar properties fall in the 
same columns.
Mendeleev’s arrangement was a huge success, allowing him to predict the exis-
tence and properties of yet undiscovered elements such as eka-aluminum (later discov-
ered and named gallium) and eka-silicon (later discovered and named germanium). The 
properties of these two elements are summarized in Figure 8.1▲. (As noted in Chapter 
2, eka means “the one beyond” or “the next one” in a family of elements.) However, 
Mendeleev did encounter some difficulties. For example, according to accepted values 
of atomic masses, tellurium (with higher mass) should come after iodine. But based on 
their properties, Mendeleev placed tellurium before iodine and suggested that the mass 
of tellurium was erroneous. The mass was correct; later work by the English physicist 
Henry Moseley (1887–1915) showed that listing elements according to atomic number, 
rather than atomic mass, resolves this problem and results in even better correlation 
with elemental properties.
Notice the scientific approach in practice in the history of the periodic table. A 
number of related observations led to a scientific law—the periodic law. Mendeleev’s 
table, an expression of the periodic law, had predictive power as laws usually do. How-
ever, it did not explain why the properties of elements recurred or why certain elements 
had similar properties. Recall from Chapter 1 that laws summarize behavior while theo-
ries explain behavior. The theory that explains the reasons behind the periodic law is 
quantum-mechanical theory. In this chapter, we explore the connection between the 
periodic table and quantum-mechanical theory.

Electron Configurations: How Electrons 
Occupy Orbitals
Quantum-mechanical theory describes the behavior of electrons in atoms. Since 
chemical bonding involves the transfer or sharing of electrons, quantum-mechan-
ical theory helps us understand and describe chemical behavior. As we saw in ­ 
Chapter 7, electrons in atoms exist within orbitals. An electron configuration for 
an atom shows the particular orbitals that electrons occupy for that atom. For exam-
ple, consider the ground state—or lowest energy state—electron configuration for a

Electron Configurations

340	
Chapter 8  Periodic Properties of the Elements 
The electron configuration indicates that hydrogen’s one electron is in the 1s 
orbital. Electrons generally occupy the lowest energy orbitals available. Since the 1s 
orbital is the lowest energy orbital in hydrogen (see Section 7.5), hydrogen’s electron 
occupies that orbital. If we could write electron configurations for all the elements, 
we could see how the arrangements of the electrons within their atoms correlate 
with the element’s chemical properties. However, the Schrödinger equation solu-
tions (the atomic orbitals and their energies) that we described in Chapter 7 are for 
the hydrogen atom. What do the atomic orbitals of other atoms look like? What are 
their relative energies?
The Schrödinger equation for multielectron atoms has terms to account for the 
interactions of the electrons with one another that make it too complicated to solve 
exactly. However, approximate solutions indicate that the orbitals in multielectron 
atoms are hydrogen-like—they are similar to the s, p, d, and f orbitals that we examined 
in Chapter 7. In order to see how the electrons in multielectron atoms occupy these 
hydrogen-like orbitals, we must examine two additional concepts: the effects of electron 
spin, a fundamental property of all electrons that affects the number of electrons allowed 
in any one orbital; and sublevel energy splitting, which determines the order of orbital fill-
ing within a level.
Electron Spin and the Pauli Exclusion Principle
We can represent the electron configuration of hydrogen (1s1) in a slightly different way 
with an orbital diagram, which gives similar information but symbolizes the electron 
as an arrow and the orbital as a box. The orbital diagram for a hydrogen atom is:
1s
H
In an orbital diagram, the direction of the arrow (pointing up or pointing down) 
represents the orientation of the electron’s spin. Recall from Section 7.5 that the  orienta-
tion of the electron’s spin is quantized, with only two possibilities—spin up (ms = +1
2) 
and spin down (ms = -1
2). In an orbital diagram, ms = +1
2 is represented with a half-
arrow pointing up (w) and ms = -1
2 is represented with a half-arrow pointing down (z). 
In a collection of hydrogen atoms, the electrons in about half of the atoms are spin up 
and the electrons in the other half are spin down. Since no additional electrons are pres-
ent within the hydrogen atom, we conventionally represent the hydrogen atom electron 
configuration with its one electron as spin up.
Helium is the first element on the periodic table that contains two electrons. Its two 
electrons occupy the 1s orbital:
He  1s2
How do the spins of the two electrons in helium align relative to each other? The answer 
to this question is addressed by the Pauli exclusion principle, formulated by Wolf-
gang Pauli (1900–1958) in 1925:
Pauli exclusion principle: no two electrons in an atom can have 
the same four quantum numbers.
Since two electrons occupying the same orbital have three identical quantum numbers 
(n, l, and ml), they must have different spin quantum numbers. Because there are only 
two possible spin quantum numbers (+1
2 and -1
2), the Pauli exclusion principle implies 
that each orbital can have a maximum of only two electrons, with opposing spins.
By applying the exclusion principle, we write an electron configuration and orbital 
diagram for helium as follows:
1s2
1s

helium:

The two electrons have three quantum numbers in common (because they are in the 
same orbital) but have different spin quantum numbers (as indicated by the opposing 
half-arrows in the orbital diagram).
Sublevel Energy Splitting in Multielectron Atoms
A major difference in the (approximate) solutions to the Schrödinger equation for multi-
electron atoms compared to the solutions for the hydrogen atom is the energy ordering 
of the orbitals. In the hydrogen atom, the energy of an orbital depends only on n, the 
principal quantum number. For example, the 3s, 3p, and 3d orbitals (which are empty 
for hydrogen in its lowest energy state) all have the same energy—they are degenerate. 
The orbitals within a principal level of a multielectron atom, in contrast, are not degener-
ate—their energy depends on the value of l. We say that the energies of the sublevels are 
split. In general, the lower the value of l within a principal level, the lower the energy (E) of 
the corresponding orbital. Thus, for a given value of n:
E(s orbital) 6 E( p orbital) 6 E(d orbital) 6 E( f orbital)
In order to understand why the sublevels split in this way, we must examine three 
key concepts associated with the energy of an electron in the vicinity of a nucleus:  
(1) Coulomb’s law, which describes the interactions between charged particles;  
(2) shielding, which describes how one electron can shield another electron from the 
full charge of the nucleus; and (3) penetration, which describes how one atomic 
orbital can overlap spatially with another, thus penetrating into a region that is close 
to the nucleus (and therefore less shielded from nuclear charge). We then discuss how 
these concepts, together with the spatial distributions of electron probability for 
each orbital, result in the energy ordering that we just saw.
Coulomb’s Law
The attractions and repulsions between charged particles, first introduced in Section 2.4, 
are described by Coulomb’s law, which states that the potential energy (E) of two charged 
particles depends on their charges (q1 and q2) and on their separation (r):
	
E =
1
4pe0
 
q1q2
r

[8.1]
In this equation, e0 is a constant (e0 = 8.85 * 10 - 12 C2>J # m). The potential energy 
is positive for charges of the same sign (plus * plus, or minus * minus) and negative for 
charges of opposite sign (plus * minus, or minus * plus). The magnitude of the poten-
tial energy depends inversely on the separation between the charged particles. We can 
draw three important conclusions from Coulomb’s law:
• For like charges, the potential energy (E) is positive and decreases as the particles 
get farther apart (as r increases). Since systems tend toward lower potential energy, 
like charges repel each other (in much the same way that like poles of two magnets 
repel each other).
• For opposite charges, the potential energy is negative and becomes more negative 
as the particles get closer together (as r decreases). Therefore, opposite charges (like 
opposite poles on a magnet) attract each other.
• The magnitude of the interaction between charged particles increases as the charges 
of the particles increase. Consequently, an electron with a charge of 1- is more 
strongly attracted to a nucleus with a charge of 2+ than it it is to a nucleus with a 
charge of 1+.

energy of two oppositely charged particles as they get closer together?
(a)	 Their potential energy decreases.
(b)	 Their potential energy increases.
(c)	 Their potential energy does not change.
Shielding
In multielectron atoms, any one electron experiences both the positive charge of the 
nucleus (which is attractive) and the negative charges of the other electrons (which are 
repulsive). We can think of the repulsion of one electron by other electrons as screening or 
shielding that electron from the full effects of the nuclear charge. For example, consider 
a lithium ion (Li +). The lithium ion contains two electrons, so its electron configuration 
is identical to that of helium:
Li +  1s2
Imagine bringing a third electron toward the lithium ion. When the third electron 
is far from the nucleus, it experiences the 3+ charge of the nucleus through the screen or 
shield of the 2- charge of the two 1s electrons, as shown in Figure 8.2(a)▼. We can think 
of the third electron as experiencing an effective nuclear charge (Zeff) of approxi-
mately 1+ (3+ from the nucleus and 2- from the electrons, for a net charge of 1+). The 
inner electrons in effect shield the outer electron from the full nuclear charge.

▲ Figure 8.2  Shielding and Penetration  (a) An electron far from the nucleus is partly 
shielded by the electrons in the 1s orbital, reducing the effective net nuclear charge that it 
experiences. (b) An electron that penetrates the electron cloud of the 1s orbital experiences 
more of the nuclear charge.
Penetration
Now imagine allowing this third electron to come closer to the nucleus. As the third elec-
tron penetrates the electron cloud of the 1s electrons, it begins to experience the 3+ charge 
of the nucleus more fully because it is less shielded by the intervening electrons. If the 
electron could somehow get closer to the nucleus than the 1s electrons, it would experi-
ence the full 3+ charge, as shown in Figure 8.2(b)▲. In other words, as the outer electron 
undergoes penetration into the region occupied by the inner electrons, it experiences a 
greater nuclear charge and therefore (according to Coulomb’s law) a lower energy.
Electron Spatial Distributions and Sublevel Splitting
We now have examined the concepts we need to understand the energy splitting of the 
sublevels within a principal level. The splitting is a result of the spatial distributions of

343
electrons within a sublevel. Recall from Section 7.6 that the radial distribution function 
for an atomic orbital shows the total probability of finding the electron within a thin 
spherical shell at a distance r from the nucleus.
Figure 8.3▶ shows the radial distribution functions of the 2s and 2p orbitals 
superimposed on one another (the radial distribution function of the 1s orbital is 
also shown). Notice that, in general, an electron in a 2p orbital has a greater probabil-
ity of being found closer to the nucleus than an electron in a 2s orbital. We might 
initially expect, therefore, that the 2p orbital would be lower in energy. However, 
exactly the opposite is true—the 2s orbital is actually lower in energy, but only when 
the 1s orbital is occupied. (When the 1s orbital is empty, the 2s and 2p orbitals are 
degenerate.) Why? The reason is the bump near r = 0 (near the nucleus) for the 2s 
orbital. This bump represents a significant probability of the electron being found 
very close to the nucleus. Even more importantly, this area of the probability pene-
trates into the 1s orbital—it gets into the region where shielding by the 1s electrons is 
less effective. In contrast, most of the probability in the radial distribution function 
of the 2p orbital lies outside the radial distribution function of the 1s orbital. Conse-
quently, almost all of the 2p orbital is shielded from nuclear charge by the 1s orbital. 
The end result is that the 2s orbital—since it experiences more of the nuclear charge 
due to its greater penetration—is lower in energy than the 2p orbital. The 
results are similar when we compare the 3s, 3p, and 3d orbitals. The s 
orbitals penetrate more fully than the p orbitals, which in turn penetrate 
more fully than the d orbitals, as shown in Figure 8.4▶.
Figure 8.5▼ shows the energy ordering of a number of orbitals in multi-
electron atoms. Notice these features of Figure 8.5:
• Because of penetration, the sublevels of each principal level are not 
­degenerate for multielectron atoms.
• In the fourth and fifth principal levels, the effects of penetration be-
come so important that the 4s orbital lies lower in energy than the 3d 
orbitals and the 5s orbital lies lower in energy than the 4d orbitals.
• The energy separations between one set of orbitals and the next be-
come smaller for 4s orbitals and beyond, and the relative energy order-
ing of these orbitals can actually vary among elements. These 
variations result in irregularities in the electron configurations of the 
transition metals and their ions (as we shall see later).

Electron Configurations for Multielectron Atoms
Now that we know the energy ordering of orbitals in multielectron atoms, we can deter-
mine ground state electron configurations for the rest of the elements. Since we know 
that electrons occupy the lowest energy orbitals available when the atom is in its ground 
state and that only two electrons (with opposing spins) are allowed in each orbital, we 
can systematically build up the electron configurations for the elements. This pattern 
of orbital filling is known as the aufbau principle (the German word aufbau means 
“build up”). For lithium, with three electrons, the electron configuration and orbital 
diagram are:
1s22s1

For carbon, which has six electrons, the electron configuration and orbital diagram are:

Notice that the 2p electrons occupy the p orbitals (of equal energy) singly, rather than 
pairing in one orbital. This way of filling orbitals is known as Hund’s rule, which states 
that when filling degenerate orbitals, electrons fill them singly first, with parallel spins. Hund’s 
rule is a result of an atom’s tendency to find the lowest energy state possible. When two 
electrons occupy separate orbitals of equal energy, the repulsive interaction between 
them is lower than when they occupy the same orbital because the electrons are spread 
out over different regions of space. By convention we denote these parallel spins with 
half arrows pointing up.
Summarizing Orbital Filling:
▶
▶
Electrons occupy orbitals so as to minimize the energy of the atom; therefore, lower 
energy orbitals fill before higher energy orbitals. Orbitals fill in the following order: 
1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 5s 4d 5p 6s.
▶
▶
Orbitals can hold no more than two electrons each. When two electrons occupy the 
same orbital, their spins are opposite. This is another way of expressing the Pauli 
exclusion principle (no two electrons in one atom can have the same four quantum 
numbers).
▶
▶
When orbitals of identical energy are available, electrons first occupy these orbitals 
singly with parallel spins rather than in pairs. Once the orbitals of equal energy are 
half full, the electrons start to pair (Hund’s rule).
Remember that the number of 
electrons in a neutral atom is equal to 
its atomic number.
Unless otherwise specified, we use 
the term electron configuration to 
mean the ground state (or lowest 
energy) configuration.
Electrons with parallel spins have 
correlated motion that minimizes their 
mutual repulsion.

The electron configuration of neon represents the complete filling of the n = 2 
principal level. When writing electron configurations for elements beyond neon, or 
beyond any other noble gas, we can abbreviate the electron configuration of the previ-
ous noble gas—sometimes called the inner electron configuration—by the symbol for the 
noble gas in square brackets. For example, the electron configuration of sodium is:
Na  1s22s22p63s1
We can write this configuration more compactly by using [Ne] to represent the inner 
electrons:
Na  [Ne] 3s1
[Ne] represents 1s22s22p6, the electron configuration for neon.
To write an electron configuration for an element, first find its atomic number from 
the periodic table—this number equals the number of electrons. Then use the order of 
filling to distribute the electrons in the appropriate orbitals. Remember that each orbital 
can hold a maximum of two electrons. Consequently,
• the s sublevel has only one orbital and can therefore hold only 2 electrons.
• the p sublevel has three orbitals and can hold 6 electrons.
• the d sublevel has five orbitals and can hold 10 electrons.
• the f sublevel has seven orbitals and can hold 14 electrons.

Electron Configurations, Valence 
Electrons, and the Periodic Table
Recall that Mendeleev arranged the periodic table so that elements with similar chem-
ical properties lie in the same column. We can begin to make the connection between 
an element’s properties and its electron configuration by superimposing the electron 
configurations of the first 18 elements onto a par-
tial periodic table, as shown in Figure 8.6▶. As we 
move to the right across a row, the orbitals fill in 
the correct order. With each subsequent row, the 
highest principal quantum number increases by 
one. Notice that as we move down a column, the 
number of electrons in the outermost principal energy 
level (highest n value) remains the same. The key con-
nection between the macroscopic world (an ele-
ment’s chemical properties) and the atomic world 
(an atom’s electronic structure) lies in these outer-
most electrons.
An atom’s valence electrons are those that are 
important in chemical bonding. For main-group ele-
ments, the valence electrons are those in the outermost principal energy level. For transition 
elements, we also count the outermost d electrons among the valence electrons (even 
though they are not in an outermost principal energy level). The chemical properties of 
an element depend on its valence electrons, which are instrumental in bonding because 
they are held most loosely (and are therefore the easiest to lose or share). We can now see 
why the elements in a column of the periodic table have similar chemical properties: 
they have the same number of valence electrons.
We distinguish between valence electrons and all the other electrons in an atom, 
which are called core electrons. For example, silicon, with the electron configuration 
1s22s22p63s23p2, has four valence electrons (those in the n = 3 principal level) and ten 
core electrons as shown in the right margin.

Ge  1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p2
Since germanium is a main-group element, its valence electrons are 
those in the outermost principal energy level. For germanium the 
n = 4 principal level is outermost. Consequently, the n = 4 electrons 
are valence electrons and the rest are core electrons.
Note: In this book, we write electron configurations with the orbitals in the 
order of filling. However, electron configurations are sometimes written in 
order of increasing principal quantum number. The electron configu-
ration of germanium written in order of increasing principal quantum 
number is Ge 1s22s22p63s23p63d104s24p2.

Chapter 8  Periodic Properties of the Elements 
Orbital Blocks in the Periodic Table
A pattern similar to what we just saw for the first 18 elements exists for the entire peri-
odic table, as shown in Figure 8.7▼. Note that because of the filling order of orbitals, 
we can divide the periodic table into blocks representing the filling of particular sub-
levels. The first two columns on the left side of the periodic table comprise the s block, 
with outer electron configurations of ns1 (the alkali metals) and ns2 (the alkaline earth 
metals). The six columns on the right side of the periodic table comprise the p block, 
with outer electron configurations of ns2 np1, ns2 np2, ns2 np3, ns2 np4, ns2 np5 (halogens), 
and ns2 np6 (noble gases). The transition elements comprise the d block, and the lan-
thanides and actinides (also called the inner transition elements) comprise the f block. 
(For compactness, the f block is normally printed below the d block instead of being 
embedded within it.)
You can see that the number of columns in a block corresponds to the maximum num-
ber of electrons that can occupy the particular sublevel of that block. The s block has two 
columns (corresponding to one s orbital holding a maximum of two electrons); the p 
block has six columns (corresponding to three p orbitals with two electrons each); 
the d block has 10 columns (corresponding to five d orbitals with two electrons 
each); and the f block has 14 columns (corresponding to seven f orbitals with two 
electrons each).
Notice also that, except for helium, the number of valence electrons in any main-group 
element is equal to its lettered group number. For example, we know that chlorine has seven 
valence electrons because it is in group 7A.
Lastly, note that, for main-group elements, the row number in the periodic table is 
equal to the number (or n value) of the highest occupied principal level. For example, because 
chlorine is in row 3, its highest principal level is the n = 3 level.

8.4  Electron Configurations, Valence Electrons, and the Periodic Table

Recall from Chapter 2 that main-group elements are those in the two far left col-
umns (groups 1A, 2A) and the six far right columns (groups 3A–8A) of the periodic table.
Summarizing Periodic Table Organization:
▶
▶
The periodic table is divisible into four blocks corresponding to the filling of the 
four quantum sublevels (s, p, d, and f).
▶
▶
The group number of a main-group element is equal to the number of valence elec-
trons in that element.
▶
▶
The row number of a main-group element is equal to the highest principal quantum 
number of that element.

Writing an Electron Configuration for an Element  
from Its Position in the Periodic Table
The organization of the periodic table allows us to write the electron configuration for 
an element based on its position in the periodic table. For example, suppose we want 
to write an electron configuration for Cl. The inner electron configuration of Cl is that of 
the noble gas that precedes it in the periodic table, Ne. So we can represent the inner 
electron configuration with [Ne]. We can determine the outer electron configuration—
the configuration of the electrons beyond the previous noble gas—by tracing the ele-
ments between Ne and Cl and assigning electrons to the appropriate orbitals, as shown 
here. Remember that the highest n value is indicated by the row number (in this case, 
3 for chlorine).

We begin with [Ne], then add in the two 3s electrons as we trace across the s block, 
followed by five 3p electrons as we trace across the p block to Cl, which is in the fifth col-
umn of the p block. The electron configuration is:
Cl  [Ne]3s23p5
Notice that Cl is in column 7A and therefore has seven valence electrons and an outer 
electron configuration of ns2np5.

Writing Electron Configurations from the Periodic Table
Refer to the periodic table to write the electron configuration for selenium (Se).
Solution
The atomic number of Se is 34. The noble gas that precedes 
Se in the periodic table is argon, so the inner electron con-
figuration is [Ar]. Obtain the outer electron configuration by 
tracing the elements between Ar and Se and assigning elec-
trons to the appropriate orbitals. Begin with [Ar]. Because 
Se is in row 4, add two 4s electrons as you trace across the s 
block (n = row number). Next, add ten 3d electrons as you 
trace across the d block (n = row number - 1). Lastly, add 
four 4p electrons as you trace across the p block to Se, which 
is in the fourth column of the p block (n = row number).

The Transition and Inner Transition Elements
The electron configurations of the transition elements (d block) and inner transition 
elements (f block) exhibit trends that differ somewhat from those of the main-group 
elements. As we move to the right across a row in the d block, the d orbitals fill as

Notice that the principal quantum number of the d orbitals that fill across each row in the 
transition series is equal to the row number minus one. In the fourth row, the 3d orbitals fill; 
in the fifth row, the 4d orbitals fill; and so on. This happens because, as we discussed in 
Section 8.3, the 4s orbital is generally lower in energy than the 3d orbital (because it 
more efficiently penetrates into the region occupied by the core electrons). The result is 
that the 4s orbital fills before the 3d orbital, even though the 4s orbital’s principal quan-
tum number (n = 4) is higher.
Keep in mind, however, that the 4s and the 3d orbitals are extremely close to each 
other in energy so their relative energy ordering depends on the exact species under 
consideration; this causes some irregular behavior in the transition metals. For example, 
in the first transition series of the d block, the outer configuration is 4s23d x with two 
exceptions: Cr is 4s13d5 and Cu is 4s13d10. This behavior is related to the closely spaced 
3d and 4s energy levels and the stability associated with a half-filled (as in Cr) or com-
pletely filled (as in Cu) sublevel. Actual electron configurations are definitively deter-
mined experimentally (through spectroscopy) and do not always conform to the general 
pattern. Nonetheless, the patterns described here allow us to accurately predict electron 
configurations for most of the elements in the periodic table.
As we move across the f block (the inner transition series), the f orbitals fill. For 
these elements, the principal quantum number of the f orbitals that fill across each

row is the row number minus two. (In the sixth row, the 4f orbitals fill, and in the sev-
enth row, the 5f orbitals fill.) In addition, within the inner transition series, the close 
energy spacing of the 5d and 4f orbitals sometimes causes an electron to enter a 5d 
orbital instead of the expected 4f orbital. For example, the electron configuration of 
gadolinium is [Xe] 6s24f 75d1 (instead of the expected [Xe] 6s24f 8).
	 8.5	
The Explanatory Power of the  
Quantum-Mechanical Model
We can now see how the quantum-mechanical model accounts for the chemical proper-
ties of the elements, such as the inertness of helium or the reactivity of hydrogen, and 
(more generally) how it accounts for the periodic law. The chemical properties of elements 
are largely determined by the number of valence electrons they contain. Their properties are 
periodic because the number of valence electrons is periodic.
Because elements within a column in the periodic table have the same number of 
valence electrons, they have similar chemical properties. The noble gases, for example, 
all have eight valence electrons, except for helium, which has two. Although we do not 
cover the quantitative (or numerical) aspects of the quantum-mechanical model in this 
book, calculations of the overall energy of the electrons within atoms with eight valence 
electrons (or two, in the case of helium) show that they are particularly stable. In other 
words, when s and p quantum sublevels are completely full, the overall energy of the 
electrons that occupy that level is particularly low. Therefore, those electrons cannot 
lower their energy by reacting with other atoms or molecules, so the corresponding 
atom is relatively unreactive or inert. The noble gases are the most chemically stable and 
relatively unreactive family in the periodic table.
Elements with electron configurations close to those of the noble gases are the most 
reactive because they can attain noble gas electron configurations by losing or gaining a 
small number of electrons. For example, alkali metals (group 1A) are among the most 
reactive metals because their outer electron configuration (ns1) is one electron beyond a 
noble gas configuration. They readily react to lose the ns1 electron, obtaining a noble gas 
configuration. This explains why—as we saw in Chapter 2—the group 1A metals tend to 
form 1+ cations. Similarly, alkaline earth metals, with an outer electron configuration 
of ns2, also tend to be reactive metals, losing their ns2 electrons to form 2+ cations. This 
does not mean that forming an ion with a noble gas configuration is in itself energeti-
cally favorable. In fact, forming cations always requires energy. But when the cation 
formed has a noble gas configuration, the energy cost of forming the cation is often less 
than the energy payback that occurs when that cation forms ionic bonds with anions, as 
we shall see in Chapter 9.
On the right side of the periodic table, halogens are among the most reactive 
nonmetals because of their ns2np5 electron configurations. They are only one 
­electron short of a noble gas configuration and tend to react to gain that one elec-
tron, forming 1- ions. Figure 8.8▼, which is similar to Figure 2.14 in Chapter 2,

Elements That Form Ions with Predictable Charges

Periodic Trends in the Size of Atoms 
and Effective Nuclear Charge
In previous chapters, we saw that the volume of an atom is taken up primarily by its 
electrons (Chapter 2) occupying quantum-mechanical orbitals (Chapter 7). We also dis-
cussed how these orbitals do not have a definite boundary but represent only a statisti-
cal probability distribution for where the electron is found. So how  do we define the 
size of an atom? One way to define atomic radii is to consider the distance between non-
bonding atoms that are in direct contact. For example, krypton can be frozen into a solid 
in which the krypton atoms are touching each other but are not bonded together. The 
distance between the centers of adjacent krypton atoms—which we can determine from 
the solid’s density—is then twice the radius of a krypton atom. An atomic radius deter-
mined in this way is called the nonbonding atomic radius or the van der Waals 
radius. The van der Waals radius represents the radius of an atom when it is not bonded 
to another atom.
Another way to define the size of an atom—the bonding atomic radius or 
­covalent radius—is defined differently for nonmetals and metals, as follows:
Nonmetals: one-half the distance between two of the atoms bonded together 
Metals: one-half the distance between two of the atoms next to each other in a 
crystal of the metal
For example, the distance between Br atoms in Br2 is 228 pm; therefore, the Br covalent 
radius is one-half of 228 pm or 114 pm.
Using this method, we can assign radii to all elements in the periodic table that 
form chemical bonds or form metallic crystals. A more general term, the atomic 
radius, refers to a set of average bonding radii determined from measurements on a 
large number of elements and compounds. The atomic radius represents the radius of an 
atom when it is bonded to another atom and is always smaller than the van der Waals 
radius. The approximate bond length of any two covalently bonded atoms is the sum of 
their atomic radii. For example, the approximate bond length for ICl is iodine’s atomic 
radius (133 pm) plus chlorine’s atomic radius (99 pm), a bond length of 232 pm. (The 
actual experimentally measured bond length in ICl is 232.07 pm.)
Figure 8.9▶ plots atomic radius as a function of atomic number for the first 57 ele-
ments in the periodic table. Notice the periodic trend in the radii. Atomic radii peak 
with each alkali metal. Figure 8.10▶ is a relief map of atomic radii for most of the ele-
ments in the periodic table. The general trends in the atomic radii of main-group ele-
ments, which are the same as trends observed in van der Waals radii, are:
1.	 As we move down a column (or family) in the periodic table, atomic radius increases.
2.	 As we move to the right across a period (or row) in the periodic table, atomic radius 
decreases.
We can understand the observed trend in radii as we move down a column based 
on the trends in the sizes of atomic orbitals. Atomic radius is largely determined by the 
valence electrons, the electrons farthest from the nucleus. As we move down a column 
in the periodic table, the highest principal quantum number (n) of the valence elec-
trons increases. Consequently, the valence electrons occupy larger orbitals, resulting in 
larger atoms.
The observed trend in atomic radii as we move to the right across a row, however, is a bit 
more complex. To understand this trend, we must revisit some concepts from Section 8.3, 
including effective nuclear charge and shielding.

Effective Nuclear Charge
The trend in atomic radius as we move to the right across a row in the periodic table is 
determined by the inward pull of the nucleus on the electrons in the outermost princi-
pal energy level (highest n value). According to Coulomb’s law, the attraction between 

354	
Chapter 8  Periodic Properties of the Elements 
a nucleus and an electron increases with increasing magnitude of nuclear charge. For 
example, compare the H atom to the He + ion:
H 
 1s1
He +  1s1
It takes 1312 kJ>mol of energy to remove the 1s electron from hydrogen but 5251 kJ>mol 
of energy to remove it from He +. Why? Although each electron is in a 1s orbital, the elec-
tron in the helium ion is attracted to the nucleus by a 2+ charge, while the electron in 
the hydrogen atom is attracted to the nucleus by only a 1+ charge. Therefore, the elec-
tron in the helium ion is held more tightly (it has lower potential energy according to 
Coulomb’s law), making it more difficult to remove and making the helium ion smaller 
than the hydrogen atom.
As we saw in Section 8.3, any one electron in a multielectron atom experiences both 
the positive charge of the nucleus (which is attractive) and the negative charges of the 
other electrons (which are repulsive). Consider again the outermost electron in the lith-
ium atom:
Li 1s22s1
Even though the 2s orbital penetrates into the 1s orbital to some degree, the majority 
of the 2s orbital is outside of the 1s orbital. Therefore the electron in the 2s orbital is 
partially screened or shielded from the 3+ charge of the nucleus by the 2- charge of the 
1s (core) electrons. This reduces the net charge experienced by the 2s electron as shown 
in Figure 8.11▼.

▲ Figure 8.11  Shielding and Effective Nuclear Charge  The valence electron in lithium 
experiences the 3+ charge of the nucleus through the screen of the 2- charge of the core 
electrons. The effective nuclear charge acting on the valence electron is approximately 1+.
As we have seen, we can define the average or net charge experienced by an elec-
tron as the effective nuclear charge. The effective nuclear charge experienced by a par-
ticular electron in an atom is the actual nuclear charge (Z) minus the charge shielded by 
other electrons (S):

	
8.6  Periodic Trends in the Size of Atoms and Effective Nuclear Charge	
355
For lithium, we estimate that the two core electrons shield the valence electron 
from the nuclear charge with high efficiency (S is nearly 2). The effective nuclear charge 
experienced by lithium’s valence electron is therefore slightly greater than 1+.
Now consider the valence electrons in beryllium (Be), with atomic number 4. Its 
electron configuration is:
Be 1s22s2
To estimate the effective nuclear charge experienced by the 2s electrons in beryllium, we 
must distinguish between two different types of shielding: (1) the shielding of the outer-
most electrons by the core electrons and (2) the shielding of the outermost electrons by 
each other. The key to understanding the trend in atomic radius is the difference between 
these two types of shielding:
Core electrons efficiently shield electrons in the outermost prin-
cipal energy level from nuclear charge, but outermost electrons 
do not efficiently shield one another from nuclear charge.
For example, the two outermost electrons in beryllium experience the 4+ charge of the 
nucleus through the shield of the two 1s core electrons without shielding each other 
from that charge very much. We estimate that the shielding (S) experienced by any one 
of the outermost electrons due to the core electrons is nearly 2, but that the shielding 
due to the other outermost electron is nearly 0. The effective nuclear charge experienced 
by beryllium’s outermost electrons is therefore slightly greater than 2+.
The effective nuclear charge experienced by beryllium’s outermost electrons is 
greater than that experienced by lithium’s outermost electron. Consequently, berylli-
um’s outermost electrons are held more tightly than lithium’s, resulting in a smaller 
atomic radius for beryllium. The effective nuclear charge experienced by an atom’s out-
ermost electrons continues to become more positive as we move to the right across the 
rest of the second row in the periodic table, resulting in successively smaller atomic 
radii. The same trend is generally observed in all main-group elements.
Summarizing Atomic Radii for Main-Group Elements:
▶
▶
As we move down a column in the periodic table, the principal quantum number 
(n) of the electrons in the outermost principal energy level increases, resulting in 
larger orbitals and therefore larger atomic radii.
▶
▶
As we move to the right across a row in the periodic table, the effective nuclear 
charge (Zeff) experienced by the electrons in the outermost principal energy level 
increases, resulting in a stronger attraction between the outermost electrons and the 
nucleus, and smaller atomic radii.

Atomic Radii and the Transition Elements
In Figure 8.10, we can see that as we move down the first two rows of a column within 
the transition metals, the elements follow the same general trend in atomic radii as the 
main-group elements (the radii get larger). However, with the exception of the first cou-
ple of elements in each transition series, the atomic radii of the transition elements do 
not follow the same trend as the main-group elements as we move to the right across a 
row. Instead of decreasing in size, the radii of transition elements stay roughly constant across 
each row. Why? The difference is that, across a row of transition elements, the number 
of electrons in the outermost principal energy level (highest n value) is nearly constant 

356	
Chapter 8  Periodic Properties of the Elements 
(recall from Section 8.3, for example, that the 4s orbital fills before the 3d). As another 
proton is added to the nucleus of each successive element, another electron is added as 
well, but the electron goes into an nhighest - 1 orbital. The number of outermost elec-
trons stays constant, and they experience a roughly constant effective nuclear charge, 
keeping the radius approximately constant.

ties, ionic radii, and ionization energies.
Electron Configurations and Magnetic Properties of Ions
We can deduce the electron configuration of a main-group monoatomic ion from the 
electron configuration of the neutral atom and the charge of the ion. For anions, we 
add the number of electrons indicated by the magnitude of the charge of the anion. For 
example, the electron configuration of fluorine (F) is 1s22s22p5 and that of the fluoride 
ion (F -) is 1s22s22p6.
We determine the electron configuration of cations by subtracting the number of 
electrons indicated by the magnitude of the charge. For example, the electron configura-
tion of lithium (Li) is 1s22s1 and that of the lithium ion (Li +) is 1s2 2s0 (or simply 1s2). For 
main-group cations, we remove the required number of electrons in the reverse order of 
filling. However, for transition metal cations, the trend is different. When writing the 
electron configuration of a transition metal cation, we remove the electrons in the highest 
n-value orbitals first, even if this does not correspond to the reverse order of filling. For example, 
the electron configuration of vanadium is:
V [Ar] 4s23d3
The V2 + ion, however, has the following electron configuration:
V2 + [Ar] 4s03d3
In other words, for transition metal cations, the order in which electrons are 
removed upon ionization is not the reverse of the filling order. During filling, the  
4s orbital normally fills before the 3d orbital. When a fourth period transition metal 
­ionizes, however, it loses its 4s electrons before its 3d electrons. Why this unexpected 
behavior? The full answer to this question is beyond our scope, but the following two 
factors contribute to this phenomenon:
• As discussed previously, the ns and (n - 1)d orbitals are extremely close in energy 
and, depending on the exact configuration, can vary in relative energy ordering.
• As the (n - 1)d orbitals begin to fill in the first transition series, the increasing nuclear 
charge stabilizes the (n - 1)d orbitals relative to the ns orbitals. This happens because 
the (n - 1)d orbitals are not the outermost (or highest n) orbitals and are therefore not 
effectively shielded from the increasing nuclear charge by the ns orbitals.
The bottom-line experimental observation is that an ns0(n - 1)dx configuration is 
lower in energy than an ns2(n - 1)dx - 2 configuration for transition metal ions. There-
fore, we remove the ns electrons before the (n - 1)d electrons when we write electron 
configurations for transition metal ions.
The magnetic properties of transition metal ions support these assignments. Recall 
from Section 8.3 that an unpaired electron generates a magnetic field due to its spin. 
Consequently, an atom or ion that contains unpaired electrons is attracted to an exter-
nal magnetic field, and we say that the atom or ion is paramagnetic. For example, 
consider the electron configuration of silver:
5s14d10
[Kr]
Ag
4d
5s
Silver’s unpaired 5s electron causes silver to be paramagnetic. In fact, an early demon-
stration of electron spin—called the Stern–Gerlach experiment—involved the interac-
tion of a beam of silver atoms with a magnetic field.
The order of removing electrons is 
not the reverse of the filling order 
because the energy levels in a cation 
shift relative to the neutral atom.

Chapter 8  Periodic Properties of the Elements 
An atom or ion in which all electrons are paired is not attracted to an external 
­magnetic field—it is instead slightly repelled—and we say that the atom or ion is  
diamagnetic. The zinc atom is diamagnetic:
4s23d10
[Ar]
Zn
3d
4s
The magnetic properties of the zinc ion provide confirmation that the 4s electrons 
are indeed lost before 3d electrons in the ionization of zinc. If zinc lost two 3d electrons 
upon ionization, then the Zn2 + would be paramagnetic (because the two electrons 
would come out of two different filled d orbitals, leaving each of them with one unpaired 
electron). That does not happen and the zinc ion, like the zinc atom, is diamagnetic 
because the 4s electrons are lost instead:
4s03d10
[Ar]
Zn2+

4s
Observations in other transition metals confirm that the ns electrons are lost before the 
(n - 1)d electrons upon ionization.

Ionic Radii
What happens to the radius of an atom when it becomes a cation? An anion? Consider, 
for example, the difference between the Na atom and the Na + ion. Their electron con-
figurations are:
Na  [Ne] 3s1
Na +  [Ne] 3s0
The sodium atom has an outer 3s electron and a neon core. Because the 3s electron is the 
outermost electron and it is shielded from the nuclear charge by the core electrons, it 
contributes greatly to the size of the sodium atom. The sodium cation, having lost the 
outermost 3s electron, has only the neon core and carries a charge of 1+. Without the 3s 
electron, the sodium cation (ionic radius = 95 pm) is much smaller than the sodium 
atom (covalent radius = 186 pm). The trend is the same with all cations and their 
atoms, as shown in Figure 8.12▼:
Cations are much smaller than their corresponding atoms.

What about anions? Consider the difference between Cl and Cl -. 
Their electron configurations are:
Cl  [Ne] 3s23p5
Cl -  [Ne] 3s23p6
The chlorine anion has one additional outermost electron but no 
additional proton to increase the nuclear charge. The extra electron 
increases the repulsions among the outermost electrons, resulting in 
a chloride anion that is larger than the chlorine atom. The trend is 
the same with all anions and their atoms, as shown in Figure 8.13◀.
Anions are much larger than their corresponding 
atoms.
We can observe an interesting trend in ionic size when we exam-
ine the radii of an isoelectronic series of ions—ions with the same 
number of electrons. Consider the following ions and their radii:
S2 -  (184 pm)
Cl -  (181 pm)
K +  (133 pm)
Ca2 +(99 pm)
18 electrons
18 electrons
18 electrons
18 electrons
16 protons
17 protons
19 protons
20 protons
All of these ions have 18 electrons in exactly the same orbitals, but the 
radius of each ion gets successively smaller. Why? The reason is the 
progressively greater number of protons. The S2 - ion has 16 protons 
and therefore a charge of 16+ pulling on 18 electrons. The Ca2 + ion, 
in contrast, has 20 protons, and therefore a charge of 20+ pulling on 
the same 18 electrons. The result is a much smaller radius for the cal-
cium ion. For a given number of electrons, a greater nuclear charge 
results in a smaller atom or ion.

Ionization Energy
The ionization energy (IE) of an atom or ion is the energy required to remove an 
electron from the atom or ion in the gaseous state. Ionization energy is always positive 
because removing an electron always takes energy. (The process is similar to an endo-
thermic reaction, which absorbs heat and therefore has a positive ∆H.) The energy 
required to remove the first electron is the first ionization energy (IE1). For example, we 
represent the first ionization of sodium with the equation:
Na(g) ¡ Na +(g) + 1 e -  IE1 = 496 kJ>mol
The energy required to remove the second electron is the second ionization energy 
(IE2), the energy required to remove the third electron is the third ionization energy (IE3), 
and so on. We represent the second ionization energy of sodium as:
Na +(g) ¡ Na2 +(g) + 1 e -  IE2 = 4560 kJ>mol
Notice that the second ionization energy is not the energy required to remove two elec-
trons from sodium (that quantity is the sum of IE1 and IE2), but rather the energy 
required to remove one electron from Na +. We look at trends in IE1 and IE2 separately.
Trends in First Ionization Energy
The first ionization energies of the elements through Xe are shown in Figure 8.14▼. 
Notice the periodic trend in ionization energy, peaking at each noble gas and bottoming 
at each alkali metal. Based on what we have learned about electron configurations and 
effective nuclear charge, how can we account for the observed trend? As we have seen,

Ions, Isotopes, and Atomic Size  In the previous sections, we have seen 
how the number of electrons and the number of protons affect the size of an atom or 
ion. However, we have not considered how the number of neutrons affects the size of 
an atom. Why not? Would you expect isotopes—for example, C-12 and C-13—to have 
different atomic radii?

▲ Figure 8.15  Trends in Ionization Energy  First ionization energy increases as we move 
to the right across a period and decreases as we move down a column in the periodic table.
the principal quantum number, n, increases as we move down a column. Within a given 
sublevel, orbitals with higher principal quantum numbers are larger than orbitals with 
smaller principal quantum numbers. Consequently, electrons in the outermost princi-
pal level are farther away from the positively charged nucleus—and are therefore held 
less tightly—as we move down a column. This results in a lower ionization energy as we 
move down a column, as shown in Figure 8.15▼.
What about the trend as we move to the right across a row? For example, would 
it take more energy to remove an electron from Na or from Cl, two elements on either 
end of the third row in the periodic table? We know that Na has an outer electron 
configuration of 3s1 and Cl has an outer electron configuration of 3s23p5. As dis-
cussed previously, the outermost electrons in chlorine experience a higher effective 
nuclear charge than the outermost electrons in sodium (which is why chlorine has a 
smaller atomic radius than sodium). Consequently, we would expect chlorine to 
have a higher ionization energy than sodium, which is indeed the case. We can make 
a similar argument for the other main-group elements: first ionization energy gener-
ally increases as we move to the right across a row in the periodic table, as shown in 
Figure 8.15.
Summarizing First Ionization Energy for Main-Group Elements:
▶
▶
First ionization energy generally decreases as we move down a column (or family) 
in the periodic table because electrons in the outermost principal level are in-
creasingly farther away from the positively charged nucleus and are therefore 
held less tightly.
▶
▶
First ionization energy generally increases as we move to the right across a row (or 
period) in the periodic table because electrons in the outermost principal energy 
level generally experience a greater effective nuclear charge (Zeff).

Exceptions to Trends in First Ionization Energy
If we carefully examine Figure 8.15, we can see some exceptions to the trends in first ion-
ization energies. For example, boron has a smaller ionization energy than beryllium, even 
though it lies to the right of beryllium in the same row. This exception is caused by the dif-
ference between the s block and the p block. Recall from Section 8.3 that the 2p orbital pen-
etrates into the nuclear region less than the 2s orbital. Consequently, the 1s electrons shield 
the electron in the 2p orbital from nuclear charge more than they shield the electrons in 
the 2s orbital. The result, as we saw in Section 8.3, is that the 2p orbitals are higher in energy, 
and therefore the electron is easier to remove (it has a lower first ionization energy). Similar 
exceptions occur for aluminum and gallium, both directly below boron in group 3A.

364	
Chapter 8  Periodic Properties of the Elements 
Another exception occurs between nitrogen and oxygen. Although oxygen is to 
the right of nitrogen in the same row, it has a lower first ionization energy. This 
exception is caused by the repulsion between electrons when they occupy the same 
orbital. Examine the electron configurations and orbital diagrams of nitrogen and 
oxygen shown here:
1s22s22p3
N
2s

2p
1s22s22p4
O

2p
Nitrogen has three electrons in three p orbitals, whereas oxygen has four. In nitrogen, 
the 2p orbitals are half-filled (which makes the configuration particularly stable). One of 
oxygen’s four 2p electrons must pair with another electron, making it easier to remove 
(and less stable). Exceptions for similar reasons occur for S and Se, directly below oxygen 
in group 6A.
Trends in Second and Successive 
Ionization Energies
Notice the trends in the first, second, and third ionization ener-
gies of sodium (group 1A) and magnesium (group 2A), as shown 
at left.
For sodium, there is a huge jump between the first and sec-
ond ionization energies. For magnesium, the ionization energy 
roughly doubles from the first to the second, but then a huge 
jump occurs between the second and third ionization energies. 
What is the reason for these jumps?
We can understand these trends by examining the electron 
configurations of sodium and magnesium:
Na   [Ne] 3s1
Mg   [Ne] 3s2
The first ionization of sodium involves removing the valence 
electron in the 3s orbital. Recall that these valence electrons are 
held more loosely than the core electrons and that the resulting ion has a noble gas con-
figuration, which is particularly stable. Consequently, the first ionization energy is fairly 
low. The second ionization of sodium, however, involves removing a core electron from 
an ion with a noble gas configuration. This requires a tremendous amount of energy, 
making the value of IE2 very high.
As with sodium, the first ionization of magnesium involves removing a valence 
electron in the 3s orbital. This requires a bit more energy than the corresponding ioniza-
tion of sodium because of the trends in Zeff that we discussed earlier (Zeff increases as we 
move to the right across a row). The second ionization of magnesium also involves 
removing an outer electron in the 3s orbital, but this time from an ion with a 1+ charge 
(instead of from a neutral atom). This requires roughly twice the energy as removing the 
electron from the neutral atom. The third ionization of magnesium is analogous to the 
second ionization of sodium—it requires removing a core electron from an ion with a 
noble gas configuration. This requires a tremendous amount of energy, making the 
value of IE3 very high.
As shown in Table 8.1, similar trends exist for the successive ionization energies of 
many elements. The ionization energy increases fairly uniformly with each successive 
removal of an outermost electron, but then takes a large jump with the removal of the 
first core electron.

	 8.8	
Electron Affinities and Metallic 
Character
Electron affinity and metallic character also exhibit periodic trends. Electron affinity is a 
measure of how easily an atom will accept an additional electron; it is crucial to chemi-
cal bonding because bonding involves the transfer or sharing of electrons. Metallic char-
acter is important because of the high proportion of metals in the periodic table and the 
large role they play in our lives. Of the roughly 110 elements, 87 are metals. We examine 
each of these periodic properties individually in this section.
Electron Affinity
The electron affinity (EA) of an atom (or ion) is the energy change associated with 
the gaining of an electron by the atom in the gaseous state. Electron affinity is usu-
ally—though not always—negative because an atom or ion usually 
releases energy when it gains an electron. (The process is analogous 
to an exothermic reaction, which releases heat and therefore has a 
negative ∆H.) In other words, the coulombic attraction between the 
nucleus of an atom and the incoming electron usually results in the 
release of energy as the electron is gained. For example, we represent 
the electron affinity of chlorine with the equation:
Cl(g) + 1 e - ¡ Cl -(g) EA = -349 kJ>mol
Figure 8.16▶ displays the electron affinities for a number of 
main-group elements. As you can see from this figure, the trends in 
electron affinity are not as regular as trends in other properties we 
examined in Sections 8.6 and 8.7. For instance, we might expect elec-
tron affinities to become relatively more positive (so that the addi-
tion of an electron is less exothermic) as we move down a column 
because the electron is located in orbitals with successively higher 
principal quantum numbers and therefore is farther from the

nucleus. This trend applies to the group 1A metals but does not hold for the other col-
umns in the periodic table.
A more regular trend in electron affinity occurs as we move to the right across a row, 
however. Based on the periodic properties we have learned so far, would you expect 
more energy to be released by Na or Cl when an electron is gained? We know that Na has 
an outer electron configuration of 3s1 and Cl has an outer electron configuration of 
3s23p5. Since adding an electron to chlorine gives it a noble gas configuration and add-
ing an electron to sodium does not, and since the outermost electrons in chlorine expe-
rience a higher Zeff than the outermost electrons in sodium, we would expect chlorine to 
have a more negative electron affinity—the process should be more exothermic for chlo-
rine. This is in fact the case. For main-group elements, electron affinity generally 
becomes more negative (more exothermic) as we move to the right across a row in the 
periodic table. The halogens (group 7A) therefore have the most negative electron affini-
ties. But exceptions do occur. For example, notice that nitrogen and the other group 5A 
elements do not follow the general trend. These elements have ns2np3 outer electron 
configurations. When an electron is added to this configuration, it must pair with 
another electron in an already occupied p orbital. The repulsion between two electrons 
occupying the same orbital causes the electron affinity to be more positive than for ele-
ments in the previous column.
Summarizing Electron Affinity for Main-Group Elements:
▶
▶
Most groups (columns) of the periodic table do not exhibit any definite trend in 
electron affinity. Among the group 1A metals, however, electron affinity becomes 
more positive as we move down a column (adding an electron becomes less 
­exothermic).
▶
▶
Electron affinity generally becomes more negative (adding an electron becomes 
more exothermic) as we move to the right across a period (row) in the periodic table.
Metallic Character
As we discussed in Chapter 2, metals are good conductors of heat and electricity: they 
can be pounded into flat sheets (malleability), they can be drawn into wires (ductility), 
they are often shiny, and they tend to lose electrons in chemical reactions. Nonmetals, 
in contrast, have more varied physical properties; some are solids at room temperature, 
others are gases. However, in general, nonmetals are typically poor conductors of heat 
and electricity, and they all tend to gain electrons in chemical reactions.
As we move to the right across a row in the periodic table, ionization energy 
increases and electron affinity becomes more negative; therefore, elements on the left 
side of the periodic table are more likely to lose electrons than elements on the right side 
(which are more likely to gain them). The other properties associated with metals follow 
the same general trend (even though we do not quantify them here). Consequently, as 
shown in Figure 8.17▶:
As we move to the right across a row (or period) in the periodic 
table, metallic character decreases.
As we move down a column in the periodic table, ionization energy decreases, making 
electrons more likely to be lost in chemical reactions. Therefore,
As we move down a column (or family) in the periodic table, 
­metallic character increases.
These trends, based on the quantum-mechanical model, explain the distribu-
tion of metals and nonmetals in the periodic table discussed in Chapter 2. Metals are 
found on the left side and toward the center and nonmetals on the upper right side. 
The change in chemical behavior from metallic to nonmetallic can be seen most 
clearly as we proceed to the right across period 3, or down along group 5A as we can 
see in Figure 8.18▶.

Some Examples of Periodic Chemical 
Behavior: The Alkali Metals, the 
Halogens, and the Noble Gases
In this section, we explore some of the properties and chemical reactions of three 
families in the periodic table: the alkali metals, the halogens, and the noble gases. 
These families exemplify the connection between chemical behavior and electron 
configuration.
The alkali metals (group 1A) have ns1 outer electron configurations. The single 
valence electron that keeps these metals from having noble gas configurations is easily 
removed (the metals have low ionization energies), making these elements the most 
active metals in the periodic table. The halogens (group 7A) have ns2np5 outer electron 
configurations. The one electron needed to attain noble gas configurations is easily 
acquired (the halogens have highly negative electron affinities), making these elements 
among the most active nonmetals in the periodic table. The noble gases (group 8A) have 
electron configurations with full outer s and p sublevels 1ns2np62  and so are the most 
chemically inert family in the periodic table.
In this section of the chapter, we examine the properties of each of these groups 
separately. (Even though hydrogen is often listed in group 1A, it behaves like a nonmetal 
because of its high ionization energy: 1312 kJ>mol. We therefore do not include hydro-
gen in our discussion of the group 1A metals.)
The Alkali Metals (Group 1A)
Table 8.2 lists some selected properties of the alkali metals. Notice that, in general, the 
properties of the alkali metals vary fairly regularly as we proceed down the column. As 
expected from periodic trends, the atomic radius increases steadily while the first ioniza-
tion energy decreases steadily.
With the exception of potassium, density increases as we move down the ­column. 
This is a general trend that occurs in other columns within the periodic table. As we 
move down a column, the increase in mass (due to the additional protons and neu-
trons) outpaces the increase in volume caused by greater atomic radii. The result is 
successively greater densities. The melting points of the alkali metals as a group are 
anomalously low for metals, and they steadily decrease as we move down the column. 
(This is not a general trend for the rest of the periodic table, which shows more irregu-
lar patterns in melting points.)
Because of their generally low first ionization energies, the alkali metals are 
excellent reducing agents—they are readily oxidized, losing electrons to other sub-
stances. Consequently, the alkali metals exist naturally in their oxidized state, either 
in compounds or as dissolved ions in seawater. Since first ionization energy decreases 
as we go down the column, the relative reactivities of the alkali metals tend to 
increase as we move down the column. In other words, the lower the first ionization 
energy of an alkali metal, the greater tendency it will have to lose its electron and the 
more reactive it is.

Chapter 8  Periodic Properties of the Elements 
The reactions of the alkali metals with nonmetals are vigorous. For example, the 
alkali metals (M) react with halogens (X) according to the reaction:
2 M + X2 ¡ 2 MX
The reaction of sodium and chlorine to form sodium chloride is typical:
2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) ¡ 2 NaCl(s)
This reaction emits heat and sparks as it occurs (Figure 8.19◀). Each successive alkali 
metal reacts even more vigorously with chlorine.
The alkali metals also react with water to form the dissolved alkali metal ion, the 
hydroxide ion, and hydrogen gas:
2 M(s) + 2 H2O(l) ¡ 2 M +(aq) + 2 OH -(aq) + H2(g)
The reaction is highly exothermic and can be explosive because the heat from the reac-
tion can ignite the hydrogen gas. The reaction becomes more explosive as we move 
down the column from one metal to the next, as shown in Figure 8.20▼.

Reactions of the Alkali Metals with Water
▶ Figure 8.20  Reactions of 
the Alkali Metals with Water  The 
reactions become progressively 
more vigorous as we move down the 
group. (The rate of the alkali metal 
reaction with water, and therefore 
its vigor, are enhanced by the 
successively lower melting points 
of the alkali metals as we move 
down the column. The low melting 
points of the heavier metals allow 
the emitted heat to actually melt the 
metal, increasing the reaction rate.)
The Halogens (Group 7A)
Table 8.3 lists selected properties of the first four halogens. Notice that the properties of 
the halogens, like those of the alkali metals, vary fairly regularly as we proceed down the 
column. As expected from periodic trends, the atomic radius and the density increase for 
each successive halogen. We can see from the melting and boiling points that fluorine 
and chlorine are both gases at room temperature, bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid.
All of the halogens are powerful oxidizing agents—they are readily reduced, gaining 
electrons from other substances in their reactions. Fluorine is the most powerful oxidiz-
ing agent of the group—reacting with almost everything, including the heavier noble 
gases—and iodine is the least. The halogens all react with metals to form metal halides 
according to the equation:
2 M + n X2 ¡ 2 MXn

where M is the metal, X is the halogen, and MXn is the metal halide. For example, 
chlorine reacts with iron according to the equation:
2 Fe(s) + 3 Cl2(g) ¡ 2 FeCl3(s)
Since metals tend to lose electrons and the halogens tend to gain them, the metal 
halides—like all compounds that form between metals and nonmetals—contain 
ionic bonds.
The halogens also react with hydrogen to form hydrogen halides according to the 
equation:
H2(g) + X2 ¡ 2 HX(g)
The hydrogen halides—like all compounds that form between two nonmetals—­
contain covalent bonds. All of the hydrogen halides form acidic solutions when 
combined with water.
The halogens also react with each other to form interhalogen compounds. For 
example, bromine reacts with fluorine according to the equation:
Br2(l) + F2(g) ¡ 2 BrF(g)
Again, like all compounds that form between two nonmetals, the interhalogen 
­compounds contain covalent bonds.

The Noble Gases (Group 8A)
Table 8.4 lists selected properties of the noble gases. Notice that the properties of the noble 
gases, like those of the alkali metals and halogens, vary fairly regularly as we proceed down 
the column. As expected from periodic trends, the atomic radius and the density increase 
­

Chapter 8  Periodic Properties of the Elements 
for each successive noble gas, and the first ionization energy decreases. As their boiling 
points indicate, all of the noble gases are gases at room temperature and must be cooled to 
extremely low temperatures before they liquefy. For this reason, some noble gases can be 
cryogenic liquids—liquids used to cool other substances to low temperatures. For exam-
ple, researchers often submerse samples of interest in boiling liquid helium to cool them 
down to 4.2 K (or lower) and study their properties at this extremely low temperature.
The high first ionization energies of the noble gases and their completely full s and  
p sublevels make them exceptionally unreactive. In fact, before the 1960s, no noble gas 
compounds were known. Since then, two of the noble gases have been shown to react 
with fluorine (the most reactive nonmetal on the periodic table) under fairly extreme 
conditions. For instance, krypton reacts with fluorine to form KrF2:
Kr + F2 ¡ KrF2
Similarly, Xe reacts with fluorine to form three different xenon fluorides:
Xe + F2  ¡ XeF2
Xe + 2 F2 ¡ XeF4
Xe + 3 F2 ¡ XeF6
The inertness of the noble gases has led to their use in situations where reactions are 
undesirable. For example, argon is used in lightbulbs to prevent the hot tungsten fila-
ment from oxidizing, and helium is part of the mixture breathed by deep-sea divers to 
prevent the toxicity caused by too much oxygen and nitrogen under high pressures. 
(The helium replaces some of the oxygen and nitrogen in the tank, lowering the concen-
trations of oxygen and nitrogen in the blood.)

cools substances to temperatures 
as low as 1.2 K.

Chapter 8  Periodic Properties of the Elements 
Key Concepts
Periodic Properties and the Development of the 
Periodic Table (8.1, 8.2)
▶
▶In the nineteenth century, Dmitri Mendeleev arranged the ele-
ments in an early version of the periodic table so that atomic mass 
increased from left to right in a row and elements with similar 
properties fell in the same columns.
▶
▶Periodic properties are predictable based on an element’s posi-
tion within the periodic table. Periodic properties include atomic 
radius, ionization energy, electron affinity, density, and metallic 
character.
▶
▶Quantum mechanics explains the periodic table by describing 
how electrons fill the quantum-mechanical orbitals within the 
atoms that compose the elements.
Electron Configurations (8.3)
▶
▶An electron configuration for an atom shows which quantum-
mechanical orbitals the atom’s electrons occupy. For example, the 
electron configuration of helium (1s2) indicates that helium’s two 
electrons occupy the 1s orbital.
▶
▶The order of filling quantum-mechanical orbitals in multielectron 
atoms is 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 5s 4d 5p 6s.
▶
▶According to the Pauli exclusion principle, each orbital can hold 
a maximum of two electrons and those electrons have opposing 
spins.
▶
▶According to Hund’s rule, orbitals of the same energy first fill sin-
gly with electrons having parallel spins before pairing.
Electron Configurations and the Periodic Table 
(8.4, 8.5)
▶
▶Because quantum-mechanical orbitals fill sequentially with in-
creasing atomic number, we can infer the electron configuration 
of an element from its position in the periodic table.
▶
▶The most stable electron configurations are those with completely 
full s and p sublevels. Therefore, the most stable and unreactive el-
ements—those with the lowest energy electron configurations—
are the noble gases.
▶
▶Elements with one or two valence electrons are among the most 
active metals, readily losing their valence electrons to attain noble 
gas configurations.
▶
▶Elements with six or seven valence electrons are among the most 
active nonmetals, readily gaining enough electrons to attain a 
noble gas configuration.
Effective Nuclear Charge and Periodic Trends in 
Atomic Size (8.6)
▶
▶The size of an atom is largely determined by its outermost 
­electrons. As we move down a column in the periodic table, 
the principal quantum number (n) of the outermost electrons 
increases, resulting in successively larger orbitals and therefore 
larger atomic radii.
▶
▶As we move across a row in the periodic table, atomic radii de-
crease because the effective nuclear charge—the net or ­average 
charge experienced by the atom’s outermost electrons—­
increases.
▶
▶The atomic radii of the transition elements stay roughly constant 
as we move across each row because electrons are added to the 
nhighest - 1 orbitals while the number of highest n electrons stays 
roughly constant.
Ion Properties (8.7)
▶
▶We determine the electron configuration of an ion by adding or 
subtracting the corresponding number of electrons to the elec-
tron configuration of the neutral atom.
▶
▶For main-group ions, the order in which electrons are removed is 
the same as the order in which they are added in building up the 
electron configuration.
▶
▶For transition metal atoms, the ns electrons are removed before 
the (n - 1)d electrons.
▶
▶The radius of a cation is much smaller than that of the correspond-
ing atom, and the radius of an anion is much larger than that of 
the corresponding atom.
▶
▶The first ionization energy—the energy required to remove 
the first electron from an atom in the gaseous state—generally 
­decreases as we move down a column in the periodic table and in-
creases when we move to the right across a row.
▶
▶Successive ionization energies increase smoothly from one 
­valence electron to the next, but the ionization energy increases 
dramatically for the first core electron.
Electron Affinities and Metallic Character (8.8)
▶
▶Electron affinity—the energy associated with an atom in its 
­gaseous state gaining an electron—does not show a general 
trend as we move down a column in the periodic table, but it 
generally becomes more negative (more exothermic) to the 
right across a row.
▶
▶Metallic character—the tendency to lose electrons in a chemical 
reaction—generally increases down a column in the periodic table 
and decreases to the right across a row.
The Alkali Metals, Halogens, and Noble Gases (8.9)
▶
▶The most active metals are the alkali metals (group 1A), and the 
most active nonmetals are the halogens (group 7A).
▶
▶The alkali metals are powerful reducing agents, reacting with 
many nonmetals—including the halogens and water—to form 
ionic compounds.
▶
▶The halogens are powerful oxidizing agents, reacting with many 
metals to form ionic compounds. The halogens also react with 
many nonmetals to form covalent compounds.
▶
▶The noble gases are relatively unreactive; only krypton and xenon 
form compounds, typically only with fluorine, the most reactive 
element in the periodic table.

Answers to Conceptual Connections
Coulomb’s Law
8.1	 (a) Since the charges are opposite, the potential energy of the 
interaction is negative. As the charges get closer together, r be-
comes smaller and the potential energy decreases (becomes 
more negative).
Penetration and Shielding
8.2	 (c) Penetration results in less shielding from nuclear charge 
and therefore lower energy.
Electron Configurations and Quantum Numbers
8.3	 n = 4, l = 0, ml = 0, ms = +1
2; n = 4, l = 0, ml = 0, ms = -1
2
Valence Electrons and Group Number
8.4	 Nitrogen has five valence electrons. Since nitrogen is a main-
group element, it has the same number of valence electrons as 
its group number in the periodic table.
Effective Nuclear Charge
8.5	 (c) Since Zeff increases from left to right across a row in the peri-
odic table, the valence electrons in S experience a greater effec-
tive nuclear charge than the valence electrons in Al or in Mg.
Ions, Isotopes, and Atomic Size
8.6	 The isotopes of an element all have the same radius for two rea-
sons: (1) neutrons are negligibly small compared to the size of 
an atom and therefore extra neutrons do not increase atomic 
size, and (2) neutrons have no charge and therefore do not 
­attract electrons in the way that protons do.
Ionization Energies and Chemical Bonding
8.7	 As you can see from the successive ionization energies of any 
element, valence electrons are held most loosely and can there-
fore be transferred or shared most easily. Core electrons, on the 
other hand, are held tightly and are not easily transferred or 
shared. Consequently, valence electrons are most important to 
chemical bonding.
Periodic Trends
8.8	 The 3s electron in sodium has a relatively low first ionization 
energy (496 kJ>mol) because it is a valence electron. The en-
ergetic cost for sodium to lose a second electron is extraordi-
narily high (4560 kJ>mol) because the next electron to be lost 
is a core electron (2p). Similarly, the electron affinity of chlo-
rine to gain one electron (-349 kJ>mol) is highly exothermic 
because the added electron completes chlorine’s valence shell. 
The gain of a second electron by the negatively charged chlo-
rine anion is not so favorable. Therefore, we expect sodium and 
chlorine to combine in a 1:1 ratio.

help of chemical bonding theories.
C
hemical bonding is at the heart of chemistry. The bonding theories that we are 
about to examine are—as Karl Popper, a philosopher of science, eloquently states 
in the chapter-opening quote—nets cast to understand the world. In the next two 
chapters, we will examine three theories with successively finer “meshes.” The first is the 
Lewis model, a simple model of chemical bonding, which can be sketched out on the back 
of an envelope. With just a few dots, dashes, and chemical symbols, the Lewis model can 
help us to understand and predict many chemical observations. The second is valence 
bond theory, which treats electrons in a more quantum-mechanical manner but stops 
short of viewing them as belonging to the entire molecule. The third is molecular orbital 
theory, essentially a full quantum-mechanical treatment of the molecule and its electrons 
as a whole. Molecular orbital theory has great predictive power, but at the expense of great 
complexity and intensive computational requirements. Which theory is “correct”? 
Remember that theories are models that help us understand and predict behavior. All 
three of these theories are extremely useful, depending on exactly what aspect of chemical 
bonding we want to predict or understand.

Bonding Models and AIDS Drugs
In 1989, researchers using X-ray crystallography—a technique in which X-rays are scattered 
from crystals of the molecule of interest—determined the structure of a molecule called 
HIV-protease. HIV-protease is a protein (a class of large biological molecules) synthesized by 
We discuss X-ray crystallography in 
more detail in Section 12.2.

Chapter 9  Chemical Bonding I: The Lewis Model
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This particular protein is crucial to the virus’s 
ability to multiply and cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. Without 
HIV-protease, HIV cannot spread in the human body because the virus cannot replicate. In 
other words, without HIV-protease, AIDS can’t develop.
With knowledge of the HIV-protease structure, pharmaceutical companies set out 
to create a molecule that would disable HIV-protease by attaching to the working part of 
the molecule, called the active site. To design such a molecule, researchers used bonding 
theories—models that predict how atoms bond together to form molecules—to simulate 
the shape of potential drug molecules and determine how they would interact with the 
protease molecule. By the early 1990s, pharmaceutical companies had developed sev-
eral drug molecules that seemed to work. Since these molecules inhibit the action of 
HIV-protease, they were named protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors, when given in 
combination with other drugs, decrease the viral count in HIV-infected individuals to 
undetectable levels. Although protease inhibitors do not cure AIDS, many AIDS patients 
are still alive today because of these drugs.
Bonding theories are central to chemistry because they explain how atoms bond 
together to form molecules. They explain why some combinations of atoms are stable 
and others are not. For example, bonding theories explain why table salt is NaCl and not 
NaCl2 and why water is H2O and not H3O. Bonding theories also predict the shapes of 
molecules—a topic in the next chapter—which in turn determine many of the physical 
and chemical properties of compounds.
The bonding model we examine in this chapter is the Lewis model, named after 
the American chemist G. N. Lewis (1875–1946). In the Lewis model, valence electrons 
are represented as dots, and we draw Lewis electron-dot structures (or simply 
Lewis structures) to depict molecules. These structures, which are fairly simple to 
draw, have tremendous predictive power. With minimal computation, the Lewis model 
can be used to predict whether a particular set of atoms will form a stable molecule and 
what that molecule might look like. Although we will also examine more advanced the-
ories in the following chapter, the Lewis model remains the simplest model for making 
quick, everyday predictions about most molecules.
	 9.2	
Types of Chemical Bonds
We begin our discussion of chemical bonding by asking why bonds form in the first 
place. This seemingly simple question is vitally important. Imagine our universe 
without chemical bonding. Such a universe would contain only 91 different kinds of 
substances (the 91 naturally occurring elements). With such a poor diversity of sub-
stances, life would be impossible, and we would not be around to wonder why. The 
answer to the question of why bonds form, however, is not simple and involves not 
only quantum mechanics but also some thermodynamics that we do not introduce 
until Chapter 18. Nonetheless, we can address an important aspect of the answer now: 
Chemical bonds form because they lower the potential energy between the charged particles 
that compose atoms.
As you already know, atoms are composed of particles with positive charges (the 
protons in the nucleus) and negative charges (the electrons). When two atoms approach 
each other, the electrons of one atom are attracted to the nucleus of the other according 
to Coulomb’s law (see Section 8.3) and vice versa. However, at the same time, the elec-
trons of each atom repel the electrons of the other, and the nucleus of each atom repels 
the nucleus of the other. The result is a complex set of interactions among a potentially 
large number of charged particles. If these interactions lead to an overall net reduction 
of energy between the charged particles, a chemical bond forms. Bonding theories help 
us to predict the circumstances under which bonds form and also the properties of the 
resultant molecules.
We discuss proteins in more detail in 
Chapter 22.

and Metallic Bonding 
Recall from Chapter 8 that metals tend to have low ionization energies (their electrons are 
relatively easy to remove) and that nonmetals tend to have negative electron affinities (they 
readily gain electrons). When a metal atom bonds with a nonmetal atom, it transfers one or 
more electrons to the nonmetal. The metal atom becomes a cation and the nonmetal atom 
an anion. These oppositely charged ions attract one another, lowering their overall poten-
tial energy as described by Coulomb’s law. The resulting bond is an ionic bond.
We also discussed in Chapter 8 that nonmetals tend to have high ionization ener-
gies (their electrons are relatively difficult to remove). Therefore, when a nonmetal 
bonds with another nonmetal, neither atom transfers electrons to the other. Instead, 
the two atoms share some electrons. The shared electrons interact with the nuclei of 
both of the bonding atoms, lowering their potential energy in accordance with Cou-
lomb’s law. The resulting bond is a covalent bond.
Recall from Section 3.2 that we can understand the stability of a covalent bond by 
considering the most stable arrangement (the one with the lowest potential energy) of 
two positively charged particles separated by a small distance and a negatively charged 
particle. As we can see in Figure 9.2▶ on the next page, the arrangement in which the 
negatively charged particle lies between the two positively charged ones has the lowest 
potential energy because in this arrangement, the negatively charged particle interacts 
We broadly classify chemical bonds into three types depending on the kind of 
atoms involved in the bonding (Figure 9.1▲):

most strongly with both of the positively charged ones. In a sense, the negatively charged 
particle holds the two positively charged ones together. Similarly, shared electrons in a 
covalent chemical bond hold the bonding atoms together by attracting the positive 
charges of their nuclei.
A third type of bonding, metallic bonding, occurs in metals. Since metals have 
low ionization energies, they tend to lose electrons easily. In the simplest model for 
metallic bonding—called the electron sea model—all of the atoms in a metal lattice pool 
their valence electrons. These pooled electrons are no longer localized on a single 
atom, but delocalized over the entire metal. The positively charged metal atoms are 
then attracted to the sea of electrons, holding the metal together. We discuss metallic 
bonding in more detail in Section 9.11.

In Chapter 8, we saw that, for main-group elements, valence electrons are those 
­electrons in the outermost principal energy level. Because valence electrons are held 
most loosely, and chemical bonding involves the transfer or sharing of electrons 
between two or more atoms, valence electrons are most important in bonding, so the 
Lewis model focuses on these. In a Lewis symbol, we represent the valence electrons 
of main-group elements as dots surrounding the element symbol. For example, the 
electron ­configuration of O is:
1s22s22p4
6 valence electrons
The Lewis symbol for oxygen is:
O
6 dots representing
valence electrons
Each dot in a Lewis symbol represents a valence electron. The dots are placed around 
the element’s symbol with a maximum of two dots per side. We draw the Lewis symbols 
for all of the period 2 elements similarly.
Li– –Be– –Bª– –C«– –N«≠ –ºO¶≠ ≠ºF¶≠ ≠Ne
÷≠
Lewis symbols provide a simple way to visualize the number of valence electrons in 
a main-group atom. Notice that atoms with eight valence electrons—which are particu-
larly stable because they have full s and p sublevels—are easily identified because they 
have eight dots, an octet.
Helium is somewhat of an exception. Its electron configuration and Lewis  
symbol are:
1s2  He≠
The Lewis symbol of helium contains only two dots (a duet). For helium, a duet repre-
sents a stable electron configuration because the n = 1 quantum level fills with only two 
electrons.
Remember, the number of valence 
electrons for any main group is 
equal to the group number of the 
element (except for helium, which is 
in group 8A but has only two valence 
electrons).
Although the exact location of dots is 
not critical, in this book we first place 
dots singly before pairing (except for 
helium, which always has two paired 
dots signifying its duet).

In the Lewis model, a chemical bond is the sharing or transfer of electrons to 
attain stable electron configurations for the bonding atoms. If electrons are transferred, 
as occurs between a metal and a nonmetal, the bond is an ionic bond. If the electrons are 
shared, as occurs between two nonmetals, the bond is a covalent bond. In either case, the 
bonding atoms attain stable electron configurations; since the stable configuration is 
usually eight electrons in the outermost shell, this is known as the octet rule.
When applying the Lewis model, we do not try to calculate the energies associated 
with the attractions and repulsions between electrons and nuclei on neighboring atoms. 
The energy changes that occur because of these interactions are central to chemical 
bonding (as we saw in Section 9.2), yet the Lewis model ignores them because calculat-
ing these energy changes is extremely complicated. Instead the Lewis model uses the 
simple octet rule, a practical approach that accurately predicts what we see in nature for 
a large number of compounds—hence the success and longevity of the Lewis model.
	 9.4	
Ionic Bonding: Lewis Symbols and 
Lattice Energies
Although the Lewis model’s strength is in modeling covalent bonding, it can also be 
applied to ionic bonding. To represent ionic bonding, we move electron dots from the 
Lewis symbol of the metal to the Lewis symbol of the nonmetal and allow the resultant 
ions to form a crystalline lattice composed of alternating cations and anions.
Ionic Bonding and Electron Transfer
Consider potassium and chlorine, which have the following Lewis symbols:
K– ≠ºCl
¶≠
When these atoms bond, potassium transfers its valence electron to chlorine:
K– + ≠ºCl
¶≠¡ K + 3≠C¶ºº≠4 -
The transfer of the electron gives chlorine an octet (shown as eight dots around chlo-
rine) and leaves potassium without any valence electrons but with an octet in the previ-
ous principal energy level (which is now the outermost level):
K
K+
1s22s22p63s23p64s1
1s22s22p63s23p64s0
Octet in previous level
The potassium, having lost an electron, becomes positively charged (a cation), 
while the chlorine, which has gained an electron, becomes negatively charged (an 
anion). We typically write the Lewis symbol of an anion within brackets with the charge 
in the upper right-hand corner, outside the brackets. The positive and negative charges 
attract one another, resulting in the compound KCl.
This example shows how we can use the Lewis model to predict the correct chemical 
formulas for ionic compounds. For the compound that forms between K and Cl, for 
example, the Lewis model predicts a ratio of one potassium cation to every one chloride 
anion, KCl. In nature, when we examine the compound formed between potassium and 
chlorine, we indeed find one potassium ion to every chloride ion.
As another example, consider the ionic compound formed between sodium and sul-
fur. The Lewis symbols for sodium and sulfur are:
Na– –ºS¶≠
Sodium must lose its one valence electron in order to have an octet (in the previous prin-
cipal shell), while sulfur must gain two electrons to attain an octet. Consequently, the 
compound that forms between sodium and sulfur requires a ratio of two sodium atoms 
to every one sulfur atom:
2 Na + 3≠S÷≠42 -
Recall that solid ionic compounds 
do not contain distinct molecules; 
they are composed of alternating 
positive and negative ions in a three-
dimensional crystalline array.

388	
Chapter 9  Chemical Bonding I: The Lewis Model
The two sodium atoms each lose their one valence electron, while the sulfur atom gains 
two electrons and attains an octet. The Lewis model predicts that the correct chemical 
formula is Na2S, which is exactly what we see in nature.

Using Lewis Symbols to Predict the Chemical Formula of an Ionic Compound

Solution
Draw Lewis symbols for calcium and chlorine based on their respective num-
bers of valence electrons, which you can determine from their group number 
in the periodic table.
–Ca– –Cl

Calcium must lose its two valence electrons (to end up with an octet in its 
previous principal shell), while chlorine only needs to gain one electron to 
attain an octet. Draw two chlorine anions, each with an octet and a 1– charge, 
and one calcium cation with a 2+ charge. Place brackets around the chlorine 
anions and indicate the charges on each ion.

Finally, write the formula with subscripts to indicate the number of each ion.

Lattice Energy: The Rest of the Story
The formation of an ionic compound from its constituent elements is usually quite exo-
thermic. For example, when sodium chloride (table salt) forms from elemental sodium 
and chlorine, 411 kJ of heat evolves in the following violent reaction:
Na(s) + 1
2 Cl2(g) ¡ NaCl(s)   ∆H °f = -411 kJ>mol
Where does this energy come from? It might seem that it comes solely from the ten-
dency of metals to lose electrons and nonmetals to gain electrons—but it does not. In 
fact, the transfer of an electron from sodium to chlorine—by itself—actually absorbs 
energy. The first ionization energy of sodium is +496 kJ>mol, and the electron affinity 
of Cl is only -349 kJ>mol. Based only on these energies, the reaction should be endother-
mic by +147 kJ>mol. So why is the reaction so exothermic?
The answer lies in the lattice energy—the energy associated with the formation of 
a crystalline lattice of alternating cations and anions from the gaseous ions. Because the 
sodium ions are positively charged and the chlorine ions are negatively charged, the 
potential energy decreases—as prescribed by Coulomb’s law—when these ions come 
together to form a lattice. That energy is emitted as heat when the lattice forms, as shown 
in Figure 9.3▶. The exact value of the lattice energy, however, is not simple to determine 
because it involves a large number of interactions among many charged particles in a lat-
tice. The most straightforward way to calculate lattice energy is with the Born–Haber cycle.
The Born–Haber Cycle
The Born–Haber cycle is a hypothetical series of steps that represents the formation 
of an ionic compound from its constituent elements. The steps are chosen so that the 
change in enthalpy of each step is known except for the last one, which is the lattice 
energy. The change in enthalpy for the overall process is also known. Using Hess’s law 
(see Section 6.8), we can therefore determine the enthalpy change for the unknown last 
step, the lattice energy.
Consider the formation of NaCl from its constituent elements in their standard 
states. The enthalpy change for the overall reaction is simply the standard enthalpy of 
formation of NaCl(s):
Na(s) + 1
2 Cl2(g) ¡ NaCl(s)  ∆H °f = -411 kJ>mol
Recall that Hess’s law states that the 
change in the overall enthalpy of a 
stepwise process is the sum of the 
enthalpy changes of the steps.

Now consider the following set of steps—the Born–Haber cycle—from which 
NaCl(s) can also be made from Na(s) and Cl2(g):
• The first step is the formation of gaseous sodium from solid sodium.

• The second step is the formation of a chlorine atom from a chlorine molecule.

• The third step is the ionization of gaseous sodium. The enthalpy change for this 
step is the ionization energy of sodium.
Na(g) ¡ Na +(g) + e -  ∆H °step 3 (ionization energy of Na) = +496 kJ
• The fourth step is the addition of an electron to gaseous chlorine. The enthalpy 
change for this step is the electron affinity of chlorine.
Cl(g) + e - ¡ Cl -(g)  ∆H °step 4 (electron affinity of Cl) = -349 kJ
• The fifth and final step is the formation of the crystalline solid from the gaseous 
ions. The enthalpy change for this step is the lattice energy, the unknown quantity.
Na +(g) + Cl -(g) ¡ NaCl(s)  ∆H °step 5 = ∆H °lattice = ?
Figure 9.4▶, on the next page, illustrates the entire Born–Haber cycle for NaCl.
Since the overall reaction obtained by summing the steps in the Born–Haber cycle is 
equivalent to the formation of NaCl from its constituent elements, we use Hess’s law to 
set the overall enthalpy of formation for NaCl(s) equal to the sum of the steps in the 
Born–Haber cycle:

▲ Figure 9.4  Born–Haber Cycle for Sodium Chloride  The sum of the steps is the 
formation of NaCl from elemental Na and Cl2. The enthalpy change of the last step (step 5) is 
the lattice energy.
We then solve this equation for ∆H °step 5, which is ∆H °lattice, and substitute the appropri-
ate values to calculate the lattice energy:
 ∆H °lattice = ∆H °step 5 = ∆H °f - (∆H °step 1 + ∆H °step 2 + ∆H °step 3 + ∆H °step 4)
 = -411 kJ - (+108 kJ + 122 kJ + 496 kJ - 349 kJ)
 = -788 kJ
The value of the lattice energy is a large negative number. The formation of the crys-
talline NaCl lattice from sodium cations and chloride anions is highly exothermic 
and more than compensates for the endothermicity of the electron transfer process. 
Some books define the lattice 
energy as the energy associated 
with separating one mole of an ionic 
lattice into its gaseous constituents, 
which makes the sign of the lattice 
energy positive instead of negative.

In other words, the formation of ionic compounds is not exothermic because sodium 
“wants” to lose electrons and chlorine “wants” to gain them; rather, it is exothermic 
because of the large amount of heat released when sodium and chlorine ions coalesce 
to form a crystalline lattice.
Trends in Lattice Energies: Ion Size
Consider the lattice energies of the following alkali metal chlorides:
Metal Chloride
Lattice Energy (kJ, mol)
LiCl
-834
NaCl
-788
KCl
-701
CsCl
-657
Why does the magnitude of the lattice energy decrease as we move down the column? 
We know from the periodic trends discussed in Chapter 8 that ionic radius increases as 
we move down a column in the periodic table (see Section 8.7). We also know, from our 
discussion of Coulomb’s law in Section 8.3, that the potential energy of oppositely 
charged ions becomes less negative (or more positive) as the distance between the ions 
increases. As the size of the alkali metal ions increases down the column, so does the 
­distance between the metal cations and the chloride anions. The magnitude of each suc-
cessive lattice energy of the chlorides decreases accordingly, making the formation of 
the chlorides less exothermic as you move down the column. In other words, as the ionic 
radii increase as we move down the column, the ions cannot get as close to each other and there-
fore do not release as much energy when the lattice forms.
Trends in Lattice Energies: Ion Charge
Consider the lattice energies of the following two compounds:
Compound
Lattice Energy (kJ,mol)
NaF
-910
CaO
-3414
Why is the magnitude of the lattice energy of CaO so much greater than the lattice 
energy of NaF? Na + has a radius of 95 pm and F - has a radius of 136 pm, resulting in a 
distance between ions of 231 pm. Ca2 + has a radius of 99 pm and O2 - has a radius of ­ 
140 pm, resulting in a distance between ions of 239 pm. Even though the separation 
between the calcium and oxygen is slightly greater (which would tend to lower the 
­lattice energy), the lattice energy for CaO is almost four times greater.
The explanation lies in the charges of the ions. Recall from Coulomb’s law that the 
magnitude of the potential energy of two interacting charges depends not only on the 
distance between the charges, but also on the product of the charges:
E =
1
4pe0
 
q1q2
r
For NaF, E is proportional to (1+)(1-) = 1-, while for CaO, E is proportional to 
(2+)(2-) = 4-, so the relative stabilization for CaO relative to NaF is roughly four times 
greater, as observed in the lattice energy.

Arrange these ionic compounds in order of increasing magnitude of lattice energy: CaO, KBr, KCl, SrO.
Solution
KBr and KCl have lattice energies of smaller magnitude than 
CaO and SrO because of their lower ionic charges (1+, 1- 
compared to 2+, 2-). When you compare KBr and KCl, you 
expect KBr to have a lattice energy of lower magnitude due 
to the larger ionic radius of the bromide ion relative to the 
chloride ion. Between CaO and SrO, you expect SrO to have a 
lower magnitude lattice energy due to the larger ionic radius 
of the strontium ion relative to the calcium ion.

Ionic Bonding: Models and Reality
In this section, we have developed a model for ionic bonding. The value of a model is in 
how well it accounts for what we see in nature (through experiments). Does our ionic 
bonding model explain the properties of ionic compounds, including their high melt-
ing and boiling points, their tendency not to conduct electricity as solids, and their ten-
dency to conduct electricity when dissolved in water?
We modeled an ionic solid as a lattice of individual ions held together by coulombic 
forces that are nondirectional (which means that, as we move away from the center of an 
ion, the forces are equally strong in all directions). To melt the solid, these forces must be 
overcome, which requires a significant amount of heat. Therefore, our model accounts 
for the high melting points of ionic solids. In the model, electrons transfer from the 
metal to the nonmetal, but the transferred electrons remain localized on one atom. In 
other words, our model does not include any free electrons that might conduct electric-
ity (the movement or flow of electrons or other charged particles in response to an elec-
tric potential, or voltage, is electrical current). In addition, the ions themselves are fixed 
in place; therefore, our model accounts for the nonconductivity of ionic solids. When 
our idealized ionic solid dissolves in water, however, the cations and anions dissociate, 
forming free ions in solution. These ions can move in response to electrical forces, creat-
ing an electrical current. Thus, our model predicts that solutions of ionic compounds 
conduct electricity (which in fact they do).

Covalent Bonding: Lewis Structures
The Lewis model provides us with a simple and useful model for covalent bonding. 
In this model, we represent molecular compounds with Lewis structures, which depict 
neighboring atoms as sharing some (or all) of their valence electrons in order to attain 
octets (or duets for hydrogen).
Single Covalent Bonds
To see how covalent bonding is conceived in terms of the Lewis model, consider hydro-
gen and oxygen, which have the following Lewis symbols:
H– –ºO¶≠
In water, these atoms share their unpaired valence electrons so that each hydrogen atom 
gets a duet and the oxygen atom gets an octet as represented with this Lewis structure:
H≠O÷≠H
The shared electrons—those that appear in the space between the two atoms—count 
toward the octets (or duets) of both of the atoms (shown at left).
A shared pair of electrons is called a bonding pair, whereas a pair that is associated 
with only one atom—and therefore not involved in bonding—is a lone pair (shown at 
left). Lone pair electrons are also called nonbonding electrons.
We often represent a bonding pair of electrons by a dash to emphasize that it constitutes 
a chemical bond:
H ¬ O÷ ¬ H
The Lewis model also shows why the halogens form diatomic molecules. Consider 
the Lewis symbol for chlorine:
≠Cl
÷–
If two Cl atoms pair together, they can each have an octet:
≠Cl
÷≠Cl
÷≠ or ≠Cl
÷ ¬ Cl
÷≠
Elemental chlorine does indeed exist as a diatomic molecule in nature, just as the Lewis 
model predicts. The same is true for the other halogens.
Similarly, the Lewis model predicts that hydrogen, which has the Lewis symbol:
H–
should exist as H2. When two hydrogen atoms share their valence electrons, each gets a 
duet, a stable configuration for hydrogen:
H≠H or H ¬ H
Again, the Lewis model predicts correctly. In nature, elemental hydrogen exists as H2 
molecules.
Double and Triple Covalent Bonds
In the Lewis model, two atoms may share more than one electron pair to get octets. For 
example, two oxygen atoms share two electron pairs in order for each oxygen atom to 
have an octet:
O O
O
O
O
O
or
+
O O
Octet

Keep in mind that one dash always 
stands for two electrons (a single 
bonding pair).
O H
H
Duet

Octet
Each oxygen atom has an octet because the additional bonding pair counts toward the octet 
of both oxygen atoms. When two atoms share two electron pairs, the resulting bond is a 
double bond. In general, double bonds are shorter and stronger than single bonds. 
Atoms can also share three electron pairs. Consider the Lewis structure of N2. Since each 
N atom has five valence electrons, the Lewis structure for N2 has 10 electrons. Both nitro-
gen atoms attain octets by sharing three electron pairs:
≠N≠ ≠ ≠N≠ or ≠N‚ N≠

The bond is a triple bond. Triple bonds are even shorter and stronger than double 
bonds. When we examine nitrogen in nature, we find that it exists as a diatomic mole-
cule with a very strong bond between the two nitrogen atoms. The bond is so strong that 
it is difficult to break, making N2 a relatively unreactive molecule.
Covalent Bonding: Models and Reality
The Lewis model predicts the properties of molecular compounds in many ways. First, it 
accounts for why particular combinations of atoms form molecules and others do not. 
For example, why is water H2O and not H3O? We can write a good Lewis structure for 
H2O, but not for H3O.
Oxygen has nine electrons
(one electron beyond an octet)
H

In this way, the Lewis model predicts that H2O should be stable, while H3O should not 
be, and that is in fact the case. However, if we remove an electron from H3O, we get 
H3O +, which should be stable (according to the Lewis model) because, when we remove 
the extra electron, oxygen attains an octet:
+
H
H
H
O
This ion, called the hydronium ion, is in fact stable in aqueous solutions (see Section 4.8).
The Lewis model predicts other possible combinations for hydrogen and oxygen as 
well. For example, we can write a Lewis structure for H2O2 as follows:
H ¬ O÷ ¬ O÷ ¬ H
Indeed, H2O2, or hydrogen peroxide, exists and is often used as a disinfectant and a 
bleach.
The Lewis model also accounts for why covalent bonds are highly directional. The 
attraction between two covalently bonded atoms is due to the sharing of one or more elec-
tron pairs in the space between them. Thus, each bond links just one specific pair of 
atoms—in contrast to ionic bonds, which are nondirectional and hold together an entire array of 
ions. As a result, the fundamental units of covalently bonded compounds are individual 
molecules. These molecules can interact with one another in a number of different ways 
that we cover in Chapter 11. However, in covalently bonded molecular compounds the 
interactions between molecules (intermolecular forces) are generally much weaker than the 
bonding interactions within a molecule (intramolecular forces), as shown in Figure 9.5▼. 
We explore the characteristics of 
multiple bonds more fully in  
Section 9.10.

Chapter 9  Chemical Bonding I: The Lewis Model
When a molecular compound melts or boils, the molecules themselves remain intact—
only the relatively weak interactions between molecules must be overcome. Consequently, 
molecular compounds tend to have lower melting and boiling points than ionic

Electronegativity and Bond Polarity
We know from Chapter 7 that representing electrons with dots, as we do in the Lewis 
model, is a drastic oversimplification. As we have already discussed, this does not invali-
date the Lewis model—which is an extremely useful theory—but we must recognize 
and compensate for its inherent limitations. One limitation of representing electrons as 
dots, and covalent bonds as two dots shared between two atoms, is that the shared elec-
trons always appear to be equally shared. Such is not the case.
For example, consider the Lewis structure of hydrogen fluoride:
H≠F÷≠
The two shared electron dots sitting between the H and the F atoms appear to be equally 
shared between hydrogen and fluorine. However, based on laboratory measurements, 
we know they are not. When HF is put in an electric field, the molecules orient as shown 
in Figure 9.6▼. From this observation, we know that the hydrogen side of the molecule 
HF molecules align

charge. Does this make the bond ionic? No. In an ionic bond, the electron is essentially 
transferred from one atom to another. In HF, the electron is unequally shared. In other 
words, even though the Lewis structure of HF portrays the bonding electrons as residing 
between the two atoms, in reality the electron density is greater on the fluorine atom than 
on the hydrogen atom (Figure 9.7◀). The bond is said to be polar—having a positive pole 
and a negative pole. A polar covalent bond is intermediate in nature between a pure 
covalent bond and an ionic bond. In fact, the categories of pure covalent and ionic are 
really two extremes within a broad continuum. Most covalent bonds between dissimilar 
atoms are actually polar covalent—somewhere between the two extremes.

9.6  Electronegativity and Bond Polarity	
397
Electronegativity
The ability of an atom to attract electrons to itself in a chemical bond (which results in 
polar and ionic bonds) is called electronegativity. We say that fluorine is more electro-
negative than hydrogen because it takes a greater share of the electron density in HF.
The American chemist Linus Pauling (1901–1994) quantified electronegativity in his 
classic book, The Nature of the Chemical Bond. Pauling compared the bond energy—the 
energy required to break a bond—of a heteronuclear diatomic molecule such as HF with 
the bond energies of its homonuclear counterparts, in this case H2 and F2. The bond ener-
gies of H2 and F2 are 436 kJ>mol and 155 kJ>mol, respectively. Pauling reasoned that if the 
HF bond were purely covalent—that is, if the electrons were shared exactly equally—the 
bond energy of HF should simply be an average of the bond energies of H2 and F2, which 
would be 296 kJ>mol. However, the bond energy of HF is experimentally measured to be 
565 kJ>mol. Pauling suggested that the additional bond energy was due to the ionic char-
acter of the bond. Based on many such comparisons of bond energies, and by arbitrarily 
assigning an electronegativity of 4.0 to fluorine (the most electronegative element on the 
periodic table), Pauling developed the electronegativity values shown in Figure 9.8▼.
For main-group elements, notice the following periodic trends in electronegativity 
from Figure 9.8:
• Electronegativity generally increases across a period in the periodic table.
• Electronegativity generally decreases down a column in the periodic table.
• Fluorine is the most electronegative element.
• Francium is the least electronegative element (sometimes called the most 
­electropositive).

Trends in Electronegativity

generally increases as we move 
across a row in the periodic table 
and decreases as we move down a 
column.
Pauling’s “average” bond energy 
was actually calculated a little bit 
differently than the normal average 
shown here. He took the square root 
of the product of the bond energies of 
the homonuclear counterparts as the 
“average.”
We cover the concept of bond energy 
in more detail in Section 9.10.

Chapter 9  Chemical Bonding I: The Lewis Model
The periodic trends in electronegativity are consistent with other periodic trends we 
have seen. In general, electronegativity is inversely related to atomic size—the larger the 
atom, the less ability it has to attract electrons to itself in a chemical bond.

Bond Polarity, Dipole Moment, and Percent  
Ionic Character
The degree of polarity in a chemical bond depends on the electronegativity difference 
(sometimes abbreviated ∆EN) between the two bonding atoms. The greater the electro-
negativity difference, the more polar the bond. If two atoms with identical electronega-
tivities form a covalent bond, they share the electrons equally, and the bond is purely 
covalent or nonpolar. For example, the chlorine molecule, composed of two chlorine 
atoms (which necessarily have identical electronegativities), has a covalent bond in 
which electrons are evenly shared:
Cl
Cl
If there is a large electronegativity difference between the two atoms in a bond, such 
as normally occurs between a metal and a nonmetal, the electron from the metal is 
almost completely transferred to the nonmetal, and the bond is ionic. For example, 
sodium and chlorine form an ionic bond:
Na+
Cl−
If there is an intermediate electronegativity difference between the two atoms, such 
as between two different nonmetals, then the bond is polar covalent. For example, HCl 
has a polar covalent bond:
H
Cl
δ−
δ+
Although all attempts to divide the bond polarity continuum into specific regions 
are necessarily arbitrary, it is helpful to classify bonds as covalent, polar covalent, and 
ionic, based on the electronegativity difference between the bonding atoms as shown in 
Table 9.1 and Figure 9.9▶.

We quantify the polarity of a bond by the size of its dipole moment. A dipole 
moment (m) occurs any time there is a separation of positive and negative charge. The 
magnitude of a dipole moment created by separating two particles of equal but opposite 
charges of magnitude q by a distance r is given by the equation:
	
m = qr

We can get a sense for the dipole moment of a completely ionic bond by calculating the 
dipole moment that results from separating a proton and an electron (q = 1.6 * 10 - 19 C) 
by a distance of r = 130 pm (the approximate length of a short chemical bond):
 m = qr
 = (1.6 * 10 - 19 C)(130 * 10 - 12 m)
 = 2.1 * 10 - 29 C # m
 = 6.2 D
The debye (D) is the unit commonly used for reporting dipole 
moments (1 D =  3.34 * 10 - 30 C # m). Based on this calculation, we 
would expect the dipole moment of completely ionic bonds with bond 
lengths close to 130 pm to be about 6 D. The smaller the magnitude of 
the charge separation, and the smaller the distance between the charges, 
the smaller the dipole moment. Table 9.2 lists the dipole moments of 
several molecules along with the electronegativity differences of their 
atoms.
By comparing the actual dipole moment of a bond to what the 
dipole moment would be if the electron were completely transferred 
from one atom to the other, we can get a sense of the degree to which the electron is 
transferred (or the degree to which the bond is ionic). The percent ionic character is 
the ratio of a bond’s actual dipole moment to the dipole moment it would have if the 
electron were completely transferred from one atom to the other, multiplied by 100%:
Percent ionic character =
measured dipole moment of bond
dipole moment if electron were completely transferred * 100%
For example, suppose a diatomic molecule with a bond length of 130 pm has a 
dipole moment of 3.5 D. We previously calculated that separating a proton and an elec-
tron by 130 pm results in a dipole moment of 6.2 D. Therefore, the percent ionic charac-
ter of the bond is 56%:
 Percent ionic character = 3.5 D 
6.2 D * 100%
 = 56%
A bond in which an electron is completely transferred from one 
atom to another would have 100% ionic character (although even the 
most ionic bonds do not reach this ideal). Figure 9.10▶ shows the per-
cent ionic character of a number of diatomic gas-phase molecules 
plotted against the electronegativity difference between the bonding 
atoms. As expected, the percent ionic character generally increases as 
the electronegativity difference increases. However, as we can see, no 
bond is 100% ionic. In general, bonds with greater than 50% ionic 
character are referred to as ionic bonds.

Lewis Structures of Molecular 
Compounds and Polyatomic Ions
We now turn to the basic sequence of steps involved in actually writing Lewis structures 
for given combinations of atoms.
Writing Lewis Structures for Molecular Compounds
To write a Lewis structure for a molecular compound, follow these steps:
1.	 Write the correct skeletal structure for the molecule.  The Lewis structure of a 
molecule must have the atoms in the correct positions. For example, you could not 
write a Lewis structure for water if you started with the hydrogen atoms next to each 
other and the oxygen atom at the end (H H O). In nature, oxygen is the central atom and 
the hydrogen atoms are terminal (at the ends). The correct skeletal structure is H O H. 
The only way to determine the skeletal structure of a molecule with absolute certainty is 
to examine its structure experimentally. However, you can write likely skeletal structures 
by remembering two guidelines. First, hydrogen atoms are always terminal. Hydrogen does 
not ordinarily occur as a central atom because central atoms must form at least two 
bonds, and hydrogen, which has only a single valence electron to share and requires 
only a duet, can form just one bond. Second, put the more electronegative elements in termi-
nal positions and the less electronegative elements (other than hydrogen) in the central 
position. Later in this section, you will learn how to distinguish between competing 
skeletal structures by applying the concept of formal charge.
2.	 Calculate the total number of electrons for the Lewis structure by sum-
ming the valence electrons of each atom in the molecule.  Remember that 
the number of valence electrons for any main-group element is equal to its group num-
ber in the periodic table. If you are writing a Lewis structure for a polyatomic ion, you must 
consider the charge of the ion when calculating the total number of electrons. Add one electron 
for each negative charge and subtract one electron for each positive charge. Don’t worry 
about which electron comes from which atom—only the total number is important.
Often, chemical formulas provide 
clues to how the atoms are bonded 
together. For example, CH3oH 
indicates that three hydrogen atoms 
and the oxygen atom are bonded 
to the carbon atom, but the fourth 
hydrogen atom is bonded to the 
oxygen atom.
There are a few exceptions to this 
rule, such as diborane (B2H6), which 
contains bridging hydrogens, but these 
are rare and cannot be adequately 
addressed by the Lewis model.
Example 9.3	
Classifying Bonds as Pure Covalent, Polar Covalent, or Ionic
Classify the bond formed between each pair of atoms as covalent, polar covalent, or ionic.
(a)	 Sr and F	
(b)	 N and Cl	
(c)	 N and O
Solution
(a)	 In Figure 9.8, find the electronegativity of Sr (1.0) and of F (4.0). The electronegativity difference (∆EN) is 
∆EN = 4.0 - 1.0 = 3.0. Using Table 9.1, classify this bond as ionic.
(b)	 In Figure 9.8, find the electronegativity of N (3.0) and of Cl (3.0). The electronegativity difference (∆EN) is 
∆EN = 3.0 - 3.0 = 0. Using Table 9.1, classify this bond as covalent.
(c)	 In Figure 9.8, find the electronegativity of N (3.0) and of O (3.5). The electronegativity difference (∆EN) is 
∆EN = 3.5 - 3.0 = 0.5. Using Table 9.1, classify this bond as polar covalent.

Sometimes distributing all the 
remaining electrons to the central 
atom results in more than an octet. 
This is called an expanded octet, 
which we discuss in Section 9.9.
3.	 Distribute the electrons among the atoms, giving octets (or duets in the 
case of hydrogen) to as many atoms as possible.  Begin by placing two elec-
trons between every two atoms. These represent the minimum number of bonding 
electrons. Then distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs, first to terminal 
atoms and then to the central atom, giving octets (or duets for hydrogen) to as many 
atoms as possible.
4.	 If any atoms lack an octet, form double or triple bonds as necessary to 
give them octets.  Do this by moving lone electron pairs from terminal atoms 
into the bonding region with the central atom.
In the left column that follows, there is an abbreviated version of the procedure for 
writing Lewis structures; the center and right columns feature two examples of applying 
the procedure.

Resonance and Formal Charge
We need two additional concepts to write the best possible Lewis structures for a large 
number of compounds. The concepts are resonance, which is relevant when two or more 
valid Lewis structures can be drawn for the same compound, and formal charge, an electron 
bookkeeping system that allows us to discriminate between alternative Lewis structures.
Resonance
For some molecules, we can write more than one valid Lewis structure. For example, 
consider writing a Lewis structure for O3. The following two Lewis structures, with the 
double bond on alternate sides, are equally correct:
≠O¶ “ O¶ ¬ O÷≠ ≠O÷ ¬ O¶ “ O¶≠
In cases such as this—where there are two or more valid Lewis structures for the same 
molecule—we find that, in nature, the molecule is an average of the two  
Lewis structures. Both of the two Lewis structures for O3 predict that O3 contains two 
Resonance and Formal Charge

	
9.8  Resonance and Formal Charge	
403
different bonds (one double bond and one single bond). However, when we experi-
mentally examine the structure of O3, we find that the bonds in the O3 molecule are 
equivalent and each is intermediate in strength and length between a double bond 
and single bond. We account for this by representing the molecule with both struc-
tures, called resonance structures, with a double-headed arrow between them:
O
O
O
O
O
O
A resonance structure is one of two or more Lewis structures that have the 
same skeletal formula (the atoms are in the same locations), but different electron 
arrangements. The actual structure of the molecule is intermediate between the two 
(or more) resonance structures and is called a resonance hybrid. The term hybrid 
comes from breeding and means the offspring of two animals or plants of different 
varieties or breeds. If we breed a Labrador retriever with a German shepherd, we get a 
hybrid that is intermediate between the two breeds (Figure 9.11(a)▼). Similarly, the 
actual structure of a resonance hybrid is intermediate between the two (or more) res-
onance structures (Figure 9.11(b)▼). The only structure that actually exists is the 
hybrid structure—the individual resonance structures do not exist and are merely a 
way to describe the actual structure. Notice that the actual structure of ozone has 
two equivalent bonds and a bent geometry (we discuss molecular geometries in 
Chapter 10).

▲ Figure 9.11  Hybridization  Just as the offspring of two different dog breeds is a 
hybrid that is intermediate between the two breeds (a), the structure of a resonance hybrid is

The concept of resonance is an adaptation of the Lewis model that helps account 
for the complexity of actual molecules. In the Lewis model, electrons are localized either 
on one atom (lone pair) or between atoms (bonding pair). However, in nature, the elec-
trons in molecules are often delocalized over several atoms or bonds. The delocalization 
of electrons lowers their energy; it stabilizes them (for reasons that are beyond the scope 
of this book). Resonance depicts two or more structures with the electrons in different 
places in an attempt to more accurately reflect the delocalization of electrons. In the real 
hybrid structure, an average between the resonance structures, the electrons are more 
spread out (or delocalized) than in any of the resonance structures. The resulting stabili-
zation of the electrons (that is, the lowering of their potential energy due to delocaliza-
tion) is sometimes called resonance stabilization. Resonance stabilization makes an 
important contribution to the stability of many molecules.

For Practice 9.7  Write a Lewis structure for the NO2

In the examples of resonance hybrids that we have examined so far, the contributing 
structures have been equivalent (or equally valid) Lewis structures. In these cases, the true 
structure is an equally weighted average of the resonance structures. In some cases, how-
ever, we can write resonance structures that are not equivalent. For reasons that we cover in 
the material that follows—such as formal charge—one resonance structure may be some-
what better than another. In such cases, the true structure is still an average of the reso-
nance structures, but the better resonance structure contributes more to the true structure. 
In other words, multiple nonequivalent resonance structures may be weighted differently 
in their contributions to the true overall structure of a molecule (see Example 9.8).
Formal Charge
Formal charge is a fictitious charge assigned to each atom in a Lewis structure that helps 
us to distinguish among competing Lewis structures. The formal charge of an atom

in a Lewis structure is the charge it would have if all bonding electrons were shared equally 
between the bonded atoms. In other words, formal charge is the calculated charge for an 
atom if we completely ignore the effects of electronegativity. For example, we know that 
because fluorine is more electronegative than hydrogen, HF has a dipole moment—the 
hydrogen atom has a slight positive charge and the fluorine atom has a slight nega-
tive charge. However, the formal charges of hydrogen and fluorine in HF (the calculated 
charges if we ignore their differences in electronegativity) are both zero:
F
H
Formal charge = 0
Formal charge = 0
We can calculate the formal charge on any atom as the difference between the num-
ber of valence electrons in the atom and the number of electrons that it “owns” in a 
Lewis structure. An atom in a Lewis structure can be thought of as “owning” all of its 
nonbonding electrons and one-half of its bonding electrons:
Formal charge = number of valence electrons -
(number of nonbonding electrons + 1
2 number of bonding electrons)
So the formal charge of hydrogen in HF is 0:
= 1 − [0 + (2)] = 0

Similarly, we calculate the formal charge of fluorine in HF as 0:
Formal charge = 7 − [6 +    (2)] = 0

The concept of formal charge is useful because it can help us distinguish between 
competing skeletal structures or competing resonance structures. In general, when we 
calculate formal charges, these four rules apply:
1.	 The sum of all formal charges in a neutral molecule must be zero.
2.	 The sum of all formal charges in an ion must equal the charge of the ion.
3.	 Small (or zero) formal charges on individual atoms are better than large ones.
4.	 When formal charge cannot be avoided, negative formal charge should reside on 
the most electronegative atom.
We can use formal charge to determine which of the competing skeletal structures 
for hydrogen cyanide shown here is best (or most stable). Notice that both skeletal struc-
tures satisfy the octet rule equally. The formal charge of each atom in the structure is 
calculated below it.

Chapter 9  Chemical Bonding I: The Lewis Model
As required, the sum of the formal charges for each of these structures is zero (as it always 
must be for neutral molecules). However, structure B has formal charges on both the N 
atom and the C atom, while structure A has no formal charges on any atom. Further-
more, in structure B, the negative formal charge is not on the most electronegative ele-
ment (nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon). Consequently, structure A is the 
better skeletal structure. Since atoms in the middle of a molecule tend to have more 
bonding electrons and fewer nonbonding electrons, they also tend to have more posi-
tive formal charges. Consequently, the best skeletal structure usually has the least elec-
tronegative atom in the central position, as we learned in step 1 of our procedure for 
writing Lewis structures.

The sum of all formal charges for each structure is -1, as it should be for a 1- ion. Structures A and B have the fewest 
non-zero formal charges and are preferred over structure C. Structure A is preferable to B because it has the negative 
­formal charge on the more electronegative atom. You therefore expect structure A to make the biggest contribution to the 
­resonance forms of the cyanate ion.

Exceptions to the Octet Rule:  
Odd-Electron Species, Incomplete 
Octets, and Expanded Octets
The octet rule in the Lewis model has some exceptions, which we examine in this sec-
tion of the chapter. They include (1) odd-electron species, molecules or ions with an odd 
number of electrons; (2) incomplete octets, molecules or ions with fewer than eight electrons 
around an atom; and (3) expanded octets, molecules or ions with more than eight electrons 
around an atom.

408	
Chapter 9  Chemical Bonding I: The Lewis Model
Odd-Electron Species
Molecules and ions with an odd number of electrons in their Lewis structures are free 
radicals (or simply radicals). For example, nitrogen monoxide—a pollutant found in 
motor vehicle exhaust—has 11 electrons. If we try to write a Lewis structure for nitrogen 
monoxide, we can’t achieve octets for both atoms:
≠Nª≠≠O¶≠ or ≠Nª “ O¶≠
The nitrogen atom in nitrogen monoxide does not have an octet, so this Lewis structure 
does not satisfy the octet rule. Yet, nitrogen monoxide exists, especially in polluted air. 
Why? As with any simple theory, the Lewis model is not sophisticated enough to handle 
every single case. It is impossible to write good Lewis structures for free radicals; never-
theless, some of these molecules exist in nature. Perhaps it is a testament to the Lewis 
model, however, that relatively few such molecules exist and that, in general, they tend to 
be somewhat unstable and reactive. NO, for example, reacts with oxygen in the air to 
form NO2, another odd-electron molecule represented with the following 17-electron 
resonance structures:
≠O¶ “ ªN¬ O÷≠· ≠O÷ ¬ Nª “ O¶≠
In turn, NO2 reacts with water to form nitric acid (a component of acid rain) and also 
reacts with other atmospheric pollutants to form peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN), an active 
component of photochemical smog. For free radicals, such as NO and NO2, we simply 
write the best Lewis structure that we can.
The unpaired electron in nitrogen 
monoxide is put on the nitrogen rather 
than the oxygen in order to minimize 
formal charges.

(a)	 CO
(b)	 CO2

Incomplete Octets
Another significant exception to the octet rule involves elements that tend to form 
incomplete octets. The most important of these is boron, which forms compounds 
with only six electrons around B, rather than eight. For example, BF3 and BH3 lack 
an octet for B.
F B F

Beryllium compounds, such as BeH2, also have incomplete octets.
You might be wondering why we don’t just form double bonds to increase the num-
ber of electrons around B. For BH3, we can’t because there are no additional electrons to 
move into the bonding region. For BF3, however, we could attempt to give B an octet by 
moving a lone pair from an F atom into the bonding region with B:

Chemistry in the Environment | Free Radicals and the Atmospheric Vacuum Cleaner

ree radicals play a key role in much of the chemistry of 
the atmosphere. The free radical that is most important 
to atmospheric reactions is the hydroxyl radical:
≠ªo• ¬ H
natural gas that is released into the atmosphere as you light 
a kitchen stove? Hydrocarbons released into the atmosphere 
are converted to Co2 and H2o in a series of steps initiated 
by the hydroxyl free radical. Consider the following represen-
tative reaction of methane, the main hydrocarbon in natural 
gas:
CH4 + 5 o2 + No # +  2 # oH ¡
uV light
Co2 + H2o + No2 # + 4 Hoo #
Notice the similarity between this reaction and the direct 
combustion (or burning) of methane:
CH4 + 2 o2 ¡ Co2 + 2 H2o
As you can see, the free radical reaction initiates a slow 
“burning” of CH4 in a series of steps that produces carbon 
dioxide and water and some additional free radicals. The 
hydroxyl radical initiates similar reactions with other pollut-
ants as well as undesirable naturally occurring atmospheric 
gases. Without the hydroxyl free radical—sometimes called 
the atmospheric vacuum cleaner—our atmosphere would be 
a much dirtier place.
NO2(g)
▲ No2(g) is a pollutant found in urban air.
Many free radical structures are abbreviated by writing a 
single dot with the formula. Thus, the hydroxyl radical is often 
abbreviated as:
–oH
In the atmosphere, the hydroxyl radical forms when excited 
oxygen atoms—formed from the photodecomposition of 
ozone—react with water vapor:
o3 ¡
uV light o2 + o*
o* + H2o ¡ 2 # oH
The * next to the O indicates that the oxygen atom has 
excess energy.
The resulting hydroxyl radical reacts with a wide variety of 
molecules from both natural sources and from air pollution 
that are present in the atmosphere. For example, the hydroxyl 
radical reacts with carbon monoxide, an atmospheric pollut-
ant that we first encountered in Chapter 1, in the following 
two-step process:
Co + #  oH ¡ HoCo #
HoCo # + o2 ¡ Co2 + Hoo #
We can see from this reaction that the hydroxyl radical con-
verts toxic CO into relatively nontoxic Co2.
The Hoo #  free radical generated by the second reaction 
is converted back into the hydroxyl radical when it reacts with 
other atmospheric substances, and the process repeats  
itself. Therefore, a single hydroxyl radical can convert a lot of 
CO into Co2.
Do you ever wonder what happens to the hydrocarbons 
you accidentally spill when filling a car’s gas tank or to the 
▲ Hydrocarbons such as octane evaporate into the atmosphere 
when a motor vehicle is fueled. What happens to them?

Chapter 9  Chemical Bonding I: The Lewis Model
This Lewis structure has octets for all atoms, including boron. However, when we assign 
formal charges to this structure, we get a negative formal charge on B and a positive for-
mal charge on F:
F
B
F
F
+1
−1
0
0
The positive formal charge on fluorine—the most electronegative element in the 
periodic table—makes this an unfavorable structure. This leaves us with some questions. 
Do we complete the octet on B at the expense of giving fluorine a positive formal charge? 
Or do we leave B without an octet in order to avoid the positive formal charge on fluo-
rine? The answers to these kinds of questions are not always clear because we are push-
ing the limits of the Lewis model. In the case of boron, we usually accept the incomplete 
octet as the better Lewis structure. However, doing so does not rule out the possibility 
that the double-bonded Lewis structure might be a minor contributing resonance struc-
ture. The ultimate answers to these kinds of questions must be determined from experi-
ments. Experimental measurements of the B¬ F bond length in BF3 suggest that the 
bond may be slightly shorter than expected for a single B¬ F bond, indicating that it 
may indeed have a small amount of double-bond character.
BF3 can complete its octet in another way—via a chemical reaction. The Lewis 
model predicts that BF3 might react in ways that would complete its octet, and indeed it 
does. For example, BF3 reacts with NH3 as follows:

The product has complete octets for all atoms in the structure.
Expanded Octets
Elements in the third row of the periodic table and beyond often exhibit expanded octets 
of up to 12 (and occasionally 14) electrons. Consider the Lewis structures of arsenic pen-
tafluoride and sulfur hexafluoride:
F
As
F
F
F
F

S
F

In AsF5 arsenic has an expanded octet of 10 electrons, and in SF6 sulfur has an expanded 
octet of 12 electrons. Both of these compounds exist and are stable. In third-period ele-
ments and beyond, 10- and 12-electron expanded octets are common because the d 
orbitals in these elements are energetically accessible (they are not much higher in 
energy than the orbitals occupied by the valence electrons) and can accommodate the 
extra electrons (see Section 8.3). Expanded octets never occur in second-period elements.
In some Lewis structures, we must decide whether or not to expand an octet in order 
to lower formal charge. For example, consider the Lewis structure of H2SO4:
S

Notice that two of the oxygen atoms have a -1 formal charge and that sulfur has a +2

nitrogen atom provides both of the 
electrons. This kind of bond is called 
a coordinate covalent bond, which we 
discuss in Chapter 25.

Which of these two Lewis structures for H2SO4 is better? Again, the answer is not straight-
forward. Experiments show that the sulfur–oxygen bond lengths in the two sulfur–oxy-
gen bonds without the hydrogen atoms are shorter than expected for sulfur–oxygen 
single bonds, indicating that the double-bonded Lewis structure plays an important role 
in describing the bonding in H2SO4. In general, we expand octets in third-row (or 
beyond) elements in order to lower formal charge. However, we should never expand the 
octets of second-row elements. Second-row elements do not have energetically accessi-
ble d orbitals and therefore never exhibit expanded octets.

In Chapter 6, we discussed how to calculate the standard enthalpy change for a chemical 
reaction (∆H °rxn) from tabulated standard enthalpies of formation. However, sometimes 
we may not easily find standard enthalpies of formation for all of the reactants and prod-
ucts of a reaction. In such cases, we can use individual bond energies to estimate enthalpy

Chapter 9  Chemical Bonding I: The Lewis Model
changes of reaction. In this section, we examine the concept of bond energy and how we 
can use bond energies to calculate enthalpy changes of reaction. We also look at average 
bond lengths for a number of commonly encountered bonds.
Bond Energy
The bond energy of a chemical bond is the energy required to break 1 mole of the bonds 
in the gas phase. For example, the bond energy of the Cl ¬ Cl bond in Cl2 is 243 kJ>mol.
Cl2(g) ¡ 2 Cl(g)  ∆H = 243 kJ
The bond energy of HCl is 431 kJ>mol.
HCl(g) ¡ H(g) + Cl(g)  ∆H = 431 kJ
Bond energies are always positive because it always takes energy to break a bond. We 
say that the HCl bond is stronger than the Cl2 bond because it requires more energy to 
break it. In general, compounds with stronger bonds tend to be more chemically stable, 
and therefore less chemically reactive, than compounds with weaker bonds. The triple 
bond in N2 has a bond energy of 946 kJ>mol.
N2(g) ¡ N(g) + N(g)  ∆H = 946 kJ
It is a very strong and stable bond, which explains nitrogen’s relative inertness.
The bond energy of a particular bond in a polyatomic molecule is a little more diffi-
cult to determine because a particular type of bond can have different bond energies in 
different molecules. For example, consider the C¬ H bond. In CH4, the energy required 
to break one C¬ H bond is 438 kJ>mol.
H3C¬ H(g) ¡ H3C(g) + H(g)  ∆H = 438 kJ
However, the energy required to break a C¬ H bond in other molecules varies slightly, 
as shown here:
 F3C¬ H(g) ¡ F3C(g) + H(g)  ∆H = 446 kJ
 Br3C¬ H(g) ¡ Br3C(g) + H(g)  ∆H = 402 kJ
 Cl3C¬ H(g) ¡ Cl3C(g) + H(g)  ∆H = 401 kJ
We can calculate an average bond 
energy for a chemical bond, which is an 
average of the bond energies for that bond 
in a large number of compounds. For the 
four compounds just discussed, we calcu-
late an average C¬ H bond energy of 
422 kJ>mol. Table 9.3 lists average bond 
energies for a number of common chemi-
cal bonds averaged over a large number of 
compounds. Notice that the C¬ H bond 
energy listed is 414 kJ>mol, which is not 
too different from the value we calculated 
from our limited number of compounds. 
Notice also that bond energies depend, 
not only on the kind of atoms involved in 
the bond, but also on the type of bond: 
single, double, or triple. In general, for a 
given pair of atoms, triple bonds are stron-
ger than double bonds, which are, in turn, 
stronger than single bonds. For example, 
consider the bond energies of carbon–car-
bon triple, double, and single bonds listed 
in Table 9.3.
Bond energy is also called bond 
enthalpy or bond dissociation energy.

Using Average Bond Energies to Estimate Enthalpy 
Changes for Reactions
We can use average bond energies to estimate the enthalpy change of a reaction. For 
example, consider the reaction between methane and chlorine:
H3C¬ H(g) + Cl ¬ Cl(g) ¡ H3C¬ Cl(g) + H ¬ Cl(g)
We can imagine this reaction occurring by the breaking of a C¬ H bond and a Cl ¬ Cl 
bond and the forming of a C¬ Cl bond and an H ¬ Cl bond. We know that when bonds 
break, the process is endothermic (positive bond energy) and when bonds form, the pro-
cess is exothermic (negative bond energy). So we can calculate the overall enthalpy 
change as a sum of the enthalpy changes associated with breaking the required bonds in 
the reactants and forming the required bonds in the products, as shown in Figure 9.12▼.
H3C¬ H(g) + Cl ¬ Cl(g) ¡ H3C¬ Cl(g) + H ¬ Cl(g)

Sum (Σ)∆H’s bonds broken: +657 kJ
Sum (Σ)∆H’s bonds formed: -770 kJ
 ∆Hrxn = Σ(∆H’s bonds broken) + Σ(∆H’s bonds formed) 
 = +657 kJ - 770 kJ
 = -113 kJ
We find that ∆Hrxn = -113 kJ. Calculating ∆H °rxn from tabulated enthalpies of 
­formation—the method we learned in Chapter 6—gives ∆H °rxn = -101 kJ, fairly close to 
the value we obtained from average bond energies.
In general, we can calculate ∆Hrxn from average bond energies by summing the 
changes in enthalpy for all of the bonds that are broken and adding the sum of the 
enthalpy changes for all of the bonds that are formed. Remember that ∆H is positive for 
breaking bonds and negative for forming them:
Positive
∆Hrxn =
(∆H’s bonds broken)
 (∆H’s bonds formed)
+
Negative
As we can see from the equation:
• A reaction is exothermic when weak 
bonds break and strong bonds form.
• A reaction is endothermic when 
strong bonds break and weak bonds 
form.
Scientists 
sometimes 
say 
that 
“energy is stored in chemical bonds or in 
a chemical compound,” which may make 
it sound as if breaking the bonds in the 
compound releases energy. For example, 
in biology we often hear that energy is 
stored in glucose or in ATP. However, 
breaking a chemical bond always requires 
energy. When we say that energy is stored 
in a compound, or that a compound is 
energy rich, we mean that the compound 
can undergo a reaction in which weak 
bonds break and strong bonds form, 
thereby releasing energy in the overall 
process. However, it is always the forming 
of chemical bonds that releases energy.

Bond Energies and 𝚫Hrxn  The reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to 
form water is highly exothermic. Which statement is true of the energies of the bonds 
that break and form during the reaction?
(a)	 The energy needed to break the required bonds is greater than the energy 
­released when the new bonds form.
(b)	 The energy needed to break the required bonds is less than the energy released 
when the new bonds form.
(c)	 The energy needed to break the required bonds is about the same as the energy 
released when the new bonds form.

Calculating 𝚫Hrxn from Bond Energies
Hydrogen gas, a potential fuel, can be made by the reaction of methane gas and steam.

Find ∆Hrxn by summing the results of the previous 
two steps.
∆Hrxn = Σ(∆H’s bonds broken) + Σ(∆H’s bonds formed)

Bond Lengths
Just as we can tabulate average bond energies, which represent the average energy of 
a bond between two particular atoms in a large number of compounds, we can tabu-
late average bond lengths (Table 9.4). The average bond length represents the average

length of a bond between two particular atoms in a large number of compounds. Like 
bond energies, bond lengths depend not only on the kind of atoms involved in the 
bond, but also on the type of bond: single, double, or triple. In general, for a particular 
pair of atoms, triple bonds are shorter than double bonds, which are in turn shorter 
than single bonds. For example, consider the bond lengths (shown here with bond 
strengths) of carbon–carbon triple, double, and single bonds:
Bond

Bond Strength (kJ, mol)
C ‚C
120 pm
837 kJ>mol
C “C
134 pm
611 kJ>mol
C ¬C

Notice that, as the bond gets longer, it also becomes weaker. This relationship 
between the length of a bond and the strength of a bond does not necessarily hold true 
for all bonds. Consider the following series of nitrogen–halogen single bonds:

Although the bonds generally get weaker as they get longer, the trend is not a smooth one.
	 9.11	 Bonding in Metals: The Electron  
Sea Model
So far, we have explored simple models for bonding between a metal and a nonmetal 
(ionic bonding) and for bonding between two nonmetals (covalent bonding). We have 
seen how these models account for and predict the properties of ionic and molecular 
compounds. The last type of bonding that we examine in this chapter is metallic bond-
ing, which occurs between metals.
As we have already discussed, metals have a tendency to lose electrons, which means 
that they have relatively low ionization energies. When metal atoms bond together to 
form a solid lattice, each metal atom donates one or more electrons to an electron sea. For 
example, we can think of sodium metal as an array of positively charged Na + ions 
immersed in a sea of negatively charged electrons (e -), as shown in Figure 9.13▶.

zone is a form of oxygen in which three oxygen atoms 
bond together. Its Lewis structure consists of the follow-
ing resonance structures:
O
O
O
O
O
O
Compare the Lewis structure of ozone to the Lewis structure 
of o2:
≠o¶ “ o¶≠
Since double bonds are stronger and shorter than single 
bonds, o2 must have a stronger bond because it is a double 
bond. o3, on the other hand, has bonds that are intermedi-
ate between single and double, which are weaker bonds. The 
effects of this are significant. As we discussed in Section 
6.10, o3 absorbs harmful ultraviolet light entering Earth’s 
atmosphere. Ozone is ideally suited to do this because 
photons at wavelengths of 280–320 nm (the most harmful 
components of sunlight) are just strong enough to break the 
bonds in the o3 molecule:
≠o¶ “ o¶ ¬ o÷≠+ uV light ¡ ≠o¶ “ o¶≠+ –ºo¶≠
In this process, the photon is absorbed. o2 and O then 
­recombine to re-form o3, which can in turn absorb more UV 
light. The same wavelengths of UV light, however, do not have 
sufficient energy to break the stronger double bond of o2. No 
other molecules in our atmosphere can do the job that ozone 
does. Consequently, we should continue, and even strength-
en, the ban on ozone-depleting compounds.

of light has just the right amount of energy to break this bond?

▲ Ozone protects life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet light.
Each sodium atom donates its one valence electron to the “sea” and becomes a sodium 
ion. The sodium cations are held together by their attraction to the sea of electrons.
Although the electron sea model is simple, it accounts for many of the properties of 
metals. For example, metals conduct electricity because—in contrast to ionic solids, in 
which electrons are localized on an ion—the electrons in a metal are free to move. The 
movement or flow of electrons in response to an electric potential (or voltage) is an elec-
tric current. Metals are also excellent conductors of heat, again because of the highly 
mobile electrons, which help to disperse thermal energy throughout the metal.
The electron sea model also accounts for the malleability of metals (their capacity to 
be pounded into sheets) and the ductility of metals (their capacity to be drawn into 
wires). Since there are no localized or specific “bonds” in a metal, we can deform it rela-
tively easily by forcing the metal ions to slide past one another. The electron sea easily 
accommodates deformations by flowing into the new shape.
▲ Copper can easily be drawn 
into fine strands like those used in 
household electrical cords.

Key Concepts
Bonding Models and AIDS Drugs (9.1)
▶
▶Theories that predict how and why atoms bond together are cen-
tral to chemistry because they explain compound stability and 
molecule shape.
▶
▶Bonding theories have been useful in combating HIV because 
they help in the design of molecules that bind to the active site of 
a protein crucial for the development of AIDS.
Types of Chemical Bonds (9.2)
▶
▶We divide chemical bonds into three general types: ionic bonds, 
which occur between a metal and a nonmetal; covalent bonds, 
which occur between two nonmetals; and metallic bonds, which 
occur within metals.
▶
▶In an ionic bond, an electron transfers from the metal to the 
nonmetal and the resultant ions attract each other by coulombic 
forces.
▶
▶In a covalent bond, nonmetals share electrons that interact with 
the nuclei of both atoms via coulombic forces, holding the atoms 
together.
▶
▶In a metallic bond, the atoms form a lattice in which each metal 
loses electrons to an “electron sea.” The attraction of the positively 
charged metal ions to the electron sea holds the metal together.
The Lewis Model and Electron Dots (9.3)
▶
▶In the Lewis model, chemical bonds form when atoms transfer 
(ionic bonding) or share (covalent bonding) valence electrons to 
attain noble gas electron configurations.
▶
▶The Lewis model represents valence electrons as dots surrounding 
the symbol for an element. When two or more elements bond to-
gether, the dots are transferred or shared so that every atom has 
eight dots, an octet (or two dots, a duet, in the case of hydrogen).
Ionic Lewis Structures and Lattice Energy (9.4)
▶
▶In an ionic Lewis structure involving main-group metals, the met-
al transfers its valence electrons (dots) to the nonmetal.
▶
▶The formation of most ionic compounds is exothermic because of 
lattice energy, the energy released when metal cations and nonmetal 
anions coalesce to form the solid. The smaller the radius of the ions 
and the greater their charge, the more exothermic the lattice energy.
Use bond energies to determine which halogen produces 
the most exothermic halogenation reaction with ethene. 
The C ¬ F, C ¬ Br, and C ¬ I bond energies are 552 kJ>mol, 
280 kJ>mol, and 209 kJ>mol, respectively. Look up all other 
necessary bond energies in Table 9.3.
a)	 fluorine	 	
	
b)	 chlorine	
c)	 bromine	 	
	
d)	 iodine

Covalent Lewis Structures, Electronegativity,  
and Polarity (9.5, 9.6, 9.7)
▶
▶In a covalent Lewis structure, neighboring atoms share valence 
electrons to attain octets (or duets).
▶
▶A single shared electron pair constitutes a single bond, while two 
or three shared pairs constitute double or triple bonds, respec-
tively.
▶
▶The shared electrons in a covalent bond are not always equally 
shared; when two dissimilar nonmetals form a covalent bond, the 
electron density is greater on the more electronegative element. 
The result is a polar bond, in which one element has a partial posi-
tive charge and the other a partial negative charge.
▶
▶Electronegativity—the ability of an atom to attract electrons to it-
self in chemical bonding—increases as we move to the right across 
a period in the periodic table and decreases as we move down a 
column.
▶
▶Elements with very dissimilar electronegativities form ionic 
bonds, those with very similar electronegativities form nonpolar 
covalent bonds, and those with intermediate electronegativity 
differences form polar covalent bonds.
Resonance and Formal Charge (9.8)
▶
▶We can best represent some molecules not by a single Lewis struc-
ture, but by two or more resonance structures. The actual structure 
of these molecules is a resonance hybrid: a combination or average 
of the contributing structures.
▶
▶The formal charge of an atom in a Lewis structure is the charge 
the atom would have if all bonding electrons were shared equally 
between bonding atoms.
▶
▶In general, the best Lewis structures have the fewest atoms with 
formal charge, and any negative formal charges are on the most 
electronegative atom.
Exceptions to the Octet Rule (9.9)
▶
▶Although the octet rule normally applies when we draw Lewis 
structures, some exceptions occur.
▶
▶These exceptions include odd-electron species, which necessarily 
have Lewis structures with only seven electrons around an atom. 
Such molecules, called free radicals, tend to be unstable and chem-
ically reactive.
▶
▶Other exceptions to the octet rule include molecules with in-
complete octets—usually totaling six electrons (especially im-
portant in compounds containing boron)—and molecules with 
expanded octets—usually 10 or 12 electrons (which can occur in 
compounds containing elements from the third row of the pe-
riodic table and below). Expanded octets never occur in second-
period elements.
Bond Energies and Bond Lengths (9.10)
▶
▶The bond energy of a chemical bond is the energy required to 
break one mole of the bonds in the gas phase.
▶
▶Average bond energies for a number of different bonds are tabu-
lated, and we can use them to calculate enthalpies of reaction.
▶
▶Average bond lengths are also tabulated.
▶
▶In general, triple bonds are shorter and stronger than double 
bonds, which are in turn shorter and stronger than single bonds.
Bonding in Metals (9.11)
▶
▶When metal atoms bond together to form a solid, each metal 
atom donates one or more electrons to an electron sea. The 
metal cations are held together by their attraction to the sea 
of ­electrons.
▶
▶The electron sea model accounts for the electrical conductivity, 
thermal conductivity, malleability, and ductility of metals.

ries, free radicals may attack molecules within the cell, such as 
DNA, changing them and causing cancer or other diseases. Free

ing them appear foreign to the body’s immune system. The im-
mune system then attacks the cells and destroys them, 
weakening the body. Draw Lewis structures for each free radical

or an atom of a nonmetal. Each group member holds a coin to

configurations comes from the experimental lattice energies of 
the metal fluorides–MF2. Figure a▼ plots lattice energy for the

Answers to Conceptual Connections
Bond Types
9.1	 (c) Because MgF2 is composed of a metal and a nonmetal, it is 
most likely to contain ionic bonds.
Melting Points of Ionic Solids
9.2	 You would expect MgO to have the higher melting point be-
cause, in our bonding model, the magnesium and oxygen ions 
are held together in a crystalline lattice by charges of 2+ for mag-
nesium and 2- for oxygen. In contrast, the NaCl lattice is held 
together by charges of 1+ for sodium and 1- for chlorine. The 
experimentally measured melting points of these compounds 
are 801 °C for NaCl and 2852 °C for MgO, in accordance with our 
model.
Energy and the Octet Rule
9.3	 The reasons that atoms form bonds are complex. One contribut-
ing factor is the lowering of their potential energy. The octet rule 
is just a handy way to predict the combinations of atoms that 
have a lower potential energy when they bond.
Periodic Trends in Electronegativity
9.4	 N 7 P 7 Al 7 Na
Percent Ionic Character
9.5	 (b) You are given that the dipole moment of the HCl bond is 
about 1 D and that the bond length is 127 pm. Previously, we 
calculated the dipole moment for a 130-pm bond that is 100% 
ionic to be about 6.2 D. You can therefore estimate the bond’s 
ionic character as 1>6 * 100, which is closest to 15%.
Odd-Electron Species
9.6	 (d) NO2 because the sum of the valence electrons of its atoms is 
an odd number.
Expanded Octets
9.7	 (b) The only molecule in this group that could have an expand-
ed octet is H3PO4 because phosphorus is a third-period element. 
Expanded octets never occur in second-period elements such as 
carbon and nitrogen.
Bond Energies and ∆Hrxn
9.8	 (b) In a highly exothermic reaction, the energy needed to break 
bonds is less than the energy released when the new bonds form, 
resulting in a net release of energy.

▲ Similarities in the shape of 
sucrose and aspartame give both 
molecules the ability to stimulate a 
sweet taste sensation.
I
n Chapter 9, we examined a simple model for chemical bonding called the Lewis model. 
We saw how this  model helps us to explain and predict the combinations of atoms that 
form stable molecules. When we combine the Lewis model with the idea that valence 
electron groups repel one another—the basis of an approach known as VSEPR theory—we 
can predict the general shape of a molecule from its Lewis structure. We address molecular 
shape and its importance in the first part of this chapter. We then move on to explore two 
additional bonding theories—called valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory—
that are progressively more sophisticated, but at the cost of being more complex, than the 
Lewis model. As you work through this chapter, our second on chemical bonding, keep in 
mind the importance of this topic. In our universe, elements join together to form com-
pounds, and that makes many things possible, including our own existence.
	 10.1	 Artificial Sweeteners: Fooled by 
Molecular Shape
Artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame (NutraSweet), taste sweet but have few or no 
­calories. Why? Because taste and caloric value are independent properties of foods. The caloric 
value of a food depends on the amount of energy released when your body ­metabolizes 
the food. For example, sucrose (table sugar) is metabolized by oxidation to carbon 
­dioxide and water:
C12H22O11 + 12 O2 ¡ 12 CO2 + 11 H2O  ∆H °rxn = -5644 kJ

428	
Chapter 10  Chemical Bonding II: Molecular Shapes, Valence Bond Theory, and Molecular Orbital Theory
When your body metabolizes a mole of sucrose, it obtains 5644 kJ of energy. Some artifi-
cial sweeteners, such as saccharin, for example, are not metabolized at all—they just pass 
through the body unchanged—and therefore have no caloric value. Other artificial 
sweeteners, such as aspartame, are metabolized but have a much lower caloric content 
(for a given amount of sweetness) than sucrose.
The taste of a food, however, is independent of its metabolism. The sensation of 
taste originates in the tongue, where specialized taste cells act as highly sensitive and 
specific molecular detectors. These cells discern sugar molecules from the thousands of 
different types of molecules present in a mouthful of food. The main factors for this dis-
crimination are the sugar molecule’s shape and charge distribution.
The surface of a taste cell contains specialized protein molecules called taste recep-
tors. A particular tastant—a molecule that we can taste—fits snugly into a special pocket 
(just as a key fits into a lock) on the taste receptor protein called the active site. For exam-
ple, a sugar molecule precisely fits into the active site of the sugar receptor protein called 
T1r3. When the sugar molecule (the key) enters the active site (the lock), the different 
subunits of the T1r3 protein split apart. This split opens ion channels in the cell mem-
brane, resulting in nerve signal transmission (see Section 8.1) that reaches the brain and 
causes the sensation of sweetness.
Artificial sweeteners taste sweet because they fit into the receptor pocket that nor-
mally binds sucrose. In fact, both aspartame and saccharin bind to the active site in the 
T1r3 protein more strongly than sugar! For this reason, artificial sweeteners are “sweeter 
than sugar.” Aspartame, for example, is 200 times sweeter than sugar, meaning that it 
takes 200 times as much sugar as aspartame to trigger the same amount of nerve signal 
transmission from taste cells.
The lock-and-key fit between the active site of a protein and a particular molecule is 
important not only to taste but to many other biological functions as well. Immune 
response, the sense of smell, and many types of drug action all depend on shape-specific 
interactions between molecules and proteins. Our ability to determine the shapes of key 
biological molecules is largely responsible for the revolution in biology research that has 
occurred over the last 50 years.
In this chapter, we look at ways to predict and account for the shapes of molecules. 
The molecules we examine are much smaller than the protein molecules we just dis-
cussed, but the same principles apply to both. The simple model we examine to account 
for molecular shape is valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory, and we will use 
it in conjunction with the Lewis model. We then proceed to explore two additional 
bonding theories: valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory. These bonding 
theories are more complex, but also more powerful, than the Lewis model. They predict 
and account for molecular shape as well as other properties of molecules.
	 10.2	 VSEPR Theory: The Five Basic Shapes
Valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory is based on the simple idea 
that electron groups—which we define as lone pairs, single bonds, multiple bonds, 
and even single electrons—repel one another through coulombic forces. The electron 
groups are also attracted to the nucleus (otherwise the molecule would fall apart), but 
VSEPR theory focuses on the repulsions. According to VSEPR theory, the repulsions 
between electron groups on interior atoms of a molecule determine the geometry of the 
molecule (Figure 10.1◀). The preferred geometry of a molecule is the one in which the 
electron groups have the maximum separation (and therefore the minimum repulsion 
energy) possible. Consequently, for molecules having just one interior atom (the central 
atom), molecular geometry depends on (a) the number of electron groups around the 
central atom and (b) how many of those electron groups are bonding groups and how 
many are lone pairs. We first look at the molecular geometries associated with two to six 
electron groups around the central atom when all of those groups are bonding groups 
(single or multiple bonds). The resulting geometries constitute the five basic shapes of 
molecules. We then consider how these basic shapes are modified if one or more of the 
electron groups are lone pairs.

Two Electron Groups: Linear Geometry
Consider the Lewis structure of BeCl2, which has two electron groups (two single bonds) 
about the central atom:
≠Cl
÷≠Be≠Cl
÷≠
According to VSEPR theory, the geometry of BeCl2 is determined by the repulsion 
between these two electron groups, which maximize their separation by assuming a 
180° bond angle or a linear geometry. Experimental measurements of the geometry 
of BeCl2 indicate that the molecule is indeed linear, as predicted by the theory.
Molecules that form only two single bonds, with no lone pairs, are rare because they 
do not follow the octet rule. However, the same geometry is observed in all molecules 
that have two electron groups (and no lone pairs). Consider the Lewis structure of CO2, 
which has two electron groups (the double bonds) around the central carbon atom:
≠O¶ “ C “ O¶≠
According to VSEPR theory, the two double bonds repel each other (just as the two sin-
gle bonds in BeCl2 repel each other), resulting in a linear geometry for CO2. Experimen-
tal observations confirm that CO2 is indeed a linear molecule.
Three Electron Groups: Trigonal Planar Geometry
The Lewis structure of BF 3 (another molecule with an incomplete octet) has three elec-
tron groups around the central atom:
F
B F
F
These three electron groups can maximize their separation by assuming 120° bond 
angles in a plane—a trigonal planar geometry. Experimental observations of the 
structure of BF 3 again confirm the predictions of VSEPR theory.
Another molecule with three electron groups, formaldehyde (HCHO), has one dou-
ble bond and two single bonds around the central atom:
C
H
H
O
Because formaldehyde has three electron groups around the central atom, we initially 
predict that the bond angles should also be 120°. However, experimental observations 
show that the HCO bond angles are 121.9° and the HCH bond angle is 116.2°. These 
bond angles are close to the idealized 120° that we originally predicted, but the HCO 
bond angles are slightly greater than the HCH bond angle because the double bond con-
tains more electron density than the single bond and therefore exerts a slightly greater 
repulsion on the single bonds. In general, different types of electron groups exert slightly 
­different repulsions—the resulting bond angles reflect these differences.
Beryllium often forms incomplete 
octets, as it does in this structure.

Four Electron Groups: Tetrahedral Geometry
The VSEPR geometries of molecules with two or three electron groups around the cen-
tral atom are two-dimensional, and we can therefore easily visualize and represent 
them on paper. For molecules with four or more electron groups around the central 
atom, the geometries are three-dimensional and therefore more difficult to imagine 
and draw. We can understand these basic shapes by analogy to balloons tied together.

Electron Geometry with 
Balloons  (a) The bulkiness of 
balloons causes them to assume 
a linear arrangement when two of 
them are tied together. Similarly, 
the repulsion between two electron 
groups produces a linear geometry. 
(b) Like three balloons tied together, 
three electron groups adopt a 
trigonal planar geometry.
In this analogy, each electron group around a central atom is like a balloon tied to a 
central point. The ­bulkiness of the balloons causes them to spread out as much as pos-
sible, much as the repulsion between electron groups causes them to position them-
selves as far apart as possible.
For example, if you tie two balloons together, they assume a roughly linear arrange-
ment, as shown in Figure 10.2(a)▲, analogous to the linear geometry of BeCl2 that we 
just examined. Notice that the balloons do not represent atoms, but electron groups. Simi-
larly, if you tie three balloons together—in analogy to three electron groups—they 
assume a trigonal planar geometry, as shown in Figure 10.2(b)▲, much like the BF3 mol-
ecule. If you tie four balloons together, however, they assume a three-dimensional tetra-
hedral geometry with 109.5° angles between the balloons. That is, the balloons point 
toward the vertices of a tetrahedron—a geometrical shape with four identical faces, each 
an equilateral triangle, as shown here:

For four electron groups, the tetrahedron is the three-dimensional shape that allows the 
maximum separation among the groups. The repulsions among the four electron groups 
in the C:H bonds cause the molecule to assume the tetrahedral shape. When we write 
the Lewis structure of CH4 on paper, it may seem that the molecule should be square 
planar, with bond angles of 90°. However, in three dimensions, the electron groups can 
get farther away from each other by forming the tetrahedral geometry, as illustrated by 
our balloon analogy.

Five Electron Groups: Trigonal Bipyramidal Geometry
Five electron groups around a central atom assume a trigonal 
­bipyramidal geometry, like five balloons tied together. In this 
­structure, three of the groups lie in a single plane, as in the trigonal 
planar configuration, whereas the other two are positioned above and 
below this plane. The angles in the trigonal bipyramidal structure are 
not all the same. The angles between the equatorial positions (the three 
bonds in the trigonal plane) are 120°, whereas the angle between the 
axial positions (the two bonds on either side of the trigonal plane) and 
the trigonal plane is 90°. PCl5 is an example of a molecule with five 
­electron groups around the central atom:

­geometry, like six balloons tied together. In this structure—named after 
the eight-sided geometrical shape called the octahedron—four of the groups 
lie in a single plane, with a fifth group above the plane and the sixth below 
it. The angles in this geometry are all 90°. SF6 is a molecule with six electron

The central nitrogen atom has four electron groups (one lone pair and 
three bonding pairs) that repel one another. If we do not distinguish 
between bonding electron groups and lone pairs, we find that the  
electron geometry—the geometrical arrangement of the electron 
groups—is still tetrahedral, as we expect for four electron groups. However, 
the molecular geometry—the geometrical arrangement of the atoms—
is trigonal pyramidal, as shown at left.

	 10.3	 Vsepr Theory: The Effect of Lone Pairs
Each of the examples we have just seen has only bonding electron groups around the cen-
tral atom. What happens in molecules that have lone pairs around the central atom as 
well? The lone pairs also repel other electron groups, as we see in the examples that follow.

VSEPR Theory: The Effect 
of Lone Pairs

We see the effects of this ordering in the progressively smaller bond angles 
of CH4, NH3, and H2O, shown in Figure 10.4▼. The relative ordering of 
repulsions also helps to determine the geometry of molecules with five and 
six electron groups when one or more of those groups are lone pairs.
Notice that although the electron geometry and the molecular geometry are 
­different, the electron geometry is relevant to the molecular geometry. The lone pair exerts its 
influence on the bonding pairs.
As we noted previously, different kinds of electron groups generally 
result in different amounts of repulsion. Lone pair electrons typically exert 
slightly greater repulsions than bonding electrons. If all four electron 
groups in NH3 exerted equal repulsions on one another, the bond angles in 
the molecule would all be the ideal tetrahedral angle, 109.5°. However, the 
actual angle between N¬ H bonds in ammonia is slightly smaller, 107°. A 
lone electron pair is more spread out in space than a bonding electron pair 
because a lone pair is attracted to only one nucleus while a bonding pair is 
attracted to two (Figure 10.3▼). The lone pair occupies more of the angular 
space around a nucleus, exerting a greater repulsive force on neighboring 
electrons and compressing the N¬ H bond angles.

A water molecule’s Lewis structure is:

Because water has four electron groups (two bonding pairs and 
two lone pairs), its electron geometry is also tetrahedral, but its 
molecular geometry is bent, as shown at right. As in NH3, the 
bond angles in H2O are smaller (104.5°) than the ideal tetrahe-
dral bond angles because of the greater repulsion exerted by the 
lone pair electrons. The bond angle in H2O is even smaller than 
in NH3 because H2O has two lone pairs of electrons on the cen-
tral oxygen atom. These lone pairs compress the H2O bond 
angle to a greater extent than in NH3.

The central sulfur atom has five electron groups (one lone pair and four bonding pairs). 
The electron geometry, due to the five electron groups, is trigonal bipyramidal.
To determine the molecular geometry for sulfur tetrafluoride, notice that the lone 
pair could occupy either an equatorial position or an axial position within the trigonal 
bipyramidal electron geometry. Which position is more favorable? To answer this ques-
tion, recall that, as we have just seen, lone pair–bonding pair repulsions are greater than 
bonding pair–bonding pair repulsions. Therefore, the lone pair occupies the position 
that minimizes its interaction with the bonding pairs. If the lone pair were in an axial 
position, it would have three 90° interactions with bonding pairs. In an equatorial posi-
tion, however, it has only two 90° interactions. Consequently, the lone pair occupies an 
equatorial position. The resulting molecular geometry is called seesaw because it 
resembles a seesaw (or teeter-totter).

Summarizing VSEPR Theory:
▶
▶
The geometry of a molecule is determined by the number of electron groups on the 
central atom (or on all interior atoms, if there is more than one).
▶
▶
The number of electron groups is determined from the Lewis structure of the 
­molecule. If the Lewis structure contains resonance structures, use any one of the 
resonance structures to determine the number of electron groups.
▶
▶
Each of the following counts as a single electron group: a lone pair, a single bond, a 
double bond, a triple bond, or a single electron (as in a free radical).
▶
▶
The geometry of the electron groups is determined by their repulsions as summa-
rized in Table 10.1. In general, electron group repulsions vary as follows:
Lone pair–lone pair  7  lone pair–bonding pair  7  bonding pair–bonding pair
▶
▶
Bond angles can vary from the idealized angles because double and triple bonds 
occupy more space than single bonds (they are bulkier even though they are 
shorter), and lone pairs occupy more space than bonding groups. The presence of 
lone pairs usually makes bond angles smaller than the ideal angles for the 
­particular geometry.

Predicting the Shapes of Larger Molecules
Larger molecules may have two or more interior atoms. When predicting the shapes of 
these molecules, we apply the principles we just covered to each interior atom. Consider 
glycine, an amino acid found in many proteins (such as those involved in taste discussed 
in Section 10.1). Glycine, shown in the margin, contains four interior atoms: one nitro-
gen atom, two carbon atoms, and an oxygen atom. To determine the shape of glycine, 
we determine the geometry about each interior atom as follows:

	 10.5	 Molecular Shape and Polarity
In Chapter 9, we discussed polar bonds. Entire molecules can also be polar, depending 
on their shape and the nature of their bonds. For example, if a diatomic molecule has a 
polar bond, the molecule as a whole is polar:

The figure on the right is an electrostatic potential map of HCl. In these maps, red areas 
indicate electron-rich regions in the molecule and the blue areas indicate electron-poor 
regions. Yellow indicates moderate electron density. Notice that the region around the 
more electronegative atom (chlorine) is more electron-rich than the region around the 
hydrogen atom. Thus the molecule itself is polar. If the bond in a diatomic molecule is 
nonpolar, the molecule as a whole is nonpolar.
In polyatomic molecules, the presence of polar bonds may or may not result in a 
polar molecule, depending on the molecular geometry. If the molecular geometry is such

that the dipole moments of individual polar bonds sum together to a net dipole moment, 
then the molecule is polar. But, if the molecular geometry is such that the dipole moments 
of the individual polar bonds cancel each other (that is, sum to zero), then the molecule is 
nonpolar. It all depends on the geometry of the molecule. Consider carbon dioxide:
≠O¶ “ C “ O¶≠
Each C “ O bond in CO2 is polar because oxygen and carbon have significantly dif-
ferent electronegativities (3.5 and 2.5, respectively). However, since CO2 is a linear mol-
ecule, the polar bonds directly oppose one another and the dipole moment of one bond 
exactly opposes the dipole moment of the other—the two dipole moments sum to zero 
and the molecule is nonpolar.
Dipole moments can cancel each other because they are vector quantities; they have 
both a magnitude and a direction. Think of each polar bond as a vector, pointing in the 
direction of the more electronegative atom. The length of the vector is proportional to 
the electronegativity difference between the bonding atoms. In CO2, we have two iden-
tical vectors pointing in exactly opposite directions—the vectors sum to zero, much as 
+1 and -1 sum to zero:
No net dipole moment

Notice that the electrostatic potential map shows regions of moderately high electron 
density (yellow with slight red) positioned symmetrically on either end of the molecule 
with a region of low electron density (blue) located in the middle.
In contrast, consider water:
H ¬ O÷ ¬ H
The O¬ Η bonds in water are also polar; oxygen and hydrogen have electronegativities 
of 3.5 and 2.1, respectively. However, the water molecule is not linear but bent, so the 
two dipole moments do not sum to zero as they do in carbon dioxide. If we imagine each 
bond in water as a vector pointing toward oxygen (the more electronegative atom), we 
see that, because of the angle between the vectors, they do not cancel but sum to an 
overall vector or a net dipole moment (shown by the dashed arrow):

The electrostatic potential map reveals an electron-rich region at the oxygen end of the 
molecule. Consequently, water is a polar molecule. Table 10.2 (on page 443) summarizes 
common geometries and molecular polarity.

▶
Draw the Lewis structure for the molecule and determine its molecular 
geometry. 
▶
▶
Determine whether the molecule contains polar bonds.  A bond is polar if 
the two bonding atoms have sufficiently different electronegativities (see Figure 9.8). 
If the molecule contains polar bonds, superimpose a vector, pointing toward the more 
electronegative atom, on each bond. Draw the length of the vector proportional to 
the electronegativity difference between the bonding atoms.
▶
▶
Determine whether the polar bonds add together to form a net dipole 
moment.  Sum the vectors corresponding to the polar bonds together. If the vec-
tors sum to zero, the molecule is nonpolar. If the vectors sum to a net vector, the 
molecule is polar.

Two or More Dimensions
To add two vectors, draw a parallelogram in which the two vectors 
form two adjacent sides. Draw the other two sides of the parallelo-
gram parallel to and the same length as the two original vectors. 
Draw the resultant vector beginning at the origin and extending to 
the far corner of the parallelogram as shown in Examples 4 and 5.
Vector Addition
We determine whether a molecule is polar by summing the vectors associated with the 
dipole moments of all the polar bonds in the molecule. If the vectors sum to zero, the mol-
ecule is nonpolar. If they sum to a net vector, the molecule is polar. In this section, we dem-
onstrate how to add vectors together in one dimension and in two or more dimensions.
One Dimension
To add two vectors that lie on the same line, assign one direction as positive. Vectors 
pointing in that direction have positive magnitudes. Consider vectors pointing in the 
opposite direction to have negative magnitudes. Then sum the vectors (always remem-
bering to include their signs), as shown in Examples 1–3.

Polar and nonpolar molecules have different properties. Water and oil do not 
mix, for example, because water molecules are polar and the molecules that compose 
oil are generally nonpolar. Polar molecules interact strongly with other polar mole-
cules because the positive end of one molecule is attracted to the negative end of 
another, just as the south pole of a magnet is attracted to the north pole of another 
magnet (Figure 10.5◀). A mixture of polar and nonpolar molecules is similar to a mix-
ture of small magnetic particles and nonmagnetic ones. The magnetic particles 
(which are like polar molecules) clump together, excluding the nonmagnetic parti-
cles (which are like nonpolar molecules) and separating into distinct regions.

magine eating a greasy cheeseburger with both hands with-
out a napkin. By the end of the meal, grease and oil coat your 
hands. If you try to wash them with only water, they remain greasy. 
However, if you add a little soap, the grease washes away. Why? 
As we just learned, water molecules are polar and the molecules 
that compose grease and oil are nonpolar. As a result, water and 
grease do not mix.
The molecules that compose soap, however, have a special struc-
ture that allows them to interact strongly with both water and grease. 
One end of a soap molecule is polar and the other end is nonpolar.
The nonpolar end is a long hydrocarbon chain. Hydrocarbons 
are always nonpolar because the electronegativity difference be-
tween carbon and hydrogen is small and because the tetrahedral 
arrangement about each carbon atom tends to cancel any small 
­dipole moments of individual bonds. The polar head of a soap 
­molecule—usually, though not always, ionic—strongly attracts water 
molecules, while the nonpolar tail interacts more strongly with 
grease and oil molecules (we examine the nature of these interac-
tions in Chapter 11). Thus, soap acts as a sort of molecular liai-
son, one end interacting with water and the other end interacting 
with grease. Soap allows water and grease to mix, removing the 
grease from your hands and washing it down the drain.

	 10.6	 Valence Bond Theory: Orbital Overlap 
as a Chemical Bond
In the Lewis model, we use dots to represent electrons. We know from quantum-­
mechanical theory, however, that such a treatment is an oversimplification. More 
advanced bonding theories treat electrons in a quantum-mechanical manner. These 
theories are actually extensions of quantum mechanics, applied to molecules. Although 
a detailed quantitative treatment of these theories is beyond the scope of this book, 
we introduce them in a qualitative manner in the sections that follow. Keep in mind, 
however, that modern quantitative approaches to chemical bonding using these theo-
ries accurately predict many of the properties of molecules—such as bond lengths, bond 
strengths, molecular geometries, and dipole moments—that we discuss in this book.
The simpler of the two more advanced bonding theories is valence bond theory. 
According to valence bond theory, electrons reside in quantum-mechanical orbitals local-
ized on individual atoms. In many cases, these orbitals are simply the standard s, p, d, and f  
atomic orbitals that we learned about in Chapter 7. In other cases, these orbitals are hybrid-
ized atomic orbitals, a kind of blend or combination of two or more standard atomic orbitals.
When two atoms approach each other, the electrons and nucleus of one atom inter-
act with the electrons and nucleus of the other atom. In valence bond theory, we calculate 
how these interactions affect the energies of the electrons in the atomic orbitals. If the 
energy of the system is lowered because of the interactions, then a chemical bond forms. If 
the energy of the system is raised by the interactions, then a chemical bond does not form.
The interaction energy is usually calculated as a function of the internuclear dis-
tance between the two bonding atoms. For example, Figure 10.6▼ shows the calculated 
interaction energy between two hydrogen atoms as a function of the distance between 
them. The y-axis of the graph is the potential energy of the interaction between the elec-
tron and nucleus of one hydrogen atom and the electron and nucleus of the other 
hydrogen atom. The x-axis is the separation (or internuclear distance) between the two 
atoms. As we can see from the graph, when the atoms are far apart (right side of the 
graph, labeled 1), the interaction energy is nearly zero because the two atoms do not 
interact to any significant extent. As the atoms get closer (labeled 2 and 3 on the graph), 
the interaction energy becomes negative. The lowering of the interaction energy is a net 
stabilization that attracts one hydrogen atom to the other. If the atoms get too close 
Valence bond theory is an application 
of a general quantum-mechanical 
approximation method called 
perturbation theory. In perturbation 
theory, a complex system (such as 
a molecule) is viewed as a simpler 
system (such as two atoms) that is 
slightly altered or perturbed by some 
additional force or interaction (such 
as the interaction between the two 
atoms).

degree of overlap without too much 
repulsion between their nuclei. This 
distance, at which the system is most 
stable, is the bond length of the  
h2 molecule (labeled 3 on this graph).
Valence Bond Theory

446	
Chapter 10  Chemical Bonding II: Molecular Shapes, Valence Bond Theory, and Molecular Orbital Theory
(labeled 4 on the graph), however, the interaction energy begins to rise, primarily 
because of the mutual repulsion of the two positively charged nuclei. The most stable 
point on the curve occurs at the minimum of the interaction energy—this is the equilib-
rium bond length (labeled 3 on the graph). At this distance, the two atomic 1s orbitals 
have a significant amount of overlap, and the electrons spend time in the internuclear 
region where they can interact with both nuclei. The value of the interaction energy at 
the equilibrium bond distance is the bond energy.
When we apply valence bond theory to a number of atoms and their corresponding 
molecules, we arrive at the following general observation: the interaction energy is usually 
negative (or stabilizing) when the interacting atomic orbitals contain a total of two electrons that 
can spin-pair (orient with opposing spins). Most commonly, the two electrons come from two 
half-filled orbitals, but in some cases, the two electrons come from one filled orbital over-
lapping with a completely empty orbital (this is called a coordinate covalent bond, and we 
will cover it in more detail in Chapter 25). In other words, when two atoms with half-filled 
orbitals approach each other, the half-filled orbitals overlap—parts of the orbitals occupy 
the same space—and the electrons occupying them align with opposite spins. This results 
in a net energy stabilization that constitutes a covalent chemical bond. The resulting 
geometry of the molecule emerges from the geometry of the overlapping orbitals.
Summarizing Valence Bond Theory:
▶
▶
The valence electrons of the atoms in a molecule reside in quantum-mechanical 
atomic orbitals. The orbitals can be the standard s, p, d, and f  orbitals, or they may 
be hybrid combinations of these.
▶
▶
A chemical bond results from the overlap of two half-filled orbitals with spin-­
pairing of the two valence electrons (or less commonly the overlap of a completely 
filled orbital with an empty orbital).
▶
▶
The geometry of the overlapping orbitals determines the shape of the molecule.
We can apply the general concepts of valence bond theory to explain bonding in 
hydrogen sulfide, H2S. The valence electron configurations of the atoms in the molecule 
are as follows:

The hydrogen atoms each have one half-filled orbital, and the sulfur atom has two

half-filled orbitals on the sulfur atom, forming two chemical bonds:

To show the spin-pairing of the electrons in the overlapping orbitals, we superimpose a

the electrons are spin-paired (one half-arrow is pointing up and the other is pointing 
When completely filled orbitals overlap, 
the interaction energy is positive

down). We also superimpose paired half-arrows in the filled sulfur s and p orbitals to 
­represent the lone pair electrons in those orbitals. (Since those orbitals are full, they are 
not involved in bonding.)
A quantitative calculation of H2S using valence bond theory yields bond energies, 
bond lengths, and bond angles. In our qualitative treatment, we simply show how 
orbital overlap leads to bonding and make a rough sketch of the molecule based on the 
overlapping orbitals. Notice that, because the overlapping orbitals on the central atom 
(sulfur) are p orbitals and because p orbitals are oriented at 90° to one another, the pre-
dicted bond angle is 90°. The actual bond angle in H2S is 92°. In the case of H2S, a simple 
valence bond treatment matches well with the experimentally measured bond angle ­ 
(in contrast to VSEPR theory, which predicts a bond angle of less than 109.5°).

What Is a Chemical Bond? Part I  The answer to the question “What is a 
chemical bond?” depends on the bonding model. Answer these three questions:
(a)	 What is a covalent chemical bond according to the Lewis model?
(b)	 What is a covalent chemical bond according to valence bond theory?
(c)	 Why are the answers different?
 
	 10.7	 Valence Bond Theory: Hybridization  
of Atomic Orbitals
Although the overlap of half-filled standard atomic orbitals adequately explains the 
bonding in H2S, it cannot adequately explain the bonding in many other molecules. For 
example, suppose we try to explain the bonding between hydrogen and carbon using 
the same approach. The valence electron configurations of H and C are as follows:
1s
H
C
2s
2p
Carbon has only two half-filled orbitals and should therefore form only two bonds with 
two hydrogen atoms. We would therefore predict that carbon and hydrogen should form 
a molecule with the formula CH2 and with a bond angle of 90° (corresponding to the 
angle between any two p orbitals).
However, from experiments, we know that the stable compound formed from car-
bon and hydrogen is CH4 (methane), which has bond angles of 109.5°. The experimen-
tal reality is different from our simple prediction in two ways. First, carbon forms bonds 
to four hydrogen atoms, not two. Second, the bond angles are much larger than the 
angle between two p orbitals. Valence bond theory accounts for the bonding in CH4 and 
many other polyatomic molecules by incorporating an additional concept called orbital 
hybridization.
So far, we have assumed that the overlapping orbitals that form chemical bonds are 
simply the standard s, p, or d atomic orbitals. Valence bond theory treats the electrons 
in a molecule as if they occupied these standard atomic orbitals, but this is a major 
oversimplification. The concept of hybridization in valence bond theory is essentially a 
step toward recognizing that the orbitals in a molecule are not necessarily the same as the 
orbitals in an atom. Hybridization is a mathematical procedure in which the standard 
atomic orbitals are combined to form new atomic orbitals called hybrid orbitals that

correspond more closely to the actual distribution of electrons in chemically bonded 
atoms. Hybrid orbitals are still localized on individual atoms, but their shapes and ener-
gies differ from those of standard atomic orbitals.
Why do we hypothesize that electrons in some molecules occupy hybrid orbitals? 
In valence bond theory, a chemical bond is the overlap of two orbitals that together 
contain two electrons. The greater the overlap, the stronger the bond and the lower 
the energy. In hybrid orbitals, the electron probability density is more concentrated 
in a single directional lobe, allowing greater overlap with the orbitals of other atoms. 
Hybrid orbitals minimize the energy of the molecule by maximizing the orbital overlap 
in a bond.
Hybridization, however, is not a free lunch—in most cases it actually costs some 
energy. So hybridization occurs only to the degree that the energy payback through 
bond formation is large. In general, therefore, the more bonds that an atom forms, the 
greater the tendency of its orbitals to hybridize. Central or interior atoms, which form 
the most bonds, have the greatest tendency to hybridize. Terminal atoms, which form 
the fewest bonds, have the least tendency to hybridize. In this book, we focus on the hybrid-
ization of interior atoms and assume that all terminal atoms—those bonding to only one other 
atom—are unhybridized. Hybridization is particularly important in carbon, which tends 
to form four bonds in its compounds and therefore always hybridizes.
Although we cannot examine the procedure for obtaining hybrid orbitals in mathe-
matical detail here, we can make the following general statements regarding hybridization:
▶
▶
The number of standard atomic orbitals added together always equals the number of 
­hybrid orbitals formed. The total number of orbitals is conserved.
▶
▶
The particular combination of standard atomic orbitals added together determines 
the shapes and energies of the hybrid orbitals formed.
▶
▶
The particular type of hybridization that occurs is the one that yields the lowest overall 
energy for the molecule. Since actual energy calculations are beyond the scope of this 
book, we use electron geometries as determined by VSEPR theory to predict the type 
of hybridization.
sp3 Hybridization
We can account for the tetrahedral geometry in CH4 by the hybridization of the one  
2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals on the carbon atom. The four new orbitals that result, 
called sp3 hybrids, are shown in the following energy diagram:
2p

The notation sp3 indicates that the hybrid orbitals are mixtures of one s orbital and three 
p orbitals. Notice that the hybrid orbitals all have the same energy—they are degenerate. 
The shapes of the sp3 hybrid orbitals are shown in Figure 10.7▶. The four hybrid orbitals 
are arranged in a tetrahedral geometry with 109.5° angles between them.
We can write an orbital diagram for carbon using these hybrid orbitals:
C
sp3
As we saw in Chapter 9, the  word 
hybrid comes from breeding. A hybrid 
is an offspring of two animals or 
plants of different standard races 
or breeds. Similarly, a hybrid orbital 
is a product of mixing two or more 
standard atomic orbitals.
In a more nuanced treatment, 
hybridization is not an all-or-nothing 
process—it can occur to varying 
degrees that are not always easy to 
predict. We saw earlier, for example, 
that sulfur does not hybridize very 
much in forming h2s.

The geometry of the overlapping orbitals (the hybrids) is tetrahedral, with angles of  
109.5° between the orbitals, so the resulting geometry of the molecule is tetrahedral, with 
109.5° bond angles. This agrees with the experimentally measured geometry of CH4 and 
with the predicted VSEPR geometry.

Chapter 10  Chemical Bonding II: Molecular Shapes, Valence Bond Theory, and Molecular Orbital Theory
Hybridized orbitals readily form chemical bonds because they tend to maximize 
overlap with other orbitals. However, if the central atom of a molecule contains lone 
pairs, hybrid orbitals can also accommodate them. For example, the nitrogen orbitals in 
ammonia are sp3 hybrids. Three of the hybrids are involved in bonding with three hydro-
gen atoms, but the fourth hybrid contains a lone pair. The presence of the lone pair low-
ers the tendency of nitrogen’s orbitals to hybridize. (Remember that the tendency to 
hybridize increases with the number of bonds formed.) Therefore the bond angle in NH3 
is 107°, a bit closer to the unhybridized p orbital bond angle of 90°.

▶ Figure 10.9  Sigma and Pi 
Bonding  When orbitals overlap 
side by side, the result is a pi (p) 
bond. When orbitals overlap end to 
end, they form a sigma (s) bond. 
Two atoms can form only one sigma 
bond. A single bond is a sigma bond, 
a double bond consists of a sigma 
bond and a pi bond, and a triple 
bond consists of a sigma bond and 
two pi bonds.
Notice the overlap between the half-filled p orbitals on the carbon and oxygen 
atoms. When p orbitals overlap this way (side by side) the resulting bond is a pi (p) 
bond, and the electron density is above and below the internuclear axis. When orbitals 
overlap end to end, as is the case in all of the rest of the bonds in the molecule, the result-
ing bond is a sigma (s) bond (Figure 10.9▲). Even though we represent the two elec-
trons in a p bond as two half-arrows in the upper lobe, they are actually spread out over 
both the upper and lower lobes (this is one of the limitations we encounter when we try 
to represent electrons with arrows). We can label all the bonds in the molecule using a 
notation that specifies the type of bond (s or p) as well as the type of overlapping orbit-
als. We have included this notation, as well as the Lewis structure of H2CO for compari-
son, in the bonding diagram for H2CO :

Notice the correspondence between valence bond theory and the Lewis model. In 
both models, the central carbon atom forms four bonds: two single bonds and one 
double bond. However, valence bond theory gives us more insight into the bonds. The 
double bond between carbon and oxygen according to valence bond theory consists of 
two different kinds of bonds—one s and one p—whereas in the Lewis model the two 
bonds within the double bond appear identical. A double bond in the Lewis model always 
corresponds to one s and one p bond in valence bond theory. In general, p bonds are weaker 
than s bonds because side-to-side orbital overlap tends to be less efficient than end-­ 
to-end orbital overlap. Consequently, the p bond in a double bond is generally easier 
to break than the s bond. Valence bond theory, as you can see, gives us more insight 
into the nature of a double bond than the Lewis model.
One—and only one—s bond forms 
between any two atoms. Additional 
bonds must be p bonds.

	
10.7  Valence Bond Theory: Hybridization of Atomic Orbitals 	
453
Valence bond theory shows us the types of orbitals involved in the bonding and 
their shapes. For example, in H2CO, the sp2 hybrid orbitals on the central atom are trigo-
nal planar with 120° angles between them, so the resulting predicted geometry of the 
molecule is trigonal planar with 120° bond angles. The experimentally measured bond 
angles in H2CO, as discussed previously, are 121.9° for the HCO bond and 116.2° for the 
HCH bond angle, close to the predicted values.
Valence bond theory allows us to see why the rotation about a double bond is severely 
restricted. Because of the side-by-side overlap of the p orbitals, the p bond must essentially 
break for rotation to occur (see Chemistry in Your Day: The Chemistry of Vision).
Although rotation about a double bond is highly restricted, rotation about a single 
bond is relatively unrestricted. Consider, for example, the structures of two chlorinated 
hydrocarbons, 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dichloroethene:

The isomerization occurs because visible light contains 
enough energy to break the p bond between the eleventh

is stronger, does not break, allowing the molecule to freely 
rotate about that bond. The p bond then re-forms with the 
molecule in the trans conformation. The different shape of 
the resultant all-trans-retinal causes conformational changes 
in the protein to which it is bound. These changes cause an 
electrical signal to be transmitted to the brain.

These two forms of 1,2-dichloroethene are different compounds with different 
properties. We distinguish between them with the designations cis (meaning “same 
side”) and trans (meaning “opposite sides”). Compounds such as these, with the same 
molecular formula but different structures or different spatial arrangement of atoms, are 
called ­isomers. Nature can—and does—make different compounds out of the same atoms 
by arranging the atoms in different ways. Isomerism is common throughout chemistry 
and especially important in organic chemistry, as we will discuss in Chapter 21.

Single and Double Bonds  In Section 9.10 we learned that double  bonds 
are stronger and shorter than single bonds. For example, a C¬ C single bond has an 
average bond energy of 347 kJ>mole, whereas a C “ C double bond has an average bond 
energy of 611 kJ>mole. Use valence bond theory to explain why a double bond is not 
simply twice as strong as a single bond.

bon atoms are linear with 180° between them, so the resulting geometry of each carbon 
on the molecule is linear with 180° bond angles, in agreement with the experimentally 
measured geometry of HC ‚ CH, and also in agreement with the prediction of VSEPR 
theory.
sp3d and sp3d2 Hybridization
Recall that, according to the Lewis model, elements occurring in the third row of the 
periodic table (or below) can exhibit expanded octets (see Section 9.9). The equivalent 
concept in valence bond theory is hybridization involving the d orbitals. For third-
period elements, the 3d orbitals are involved in hybridization because their energies are 
close to the energies of the 3s and 3p orbitals. The hybridization of one s orbital, three 
p orbitals, and one d orbital results in sp3d hybrid orbitals (Figure 10.11(a)▼). The five 
sp3d hybrid orbitals have a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement (Figure 10.11(b)▼). As an 
example of sp3d hybridization, consider arsenic pentafluoride, AsF5. The arsenic atom 
bonds to five fluorine atoms by overlap between the sp3d hybrid orbitals on arsenic and  
p orbitals on the fluorine atoms, as shown here:

Writing Hybridization and Bonding Schemes
We have now studied examples of the five main types of atomic orbital hybridization. 
But how do we know which hybridization scheme best describes the orbitals of a specific atom 
in a specific molecule? In computational valence bond theory, the energy of the mole-
cule is calculated using a computer; the degree of hybridization as well as the type of 
hybridization are varied to find the combination that gives the molecule the lowest 
overall energy. For our purposes, we can assign a hybridization scheme from the electron 
geometry—determined using VSEPR theory—of the central atom (or interior atoms) of

schemes are shown in Table 10.3. For example, if the electron geometry of the central 
atom is tetrahedral, then the hybridization is sp3, and if the electron geometry is octa-
hedral, then the hybridization is sp3d2, and so on. Although this method of determining 
the hybridization scheme is not 100% accurate (for example, it predicts that H2S should 
be sp3 when in fact H2S is largely unhybridized), it is the best we can do without more 
complex computer-based calculations.
We are now ready to put the Lewis model and valence bond theory together to 
describe bonding in molecules. In the procedure and examples that follow, you will 
learn how to write a hybridization and bonding scheme for a molecule. This involves draw-
ing the Lewis structure for the molecule, determining its geometry using VSEPR theory, 
determining the hybridization of the interior atoms, drawing the molecule with its over-
lapping orbitals, and labeling each bond with the s and p notation followed by the type 
of overlapping orbitals. As you can see, this procedure involves virtually everything you 
have learned about bonding in this chapter and Chapter 9. The procedure for writing a 
hybridization and bonding scheme is shown in the left column, with two examples of 
how to apply the procedure in the columns to the right.

	 10.8	 Molecular Orbital Theory:  
Electron Delocalization
Valence bond theory can explain many aspects of chemical bonding—such as the rigid-
ity of a double bond—but it also has limitations. In valence bond theory, we treat elec-
trons as if they reside in the quantum-mechanical orbitals that we calculated for atoms. 
This is a significant oversimplification that we partially compensate for by hybridiza-
tion. Nevertheless, we can do better.
In Chapter 7, we stated that the  mathematical derivation of energies and orbitals 
for electrons in atoms comes from solving the Schrödinger equation for the atom of 

	
10.8  Molecular Orbital Theory: Electron Delocalization 	
461
interest. For a molecule, we can theoretically do the same thing. The resulting orbitals 
would be the actual molecular orbitals of the molecule as a whole (in contrast to valence 
bond theory, in which the orbitals are those of individual atoms). As it turns out, how-
ever, solving the Schrödinger equation exactly for even the simplest molecules is impos-
sible without making some approximations.
In molecular orbital (MO) theory, we do not actually solve the Schrödinger 
equation for a molecule directly. Instead, we use a trial function, an “educated guess” as 
to what the solution might be. In other words, rather than mathematically solving the 
Schrödinger equation, which would give us a mathematical function describing an 
orbital, we start with a trial mathematical function for the orbital. We then test the trial 
function to see how well it “works.”
We can understand this process by analogy to solving an algebraic equation. Sup-
pose we want to know x in the equation 4x + 5 = 70 without actually solving the equa-
tion. For an easy equation like this one, we might first estimate that x = 16. We can then 
determine how well our estimate works by substituting x = 16 into the equation. If the 
estimate did not work, we could try again until we found the right value of x. (In this 
case, we can quickly see that x must be a little more than 16.)
In molecular orbital theory, the estimating procedure is analogous. However, we 
need to add one more important concept to get at the heart of molecular orbital theory. 
In order to determine how well a trial function for an orbital “works” in molecular 
orbital theory, we calculate its energy. No matter how good our trial function, we can 
never do better than nature at minimizing the energy of the orbital. In other words, we can 
devise any trial function for an orbital in a molecule and calculate its energy. The energy 
we calculate for the devised orbital will always be greater than or (at best) equal to the 
energy of the actual orbital.
How does this help us? The best possible orbital is therefore the one with the mini-
mum energy. In modern molecular orbital theory, computer programs are designed to 
try many different variations of a guessed orbital and compare the energies of each 
one. The variation with the lowest energy is the best approximation for the actual 
molecular orbital.
Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAOs)
The simplest trial functions that work reasonably well in molecular orbital theory 
turn out to be linear combinations of atomic orbitals, or LCAOs. An LCAO molecular 
orbital is a weighted linear sum—analogous to a weighted average—of the valence atomic 
orbitals of the atoms in the molecule. At first glance, this concept might seem very 
similar to that of hybridization in valence bond theory. However, in valence bond 
theory, hybrid orbitals are weighted linear sums of the valence atomic orbitals of a 
particular atom, and the hybrid orbitals remain localized on that atom. In molecular 
orbital theory, the molecular orbitals are weighted linear sums of the valence atomic 
orbitals of all the atoms in a molecule, and many of the molecular orbitals are delocal-
ized over the entire molecule.
Consider the H2 molecule. One of the molecular orbitals for H2 is simply an equally 
weighted sum of the 1s  orbital from one atom and the 1s  orbital from the other. We rep-
resent this pictorially and energetically as follows:
Bonding orbital
+

Energy
Molecular orbital theory is a specific 
application of a more general 
quantum-mechanical approximation 
technique called the variational 
method. In the variational method, the 
energy of a trial function within the 
Schrödinger equation is minimized.
We calculate the energy of an 
estimated orbital by substituting it 
into the Schrödinger equation and 
solving for the energy.
When molecular orbitals are calculated 
mathematically, it is actually the wave 
functions corresponding to the orbitals 
that are combined.

The name of this molecular orbital is s1s. The s comes from the shape of the orbital, 
which looks like a s bond in valence bond theory, and the 1s comes from its formation 
by a linear sum of 1s orbitals. The s1s orbital is lower in energy than either of the two 1s 
atomic orbitals from which it was formed. For this reason, this orbital is called a 
­bonding orbital. When electrons occupy bonding molecular orbitals, the energy of 
the electrons is lower than it would be if they were occupying atomic orbitals.
We can think of a molecular orbital in a molecule in much the same way that we 
think about an atomic orbital in an atom. Electrons seek the lowest energy molecular 
orbital available, but just as an atom has more than one atomic orbital (and some 
may be empty), a molecule has more than one molecular orbital (and some may be 
empty). The next molecular orbital of H2 is approximated by summing the 1s orbital 
on one hydrogen atom with the negative (opposite phase) of the 1s orbital on the 
other hydrogen atom:
Antibonding orbital

The different phases of the orbitals result in destructive interference between them. The 
resulting molecular orbital therefore has a node between the two atoms. The different 
colors (red and blue) on either side of the node represent the different phases of the 
orbital (see Section 7.6). The name of this molecular orbital is s*1s. The star indicates that 
this orbital is an antibonding orbital. Electrons in antibonding orbitals have higher 
energies than they did in their respective atomic orbitals and therefore tend to raise the 
energy of the system (relative to the unbonded atoms).
In general, when two atomic orbitals are added together to form molecular orbitals, 
one of the resultant molecular orbitals is lower in energy (the bonding orbital) than the 
atomic orbitals and the other is higher in energy (the antibonding orbital). Remember 
that electrons in orbitals behave like waves. The bonding molecular orbital arises out of 
constructive interference between the overlapping atomic orbitals because both orbitals 
have the same phase. The antibonding orbital arises out of destructive interference 
between the overlapping atomic orbitals because subtracting one from the other means 
the two interacting orbitals have opposite phases (Figure 10.13▼).
For this reason, the bonding orbital has an increased electron density in the inter-
nuclear region, whereas the antibonding orbital has a node in the internuclear region. 
Bonding orbitals have greater electron density in the internuclear region, thereby lower-
ing their energy compared to the orbitals in nonbonded atoms. Antibonding orbitals 
have less electron density in the internuclear region, and their energies are generally 
higher than in the orbitals of nonbonded atoms.

We can represent the molecular orbital energy diagram with a molecular orbital 
electron configuration (which is analogous to the electron configurations we wrote for 
elements in Section 8.3):
H2   (s1s)2
In this notation, the s1s represents the molecular orbital, and the superscript 2 repre-
sents the two electrons in the orbital.
The molecular orbital (MO) energy diagram shows that two hydrogen atoms can 
lower their overall energy by forming H2 because the electrons can move from higher-
energy atomic orbitals into the lower-energy s1s bonding molecular orbital. In molecular 
orbital theory, we define the bond order of a diatomic molecule such as H2 as follows:
Bond order =
(number of electrons in bonding MOs) - (number of electrons in antibonding MOs)
2
For H2, the bond order is 1:
H2 bond order =  2 - 0
2
= 1
A positive bond order means that there are more electrons in bonding molecular 
orbitals than in antibonding molecular orbitals. The electrons therefore have lower 
energy than they did in the orbitals of the isolated atoms, and a chemical bond forms. In 
general, the higher the bond order, the stronger the bond. A negative or zero bond order 
indicates that a bond does not form between the atoms. For example, consider the MO 
diagram for He2:

Summarizing LCAO–MO Theory:
▶
▶
We can approximate molecular orbitals (MOs) as a linear combination of atomic 
­orbitals (AOs). The total number of MOs formed from a particular set of AOs always 
equals the number of AOs in the set.
▶
▶
When two AOs combine to form two MOs, one MO is lower in energy (the bonding 
MO) and the other is higher in energy (the antibonding MO).
▶
▶
When assigning the electrons of a molecule to MOs, fill the lowest energy MOs first 
with a maximum of two spin-paired electrons per orbital.
▶
▶
When assigning electrons to two MOs of the same energy, follow Hund’s rule—fill 
the orbitals singly first, with parallel spins, before pairing.
▶
▶
The bond order in a diatomic molecule is the number of electrons in bonding MOs 
minus the number in antibonding MOs divided by two. Stable bonds are associated 
with a positive bond order (more electrons in bonding MOs than in antibonding MOs).
Notice the power of the molecular orbital approach. Every electron that enters a 
bonding molecular orbital stabilizes the molecule or polyatomic ion, and every electron 
that enters an antibonding molecular orbital destabilizes it. The emphasis on electron 
pairs has been removed. One electron in a bonding molecular orbital stabilizes half as 
much as two, so a bond order of one-half is nothing mysterious.

Period Two Homonuclear Diatomic Molecules
Homonuclear diatomic molecules (molecules made up of two atoms of the same kind) 
formed from second-period elements have between 2 and 16 valence electrons. To 
explain bonding in these molecules, we must consider the next set of higher-energy 
molecular orbitals, which can be approximated by linear combinations of the valence 
atomic orbitals of the period 2 elements.
We begin with Li2. Even though lithium is normally a metal, we can use MO theory 
to predict whether or not the Li2 molecule should exist in the gas phase. We approxi-
mate the molecular orbitals in Li2 as linear combinations of the 2s atomic orbitals. The 
resulting molecular orbitals look much like those of the H2 molecule. The MO diagram 
for Li2 therefore looks a lot like the MO diagram for H2:

The two valence electrons of Li2 occupy a bonding molecular orbital. We would predict 
that the Li2 molecule is stable with a bond order of 1. Experiments confirm this predic-
tion. In contrast, consider the MO diagram for Be2:

The four valence electrons of Be2 occupy one bonding MO and one antibonding MO. 
The bond order is 0 and we predict that Be2 should not be stable, which is again consis-
tent with experimental findings.
The next homonuclear molecule composed of second row elements is B2, which  
has six total valence electrons to accommodate. We can approximate the next higher-
energy molecular orbitals for B2 and the rest of the period 2 diatomic molecules as linear 
The core electrons can be ignored (as 
they are in other models for bonding) 
because these electrons are held 
too tightly to individual nuclei to 
contribute significantly to chemical 
bonding.

­combinations of the 2p orbitals taken pairwise. Since the three 2p orbitals orient along 
three orthogonal axes, we must assign similar axes to the molecule. In this book, we 
assign the internuclear axis to be the x direction. Then we represent the LCAO–MOs that 
result from combining the 2px orbitals—the ones that lie along the internuclear axis—
from each atom as follows:
Atomic orbitals
Molecular orbitals
antibonding
 bonding
2px
2px
2p

2p
The bonding MO in this pair looks something like candy in a wrapper, with increased 
electron density in the internuclear region due to constructive interference between 
the two 2p atomic orbitals. It has the characteristic s shape (it is cylindrically sym-
metric about the bond axis) and is therefore called the s2p bonding orbital. The anti-
bonding orbital, called s*2p, has a node between the two nuclei (due to destructive 
interference between the two 2p orbitals) and is higher in energy than either of the 
2px orbitals.
The LCAO–MOs that result from combining the 2pz orbitals from each atom are 
­represented as follows:
Molecular orbitals
antibonding

Notice that in this case the p orbitals are added together in a side-by-side orientation (in 
contrast to the 2px orbitals, which were oriented end to end). The resultant molecular 
orbitals consequently have a different shape. The electron density in the bonding molec-
ular orbital is above and below the internuclear axis with a nodal plane that includes the 
internuclear axis. This orbital resembles the electron density distribution of a p bond in 
valence bond theory. We call this orbital the p2p orbital. The corresponding antibonding 
orbital has an additional node between the nuclei (perpendicular to the internuclear 
axis) and is called the p2p*  orbital.

The only difference between the 2py and the 2pz atomic orbitals is a 90° rotation about 
the internuclear axis. Consequently, the only difference between the resulting MOs is a 
90° rotation about the internuclear axis. The energies and the names of the bonding and 
antibonding MOs obtained from the combination of the 2py AOs are identical to those 
obtained from the combination of the 2pz AOs.
Before we can draw MO diagrams for B2 and the other second-period diatomic mole-
cules, we must determine the relative energy ordering of the MOs obtained from the 2p AO 
combinations. This is not a simple task. The relative ordering of MOs obtained from LCAO–
MO theory is usually determined computationally. There is no single order that works for 
all molecules. For second-period diatomic molecules, computations reveal that the energy 
ordering for B2, C2, and N2 is slightly different than that for O2, F2, and Ne2 as follows:

Chapter 10  Chemical Bonding II: Molecular Shapes, Valence Bond Theory, and Molecular Orbital Theory
The difference in energy ordering can only be explained by 
revisiting our LCAO–MO model. In our simplified treatment, we 
assumed that the MOs that result from the second-period AOs 
could be calculated pairwise. In other words, we took the linear 
combination of a 2s from one atom with the 2s from another, a 2px 
from one atom with a 2px from the other, and so on. However, in a 
more comprehensive treatment, the MOs are formed from linear 
combinations that include all of the AOs that are relatively close to 
each other in energy and of the correct symmetry. Specifically, in a 
more detailed treatment, the two 2s orbitals and the two 2px orbit-
als should all be combined to form a total of four molecular orbit-
als. The extent to which we include this type of mixing affects the 
energy levels of the corresponding MOs, as shown in Figure 10.14◀. 
The bottom line is that s–p mixing is significant in B2, C2, and N2 
but not in O2, F2, and Ne2. The result of the mixing is a different 
energy ordering for some of these diatomic molecules.
Figure 10.15▼ shows the MO energy diagrams for the rest of 
the second-period homonuclear diatomic molecules, as well as 
their bond orders, bond energies, and bond lengths. Notice that as 
bond order increases, the bond gets stronger (greater bond energy) 
and shorter (smaller bond length). For B2, with six electrons, the 
bond order is 1. For C2, the bond order is 2, and for N2, the bond 
order reaches a maximum with a value of 3. Recall that the Lewis 
structure for N2 has a triple bond, so both the Lewis model and 
molecular orbital theory predict a strong bond for N2, which is 
experimentally observed.

o2, F2, and ne2 because in B, C, and N the energy levels of 
the atomic orbitals are more closely spaced than in O, F, and 
Ne. This mixing produces a change in energy ordering for the 
p2p and s2p molecular orbitals.

In O2, the two additional electrons occupy antibonding 
orbitals and the bond order is 2. These two electrons are 
unpaired—they occupy the p2p*  orbitals singly with parallel spins, 
as indicated by Hund’s rule. The presence of unpaired electrons 
in the molecular orbital diagram of oxygen is significant because 
oxygen is known from experiment to be paramagnetic—it is 
attracted to a magnetic field (see Section 8.7). The paramagnet-
ism of oxygen can be demonstrated by suspending liquid oxy-
gen between the poles of a magnet. This magnetic property is 
the direct result of unpaired electrons, whose spin and movement 
around the nucleus (more accurately known as orbital angular momentum) generate tiny 
magnetic fields. When a paramagnetic substance is placed in an external magnetic field, the 
magnetic fields of each atom or molecule align with the external field, creating the attrac-
tion (much as two magnets attract each other when properly oriented). In contrast, when 
the electrons in an atom or molecule are all paired, the magnetic fields caused by electron 
spin and orbital angular momentum tend to cancel each other, resulting in diamagnetism. 
A diamagnetic substance is not attracted to a magnetic field (and is, in fact, slightly repelled).
In the Lewis structure of O2, as well as in the valence bond model of O2, all of the 
electrons seem to be paired:
▲ Liquid oxygen can be suspended 
between the poles of a magnet 
because it is paramagnetic. It 
contains unpaired electrons 
(depicted here in the inset) that 
generate tiny magnetic fields, which 
align with and interact with the 
external field.

In the MO diagram for O2, however, we can see the unpaired electrons. Molecular orbital 
theory is the more powerful theory in that it can account for the paramagnetism of O2—it 
gives us a picture of bonding that more closely corresponds to what we see in experiments. 
Continuing along the second-row homonuclear diatomic molecules, we see that F2 has a 
bond order of 1 and Ne2 has a bond order of 0, again consistent with experiment since F2 
exists and Ne2 does not.

Oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen, so its atomic orbitals are lower in 
energy than nitrogen’s atomic orbitals. When two atomic orbitals are identical and of 
equal energy, the weighting of each orbital in forming a molecular orbital is identical. 
However, when two atomic orbitals are different, the weighting of each orbital in forming 
A given orbital will have lower energy 
in a more electronegative atom. For 
this reason, electronegative atoms 
have the ability to attract electrons to 
themselves.

▲ Figure 10.16  Shape of

molecular orbital shows more 
electron density at the oxygen 
end of the molecule because the 
atomic orbitals of oxygen, the more 
electronegative element, are lower in 
energy than those of nitrogen. They 
therefore contribute more to the 
bonding molecular orbital.
a molecular orbital may be different. More specifically, when a molecular orbital is approx-
imated as a linear combination of atomic orbitals of different energies, the lower-energy 
atomic orbital makes a greater contribution to the bonding molecular orbital and the 
higher-energy atomic orbital makes a greater contribution to the antibonding molecular 
orbital. For example, notice that the s2s bonding orbital is closer in energy to the oxygen 
2s orbital than to the nitrogen 2s orbital. We can also see this unequal weighting in the 
shape of the resultant molecular orbital, in which the electron density is concentrated on 
the oxygen atom, as shown in Figure 10.16▶.

of electrons over an entire molecule is an important contribution of molecular orbital 
theory to our basic understanding of chemical bonding. For example, consider the Lewis 
structure and valence bond diagram of ozone:

In the Lewis model, we use resonance forms to represent the two equivalent bonds. In 
valence bond theory, it appears that the two oxygen–oxygen bonds should be different. In 
molecular orbital theory, however, the p molecular orbitals in ozone are formed from a 
linear combination of the three oxygen 2p orbitals and are delocalized over the entire 
molecule. The lowest energy p bonding molecular orbital is shown in the left margin.
When we examine ozone in nature, we indeed find two equivalent bonds. A similar 
situation occurs with benzene (C6H6). In the Lewis model, we represent the structure 
with two resonance forms:

In molecular orbital theory, the p molecular orbitals in benzene are formed from a linear 
combination of the six carbon 2p orbitals and are delocalized over the entire molecule. 
The lowest energy p bonding molecular orbital is shown in the left margin.
Benzene is in fact a highly symmetric molecule with six identical carbon–carbon 
bonds. The best picture of the p electrons in benzene is one in which the electrons 
occupy roughly circular-shaped orbitals above and below the plane of the molecule, as 
depicted in the molecular orbital theory approach.

Chapter 10  Chemical Bonding II: Molecular Shapes, Valence Bond Theory, and Molecular Orbital Theory
Key Concepts
Molecular Shape and VSEPR Theory (10.1–10.4)
▶
▶The properties of molecules are directly related to their shapes. In 
VSEPR theory, molecular geometries are determined by the repul-
sions between electron groups on the central atom. An electron 
group can be a single bond, double bond, triple bond, lone pair, or 
even a single electron.
▶
▶The five basic molecular shapes are linear (two electron groups), 
trigonal planar (three electron groups), tetrahedral (four electron 
groups), trigonal bipyramidal (five electron groups), and octahe-
dral (six electron groups).
▶
▶When lone pairs are present on the central atom, the electron ge-
ometry is still one of the five basic shapes, but one or more po-
sitions are occupied by lone pairs. The molecular geometry is 
therefore different from the electron geometry. Lone pairs are po-
sitioned so as to minimize repulsions with other lone pairs and 
with bonding pairs.
Polarity (10.5)
▶
▶The polarity of a polyatomic molecule containing polar bonds de-
pends on its geometry. If the dipole moments of the polar bonds 
are aligned in such a way that they cancel one another, the mol-
ecule is not polar. If they are aligned in such a way as to sum to-
gether, the molecule is polar.
▶
▶Highly symmetric molecules tend to be nonpolar, whereas asym-
metric molecules containing polar bonds tend to be polar. The po-
larity of a molecule dramatically affects its properties.
Valence Bond Theory (10.6–10.7)
▶
▶In contrast to the Lewis model, in which a covalent chemical bond 
is the sharing of electrons represented by dots, in valence bond 
theory a chemical bond is the overlap of half-filled atomic orbitals 
(or in some cases the overlap between a completely filled orbital 
and an empty one).
▶
▶The overlapping orbitals may be the standard atomic orbitals, such 
as 1s or 2p, or they may be hybridized atomic orbitals, which are 
mathematical combinations of the standard orbitals on a single 
atom. The basic hybridized orbitals are sp, sp2, sp3, sp3d, and sp3d2.
▶
▶The geometry of the molecule is determined by the geometry of 
the overlapping orbitals.
▶
▶In our treatment of valence bond theory, we use the electron 
­geometry determined by VSEPR theory to determine the correct 
hybridization scheme.
▶
▶In valence bond theory, we distinguish between two types of 
bonds, s (sigma) and p (pi). In a s bond, the orbital overlap occurs 
in the region that lies directly between the two bonding atoms. 
In a p bond, formed from the side-by-side overlap of p orbitals, 
the overlap occurs above and below the region that lies directly 
between the two bonding atoms.
▶
▶Rotation about a s bond is relatively free, whereas rotation about 
a p bond is restricted.
Molecular Orbital Theory (10.8)
▶
▶The simplest molecular orbitals are linear combinations of atomic 
orbitals (LCAOs), weighted averages of the atomic orbitals of the 
different atoms in the molecule.
▶
▶When two atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals, 
they form one molecular orbital of lower energy (the bonding  
orbital) and one of higher energy (the antibonding orbital).
▶
▶A set of molecular orbitals fills in much the same way as atomic  
orbitals.
▶
▶The stability of the molecule and the strength of the bond depend 
on the number of electrons in bonding orbitals compared to the 
number in antibonding orbitals.

Conceptual Problems
	109. 	Which statement best captures the fundamental idea behind 
VSEPR theory? Explain what is wrong with each of the other 
statements.
a.	 The angle between two or more bonds is determined primar-
ily by the repulsions between the electrons within those 
bonds and other (lone pair) electrons on the central atom of 
a molecule. Each of these electron groups (bonding electrons 
or lone pair electrons) will lower its potential energy by max-
imizing its separation from other electron groups, thus de-
termining the geometry of the molecule.
b.	The angle between two or more bonds is determined primar-
ily by the repulsions between the electrons within those 
bonds. Each of these bonding electrons will lower its poten-
tial energy by maximizing its separation from other electron 
groups, thus determining the geometry of the molecule.
c.	 The geometry of a molecule is determined by the shapes of 
the overlapping orbitals that form the chemical bonds. There-
fore, to determine the geometry of a molecule, you must 
­determine the shapes of the orbitals involved in bonding.
	110. 	Suppose that a molecule has four bonding groups and one lone 
pair on the central atom. Suppose further that the molecule is 
confined to two dimensions (this is a purely hypothetical as-
sumption for the sake of understanding the principles behind 
VSEPR theory). Make a sketch of the molecule and estimate the 
bond angles.
	111. 	How does each of the three major bonding theories (the  
Lewis model, valence bond theory, and molecular orbital  
theory) define a single chemical bond? A double bond? A  
triple bond? How are these definitions similar? How are they 
different?
	112. 	The most stable forms of the nonmetals in groups 4A, 5A, and 
6A of the second period are molecules with multiple bonds. Be-
ginning with the third period, the most stable forms of the non-

Propose an explanation for this observation based on valence 
bond theory.

Answers to Conceptual Connections
Electron Groups and Molecular Geometry
10.1	 The geometry of a molecule is determined by how the terminal 
atoms are arranged around the central atom, which is in turn 
determined by how the electron groups are arranged around 
the central atom. The electron groups on the terminal atoms do 
not affect this arrangement.
Molecular Geometry
10.2	 (a) Linear. HCN has two electron groups (the single bond and 
the triple bond) resulting in a linear geometry.
Lone Pair Electrons and Molecular 
Geometry
10.3	 (c) Positions 1 and 4 would put the greatest distance between 
the lone pairs and minimize lone pair–lone pair repulsions.
Molecular Geometry and Electron Group Repulsions
10.4	 (d) All electron groups on the central atom (or interior atoms, 
if there is more than one) determine the shape of a molecule 
according to VSEPR theory.
The Shape of Larger Molecules
10.5	 The nitrogen atom has four electron groups and one lone pair, 
as the Lewis structure shown to the right illustrates; therefore, 
the molecular geometry about the nitrogen atom is trigonal 
­pyramidal.

What Is a Chemical Bond? Part I
10.6	 (a) In the Lewis model, a covalent chemical bond is the sharing 
of electrons (represented by dots). (b) In valence bond theory, 
a covalent chemical bond is the overlap of half-filled atomic 
orbitals. (c) The answers are different because the Lewis model 
and valence bond theory are different models for ­chemical 
bonding. They both make useful and often similar predictions, 
but the assumptions of each model are different, and so are 
their respective descriptions of a chemical bond.
Number of Hybrid Orbitals Part I
10.7	
The number of sp3 hybrid orbitals is 4. You can determine 
the number of hybrid orbitals by summing the superscripts 
in the hybridization notation. For sp3, you add the implied  
1 superscript on the s to the 3 superscript on the p and you 
get 1 + 3 = 4.
Single and Double Bonds

Applying valence bond theory, we see that a double bond 
is actually composed of two different kinds of bonds, one s

and one p. The orbital overlap in the p bond is side to side 
between two p orbitals and consequently different from the 
end-to-end overlap in a s bond. Since the bonds are different 
types, the bond energy of the double bond is not just twice 
the bond energy of the single bond.
Number of Hybrid Orbitals Part II
10.9	
The number of sp hybrid orbitals is 2. You can determine 
the number of hybrid orbitals by summing the superscripts 
in the hybridization notation. For sp, you add the implied 1 
superscript on the s to the implied 1 superscript on the p and 
you get 1 + 1 = 2.
Bond Order
10.10	 The bond order is 1.5. Remember that bond order is equal to 
the number of bonding electrons minus the number of an-
tibonding electrons, all divided by two, so you get that the 
bond order = (6 - 3)>2 = 1.5.
What Is a Chemical Bond? Part II
10.11	 In MO theory, atoms will join together (or bond) when the 
electrons in the atoms can lower their energy by occupying 
the molecular orbitals of the resultant molecule. Unlike the 
Lewis model or valence bond theory, the chemical “bonds” 
in MO theory are not localized between atoms, but spread 
throughout the entire molecule.

It’s a wild dance floor there at the 
molecular level.

▲ In the absence of gravity (such 
as in a space station), a sample of 
spilled water forms a perfect 
sphere. This behavior is a direct 
result of intermolecular forces—
attractive forces that exist among 
the particles that compose matter.
R
ecall from Chapter 1 that matter  exists primarily in three states (or phases): solid, 
liquid, and gas. In Chapter 5, we examined the gas state. In this chapter we turn 
to the solid and liquid states, known collectively as the condensed states. The solid 
and liquid states are more similar to each other than they are to the gas state. In the gas 
state, constituent particles—atoms or molecules—are separated by large distances and 
do not interact with each other very much. In the condensed states, constituent parti-
cles are close together and exert moderate to strong attractive forces on one another. 
Whether a substance is a solid, liquid, or gas at a given temperature depends on the 
structure of the particles that compose the substance. Remember the theme we have 
emphasized since Chapter 1 of this book: the properties of matter are determined by the 
properties of molecules and atoms. In this chapter, we see how the structure of a partic-
ular atom or molecule determines the state in which it will exist at a given temperature.
	 11.1	 Water, No Gravity
In the space station there are no spills. When an astronaut squeezes a full water bottle, 
the water squirts out like it does on Earth, but instead of falling to the floor and forming 
a puddle, the water molecules stick together to form a floating, oscillating blob. Over 
time, the blob stops oscillating and forms a nearly perfect sphere. Why?
The reason is the main topic of this chapter: intermolecular forces, the attractive 
forces that exist among the particles that compose matter. The molecules that compose 
water are attracted to one another, much like a collection of small magnets are attracted 
to each other. These attractions hold the water together as a liquid (instead of a gas) at 

486	
Chapter 11  Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces
room temperature. These forces also cause samples of water to clump together into a 
blob, which is clearly seen in the absence of gravity. Over time, irregularities in the shape 
of the blob smooth out, and the blob becomes a sphere. The sphere is the geometrical 
shape with the lowest surface area to volume ratio. By forming a sphere, the water mole-
cules maximize their interaction with one another because the sphere results in the 
minimum number of molecules being at the surface of the liquid, where fewer interac-
tions occur (compared to the interior of the liquid).
Intermolecular forces exist, not only among water molecules, but among all particles 
that compose matter. You can see the effect of these attractive forces in the image to the 
left, which shows an astronaut touching a floating blob of water in the absence of gravity.
Notice how the water sticks to the astronaut’s finger. The water molecules experience an 
attractive force to the molecules that compose skin. This attractive force deforms the 
entire blob of water. Intermolecular forces exist among all the particles that compose matter.
Intermolecular forces are responsible for the very existence of condensed states. The 
state of a sample of matter—solid, liquid, or gas—depends on the magnitude of intermo-
lecular forces among the constituent particles relative to the amount of thermal energy 
in the sample. Recall from Chapter 6 that the molecules and atoms composing matter 
are in constant random motion that increases with increasing temperature. The energy 
associated with this motion is thermal energy. When thermal energy is high relative to 
intermolecular forces, matter tends to be gaseous. When thermal energy is low relative 
to intermolecular forces, matter tends to be liquid or solid.
	 11.2	 Solids, Liquids, and Gases: A Molecular 
Comparison
We are all familiar with solids and liquids. Water, gasoline, rubbing alcohol, and nail 
polish remover are common liquids. Ice, dry ice, and diamond are familiar solids. What 
makes these states so different?
Differences between States of Matter
To illustrate the differences between the three common states of matter, Table 11.1 lists 
the density and molar volume of water in its three different states, along with molecular 
representations of each state. Notice that the densities of the solid and liquid states are

Liquids assume the shape of their containers because the atoms or molecules that 
compose liquids are free to flow (or move around one another). When we pour water 
into a flask, the water flows and assumes the shape of the flask (Figure 11.1▶). Liquids are 
not easily compressed because the molecules or atoms that compose them are already in 
close contact—they cannot be pushed much closer together. The molecules in a gas, by 
contrast, have a great deal of space between them and are easily forced into a smaller 
volume by an increase in external pressure (Figure 11.2▼).
▲ Figure 11.1  Liquids 
Assume the Shapes of Their 
Containers  When we pour water 
into a flask, it assumes the shape of 
the flask because water molecules

much greater than the density of the gas state. Notice also that the solid and liquid states 
are more similar in density and molar volume to one another than they are to the gas 
state. The molecular representations show the reason for these differences. The molecules 
in liquid water and ice are in close contact with one another—essentially touching—
whereas those in gaseous water are separated by large distances. The molecular represen-
tation of gaseous water in Table 11.1 is actually out of proportion—the water molecules in 
the figure should be much farther apart for their size. (Only a fraction of a molecule could 
be included in the figure if it were drawn to scale.) From the molar volumes, we know 
that 18.0 mL of liquid water (slightly more than a tablespoon) occupies 30.5 L when con-
verted to gas at 100 °C (at atmospheric pressure). The low density of gaseous water is a 
direct result of this large separation between molecules.
Notice also that, for water, the solid is slightly less dense than the liquid. This is atyp-
ical behavior. Most solids are slightly denser than their corresponding liquids because 
the molecules move closer together upon freezing. As we will discuss in Section 11.9, ice 
is less dense than liquid water because the unique crystal structure of ice results in water 
molecules moving slightly farther apart upon freezing.
A major difference between liquids and solids is the freedom of movement of the 
constituent molecules or atoms. Even though the atoms or molecules in a liquid are in 
close contact, thermal energy partially overcomes the attractions between them, allow-
ing them to move around one another. This is not the case in solids; the atoms or mole-
cules in a solid are virtually locked in their positions, only vibrating back and forth 
about a fixed point. Table 11.2 summarizes the properties of liquids and solids, as well as 
the properties of gases for comparison.

Chapter 11  Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces
Solids have a definite shape because, in contrast to liquids and gases, the molecules 
or atoms that compose solids are fixed in place—each molecule or atom in a solid 
merely vibrates about a fixed point. Like liquids, solids have a definite volume and gen-
erally cannot be compressed because the molecules or atoms composing them are 
already in close contact. Solids may be crystalline, in which case the atoms or mole-
cules that compose them are arranged in a well-ordered three-dimensional array, or 
they may be amorphous, in which case the atoms or molecules that compose them 
have no long-range order (Figure 11.3▼).

and Amorphous Solids  In a

of the particles displays long-range

arrangement of the particles has no 
long-range order.
According to some definitions, an 
amorphous solid is considered a 
unique state, different from the 
normal solid state because it lacks 
any long-range order.
Changes between States
We can transform one state of matter to another by changing the temperature, pressure, 
or both. For example, we can convert solid ice to liquid water by heating, and liquid 
water to solid ice by cooling. The following diagram shows the three states of matter and 
the changes in conditions that commonly induce transitions between the states:
Heat
Cool
Heat or
reduce pressure
Cool or
increase pressure
Solid
Liquid
Gas
We can induce a transition between the liquid and gas state, not only by heating and 
cooling, but also by changing the pressure. In general, increases in pressure favor the 
denser state, so increasing the pressure of a gas sample results in a transition to the 
liquid state.
The most familiar example of this phenomenon occurs in the LP (liquefied petro-
leum) gas used as a fuel for outdoor grills and lanterns. LP gas is composed primarily 
of propane, a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. However, it liquefies 
at pressures exceeding about 2.7 atm. The propane you buy in a tank is under pressure 
and therefore in the liquid form. When you open the tank, some of the propane 
escapes as a gas, lowering the pressure in the tank for a brief moment. Immediately, 
however, some of the liquid propane evaporates, replacing the gas that escaped. Stor-
ing gases like propane as liquids is efficient because, in their liquid form, they occupy 
much less space.

	 11.3	 Intermolecular Forces: The Forces  
That Hold Condensed States Together
The structure of the particles that compose a substance determines the strength of 
the intermolecular forces that hold the substance together, which in turn determines 
whether the substance is a solid, liquid, or gas at a given temperature. At room tempera-
ture, moderate to strong intermolecular forces tend to result in liquids and solids (high 
melting and boiling points), and weak intermolecular forces tend to result in gases (low 
melting and boiling points).
Intermolecular forces originate from the interactions among charges, partial charges, 
and temporary charges on molecules (or atoms and ions), much as bonding forces origi-
nate from interactions among charged particles in atoms. Recall from Section 8.3 that 
according  to Coulomb’s law, the potential energy (E) of two oppositely charged particles 
(with charges q1 and q2) decreases (becomes more negative) with increasing magnitude of 
charge and with decreasing separation (r):
E =
1
4pe0 
q1q2
r  (When q1 and q2 are opposite in sign, E  is negative.)
Therefore, as we have seen, protons and electrons are attracted to each other because 
their potential energy decreases as they get closer together. Similarly, molecules with 
partial or temporary charges are attracted to each other because their potential energy 
decreases as they get closer together. However, intermolecular forces, even the strongest 
ones, are generally much weaker than bonding forces.
The reason for the relative weakness of intermolecular forces compared to bonding 
forces is also related to Coulomb’s law. Bonding forces are the result of large charges (the 
charges on protons and electrons) interacting at very close distances. Intermolecular 
forces are the result of smaller charges (as we shall see in the following discussion) inter-
acting at greater distances. For example, consider the interaction between two water 
molecules in liquid water:

Chapter 11  Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces
The length of an O¬ H bond in liquid water is 96 pm; however, the average distance 
between water molecules in liquid water is about 300 pm. The larger distances between 
molecules, as well as the smaller charges involved (the partial charges on the hydrogen 
and oxygen atoms), result in weaker forces. To break the O¬ H bonds in water, we have 
to heat the water to thousands of degrees Celsius. However, to completely overcome the 
intermolecular forces between water molecules, we have to heat water only to its boiling 
point, 100 °C (at sea level).
In this section we examine several different types of intermolecular forces, including 
dispersion forces, dipole–dipole forces, hydrogen bonding, and ion–dipole forces. The first 
three of these can potentially occur in all substances; the last one occurs only in mixtures.
Dispersion Force
The one intermolecular force present between all molecules and atoms is the dispersion 
force (also called the London force). Dispersion forces are the result of fluctuations in 
the electron distribution within molecules or atoms. Since all atoms and molecules have 
electrons, they all exhibit dispersion forces. The electrons in an atom or molecule may, 
at any one instant, be unevenly distributed. Imagine a frame-by-frame movie of a helium 
atom in which each “frame” captures the position of the helium atom’s two electrons:
Frame 3
Frame 2
Frame 1
δ+
δ−
The nature of dispersion forces was 
first recognized by Fritz W. London 
(1900–1954), a German-American 
physicist.
In any one frame, the electrons may not be symmetrically arranged around the 
nucleus. In frame 3, for example, helium’s two electrons are on the left side of the helium 
atom. At that instant, the left side has a slightly negative charge (d-). The right side of 
the atom, which temporarily has no electrons, has a slightly positive charge (d+) because 
of the charge of the nucleus. This fleeting charge separation is called an instantaneous 
dipole or a temporary dipole. As shown in Figure 11.4▼, an instantaneous dipole on one 
helium atom induces an instantaneous dipole on its neighboring atoms because the 
positive end of the instantaneous dipole attracts electrons in the neighboring atoms. 
The neighboring atoms then attract one another—the positive end of one instantaneous 
dipole attracting the negative end of another. This attraction is the dispersion force.

Dispersion Force
An instantaneous dipole on any one helium atom induces instantaneous
 dipoles on neighboring atoms, which then attract one another.
▶ Figure 11.4  Dispersion 
Interactions  The temporary dipole 
in one helium atom induces a 
temporary dipole in its neighbor. 
The resulting attraction between 
the positive and negative charges 
creates the dispersion force.
The magnitude of the dispersion force depends on how easily the electrons in the 
atom or molecule can move or polarize in response to an instantaneous dipole, which 
in turn depends on the size (or volume) of the electron cloud. A larger electron cloud 
To polarize means to form a dipole 
moment (see Section 9.6).

	
11.3  Intermolecular Forces: The Forces That Hold Condensed States Together

results in a greater dispersion force because the electrons are 
held less tightly by the nucleus and therefore polarize more 
easily. If all other variables are constant, the dispersion force 
increases with increasing molar mass because molecules or 
atoms of higher molar mass generally have more electrons dis-
persed over a greater volume. For example, consider the boil-
ing points of the noble gases displayed in Table 11.3. As the 
molar masses and electron cloud volumes of the noble gases 
increase, the greater dispersion forces result in increasing boil-
ing points (because the atoms are more strongly attracted to 
one another).
Molar mass alone, however, does not always exactly corre-
late with the magnitude of the dispersion force. Compare the 
molar masses and boiling points of n-pentane and neopentane:

These molecules have identical molar masses, but n-pentane has a higher boiling 
point than neopentane. Why? Because the two molecules have different shapes. The 
n-pentane molecules are long and can interact with one another along their entire 
length, as shown in Figure 11.5(a)▼. In contrast, the bulky, round shape of neopen-
tane molecules results in a smaller area of interaction between neighboring molecules, 
as shown in Figure 11.5(b)▼. The result is a lower boiling point for neopentane.

molecules allows them to interact with one another along the entire length of the molecules.  
(b) The nearly spherical shape of neopentane molecules allows for only a small area of 
interaction. Thus, dispersion forces are weaker in neopentane than in n-pentane, resulting in a 
lower boiling point.
Although we must always consider molecular shape and other factors in ­predicting 
the magnitude of dispersion forces, molar mass can act as a guide when comparing  
dispersion forces within a family of similar elements or compounds as illustrated in 
Figure 11.6▶ on the next page.

Dipole–Dipole Force
The dipole–dipole force exists between all molecules that are polar. Polar molecules

regions (which have a partial positive charge). For example, consider acetone:

regions in the molecule and that the blue areas indicate electron-poor regions.
Notice that acetone has an electron-rich region surrounding the oxygen atom 
(because oxygen is more electronegative than the rest of the molecule) and electron-
poorer regions surrounding the carbon and hydrogen atoms. The result is that acetone 
has a permanent dipole that can interact with other acetone molecules as shown in

another; this attraction is the dipole–dipole force. Polar molecules, therefore, have 
higher melting and boiling points than nonpolar molecules of similar molar mass.
Remember that all molecules (including polar ones) have dispersion forces. Polar 
molecules have, in addition, dipole–dipole forces. This additional attractive force raises 
their melting and boiling points relative to nonpolar molecules of similar molar mass.

The polarity of molecules is also important in determining the miscibility—the 
ability to mix without separating into two states—of liquids. This is especially true for 
water, which is highly polar. In general, polar liquids tend to be miscible with water, 
while nonpolar liquids are not. For example, pentane (C5H12) is nonpolar and does not 
mix with water (Figure 11.9▶ on the next page). Similarly, water and oil (nonpolar) do 
not mix. Consequently, oily hands or oily stains on clothes cannot be washed with 
plain water (see Chemistry in Your Day: How Soap Works in Section 10.5).
Formaldehyde is polar, and has a higher melting point and boiling point than nonpolar 
ethane, even though the two compounds have the same molar mass. Figure 11.8▼ shows 
the boiling points of a series of molecules with similar molar mass but progressively greater 
dipole moments. Notice that the boiling points increase with increasing dipole moment.

Dipole–Dipole Forces
Which molecules have dipole–dipole forces?
(a)	 CO2	
(b)	 CH2Cl2	
(c)	 CH4
Solution
A molecule has dipole–dipole forces if it is polar. To determine if a molecule is polar: (1) determine if the molecule contains 
polar bonds (Section 9.6); and (2) determine if the polar bonds add together to form a net dipole moment (Section 10.5).
(a)	 CO2
(1)	 Since the electronegativity of carbon is 2.5 and that of oxygen is 3.5 (see 
Figure 9.8), CO2 has polar bonds.
(2)	 The geometry of CO2 is linear. Consequently, the dipoles of the polar bonds 
cancel, so the molecule is not polar and does not have dipole–dipole forces.
No dipole forces present
O
C
O
(b)	 CH2Cl2
(1)	 The electronegativity of C is 2.5, that of H is 2.1, and that of Cl is 3.0. 
­Consequently, CH2Cl2 has two polar bonds (C¬ Cl) and two bonds that are 
nearly nonpolar (C¬ H).
(2)	 The geometry of CH2Cl2 is tetrahedral. Because the C¬ Cl bonds and the 
C¬ H bonds are different, their dipoles do not cancel but sum to a net dipole 
moment. The molecule is polar and has dipole–dipole forces.
Dipole forces present
CH2Cl2
(c)	 CH4
(1)	 The electronegativity of C is 2.5 and that of hydrogen is 2.1, so the C¬ H 
bonds are nearly nonpolar.
(2)	 In addition, since the geometry of the molecule is tetrahedral, any slight 
­polarities that the bonds might have cancel. CH4 is therefore nonpolar and 
does not have dipole–dipole forces.

molecules would interact with each other. Draw structural formulas,

geometry of the interaction.
 
Hydrogen Bonding
Polar molecules containing hydrogen atoms bonded directly to small electronegative 
atoms—most importantly fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen—exhibit an intermolecular force 
called hydrogen bonding. HF, NH3, and H2O, for example, all exhibit hydrogen bond-
ing. The hydrogen bond is a sort of super dipole–dipole force. The large electronegativity 
difference between hydrogen and any of these electronegative elements causes the hydro-
gen atom to have a fairly large partial positive charge (d+) within the bond, while the F, 
O, or N atom has a fairly large partial negative charge (d-). In addition, since these atoms 
are all quite small, the H atom on one molecule can approach the F, O, or N atom on an 
adjacent molecule very closely. The result is a strong attraction between the H atom on 
one molecule and the F, O, or N on its neighbor—an attraction called a hydrogen bond.
For example, in HF, the hydrogen atom in one molecule is strongly attracted to the 
fluorine atom on a neighboring molecule (Figure 11.10▼). The electrostatic potential 
maps in Figure 11.10 illustrate the large differences in electron density that result in 
unusually large partial charges.
Hydrogen Bonding
When H bonds directly to F, O, or N, the bonding atoms 
acquire relatively large partial charges, giving rise to strong 
dipole–dipole attractions between neighboring molecules.

Bonding in HF  The hydrogen of 
one HF molecule, with its partial

dipole interaction is an example of a 
hydrogen bond.
Hydrogen bonds should not be confused with chemical bonds. Chemical bonds occur 
between individual atoms within a molecule, whereas hydrogen bonds—like dispersion 
forces and dipole–dipole forces—are intermolecular forces that occur between molecules. 
A typical hydrogen bond is only 2–5% as strong as a typical covalent chemical bond. 
Hydrogen bonds are, however, the strongest of the three intermolecular forces we have 
discussed so far. Substances composed of molecules that form hydrogen bonds have 
higher melting and boiling points than comparable substances composed of molecules 
that do not form hydrogen bonds.

▶ Figure 11.11  Hydrogen Bonding in Ethanol   
The left side shows the space-filling models, and the right 
side shows the electrostatic potential maps.
Since ethanol contains hydrogen bonded directly to oxygen, ethanol molecules form 
hydrogen bonds with each other as shown in Figure 11.11▲. The hydrogen that is 
directly bonded to oxygen in an individual ethanol molecule is strongly attracted to the 
oxygen on neighboring molecules. This strong attraction (i.e., hydrogen bond) makes 
the boiling point of ethanol 78.3 °C. Consequently, ethanol is a liquid at room tempera-
ture. In contrast, dimethyl ether has an identical molar mass to ethanol but does not 
exhibit hydrogen bonding because in the dimethyl ether molecule, the oxygen atom is 
not bonded directly to hydrogen; this results in lower boiling and melting points, and 
dimethyl ether is a gas at room temperature.
Water is another good example of a molecule with hydrogen bonding (Figure 11.12◀). 
Figure 11.13▼ plots the boiling points of the simple hydrogen compounds of the group 4A 
and group 6A elements. In general, boiling points increase with increasing molar mass, as 
expected based on increasing dispersion forces. However, because of hydrogen bonding, 
the boiling point of water (100 °C) is much higher than expected based on its molar mass 
(18.0 g>mol). Without hydrogen bonding, all the water on our planet would be gaseous.

As a result, the strengths of their dispersion forces are similar. All three com-
pounds are also polar, so they have dipole–dipole forces. Hydrogen peroxide, 
however, is the only one of these compounds that also contains H bonded direct-
ly to F, O, or N. Therefore, it also has hydrogen bonding and is likely to have the 
highest boiling point of the three. Since the example stated that only one of the 
compounds was a liquid, it is safe to assume that hydrogen peroxide is the liquid. 
Note that, although fluoromethane contains both H and F, H is not directly bonded 
to F, so fluoromethane does not have hydrogen bonding as an intermolecular 
force. Similarly, formaldehyde contains both H and O, but H is not directly bonded 
to O, so formaldehyde does not exhibit hydrogen bonding either.
For Practice 11.2  Which has the higher boiling point, HF or HCl? Why?
Ion–Dipole Force
The ion–dipole force occurs when an ionic compound is mixed with a polar com-
pound; it is especially important in aqueous solutions of ionic compounds. For example, 
when sodium chloride is mixed with water, the sodium and chlo-
ride ions interact with water molecules via ion–dipole forces, as 
shown in Figure 11.14▶. The positive sodium ions interact with 
the negative poles of water molecules, while the negative chloride 
ions interact with the positive poles. Ion–dipole forces are the 
strongest of the types of intermolecular forces discussed and are 
responsible for the ability of ionic substances to form solutions 
with water. We discuss aqueous solutions more thoroughly in 
Chapter 13.
Summarizing Intermolecular Forces (as shown in Table 11.4 
on the next page):
▶
▶
Dispersion forces are present in all molecules and atoms and 
generally increase with increasing molar mass. These forces 
are always weak in small molecules but can be significant in 
molecules with high molar masses.
▶
▶
Dipole–dipole forces are present in polar molecules.
▶
▶
Hydrogen bonds, the strongest of the intermolecular forces 
that can occur in pure substances (second only to ion–dipole 
forces in general), are present in molecules containing hydro-
gen bonded directly to fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen.
▶
▶
Ion–dipole forces are present in mixtures of ionic compounds and polar com-
pounds. These forces are very strong and are especially important in aqueous 
solutions of ionic compounds.
Te positively charged end of a polar molecule such as 
H2O is attracted to negative ions, and the negatively 
charged end of the molecule is attracted to positive ions.

The replicating mechanism of DNA is related to 
its structure, which was discovered in 1953 by James 
Watson (1928–) and Francis Crick (1916–2004). DNA 
consists of two complementary strands wrapped 
around each other in the now famous double helix 
and linked by hydrogen bonds between the bases on 
each strand. Each base (A, T, C, and G) has a comple-
mentary partner with which it forms hydrogen bonds 
(Figure 11.16▶): adenine (A) with thymine (T) and cy-
tosine (C) with guanine (G). The hydrogen bonding is 
so specific that each base will pair only with its com-
plementary partner. When a cell is going to divide, en-
zymes unzip the DNA molecule across the hydrogen 
bonds that join its two strands (Figure 11.17▼). Then 
new bases, complementary to the bases in each 
strand, are added along each of the original strands, 
forming hydrogen bonds with their complements. The 
result is two identical copies of the original DNA.

	 11.4	 Intermolecular Forces in Action: 
Surface Tension, Viscosity, and 
Capillary Action
The most important manifestation of intermolecular forces is the very existence of liq-
uids and solids. In liquids, we also observe several other manifestations of intermolecu-
lar forces, including surface tension, viscosity, and capillary action.
Surface Tension
A fly fisherman delicately casts a small fishing fly (a metal hook with a few feathers and 
strings attached to make it look like an insect) onto the surface of a moving stream. The 
fly floats on the surface of the water—even though the metal composing the hook is

Chapter 11  Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces
Recall from Section 11.3 that the 
interactions between molecules 
lower their potential energy in much 
the same way that the interaction 
between protons and electrons lowers 
their potential energy, in accordance 
with Coulomb’s law.

surface area; its surface behaves like a “skin.”
denser than water—and attracts trout. Why? The hook floats because of surface tension, 
the tendency of liquids to minimize their surface area.
Figure 11.18▲ depicts the intermolecular forces experienced by a molecule at the 
surface of the liquid compared to those experienced by a molecule in the interior. Notice 
that a molecule at the surface has relatively fewer neighbors with which to interact, and 
it is therefore inherently less stable—it has higher potential energy—than those in the 
interior. (Remember that attractive interactions with other molecules lower potential 
energy.) In order to increase the surface area of the liquid, molecules from the interior 
have to be moved to the surface, and, because molecules at the surface have a higher 
potential energy than those in the interior, this movement requires energy. Therefore, 
liquids tend to minimize their surface area. The surface tension of a liquid is the 
energy required to increase the surface area by a unit amount. For example, at room tem-
perature, water has a surface tension of 72.8 mJ>m2—it takes 72.8 mJ to increase the sur-
face area of water by one square meter.
Why does surface tension allow the fly fisherman’s hook to float on water? The ten-
dency for liquids to minimize their surface area creates a kind of skin at the surface that 
resists penetration. For the fisherman’s hook to sink into the water, the water’s surface 
area must increase slightly—an increase that is resisted by the surface tension. We can 
observe surface tension by carefully placing a paper clip on the surface of water (Figure 
11.19◀). The paper clip, even though it is denser than water, floats on the surface of the 
water. A slight tap on the clip provides the energy necessary to overcome the surface ten-
sion and causes the clip to sink.
Surface tension decreases as intermolecular forces decrease. You can’t float a paper 
clip on benzene, for example, because the dispersion forces among the molecules com-
posing benzene are significantly weaker than the hydrogen bonds among water mole-
cules. The surface tension of benzene is only 28 mJ>m2—just 40% that of water.
Surface tension is also the reason for the behavior of water that we discussed in the 
chapter-opening section on water and gravity. You can see this behavior on Earth by 
looking at small water droplets (those not large enough to be distorted by gravity) on a 
leaf or a spider’s web (Figure 11.20◀). Just as larger samples of water form spheres in the 
space station, so smaller samples form spheres on Earth. Why? In the same way that 
gravity pulls the matter of a planet or star inward to form a sphere, intermolecular forces 
among collections of water molecules pull the water into a sphere. As we discussed in 
Section 11.1, the sphere is the geometrical shape with the smallest ratio of surface area to 
volume; therefore, the formation of a sphere minimizes the number of molecules at the 
surface, minimizing the potential energy of the system.

in Action  A paper clip floats on water

11.4  Intermolecular Forces in Action: Surface Tension, Viscosity, and Capillary Action	
501
Viscosity
Another manifestation of intermolecular forces is viscosity, the resistance of a liq-
uid to flow. Motor oil, for example, is more viscous than gasoline, and maple syrup is 
more viscous than water. Viscosity is measured in a unit called the poise (P), defined 
as 1 g>cm # s. The viscosity of water at room temperature is approximately one centi-
poise (cP). Viscosity is greater in substances with stronger intermolecular forces because 
if molecules are more strongly attracted to each other, they do not flow around each 
other as freely. Viscosity also depends on molecular shape, increasing in longer mol-
ecules that can interact over a greater area and possibly become entangled. Table 11.5 
lists the viscosity of several hydrocarbons. Notice the increase in viscosity with increas-
ing molar mass (and therefore increasing magnitude of dispersion forces) and with 
increasing length (and therefore increasing potential for molecular entanglement).
Viscosity also depends on temperature because thermal energy partially overcomes 
the intermolecular forces, allowing molecules to flow past each other more easily.  
Table 11.6 lists the viscosity of water as a function of temperature. Nearly all liquids 
become less viscous as temperature increases.

iscosity is an important property of the motor oil you put into your car. The oil must 
be thick enough to adequately coat engine surfaces to lubricate them, but also 
thin enough to be pumped easily into all the required engine compartments. Motor oil 
viscosity is usually reported on the SAE scale (named after the Society of Automotive 
Engineers). The higher the SAE rating, the more viscous the oil. The thinnest motor oils 
have SAE ratings of 5 or 10, whereas the thickest have SAE ratings of up to 50.
Before the 1950s, most automobile owners changed the oil in their engine to accom-
modate seasonal changes in weather—a higher SAE rating was required in the summer 
months and a lower rating in the winter. Today, the advent of multigrade oils allows car 
owners in many climates to keep the same oil all year long. Multigrade oils, such as the 
10W-40 oil shown at right, contain polymers (long molecules made up of repeating struc-
tural units) that coil at low temperatures but unwind at high temperatures. At low temper-
atures, the coiled polymers—because of their compact shape—do not contribute very 
much to the oil’s viscosity. As the temperature increases, however, the molecules unwind 
and their long shape results in intermolecular forces and molecular entanglements that 
prevent the oil’s viscosity from decreasing as much as it would normally. The result is an 
oil whose viscosity is less temperature-dependent than it would be otherwise, allowing the same oil to be used over a wider 
range of temperatures. The 10W-40 designation indicates that the oil has an SAE rating of 10 at low temperatures and 40 at 
high temperatures.
Capillary Action
Medical technicians take advantage of capillary action—the ability of a liquid to 
flow against gravity up a narrow tube—when taking a blood sample. The technician 
pokes the patient’s finger with a pin, squeezes some blood out of the puncture, and 

502	
Chapter 11  Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces
then collects the blood with a thin tube. When the tube’s tip comes into contact with 
the blood, the blood is drawn into the tube by capillary action. The same force helps 
trees and plants draw water from the soil.
Capillary action results from a combination of two forces: the attraction 
between molecules in a liquid, called cohesive forces, and the attraction between these 
molecules and the surface of the tube, called adhesive forces. The adhesive forces 
cause the liquid to spread out over the surface of the tube, whereas the cohesive 
forces cause the liquid to stay together. If the adhesive forces are greater than the 
cohesive forces (as is the case for water in a glass tube), the attraction to the surface 
draws the liquid up the tube and the cohesive forces pull along those molecules not 
in direct contact with the tube walls (Figure 11.21◀). The water rises up the tube 
until the force of gravity balances the capillary action—the thinner the tube, the 
higher the rise. If the adhesive forces are less 
than the cohesive forces (as is the case for liquid 
mercury), the liquid does not rise up the tube at 
all (and in fact drops to a level below the level of 
the surrounding liquid).
We can see the result of the differences in the 
relative magnitudes of cohesive and adhesive 
forces by comparing the meniscus of water to the 
meniscus of mercury (Figure 11.22▶). (The 
meniscus is the curved shape of a liquid surface 
within a tube.) The meniscus of water is concave 
(rounded inward) because the adhesive forces are 
greater than the cohesive forces, causing the 
edges of the water to creep up the sides of the 
tube a bit, forming the familiar cupped shape. 
The meniscus of mercury is convex (rounded 
outward) because the cohesive forces—due to 
metallic bonding between the atoms—are greater 
than the adhesive forces. The mercury atoms 
crowd toward the interior of the liquid to maxi-
mize their interactions with each other, resulting 
in the upward bulge at the center of the surface.
	 11.5	 Vaporization and Vapor Pressure
We now turn our attention to vaporization, the process by which thermal energy can 
overcome intermolecular forces and produce a state change from liquid to gas. We first 
discuss the process of vaporization itself, then the energetics of vaporization, and finally 
the concepts of vapor pressure, dynamic equilibrium, and critical point. Vaporization is a 
common occurrence that we experience every day and even depend on to maintain 
proper body temperature.
The Process of Vaporization
Imagine water molecules in a beaker at room temperature and open to the atmosphere 
(Figure 11.23◀). The molecules are in constant motion due to thermal energy. If we 
could actually see the molecules at the surface, we would witness what ­theoretical 
chemist Roald Hoffmann describes as a “wild dance floor” (see the ­chapter-opening 
quote) because of all the vibrating, jostling, and molecular movement. The higher 
the temperature, the greater the average energy of the collection of ­molecules. However, at 
any one time, some molecules have more thermal energy than the average and some 
have less.
The distributions of thermal energies for the molecules in a sample of water at 
two different temperatures are shown in Figure 11.24▶. The molecules at the high end 
of the distribution curve have enough energy to break free from the surface—where 
▲ Blood is drawn into a capillary 
tube by capillary action.
▲ Figure 11.22  Meniscuses of 
Water and Mercury  The meniscus 
of water is concave because 
water molecules are more strongly 
attracted to the glass wall than 
to one another. The meniscus of 
mercury is convex because mercury 
atoms are more strongly attracted to 
one another than to the glass walls.
▲ Figure 11.21  Capillary 
Action  The attraction of water mol-
ecules to the glass surface draws 
the liquid around the edge of the 
tube up the walls. The water in the 
rest of the column is pulled along by 
the attraction of water molecules to 
one another. As can be seen in this 
figure, the narrower the tube, the 
higher the liquid will rise.

molecules are held less tightly than they are in the interior due to fewer neighbor–
neighbor interactions—and into the gas state. This transition, from liquid to gas, is 
known as vaporization. Some of the water molecules in the gas state, at the low end 
of the energy distribution curve for the gaseous molecules, plunge back into the water 
and are captured by intermolecular forces. This transition, from gas to liquid, is the 
opposite of vaporization and is called condensation.
Although both vaporization and condensation occur in a beaker open to the atmo-
sphere, under normal conditions (such as relatively dry air at room temperature) evapo-
ration takes place at a greater rate because most of the newly evaporated molecules 
escape into the surrounding atmosphere and never come back. The result is a noticeable 
decrease in the water level within an open beaker over time (usually several days).
What happens if we increase the temperature of the water within the beaker? 
Because of the shift in the energy distribution to higher energies (see Figure 11.24), more 
molecules now have enough energy to break free and evaporate, so vaporization occurs 
more quickly. What happens if we spill the water on the table or floor? The same amount 
of water is now spread over a wider area, resulting in more molecules at the surface of the 
liquid. Since molecules at the surface have the greatest tendency to evaporate—because 
they are held less tightly—vaporization also occurs more quickly in this case. You prob-
ably know from experience that water in a beaker or glass may take many days to evapo-
rate completely, whereas the same amount of water spilled on a table or floor typically 
evaporates within a few hours (depending on the exact conditions).
What happens if the liquid in the beaker is not water, but some other substance 
with weaker intermolecular forces, such as acetone (the main component in nail polish 
remover)? The weaker intermolecular forces allow more molecules to evaporate at a 
given temperature, increasing the rate of vaporization. We call liquids that vaporize eas-
ily volatile and those that do not vaporize easily nonvolatile. Acetone is more volatile 
than water. Motor oil is virtually nonvolatile at room temperature.
Summarizing the Process of Vaporization:
▶
▶
The rate of vaporization increases with increasing temperature.
▶
▶
The rate of vaporization increases with increasing surface area.
▶
▶
The rate of vaporization increases with decreasing strength of intermolecular forces.
The Energetics of Vaporization
To understand the energetics of vaporization, consider again a beaker of water from the 
molecular point of view, except now imagine that the beaker is thermally insulated so 
that heat from the surroundings cannot enter the beaker. What happens to the temper-
ature of the water left in the beaker as molecules evaporate? To answer this question, 

504	
Chapter 11  Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces
think about the energy distribution curve again (see Figure 11.24). The molecules that 
leave the beaker are the ones at the high end of the energy curve—the most energetic. If 
no additional heat enters the beaker, the average energy of the entire collection of mol-
ecules decreases—much as the class average on an exam goes down if you eliminate the 
highest-scoring students. So vaporization is an endothermic process; it takes energy to 
vaporize the molecules in a liquid. Another way to understand the endothermicity of 
vaporization is to remember that vaporization requires overcoming the intermolecular 
forces that hold liquids together. Since energy is needed to pull the molecules away from 
one another, the process is endothermic.
Our bodies use the endothermic nature of vaporization for cooling. When we over-
heat, we sweat and our skin is covered with liquid water. As this water evaporates, it 
absorbs heat from the body, cooling the skin. A fan makes us feel cooler because it blows 
newly vaporized water away from our skin, allowing more sweat to vaporize and causing 
even more cooling. High humidity, in contrast, slows down the net rate of evaporation, 
preventing cooling. When the air already contains large amounts of water vapor, the 
sweat evaporates more slowly, making the body’s cooling system less efficient.
Condensation, the opposite of vaporization, is exothermic—heat is released when a gas 
condenses to a liquid. If you have ever accidentally put your hand above a steaming kettle or 
opened a bag of microwaved popcorn too soon, you may have experienced a steam burn. As 
the steam condenses to a liquid on your skin, it releases a lot of heat, causing the burn. The 
condensation of water vapor is also the reason that winter overnight temperatures in coastal 
regions, which tend to have water vapor in the air, do not get as low as in deserts, which 
tend to have dry air. As the air temperature in a coastal area drops, water condenses out of 
the air, releasing heat and preventing the temperature from dropping further. In deserts, 
the air contains almost no moisture to condense, so the temperature drop is more extreme.
The amount of heat required to vaporize one mole of a liquid to gas is its heat (or 
enthalpy) of vaporization (𝚫Hvap). The heat of vaporization of water at its normal 
boiling point of 100 °C is +40.7 kJ>mol:
H2O(l) ¡ H2O(g) ∆Hvap = +40.7 kJ>mol
The heat of vaporization is always positive because the process is endothermic—
energy must be absorbed to vaporize a substance. The heat of vaporization is some-
what temperature dependent. For example, at 25 °C the heat of vaporization of water is 
+44.0 kJ>mol, slightly more than it is at 100 °C because the water contains less ther-
mal energy at 25 °C. Table 11.7 lists the heats of vaporization of several liquids at their 
boiling points and at 25 °C.
When a substance condenses from a gas to a liquid, the same amount of heat is 
involved, but the heat is emitted rather than absorbed:
H2O(g) ¡ H2O(l) ∆H = -∆Hvap = -40.7 kJ (at 100 °C)
When one mole of water condenses, it releases 40.7 kJ of heat. The sign of ∆H in this 
case is negative because the process is exothermic.
We can use the heat of vaporization of a liquid to calculate the amount of energy 
required to vaporize a given mass of the liquid (or the amount of heat given off by the 
condensation of a given mass of liquid), using concepts similar to those covered in Sec-
tion 6.6 (stoichiometry of ∆H). The heat of vaporization is like a conversion factor 
between the number of moles of a liquid and the amount of heat required to vaporize it 
(or the amount of heat emitted when it condenses), as demonstrated in Example 11.3.
See Chapter 6 to review endothermic 
and exothermic processes.
▲ When we sweat, water evaporates 
from the skin. Since evaporation is 
endothermic, the result is a cooling 
effect.
The normal boiling point of a 
substance is its boiling point at a 
pressure of 1 atm, as discussed later 
in this section.
The sign conventions of ∆H were 
introduced in Chapter 6.

Vapor Pressure and Dynamic Equilibrium
We have already seen that if a container of water is left uncovered at room tempera-
ture, the water slowly evaporates away. What happens if the container is sealed? Imag-
ine a sealed evacuated flask—one from which the air has been removed—containing 
liquid water, as shown in Figure 11.25▼. Initially, the water molecules evaporate, as

condensation, dynamic equilibrium is reached.

Chapter 11  Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces
they did in the open beaker. But because of the seal, the evaporated molecules can-
not escape into the atmosphere. As water molecules enter the gas state, some start 
condensing back into the liquid. As the concentration (or partial pressure) of gas-
eous water molecules increases, the rate of condensation also increases. However, 
as long as the water remains at a constant temperature, the rate of evaporation 
remains constant. Eventually, the rate of condensation and the rate of vaporiza-
tion become equal—dynamic equilibrium has been reached (Figure 11.26◀). 
Condensation and vaporization continue at equal rates, and the concentration of 
water vapor above the liquid is constant.
The pressure of a gas in dynamic equilibrium with its liquid is its vapor 
pressure. The vapor pressure of a particular liquid depends on the intermolecu-
lar forces present in the liquid and the temperature. Weak intermolecular forces 
result in volatile (easily vaporizable) substances with high vapor pressures at a 
given temperature because the intermolecular forces are easily overcome by ther-
mal energy. Strong intermolecular forces result in nonvolatile substances with 
low vapor pressures at a given temperature.
A liquid in dynamic equilibrium with its vapor is a balanced system that tends to 
return to equilibrium if disturbed. For example, consider a sample of n-pentane (a compo-
nent of gasoline) at 25 °C in a cylinder equipped with a moveable piston (Figure 11.27(a)▼). 
The cylinder contains no other gases except n-pentane vapor in dynamic equilibrium with 
the liquid. Since the vapor pressure of n-pentane at 25 °C is 510 mmHg, the pressure in the 
cylinder is 510 mmHg.
Now, what happens when the piston is moved upward to expand the volume within 
the cylinder? Initially, the pressure in the cylinder drops below 510 mmHg, in accor-
dance with Boyle’s law. Then, however, more liquid vaporizes until equilibrium is 
reached once again (Figure 11.27(b)▼). If the volume of the cylinder is expanded again, 
the same thing happens—the pressure initially drops and more n-pentane vaporizes to 
bring the system back into equilibrium. Further expansion causes the same result as long 
as some liquid n-pentane remains in the cylinder.
Conversely, what happens if the piston is lowered, decreasing the volume in the cyl-
inder? Initially, the pressure in the cylinder rises above 510 mmHg, but then some of the 
gas condenses into liquid until equilibrium is reached again (Figure 11.27(c)▼).

11.5  Vaporization and Vapor Pressure

We describe the tendency of a system in dynamic equilibrium to return to equilib-
rium with the following general statement:
When a system in dynamic equilibrium is disturbed, the system 
responds so as to minimize the disturbance and return to a state of 
equilibrium.
If the pressure above a liquid–vapor system in equilibrium decreases, some of the liq-
uid evaporates, restoring the equilibrium pressure. If the pressure increases, some of 
the vapor condenses, bringing the pressure back down to the equilibrium pressure. 
This basic principle—Le Châtelier’s principle—is applicable to any chemical system in 
equilibrium, as we shall see in Chapter 15.

Vapor Pressure  What happens to the vapor pressure of a substance when its 
surface area is increased at constant temperature?
(a)	 The vapor pressure increases.
(b)	 The vapor pressure remains the same.
(c)	 The vapor pressure decreases.
 
Temperature Dependence of Vapor Pressure and Boiling Point
When the temperature of a liquid increases, its vapor pressure rises because the 
higher thermal energy increases the number of molecules that have enough energy 
to vaporize (see Figure 11.24). Because of the shape of the thermal energy distribu-
tion curve, a small change in temperature makes a large difference in the number of 
molecules that have enough energy to vaporize, which results in a large increase in 
vapor pressure. For example, the vapor pressure of water at 25 °C is 23.3 torr, while at 
60 °C the vapor pressure is 149.4 torr. Figure 11.28▼ plots the vapor pressure of water 
and several other liquids as a function of temperature.
The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the liquid’s vapor pressure 
equals the external pressure. When a liquid reaches its boiling point, the thermal energy is 
enough for molecules in the interior of the liquid (not just those at the surface) to break

free of their neighbors and enter the gas state (Figure 11.29▲). The bubbles in boiling 
water are pockets of gaseous water that form within the liquid water. The bubbles float to 
the surface and leave as gaseous water or steam.
The normal boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor pressure 
equals 1 atm. The normal boiling point of pure water is 100 °C. However, at a lower pres-
sure, water boils at a lower temperature. In Denver, Colorado, where the altitude is 
around 1600 meters (5200 feet) above sea level, for example, the average atmospheric 
pressure is about 83% of what it is at sea level, and water boils at approximately 94 °C. 
For this reason, it takes slightly longer to cook food in boiling water in Denver than in 
San Francisco (which is at sea level). Table 11.8 lists the boiling point of water at several 
locations of varied altitudes.

*The atmospheric pressure in each of these locations is subject to weather conditions and can vary significantly from these values.
Once the boiling point of a liquid is reached, additional heating only 
causes more rapid boiling; it does not raise the temperature of the liquid 
above its boiling point, as shown in the heating curve in Figure 11.30◀. 
Therefore, at 1 atm, boiling water always has a temperature of 100 °C. As 
long as liquid water is present, its temperature cannot rise above its boiling 
point. After all the water has been converted to steam, the temperature of 
the steam can continue to rise beyond 100 °C.
The Clausius–Clapeyron Equation
Now, let’s return our attention to Figure 11.28. As we can see from the 
graph, the vapor pressure of a liquid increases with increasing temper-
ature. However, the relationship is not linear. In other words, doubling 
the temperature results in more than doubling the vapor pressure.

Sometimes you see bubbles begin 
to form in hot water below 100 °C. 
These bubbles are dissolved air—not 
gaseous water—leaving the liquid. 
Dissolved air comes out of water as 
you heat it because the solubility 
of a gas in a liquid decreases with 
increasing temperature (as we will 
see in Chapter 13).

	
11.5  Vaporization and Vapor Pressure	
509
The relationship between vapor pressure and temperature is exponential, and we can 
express it as follows:
	
Pvap = b expa
-∆Hvap
RT
b
[11.1]
In this expression Pvap is the vapor pressure, b is a constant that depends on the gas, 
∆Hvap is the heat of vaporization, R is the gas constant (8.314 J>mol # Κ), and T is the 
temperature in kelvins. We can rearrange Equation 11.1 by taking the natural logarithm 
of both sides:
	
ln Pvap =  ln c b expa
-∆Hvap
RT
b d 
[11.2]
Because ln AB = ln A + ln B, we can rearrange the right side of Equation 11.2:
	
ln Pvap = ln b + ln c expa
-∆Hvap
RT
b d 
[11.3]
Because ln e x = x (see Appendix IB), we can simplify Equation 11.3:
	
ln Pvap = ln b +

Clausius–Clapeyron equation
	
y = m(x) + b	
(equation for a line)
Notice the parallel relationship between the Clausius–Clapeyron equation and 
the equation for a straight line. Just as a plot of y versus x yields a straight line with slope 
m and intercept b, so a plot of ln Pvap (equivalent to y) versus 1>T (equivalent to x) gives a 
straight line with slope -∆Hvap>R (equivalent to m) and y-intercept ln b (equivalent to 
b), as shown in Figure 11.31▼. The Clausius–Clapeyron equation gives a linear relation-
ship—not between the vapor pressure and the temperature (which have an exponential 
relationship)—but between the natural log of the vapor pressure and the inverse of tem-
perature. This is a common technique in the analysis of chemical data. If two variables 
are not linearly related, it is often convenient to find ways to graph functions of those 
variables that are linearly related.
Using the Clausius–Clapeyron 
equation in this way ignores 
the relatively small temperature 
dependence of ∆Hvap.

The Clausius–Clapeyron equation leads to a convenient way to determine the heat 
of vaporization in the laboratory. We simply measure the vapor pressure of a liquid as a 
function of temperature and create a plot of the natural log of the vapor pressure versus 
the inverse of the temperature. We then determine the slope of the line to find the heat 
of vaporization, as demonstrated in Example 11.4.

To find the heat of vaporization, use an Excel spreadsheet or a graphing

of the inverse of the temperature in kelvins (1>T). Then fit the points to 
a line and determine the slope of the line. The slope of the best-fitting 
line is -3773 K. Since the slope equals -∆Hvap>R, we find the heat of 
vaporization as follows:
 slope = -∆Hvap>R
 ∆Hvap = -slope * R
 = -(-3773 K)(8.314 J>mol # K)
 = 3.14 * 104 J>mol
 = 31.4 kJ>mol

The two-point method is generally 
inferior to plotting multiple points 
because fewer data points result in 
more chance for error.

The Critical Point: The Transition to an Unusual  
State of Matter
We have considered the vaporization of a liquid in a container open to the atmosphere 
with and without heating, and the vaporization of a liquid in a sealed container without 
heating. We now examine the vaporization of a liquid in a sealed container during heating.
Consider liquid n-pentane in equilibrium with its vapor in a sealed container 
­initially at 25 °C. At this temperature, the vapor pressure of n-pentane is 0.67 atm. 

512	
Chapter 11  Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces
What happens if we heat the liquid? As the temperature rises, more n-pentane 
vaporizes and the pressure within the container increases. At 100 °C, the pressure is 
5.5 atm, and at 190 °C the pressure is 29 atm. As the temperature and pressure 
increase, more and more gaseous n-pentane is forced into the same amount of space, 
and the density of the gas gets higher and higher. At the same time, the increasing 
temperature causes the density of the liquid to become lower and lower. At 197 °C, 
the meniscus between the liquid and gaseous n-pentane disappears, and the gas and 
liquid states commingle to form a supercritical fluid (Figure 11.32▼). For any sub-
stance, the temperature at which this transition occurs is the critical temperature 
(Tc). The liquid cannot exist (regardless of pressure) above this temperature. The­  
pressure at which this transition occurs is the critical pressure (Pc).

Researchers are interested in supercritical fluids because of their unique proper-
ties. A supercritical fluid has properties of both liquids and gases—it is in some sense 
intermediate between the two. Supercritical fluids can act as good solvents, selectively 
dissolving a number of compounds. For example, supercritical carbon dioxide is used 
as a solvent to extract caffeine from coffee beans. The caffeine dissolves in the super-
critical carbon dioxide, but other substances—such as those responsible for the flavor 
of coffee—do not. Consequently, the caffeine is removed and the flavor of the coffee is 
not substantially altered. The supercritical carbon dioxide is easily removed from the 
mixture by simply lowering the pressure below the critical pressure, at which point the 
carbon dioxide evaporates, leaving no residue.
	 11.6	 Sublimation and Fusion
In Section 11.5, we examined a beaker of liquid water at room temperature from the 
molecular viewpoint. Now, let’s examine a block of ice at -10 °C from the same molec-
ular perspective, paying close attention to two common processes: sublimation and 
fusion.
Sublimation
Even though a block of ice is solid, the water molecules in the ice have thermal energy, 
which causes each one to vibrate about a fixed point. The motion is much less vigorous 
than in a liquid, but it is significant nonetheless. As in liquids, at any instant some mol-
ecules in the block of ice have more thermal energy than the average and some have less. 
The molecules with high enough thermal energy can break free from the ice surface—
where, as in liquids, molecules are held less tightly than in the interior due to fewer 
neighbor–neighbor interactions—and go directly into the gas state (Figure 11.33◀). This 
process is sublimation, the transition from solid to gas. Some of the water molecules 
in the gas state (those at the low end of the energy distribution curve for the gaseous

undergoes a transition to a supercritical fluid. At the critical point, the meniscus separating the 
liquid and gas disappears, and the fluid becomes supercritical—neither a liquid nor a gas.

­molecules) collide with the surface of the ice and are captured by the intermolecular 
forces with other molecules. This process—the opposite of sublimation—is ­deposition, 
the transition from gas to solid. As is the case with liquids, the pressure of a gas in 
dynamic equilibrium with its solid is the vapor pressure of the solid.
Although both sublimation and deposition occur on the surface of an ice block 
open to the atmosphere at -10 °C, sublimation usually occurs at a greater rate than 
deposition because most of the newly sublimed molecules escape into the surrounding 
atmosphere and never come back. The result is a noticeable decrease in the size of the ice 
block over time (even though the temperature is below the melting point).
If you live in a cold climate, you may have noticed the disappearance of ice and 
snow from the ground even though the temperature remains below 0 °C. Similarly, ice 
cubes left in the freezer for a long time slowly shrink, even though the freezer is 
always below 0 °C. In both cases, the ice is subliming, turning directly into water 
vapor. Ice also sublimes out of frozen foods. You may have noticed, for example, the 
gradual growth of ice crystals on the inside of airtight plastic food-storage bags in a 
freezer. The ice crystals are composed of water that has sublimed out of the food and 
redeposited on the surface of the bag or on the surface of the food. For this reason, 
food that remains frozen for too long becomes dried out. Such dehydration can be 
avoided to some degree by freezing foods to colder temperatures, a process called 
deep-freezing. The colder temperature lowers the vapor pressure of ice and preserves 
the food longer. Freezer burn on meats is another common manifestation of sublima-
tion. When you improperly store meat (for example, in a container that is not air-
tight) sublimation continues unabated. The result is the dehydration of the surface of 
the meat, which becomes discolored and loses flavor and texture.
A substance commonly associated with sublimation is solid carbon dioxide or dry 
ice, which does not melt under atmospheric pressure no matter what the temperature is. 
However, at -78 °C the CO2 molecules have enough energy to leave the surface of the 
dry ice and become gaseous through sublimation.
Fusion
Let’s return to our ice block and examine what happens at the molecular 
level as we increase its temperature. The increasing thermal energy causes the 
water molecules to vibrate faster and faster. At the melting point (0 °C for 
water), the molecules have enough thermal energy to overcome the intermo-
lecular forces that hold the molecules at their stationary points, and the solid 
turns into a liquid. This process is ­melting or fusion, the transition from 
solid to liquid. The opposite of melting is freezing, the transition from liq-
uid to solid. Once the melting point of a solid is reached, additional heating 
only causes more rapid melting; it does not raise the temperature of the solid 
above its melting point (Figure 11.34▶). Only after all of the ice has melted 
will additional heating raise the temperature of the liquid water past 0 °C. A 
mixture of water and ice always has a temperature of 0 °C (at 1 atm pressure).
Energetics of Melting and Freezing
The most common way to cool a beverage quickly is to drop several ice cubes into it. As 
the ice melts, the drink cools because melting is endothermic—the melting ice absorbs 
heat from the liquid. The amount of heat required to melt 1 mol of a solid is the heat of 
fusion (𝚫Hfus). The heat of fusion for water is 6.02 kJ>mol:
H2O(s) ¡ H2O(l)  ∆Hfus = 6.02 kJ>mol
The heat of fusion is positive because melting is endothermic.
Freezing, the opposite of melting, is exothermic—heat is released when a liquid 
freezes into a solid. For example, as water in the freezer turns into ice, it releases heat, 
which must be removed by the refrigeration system of the freezer. If the refrigeration 
system did not remove the heat, the water would not completely freeze into ice. The heat

ing. The change in enthalpy for freezing has the same magnitude as the heat of fusion 
but the opposite sign:

Different substances have different heats of fusion as listed in Table 11.9.

In general, the heat of fusion for a substance is signifi-
cantly less than its heat of vaporization (Figure 11.35◀). We 
have already seen that the solid and liquid states are closer to 
each other in many ways than they are to the gas state. It takes 
less energy to melt 1 mol of ice into liquid than it does to vapor-
ize 1 mol of liquid water into gas because vaporization requires 
complete separation of molecules from one another, so the 
intermolecular forces must be completely overcome. Melting, 
in contrast, requires that intermolecular forces be only par-
tially overcome, allowing molecules to move around one 
another while still remaining in contact.
The amount of heat required to sublime one mole of a 
solid to a gas is its heat (or enthalpy) of sublimation 
(𝚫Hsub). Since enthalpy is a state function, the change in 
enthalpy of any two-step process is simply the sum of the 
changes in enthalpies of each step. Because the sublimation of 
a substance is equivalent to its fusion followed by its vaporiza-
tion, the heat of sublimation is the sum of the heat of fusion and the heat of vaporiza-
tion. For water, we calculate the heat of sublimation at 0 °C as follows:
 ∆Hsub = ∆Hfus + ∆Hvap
 = 6.01 kJ>mol + 40.7 kJ>mol
 = 46.7 kJ>mol
	 11.7	 Heating Curve for Water
We can combine and build on the concepts from Sections 11.5 and 11.6 by examining 
the heating curve for 1.00 mol of water at 1.00 atm pressure shown in Figure 11.36▶. The 
y-axis of the heating curve represents the temperature of the water sample. The x-axis 
represents the amount of heat added (in kilojoules) during heating. In the diagram, we 
divide the process into five segments: (1) ice warming; (2) ice melting into liquid water; 
(3) liquid water warming; (4) liquid water vaporizing into steam; and (5) steam warming.
In two of these segments (2 and 4) the temperature is constant as heat is added 
because the added heat goes into producing the transition between states, not into 
increasing the temperature. The two states are in equilibrium during the transition, and 
the temperature remains constant. The amount of heat required to achieve the state 
change is given by q = n∆H.

In the other three segments (1, 3, and 5), temperature increases linearly. These 
segments represent the heating of a single state in which the deposited heat raises the 
temperature in accordance with the substance’s heat capacity (q = mCs ∆T). We 
examine each of these segments individually.
Segment 1
In segment 1, solid ice is warmed from -25 °C to 0 °C. Since no transition between states 
occurs here, the amount of heat required to heat the solid ice is given by q = mCs ∆T 
(see Section 6.4), where Cs is the specific heat capacity of ice (Cs, ice = 2.09 J>g # °C). For 
1.00 mol of water (18.0 g), we calculate the amount of heat as follows:
 q = mC s, ice  ∆T
 = 18.0 ga2.09 
J
g # °C b[0.0 °C - (-25.0 °C)]
 = 941 J = 0.941 kJ
So in segment 1, 0.941 kJ of heat is added to the ice, warming it from -25° C to 0 °C.
Segment 2
In segment 2, the added heat does not change the temperature of the ice and water mix-
ture because the heat is absorbed by the transition from solid to liquid. The amount of 

516	
Chapter 11  Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces
heat required to convert the ice to liquid water is given by q = n ∆H fus, where n is the 
number of moles of water and ∆H fus  is the heat of fusion (see Section 11.6):
 q = n ∆H fus
 = 1.00 mol a 6.02 kJ
mol b
 = 6.02 kJ
In segment 2, 6.02 kJ is added to the ice, melting it into liquid water. Notice that the 
temperature does not change during melting. The liquid and solid coexist at 0 °C as the 
melting occurs.
Segment 3
In segment 3, the liquid water warms from 0 °C to 100 °C. Since no transition between 
states occurs here, the amount of heat required to heat the liquid water is given by 
q = mC s ∆T, as in segment 1. However, now we must use the heat capacity of liq-
uid water (not ice) for the calculation. For 1.00 mol of water (18.0 g), we calculate the 
amount of heat as follows:
 q = mCs, liq ∆T
 = 18.0 g a4.18
J
g # °C b(100.0 °C - 0.0 °C)
 = 7.52 * 103 J = 7.52 kJ
So in segment 3, 7.52 kJ of heat is added to the liquid water, warming it from 0 °C to 100 °C.
Segment 4
In segment 4, the water undergoes a second transition between states, this time from 
liquid to gas. The amount of heat required to convert the liquid to gas is given by 
q = n ∆Hvap, where n is the number of moles and ∆Hvap is the heat of vaporization (see 
Section 11.5):
 q = n ∆Hvap
 = 1.00 mol a 40.7 kJ
mol b
 = 40.7 kJ
Thus, in segment 4, 40.7 kJ is added to the water, vaporizing it into steam. Notice that 
the temperature does not change during boiling. The liquid and gas coexist at 100 °C as 
the boiling occurs.
Segment 5
In segment 5, the steam warms from 100 °C to 125 °C. Since no transition between states 
occurs here, the amount of heat required to heat the steam is given by q = mC s ∆T (as 
in segments 1 and 3) except that we must use the heat capacity of steam (2.01 J>g # °C):
 q = mCs, steam ∆T
 = 18.0 g a2.01
J
g # °C b(125.0 °C - 100.0 °C)
 = 905 J = 0.905 kJ
So in segment 5, 0.905 kJ of heat is added to the steam, warming it from 100 °C to 125 °C.

	 11.8	 Phase Diagrams
Throughout most of this chapter, we have examined how the state of a substance 
changes in response to changes in temperature and pressure. We can combine both the 
temperature dependence and pressure dependence of the state of a particular substance 
in a graph called a phase diagram. A phase diagram is a map of the state or phase of a 
substance as a function of pressure (on the y-axis) and temperature (on the x-axis). In 
this section of the chapter, we first examine the major features of a phase diagram, then 
turn to navigating within a phase diagram, and finally examine and compare the phase 
diagrams of selected substances.
The Major Features of a Phase Diagram
We can introduce the major features of a phase diagram by examining the phase dia-
gram for water as an example (Figure 11.37▼). The y-axis displays the pressure in torr and 
the x-axis displays the temperature in degrees Celsius. We categorize the main features of 
the phase diagram as regions, lines, and points.

Regions
Each of the three main regions—solid, liquid, and gas—in the phase diagram represents conditions 
under which that particular state is stable. For example, under any of the temperatures and 
pressures within the liquid region in the phase diagram of water, the liquid is the stable 
state. Notice that the point 25 °C and 760 torr falls within the liquid region, as we know 
from everyday experience. In general, low temperature and high pressure favor the solid 
state, high temperature and low pressure favor the gas state, and intermediate conditions

favor the liquid state. A sample of matter that is not in the state indicated by its phase dia-
gram for a given set of conditions converts to that state when those conditions are imposed. 
For example, steam that is cooled to room temperature at 1 atm condenses to liquid.
Lines
Each of the lines (or curves) in the phase diagram represents a set of temperatures and pressures 
at which the substance is in equilibrium between the two states on either side of the line. In 
the phase diagram for water shown in Figure 11.37, consider the curved line beginning 
just beyond 0 °C separating the liquid from the gas. This line is the vaporization curve 
(also called the vapor pressure curve) for water that we examined in Section 11.5. At any 
of the temperatures and pressures that fall along this line, the liquid and gas states of 
water are equally stable and in equilibrium. For example, at 100 °C and 760 torr pressure, 
water and its vapor are in equilibrium—they are equally stable and coexist. The other 
two major lines in a phase diagram are the sublimation curve (separating the solid and the 
gas) and the fusion curve (separating the solid and the liquid).
The Triple Point
The triple point in a phase diagram represents the unique set of conditions at which the three 
states are equally stable and in equilibrium. In the phase diagram for water, the triple point 
occurs at 0.0098 °C and 4.58 torr. Under these unique conditions (and only under these 
conditions), the solid, liquid, and gas states of water are equally stable and coexist in 
equilibrium.
The Critical Point
As we discussed in Section 11.5, at the critical temperature and pressure, the liquid and 
gas states coalesce into a supercritical fluid. The critical point in a phase diagram repre-
sents the temperature and pressure above which a supercritical fluid exists.
Navigation within a Phase Diagram
We can represent changes in the temperature or pressure of a sample of water as move-
ment within the phase diagram. For example, suppose we heat a block of ice initially 
at 1.0 atm and -25 °C. We represent the change in temperature at constant pressure as 
movement along the line marked A in Figure 11.38▼. As the temperature rises, we move 
to the right along the line. At the fusion curve, the temperature stops rising and melting

occurs until the solid ice is completely converted to liquid water. Crossing the fusion 
curve requires the complete transition from solid to liquid. Once the ice has completely 
melted, the temperature of the liquid water can begin to rise until the vaporization curve 
is reached. At this point, the temperature again stops rising and boiling occurs until all 
the liquid is converted to gas.
We represent a change in pressure with a vertical line on the phase diagram. For 
example, suppose we lower the pressure above a sample of water initially at 1.0 atm and 
25 °C. We represent the change in pressure at constant temperature as movement along 
the line marked B in Figure 11.38. As the pressure drops, we move down the line and 
approach the vaporization curve. At the vaporization curve, the pressure stops dropping 
and vaporization occurs until the liquid completely converts to vapor. Crossing the 
vaporization curve requires the complete transition from liquid to gas. Only after the 
liquid has all vaporized can the pressure continue to drop.
The Phase Diagrams of Other Substances
Next, let’s examine the phase diagrams of iodine and carbon dioxide in Figure 11.39▼. 
The phase diagrams are similar to the diagram of water in most of their general features, 
but some significant differences exist.

Note that the fusion curves for both carbon dioxide and iodine have a positive 
slope—as the temperature increases, the pressure also increases—in contrast to the 
fusion curve for water, which has a negative slope. The behavior of water is atypical. The 
fusion curve within the phase diagrams for most substances has a positive slope because 
increasing pressure favors the denser state, which for most substances is the solid state.
For example, suppose we increase the pressure on a sample of iodine from 1 atm to 
100 atm at 184 °C, as shown by line A in Figure 11.39(a). Notice that this change crosses 
the fusion curve, converting the liquid into a solid. In contrast, a pressure increase from 
1 atm to 100 atm at -0.1 °C in water causes a state transition from solid to liquid. Unlike 
most substances, the liquid state of water is actually denser than the solid state.
Both water and iodine have stable solid, liquid, and gaseous states at a pressure 
of 1 atm. However, notice that carbon dioxide has no stable liquid state at a pressure 
of 1 atm. If we increase the temperature of a block of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) at 
1 atm, as indicated by line B in Figure 11.39(b), we cross the sublimation curve at 
-78.5 °C. At this temperature, the solid sublimes to a gas, which is one reason that 
dry ice is useful (it does not melt into a liquid at atmospheric pressure). Carbon diox-
ide forms a liquid only above pressures of 5.1 atm.

	 11.9	 Water: An Extraordinary Substance
Water is the most common and important liquid on Earth. It fills our oceans, lakes, and 
streams. In its solid form, it caps our mountains, and in its gaseous form, it humidifies 
our air. We drink water, we sweat water, and we excrete bodily wastes dissolved in water. 
Indeed, the majority of our body mass is water. Life is impossible without water, and in 
most places on Earth where liquid water exists, life exists. Recent evidence for the past 
existence of water on Mars has fueled hopes of finding life or evidence of past life there. 
And though it may not be obvious to us (because we take water for granted), this familiar 
substance has many remarkable properties.
Among liquids, water is unique. It has a low molar mass (18.02 g>mol), yet it is a 
liquid at room temperature. Other main-group hydrides have higher molar masses but 
lower boiling points, as shown in Figure 11.40▼. No other substance of similar molar 
mass (except HF) comes close to being a liquid at room temperature.

found evidence that liquid water 
(which could possibly sustain life) 
once existed on the surface of Mars.

of Main-Group Hydrides  Water is 
the only common main-group hydride 
that is a liquid at room temperature.
We can understand water’s high boiling point (in spite of its low molar mass) by 
examining its molecular structure. The bent geometry of the water molecule and the 
highly polar nature of the O¬ H bonds result in a molecule with a significant dipole 
moment. Water’s two O¬ H bonds (hydrogen directly bonded to oxygen) allow a water 
molecule to form strong hydrogen bonds with four other water molecules (Figure 11.41◀), 
resulting in a relatively high boiling point.
Water’s high polarity allows it to dissolve many other polar and ionic compounds 
and even a number of nonpolar gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide (by inducing a 
dipole moment in their molecules). Consequently, water is the main solvent within liv-
ing organisms, transporting nutrients and other important compounds throughout the 
body. Water is the main solvent in our environment as well, allowing aquatic animals, 
for example, to survive by breathing dissolved oxygen and allowing aquatic plants to 
survive by using dissolved carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.

11.9  Water: An Extraordinary Substance	
521
Recall from Section 6.4 that water has an exceptionally high specific heat capacity, 
which has a moderating effect on the climate of coastal cities. In some cities, such as San 
Francisco, for example, the daily fluctuation in temperature can be less than 10 °C. This 
same moderating effect occurs over the entire planet, two-thirds of which is covered by 
water. Without water, the daily temperature fluctuations on our planet might be more 
like those on Mars, where temperatures fluctuate 63 °C (113 °F) between midday and 
early morning. Imagine awakening to below-freezing temperatures, only to bake at sum-
mer desert temperatures in the afternoon! The presence of water on Earth and water’s 
uniquely high specific heat capacity are largely responsible for our planet’s much smaller 
daily fluctuations.
As we have discussed, the way water freezes is also unique. Unlike other substances, 
which contract upon freezing, water expands upon freezing. Consequently, ice is less 
dense than liquid water, which is why ice floats. This seemingly trivial property has signifi-
cant consequences. The frozen layer of ice at the surface of a winter lake insulates the water 
in the lake from further freezing. If this ice layer sank, it would kill bottom-dwelling aquatic 
life and possibly allow the lake to freeze solid, eliminating virtually all life in the lake.
The expansion of water upon freezing, however, is one reason that most organisms 
do not survive freezing. When the water within a cell freezes, it expands and often rup-
tures the cell, just as water freezing within a pipe bursts the pipe. Many foods, especially 
those with high water content, do not survive freezing very well either. Have you ever 
tried, for example, to freeze your own vegetables? If you put lettuce or spinach in the 
freezer, it will be limp and damaged upon thawing. The frozen-food industry gets around 
this problem by flash freezing vegetables and other foods. In this process, foods are frozen 
nearly instantaneously, which prevents water molecules from settling into their pre-
ferred crystalline structure. Consequently, the water does not expand very much, and 
the food remains largely undamaged.
▲ When lettuce freezes, the water 
within its cells expands, rupturing 
them.

should not be consumed. Boiling eliminates most biologi-
cal contaminants from untreated water.
Chemical contaminants enter drinking water supplies as a 
result of industrial dumping, pesticide and fertilizer use, and 
household dumping. These contaminants include organic 
compounds, such as carbon tetrachloride and dioxin, and 
­inorganic elements and compounds, such as mercury, lead, 
and nitrates. Because many chemical contaminants are nei-
ther volatile nor alive (like biological contaminants are), they 
are usually not eliminated through boiling.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the 
Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 and its amendments, sets 
standards that specify the maximum contamination level 
(MCL) of nearly 100 biological and chemical contaminants in 
water. Water providers that serve more than 25 people must 
periodically test the water they deliver to their consumers for 
these contaminants. If levels exceed the standards set by 
the EPA, the water provider must notify consumers and take 
appropriate measures to remove the contaminant from the 
water. According to the EPA, water from providers that serve 
more than 25 people should be safe to consume over a life-
time. If it is not safe to drink for a short period of time, pro-
viders must notify consumers.

or animal waste is dumped into bodies of water. Drinking 
water in developed nations is usually chemically treated to 
kill microorganisms. Water containing biological contami-
nants poses an immediate danger to human health and

Key Concepts
Solids, Liquids, and Intermolecular Forces  
(11.1, 11.2, 11.3)
▶
▶The forces that hold molecules or atoms together in a liquid or 
solid are intermolecular forces. The strength of the intermolecular 
forces in a substance determines its state.
▶
▶Dispersion forces are present in all elements and compounds; 
they arise from the fluctuations in electron distribution within 
atoms and molecules. These are the weakest intermolecular 
forces, but they are significant in molecules with high molar 
masses.
▶
▶Dipole–dipole forces, generally stronger than dispersion forces, 
are present in all polar molecules.
▶
▶Hydrogen bonding occurs in polar molecules that contain hydro-
gen atoms bonded directly to fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen. These 
are among the strongest intermolecular forces.
▶
▶Ion–dipole forces occur when ionic compounds are mixed with 
polar compounds, and they are especially important in aqueous 
solutions.
Surface Tension, Viscosity, and Capillary  
Action (11.4)
▶
▶Surface tension results from the tendency of liquids to minimize 
their surface area in order to maximize the interactions between 
their constituent particles, thus lowering potential energy. Sur-
face tension causes water droplets to form spheres and allows in-
sects and paper clips to “float” on the surface of water.
▶
▶Viscosity is the resistance of a liquid to flow. Viscosity increases 
with increasing strength of intermolecular forces and decreases 
with increasing temperature.
▶
▶Capillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow against gravity 
up a narrow tube. It is the result of adhesive forces, the attraction 
between the molecules and the surface of the tube, and cohesive 
forces, the attraction between the molecules in the liquid.
Vaporization and Vapor Pressure (11.5, 11.7)
▶
▶Vaporization, the transition from liquid to gas, occurs when ther-
mal energy overcomes the intermolecular forces present in a liquid. 
The opposite process is condensation. Vaporization is endothermic 
and condensation is exothermic.
▶
▶The rate of vaporization increases with increasing temperature, 
increasing surface area, and decreasing strength of intermolecular 
forces.
▶
▶The heat of vaporization (∆Hvap) is the heat required to vaporize 
one mole of a liquid.
▶
▶In a sealed container, a liquid and its vapor come into dynamic 
equilibrium, at which point the rate of vaporization equals the 
rate of condensation. The pressure of a gas that is in dynamic equi-
librium with its liquid is its vapor pressure.
▶
▶The vapor pressure of a substance increases with increasing tem-
perature and with decreasing strength of its intermolecular forces.
▶
▶The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor 
pressure equals the external pressure.
▶
▶The Clausius–Clapeyron equation expresses the relationship be-
tween the vapor pressure of a substance and its temperature and 
can be used to calculate the heat of vaporization from experimen-
tal measurements.
▶
▶When a liquid is heated in a sealed container, it eventually forms a 
supercritical fluid, which has properties intermediate between a liq-
uid and a gas. This occurs at critical temperature and critical pressure.

Chapter 11  Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces
Fusion and Sublimation (11.6, 11.7)
▶
▶Sublimation is the transition from solid to gas. The opposite pro-
cess is deposition.
▶
▶Fusion, or melting, is the transition from solid to liquid. The op-
posite process is freezing.
▶
▶The heat of fusion (∆H fus) is the amount of heat required to melt 
one mole of a solid. Fusion is endothermic.
▶
▶The heat of fusion is generally less than the heat of vaporization 
because intermolecular forces do not have to be completely over-
come for melting to occur.
Phase Diagrams (11.8)
▶
▶A phase diagram is a map of the states of a substance as a function 
of its pressure (y-axis) and temperature (x-axis).
▶
▶The regions in a phase diagram represent conditions under which 
a single stable state (solid, liquid, gas) exists.
▶
▶The lines represent conditions under which two states are in equi-
librium.
▶
▶The triple point represents the conditions under which all three 
states coexist.
▶
▶The critical point is the temperature and pressure above which a 
supercritical fluid exists.
The Uniqueness of Water (11.9)
▶
▶Water is a liquid at room temperature despite its low molar mass. 
Water forms strong hydrogen bonds, resulting in its high boiling 
point.
▶
▶The polarity of water enables it to dissolve many polar and ionic 
compounds and even nonpolar gases.
▶
▶Water expands upon freezing, so ice is less dense than liquid water. 
Water is critical both to the existence of life and to human health.

Conceptual Problems
	103. 	The following image is an electrostatic potential map for ethyl-
ene oxide, (CH2)2O, a polar molecule. Use the electrostatic po-

molecule interacts with another. Draw structural formulas, 
using the 3D bond notation introduced in Section 10.4, to show 
the geometry of the interaction.
	104. 	One prediction of global warming is the melting of global 
ice, which may result in coastal flooding. A criticism of this 
prediction is that the melting of icebergs does not increase 
ocean levels any more than the melting of ice in a glass of

criticism? Does the melting of an ice cube in a cup of water 
raise the level of the liquid in the cup? Why or why not? In 
response to this criticism, scientists have asserted that they 
are not worried about melting icebergs, but rather the melt-
ing of ice sheets that sit on the continent of Antarctica. 
Would the melting of this ice increase ocean levels? Why or 
why not?
	105. 	The rate of vaporization depends on the surface area of the liq-
uid. However, the vapor pressure of a liquid does not depend on 
the surface area. Explain.

B. Which of the two substances will undergo a larger change in 
vapor pressure for a given change in temperature?

least steep slope? Why?
	110. 	A root cellar is an underground chamber used to store fruits, 
vegetables, and even meats. In extreme cold, farmers put large 
vats of water into the root cellar to prevent the fruits and vegeta-
bles from freezing. Explain why this works.

sion of a substance is always smaller than its heat of vaporiza-
tion.

(other than water)?

the flasks contains 1.0 atm of N2; the second, 2.0 g of H2O; and the 
third, 0.50 g of ethanol, C2H6O. The vapor pressure of H2O at 
308 K is 42 mmHg and that of ethanol is 102 mmHg. The stop-
cocks are then opened and the contents mix freely. What is the 
pressure?

Answers to Conceptual Connections
State Changes
11.1	 (a) When water boils, it simply changes state from liquid to 
gas. Water molecules do not decompose during boiling.
Dispersion Forces
11.2	 (c) I2 has the highest boiling point because it has the highest 
molar mass. Since the halogens are all similar in other ways, we 
expect I2 to have the greatest dispersion forces and therefore 
the highest boiling point (and in fact it does).

hydrogen bonding, resulting in the highest boiling point.
Vapor Pressure
11.5	 (b) Although the rate of vaporization increases with increasing 
surface area, the vapor pressure of a liquid is independent of sur-
face area. An increase in surface area increases both the rate of 
vaporization and the rate of condensation—the effects exactly 
cancel and the vapor pressure does not change.
Cooling of Water with Ice
11.6	 The warming of the ice from -10 °C to 0 °C absorbs only 20.9 J>g 
of ice. The melting of the ice, however, absorbs about 334 J> g of 
ice. (You can obtain this value by dividing the heat of fusion of 
water by its molar mass.) Therefore, the melting of the ice pro-
duces a larger temperature decrease in the water than does the 
warming of the ice.

material known--it is only one atom 
thick.
I
n this chapter, we focus on the solid state of matter. We first examine the structures 
of solids, keeping in mind that these structures determine the properties of solids. 
For example, the repeating hexagonal pattern of water molecules in crystalline ice 
determines the hexagonal shape of a snowflake, and the repeating cubic pattern of sodi-
um and chloride ions in sodium chloride determines the cubic shape of salt grains. We 
then turn our attention to the study and development of solids with unique and useful 
properties, a field known as materials science. The ceramics that compose your coffee 
cups, the semiconductors in your electronic devices, and the plastics that are most like-
ly all around you even at this moment are materials developed to have specific proper-
ties that serve specific purposes. In this chapter, we take a brief look at each of these 
kinds of materials.
	 12.1	 Friday Night Experiments:  
The Discovery of Graphene
In 2010, Andre Geim (1958–) and Konstantin Novoselov (1974–) were awarded the Nobel 
Prize in Physics for the discovery of a new material—graphene. Graphene is the thinnest 
known material (only one atom thick); it is also the strongest. It conducts heat and 
electricity, it is transparent, and it is completely impermeable to all substances, including 
helium. Although its many possible applications are yet to be realized, graphene may 
one day be used to make faster computers, foldable touchscreens, ultrathin light panels, 

534	
Chapter 12  Solids and Modern Materials
and super-strong plastics to construct satellites, airplanes, ships, and cars. And how did 
these scientists discover this wonder material? Through Friday night experiments.
Most successful modern scientists work in a narrow field of study, chipping away at a 
problem about which they have become experts. Andre Geim also worked this way—but 
not all of the time. Geim often ventured into what he calls lateral ideas, which were explo-
rations into fields far from his immediate area of expertise. Over a 15-year period, he 
explored about two dozen such ideas. These explorations became known as Friday night 
experiments (even though they took much longer than just one night). Most of Geim’s 
Friday night experiments were complete failures, but some succeeded. For example, in 
one Friday night experiment, Geim was able to suspend an entire frog in a magnetic field. 
In another, he developed a new kind of tape based on mimicking the toes of a gecko. 
However, his most successful Friday night experiment was the discovery of graphene.
In 2002, Geim assigned his brand-new graduate student a Friday night experiment 
as a way to give the student time to get acquainted with the laboratory. His assignment 
was to make films of graphite “as thin as possible.” The graduate student tackled the task 
by attempting to polish a tablet of graphite down to almost nothingness. In spite of his 
best efforts, the thinnest sheet he could attain by this method was still pretty thick 
(about 10 mm).
In a breakthrough moment, a colleague brought Geim a piece of scotch tape that had 
been adhered to a graphite surface and then removed. The tape had remnants of graphite 
stuck to it. When Geim examined the graphite flakes under a microscope, he realized that 
these flakes where much thinner than those his graduate student was able to produce 
through polishing. In fact, some of the flakes were just one layer thick! Over the next sev-
eral months, Geim and his colleagues were able to isolate these flakes and measure some 
of their properties. In 2004, Geim and his colleagues published their results—the discov-
ery of atomically thin carbon—in Nature. In 2010, Geim and his closest collaborator on 
the project, Konstantin Novoselov, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for “ground-
breaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene.”
Graphene has been right under our noses for some time. Every time you write with a 
pencil, layers of graphite flake onto the paper, leaving the familiar gray trail. That trail 
undoubtedly also contains flakes of graphene—too small to see. Geim and Novoselov 
were able to see what others had missed and as a result, discovered a new wonder mate-
rial. These kinds of discoveries often have huge impacts on society—although it may 
take decades to realize and refine their applications.
In this chapter, we look into the world of solids and materials and see how they per-
manently changed societies, just as graphene may someday change our present society. 
For example, the discovery of cement led to a revolution in building, the discovery of 
porcelain led to a revolution in dishware, and the discovery of semiconducting materials 
made possible the computer and Internet revolution which is still unfolding today. The 
development of new materials continues to be an active and growing area of research. 
We begin by examining a technique to determine the structure of solids.
	 12.2	 X-Ray Crystallography
In Section 11.2, we discussed the differences between solids, liquids, and gases. Recall 
that solids can be crystalline (composed of atoms or molecules arranged in structures 
with long-range order) or amorphous (composed of atoms or molecules with no long-
range order). If you have ever visited the mineral section of a natural history museum 
and seen crystals with smooth faces and well-defined angles, or if you have carefully 
observed the hexagonal shapes of snowflakes, you have witnessed some of the effects 
of the underlying long-range order in crystalline solids. The beautiful geometric shapes 
that are visible on the macroscopic scale are the result of specific structural patterns on 
the molecular and atomic scales. But how do we study these patterns? How do we look 
into the atomic and molecular world to determine the arrangement of the atoms and 
measure the distances between them? In this section, we examine X-ray diffraction, a 
powerful laboratory technique that enables us to do exactly that.
▲ The hexagonal shape of a 
snowflake derives from the 
hexagonal arrangement of water 
molecules in crystalline ice.

	
12.2  X-Ray Crystallography	
535
In Section 7.2 we saw that electromagnetic  waves (light waves) interact with 
each other in a characteristic way called interference: they can cancel each other 
out or reinforce each other, depending on the alignment of their crests and 
troughs. Constructive interference occurs when two waves interact with their crests 
and troughs in alignment. Destructive interference occurs when two waves inter-
act with the crests of one aligning with the troughs of the other. Recall also that 
when light encounters two slits separated by a distance comparable to the wave-
length of the light, constructive and destructive interference produces a charac-
teristic interference pattern, consisting of alternating bright and dark lines.
Atomic planes within crystals are separated by about 102 pm. As a result, 
light of similar wavelength (which happens to fall in the X-ray region of the 
electromagnetic spectrum) forms interference patterns or diffraction patterns 
when it interacts with those atoms. The exact pattern of diffraction reveals the 
spacing between planes of atoms.
Consider two planes of atoms within a crystalline lattice separated by a 
distance d, as illustrated in Figure 12.1▼. If two rays of light with wavelength l 
that are initially in phase (that is, the crests of one wave are aligned with the 
crests of the other) diffract from the two planes, the diffracted rays may inter-
fere with each other constructively or destructively, depending on the differ-
ence between the path lengths traveled by each ray. If the difference between 
the two path lengths (2a) is an integral number (n) of wavelengths, then the 
interference is constructive:
	
nl = 2a   (criterion for constructive interference)

◀ Figure 12.1  Diffraction from  
a Crystal  When X-rays strike 
parallel planes of atoms in a crystal, 
constructive interference occurs if 
the difference in path length between 
beams reflected from adjacent planes is 
an integral number of wavelengths.
Using trigonometry, we can determine that constructive interference occurs when 
the angle of reflection (u) is related to the distance a and the separation between layers 
(d) by the following relation:
	
sin u = a
d
[12.2]
Rearranging, we get:
	
a = d sin u
[12.3]
By substituting Equation 12.3 into Equation 12.1, we arrive at the following important 
relationship:
	
nl = 2d sin u     Bragg’s law
This equation is Bragg’s law. For a given wavelength of light incident on atoms arranged 
in layers, we can measure the angle that produces constructive interference (which 
appears as a bright spot on the X-ray diffraction pattern) and then calculate d, the dis-
tance between the atomic layers:
	
d =
nl
2 sin u
[12.4]

536	
Chapter 12  Solids and Modern Materials
In a modern X-ray diffractometer (Figure 12.2▲), a computer collects and analyzes 
the diffraction pattern from a crystal. By rotating the crystal and collecting the resulting 
diffraction patterns at different angles, the distances between various crystalline planes 
can be measured, eventually yielding the entire crystalline structure. This process is 
X-ray crystallography.
Researchers use X-ray crystallography to determine not only the structures of sim-
ple atomic lattices, but also the structures of proteins, DNA, and other biologically 
important molecules. For example, the famous X-ray diffraction photograph shown in 
the margin, obtained by Rosalind Franklin (1920–1958) and Maurice Wilkins (1916–
2004), helped Watson and Crick determine the double-helical structure of DNA. Recall 
from Section 9.1 that researchers  also used X-ray diffraction to determine the structure 
of HIV protease, a protein critical to the reproduction of HIV and the development of 
AIDS. Knowledge of that structure was then employed to design drug molecules to 
inhibit the action of HIV protease and halt the advance of the disease.

▶ Figure 12.2  X-Ray Diffraction Analysis   
In X-ray crystallography, an X-ray beam is passed 
through a sample, which is rotated to allow 
diffraction from different crystalline planes. The 
resulting patterns, representing constructive 
interference from various planes, are analyzed to 
determine crystalline structure.
Example 12.1	
Using Bragg’s Law
When an X-ray beam of l = 154 pm is incident on the surface of an iron crystal, 
it produces a maximum diffraction at an angle of u = 32.6°. Assuming n = 1, 
calculate the separation between layers of iron atoms in the crystal.
Solution
To solve this problem, use Bragg’s law in the form 
given by Equation 12.4. The distance, d, is the separa-
tion between layers in the crystal.

for n = 1.

	 12.3	 Unit Cells and Basic Structures
X-ray crystallography allows us to determine the regular arrangements of atoms 
within a crystalline solid. This arrangement is called the crystalline lattice. 
The crystalline lattice of any solid is nature’s way of aggregating the particles to 
minimize their energy. We represent the crystalline lattice with a small collection 
of atoms, ions, or molecules called the unit cell. When the unit cell is repeated 
over and over—like the tiles of a floor or the pattern in a wallpaper design, but in 
three dimensions—the entire lattice is reproduced. For example, consider the two-
dimensional crystalline lattice shown here:
Cubic
a = b = c
α = β = γ = 90°
Triclinic
a ≠ b ≠ c
α ≠ β ≠ γ 
Rhombohedral
a = b = c

▲ Figure 12.3  The Seven Fundamental Types of Unit Cells  In this book, we focus on cubic unit 
cells.
The unit cell for this lattice is the dark-colored square. Each circle represents an atom, 
ion, or molecule. Repeating the pattern in the square throughout the two-dimensional 
space generates the entire lattice.
Cubic Unit Cells
Many different unit cells exist, and we often classify unit cells by their symmetry. 
Figure 12.3▼ shows the different fundamental types of unit cells. In this book, we focus 
primarily on cubic unit cells (although we look at one hexagonal unit cell). Cubic unit cells 
are characterized by equal edge lengths and 90° angles at their corners. Figure 12.4▶ on 
the next page lists three cubic unit cells—simple cubic, body-centered cubic, and face-
centered cubic—along with some of their basic characteristics. The two colors in the 
images in this table make it easier to visualize the different positions of the atoms; the 
colors do not represent different kinds of atoms. For these unit cells, each atom in any one 
structure is identical to the other atoms in that structure.

▲ Figure 12.4  Cubic Crystalline Lattices  The different colors used for the atoms in this 
figure are for clarity only. All atoms within each structure are identical. Unit cells, such as the 
cubic ones shown here, are customarily portrayed with “whole” atoms, even though only a part 
of the whole atom may actually be in the unit cell.
The simple cubic unit cell (Figure 12.5▼) consists of a cube with one atom at each 
corner. As we can see in the figure at the left, the atoms touch along each edge of the 
cube, so the edge length is twice the radius of the atoms (l = 2r).
Even though it may seem like the unit cell contains eight atoms, it actually con-
tains only one as close examination of Figure 12.5 makes evident. Each corner atom is 
shared by eight other unit cells. In other words, any one unit cell actually contains 
only one-eighth of each of the eight atoms at its corners, for a total of only one atom 
per unit cell.

A characteristic feature of any unit cell is the coordination number, the number 
of atoms with which each atom is in direct contact. The coordination number is the num-
ber of atoms with which a particular atom can strongly interact. The simple cubic unit 
cell has a coordination number of 6; any one atom touches only six others, as you can 
see in Figure 12.5. A quantity closely related to the coordination number is the packing 
efficiency, the percentage of the volume of the unit cell occupied by the spheres. The 
higher the coordination number is, the greater the packing efficiency is. The simple 
cubic unit cell has a packing efficiency of 52%—it contains a lot of empty space.
Example 12.2	
Calculating the Packing Efficiency of a Unit Cell
Calculate the packing efficiency of the simple cubic unit cell.
Solution
The packing efficiency is defined as the ratio of the volume of the 
unit cell occupied by atoms to the volume of the unit cell itself all 
multiplied by 100%.
Packing Efficiency =
Vatom
Vunit cell
* 100%
First, determine the volume occupied by atoms. Each unit cell con-
tains one atom, so the volume of the unit cell occupied by atoms is 
simply the volume of one atom.
Vatom = 4
3pr3
Next, calculate the volume of the cube in terms of the radius of the 
atom. The volume of a cube is its edge length cubed, and the edge 
length of the simple cubic unit cell is 2r.
 Vunit cell = l3
 = (2r)3
 = 8r3
Calculate the packing efficiency by dividing the volume of the atom 
by the volume of the unit cell and multiplying by 100%.

The body-centered cubic unit cell (Figure 12.6▶, on the next page) consists of a 
cube with one atom at each corner and one atom (of the same kind) in the very center of 
the cube. Note that in the body-centered unit cell, the atoms do not touch along each 
edge of the cube, but instead touch along the diagonal line that runs from one corner,

The body-centered unit cell contains two atoms per unit cell because the center 
atom is not shared with any other neighboring cells. The coordination number of the 
body-centered cubic unit cell is 8, which we can see by examining the atom in the very 
center of the cube, which touches eight atoms at the corners. The packing efficiency for 
the body-centered unit cell is 68%, significantly higher than for the simple cubic unit 
cell. Each atom in this structure strongly interacts with more atoms than each atom in 
the simple cubic unit cell.

The face-centered cubic unit cell (Figure 12.7▼) is a cube 
with one atom at each corner and one atom (of the same kind) 
in the center of each cube face. Note that in the face-centered 
unit cell (like the body-centered unit cell), the atoms do not 
touch along each edge of the cube. Instead, the atoms touch 
along the face diagonal. The edge length in terms of the atomic 
radius is therefore l = 222r, as shown here.

The face-centered unit cell contains four atoms per unit cell because the center 
atoms on each of the six faces are shared between two unit cells. There are 12 * 6 = 3 
face-centered atoms plus 18 * 8 = 1 corner atom, for a total of four atoms per unit cell. 
The coordination number of the face-centered cubic unit cell is 12, and its packing effi-
ciency is 74%. In this structure, any one atom strongly interacts with more atoms than 
the atoms in either the simple cubic unit cell or the body-centered cubic unit cell.
Example 12.4	
Relating Density to Crystal Structure
Aluminum crystallizes with a face-centered cubic unit cell. The radius of an aluminum atom is 143 pm. Calculate the 
density of solid crystalline aluminum in g>cm3.
SORT  You are given the radius of an aluminum atom and its 
crystal structure. You are asked to find the density of solid alu-
minum.
GIVEN:  r = 143 pm, face-centered cubic
FIND:  d
STRATEGIZE  The conceptual plan is based on the definition of 
density.
Since the unit cell has the physical properties of the entire crys-
tal, you can find the mass and volume of the unit cell and use 
these to calculate its density.
CONCEPTUAL PLAN 
 d = m>V
 m = mass of unit cell
 = number of atoms in unit cell * mass of each atom
 V = volume of unit cell
 = (edge length)3 
SOLVE  Begin by finding the mass of the unit cell. Determine 
the mass of an aluminum atom from its molar mass. Because 
the face-centered cubic unit cell contains four atoms per unit 
cell, multiply the mass of aluminum by 4 to get the mass of a 
unit cell.
SOLUTION 
 m(Al atom) = 26.98 
g

6.022 * 1023 atoms
 = 4.480 * 10-23 g>atom
 m(unit cell) = 4  atoms(4.480 * 10-23 g>atom)
 = 1.792 * 10-22 g
Next, calculate the edge length (l) of the unit cell (in m) from 
the atomic radius of aluminum. For the face-centered cubic 
structure, l = 222r.
 l = 222r
 = 222(143 pm)
 = 222(143 * 10-12 m)
 = 4.045 * 10-10 m
Calculate the volume of the unit cell (in cm) by converting the 
edge length to cm and cubing the edge length. (Use centimeters 
because you want to report the density in units of g>cm3.)
 V = l3
 = a4.045 * 10-10 m *
1 cm
10-2 m

 = 6.618 * 10-23 cm3
Finally, calculate the density by dividing the mass of the unit 
cell by the volume of the unit cell.
 d = m
V =
1.792 * 10-22 g
6.618 * 10-23 cm3
 = 2.71 g>  cm3
CHECK  The units of the answer are correct. The magnitude of the answer is reasonable because the density is greater than 
1 g>cm3 (as you would expect for metals), but still not too high (because aluminum is a low-density metal).
For Practice 12.4  Chromium crystallizes with a body-centered cubic unit cell. The radius of a chromium atom is 
125 pm. Calculate the density of solid crystalline chromium in g>cm3.

Closest-Packed Structures
Another way to envision crystal structures, especially useful for metals, in which bonds 
are not usually directional, is to think of the atoms as stacking in layers, much as fruit 
is stacked at the grocery store. For example, we can envision the simple cubic structure 
as one layer of atoms arranged in a square pattern, with the next layer stacking directly 
over the first, so that the atoms in one layer align exactly on top of the atoms in the layer 
beneath it, as shown here:
As we saw previously, this crystal structure has a great deal of empty space—only 52% of 
the volume is occupied by the spheres, and the coordination number is 6.
More space-efficient packing can be achieved by aligning neighboring rows of atoms 
in a pattern, with one row offset from the next by one-half a sphere, as shown here:
In this way, the atoms pack more closely to each other in any one layer. We can fur-
ther increase the packing efficiency by placing the next layer not directly on top of the first, 
but again offset so that any one atom actually sits in the indentation formed by three 
atoms in the layer beneath it, as shown here:
Layer A
Layer A
Layer B
This kind of packing leads to two different crystal structures called closest-packed 
structures, both of which have a packing efficiency of 74% and a coordination number 
of 12. In the first of these two closest-packed structures—called hexagonal closest 
packing—the third layer of atoms aligns exactly on top of the first, as shown here:

	 12.4	 The Fundamental Types of  
Crystalline Solids
We examined some of the basic structures of crystalline solids in Section 12.3. In this 
section, we turn to the different types of crystalline solids. We can classify crystalline 
solids into three categories—molecular, ionic, and atomic—based on the individual 
particles that compose the solid. Atomic solids can themselves be classified into three 
categories—nonbonded, metallic, and network covalent—depending on the types 
of interactions between atoms within the solid. Figure 12.10▶ shows the different 
categories of crystalline solids.
The pattern from one layer to the next is ABAB, with the 
third layer aligning exactly above the first. Notice that the cen-
tral atom in layer B of this structure is touching six atoms in its 
own layer, three atoms in the layer above it, and three atoms in 
the layer below, for a coordination number of 12. The unit cell 
for this crystal structure is not a cubic unit cell, but a hexagonal 
one, shown in Figure 12.8◀.
In the second of the two closest-packed structures—called 
cubic closest packing—the third layer of atoms is offset from 
the first, as shown here:
Layer C
Layer B
Layer A
Cubic closest packing
The pattern from one layer to the next is ABCABC, with every fourth layer aligning with 
the first. Although not simple to visualize, the unit cell for cubic closest packing is the 
face-centered cubic unit cell, shown in Figure 12.9▼. The cubic closest-packed structure 
is identical to the face-centered cubic unit cell structure.

Molecular Solids
Molecular solids are solids in which the composite particles are molecules. The unit 
cells in a crystalline molecular solid are therefore occupied by molecules. Ice (solid 
H2O) and dry ice (solid CO2) are examples of molecular solids. Molecular solids are held 
together by the kinds of intermolecular forces—dispersion forces, dipole–dipole forces, 
and hydrogen bonding—discussed in Chapter 11. Although molecular solids as a whole 
tend to have low to moderately low melting points, their specific properties depend on 
the types of intermolecular forces between the molecules as well as the structure of the 
molecule and the crystal structure of the solid. For example, benzene and toluene have 
similar molar masses and similar intermolecular forces (dispersion forces):

Chemistry IN YOUR DAY | Chocolate, An Edible Material
C
hocolate is an edible and delicious material designed to 
please your senses. Good chocolate has a smooth and 
shiny surface, snaps when you break it, and melts in your 
mouth, releasing its delicious combination of flavors and tex-
ture. Like all materials, chocolate’s properties depend on its 
structure. The main structural ingredient in chocolate is cocoa 
butter, a triglyceride. We examine triglycerides more carefully 
in Chapter 22, but for now, just know that triglycerides are long 
organic molecules, which means that chocolate is a crystal-
line molecular solid. Many crystalline molecular solids only 
have one crystalline structure; however, some (including cocoa 
butter) have several possible crystalline structures called poly-
morphs, each with different properties. Cocoa butter has six 
possible polymorphs, often called Types I–VI, as shown in Table 
12.1. For reference, body temperature is 37 °C.
The most desirable crystalline form of cocoa butter in 
chocolate is Type V. Types I and II are soft and crumbly and 
show noticeable blooming. Blooming is the white residue that 
forms on the outside of chocolate. If you have ever let a 
chocolate bar melt and then re-solidify, you have probably no-
ticed this undesirable residue. Types III and IV are firmer, but 
they don’t have a sharp snap when you break or bite into 
them. Type V is firm, displays a sharp snap, has a smooth 
and shiny surface, and tends to melt in your mouth rather 
than your hand. For this reason, chocolatiers aim for this 
crystal structure. However, this structure is not easy to 
achieve. If you simply melt chocolate and let it re-solidify, you 
get a mix of Types I–V with all of their undesirable qualities. 
Chocolatiers “temper” their chocolate in their quest for 
­primarily Type V characteristics. (Continued on next page.)

a smooth, shiny surface, characteristic of Type V cocoa butter.
Polymorphism can exist in any 
crystalline material, not just molecular 
solids.
However, the extra ¬ CH3 group on toluene prevents the molecules from packing 
as efficiently in the crystal as they do in benzene. The result is that, even though toluene 
has a higher molar molar mass than benzene, it has a much a lower melting point.
Some molecular solids crystallize in different structures called polymorphs. The dif-
ferent crystal structures can have different properties, including different melting points 
and solubilities (see Chemistry in Your Day: Chocolate, An Edible Material). ­Polymorphism is 
important in pharmaceuticals because different forms of a drug can have different physio-
logical activities. For example, ritonavir was among the first drugs found to be effective in 
treating HIV and AIDS. When it was first discovered and approved for use, only one poly-
morph was known. However, soon after its widespread use, a second polymorph was dis-
covered. This second polymorph was more stable, less water-soluble, and much less 
physiologically active. Even worse, small amounts of this second polymorph in a sample 
could convert the active polymorph into the less active one. The drug manufacturer had to 
halt production of ritonavir until researchers solved the problem by switching from a cap-
sule form to a refrigerated gelcap form and later to a stable tablet form.

Tempering chocolate requires a specific and carefully con-
trolled heating and cooling sequence (Figure 12.11▼). First 
chocolatiers heat the chocolate to melt it. Then they allow it to 
cool slowly. The slow cooling favors the formation of Type V 
­crystals; however, the other types form as well. The final step is 
to reheat the chocolate to a temperature just below the melting 
point of the Type V crystals. This step melts all of the Type I–IV

sequence is completed, the 
chocolate can be poured into 
molds or used as coatings. When 
the tempered chocolate cools, it 
is primarily Type V and has a shiny 
smooth surface.
Ionic Solids
The composite particles of ionic solids are ions. Table salt (NaCl) and calcium fluoride 
(CaF2) are examples of ionic solids. The forces holding ionic solids together are strong 
coulombic forces (or ionic bonds), and because these forces are much stronger than 
intermolecular forces, ionic solids tend to have much higher melting points than 
molecular solids. For example, sodium chloride melts at 801 °C, while carbon disulfide 
(CS2)—a molecular solid with a higher molar mass—melts at -110 °C. We examine the 
structure of ionic solids in more detail in Section 12.5.
Atomic Solids
In atomic solids the composite particles are individual atoms. Solid xenon (Xe), 
iron (Fe), and silicon dioxide (SiO2) are examples of atomic solids. We classify atomic 
solids into three categories—nonbonding atomic solids, metallic atomic solids, and network 
covalent atomic solids—with each type held together by a different kind of force.
Nonbonding Atomic Solids
Nonbonding atomic solids are held together by relatively weak dispersion forces. In order 
to maximize these interactions, nonbonding atomic solids form closest-packed structures, 
maximizing their coordination numbers and minimizing the distance between composite 
units. Nonbonding atomic solids have very low melting points that increase uniformly with 
molar mass. The only nonbonding atomic solids are noble gases in their solid form. Argon, 
for example, has a melting point of -189 °C, and xenon has a melting point of -112 °C.
Metallic Atomic Solids
Metallic atomic solids, such as iron or gold, are held together by metallic bonds, which 
in the simplest model are represented by the interaction of metal cations with the sea of 
electrons that surrounds them, as described in Section 9.11 (Figure 12.12▶).
Because metallic bonds are not directional, many metals tend to form closest-
packed crystal structures. For example, nickel crystallizes in the cubic closest-packed 
structure and zinc crystallizes in the hexagonal closest-packed structure (Figure 12.13▶, 
on the next page). Metallic bonds have varying strengths. Some metals, such as mercury,

crystals, leaving only the Type V crystals to act as “seed 
­crystals.”* A seed crystal is a crystal upon which more of the 
crystal can grow. Seed crystals have the effect of imposing their 
own structure on the growing crystalline solid. When the proper-
ly tempered chocolate cools, the Type V seed crystals cause the 
majority of the chocolate to crystallize in the Type V structure, 
resulting in silky smooth, melt-in-your-mouth, chocolate.

Network Covalent Solids
Covalent bonds hold together network covalent atomic solids, such as diamond, 
graphite, and silicon dioxide. The crystal structures of these solids are more restricted by 
the geometrical constraints of the covalent bonds (which tend to be more directional 
than intermolecular forces, ionic bonds, or metallic bonds) so they do not tend to form 
closest-packed structures. Network covalent atomic solids have very high melting points 
because the crystalline solid is held together by covalent bonds. We examine some 
examples of this class of solids in Section 12.6.

	 12.5	 The Structures of Ionic Solids
Many ionic solids have crystalline structures that are closely related to the unit cells that we 
examined in Section 12.3. However, because ionic compounds necessarily contain both 
cations and anions, their structures must accommodate the two different types of ions. 
In an ionic solid, the cations and anions attract one another. The coordination number 
of the unit cell represents the number of close cation–anion interactions. Because these

interactions lower potential energy, the crystal structure of a particular ionic compound 
is the structure that maximizes the coordination number while accommodating both 
charge neutrality (each unit cell must be charge neutral) and the different sizes of the 
cations and anions that compose the particular compound. In general, the more similar 
the radii of the cation and the anion, the higher the coordination number.
Cesium chloride (CsCl) is a good example of an ionic compound with cations and 
anions of similar size (Cs+ radius = 167 pm; Cl- radius = 181 pm). In the cesium chlo-
ride structure, the chloride ions occupy the lattice sites of a simple cubic cell and one 
cesium ion lies in the very center of the cell, as shown in Figure 12.14▶. (Note that in 
this and subsequent figures of ionic crystal structures, the different colored spheres rep-
resent different ions.) The coordination number for cesium chloride is 8, meaning that 
each cesium ion is in direct contact with eight chloride ions (and vice versa). The cesium 
chloride unit cell contains one chloride anion (8 * 1>8 = 1) and one cesium cation for 
a ratio of Cs to Cl of 1:1, as the formula for the compound indicates. (Note that complete 
chloride ions are shown in Figure 12.14, even though only 1/8 of each ion is in the unit 
cell.) Calcium sulfide (CaS) has the same structure as cesium chloride.
Sodium chloride is an example of an ionic compound with different ion sizes: 
Na+ (radius = 97 pm) and Cl- (radius = 181 pm). The crystal structure must accom-
modate the disproportionate sizes. If ion size were the only consideration, the larger 
chloride anion could theoretically fit many of the smaller sodium cations around it, but 
charge neutrality requires that each sodium cation be surrounded by an equal number 
of chloride anions. Therefore, the coordination number is limited by the number of 
chloride anions that can fit around the relatively small sodium cation. The structure 
that minimizes the energy is shown in Figure 12.15▶ and has a coordination number of 
6 (each chloride anion is surrounded by six sodium cations and vice versa). We can visu-
alize this structure, called the rock salt structure, as chloride anions occupying the lattice 
sites of a face-centered cubic structure with the smaller sodium cations occupying the 
holes between the anions. (Alternatively, we can visualize this structure as the sodium 
cations occupying the lattice sites of a face-centered cubic structure with the larger chlo-
ride anions occupying the spaces between the cations.) Each unit cell contains four chlo-
ride anions [(8 * 18) + (6 * 12) = 4] and four sodium cations [(12 * 14) + 1 = 4], 
resulting in a ratio of 1:1, as the formula of the compound specifies. Other compounds 
exhibiting the sodium chloride structure include LiF, KCl, KBr, AgCl, MgO, and CaO.
When there is a greater disproportion between the sizes of the cations and anions 
in a compound, a coordination number of even 6 is physically impossible. For exam-
ple, in ZnS (Zn2 + radius = 74 pm; S2 - radius = 184 pm) the crystal structure, shown in 
Figure 12.16▶, has a coordination number of only 4. We can visualize this structure, 
called the zinc blende structure, as sulfide anions occupying the lattice sites of a face-
centered cubic structure with the smaller zinc cations occupying four of the eight tetra-
hedral holes located directly beneath each corner atom. A tetrahedral hole is the empty 
space that lies in the center of a tetrahedral arrangement of four atoms, as shown in the 
figure below. Each unit cell contains four sulfide anions [(8 * 18) + (6 * 12) = 4] and 
four zinc cations (each of the four zinc cations is completely contained within the unit 
cell), resulting in a ratio of 1:1, just as the formula of the compound indicates. Other 
compounds that exhibit the zinc blende structure include CuCl, AgI, and CdS.

the fluorite structure include PbF2, SrF2, and BaCl2. Compounds with a cation-to-anion

	 12.6	 Network Covalent Atomic Solids: 
Carbon and Silicates
As we saw in Section 12.4, network covalent atomic solids are composed of atoms held 
together by covalent bonds. Because the covalent bonds have to be broken for the solid 
to melt, network covalent atomic solids have some of the highest melting points of 
all substances. In this section, we examine two different families of network covalent 
atomic solids: carbon and silicates.
Carbon
Elemental carbon exists in several different forms (or 
allotropes) including graphene, which we discussed 
in Section 12.1. Two well-known naturally occurring 
crystalline forms of carbon are graphite and diamond. 
Graphite’s structure, shown in Figure 12.18a ◀, consists 
of flat sheets of carbon atoms covalently bonded 
together as interconnected hexagonal rings. The bond 
length between carbon atoms within a sheet is 142 pm. 
However, the forces between sheets are much different. 
There are no covalent bonds between sheets, only 
relatively weak dispersion forces, and the separation 
between sheets is 341 pm. Consequently, the sheets 
slide past each other relatively easily, which explains 
the slippery feel of graphite and its extensive use as a 
lubricant. The electrons in the extended pi bonding 
network within a sheet make graphite a good electrical 
conductor in the direction of the plane of the sheets. 
Because of its relative stability and electrical properties, 
graphite is used for electrodes in electrochemical 
applications and for heating elements in furnaces.
The density of graphite is 2.2 g>cm3. Under high 
pressure, the carbon atoms in graphite rearrange to form 
diamond, which has a higher density of 3.5 g>cm3. 
(b) Diamond
(a) Graphite
▲ Figure 12.18  Network Covalent Atomic Solids  (a) In graphite, 
carbon atoms are arranged in sheets. Within each sheet, the atoms 
are covalently bonded to one another by a network of sigma and pi 
bonds. Neighboring sheets are held together by dispersion forces. (b) 
In diamond, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds to four other 
carbon atoms in a tetrahedral geometry.

­Diamond forms naturally when carbon is exposed to high pressures deep underground. 
Through movements in Earth’s crust, diamond rises toward the surface. Most diamond is 
found in Africa, mainly in the Congo region and in South Africa. The first synthetic dia-
monds were produced in the 1940s, using pressures of 50,000 atm and a temperature of 
1600 °C. The unit cell for diamond is shown here:
▲ Diamond Unit Cell
S2−
Zn2+
Zinc blende (ZnS)
▲ Zinc Blende Unit Cell
You can imagine the unit cell for diamond as a face-centered cubic structure with an 
additional carbon atom in half of the eight tetrahedral holes located directly beneath 
each corner atom. Notice the similarity between the diamond unit cell and the zinc 
blende unit cell that we discussed in Section 12.5. Notice also that each carbon atom is 
covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron. This struc-
ture extends throughout the entire crystal, so that a diamond crystal can be thought of 
as a giant molecule, held together by these covalent bonds.
Because covalent bonds are very strong, diamond has a very high melting point (it is 
estimated to melt at about 3800 °C). The electrons in diamond are confined to the cova-
lent bonds and are not free to flow. Therefore, diamond does not conduct electricity. 
Diamond is very hard and is an excellent conductor of heat. Consequently, the largest 
use of diamonds is for abrasives and cutting tools. Small diamonds are used at the cut-
ting edge of tools, making the edges much harder and giving them a longer life. Natural 
diamonds are valued as gems for their brilliance and relative inertness.

Connection 12.4
 
Phase Changes and Pressure  Why do high pressures favor the formation 
of diamond from graphite?
In the 1980s, researchers discovered a new form of carbon when they aimed a pow-
erful laser at a graphite surface. This new form of carbon occurs as soccer-ball-shaped 
clusters of 60 carbon atoms (C60). The atoms form five- and six-membered carbon rings 
wrapped into a 20-sided icosahedral structure (Figure 12.19▼). The compound was 
named buckminsterfullerene, honoring R. Buckminster Fuller (1895–1983), a twentieth-
century engineer and architect who advocated the construction of buildings using a 
structurally strong geodesic dome shape that he patented.

Chapter 12  Solids and Modern Materials
Researchers have since identified carbon clusters similar to C60 containing from 36 to 
over 100 carbon atoms. As a class, these carbon clusters are called fullerenes and nick-
named buckyballs. At room temperature, fullerenes are black solids similar to graphite—the 
individual clusters are held to one another by dispersion forces. Fullerenes are somewhat 
soluble in nonpolar solvents, and the different fullerenes form solutions of different colors.
Researchers have also synthesized long carbon structures called nanotubes, which 
consist of sheets of interconnected C6 rings that assume the shape of a cylinder (like a 
roll of chicken wire). The first nanotubes discovered consisted of tubes with double 
walls of C6 rings with closed ends. The ends of the tubes can be opened when they are 
heated under the proper conditions. Today, two general types of nanotubes can be pro-
duced: (1) single-walled nanotubes (SWNT) that have one layer of interconnected C6 rings 
forming the walls and (2) multiwalled nanotubes (MWNT) that have concentric layers of 
interconnected C6 rings forming the walls. In addition, researchers have been able to 
form nanoribbons by slicing open nanotubes. As we discussed in Section 12.1, carbon can 
also form graphene, long, extended sheets of carbon atoms just one atom thick. These 
carbon structures are all shown in Figure 12.20▼.

Nanotubes are 100 times stronger than steel and only 1>16 as dense. Consequently, 
we use carbon nanotubes commercially for lightweight applications that require 
strength, such as golf clubs and bicycle frames. When the nanotubes are lined up paral-
lel to one another, a bundle of the tubes forms a “wire” with very low electrical resis-
tance. These tiny wires raise the possibility of making incredibly small electronic devices.
Silicates
The silicates (extended arrays of silicon and oxygen) are the most common network 
covalent atomic solids. Geologists estimate that 90% of Earth’s crust is composed of 
silicates. Silicon and oxygen form a network covalent structure in which a silicon atom 
bonds to four oxygen atoms, assuming a tetrahedral shape with the silicon atom in 
the middle and the four oxygen atoms at the corners of the tetrahedron 
(Figure 12.21▶).
In this structure, the silicon atom bonds to each oxygen atom with a 
single covalent sigma bond. In contrast to carbon, which often bonds to oxy-
gen with a double bond (one sigma and one pi bond), silicon typically forms 
only a single bond with oxygen because the silicon atom is too large to allow 
substantial overlap between the p-orbitals on the two atoms. The silicon 
atom in this structure, by bonding to four oxygen atoms, obtains a complete 
octet. However, each oxygen atom is one electron short of an octet. There-
fore, each O atom forms a second covalent bond to a different Si atom, result-
ing in the three-dimensional structure of quartz. Quartz has a formula unit 
of SiO2 and is generally called silica. In silica, each Si atom is in a tetrahe-
dron surrounded by four O atoms, and each O atom acts as a bridge connect-
ing the corners of two tetrahedrons (Figure 12.22▶). See Section 23.3 for a 
more extended discussion of silicate structures.
	 12.7	 Ceramics, Cement, and Glass
The silicate structures we examined in Section 12.6 are common in ceramics, cement, 
and glass. These substances are used in buildings, electrical devices, pottery, and 
kitchenware. If you look around wherever you are sitting at this moment, you are likely 
to see examples of these materials. In this section of the chapter, we examine each of 
these amazing classes of materials individually.
Ceramics
Ceramics are traditionally defined as inorganic nonmetallic solids that are prepared 
from powders usually mixed with water, formed into the desired shape and then heated. 
Ceramics are extensively used to make bricks, tiles, pottery, dishware, and insulating 
elements in electrical devices. They display a range of properties but are usually hard, strong, 
nonconductive, and brittle. The word “ceramics” originates from the Greek keramikos. 
Keramikos is an area of Athens that was the potters’ quarter of the city, and the Greeks were 
among the first accomplished potters. However, pottery itself predates recorded history. 
The oldest known example is the Venus of Dolni, a figurine that dates to 29,000–25,000 
BCE. Ceramics can be categorized into three types: silicate, oxide, and nonoxide.
Silicate Ceramics
Many ceramics are composed of aluminosilicates, a class of minerals in which some of 
the silicon atoms in the silicate structure are replaced by aluminum (see Section 23.3). 
The weathering of naturally occurring aluminosilicates produces clays, which are essen-
tially powdered forms of the minerals mixed with water. When heated, reactions occur 
that transform the clay into the ceramic substance.
For example, the clay kaolinite, Al2Si2O5(OH)4, undergoes irreversible chemical and 
structural changes when heated (or fired) above 1500 °C. These changes transform the 
clay into a white ceramic solid containing an extended network of Si-O and Al-O tetrahe-
dra. Kaolinite is the most important component of porcelain, a ceramic substance that

Chapter 12  Solids and Modern Materials
originated in China during the Han dynasty about 2000 years ago. Chinese porcelain 
was superior to previous ceramics and became highly valued and prized for its beauty 
and durability, especially when formed into cups for drinking tea. The Chinese profit-
ably exported their porcelain wares to the Middle East and the West and kept their recipe 
for making it a secret for hundreds of years. The term china today still refers to the fine 
plates, saucers, and cups made from porcelain and related ceramic materials. Silicate 
ceramics also find extensive use as insulators in electrical applications.
Oxide Ceramics
Among the most common oxide ceramics are Al2O3 and MgO. These materials demonstrate 
the advantages and disadvantages of ceramic materials compared to metals. Al2O3 melts at 
2072 °C, compared to aluminum metal, which melts at 660 °C. MgO melts at an even higher 
temperature (2852 °C). Both are physically and chemically stable at high temperatures. The 
high melting point and chemical stability make Al2O3 and MgO outstanding refractory 
materials—materials that can be used in high-temperature applications.
For example, aluminum oxide and magnesium oxide are used in industrial furnaces, 
high-speed cutting tools, crucibles, heating elements, and fire proofing. Engineers have long 
desired to take advantage of the high-temperature stability of ceramics to make ceramic 
engines. A ceramic engine can run at a higher temperature, which makes it more efficient 
and would require less cooling. However, certain less desirable characteristics of ceramics 
have made that pursuit difficult. Ceramic materials tend to be brittle and subject to thermal 
shock (they can crack upon fast changes in temperature). Metals can bend and stretch under 
stress, but ceramics break. Even though ceramics have found some limited use as compo-
nents of engines, a completely ceramic mass-produced engine remains elusive.
Nonoxide Ceramics
The nonoxide ceramics include substances such as Si3N4, BN, and SiC. Silicon nitride is a 
network covalent solid with a structure similar to silica; the silicon atoms sit in the center 
of nitrogen tetrahedra that are linked. Silicon nitride is used extensively in engine parts and 
nonmetallic ball bearings. Boron nitride is isoelectronic with C2 (BN and C2 have the same 
number of valence electrons) and forms structures similar to carbon. For example, BN can 
form layered sheets (similar to graphite), which are covalently bound within the sheets but 
with only dispersion forces between the sheets. As a result, this form of BN makes a good 
high-temperature lubricant. Another form of boron nitride has the diamond structure, 
which results in a hard, strong substance similar to diamond. This form of boron nitride is 
used as an abrasive and to make cutting tools. Boron nitride can even form nanotubes similar 
to those formed by carbon. Silicon carbide also has a diamond structure, but in silicon 
carbide, half of the carbon atoms are replaced by silicon atoms. It too finds applications as an 
abrasive, and it is also used as a refractory material and an additive to steel.
Cement
Cement was first discovered by the Romans, who used lime, volcanic ash, and clay to 
make a pourable slurry that hardened into a rocklike substance. The Romans used 
cement to construct the 43.3-m-diameter dome of the Pantheon, a 2000-year-
old edifice. This dome remains the largest unreinforced concrete dome in 
existence.
The majority of the cement used today is Portland cement. Portland 
cement is a powdered mixture consisting mostly of limestone (CaCO3) and 
silica (SiO2), with smaller amounts of alumina (Al2O3), iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3), 
and gypsum (CaSO4 #  2H2O). The powdered mixture reacts with water in a 
number of complex reactions that produce a final rocklike substance. Unlike 
clays, which lose water upon setting, Portland cement reacts with water as it 
hardens. The hardening process involves the formation of Si-O-Si bridges that 
produce fibrous structures. These structures bond strongly to each other (and 
most other substances). The original Portland cement was patented in 1824 
by an English bricklayer named Joseph Aspidin (1788–1855). The hardened 
cement resembles a prestigious building stone from the Isle of Portland in 
Southwest England and derives its name from this resemblance.

Portland cement is combined with sand and pebbles to make concrete, the most 
widely used building material in the world. Concrete dramatically revolutionized construc-
tion. Before concrete, buildings were made exclusively by arranging the materials piece by 
piece. With the development of concrete, buildings could literally be poured into place. 
Concrete is used extensively to make foundations, walls, buildings, bridges, aqueducts, 
roads, and dams. About half of all the structures humans construct are made of concrete.
Glass
Silica melts when heated above 1500 °C. After melting, if cooled quickly, silica does 
not crystallize back into the quartz structure. Instead, the Si atoms and O atoms form 
a randomly ordered amorphous structure called a glass. Silicate glass is transparent, 
impervious to water, and an outstanding material for making windows and drinking 
vessels. The Egyptians and Greeks likely made glass objects; however, the Romans in the 
first century BCE were the first to extensively develop glass making. They discovered that 
adding sodium carbonate to silica dramatically lowers its melting point, allowing glass 
to form at much lower temperatures. In addition, they developed glass-blowing, which 
involves melting glass and then using a tube to blow the glass into spherical shapes.
When SiO2 is made into a glass, the result is called vitreous silica or fused silica. 
This type of glass is hard, resists high temperatures, has a low thermal expansion, and is 
transparent to both visible light and ultraviolet light. Vitreous silica (because of the high 
temperatures required to produce it) is too expensive for most common applications. 
The most common modern glass is soda-lime glass, which is also referred to as window 
glass. Soda-lime glass is about 70% SiO2; the balance is mostly Na2O and CaO. This type 
of glass is transparent to visible light (not ultraviolet) and has a high thermal expansion, 
but it is less expensive to make and form into desired shapes than vitreous silica.
One disadvantage of soda-lime glass is its tendency to crack under thermal shock. 
Adding boric oxide (B2O3) to the glass mixture instead of CaO produces borosilicate 
glass (also known as Pyrex®), which expands less when heated. As a result, vessels 
made of Pyrex® can withstand heating and cooling cycles that would shatter soda-lime 
glass. The beakers, flasks, and other glassware found in most chemistry labs are made of 
borosilicate glass.
Leaded glass (often called crystal, even though it is not a crystal) results when PbO 
is mixed with SiO2 and a couple of other minor components. This type of glass has a 
higher index of refraction (it bends light more than ordinary glass), which results in 
glassware with a more brilliant appearance than soda-lime glass. It also makes a ringing 
sound when tapped, which is a common test to distinguish lead crystal from ordinary 
glass. Recent concerns about the toxicity of lead in leaded glass have led to the develop-
ment of lead-free alternatives (often called lead-free crystal) for stemware and drinking 
glasses, which has properties similar to those of leaded glass, but without the negative 
health risks.
	 12.8	 Semiconductors and Band Theory
Recall that in Section 12.4 we discussed a model for bonding in metals called the 
electron sea model, which we first introduced and explained in Section 9.11. We now 
turn to a model for bonding in solids that is both more sophisticated and more broadly 
applicable—it applies to both metallic solids and covalent solids. The model is band 
theory, and it grows out of molecular orbital theory, first discussed in Section 10.8.
Molecular Orbitals and Energy Bands
Recall that according to molecular orbital theory, the atomic orbitals of the atoms 
combine within a molecule to form molecular orbitals. These molecular orbitals are not 
localized on individual atoms but delocalized over the entire molecule. Similarly, in band 
theory, the atomic orbitals of the atoms within a solid crystal combine to form orbitals 
that are not localized on individual atoms, but delocalized over the entire crystal. In 
some sense, the crystal is like a very large molecule, and its valence electrons occupy the 
molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of each atom in the crystal.
▲ Leaded glass has a higher index 
of refraction than ordinary glass, 
making it appear more brilliant.
▲ Glass blowing involves blowing 
air into a hot piece of glass to form 
spherical shapes.
The amount of lead that leaches 
into a drink from leaded glass 
over a short period of time is likely 
inconsequential. However, storing 
drinks in leaded glass for long periods 
of time can lead to elevated lead 
levels in the liquid.

Chapter 12  Solids and Modern Materials
Consider a series of molecules constructed from individ-
ual lithium atoms. The energy levels of the atomic orbitals 
and resulting molecular orbitals for Li, Li2, Li3, Li4, and LiN 
(where N is a large number on the order of 1023) are shown in 
Figure 12.23◀. The lithium atom has a single electron in a 
single 2s atomic orbital. The Li2  molecule contains two elec-
trons and two molecular orbitals. The electrons occupy the 
lower-energy bonding orbital—the higher-energy, or anti-
bonding, molecular orbital is empty. The Li4  molecule con-
tains four electrons and four molecular orbitals. The electrons 
occupy the two bonding molecular orbitals—the two anti-
bonding orbitals are completely empty.
The LiN molecule contains N electrons and N molecular 
orbitals. However, because there are so many molecular orbitals, the energy spacings 
between them are infinitesimally small; they are no longer discrete energy levels, but 
rather they form a band of energy levels. One half of the orbitals in the band (N>2) are 
bonding molecular orbitals, and (at 0 K) these orbitals contain the N valence electrons; 
this band is called the valence band. The other N>2 molecular orbitals are antibonding 
and (at 0 K) are completely empty; this band is called the conduction band. If the 
atoms composing a solid have p orbitals available, then the same process leads to another 
set of bands at higher energies.
In lithium metal, the highest occupied molecular orbital lies in the middle of a band 
of orbitals, and the energy difference between it and the next higher-energy orbital is 
infinitesimally small. Therefore, above 0 K, electrons can easily make the transition from 
the valence band to the conduction band. Because electrons in the conduction band are 
mobile, lithium, like all metals, is a good electrical conductor. Mobile electrons in the 
conduction band are also responsible for the thermal conductivity of metals. When a 
metal is heated, electrons are excited to higher-energy molecular orbitals. These elec-
trons quickly transport the thermal energy throughout the crystal lattice.
In metals, the valence band and conduction band are energetically continuous—the 
energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction 
band is infinitesimally small. In semiconductors and insulators, however, an energy gap, 
called the band gap, exists between the valence band and conduction band as shown in 
Figure 12.24▼. Band gaps are usually specified in units of electron volts abbreviated as 
eV (1 eV = 1.602 *  10-19J). In insulators, the band gap is large, and electrons are not 
promoted into the conduction band at ordinary temperatures, resulting in no electrical 
conductivity. In semiconductors, the band gap is smaller. As a result, the conductivity of 
semiconductors increases with increasing temperature because heat allows a greater 
number of electrons to be thermally promoted into the conduction band.

Notice that the band gap decreases as you move down the column of elements. 
Why? We know from our discussion of periodic properties (see Section 8.6) that atomic 
radius increases as we move down a column in the periodic table. The increasing radius 
reduces the overlap between orbitals on neighboring atoms, which in turn reduces the 
energy difference between the antibonding orbitals (the conduction band) and the 
bonding orbitals (the valence band). This results in a decreasing band gap as you move 
down the column of elements.
Doping: Controlling the Conductivity  
of Semiconductors
Doped semiconductors contain minute amounts of impurities that result in additional 
electrons in the conduction band or electron “holes” in the valence band. For example, 
silicon is a group 4A semiconductor. Its valence electrons just fill its valence band. The 
band gap in silicon is large enough that only a few electrons are promoted into the 
conduction band at room temperature; therefore, silicon is a poor electrical conductor. 
However, silicon can be doped with phosphorus, a group 5A element with five valence 
electrons, to increase its conductivity. The phosphorus atoms are incorporated into 
the silicon crystal structure, and each phosphorous atom brings with it one additional 
electron. Since the valence band is completely full, the additional electrons must go 
into the conduction band. These electrons are then mobile and can conduct electrical 
current. This type of semiconductor is an n-type semiconductor because the charge 
carriers are negatively charged electrons in the conduction band.
Silicon can also be doped with a group 3A element, such as gallium, which has only 
three valence electrons. When gallium is incorporated into the silicon crystal structure, 
gallium atoms trap some of the electrons in silicon’s valence band, resulting in electron 
“holes,” or empty molecular orbitals, in the valence band. The presence of holes also 
allows for the movement of electrical current because electrons in the valence band can 
move between holes. In this way, the holes move in the opposite direction as the elec-
trons. This type of semiconductor is a p-type semiconductor because each hole acts 
as a positive charge.
At the heart of most modern electronic devices are silicon chips containing millions 
of p–n junctions, tiny spots that are p-type on one side and n-type on the other. These 
junctions can serve a number of functions, including acting as diodes (circuit elements 
that allow the flow of electrical current in only one direction) or amplifiers (elements 
that amplify a small electrical current into a larger one).

	 12.9	 Polymers and Plastics
Polymers are long, chainlike molecules composed of repeating units called 
monomers. In Chapter 22, we discuss natural polymers such as starches, proteins, and 
DNA, which play important roles in living organisms. In this section, we learn about 
synthetic polymers, which we encounter daily in plastic products such as PVC tubing, 
styrofoam coffee cups, nylon rope, and plexiglass windows. Polymeric materials are 
common in our everyday lives, found in everything from computers to toys to packaging 
materials. Most polymers are durable, partly because of the length of their molecules. In 
general, the longer a molecule, the greater the intermolecular forces between molecules 
and the higher the melting point and boiling point of the substance. Since breaking 
or tearing a polymeric material involves either overcoming the intermolecular forces 
between chains or actually breaking the covalent bonds between monomers, polymers 
tend to be durable materials.

Polyethylene is an addition polymer, a polymer in which the monomers link 
together without the elimination of any atoms. Polyethylene is the plastic that is used 
for milk jugs, juice containers, and garbage bags. The properties of polyethylene depend 
on the exact structure of the ethylene chain and the resulting structure of the material. 
Although polymers are generally amorphous, they can have regions of crystallinity. For 
polyethylene, the degree of crystallinity depends in part on the degree of branching in 
the chain. High-density polyethylene (HDPE), for example, has little branching, so that 
the chains can align closer to one another, resulting in high crystallinity, high density, 
and good strength and heat resistance. Common plastic milk jugs are made of HDPE 
(Figure 12.25◀). Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), in contrast, has more highly 
branched chains. This branching prevents the chains from interacting as efficiently, 
resulting in lower crystallinity, density, and strength and heat resistance. Many com-
mon plastic bags are made of LDPE.
Substituted polyethylenes make up an entire class of polymers (Table 12.3). For 
example, polyvinyl chloride (PVC)—the plastic used to make certain kinds of pipes and 
plumbing fixtures—is composed of monomers in which a chlorine atom has been sub-
stituted for one of the hydrogen atoms in ethene (Figure 12.26▼). These monomers, 
which are shown here, react to form PVC:

The product that forms between the reaction of two monomers is a dimer. The 
polymer (nylon 6,6) forms as the dimer continues to add more monomers. Polymers that 
eliminate an atom or a small group of atoms during polymerization are­ condensation 
polymers. Nylon 6,6 and other similar nylons are drawn into fibers and used to make 
consumer products such as panty hose, carpet fibers, and fishing line (see Chemistry in

n 1965, Stephanie Kwolek, working for DuPont to de-
velop new polymer fibers, noticed an odd cloudy product 
from a polymerization reaction. Some researchers might 
have rejected the product, but Kwolek insisted on examin-
ing its properties more carefully. The results were aston-
ishing—when the polymer was spun into a fiber, it was 
stronger than any fiber known before. Kwolek had discov-
ered Kevlar, a material that is pound for pound five times 
stronger than steel.

Chapter 12  Solids and Modern Materials
Key Concepts
Crystalline Structures (12.2–12.4)
▶
▶X-ray crystallography uses the diffraction pattern of X-rays to de-
termine the crystal structure of solids.
▶
▶The crystal lattice is represented by a unit cell, a structure  
that reproduces the entire lattice when repeated in all three 
­dimensions.
▶
▶Three basic cubic unit cells are the simple cubic, the body-­centered 
cubic, and the face-centered cubic.
▶
▶Some crystal lattices can also be depicted as closest-packed 
­structures, including the hexagonal closest-packing structure (not 
cubic) and the cubic closest-packing structure (which has a face-
centered cubic unit cell).
▶
▶The basic types of crystal solids are molecular, ionic, and atomic 
solids. We divide atomic solids into three different types: non-
bonded, metallic, and network covalent.
Ionic Solids (12.5)
▶
▶Unit cells in the structures of ionic solids are charge neutral. The 
unit cells must also accommodate the difference in size between 
the anion and cation.
▶
▶Common unit cells for ionic compounds include the sodium 
chloride unit cell, the zinc blende unit cell, and the calcium fluo-
ride unit cell.
Network Covalent Atomic Solids (12.6)
▶
▶Network covalent solids are composed of extended arrays of atoms 
held together by covalent bonds.
▶
▶Common network covalent solids include diamond, graphite, gra-
phene, and silica.
Ceramics, Cement, and Glass (12.7)
▶
▶Ceramics are inorganic nonmetallic solids that are prepared from 
powders typically mixed with water, formed into the ­desired 
shape, and then heated. Ceramics are usually hard, strong, 
­nonconductive, and brittle.
▶
▶Cement is a powdered mixture consisting mostly of limestone 
(CaCO3) and silica (SiO2), with smaller amounts of other sub-
stances. When cement is mixed with water, it reacts to form a 
hard, stone-like substance.
▶
▶Glass is primarily amorphous SiO2 or silica. Silicate glass is trans-
parent, impervious to water, and an outstanding material for 
­making windows and drinking vessels.
Semiconductors and Band Theory (12.8)
▶
▶Band theory is a model for bonding in solids in which the atomic 
orbitals of the atoms are combined and delocalized over the en-
tire crystal solid. In band theory, solids form energy bands that are 
­occupied by electrons.
▶
▶In metals, the valence band (composed of bonding molecular 
­orbitals) is continuous with the conduction band (composed of 
antibonding molecular orbitals).
▶
▶Semiconductors have a small energy gap–called the band gap–­
between the valence band and the conduction band.
▶
▶Semiconductors can be doped with small amounts of impurities 
to modify their conductivity.
Polymers and Plastics (12.9)
▶
▶Polymers are long, chainlike molecules that consist of repeating 
units called monomers. They can be natural or synthetic.
▶
▶Polyethylene is an addition polymer, a polymer formed without 
the elimination of any atoms.
▶
▶Condensation polymers, such as nylon, are formed by the elimi-
nation of small groups of atoms.

Questions for Group Work
Discuss these questions with the group and record your consensus 
answer.
	100. 	Have each group member select one of the cubic crystalline lat-
tices. Learn everything you can about your lattice and present it 
to the group.
	101. 	Using group members to play the role of atoms or molecules, 
demonstrate the main structural features of the following cate-
gories of crystalline solids: molecular solid, ionic solid, non-
bonded solid, metallic solid, network covalent solid. Clearly 
identify what you represent and how you are representing vari-
ous interactions between particles (e.g., covalent bond, ionic 
bond, etc.).
	102. 	Make a list of questions you would need to ask in order to classify 
a solid into one of the categories of crystalline solids (molecular 
solid, ionic solid, nonbonded solid, metallic solid, and network 
covalent solid). Determine a good order to ask them. (You may 
need a branching decision tree.) Once you have agreed on a 
good set of questions, have each group member choose a sub-
stance from the chapter and then have the other group mem-
bers ask the questions in turn until the correct classification is 
reached. You may agree to edit your questions if you discover 
ways to improve them when you are using your decision tree.
	103. 	Have each group member select and study a material from the

your material to the group, and see if they can identify the type 
of material based on your description (without consulting the 
text).
	104. 	Describe how a common object or toy (e.g., a train, building 
blocks, or beads on a string) could represent the structure of a

Data Interpretation and Analysis 
Magnesium Niobium Hydride as a Source  
of Hydrogen Fuel
	105. 	The use of hydrogen as a fuel to power cars and trucks is an 
active research area. One challenge is storing the hydrogen, 
which is problematic because the steel fuel tanks are heavy and 
the hydrogen gas can explode in a crash.
Some metals have the ability to absorb hydrogen gas to 
form metal hydrides. For example, niobium and magnesium 
each react with hydrogen gas to form niobium hydride and 
magnesium hydride, respectively:
 Nb(s) + H2(g) ¡ NbH2(s)   ∆H = -127 kJ>mol H2
 Mg(s) + H2(g) ¡ MgH2(s)   ∆H = -77 kJ>mol H2
Metal hydrides make it possible to store a large amount of 
­hydrogen in a small space. Once each of these reactions occurs, 
the hydrogen is stored in the solid metal hydride. After a metal 
hydride is formed, the process can be reversed.
Not all elements form hydrides. Table a lists some ­elements 
that form hydrides and some that do not.

as a function of hydrogen content for several hydrides.

▲ Drinking seawater causes 
dehydration because seawater 
draws water out of body tissues.
W
e learned in Chapter 1 that most of the matter we encounter is in the form of 
mixtures. In this chapter, we focus on homogeneous mixtures, known as solu-
tions. Solutions are mixtures in which atoms and molecules intermingle on 
the molecular and atomic scale. Common examples of solutions include ocean water, 
gasoline, and air. Why do solutions form? How are their properties different from the 
properties of the pure substances that compose them? As you read this chapter, keep in 
mind the large number of solutions that surround you at every moment, including 
those that exist within your own body.
	 13.1	 Thirsty Solutions: Why You Shouldn’t 
Drink Seawater
In the popular novel Life of Pi by Yann Martel, the main character (whose name is Pi) is 
stranded on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger in the middle of the Pacific Ocean for 227 days. 
Pi survives in part by rigging a solar still to distill seawater for drinking. However, in the 
first three days of his predicament (before he rigs the still) he becomes severely dehy-
drated from lack of water. He is surrounded by seawater, but drinking that water would 
only have made his condition worse. Why? Seawater actually draws water out of the body 
as it passes through the stomach and intestines, resulting in diarrhea and further dehy-
dration. We can think of seawater as a thirsty solution—one that draws more water to 
itself. Consequently, seawater should never be consumed as drinking water.

572	
Chapter 13  Solutions
Seawater is a solution, a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances or com-
ponents as shown in Figure 13.1▼. The majority component in a solution is typically 
called the solvent, and the minority component is called the solute. In seawater, water 
is the solvent, and sodium chloride is the primary solute. Solutions form in part because 
of the intermolecular forces we discussed in Chapter 11. In most solutions, the particles 
of the solute interact with the particles of the solvent through intermolecular forces.
In some cases, the concepts of 
solute and solvent are not useful. 
For example, a homogeneous mixture 
of water and ethanol can contain 
equal amounts of both components, 
and neither component can then be 
identified as the solvent.

▶ Figure 13.1  A Typical 
Solution  In seawater, sodium 
chloride is the primary solute. Water 
is the solvent.
The reason that seawater draws water to itself is related to nature’s tendency 
toward spontaneous mixing, which we discuss in more detail later in this chapter 
and in Chapter 18. For now, we simply observe that unless the mixing process is 
highly unfavorable energetically, substances tend to combine into uniform mixtures, 
not separate into pure substances. For example, suppose pure water and a sodium 
chloride solution are in separate compartments with a removable barrier between 
them, as shown in Figure 13.2(a)▼. If we remove the barrier, the two liquids sponta-
neously mix, eventually forming a more dilute sodium chloride solution of uniform 
concentration, as shown in Figure 13.2(b)▼. The tendency toward mixing results in a 
uniform concentration of the final solution.
Seawater is a thirsty solution because of this tendency toward mixing. As seawater 
moves through the intestine, it flows past cells that line the digestive tract. These cells 
consist of largely fluid interiors surrounded by membranes. Cellular fluids themselves 
contain dissolved ions, including sodium and chloride, but the fluids in the cells are 
more dilute than seawater. Nature’s tendency toward mixing (which tends to produce 
solutions of uniform concentration), together with the selective permeability of the cell

membranes (which allows water to flow in and out, but restricts the flow of dissolved 
solids), cause a flow of solvent out of the body’s cells into the seawater. In this way, the two 
solutions become more similar in concentration (as though they had mixed). The solu-
tion in the intestine becomes somewhat more dilute than it was, and the solution in the 
cells becomes somewhat more concentrated. The accumulation of extra fluid in the 
intestines causes diarrhea, and the decreased fluid in the cells causes dehydration. If Pi 
had drunk the seawater instead of constructing the solar still, neither he nor his 
­companion, the large Bengal tiger, would have survived their ordeal.
▲ Club soda is a solution of carbon 
dioxide and water.
	 13.2	 Types of Solutions and Solubility
A solution may be composed of a solid and a liquid (such as the salt and water 
that are the primary components of seawater), but it may also be composed of a 
gas and a liquid, two different liquids, or other combinations (see Table 13.1). In 
aqueous solutions, water is the solvent, and a solid, liquid, or gas is the solute. 
For example, sugar water and salt water are both aqueous solutions. Similarly, 
ethyl alcohol—the alcohol in alcoholic beverages—readily mixes with water to 
form a solution, and carbon dioxide dissolves in water to form the aqueous solu-
tion that we know as club soda.

◀ Seawater is a more concentrated 
solution than the fluids in body cells. 
As a result, when seawater flows 
through the digestive tract, it draws 
water out of the surrounding tissues.
You probably know from experience that a particular solvent, such as water, does 
not dissolve all possible solutes. For example, you cannot clean your greasy hands with 
water alone because the water does not dissolve the grease. However, another solvent, 
such as paint thinner, can easily dissolve the grease. The grease is insoluble in water but 
soluble in the paint thinner. The solubility of a substance is the amount of the sub-
stance that will dissolve in a given amount of solvent. The solubility of sodium chloride 
in water at 25 °C is 36 g NaCl per 100 g water, whereas the solubility of grease in water is 
nearly zero. The solubility of one substance in another depends both on the tendency 
toward mixing that we discussed in Section 13.1 and on the types of intermolecular 
forces that we discussed in Chapter 11.

Chapter 13  Solutions
Nature’s Tendency toward Mixing: Entropy
So far in this book, we have seen that many physical systems tend toward lower 
potential energy. For example, two particles with opposite charges (such as a proton 
and an electron or a cation and an anion) move toward each other because their 
potential energy decreases as their separation decreases according to Coulomb’s 
law. The formation of a solution, however, does not necessarily lower the potential 
energy of its constituent particles. The clearest example of this phenomenon is the 
formation of a homogeneous mixture (a solution) of two ideal gases. Suppose that we 
enclose neon and argon in a container with a removable barrier between them, as 
shown in Figure 13.3(a)◀. As soon as we remove the barrier, the neon and argon mix 
together to form a solution, as shown in Figure 13.3(b)◀. Why?
At low pressures and moderate temperatures, both neon and argon behave as 
ideal gases—they do not interact with each other in any way (that is, there are no sig-
nificant intermolecular forces between their constituent particles). When the barrier 
is removed, the two gases mix, but their potential energy remains unchanged. In 
other words, we cannot think of the mixing of two ideal gases as lowering their potential 
energy. Rather, the tendency to mix is related to a concept called entropy.
Entropy is a measure of energy randomization or energy dispersal in a system. 
Recall that a gas at any temperature above 0 K has kinetic energy due to the motion of 
its atoms. When neon and argon are confined to their individual compartments, 
their kinetic energies are also confined to those compartments. When the barrier 
between the compartments is removed, each gas—along with its kinetic energy—
becomes spread out or dispersed over a larger volume. Thus, the mixture of the two 
gases has greater energy dispersal, or greater entropy, than the separated components.
The pervasive tendency for energy to spread out, or disperse, whenever it is not restrained 
from doing so is the reason that two ideal gases mix. Another common example of the 
tendency toward energy dispersal is the transfer of thermal energy from hot to cold. If 
we heat one end of an iron rod, the thermal energy deposited at the end of the rod will 
spontaneously spread along the entire length of the rod. In contrast to the mixing of 
two ideal gases—where the kinetic energy of the particles becomes dispersed over a 
larger volume because the particles themselves become dispersed—the thermal energy 
in the rod, initially concentrated in relatively fewer particles, becomes dispersed by 
being distributed over a larger number of particles. The tendency for energy to disperse 
is why thermal energy flows from the hot end of the rod to the cold one, and not the 
other way around. Imagine a metal rod that became spontaneously hotter on one end 
and ice cold on the other—this does not happen because energy does not spontane-
ously concentrate itself. In Chapter 18, we will see that the dispersal of energy is actually 
the fundamental criterion that ultimately determines the spontaneity of any process.
The Effect of Intermolecular Forces
We have just seen that, in the absence of intermolecular forces, two substances spontane-
ously mix to form a homogeneous solution. We know from Chapter 11, however, that solids 
and liquids exhibit a number of different types of intermolecular forces including disper-
sion forces, dipole–dipole forces, hydrogen bonding, and ion–dipole forces (Figure 13.4▶). 
These forces may promote the formation of a solution or prevent it, depending on the 
nature of the forces in the particular combination of solute and solvent.
Intermolecular forces exist between (a) the solvent and solute particles, (b) the 
solvent particles themselves, and (c) the solute particles themselves, as shown in  
Figure 13.5▶.

The potential energy of the gas 
particles does not change upon 
mixing because the gas is ideal; the 
particles do not exert any attractive 
or repulsive forces on each other, so 
mixing does not change their potential 
energy.

Solution may or may not form,

As Table 13.2 indicates, a solution always forms if the solvent–solute interactions 
are comparable to, or stronger than, the solvent–solvent interactions and the solute–
solute interactions. For example, consider mixing the hydrocarbons pentane (C5H12) 
and heptane (C7H16). The intermolecular forces present within both pentane and 
heptane are dispersion forces. Similarly, the intermolecular forces present between 
heptane and pentane are also dispersion forces. All three interactions are of similar 
magnitude, so the two substances are soluble in each other in all proportions—they 
are said to be miscible. The formation of the solution is driven by the tendency 
toward mixing, or toward greater entropy, that we just discussed.

◀ Figure 13.5  Forces in a

these three interactions determine 
whether a solution forms.
If solvent–solute interactions are weaker than solvent–solvent and solute–solute 
interactions—in other words, if solvent molecules and solute molecules each interact 
more strongly with molecules of their own kind than with molecules of the other 
kind—then a solution may still form, depending on the relative disparities between the 
interactions. If the disparity is small, the tendency to mix results in the formation of a 
solution even though the process is energetically uphill. If the disparity is large, how-
ever, a solution does not form. For example, consider mixing hexane and water. The 
water molecules have strong hydrogen-bonding attractions to each other but cannot 
form hydrogen bonds with hexane. The energy required to pull water molecules away 

576	
Chapter 13  Solutions
from one another is too great, and too little energy is returned 
when the water molecules interact with hexane molecules. As a 
result, a solution does not form when we mix hexane and water. 
Although the tendency to mix is strong, it cannot overcome the 
large energy disparity between the powerful solvent–solvent 
interactions and the weak solvent–solute interactions.
In general, we can use the rule of thumb that like dissolves like 
when predicting the formation of solutions. Similar kinds of sol-
vents dissolve similar kinds of solutes. Polar solvents, such as water, 
tend to dissolve many polar or ionic solutes, and nonpolar solvents, 
such as hexane, tend to dissolve many nonpolar solutes. Table 13.3 
lists some common polar and nonpolar laboratory solvents.

body fluids and are easily eliminated in the urine, so there is little danger of overconsumption. Fat-soluble vitamins, on

	 13.3	 Energetics of Solution Formation
In Chapter 6, we examined the energy changes associated with chemical reactions. Sim-
ilar energy changes can occur when a solution forms, depending on the magnitude of 
the interactions between the solute and solvent particles. For example, when we dissolve 

578	
Chapter 13  Solutions
sodium hydroxide in water, heat is evolved—the solution process is exothermic. In con-
trast, when we dissolve ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) in water, heat is absorbed—this 
solution process is endothermic. Other solutions, such as sodium chloride in water, barely 
absorb or evolve heat upon formation. What causes these different behaviors?
Energy Changes in Solution Formation
We can understand the energy changes associated with solution formation by envision-
ing the process as occurring in three steps, each with an associated change in enthalpy:
1.	 Separating the solute into its constituent particles.
∆Hsolute > 0
This step is always endothermic (positive ΔH) because energy is required to over-
come the forces that hold the solute particles together.
2.	 Separating the solvent particles from each other to make room for the solute particles.
∆Hsolvent > 0
This step is also endothermic because energy is required to overcome the intermo-
lecular forces among the solvent particles.
3.	 Mixing the solute particles with the solvent particles.
∆Hmix < 0
+
This step is exothermic because energy is released as the solute particles interact 
(through intermolecular forces) with the solvent particles.
According to Hess’s law, the overall enthalpy change upon solution formation, called 
the enthalpy of solution (𝚫Hsoln), is the sum of the changes in enthalpy for each step:
ΔHsoln =  ΔHsolute  +   ΔHsolvent  +   ΔHmix
	
endothermic (+)	
endothermic (+)	
exothermic (-)
Since the first two terms are endothermic (positive ΔH) and the third term is exothermic 
(negative ΔH), the overall sign of ΔHsoln depends on the magnitudes of the individual 
terms, as shown in Figure 13.6▶.
1.	 If the sum of the endothermic terms is approximately equal in magnitude to the exothermic 
term, then ΔHsoln is about zero. The increasing entropy upon mixing drives the forma-
tion of a solution while the overall energy of the system remains nearly constant.
2.	 If the sum of the endothermic terms is smaller in magnitude than the exothermic term, 
then ΔHsoln is negative and the solution process is exothermic. In this case, both the ten-
dency toward lower energy and the tendency toward greater entropy drive the for-
mation of a solution.
3.	 If the sum of the endothermic terms is greater in magnitude than the exothermic term, then 
ΔHsoln is positive and the solution process is endothermic. In this case, as long as ΔHsoln 
is not too large, the tendency toward greater entropy still drives the formation of a 
solution. If, on the other hand, ΔHsoln is too large, a solution does not form.

Many common solutions, such as the seawater mentioned in Section 13.1, contain an 
ionic compound dissolved in water. In these aqueous solutions, ΔHsolvent and ΔHmix can be 
combined into a single term called the heat of hydration (𝚫Hhydration) (Figure 13.7▼).

▶ Figure 13.8  Ion–Dipole 
Interactions  Ion–dipole 
interactions such as those between 
potassium ions, fluoride ions, and 
water molecules cause the heat 
of hydration to be largely negative 
(exothermic).
The heat of hydration is the enthalpy change that occurs when 1 mol of the gaseous solute 
ions is dissolved in water. Because the ion–dipole interactions that occur between a dis-
solved ion and the surrounding water molecules (Figure 13.8▲) are much stronger than 
the hydrogen bonds in water, ΔHhydration is always largely negative (exothermic) for ionic 
compounds. Using the heat of hydration, we can write the enthalpy of solution as a sum of 
just two terms, one endothermic and one exothermic:
∆Hsoln = ∆Hsolute + ∆Hsolvent + ∆Hmix
∆Hsoln = ∆Hsolute

For ionic compounds, ΔHsolute, the energy required to separate the solute into its 
constituent particles, is the negative of the solute’s lattice energy (ΔHsolute = -ΔHlattice), 
discussed in Section 9.4. For ionic aqueous solutions, then, the overall enthalpy of solu-
tion depends on the relative magnitudes of ΔHsolute and ΔHhydration, with three possible 
scenarios (in each case we refer to the magnitude (absolute value) of ΔH):
1.	 ∣𝚫Hsolute∣* ∣𝚫Hhydration∣. The amount of energy required to separate the solute 
into its constituent ions is less than the energy given off when the ions are hydrated. 
ΔHsoln is therefore negative, and the solution process is exothermic. Solutes with 
negative enthalpies of solution include lithium bromide and potassium hydroxide. 
When these solutes dissolve in water, the resulting solutions feel warm to the touch:

2.	 ∣𝚫Hsolute∣+ ∣𝚫Hhydration∣. The amount of energy required to separate the solute 
into its constituent ions is greater than the energy given off when the ions are hy-
drated. ΔHsoln is therefore positive, and the solution process is endothermic (if a so-
lution forms at all). Solutes that form aqueous solutions with positive enthalpies of 
solution include ammonium nitrate and silver nitrate. When these solutes dissolve 
in water, the resulting solutions feel cool to the touch:

The dissolution of a solute in a solvent is an equilibrium process similar to the equilib-
rium process associated with a phase change (discussed in Chapter 11). Imagine, from 
a molecular viewpoint, the dissolution of a solid solute such as sodium chloride in a 
liquid solvent such as water (Figure 13.9▼). Initially, water molecules rapidly solvate 
sodium cations and chloride anions, resulting in a noticeable decrease in the amount of 
solid sodium chloride in the water. Over time, however, the concentration of dissolved

sodium chloride in the solution increases. This dissolved sodium chloride then begins 
to recrystallize as solid sodium chloride. Initially the rate of dissolution far exceeds the 
rate of recrystallization, but as the concentration of dissolved sodium chloride increases, 
the rate of recrystallization also increases. Eventually, the rates of dissolution and recrys-
tallization become equal—dynamic equilibrium has been reached.
NaCl(s) ∆Na +(aq) + Cl -(aq)
A solution in which the dissolved solute is in dynamic equilibrium with the solid 
(undissolved) solute is a saturated solution. If you add additional solute to a saturated 
solution, it will not dissolve. A solution containing less than the equilibrium amount of 
solute is an unsaturated solution. If you add additional solute to an unsaturated solution, 
it will dissolve.
Under certain circumstances, a supersaturated solution—one containing more 
than the equilibrium amount of solute—may form. Supersaturated solutions are unsta-
ble and the excess solute normally precipitates out of the solution. However, in some 
cases, if left undisturbed, a supersaturated solution can exist for an extended period of 
time. For example, in a common classroom demonstration, a tiny piece of solid sodium 
acetate is added to a supersaturated solution of sodium acetate. This triggers the precipi-
tation of the solute, which crystallizes out of solution in a dramatic and often beautiful 
way (Figure 13.10▲).
The Temperature Dependence of the Solubility of Solids
The solubility of solids in water can be highly dependent on temperature. Have you ever 
noticed how much more sugar you can dissolve in hot tea than in cold tea? Although 
exceptions exist, the solubility of most solids in water increases with increasing temperature, 
as shown in Figure 13.11▼. For example, the solubility of potassium nitrate (KNO3) at

room temperature is about 37 g KNO3 per 100 g of water. At 50 °C, the solubility rises to 
88 g KNO3 per 100 g of water.
A common way to purify a solid is a technique called recrystallization. In this 
technique, enough solid is added to water (or some other solvent) to create a saturated 
solution at an elevated temperature. As the solution cools, it becomes supersaturated 
and the excess solid precipitates out of solution. If the solution cools slowly, the solid 
forms crystals as it comes out of solution. The crystalline structure tends to reject impu-
rities, resulting in a purer solid.
You can use the temperature dependence of the solubility of solids to make rock candy. 
Prepare a saturated sucrose (table sugar) solution at an elevated temperature, and allow a 
string or stick to dangle into the solution for several days. As the solution cools and the sol-
vent evaporates, the solution becomes supersaturated and sugar crystals grow on the string 
or stick. After several days, beautiful edible crystals or “rocks” of sugar cover the string.
Factors Affecting the Solubility of Gases in Water
Solutions of gases dissolved in water are common. Club soda, for example, is a solution 
of carbon dioxide and water, and most liquids exposed to air contain dissolved gases 
from air. Fish and other aquatic animals depend on the oxygen dissolved in lake or ocean 
water for life, and our blood contains dissolved nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. 
Even tap water contains dissolved gases. The solubility of a gas in a liquid is affected by 
both temperature and pressure.
The Effect of Temperature
You can observe the effect of temperature on the solubility of a gas in water by heating 
ordinary tap water on a stove. Before the water reaches its boiling point, small bubbles 
develop in the water. These bubbles are the dissolved air (mostly nitrogen and oxygen) 
coming out of solution. (Once the water boils, the bubbling becomes more vigorous—
these larger bubbles are composed of water vapor.) The dissolved air comes out of the 
heated solution because—unlike solids, whose solubility generally increases with increas-
ing temperature—the solubility of gases in water decreases with increasing temperature.
The inverse relationship between gas solubility and temperature is the reason that 
warm soda pop bubbles more than cold soda pop when you open it and warm beer goes 
flat faster than cold beer. More carbon dioxide comes out of these solutions at room tem-
perature than at a lower temperature because the gas is less soluble at room temperature. 
The decreasing solubility of gases with increasing temperature is also the reason that fish 
don’t bite much in a warm lake. The warm temperature results in a lower oxygen con-
centration. With lower oxygen levels, the fish become lethargic and do not strike as 
aggressively at the lure or bait you cast their way.

Solubility and Temperature  A solution is saturated in both nitrogen gas and 
potassium bromide at 75 °C. When the solution is cooled to room temperature, what is 
most likely to happen?
(a)	 Some nitrogen gas bubbles out of solution.
(b)	 Some potassium bromide precipitates out of solution.
(c)	 Some nitrogen gas bubbles out of solution, and some potassium bromide 
­precipitates out of solution.
(d)	 Nothing happens.
The Effect of Pressure
The solubility of gases also depends on pressure. The higher the pressure of a gas above a 
liquid, the more soluble the gas is in the liquid. In a sealed can of soda pop, for example, 
the carbon dioxide is maintained in solution by a high pressure of carbon dioxide within 
the can. When the can is opened, this pressure is released and the solubility of carbon 
dioxide decreases, resulting in bubbling (Figure 13.12▶, on the next page).

▶ Figure 13.12  Soda Fizz   
The bubbling that occurs when a can 
of soda is opened results from the 
reduced pressure of carbon dioxide 
over the liquid. At lower pressure, 
the carbon dioxide is less soluble 
and bubbles out of solution.
The increased solubility of a gas in a liquid can be understood by considering cylin-
ders containing water and carbon dioxide gas:
The first cylinder represents an equilibrium between gaseous and dissolved carbon 
dioxide—the rate of carbon dioxide molecules entering solution exactly equals the rate 
of molecules leaving the solution. Now imagine decreasing the volume, as we have 
done in the second cylinder. The pressure of carbon dioxide increases, causing the rate 
of molecules entering the solution to rise. The number of molecules in solution 
increases until equilibrium is established again, as shown in the third cylinder. How-
ever, the amount of carbon dioxide in solution in the third cylinder is greater.
We quantify the solubility of gases with increasing pressure with Henry’s law:
Sgas = kHPgas
where Sgas is the solubility of the gas (usually in M), kH is a constant of proportionality 
(called the Henry’s law constant) that depends on the specific solute and solvent and also 
on temperature, and Pgas is the partial pressure of the gas (usually in atm). The equation 
shows that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the 
gas above the liquid. Table 13.4 lists the Henry’s law constants for several common gases.

large answer (for example, over 100 atm) would be suspect because an ordinary can or bottle probably could not sustain 
such high pressures without bursting.

As we have seen, the amount of solute in a solution is an important property of the solu-
tion. For example, the amount of sodium chloride in a solution determines whether or 
not the solution will cause dehydration if consumed. A dilute solution contains small 
quantities of solute relative to the amount of solvent. Drinking a dilute sodium chlo-
ride solution does not cause dehydration. A concentrated solution contains large 
­quantities of solute relative to the amount of solvent. Drinking a concentrated sodium 
chloride solution does cause dehydration. Common ways of reporting solution con-
centration include molarity, molality, parts by mass, parts by volume, mole fraction,

ost people living near Lake Nyos in the West African  
country of Cameroon began August 22, 1986, like any 
other day. Unfortunately, their day ended in tragedy. On that 
­evening, a large cloud of carbon dioxide gas burped up from the 
depths of Lake Nyos, killing over 1700 people and about 3000 
cattle. Two years before, a similar tragedy had occurred in Lake 
Monoun, just 60 miles away, killing 37 people. Today, scientists 
have taken steps to prevent these lakes from accumulating the 
carbon dioxide that caused the disasters.
lake. The carbon dioxide forms a solution with the lake water. 
The high pressure at the bottom of the deep lake allows the 
solution to become highly concentrated in carbon dioxide. 
The 1986 disaster occurred because over time—either 
­because of the high concentration itself or because of some 
other natural trigger such as a landslide or small earth-
quake—some gaseous carbon dioxide escaped. The rising 
bubbles disrupted the stratified layers of lake water, causing 
water at the bottom of the lake to rise to a region of lower 
pressure. The drop in pressure decreased the solubility of the 
carbon dioxide, so more carbon dioxide bubbles formed. This 
in turn caused more churning and still more carbon dioxide 
release. The result was a massive cloud of carbon dioxide 
gas that escaped from the lake. Since carbon dioxide is 
heavier than air, the carbon dioxide traveled down the sides 
of the volcano and into the nearby valley, displacing air and 
asphyxiating many of the local residents.
In an effort to keep these events from recurring, scientists 
have constructed a piping system that slowly vents carbon 
­dioxide from the lake bottom, preventing the buildup that led 
to the tragedy.

Table 13.5  Solution Concentration Terms
Note that molarity is moles of solute per liter of solution, not per liter of solvent. 
To make a solution of a specified molarity, we usually put the solute into a flask and 
then add water (or another solvent) to the desired volume of solution, as shown in 
Figure 13.13▼. Molarity is a convenient unit to use when making, diluting, and trans-
ferring solutions because it specifies the amount of solute per unit of solution.

solution, we add 1 mol of the solid to a flask and dilute with water to make 1 L of solution.
Molarity depends on volume, and because volume varies with temperature, molar-
ity also varies with temperature. For example, a 1 M aqueous solution at room tempera-
ture is slightly less than 1 M at an elevated temperature because the volume of the 
solution is greater at the elevated temperature.

Molality
A concentration unit that is independent of temperature is molality (m), the amount 
of solute (in moles) divided by the mass of solvent (in kilograms):
Molality (m) = amount solute (in mol)
mass solvent (in kg)
Notice that molality is defined with respect to kilograms solvent, not kilograms solution. 
Molality is particularly useful when we need to compare concentrations over a range of 
different temperatures.
Molality is abbreviated with a 
lowercase italic m, and molarity is 
abbreviated with a capital M.

Connection 13.5
Molality  If you combine 25.0 g of a solute that has a mass of 25.0 g>mol with  
100.0 g of a solvent, what is the molality of the resulting solution?
 
Parts by Mass and Parts by Volume
It is often convenient to report a concentration as a ratio of masses. A parts by mass 
concentration is the ratio of the mass of the solute to the mass of the solution, all multi-
plied by a multiplication factor:
Mass solute 
Mass solution  *  multiplication factor
The concentration of the solution determines the best parts by mass unit (and therefore 
the multiplication factor) to use. For example, for percent by mass the multiplication 
factor is 100:
Percent by mass =  mass solute 
mass solution  *  100%
Percent means per hundred; a solution with a concentration of 14% by mass contains 14 g 
of solute per 100 g of solution.
For more dilute solutions, we might use parts per million (ppm), which has a 
multiplication factor of 106, or parts per billion (ppb), which has a multiplication 
factor of 109.
 ppm =
mass solute 
mass solution  *  106
 ppb =
mass solute 
mass solution *  109
A solution with a concentration of 15 ppm by mass, for example, contains 15 g of solute 
per 106 g of solution.
Sometimes, we report concentrations as a ratio of volumes, especially for solutions 
in which both the solute and solvent are liquids. A parts by volume concentration is 
usually the ratio of the volume of the solute to the volume of the solution, all multiplied 
by a multiplication factor:
Volume solute 
 Volume solution *  multiplication factor
The multiplication factors are identical to those just described for parts by mass concen-
trations. For example, a 22% ethanol solution by volume contains 22 mL of ethanol for 
every 100 mL of solution.
Using Parts by Mass (or Parts by Volume)  
in Calculations
We can use the parts by mass (or parts by volume) concentration of a solution as a 
conversion factor between mass (or volume) of the solute and mass (or volume) of the 
For dilute aqueous solutions near

divided by the total amount of solute and solvent (in moles). This ratio is the mole 
fraction (xsolute):
xsolute =
amount solute (in mol)
total amount of solute and solvent (in mol) =
nsolute
nsolute + nsolvent
The mole fraction can also be defined 
for the solvent: 
xsolvent =
nsolvent
nsolute + nsolvent

Using Parts by Mass in Calculations
What volume (in mL) of a soft drink that is 10.5% sucrose (C12H22O11) by mass contains 78.5 g of sucrose? (The density 
of the solution is 1.04 g>mL.)
SORT  You are given a mass of sucrose and the 
­concentration and density of a sucrose solution, and 
you are asked to find the volume of solution containing 
the given mass.

CHECK  The units of the answer are correct. The magnitude seems correct because the solution is approximately 10% 
sucrose by mass. Since the density of the solution is approximately 1 g>mL, the volume containing 78.5 g sucrose should 
be roughly 10 times larger, as calculated (719 ≈10 * 78.5).

Chemistry in the Environment | The Dirty Dozen
A
 number of potentially harmful chemicals—such as DDT, 
dioxin, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)—can make 
their way into water sources from industrial dumping, atmo-
spheric emissions, agricultural use, and household dump-
ing. Since crops, livestock, and fish consume water, they 
too can accumulate these chemicals. Human consumption 
of food or water contaminated with harmful chemicals can 
lead to a number of diseases and adverse health effects 
such as increased cancer risk, liver damage, and central 
nervous system damage. Governments around the world 
have joined forces to ban the production of a number of 
these kinds of chemicals—called persistent organic pollut-
ants or POPs. The original treaty named the Stockholm Con-
vention on Persistent Organic Pollutants was signed in 
2001. It targeted 12 such substances referred to as the 
“dirty dozen” (Table 13.6).

cide, industrial by-product

is their contribution to a process called bioamplification. 
­Because they are nonpolar, these chemicals are stored and 
concentrated in the fatty tissues of the organisms that con-
sume them. As larger organisms eat smaller ones, they 
­consume more of the stored chemicals. The result is an  
increase in the concentrations of these chemicals as they 
move up the food chain.
◀ The bald eagle was 
nearly driven to extinction 
by human use of DDT. 
Bald eagles eat fish, which 
became contaminated due 
to bioamplification. The 
DDT consumed with the 
fish caused the eagle's egg 
shells to become fragile. 
The DDT ban has allowed 
the bald eagle population to 
recover.
▲ Potentially harmful chemicals make their way into water 
sources in many ways.
For example, the use of DDT nearly drove the bald eagle 
(whose egg shells were greatly weakened by eating fish con-
taminated with DDT) to extinction. In 1963, the population 
dwindled to less than 500 nesting pairs. Fortunately, nearly all 
intentional production of DDT (and the other chemicals on this 
list) has been banned. The bald eagle population has recov-
ered to an estimated 10,000 nesting pairs. The recovery has 
been so strong that the bald eagle has been removed from 
both the endangered and threatened species lists.
In the United States, the presence of these contaminants in 
water supplies is monitored by the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA). The EPA has set limits, called maximum contami-
nant levels (MCLs), for each of these contaminants in food and 
drinking water. Table 13.7 lists some MCLs for selected com-
pounds in water supplies. Notice the units that the EPA uses to 
express the concentration of the contaminants, mg>L. This unit 
is a conversion factor between liters of water consumed and the 
mass (in mg) of the pollutant. According to the EPA, as long as 
the contaminant concentrations are below these levels, the 
water is safe to drink.

Dioxin

One problem common to all of these chemicals is their 
persistence in the environment. These compounds are fairly 
stable and do not break down under normal environmental 
conditions. Once they get into the environment, they stay 
there for a long time. A second problem with these chemicals

	 13.6	 Colligative Properties: Vapor Pressure 
Lowering, Freezing Point Depression, 
Boiling Point Elevation, and Osmotic 
Pressure
Have you ever wondered why you add salt to the ice in an ice-cream maker? Or why salt 
is scattered on icy roads in cold climates? Salt lowers the temperature at which a saltwa-
ter solution freezes. A salt and water solution remains liquid even below 0  °C. When salt 
is added to ice in the ice-cream maker, an ice/water/salt mixture forms that can reach a 
temperature of about -10 °C, at which point the cream freezes. On the winter road, the 
salt allows the ice to melt when the ambient temperature is below freezing.
The depression of the freezing point of water by salt is an example of a colligative 
property, a property that depends on the number of particles dissolved in solution, not 
on the type of particle. In this section, we examine four colligative properties: vapor pres-
sure lowering, freezing point depression, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pressure.
Since these properties depend on the number of dissolved particles, nonelectro-
lytes are treated slightly differently than electrolytes when determining colligative 
properties. When 1 mol of a nonelectrolyte dissolves in water, it forms 1 mol of dis-
solved particles. When 1 mol of an electrolyte 
dissolves in water, however, it normally forms 
more than 1 mol of dissolved particles (as shown 
in Figure 13.14▶). For example, when 1 mol of 
NaCl dissolves in water, it forms 1 mol of dis-
solved Na +  ions and 1 mol of dissolved Cl -  ions. 
Therefore, the resulting solution has 2 mol of dis-
solved particles. The colligative properties of 
electrolyte solutions reflect this higher concen-
tration of dissolved particles. In this section we 
examine colligative properties of nonelectrolyte 
solutions; we expand the concept to include elec-
trolyte solutions in Section 13.7.
Vapor Pressure Lowering
Recall from Section 11.5 that the vapor pressure of a liquid is the pressure of the gas 
above the liquid when the two are in dynamic equilibrium (that is, when the rate of 
vaporization equals the rate of condensation). How does a nonvolatile nonelectrolyte 
solute affect the vapor pressure of the liquid into which it dissolves? The basic answer to 
this question is that the vapor pressure of the solution is lower than the vapor pressure of the 
pure solvent. We can understand why this happens in two different ways.
The simplest explanation for why the vapor pressure of a solution is lower than that 
of the pure solvent is related to the concept of dynamic equilibrium itself. Consider the 
following representation of a liquid in dynamic equilibrium with its vapor. Here the rate 
of vaporization is equal to the rate of condensation:

Na+
Cl−
8 ions
▲ In winter, salt is often applied to 
roads so that the ice will melt at 
lower temperatures.

chloride is dissolved in water, each

Chapter 13  Solutions
When a nonvolatile solute is added, however, the solute particles (shown in red) 
interfere with the ability of the solvent particles (blue) to vaporize. The rate of vaporiza-
tion is thus diminished compared to that of the pure solvent:
Rate of vaporization
reduced by solute
The change in the rate of vaporization creates an imbalance in the rates; the rate of 
condensation is now greater than the rate of vaporization. The net effect is that some of 
the molecules that were in the gas state condense into the liquid state. As they condense, 
the reduced number of molecules in the gas state causes the rate of condensation to 
decrease. Eventually the two rates become equal again, but only after the concentration 
of solvent molecules in the gas state has decreased:
Equilibrium reestablished
but with fewer molecules
in gas phase
The result is a lower vapor pressure for the solution compared to the pure solvent.
A more fundamental explanation of why the vapor pressure of a solution is lower 
than that of the pure solvent is related to the tendency toward mixing (toward greater 
entropy) that we discussed in Sections 13.1 and 13.2. Recall that a concentrated solution 
is a thirsty solution—it has the ability to draw solvent to itself. We can see a dramatic dem-
onstration of this tendency by placing a concentrated solution of a nonvolatile solute

and a beaker of the pure solvent in a sealed container. Over time, the level of the pure 
solvent will drop, and the level of the solution will rise as molecules vaporize out of the 
pure solvent and condense into the solution.
Notice the similarity between this process and the dehydration caused by drink-
ing seawater. In both cases, a concentrated solution has the ability to draw solvent to 
itself. The reason is nature’s tendency to mix. If a pure solvent and concentrated 
solution are combined in a beaker, they naturally form a mixture in which the con-
centrated solution becomes less concentrated than it was initially. Similarly, if a pure 
solvent and concentrated solution are combined in a sealed container—even though 
they are in separate beakers—the two mix so that the concentrated solution becomes 
less concentrated.
The net transfer of solvent from the beaker containing pure solvent to the one con-
taining the solution shows that the vapor pressure of the solution is lower than that of 
the pure solvent. As solvent molecules vaporize, the vapor pressure in the sealed con-
tainer rises. Before dynamic equilibrium can be attained, however, the pressure exceeds 
the vapor pressure of the solution, causing molecules to condense into the solution (the 
beaker on the right). Therefore, molecules constantly vaporize from the pure solvent, 
but the solvent’s vapor pressure is never reached because molecules are constantly con-
densing into the solution. The result is a continuous transfer of solvent molecules from 
the pure solvent to the solution.
We can quantify the vapor pressure of a solution with Raoult’s law:
Psolution = xsolvent P °solvent
In this equation, Psolution is the vapor pressure of the solution, xsolvent is the mole frac-
tion of the solvent, and P °solvent is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent at the same 
temperature. For example, suppose a water sample at 25 °C contains 0.900 mol of 
water and 0.100 mol of a nonvolatile solute such as sucrose. The pure water has a 
vapor pressure of 23.8 torr. We calculate the vapor pressure of the solution by substi-
tuting into Raoult’s law:
 Psolution = xH2O P °Η2Ο
 = 0.900(23.8 torr)
 = 21.4 torr
Notice that the vapor pressure of the solution is directly proportional to the amount of 
the solvent in the solution. Since the solvent particles compose 90% of all of the parti-
cles in the solution, the vapor pressure of the solution is 90% of the vapor pressure of the 
pure solvent.
To arrive at an equation that shows how much the vapor pressure is lowered by a 
solute, we define the vapor pressure lowering (𝚫P) as the difference in vapor pres-
sure between the pure solvent and the solution:
ΔP = P °solvent - Psolution
Then, for a two-component solution, we can substitute xsolvent = 1 - xsolute into  
Raoult’s law:
 Psolution = xsolventP °solvent
 Psolution = (1 - xsolute) P °solvent
 P °solvent - Psolution = xsolute P °solvent
     
 ΔP = xsolute P °solvent
This last equation indicates that the lowering of the vapor pressure is directly 
­proportional to the mole fraction of the solute.

Vapor Pressures of Solutions Containing a Volatile 
(Nonelectrolyte) Solute
Some solutions contain not only a volatile solvent, but also a volatile solute. In this case, 
both the solvent and the solute contribute to the overall vapor pressure of the solution. A 
solution like this may be an ideal solution (in which case its behavior follows Raoult’s 
law at all concentrations for both the solvent and the solute), or it may be nonideal (in 
which case it does not follow Raoult’s law).
An ideal solution is similar in concept to an ideal gas. Just as an ideal gas follows the 
ideal gas law exactly, so an ideal solution follows Raoult’s law exactly. In an ideal solu-
tion, the solute–solvent interactions are similar in magnitude to the solute–solute and 
solvent–solvent interactions. In this type of solution, the solute simply dilutes the sol-
vent and ideal behavior is observed. The vapor pressure of each solution component is 
described by Raoult’s law throughout the entire composition range of the solution. For a 
two-component solution containing liquids A and B, we write:
 PA = xΑP °A
 PB = xΒP °B
The total pressure above such a solution is the sum of the partial pressures of the 
components:
Ptot = PΑ + PΒ
Figure 13.15(a)▼ is a plot of vapor pressure versus solution composition for an ideal two-
component solution.
In a nonideal solution, the solute–solvent interactions are either stronger or weaker 
than the solvent–solvent interactions. If the solute–solvent interactions are stronger, 
then the solute tends to prevent the solvent from vaporizing as readily as it would other-
wise. If the solution is sufficiently dilute, then the effect will be small and Raoult’s law 
works as an approximation. However, if the solution is not dilute, the effect will be sig-
nificant and the vapor pressure of the solution will be less than that predicted by Raoult’s 
law, as shown in Figure 13.15(b)▼.
If, however, the solute–solvent interactions are weaker than solvent–solvent interac-
tions, then the solute tends to allow more vaporization than would occur with just the 
solvent. If the solution is not dilute, the effect will be significant and the vapor pressure 
of the solution will be greater than predicted by Raoult’s law, as shown in Figure 13.15(c)▼.

vapor pressures of each component and the total vapor pressure above the solution. The experimentally measured total 
vapor pressure of the solution at 35 °C is 645 torr. Is the solution ideal? If not, what can you say about the relative 
strength of carbon disulfide–acetone interactions compared to the acetone–acetone and carbon disulfide–carbon 
disulfide interactions?
SORT  You are given the masses and vapor 
pressures of carbon disulfide and acetone and 
are asked to find the vapor pressures of each 
component in the mixture and the total pres-
sure assuming ideal behavior.

2.43 g CH3COCH3
P °CS2 = 515 torr (at 35 °C)
P °CH3COCH3 = 332 torr (at 35 °C)
Ptot(exp) = 645 torr (at 35 °C)
FIND:  PCS2, PCH3COCH3, Ptot(ideal)
STRATEGIZE  This problem requires that 
you use Raoult’s law to calculate the partial 
pressures of each component. In order to use 
Raoult’s law, first calculate the mole fractions 
of the two components. Convert the masses 
of each component to moles and then use 
the definition of mole fraction to calculate 
the mole fraction of carbon disulfide. You 
can then find the mole fraction of acetone 
because the mole fractions of the two 
­components add up to 1.
Use the mole fraction of each component 
along with Raoult’s law to calculate the 
partial pressure of each component. The total 
pressure is the sum of the partial pressures.

Calculate the total pressure by summing the 
partial pressures.
 Ptot(ideal) = 285 torr + 148 torr
 = 433 torr
Lastly, compare the calculated total pressure for 
the ideal case to the experimentally measured 
total pressure. Since the experimentally mea-
sured pressure is greater than the calculated 
pressure, we can conclude that the interactions 
between the two components are weaker than 
the interactions between the components 
themselves.
Ptot(exp) = 645 torr
Ptot(exp) 7 Ptot (ideal)
The solution is not ideal and shows positive deviations from Raoult’s law. 
Therefore, carbon disulfide–acetone interactions must be weaker than 
acetone–acetone and carbon disulfide–carbon disulfide interactions.
CHECK  The units of the answer (torr) are correct. The magnitude seems reasonable given the partial pressures of the pure 
substances.

the following:

Vapor pressure lowering occurs at all temperatures. We can see the effect of vapor pres-

▶ A nonvolatile solute lowers the vapor 
pressure of a solution, resulting in a 
lower freezing point and an elevated 
boiling point.
Notice that the vapor pressure for the solution is shifted downward compared to that of 
the pure solvent. Consequently, the vapor pressure curve intersects the solid–gas curve 
at a lower temperature. The net effect is that the solution has a lower melting point and a 
higher boiling point than the pure solvent. These effects are called freezing point 
depression and boiling point elevation, respectively, both of which are colligative 
properties (like vapor pressure lowering).
The freezing point of a solution containing a nonvolatile solute is lower than the 
freezing point of the pure solvent. For example, antifreeze, used to prevent the freezing 
of engine blocks in cold climates, is an aqueous solution of ethylene glycol (C2H6O2). 
The more concentrated the solution, the lower the freezing point becomes.
The amount that the freezing point decreases is given by the following equation:
ΔTf = m * Kf
where
• ΔTf is the change in temperature of the freezing point in Celsius degrees (relative to 
the freezing point of the pure solvent), usually reported as a positive number;
• m is the molality of the solution in moles solute per kilogram solvent; and
• Kf is the freezing point depression constant for the solvent.
For water,
Kf = 1.86 °C>m
When an aqueous solution containing a dissolved solid solute freezes slowly, the ice 
that forms does not normally contain much of the solute. For example, when ice forms in 
ocean water, the ice is not salt water, but freshwater. As the ice forms, the crystal structure 
of the ice tends to exclude the solute particles. You can verify this yourself by partially 
freezing a saltwater solution in the freezer. Take out the newly formed ice, rinse it several 
times, and taste it. Compare its taste to the taste of the original solution. The ice is much 
less salty.
▲ Antifreeze is an aqueous solution 
of ethylene glycol. The solution has 
a lower freezing point and higher 
boiling point than pure water.

Table 13.8 provides freezing point depression and boiling point elevation constants 
for several liquids. Calculating the freezing point of a solution involves substituting into 
the freezing point depression equation as Example 13.8 demonstrates.
The boiling point of a solution containing a nonvolatile solute is higher than the 
boiling point of the pure solvent. In automobiles, antifreeze not only prevents the freez-
ing of water within engine blocks in cold climates, it also prevents the boiling of water 
within engine blocks in hot climates. The amount that boiling points rise in solutions is 
given by the equation:
ΔTb = m * Kb
where
• ΔTb is the change in temperature of the boiling point in Celsius degrees (relative to 
the boiling point of the pure solvent);
• m is the molality of the solution in moles solute per kilogram solvent; and
• Kb is the boiling point elevation constant for the solvent.

Chemistry IN YOUR DAY | Antifreeze in Frogs
W
ood frogs (Rana sylvatica) look like most other frogs. They are a few inches 
long and have characteristic greenish-brown skin. However, wood frogs sur-
vive cold winters in a remarkable way—they partially freeze. In its partially frozen 
state, a wood frog has no heartbeat, no blood circulation, no breathing, and no 
brain activity. Within 1–2 hours of thawing, however, these vital functions return 
and the frog hops off to find food. How does the wood frog do this?
Most cold-blooded animals cannot survive freezing temperatures because 
the water within their cells freezes. As we learned in Section 11.9, when water 
freezes, it expands, irreversibly damaging cells. When the wood frog hiber-
nates for the winter, however, it produces large amounts of glucose that is se-
creted into its bloodstream and fills the interior of its cells. When the tempera-
ture drops below freezing, extracellular body fluids, such as those in the frog’s 
abdominal cavity, freeze solid. Fluids within cells, however, remain liquid be-
cause the high glucose concentration lowers their freezing point. In other 
words, the concentrated glucose solution within the frog’s cells acts as anti-
freeze, preventing the water within the cells from freezing and allowing the frog 
to survive.
Q u e s t i o n
The wood frog can survive at body temperatures as low as -8.0 °C. Calculate the molality of a glucose solution (C6H12O6) 
required to lower the freezing point of water to -8.0 °C.
▲ The wood frog survives winter by partially 
freezing. It protects its cells by flooding 
them with glucose, which acts as an 
antifreeze.
Osmotic Pressure
The process by which seawater causes dehydration (discussed in Section 13.1) is osmosis. 
Osmosis is the flow of solvent from a solution of lower solute concentration to one of 
higher solute concentration. Concentrated solutions draw solvent from more dilute 
solutions because of nature’s tendency to mix.
Figure 13.16▼ illustrates an osmosis cell. The left side of the cell contains a concentrated 
saltwater solution and the right side of the cell contains pure water. A semipermeable

others—separates the two halves of the cell. Water flows by osmosis from the pure-water 
side of the cell through the semipermeable membrane and into the saltwater side. Over 
time, the water level on the left side of the cell rises, while the water level on the right side of 
the cell falls. If external pressure is applied to the water in the left side, this process can be 
opposed and even reversed. The pressure required to stop the osmotic flow, called the 
osmotic pressure, is given by the following equation:
Π =  MRT
where M is the molarity of the solution, T is the temperature (in Kelvin), and R is the 
ideal gas constant (0.08206 L # atm>mol # K).

13.7  Colligative Properties of Strong Electrolyte Solutions

CHECK   The units of the answer are correct. The magnitude might seem a little high initially, but proteins are large 
­molecules and therefore have high molar masses.
For Practice 13.10  Calculate the osmotic pressure (in atm) of a solution containing 1.50 g ethylene glycol (C2H6O2) 
in 50.0 mL of solution at 25  °C.
	 13.7	 Colligative Properties of Strong 
Electrolyte Solutions
At the beginning of Section 13.6, we saw that colligative properties 
depend on the number of dissolved particles and that we must therefore 
treat electrolytes slightly differently than nonelectrolytes when determin-
ing colligative properties. For example, the freezing point depression of 
a 0.10 m sucrose solution is ΔTf = 0.186  °C. However, the freezing point 
depression of a 0.10 m sodium chloride solution is nearly twice this large. 
Why? Because 1 mol of sodium chloride dissociates into nearly 2 mol of 
ions in solution. The ratio of moles of particles in solution to moles of for-
mula units dissolved is called the van’t Hoff factor (i):

Since 1 mol of NaCl produces 2 mol of particles in solution, we expect the van’t Hoff 
­factor for NaCl to be exactly 2. In reality, this expected factor only occurs in very dilute solu-
tions. For example, the van’t Hoff factor for a 0.10 m NaCl solution is 1.87, and for a 0.010 m 
NaCl solution the van’t Hoff factor is 1.94. 
The van’t Hoff factor approaches the 
expected value at infinite dilution (as the 
concentration approaches zero). Table 
13.9 lists the actual and expected van’t 
Hoff factors for a number of solutes.
The reason that van’t Hoff factors do 
not exactly equal expected values is that 
some ions effectively pair in solution. We 
expect the dissociation of an ionic com-
pound to be complete in solution. In 
reality, however, the dissociation is not 
complete—at any moment, some cations 
pair with anions (Figure 13.17▶), slightly 
reducing the number of particles in 
solution.
To calculate freezing point depression, boiling point elevation, and osmotic pres-
sure of ionic solutions, we use the van’t Hoff factor in each equation as follows:

 ΔTb =  im *  Kb (boiling point elevation)

SOLVE  Solve the freezing point depression equation for i, 
­substituting in the given quantities to calculate its value.
The expected value of i for CaCl2 is 3 because calcium chloride

you would expect upon complete dissociation of CaCl2.
For Practice 13.11  Calculate the freezing point of an aqueous 0.10 m FeCl3 solution using a van’t Hoff factor of 3.2.
Strong Electrolytes and Vapor Pressure
Just as the freezing point depression of a solution containing an electrolyte solute is 
greater than that of a solution containing the same concentration of a nonelectrolyte 
solute, so the vapor pressure lowering is greater (for the same reasons). The vapor pres-
sure for a sodium chloride solution, for example, is lowered about twice as much as it 
is for a nonelectrolyte solution of the same concentration. To calculate the vapor pres-
sure of a solution containing an ionic solute, we need to account for the dissociation 
of the solute when we calculate the mole fraction of the solvent, as we demonstrate in 
Example 13.12.

solution is significantly less than that of the pure solvent, as you would expect for a solution with a significant amount of 
solute.
For Practice 13.12  A solution contains 0.115 mol H2O and an unknown number of moles of sodium chloride. The

number of moles of sodium chloride in the solution.
Colligative Properties and Medical Solutions
Doctors and others health care workers often administer solutions to patients. The 
osmotic pressure of these solutions is controlled for the desired effect on the patient. 
Solutions having osmotic pressures greater than those of body fluids are called hyperos-
motic. These solutions take water out of cells and tissues. When a human cell is placed in 
a hyperosmotic solution, it tends to shrivel as it loses water to the surrounding solution 
(Figure 13.18(b)▼). Solutions having osmotic pressures less than those of body fluids are 
called hyposmotic. These solutions pump water into cells. When a human cell is placed 
in a hyposmotic solution—such as pure water, for example—water enters the cell, some-
times causing it to burst (Figure 13.18(c)▼).

isosmotic (or isotonic). When a patient is given an IV in a hospital, the majority of the 
fluid is usually an isosmotic saline solution—a solution containing 0.9 g NaCl per  
100 mL of solution. In medicine and in other health-related fields, solution concentra-
tions are often reported in units that indicate the mass of the solute per given volume of 
solution. Also common is percent mass to volume—which is the mass of the solute in 
grams divided by the volume of the solution in milliliters times 100%. In these units, the 
concentration of an isotonic saline solution is 0.9% mass>volume.
▶ Fluids used for intravenous 
transfusion must be isosmotic with 
bodily fluids—that is, they must have 
the same osmotic pressure as body 
fluids.
	 13.8	 Colloids
When you mix water and soap together, the resulting mixture has a distinctive haze 
(Figure 13.19◀). Soapy water is hazy because soap and water form a colloidal dispersion 
rather than a true solution. A colloidal dispersion, or more simply a colloid, is a 
mixture in which a dispersed substance (which is solute-like) is finely divided in a dis-
persing medium (which is solvent-like). Examples of colloids including fog, smoke, 
whipped cream, and milk are listed in Table 13.10.
Whether or not a mixture is a colloid is determined by the size of the particles it 
contains. If the particles are small (for example, individual small molecules), then the 
mixture is a solution. If the particles have a diameter greater than 1 µm (for example, 
grains of sand), then the mixture is a heterogeneous mixture. Sand stirred into water 
slowly settles out of the water. If the particles are between 1 nm and 1000 nm in size, the mix-
ture is a colloid. Colloidal particles are small enough that they stay dispersed throughout 
the dispersing medium by collisions with other molecules or atoms. When you view a 
colloidal particle dispersed in a liquid under a microscope, you can witness its jittery 
motion, which proceeds along a random path, as shown in Figure 13.20▶. This motion, 
called Brownian motion, is caused by collisions with molecules in the liquid. In the 
beginning of the twentieth century, Brownian motion was a decisive factor in confirm-
ing the molecular and atomic nature of matter.
Soap forms a colloid because of its unique structure, shown in Figure 13.21▶. One end 
of the molecule is ionic and therefore interacts strongly with water molecules via ion–dipole 
interactions. The other end of the soap molecule is a long, nonpolar, hydrocarbon tail. 
▲ Figure 13.19  A Colloid  Soapy 
water is an example of a colloidal dis-
persion. The haze is due to the scat-
tering of light by the colloidal particles.

Motion  A colloidal particle exhibits

When enough soap is added to water, the soap molecules aggregate in structures called 
micelles (Figure 13.22▼). In a micelle, the nonpolar hydrocarbon tails crowd into the center 
of a sphere to maximize their interactions with one another. The ionic heads orient toward 
the surface of the sphere where they can interact with water molecules. The micelle 
­structures are responsible for the haze seen in soapy water—they are too small to be seen  
by the naked eye, but they still scatter light (as particles in other types of colloids do).

▲ Figure 13.23  The Tyndall Effect  When a light beam passes through a colloidal 
suspension (left), it is visible because the colloid particles scatter some of the light. The beam 
is not visible in a noncolloidal solution (right), nor would it be visible in pure water.
This scattering of light by a colloidal dispersion is known as the Tyndall effect  
(Figure 13.23▲). You can observe the Tyndall effect in other colloids such as fog (water drop-
lets dispersed in air) or dusty air. In fact, you can use the Tyndall effect as a test to determine 
whether a mixture is a solution or a colloid, since solutions contain completely dissolved 
solute molecules that are too small to scatter light.
Colloidal suspensions of micelles are kept stable by electrostatic repulsions that 
occur at their surfaces. For example, in soap, the ionic heads of the soap molecules com-
pose the surface of the spherical particle (Figure 13.24▼). These ionic heads interact 
strongly with water molecules but repel other colloid particles. Heating a colloid com-
posed of micelles can destroy the micelles because collisions occur with enough force to 
overcome the electrostatic repulsions and allow the molecules within the micelles to 
coalesce with those in other micelles. Similarly, adding an electrolyte to a colloidal sus-
pension of micelles can also disrupt the electrostatic repulsions that occur between the 
particles and thus destroy the colloid. For this reason, soap does not work well in a salt-
water solution.
The particles in a colloid need not be clusters of molecules. Some colloids, such as 
many protein solutions, contain dispersed macromolecules. For example, blood con-
tains dispersed hemoglobin. The hemoglobin molecules are so large that they scatter 
light; thus, blood is considered a colloid.

Key Concepts
Solutions (13.1, 13.2)
▶
▶A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. 
In a solution, the majority component is the solvent and the mi-
nority component is the solute.
▶
▶The tendency toward greater entropy (or greater energy dispersal) 
is the driving force for solution formation.
▶
▶In aqueous solutions, water is a solvent, and a solid, liquid, or gas 
is the solute.
Solubility and Energetics of Solution  
Formation (13.2, 13.3)
▶
▶The solubility of a substance is the amount of the substance that 
dissolves in a given amount of solvent. The solubility of one sub-
stance in another depends on the types of intermolecular forces 
that exist between the substances as well as within each substance.
▶
▶We can determine the overall enthalpy change upon solution 
formation by adding the enthalpy changes for the three steps of 
solution formation: (1) separation of the solute particles, (2) sepa-
ration of the solvent particles, and (3) mixing of the solute and 
solvent particles. The first two steps are both endothermic, where-
as the last is exothermic.
▶
▶In aqueous solutions of an ionic compound, the combined change 
in enthalpy for steps 2 and 3 is the heat of hydration (ΔHhydration), 
which is always negative.
Solution Equilibrium (13.4)
▶
▶Dynamic equilibrium in a solution occurs when the rates of dis-
solution and recrystallization in a solution are equal. A solution 
in this state is saturated. Solutions containing less than or more 
than the equilibrium amount of solute are unsaturated or super-
saturated, respectively.
▶
▶The solubility of most solids in water increases with increasing 
temperature.
▶
▶The solubility of gases in water generally decreases with increasing 
temperature, but it increases with increasing pressure.
Concentration Units (13.5)
▶
▶Common units to express solution concentration include 
molarity (M), molality (m), mole fraction (x), mole percent  
(mol %), percent (%) by mass or volume, parts per million 
(ppm) by mass or volume, and parts per billion (ppb) by mass or 
volume. Table 13.5 summarizes these units.
Vapor Pressure Lowering, Freezing Point Depression, 
Boiling Point Elevation, and Osmosis (13.6, 13.7)
▶
▶The presence of a nonvolatile solute in a liquid results in a lower 
vapor pressure of the solution relative to the vapor pressure of the 
pure liquid. Raoult’s law for an ideal solution predicts this lower 
vapor pressure.
▶
▶If the solute–solvent interactions are particularly strong, the ac-
tual vapor pressure is lower than that predicted by Raoult’s law.
▶
▶If the solute–solvent interactions are particularly weak, the actual 
vapor pressure is higher than that predicted by Raoult’s law.
▶
▶The addition of a nonvolatile solute to a liquid results in a solution 
with a lower freezing point and a higher boiling point than those 
of the pure solvent.
▶
▶The flow of solvent from a solution of lower concentration to a 
solution of higher concentration is osmosis.
▶
▶All of these phenomena (vapor pressure lowering, freezing point 
depression, boiling point elevation, and osmosis) are colligative 
properties and depend only on the number of solute particles 
added, not the type of solute particles.

▶
▶Electrolyte solutes have a greater effect on these properties than 
the corresponding amount of a nonelectrolyte solute as specified 
by the van’t Hoff factor.
Colloids (13.8)
▶
▶A colloid is a mixture in which a substance is finely divided in a 
dispersing medium.
▶
▶Colloidal mixtures occur when the dispersed substance ranges in 
size from 1 nm to 1000 nm.
▶
▶One way to identify colloidal mixtures is by their tendency to scat-
ter light, known as the Tyndall effect.

Answers to Conceptual Connections
Solubility
13.1	 The first alcohol on the list is methanol, which is highly polar and 
forms hydrogen bonds with water. It is miscible in water and has 
only limited solubility in hexane, which is nonpolar. However, 
as the carbon chain gets longer in the series of alcohols, the OH 
group becomes less important relative to the growing nonpolar 
carbon chain. Therefore, the alcohols become progressively less 
soluble in water and more soluble in hexane. This table demon-
strates the rule of thumb like dissolves like. Methanol is like water 
and therefore dissolves in water. It is unlike hexane and therefore 
has limited solubility in hexane. As you move down the list, the 
alcohols become increasingly like hexane and increasingly un-
like water and therefore become increasingly soluble in hexane 
and increasingly insoluble in water.
Energetics of Aqueous Solution Formation
13.2	 You can conclude that ΔHsolute6 ΔHhydration. Since ΔHsoln 
is negative, the absolute value of the negative term (ΔHhydration) 
must be greater than the absolute value of the positive term 
(ΔHsolute).
Solubility and Temperature
13.3	 (b) Some potassium bromide precipitates out of solution. The 
solubility of most solids decreases with decreasing tempera-
ture. However, the solubility of gases increases with decreasing 
temperature. Therefore, the nitrogen becomes more soluble 
and will not bubble out of solution.
Henry’s Law
13.4	 Ammonia is the only compound on the list that is polar, so we 
would expect its solubility in water to be greater than the solu-
bilities of the other gases (which are all nonpolar).
Molality
13.5	 The solution has a molality of 10.0 m. You combined 1.00 mol 
of solute with 0.100 kg of solvent, so the molality is 1.00 mol>
0.100 kg = 10.0 m.
Raoult’s Law
13.6	 The solute–solvent interactions must be stronger than the 
solute–solute and solvent–solvent interactions. The stronger 
interactions lower the vapor pressure from the expected ideal 
value of 150 mmHg.
Boiling Point Elevation
13.7	 Solution B because Kb for ethanol is greater than Kb for water.
Colligative Properties
13.8	 (c) The 0.50 M MgCl2 solution has the highest boiling point 
because it has the highest concentration of particles. We ex-

▲ Pouring ice water on a lizard 
slows it down, making it easier to 
catch.
I
n this chapter-opening quotation, Oxford chemistry professor Sir Cyril Hinshelwood 
calls attention to an aspect of chemistry often overlooked by the casual observer—the 
mystery of change with time. Since the opening chapter of this book, you have learned 
that the goal of chemistry is to understand the macroscopic world by examining the molec-
ular one. In this chapter, we focus on understanding how this molecular world changes 
with time, an area of study called chemical kinetics. The molecular world is anything but 
static. Thermal energy produces constant molecular motion, causing molecules to repeat-
edly collide with one another. In a tiny fraction of these collisions, something extraordi-
nary happens—the electrons on one molecule or atom are attracted to the nuclei of anoth-
er. Some bonds weaken and new bonds form—a chemical reaction occurs. Chemical 
kinetics is the study of how these kinds of changes occur in time.
	 14.1	 Catching Lizards
The children who live in my neighborhood (including my own kids) have a unique way 
of catching lizards. Armed with cups of ice water, they chase one of these cold-blooded 
reptiles into a corner, and take aim and pour the cold water directly onto the lizard’s 
body. The lizard’s body temperature drops and it becomes virtually immobilized—easy 
prey for little hands. The kids scoop up the lizard and place it in a tub filled with sand 
and leaves. They then watch as the lizard warms back up and becomes active again. They 
usually release the lizard back into the yard within hours. I guess you could call them 
catch-and-release lizard hunters.

Chapter 14  Chemical Kinetics
Definition of Reaction Rate
When we measure how fast something occurs, or 
more specifically the rate at which it occurs, we usu-
ally express the measurement as a change in some 
quantity per unit of time. For example, we measure the speed of a car—the rate at which 
it travels—in miles per hour, and we measure how quickly (or slowly) people lose weight 
Unlike mammals, which actively regulate their body temperature through meta-
bolic activity, lizards are ectotherms—their body temperature depends on their surround-
ings. When splashed with cold water, a lizard’s body simply gets colder. The drop in 
body temperature immobilizes the lizard because its movement depends on chemical 
reactions that occur within its muscles, and the rates of those reactions—how fast they 
occur—are highly sensitive to temperature. In other words, when the temperature drops, 
the reactions that produce movement in the lizard occur more slowly; therefore, the 
movement itself slows down. When reptiles get cold, they become lethargic, unable to 
move very quickly. For this reason, reptiles try to maintain their body temperature 
within a narrow range by moving between sun and shade.
The rates of chemical reactions, and especially the ability to control those rates, are 
important not just in reptile movement but in many other phenomena as well. For 
example, a successful rocket launch depends on the rate at which fuel burns—too 
quickly and the rocket can explode, too slowly and it will not leave the ground. Chemists 
must always consider reaction rates when synthesizing compounds. No matter how sta-
ble a compound might be, its synthesis is impossible if the rate at which it forms is too 
slow. As we have seen with reptiles, reaction rates are important to life. In fact, the

human body’s ability to switch a specific reaction 
on or off at a specific time is achieved largely by con-
trolling the rate of that reaction through the use of 
enzymes (biological molecules that we explore 
more fully in Section 14.7).
The first person to measure the rate of a chemi-
cal reaction carefully was Ludwig ­Wilhelmy (1812–
1864). In 1850, he measured how fast sucrose, upon 
treatment with acid, hydrolyzed (broke up with the 
addition of water) into glucose and fructose. This 
reaction occurred over several hours, and Wilhelmy 
was able to show how the rate depended on the ini-
tial amount of sugar present—the greater the initial 
amount, the faster the initial rate. Today we can 
measure the rates of reactions that occur in times as 
short as several femtoseconds (femto = 10 - 15). The 
knowledge of reaction rates is not only practically 
important—giving us the ability to control how fast 
a reaction occurs—but also theoretically important. 
As we will discuss in Section 14.6, the rate of a reac-
tion can tell us much about how the reaction occurs 
on the molecular scale.
	 14.2	 The Rate of a 
Chemical Reaction
The rate of a chemical reaction is a measure of how 
fast the reaction occurs, as shown in Figure 14.1◀. If 
a chemical reaction has a fast rate, a large fraction of 
molecules react to form products in a given period 
of time. If a chemical reaction has a slow rate, only 
a relatively small fraction of molecules react to form 
products in a given period of time.

	
14.2  The Rate of a Chemical Reaction	
625
Recall that [A] means the 
concentration of A in M (mol>L).
in pounds per week. We report these rates in units that represent the change in what we 
are measuring (distance or weight) divided by the change in time:
Speed =
change in distance
change in time
= ∆x
∆t  Weight loss =
change in weight
change in time  =
∆ weight
∆t
Similarly, the rate of a chemical reaction is measured as a change in the amounts of 
reactants or products (usually in concentration units) divided by the change in time. For 
example, consider the gas-phase reaction between H2(g) and I2(g):
H2(g) + I2(g) ¡ 2 HI(g)
We can define the rate of this reaction in the time interval t1 to t2 as follows:
	
Rate = - ∆[H2]
∆t
 = - 
[H2]t2 - [H2]t1
t2 - t1

[14.1]
In this expression, [H2]t2 is the hydrogen concentration at time t2 and [H2]t1 is the hydro-
gen concentration at time t1. The reaction rate is defined as the negative of the change in 
concentration of a reactant divided by the change in time. The negative sign is part of 
the definition when we define the reaction rate with respect to a reactant because reac-
tant concentrations decrease as a reaction proceeds; therefore, the change in the concen-
tration of a reactant is negative. The negative sign thus makes the overall rate positive. (By 
convention, we report reaction rates as positive quantities.)
Similarly, we can define the reaction rate with respect to the other reactant:
	
Rate = - ∆[I2]
∆t 
[14.2]
Since 1 mol of H2 reacts with 1 mol of I2, we define the rate in the same way. We can also 
define the rate with respect to the product of the reaction:
	
Rate = +1
2 ∆[HI]
∆t

[14.3]
Because product concentrations increase as the reaction proceeds, the change in 
concentration of a product is positive. Therefore, when we define the rate with respect to 
a product, we do not include a negative sign 
in the definition—the rate is naturally posi-
tive. The factor of 1
2 in this definition is related 
to the stoichiometry of the reaction. In order 
to have a single rate for the entire reaction, 
the definition of the rate with respect to each 
reactant and product must reflect the stoi-
chiometric coefficients of the reaction. For 
this particular reaction, 2 mol of HI is pro-
duced from 1 mol of H2 and 1 mol of I2:
+
The concentration of HI increases at 
twice the rate that the concentration of H2 or 
I2 decreases. In other words, if 100 I2 mole-
cules react per second, then 200 HI molecules 
form per second. In order for the overall rate 
to have the same value when defined with 
respect to any of the reactants or products, we 
must multiply the change in HI concentra-
tion by a ­factor of one-half.
Consider the graph in Figure 14.2▶, 
which represents the changes in concentra-
tion for H2 (one of the reactants) and HI (the 
product) versus time. Let’s examine several 
features of this graph individually.

Chapter 14  Chemical Kinetics
Change in Reactant and Product Concentrations
The reactant concentration, as expected, decreases with time because reactants are con-
sumed in a reaction. The product concentration increases with time because products are 
formed in a reaction. The increase in HI concentration occurs at exactly twice the rate of 
the decrease in H2 concentration because of the stoichiometry of the reaction: 2 mol of 
HI form for every 1 mol of H2 consumed.
The Average Rate of the Reaction
We can calculate the average rate of the reaction for any time interval using Equation 
14.1 for H2. The following table lists H2 concentration ([H2]) at various times, the change 
in H2 concentration for each interval (∆[H2]), the change in time for each interval (∆t), 
and the rate for each interval (-∆[H2]>∆t). The rate is the average rate within the given 
time interval. For example, the average rate of the reaction in the time interval between 
10 and 20 seconds is 0.0149 M>s, whereas the average rate in the time interval between 
20 and 30 seconds is 0.0121 M>s.

Notice that the average rate decreases as the reaction progresses. In other words, the reac-
tion slows down as it proceeds. We discuss this further in the next section, where we will 
see that, for most reactions, the rate depends on the concentrations of the reactants. As 
the reactants transform to products, their concentrations decrease, and the reaction 
slows down.
The Instantaneous Rate of the Reaction
The instantaneous rate of the reaction is the rate at any one point in time and is 
­represented by the instantaneous slope of the curve at that point. We can determine 
the instantaneous rate by calculating the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point 
of interest. In Figure 14.2, we have drawn the tangent lines for both [H2] and [HI] at  
50 seconds. We calculate the instantaneous rate at 50 seconds as follows:
Using [H2]
Instantaneous rate (at 50 s) = - ∆[H2]
∆t
 = - -0.28 M
40 s
 = 0.0070 M>s
Using [HI]
Instantaneous rate (at 50 s) = +1
2 ∆[HI]
∆t
= +1
2 0.56 M
40 s
= 0.0070 M>s
As we would expect, the rate is the same whether we use one of the reactants or the 
product for the calculation. Notice that the instantaneous rate at 50 seconds 
(0.0070 M>s) is between the average rates calculated for the 10-second intervals just 
before and just after 50 seconds.

14.2  The Rate of a Chemical Reaction	
627
We can generalize our definition of reaction rate for the generic reaction:
	
aA + bB ¡ cC + dD
[14.4]
where A and B are reactants, C and D are products, and a, b, c, and d are the stoichiomet-
ric coefficients. We define the rate of the reaction as follows:
	
Rate = -1
a ∆[A]
∆t  = -1
b ∆[B]
∆t  = +1
c ∆[C]
∆t  = +1
d ∆[D]
∆t

[14.5]
From the definition, we can see that knowing the rate of change in the concentra-
tion of any one reactant or product at a point in time allows us to determine the rate of 
change in the concentration of any other reactant or product at that point in time (from 
the balanced equation). However, predicting the rate at some future time is not possible from 
just the balanced equation.
Example 14.1	
Expressing Reaction Rates
Consider this balanced chemical equation:
H2O2(aq) + 3 I -(aq) + 2 H +(aq) ¡ I3
-(aq) + 2 H2O(l)
In the first 10.0 seconds of the reaction, the concentration of I - drops from 1.000 M to 0.868 M.
(a)	 Calculate the average rate of this reaction in this time interval.
(b)	 Determine the rate of change in the concentration of H + (that is, ∆[H +]>∆t) during this time interval.

(b)	 Use Equation 14.5 again for the relationship between the rate of the 
­reaction and ∆[H +]>∆t. After solving for ∆[H +]>∆t, substitute the 
­calculated rate from part (a) and calculate ∆[H +]>∆t.

Measuring Reaction Rates
In order to study the kinetics of a reaction, we must have an experimental way to mea-
sure the concentration of at least one of the reactants or products as a function of time. 
For example, Ludwig Wilhelmy, whose experiment on the rate of the conversion of

light of a specific wavelength is

the intensity of the transmitted 
light—which depends on how much 
light is absorbed by the sample—is 
measured and recorded.
sucrose to glucose and fructose we discussed briefly in Section 14.1, took advantage of 
sucrose’s ability to rotate polarized light. (Polarized light is light with an electric field 
oriented along one plane.) When a beam of polarized light is passed through a sucrose 
solution, the polarization of the light is rotated clockwise. In contrast, the products of 
the reaction (glucose and fructose) rotate polarized light counterclockwise. By measur-
ing the degree of polarization of light passing through a reacting solution—a technique 
known as polarimetry—Wilhelmy was able to determine the relative concentrations of 
the reactants and products as a function of time.
Perhaps the most common way to study the kinetics of a reaction is through spectros-
copy (see Section 7.3). For example, the reaction of H2 and I2 to form HI can be followed 
spectroscopically because I2 is violet and H2 and HI are colorless. As I2 reacts with H2 to 
form HI, the violet color of the reaction mixture fades. We can monitor the fading color 
with a spectrometer, a device that passes light through a sample and measures how strongly 
the light is absorbed (Figure 14.3▼). If the sample contains the reacting mixture, the inten-
sity of the light absorption will decrease as the reaction proceeds, providing a direct mea-
sure of the concentration of I2 as a function of time. Because light travels so fast and 
because experimental techniques can produce very short pulses of light, spectroscopy can 
be used to measure reactions that happen on time scales as short as several femtoseconds.
By measuring changes in pressure, we can also monitor reactions in which the num-
ber of moles of gaseous reactants and products changes as the reaction proceeds. Con-
sider the reaction in which dinitrogen monoxide reacts to form nitrogen and oxygen gas:
2 N2O(g) ¡ 2 N2(g) + O2(g)
For every 2 mol of N2O that reacts, the reaction  
vessel contains one additional mole of gas. As the 
reaction proceeds and the amount of gas increases, 
the pressure steadily rises. We can use the rise in 
pressure to determine the relative concentrations 
of reactants and products as a function of time.
We can use all of the three techniques men-
tioned here—polarimetry, spectroscopy, and pres-
sure measurement—to monitor a reaction as it 
occurs in a reaction vessel. Some reactions occur 
slowly enough that samples, or aliquots, can be 
periodically withdrawn from the reaction vessel 
and analyzed to determine the progress of the reac-
tion. We can use instrumental techniques such as 
gas chromatography (Figure 14.4◀) or mass spec-
trometry, as well as wet chemical techniques such 
as titration, to measure the relative amounts of 
reactants or products in the aliquot. By taking ali-
quots at regular time intervals, we can determine 
the relative amounts of reactants and products as a 
function of time.
▲ Figure 14.4  The Gas Chromatograph  In a gas chromatograph 
(GC), a sample of the reaction mixture, or aliquot, is injected into a specially 
constructed column. Because of their characteristic physical and chemical 
properties, different components of the mixture pass through the column at 
different rates and thus exit at different times. As each component leaves the 
column, it is detected electronically and a chromatogram is recorded. The area 
under each peak in the chromatogram is proportional to the amount of one 
particular component in the sample mixture.

	
14.3  The Rate Law: The Effect of Concentration on Reaction Rate	
629
	 14.3	 The Rate Law: The Effect of 
Concentration on Reaction Rate
The rate of a reaction often depends on the concentration of one or more of the reac-
tants. As we have already seen, Ludwig Wilhelmy noticed this effect for the hydrolysis 
of sucrose. For simplicity, let’s consider a reaction in which a single reactant, A, decom-
poses into products:
A ¡ products
As long as the rate of the reverse reaction (in which the products return to reactants) 
is negligibly slow, we can express the relationship between the rate of the reaction and 
the concentration of the reactant—called the rate law—as follows:
	
Rate = k[A]n 
[14.6]
where k is a constant of proportionality called the rate constant and n is the reaction 
order. The value of n (usually an integer) determines how the rate depends on the con-
centration of the reactant:
• If n = 0, the reaction is zero order and the rate is independent of the concentration 
of A.
• If n = 1, the reaction is first order and the rate is directly proportional to the con-
centration of A.
• If n = 2, the reaction is second order and the rate is proportional to the square of the 
concentration of A.
Although other orders are possible, including noninteger (or fractional) orders, these 
three are the most common.
The Three Common Reaction Orders (n=0, 1, and 2)
Figure 14.5▼ shows three plots illustrating how the concentration of A changes with 
time for the three common reaction orders with identical numerical values for the 
rate constant (k) and identical initial concentrations. Figure 14.6▼ has three plots 
showing the rate of the reaction (the slope of the lines in Figure 14.5) as a function of the 
reactant concentration for each reaction order.

Reaction

Chapter 14  Chemical Kinetics
Zero-Order Reaction
In a zero-order reaction, the rate of the reaction is independent of the con-
centration of the reactant:
	
Rate = k[A]0 = k
[14.7]
Consequently, for a zero-order reaction, the concentration of the reactant 
decreases linearly with time, as shown in Figure 14.5. The slope of the line is 
constant, indicating a constant rate. The rate is constant because the reac-
tion does not slow down as the concentration of A decreases. The graph in 
Figure 14.6 shows that the rate of a zero-order reaction is the same at any 
concentration of A.
Zero-order reactions occur under conditions where the amount of reac-
tant actually available for reaction is unaffected by changes in the overall 
quantity of reactant. For example, sublimation is normally zero order because 
only molecules at the surface of a substance can sublime, and the concen-
tration of the surface molecules does not change as the amount of sublim-
ing substance decreases (Figure 14.7◀).
First-Order Reaction
In a first-order reaction, the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to 
the concentration of the reactant:
	
Rate = k[A]1
[14.8]
For a first-order reaction, the rate slows down as the reaction proceeds because the con-
centration of the reactant decreases. We can see this in Figure 14.5—the slope of the 
curve (the rate) becomes less steep (slower) with time. Figure 14.6 shows the rate as a 
function of the concentration of A. Notice the linear relationship—the rate is directly 
proportional to the concentration.
Second-Order Reaction
In a second-order reaction, the rate of the reaction is proportional to the square of the 
concentration of the reactant:
	
Rate = k[A]2
[14.9]
Consequently, for a second-order reaction, the rate is even more sensitive to the reactant 
concentration. We can see this in Figure 14.5—the slope of the curve (the rate) flattens 
out more quickly than it does for a first-order reaction. Figure 14.6 shows the rate as a 
function of the concentration of A. Notice the quadratic relationship—the rate is pro-
portional to the square of the concentration.
Determining the Order of a Reaction
The order of a reaction can be determined only by experiment. A common way to determine 
reaction order is the method of initial rates. In this method, the initial rate—the rate for 
a short period of time at the beginning of the reaction—is measured by running the 
reaction several times with different initial reactant concentrations to determine the 
effect of the concentration on the rate. For example, let’s return to our simple reaction in 
which a single reactant, A, decomposes into products:
A ¡ products
In an experiment, the initial rate is measured at several different initial concentra-
tions with the following results:
[A] (M)
Initial Rate (M, s)

Sublimation Is Zero Order

When one layer of particles sublimes, the next
layer is exposed. Te number of particles
available to sublime remains constant.
▲ Figure 14.7  Sublimation   
When a layer of particles sublimes, 
another identical layer is just below 
it. Consequently, the number of 
particles available to sublime at 
any one time does not change with 
the total number of particles in the 
sample, and the process is zero 
order.

	
14.3  The Rate Law: The Effect of Concentration on Reaction Rate	
631
In this data set, when the concentration of A doubles, the rate doubles—the initial rate is 
directly proportional to the initial concentration. The reaction is therefore first order in 
A, and the rate law takes the first-order form:
Rate = k[A]1
We can determine the value of the rate constant, k, by solving the rate law for k and sub-
stituting the concentration and the initial rate from any one of the three measurements. 
Here we use the first measurement:
 Rate = k[A]1
 k = rate
[A] =
0.015 M>s
0.10 M
= 0.15 s - 1
Notice that the rate constant for a first-order reaction has units of s - 1.
The following two data sets show how measured initial rates are different for zero-
order and for second-order reactions having the same initial rate at [A] = 0.10 M:
Zero Order (n = 0)
[A] (M)
Initial Rate (M,s)

[A] (M)
Initial Rate (M,s)
0.10
0.015
0.20
0.060
0.40
0.240
For a zero-order reaction, the initial rate is independent of the reactant concentration—
the rate is the same at all measured initial concentrations. For a second-order reaction, 
the initial rate quadruples for a doubling of the reactant concentration—the relation-
ship between concentration and rate is quadratic. If we are unsure about how the initial 
rate is changing with the initial reactant concentration, or if the numbers are not as 
obvious as they are in these examples, we can substitute any two initial concentrations 
and the corresponding initial rates into a ratio of the rate laws to determine the order (n):
rate 2
rate 1 = k[A]n
2
k[A]n
1
For example, we can substitute the last two measurements in the data set just given 
for the second-order reaction as follows:
 
0.240 M>s
0.060 M>s = k(0.40 M)n
k(0.20 M)n

The rate constants for zero- and second-order reactions have different units than for 
first-order reactions. The rate constant for a zero-order reaction has units of M # s - 1, and 
the rate constant for a second-order reaction has units of M - 1 # s - 1.

Chapter 14  Chemical Kinetics
Reaction Order for Multiple Reactants
So far, we have considered a simple reaction with only one reactant. How do we define 
the rate law for reactions with more than one reactant? Consider the generic reaction:
aA + bB ¡ cC + dD
As long as the reverse reaction is negligibly slow, the rate law is proportional to the con-
centration of [A] raised to the m power multiplied by the concentration of [B] raised to 
the n power:
	
Rate = k[A]m[B]n 
[14.10]
where m is the reaction order with respect to A and n is the reaction order with respect to 
B. The overall order is the sum of the exponents (m + n). For example, the reaction 
between hydrogen and iodine has been experimentally determined to be first order with 
respect to hydrogen, first order with respect to iodine, and thus second order overall:
H2(g) + I2(g) ¡ 2 HI(g) Rate = k[H2]1[I2]1
Similarly, the reaction between hydrogen and nitrogen monoxide has been experi-
mentally determined to be first order with respect to hydrogen, second order with 
respect to nitrogen monoxide, and thus third order overall:
2 H2(g) + 2 NO(g) ¡ N2(g) + 2 H2O(g) Rate = k[H2]1[NO]2
The rate law for any reaction must always be determined by experiment, often by the 
method of initial rates described previously. We can’t simply look at a chemical equation 
and determine the rate law for the reaction. When the reaction has two or more reac-
tants, the concentration of each reactant is usually varied independently of the others 
to determine the dependence of the rate on the concentration of that reactant. Example 
14.2 demonstrates how to use the method of initial rates to determine the order of a 
reaction with multiple reactants.
Example 14.2	
Determining the Order and Rate Constant of a Reaction
Consider the reaction between nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide:
NO2(g) + CO(g) ¡ NO(g) + CO2(g)
The initial rate of the reaction is measured at several different concen-
trations of the reactants, and the tabulated results are shown here.
From the data, determine:
(a)	 the rate law for the reaction
(b)	 the rate constant (k) for the reaction
Solution
(a)	 Begin by examining how the rate changes for each change 
in concentration. Between the first two experiments, the 
concentration of NO2 doubles, the concentration of CO 
stays constant, and the rate quadruples, suggesting that the 
reaction is second order in NO2.
Between the second and third experiments, the concen-
tration of NO2 stays constant, the concentration of CO 
doubles, and the rate remains constant (the small change 
in the least significant figure is simply experimental error), 
suggesting that the reaction is zero order in CO.
Between the third and fourth experiments, the concentra-
tion of NO2 again doubles and the concentration of CO 
halves, yet the rate quadruples again, confirming that the 
reaction is second order in NO2 and zero order in CO.

14.3  The Rate Law: The Effect of Concentration on Reaction Rate	
633
(a)	 ALTERNATIVE APPROACH
If the relationship between the changes in concentrations 
and the changes in initial rates is not immediately obvious, 
you can determine the reaction order for any reactant by 
substituting any two initial rates and the corresponding ini-
tial concentrations into a ratio of the rate laws to determine 
the order (n).
For NO2 use the first and second concentrations and rates 
(because [NO2] changes here, but [CO] is constant).
Substitute the rates and concentrations into the expression 
for the ratio of the rate constants.
Take the log of both sides of the equation and solve for n.
For CO, use the second and third concentrations and rates 
(because [CO] changes here, but [NO2] is constant).
Substitute the rates and concentrations into the expression 
for the ratio of the rate laws.
Take the log of both sides of the equation and solve for n.
Write the overall rate expression from the order of each 
reactant.

	 14.4	 The Integrated Rate Law: The 
Dependence of Concentration on Time
The rate laws we have examined so far show the relationship between the rate of a reaction 
and the concentration of a reactant. But we often want to know the relationship between 
the concentration of a reactant and time. For example, the presence of chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) in the atmosphere threatens the ozone layer. One of the reasons that CFCs pose 
such a significant threat is that the reactions 
that consume them are so slow (Table 14.1). 
­Legislation has significantly reduced CFC emis-
sions, but even if humans were to completely 
stop adding CFCs to the atmosphere, their con-
centration would decrease only very slowly.  
Nonetheless, we would like to know how their 
concentration changes with time. How much will 
be left in 20 years? In 50 years?
The Integrated Rate Law
The integrated rate law for a chemical reac-
tion is a relationship between the concentra-
tions of the reactants and time. For simplicity, 
we return to a single reactant decomposing into 
products:

The integrated rate law for this reaction depends 
on the order of the reaction; let’s examine each 
of the common reaction orders individually.

of A:

14.4  The Integrated Rate Law: The Dependence of Concentration on Time	
635
Since Rate = -∆[A]>∆t, we can write:
	
- ∆[A]
∆t
= k[A]
[14.11]
In this form, the rate law is also known as the differential rate law.
We can use calculus (see margin) to integrate the differential rate law and obtain the 
first-order integrated rate law:
	
 ln [A]t = -kt +  ln [A]0 
[14.12]
We can also rearrange the integrated rate law by subtracting ln[A]0 from both sides 
of Equation 14.12:
 
 ln [A]t = -kt +  ln [A]0
  ln [A]t -  ln [A]0 = -kt
Since  ln A - ln B =  ln (A>B), we can rearrange this equation to get:
	
 ln [A]t
[A]0
= -kt 
[14.13]
where [A]t is the concentration of A at any time t, k is the rate constant, and [A]0 is the 
initial concentration of A.
Notice that the integrated rate law shown in Equation 14.12 has the form of an 
equation for a straight line:
  ln [A]t = -kt +  ln [A]0
 y = mx + b
For a first-order reaction, a plot of the natural log of the reactant concentration as a func-
tion of time yields a straight line with a slope of -k and a y-intercept of  ln [A]0, as shown 
in Figure 14.8▶. (Note that the slope is negative but that the rate constant is always 
positive.)

The First-Order Integrated Rate Law: Determining the Concentration  
of a Reactant at a Given Time
In Example 14.3, you determined that the decomposition of SO2Cl2 (under the given reaction conditions) is first order 
and has a rate constant of +2.90 * 10-4 s-1. If the reaction is carried out at the same temperature and the initial 
concentration of SO2Cl2 is 0.0225 M, what is the SO2Cl2 concentration after 865 s?
SORT  You are given the rate constant of a first-order 
reaction and the initial concentration of the reactant and 
asked to find the concentration at 865 seconds.
GIVEN:  k = +2.90 * 10-4 s-1
[SO2Cl2]0 = 0.0225 M
FIND:  [SO2Cl2] at t = 865 s
STRATEGIZE  Refer to the first-order integrated rate law to 
determine the SO2Cl2 concentration at t = 865 s.
EQUATION   ln [A]t = -kt +  ln [A]0
SOLVE  Substitute the rate constant, the initial concentra-
tion, and the time into the integrated rate law.
Solve the integrated rate law for the concentration of 
[SO2Cl2]t.
SOLUTION 
 ln[SO2Cl2]t = -kt + ln[SO2Cl2]0
 ln[SO2Cl2]t = -(2.90 * 10 - 4 s - 1)865 s +  ln(0.0225)
 ln[SO2Cl2]t = -0.251 - 3.79
 [SO2Cl2]t = e - 4.04
 = 0.0176 M
CHECK  The concentration is smaller than the original concentration as expected. If the concentration were larger than the 
initial concentration, this would indicate a mistake in the signs of one of the quantities on the right-hand side of the equation.

The reaction is first order in cyclopropane and has a measured rate constant of 3.36 * 10 - 5 s - 1 at 720 K. If the initial 
cyclopropane concentration is 0.0445 M, what is the cyclopropane concentration after 235.0 minutes?
The plot is linear, confirming that the reaction is indeed first order. To obtain the rate constant, fit the data to a line. The 
slope of the line is equal to -k. Since the slope of the best-fitting line (which is most easily determined on a graphing cal-
culator or with spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel) is -2.90 * 10-4 s-1, the rate constant is +2.90 * 10-4 s-1.

Second-Order Integrated Rate Law
If our simple reaction (A ¡ products) is second order, the rate is proportional to the 
square of the concentration of A:
Rate = k[A]2
Since Rate = -∆[A]>∆t, we can write the differential rate law:
	
- ∆[A]
∆t
= k[A]2
[14.14]
Again, we can use calculus to integrate the second-order differential rate law. We leave 
this derivation to an exercise (see Exercise 115 at the end of this chapter). The derivation 
results in the second-order integrated rate law:

Zero-Order Integrated Rate Law
If our simple reaction is zero order, the rate is proportional to a constant:
Rate = k[A]0 = k
Since Rate = -∆[A]>∆t, we can write:
	
- ∆[A]
∆t

[14.16]
We can integrate the zero-order differential rate law (see margin) to obtain the zero-order 
integrated rate law:
	
[A]t = -kt + [A]0 
[14.17]
The zero-order integrated rate law in Equation 14.17 is also in the form of an equation for 
a straight line. A plot of the concentration of the reactant as a function of time yields a 
straight line with a slope of -k and an intercept of [A]0, shown in Figure 14.10◀.
The Half-Life of a Reaction
The half-life (t1,2) of a reaction is the time required for the concentration of a reactant to 
fall to one-half of its initial value. For example, if a reaction has a half-life of 100 seconds, and 
if the initial concentration of the reactant is 1.0 M, the concentration will fall to 0.50 M in 
100 s. The half-life expression—which defines the dependence of half-life on the rate con-
stant and the initial concentration—is different for different reaction orders.
First-Order Reaction Half-Life
From the definition of half-life and from the integrated rate law, we can derive an 
­expression for the half-life. For a first-order reaction, the integrated rate law is:
ln [A]t
[A]0
= -kt
At a time equal to the half-life (t = t1>2), the concentration is exactly half of the initial 
concentration: ([A]t1>2 = 1
2[A]0). Therefore, when t = t1>2 we can write the following 
expression:
	
ln 
1
2 [A]0
[A]0
= ln 1
2 = -kt1>2
[14.18]

	
14.4  The Integrated Rate Law: The Dependence of Concentration on Time	
639
Notice that, for a first-order reaction, t1>2 is indepen-
dent of the initial concentration. For example, if t1>2 is 100 s, 
and if the initial concentration is 1.0 M, the concentra-
tion falls to 0.50 M in 100 s, to 0.25 M in another 100 s, to 
0.125 M in another 100 s, and so on (Figure 14.11▶). 
Even though the concentration is changing as the reac-
tion proceeds, the half-life (how long it takes for the con-
centration to halve) is constant. A constant half-life is 
unique to first-order reactions, making the concept of 
half-life particularly useful for first-order reactions.
▶ Figure 14.11  Half-Life: Concentration versus Time for 
a First-Order Reaction  For this reaction, the concentration 
decreases by one-half every 100 seconds (t1>2 = 100 s). The 
blue spheres represent reactant molecules (the products are 
omitted for clarity).

Second-Order Reaction Half-Life
For a second-order reaction, the integrated rate law is:
1
[A]t
= kt +
1
[A]0
At a time equal to the half-life (t = t1>2), the concentration is exactly one-half of the initial 
concentration ([A]t = 1
2 [A]0). We can therefore write the following expression at t = t1>2:
	
1
1
2[A]0
= kt1>2 +

[14.21]
Notice that, for a second-order reaction, the half-life depends on the initial concentra-
tion. So if the initial concentration of a reactant in a second-order reaction is 1.0 M, and the 
half-life is 100 s, the concentration falls to 0.50 M in 100 s. However, the time it takes for the 
concentration to fall to 0.25 M is now longer than 100 s because the initial concentration 
has decreased. Thus, the half-life continues to get longer as the concentration decreases.
Zero-Order Reaction Half-Life
For a zero-order reaction, the integrated rate law is:
[A]t = -kt + [A]0
Making the substitutions (t = t1>2; [A]t = 1
2 [A]0), we can write the expression at t = t1>2:
	
1
2[A]0 = -kt1>2 + [A]0
[14.22]
We then solve for t1>2 :
	
t1>2 = [A]0
2k

[14.23]
Notice that, for a zero-order reaction, the half-life also depends on the initial con-
centration; however, unlike in the second-order case, the two are directly proportional—
the half-life gets shorter as the concentration decreases.

	 14.5	 The Effect of Temperature on  
Reaction Rate
In the opening section of this chapter, we discussed how lizards become lethargic when 
their body temperature drops and the chemical reactions that control their muscle 
movement slow. The rates of chemical reactions are, in general, highly sensitive to 
temperature. For example, at around room temperature, a 10 °C increase in tempera-
ture increases the rate of a typical biological reaction by two or three times. How do we 
explain this highly sensitive temperature dependence?
The Arrhenius Equation
Recall that the rate law for a reaction is Rate = k[A]n. The temperature dependence of the 
reaction rate is contained in the rate constant, k (which is actually a constant only when 
the temperature remains constant). An increase in temperature generally results in an 
increase in k, which results in a faster rate. In 1889, Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius 
(1859–1927) wrote a paper quantifying the temperature dependence of the rate constant.
The modern form of the Arrhenius equation shows the relationship between the 
rate constant (k) and the temperature in kelvin (T):

[14.24]
In this equation, R is the gas constant (8.314 J>mol # K), A is a constant called the frequency 
factor (or the pre-exponential factor), and Ea is the activation energy (or activation barrier).

▲ Figure 14.12  The Activation Energy Barrier  Even though the reaction is energetically 
favorable (the energy of the products is lower than that of the reactants), an input of energy is 
needed for the reaction to take place.
The activation energy (Ea) is an energy barrier or hump that must be surmounted 
in order for the reactants to transform into products (Figure 14.12▲). We examine the 
frequency factor more closely in the next section; for now, we can think of the 
­frequency factor (A) as the number of times that the reactants approach the activa-
tion barrier per unit time.

Let’s examine the physical meaning of the activation energy, 
frequency factor, and exponential factor for this reaction.
The Activation Energy
Figure 14.13▶ shows the energy of a molecule as the reaction 
proceeds. The x-axis represents the progress of the reaction 
from left (reactant) to right (product). To get from the reactant 
to the product, the molecule must go through a high-energy 
state called the activated complex or transition state. Even 
though the overall reaction is energetically downhill (exother-
mic), it must first go uphill to reach the activated complex because 
energy is required to initially weaken the H3C¬ N bond and allow 
the NC group to begin to rotate:
▲ Figure 14.13  The Activated Complex  The reaction 
pathway includes a transitional state—the activated complex—
that has a higher energy than either the reactant or the product.

Each wag is an approach to the 
activation barrier.
However, approaching the activation barrier is not equivalent to surmounting it. Most of 
the approaches do not have enough total energy to make it over the activation barrier.
Bond weakens
NC group begins to rotate
The energy required to reach the activated complex is the activation energy. The higher the 
activation energy, the slower the reaction rate (at a given temperature).
The Frequency Factor
Recall that the frequency factor represents the number of approaches to the activation 
barrier per unit time. Any time that the NC group begins to rotate, it approaches the 
activation barrier. For this reaction, the frequency factor represents the rate at which 
the NC part of the molecule wags (vibrates side to side). With each wag, the reactant 
approaches the activation barrier:

644	
Chapter 14  Chemical Kinetics
The Exponential Factor
The exponential factor is a number between 0 and 1 that represents the fraction 
of molecules that have enough energy to make it over the activation barrier on a given 
approach. The exponential factor is the fraction of approaches that are actually successful 
and result in the product. For example, if the frequency factor is 109>s and the exponential 
factor is 10 - 7 at a certain temperature, then the overall rate constant at that temperature 
is 109>s * 10 - 7 = 102>s. In this case, the CN group wags at a rate of 109>s. 
With each wag, the activation barrier is approached. However, for a given wag 
only 1 in 107 molecules has sufficient energy to actually make it over the acti-
vation barrier.
The exponential factor depends on both the temperature (T) and the 
activation energy (Ea) of the reaction:
Exponential factor = e - Ea>RT
A low activation energy and a high temperature make the negative expo-
nent small, so the exponential factor approaches one. For example, if the 
activation energy is zero, then the exponent is zero, and the exponential 
factor is exactly one (e - 0 = 1)—every approach to the activation barrier is 
successful. By contrast, a large activation energy and a low temperature 
make the exponent a very large negative number, so the exponential factor 
becomes very small. For example, as the temperature approaches 0 K, the 
exponent approaches an infinitely large negative number, and the expo-
nential factor approaches zero (e - ∞= 0).
As the temperature increases, the number of molecules having enough 
thermal energy to surmount the activation barrier increases. At any given 
temperature, a sample of molecules has a distribution of ­energies, as shown 
in Figure 14.14◀. Under common circumstances, only a small fraction of 
the molecules has enough energy to make it over the activation barrier. 
Because of the shape of the energy distribution curve, however, a small 
change in temperature results in a large difference in the number of mole-
cules having enough energy to surmount the activation barrier. This 
explains the sensitivity of reaction rates to temperature.

Arrhenius Plots: Experimental Measurements of the 
Frequency Factor and the Activation Energy
The frequency factor and activation energy are important quantities in understand-
ing the kinetics of any reaction. To see how we measure these factors in the laboratory, 
consider again Equation 14.24: k = Ae - Ea>RT. Taking the natural log of both sides of this 
equation, we get the following result:
 ln k = ln(Ae - Ea>RT )
 ln k = ln A + ln e - Ea>RT

At any given temperature, the atoms or molecules in 
a gas sample have a range of energies. The higher 
the temperature, the wider the energy distribution 
and the greater the average energy. The fraction 
of molecules with enough energy to surmount the 
activation energy barrier and react (shaded regions) 
increases sharply as the temperature rises.
Remember that ln ex = x.
In an Arrhenius analysis, the ­ 
pre-exponential factor (A) is assumed 
to be independent of temperature. 
Although the pre-exponential factor 
does depend on temperature to 
some degree, its temperature 
dependence is much less than that 
of the exponential factor and is often 
ignored.
Remember that ln (AB) = ln A + ln B.

	
14.5  The Effect of Temperature on Reaction Rate 	
645
Equation 14.26 is in the form of a straight line. A plot of the natural log of the rate constant 
(ln k) versus the inverse of the temperature in kelvins (1>T) yields a straight line with a slope of 
-Ea>R and a y-intercept of ln A. Such a plot is called an Arrhenius plot and is commonly 
used in the analysis of kinetic data, as shown in Example 14.7.
Calculate the frequency factor (A) by setting the intercept equal to ln A.
 26.8 = ln A
 A = e26.8
 = 4.36 * 1011
Since the rate constants are measured in units of M-1 #  s-1, the frequency factor is in the same units. Consequently, you 
can conclude that the reaction has an activation energy of 93.1 kJ>mol and a frequency factor of 4.36 * 1011 M-1 #  s-1.
For Practice 14.7  For the decomposition of ozone reaction in Example 14.7, use the results of the Arrhenius analysis 
to predict the rate constant at 298 K.

In some cases, when either data are limited or plotting capabilities are absent, we 
can calculate the activation energy if we know the rate constant at just two different 
temperatures. We can apply the Arrhenius expression in Equation 14.26 to the two dif-
ferent temperatures as follows:

The Collision Model: A Closer Look at the  
Frequency Factor
Recall that the frequency factor in the Arrhenius equation represents the 
number of approaches to the activation barrier per unit time. Let’s refine 
that idea for a reaction involving two gas-phase reactants:
A(g) + B(g) ¡ products
In the collision model, a chemical reaction occurs after a suffi-
ciently energetic collision between two reactant molecules (Figure 14.15▶). 
In collision theory, therefore, each approach to the activation barrier is a 
collision between the reactant molecules. Consequently, the value of the 
frequency factor should simply be the number of collisions that occur per 
second. However, the frequency factors of most (though not all) gas-phase 
chemical reactions tend to be smaller than the number of collisions that 
occur per second. Why?
In the collision model, we can separate the frequency factor into two 
distinct parts, as shown in the following equations:
Energetic collision

No reaction

where p is the orientation factor and z is the collision frequency. The collision 
frequency is the number of collisions that occur per unit time, which we calculate for a 
gas-phase reaction from the pressure of the gases and the temperature of the reaction 
mixture. Under typical conditions, a single molecule undergoes on the order of 109 colli-
sions every second. The orientation factor is a number, usually between 0 and 1, which 
represents the fraction of collisions with an orientation that allows the reaction to occur.
To better understand the orientation factor, consider the reaction represented by 
the following equation:
NOCl(g)
NOCl(g)
2 NO(g)
Cl2(g)
+
+
+
+
In order for the reaction to occur, two NOCl molecules must collide with sufficient 
energy. However, not all collisions with sufficient energy lead to products because the 
reactant molecules must also be properly oriented.
Consider the three possible collision orientations of the reactant molecules shown 
here:
Ineffective collision
Ineffective collision
Effective collision

648	
Chapter 14  Chemical Kinetics
The first two collisions, even if they occur with sufficient energy, do not result in a reac-
tion because the reactant molecules are not oriented in a way that allows the chlorine 
atoms to bond. In other words, if two molecules are to react with each other, they must 
collide in such a way that allows the necessary bonds to break and form. For the reaction 
of NOCl(g), the orientation factor is p = 0.16. This means that only 16 out of 100 suffi-
ciently energetic collisions are actually successful in forming the products.
Some reactions have orientation factors that are much smaller than one. Consider 
the reaction between hydrogen and ethene:
H2(g) + CH2“ CH2(g) ¡ CH3¬ CH3(g)
The orientation factor for this reaction is 1.7 * 10 - 6, which means that fewer than two 
out of each million sufficiently energetic collisions actually form products. The small ori-
entation factor indicates that the orientational requirements for this reaction are very 
stringent—the molecules must be aligned in a very specific way for the reaction to occur.
Reactions between individual atoms usually have orientation factors of approxi-
mately one because atoms are spherically symmetric and thus any orientation can lead 
to the formation of products. A few reactions have orientation factors greater than one. 
Consider the reaction between potassium and bromine:
K(g) + Br2(g) ¡ KBr(g) + Br(g)
This reaction has an orientation factor of p = 4.8. In other words, there are more reactions 
than collisions—the reactants do not even have to collide to react! Apparently, through a 
process dubbed the harpoon mechanism, a potassium atom can actually transfer an electron 
to a bromine molecule without a collision. The resulting positive charge on the potassium 
and the negative charge on the bromine cause the two species to attract each other and 
form a bond. The potassium atom essentially harpoons a passing bromine molecule with an 
electron and reels it in through the coulombic attraction between unlike charges.
We can picture a sample of reactive gases as a frenzy of collisions between the react-
ing atoms or molecules. At normal temperatures, the vast majority of these collisions do 
not have sufficient energy to overcome the activation barrier, and the atoms or mole-
cules simply bounce off one another. Of the collisions having sufficient energy to over-
come the activation barrier, most do not have the proper orientation for the reaction to 
occur (for the majority of common reactions). When two molecules with sufficient 
energy and the correct orientation collide, something extraordinary happens. The elec-
trons on one of the atoms or molecules are attracted to the nuclei of the other; some 
bonds begin to weaken while other bonds begin to form and, if all goes well, the reac-
tants go through the transition state and are transformed into the products. This is how 
a chemical reaction occurs.

	 14.6	 Reaction Mechanisms
Most chemical reactions do not occur in a single step but rather over the course of sev-
eral steps. When we write a chemical equation to represent a chemical reaction, we usu-
ally represent the overall reaction, not the series of individual steps by which the reaction occurs. 
Consider the reaction in which hydrogen gas reacts with iodine monochloride:
H2(g) + 2 ICl(g) ¡ 2 HCl(g) + I2(g)

	
14.6  Reaction Mechanisms	
649
The overall equation shows only the substances present at the beginning of the reaction 
and the substances formed by the reaction—it does not show the intermediate steps. 
The reaction mechanism is the series of individual chemical steps by which an over-
all chemical reaction occurs. For example, the proposed mechanism for the reaction 
between hydrogen and iodine monochloride contains two steps:
Step 1    H2(g) + ICl(g) ¡ HI(g) + HCl(g)
Step 2    HI(g) + ICl(g) ¡ HCl(g) + I2(g)
In the first step, an H2 molecule collides with an ICl molecule and forms an HI mol-
ecule and an HCl molecule. In the second step, the HI molecule formed in the first step 
collides with a second ICl molecule to form another HCl molecule and an I2 molecule. 
Each step in a reaction mechanism is an elementary step. Elementary steps cannot be 
broken down into simpler steps—they occur as written (they represent the exact species 
that are colliding in the reaction).
One of the requirements for a valid reaction mechanism is that the individual steps 
in the mechanism add to the overall reaction. For example, the mechanism just shown 
sums to the overall reaction as shown here:
 H2(g) + ICl(g) ¡ HI(g) + HCl(g)
 HI(g) + ICl(g) ¡ HCl(g) + I2(g)
 H2(g) + 2 ICl(g) ¡ 2 HCl(g) + I2(g)
Notice that the HI molecule appears in the reaction mechanism but not in the over-
all reaction equation. We call species such as HI reaction intermediates. A reaction 
intermediate forms in one elementary step and is consumed in another. The reaction 
mechanism is a complete, detailed description of the reaction at the molecular level—it 
specifies the individual collisions and reactions that result in the overall reaction. As 
such, reaction mechanisms are highly sought-after pieces of chemical knowledge.
How do we determine reaction mechanisms? Recall from the opening section of this 
chapter that chemical kinetics are not only practically important (because they allow us 
to control the rate of a particular reaction), but they are also theoretically important 
because they can help us determine the mechanism of the reaction. We can piece 
together possible reaction mechanisms by measuring the kinetics of the overall reaction 
and working backward to write a mechanism consistent with the measured kinetics.
Rate Laws for Elementary Steps
We characterize elementary steps by their molecularity, the number of reactant par-
ticles involved in the step. The most common molecularities are unimolecular and 
bimolecular:
A ¡ products   
 Unimolecular
A + A ¡ products      Bimolecular
A + B ¡ products  
 Bimolecular
Elementary steps in which three reactant particles collide, called termolecular steps, 
are very rare because the probability of three particles simultaneously colliding is small.
Although we cannot deduce the rate law for an overall chemical reaction from the bal-
anced chemical equation, we can deduce the rate law for an elementary step from its 
equation. Since we know that an elementary step occurs through the collision of the 
reactant particles, the rate is proportional to the product of the concentrations of those 
particles. For example, the rate for the bimolecular elementary step in which A reacts 
with B is proportional to the concentration of A multiplied by the concentration of B:
A + B ¡ products    Rate = k[A][B]
Similarly, the rate law for the bimolecular step in which A reacts with A is proportional 
to the square of the concentration of A:
A + A ¡ products    Rate = k[A]2
An elementary step represents 
an actual interaction between the 
reactant molecules in the step. An 
overall reaction equation shows only 
the starting substances and the 
ending substances, not the path 
between them.

Chapter 14  Chemical Kinetics
Table 14.3 summarizes the rate laws for the common elementary steps, as well as those 
for the rare termolecular step. Notice that the molecularity of the elementary step is 
equal to the overall order of the step.

Rate-Determining Steps and Overall Reaction Rate Laws
In most chemical reactions, one of the elementary steps—called the rate-determining 
step—is much slower than the others. The rate-determining step in a chemical reaction 
is analogous to the narrowest section on a freeway. If a section of a freeway narrows from 
four lanes to two lanes, for even a short distance, the rate at which cars travel along the 
freeway is limited by the rate at which they can travel through the narrow section (even 
though the rate might be much faster along the four-lane section). Similarly, the rate-
determining step in a reaction mechanism limits the overall rate of the reaction (even 
though the other steps occur much faster) and therefore determines the rate law for the 
overall reaction.
Rate-limiting section
▶ The rate-limiting step in a reaction 
mechanism limits the overall rate of 
the reaction just as the narrowest 
section of a highway limits the rate 
at which traffic can pass.
As an example, consider the reaction between nitrogen dioxide gas and carbon 
monoxide gas:
NO2(g) + CO(g) ¡ NO(g) + CO2(g)
The experimentally determined rate law for this reaction is Rate = k[NO2]2. We can see 
from this rate law that the reaction must not be a single-step reaction—otherwise the 
rate law would be Rate = k[NO2][CO]. A possible mechanism for this reaction involves 
two steps:
 NO2(g) + NO2(g) ¡ NO3(g) + NO(g)   Slow
 NO3(g) + CO(g) ¡ NO2(g) + CO2(g)   Fast
Figure 14.16▶ shows the energy diagram for this mechanism. The first step has a 
much larger activation energy than the second step. This greater activation energy 
results in a much smaller rate constant for the first step compared to the second step. The 
first step determines the overall rate of the reaction, and the predicted overall rate law is 
therefore Rate = k[NO2]2, which is consistent with the observed experimental rate law.

◀ Figure 14.16  Energy Diagram 
for a Two-Step Mechanism 
For a proposed reaction mechanism, such as the one shown here for NO2 and CO, to 
be valid (mechanisms can only be validated, not proven), two conditions must be met:
1.	 The elementary steps in the mechanism must sum to the overall reaction.
2.	 The rate law predicted by the mechanism must be consistent with the 
experimentally observed rate law.
We have already seen that the rate law predicted by the earlier mechanism is consis-
tent with the experimentally observed rate law. We can check whether the elementary 
steps sum to the overall reaction by adding them together:
NO2(g) + NO2(g) ¡ NO3(g) + NO(g)  
 Slow
NO3(g) + CO(g)  ¡ NO2(g) + CO2(g)   Fast
NO2(g) + CO(g)  ¡ NO(g) + CO2(g)    Overall
The mechanism fulfills both of the given requirements and is therefore valid. A valid 
mechanism is not a proven mechanism (because other mechanisms may also fulfill both 
of the given requirements). We can only say that a given mechanism is consistent with 
kinetic observations of the reaction and is therefore possible. Other types of data—such 
as the experimental evidence for a proposed intermediate—are necessary to further 
strengthen the validity of a proposed mechanism.
Mechanisms with a Fast Initial Step
When the proposed mechanism for a reaction has a slow initial step—such as the one 
shown previously for the reaction between NO2 and CO—the rate law predicted by the 
mechanism normally contains only reactants involved in the overall reaction. However, 
when a mechanism begins with a fast initial step, some other subsequent step in the mech-
anism is the rate-limiting step. In these cases, the rate law predicted by the rate-limiting step 
may contain reaction intermediates. Because reaction intermediates do not appear in the 
overall reaction equation, a rate law containing intermediates cannot generally correspond 
to the experimental rate law. Fortunately, however, we can often express the concentration 
of intermediates in terms of the concentrations of the reactants of the overall reaction.
In a multistep mechanism where the first step is fast, the products of the first step may 
build up because the rate at which they are consumed is limited by some slower step fur-
ther down the line. As those products build up, they can begin to react with one another to 

652	
Chapter 14  Chemical Kinetics
re-form the reactants. As long as the first step is fast enough compared to the rate-limiting 
step, the first-step reaction will reach equilibrium. We indicate equilibrium as follows:
Reactants ∆

products
The double arrows indicate that both the forward reaction and the reverse reaction 
occur. If equilibrium is reached, then the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of 
the reverse reaction.
As an example, consider the reaction by which hydrogen reacts with nitrogen mon-
oxide to form water and nitrogen gas:
2 H2(g) + 2 NO(g) ¡ 2 H2O(g) + N2(g)
The experimentally observed rate law is Rate = k[H2][NO]2. The reaction is first order in 
hydrogen and second order in nitrogen monoxide. The proposed mechanism has a slow 
second step:

2 H2(g) + 2 NO(g) ¡ 2 H2O(g) + N2(g)  
 Overall 
To determine whether the mechanism is valid, we must find whether the two conditions 
described previously are met. As we can see, the steps do indeed sum to the overall reac-
tion, so the first condition is met.
The second condition is that the rate law predicted by the mechanism must be con-
sistent with the experimentally observed rate law. Because the second step is rate limit-
ing, we write the following expression for the rate law:
	
Rate = k2[H2][N2O2]
[14.28]
This rate law contains an intermediate (N2O2) and therefore cannot be consistent with 
the experimentally observed rate law (which does not contain intermediates). Because of 
the equilibrium in the first step, however, we can express the concentration of the intermedi-
ate in terms of the reactants of the overall equation. Since the first step reaches equilibrium, 
the rate of the forward reaction in the first step equals the rate of the reverse reaction:
Rate (forward) = Rate (reverse)
The rate of the forward reaction is given by the rate law:
Rate = k1[NO]2
The rate of the reverse reaction is given by the rate law:
Rate = k - 1[N2O2]
Since these two rates are equal at equilibrium, we write the expression:
k1[NO]2 = k - 1[N2O2]
Rearranging, we get:
[N2O2] =
k1
k - 1
[NO]2
We can now substitute this expression into Equation 14.28, the rate law obtained from 
the slow step:
 Rate = k2[H2][N2O2]
 = k2[H2] k1
k - 1
[NO]2
 = k2k1
k - 1
[H2][NO]2
If we combine the individual rate constants into one overall rate constant, we get the 
predicted rate law:
	
Rate = k[H2][NO]2
[14.29]
Since this rate law is consistent with the experimentally observed rate law, condition 2 is 
met and the proposed mechanism is valid.

The second condition is that the rate law predicted by the mechanism is 
­consistent with the experimentally observed rate law. Because the second step 
is rate limiting, write the rate law based on the second step.
Rate = k2[O3][O]
Because the rate law contains an intermediate (O), you must express the con-
centration of the intermediate in terms of the concentrations of the reactants 
of the overall reaction. To do this, set the rates of the forward reaction and the 
reverse reaction of the first step equal to each other. Solve the expression from 
the previous step for [O], the concentration of the intermediate.
 Rate (forward) = Rate (backward)
 k1[O3] = k - 1[O2][O]
 [O] =
k1[O3]
k - 1[O2]
Finally, substitute [O] into the rate law predicted by the slow step.

CHECK Because the two steps in the proposed mechanism sum to the overall reaction, and because the rate law obtained 
from the proposed mechanism is consistent with the experimentally observed rate law, the proposed mechanism is valid. 
The -1 reaction order with respect to [O2] indicates that the rate slows down as the concentration of oxygen increases—

	 14.7	 Catalysis
Throughout this chapter, we have learned about ways to control the rates of chemical 
reactions. We can speed up the rate of a reaction by increasing the concentration of the 
reactants or by increasing the temperature. However, these approaches are not always 
feasible. There are limits to how concentrated we can make a reaction mixture, and 
increases in temperature may allow unwanted reactions—such as the decomposition of 
a reactant—to occur.
Alternatively, we can increase reaction rates by using a catalyst, a substance that 
increases the rate of a chemical reaction but is not consumed by the reaction. A catalyst 
works by providing an alternative mechanism for the reaction—one in which the rate-
determining step has a lower activation energy.
For example, consider the noncatalytic destruction of ozone in the upper atmo-
sphere, discussed in Section 6.10, which happens according to this reaction:
O3(g) + O(g) ¡ 2 O2(g)

654	
Chapter 14  Chemical Kinetics
In this reaction, an ozone molecule collides with an oxygen atom to form two oxygen 
molecules in a single elementary step.
Earth has a protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere because the activation 
energy for this reaction is fairly high; the reaction, therefore, proceeds at a fairly slow 
rate, and the ozone layer does not rapidly decompose into O2. However, the addition of 
Cl atoms (which come from the photodissociation of human-made chlorofluorocar-
bons) to the upper atmosphere makes available another pathway by which O3 can be 
destroyed. The first step in this pathway—called the catalytic destruction of ozone—is 
the reaction of Cl with O3 to form ClO and O2:
Cl + O3 ¡ ClO + O2
This is followed by a second step in which ClO reacts with O, 
regenerating Cl:
ClO + O ¡ Cl + O2
If we add the two reactions, the overall reaction is identical to 
the noncatalytic reaction:
 Cl + O3 ¡ ClO + O2
 ClO + O ¡ Cl + O2
 O3 + O ¡ 2 O2 
However, the activation energy for the rate-limiting step 
in this pathway is much smaller than for the first, uncatalyzed 
pathway (as shown in Figure 14.17◀), and therefore the reac-
tion occurs at a much faster rate. Note that the Cl is not con-
sumed in the overall reaction—this is characteristic of a 
catalyst.
In the case of the catalytic destruction of ozone, the cata-
lyst speeds up a reaction that we do not want to happen. Most of 
the time, however, catalysts are used to speed up reactions that 
we do want to happen. For example, your car most likely has a 
catalytic converter in its exhaust system. The catalytic con-
verter contains solid catalysts, such as platinum, rhodium, or 
palladium, dispersed on an underlying high-surface-area 
ceramic structure. These catalysts convert exhaust pollutants 
such as nitrogen monoxide and carbon monoxide into less 
harmful substances:
2 NO(g) + 2 CO(g) ¡
catalyst N2(g) + 2 CO2(g)
The catalytic converter also promotes the complete combustion of any fuel frag-
ments present in the exhaust:

Fuel fragments in exhaust are harmful because they lead to the formation of ozone. 
Recall from Section 6.10 that although ozone is a natural part of our upper atmosphere 
that protects us from excess exposure to ultraviolet light, it is a pollutant in the lower 
atmosphere, interfering with cardiovascular function and acting as an eye and lung irri-
tant. The use of catalytic converters in motor vehicles has resulted in lower levels of 
these pollutants over most U.S. cities in the last 30 years, even though the number of 
cars on the roadways has dramatically increased (see Table 14.4).
Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis
We categorize catalysts into two types: homogeneous and heterogeneous (Figure 14.18▼). 
In homogeneous catalysis, the catalyst exists in the same phase (or state) as the reac-
tants. The catalytic destruction of ozone by Cl is an example of homogeneous catalysis—
the chlorine atoms exist in the gas phase with the gas-phase reactants. In heterogeneous 
catalysis, the catalyst exists in a different phase than the reactants. The solid catalysts 
used in catalytic converters are examples of heterogeneous catalysts—they are solids while 
the reactants are gases. The use of solid catalysts with gas-phase or solution-phase reac-
tants is the most common type of heterogeneous catalysis.

ice particles that catalyze reactions 
by which chlorine is released from its 
atmospheric chemical reservoirs.

Research has shown that heterogeneous catalysis is most likely responsible for the 
annual formation of an ozone hole over Antarctica. After the discovery of the Antarctic 
ozone hole in 1985, scientists wondered why there was such a dramatic drop in ­ozone 
over Antarctica but not over the rest of the planet. After all, the chlorine from chloroflu-
orocarbons that catalyzes ozone destruction is evenly distributed throughout the entire 
atmosphere.
As it turns out, most of the chlorine that enters the atmosphere from chlorofluoro-
carbons gets bound up in chlorine reservoirs, which are substances such as ClONO2 that 
hold chlorine and prevent it from catalyzing ozone destruction. The unique conditions 
over Antarctica—especially the cold isolated air mass that exists during the long dark 
winter—result in clouds that contain solid ice particles. These unique clouds are called 
polar stratospheric clouds (or PSCs), and the surfaces of the ice particles within these 
clouds appear to catalyze the release of chlorine from their reservoirs:
ClONO2 + HCl ¡
PSCs  Cl2 + HNO3
When the sun rises in the Antarctic spring, the sunlight dissociates the chlorine 
molecules into chlorine atoms:
Cl2 ¡
light 2 Cl
The chlorine atoms then catalyze the destruction of ozone by the mechanism discussed 
previously. This continues until the sun melts the stratospheric clouds, allowing ­chlorine

atoms to be reincorporated into their reservoirs. The 
result is an ozone hole that forms every spring and lasts 
about six to eight weeks (Figure 14.19◀).
A second example of heterogeneous catalysis involves 
the hydrogenation of double bonds within alkenes. 
Consider the reaction between ethene and hydrogen, 
which is relatively slow at normal temperatures:
H2C “ CH2(g) + H2(g) ¡ H3C¬ CH3(g)
Slow at room temperature
However, in the presence of finely divided platinum, 
palladium, or nickel, the reaction happens rapidly.  
The catalysis occurs by the four-step process depicted in

The strategies used to speed 
up chemical reactions in the 
laboratory—high temperatures, high 
pressures, strongly acidic or alkaline 
conditions—are not available to living 
organisms, since they would be fatal 
to cells.
1.	 Adsorption: the reactants are adsorbed onto the 
metal surface.
2.	 Diffusion: the reactants diffuse on the surface until 
they approach each other.
3.	 Reaction: the reactants react to form the products.
4.	 Desorption: the products desorb from the surface 
into the gas phase.
The large activation energy of the hydrogenation reaction—due primarily to the 
strength of the hydrogen–hydrogen bond in H2—is greatly lowered when the reactants 
adsorb onto the surface.
Enzymes: Biological Catalysts
We find perhaps the best example of chemical catalysis in living organisms. Most of the 
thousands of reactions that must occur for an organism to survive are too slow at normal 
temperatures. So living organisms rely on enzymes, biological catalysts that increase the 
rates of biochemical reactions. Enzymes are usually large protein molecules with complex 
three-dimensional structures. Within each enzyme’s structure is a specific area called the 
active site. The properties and shape of the active site are just right to bind the reactant 
molecule, usually called the substrate. The substrate fits into the active site in a manner

657
that is analogous to a key fitting into a lock (Figure 14.21▼). When the substrate binds to 
the active site of the enzyme—through intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding and 
dispersion forces, or even covalent bonds—the activation energy of the reaction is greatly 
lowered, allowing the reaction to occur at a much faster rate. The general mechanism by 
which an enzyme (E) binds a substrate (S) and then reacts to form the products (P) is:

break into glucose and fructose because the activation energy is high, resulting in a slow 
reaction rate. However, when a sucrose molecule binds to the active site within sucrase, the 
bond between the glucose and fructose units weakens because glucose is forced into a 
geometry that stresses the bond (Figure 14.22▶). Weakening of this 
bond lowers the activation energy for the reaction, increasing the 
reaction rate. The reaction can then proceed toward equilibrium—
which favors the products—at a much lower temperature.
By allowing otherwise slow reactions to occur at reasonable 
rates, enzymes give living organisms tremendous control over 
which reactions occur and when they occur. Enzymes are extremely 
specific (each enzyme catalyzes only a single reaction) and effi-
cient, speeding up reaction rates by factors of as much as a billion.
To turn a particular reaction on, a living organism produces or 
activates the correct enzyme to catalyze that reaction. Because 
organisms are so dependent on the reactions enzymes catalyze, 
Sucrase, for example, is an enzyme that catalyzes the breaking up of sucrose (table 
sugar) into glucose and fructose within the body. At body temperature, sucrose does not

many substances that inhibit the action of enzymes are highly toxic. Locking up a single 
enzyme molecule can stop the reaction of billions of substrates, much as one motorist stalled 
at a tollbooth can paralyze an entire highway full of cars. (For another example of enzyme

hen we eat foods containing proteins—such as meats,

ed. Proteins are large biological molecules composed of in-
dividual units called amino acids. (We discuss the structure 
of proteins and other biologically important molecules more 
fully in Chapter 22.) The amino acids in proteins are linked 
together via peptide bonds, as shown in Figure 14.23▼.

Chymotrypsin, a Digestive 
Enzyme  This model of 
chymotrypsin shows a section of 
a protein substrate (red) in the 
active site.
During digestion, the protein must be broken up into individ-
ual amino acids (Figure 14.24▼), which can pass through 
the walls of the small intestine and into the bloodstream. 
However, the peptide bonds that link amino acids together 
are relatively stable, and under ordinary conditions the reac-
tion is slow.
The amino acid chain is thus clipped at the peptide bond. 
The products of the reaction leave the active site, another 
protein binds to the chymotrypsin, and the process is repeat-
ed. Other digestive enzymes cleave protein chains between 
other pairs of amino acids. Together, these enzymes eventual-
ly reduce the entire protein to its constituent amino acids.
The pancreas secretes an enzyme called chymotrypsin 
(Figure 14.25▶) into the small intestine. Like many enzymes, 
chymotrypsin is highly selective in its action—it operates only 
on peptide bonds between certain kinds of amino acids. 
When a protein molecule containing such a pair of amino 
acids is attached to the active site of chymotrypsin, the 
­peptide bond between them is weakened as the chymotrypsin 
forms a covalent bond with the carbon in the peptide bond.  
A water molecule can then come in and cleave the bond, with 
an ¬ oH from the water binding to the carbon atom and the 
remaining ¬ H bonding to the nitrogen (Figure 14.26▼).

Key Concepts
Reaction Rates, Orders, and Rate Laws (14.1–14.3)
▶
▶The rate of a chemical reaction is a measure of how fast a reaction 
occurs. The rate reflects the change in the concentration of a re-
actant or product per unit time and is usually reported in units 
of M>s.
▶
▶Reaction rates generally depend on the concentration of the re-
actants. The rate of a first-order reaction is directly proportional 
to the concentration of the reactant, the rate of a second-order 
reaction is proportional to the square of the concentration of the 
reactant, and the rate of a zero-order reaction is independent of 
the concentration of the reactant.
▶
▶For a reaction with more than one reactant, the order with respect 
to each reactant is, in general, independent of the order with re-
spect to other reactants. The rate law shows the relationship be-
tween the rate and the concentrations of each reactant and must 
be determined experimentally.
Integrated Rate Laws and Half-Life (14.4)
▶
▶The rate law for a reaction describes the relationship between the 
rate of the reaction and the concentrations of the reactants.
▶
▶The integrated rate law for a reaction describes the relationship 
between the concentration of a reactant and time.
▶
▶The integrated rate law for a zero-order reaction shows that the 
concentration of the reactant varies linearly with time. For a first-
order reaction, the natural log of the concentration of the reactant 
varies linearly with time, and for a second-order reaction, the in-
verse of the concentration of the reactant varies linearly with time.
▶
▶The half-life of a reaction can be derived from the integrated rate 
law and represents the time required for the concentration of a 
reactant to fall to one-half of its initial value. The half-life of a first-
order reaction is independent of initial concentration of the reac-
tant. The half-life of a zero-order or second-order reaction depends 
on the initial concentration of reactant.
The Effect of Temperature on Reaction Rate (14.5)
▶
▶The rate constant of a reaction generally depends on temperature 
and can be expressed by the Arrhenius equation, which consists of 
a frequency factor and an exponential factor.
▶
▶The frequency factor represents the number of times that the re-
actants approach the activation barrier per unit time. The expo-
nential factor is the fraction of approaches that are successful in 
surmounting the activation barrier and forming products.
▶
▶The exponential factor depends on both the temperature and the 
activation energy, a barrier that the reactants must overcome to 
become products. The exponential factor increases with increas-
ing temperature but decreases with increasing activation energy.
▶
▶We can determine the frequency factor and activation energy for a 
reaction by measuring the rate constant at different temperatures 
and constructing an Arrhenius plot.
▶
▶For reactions in the gas phase, Arrhenius behavior can be mod-
eled with the collision model. In this model, reactions occur as a 
result of sufficiently energetic collisions. The colliding molecules 
must be oriented in such a way that the reaction can occur. The 
frequency factor contains two terms: p, which represents the frac-
tion of collisions that have the proper orientation, and z, which 
represents the number of collisions per unit time.
Reaction Mechanisms (14.6)
▶
▶Most chemical reactions occur not in a single step, but in several 
steps. The series of individual steps by which a reaction occurs is 
the reaction mechanism.
▶
▶In order for a proposed reaction mechanism to be valid, it must 
fulfill two conditions: (a) the steps must sum to the overall reac-
tion, and (b) the mechanism must predict the experimentally ob-
served rate law.
▶
▶For mechanisms with a slow initial step, we derive the rate law 
from the slow step.
▶
▶For mechanisms with a fast initial step, we first write the rate law 
based on the slow step but then assume that the fast steps reach 
equilibrium, so we can write concentrations of intermediates in 
terms of the reactants.
Catalysis (14.7)
▶
▶A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reac-
tion by providing an alternative mechanism that has a lower acti-
vation energy for the rate-determining step.

▶
▶Catalysts can be homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous 
catalyst exists in the same phase as the reactants and forms a ho-
mogeneous mixture with them. A heterogeneous catalyst gener-
ally exists in a different phase than the reactants.
▶
▶Enzymes are biological catalysts capable of increasing the rate of 
specific biochemical reactions by many orders of magnitude.

Challenge Problems
	113. 	In this chapter we have seen a number of reactions in which a 
single reactant forms products. For example, consider the fol-
lowing first-order reaction:
CH3NC(g) ¡ CH3CN(g)
However, we also learned that gas-phase reactions occur through 
collisions.
a.	 One possible explanation for how this reaction occurs is that 
two molecules of CH3NC collide with each other and form 
two molecules of the product in a single elementary step. If 
that were the case, what reaction order would you expect?
b.	Another possibility is that the reaction occurs through more 
than one step. For example, a possible mechanism involves 
one step in which the two CH3NC molecules collide, result-
ing in the “activation” of one of them. In a second step, the 
activated molecule goes on to form the product. Write down 
this mechanism and determine which step must be rate

Discuss these questions with the group and record your consensus 
answer.
	123. 	A student says, “The initial concentration of a reactant was dou-
bled, and the rate doubled. Therefore the reaction is second 
order in that reactant.” Why might the student say that? What 
is wrong with the statement? What is the actual order with re-
spect to the reactant? Explain your reasoning clearly.

Data Interpretation and Analysis
Kinetics of Color Change in Marionberry Preserves
	125.	The color of food is an important component in consumer 
­decisions. Ultraviolet rays from the sun and other chemical 
­processes can break chemical bonds and cause food color to 
fade. The time that it takes for the color of food to fade depends 
on the kinetics of the chemical reactions occurring in the food.
A company makes marionberry preserves and places the 
food in sealed glass jars. In one experiment, food scientists place 
some jars near a window where the preserves are exposed to light 
and the temperature is kept constant at 25.0 °C. The scientists 
periodically measure the color intensity of the ­preserves during 
a 200-day period. Table a displays the change in color intensity 
of the preserves (as a percentage of the original) in the presence 
of light at 25.0 °C. Figure a▼ plots the data in Table a as a graph.

Answers to Conceptual Connections
Reaction Rates
14.1	 (c) The rate at which B changes is twice the rate of the reaction be-
cause its coefficient is 2, and it is negative because B is a reactant.
Order of Reaction
14.2	 (d) Since the reaction is second order, increasing the concentra-
tion of A by a factor of 5 causes the rate to increase by 52 or 25.
Rate and Concentration
14.3	 All three mixtures have the same total number of molecules, 
but mixture (c) has the greatest number of NO molecules. 
Since the reaction is second order in NO and only first order in 
O2, mixture (c) has the fastest initial rate.
Half-Life Part I
14.4	 The half-life is 90 s, because it takes 90 s for the reactant to fall 
to one-half of its intitial concentration.
Half-Life Part II
14.5	 The concentration of B after 50 seconds (two half-lives) is 
0.225 M. See table.

Rate Law and Integrated Rate Law
14.6	 (c) The reaction is most likely second order because its rate de-
pends on the concentration (therefore it cannot be zero order), 
and its half-life depends on the initial concentration (therefore 
it cannot be first order). For a second-order reaction, a dou-
bling of the initial concentration results in the quadrupling of 
the rate.
Temperature Dependence of Reaction Rate
14.7	 Reaction A has a faster rate because it has a lower activation en-
ergy; therefore, the exponential factor is larger at a given tem-
perature, making the rate constant larger. (With a larger rate 
constant and the same initial concentration, the rate is faster).
Collision Theory
14.8	 (c) Since the reactants in part (a) are atoms, the orientation 
factor should be about one. The reactants in parts (b) and (c) 
are both molecules, so we expect orientation factors of less 
than one. Since the reactants in (b) are symmetrical, we would 
not expect the collision to have as specific an orientation 
­requirement as in (c), where the reactants are asymmetrical 
and must therefore collide in such way that a hydrogen atom 
is in close proximity to another hydrogen atom. Therefore, we 
expect (c) to have the smallest orientation factor.

▲ A developing fetus obtains 
oxygen from the mother’s blood 
because the reaction between 
oxygen and fetal hemoglobin has a 
larger equilibrium constant than 
the reaction between oxygen and 
maternal hemoglobin.
I
n Chapter 14, we examined how fast a chemical reaction occurs. In this chapter we 
­examine how far a chemical reaction goes. The speed of a chemical reaction is deter-
mined by kinetics. The extent of a chemical reaction is determined by thermodynamics. 
In this chapter, we focus on describing and quantifying how far a chemical reaction goes 
based on an experimentally measurable quantity called the equilibrium constant. A reaction 
with a large equilibrium constant proceeds nearly to completion—almost all the reactants 
react to form products. A reaction with a small equilibrium constant barely proceeds at 
all—almost all the reactants remain as reactants, hardly forming any products. In this 
chapter we simply accept the equilibrium constant as an experimentally measurable quan-
tity and learn how to use it to predict and quantify the extent of a reaction. In Chapter 18, 
we will explore the reasons underlying the magnitude of equilibrium constants.
	 15.1	 Fetal Hemoglobin and Equilibrium
Have you ever wondered how a baby in the womb gets oxygen? Unlike you and me, a 
fetus does not breathe air. Yet, like you and me, a fetus needs oxygen. Where does that 
oxygen come from? After we are born, we inhale air into our lungs and that air diffuses 
into capillaries, where it comes into contact with our blood. Within our red blood cells, a 
protein called hemoglobin (Hb) reacts with oxygen according to the chemical equation:
Hb + O2 ∆HbO2

676	
Chapter 15  Chemical Equilibrium
The double arrows in this equation indicate that the reaction can occur in both the for-
ward and reverse directions and can reach chemical equilibrium. We encountered this 
term in Chapters 11 and 13, and we define it more carefully in the next section. For now, 
understand that the relative concentrations of the reactants and products in a reaction 
at equilibrium are described by the equilibrium constant, K. A large value of K means that 
the reaction lies far to the right at equilibrium—a high concentration of products and a 
low concentration of reactants. A small value of K means that the reaction lies far to the 
left at equilibrium—a high concentration of reactants and a low concentration of prod-
ucts. In short, the value of K is a measure of how far a reaction proceeds—the larger the 
value of K, the more the reaction proceeds toward the products.
The equilibrium constant for the reaction between hemoglobin and oxygen is such 
that hemoglobin efficiently binds oxygen at typical lung oxygen concentrations, but it 
can also release oxygen under the appropriate conditions. Any system at equilibrium, 
including the hemoglobin–oxygen system, responds to changes in ways that maintain 
equilibrium. If any of the concentrations of the reactants or products change, the reac-
tion shifts to counteract that change. For the hemoglobin system, as blood flows through 
the lungs where oxygen concentrations are high, the equilibrium shifts to the right—
hemoglobin binds oxygen:
HbO2
+
Hb
O2
Reaction shifts right.
Lungs:
high [O2]
In our bodies, as blood flows out of the lungs and into muscles and organs where 
oxygen concentrations have been depleted (because muscles and organs use oxygen), 
the equilibrium shifts to the left—hemoglobin releases oxygen:
HbO2
+
Hb
O2
Reaction shifts left.
Muscles:
low [O2]
In other words, to maintain equilibrium, hemoglobin binds oxygen when the surrounding 
oxygen concentration is high, but it releases oxygen when the surrounding oxygen concentration 
is low. In this way, hemoglobin transports oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body 
that use oxygen.
A fetus has its own circulatory system. The mother’s blood never flows into the 
fetus’s body, and the fetus cannot get any air in the womb. How, then, does the fetus get 
oxygen? The answer lies in the properties of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which is slightly 
different from adult hemoglobin. Like adult hemoglobin, fetal hemoglobin is in equilib-
rium with oxygen:
HbF + O2 ∆HbFO2
However, the equilibrium constant for fetal hemoglobin is larger than the equilib-
rium constant for adult hemoglobin, meaning that the reaction tends to go farther in 
the direction of the product. Consequently, fetal hemoglobin loads oxygen at a lower 
oxygen concentration than does adult hemoglobin. In the placenta, fetal blood flows in 
close proximity to maternal blood. Although the two never mix, because of the different 
equilibrium constants, the maternal hemoglobin releases oxygen that the fetal hemo-
globin then binds and carries into its own circulatory system (Figure 15.1▶). Nature has 
evolved a chemical system through which the mother’s hemoglobin can in effect hand 
off oxygen to the hemoglobin of the fetus.
▲ Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying 
protein in red blood cells. Oxygen 
binds to iron atoms, which are 
depicted here in white.

equilibrium constant than the reaction 
of maternal hemoglobin with oxygen, 
the fetus receives oxygen from the 
mother’s blood.
	 15.2	 The Concept of Dynamic Equilibrium
Recall from the previous chapter that reaction rates generally increase with increas-
ing concentration of the reactants and decrease with decreasing concentration of the 
reactants (unless the reaction order is zero). With this in mind, consider the reaction 
between hydrogen and iodine:
H2(g) + I2(g) ∆2 HI(g)
In this reaction, H2 and I2 react to form 2 HI molecules, but the 2 HI molecules can 
also react to re-form H2 and I2. A reaction such as this one—that can proceed in both the 
forward and reverse directions—is reversible. Suppose we begin with only H2 and I2 in a 
container (Figure 15.2a▶ on the next page). What happens? Initially H2 and I2 begin to 
react to form HI (Figure 15.2b). However, as H2 and I2 react, their concentrations decrease, 
which in turn decreases the rate of the forward reaction. At the same time, HI begins to form. 
As the concentration of HI increases, the reverse reaction begins to occur at a faster and 
faster rate. Eventually the rate of the reverse reaction (which has been increasing) equals 
the rate of the forward reaction (which has been decreasing). At that point, dynamic 
equilibrium is reached (Figure 15.2c, d▶):
Dynamic equilibrium for a chemical reaction is the condition in 
which the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse 
reaction.
Dynamic equilibrium is “dynamic” because the forward and reverse reactions 
are still occurring; however, they are occurring at the same rate. When dynamic 
equilibrium is reached, the concentrations of H2, I2, and HI no longer change. They 
remain constant because the reactants and products form at the same rate that they 
are depleted. Note that just because the concentrations of reactants and products no 
longer change at equilibrium does not mean that the concentrations of reactants and 
products are equal to one another at equilibrium. Some reactions reach equilibrium 
only after most of the reactants have formed products. Others reach equilibrium 
when only a small fraction of the reactants have formed products. It depends on  
the reaction.
Nearly all chemical reactions are at 
least theoretically reversible. In many 
cases, however, the reversibility is so 
small that it can be ignored.

Dynamic equilibrium: Rate of forward reaction 
= rate of reverse reaction. Concentrations of 
reactant(s) and product(s) no longer change.
As concentration of product increases, and 
concentrations of reactants decrease, rate of 
forward reaction slows down, and rate of reverse
reaction speeds up.
We can better understand dynamic equilibrium with a simple analogy. Imagine two 
neighboring countries (A and B) with a closed border between them (Figure 15.3▶). 
Country A is overpopulated and Country B is underpopulated. One day, the border 
between the two countries opens, and people immediately begin to leave Country A for 
Country B:
Country A ¡ Country B
▲ Figure 15.2  Dynamic Equilibrium  Equilibrium is reached in a chemical reaction 
when the concentrations of the reactants and products no longer change. The molecular 
images depict the progress of the reaction H2(g) + i2(g) ∆2 Hi(g). The graph shows the 
concentrations of H2, i2, and HI as a function of time. When the reaction reaches equilibrium, 
both the forward and reverse reactions continue, but at equal rates, so the concentrations of 
the reactants and products remain constant.

▲ Figure 15.3  A Population Analogy for Chemical Equilibrium  Because Country A 
is initially overpopulated, people migrate from Country A to Country B. As the population of 
Country A falls and that of Country B rises, the rate of migration from Country A to Country B 
decreases and the rate of migration from Country B to Country A increases. Eventually the two 
rates become equal. Equilibrium has been reached.
The population of Country A goes down as the population of Country B goes up. As peo-
ple leave Country A, however, the rate at which they leave slows down because as Country 
A becomes less populated, the pool of potential emigrants gets smaller. (In other words, 
the rate of emigration is directly proportional to the population—as the population 
decreases, the emigration rate goes down.) On the other hand, as people move into Coun-
try B, it gets more crowded and some people begin to move from Country B to Country A:
Country A — Country B
As the population of Country B continues to grow, the rate of people moving out of 
Country B gets faster. Eventually the rate of people moving out of Country A (which has 
been slowing down as people leave) equals the rate of people moving out of Country B 
(which has been increasing as Country B gets more crowded). Dynamic equilibrium has 
been reached:
Country A ∆Country B
Notice that when the two countries reach dynamic equilibrium, their populations no 
longer change because the number of people moving out of either country equals the 
number of people moving in. However, one country—because of its charm or the avail-
ability of good jobs or lower taxes, or for whatever other reason—may have a higher pop-
ulation than the other country, even when dynamic equilibrium is reached.
Similarly, when a chemical reaction reaches dynamic equilibrium, the rate of the 
forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction, and the concentrations of reac-
tants and products become constant. But the concentrations of reactants and products 
will not necessarily be equal at equilibrium, just as the populations of the two countries 
are not necessarily equal at equilibrium.

	 15.3	 The Equilibrium Constant (K)
We have just seen that the concentrations of reactants and products are not equal at equi-
librium—rather, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal. So what about 
the concentrations? What can we know about them? The concentrations, as we can 
see by reexamining Figure 15.2, become constant; they don’t change once equilibrium 
is reached (as long as the temperature is constant). We quantify the relative concentra-
tions of reactants and products at equilibrium with a quantity called the equilibrium con-
stant (K). Consider an equation for a generic chemical reaction:
aA + bB ∆cC + dD
where A and B are reactants, C and D are products, and a, b, c, and d are the respective 
stoichiometric coefficients in the chemical equation. The equilibrium constant (K) 
for the reaction is defined as the ratio—at equilibrium—of the concentrations of the 
products raised to their stoichiometric coefficients divided by the concentrations of the 
reactants raised to their stoichiometric coefficients:
K = [A]a[B]b
[C]c[D]d
Products
Reactants
Te Law of Mass Action
We distinguish between the 
equilibrium constant (K) and the 
Kelvin unit of temperature (K) by 
italicizing the equilibrium constant.
The Equilibrium Constant
In this notation, [A] represents the molar concentration of A.
Why is this particular ratio of concentrations at equilibrium—and not some 
other ratio—defined as the equilibrium constant? Because this particular ratio is 
always a constant when the reactants and products are at equilibrium (at constant tem-
perature). As we can see from the expression, the equilibrium constant quantifies the 
relative concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium. The relationship 
between the balanced chemical equation and the expression of the equilibrium con-
stant is the law of mass action.
Expressing Equilibrium Constants for  
Chemical Reactions
To express an equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction, we examine the balanced 
chemical equation and apply the law of mass action. For example, suppose we want to 
express the equilibrium constant for the reaction:
2 N2O5(g) ∆4 NO2(g) + O2(g)
The equilibrium constant is [NO2] raised to the fourth power multiplied by [O2] raised to 
the first power divided by [N2O5] raised to the second power:
K = [NO2]4[O2]
[N2O5]2
Notice that the coefficients in the chemical equation become the exponents in the expres-
sion of the equilibrium constant.

▼ Figure 15.4  The Meaning of 
a Large Equilibrium Constant  If the 
equilibrium constant for a reaction 
is large, the equilibrium point of the 
reaction lies far to the right—the 
concentration of products is large 
and the concentration of reactants 
is small.
The Significance of the Equilibrium Constant
You now know how to express the equilibrium constant, but what does it mean? What, 
for example, does a large equilibrium constant (K W 1) imply about a reaction? A large 
equilibrium constant indicates that the numerator (which specifies the amounts of 
products at equilibrium) is larger than the denominator (which specifies the amounts of 
reactants at equilibrium). Therefore, when the equilibrium constant is large, the forward 
reaction is favored. For example, consider the reaction:
H2(g) + Br2(g) ∆2 HBr(g)   K = 1.9 * 1019 (at 25 °C)
The equilibrium constant is large, indicating that the 
equilibrium point for the reaction lies far to the right—
high concentrations of products, low concentrations of 
reactants (Figure 15.4▶). Remember that the equilibrium 
constant says nothing about how fast a reaction reaches 
equilibrium, only how far the reaction has proceeded once 
equilibrium is reached. A reaction with a large equilibrium 
constant may be kinetically very slow and take a long time 
to reach equilibrium.
Conversely, what does a small equilibrium constant 
(K V 1) mean? It indicates that the reverse reaction is 
favored and that there will be more reactants than prod-
ucts when equilibrium is reached. For example, consider 
the reaction:
N2(g) + O2(g) ∆2 NO(g)  K = 4.1 * 10 - 31 (at 25 °C)
The equilibrium constant is very small, indicating that the 
equilibrium point for the reaction lies far to the left—high 
concentrations of reactants, low concentrations of products 
(Figure 15.5▶). This is fortunate because N2 and O2 are the 
main components of air. If this equilibrium constant were 
large, much of the N2 and O2 in air would react to form NO, 
a toxic gas.
Summarizing the Significance of the Equilibrium 
Constant:
▶
▶
K V 1 Reverse reaction is favored; forward reaction 
does not proceed very far.
▶
▶
K ≈1 Neither direction is favored; forward reaction 
proceeds about halfway.
▶
▶
K W 1 Forward reaction is favored; forward reaction 
proceeds essentially to completion.

Chemistry and Medicine | Life and Equilibrium
H
ave you ever tried to define life? If you have, you proba-
bly know that a definition is elusive. How are living 
things different from nonliving things? You may try to define 
living things as those things that can move. But of course 
many living things do not move (most plants, for example), 
and some nonliving things, such as glaciers and Earth it-
self, do move. So motion is neither unique to nor definitive 
of life. You may try to define living things as those things 
that can reproduce. But again, many living things, such as 
mules or sterile humans, cannot reproduce; yet they are 
alive. In addition, some nonliving things, such as crystals, 
for example, reproduce (in some sense). So what is unique 
about living things?
One definition of life involves the concept of equilibrium—
living things are not in equilibrium with their surroundings. Our 
body temperature, for 
­example, is not the same 
as the temperature of our 
surroundings. If we jump 
into a swimming pool, the 
acidity of our blood does not become the same as the acidity 
of the surrounding water. Living things, even the simplest ones, 
maintain some measure of disequilibrium with their 
­environment.
We must add one more concept, however, to complete 
our definition of life with respect to equilibrium. A cup of hot 
water is in disequilibrium with its environment with respect to 
temperature, yet it is not alive. The cup of hot water has no 
control over its disequilibrium, however, and will slowly come 
to equilibrium with its environment. In contrast, living things—
as long as they are alive—maintain and control their disequi-
librium. Your body temperature, for example, is not only in 
disequilibrium with your surroundings—it is in controlled dis-
equilibrium. Your body maintains your temperature within a 
specific range that is not in equilibrium with the surrounding 
temperature.
So, one criterion for life is that living things are in controlled 
disequilibrium with their environment. Maintaining disequilibrium 
is a main activity of living organisms, requiring energy ­obtained 
from their environment. Plants derive that energy from sunlight; 
animals eat plants (or other animals that have eaten plants), 
and thus they too ultimately derive their energy from the sun. A 
living thing comes into equilibrium with its surroundings only 
after it dies.

cells alive?

Relationships between the Equilibrium Constant and 
the Chemical Equation
If a chemical equation is modified in some way, then the equilibrium constant for the 
equation changes because of the modification. The following three modifications are 
common:
1.	 If you reverse the equation, invert the equilibrium constant.  For example, 
consider this equilibrium equation:
A + 2 B ∆3 C
The expression for the equilibrium constant of this reaction is:
Kforward =
[C]3
[A][B]2
If you reverse the equation:
3 C ∆A + 2 B
then, according to the law of mass action, the expression for the equilibrium con-
stant becomes:
Kreverse = [A][B]2
[C]3
=
1
Kforward
2.	 If you multiply the coefficients in the equation by a factor, raise the 
equilibrium constant to the same factor.  Consider again this chemical 
equation and corresponding expression for the equilibrium constant:
A + 2 B ∆3 C  K =
[C]3
[A][B]2
If you multiply the equation by n, you get:
n A + 2n B ∆3n C
Applying the law of mass action, the expression for the equilibrium constant becomes:
K′ =
[C]3n
[A]n[B]2n = a [C]3
[A][B]2b
n
= Kn
3.	 If you add two or more individual chemical equations to obtain an overall 
equation, multiply the corresponding equilibrium constants by each 
other to obtain the overall equilibrium constant.  Consider these two chemi-
cal equations and their corresponding equilibrium constant expressions:
 A ∆2 B   K1 = [B]2
[A]
 2 B ∆3 C   K2 = [C]3
[B]2
The two equations sum as follows:
 A ∆2 B
 2 B ∆3 C
 A ∆3 C
According to the law of mass action, the equilibrium constant for this overall 
­equation is then:
Koverall = [C]3
[A]
Notice that Koverall is the product of K1 and K2 :
 Koverall = K1 * K2
 = [B]2
[A] * [C]3
[B]2
 = [C]3

	 15.4	 Expressing the Equilibrium Constant  
in Terms of Pressure
So far, we have expressed the equilibrium constant only in terms of the concentrations of the 
reactants and products. For gaseous reactions, the partial pressure of a particular gas is pro-
portional to its concentration. Therefore, we can also express the equilibrium constant in 
terms of the partial pressures of the reactants and products. Consider the gaseous reaction:
2 SO3(g) ∆2 SO2(g) + O2(g)

	
15.4  Expressing the Equilibrium Constant in Terms of Pressure 	
685
From this point on, we designate Kc as the equilibrium constant with respect to concentra-
tion in molarity. For the reaction just given, we can express Kc using the law of mass action:
Kc = [SO2]2[O2]
[SO3]2
We now designate Kp as the equilibrium constant with respect to partial pressures 
in atmospheres. The expression for Kp takes the form of the expression for Kc, except that we 
use the partial pressure of each gas in place of its concentration. For the SO3 reaction, we 
write Kp as:
Kp =
(PSO2)2PO2
(PSO3)2
where PA is simply the partial pressure of gas A in units of atmospheres.
Relationship Between Kp and Kc
Since the partial pressure of a gas in atmospheres is not the same as its concentration 
in molarity, the value of Kp for a reaction is not necessarily equal to the value of Kc. 
However, as long as the gases are behaving ideally, we can derive a relationship between 
the two constants. The concentration of an ideal gas A is the number of moles of A (nA) 
divided by its volume (V) in liters:
[A] = nA
V
From the ideal gas law, we can relate the quantity nA>V to the partial pressure of A as 
follows:
 PAV = nART
 PA = nA
V RT
Since [A] = nA>V, we can write:
	
PA = [A]RT  or  [A] = PA
RT
[15.1]
Now consider the following general equilibrium chemical equation:
aA + bB ∆c C + d D
According to the law of mass action, we write Kc as follows:
Kc = [C]c[D]d
[A]a[B]b
Substituting [X] = PX>RT for each concentration term, we get:
 Kc =

Rearranging,
Kp = Kc(RT)c + d - (a + b)
Finally, if we let ∆n = c + d - (a + b), which is the sum of the stoichiometric coeffi-
cients of the gaseous products minus the sum of the stoichiometric coefficients of the 
gaseous reactants, we get the following general result:
	
Kp = Kc(RT)∆n 
[15.2]
Notice that if the total number of moles of gas is the same after the reaction as before, 
then ∆n = 0, and Kp is equal to Kc.
In the equation Kp = Kc(RT)∆n, the 
quantity ∆n represents the difference 
between the number of moles of 
gaseous products and gaseous 
reactants.

Units of K
Throughout this book, we express concentrations and partial pressures within the equi-
librium constant expression in units of molarity and atmospheres, respectively. When 
expressing the value of the equilibrium constant, however, we have not included the 
units. Formally, the values of concentration or partial pressure that we substitute into the 
equilibrium constant expression are ratios of the concentration or pressure to a reference 
concentration (exactly 1 M) or a reference pressure (exactly 1 atm).
For example, within the equilibrium constant expression, a pressure of 1.5 atm 
becomes:
1.5 atm
1 atm
= 1.5
Similarly, a concentration of 1.5 M becomes:
1.5 M 
1 M
= 1.5
As long as concentration units are expressed in molarity for Kc and pressure units are 
expressed in atmospheres for Kp, we can skip this formality and enter the quantities 
directly into the equilibrium expression, dropping their corresponding units.

	 15.5	 Heterogeneous Equilibria: Reactions 
Involving Solids and Liquids
Many chemical reactions involve pure solids or pure liquids as reactants or products. 
Consider, for example, the reaction:
2 CO(g) ∆CO2(g) + C(s)
We might expect the expression for the equilibrium constant to be:
Kc = [CO2][C]
[CO]2  (incorrect)
However, since carbon is a solid, its concentration is constant (if you double the 
amount of carbon its concentration remains the same). The concentration of a solid does not 
change because a solid does not expand to fill its container. Its concentration, therefore, 
depends only on its density, which is constant as long as some solid is present (Figure 15.6▼). 
Consequently, pure solids—those reactants or products labeled in the chemical equation 
with an (s)—are not included in the equilibrium expression (because their constant value is 
incorporated into the value of K). The correct equilibrium expression for this reaction is 
therefore:
Kc = [CO2]
[CO]2
Similarly, the concentration of a pure liquid does not change. So, pure liquids—
reactants or products labeled in the chemical equation with an (/)—are also excluded 
from the equilibrium expression. For example, consider the equilibrium expression for 
the reaction between carbon dioxide and water:
CO2(g) + H2O(/) ∆H +(aq) + HCO3
-(aq)
Since H2O(/) is pure liquid, it is omitted from the equilibrium expression:
Kc = [H +][HCO3

Chapter 15  Chemical Equilibrium
	 15.6	 Calculating the Equilibrium Constant 
from Measured Equilibrium 
Concentrations
The most direct way to obtain an experimental value for the equilibrium constant of a 
reaction is to measure the concentrations of the reactants and products in a reaction 
mixture at equilibrium. Consider the following reaction:
H2(g) + I2(g) ∆2 HI(g)
Suppose a mixture of H2 and I2 is allowed to come to equilibrium at 445 °C. The measured 
equilibrium concentrations are [H2] = 0.11 M, [I2] = 0.11 M, and [HI] = 0.78 M. What 
is the value of the equilibrium constant at this temperature?
We can write the expression for Kc from the balanced equation:
Kc =
[HI]2
[H2][I2]
To calculate the value of Kc, we substitute the correct equilibrium concentrations into 
the expression for Kc:
 Kc =
[HI]2
[H2][I2]
 =
(0.78)2
(0.11)(0.11)
 = 5.0 * 101
The concentrations within Kc should always be written in moles per liter (M); however, 
as noted in Section 15.4, we do not normally include the units when expressing the 
value of the equilibrium constant, so Kc is unitless.
For any reaction, the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products 
depend on the initial concentrations (and in general vary from one set of initial concen-
trations to another). However, the equilibrium constant is always the same at a given 
temperature, regardless of the initial concentrations. For example, Table 15.1 shows sev-
eral different equilibrium concentrations of H2, I2, and HI, each from a different set of

(c)	 NH4NO3(s) ∆N2O(g) + 2 H2O(g)

though it has no formal part in the

initial concentrations. Notice that the equilibrium constant is always the same, regard-
less of the initial concentrations. Whether we start with only reactants or only products, 
the reaction reaches equilibrium concentrations at which the equilibrium constant is 
the same. No matter what the initial concentrations are, the reaction always goes in a 
direction that ensures that the equilibrium concentrations—when substituted into the 
equilibrium expression—give the same constant, K.
So far, we have calculated equilibrium constants from values of the equilibrium 
concentrations of all the reactants and products. In most cases, however, we need only 
know the initial concentrations of the reactant(s) and the equilibrium concentration of 
any one reactant or product. We can deduce the other equilibrium concentrations from 
the stoichiometry of the reaction.
For example, consider the simple reaction:
A(g) ∆2 B(g)
Suppose that we have a reaction mixture in which the initial concentration of A is 1.00 M 
and the initial concentration of B is 0.00 M. When equilibrium is reached, the concentra-
tion of A is 0.75 M. Since [A] has changed by -0.25 M, we can deduce (based on the stoi-
chiometry) that [B] must have changed by 2 * (+0.25 M) or +0.50 M. We summarize the 
initial conditions, the changes, and the equilibrium conditions in the following table:
[A]

We refer to this type of table as an ICE table (I = initial, C = change, E =

write an expression for the equilibrium constant and then substitute the equilibrium 
concentrations from the ICE table:

cedure in the center and right columns.

in Example 15.5 between CO and H2 
is carried out at a different tempera-
ture with initial concentrations of

the concentration of H2 is 0.012 M. 
Find the equilibrium constant at 
this temperature.
	 15.7	 The Reaction Quotient: Predicting  
the Direction of Change
When the reactants of a chemical reaction mix, they generally react to form products—
we say that the reaction proceeds to the right (toward the products). The amount of 
products that forms when a reaction reaches equilibrium depends on the magnitude of 
the equilibrium constant, as we have seen. However, what if a reaction mixture that is 
not at equilibrium contains both reactants and products? Can we predict the direction of 
change for such a mixture?
To gauge the progress of a reaction relative to equilibrium, we use a quantity called 
the reaction quotient. The definition of the reaction quotient takes the same form as the 
definition of the equilibrium constant, except that the reaction need not be at equilib-
rium. So, for the general reaction:
aA + bB ∆cC + dD
we define the reaction quotient (Qc) as the ratio—at any point in the reaction—of 
the concentrations of the products raised to their stoichiometric coefficients divided by 
the concentrations of the reactants raised to their stoichiometric coefficients. For gases 
with amounts measured in atmospheres, the reaction quotient uses the partial pressures 
in place of concentrations and is called Q p:
Q c = [C]c[D]d
[A]a[B]b  Q p = Pc
CPd
D
Pa
APb
B
The difference between the reaction quotient and the equilibrium constant is that, 
at a given temperature, the equilibrium constant has only one value and it specifies the 
relative amounts of reactants and products at equilibrium. The reaction quotient, by con-
trast, depends on the current state of the reaction and has many different values as the 
reaction proceeds. For example, in a reaction mixture containing only reactants, the 
reaction quotient is zero (Q c = 0):
Q c = [0]c[0]d
[A]a[B]b = 0
In a reaction mixture containing only products, the reaction quotient is infinite (Q c = ∞):
Q c = [C]c[D]d
[0]a[0]b = ∞
In a reaction mixture containing both reactants and products, each at a concentration 
of 1 M, the reaction quotient is one (Q c = 1):
Q c = (1)c(1)d
(1)a(1)b = 1
The reaction quotient is useful because the value of Q relative to K is a measure of 
the progress of the reaction toward equilibrium. At equilibrium, the reaction quotient is

tion decreases and the product concentration increases—the reaction proceeds to the 
right. For the second set of values, Q is greater than K and must therefore get smaller as 
the reaction proceeds toward equilibrium. Q gets smaller as the reactant concentration 
increases and the product concentration decreases—the reaction proceeds to the left. In 
the third set of values, Q = K, implying that the reaction is at equilibrium—the reaction 
will not proceed in either direction.

Example 15.7	
Predicting the Direction of a Reaction by Comparing Q and K
Consider the reaction and its equilibrium constant at 25.0 °C:
I2(g) + Cl2(g) ∆2 ICl(g)  Kp = 81.9
A reaction mixture contains PI2 = 0.114 atm, PCl2 = 0.102 atm, and PICl = 0.355 atm. Is the reaction mixture at 
­equilibrium? If not, in which direction will the reaction proceed?

To determine the progress of the reaction relative to the 
­equilibrium state, first calculate Q.
 Q p = a P2

 =

(0.114)(0.102)

Compare Q to K.
Q p = 10.8; Kp = 81.9
Since Q p 6 Kp, the reaction is not at equilibrium and will 
proceed to the right.
For Practice 15.7  Consider the reaction and its equilibrium constant:
N2O4(g) ∆2 NO2(g)  Kc = 5.85 * 10 - 3 (at some temperature)
A reaction mixture contains [NO2] = 0.0255 M and [N2O4] = 0.0331 M. Calculate Q c and determine the direction in 
which the reaction will proceed.

Q and K  For the reaction N2O4(g) ∆2 NO2(g), a reaction mixture at a certain 
temperature initially contains both N2O4 and NO2 in their standard states (see the 
definition of standard state in Section 6.9). If Kp = 0.15, which statement is true of the 
reaction mixture before any reaction occurs?
(a)	 Q = K; the reaction is at equilibrium.
(b)	 Q 6 K; the reaction will proceed to the right.
(c)	 Q 7 K; the reaction will proceed to the left.
	 15.8	 Finding Equilibrium Concentrations
In Section 15.6, we discussed how to calculate an equilibrium constant from the equi-
librium concentrations of the reactants and products. Just as commonly we will want 
to calculate equilibrium concentrations of reactants or products from the equilibrium 
constant. These kinds of calculations are important because they allow us to calculate 
the amount of a reactant or product at equilibrium. For example, in a synthesis reaction, 
we might want to know how much of the product forms when the reaction reaches equi-
librium. Or for the hemoglobin–oxygen equilibrium discussed in Section 15.1, we might 
want to know the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin present under certain oxy-
gen concentrations within the lungs or muscles.
We divide these types of problems into two categories: (1) finding equilibrium 
concentrations when we know the equilibrium constant and all but one of the equi-
librium concentrations of the reactants and products, and (2) finding equilibrium 
Finding Equilibrium Concentra-
tions from Initial Concentrations

Chapter 15  Chemical Equilibrium
concentrations when we know the equilibrium constant and only initial concentra-
tions. The second category of problem is more difficult than the first. Let’s examine 
each separately.
Finding Equilibrium Concentrations from the Equilibrium 
Constant and All but One of the Equilibrium 
Concentrations of the Reactants and Products
We can use the equilibrium constant to calculate the equilibrium concentration of one 
of the reactants or products, given the equilibrium concentrations of the others. To solve 
this type of problem, we follow our general problem-solving procedure.
Example 15.8	
Finding Equilibrium Concentrations When You Know the Equilibrium  
Constant and All but One of the Equilibrium Concentrations of the  
Reactants and Products
Consider the following reaction:
2 COF2(g) ∆CO2(g) + CF4(g)  Kc = 2.00 at 1000 °C
In an equilibrium mixture, the concentration of COF2 is 0.255 M and the concentration of CF4 is 0.118 M. What is the 
equilibrium concentration of CO2 ?
SORT  You are given the equilibrium constant of a chemical reaction, 
together with the equilibrium concentrations of the reactant and one 
product. You are asked to find the equilibrium concentration of the 
other product.
GIVEN:  [COF2] = 0.255 M
 [CF4] = 0.118 M

CHECK  Check your answer by mentally substituting the given values of [COF2] and [CF4] as well as your calculated value 
for CO2 back into the equilibrium expression:
Kc = [CO2][CF4]
[COF2]2
[CO2] is roughly equal to 1. [COF2]2 ≈0.06 and [CF4] ≈0.12. Therefore Kc is approximately 2, as given in the problem.
For Practice 15.8  Diatomic iodine [I2] decomposes at high temperature to form I atoms according to the reaction:
I2(g) ∆2 I(g)   Kc = 0.011 at 1200 °C
In an equilibrium mixture, the concentration of I2 is 0.10 M. What is the equilibrium concentration of I?

	
15.8  Finding Equilibrium Concentrations	
695
Finding Equilibrium Concentrations from the 
Equilibrium Constant and Initial Concentrations  
or Pressures
More commonly, we know the equilibrium constant and only initial concentrations of reac-
tants and need to find the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants or products. These kinds 
of problems are generally more involved than those we just examined and require a specific 
procedure to solve them. The procedure has some similarities to the one used in Examples 
15.5 and 15.6 in that we set up an ICE table showing the initial concentrations, the changes, 
and the equilibrium concentrations. However, unlike in Examples 15.5 and 15.6, here the 
changes in concentration are not known and are represented with the variable x.
For example, consider again the simple reaction:
A(g) ∆2 B(g)
Suppose that, as before (see Section 15.6), we have a reaction mixture in which the 
­initial concentration of A is 1.0 M and the initial concentration of B is 0.00 M. However, 
now we know the equilibrium constant, K = 0.33, and want to find the equilibrium 
concentrations. We know that because Q = 0, the reaction proceeds to the right 
(towards the products). We set up the ICE table with the given initial concentrations 
and then represent the unknown change in [A] with the variable x as follows:
Initial

Equil
1.0
−x
1.0 − x
0.00
+2x
2x
Represent changes

with the variable x.
[A]
[B]
Notice that, due to the stoichiometry of the reaction, the change in [B] must be 
+2x. As before, each equilibrium concentration is the sum of the two entries above it 
in the ICE table. In order to find the equilibrium concentrations of A and B, we must 
find the value of the variable x. Since we know the value of the equilibrium constant, 
we can use the equilibrium constant expression to set up an equation in which x is 
the only variable:
K = [B]2
[A] =
(2x)2
1.0 - x = 0.33
or more simply:
4x2
1.0 - x = 0.33
This equation is a quadratic equation—it contains the variable x raised to the second 
power. In general, we can solve quadratic equations with the quadratic formula (see 
Appendix IC), which we introduce in Example 15.10. If the quadratic equation is a per-
fect square, however, we can solve it by simpler means, as shown in Example 15.9. For 
both of these examples, we give the general procedure in the left column and apply the 
procedure to the two different example problems in the center and right columns. Later 
in this section, we see that quadratic equations can often be simplified by making some 
approximations based on our chemical knowledge.

5.	 Substitute the expressions for 
the equilibrium concentrations 
(from step 4) into the expression 
for the equilibrium constant. 
Using the given value of the 
equilibrium constant, solve the 
expression for the ­variable x. In 
some cases, such as Example 15.9, 
you can take the square root of both 
sides of the expression to solve for x. 
In other cases, such as Example 15.10, 
you must solve a quadratic equation 
to find x.

 x = 0.176 or x = 0.014
6.	 Substitute x into the 
­expressions for the equilibrium 
concentrations of the reactants 
and products (from step 4) and 
calculate the concentrations. In 
cases where you solved a quadratic 
and have two values for x, choose 
the value for x that gives a physically 
realistic answer. For example, reject 
the value of x that results in any 
negative concentrations.
 [N2] = 0.200 - 0.027
 = 0.173 M
 [O2] = 0.200 - 0.027
 = 0.173 M
 [NO] = 2(0.027)
 = 0.054 M
We reject the root x = 0.176 because it 
gives a negative concentration for NO2. 
Using x = 0.014, we get the following 
concentrations:
 [NO2] = 0.100 - 2x
 = 0.100 - 2(0.014) = 0.072 M
 [N2O4] = x
 = 0.014 M
7.	 Check your answer by 
­substituting the calculated 
equilibrium values into the 
equilibrium expression. The 
­calculated value of K should 
match the given value of K.  
Note that ­rounding errors could 
cause a difference in the least signif-
icant digit when comparing values 
of the equilibrium constant.
 Kc =
[NO]2
[N2][O2]
 =
(0.054)2
(0.173)(0.173) = 0.097
Since the calculated value of Kc 
matches the given value (to within 
one digit in the least significant 
­figure), the answer is valid.
 Kc = [NO2]2
[N2O4] = (0.072)2
0.014
 = 0.37
Since the calculated value of Kc matches 
the given value (to within one digit in 
the least significant figure), the answer 
is valid.
For Practice 15.9 
The reaction in Example 15.9 is 
carried out at a different 
temperature at which Kc = 0.055. 
This time, however, the reaction 
mixture starts with only the 
product, [NO] = 0.0100 M, and 
no reactants. Find the 
equilibrium concentrations of 
N2, O2, and NO at equilibrium.
For Practice 15.10 
The reaction in Example 15.10 is 
carried out at the same temperature, 
but this time the reaction mixture 
initially contains only the reactant, 
[N2O4] = 0.0250 M, and no NO2. 
Find the equilibrium concentrations 
of N2O4 and NO2.
When the initial conditions are given in terms of partial pressures (instead of con-
centrations) and the equilibrium constant is given as Kp instead of Kc, use the same pro-
cedure, but substitute partial pressures for concentrations, as shown in Example 15.11.

 PI2 = 0.100 - 0.0729 = 0.027 atm
 PCl2 = 0.100 - 0.0729 = 0.027 atm

Simplifying Approximations in Working  
Equilibrium Problems
For some equilibrium problems of the type shown in Examples 15.9, 15.10, and 15.11, we can 
make an approximation that simplifies the calculations without any significant loss of accu-
racy. For example, if the equilibrium constant is relatively small, the reaction will not pro-
ceed very far to the right. Therefore, if the initial reactant concentration is relatively large, 
we can make the assumption that x is small relative to the initial concentration of reactant.
To see how this approximation works, consider again the simple reaction A ∆2 B. 
Suppose that, as before, we have a reaction mixture in which the initial concentration of A 
is 1.0 M and the initial concentration of B is 0.0 M and that we want to find the equilib-
rium concentrations. However, suppose that in this case the equilibrium constant is much 
smaller, say K = 3.3 * 10 - 5. The ICE table is identical to the one we set up previously:
[A]
[B]
Initial
1.0
0.0
Change
-x
+2x
Equil
1.0 - x
2x
Except for the value of K, we end up with the exact quadratic equation that we had 
before:
K = [B]2
[A] =
(2x)2
1.0 - x = 3.3 * 10 - 5
or more simply:
4x2
1.0 - x = 3.3 * 10 - 5
We can rearrange this quadratic equation into standard form and solve it using the 
­quadratic formula. But since K is small, the reaction will not proceed very far toward 
products and, therefore, x will also be small. If x is much smaller than 1.0, then (1.0 - x) 
(the quantity in the denominator) can be approximated by (1.0):
4x2
(1.0 - x) = 3.3 * 10 - 5
This approximation greatly simplifies the equation, which we can then solve for x as 
follows:
 4x2
1.0 = 3.3 * 10 - 5
 4x2 = 3.3 * 10 - 5
 x = B
3.3 * 10 - 5
4
= 0.0029
We can check the validity of this approximation by comparing the calculated value 
of x to the number it was subtracted from. The ratio of x to the number it is subtracted 
from should be less than 0.05 (or 5%) for the approximation to be valid. In this case, we 
subtracted x from 1.0, and we calculate the ratio of the value of x to 1.0 as follows:
0.0029
1.0
* 100% = 0.29%
The approximation is therefore valid.

Chapter 15  Chemical Equilibrium
In Examples 15.12 and 15.13, we treat two nearly identical problems—the only dif-
ference is the initial concentration of the reactant. In Example 15.12, the initial concen-
tration of the reactant is relatively large, the equilibrium constant is small, and the x is 
small approximation works well. In Example 15.13, however, the initial concentration of 
the reactant is much smaller, and even though the equilibrium constant is the same, the 
x is small approximation does not work (because the initial concentration is also small). 
In cases such as this, we have a couple of options to solve the problem. We can either 
solve the equation exactly (using the quadratic formula, for example), or we can use the 
method of successive approximations, which is introduced in Example 15.13. In this 
method, we essentially solve for x as if it were small, and then substitute the value 
obtained back into the equation (where x was initially neglected) to solve for x again. We 
repeat this process until the calculated value of x stops changing with each iteration, an 
indication that we have arrived at an acceptable value for x.
Note that the x is small approximation does not imply that x is zero. If that were the 
case, the reactant and product concentrations would not change from their initial val-
ues. The x is small approximation just means that when x is added or subtracted to 
another number, it does not change that number by very much. For example, we can 
calculate the value of the difference 1.0 - x when x = 3.0 * 10 - 4:
1.0 - x = 1.0 - 3.0 * 10 - 4 = 0.9997 = 1.0
Since the value of 1.0 is known only to two significant figures, subtracting the small x 
does not change the value at all. This situation is similar to weighing yourself on a bath-
room scale with and without a penny in your pocket. Unless your scale is unusually pre-
cise, removing the penny from your pocket will not change the reading on the scale. 
This does not imply that the penny is weightless, only that its weight is small when com-
pared to your body weight. You can neglect the weight of the penny in reading your 
weight with no detectable loss in accuracy.

5.	 Substitute the expressions for the 
equilibrium concentrations (from 
step 4) into the expression for the 
equilibrium constant. Use the 
given value of the equilibrium 
constant to solve the resulting 
equation for the variable x.
	
In this case, the resulting equa-
tion is cubic in x. Although cubic 
equations can be solved, the 
solutions are not usually simple. 
However, since the equilibrium 
constant is small, we know that 
the reaction does not proceed 
very far to the right. Therefore, 
x is a small number and can be 
dropped from any quantities in 
which it is added to or subtracted 
from another number (as long 
as the number itself is not too 
small).
	
Check whether your approxi-
mation is valid by ­comparing 
the calculated value of x to the 
number it was added to or sub-
tracted from. The ratio of the two 
numbers should be less than 0.05 
(or 5%) for the approximation to 
be valid. If the approximation is

valid, you can either solve the 
equation exactly (by hand or

mations is used.
	
Substitute the value obtained 
for x in step 5 back into the 
original cubic equation, but 
only at the exact spot where you 
assumed x was negligible, and 
then solve the equation for x 
again. Continue this procedure 
until the value of x you obtain 
from solving the equation is 
the same as the one that you 
substituted into the equation.

x = 1.27 * 10 - 5
If we substitute this value of x back into 
the cubic equation and solve it, we get 
x = 1.28 * 10 - 5, which is nearly 
­identical to 1.27 * 10 - 5. Therefore, we 
have arrived at the best approximation 
for x.

 [H2] = 2(2.97 * 10 - 4)
 = 5.94 * 10 - 4 M
 [S2] = 2.97 * 10 - 4 M
 [H2S] = 2.50 * 10 - 4 - 2(1.28 * 10 - 5)
 = 2.24 * 10 - 4 M
 [H2] = 2(1.28 * 10 - 5)
 = 2.56 * 10 - 5 M
[S2] = 1.28 * 10 - 5 M
7.	
Check your answer by 
­substituting the calculated 
equilibrium values into the 
equilibrium expression. The 
­calculated value of K should 
match the given value of K. 
Note that the approximation 
method and rounding errors 
could cause a difference of up to 
about 5% when comparing val-
ues of the equilibrium constant.
 Kc = (5.94 * 10 - 4)2(2.97 * 10 - 4)
(0.0244)2
 = 1.76 * 10 - 7
The calculated value of K is close 
enough to the given value when you 
consider the uncertainty introduced by 
the approximation. Therefore the 
answer is valid.
 Kc = (2.56 * 10 - 5)2(1.28 * 10 - 5)
(2.24 * 10 - 4)2
 = 1.67 * 10 - 7
The calculated value of K is equal to the 
given value. Therefore the answer is 
valid.

	 15.9	 Le Châtelier’s Principle: How a System 
at Equilibrium Responds to Disturbances
We have seen that a chemical system not in equilibrium tends to progress toward 
equilibrium and that the relative concentrations of the reactants and products at 
equilibrium are characterized by the equilibrium constant, K. What happens, how-
ever, when a chemical system already at equilibrium is disturbed? Le Châtelier’s 
principle states that the chemical system responds to minimize the disturbance.
Le Châtelier’s principle: When a chemical system at equilibrium  
is disturbed, the system shifts in a direction that minimizes the 
disturbance.
In other words, a system at equilibrium tends to maintain that equilibrium—it bounces 
back when disturbed.
We can understand Le Châtelier’s principle by returning to our two neighboring 
countries analogy. Suppose the populations of Country A and Country B are at equilib-
rium. This means that the rate of people moving out of Country A and into Country B is 
equal to the rate of people moving into Country A and out of Country B, and the popu-
lations of the two countries are stable:
Country A ∆Country B
Now imagine disturbing the balance (Figure 15.8▼). Suppose there is a notable 
increase in the birthrate in Country B. What happens? After Country B becomes more 
crowded, the rate of people leaving Country B increases. The net flow of people is out of 
Country B and into Country A. Equilibrium is disturbed by the addition of more people 
to Country B, and people leave Country B in response. In effect, the system responded 
by shifting in the direction that minimized the disturbance.
On the other hand, what happens if there is a baby boom in Country A? As 
­Country A gets more crowded, the rate of people leaving Country A increases. The net 
flow of people is out of Country A and into Country B. The number of people in 
Country A initially increases, and the system responds; people move out of Country A. 
System responds to
minimize disturbance.
Equilibrium is 
disturbed when
the population 
in Country B
grows.

The two-country analogy should help

system in equilibrium—it should not 
be taken as an exact parallel.
Le Châtelier's Principle

Chapter 15  Chemical Equilibrium
Chemical systems behave similarly: when their equilibrium is disturbed, they react to 
counter the disturbance. We can disturb a system in chemical equilibrium in several 
different ways, including changing the concentration of a reactant or product, chang-
ing the volume or pressure, and changing the temperature. We consider each of these 
separately.
The Effect of a Concentration Change on Equilibrium
Consider the following reaction in chemical equilibrium:
N2O4(g) ∆2 NO2(g)
Suppose we disturb the equilibrium by adding NO2 to the equilibrium mixture 
­(Figure 15.9▼). In other words, we increase the concentration of NO2, the product. 
What happens? According to Le Châtelier’s principle, the system shifts in a direction 
to minimize the disturbance. The reaction goes to the left (it proceeds in the reverse 
direction), consuming some of the added NO2 and thus bringing its concentration 
back down, as shown graphically in Figure 15.10a▶:
2 NO2(g)

Reaction shifts left.
Add NO2.
The reaction shifts to the left because the value of Q changes as follows:
• Before addition of NO2 : Q = K.
• Immediately after addition of NO2 : Q 7 K.
• Reaction shifts to the left to reestablish equilibrium.
On the other hand, what happens if we add extra N2O4 (the reactant), increasing 
its concentration? In this case, the reaction shifts to the right, consuming some of

The reaction shifts to the right because the value of Q changes as follows:
• Before addition of N2O4 : Q = K.
• Immediately after addition of N2O4 : Q 6 K.
• Reaction shifts to the right to reestablish equilibrium.
In both of these cases (either adding NO2 or adding N2O4), the system shifts in a 
direction that minimizes the disturbance. Lowering the concentration of a reactant 
(which makes Q 7 K) causes the system to shift in the direction of the reactants to mini-
mize the disturbance. Lowering the concentration of a product (which makes Q 6 K) 
causes the system to shift in the direction of products.
Summarizing the Effect of a Concentration Change on Equilibrium:
If a chemical system is at equilibrium:
▶
▶
Increasing the concentration of one or more of the reactants (which makes Q 6 K) 
causes the reaction to shift to the right (in the direction of the products).
▶
▶
Increasing the concentration of one or more of the products (which makes Q 7 K) 
causes the reaction to shift to the left (in the direction of the reactants).
▶
▶
Decreasing the concentration of one or more of the reactants (which makes Q 7 K) 
causes the reaction to shift to the left (in the direction of the reactants).
▶
▶
Decreasing the concentration of one or more of the products (which makes Q 6 K) 
causes the reaction to shift to the right (in the direction of the products).

Chapter 15  Chemical Equilibrium
The Effect of a Volume (or Pressure) Change on 
Equilibrium
How does a system in chemical equilibrium respond to a volume change? Recall from 
Chapter 5 that changing the volume of a gas (or a gas mixture) results in a change in 
pressure. Remember also that pressure and volume are inversely related: a decrease in vol-
ume causes an increase in pressure, and an increase in volume causes a decrease in pres-
sure. So, if the volume of a reaction mixture at chemical equilibrium is changed, the 
pressure changes and the system shifts in a direction to minimize that change.
For example, consider the following reaction at equilibrium in a cylinder equipped 
with a moveable piston:
N2(g) + 3 H2(g) ∆2 NH3(g)
What happens if we push down on the piston, lowering the volume and raising the pres-
sure (Figure 15.11▶)? How can the chemical system respond to bring the pressure back 
down? Look carefully at the reaction coefficients. If the reaction shifts to the right, 4 mol 
of gas particles are converted to 2 mol of gas particles. From the ideal gas law (PV = nRT), 
we know that decreasing the number of moles of a gas (n) results in a lower pressure (P). 
Therefore, the system shifts to the right, decreasing the number of gas molecules and 
bringing the pressure back down, minimizing the disturbance.
Consider the same reaction mixture at equilibrium again. What happens if, this 
time, we pull up on the piston, increasing the volume (Figure 15.11b ▶)? The higher vol-
ume results in a lower pressure and the system responds to bring the pressure back up. It 
does this by shifting to the left, converting 2 mol of gas particles into 4 mol of gas parti-
cles, increasing the pressure and minimizing the disturbance.
Consider again the same reaction mixture at equilibrium. What happens if, this 
time, we keep the volume the same but increase the pressure by adding an inert gas to the 
mixture? Although the overall pressure of the mixture increases, the partial pressures of 
the reactants and products do not change. Consequently, there is no effect, and the 
reaction does not shift in either direction.
Summarizing the Effect of Volume Change on Equilibrium:
If a chemical system is at equilibrium:
▶
▶
Decreasing the volume causes the reaction to shift in the direction that has the fewer 
moles of gas particles.
▶
▶
Increasing the volume causes the reaction to shift in the direction that has the greater 
number of moles of gas particles.
Example 15.14	
The Effect of a Concentration Change  
on Equilibrium
Consider the following reaction at equilibrium:
CaCO3(s) ∆CaO(s) + CO2(g)
What is the effect of adding additional CO2 to the reaction mixture? What is the 
effect of adding additional CaCO3?
Solution
Adding additional CO2 increases the concentration of CO2 and causes the reac-
tion to shift to the left. Adding additional CaCO3, however, does not increase the 
concentration of CaCO3 because CaCO3 is a solid and therefore has a constant 
concentration. Thus, adding additional CaCO3 has no effect on the position of 
the equilibrium. (Note that, as we saw in Section 15.5, solids are not included in 
the equilibrium expression.)
For Practice 15.14  Consider the following reaction in chemical equilibrium:
2 BrNO(g) ∆2 NO(g) + Br2(g)
What is the effect of adding additional Br2 to the reaction mixture? What is the 
effect of adding additional BrNO?
In considering the effect of a change 
in volume, we are assuming that the 
change in volume is carried out at 
constant temperature.

2 KClO3(s) ∆2 KCl(s) + 3 O2(g)
What is the effect of decreasing the volume of the reaction mixture? Increasing 
the volume of the reaction mixture? Adding an inert gas at constant volume?
Solution
The chemical equation has 3 mol of gas on the right and zero moles of gas on the 
left. Decreasing the volume of the reaction mixture increases the pressure and 
causes the reaction to shift to the left (toward the side with fewer moles of gas 
particles). Increasing the volume of the reaction mixture decreases the pressure 
and causes the reaction to shift to the right (toward the side with more moles of 
gas particles.) Adding an inert gas has no effect.

Chapter 15  Chemical Equilibrium
The Effect of a Temperature Change on Equilibrium
When a system at equilibrium is disturbed by a change in concentration or a change in 
volume, the equilibrium shifts to counter the change, but the equilibrium constant does 
not change. In other words, changes in volume or concentration generally change Q , 
not K, and the system responds by shifting so that Q becomes equal to K. In contrast, a 
change in temperature changes the actual value of the equilibrium constant. Nonethe-
less, we can use Le Châtelier’s principle to predict the effects of a temperature change.
If we increase the temperature of a reaction mixture at equilibrium, the reaction 
shifts in the direction that tends to decrease the temperature and vice versa. Recall from 
Chapter 6 that an exothermic reaction (negative ∆H) emits heat:
Exothermic reaction: A + B ∆C + D + heat
We can think of heat as a product in an exothermic reaction. In an endothermic reac-
tion (positive ∆H), the reaction absorbs heat:
Endothermic reaction: A + B + heat ∆C + D
We can think of heat as a reactant in an endothermic reaction.
At constant pressure, raising the temperature of an exothermic reaction—think of 
this as adding heat—is similar to adding more product, causing the reaction to shift left. 
For example, the reaction of nitrogen with hydrogen to form ammonia is exothermic:
2 NH3(g)
3 H2(g)
N2(g)
Reaction shifts left.
 Smaller K
heat
+
+
Add heat
Raising the temperature of an equilibrium mixture of these three gases causes the reac-
tion to shift left, absorbing some of the added heat and forming less products and more 
reactants. Note that, unlike adding additional NH3 to the reaction mixture (which does 
not change the value of the equilibrium constant), changing the temperature does change 
the value of the equilibrium constant. The new equilibrium mixture will have more reac-
tants and fewer products and therefore a smaller value of K.
Conversely, lowering the temperature causes the reaction to shift right, releasing 
heat and producing more products because the value of K has increased:
2 NH3(g)
N2(g) + 3 H2(g)
Reaction shifts right.
Larger K
heat
+
Remove heat
In contrast, for an endothermic reaction, raising the temperature (adding heat) 
causes the reaction to shift right to absorb the added heat. For example, the following 
reaction is endothermic:
2 NO2(g)
heat
Reaction shifts right. 
Larger K
colorless
brown
N2O4(g) +
Add heat
In considering the effect of a change 
in temperature, we are assuming that 
the heat is added (or removed) at 
constant pressure.

▲ Figure 15.12  Le Châtelier’s Principle: The Effect of a Temperature Change   
Because the reaction is endothermic, raising the temperature causes a shift to the right, 
toward the formation of brown nO2.
Raising the temperature of an equilibrium mixture of these two gases causes the reaction 
to shift right, absorbing some of the added heat and producing more products because 
the value of K has increased. Because N2O4 is colorless and NO2 is brown, the effects of 
changing the temperature of this reaction are easily seen (Figure 15.12▲).
On the other hand, lowering the temperature (removing heat) of a reaction mixture 
of these two gases causes the reaction to shift left, releasing heat, forming less products, 
and lowering the value of K:
2 NO2(g)
N2O4(g) + heat
Reaction shifts left. 
Smaller K

Summarizing the Effect of a Temperature Change on Equilibrium:
In an exothermic chemical reaction, heat is a product.
▶
▶
Increasing the temperature causes an exothermic reaction to shift left (in the 
­direction of the reactants); the value of the equilibrium constant decreases.
▶
▶
Decreasing the temperature causes an exothermic reaction to shift right (in the 
­direction of the products); the value of the equilibrium constant increases.
In an endothermic chemical reaction, heat is a reactant.
▶
▶
Increasing the temperature causes an endothermic reaction to shift right (in the 
­direction of the products); the equilibrium constant increases.
▶
▶
Decreasing the temperature causes an endothermic reaction to shift left (in the 
­direction of the reactants); the equilibrium constant decreases.
Adding heat favors the endothermic 
direction. Removing heat favors the 
exothermic direction.

on Equilibrium
The following reaction is endothermic:
CaCO3(s) ∆CaO(s) + CO2(g)
What is the effect of increasing the temperature of the reaction mixture? Decreas-
ing the temperature?
Solution
Since the reaction is endothermic, we can think of heat as a reactant:
Heat + CaCO3(s) ∆CaO(s) + CO2(g)
Raising the temperature is like adding a reactant, causing the reaction to shift to 
the right. Lowering the temperature is equivalent to removing a reactant, causing 
the reaction to shift to the left.

Key Concepts
The Equilibrium Constant (15.1)
▶
▶The relative concentrations of the reactants and the products at 
equilibrium are expressed by the equilibrium constant, K.
▶
▶The equilibrium constant measures how far a reaction proceeds 
toward products: a large K (greater than 1) indicates a high con-
centration of products at equilibrium, and a small K (less than 1) 
indicates a low concentration of products at equilibrium.
Dynamic Equilibrium (15.2)
▶
▶Most chemical reactions are reversible; they can proceed in either 
the forward or the reverse direction.
▶
▶When a chemical reaction is in dynamic equilibrium, the rate of 
the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction, so the 
net concentrations of reactants and products do not change. How-
ever, this does not imply that the concentrations of the reactants 
and the products are equal at equilibrium.
The Equilibrium Constant Expression (15.3)
▶
▶The equilibrium constant expression is given by the law of mass 
action and is equal to the concentrations of the products, raised to 
their stoichiometric coefficients, divided by the concentrations of 
the reactants, raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.
▶
▶When the equation for a chemical reaction is reversed, multiplied, 
or added to another equation, K must be modified accordingly.
The Equilibrium Constant, K (15.4)
▶
▶The equilibrium constant can be expressed in terms of concen-
trations (Kc) or in terms of partial pressures (Kp). These two con-
stants are related by Equation 15.2. Concentration must always 
be expressed in units of molarity for Kc. Partial pressures must 
always be expressed in units of atmospheres for Kp.
States of Matter and the Equilibrium Constant (15.5)
▶
▶The equilibrium constant expression contains only partial pres-
sures or concentrations of reactants and products that exist as 
gases or solutes dissolved in solution. Pure liquids and solids are 
not included in the expression for the equilibrium constant.
Calculating K (15.6)
▶
▶We can calculate the equilibrium constant from equilibrium con-
centrations or partial pressures by substituting measured values 
into the expression for the equilibrium constant (as obtained 
from the law of mass action).
▶
▶In most cases, we can calculate the equilibrium concentrations of 
the reactants and products—and therefore the value of the equi-
librium constant—from the initial concentrations of the reac-
tants and products and the equilibrium concentration of just one 
reactant or product.

Chapter 15  Chemical Equilibrium
The Reaction Quotient, Q (15.7)
▶
▶The reaction quotient, Q, is the ratio of the concentrations (or 
partial pressures) of products raised to their stoichiometric coef-
ficients to the concentrations of reactants raised to their stoichio-
metric coefficients at any point in the reaction.
▶
▶Like K, Q can be expressed in terms of concentrations (Q c) or par-
tial pressures (Q p).
▶
▶At equilibrium, Q is equal to K; therefore, we can determine the 
direction in which a reaction proceeds by comparing Q to K. If 
Q 6 K, the reaction moves in the direction of the products; if 
Q 7 K, the reaction moves in the reverse direction.
Finding Equilibrium Concentrations (15.8)
▶
▶There are two general types of problems in which K is given and we 
can determine one (or more) equilibrium concentrations:
(1) We are given K and all but one equilibrium concentration.
(2) We are given K and only initial concentrations.
▶
▶We solve the first type by rearranging the law of mass action and 
substituting the given values.
▶
▶We solve the second type by creating an ICE table and using a vari-
able x to represent the change in concentration.
Le Châtelier’s Principle (15.9)
▶
▶When a system at equilibrium is disturbed—by a change in 
the amount of a reactant or product, a change in volume, or a 
change in temperature—the system shifts in the direction that 
minimizes the disturbance.

Data Interpretation and Analysis
Chemical Equilibrium on Venus
	111.	The atmosphere of Venus is cur-
rently composed of 96.5% car-
bon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, 
trace amounts of sulfur dioxide, 
and clouds of sulfuric acid. The 
average temperature on this 
planet is 740 K and the average 
pressure is 94 atm. ­Research 
suggests that, due to different 
­pressure and temperature con-
ditions, carbon dioxide may 
have existed in different states 
on Venus in the past. A phase 
diagram 
of 
carbon 
dioxide 
­(Figure a▶) can help estimate 
the state of carbon dioxide.

▲ Figure a  Phase Diagram of CO2. 
Because of the large quantities of CO2 on Venus, the con-
centration of CO2 in the atmosphere could depend on one or 
more equilibrium systems with carbonate ions in minerals. For 
example, carbon dioxide gas might react with calcium silicate 
(CaSiO3) according to the following equilibrium:
	
CaSiO3(s) + CO2(g) ∆CaCO3(s) + SiO2(s) (Reaction 1)
An alternative viewpoint suggests that the concentration of CO2 
gas in the atmosphere of Venus depends on the following 
­equilibrium:
MgSiO3(s) + CaCO3() + SiO2(s) ∆ CaMgSi2O6(s) + CO2(g)
(Reaction 2)
Temperature plays an important role in equilibrium sys-
tems. The graph in Figure b▶ plots temperature in units of Kel-
vin versus the log of the partial pressure of CO2 gas for each of 
the two possible reactions. The area marked as region 1 corre-
sponds to the equilibrium system for Reaction 1, whereas the 
area marked as region 2 corresponds to the equilibrium system 
for Reaction 2. 
For the questions that follow, choose a point in the middle 
of the colored band (which represents the range of possible 
­values). For example, according to the graph, on Earth, at a tem-
perature of 298 K, the log PCO2 = -3.90 for Reaction 2. This 
­corresponds to a partial pressure of 1.3 * 10 - 4 atm.
Use the information provided in the figures to answer the 
­following questions:
a.	 If the partial pressure of CO2 on Venus is 91 atm, calculate the 
equilibrium constant (Kp) for Reactions 1 and 2.
b.	 Determine the partial pressure of CO2 on Venus if the 
­temperature cooled from 750 K to 400 K using Reaction 1? Using 
Reaction 2? Choose values in the middle of colored bands of the 
graph in Figure b.
c.	 Refer to the phase diagram in Figure a. At what minimum 
­pressure can supercritical CO2  form?  If the pressure of the 
­Venusian atmosphere in the distant past was much higher than 
it is today, could supercritical carbon dioxide have existed on 
the surface of Venus?

Answers to Conceptual Connections
The Magnitude of the Equilibrium Contstant
15.1	 The equilibrium constant is largest for temperature T3 (because 
the reaction mixture has the most products relative to reac-
tants at that temperature).
Equilibrium Constants and Equilibrium Concentrations
15.2	 (b) The reaction mixture will contain [A] = 0.1 M and 
[B] = 1.0 M so that [B]>[A] = 10.
The Equilibrium Constant and the Chemical Equation
15.3	 (b) The reaction is reversed and divided through by two. 
Therefore, you invert the equilibrium constant and take the 
square root of the result. K = (1>0.010)1>2 = 10.
The Relationship between Kp and Kc
15.4	 (a) When a + b = c + d, the quantity ∆n is zero so that 
Kp = Kc(RT)0. Since (RT)0 is equal to 1, Kp = Kc.
Heterogeneous Equilibria, Kp, and Kc
15.5	 (b) Since ∆n for gaseous reactants and products is zero, 
Kp = Kc.
Q and K
15.6	 (c) Because N2O4 and NO2 are both in their standard states, 
they each have a partial pressure of 1.0 atm. Consequently, 
Q p = 1. Since Kp = 0.15, Q p 7 Kp, and the reaction proceeds 
to the left.
The x is small Approximation
15.7	 (a) The x is small approximation is most likely to apply to 
a reaction with a small equilibrium constant and an initial 
concentration of reactant that is not too small. The big-
ger the equilibrium constant and the smaller the initial 
­concentration of reactant, the less likely that the x is small 
approximation will apply.

▲ Milk of magnesia contains a 
base that can neutralize stomach 
acid and relieve heartburn.
I
n this chapter, we apply the equilibrium concepts learned in the previous chapter to 
acid–base phenomena. Acids are common in many foods, such as limes, lemons, and 
vinegar, and in a number of consumer products, such as toilet cleaners and batteries. 
Bases are less common in foods but are key ingredients in consumer products such as drain 
openers and antacids. We will examine three different models for acid–base behavior, all 
of which define that behavior differently. In spite of their differences, the three models co-
exist, each being useful at explaining a particular range of acid–base phenomena. We also 
examine how to calculate the acidity or basicity of solutions and define a useful scale, 
called the pH scale, to quantify acidity and basicity. These types of calculations often in-
volve solving the kind of equilibrium problems that we explored in Chapter 15.
	 16.1	 Heartburn
Heartburn is a painful burning sensation in the esophagus (the tube that joins the 
throat to the stomach) just below the chest. The pain is caused by hydrochloric acid 
(HCl), which the stomach excretes to kill microorganisms and to activate enzymes that 
break down food. Hydrochloric acid sometimes backs up out of the stomach and into 
the esophagus, a phenomenon called acid reflux. Recall from Section 4.8 that acids are 
substances that—by one definition that we elaborate on shortly—produce H+ ions in 
solution. When hydrochloric acid from the stomach comes in contact with the lining of 
the esophagus, the H+ ions irritate the tissues, resulting in the burning sensation. Some 
of the acid can work its way into the lower throat and even the mouth, producing pain 

724	
Chapter 16  Acids and Bases
in the throat and a sour taste (characteristic of acids) in the mouth. Almost everyone 
experiences heartburn at some time, most commonly after a large meal when the stom-
ach is full. Strenuous activity or lying in a horizontal position after a large meal increases 
the likelihood of stomach acid reflux and the resulting heartburn.
The simplest way to relieve mild heartburn is to swallow repeatedly. Saliva contains the 
bicarbonate ion (HCO3
-), which acts as a base and, when swallowed, neutralizes some of 
the acid in the esophagus. Later in this chapter, we will see how bicarbonate acts as a base. 
You can also treat heartburn with antacids such as Tums, milk of magnesia, or Mylanta. 
These over-the-counter medications contain more base than saliva does and therefore are 
effective at neutralizing esophageal acid. We look at the bases in these medicines more care-
fully later (see Chemistry and Medicine: What's in My Antacid? in Section 16.7).
For some people, heartburn becomes a chronic problem. Gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (GERD) is the medical condition associated with chronic heartburn. In patients 
with GERD, the band of muscles (called the esophageal sphincter) at the bottom of the 
esophagus just above the stomach does not close tightly enough, allowing stomach 
contents to leak back into the esophagus on a regular basis. Medical researchers have 
developed a wireless sensor to help diagnose and evaluate treatment of GERD. Using a 
tube that goes down through the throat, a physician attaches the sensor to tissues in 
the patient’s esophagus. The sensor reads pH—a measure of acidity that we discuss in 
Section 16.5—and transmits the readings to a recorder worn on the patient’s body. The 
patient goes about his or her normal activities for the next few days while the recorder 
monitors esophageal pH. The physician then reads the record of esophageal pH to make 
a diagnosis or evaluate treatment.
In this chapter, we examine acid and base behavior. Acids and bases are not only 
important to our health (as we have just seen), but are also found in many household 
products, foods, medicines, and of course in nearly every chemistry laboratory. Acid–base 
chemistry is central to much of biochemistry and molecular biology. The building blocks 
of proteins, for example, are acids (called amino acids) and the molecules that carry the 
genetic code in DNA are bases.
	 16.2	 The Nature of Acids and Bases
Acids have the following general properties: a sour taste, the ability to dissolve many 
metals, the ability to turn blue litmus paper red, and the ability to neutralize bases. 
Table 16.1 lists some common acids.
Bases were first defined in  
Section 4.8.
The bicarbonate ion neutralizes 
stomach acid according to the 
reaction: H+(aq) + HCO3
-(aq) ¡
H2O(l) + CO2(g).
The concentration of stomach acid, 
[H3O+], varies from about 0.01 to 
0.1 M.

You can find hydrochloric acid in most chemistry laboratories. In industry, it is used 
to clean metals, to prepare and process some foods, and to refine metal ores. As we dis-
cussed in Section 16.1, hydrochloric acid is also the main component of stomach acid.

Sulfuric acid and nitric acid are also common in the laboratory. They play major roles 
in the manufacture of fertilizers, explosives, dyes, and glues. Sulfuric acid, produced in 
larger quantities than any other industrial chemical, is used in most automobile batteries.

You can probably find acetic acid in your home—it is the active component of vine-

French words vin aigre, which means “sour wine.” Wine experts consider the presence of 
vinegar in wines a serious fault, since it makes the wine taste like salad dressing.

Bases have the following general properties: a bitter taste, a slippery feel, the ability to 
turn red litmus paper blue, and the ability to neutralize acids. Because of their bitterness, 
bases are less common in foods than are acids. Our aversion to the taste of bases is probably 
an evolutionary adaptation to warn us against alkaloids, organic bases found in plants 
that are often poisonous. (For example, the active component of hemlock—the poisonous 
plant that killed the Greek philosopher Socrates—is the alkaloid coniine.) Nonetheless, 
some foods, such as coffee and chocolate (especially dark chocolate), contain bitter flavors. 
Many people enjoy the bitterness, but only after acquiring the taste over time.
Bases feel slippery because they react with oils on the skin to form soap-like sub-
stances. Some household cleaning solutions, such as ammonia, are basic and have the 
characteristic slippery feel of a base. Bases turn red litmus paper blue; in the laboratory, 
litmus paper is routinely used to test the basicity of solutions.
Some common bases are listed in Table 16.2. You can find sodium hydroxide and 
potassium hydroxide in most chemistry laboratories. They are used in petroleum and 
cotton processing and in soap and plastic manufacturing. Sodium hydroxide is the 
active ingredient in products such as Drano that unclog drains. In many homes, you can 
find sodium bicarbonate in the medicine cabinet (it is an active ingredient in some ant-
acids) as well as in the kitchen (labeled as baking soda).
	 16.3	 Definitions of Acids and Bases
What are the key characteristics of the molecules and ions that exhibit acid and base 
behavior? In this chapter, we examine three different definitions: the Arrhenius defini-
tion, the Brønsted–Lowry definition, and the Lewis definition. Why three definitions, 
and which one is correct? As inorganic chemist and author James Huheey notes in the 
quotation that opens this chapter, no single definition is “correct.” Rather, each defini-
tion is useful in a given instance. We discuss the Lewis definition of acids and bases in 
Section 16.11; here we discuss the other two.
The Arrhenius Definition
In the 1880s, Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius (1859–1927) proposed the following 
molecular definitions of acids and bases:
Acid:  A substance that produces H+ ions in aqueous solution.
Base:  A substance that produces OH- ions in aqueous solution.
According to the Arrhenius definition, HCl is an acid because it produces  
H+ ions in solution (Figure 16.1◀):
HCl(aq) ¡ H+(aq) + Cl-(aq)
Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is a covalent compound and does not contain ions. However, 
in water it ionizes completely to form H +(aq) ions and Cl -(aq) ions. The H + ions are 
highly reactive. In aqueous solution, the H + ions bond to water to form H3O +:

Definitions of Acids and Bases

	
16.3  Definitions of Acids and Bases	
727
The H3O+ ion is the hydronium ion. In water, H+ ions always associate with H2O 
molecules to form hydronium ions and other associated species with the general for-
mula H(H2O)n
+. For example, an H+ ion can associate with two water molecules to 
form H(H2O)2
+, with three to form H(H2O)3
+, and so on. Chemists often use H+(aq) 
and H3O+(aq) interchangeably to mean the same thing—an H+ ion that has been sol-
vated (or dissolved) in water.
According to the Arrhenius definition, NaOH is a base because it produces OH- ions 
in solution (Figure 16.2▶):
NaOH(aq) ¡ Na+(aq) + OH-(aq)
NaOH is an ionic compound and therefore contains Na+ and OH- ions. When NaOH is 
added to water, it dissociates (breaks apart) into its component ions.
Under the Arrhenius definition, acids and bases combine to form water, neutraliz-
ing each other in the process:
H+(aq) + OH-(aq) ¡ H2O(l)
The Brønsted–Lowry Definition
A second, more widely applicable definition of acids and bases, the Brønsted–Lowry 
definition, was introduced in 1923. This definition focuses on the transfer of H + ions 
in an acid–base reaction. Since an H+ ion is a proton—a hydrogen atom without its 
electron—this definition focuses on the idea of a proton donor and a proton acceptor:
Acid:   proton (H+ ion) donor
Base:   proton (H+ ion) acceptor
According to this definition, HCl is an acid because, in solution, it donates a proton 
to water:
HCl(aq) + H2O(l) ¡ H3O+(aq) + Cl-(aq)
This definition clearly describes what happens to the H+ ion from an acid—it ­associates 
with a water molecule to form H3O+ (a hydronium ion). The Brønsted–Lowry definition 
also applies nicely to bases (such as NH3) that do not inherently contain OH- ions but still 
produce OH- ions in solution. According to the Brønsted–Lowry definition, NH3 is a base 
because it accepts a proton from water:
NH3(aq) + H2O(l) ∆NH4
+(aq) + OH-(aq)
According to the Brønsted–Lowry definition, acids (proton donors) and bases (pro-
ton acceptors) always occur together in an acid–base reaction. In the reaction between 
HCl and H2O, HCl is the proton donor (acid) and H2O is the proton acceptor (base):
HCl(aq)  +  H2O(l) ¡ H3O+(aq) + Cl-(aq)
	
acid	
base
	
(proton donor)

In the reaction between NH3 and H2O, H2O is the proton donor (acid) and NH3 is the 
proton acceptor (base):

+(aq) + OH-(aq)
	
base	
acid
	
(proton acceptor)

According to the Brønsted–Lowry definition, some substances—such as water in 
the previous two equations—can act as acids or bases. Substances that can act as acids or 
bases are amphoteric. Notice what happens when we reverse an equation representing 
a Brønsted–Lowry acid–base reaction:

	 16.4	 Acid Strength and the Acid Ionization 
Constant (Ka)
The strength of an electrolyte, first discussed in Section 4.5, depends on the extent of 
its dissociation into its component ions in solution. A strong electrolyte completely dis-
sociates into ions in solution, whereas a weak electrolyte only partially dissociates. We 
define strong and weak acids accordingly. A strong acid completely ionizes in solu-
tion, whereas a weak acid only partially ionizes. In other words, the strength of an acid 
depends on the equilibrium:
HA(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + A-(aq)
In the preceding equation, HA is a generic formula for an acid. If the equilibrium lies far to 
the right, the acid is strong—it completely ionizes. If the equilibrium lies to the left, the acid 
is weak—only a small percentage of the acid molecules ionize. Of course, the range of acid 
strength is continuous, but for most purposes, the categories of strong and weak are useful.
Strong Acids
Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is an example of a strong acid:
HCl(aq)
H2O(l)
+
H3O+(aq)
Cl−(aq)
+
Single arrow indicates
complete ionization.
An HCl solution contains virtually no intact HCl; the HCl has essentially all ionized to 
form H3O+(aq) and Cl-(aq) (Figure 16.4▼). A 1.0 M HCl solution has an H3O+ concentra-
tion of 1.0 M. Abbreviating the concentration of H3O+ as [H3O+], we say that a 1.0 M HCl 
solution has [H3O+] = 1.0 M.
Table 16.3 lists the six important strong acids. The first five acids in the table are 
monoprotic acids, acids containing only one ionizable proton. Sulfuric acid is an 
example of a diprotic acid, an acid containing two ionizable protons.
When HCl dissolves in water, it ionizes completely.

▲ Figure 16.5  Ionization of a Weak Acid  When HF dissolves in water, only a fraction

molecules.
Weak Acids
In contrast to HCl, HF is a weak acid, one that does not completely ionize in solution:
HF(aq)
H2O(l)
+
H3O+(aq)
F−(aq)
+
Equilibrium arrow indicates
partial ionization.
An HF solution contains a large number of intact (or un-ionized) HF molecules; it 
also contains some H3O+(aq) and F-(aq) (Figure 16.5▲). In other words, a 1.0 M HF 
solution has an [H3O+] that is much less than 1.0 M because only some of the  
HF molecules ionize to form H3O+.
The degree to which an acid is strong or weak depends on the attraction between 
the anion of the acid (the conjugate base) and the hydrogen ion, relative to the attrac-
tions of these ions to water. Recall that HA is a generic formula for an acid. The degree to 
which the following reaction proceeds in the forward direction depends on the strength 
of the attraction between H+ and A-:
HA(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + A-(aq)
	
acid	
conjugate base
If the attraction between H+ and A- is weak, then the reaction favors the forward 
­direction and the acid is strong. If the attraction between H+ and A- is strong, then the 
reaction favors the reverse direction and the acid is weak, as shown in Figure 16.6◀.
For example, in HCl, the conjugate base (Cl-) has a relatively weak attraction to H+—
the reverse reaction does not occur to any significant extent. In HF, on the other hand, the 
conjugate base (F-) has a greater attraction to H+—the reverse reaction occurs to a signifi-
cant degree. In general, the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base and vice versa. If the 
forward reaction (that of the acid) has a high tendency to occur, then the reverse reaction 
(that of the conjugate base) has a low tendency to occur. Table 16.4 lists some common 
weak acids.
Notice that two of the weak acids in Table 16.4 are diprotic, meaning that they have 
two ionizable protons, and one is a triprotic acid (three ionizable protons). We discuss 
polyprotic acids in more detail in Section 16.9.

Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) (triprotic)
The terms strong and weak acids 
are often confused with the terms 
concentrated and dilute acids. Can 
you articulate the difference between 
these terms?
Alternatively, we can write the 
formulas for acetic acid and formic 
acid as CH3COOH and HCOOH, 
respectively, to indicate that in these 
compounds the only H that ionizes is 
the one attached to an oxygen atom.

The Acid Ionization Constant (Ka)
We quantify the relative strength of a weak acid with the acid ionization constant (Ka), 
which is the equilibrium constant for the ionization reaction of the weak acid. As we saw in 
Section 15.3, for the two equivalent reactions:
 HA(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + A-(aq)
 HA(aq) ∆H+(aq) + A-(aq)
the equilibrium constant is:
Ka = [H3O+][A-]
[HA]
= [H+][A-]
[HA]
Since [H3O+] is equivalent to [H+], both forms of the expression are equal. Although 
the ionization constants for all weak acids are relatively small (otherwise the acid would 
not be a weak acid), they do vary in magnitude. The smaller the constant, the less the 
acid ionizes, and the weaker the acid. Table 16.5 lists the acid ionization constants for a 
number of common weak acids in order of decreasing acid strength. Appendix II C con-
tains a more complete list.

	 16.5	 Autoionization of Water and pH
We saw previously that water acts as a base when it reacts with HCl and as an acid when 
it reacts with NH3:

Water is amphoteric; it can act as either an acid or a base. Even when pure, water acts 
as an acid and a base with itself, a process called autoionization:
Acid
(proton donor)
Base
(proton acceptor)
Water acting as both
an acid and a base
H2O(l) + H2O(l)
H3O+(aq) + OH−(aq)
We can write the autoionization reaction as:
H2O(l) ∆H+(aq) + OH-(aq)
The equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is the product of the  
concentration of the two ions:
Kw = [H3O+][OH-] = [H+][OH-]

	
16.5  Autoionization of Water and pH	
733
This equilibrium constant is called the ion product constant for water (Kw) (some-
times called the dissociation constant for water). At 25 °C, Kw = 1.0 * 10 - 14. In pure 
water, since H2O is the only source of these ions, the concentrations of H3O+ and OH- 
are equal, and the solution is neutral. Since the concentrations of the two ions are 
equal, we can easily calculate them from Kw.
[H3O+] = [OH-] = 2Kw = 1.0 * 10 - 7   (in pure water at 25 °C)
As you can see, in pure water, the concentrations of H3O+ and OH- are very small 
(1.0 * 10 - 7 M) at room temperature.
An acidic solution contains an acid that creates additional H3O+ ions, causing 
[H3O+] to increase. However, the ion product constant still applies:
[H3O+][OH-] = Kw = 1.0 * 10 - 14
The concentration of H3O + times the concentration of OH - is always 1.0 * 10 - 14 at 25 °C. If 
[H3O+] increases, then [OH-] must decrease for the ion product constant to remain 
1.0 * 10 - 14. For example, if [H3O+] = 1.0 * 10 - 3, then we can find [OH-] by solving 
the ion product constant expression for [OH-] :
 (1.0 * 10 - 3) [OH-] = 1.0 * 10 - 14
 [OH-] = 1.0 * 10 - 14
1.0 * 10 - 3 = 1.0 * 10 - 11 M
In an acidic solution [H3O+] 7 [OH-].
A basic solution contains a base that creates additional OH- ions, causing [OH-] 
to increase and [H3O+] to decrease, but again the ion product constant still applies. ­Suppose 
[OH-] = 1.0 * 10 - 2; we can find [H3O+] by solving the ion product constant ­expression 
for [H3O+]:
 [H3O +](1.0 * 10 - 2) = 1.0 * 10-14
 [H3O +] = 1.0 * 10 - 14 
1.0 * 10 - 2 
= 1.0 * 10 - 12 M
In a basic solution [OH-] 7 [H3O+].
Notice that changing [H3O+] in an aqueous solution produces an inverse change in 
[OH-] and vice versa.
Summarizing Kw:
▶
▶
A neutral solution contains [H3O+] = [OH-] = 1.0 * 10 - 7 M (at 25 °C).
▶
▶
An acidic solution contains [H3O+] 7 [OH-].
▶
▶
A basic solution contains [OH-] 7 [H3O+].
▶
▶
In all aqueous solutions both H3O+ and OH- are present, with [H3O+][OH-] = Kw =
1.0 * 10 - 14 (at 25 °C).
The ion product constant Kw depends 
on temperature. For all calculations 
in this book, assume 25 °C unless 
otherwise noted.

The pH Scale: A Way to Quantify Acidity and Basicity
The pH scale is a compact way to specify the acidity of a solution. We define pH as the 
negative of the log of the hydronium ion concentration:
pH = -log[H3O+]
A solution with [H3O+] = 1.0 * 10-3 M (acidic) has a pH of:
 pH = -log[H3O+]
 = -log(1.0 * 10-3)
 = -(-3.00)
 = 3.00
Notice that we report the pH to two decimal places in this example. This is because only 
the numbers to the right of the decimal point are significant in a logarithm. Because our 
original value for the concentration had two significant figures, the log of that number 
has two decimal places:
log 1.0 ×
=
10−3
3.00
2 significant digits
2 decimal places
If the original number has three significant digits, we report the log to three decimal 
places:
log 1.00×
=
10−3
3.000
3 significant digits
3 decimal places
A solution with [H3O+] = 1.0 * 10-7 M (neutral at 25 °C) has a pH of:
 pH = -log[H3O+]
 = -log(1.0 * 10-7)
 = -(-7.00)
 = 7.00
In general, at 25 °C:
• pH 6 7 The solution is acidic.
• pH 7 7 The solution is basic.
• pH = 7 The solution is neutral.
Table 16.6 lists the pH of some common substances. As we discussed in Section 16.2, 
many foods, especially fruits, are acidic and have low pH values. Relatively few foods are 
basic. The foods with the lowest pH values are limes and lemons, and they are among 
the sourest. Because the pH scale is a logarithmic scale, a change of 1 pH unit corresponds 
to a 10-fold change in H3O+ concentration (Figure 16.7▶). For example, a lime with a pH 
of 2.0 is 10 times more acidic than a plum with a pH of 3.0 and 100 times more acidic 
than a cherry with a pH of 4.0.
The log of a number is the 
exponent to which 10 must be 
raised to obtain that number. 
Thus, log 101 = 1; log 102 = 2; 
log 10-1 = -1;  log 10-2 = -2, etc. 
(see Appendix I).
Table 16.6  The pH of 
Some Common Substances
When we take the log of a quantity, 
the result has the same number 
of decimal places as the number 
of significant figures in the original 
quantity.
Concentrated acid solutions can 
have negative pH. For example, if 
[H3O+] = 2.0 m, the pH is -0.30.

Example 16.3	
Calculating pH from [H3O+] or [OH-]
Calculate the pH of each solution at 25 °C and indicate whether the solution is acidic or basic.
(a)	 [H3O+] = 1.8 * 10-4 M	
(b)	 [OH-] = 1.3 * 10-2 M
Solution
(a)	 To calculate pH, substitute the given [H3O+] into the pH equation.
Since pH 6 7, this solution is acidic.
 pH = -log[H3O+]
 = -log(1.8 * 10-4)
 = -(-3.74)
 = 3.74 (acidic)
(b)	 First use Kw to find [H3O+] from [OH-].
Then substitute [H3O+] into the pH expression to find pH.
Since pH 7 7, this solution is basic.
[H3O+][OH-] = Kw = 1.0 * 10-14
[H3O+](1.3 * 10-2) = 1.0 * 10-14
[H3O+] = 1.0 * 10-14
1.3 * 10-2 = 7.7 * 10-13 M
 pH = -log[H3O+]
 = -log(7.7 * 10-13)
 = -(-12.11)
 = 12.11 (basic)
For Practice 16.3  Calculate the pH of each solution and indicate whether the solution is acidic or basic.
(a)	 [H3O+] = 9.5 * 10-9 M	
(b)	 [OH-] = 7.1 * 10-3 M
▲ Figure 16.7  The pH Scale  An increase of 1 on the pH scale corresponds to a factor of 10 decrease in [H3O+].
pOH and Other p Scales
The pOH scale is analogous to the pH scale but is defined with respect to [OH-] instead 
of [H3O+]:
pOH = -log[OH-]
Example 16.4	
Calculating [H3O+] from pH
Calculate [H3O+] for a solution with a pH of 4.80.
Solution
To find [H3O+] from pH, start with the equation that defines pH. Substitute the 
given value of pH and then solve for [H3O+]. Since the given pH value was reported 
to two decimal places, report the [H3O+] to two significant figures. (Remember that 
10 log  x = x (see Appendix I). Some calculators use an inv log key to represent this 
function.)
 pH = -log[H3O+]
 4.80 = -log[H3O+]
 -4.80 =  log[H3O+]
 10-4.80 = 10 log[H3O+]
 10-4.80 = [H3O+]
 [H3O+] = 1.6 *  10-5 M
For Practice 16.4  Calculate [H3O+] for a solution with a pH of 8.37.

Chemistry and Medicine | Ulcers
A
n ulcer is a lesion on the wall of the stomach or small intestine. Under normal cir-
cumstances, a thick layer of mucus lines the stomach wall and protects it from 
the hydrochloric acid and other gastric juices in the stomach. If that mucous layer is 
damaged, however, stomach juices come in direct contact with the stomach wall and 
begin to digest it, creating an ulcer. The main symptom of an ulcer is a burning or 
gnawing pain in the stomach.
Acidic drugs, such as aspirin, and acidic foods, such as citrus fruits and pickling fluids, 
irritate ulcers. When consumed, these substances increase the acidity of the stomach juic-
es, exacerbating the irritation to the stomach wall. On the other hand, antacids—which 
contain bases—relieve ulcers. Common antacids include Tums and milk of magnesia.
The causes of ulcers are manifold. For many years, a stressful lifestyle and a rich 
diet were blamed. More recent research, however, has shown that a bacterial infection of 
the stomach lining is responsible for many ulcers. (The 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or 
Medicine was awarded to Australians Barry J. Marshall and J. Robin Warren, for their discovery of the bacterial cause of ulcers.) 
Long-term use of some over-the-counter pain relievers, such as aspirin, is also believed to produce ulcers.
Q u e s t i o n
Which dessert is less likely to irritate an ulcer, key lime pie or meringue (made of egg whites)?
▲ An ulcer is a lesion in the stomach 
wall.
A solution with an [OH-] of 1.0 * 10-3 M (basic) has a pOH of 3.00. On the pOH 
scale, a pOH less than 7 is basic and a pOH greater than 7 is acidic. A pOH of 7 is neutral 
(Figure 16.8▲). We can derive a relationship between pH and pOH at 25 °C from the 
expression for Kw:
[H3O+][OH-] = 1.0 * 10-14
Taking the log of both sides, we get:
 
 log([H3O+][OH-]) = log(1.0 * 10-14)
 log[H3O+] + log[OH-] = -14.00
 -log[H3O+] - log[OH-] = 14.00
pH + pOH = 14.00
The sum of pH and pOH is always equal to 14.00 at 25 °C. Therefore, a solution with a pH 
of 3 has a pOH of 11.
Another common p scale is the pKa scale defined as:
pKa = -log Ka
The pKa of a weak acid is another way to quantify its strength. The smaller the pKa, the 
stronger the acid. For example, chlorous acid, with a Ka of 1.1 * 10-2, has a pKa of 1.96; 
and formic acid, with a Ka of 1.8 * 10-4, has a pKa of 3.74 (See Table 16.5).

737
	 16.6	 Finding the [H3o+] and pH of Strong 
and Weak Acid Solutions
A solution containing a strong or weak acid has two potential sources of H3O+: the ion-
ization of the acid itself and the autoionization of water. If we let HA be a strong or weak 
acid, the ionization equations are:
HA(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + A-(aq)  
 Strong or Weak Acid
H2O(l) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + OH-(aq)   Kw = 1.0 * 10-14
Except in extremely dilute acid solutions, the autoionization of water contributes a neg-
ligibly small amount of H3O+ compared to the ionization of the strong or weak acid. 
Recall from Section 16.5 that autoionization in pure water at 25 °C produces an H3O+ 
concentration of 1.0 * 10-7 M. In a strong or weak acid solution, the additional H3O+ 
from the acid causes the autoionization of water equilibrium to shift left (as described by 
Le Châtelier’s principle). Consequently, in most strong or weak acid solutions, the auto-
ionization of water produces even less H3O+ than in pure water and can be ignored. 
Therefore we can focus exclusively on the amount of H3O+ produced by the acid.
Strong Acids
Because strong acids, by definition, completely ionize in solution, and because we can (in 
nearly all cases) ignore the contribution of the autoionization of water, the concentration 
of H3O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the concentration of the strong acid. For example, a 
0.10 M HCl solution has an H3O+ concentration of 0.10 M and a pH of 1.00:
0.10 M HCl 1 [H3O+] = 0.10 M 1 pH = -log(0.10) = 1.00
Weak Acids
Finding the pH of a weak acid solution is more complicated because the concentration 
of H3O+ is not equal to the concentration of the weak acid. For example, if we make a 
solution of 0.10 M HCl (a strong acid) and a solution of 0.10 M acetic acid (a weak acid) 
in the laboratory and measure the pH of each, we get the following results:
0.10 M HCl              
 pH = 1.00
0.10 M HC2H3O2               pH = 2.87
The pH of the acetic acid solution is higher (it is less acidic) because acetic acid only 
partially ionizes. Calculating the [H3O+] formed by the ionization of a weak acid requires 
solving an equilibrium problem similar to those in Chapter 15. Consider, for example, a 
0.10 M solution of the generic weak acid HA with an acid ionization constant Ka. Since 
we can ignore the contribution of the autoionization of water, we only have to deter-
mine the concentration of H3O+ formed by the following equilibrium:
HA(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + A-(aq)   Ka
We can summarize the initial conditions, the changes, and the equilibrium 
­conditions in the following ICE table:

The initial H3O+ concentration is listed as approximately zero because of the negligi-
bly small contribution of H3O+ due to the autoionization of water (discussed previously). 
The variable x represents the amount of HA that ionizes. As discussed in Chapter 15, each 
equilibrium concentration is the sum of the two entries above it in the ICE table. In order 
ICE tables were first introduced in 
Section 15.6. The reactant H2O(l) 
is a pure liquid and is therefore not 
included either in the equilibrium 
constant or in the ICE table (see 
Section 15.5).
The only exceptions would be 
extremely dilute (610-5 m) strong 
acid solutions.
Finding the [H3O+] and pH 
of Strong and Weak Acid 
­Solutions

738	
Chapter 16  Acids and Bases
to find the equilibrium concentration of H3O+, we must find the value of the variable x. 
We can use the equilibrium expression to set up an equation in which x is the only 
variable:
 Ka = [H3O+][A-]
[HA]
 =
x2
0.10 - x
As is often the case with equilibrium problems, we arrive at a quadratic equation in x, 
which we can solve using the quadratic formula (see Appendix IC). However, in many 
cases we can apply the x is small approximation (first discussed in Section 15.8). In 
Examples 16.5 and 16.6, we examine the general procedure for solving weak acid equilib-
rium problems. In both of these examples, the x is small approximation works well. In 
Example 16.7, we solve a problem in which the x is small approximation does not work. 
In such cases, we can solve the quadratic equation explicitly, or apply the method of suc-
cessive approximations (also discussed in Section 15.8). Finally, in Example 16.8, we 
work a problem in which we find the equilibrium constant of a weak acid from its pH.

4.	 Substitute the expressions 
for the equilibrium concen-
trations (from step 3) into 
the ­expression for the acid 
­ionization constant (Ka).
In many cases, you can make the 
approximation that x is small (as dis-
cussed in Section 15.8). Substitute 
the value of the acid ionization 
constant (from Table 16.5) into 
the Ka expression and solve for x.
Confirm that the x is small 
­approximation is valid by 
­calculating the ratio of x to the 
number it was subtracted from 
in the approximation. The ratio 
should be less than 0.05 (or 5%).

Therefore the approximation is valid 
(but barely so).
5.	 Determine [H3O +] from the 
calculated value of x and 
­calculate the pH if necessary.
[H3O+] = 7.0 * 10-6 M
(pH was not asked for in this 
problem.)
 [H3O+] = 9.6 * 10-3 M
 pH = -log [H3O+]
 = -log(9.6 * 10-3)
 = 2.02
6.	 Check your answer by 
­substituting the calculated 
equilibrium values into the 
acid ionization expression. The 
calculated value of Ka should match 
the given value of Ka. Note that 
rounding errors and the x is small 
approximation may result in a dif-
ference in the least significant digit 
when comparing values of Ka.
 Ka = [H3O+][CN-]
[HCN]

Determine the H3O+ concentration from the calculated value of

Chapter 16  Acids and Bases
Percent Ionization of a Weak Acid
We can quantify the ionization of a weak acid according to the percentage of acid mole-
cules that actually ionizes. We define the percent ionization of a weak acid as the ratio 
of the ionized acid concentration to the initial acid concentration, multiplied by 100%:
Percent ionization = concentration of ionized acid
initial concentration of acid
* 100% =
[H3O+]equil
[HA]init
* 100%
Since the concentration of ionized acid is equal to the H3O+ concentration at equi-
librium (for a monoprotic acid), we can use [H3O+]equil and [HA]init in the formula to cal-
culate the percent ionization. For example, in Example 16.6, we found that a 
0.200 M HNO2 solution contains 9.6 * 10-3 M H3O+. The 0.200 M HNO2 solution 
therefore has the following percent ionization:
 % ionization =
[H3O+]equil
[HA]init
* 100%
 = 9.6 * 10-3  M
0.200 M
* 100%
 = 4.8%
As you can see, the percent ionization is relatively small. In this case, even though HNO2 
has the second largest Ka in Table 16.5, fewer than 5 molecules out of 100 ionize. For 
most other weak acids (with smaller Ka values) the percent ionization is even less.
In Example 16.9, we calculate the percent ionization of a more concentrated HNO2 
solution. In the example, notice that the calculated H3O+ concentration is much greater 
(as we would expect for a more concentrated solution), but the percent ionization is actu-
ally smaller.

Finding the Percent Ionization of a Weak Acid

Solution
To find the percent ionization, you must find the 
­equilibrium concentration of H3O+. Follow the procedure 
in Example 16.5, shown in condensed form here.

We can now compare the results of Examples 16.6 and 16.9. From the table shown 
here, we can see that the more concentrated HNO2 solution has a lower percent ioniza-
tion. This trend applies to all weak acid solutions.

Summarizing [H3O+] and Percent Ionization:
▶
▶
The equilibrium H3O+ concentration of a weak acid increases with increasing ­initial 
­concentration of the acid.
▶
▶
The percent ionization of a weak acid decreases with increasing concentration of the 
acid.
In other words, as the concentration of a weak acid solution increases, the concentration of 
the hydronium ion also increases, but the increase is not linear. The H3O+ concentration 
increases less than the concentration of the acid because as the acid concentration 
increases, a smaller fraction of weak acid molecules ionize.
We can understand this behavior by analogy with Le Châtelier’s principle. Consider 
the following weak acid ionization equilibrium:
HA(aq) ∆H+(aq) + A-(aq)
	
1 mol dissolved particles	
2 mol dissolved particles
If we dilute a weak acid solution initially at equilibrium, the system (according to  
Le Châtelier’s principle) responds to minimize the disturbance. The equilibrium shifts to 
the right because the right side of the equation contains more particles in solution (2 mol 
versus 1 mol) than the left side. If the system shifts to the right, the percent ionization is 
greater in the more dilute solution, which is what we observe.

(b)	 0.500 M HC2H3O2
(c)	 0.0100 M HC2H3O2
Mixtures of Acids
Finding the pH of a mixture of acids may seem difficult at first. However, in many cases, 
the relative strengths of the acids in the mixture allow us to neglect the weaker acid and 
focus only on the stronger one. Here, we consider two possible acid mixtures: a strong 
acid with a weak acid and a weak acid with another weak acid.
A Strong Acid and a Weak Acid
Consider a mixture that is 0.10 M in HCl and 0.10 M in HCHO2. There are three sources 
of H3O+ ions: the strong acid (HCl), the weak acid (HCHO2), and the autoionization of 
water:
 HCl(aq) + H2O(l) ¡ H3O+(aq) + Cl-(aq)  
 Strong
 HCHO2(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + CHO2
-(aq)   Ka = 1.8 * 10-4
 H2O(l) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + OH-(aq)  
 Kw = 1.0 * 10-14
Since HCl is strong, we know that it completely ionizes to produce a significant concen-
tration of H3O+(0.10 M). The H3O+ formed by HCl then suppresses the formation of 
additional H3O+ formed by the ionization of HCHO2 or the autoionization of water. In 
other words, according to Le Châtelier’s principle, the formation of H3O+ by the strong 
acid causes the weak acid to ionize even less than it would in the absence of the strong 
acid. To see this clearly, we calculate [H3O+] and [CHO2
-] in this solution.

744	
Chapter 16  Acids and Bases
In an initial estimate of [H3O+], we can neglect the contribution of HCHO2 and H2O. 
The concentration of H3O+ is then equal to the initial concentration of HCl:
[H3O+] = [HCl] = 0.10 M
To find [CHO2
-] we must solve an equilibrium problem. However, the initial 
­concentration of H3O+ in this case is not negligible (as it has been in all the other weak 
acid equilibrium problems that we have worked so far) because HCl has formed a signifi-
cant amount of H3O+. The concentration of H3O+ formed by HCl becomes the initial 
concentration of H3O+ in the ICE table for HCHO2 as shown here:
HCHO2(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + CHO2

We then use the equilibrium expression to set up an equation in which x is the only 
variable:
 Ka = [H3O+][CHO2
-]
[HCHO2]
 = (0.10 + x)x
0.10 - x
Since the equilibrium constant is small relative to the initial concentration of the acid, 
we can make the x is small approximation:
 Ka = (0.10 + x)x
0.10 - x
 1.8 * 10-4 = (0.10)x
0.10
 x = 1.8 * 10-4
Checking the x is small approximation:
1.8 * 10-4 
0.10
* 100% = 0.18%
We find that the approximation is valid. Therefore, [CHO2
-] = 1.8 * 10-4 M. We can 
now see that we can completely ignore the ionization of the weak acid (HCHO2) in 
calculating [H3O+] for the mixture. The contribution to the concentration of H3O+ by 
the weak acid must necessarily be equal to the concentration of CHO2
- that we just 
calculated (because of the stoichiometry of the ionization reaction). Therefore, we 
have the following contributions to [H3O+]:
HCl contributes 0.10 M
HCHO2 contributes 1.8 * 10-4 M or 0.00018 M
Total [H3O+] =  0.10 M + 0.00018 M = 0.10 M
As we can see, since the significant figure rules for addition limit the answer to two 
decimal places, the amount of H3O+ contributed by HCHO2 is completely negligible. 
The amount of H3O+ contributed by the autoionization of water is even smaller and 
therefore similarly negligible.
A Mixture of Two Weak Acids
When two weak acids are mixed, we again have three potential sources of H3O+ to con-
sider: each of the two weak acids and the autoionization of water. However, if the values 
of Ka for the two weak acids are sufficiently different in magnitude (if they differ by more 
than a factor of several hundred), then as long as the concentrations of the two acids are 
similar in magnitude (or the concentration of the stronger one is greater than that of the 
weaker), we can assume that the weaker acid will not make a significant contribution to 

the concentration of H3O+. We make this assumption for the same reason that we made 
a similar assumption for a mixture of a strong acid and a weak one: the H3O+ formed 
by the stronger acid suppresses the ionization of the weaker one, in accordance with  
Le Châtelier’s principle. Example 16.10 shows how to calculate the concentration of 
H3O+ in a mixture of two weak acids.
Example 16.10	
Mixtures of Weak Acids
Find the pH of a mixture that is 0.300 M in HF and 0.100 M in HClO.
Solution
The three possible sources of H3O+ ions are HF, 
HClO, and H2O. Write the ionization equations 
for the three sources and their corresponding 
equilibrium constants. Since the equilibrium 
constant for the ionization of HF is about 
24,000 times larger than that for the ionization 
of HClO, the contribution of HF to [H3O+] is by 
far the greatest. You can therefore just calculate 
the [H3O+] formed by HF and neglect the other 
two potential sources of H3O+.
HF(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + F-(aq)

ionization constant (from Table 16.5) into the 
Ka expression and solve for x.
Confirm that the x is small approximation is 
valid by calculating the ratio of x to the number

	 16.7	 Base Solutions
We have seen that bases are solutions that produce OH - in solution (Arrhenius defini-
tion) or accept protons (Brønsted–Lowry definition). In analogy to acids, which can be 
strong or weak, bases can also be strong or weak.
Strong Bases
Just as we define a strong acid as one that completely ionizes in solution, analogously 
we define a strong base as a base that completely dissociates in solution. NaOH, for 
example, is a strong base:
NaOH(aq) ¡ Na+(aq) + OH-(aq)
An NaOH solution contains no intact NaOH—it has all dissociated to form Na+(aq) and 
OH-(aq) (Figure 16.9▼). In other words, a 1.0 M NaOH solution has [OH-] = 1.0 M and 
[Na+] = 1.0 M. Table 16.7 lists the common strong bases.

Calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2]

Barium hydroxide [Ba(OH)2]
As we can see in the table, most strong bases are group 1A or group 2A metal hydrox-
ides. The group 1A metal hydroxides are highly soluble in water and can form concen-
trated base solutions. The group 2A metal hydroxides, however, are only slightly soluble, 
a useful property for some applications (see Chemistry and Medicine: What’s in My Ant-
acid? in this section). Notice that the general formula for the group 2A metal hydroxides 
is M(OH)2. When they dissolve in water, they produce 2 mol of OH- per mole of the 
base. For example, Sr(OH)2 dissociates as follows:
Sr(OH)2(aq) ¡ Sr2 +(aq) + 2 OH-(aq)
Unlike diprotic acids, which ionize in two steps, bases containing two OH- ions dissoci-
ate in one step.
Weak Bases
The behavior of a weak base is analogous to that of a weak acid. Unlike strong bases 
that contain OH- and dissociate in water, the most common weak bases produce OH- 
by accepting a proton from water, ionizing water to form OH- according to the general 
equation:
B(aq) + H2O(l) ∆BH+(aq) + OH-(aq)
In this equation, B is a generic symbol for a weak base. Ammonia, for example, ionizes 
water as follows:
NH3(aq) + H2O(l) ∆NH4
+(aq) + OH-(aq)

The double arrow indicates that the ionization is not complete. An NH3 solution con-
tains mostly NH3 with only some NH4
+ and OH- (Figure 16.10▲). A 1.0 M NH3 solution 
will have [OH-] 6 1.0 M.
The extent of ionization of a weak base is quantified with the base ionization 
constant, Kb. For the general reaction in which a weak base ionizes water, we define 
Kb as follows:
B(aq) + H2O(l) ∆BH+(aq) + OH-(aq)  Kb = [BH+][OH-]
[B]
By analogy with Ka, the smaller the value of Kb, the weaker the base. Table 16.8 lists some 
common weak bases, their ionization reactions, and values for Kb. Appendix IIC contains 
a more complete table. We can also apply the “p” scale to Kb, so that pKb = -log Kb.
All but two of the weak bases listed in Table 16.8 are either ammonia or an amine, 
which we can think of as ammonia with one or more hydrocarbon groups substituted 
for one or more hydrogen atoms. All of these bases have a nitrogen atom with a lone pair 
(Figure 16.11▶). This lone pair acts as the proton acceptor that makes the substance a 
base, as shown in the reactions for ammonia and methylamine:

Finding the [oH−] and pH of Basic Solutions
Finding the [OH-] and pH of a strong base solution is relatively straightforward, as 
shown in Example 16.11. As we did in calculating the [H3O+] in strong acid solutions, 
we can neglect the contribution of the autoionization of water to the [OH-] and focus 
solely on the strong base itself.
Example 16.11	
Finding the [OH−] and pH of a Strong Base Solution
Determine the OH- concentration and pH in each solution.
(a)	 0.225 M KOH	
(b)	 0.0015 M Sr(OH)2
Solution
(a)	 Since KOH is a strong base, it completely dissociates into K+ 
and OH- in solution. The concentration of OH- is therefore the 
same as the given concentration of KOH.
Use this concentration and Kw to find [H3O+].
Then substitute [H3O+] into the pH expression to find the pH.
KOH(aq) ¡ K+(aq) + OH-(aq)
[OH-] = 0.225 M
[H3O+][OH-] = Kw = 1.0 * 10-14
[H3O+](0.225) = 1.0 * 10-14
[H3O+] = 4.44 * 10-14 M
 pH = -log[H3O+]
 = -log(4.44 * 10-14)
 = 13.35
(b)	 Since Sr(OH)2 is a strong base, 1 mol of Sr(OH)2 completely 
dissociates into 1 mol of Sr2 + and 2 mol of OH- in solution. The 
concentration of OH- is therefore twice the given concentra-
tion of Sr(OH)2.
Use this concentration and Kw to find [H3O+].
Substitute [H3O+] into the pH expression to find the pH.
Sr(OH)2(aq) ¡ Sr2 +(aq) + 2 OH-(aq)
 [OH-] = 2(0.0015) M
 = 0.0030 M
[H3O+][OH-] = Kw = 1.0 * 10-14
[H3O+](0.0030) = 1.0 * 10-14
[H3O+] = 3.3 * 10-12 M
 pH = -log[H3O+]
 = -log(3.3 * 10-12)
 = 11.48
For Practice 16.11  Find the [OH-] and pH of a 0.010 M Ba(OH)2 solution.
Finding the [OH-] and pH of a weak base solution is analogous to finding the [H3O+] 
and pH of a weak acid. Similarly, we neglect the contribution of the autoionization of 
water to the [OH-] and focus solely on the weak base itself. We find the contribution of 
the weak base by preparing an ICE table showing the relevant concentrations of all species 
and then use the base ionization constant expression to find the [OH-]. Example 16.12 
demonstrates how to find the [OH-] and pH of a weak base solution.

Chemistry and Medicine | What’s in My Antacid?
I
n the opening section of this chapter, we discussed 
­heartburn and its treatment with antacids. Some common 
antacids and their active ingredients include the following:
Amphogel
al(OH)3
Milk of magnesia
mg(OH)2
Maalox
mg(OH)2 and al(OH)3
Mylanta
mg(OH)2 and al(OH)3
Tums
CaCO3
We categorize antacids into three main groups: calcium-
based, magnesium-based, and aluminum-based. Calcium-
based antacids may cause acid rebound—which means that, 
although they initially relieve heartburn, they can also cause 
the stomach to produce more acid, resulting in a quick return 
of the symptoms. Aluminum- and magnesium-based antacids 
do not cause acid rebound but have downsides of their own. 
Aluminum-based antacids tend to cause constipation, and 
magnesium-based ones tend to cause diarrhea. (In fact, milk 
of magnesia is sometimes used as a laxative.) A person who 
takes repeated doses of these antacids should alternate 
­between the two or choose a product that contains both.
Notice the absence of group 1A metal hydroxides, such 
as KOH or NaOH, in the list of antacids. Why are those sub-
stances—which are completely soluble and act as strong 
bases—not used in antacids? Because a solution that con-
tains sufficient KOH or NaOH to neutralize stomach acid 
would also burn the mouth and throat. In contrast, mg(OH)2 
and al(OH)3 are only slightly soluble. Therefore liquid antacids 
containing these are actually suspensions of mg(OH)2 and 
al(OH)3—they are heterogeneous mixtures in which the solid 
is finely divided into the liquid. As a result, the concentration 
of OH- in these suspensions is relatively small compared to 
what it would be with a group 1A metal hydroxide.
▶ Antacids contain a 
variety of bases that 
effectively neutralize 
excess stomach acid.
Initially, it might seem as though the relatively lower OH- 
concentration would make the antacid much less effective. 
However, the solid mg(OH)2 or al(OH)3 continues to dissolve 
as the OH- neutralizes stomach acid. For example, a suspen-
sion of magnesium hydroxide contains solid mg(OH)2 in 
­equilibrium with dissolved mg2 + and OH- ions:
mg(OH)2(s) ∆mg2 +(aq) + 2 OH-(aq)
As stomach acid is neutralized, OH- is used up, and the 
­equilibrium shifts to the right providing additional OH- ions. 
In this way, a suspension of mg(OH)2 provides a steady con-
centration of dissolved OH- ions to neutralize stomach acid.
Q u e s t i o n
Write chemical equations showing the reactions of each of the 
bases in the antacids discussed here with stomach acid (HCl).
	 16.8	 The Acid–Base Properties of  
Ions and Salts
We have already seen that some ions act as bases. For example, the bicarbonate ion acts 
as a base according to the following equation:
HCO3
-(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H2CO3(aq) + OH-(aq)
The bicarbonate ion, like any ion, does not exist by itself—in order to be charge-neutral, 
it must pair with a counter ion (in this case a cation) to form an ionic compound, called 
a salt. For example, the sodium salt of bicarbonate is sodium bicarbonate. Like all soluble 
salts, sodium bicarbonate dissociates in solution to form a sodium cation and bicarbon-
ate anion:
NaHCO3(s) ∆Na+(aq) + HCO3
-(aq)
The sodium ion has neither acidic nor basic properties (it does not ionize water), as 
we will see shortly. The bicarbonate ion, by contrast, acts as a weak base, ionizing water 
as just shown to form a basic solution. Consequently, the pH of a sodium bicarbonate 
solution is above 7 (the solution is basic). In this section, we consider some of the acid–
base properties of salts and the ions they contain. Some salts are pH-neutral when put 
into water, others are acidic, and still others are basic, depending on their constituent 
anions and cations. In general, anions tend to form either basic or neutral solutions, 
while cations tend to form either acidic or neutral solutions.

Ions and Salts

Anions as Weak Bases
We can think of any anion as the conjugate base of an acid. Consider the following 
anions and their corresponding acids:
This anion
is the conjugate base of
this acid
Cl-
HCl
F-
HF
NO3
-
HNO3
C2H3O2
-
HC2H3O2
In general, the anion A- is the conjugate base of the acid HA. Since every anion can 
be regarded as the conjugate base of an acid, every anion itself can potentially act as a 
base. However, not every anion does act as a base—it depends on the strength of the 
­corresponding acid. In general:
• An anion that is the conjugate base of a weak acid is itself a weak base.
• An anion that is the conjugate base of a strong acid is pH-neutral (forms solutions 
that are neither acidic nor basic).
For example, the Cl- anion is the conjugate base of HCl, a strong acid. Therefore the 
Cl- anion is pH-neutral (neither acidic nor basic). The F- anion, however, is the conju-
gate base of HF, a weak acid. Therefore, the F- ion is itself a weak base and ionizes water 
according to the reaction:
F-(aq) + H2O(l) ∆OH-(aq) + HF(aq)
We can understand why the conjugate base of a weak acid is basic by asking our-
selves why an acid is weak to begin with. Hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid because the 
following reaction lies to the left:
HF(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + F-(aq)
The equilibrium lies to the left because the F- ion has a significant affinity for H+ ions. 
Consequently, when F- is put into water, its affinity for H+ ions allows it to remove H+ ions 
from water molecules, thus acting as a weak base. In general, as shown in Figure 16.12▼,

the weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base (as we saw in Section 16.4). In ­contrast, 
the conjugate base of a strong acid, such as Cl-, does not act as a base because this reaction 
lies far to the right:
HCl(aq) + H2O(l) ¡ H3O+(aq) + Cl-(aq)
The reaction lies far to the right because the Cl- ion has a low affinity for H+ ions. Conse-
quently, when Cl- is put into water, it does not remove H+ ions from water molecules.
Example 16.13	
Determining Whether an Anion Is Basic  
or pH-Neutral
Classify each anion as a weak base or pH-neutral.

Solution
(a)	 From Table 16.3, you can see that NO3
- is the conjugate base of a strong acid 
(HNO3) and is therefore pH-neutral.
(b)	 From Table 16.5 (or from its absence in Table 16.3), you know that NO2
- is the 
conjugate base of a weak acid (HNO2) and is therefore a weak base.
(c)	 From Table 16.5 (or from its absence in Table 16.3), you know that C2H3O2
- is 
the conjugate base of a weak acid (HC2H3O2) and is therefore a weak base.

We can determine the pH of a solution containing an anion that acts as a weak base 
in a manner similar to how we determine the pH of any weak base solution. However, we 
need to know Kb for the anion acting as a base, which we can readily determine from Ka 
of the corresponding acid. Recall from Section 16.4 the expression for Ka for a generic 
acid HA:
HA(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + A-(aq)
Ka = [H3O+][A-]
[HA]
Similarly, the expression for Kb for the conjugate base (A-) is:
A-(aq) + H2O(l) ∆OH-(aq) + HA(aq)
Kb = [OH-][HA]
[A-]
If we multiply the expressions for Ka and Kb, we get Kw:
Ka * Kb = [H3O+][A-][OH-][HA]
[HA]  [A] 
 = [H3O+][OH-] = Kw
Or simply,
Ka * Kb = Kw
The product of Ka for an acid and Kb for its conjugate base is Kw (1.0 * 10-14 at 
25 °C). Consequently, we can find Kb for an anion acting as a base from the value of Ka 
for the corresponding acid. For example, for acetic acid (HC2H3O2), Ka = 1.8 * 10-5. ­ 
We calculate Kb for the conjugate base (C2H3O2
-) by substituting into the equation:
Ka * Kb = Kw
Kb = Kw
Ka
= 1.0 * 10-14
1.8 * 10-5 = 5.6 * 10-10
Knowing Kb, we can find the pH of a solution containing an anion acting as a base, as 
Example 16.14 demonstrates.

ties, you can ignore it. Write the balanced equation for the

4.	 Find Kb from Ka (for the conjugate acid).
Substitute the expressions for the equilibrium concentrations 
(from step 3) into the expression for Kb. In many cases, you 
can make the approximation that x is small.
Substitute the value of Kb into the Kb expression and solve  
for x.
Confirm that the x is small approximation is valid by calculat-
ing the ratio of x to the number it was subtracted from in the 
approximation. The ratio should be less than 0.05 (or 5%).

5.	 Determine the OH- concentration from the calculated value 
of x.
Use the expression for Kw to find [H3O+].
Substitute [H3O+] into the pH equation to find pH.
[OH-] = 2.4 * 10-6 M
[H3O+][OH-] = Kw = 1.0 * 10-14
[H3O+](2.4 * 10-6) = 1.0 * 10-14
[H3O+] = 4.2 * 10-9 M
 pH = -log[H3O+]
 = -log(4.2 * 10-9)
 = 8.38
For Practice 16.14  Find the pH of a 0.250 M NaC2H3O2 solution.

754	
Chapter 16  Acids and Bases
We can also express the relationship between Ka and Kb in terms of pKa and pKb. 
By taking the log of both sides of Ka * Kb = Kw, we get:
 log(Ka * Kb) = log Kw
 log Ka + log Kb = log Kw
Since Kw = 10-14, we can rearrange the equation to get:
log Ka + log Kb = log 10-14 = -14
Rearranging further:
-log Ka - log Kb = 14
Since -log K = pK, we get:
pKa + pKb = 14
Cations as Weak Acids
In contrast to anions, which in some cases act as weak bases, cations can in some cases 
act as weak acids. Although some exceptions exist, we can generally divide cations into 
three categories: cations that are the counterions of strong bases; cations that are the 
conjugate acids of weak bases; and cations that are small, highly charged metals. We 
examine each individually.
Cations That Are the Counterions of Strong Bases
Strong bases such as NaOH or Ca(OH)2 generally contain hydroxide ions and a counter-
ion. In solution, a strong base completely dissociates to form OH-(aq) and the solvated 
(in solution) counterion. Although these counterions interact with water molecules via 
ion–dipole forces, they do not ionize water and they do not contribute to the acidity or 
basicity of the solution. In general cations that are the counterions of strong bases are them-
selves pH-neutral (they form solutions that are neither acidic nor basic). For example, 
Na+, K+,  and Ca2 + are the counterions of the strong bases NaOH, KOH, and Ca(OH)2 
and are therefore themselves pH-neutral.
Cations That Are the Conjugate Acids of Weak Bases
A cation can be formed from any nonionic weak base by adding a proton (H+) to its for-
mula. The cation is the conjugate acid of the base. Consider the following cations and 
their corresponding weak bases:
This cation
is the conjugate acid of
this weak base
NH4
+
NH3
C2H5NH3
+
C2H5NH2
CH3NH3
+
CH3NH2
Any of these cations, with the general formula BH+, will act as a weak acid according to 
the equation:
BH+(aq) + H2O(aq) ∆H3O+(aq) + B(aq)
In general, a cation that is the conjugate acid of a weak base is a weak acid.
We can calculate the pH of a solution containing the conjugate acid of a weak base 
just like that of any other weak acidic solution. However, we must derive the value of Ka 
for the acid from Kb using the previously derived relationship: Ka * Kb = Kw.
Cations That Are Small, Highly Charged Metals
Small, highly charged metal cations such as Al3 + and Fe3 + form weakly acidic solutions. For 
example, when Al3 + is dissolved in water, it becomes hydrated according to the equation:
Al3 +(aq) + 6 H2O(l) ¡ Al(H2O)6
3+(aq)

	
16.8  The Acid–Base Properties of Ions and Salts 	
755
The hydrated form of the ion then acts as a Brønsted–Lowry acid:
Al(H2O)63+(aq)
H2O(aq)
+
+
+
Al(H2O)5(OH)2+(aq)
H3O+(aq)
+
Neither the alkali metal cations nor the alkaline earth metal cations ionize water in 
this way, but the cations of many other metals do. The smaller and more highly charged 
the cation, the more acidic its behavior.

(a)	 The C5H5NH+ cation is the conjugate acid of a weak base and is therefore a 
weak acid.
(b)	 The Ca2 + cation is the counterion of a strong base and is therefore pH-neutral 
(neither acidic nor basic).
(c)	 The Cr3 + cation is a small, highly charged metal cation and is therefore a 
weak acid.

(c)	 Fe3 +
Classifying Salt Solutions as Acidic, Basic, or Neutral
Since salts contain both a cation and an anion, they can form acidic, basic, or neutral 
solutions when dissolved in water. The pH of the solution depends on the specific cation 
and anion involved. We examine the four possibilities individually.
1.	 Salts in which neither the cation nor the anion acts as an acid or a base 
form pH-neutral solutions.  A salt in which the cation is the counterion of a 
strong base and in which the anion is the conjugate base of strong acid forms a 
neutral solution. Some salts in this category include:
	
NaCl	
Ca(NO3)2	
KBr
	
sodium chloride	
calcium nitrate	
potassium bromide
	
Cations are pH–neutral. 
Anions are conjugate bases of strong acids.
2.	 Salts in which the cation does not act as an acid and the anion acts as a 
base form basic solutions.  A salt in which the cation is the counterion of a 
strong base and in which the anion is the conjugate base of weak acid forms a basic 
solution. Salts in this category include:
	
NaF	
Ca(C2H3O2)2	
KNO2
	
sodium fluoride	
calcium acetate	
potassium nitrite
	
Cations are pH–neutral . 
Anions are conjugate bases of weak acids.
In effect, the binding of a water 
molecule to the cation makes the 
water more acidic. See Section 16.10.

We can determine the overall acidity or basicity of a solution containing one of these 
salts by comparing the Ka of the acid to the Kb of the base—the ion with the higher value 
of K dominates and determines whether the solution will be acidic or basic, as shown in 
part (e) of Example 16.16. Table 16.9 summarizes all of these possibilities.

	 16.9	 Polyprotic Acids
In Section 16.4, we discussed that some acids, called polyprotic acids, contain two or 
more ionizable protons. Recall that sulfurous acid (H2SO3) is a diprotic acid containing 
two ionizable protons and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid containing three 
ionizable protons.
Typically, a polyprotic acid ionizes in successive steps, each with its own Ka. For 
example, sulfurous acid ionizes in two steps:
H2SO3(aq) ∆H+(aq) + HSO3
-(aq)   Ka1 = 1.6 * 10-2
HSO3
-(aq) ∆H+(aq) + SO3
2-(aq)   Ka2 = 6.4 * 10-8
Ka1  is the acid ionization constant for the first step, and Ka2 is the acid ionization constant 
for the second step. Notice that Ka2 is much smaller than Ka1. This is true for all polyprotic 
acids and makes sense because the first proton separates from a neutral molecule, while 

758	
Chapter 16  Acids and Bases
the second must separate from an anion. The negatively charged anion holds the posi-
tively charged proton more tightly, making the proton more difficult to remove and 
resulting in a smaller value of Ka.
Table 16.10 lists some common polyprotic acids and their acid ionization constants. 
Notice that in all cases, the value of Ka for each step becomes successively smaller. The 
value of Ka1 for sulfuric acid is identified as strong because sulfuric acid is strong in the 
first step and weak in the second.

Finding the pH of Polyprotic Acid Solutions
Finding the pH of a polyprotic acid solution is less difficult than we might first imagine 
because, for most polyprotic acids, Ka1 is much larger than Ka2 (or Ka3 for triprotic acids). 
Therefore the amount of H3O+ formed by the first ionization step is much larger than 

	
16.9  Polyprotic Acids

that formed by the second or third ionization step. In addition, the formation of H3O+ 
in the first step inhibits the formation of additional H3O+ in the second step (because of 
Le Châtelier’s principle). Consequently, we treat most polyprotic acid solutions as if the 
first step were the only one that contributes to the H3O+ concentration, as illustrated in 
Example 16.17. A major exception is a dilute solution of sulfuric acid, which we examine 
in Example 16.18.
Example 16.17	
Finding the pH of a Polyprotic Acid Solution
Find the pH of a 0.100 M ascorbic acid (H2C6H6O6) solution.
Solution
To find the pH, you must find the equilibrium concentration 
of H3O+. Treat the problem as a weak acid pH problem with 
a single ionizable proton. The second proton contributes a 
negligible amount to the concentration of H3O+ and can be 
ignored. Follow the procedure from Example 16.6, shown in 
condensed form here. Use Ka1 for ascorbic acid from  
Table 16.10.
Confirm that the x is small approximation is valid by 
­calculating the ratio of x to the number it was subtracted 
from in the approximation. The ratio should be less than 
0.05 (or 5%).

Example 16.18	
Dilute H2SO4 Solutions
Find the pH of a 0.0100 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution.
Solution
Sulfuric acid is strong in its first ionization step and 
weak in its second. Begin by writing the equations 
for the two steps. As the concentration of an H2SO4 
solution becomes smaller, the second ionization step 
becomes more significant because the percent ioniza-
tion increases (as discussed in Section 16.6). Therefore, 
for a concentration of 0.0100 M, you can’t neglect the 
H3O+ contribution from the second step, as you can 
for other polyprotic acids. You must calculate the H3O+ 
contributions from both steps.

The [H3O+] that results from the first ionization step is 
0.0100 M (because the first step is strong). To determine 
the [H3O+] formed by the second step, prepare an ICE 
table for the second step in which the initial concen-
tration of H3O+ is 0.0100 M. The initial concentration 
of HSO4
- must also be 0.0100 M (due to the stoichiom-

Determine the H3O+ concentration from the 
­calculated value of x and calculate the pH. Notice that 
the second step produces almost half as much H3O+ 
as the first step—an amount that must not be ignored. 
This is always the case with dilute H2SO4 solutions.

Finding the Concentration of the Anions for a Weak 
Diprotic Acid Solution
In some cases, we may want to know the concentrations of the anions formed by a poly-
protic acid. Consider the following generic polyprotic acid H2X and its ionization steps:
 H2X(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + HX-(aq)   Ka1
 HX-(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + X2 -(aq)   Ka2
In Examples 16.17 and 16.18, we illustrated how to find the concentration of H3O+ for 
such a solution, which is equal to the concentration of HX-. What if instead we needed to 
find the concentration of X2 -? To find the concentration of X2 -, we use the concentra-
tion of HX- and H3O+ (from the first ionization step) as the initial concentrations for the 
second ionization step. We then solve a second equilibrium problem using the second 
ionization equation and Ka2, as demonstrated in Example 16.19.

[HC6H6O6

step (as calculated in Example 16.17) as the initial

diprotic acid H2X is equal to Ka2. This general result applies to all diprotic acids in which 
the x is small approximation is valid. Notice also that the concentration of H3O+ produced 
by the second ionization step of a diprotic acid is very small compared to the concentra-
tion produced by the first step, as shown in Figure 16.13▼.

Chapter 16  Acids and Bases
	16.10	 Acid Strength and Molecular Structure
We have learned that a Brønsted–Lowry acid is a proton (H+) donor. However, we have 
not explored why some hydrogen-containing molecules act as acids while others do not, 
or why some acids are strong and others weak. For example, why is H2S acidic while CH4 
is not? Or why is HF a weak acid while HCl is a strong acid? We divide our discussion 
about these issues into two categories: binary acids (those containing hydrogen and 
only one other element) and oxyacids (those containing hydrogen bonded to an oxygen 
atom that is bonded to another element).
Binary Acids
Consider the bond between a hydrogen atom and some other generic element (which 
we call Y):
H ¬ Y
The factors affecting the ease with which this hydrogen is donated (and therefore will be 
acidic) are the polarity of the bond and the strength of the bond.
Bond Polarity
Using the notation introduced in Chapter 9, the H ¬ Y bond must be polarized with the 
hydrogen atom as the positive pole in order for HY to be acidic:
Yδ−
δ+H
This requirement makes physical sense because the hydrogen atom must be lost as a pos-
itively charged ion (H+). A partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom facilitates its 
loss. Consider the following three bonds and their corresponding dipole moments:
Li
H
Not acidic
C
H
Not acidic
F
H
Acidic
LiH is ionic with the negative charge on the hydrogen atom; therefore, LiH is not acidic. The 
C¬ H bond is virtually nonpolar because the electronegativities of carbon and hydro-
gen are similar; therefore C¬ H is not acidic. In contrast, the H ¬ F bond is polar with 
the positive charge on the hydrogen atom. As we have discussed in this chapter, HF is an 
acid. This is because the partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom makes it easier for 
the hydrogen to be lost as an H+ ion.
Bond Strength
The strength of the H ¬ Y bond also affects the strength of the corresponding acid. As we 
might expect, the stronger the bond, the weaker the acid—the more tightly the hydro-
gen atom is held, the less likely it is to come off. We can see the effect of bond strength by 
comparing the bond strengths and acidities of the hydrogen halides:
Acid
Bond Energy (kJ, mol)
Type of Acid
H ¬ F
565
Weak
H ¬ Cl
431
Strong
H ¬ Br
364
Strong
HCl and HBr have weaker bonds and are both strong acids. HF, however, has a stronger 
bond and is therefore a weak acid, despite the greater bond polarity of HF.
The Combined Effect of Bond Polarity and Bond Strength
We can see the combined effect of bond polarity and bond strength by examining the 
trends in acidity of the group 6A and 7A hydrides as shown in Figure 16.14◀. The hydrides 
become more acidic from left to right as the H ¬ Y bond becomes more polar. The 
hydrides also become more acidic from top to bottom as the H ¬ Y bond becomes weaker.

16.10  Acid Strength and Molecular Structure	
763
Oxyacids
Oxyacids contain a hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom. The oxygen atom is in 
turn bonded to another atom (which we call Y):
H — O— Y—
Y may or may not be bonded to yet other atoms. The factors affecting the ease with which 
the hydrogen in an oxyacid is donated (and therefore is acidic) are the electronegativity of 
the element Y and the number of oxygen atoms attached to the element Y.
The Electronegativity of Y
The more electronegative the element Y, the more it weakens and polarizes the H—O 
bond and the more acidic the oxyacid is. We can see this effect by comparing the electro-
negativity of Y and the acid ionization constants of the following oxyacids:
Acid
Electronegativity of Y
Ka
H ¬ O ¬ I
2.5
2.3 * 10-11
H ¬ O ¬ Br
2.8
2.0 * 10-9
H ¬ O ¬ Cl
3.0
2.9 * 10-8
Chlorine is the most electronegative of the three elements, and the corresponding acid 
has the greatest Ka.
The Number of Oxygen Atoms Bonded to Y
Oxyacids may contain additional oxygen atoms bonded to the element Y. Because these 
additional oxygen atoms are electronegative, they draw electron density away from Y, 
which in turn draws electron density away from the H—O bond, further weakening and 
polarizing it, and leading to increasing acidity. We can see this effect by comparing the 
following series of acid ionization constants:
Acid
HClO4
HClO3
HClO2

The greater the number of oxygen atoms bonded to Y, the stronger the acid. On this 
basis we would predict that H2SO4 is a stronger acid than H2SO3 and that HNO3 is stron-
ger than HNO2. As we have seen in this chapter, both H2SO4 and HNO3 are strong acids, 
while H2SO3 and HNO2 are weak acids, as predicted.

	16.11	 Lewis Acids and Bases
We began our definitions of acids and bases with the Arrhenius model. We then saw how 
the Brønsted–Lowry model, by introducing the concept of a proton donor and proton 
acceptor, expands the range of substances that we consider acids and bases. We now 
introduce a third model, which further broadens the range of substances that we can con-
sider acids. This third model is the Lewis model, named after G. N. Lewis, the American 
chemist who devised the electron-dot representation of chemical bonding (Section 9.1).
While the Brønsted–Lowry model focuses on the transfer of a proton, the Lewis 
model focuses on the transfer of an electron pair. Consider the simple acid–base reaction 
between the H+ ion and NH3, shown here with Lewis structures:
H NH3
NH3
+
+
H+
BrØnsted–Lowry model

Lewis model focuses
on the electron pair
According to the Brønsted–Lowry model, the ammonia accepts a proton, thus acting as 
a base. According to the Lewis model, the ammonia acts as a base by donating an electron 
pair. The general definitions of acids and bases according to the Lewis model focus on 
the electron pair:
Lewis acid: electron pair acceptor
Lewis base: electron pair donor
According to the Lewis definition, H+ in the reaction just shown is acting as an acid 
because it is accepting an electron pair from NH3. NH3 is acting as a Lewis base because it 
is donating an electron pair to H+.
Although the Lewis model does not significantly expand the substances that can be 
considered bases—because all proton acceptors must have an electron pair to bind the 
proton—it does significantly expand the substances that can be considered acids. 
According to the Lewis model, a substance need not even contain hydrogen to be an 
acid. For example, consider the gas-phase reaction between boron trifluoride and 
ammonia shown here:
BF3  +   :NH3 ¡  F3B:NH3
	
Lewis acid	
Lewis base	
adduct
Boron trifluoride has an empty orbital that can accept the electron pair from ammonia 
and form the product (the product of a Lewis acid–base reaction is sometimes called an 
adduct). The reaction just shown demonstrates an important property of Lewis acids:
A Lewis acid has an empty orbital (or can rearrange electrons to create an empty orbital) 
that can accept an electron pair.
Consequently, the Lewis definition subsumes a whole new class of acids. Next we 
­examine a few examples.
Molecules That Act as Lewis Acids
Since molecules with incomplete octets have empty orbitals, they can serve as Lewis 
acids. For example, both AlCl3 and BCl3 have incomplete octets:
Cl

The electrons in the double bond on carbon move to the terminal oxygen atom, allow-
ing carbon dioxide to act as a Lewis acid by accepting an electron pair from water. The 
molecule then undergoes a rearrangement in which the hydrogen atom shown in red 
bonds with the terminal oxygen atom instead of the internal one.
Cations That Act as Lewis Acids
Some cations, because they are positively charged and have lost some electrons, have 
empty orbitals that allow them to also act as Lewis acids. Consider the hydration process 
of the Al3 + ion discussed in Section 16.8 shown here:

The aluminum ion acts as a Lewis acid, accepting lone pairs from six water molecules to 
form the hydrated ion. Many other small, highly charged metal ions also act as Lewis 
acids in this way.
	16.12	 Acid Rain
About 82% of U.S. energy comes from the combustion of fossil fuels, including petro-
leum, natural gas, and coal (Figure 16.15▶). Some fossil fuels, especially coal, contain 
small amounts of sulfur impurities. During combustion, these impurities react with oxy-
gen to form SO2. In addition, during combustion of any fossil fuel, nitrogen from the air 
reacts with oxygen to form NO2. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide react with water 
and diatomic oxygen (O2) in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid and nitric acid:
 2 SO2 + O2 + 2 H2O ¡ 2 H2SO4
 4 NO2 + O2 + 2 H2O ¡ 4 HNO3

Chapter 16  Acids and Bases
These acids combine with rain to form acid rain. The 
problem is greatest in the northeastern portion of the 
United States, where the rain is significantly acidic 
because the sulfur and nitrogen oxides produced by 
coal combustion in the Midwest are carried toward 
the Northeast by natural air currents.
Even in relatively unpolluted areas, rain is natu-
rally somewhat acidic because of atmospheric carbon 
dioxide. Carbon dioxide combines with rainwater to 
form carbonic acid:
CO2 + H2O ¡ H2CO3
However, carbonic acid is a relatively weak acid. Rain 
that is saturated with CO2 has a pH of about 5.6, 
which is only mildly acidic. When nitric acid and sul-
furic acid mix with rain, the pH of the rain can fall 
below 4.3 (Figure 16.16◀). Remember that because of 
the logarithmic nature of the pH scale, rain with a pH of 4.3 has an [H3O+] that is 20 
times greater than rain with a pH of 5.6. Rain that is this acidic has a harmful impact.
Effects of Acid Rain
Acids dissolve metals and acid rain degrades metal structures. Bridges, railroads, and 
even automobiles can be damaged by acid rain. Since acids react with carbonates, acid 
rain also harms building materials that contain carbonates (CO3
2 -), including marble, 
cement, and limestone. Statues, buildings, and pathways in the Northeast show signifi-
cant signs of acid rain damage (Figure 16.17a▼).
Acid rain also accumulates in lakes and rivers and affects aquatic life. Many lakes, 
especially those that are surrounded by land that contains significant amounts of lime-
stone (CaCO3), have the ability to neutralize acidic rain. In the Midwest, for example, 
limestone-rich soils prevent most lakes from becoming acidified. In the northeastern 
United States, however, the lack of limestone makes lakes more susceptible, and over 
2000 lakes and streams have increased acidity levels due to acid rain. Aquatic plants, 
frogs, salamanders, and some species of fish are sensitive to acid levels and cannot sur-
vive in the acidified water. Trees can also be affected by acid rain because the acid 
removes nutrients from the soil, making survival difficult (Figure 16.17b▼).

Acid Rain Legislation
In 1990, the U.S. Congress passed amendments to the Clean Air Act specifically tar-
geted at reducing acid rain. These amendments force electrical utilities—which are the 
most significant source of SO2—to lower their SO2 emissions gradually over time. The 
result has been a 76% decrease in SO2 pollutant levels in the United States since 1990 
(Figure 16.18▼). The acidity of rain over the northeastern United States has begun to 
decrease, and lakes are beginning to recover. In the early 1990s, scientists categorized 
30% of the lakes in the Northeast as being of acute concern, which means that a com-
plete loss of fish population is expected. Today, the fraction of lakes in this category 
has been reduced to less than 18%. The acid rain program has been a dramatic success, 
and today’s environmental legislation—such as legislation aimed at global warming—
is using the acid rain legislation as a model for what can work.

Key Concepts
Heartburn (16.1)
▶
▶Hydrochloric acid from the stomach sometimes comes in con-
tact with the esophageal lining, resulting in irritation, called 
heartburn. Heartburn is treated with antacids, bases that neu-
tralize stomach acid.
The Nature of Acids and Bases (16.2)
▶
▶Acids generally taste sour, dissolve metals, turn blue litmus paper 
red, and neutralize bases. Common acids are hydrochloric, sulfu-
ric, nitric, and carboxylic acids.

▶
▶Bases generally taste bitter, feel slippery, turn red litmus paper 
blue, and neutralize acids. Common bases are sodium hydroxide, 
sodium bicarbonate, and potassium hydroxide.
Definitions of Acids and Bases (16.3)
▶
▶The Arrhenius definition of acids and bases states that in an aque-
ous solution, an acid produces hydrogen ions and a base produces 
hydroxide ions.
▶
▶The Brønsted–Lowry definition states that an acid is a proton 
(hydrogen ion) donor and a base is a proton acceptor. According 
to the Brønsted–Lowry definition, two substances related by the 
transfer of a proton are a conjugate acid–base pair.
Acid Strength and the Acid Dissociation Constant, 
Ka (16.4)
▶
▶In a solution, a strong acid completely ionizes but a weak acid only 
partially ionizes.
▶
▶Generally, the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base, 
and vice versa.
▶
▶The extent of dissociation of a weak acid is quantified by the acid 
dissociation constant, Ka, which is the equilibrium constant for 
the ionization of the weak acid.
Autoionization of Water and pH (16.5)
▶
▶In an acidic solution, the concentration of hydrogen ions is always 
greater than the concentration of hydroxide ions. [H3O+] multi-
plied by [OH-] is always constant at a constant temperature.
▶
▶There are two types of logarithmic acid–base scales: pH and pOH. 
At 25 °C, the sum of a solution’s pH and pOH is always 14.
Finding the [H3o+] and pH of Strong and Weak 
Acid Solutions (16.6)
▶
▶In a strong acid solution, the hydrogen ion concentration equals 
the initial concentration of the acid.
▶
▶In a weak acid solution, the hydrogen ion concentration—which 
can be determined by solving an equilibrium problem—is lower 
than the initial acid concentration.
▶
▶The percent ionization of weak acids decreases as the acid (and 
­hydrogen ion) concentration increases.
▶
▶In mixtures of two acids with large Ka differences, the concentra-
tion of hydrogen ions can usually be determined by considering 
only the stronger of the two acids.
Base Solutions (16.7)
▶
▶A strong base dissociates completely; a weak base does not.
▶
▶Most weak bases produce hydroxide ions through the ionization 
of water. The base ionization constant, Kb, indicates the extent of 
ionization.
Ions as Acids and Bases (16.8)
▶
▶A cation is a weak acid if it is the conjugate acid of a weak base; it is 
neutral if it is the counter ion of a strong base.
▶
▶An anion is a weak base if it is the conjugate base of a weak acid; it 
is neutral if it is the conjugate base of a strong acid.
▶
▶To calculate the pH of a solution of an acidic cation or basic anion, 
we determine Ka or Kb from the equation Ka * Kb = Kw.
Polyprotic Acids (16.9)
▶
▶Polyprotic acids contain two or more ionizable protons.
▶
▶Generally, polyprotic acids ionize in successive steps, and the 
­value of Ka becomes smaller for each step.
▶
▶In many cases, we can determine the [H3O+] of a polyprotic acid 
solution by considering only the first ionization step; then, the 
concentration of the anion formed in the second ionization step 
is equivalent to the value of Ka2.
Acid Strength and Molecular Structure (16.10)
▶
▶For binary acids, acid strength decreases with increasing bond 
­energy and increases with increasing bond polarity.
▶
▶For oxyacids, acid strength increases with the electronegativity of 
the atoms bonded to the oxygen atom and also increases with the 
number of oxygen atoms in the molecule.
Lewis Acids and Bases (16.11)
▶
▶A third model of acids and bases, the Lewis model, defines a base 
as an electron pair donor and an acid as an electron pair acceptor. 
According to this definition, an acid does not have to contain hy-
drogen. A Lewis acid can be a compound with an empty orbital—
or one that will rearrange to make an empty orbital—or a cation.
Acid Rain (16.12)
▶
▶The combustion of fossil fuels produces oxides of sulfur and nitro-
gen, which react with oxygen and water to form sulfuric and nitric 
acids. These acids combine with rain to form acid rain.
▶
▶Acid rain corrodes human-made structures and damages aquatic 
environments and forests. Environmental legislation has helped 
stabilize the amount of acid rain being produced.
Key Equations and Relationships
Note: In all of these equations [H+] is interchangeable with [H3O+].
Expression for the Acid Ionization Constant, Ka (16.4)
Ka = [H3O+][a-]

pOH = -log[OH-]
Relationship between pH and pOH (16.5)
pH + pOH = 14.00
Expression for the pKa Scale (16.5)

[Ha]init
* 100%
Relationship between Ka, Kb, and Kw (16.8)

Data Interpretation and Analysis
Sulfur Dioxide in Wine
	166. 	Sulfur dioxide protects wine from spoiling; it acts as an antioxi-
dant, a bactericide, and a preservative. Potassium or sodium 
metabisulfite, (K2S2O5 or NaS2O5), is a good source of sulfur di-
oxide. SO2 ­exists in a pH-dependent equilibrium system:
SO2 + H2O ∆ H + + HSO3
- ∆ 2H + + SO3
2-
pKa = 1.81          pKa = 7.2
In this equilibrium system, SO2 is called “molecular SO2”. 
In the HSO3
- form, it is called “free SO2”. Only molecular SO2 is 
active as a preservative. The amount of molecular SO2 that is 
available from a given amount of free SO2 is highly pH-­
dependent, which is one reason that winemakers carefully 
measure and adjust pH. The recommended amount of molecu-
lar SO2 in white wine is 0.8 ppm, and for red wine it is 0.5 ppm. 
The bisulfite ion (HSO3
- ) or “free SO2” is measured in milli-
grams SO2 produced per L, or mg/L which is approximately 
equivalent to 1 ppm. Figure a ▶ shows the recommended 
amount of free SO2 required to obtain the correct amount of 
molecular SO2 concentration as a function of pH in white wine 
and red wine.
	152. 	Basicity in the gas phase can be defined as the proton affinity of 
the base, for example, CH3NH2(g) + H+(g) ∆CH3NH3
+(g). 
In the gas phase, (CH3)3N is more basic than CH3NH2, while in 
solution the reverse is true. Explain this observation.
	153. 	Calculate the pH of a solution prepared from 0.200 mol of 
NH4CN and enough water to make 1.00 L of solution.
	154. 	To 1.0 L of a 0.30 M solution of HClO2 is added 0.20 mol of NaF. 
Calculate the [HClO2] at equilibrium.

Answers to Conceptual Connections
Conjugate Acid–Base Pairs
16.1	 (b) H2SO4 and H2SO3 are both acids; this is not a conjugate 
acid–base pair.
The Magnitude of the Acid Ionization Constant
16.2	 HB has the largest Ka.
Relative Strengths of Weak Acids
16.3	 HF is stronger because it has a larger acid ionization constant.
pH and Acidity
16.4	 (b) As pH increases, acidity decreases.
The x is small Approximation
16.5	 (c) The validity of the x is small approximation depends on 
both the value of the equilibrium constant and the initial con-
centration—the closer that these are to one another, the less 
likely the approximation is valid.
Strong and Weak Acids
16.6	 (a) A weak acid solution is usually less than 5% dissociated. 
Since HCl is a strong acid, the 0.10 M solution is much more 
acidic than either a weak acid with the same concentration or 
even a weak acid that is twice as concentrated.
Percent Ionization
16.7	 Solution (c) has the greatest percent ionization because 
­percent ionization increases with decreasing weak acid 
­concentration. Solution (b) has the lowest pH because the 
equilibrium H3O+ concentration increases with increasing 
weak acid concentration.
Judging Relative pH
16.8	 (a) A weak acid solution is usually less than 5% dissociated. 
Therefore, since HCl is the only strong acid, the 1.0 M solu-
tion is much more acidic than either a weak acid that is twice 
as concentrated or a combination of two weak acids with the 
same concentrations.
Acid Strength and Molecular Structure
16.9	 (a) Since the carbon atom in (a) is bonded to another oxy-
gen atom, which draws electron density away from the O¬ H 
bond (weakening and polarizing it), and the carbon atom in 
(b) is bonded only to other hydrogen atoms, the proton in 
structure (a) is more acidic.

▲ Antifreeze is a dangerous poison 
that affects the blood’s ability to 
carry oxygen.
W
e have already seen the importance of aqueous solutions, first in Chapters 4, 
13, and 15, and most recently in Chapter 16 on acids and bases. We now turn 
our attention to two additional topics involving aqueous solutions: buffers 
(solutions that resist pH change) and solubility equilibria (the extent to which slightly 
soluble ionic compounds dissolve in water). Buffers are tremendously important in biol-
ogy because nearly all physiological processes must occur within a narrow pH range. 
Solubility equilibria are related to the solubility rules that we discussed in Chapter 4. In 
this chapter, we find a more complicated picture: solids that we considered insoluble 
under the simple “solubility rules” are actually better described as being only very 
slightly soluble, as the chapter-opening quotation from Otto Witt suggests. Solubility 
equilibria are important in predicting not only solubility, but also precipitation reac-
tions that might occur when aqueous solutions are mixed.
	 17.1	 The Danger of Antifreeze
Every year, thousands of dogs and cats die from consuming a common household 
­product: improperly stored or leaked antifreeze. Most types of auto antifreeze are 
­aqueous solutions of ethylene glycol:
HOCH2CH2OH
Some brands of antifreeze use 
propylene glycol, which is less toxic 
than ethylene glycol.

780	
Chapter 17  Aqueous Ionic Equilibrium
Ethylene glycol has a somewhat sweet taste that can attract curious dogs and cats—and 
sometimes even young children, who are also vulnerable to this toxic compound. The first 
stage of ethylene glycol poisoning is a state resembling drunkenness. Because the com-
pound is an alcohol, it affects the brain much as an alcoholic beverage would. Once ethylene 
glycol starts to be metabolized, however, a second and more deadly stage commences.
In the liver, ethylene glycol is oxidized to glycolic acid (HOCH2COOH), which 
enters the bloodstream. The acidity of blood is critically important and tightly regulated 
because many proteins only function in a narrow pH range. In human blood, for exam-
ple, pH is held between 7.36 and 7.42. This nearly constant blood pH is maintained by 
buffers. We discuss buffers more carefully later in this chapter, but for now know that a 
buffer is a chemical system that resists pH changes by neutralizing added acid or base. An 
important buffer in blood is a mixture of carbonic acid (H2CO3) and the bicarbonate ion 
(HCO3
-). The carbonic acid neutralizes added base:
H2CO3(aq) + OH -(aq) ¡ H2O(l) + HCO3
-(aq)
	
added base
The bicarbonate ion neutralizes added acid:
HCO3
-(aq) + H +(aq) ¡ H2CO3(aq)
	
added acid
In this way, the carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion buffering system keeps blood pH 
nearly constant.
When the glycolic acid generated by antifreeze consumption first enters the blood-
stream, the acid’s tendency to lower blood pH is countered by the buffering action of the 
bicarbonate ion. However, if the quantities of consumed antifreeze are large enough, the gly-
colic acid overwhelms the capacity of the buffer (we discuss buffer capacity in Section 17.3), 
causing blood pH to drop to dangerously low levels.
Low blood pH results in acidosis, a condition in which the acid affects the 
­equilibrium between hemoglobin (Hb) and oxygen:
Shift left
HbH+(aq) + O2(g)
HbO2(aq) + H+(aq)
Excess H+
The excess acid causes the equilibrium to shift to the left, reducing the blood’s ability to 
carry oxygen. At this point, the cat or dog may begin hyperventilating in an effort to 
overcome the acidic blood’s lowered oxygen-carrying capacity. If no treatment is admin-
istered, the animal will eventually go into a coma and die.
One treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is the administration of ethyl alcohol 
(the alcohol found in alcoholic beverages). The two molecules are similar enough that 
the liver enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of ethylene glycol also acts on ethyl alco-
hol, but the enzyme has a higher affinity for ethyl alcohol than for ethylene glycol. Con-
sequently, the enzyme preferentially metabolizes ethyl alcohol, allowing the 
unmetabolized ethylene glycol to escape through the urine. If administered early, this 
treatment can save the life of a dog or cat that has consumed ethylene glycol.
	 17.2	 Buffers: Solutions That Resist pH Change
Most solutions significantly change pH when an acid or base is added to them. As we 
have just learned, however, a buffer resists pH change by neutralizing added acid or 
added base. A buffer contains either:
1.	 significant amounts of a weak acid and its conjugate base or
2.	 significant amounts of a weak base and its conjugate acid.
For example, the buffer in blood is composed of carbonic acid (H2CO3) and its con-
jugate base, the bicarbonate ion (HCO3
-). When additional base is added to a buffer, the 
weak acid reacts with the base, neutralizing it. When additional acid is added to a buffer, 
the conjugate base reacts with the acid, neutralizing it. In this way, a buffer can maintain 
a nearly constant pH.
Buffers

	
17.2  Buffers: Solutions That Resist pH Change	
781
A weak acid by itself, even though it partially ionizes to form some of its conjugate 
base, does not contain sufficient base to be a buffer. Similarly, a weak base by itself, even 
though it partially ionizes water to form some of its conjugate acid, does not contain suf-
ficient acid to be a buffer. A buffer must contain significant amounts of both a weak acid and 
its conjugate base (or vice versa). Consider the simple buffer made by dissolving acetic acid 
(HC2H3O2) and sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2) in water (Figure 17.1▲).
Suppose, on one hand, that we add a strong base, such as NaOH, to this solution. 
The acetic acid neutralizes the base:
NaOH(aq) + HC2H3O2(aq) ¡ H2O(l) + NaC2H3O2(aq)
As long as the amount of added NaOH is less than the amount of HC2H3O2 in solution, 
the buffer neutralizes the added NaOH and the resulting pH change is small.
Suppose, on the other hand, that we add a strong acid, such as HCl, to the solution. 
In this case, the conjugate base, NaC2H3O2, neutralizes the added HCl:
HCl(aq) + NaC2H3O2(aq) ¡ HC2H3O2(aq) + NaCl(aq)
As long as the amount of added HCl is less than the amount of NaC2H3O2 in solution, 
the buffer neutralizes the added HCl and the resulting pH change is small.

Calculating the pH of a Buffer Solution
In Chapter 16, we discussed how to calculate the pH of a solution containing either a weak 
acid or its conjugate base, but not both. How do we calculate the pH of a buffer—a solution 
containing both? Consider a solution that initially contains HC2H3O2 and NaC2H3O2, 
each at a concentration of 0.100 M. The acetic acid ionizes according to the reaction:
HC2H3O2(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O +(aq) + C2H3O2
-(aq)
Initial concentration:	 0.100 M	
0.100 M
However, the ionization of HC2H3O2 in the solution is suppressed compared to its ion-
ization in a solution that does not initially contain any C2H3O2
-, because the presence 
of C2H3O2
- shifts the equilibrium to the left (as we would expect from Le Châtelier’s prin-
ciple). In other words, the presence of the C2H3O2
-(aq) ion causes the acid to ionize 
even less than it normally would (Figure 17.2▼), resulting in a less acidic solution 
(higher pH). This effect is known as the common ion effect, so named because the 
solution contains two substances (HC2H3O2 and NaC2H3O2) that share a common ion 
(C2H3O2
-). To find the pH of a buffer solution containing common ions, we work an 
equilibrium problem in which the initial concentrations include both the acid and its 
conjugate base, as shown in Example 17.1.

4.	 Substitute the expressions for the equilibrium

In most cases, you can make the approximation that x is small.
(See Sections 15.8 and 16.6 to review the x is small 
­approximation.)
Substitute the value of the acid ionization constant (from 
Table 16.5) into the Ka expression and solve for x.
Confirm that x is small by calculating the ratio of x and the 
number it was subtracted from in the approximation. The 
ratio should be less than 0.05 (5%).

The Henderson–Hasselbalch Equation
We can derive an equation that relates the pH of a buffer solution to the initial 
concentration of the buffer components, thus simplifying the calculation of the pH of a 
buffer solution. Consider a buffer containing the generic weak acid HA and its conjugate 
base A-. The acid ionizes as follows:
HA(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + A-(aq)
We derive an expression for the concentration of H3O+ from the acid ionization 
equilibrium expression by solving the expression for [H3O +]:
 Ka = [H3O+][A-]
[HA]
	
 [H3O+] = Ka [HA]
[A-] 
[17.1]
If we make the same x is small approximation that we make for weak acid or weak 
base equilibrium problems, we can consider the equilibrium concentrations of HA and A- to 
be essentially identical to the initial concentrations of HA and A- (see step 4 of Example 17.1). 
Therefore, to determine [H3O +] for any buffer solution, we multiply Ka by the ratio of 
Recall that the variable x in a 
weak acid equilibrium problem 
represents the change in the initial 
acid concentration. The x is small 
approximation is valid because 
so little of the weak acid ionizes 
compared to its initial concentration.

Chapter 17  Aqueous Ionic Equilibrium
the concentrations of the acid and the conjugate base. To find the [H3O +] of the buffer 
in Example 17.1 (a solution that is 0.100 M in HC2H3O2 and 0.100 M in NaC2H3O2), we 
substitute the concentrations of HC2H3O2 and C2H3O2
- into Equation 17.1:
 [H3O+] = Ka [HC2H3O2]
[C2H3O2
-]
 = Ka 0.100
0.100
 = Ka
In this buffer solution, as in any in which the acid and conjugate base concentrations are 
equal, [H3O+] is equal to Ka.
We can derive an equation for the pH of a buffer by taking the negative logarithm of 
both sides of Equation 17.1:
 [H3O+] = Ka
[HA]
[A-]
 -log[H3O+] = -logaKa
[HA]
[A-] b
	
 -log[H3O+] = -log Ka - log[HA]
[A-] 
[17.2]
We can rearrange Equation 17.2 to get:
-log[H3O+] = -log Ka + log [A-]
[HA]
Since pH = -log[H3O+] and since pKa = -log Ka, we obtain the result:
pH = pKa + log [A-]
[HA]
Since A- is a weak base and HA is a weak acid, we can generalize the equation:
	
pH = pKa + log[base]
[acid] 
[17.3]
where the base is the conjugate base of the acid or the acid is the conjugate acid of the 
base. This equation, known as the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, allows us to 
quickly calculate the pH of a buffer solution from the initial concentrations of the buffer 
components as long as the x is small approximation is valid. In Example 17.2, we show how 
to find the pH of a buffer in two ways: in the left column we solve a common ion effect 
equilibrium problem using a method similar to the one we used in Example 17.1; in the 
right column we use the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation.
Note that, as expected, the pH of a 
buffer increases with an increase in 
the amount of base relative to the 
amount of acid.
Recall that log (A/B) = -log (B/A), 
so -log (A/B) = log (B/A).
Example 17.2	
Calculating the pH of a Buffer Solution as an Equilibrium Problem  
and with the Henderson–Hasselbalch Equation
Calculate the pH of a buffer solution that is 0.050 M in benzoic acid (HC7H5O2) and 0.150 M in sodium benzoate 
(NaC7H5O2). For benzoic acid, Ka = 6.5 * 10 - 5.
Solution
Equilibrium Approach
Henderson–Hasselbalch Approach
Write the balanced equation for the ionization of the acid 
and use it as a guide to prepare an ICE table.
To find the pH of this solution, determine which compo-
nent is the acid and which is the base and substitute their 
concentrations into the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation 
to calculate pH.
Recall that 
log AB = log A + log B, so -log AB 
= -log  A - log B.

­calculating the ratio of x to the number it was subtracted 
from in the approximation. The ratio should be less than 
0.05 (5%). (See Sections 15.8 and 16.6 to review the x is small 
approximation.)

Confirm that the x is small approximation is valid by cal-

by ionization of the acid, the calculated [H3O+] has to be 
less than 0.05 (or 5%) of the initial concentration of the 
acid in order for the x is small approximation to be valid.

2.2 * 10-5

The approximation is valid.
For Practice 17.2  Calculate the pH of a buffer solution that is 0.250 M in HCN and 0.170 M in KCN. For HCN, 
Ka = 4.9 * 10-10 (pKa = 9.31). Use both the equilibrium approach and the Henderson–Hasselbalch approach.
You may be wondering how to decide whether to use the equilibrium approach or 
the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation when calculating the pH of buffer solutions. The 
answer depends on the specific problem. In cases where you can make the x is small 
approximation, the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation is adequate. However, as you can 
see from Example 17.2, checking the x is small approximation is not as convenient with 
the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation (because the approximation is implicit). Thus, the 
equilibrium approach, though lengthier, gives you a better sense of the important quan-
tities in the problem and the nature of the approximation.
When first working buffer problems, use the equilibrium approach until you get a 
good sense for when the x is small approximation is adequate. Then, you can switch to 
the more streamlined approach in cases where the approximation applies (and only in 
those cases). In general, remember that the x is small approximation applies to problems 
in which both of the following are true: (a) the initial concentrations of acids (and/or 
bases) are not too dilute; and (b) the equilibrium constant is fairly small. Although the 
exact values depend on the details of the problem, for many buffer problems this means 
that the initial concentrations of acids and conjugate bases should be at least 102–103 
times greater than the equilibrium constant (depending on the required accuracy).

pH of Buffer Solutions  A buffer contains the weak acid HA and its conjugate 
base A-. The weak acid has a pKa of 4.82 and the buffer has a pH of 4.25. Which statement 
is true of the relative concentrations of the weak acid and conjugate base in the buffer?

(b)	 [HA] 6 [A-]	
(c)	 [HA] = [A-]
Which buffer component would you add to change the pH of the buffer to 4.72?
 
Calculating pH Changes in a Buffer Solution
When we add acid or base to a buffer, the buffer resists a pH change. Nonetheless, the 
pH does change by a small amount. Calculating the pH change requires breaking up the 
problem into two parts:
1.	 The stoichiometry calculation in which we calculate how the addition changes 
the relative amounts of acid and conjugate base.
2.	 The equilibrium calculation in which we calculate the pH based on the new 
amounts of acid and conjugate base.
We demonstrate this calculation with a 1.0-L buffer solution that is 0.100 M in the 
generic acid HA and 0.100 M in its conjugate base A-. Since the concentrations of the 
weak acid and the conjugate base are equal, the pH of the buffer is equal to pKa. Let’s 
calculate the pH of the solution after we add 0.025 mol of strong acid (H +) (assuming 
that the change in volume from adding the acid is negligible).
The Stoichiometry Calculation
As the added acid is neutralized, it converts a stoichiometric amount of the base into its 
conjugate acid through the neutralization reaction (Figure 17.3a▶, on p. 788):
H+(aq) +  A-(aq) ¡ HA(aq)
	
added acid	 weak base in buffer
Neutralizing 0.025 mol of the strong acid (H+) requires 0.025 mol of the weak base (A-). 
Consequently, the amount of A- decreases by 0.025 mol and the amount of HA increases 
by 0.025 mol (because of the 1:1:1 stoichiometry of the neutralization reaction). We can 
track these changes in tabular form as follows:
H+(aq)

After addition

0.075 mol
0.125 mol
It is best to work with amounts in 
moles instead of concentrations when 
tracking these changes, as explained 
later in this chapter.
Notice that this table is not an ICE table. This table simply tracks the stoichiometric 
changes that occur during the neutralization of the added acid. We write ≈0.00  mol for 
the amount of H+ because the amount is so small compared to the amounts of A- and 
HA. (Remember that weak acids ionize only to a small extent and that the presence of 
the common ion further suppresses the ionization.) The amount of H+, of course, is not 
exactly zero, as we can see by completing the equilibrium part of the calculation.
The Equilibrium Calculation
We have just seen that adding a small amount of acid to a buffer is equivalent to 
changing the initial concentrations of the acid and conjugate base present in the buffer 
(in this case, since the volume is 1.0 L, [HA] increased from 0.100 M to 0.125 M and [A-] 
decreased from 0.100 M to 0.075 M). Knowing these new initial concentrations, we can 
calculate the new pH in the same way that we calculate the pH of any buffer: either by 
working a full equilibrium problem or by using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation 
(see Examples 17.1 and 17.2).

	
17.2  Buffers: Solutions That Resist pH Change	
787
In this case, we work the full equilibrium problem. We begin by writing the bal-
anced equation for the ionization of the acid and using it as a guide to prepare an ICE 
table. The initial concentrations for the ICE table are those that we calculated in the stoi-
chiometry part of the calculation:

We then substitute the expressions for the equilibrium concentrations into the expres-
sion for the acid ionization constant. As long as Ka is sufficiently small relative to the 
initial concentrations, we can make the x is small approximation and solve for x, which 
is equal to [H3O+]:
 Ka = [H3O+][A-]
[HA]
 = x(0.075 + x)
0.125 - x    (x is small)
 Ka = x(0.075)
0.125
 x = [H3O+] = Ka 0.125
0.075
Once we calculate [H3O+], we can calculate the pH with the equation pH = -log [H3O+].
Notice that, since the expression for x contains a ratio of concentrations [HA]>[A-], 
the amounts of acid and base in moles may be substituted in place of concentration 
because, in a single buffer solution, the volume is the same for both the acid and the 
base. Therefore, the volumes cancel:
[HA]>[A-] =
nHA 
V 
nA-
V
= nHA>nA-
The effect of adding a small amount of strong base to the buffer is exactly the oppo-
site of adding acid. The added base converts a stoichiometric amount of the acid into its 
conjugate base through the neutralization reaction (Figure 17.3b▶, on the next page):
OH-(aq) +  HA(aq) ¡ H2O(l) + A-(aq)
	
added base	 weak acid in buffer
If we add 0.025 mol of OH-, the amount of A- goes up by 0.025 mol and the amount of 
HA goes down by 0.025 mol, as shown in the following table:

When you calculate the pH of a buffer after adding small amounts of acid or 
base, remember the following:
• Adding a small amount of strong acid to a buffer converts a stoichiometric amount 
of the base to the conjugate acid and decreases the pH of the buffer (adding acid de-
creases pH just as we would expect).
• Adding a small amount of strong base to a buffer converts a stoichiometric amount 
of the acid to the conjugate base and increases the pH of the buffer (adding base 
increases the pH just as we would expect).
The easiest way to remember these 
changes is relatively simple: adding 
acid creates more acid; adding base 
creates more base.

calculate the changes in the amounts (in moles) of the buffer components upon 
addition of the acid or base.
• Part II. Equilibrium—use the new amounts of buffer components to work an 
­equilibrium problem to find pH. (For most buffers, this can also be done with the

Calculating the pH Change in a Buffer Solution after the  
Addition of a Small Amount of Strong Acid or Base
A 1.0-L buffer solution contains 0.100 mol HC2H3O2 and 0.100 mol NaC2H3O2. The value of Ka for HC2H3O2 is 
1.8 * 10 - 5. Because the initial amounts of acid and conjugate base are equal, the pH of the buffer is equal to 
pKa = -log(1.8 * 10 - 5) = 4.74. Calculate the new pH after adding 0.010 mol of solid NaOH to the buffer. For 
comparison, calculate the pH after adding 0.010 mol of solid NaOH to 1.0 L of pure water. (Ignore any small changes in 
volume that might occur upon addition of the base.)
Solution
Part I: Stoichiometry. The addition of the 
base converts a stoichiometric amount of 
acid to the conjugate base (adding base 
creates more base). Write an equation 
showing the neutralization reaction and 
then set up a table to track the changes.

The pH of 1.0 L of water after adding 
0.010 mol of NaOH is calculated from the 
[OH -]. For a strong base, [OH -] is simply 
the number of moles of OH - divided by 
the number of liters of solution.
 [OH -] = 0.010 mol
1.0 L
= 0.010 M
 pOH = -log[OH -] = -log(0.010)
 = 2.00
 pOH + pH = 14.00
 pH = 14.00 - pOH
 = 14.00 - 2.00
 = 12.00
CHECK  Notice that the buffer solution changed from pH = 4.74 to pH = 4.83 upon addition of the base (a small 
fraction of a single pH unit). In contrast, the pure water changed from pH = 7.00 to pH = 12.00, five whole pH units 
(a factor of 105). Notice also that even the buffer solution got slightly more basic upon addition of a base, as we would 
expect. To check your answer, always make sure the pH goes in the direction you expect: adding base should make the 
solution more basic (higher pH); adding acid should make the solution more acidic (lower pH).

▲ Figure 17.4  Buffer Containing a Base  A buffer can also consist of a weak base and 
its conjugate acid.
Buffers Containing a Base and Its Conjugate Acid
So far, we have seen examples of buffers composed of an acid and its conjugate base 
(where the conjugate base is an ion). A buffer can also be composed of a base and its 
conjugate acid (where the conjugate acid is an ion). For example, a solution containing 
significant amounts of both NH3 and NH4Cl acts as a buffer (Figure 17.4▼). The NH3 
is a weak base that neutralizes small amounts of added acid, and the NH4
+ ion is the 
conjugate acid that neutralizes small amounts of added base.
We calculate the pH of a solution like this in the same way that we calculated the pH 
of a buffer containing a weak acid and its conjugate base. When using the Henderson–
Hasselbalch equation, however, we must first calculate pKa for the conjugate acid of the 
weak base. Recall from Section 16.8 that for a conjugate acid–base pair, Ka * Kb = Kw 
and pKa + pKb = 14. Consequently, we can find pKa of the conjugate acid by subtract-
ing pKb of the weak base from 14. Example 17.4 illustrates the procedure for calculating 
the pH of a buffer composed of a weak base and its conjugate acid.

Use the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pH of a buffer solution that is 0.50 M in NH3 and 0.20 M in 
NH4Cl. For ammonia, pKb = 4.75.
Solution
Since Kb for NH3 (1.76 * 10 - 5) is much smaller than the initial concentrations in 
this problem, you can use the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation to calculate the 
pH of the buffer. First calculate pKa from pKb.
Then substitute the given quantities into the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation 
and calculate pH.
pKa + pKb = 14
 pKa = 14 - pKb
 = 14 - 4.75
 = 9.25

	 17.3	 Buffer Effectiveness: Buffer Range  
and Buffer Capacity
An effective buffer neutralizes small to moderate amounts of added acid or base. 
Recall from Section 17.1, however, that a buffer can be destroyed by the addition of too 
much acid or too much base. What factors influence the effectiveness of a buffer? In 
this section, we examine two such factors: the relative amounts of the acid and conjugate 
base and the absolute concentrations of the acid and conjugate base. We then define the 
capacity of a buffer (how much added acid or base it can effectively neutralize) and the 
range of a buffer (the pH range over which a particular acid and its conjugate base can 
be effective).
Relative Amounts of Acid and Base
A buffer is most effective (most resistant to pH changes) when the concentrations of 
acid and conjugate base are equal. Let’s explore this idea by considering the behavior 
of a generic buffer composed of HA and A- for which pKa = 5.00 and calculating the 
percent change in pH upon addition of 0.010 mol of NaOH for two different 1.0-
liter solutions of this buffer system. Both solutions have 0.20 mol of total acid and 
conjugate base. However, solution I has equal amounts of acid and conjugate base 
(0.10 mol of each), while solution II has much more acid than conjugate base (0.18 
mol HA and 0.020 mol A-). We can calculate the initial pH values of each solution 
using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation. Solution I has an initial pH of 5.00 and 
solution II has an initial pH of 4.05:

As you can see, the buffer with equal amounts of acid and conjugate base is more 
resistant to pH change and is therefore the more effective buffer. A buffer becomes less 
effective as the difference in the relative amounts of acid and conjugate base increases. 
As a guideline, we can say that an effective buffer must have a [base]>[acid] ratio in the 
range of 0.10 to 10. In order for a buffer to be reasonably effective, the relative concentrations of 
acid and conjugate base should not differ by more than a factor of 10.
Absolute Concentrations of the Acid and  
Conjugate Base
A buffer is most effective (most resistant to pH changes) when the concentrations of acid and 
conjugate base are high. Let’s explore this idea by again considering a generic buffer 
composed of HA and A- and a pKa of 5.00 and calculating the percent change in pH 
upon addition of 0.010 mol of NaOH for two 1.0-liter solutions of this buffer system. In 
this case, both the acid and the base in solution I are ten times more concentrated than 
the acid and base in solution II. Both solutions have equal relative amounts of acid and 
conjugate base and therefore have the same initial pH of 5.00:
Solution I: 0.50 mol HA and 0.50 mol A−;  
initial pH = 5.00
Solution II: 0.050 mol HA and 0.050 mol A−;

As you can see, the buffer with greater amounts of acid and conjugate base is more 
resistant to pH changes and therefore is the more effective buffer. The more dilute the 
buffer components, the less effective the buffer.

	
17.3  Buffer Effectiveness: Buffer Range and Buffer Capacity 	
793
Buffer Range
In light of the guideline that the relative concentrations of acid 
and conjugate base should not differ by more than a factor of 10 in 
order for a buffer to be reasonably effective, we can calculate the pH 
range over which a particular acid and its conjugate base make an  
effective buffer. Because the pH of a buffer is given by the Henderson–
Hasselbalch equation, we can calculate the outermost points of the 
effective range as follows:
Weak acid
Conjugate base
Concentrated
buffer
Dilute buffer
A−
AH
Lowest pH for effective buffer occurs when 
the base is one-tenth as concentrated as 
the acid.
 pH = pKa + log [base]
[acid]
 = pKa + log 0.10
 = pKa - 1
Highest pH for effective buffer occurs when 
the base is ten times as concentrated as 
the acid.
 pH = pKa + log [base]
[acid]
 = pKa + log 10
 = pKa + 1
▲ A concentrated buffer contains 
more of the weak acid and its 
conjugate base than a weak buffer 
does. It can therefore neutralize 
more added acid or added base.
The effective range for a buffering system is one pH unit on either side of pKa. For example, 
we can use a weak acid with a pKa of 5.0 (and its conjugate base) to prepare a buffer in the 
range of 4.0–6.0. We can adjust the relative amounts of acid and conjugate base to achieve 
any pH within this range. As we noted earlier, however, the buffer would be most effective 
at pH 5.0 because the buffer components would be exactly equal at that pH. Example 17.5 
demonstrates how to pick an acid>conjugate base system for a buffer and how to calculate 
the relative amounts of acid and conjugate base required for a desired pH.
Example 17.5	
Preparing a Buffer
Which acid would you choose to combine with its sodium salt to make a solution 
buffered at pH 4.25? For the best choice, calculate the ratio of the conjugate base 
to the acid required to attain the desired pH.
chlorous acid (HClO2)  pKa = 1.95 formic acid (HCHO2)
  pKa = 3.74
nitrous acid (HNO2)
  pKa = 3.34 hypochlorous acid (HClO)  pKa = 7.54
Solution
The best choice is formic acid because its pKa lies closest to the desired pH. You 
can calculate the ratio of conjugate base (CHO2
-) to acid (HCHO2) required by  
using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation as follows:
 pH = pKa +  log [base]
[acid]
 4.25 = 3.74 + log [base]
[acid]
 log [base]
[acid] = 4.25 - 3.74
 = 0.51
 [base]
[acid] = 100.51
 = 3.24
For Practice 17.5  Which acid in Example 17.5 would you choose to create a 
buffer with pH = 7.35? If you have 500.0 mL of a 0.10 M solution of the acid, what 
mass of the corresponding sodium salt of the conjugate base do you need to make 
the buffer?

Chapter 17  Aqueous Ionic Equilibrium
Chemistry and Medicine | Buffer Effectiveness in Human Blood
A
s we discussed in Section 17.1, blood contains several 
buffering systems, the most important of which consists 
of carbonic acid and the bicarbonate ion. The concentrations 
of these buffer components in normal blood plasma are 
[HCO3
-] = 0.024 M and [H2CO3] = 0.0012 M. The pKa for 
carbonic acid at body temperature is 6.1.
If we substitute these quantities into the Henderson–
Hasselbalch equation, we can calculate the normal pH of 
blood:
 pH = pKa +  log  [base]
[acid]
 = 6.1 + log  [HCO3
-]
[H2CO3]
 = 6.1 + log  0.024 M
0.0012 M
 = 7.4
Normal blood has a pH of 7.4. Notice that the concentration 
of the bicarbonate ion is 20 times higher than the concentra-
tion of carbonic acid and the pH of the buffer is more than 
one pH unit away from pKa. Why?
The higher bicarbonate ion concentration in blood 
makes the buffer capacity of blood greater for acid than for 
base, which is necessary because the products of metabo-
lism that enter blood are mostly acidic. For example, when 
we exercise, our bodies produce lactic acid (HC3H5O3).  
The lactic acid enters the bloodstream and must be neu-
tralized. The bicarbonate ion neutralizes the lactic acid ac-
cording to the equation:
HCO3
-(aq) + HC3H5O3(aq) ¡ H2CO3(aq) + C3H5O3
-(aq)
An enzyme called carbonic anhydrase then catalyzes the 
conversion of carbonic acid into carbon dioxide and water:
H2CO3(aq) ∆CO2(g) + H2O(l)
We eliminate the carbon dioxide from our blood when we 
breathe. When large amounts of lactic acid are produced, we 
must breathe faster to keep 
up with the need to eliminate 
carbon dioxide. This is why we 
pant when we exert ourselves.

would result in death)?
▶ Normal blood has a pH of 7.4.
Buffer Capacity
Buffer capacity is the amount of acid or base that we can add to a buffer without 
causing a large change in pH. Given what we just learned about the absolute 
concentrations of acid and conjugate base in an effective buffer, we can conclude 
that the buffer capacity increases with increasing absolute concentrations of the buffer 
components. The more concentrated the weak acid and conjugate base that compose 
the buffer, the higher the buffer capacity. In addition, overall buffer capacity increases 
as the relative concentrations of the buffer components become more similar to each other. 
As the ratio of the buffer components gets closer to 1, the overall capacity of the buffer 
(the ability to neutralize added acid and added base) becomes greater. In some cases, 
however, a buffer that must neutralize primarily added acid (or primarily added base) 
may be overweighted in one of the buffer components, as shown in the Chemistry 
and Medicine box in this section.

	 17.4	 Titrations and pH Curves
We first examined acid–base titrations in Section 4.8. In an acid–base titration, a basic 
(or acidic) solution of unknown concentration reacts with an acidic (or basic) solution 
of known concentration. The known solution is slowly added to the unknown one 
while the pH is monitored with either a pH meter or an indicator (a substance whose 
color depends on the pH). As the acid and base combine, they neutralize each other. At 
the equivalence point—the point in the titration when the number of moles of base 
is stoichiometrically equal to the number of moles of acid—the titration is complete. 
When the equivalence point is reached, neither reactant is in excess and the number of 
moles of the reactants are related by the reaction stoichiometry (Figure 17.5▼).
In this section, we examine acid–base titrations more closely, concentrating on the 
pH changes that occur during the titration. A plot of the pH of the solution during a 
titration is known as a titration curve or pH curve. Figure 17.6▼ is a pH curve for the titra-
tion of HCl with NaOH. Before any base is added to the solution, the pH is low (as we 
would expect for a solution of HCl). As the NaOH is added, the solution becomes less 
acidic because the NaOH begins to neutralize the HCl. The point of inflection in the

middle of the curve is the equivalence point. Notice that the pH changes very quickly 
near the equivalence point (small amounts of added base cause large changes in pH). 
Beyond the equivalence point, the solution is basic because the HCl has been completely 
neutralized and excess base is being added to the solution. The exact shape of the pH 
curve depends on several factors, including the strength of the acid or base being 
titrated. Let’s consider several combinations individually.
The Titration of a Strong Acid with a Strong Base
Consider the titration of 25.0 mL of 0.100 M HCl with 0.100 M NaOH. We begin by 
calculating the volume of base required to reach the equivalence point and then the pH 
at several points during the titration.
Volume of NaOH Required to Reach the Equivalence Point
During the titration, the added sodium hydroxide neutralizes the hydrochloric acid:
HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) ¡ H2O(l) + NaCl(aq)
The equivalence point is reached when the number of moles of base added equals the 
number of moles of acid initially in solution. We calculate the amount of acid initially in 
solution from its volume and its concentration:
Initial mol HCl = 0.0250 L * 0.100 mol
1 L
= 0.00250 mol HCl
The amount of NaOH that must be added is 0.00250 mol NaOH. We calculate the vol-
ume of NaOH required from its concentration:
Volume NaOH solution = 0.00250 mol *
1 L
0.100 mol = 0.0250 L
The equivalence point is reached when 25.0 mL of NaOH has been added. In this case, 
the concentrations of both solutions are identical, so the volume of NaOH solution 
required to reach the equivalence point is equal to the volume of the HCl solution that is 
being titrated.
Initial pH (before Adding Any Base)
The initial pH of the solution is simply the pH of a 0.100 M HCl solution. Since HCl is a 
strong acid, the concentration of H3O+ is also 0.100 M and the pH is 1.00:
 pH = -log[H3O+]
 = -log(0.100)
 = 1.00
pH after Adding 5.00 mL NaOH
As NaOH is added to the solution, it neutralizes H3O+:
OH-(aq) + H3O+(aq) ¡ 2 H2O(l)
We calculate the amount of H3O+ at any given point (before the equivalence point) by 
using the reaction stoichiometry—1 mol of NaOH neutralizes 1 mol of H3O+. The initial 
number of moles of H3O+ (as just calculated) is 0.00250 mol. We calculate the number of 
moles of NaOH added at 5.00 mL by multiplying the added volume (in L) by the concen-
tration of the NaOH solution:
mol NaOH added = 0.00500 L * 0.100 mol
1 L
= 0.000500 mol NaOH
The addition of OH- causes the amount of H3O+ to decrease as shown in the following table:

remaining by the total volume (initial volume plus added volume):

0.00200 mol H3O+

The pH is therefore 1.18:
 pH = -log 0.0667
 = 1.18
pH after Adding 10.0, 15.0, and 20.0 mL NaOH
As more NaOH is added, it further neutralizes the H3O+ in the solution. We calculate 
the pH at each of these points in the same way that we calculated the pH at the 5.00 mL 
point. The results are tabulated as follows:
Volume (mL)

pH after Adding 25.0 mL NaOH (Equivalence Point)
The pH at the equivalence point of a strong acid–strong base titration will always be 
7.00 (at 25 °C). At the equivalence point, the strong base has completely neutralized 
the strong acid. The only source of hydronium ions then is the ionization of water. The 
[H3O+] at 25 °C from the ionization of water is 1.00 * 10 - 7 M and the pH is 7.00.
pH after Adding 30.00 mL NaOH
As NaOH is added beyond the equivalence point, it becomes the excess reagent. 
We calculate the amount of OH- at any given point (past the equivalence point) by 
subtracting the initial amount of H3O+ from the amount of added OH-. The number of 
moles of OH- added at 30.00 mL is:
mol OH- added = 0.0300 L * 0.100 mol
1 L
= 0.00300 mol OH-
The number of moles of OH- remaining after neutralization is shown in the 
­following table:

The pH curve for the titration of a strong base with a strong acid is shown in  
Figure 17.7▼. Calculating the points along this curve is very similar to calculating the 
points along the pH curve for the titration of a strong acid with a strong base. The main 
difference is that the curve starts basic and then becomes acidic after the equivalence 
point (instead of vice versa).

(a)	 Begin by calculating the initial amount of NaOH (in

the amount of NaOH.

Calculate the amount of HNO3 (in moles) added at

the neutralization reaction that shows the amount 
of OH - before the addition, the amount of H3O +

Chapter 17  Aqueous Ionic Equilibrium
The Titration of a Weak Acid with a Strong Base
Consider the titration of 25.0 mL of 0.100 M HCHO2 with 0.100 M NaOH:
NaOH(aq) + HCHO2(aq) ¡ H2O(l) + NaCHO2(aq)
The concentrations and the volumes here are identical to those in our previous titration, 
in which we calculated the pH curve for the titration of a strong acid with a strong base. 
The only difference is that HCHO2 is a weak acid rather than a strong one. We begin by 
calculating the volume required to reach the equivalence point of the titration.
Volume of NaOH Required to Reach the Equivalence Point
From the stoichiometry of the equation, we can see that the equivalence point occurs 
when the amount (in moles) of added base equals the amount (in moles) of acid initially 
in solution:
Initial mol HCHO2 = 0.0250 L * 0.100 mol
1 L
= 0.00250 mol HCHO2
The amount of NaOH that must be added is 0.00250 mol NaOH. The volume of NaOH 
required is therefore:
Volume NaOH solution = 0.00250 mol *
1 L
0.100 mol = 0.0250 L NaOH solution
The equivalence point occurs when 25.0 mL of base has been added. Notice that the vol-
ume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point for this weak acid is identical to 
that required for a strong acid. The volume at the equivalence point in an acid–base titration 
does not depend on whether the acid being titrated is a strong acid or a weak acid; it depends 
only on the amount (in moles) of acid present in solution before the titration begins and on the 
concentration of the added base.
Initial pH (before Adding Any Base)
The initial pH of the solution is the pH of a 0.100 M HCHO2 solution. Since HCHO2 is a 
weak acid, we calculate the concentration of H3O+ and the pH by doing an equilibrium 
problem for the ionization of HCHO2. The procedure for solving weak acid ionization 
problems is given in Examples 16.5 and 16.6. We show a highly condensed calculation 
here (Ka  for HCHO2 is 1.8 * 10 - 4):

Therefore, [H3O+] = 4.24 * 10 - 3 M.
 pH = -log(4.24 * 10 - 3)
 = 2.37
Notice that the pH is initially at a higher value (less acidic) than it is for a strong acid of 
the same concentration, as we would expect because the acid is weak.
pH after Adding 5.00 mL NaOH
When titrating a weak acid with a strong base, the added NaOH converts a stoichiometric 
amount of the acid into its conjugate base. As we calculated previously, 5.00 mL of the 0.100 M 
NaOH solution contains 0.000500 mol OH-. When the 0.000500 mol OH- is added to the

weak acid solution, the OH- reacts stoichiometrically with HCHO2 causing the amount of 
HCHO2 to decrease by 0.000500 mol and the amount of CHO2
- to increase by 0.000500 mol.
This is very similar to what happens when we add strong base to a buffer, and it is 
summarized in the following table:

Notice that, after the addition, the solution contains significant amounts of both an 
acid (HCHO2) and its conjugate base (CHO2
-)—the solution is now a buffer. To calculate 
the pH of a buffer (when the x is small approximation applies as it does here), we can use 
the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation and pKa for HCHO2 (which is 3.74):
 pH = pKa + log [base]
[acid]
 = 3.74 + log 0.000500
0.00200
 = 3.74 - 0.60
 = 3.14
pH after Adding 10.0, 12.5, 15.0, and 20.0 mL NaOH
As more NaOH is added, it converts more HCHO2 into CHO2
-. We calculate the relative 
amounts of HCHO2 and CHO2
- at each of these volumes using the reaction stoichiometry 
and then calculate the pH of the resulting buffer using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation 
(as we did for the pH at 5.00 mL). The amounts of HCHO2 and CHO2
- (after addition of the 
OH-) at each volume and the corresponding values of pH are tabulated as follows:

As the titration proceeds, more of the HCHO2 is converted to the conjugate base 
(CHO2
-). Notice that an added NaOH volume of 12.5 mL corresponds to one-half of the 
equivalence point. At this volume, one-half of the initial amount of HCHO2 has been 
converted to CHO2
-, resulting in equal amounts of weak acid and conjugate base. For any 
buffer in which the amounts of weak acid and conjugate base are equal, the pH = pKa:
 pH = pKa + log [base]

If [base] = [acid], then [base]>[acid] = 1.

The solution is no longer a buffer (it no longer contains significant amounts of both a 
weak acid and its conjugate base). Instead, the solution contains an ion (CHO2
-) acting as 
a weak base. We discussed how to calculate the pH of solutions such as this in Section 16.8 
(see Example 16.14) by solving  an equilibrium problem involving the ionization of water 
by the weak base (CHO2
-):
CHO2
-(aq) + H2O(l) ∆HCHO2(aq) + OH-(aq)
We calculate the initial concentration of CHO2
- for the equilibrium problem by 
dividing the number of moles of CHO2
- (0.00250 mol) by the total volume at the equiva-
lence point (initial volume plus added volume):

 [H3O+][OH-] = Kw = 1.0 * 10 - 14
 [H3O+](1.7 * 10 - 6) = 1.0 * 10 - 14
 [H3O+] = 5.9 * 10 - 9 M
 pH = -log[H3O+]
 = -log(5.9 * 10 - 9)
 = 8.23
Notice that the pH at the equivalence point is not neutral but basic. The titration of a 
weak acid by a strong base always has a basic equivalence point because, at the equivalence 
point, all of the acid has been converted into its conjugate base, resulting in a weakly 
basic solution.

The solution is now a mixture of a strong base (NaOH) and a weak base (CHO2
-). 
The strong base completely overwhelms the weak base, and we can calculate the pH by 
considering the strong base alone (as we did for the titration of a strong acid and a strong 
base). We calculate the OH- concentration by dividing the amount of OH- remaining 
by the total volume (initial volume plus added volume):
[OH-] =
0.00050 mol OH-
0.0250 L + 0.0300 L = 0.0091 M
We can then calculate the [H3O+] and pH:
 [H3O+][OH-] = 10 - 14
 [H3O+] = 10-14
[OH-] =
10-14
0.0091 = 1.1 * 10-12 M
 pH = -log(1.10 * 10-12)
 = 11.96
pH after Adding 35.0, 40.0, and 50.0 mL NaOH
As more NaOH is added, the basicity of the solution increases further. We calculate the 
pH at each of these volumes in the same way we calculated the pH at 30.00 mL of added 
NaOH. The results are tabulated as follows:

The Overall pH Curve
The overall pH curve for the titration of a weak acid with a strong base has a characteristic 
S-shape similar to that for the titration of a strong acid with a strong base. The main 
difference is that the equivalence point pH is basic (not neutral). Notice that calculating 
the pH in different regions throughout the titration involves working different kinds of 
acid–base problems, all of which we have encountered before.

Chapter 17  Aqueous Ionic Equilibrium
Summarizing Titration of a Weak Acid with a Strong Base:
▶
▶
The initial pH is that of the weak acid solution to be titrated. Calculate the pH by 
working an equilibrium problem (similar to Examples 16.5 and 16.6) using the con-
centration of the weak acid as the initial concentration.
▶
▶
Between the initial pH and the equivalence point, the solution becomes a buffer. Use 
the reaction stoichiometry to calculate the amounts of each buffer component and 
then use the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pH (as in Example 17.3).
▶
▶
Halfway to the equivalence point, the buffer components are exactly equal and 
pH = pKa.
▶
▶
At the equivalence point, the acid has all been converted into its conjugate base. 
Calculate the pH by working an equilibrium problem for the ionization of water by 
the ion acting as a weak base (similar to Example 16.14). (Calculate the concentra-
tion of the ion acting as a weak base by dividing the number of moles of the ion by 
the total volume at the equivalence point.)
▶
▶
Beyond the equivalence point, OH- is in excess. Ignore the weak base and calculate 
the [OH-] by subtracting the initial number of moles of the weak acid from the 
number of moles of added OH- and dividing by the total volume.
A 40.0-mL sample of 0.100 M HNO2 is titrated with 0.200 M KOH. Calculate:
(a)	 the volume required to reach the equivalence point
(b)	 the pH after adding 5.00 mL of KOH
(c)	 the pH at one-half the equivalence point
Solution
(a)	 The equivalence point occurs when the 
amount (in moles) of added base equals 
the amount (in moles) of acid initially 
in the solution. Begin by calculating 
the amount (in moles) of acid initially 
in the solution. The amount (in moles) 
of KOH that must be added is equal to 
the amount of the weak acid.
	
Calculate the volume of KOH required 
from the number of moles of KOH and 
the molarity.
 mol HNO2 = 0.0400 L * 0.100 mol
L 
 = 4.00 * 10 - 3 mol
mol KOH required = 4.00 * 10 - 3 mol
 volume KOH solution = 4.00 * 10 - 3 mol *
1 L
0.200 mol 
 = 0.0200 L KOH solution
 = 20.0 mL KOH solution
(b)	 Use the concentration of the KOH solu-
tion to calculate the amount (in moles) 
of OH- in 5.00 mL of the solution.
	
Prepare a table showing the amounts 
of HNO2 and NO2
- before and after the 
addition of 5.00 mL KOH. The addition 
of the KOH stoichiometrically reduces 
the concentration of HNO2 and in-
creases the concentration of NO2
-.
	
Since the solution now contains 
­significant amounts of a weak acid and 
its conjugate base, use the Henderson–
Hasselbalch equation and pKa for HNO2 
(which is 3.34) to calculate the pH of 
the solution.

(c)	 At one-half the equivalence point, the 
amount of added base is exactly one-
half the initial amount of acid. The 
base converts exactly half of the HNO2 
into NO2
-, resulting in equal amounts 
of the weak acid and its conjugate 
base. The pH is therefore equal to pKa.

The Titration of a Weak Base with a Strong Acid
The pH curve for the titration of a weak base with a strong acid is shown in Figure 17.8▼. 
Calculating the points along this curve is very similar to calculating the points along 
the pH curve for the titration of a weak acid with a strong base (which we just did). The 
main differences are that the curve starts basic and has an acidic equivalence point. 
We calculate the pH in the buffer region using pH = pKa + log [base]
[acid] where the pKa 
corresponds to the conjugate acid of the base being titrated.

The first equivalence point in the titration curve represents the titration of the first 
proton, whereas the second equivalence point represents the titration of the second pro-
ton. Notice that the volume required to reach the first equivalence point is identical to 
the volume required to reach the second point because the number of moles of H2SO3 in 
the first step determines the number of moles of HSO3
- in the second step.

Acid–Base Titrations  Consider these three titrations:
(i)	
the titration of 25.0 mL of a 0.100 M monoprotic weak acid with 0.100 M NaOH
(ii)	 the titration of 25.0 mL of a 0.100 M diprotic weak acid with 0.100 M NaOH
(iii)	the titration of 25.0 mL of a 0.100 M strong acid with 0.100 M NaOH
Which statement is most likely to be true?
(a)	 All three titrations have the same initial pH.
(b)	 All three titrations have the same pH at their first equivalence points.
(c)	 All three titrations require the same volume of NaOH to reach their first 
­equivalence points.
 
Indicators: pH-Dependent Colors
We can monitor the pH of a titration with either a pH meter or an indicator. The 
direct monitoring of pH with a meter yields data like the pH curves we have examined 
previously, allowing determination of the equivalence point from the pH curve itself, 
as shown in Figure 17.10▼. With an indicator, we rely on the point where the indicator 
changes color—called the endpoint—to determine the equivalence point, as shown 

	
17.4  Titrations and pH Curves

in Figure 17.11▲. With the correct indicator, the endpoint of the titration (indicated by 
the color change) occurs at the equivalence point (when the amount of acid equals the 
amount of base).
An indicator is itself a weak organic acid that is a different color than its conjugate 
base. For example, phenolphthalein (whose structure is shown in Figure 17.12▼) is a 
common indicator whose acid form is colorless and conjugate base form is pink. If we let 
HIn represent the acid form of a generic indicator and In- the conjugate base form, we 
have the following equilibrium:
HIn(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) +  In -(aq)
	
color 1	
color 2
Because its color is intense, only a small amount of indicator is required—an amount 
that will not affect the pH of the solution or the equivalence point of the neutralization 
reaction. When the [H3O+] changes during the titration, the equilibrium shifts in response. 
At low pH, the [H3O+] is high and the equilibrium lies far to the left, resulting in a solution 
of color 1. As the titration proceeds, the [H3O+] decreases, shifting the equilibrium to the 
right. Since the pH change is large near the equivalence point of the titration, there is a

large change in [H3O+] near the equivalence point. Provided that the correct indicator is 
chosen, there will also be a correspondingly significant change in color. For the titration of 
a strong acid with a strong base, one drop of the base near the endpoint is usually enough 
to change the indicator from color 1 to color 2.
The color of a solution containing an indicator depends on the relative concentra-
tions of HIn and In-. As a useful guideline, we can assume the following:
If [In-]
[HIn] = 1, the indicator solution will be intermediate in color.
If [In-]
[HIn] 7 10, the indicator solution will be the color of In-.
If [In-]
[HIn] 6 0.1, the indicator solution will be the color of HIn.
From the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, we can derive an expression for the 
ratio of [In-]>[HIn]:
 pH = pKa + log [base]
[acid]
 = pKa + log [In-]
[HIn]
log [In-]
[HIn] = pH - pKa
[In-]
[HIn] = 10(pH - pKa)
Consider the following three pH values relative to pKa and the corresponding colors 
of the indicator solution:
pH (relative to pKa)
[In−]>[HIn] ratio
Color of Indicator Solution
pH = pKa

[Hin] = 100 = 1

Color of in-
pH = pKa - 1

[Hin] = 10 - 1 = 0.10
Color of HIn
When the pH of the solution equals the pKa of the indicator, the solu-
tion has an intermediate color. When the pH is 1 unit (or more) above 
pKa, the indicator is the color of In-, and when the pH is 1 unit (or 
more) below pKa, the indicator is the color of HIn. As you can see, the 
indicator changes color within a range of two pH units centered at pKa 
(Figure 17.13◀). Table 17.1 shows various indicators and their colors as a 
function of pH.

17.5  Solubility Equilibria and the Solubility Product Constant	
809
	 17.5	 Solubility Equilibria and the Solubility 
Product Constant
Recall from Chapter 4 that a compound is considered soluble if it dissolves in water and 
insoluble if it does not. Recall also that, with the solubility rules in Table 4.1, we were able 
to classify ionic compounds simply as soluble or insoluble. Now we have the tools to 
examine degrees of solubility.
We can better understand the solubility of an ionic compound by applying the con-
cept of equilibrium to the process of dissolution. For example, we can represent the dis-
solution of calcium fluoride in water as an equilibrium:
CaF2(s) ∆Ca2 +(aq) + 2 F-(aq)
The equilibrium constant for a chemical equation representing the dissolution of 
an ionic compound is the solubility product constant (Ksp). For CaF2, the expres-
sion of the solubility product constant is:
Ksp = [Ca2 +][F-]2
Notice that, as we discussed in Section 15.5, solids are omitted from the equilibrium 
expression because the concentration of a solid is constant (it is determined by its den-
sity and does not change when more solid is added).
The value of Ksp is a measure of the solubility of a compound. Table 17.2 lists the 
values of Ksp for a number of ionic compounds. A more complete list can be found in 
Appendix IIC.
Ksp and Molar Solubility
Recall from Section 13.2 that the  solubility of a compound is the quantity of the 
compound that dissolves in a certain amount of liquid. The molar solubility is the 
solubility in units of moles per liter (mol>L). We can calculate the molar solubility of a 
compound directly from Ksp.
Consider silver chloride:
AgCl(s) ∆Ag+(aq) + Cl-(aq)  Ksp = 1.77 * 10 - 10

Table 17.2  Selected Solubility Product Constants (Ksp) at 25 °C
Notice that Ksp is not the molar solubility, but the solubility product constant. The 
solubility product constant has only one value at a given temperature. The solubility, 
however, can have different values in different kinds of solutions. For example, due 
to the common ion effect, the solubility of AgCl in pure water is different from its 
solubility in an NaCl solution, even though the solubility product constant is the 
same for both solutions. Notice also that the solubility of AgCl is directly related (by 
the reaction stoichiometry) to the amount of Ag+ or Cl- present in solution when 
equilibrium is reached. Consequently, finding molar solubility from Ksp involves 
solving an equilibrium problem.
For AgCl, we set up an ICE table for the dissolution of AgCl into its ions in pure 
water:

S
We let S represent the concentration of AgCl that dissolves (which is the molar solubil-
ity) and then represent the concentrations of the ions formed in terms of S. In this case, 
for every 1 mol of AgCl that dissolves, 1 mol of Ag+ and 1 mol of Cl- are produced. There-
fore, the concentrations of Ag+ or Cl- present in solution are equal to S. Substituting the 
equilibrium concentrations of Ag+ and Cl- into the expression for the solubility product 
constant, we get:
 Ksp = [Ag+][Cl-]
 = S * S
 = S2
Therefore,
 S = 2Ksp
 = 21.77 * 10 - 10
 = 1.33 * 10 - 5 M
The molar solubility of AgCl is 1.33 * 10 - 5 mol per liter.
Alternatively, the variable x can be 
used in place of S, as it was for other 
equilibrium calculations.

Chemistry IN YOUR DAY | Hard Water
I
n many parts of the United States, significant concentrations of CaCO3 
and MgCO3 dissolve into rainwater runoff as it flows through soils rich 
in these compounds. Water containing dissolved calcium and magnesium 
ions is known as hard water. Hard water is not a health hazard because 
both calcium and magnesium are part of a healthy diet. However, their 
presence in water can be a nuisance. Because of their relatively low 
­solubility, hard water becomes saturated with CaCO3 and MgCO3 as it 
evaporates. If evaporation continues, some dissolved ions precipitate out 
as salts. These precipitates show up as scaly deposits on faucets, sinks, 
or cookware. Washing cars or dishes with hard water leaves spots of 
CaCO3 and MgCO3.
Water can be softened with water softeners. These devices replace the 
Ca2 + and Mg2 + ions present in hard water with ions such as K+ or Na+. 
Since potassium and sodium salts are soluble, they do not form scaly 
deposits in the way that Ca2 + and Mg2 + ions do. However, 
when sodium is used to soften drinking 
water, the resulting water is high in 
sodium content, a disadvantage 
to those who must control their 
­sodium intake due to high blood 
pressure.
Q u e s t i o n
Use the Ksp values from Table 17.2 to calculate the molar solubility of CaCO3 and 
MgCO3. What mass of CaCO3 (in grams) is in 5 L of water that is saturated with 
CaCO3?
▲ The water in reservoirs where the soil is rich 
in limestone (calcium carbonate) contains Ca2 + 
ions. This so-called hard water contains dissolved 
CaCO3 and MgCO3. When hard water evaporates, 
it can leave deposits of these salts on the shores 
of lakes and reservoirs (at left) and on plumbing 
fixtures (such as the pipe shown here).

Ksp and Relative Solubility
As we have just seen, molar solubility and Ksp are related, and each can be calculated from 
the other; however, we cannot generally use the Ksp values of two different compounds 
to directly compare their relative solubilities.
For example, consider the following compounds, their Ksp values, and their molar 
solubilities:
Compound
Ksp
Solubility
Mg(OH)2
2.06 * 10 - 13
3.72 * 10 - 5 M
FeCO3
3.07 * 10 - 11
5.54 * 10 - 6 M
Magnesium hydroxide has a smaller Ksp than iron(II) carbonate, but a higher molar 
solubility. Why? The relationship between Ksp and molar solubility depends on the 
stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction. Consequently, any direct comparison of 
Ksp values for different compounds can only be made if the compounds have the same 
dissociation stoichiometry.
Consider the following compounds with the same dissociation stoichiometry, their 
Ksp values, and their molar solubilities:
Compound
Ksp
Solubility
Mg(OH)2
2.06 * 10 - 13
3.72 * 10 - 5 M
CaF2
1.46 * 10 - 10
3.32 * 10 - 4 M 
In this case, magnesium hydroxide and calcium fluoride have the same dissociation stoi-
chiometry (1 mol of each compound produces 3 mol of dissolved ions); therefore, the 
Ksp values can be directly compared as a measure of relative solubility.
The Effect of a Common Ion on Solubility
How is the solubility of an ionic compound affected when the compound is dissolved 
in a solution that already contains one of its ions? For example, what is the solubility 

	
17.5  Solubility Equilibria and the Solubility Product Constant	
813
of CaF2 in a solution that is 0.100 M in NaF? We can determine the change in 
solubility by considering the common ion effect, which we first encountered in 
Section 17.2. We represent the dissociation of CaF2 in a 0.100 M NaF solution as 
shown in the right margin.
In accordance with Le Châtelier’s principle, the presence of the F- ion in 
solution causes the equilibrium to shift to the left (compared to its position in 
pure water), which means that less CaF2 dissolves—that is, its solubility is 
decreased.
In general, the solubility of an ionic compound is lower in a 
­solution containing a common ion than in pure water.
We can calculate the exact value of the solubility by working an equilibrium problem in 
which the concentration of the common ion is accounted for in the initial conditions, 
as shown in Example 17.10.

Calculating Molar Solubility in the Presence of a Common Ion
What is the molar solubility of CaF2 in a solution containing 0.100 M NaF?
Solution
Begin by writing the reaction by which solid CaF2 dissolves into its 
constituent aqueous ions. Write the corresponding expression for Ksp.
CaF2(s) ∆Ca2 +(aq) + 2 F-(aq)
Ksp = [Ca2 +][F-]2 
Use the stoichiometry of the reaction to prepare an ICE table showing 
the initial concentration of the common ion. Fill in the equilibrium 
concentrations of Ca2 + and F- relative to S, the amount of CaF2 that 
dissolves.

Substitute the equilibrium expressions for [Ca2 +] and [F-] from the 
previous step into the expression for Ksp. Because Ksp is small, you 
can make the approximation that 2S is much less than 0.100 and will 
therefore be insignificant when added to 0.100 (this is similar to the x 
is small approximation in equilibrium problems).
 Ksp = [Ca2 +][F-]2
 = S(0.100 + 2S)2  (S is small)
 = S(0.100)2
Solve for S and substitute the numerical value of Ksp (from Table 17.2) to 
calculate S. Note that the calculated value of S is indeed small ­compared 
to 0.100; our approximation is valid.
 Ksp = S(0.100)2
 S =

For comparison, the molar solubility of CaF2 in pure water is 3.32 * 10 - 4 M, which means CaF2 is over 20,000 times more 
soluble in water than in the NaF solution. (Confirm this for yourself by calculating its solubility in pure water from the 
value of Ksp.)

Chapter 17  Aqueous Ionic Equilibrium
The Effect of pH on Solubility
The pH of a solution can affect the solubility of a compound in that solution. For example, 
consider the dissociation of Mg(OH)2, the active ingredient in milk of magnesia:
Mg(OH)2(s) ∆Mg2 +(aq) + 2 OH-(aq)
The solubility of this compound is highly dependent on the pH of the solution into 
which it dissolves. If the pH is high, then the concentration of OH- in the solution is 
high. In accordance with the common ion effect, this shifts the equilibrium to the left, 
lowering the solubility:
Mg2+(aq)
2 OH−(aq)
+
Equilibrium shifts left
High [OH−] 
Mg(OH)2(s)
If the pH is low, then the concentration of H3O+(aq) in the solution is high. As the 
Mg(OH)2 dissolves, these H3O+ ions neutralize the newly dissolved OH- ions, driving 
the reaction to the right:
Mg(OH)2(s)
Mg2+(aq)
2 OH−(aq)
+
Equilibrium shifts right
H3O+ reacts with OH−
Consequently, the solubility of Mg(OH)2 in an acidic solution is higher than in a 
pH-neutral or basic solution.
In general, the solubility of an ionic compound with a strongly 
basic or weakly basic anion increases with increasing acidity (de-
creasing pH).
Common basic anions include OH-, S2 -, and CO3
2-. Therefore, hydroxides, sul-
fides, and carbonates are more soluble in acidic water than in pure water. Since rainwater 
is naturally acidic due to dissolved carbon dioxide, it can dissolve rocks high in lime-
stone (CaCO3) as it flows through the ground. This process sometimes results in huge 
underground caverns such as those at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico. 
Dripping water saturated in CaCO3 within the cave creates the dramatic mineral forma-
tions known as stalagmites and stalactites.
▲ Stalactites (which hang from the 
ceiling) and stalagmites (which grow 
up from the ground) form as calcium 
carbonate precipitates out of the 
water evaporating in underground 
caves.

(a)	 The solubility of BaF2 is greater in an acidic solution than it is in a netural 
solution because the F- ion is a weak base. (F- is the conjugate base of the 
weak acid HF and is therefore a weak base.)
(b)	 The solubility of AgI is not greater in an acidic solution than it is in a netural 
solution because the I- is not a base. (I- is the conjugate base of the strong acid 
HI and is therefore pH-neutral.)
(c)	 The solubility of Ca(OH)2 is greater in an acidic solution than it is in a netural 
solution because the OH- ion is a strong base.

17.6  Precipitation	
815
	 17.6	 Precipitation
In Chapter 4, we learned that a  precipitation reaction can occur when we mix two 
solutions containing ionic compounds when one of the possible cross products—
the combination of a cation from one solution and the anion from the other—is 
insoluble. In this chapter, however, we have seen that the terms soluble and insoluble 
are extremes in a continuous range of solubility—many compounds are slightly 
soluble, and even those that we categorize as insoluble in Chapter 4 actually have 
some limited degree of solubility (they have very small solubility product constants).
We can better understand precipitation reactions by revisiting a concept 
from Chapter 15— the reaction quotient (Q). The reaction quotient for the reac-
tion by which an ionic compound dissolves is the product of the concentrations 
of the ionic components raised to their stoichiometric coefficients. For example, 
consider the reaction by which CaF2 dissolves:
CaF2(s) ∆Ca2 +(aq) + 2 F-(aq)
The reaction quotient for this reaction is:
Q = [Ca2 +][F-]2
The difference between Q and Ksp is that Ksp is the value of this product at equilib-
rium only, whereas Q is the value of the product under any conditions. We can therefore 
use the value of Q to compare a solution containing any concentrations of the compo-
nent ions to a solution that is at equilibrium.
Consider a solution of calcium fluoride in which Q is less than Ksp. Recall from 
Chapter 15 that if Q is less than Ksp, the reaction will proceed to the right (toward prod-
ucts). Consequently, as long as solid CaF2 is present, the CaF2 will continue to dissolve. If 
all of the solid has already dissolved, the solution will simply remain as it is, containing 
less than the equilibrium amount of the dissolved ions. Such a solution is an unsaturated 
solution. If more solid is added to an unsaturated solution, it will dissolve, as long as Q 
remains less than Ksp.
Now consider a solution in which Q is exactly equal to Ksp. In this case, the reaction 
is at equilibrium and does not make progress in either direction. Such a solution most 
likely contains at least a small amount of the solid in equilibrium with its component 
ions. However, the amount of solid may be too small to be visible. Such a solution is a 
saturated solution.
Finally, consider a solution in which Q is greater than Ksp. In this case, the reaction 
proceeds to the left (toward the reactants) and solid calcium fluoride forms from the dis-
solved calcium and fluoride ions. In other words, the solid normally precipitates out of a 
solution in which Q is greater than Ksp. Under certain circumstances, however, Q can 
remain greater than Ksp for an unlimited period of time. Such a solution, called a super-
saturated solution, is unstable and forms a precipitate 
when sufficiently disturbed. Figure 17.14▶ shows a 
supersaturated solution of sodium acetate. When a 
small seed crystal of solid sodium acetate is dropped 
into the solution, it triggers the precipitation 
reaction.
Summarizing the Relationship of Q and Ksp in 
Solutions Containing an Ionic Compound:
▶
▶
If Q 6 Ksp, the solution is unsaturated and more 
of the solid ionic compound can dissolve in the 
solution.
▶
▶
If Q = Ksp, the solution is saturated. The solu-
tion is holding the equilibrium amount of the 
dissolved ions, and additional solid does not dis-
solve in the solution.
▶
▶
If Q 7 Ksp, the solution is supersaturated. Under 
most circumstances, the excess solid precipitates 
out of a supersaturated solution.

Chapter 17  Aqueous Ionic Equilibrium
We can use Q to predict whether a precipitation reaction will occur upon the mix-
ing of two solutions containing dissolved ionic compounds. For example, consider 
mixing a silver nitrate solution with a potassium iodide solution to form a mixture 
that is 0.010 M in AgNO3 and 0.015 M in KI. Will a precipitate form in the newly mixed 
solution? From Chapter 4 we  know that one of the cross products, KNO3, is soluble 
and will therefore not precipitate. The other cross product, AgI, may precipitate if the 
concentrations of Ag+ and I- are high enough in the newly mixed solution: we can 
compare Q to Ksp  to determine if a precipitate will form. For AgI, Ksp = 8.51 * 10 - 17. 
For the newly mixed solution, [Ag+] = 0.010 M and [I-] = 0.015 M. We calculate Q as 
follows:
Q = [Ag+][I-] = (0.010)(0.015) = 1.5 * 10 - 4
The value of Q is much greater than Ksp; therefore, AgI should precipitate out of the 
newly mixed solution.
Example 17.12	
Predicting Precipitation Reactions by Comparing Q and Ksp
A solution containing lead(II) nitrate is mixed with one containing sodium bromide to form a solution that is 0.0150 M 
in Pb(NO3)2 and 0.00350 M in NaBr. Does a precipitate form in the newly mixed solution?
Solution
First, determine the possible cross products and their Ksp 
values (Table 17.2). Any cross products that are soluble do not 
precipitate (see Table 4.1).
Possible cross products:
NaNO3 soluble
PbBr2    Ksp = 4.67 * 10 - 6
Calculate Q and compare it to Ksp. A precipitate will only form 
if Q 7 Ksp.
 Q = [Pb2 +][Br-]2
 = (0.0150)(0.00350)2
 = 1.84 * 10 - 7
 Q 6 Ksp; therefore no precipitate forms.
For Practice 17.12  If the original solutions in Example 17.12 are concentrated through evaporation and mixed 
again to form a solution that is 0.0600 M in Pb(NO3)2 and 0.0158 M in NaBr, will a precipitate form in this newly mixed 
solution?
Selective Precipitation
A solution may contain several different dissolved metal cations that can often be 
separated by selective precipitation, a process involving the addition of a reagent 
that forms a precipitate with one of the dissolved cations but not the others. For 
example, seawater contains dissolved magnesium and calcium cations with the 
concentrations [Mg2 +] = 0.059 M and [Ca2 +] = 0.011 M. We can separate these ions 
by adding a reagent that will precipitate one of the ions but not the other. From Table 
17.2, we find that Mg(OH)2 has a Ksp of 2.06 * 10 - 13 and that Ca(OH)2 has a Ksp of 
4.68 * 10 - 6, indicating that the hydroxide ion forms a precipitate with magnesium 
at a much lower concentration than it does with calcium. Consequently, a soluble 
hydroxide—such as KOH or NaOH—is a good choice for the precipitating reagent. 
When we add an appropriate amount of KOH or NaOH to seawater, the hydroxide 
ion causes the precipitation of Mg(OH)2 (the compound with the lowest Ksp) but not 
Ca(OH)2. Calculations for this selective precipitation are shown in Examples 17.13 and 
17.14. In these calculations, you compare Q to Ksp to determine the concentration that 
triggers precipitation.
The difference in Ksp values required 
for selective precipitation is a factor 
of at least 103.

	
17.6  Precipitation

Example 17.13	
Finding the Minimum Required Reagent Concentration for  
Selective Precipitation
The magnesium and calcium ions present in seawater ([Mg2 +] = 0.059 M and [Ca2 +] = 0.011 M) can be separated by 
selective precipitation with KOH. What minimum [OH-] triggers the precipitation of the Mg2 + ion?
Solution
The precipitation commences when the value of Q for the precipitating 
compound just equals the value of Ksp. Set the expression for Q for mag-
nesium hydroxide equal to the value of Ksp, and solve for [OH-]. This is 
the concentration above which Mg(OH)2  precipitates.
 Q = [Mg2 +][OH-]2
 = (0.059)[OH-]2
When Q = Ksp,
(0.059)[OH-]2 = Ksp = 2.06 * 10 - 13
 [OH-]2 = 2.06 * 10 - 13
0.059
 [OH-] = 1.9 * 10 - 6 M
For Practice 17.13  If the concentration of Mg2 + in the previous solution was 0.025 M, what minimum [OH-]  
triggers precipitation of the Mg2 + ion?
—Continued on the next page
Example 17.14	
Finding the Concentrations of Ions Left in Solution after  
Selective Precipitation
You add potassium hydroxide to the solution in Example 17.13. When the [OH-] reaches 1.9 * 10 - 6 M (as you just 
calculated), magnesium hydroxide begins to precipitate out of solution. As you continue to add KOH, the magnesium 
hydroxide continues to precipitate. However, at some point, the [OH-] becomes high enough to begin to precipitate the 
calcium ions as well. What is the concentration of Mg2 + when Ca2 + begins to precipitate?
Solution
First, find the OH- concentration at which Ca2 + begins to 
­precipitate by writing the expression for Q for calcium hydroxide 
and substituting the concentration of Ca2 + from Example 17.13.
 Q = [Ca2 +][OH-]2
 = (0.011)[OH-]2
Set the expression for Q equal to the value of Ksp for ­calcium 
hydroxide and solve for [OH-]. This is the concentration above 
which Ca(OH)2 precipitates.
When Q = Ksp,
(0.011)[OH - 2] = Ksp = 4.68 * 10 - 6
 [OH-]2 = 4.68 * 10 - 6
0.011
 [OH-] = 2.06 * 10 - 2 M
Find the concentration of Mg2 + when OH- reaches the 
­concentration you just calculated by writing the expression for 
Q for magnesium hydroxide and substituting the concentration of 
OH- that you just calculated. Then set the expression for Q equal 
to the value of Ksp for magnesium hydroxide and solve for [Mg2 +]. 
This is the concentration of Mg2 + that remains when Ca(OH)2 
begins to precipitate.
 Q = [Mg2 +][OH-]2
 = [Mg2 +](2.06 * 10 - 2)2
When Q = Ksp,
[Mg2 +](2.06 * 10 - 2)2 = Ksp = 2.06 * 10 - 13
 [Mg2 +] =
2.06 * 10 - 13
(2.06 * 10 - 2)2
 [Mg2 +] = 4.9 * 10 - 10 M

Continued—
As you can see from the results, the selective precipitation worked very well. The concentration of Mg2 + dropped from 
0.059 M to 4.9 * 10 - 10 M before any calcium began to precipitate, which means that the process separated 99.99% of 
the magnesium out of the solution.

	 17.7	 Qualitative Chemical Analysis
Selective precipitation as discussed in Section 17.6 can be used in a systematic way to 
determine which metal ions are present in an unknown solution. This method is 
known as qualitative analysis. The word qualitative means involving quality or kind. 
Qualitative analysis involves finding the kind of ions present in the solution. This 
stands in contrast to quantitative analysis, which is concerned with quantity, or the 
amounts of substances in a solution or mixture.
In the past, qualitative analysis by selective precipitation was used extensively to 
determine the metals present in a sample. This process—dubbed wet chemistry because it 
involves the mixing of many aqueous solutions in the lab—has been replaced by more 
precise and less time-intensive instrumental techniques. Nonetheless, both for the sake 
of history and also because of the importance of the principles involved, we now exam-
ine a traditional qualitative analysis scheme. You may use such a scheme in your general 
chemistry laboratory as an exercise in qualitative analysis.
The basic idea behind qualitative analysis is straightforward. A sample containing a 
mixture of metal cations is subjected to the addition of several precipitating agents. At 
each step, some of the metal cations—those that form insoluble compounds with the 
precipitating agent—precipitate from the mixture and are separated out as solids. The 
remaining aqueous mixture is then subjected to the next precipitating agent, and so on 
(Figure 17.15▼).

step, and the solid is set aside for subsequent analysis. We examine each group separately.

◀ Figure 17.16  A General 
Qualitative Analysis Scheme 
Group 1: Insoluble Chlorides
In the first step, the aqueous mixture containing the metal cations is treated with  
6 M HCl. Since most chlorides are soluble, the chloride ions do not form a precipitate 
with the majority of the cations in the mixture. However, Ag+, Pb2 +, and Hg2
2 + do form 
insoluble chlorides. So, if any of those metal cations are present, they precipitate out. 
The absence of a precipitate constitutes a negative test for Ag+, Pb2 +, and Hg2
2 +. If a 
precipitate forms, one or more of these ions is present. After the solid is separated from 
the liquid, the solution is ready for the next step.
Group 2: Acid-Insoluble Sulfides
In the second step, the acidic aqueous mixture containing the remaining metal cations 
is treated with H2S, a weak diprotic acid that dissociates in two steps:
 H2S ∆H+ + HS-
 HS- ∆H+ + S2 -
The concentration of S2 - ions in an H2S solution is pH-dependent. At low pH (high H+ 
concentration) the equilibria shift left, minimizing the amount of available S2 -. At high 
pH (low H+ concentration) the equilbria shift right, maximizing the amount of available 
S2 -. At this stage, the solution is acidic (from the addition of HCl in the previous step), 

820	
Chapter 17  Aqueous Ionic Equilibrium
and the concentration of S2- in solution is relatively low. Only the most insoluble metal 
sulfides (those with the smallest Ksp values) precipitate under these conditions. These 
include Hg2+, Cd2+, Bi3+, Cu2+, Sn4+, As3+, Pb2+ and Sb3+. If any of these metal cations are 
present, they precipitate out as sulfides. After the solid is separated from the liquid, the 
solution is ready for the next step.
Group 3: Base-Insoluble Sulfides and Hydroxides
In the third step, additional base and H2S are added to the acidic aqueous mixture 
containing the remaining metal cations. The added base reacts with acid, shifting the 
H2S ionization equilibria to the right and creating a higher S2- concentration. This 
causes the precipitation of those sulfides that were too soluble to precipitate out in the 
previous step but not soluble enough to prevent precipitation with the higher sulfide 
ion concentration. The ions that precipitate as sulfides at this point (if they are present) 
are Fe2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+. In addition, the additional base causes Cr3+, Fe3+, 
and Al3+  to precipitate as hydroxides. After the solid is separated from the liquid, the 
solution is ready for the next step.
Group 4: Insoluble Phosphates
At this stage, all of the cations have precipitated except those belonging to the alkali 
metal family (group 1A in the periodic table) and the alkaline earth metal family (group 
2A in the periodic table). The alkaline earth metal cations can be precipitated by adding 
(NH4)2HPO4 to the solution, causing Mg2+, Ca2+, and Ba2+ to precipitate as metal 
phosphates, which are separated from the liquid.
Group 5: Alkali Metals and nH4
+
The only dissolved ions that the liquid decanted from the previous step can now contain 
are Na+, K+, and NH4
+. These cations do not form insoluble compounds with any 
anions and cannot be precipitated from the solution. Their presence can be determined, 
however, by other means. Sodium and potassium ions, for example, are usually identified 
through flame tests. The sodium ion produces a yellow-orange flame, and the potassium 
ion produces a violet flame, as shown in Figure 17.17▼.
By applying this procedure, nearly two dozen metal cations can be separated from a 
solution initially containing all of them. Each of the groups can be further analyzed to 
determine which specific ions are present. The procedures for these steps are found in 
many general chemistry laboratory manuals.

	 17.8	 Complex Ion Equilibria
We have discussed several different types of equilibria so far, including acid–base 
equilibria and solubility equilibria. We now turn to equilibria of another type, which 
primarily involve transition metal ions in solution. Transition metal ions tend to be 
good electron acceptors (good Lewis acids). In aqueous solutions, water molecules can 
act as electron donors (Lewis bases) to hydrate transition metal ions. For example, silver 
ions are hydrated by water in solution to form Ag(H2O)2
+(aq). Chemists often write 
Ag+(aq) as a shorthand notation for the hydrated silver ion, but the bare ion does not 
really exist by itself in solution.
Species such as Ag(H2O)2
+ are known as complex ions. A complex ion contains a 
central metal ion bound to one or more ligands. A ligand is a neutral molecule or ion 
that acts as a Lewis base with the central metal ion. In Ag(H2O)2
+, water is the ligand. If a 
stronger Lewis base is put into a solution containing Ag(H2O)2
+, the stronger Lewis base 
displaces the water in the complex ion. For example, ammonia reacts with Ag(H2O)2
+ 
according to the following reaction:
Ag(H2O)2
+(aq) + 2 NH3(aq) ∆Ag(NH3)2
+(aq) + 2 H2O(l)
For simplicity, we often leave water out of the equation:
Ag+(aq) + 2 NH3(aq) ∆Ag(NH3)2
+(aq)  Kf = 1.7 * 107
The equilibrium constant associated with the reaction for the formation of a com-
plex ion, such as the one just shown, is called the formation constant (Kf). The 
expression for Kf is determined by the law of mass action, like any equilibrium constant. 
For Ag(NH3)2
+, the expression for Kf is:
Kf =
[Ag(NH3)2
+]
[Ag+][NH3]2 
Notice that the value of Kf for Ag(NH3)2
+ is large, indicating that the formation of the 
complex ion is highly favored. Table 17.3 lists the formation constants for a number of 
common complex ions. You can see that, in general, values of Kf are very large, indicat-
ing that the formation of complex ions is highly favored in each case. Example 17.15

Example 17.15	
Complex Ion Equilibria
You mix a 200.0-mL sample of a solution that is 1.5 * 10-3 M in Cu(NO3)2 with a 250.0-mL sample of a solution that is 
0.20 M in NH3. After the solution reaches equilibrium, what concentration of Cu2+(aq) remains?
Solution
Write the balanced equation for the complex ion 
equilibrium that occurs and look up the value 
of Kf in Table 17.3. Since this is an equilibrium 
problem, you have to create an ICE table, which 
requires the initial concentrations of Cu2 + and 
NH3. Calculate those concentrations from the 
given values.

Since the equilibrium constant is large and the 
concentration of ammonia is much larger than 
the concentration of Cu2 +, you can assume that 
the reaction will be driven to the right so that 
most of the Cu2 + is consumed. Unlike previous 
ICE tables, where you used x to represent the 
change in concentration in going to equilibri-
um, here you let x represent the small amount of 
Cu2 + that remains when equilibrium is reached.

Substitute the expressions for the equilibrium 
concentrations into the expression for Kf and 
solve for x.
Confirm that x is indeed small compared to the 
initial concentration of the metal cation.
The remaining Cu2 + is very small because the 
formation constant is very large.

Kf(0.11)4 
 =

1.7 * 1013(0.11)4 
 = 2.7 * 10-13
Since x = 2.7 * 10-13 V 6.7 * 10 - 4, the approximation is valid. 
The remaining [Cu2 +] = 2.7 * 10-13 M.
For Practice 17.15  You mix a 125.0-mL sample of a solution that is 0.0117 M in NiCl2 with a 175.0-mL sample of a 
solution that is 0.250 M in NH3. After the solution reaches equilibrium, what concentration of Ni2+(aq) remains?

	
17.8  Complex Ion Equilibria

The Effect of Complex Ion Equilibria on Solubility
Recall from Section 17.5 that the solubility of an ionic compound with a basic anion 
increases with increasing acidity because the acid reacts with the anion and drives the 
reaction to the right. Similarly, the solubility of an ionic compound containing a metal cation that 
forms complex ions increases in the presence of Lewis bases that complex with the cation. The most 
common Lewis bases that increase the solubility of metal cations are NH3, CN-, and OH-.
For example, silver chloride is only slightly soluble in pure water:
AgCl(s) ∆Ag+(aq) + Cl-(aq)   Ksp = 1.77 * 10-10
However, adding ammonia increases its solubility dramatically because, as we saw previ-
ously in this section, the ammonia forms a complex ion with the silver cations:
Ag+(aq) + 2 NH3(aq) ∆Ag(NH3)2
+(aq)   Kf = 1.7 * 107
The large value of Kf significantly lowers the concentration of Ag+(aq) in solution and 
therefore drives the dissolution of AgCl(s). The two previous reactions can be added together:
 AgCl(s) ∆Ag+(aq) + Cl-(aq)
   Ksp = 1.77 * 10-10
 Ag+(aq) + 2 NH3(aq) ∆Ag(NH3)2
+(aq)
   Kf = 1.7 * 107
 AgCl(s) + 2 NH3(aq) ∆Ag(NH3)2
+(aq) + Cl-(aq)   K = Ksp * 3.0 * 10-3
As we learned in Section 15.3, the  equilibrium constant for a reaction that is the sum of 
two other reactions is the product of the equilibrium constants for the two other reac-
tions. Adding ammonia changes the equilibrium constant for the dissolution of AgCl(s) 
by a factor of 3.0 * 10-3>1.77 * 10-10 = 1.7 * 107 (17 million), which makes the oth-
erwise relatively insoluble AgCl(s) quite soluble, as shown in Figure 17.18▼.

Chapter 17  Aqueous Ionic Equilibrium
The Solubility of Amphoteric Metal Hydroxides
Many metal hydroxides are insoluble or only very slightly soluble in pH-neutral water. 
For example, Al(OH)3 has Ksp = 1.3 * 10-33, which means that if we put Al(OH)3 in 
water, the vast majority of it will settle to the bottom as an undissolved solid. All metal 
hydroxides, however, have a basic anion (OH-) and therefore become more soluble in 
acidic solutions (see the previous subsection and Section 17.5). The metal hydroxides 
become more soluble because they can act as bases and react with H3O+(aq). For 
example, Al(OH)3 dissolves in acid according to the reaction:
Al(OH)3(s) + 3 H3O+(aq) ¡ Al3+(aq) + 6 H2O(l)
Al(OH)3 acts as a base in this reaction.
Interestingly, some metal hydroxides can also act as acids—they are amphoteric. The 
ability of an amphoteric metal hydroxide to act as an acid increases its solubility in basic 
solution. For example, Al(OH)3(s) dissolves in basic solution according to the reaction:
Al(OH)3(s) + OH-(aq) ¡ Al(OH)4
-(aq)
Al(OH)3 acts as an acid in this reaction.
Al(OH)3 is soluble at high pH and soluble at low pH but insoluble in a pH-neutral 
solution.
We can observe the whole range of the pH-dependent solubility behavior of Al3+ by 
considering a hydrated aluminum ion in solution, beginning at an acidic pH. We know 
from Section 16.8 that Al3+ in solution is inherently acidic because it complexes with 
water to form Al(H2O)6
3+(aq). The complex ion then acts as an acid by losing a proton 
from one of the complexed water molecules according to the reaction:
Al(H2O)6
3+(aq) + H2O(l) ∆Al(H2O)5(OH)2+(aq) + H3O+(aq)
Addition of base to the solution drives the reaction to the right and continues to remove 
protons from complexed water molecules:
 Al(H2O)5(OH)2+(aq) + OH-(aq) ∆Al(H2O)4(OH)2
+(aq) + H2O(l)
 Al(H2O)4(OH)2
+(aq) + OH-(aq) ∆Al(H2O)3(OH)3(s) + H2O(l)
equivalent to Al(OH)3(s) 
The result of removing three protons from Al(H2O)6
3+(aq) is the solid white precipi-
tate Al(H2O)3(OH)3(s), which is more commonly written as Al(OH)3(s). The solution is 
now pH-neutral and the hydroxide is insoluble. Addition of more OH- makes the solu-
tion basic and dissolves the solid precipitate:
Al(H2O)3(OH)3(s) + OH-(aq) ∆Al(H2O)2(OH)4
-(aq) + H2O(l)
As the solution goes from acidic to neutral to basic, the solubility of Al3+ changes accord-
ingly, as illustrated in Figure 17.19▶.
The extent to which a metal hydroxide dissolves in both acid and base depends 
on the degree to which it is amphoteric. Cations that form amphoteric hydroxides 
include Al3+, Cr3+, Zn2+, Pb2+, and Sn2+. Other metal hydroxides, such as those of Ca2+, 
Fe2+, and Fe3+, are not amphoteric—they become soluble in acidic solutions, but not 
in basic ones.

Because aluminum hydroxide is amphoteric, its solubility is pH-
dependent. At low pH, the formation of Al(H2O)6

dissolution. At neutral pH, insoluble Al(OH)3 precipitates out of 
solution. At high pH, the formation of Al(H2O)2(OH)4

dissolution.

Key Concepts
The Danger of Antifreeze (17.1)
▶
▶Although buffers closely regulate the pH of mammalian blood, 
the capacity of these buffers to neutralize can be overwhelmed.
▶
▶Ethylene glycol, the main component of antifreeze, is metabo-
lized by the liver into glycolic acid. The resulting acidity can ex-
ceed the buffering capacity of blood and cause acidosis, a serious 
condition that results in oxygen deprivation.
Buffers: Solutions That Resist pH Change (17.2)
▶
▶Buffers contain significant amounts of both a weak acid and its 
conjugate base (or a weak base and its conjugate acid), enabling 
the buffer to neutralize added acid or added base.
▶
▶Adding a small amount of acid to a buffer converts a stoichiomet-
ric amount of base to the conjugate acid. Adding a small amount 
of base to a buffer converts a stoichiometric amount of the acid to 
the conjugate base.

▶
▶We can determine the pH of a buffer solution by solving an equi-
librium problem, focusing on the common ion effect, or by using 
the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation.
Buffer Range and Buffer Capacity (17.3)
▶
▶A buffer works best when the amounts of acid and conjugate base 
it contains are large and approximately equal.
▶
▶If the relative amounts of acid and base in a buffer differ by more 
than a factor of 10, the ability of the buffer to neutralize added acid 
and added base diminishes. The maximum pH range at which a 
buffer is effective is one pH unit on either side of the acid’s pKa.
Titrations and pH Curves (17.4)
▶
▶A titration curve is a graph of the change in pH versus added vol-
ume of acid or base during a titration.
▶
▶This chapter examines three types of titration curves, representing 
three types of acid–base reactions: a strong acid with a strong base, 
a weak acid with a strong base (or vice versa), and a polyprotic acid 
with a strong base.
▶
▶The equivalence point of a titration can be made visible by an in-
dicator, a compound that changes color over a specific pH range.
Solubility Equilibria and the Solubility Product 
Constant (17.5)
▶
▶The solubility product constant (Ksp) is an equilibrium constant 
for the dissolution of an ionic compound in water.
▶
▶We can determine the molar solubility of an ionic compound 
from Ksp and vice versa. Although the value of Ksp is constant 
at a given temperature, the solubility of an ionic substance can 
depend on other factors such as the presence of common ions and 
the pH of the solution.
Precipitation (17.6)
▶
▶We can compare the magnitude of Ksp to the reaction quotient, Q, 
in order to determine the relative saturation of a solution.
▶
▶Substances with cations that have sufficiently different values of 
Ksp can be separated by selective precipitation, in which an added 
reagent forms a precipitate with one of the dissolved cations but 
not others.
Qualitative Chemical Analysis (17.7)
▶
▶Qualitative analysis operates on the principle that a mixture of 
cations can be separated and analyzed based on the differences in 
the solubilities of their salts.
▶
▶In a classic qualitative analysis scheme, an unknown mixture of 
cations is sequentially treated with different reagents, each of 
which precipitates a known subgroup of cations.
Complex Ion Equilibria (17.8)
▶
▶A complex ion contains a central metal ion coordinated to two or 
more ligands.
▶
▶The equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion is 
called a formation constant and is usually quite large.
▶
▶The solubility of an ionic compound containing a metal cation 
that forms complex ions increases in the presence of Lewis bases 
that complex with the cation because the formation of the com-
plex ion drives the dissolution reaction to the right.
▶
▶All metal hydroxides become more soluble in the presence of  
acids, but amphoteric metal hydroxides also become more soluble 
in the presence of bases.
Key Equations and Relationships
The Henderson–Hasselbalch Equation (17.2)
pH = pKa + log [base]
[acid]
Effective Buffer Range (17.3)
pH = range = pKa { 1
The Relation between Q and Ksp (17.6)
If Q 6 Ksp, the solution is unsaturated. More of the solid ionic 
compound can dissolve in the solution.
If Q = Ksp, the solution is saturated. The solution is holding the 
equilibrium amount of the dissolved ions, and additional solid will 
not dissolve in the solution.
If Q 7 Ksp, the solution is supersaturated. Under most 
circumstances, the solid will precipitate out of a supersaturated 
solution.

Data Interpretation and Analysis
Buffers and Hydroponics
	160. 	Hydroponics is a method for growing plants in water with 
added nutrients and oxygen. No soil is used. A deviation from 
the optimal pH range of 5.5–6.5 can prevent a hydroponic plant 
from obtaining the necessary minerals and oxygen it needs to 
grow. To help maintain a pH of 5.5–6.5, growers use a citrate salt 
buffer system. Citric acid, H3C6H5O7, is a triprotic acid that has 
three carboxylic acid groups (Figure a▼).

Answers to Conceptual Connections
Buffers
17.1	 (d) Only this solution contains significant amounts of a weak 
acid and its conjugate base. (Remember that HNO3 is a strong 
acid, but HNO2 is a weak acid.)
pH of Buffer Solutions
17.2	 (a) Since the pH of the buffer is less than the pKa of the acid, 
the buffer must contain more acid than base ([HA] 7 [A-]). In 
order to raise the pH of the buffer from 4.25 to 4.72, you must 
add more of the weak base (adding a base will make the buffer 
solution more basic).
Buffering Action
17.3	 (a) Since one HA molecule is converted to one ion of the 
­conjugate base (A- ion), one OH- ion was added to the buffer 
solution.
Adding Acid or Base to a Buffer
17.4	 (b) Since acid is added to the buffer, the pH will become slight-
ly lower (slightly more acidic). Answer (a) reflects too large a 
change in pH for a buffer, and answers (c) and (d) have the pH 
changing in the wrong direction.
Buffer Capacity
17.5	 (a) Adding 0.050 mol of HCl destroys the buffer because it will 
react with all of the NaF, leaving no conjugate base in the buffer 
mixture.
Titration Equivalence Point
17.6	
(d) Because the flask contains 7 H+ ions, the equivalence 
point is reached when 7 OH- ions have been added.
The Half-Equivalence Point
17.7	
(c) The pH at the half-equivalence point is the pKa of the 
conjugate acid, which is equal to 14.00 - 8.75 = 5.25.
Acid–Base Titrations
17.8	
(c) Since the volumes and concentrations of all three acids 
are the same, the volume of NaOH required to reach the first 
equivalence point (and the only equivalence point for titra-
tions i and iii) is the same for all three titrations.
Common Ion Effect
17.9	
(c) The sodium nitrate solution is the only one that has no 
common ion with barium sulfate. The other two solutions 
have common ions with barium sulfate; therefore, the solu-
bility of barium sulfate is lower in these solutions.
Solubility and Complex Ion Equilibria
17.10	 (c) Only NaCN contains an anion (CN-) that forms a 
complex ion with Cu2 + [from Table 17.3 we can see that 
Kf = 1.0 * 1025 for Cu(CN)4
2 -]. Therefore, the presence of 
CN- will drive the dissolution reaction of CuS.

T
hroughout this book, we have examined chemical and physical changes. We have 
studied how fast chemical changes occur (kinetics) and how to predict how far they 
will go (through the use of equilibrium constants). We have learned that acids neu-
tralize bases and that gases expand to fill their containers. We now turn to the following 
question: why do these changes occur in the first place? What ultimately drives physical 
and chemical changes in matter? The answer may surprise you. The driving force behind 
chemical and physical change in the universe is a quantity called entropy, which is related 
to the dispersion (spreading out) of energy. Nature tends toward that state in which 
­energy is spread out to the greatest extent possible. Although it does not seem obvious at 
first glance, the freezing of water below 0 °C, the dissolving of a solid into a solution, the 
neutralization of an acid by a base, and even the development of a person from an 
­embryo all increase the entropy in the universe (they all result in greater energy 
­dispersion). In our universe, entropy always increases.
	 18.1	 Nature’s Heat Tax: You Can’t Win  
and You Can’t Break Even
Energy transactions are like gambling—you walk into the casino with your pockets full 
of cash and (if you keep gambling long enough) you walk out empty-handed. In the long 
run, you lose money in gambling because the casino takes a cut on each transaction. So 
it is with energy. Nature takes a cut—sometimes referred to as “nature’s heat tax”—on 
every energy transaction so that, in the end, energy is dissipated.

840	
Chapter 18  Free Energy and Thermodynamics
Recall from Chapter 6 that, according to the first law of thermodynamics, energy 
is conserved in chemical processes. When we burn gasoline to run a car, for example, 
the amount of energy produced by the chemical reaction does not vanish, nor does 
any new energy appear that was not present as potential energy (within the gasoline) 
before the combustion. Some of the energy from the combustion reaction goes 
toward driving the car forward (about 20%), and the rest is dissipated into the sur-
roundings as heat (feel a car engine after a drive if you doubt this). The total energy 
given off by the combustion reaction exactly equals the sum of the amount of energy 
that goes to propel the car and the amount dissipated as heat—energy is conserved. 
In other words, when it comes to energy, we can’t win; we cannot create energy that 
was not there to begin with.
The picture becomes more interesting, however, when we consider the second law 
of thermodynamics. The second law—which we examine in more detail throughout 
this chapter—implies that not only can we not win in an energy transaction, we cannot 
even break even. For example, consider a rechargeable battery. Suppose that when we 
use the fully charged battery for some application, the energy from the battery does  
100 kJ of work. Recharging the battery to its original state will necessarily (according to 
the second law of thermodynamics) require more than 100 kJ of energy. Energy is not 
destroyed during the cycle of discharging and recharging the battery, but some energy 
must be lost to the surroundings in order for the process to occur at all. Nature imposes a 
heat tax, an unavoidable cut of every energy transaction.
The implications of the second law for energy use are significant. First of all, according 
to the second law, we cannot create a perpetual motion machine (a machine that perpetu-
ally moves without any energy input). If the machine is to be in motion, it must pay the heat 
tax with each cycle of its motion—over time, it will therefore run down and stop moving.
Second, in most energy transactions, not only is the heat tax lost to the surround-
ings, but additional energy is also lost as heat because real-world processes do not 
achieve the theoretically possible maximum efficiency (Figure 18.1◀). Consequently, 
the most efficient use of energy generally occurs with the smallest number of transac-
tions. For example, heating your home with natural gas is generally cheaper and more 
efficient than heating it with electricity (Figure 18.2▶). When you heat your home 
with natural gas, there is only one energy transaction—you burn the gas and the heat 
from the reaction warms the house. When you heat your home with electricity, sev-
eral transactions occur. Most electricity is generated from the combustion of fossil 
fuels; the heat from the burning fuel boils water to create steam. The steam then turns 
a turbine on a generator to create electricity. The electricity travels from the power 
plant to your home, and some of the energy is lost as heat during the trip. Finally, the 
electricity runs the heater that generates heat. With each transaction, energy is lost to 
the surroundings, resulting in a less efficient use of energy than if you had burned 
natural gas directly.

amount of cropland required for one person to maintain a meat-based diet is about 
six to ten times greater than the amount required for the same person to maintain a

	 18.2	 Spontaneous and Nonspontaneous 
Processes
A fundamental goal of thermodynamics is to predict spontaneity. For example, will 
rust spontaneously form when iron comes into contact with oxygen? Will water 
spontaneously decompose into hydrogen and oxygen? A spontaneous process is 
one that occurs without ongoing outside intervention (such as the performance of work 
by some external force). For example, when you drop a book in a gravitational field, it 
spontaneously drops to the floor. When you place a ball on a slope, it spontaneously 
rolls down the slope.
For simple mechanical systems, such as the dropping of a book or the rolling of a 
ball, predicting spontaneity is fairly intuitive. A mechanical system tends toward low-
est potential energy, which is usually easy to see (at least in simple mechanical systems).

The Concept of Chemical Potential
▶ Figure 18.3  Mechanical

Potential  (a) Mechanical potential 
energy predicts the direction in 
which a mechanical system will 
spontaneously move. (b) We seek a 
chemical potential that predicts the 
direction in which a chemical system 
will spontaneously move.
However, the prediction of spontaneity for chemical systems is not so intuitively obvi-
ous. To make these predictions, we need to develop a criterion for the spontaneity of 
chemical systems. In other words, we need to develop a chemical potential that predicts 
the direction of a chemical system, much as mechanical potential energy predicts the 
direction of a mechanical system (Figure 18.3▲).
We must not confuse the spontaneity of a chemical reaction with the speed of a 
chemical reaction. In thermodynamics, we study the spontaneity of a reaction—the 
direction in which and extent to which a chemical reaction proceeds. In kinetics, we 
study the speed of the reaction—how fast a reaction takes place (Figure 18.4▶). A reaction 
may be thermodynamically spontaneous but kinetically slow at a given temperature. For 
example, the conversion of diamond to graphite is thermodynamically spontaneous. 
But your diamonds will not become worthless anytime soon because the process is 
extremely slow kinetically. Although the rate of a spontaneous process can be increased 
by the use of a catalyst, a nonspontaneous process cannot be made spontaneous by the 
use of a catalyst. Catalysts affect only the rate of a reaction, not the spontaneity.

▶ Even though graphite is 
thermodynamically more stable than 
diamond, the conversion of diamond 
to graphite is kinetically so slow that it 
does not occur at any measurable rate.
One more observation about nonspontaneity—a nonspontaneous process is not 
impossible. For example, the extraction of iron metal from iron ore is a nonspontaneous 
process; it does not happen if the iron ore is left to itself, but that does not mean it is 
impossible. As we will see later in this chapter, a nonspontaneous process can be made 
spontaneous by coupling it to another process that is spontaneous or by supplying

energy from an external source. Iron can be separated from its ore if external energy is 
supplied, usually by means of another reaction (that is itself highly spontaneous).
	 18.3	 Entropy and the Second Law  
of Thermodynamics
The first candidate in our search for a chemical potential might be enthalpy, which we 
defined in Chapter 6. Perhaps, just as a mechanical system proceeds in the direction of lowest 
potential energy, so a chemical system might proceed in the direction of lowest enthalpy. 
If this were the case, all exothermic reactions would be spontaneous and all endothermic 
reactions would not. However, although most spontaneous processes are exothermic, some 
spontaneous processes are endothermic. For example, above 0 °C, ice spontaneously melts 
(an endothermic process). So enthalpy must not be the sole criterion for spontaneity.
We can learn more about the driving force behind chemical reactions by consider-
ing several processes (like ice melting) that involve an increase in enthalpy. The pro-
cesses listed here are energetically uphill (they are endothermic), yet they occur 
spontaneously. What drives them?
• the melting of ice above 0 °C
• the evaporation of liquid water to gaseous water
• the dissolution of sodium chloride in water
Each of these processes is endothermic and spontaneous. Do they have anything in 
common? Notice that, in each process, disorder or randomness increases. In the melting 
of ice, the arrangement of the water molecules changes from a highly ordered one (in 
ice) to a somewhat disorderly one (in liquid water).

In all three of these processes, a quantity called entropy—related to disorder or random-
ness at the molecular level—increases.
Entropy
We have hit upon the criterion for spontaneity in chemical systems: entropy. Informally, 
we can think of entropy as disorder or randomness. But the concept of disorder or 
randomness on the macroscopic scale—such as the messiness of a drawer—is only 
analogous to the concept of disorder or randomness on the molecular scale. Formally, 
entropy, abbreviated by the symbol S, has the following definition:
Entropy (S) is a thermodynamic function that increases with the 
number of energetically equivalent ways to arrange the components 
of a system to achieve a particular state.

	
18.3  Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics 	
845
Austrian physicist, Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) expressed this definition 
­mathematically as:
S = k  ln W
where k is the Boltzmann constant (the gas constant divided by Avogadro’s number, 
R>NA = 1.38 * 10 - 23 J/K) and W is the number of energetically equivalent ways to 
arrange the components of the system. Since W is unitless (it is simply a number), the 
units of entropy are joules per kelvin (J/K). We talk about the significance of the units 
shortly. As we can see from the equation, as W increases, entropy increases.
The key to understanding entropy is the quantity W. What does W—the number of 
energetically equivalent ways to arrange the components of the system—signify? Imag-
ine a system of particles such as a fixed amount of an ideal gas. A given set of conditions 
(P, V, and T) defines the state (or macrostate) of the system. As long as these conditions 
remain constant, the energy of the system also remains constant. However, exactly 
where that energy is at any given instant is anything but constant.
At any one instant, a particular gas particle may have a good deal of kinetic energy. 
However, after a very short period of time, that particle may have very little kinetic 
energy (because it lost its energy through collisions with other particles). The exact inter-
nal energy distribution among the particles at any one instant is sometimes referred to as 
a microstate. We can think of a microstate as a snapshot of the system at a given instant in 
time. The next instant, the snapshot (the microstate) changes. However, the macrostate—
defined by P, V, and T—remains constant. A given macrostate can exist as a result of a 
large number of different microstates. In other words, the snapshot (or microstate) of a 
given macrostate is generally different from one moment to the next as the energy of the 
system is constantly redistributing itself among the particles of the system.
We can conceive of W in terms of microstates. The quantity, W, is the number of 
possible microstates that can result in a given macrostate. For example, suppose that we 
have two systems (call them System A and System B) and that each is composed of two 
particles (one blue and one red). Both systems have a total energy of 4 joules, but  
System A has only one energy level and System B has two:
Energy
System A
E = 2 J
System B
E = 1 J
E = 3 J
Each system has the same total energy (4 J), but System A has only one possible 
microstate (the red and the blue particles both occupying the 2 J energy level) while Sys-
tem B has a second possible microstate:
Energy
System B (second microstate)
E = 1 J
E = 3 J
In this second microstate for System B, the blue particle has 3 J and the red one has 1 J (as 
opposed to System B’s first microstate, where the energy of the particles is switched). 
This second microstate is not possible for System A because it has only one energy level. 
For System A, W = 1, but for System B, W = 2. In other words, System B has more 
microstates that result in the same 4 J macrostate. Since W is larger for System B than for 
▲ Boltzmann’s equation is engraved 
on his tombstone.

846	
Chapter 18  Free Energy and Thermodynamics
System A, System B has greater entropy; it has more energetically equivalent ways to arrange 
the components of the system.
We can understand an important aspect of entropy by turning our attention to 
energy for a moment. The entropy of a state increases with the number of energetically 
equivalent ways to arrange the components of the system to achieve that particular state. 
This implies that the state with the highest entropy also has the greatest dispersal of energy. 
Returning to our previous example, the energy of System B is dispersed over two energy 
levels instead of being confined to just one. At the heart of entropy is the concept of 
energy dispersal or energy randomization. A state in which a given amount of energy is more 
highly dispersed (or more highly randomized) has more entropy than a state in which the same 
energy is more highly concentrated.
We have already alluded to the second law of thermodynamics; we now 
­formally define it:
For any spontaneous process, the entropy of the universe increases 
(𝚫Suniv + 0).
The criterion for spontaneity is the entropy of the universe. Processes that increase the 
entropy of the universe—those that result in greater dispersal or randomization of 
energy—occur spontaneously. Processes that decrease the entropy of the universe do 
not occur spontaneously.
Entropy, like enthalpy, is a state function—its value depends only on the state of the 
system, not on how the system arrived at that state. Therefore, for any process, the change 
in entropy is the entropy of the final state minus the entropy of the initial state:
ΔS = Sfinal - Sinitial
Entropy determines the direction of chemical and physical change. A chemical system 
proceeds in a direction that increases the entropy of the universe—it proceeds in a direc-
tion that has the largest number of energetically equivalent ways to arrange its 
components.
The Entropy Change upon the Expansion of  
an Ideal Gas
To better understand this tendency, let us examine the expansion of an ideal gas into a 
vacuum (a spontaneous process with no associated change in enthalpy). Consider a flask 
containing an ideal gas that is connected to another, evacuated, flask by a tube equipped 
with a stopcock. When the stopcock is opened, the gas spontaneously expands into the 
evacuated flask. Since the gas is expanding into a vacuum, the pressure against which it 
expands is zero, and therefore the work (w = -Pext ΔV ) is also zero.
However, even though the total energy of the gas does not change during the 
expansion, the entropy does change. To picture this, consider a simplified system con-
taining only four gas atoms:
When the stopcock is opened, several possible energetically equivalent final states 
may result, each with the four atoms distributed in a different way. For example, there 
could be three atoms in the flask on the left and one in the flask on the right, or vice 
versa. For simplicity, we consider only the possibilities shown in the figure in the left 
margin, which are state A, state B, and state C. Since the energy of any one atom is the 
same in either flask, and since the atoms do not interact, states A, B, and C are 
­energetically equivalent.
Now we ask the following question for each state: how many microstates give rise to 
the same macrostate? To keep track of the microstates, we label the atoms 1–4. Although 
they have different numbered labels, since the atoms are all the same, there is externally 
State A
State B
State C
See the discussion of state functions 
in Section 6.3.
See the discussion of work done by 
an expanding gas in Section 6.4.

	
18.3  Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics 	
847
no difference between them. For states A and B, only one microstate results in the speci-
fied macrostate—atoms 1–4 on the left side or the right side, respectively:
State A
1, 2, 3, 4
Macrostate
Microstates
1, 2, 3, 4
State B
For state C, however, six different possible microstates all result in the same macro-
state (two atoms on each side):
State C
1, 2
3, 4
2, 3
1, 4
1, 3
2, 4
2, 4
1, 3
1, 4
2, 3
3, 4
1, 2
Macrostate
Microstates
This means that if the atoms are just randomly moving between the two flasks, the 
statistical probability of finding the atoms in state C is six times greater than the 
­probability of finding the atoms in state A or state B. Consequently, even for a simple 
system consisting of only four atoms, the atoms are most likely to be found in state C. 
State C has the greatest entropy—it has the greatest number of energetically equivalent 
ways to distribute its components.
As the number of atoms increases, the number of microstates that leads to the atoms 
being equally distributed between the two flasks increases dramatically. For example, 
with 10 atoms, the number of microstates leading to an equal distribution of atoms 
between two flasks is 252 and with 20 atoms the number of microstates is 184,756. Yet, 
the number of microstates that leads to all of the atoms being only in the left flask (or all 
For n particles, the number of ways 
to put r particles in one flask and 
n - r particles in the other flask is 
n!>[(n - r)!r!]. For 10 atoms, n = 10 
and r = 5.
In these drawings, the exact 
location of an atom within a flask is 
insignificant. The significant aspect is 
whether the atom is in the left flask or 
the right flask.

848	
Chapter 18  Free Energy and Thermodynamics
only in the right flask) does not increase—it is always only 1. In other words, the arrange-
ment in which the atoms are equally distributed between the two flasks has a much 
larger number of possible microstates and therefore much greater entropy. The system 
thus tends toward that state.
The change in entropy in transitioning from a state in which all of the atoms are in 
the left flask to the state in which the atoms are evenly distributed between both flasks is 
positive because the final state has a greater entropy than the initial state:
∆S = Sﬁnal − Sinitial
Entropy of state in 
which atoms are 
distributed between 
both ﬂasks
Entropy of state in 
which atoms are all 
in one ﬂask
Since Sfinal is greater than Sinitial, ΔS is positive and the process is spontaneous according 
to the second law. Notice that when the atoms are confined to one flask, their energy is 
also confined to that one flask; however, when the atoms are evenly distributed between 
both flasks, their energy is spread out over a greater volume. As the gas expands into the 
empty flask, energy is dispersed.
The second law explains many phenomena not explained by the first law. In  
Chapter 6, we learned that heat travels from a substance at higher temperature to one at 
lower temperature. For example, if we drop an ice cube into water, heat travels from the 
water to the ice cube—the water cools and the ice warms (and eventually melts). Why? 
The first law would not prohibit some heat from flowing the other way—from the ice to 
the water. The ice could lose 10 J of heat (cooling even more) and the water could gain  
10 J of heat (warming even more). The first law of thermodynamics would not be vio-
lated by such a heat transfer. Imagine putting ice into water only to have the water get 
warmer as it absorbed thermal energy from the ice! It will never happen because heat 
transfer from cold to hot violates the second law of thermodynamics. According to the 
second law, energy is dispersed, not concentrated. The transfer of heat from a substance 
of higher temperature to one of lower temperature results in greater energy randomiza-
tion—the energy that was concentrated in the hot substance becomes dispersed between 
the two substances. The second law accounts for this ­pervasive tendency.

State Changes
The entropy of a sample of matter increases as it changes state from a solid to a liquid or 
from a liquid to a gas (Figure 18.5▶). We first consider this idea conceptually, and then we 
turn to actually calculating the value of ΔS for this change. Recall that, in Chapter 6, we 
distinguished between a thermodynamic system and its surroundings. This distinction is 
useful in our discussion of entropy. For a change of state in a substance, we consider the 
substance to be the system. The surroundings are then the rest of the universe. Here, we

849
focus on the entropy of the system undergoing the change of state (not the surroundings, 
which we address in Section 18.5).
Entropy and State Change: The Concept
We can informally think of the increase in entropy in going from a solid to a liquid or 
from a liquid to a gas by analogy with macroscopic disorder. The gaseous state is more 
disorderly than the liquid state, which is in turn more disorderly than the solid state. More 
formally, however, the differences in entropy are related to the number of energetically 
equivalent ways of arranging the particles in each state—there are more in the gas than in 
the liquid, and more in the liquid than in the solid.
A gas has more energetically equivalent configurations because it has more ways to 
distribute its energy than a solid. The energy in a molecular solid consists largely of the 
vibrations between its molecules. If the same substance is in its gaseous state, however, 
the energy can take the form of straight-line motions of the molecules (called transla-
tional energy) and rotations of the molecules (called rotational energy). In other words, 
when a solid vaporizes into a gas, there are new “places” to put energy (Figure 18.6▼). 
The gas thus has more possible microstates (more energetically equivalent configura-
tions) than the solid and therefore a greater entropy.

We can now predict the sign of ΔS for processes involving changes of state (or 
phase). In general, entropy increases (ΔS 7 0) for each of the following:
• the phase transition from a solid to a liquid
• the phase transition from a solid to a gas
• the phase transition from a liquid to a gas
• an increase in the number of moles of a gas during a chemical reaction

Entropy and State Changes: The Calculation
We have just seen how the entropy of system increases with the transition from a solid 
to a liquid to a gas. We can calculate the actual changes in entropy that occur in the 
system during these state transitions. Recall from Sections 11.5 and 11.6 that a change 
in state is accompanied by an exchange of heat between the system and surroundings. 
For example, melting and vaporization are endothermic (they absorb heat from the 
surroundings), while freezing and condensation are exothermic (they give off heat to 
the surroundings).
The definition of entropy that we introduced previously (S = k ln W) shows how 
entropy is related to the distribution of energy among the particles that compose mat-
ter. On a macroscopic scale, we can define the change in entropy that occurs when a 
system exchanges a quantity of heat (q) with its surroundings at a constant temperature 
(T) with the following equation:
	
ΔS =
qrev
T  (constant temperature)
[18.1]
In this equation, ΔS is the entropy change of the system, qrev is the heat exchanged with 
the surroundings in a reversible process (more on this to come), and T is the temperature 
in K. The temperature must be constant throughout the change—the process must be 
isothermal. Let’s address two important concepts related to this equation, the units of 
entropy and reversible processes.
Units of Entropy
In Section 18.3 we saw that the units of entropy are J>K. We can now better understand 
these units. Entropy is a measure of energy dispersal per unit temperature and therefore 
has the units of energy (J) over temperature (K). For example, when a substance melts 

	
18.4  Entropy Changes Associated with State Changes	
851
(an endothermic process), it absorbs a certain amount of energy from the surroundings. 
That energy becomes dispersed into the system (as the substance changes state from 
a solid to a liquid) and the entropy of the substance increases. The change in entropy 
is related to the amount of energy the substance absorbs (units of J) divided by the 
temperature of the substance (units of K).
Reversible Processes
A reversible process is one that reverses direction upon an infinitesimally small 
change in some property. The melting of ice when the ice and its surroundings are both 
at exactly 0 °C is an example of a reversible process. An infinitesimally small removal of 
heat reverses the melting and causes freezing instead. An infinitesimally small addition 
of heat causes the melting to resume. All reversible processes are in a constant state of 
equilibrium and represent highly idealized conditions. In contrast, the melting of ice 
that happens when we set an ice cube on a countertop at room temperature is irreversible. 
In this case, the countertop and the surrounding air are at 25.0 °C and an infinitesimally 
small removal of heat does not reverse the melting.
We can use Equation 18.1 to calculate the change in the entropy of a system that 
undergoes a state change. For example, when ice melts at its melting point, the heat 
exchanged with the surroundings is ΔHfus and the temperatue is 273 K:
 qrev = ΔHfus = 6.02 kJ>mol
 T = 273 K
We substitute these quantities into Equation 18.1 to determine the change in entropy of 
the system when 1 mol of ice melts at its melting point:
 ΔS =
qrev
T
 =
(1 mol) 6.02 * 103 J
mol
273 K
 = 22.1 J>K
The value of ΔS is positive as we would expect for a transition from solid to liquid.

Calculating 𝚫S for a Change of State
Calculate the change in entropy that occurs in the system when 25.0 g of water condenses from a gas to a liquid at the 
normal boiling point of water (100.0 °C).

Because the condensation is occurring at the boiling point of water 
and the temperature is constant, you can use Equation 18.1 to 
calculate the change in entropy of the system.

	 18.5	 Heat Transfer and Changes in the 
Entropy of the Surroundings
We have now seen that the criterion for spontaneity is an increase in the entropy of the 
universe. However, you can probably think of several spontaneous processes in which 
entropy seems to decrease. For example, when water freezes at temperatures below 0 °C, 
the entropy of the water decreases, yet the process is spontaneous. Similarly, when water 
vapor in air condenses into fog on a cold night, the entropy of the water also decreases. 
Why are these processes spontaneous?
To answer this question, we must return to the second law: for any spontaneous pro-
cess, the entropy of the universe increases (ΔSuniv 7 0). Even though the entropy of the 
water decreases during freezing and condensation, the entropy of the universe must some-
how increase in order for these processes to be spontaneous. If we define the water as the 
system, then ΔSsys is the entropy change for the water itself, ΔSsurr is the entropy change 
for the surroundings, and ΔSuniv is the entropy change for the universe. The entropy 
change for the universe is the sum of the entropy changes for the system and the 
surroundings:
ΔSuniv = ΔSsys + ΔSsurr
The second law states that the entropy of the universe must increase (ΔSuniv 7 0) for a 
process to be spontaneous. The entropy of the system can decrease (ΔSsys 6 0) as long as 
the entropy of the surroundings increases by a greater amount (ΔSsurr 7 -ΔSsys), so that 
the overall entropy of the universe undergoes a net increase.
For liquid water freezing or water vapor condensing, we know that the change in 
entropy for the system (ΔSsys) is negative as we discussed in Section 18.4. For ΔSuniv to be 
positive, therefore, ΔSsurr must be positive and greater in absolute value (or magnitude) 
than ΔSsys as shown graphically here:
∆Suniv = ∆Ssys + ∆Ssurr
∆Suniv
 ∆Ssys
∆Ssurr
Entropy
But why does the freezing of ice or the condensation of water increase the entropy 
of the surroundings? Because both processes are exothermic: they give off heat to the sur-
roundings. Because we think of entropy as the dispersal or randomization of energy, the 
release of heat energy by the system disperses that energy into the surroundings, increasing the 
entropy of the surroundings. The freezing of water below 0 °C and the condensation of 
water vapor on a cold night both increase the entropy of the universe because the heat 
given off to the surroundings increases the entropy of the surroundings to a sufficient 
degree to overcome the entropy decrease in the water.
CHECK  The answer has the correct units for entropy (J>K). The answer is negative as you would expect for the condensa-
tion of a gas to a liquid.
For Practice 18.2  Calculate the change in entropy that occurs in the system when 10.0 g of acetone (C3H6O) 
vaporizes from a liquid to a gas at its normal boiling point (56.1 °C).
Continued—
Even though (as we saw earlier) 
enthalpy by itself cannot determine 
spontaneity, the increase in the 
entropy of the surroundings caused 
by the release of heat explains why 
exothermic processes are so often 
spontaneous.

Summarizing Entropy Changes in the Surroundings:
▶
▶
An exothermic process increases the entropy of the surroundings.
▶
▶
An endothermic process decreases the entropy of the surroundings.
The Temperature Dependence of 𝚫Ssurr
We have just seen how the freezing of water increases the entropy of the surroundings by 
dispersing heat energy into the surroundings. Yet we know that the freezing of water is 
not spontaneous at all temperatures. The freezing of water becomes nonspontaneous above 
0 °C. Why? Because the magnitude of the increase in the entropy of the surroundings 
due to the dispersal of energy into the surroundings is temperature dependent.
The greater the temperature, the smaller the increase in entropy for a given amount of 
energy dispersed into the surroundings. Recall that the units of entropy are joules per 
­kelvin: energy units divided by temperature units. As we have seen, entropy is a measure of 
energy dispersal (joules) per unit temperature (kelvins). The higher the temperature, the lower 
the amount of entropy for a given amount of energy dispersed. We can understand the 
temperature dependence of entropy changes due to heat flow with a simple analogy. Imag-
ine that you have $1000 to give away. If you gave the $1000 to a rich man, the impact on his 
net worth would be negligible (because he already has so much money). If you gave the 
same $1000 to a poor man, however, his net worth would change substantially (because he 
has so little money). Similarly, if you disperse 1000 J of energy into surroundings that are 
hot, the entropy increase is small (because the impact of the 1000 J is small on surround-
ings that already contain a lot of energy). If you disperse the same 1000 J of energy into sur-
roundings that are cold, however, the entropy increase is large (because the impact of the 
1000 J is great on surroundings that contain little energy). For this same reason, the impact 
of the heat released to the surroundings by the freezing of water depends on the tempera-
ture of the surroundings—the higher the temperature, the smaller the impact.
We can now understand why water spontaneously freezes at low temperature but 
not at high temperature. For the freezing of liquid water into ice, the change in entropy 
of the system is negative at all temperatures:
∆Suniv = ∆Ssys + ∆Ssurr
Negative
Positive and large at low temperature
Positive and small at high temperature
At low temperatures, on one hand, the decrease in entropy of the system is overcome by 
the large increase in the entropy of the surroundings (a positive quantity), resulting in a 
positive ΔSuniv and a spontaneous process. At high temperatures, on the other hand, the 
decrease in entropy of the system is not overcome by the increase in entropy of the 
­surroundings (because the magnitude of the positive ΔSsurr is smaller at higher tempera-
tures), resulting in a negative ΔSuniv; therefore, the freezing of water is not spontaneous 
at high temperature as shown graphically here:
∆Suniv = ∆Ssys + ∆Ssurr  (for water freezing)

Chapter 18  Free Energy and Thermodynamics
Quantifying Entropy Changes in the Surroundings
We have seen that when a system exchanges heat with the surroundings, it changes the 
entropy of the surroundings. In Section 18.4, we saw that, at constant temperature, we 
can use Equation 18.1 (ΔS = qrev>T) to quantify the entropy change in the system. We 
can use the same expression to quantify entropy changes in the surroundings. In other 
words, the change in entropy of the surroundings depends on: (a) the amount of heat 
transferred into or out of the surroundings; and (b) the temperature of the surroundings.
Since the surroundings are usually an infinitely large bath at constant temperature, 
the heat transferred into or out of that bath under conditions of constant pressure (where 
only PV work is allowed) is simply -ΔHsys. The negative sign reflects that, according to 
the first law of thermodynamics, any heat leaving the system must go into the surround-
ings and vice versa (qsys = -qsurr). If we incorporate this idea into Equation 18.1, we get 
the following expression:
	
ΔSsurr =
-ΔHsys
T
	
(constant P,  T)
[18.2]
For any chemical or physical process occurring at constant temperature and 
­pressure, the entropy change of the surroundings is equal to the heat dispersed into or 
out of the surroundings (-ΔHsys) divided by the temperature of the surroundings in 
­kelvins. Notice that:
• A process that emits heat into the surroundings (ΔHsys negative) increases the 
­entropy of the surroundings (positive ΔSsurr).
• A process that absorbs heat from the surroundings (ΔHsys positive) decreases the 
­entropy of the surroundings (negative ΔSsurr).
• The magnitude of the change in entropy of the surroundings is proportional to the 
magnitude of ΔHsys.
Equation 18.1 gives us insight into why exothermic processes have a tendency to be 
spontaneous at low temperatures—they increase the entropy of the surroundings. As 
temperature increases, however, a given negative ΔHsys produces a smaller positive ΔSsurr; 
for this reason, exothermicity becomes less of a determining factor for spontaneity as 
temperature increases.
Example 18.3	
Calculating Entropy Changes in the Surroundings

C3H8(g) + 5 O2(g) ¡ 3 CO2(g) + 4 H2O(g)   ΔHrxn = -2044 kJ

Solution
(a)	 The entropy change of the surroundings is given by  
Equation 18.2. Substitute the value of ΔHrxn and the

18.6  Gibbs Free Energy

	 18.6	 Gibbs Free Energy
Equation 18.2 establishes a relationship between the enthalpy change in a system and 
the entropy change in the surroundings. Recall that for any process the entropy change 
of the universe is the sum of the entropy change of the system and the entropy change 
of the surroundings:
	
ΔSuniv = ΔSsys + ΔSsurr
[18.3]
Combining Equation 18.3 with Equation 18.2 gives us the following relationship at 
­constant temperature and pressure:
	
ΔSuniv = ΔSsys -
ΔHsys
T

[18.4]
Using Equation 18.4, we can calculate ΔSuniv while focusing only on the system. 
If we multiply Equation 18.4 by -T, we arrive at the expression:
 -TΔSuniv = -TΔSsys + T 
ΔHsys
T
	
 = ΔHsys - TΔSsys

[18.5]
If we drop the subscript sys—from now on ΔH and ΔS without subscripts mean ΔHsys 
and ΔSsys—we get the expression:
	
-TΔSuniv = ΔH - TΔS
[18.6]
The right-hand side of Equation 18.6 represents the change in a thermodynamic 
function called Gibbs free energy. The formal definition of Gibbs free energy (G) is:
	
G = H - TS
[18.7]
where H is enthalpy, T is the temperature in kelvins, and S is entropy. The change in Gibbs 
free energy, symbolized by ΔG, is expressed as follows (at constant temperature):
	
ΔG = ΔH - TΔS 
[18.8]
If we combine Equations 18.6 and 18.8, we have an equation that makes clear the 
significance of ΔG:
	
ΔG = -TΔSuniv	
(constant T,  P)
[18.9]
(c)	 The change in entropy of the universe is the sum of the 
entropy changes of the system and the surroundings. If the 
entropy changes of the system and surroundings are both 
the same sign, the entropy change for the universe also has 
the same sign.
∆Suniv = ∆Ssys + ∆Ssurr
Positive
Positive
Therefore, ΔSuniv is positive and the reaction is spon-

Chapter 18  Free Energy and Thermodynamics
The change in Gibbs free energy for a process occurring at constant temperature and pressure is 
proportional to the negative of ΔSuniv. Since ΔSuniv is a criterion for spontaneity, ΔG is also a 
criterion for spontaneity (although opposite in sign). In fact, Gibbs free energy is also 
called chemical potential because it is analogous to mechanical potential energy discussed 
earlier. Just as mechanical systems tend toward lower potential energy, so chemical systems 
tend toward lower Gibbs free energy (toward lower chemical potential) (Figure 18.7▼).

Summarizing Gibbs Free Energy (at Constant Temperature and Pressure):
▶
▶
ΔG is proportional to the negative of ΔSuniv.
▶
▶
A decrease in Gibbs free energy (ΔG 6 0) corresponds to a spontaneous process.
▶
▶
An increase in Gibbs free energy (ΔG 6 0) corresponds to a nonspontaneous process.
Notice that we can calculate changes in Gibbs free energy solely with reference to 
the system. So, to determine whether a process is spontaneous, we only have to find the 
change in entropy for the system (ΔS) and the change in enthalpy for the system (ΔH). 
We can then predict the spontaneity of the process at any temperature. In Chapter 6, we 
learned how to calculate changes in enthalpy (ΔH) for chemical reactions. In Section 
18.7, we learn how to calculate changes in entropy (ΔS) for chemical reactions. We can 
then use those two quantities to calculate changes in free energy (ΔG) for chemical 
reactions and predict their spontaneity (Section 18.8). Before we move on to these top-
ics, let’s examine some examples that demonstrate how ΔH, ΔS, and T affect the sponta-
neity of chemical processes.
The Effect of 𝚫H, 𝚫S, and T on Spontaneity
Case 1: 𝚫H Negative, 𝚫S Positive  If a reaction is exothermic (ΔH 6 0), and if the 
change in entropy for the reaction is positive (ΔS 7 0), then the change in free energy is 
negative at all temperatures and the reaction is spontaneous at all temperatures:
∆G = ∆H − T ∆S

As an example, consider the dissociation of N2O :
2 N2O(g) ¡ 2 N2(g) + O2(g)  ΔH °rxn = -163.2 kJ
	
2 mol gas	
3 mol gas
The change in enthalpy is negative—heat is emitted, increasing the entropy of the 
­surroundings. The change in entropy for the reaction is positive, which means that the 
entropy of the system increases. (We can see that the change in entropy is positive from 
the balanced equation—the number of moles of gas increases.) Since the entropy of 
both the system and the surroundings increases, the entropy of the universe must also 
increase, making the reaction spontaneous at all temperatures.
Case 2: 𝚫H Positive, 𝚫S Negative  If a reaction is endothermic (ΔH 7 0), and if the 
change in entropy for the reaction is negative (ΔS 6 0), then the change in free energy 
is positive at all temperatures and the reaction is nonspontaneous at all temperatures:
∆G = ∆H − T ∆S
Negative
Positive
Positive at
all temperatures
As an example, consider the formation of ozone from oxygen:
3 O2(g) ¡ 2 O3(g)  ΔH °rxn = +285.4 kJ
	
3 mol gas	
2 mol gas
The change in enthalpy is positive—heat is therefore absorbed, decreasing the entropy of 
the surroundings. The change in entropy is negative, which means that the entropy of 
the system decreases. (We can see that the change in entropy is negative from the bal-
anced equation—the number of moles of gas decreases.) Since the entropy of both the 
system and the surroundings decreases, the entropy of the universe must also decrease, 
making the reaction nonspontaneous at all temperatures.
Case 3: 𝚫H Negative, 𝚫S Negative  If a reaction is exothermic (ΔH 6 0), and if the 
change in entropy for the reaction is negative (ΔS 6 0), then the sign of the change in 
free energy depends on temperature. The reaction is spontaneous at low temperature, 
but nonspontaneous at high temperature:
∆G = ∆H − T ∆S
Negative
Negative
Negative at low temperatures
Positive at high temperatures
As an example, consider the freezing of liquid water to form ice:
H2O(l) ¡ H2O(s)   ΔH ° = -6.01 kJ
The change in enthalpy is negative—heat is emitted, increasing the entropy of the sur-
roundings. The change in entropy is negative, which means that the entropy of the sys-
tem decreases. (We can see that the change in entropy is negative from the balanced 
equation—a liquid turns into a solid.)
Unlike the two previous cases, where the changes in entropy of the system and of 
the surroundings had the same sign, the changes here are opposite in sign. Therefore, 
the sign of the change in free energy depends on the relative magnitudes of the two 
changes. At a low enough temperature, the heat emitted into the surroundings 
causes a large entropy change in the surroundings, making the process spontaneous. 
At high temperature, the same amount of heat is dispersed into warmer surround-
ings, so the positive entropy change in the surroundings is smaller, resulting in a 
nonspontaneous process.
Case 4: 𝚫H Positive, 𝚫S Positive  If a reaction is endothermic (ΔH 7 0), and if the 
change in entropy for the reaction is positive (ΔS 7 0), then the sign of the change 
Recall from Chapter 6 that ΔH° 
represents the standard enthalpy 
change. The definition of the standard 
state was first given in Section 6.9 
and is summarized in Section 18.7.

in free energy again depends on temperature. The reaction is nonspontaneous at low 
temperature but spontaneous at high temperature:
∆G = ∆H − T ∆S
Positive at low temperatures
Negative at high temperatures
Positive
Positive
As an example, consider the vaporizing of liquid water to gaseous water:
H2O(l) ¡ H2O(g)   ΔH ° = +40.7  kJ (at 100 °C)
The change in enthalpy is positive—heat is absorbed from the surroundings, so the 
entropy of the surroundings decreases. The change in entropy is positive, which means 
that the entropy of the system increases. (We can see that the change in entropy is posi-
tive from the balanced equation—a liquid turns into a gas.) The changes in entropy of 
the system and the surroundings again have opposite signs, only this time the entropy 
of the surroundings decreases while the entropy of the system increases. In cases such as 
this, high temperature favors spontaneity because the absorption of heat from the sur-
roundings has less effect on the entropy of the surroundings as temperature increases.
Table 18.1 summarizes these effects. Notice that when ΔH and ΔS have opposite 
signs, the spontaneity of the reaction does not depend on temperature. When ΔH and 
ΔS have the same sign, however, the spontaneity does depend on temperature. The temperature 
at which the reaction changes from being spontaneous to being nonspontaneous (or 
vice versa) is the temperature at which ΔG changes sign, which we can find by setting 
ΔG = 0 and solving for T, as shown in part b of Example 18.4.

spontaneous.
Solution
(a)	 Use Equation 18.8 to calculate ΔG from the given values of ΔH and 
ΔS. The temperature must be in kelvins. Be sure to express both ΔH 
and ΔS in the same units (usually joules).
T = 273 + 25 = 298 K
 ΔG = ΔH - TΔS
 = 95.7 * 103 J - (298 K)142.2 J>K
 = 95.7 * 103 J - 42.4 * 103 J
 = +53.3 * 103 J
The reaction is not spontaneous.
(b)	 Since ΔS is positive, ΔG becomes more negative with increasing 
temperature. To determine the temperature at which the reaction 
becomes spontaneous, use Equation 18.8 to find the temperature at 
which ΔG changes from positive to negative (set ΔG = 0 and solve 
for T). The reaction is spontaneous above this temperature.
 ΔG = ΔH - T ΔS
 0 = 95.7 * 103 J - (T)142.2 J>K
 T = 95.7 * 103 J

	 18.7	 Entropy Changes in Chemical 
Reactions: Calculating 𝚫S°rxn
In Chapter 6, we learned how to calculate standard changes in enthalpy (ΔH °rxn) for 
chemical reactions. We now turn to calculating standard changes in entropy for chemical 
reactions.
Defining Standard States and Standard Entropy Changes
Recall from Section 6.9 that the standard enthalpy change for a reaction (ΔH °rxn) is the 
change in enthalpy for a process in which all reactants and products are in their standard 
states. Recall also the definition of the standard state:
• For a Gas: The standard state for a gas is the pure gas at a pressure of exactly 1 atm.
• For a Liquid or Solid: The standard state for a liquid or solid is the pure substance in 
its most stable form at a pressure of 1 atm and at the temperature of interest (often 
taken to be 25 °C).
• For a Substance in Solution: The standard state for a substance in solution is a 
­concentration of 1 M.
We define the standard entropy change for a reaction (𝚫S°rxn) as the change 
in entropy for a process in which all reactants and products are in their standard states. 
Since entropy is a function of state, the standard change in entropy is therefore the stan-
dard entropy of the products minus the standard entropy of the reactants:
ΔS°rxn = S°products - S°reactants
But how do we find the standard entropies of the reactants and products? Recall 
from Chapter 6 that we defined standard molar enthalpies of formation (ΔH °f) to use in cal-
culating ΔH°rxn. We now need to define standard molar entropies (S°) to use in cal-
culating ΔS°rxn.
Standard Molar Entropies (S°)  
and the Third Law of Thermodynamics
In Chapter 6, we defined a relative zero for enthalpy. To do this, we assigned a value of 
zero to the standard enthalpy of formation for an element in its standard state. This was  
necessary because absolute values of enthalpy cannot be determined. In other words, for 
The standard state has recently been 
changed to a pressure of 1 bar, which 
is very close to 1 atm (1 atm = 1.013 
bar). Both standards are now in 
common use.

enthalpy, there is no absolute zero against which to measure all other values; therefore, 
we always have to rely on enthalpy changes from an arbitrarily assigned standard (the 
elements in their standard states and most stable forms).
For entropy, however, there is an absolute zero. The absolute zero of entropy is estab-
lished by the third law of thermodynamics, which states:
The entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero (0 K) is zero.
A perfect crystal at a temperature of absolute zero has only one possible way (W = 1) to 
arrange its components (Figure 18.8◀). Based on Boltzmann’s definition of entropy 
(S = k ln W), its entropy is zero (S = k ln 1 = 0).
We can measure all entropy values against the absolute zero of entropy as defined 
by the third law. Table 18.2 lists values of standard entropies at 25 °C for selected sub-
stances. A more complete list is in Appendix IIB. Standard entropy values are listed in 
units of joules per mole per kelvin (J>mol # K). The units of mole in the denominator 
are required because entropy is an extensive property—it depends on the amount of the 
substance.

At 25 °C, the standard entropy of any substance is the energy dispersed into one 
mole of that substance at 25 °C, which depends on the number of “places” to put energy 
within the substance. The factors that affect the number of “places” to put energy—and 
therefore the standard entropy—include the state of the substance, the molar mass of 
the substance, the particular allotrope, its molecular complexity, and its extent of disso-
lution. Let’s examine each of these separately.
Relative Standard Entropies: Gases, Liquids, and Solids
As we saw in Section 18.3, the entropy of a gas is generally greater than the entropy of 
a liquid, which is in turn greater than the entropy of a solid. We can see these trends in 
the tabulated values of standard entropies. For example, consider the relative standard 
entropies of liquid water and gaseous water at 25 °C:
S° (J,mol # K)
H2o(l)
70.0
H2o(g)
188.8
Gaseous water has a much greater standard entropy because, as we discussed in ­ 
Section 18.3, it has more energetically equivalent ways to arrange its components, which 
in turn results in greater energy dispersal at 25 °C.
Some elements exist in two or more 
forms, called allotropes, within the 
same state.

Relative Standard Entropies: Molar Mass
Consider the standard entropies of the noble gases at 25 °C :
S°  (J/mol⋅K)
He(g)
126.2
Ne(g)
146.1
Ar(g)
154.8
Kr(g)
163.8
Xe(g)
169.4
The more massive the noble gas, the greater its entropy at 25 °C. A complete 
explanation of why entropy increases with increasing molar mass is beyond the 
scope of this book. Briefly, the energy states associated with the motion of heavy 
atoms are more closely spaced than those of lighter atoms. The more closely spaced 
energy states allow for greater dispersal of energy at a given temperature and there-
fore greater entropy. This trend is true only for elements in the same state. (The effect 
of a state change—from a liquid to a gas, for example—is far greater than the effect of 
molar mass.)
Relative Standard Entropies: Allotropes
As mentioned previously, some elements can exist in two or more forms—called 
allotropes—in the same state of matter. For example, the allotropes of carbon include 
diamond and graphite—both solid forms of carbon. Because the arrangement of atoms 
within these forms is different, their standard molar entropies are different:
S°  (J/mol⋅K)
C(s, diamond)
C(s, graphite)
2.4
5.7
In diamond the atoms are constrained by chemical bonds in a highly restricted three-
dimensional crystal structure. In graphite the atoms bond together in sheets, but the 
sheets have freedom to slide past each other. The less constrained structure of graphite 
results in more “places” to put energy and therefore greater entropy compared to 
diamond.

Chapter 18  Free Energy and Thermodynamics
Relative Standard Entropies: Molecular Complexity
For a given state of matter, entropy generally increases with increasing molecular 
complexity. For example, consider the standard entropies of argon and nitrogen 
monoxide gas:
Molar Mass (g, mol)
S° (J,mol # K)
Ar(g)
39.948
154.8
NO(g)
30.006
210.8
Ar has a greater molar mass than NO, yet it has less entropy at 25 °C. Why? Molecules 
generally have more “places” to put energy than do atoms. In a gaseous sample of argon, 
on one hand, the only form that energy can take is the translational motion of the 
atoms. In a gaseous sample of NO, on the other hand, energy can take the form of trans-
lational motion, rotational motion, and (at high enough temperatures) vibrational 
motions of the molecules (Figure 18.9▼). Therefore, for a given state, molecules gener-
ally have a greater entropy than free atoms.
 Translational motion
Rotational motion
Vibrational motion
▶ Figure 18.9  “Places” for Energy in 
Gaseous NO  Energy can be contained in 
translational motion, rotational motion, and 
(at high enough temperatures) vibrational 
motion.
Similarly, more complex molecules generally have more entropy than simpler ones. 
For example, consider the standard entropies of carbon monoxide and ethene gas:
Molar Mass (g, mol)
S° (J,mol # K)
CO(g)
28.01
197.7
C2H4(g)
28.05
219.3
These two substances have nearly the same molar mass, but the greater complexity of 
C2H4 results in a greater molar entropy. When molecular complexity and molar mass 
both increase (as is often the case), molar entropy also increases, as demonstrated by the 
oxides of nitrogen:
S° (J,mol # K)
NO(g)
210.8
No2(g)
240.1
N2o4(g)
304.4
The increasing molecular complexity as we move down this list, as well as the increasing 
molar mass, results in more “places” to put energy and therefore greater entropy.
Relative Standard Entropies: Dissolution
The dissolution of a crystalline solid into solution usually results in an increase in 
entropy. For example, consider the standard entropies of solid and aqueous potassium 
chlorate:
S° (J,mol # K)
KClo3(s)
143.1
KClo3(aq)
265.7
When solid potassium chlorate dissolves in water, the energy that was concentrated 
within the crystal becomes dispersed throughout the entire solution. The greater energy 
dispersal results in greater entropy.
The standard entropies for aqueous 
solutions are for the solution in its 
standard state, which is defined as 
having a concentration of 1 M.

Calculating the Standard Entropy Change (𝚫S°rxn)  
for a Reaction
Since entropy is a state function, and since standard entropies for many common 
substances are tabulated, we can calculate the standard entropy change for a chemical 
reaction by calculating the difference in entropy between the products and the reactants. 
More specifically,
To calculate 𝚫S°rxn, subtract the standard entropies of the reactants 
multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients from the standard 
entropies of the products multiplied by their stoichiometric coeffi-
cients. In the form of an equation:
	
ΔS°rxn = a npS°(products) - a nrS°(reactants) 
[18.10]
In Equation 18.10, np represents the stoichiometric coefficients of the products, nr 
represents the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants, and S° represents the stan-
dard entropies. Keep in mind when using this equation that, unlike enthalpies of forma-
tion, which are zero for elements in their standard states, standard entropies are always nonzero 
at 25 °C. Example 18.5 demonstrates the application of Equation 18.10.

4 NH3(g) + 5 O2(g) ¡ 4 NO(g) + 6 H2O(g)

Begin by looking up the standard entropy for 
each reactant and product in Appendix IIB. 
Always note the correct state—(g), (l), (aq), or 
(s)—for each reactant and product.

ate values into Equation 18.10. Remember to 
include the stoichiometric coefficients in your 
calculation.
 ΔS°rxn = a npS°(products) - a nrS°(reactants)
 = [4(S°NO( g)) + 6(S°H2O( g))] - [4(S°NH3( g)) + 5(S°O2( g))]
 = [4(210.8 J>K) + 6(188.8 J>K)] - [4(192.8 J>K) + 5(205.2 J>K)]
 = 1976.0 J>K - 1797.2 J>K = 178.8 J>K
CHECK Notice that ΔS°rxn is positive, as you would expect for a reaction in which the number of moles of gas increases.

Reactions: Calculating 𝚫G°rxn
In the previous section, we learned how to calculate the standard change in entropy for a 
chemical reaction (ΔS°rxn). However, the criterion for spontaneity at standard conditions 
is the standard change in free energy (𝚫G°rxn). In this section, we examine three 
methods to calculate the standard change in free energy for a reaction (ΔG°rxn). In the

first method, we calculate ΔH°rxn and ΔS°rxn from tabulated values of ΔH °f and S°, and then 
use the relationship ΔG°rxn = ΔH°rxn - TΔS°rxn to calculate ΔG°rxn. In the second method, 
we use tabulated values of free energies of formation to calculate ΔG°rxn directly. In the 
third method, we determine the free energy change for a stepwise reaction from the free 
energy changes of each of the steps. At the end of this section, we discuss what is “free” 
about free energy. Remember that ΔG°rxn is extremely useful because it tells us about the 
spontaneity of a process at standard conditions. The more negative ΔG°rxn is, the more 
spontaneous the process (the further it will go toward products to reach equilibrium).
Calculating Standard Free Energy Changes with 
𝚫G°rxn = 𝚫H°rxn −T𝚫S°rxn
In Chapter 6 (Section 6.9), we used tabulated values of standard enthalpies of formation 
to calculate ΔH °rxn. In the previous section of this chapter, we used tabulated values of 
standard entropies to calculate ΔS°rxn. We can use these calculated values of ΔH°rxn and 
ΔS°rxn to determine the standard free energy change for a reaction by using the equation:
	
ΔG°rxn = ΔH °rxn - TΔS°rxn
[18.11]
Since tabulated values of standard enthalpies of formation (ΔH °f) and standard entropies 
(S°) are usually applicable at 25 °C, the equation should (strictly speaking) be valid only 
when T = 298 K (25 °C). However, the changes in ΔH °rxn and ΔS°rxn over a limited tem-
perature range are small when compared to the changes in the value of the temperature 
itself. Therefore, we can use Equation 18.11 to estimate changes in free energy at temper-
atures other than 25 °C.

kelvins.
 T = 25 + 273 = 298 K
 ΔG°rxn = ΔH°rxn - TΔS°rxn
 = -98.9 * 103 J - 298 K (-94.0 J>K)
 = -70.9 * 103 J = -70.9 kJ
The reaction is spontaneous at this temperature because 
ΔG°rxn is negative.

Example 18.7	
Estimating the Standard Change in Free Energy for a Reaction at a 
Temperature Other Than 25 °C Using 𝚫G°rxn = 𝚫H°rxn −T𝚫S°rxn
For the reaction in Example 18.6, estimate the value of ΔG°rxn at 125 °C. Is the reaction more or less spontaneous at  
this elevated temperature; that is, is the value of ΔG°rxn more negative (more spontaneous) or more positive (less 
spontaneous)?
Solution
Estimate ΔG°rxn at the new temperature using the 
­calculated values of ΔH°rxn and ΔS°rxn from Example 18.6. 
For T, convert the given temperature to kelvins. Make sure 
to use the same units for ΔH°rxn and ΔS°rxn (usually joules).
 T = 125 + 273 = 398 K
 ΔG°rxn = ΔH°rxn - TΔS°rxn
 = -98.9 * 103  J - 398 K (-94.0 J>K)
 = -61.5 * 103 J
 = -61.5 kJ
Since the value of ΔG°rxn at this elevated temperature is less 
negative (or more positive) than the value of ΔG°rxn at 25 °C 
(which is -70.9  kJ), the reaction is less spontaneous.
For Practice 18.7  For the reaction in For Practice 18.6, calculate the value of ΔG°rxn at -55 °C. Is the reaction more 
spontaneous (more negative ΔG°rxn) or less spontaneous (more positive ΔG°rxn) at the lower temperature?
Calculating 𝚫G°rxn with Tabulated Values of Free 
Energies of Formation
Because ΔG°rxn is the change in free energy for a chemical reaction—the difference in 
free energy between the products and the reactants—and because free energy is a state 
function, we can calculate ΔG°rxn by subtracting the free energies of the reactants of 
the reaction from the free energies of the products of the reaction. Also, since we are 
interested only in changes in free energy (and not in absolute values of free energy), we 
are free to define the zero of free energy as conveniently as possible. By analogy with our 
definition of enthalpies of formation, we define the free energy of formation (𝚫G°f) 
as follows:
The free energy of formation (𝚫G°f) is the change in free energy when 
1 mol of a compound in its standard state forms from its constituent 
elements in their standard states. The free energy of formation of 
pure elements in their standard states is zero.
We can measure all changes in free energy relative to pure elements in their stan-
dard states. To calculate ΔG°rxn, we subtract the free energies of formation of the reactants 
multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients from the free energies of formation of the 
products multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients. In the form of an equation:
	
ΔG°rxn = a npΔG°f (products) - a nr ΔG°f (reactants) 
[18.12]
In Equation 18.12, np represents the stoichiometric coefficients of the products, nr repre-
sents the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants, and ΔG°f represents the standard 
free energies of formation.
Table 18.3 lists ΔG°f values for selected substances. You can find a more complete 
list in Appendix IIB. Notice that, by definition, elements have standard free energies 
of formation of zero. Notice also that most compounds have negative standard free 
energies of formation. This means that those compounds spontaneously form from 
their elements in their standard states. Compounds with positive free energies of 
­formation do not spontaneously form from their elements and are therefore less 
common.
Example 18.8 demonstrates the calculation of ΔG°rxn from ΔG°f values. This method 
of calculating ΔG°rxn works only at the temperature for which the free energies of forma-
tion are tabulated, namely, 25 °C. To estimate ΔG°rxn at other temperatures we must use 
ΔG°rxn = ΔH°rxn - T ΔS°rxn, as demonstrated previously.

For Practice 18.8  One of the reactions that occurs within a catalytic converter in the exhaust pipe of a car is the 
simultaneous oxidation of carbon monoxide and reduction of NO (both of which are harmful pollutants):
2 CO(g) + 2 NO(g) ¡ 2 CO2(g) + N2(g)
Use standard free energies of formation to determine ΔG°rxn for this reaction at 25 °C. Is the reaction spontaneous at 
­standard conditions?
For More Practice 18.8  In For Practice 18.8, you calculated ΔG°rxn for the simultaneous oxidation of carbon 
monoxide and reduction of NO using standard free energies of formation. Calculate ΔG°rxn for that reaction again at 
25 °C, only this time use ΔG°rxn = ΔH°rxn - TΔS°rxn. How do the two values compare? Use your results to calculate ΔG°rxn  
at 500.0 K and explain why you could not calculate ΔG°rxn at 500.0 K using tabulated standard free energies of formation.

Chemistry IN YOUR DAY | Making a Nonspontaneous Process Spontaneous
A 
process that is nonspontaneous can be made  
spontaneous by coupling it with another process 
that is highly spontaneous. For example, hydrogen 
gas is a potential future fuel because it can be used 
in a fuel cell (a type of battery in which the reactants 
are constantly supplied—see Chapter 19) to generate 
electricity. The main problem with switching to hydro-
gen is securing a source. Where can we get the huge 
amounts of hydrogen gas that would be needed to 
meet our world’s energy needs?
Earth’s oceans and lakes, of course, contain vast 
amounts of hydrogen. But that hydrogen is locked up in water 
­molecules, and the decomposition of water into hydrogen and 
­oxygen has a positive ΔG°rxn and is therefore nonspontaneous:
H2o(g) ¡ H2(g) + 1
2 o2(g) ΔG°rxn = +228.6 kJ
If we add the two reactions together, we get a negative ΔG°rxn:
Nonspontaneous
Spontaneous
H2O(g) + CO(g)
H2(g) + CO2(g)
∆G°rxn = −28.6 kJ
CO(g) + 1
2O2(g)
CO2(g)
∆G°rxn = −257.2kJ
H2O( g)
H2(g) + 1
2O2(g)
∆G°rxn = +228.6kJ
The reaction between water and carbon monoxide is thus a 
spontaneous way to generate hydrogen gas.
The coupling of nonspontaneous reactions with highly 
spontaneous ones is also important in biological systems. The 
synthesis reactions that create the complex biological mole-
cules (such as proteins and DNA) needed by living organisms, 
for example, are themselves nonspontaneous. Living systems 
grow and reproduce by coupling these nonspontaneous 
­reactions to highly spontaneous ones. The main spontaneous 
reaction that ultimately drives the nonspontaneous ones is the 
metabolism of food. The oxidation of glucose, for example, is 
highly spontaneous:
C6H12o6(s) + 6 o2(g) ¡ 6 Co2(g) + 6 H2o(l)
ΔG°rxn = -2880 kJ
Spontaneous reactions such as these ultimately drive the 
nonspontaneous reactions necessary to sustain life.
To obtain hydrogen from water, we need to find another 
reaction with a highly negative ΔG°rxn that can couple with 
the decomposition reaction to give an overall reaction with a 
negative ΔG°rxn. For example, the oxidation of carbon monox-
ide to carbon dioxide has a large negative ΔG°rxn and is highly 
spontaneous:
Co(g) + 1
2 o2(g) ¡ Co2(g) ΔG°rxn = -257.2 kJ
	
18.8  Free Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions: Calculating ΔG°rxn	
867
Calculating 𝚫G°rxn for a Stepwise Reaction  
from the Changes in Free Energy for Each of the Steps
Recall from Section 6.8 that because enthalpy is a state function, we can calculate ΔH°rxn 
for a stepwise reaction from the sum of the changes in enthalpy for each step (according 
to Hess’s law). Since free energy is also a state function, the same relationships that we 
covered in Chapter 6 for enthalpy also apply to free energy: 
1.	 If a chemical equation is multiplied by some factor, then ΔGrxn is also multiplied by 
the same factor.
2.	 If a chemical equation is reversed, then ΔGrxn changes sign.
3.	 If a chemical equation can be expressed as the sum of a series of steps, then ΔGrxn 
for the overall equation is the sum of the free energies of reactions for each step.
Example 18.9 illustrates the use of these relationships to calculate ΔG°rxn for a ­stepwise 
reaction.

Solution
To work this problem, you need to manipulate the given reactions with known values of ΔG°rxn in such a way as to get the 
reactants of interest on the left, the products of interest on the right, and other species to cancel.
Since the first reaction has C3H8 as a reactant, 
and the reaction of interest has C3H8 as a 
­product, reverse the first reaction and change 
the sign of ΔG°rxn.
3 CO2(g) + 4 H2O(g) ¡ C3H8(g) + 5 O2(g)      
ΔG°rxn = +2074 kJ
The second reaction has C as a reactant and 
CO2 as a product, as required in the reaction of 
interest. However, the coefficient for C is 1, and 
in the reaction of interest, the coefficient for C 
is 3. Therefore, multiply this equation and its 
ΔG°rxn by 3.
3 * [C(s) + O2(g) ¡ CO2(g)]           ΔG°rxn = 3 * (-394.4 kJ)
= -1183 kJ
In the third reaction H2(g) is a reactant, as 
­required. However, the coefficient for H2 is 2, 
and in the reaction of interest, the coefficient 
for H2 is 4. Multiply this reaction and its ΔG°rxn 
by 2.
2 * [2 H2(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 H2O(g)]            ΔG°rxn = 2 * (-457.1 kJ)
= -914.2
Lastly, rewrite the three reactions after multi-
plying through by the indicated factors and 
show how they sum to the reaction of interest. 
ΔG°rxn for the reaction of interest is then the 
sum of the ΔG’s for the steps.
 3 CO2(g) + 4 H2O(g) ¡ C3H8(g) + 5 O2(g)    ΔG°rxn = +2074 kJ
 3 C(s) + 3 O2(g) ¡ 3 CO2(g)   
 ΔG°rxn = -1183 kJ
 4 H2(g) + 2 O2(g) ¡ 4 H2O(g)   
 ΔG°rxn = -914.2 kJ
3 C(s) + 4 H2(g) ¡ C3H8(g)   
 ΔG°rxn = -23 kJ
For Practice 18.9 
Find ΔG°rxn for the reaction:
N2O(g) + NO2(g) ¡  3 NO(g)
Use the following reactions with known ΔG°rxn values:
 2 NO(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 NO2(g)  
 ΔG°rxn = -71.2 kJ
 N2(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 NO(g)  
 ΔG°rxn = +175.2 kJ
 2 N2O(g) ¡ 2 N2(g) + O2(g)   ΔG°rxn = -207.4 kJ

Why Free Energy Is “Free”
We often want to use the energy released by a chemical reaction to do work. For example, 
in an automobile engine, we use the energy released by the combustion of gasoline to 
move the car forward. The change in free energy of a chemical reaction represents the 
maximum amount of energy available, or free, to do work (if ΔG°rxn is negative).
For many reactions, the change in free energy is less than the change in enthalpy for 
the reaction. Consider the reaction between carbon and hydrogen occurring at 25 °C :
C(s, graphite) + 2 H2(g) ¡ CH4(g)
 ΔH°rxn = -74.6 kJ
 ΔS°rxn = -80.8 J>K
 ΔG°rxn = -50.5 kJ
The reaction is exothermic and gives off 74.6 kJ of heat energy. However, the maximum 
amount of energy available for useful work is only 50.5 kJ (Figure 18.10◀). Why? We can 
see that the change in entropy of the system is negative. Nevertheless, the reaction is 
spontaneous. This is possible only if some of the emitted heat goes to increase the 
entropy of the surroundings by an amount sufficient to make the change in entropy of 
the universe positive. The amount of energy available to do work (the free energy) is what 
remains after accounting for the heat that must be lost to the surroundings.
Minimum heat lost
to surroundings = 24.1 kJ
Maximum work = 50.5 kJ
C(s, graphite) + 2 H2(g)
CH4(g)
∆H°rxn = −74.6 kJ
▲ Figure 18.10  Free Energy   
Although the reaction produces 
74.6 kJ of heat, only a maximum 
of 50.5 kJ is available to do work. 
The rest of the energy is lost to the 
surroundings.

The change in free energy for a chemical reaction represents a theoretical limit as to 
how much work can be done by the reaction. In a real reaction, the amount of energy 
available to do work is even less than ΔG°rxn because additional energy is lost to the 
surroundings as heat. The only reactions that reach the theoretical limit are reversible 
reactions (see Section 18.4 for the definition of reversible processes). A reversible 
chemical reaction occurs infinitesimally slowly, and the free energy is drawn out in 
infinitesimally small increments that exactly match the amount of energy that the 
reaction is producing during that increment (Figure 18.11▲).
All real reactions are irreversible and therefore do not achieve the theoretical limit 
of available free energy. Let’s return to the discharging battery from the opening section 
of this chapter as an example of this concept. A battery contains chemical reactants con-
figured in such a way that, upon spontaneous reaction, they produce an electrical cur-
rent. We can harness the free energy released by the reaction to do work. For example, an 
electric motor can be wired to the battery. Flowing electrical current makes the motor 
turn (Figure 18.12▶).
Because of the resistance in the wire, the flowing electrical current also produces 
some heat, which is lost to the surroundings and is not available to do work. The amount 
of free energy lost as heat can be decreased by slowing down the rate of current flow. The 
slower the rate of current flow, the less free energy is lost as heat and the more is avail-
able to do work. However, only in the theoretical case of infinitesimally slow current 
flow is the maximum amount of work (equal to ΔG°rxn) done. Any real rate of current 
flow results in some loss of energy as heat. This lost energy is the “heat tax” that we dis-
cussed in the opening section of this chapter.
Recharging the battery necessarily requires more energy than is obtained as work 
because some of the energy is lost as heat. In other words, during discharging and 
recharging, the battery has gone through a cycle in which it returns to its original 
(charged) state. However, the surroundings have gained some heat during the process, 
and the entropy of the surroundings has increased (which makes the process spontane-
ous). Any real (or irreversible) cyclical process such as this suffers the same fate—the sys-
tem may return to its original state, but the surroundings do not, resulting in the 
permanent dispersal of energy to the surroundings.
If the change in free energy of a chemical reaction is positive, then ΔG°rxn represents 
the minimum amount of energy required to make the reaction occur. Again, ΔG°rxn represents a 
theoretical limit. Making a real nonspontaneous reaction occur always requires more 
energy than the theoretical limit.

▲ Figure 18.11  A Reversible Process  In a reversible process, the free energy is drawn out

a series of small expansions in which the weight of sand almost exactly matches the pressure of 
the expanding gas. This process is close to reversible—each sand grain would need to have an 
infinitesimally small mass for the process to be fully reversible.
Applying the definition of reversibility 
from Section 18.4, a reversible 
chemical reaction is one that changes 
direction upon an infinitesimally 
small change in a variable (such as 
temperature or pressure) related to 
the reaction.

	 18.9	 Free Energy Changes for Nonstandard 
States: The Relationship between  
𝚫G°rxn and 𝚫Grxn
We have learned how to calculate the standard free energy change for a reaction 
(ΔG°rxn). However, the standard free energy change applies only to a very narrow set of 
conditions, namely, those conditions in which the reactants and products are in their 
standard states.
Standard versus Nonstandard States
Consider the standard free energy change for the evaporation of liquid water to gaseous 
water:
H2O(l) ∆H2O(g)   ΔG°rxn = +8.59 kJ>mol
The standard free energy change for this process is positive, so the process is nonsponta-
neous. But you know that if you spill water onto the floor under ordinary conditions, it 
spontaneously evaporates. Why? Because under ordinary conditions the reactants and prod-
ucts are not in their standard states and ΔG°rxn applies only when the reactants and product 
are in their standard states, sometimes called standard conditions. For a gas (such as the 
water vapor in the reaction just given), the standard state is that the pure gas is present at 
a partial pressure of 1 atmosphere. In a flask containing liquid water and water vapor in 
its standard state (PH2O = 1 atm) at 25 °C the water does not vaporize. In fact, since ΔG°rxn 
is negative for the reverse reaction, the reaction spontaneously occurs in reverse—water 
vapor condenses.
In open air under ordinary circumstances, the partial pressure of water vapor is 
much less than 1 atm. The state of the water vapor is not its standard state, and therefore 
the value of ΔG°rxn does not apply. For the nonstandard state, we must calculate ΔGrxn (as 
opposed to ΔG°rxn) to predict spontaneity.
The Free Energy Change of a Reaction  
under Nonstandard Conditions
We can calculate the free energy change of a reaction under nonstandard 
conditions (𝚫Grxn) from ΔG°rxn using the relationship:
	
ΔGrxn = ΔG°rxn + RT ln Q 
[18.13]
where Q is the reaction quotient (defined in Section 15.7), T is the temperature in 
­kelvins, and R is the gas constant in the appropriate units (8.314 J>mol # K).
In Equation 18.13 and all subsequent thermodynamic equations, we use Q p for reac-
tions involving gases, and we use Q c for reactions involving substances dissolved in solu-
tion. We can demonstrate the use of this equation by applying it to the liquid–vapor 
water equilibrium under several different conditions, as shown in Figure 18.13▶. Note 
that by the law of mass action, for this equilibrium, Q = PH2O (where the pressure is 
expressed in atmospheres):
H2O(l) ¡ H2O(g)  Q = PH2O
Standard Conditions
Under standard conditions, PH2O = 1 atm and therefore Q = 1. Substituting, we get the 
expression:
 ΔGrxn = ΔG°rxn + RT ln Q
 = +8.59 kJ>mol + RT ln(1)
 = +8.59 kJ>mol
▲ Spilled water spontaneously 
evaporates even though ΔG° for the 
vaporization of water is positive. 
Why?

Under standard conditions, Q is always equal to 1, and since ln(1) = 0, the value of 
ΔGrxn is therefore equal to ΔG°rxn, as expected. For the liquid–vapor water equilibrium, 
because ΔG°rxn 7 0, the reaction is not spontaneous in the forward direction but is spon-
taneous in the reverse direction. As stated previously, under standard conditions water 
vapor condenses into liquid water.
Equilibrium Conditions
At 25.00 °C, liquid water is in equilibrium with water vapor at a pressure of 0.0313 atm; 
therefore, Q = Kp = 0.0313. Substituting:
 ΔGrxn = ΔG°rxn + RT  ln (0.0313)
 = +8.59 kJ>mol + 8.314 
J
mol # K
 (298.15 K) ln (0.0313)
 = +8.59 kJ>mol + (-8.59 * 103 J>mol)
 = +8.59 kJ>mol - 8.59 kJ>mol
 = 0
Under equilibrium conditions, the value of RT ln Q is always equal in magnitude but 
opposite in sign to the value of ΔG°rxn. Therefore, the value of ΔGrxn is zero. Because 
ΔGrxn = 0, the reaction is not spontaneous in either direction, as expected for a reaction 
at equilibrium.

Chapter 18  Free Energy and Thermodynamics
Other Nonstandard Conditions
To calculate the value of ΔGrxn under any other set of nonstandard conditions, calculate 
Q and substitute the value into Equation 18.13. For example, the partial pressure of water 
vapor in the air on a dry (nonhumid) day is 5.00 * 10 - 3 atm, so Q = 5.00 * 10 - 3. 
Substituting:
 ΔGrxn = ΔG°rxn + RT  ln (5.00 * 10 - 3)
 = +8.59 kJ>mol + 8.314 
J
mol # K
 (298 K) ln(5.00 * 10 - 3)
 = +8.59 kJ>mol + (-13.1 * 103 J>mol)
 = +8.59 kJ>mol - 13.1 kJ>mol
 = -4.5 kJ>mol
Under these conditions, the value of ΔGrxn 6 0, so the reaction is spontaneous in the 
forward direction, consistent with our experience of water evaporating when spilled on 
the floor.
Example 18.10	
Calculating 𝚫Grxn under Nonstandard Conditions
Consider the reaction at 298 K:
2 NO(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 NO2(g)   ΔG°rxn = -71.2 kJ
Calculate ΔGrxn under these conditions:
PNO = 0.100 atm;  PO2 = 0.100 atm;  PNO2 = 2.00 atm
Is the reaction more or less spontaneous under these conditions than under standard conditions?
Solution
Use the law of mass action to calculate Q.
Q =
(PNO2)2
(PNO)2 PO2
=
(2.00)2
(0.100)2(0.100)
= 4.00 * 103
Substitute Q, T, and ΔG°rxn into Equation 18.13 to 
calculate ΔGrxn. (Since the units of R include joules, 
write ΔG°rxn in joules.)
 ΔGrxn = ΔG°rxn +  RT ln Q
 = -71.2 * 103 J + 8.314 
J
mol # K (298 K) ln(4.00 * 103)
 = -71.2 * 103 J + 20.5 * 103 J
 = -50.7 * 103 J
 = -50.7 kJ
The reaction is spontaneous under these conditions, but less 
spontaneous than it would be under standard conditions 
­(because ΔGrxn is less negative than ΔG°rxn).
CHECK The calculated result is consistent with what you would expect based on Le Châtelier’s principle; increasing the 
concentration of the products and decreasing the concentration of the reactants relative to standard conditions should 
make the reaction less spontaneous than it was under standard conditions.
For Practice 18.10  Consider the reaction at 298 K:
2 H2S(g) + SO2(g) ¡ 3 S(s, rhombic) + 2 H2O(g) ΔG°rxn = -102 kJ
Calculate ΔGrxn under these conditions:
PH2S = 2.00 atm; PSO2 = 1.50 atm; PH2O = 0.0100 atm
Is the reaction more or less spontaneous under these conditions than under standard conditions?
A water partial pressure of 
5.00 * 10 - 3 atm corresponds to a 
relative humidity of 16% at 25 °C.

	
18.10  Free Energy and Equilibrium: Relating ΔG°rxn to the Equilibrium Constant (K)	
873
	18.10	 Free Energy and Equilibrium: Relating 
𝚫G°rxn to the Equilibrium Constant (K)
We have discussed throughout this chapter that ΔG°rxn determines the spontaneity of 
a reaction when the reactants and products are in their standard states. In Chapter 15, 
we learned that the equilibrium constant (K) determines how far a reaction goes toward 
products, a measure of spontaneity. Therefore, as you might expect, the standard free 
energy change of a reaction and the equilibrium constant are related—the equilibrium 
constant becomes larger as the standard free energy change becomes more negative. In 
other words, if, on the one hand, the reactants in a particular reaction undergo a large 
negative free energy change as they become products, then the reaction has a large 
equilibrium constant, with products strongly favored at equilibrium. If, on the other 
hand, the reactants in a particular reaction undergo a large positive free energy change 
as they become products, then the reaction has a small equilibrium constant, with 
reactants strongly favored at equilibrium.
The Relationship between 𝚫G°rxn and K
We can derive a relationship between ΔG°rxn and K from Equation 18.13. We know that at 
equilibrium Q = K and ΔGrxn = 0. Making these substitutions:
 ΔGrxn = ΔG°rxn + RT ln Q
 0 = ΔG°rxn + RT ln K
	
 ΔG°rxn = -RT ln K 
[18.14]
In Equation 18.14 and all subsequent thermodynamic equations, we use Kp for reactions 
involving gases, and we use Kc for reactions involving substances dissolved in solution.
We can better understand the relationship between ΔG°rxn and K by considering the 
following ranges of values for K, as summarized in Figure 18.14▶:
• When K 6 1, ln K is negative and ΔG°rxn is positive. Under standard conditions 
(when Q = 1) the reaction is spontaneous in the reverse direction.
• When K 7 1, ln K is positive and ΔG°rxn is negative. Under standard conditions 
(when Q = 1) the reaction is spontaneous in the forward direction.
• When K = 1, ln K is zero and ΔG°rxn is zero. The reaction happens to be at equilibri-
um under standard conditions.

Free Energy Changes and Le Châtelier’s Principle  According to 
Le Châtelier’s principle and the dependence of free energy on reactant and product 
concentrations, which statement is true? (Assume that both reactants and products are 
gaseous.)
(a)	 A high concentration of reactants relative to products results in a more 
­spontaneous reaction than one in which the reactants and products are in their 
standard states.
(b)	 A high concentration of products relative to reactants results in a more 
­spontaneous reaction than one in which the reactants and products are in their 
standard states.
(c)	 A reaction in which the reactants are in standard states, but in which no 
­products have formed, has a ΔGrxn that is more positive than ΔG°rxn.
The relationship between ΔG°rxn and 
K is logarithmic—small changes in 
ΔG°rxn have a large effect on K.

18.10  Free Energy and Equilibrium: Relating ΔG°rxn to the Equilibrium Constant (K)	
875
The Temperature Dependence of the  
Equilibrium Constant
We now have an equation that relates the standard free energy change for a reaction 
(ΔG°rxn) to the equilibrium constant for a reaction (K):
	
ΔG°rxn = -RT ln K
[18.15]
We also have an equation for how the free energy change for a reaction (ΔG°rxn) 
depends on temperature (T):
	
ΔG°rxn = ΔH°rxn - T ΔS°rxn
[18.16]
We can combine these two equations to obtain an equation for how the equilibrium 
constant depends on temperature. Combining Equations 18.15 and 18.16, we arrive at:
	
-RT ln K = ΔH°rxn - TΔS°rxn
[18.17]
We can then divide both sides of Equation 18.17 by the quantity RT:
-ln K =  ΔH °rxn
RT
- TΔS°rxn
RT
Canceling and rearranging, we get this important result:
	
ln K = - ΔH °rxn

y = mx + b
Equation 18.18 is in the form of a straight line. A plot of the natural log of the equilib-
rium constant (ln K) versus the inverse of the temperature in kelvins (1>T) yields a straight 
line with a slope of -ΔH °rxn>R and a y-intercept of ΔS °rxn>R. Such a plot is useful for obtain-
ing thermodynamic data (namely, ΔH °rxn and ΔS °rxn) from measurements of K as a function 
of temperature. However, since ΔH °rxn and ΔS °rxn can themselves be slightly temperature 
dependent, this analysis works only over a relatively limited temperature range.

Key Concepts
Nature’s Heat Tax: You Can’t Win and You Can’t 
Break Even (18.1)
▶
▶The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be neither 
created nor destroyed.
▶
▶According to the second law of thermodynamics, in every energy 
transaction, some energy is lost to the surroundings; this lost en-
ergy is nature’s heat tax.
Spontaneous and Nonspontaneous Processes (18.2)
▶
▶Both spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes can occur, but 
only spontaneous processes can take place without outside inter-
vention.
▶
▶Thermodynamics is the study of the spontaneity of reactions, not 
to be confused with kinetics, the study of the rate of reactions.
Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics 
(18.3)
▶
▶The second law of thermodynamics states that for any spontane-
ous process, the entropy of the universe increases.
▶
▶Entropy (S) is proportional to the number of energetically equiva-
lent ways in which the components of a system can be arranged 
and is a measure of energy dispersal per unit temperature.
The Entropy Changes Associated with Changes of 
State (18.4)
▶
▶The entropy of a substance increases as it changes state from a 
­solid to a liquid and when it changes from a liquid to a gas.
▶
▶The change in entropy for a system undergoing a reversible change 
in state is ΔS = qrev>T.
Heat Transfer and Changes in the Entropy of the 
Surroundings (18.5)
▶
▶For a process to be spontaneous, the total entropy of the universe 
(system plus surroundings) must increase.
▶
▶The entropy of the surroundings increases when the change in 
enthalpy of the system (ΔHsys) is negative (i.e., for exothermic reac-
tions).
▶
▶The change in entropy of the surroundings for a given ΔHsys 
­depends inversely on temperature—the greater the temperature, 
the smaller the magnitude of ΔSsurr.
Gibbs Free Energy (18.6)
▶
▶Gibbs free energy, G, is a thermodynamic function that is propor-
tional to the negative of the change in the entropy of the universe. 
A negative ΔG represents a spontaneous reaction and a positive 
ΔG represents a nonspontaneous reaction.
▶
▶We can calculate the value of ΔG for a reaction from the values of 
ΔH and ΔS for the system using the equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS.
Entropy Changes in Chemical Reactions: 
Calculating 𝚫S°rxn (18.7)
▶
▶We calculate the standard change in entropy for a reaction 
­similarly to the way we calculate the standard change in enthalpy

Chapter 18  Free Energy and Thermodynamics
for a reaction: by subtracting the sum of the standard entropies of 
the reactants multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients from 
the sum of the standard entropies of the products multiplied by 
their stoichiometric coefficients.
▶
▶Standard entropies are absolute; an entropy of zero is established 
by the third law of thermodynamics as the entropy of a perfect 
crystal at absolute zero.
▶
▶The entropy of a substance at a given temperature depends on 
factors that affect the number of energetically equivalent arrange-
ments of the substance; these include the state, size, and molecu-
lar complexity of the substance.
Free Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions: 
Calculating 𝚫G°rxn (18.8)
▶
▶There are three ways to calculate ΔG°rxn: (1) from ΔH° and ΔS°, (2) 
from free energies of formation (only at 25 °C), and (3) from the 
ΔG°’s of reactions that sum to the reaction of interest.
▶
▶The magnitude of a negative ΔG°rxn represents the theoretical 
amount of energy available to do work, while a positive ΔG°rxn 
represents the minimum amount of energy required to make a 
nonspontaneous process occur.
Free Energy Changes for Nonstandard States: The 
Relationship between 𝚫G°rxn and 𝚫Grxn (18.9)
▶
▶The value of ΔG°rxn applies only to standard conditions, and most 
real conditions are not standard.
▶
▶Under nonstandard conditions, we can calculate ΔGrxn from the 
equation ΔGrxn = ΔG°rxn + RT ln Q.
Free Energy and Equilibrium: Relating 𝚫G°rxn to the 
Equilibrium Constant (K) (18.10)
▶
▶Under standard conditions, the free energy change for a reaction 
is directly proportional to the negative of the natural log of the 
equilibrium constant, K; the more negative the free energy change 
(i.e., the more spontaneous the reaction), the larger the equilib-
rium constant.
▶
▶We can use the temperature dependence of ΔG°rxn, as given by 
ΔG° = ΔH° -  TΔS°, to derive an expression for the temperature 
dependence of the equilibrium constant.

Challenge Problems
	103. 	Review the box in this chapter entitled Chemistry in Your 
Day: Making a Nonspontaneous Process Spontaneous. The 
hydrolysis of ATP, shown in Problem 91, is often used to drive 
nonspontaneous processes—such as muscle contraction and 
protein synthesis—in living organisms. The nonspontaneous 
process to be driven must be coupled to the ATP hydrolysis 
reaction. 
For 
example, 
suppose 
the 
nonspontaneous 
process is A + B ¡ AB (ΔG° positive). The coupling of a 
nonspontaneous reaction such as this one to the hydrolysis of 
ATP is often accomplished by the mechanism:
 A + ATP + H2O ¡ A¬ Pi + ADP
 A¬ Pi + B ¡  AB + Pi
 A + B + ATP + H2O ¡  AB + ADP + Pi
As long as ΔGrxn for the nonspontaneous reaction is less than 
30.5 kJ, the reaction can be made spontaneous by coupling  
in this way to the hydrolysis of ATP. Suppose that ATP is to 
drive the reaction between glutamate and ammonia to form

Thermodynamic Functions for Borax
	123. 	Borax (sodium tetraboratedecahydrate), a mineral found in 
dry lakebeds in California, is used as a preservative and in the 
manufacturing of soap and glass. By determining the Ksp of 
borax at different temperatures, we can determine ΔH°, ΔS°, and 
ΔG° for the dissolution of borax:
Na2B4O5(OH)4 # 8 H2O(s) ¡ 2 Na+(aq) + B4O5(OH)4
2-(aq) + 8 H2O(l)

has the form of a linear equation y = mx + b, where y is the 
 lnKsp and x is 1>T (T in Kelvin). The slope is equal to - ΔH°>R, 
and the y intercept is ΔS°>R, where R is the gas constant, 8.314 J>
K mol. Determining Ksp at several different temperatures ­allows 
us to plot a graph of lnK versus 1>T as shown in Figure a▼.
Knowing the values of ΔH° and ΔS° at a specific tempera-
ture allows the calculation of the change in Gibbs free energy 
for the reaction ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS°.

Answers to Conceptual Connections
Nature’s Heat Tax and Diet
18.1	 A person subsisting on a vegetarian diet eats fruits and 
­vegetables, metabolizing the energy-containing molecules 
of these foods directly. A person subsisting on a meat-based 
diet eats the meat of animals such as cows and metabolizes 
­energy-containing molecules that were part of the animals. 
Beef cattle synthesize their energy-containing molecules from 
compounds that they obtain by eating and digesting plants. 
Since breaking down and resynthesizing biological molecules 
requires energy—and since the cattle also need to extract some 
of the energy from their food to live—a meat-based diet neces-
sitates additional energy transactions in the overall process of 
obtaining energy for life. Due to nature’s heat tax, the meat-
based diet is less efficient than the vegetarian diet.
Entropy
18.2	 (a) The more spread out the particles are between the three 
boxes, the greater the entropy. Therefore, the entropy change 
is positive only in scheme (a).
Entropy and Biological Systems
18.3	 Biological systems do not violate the second law of thermody-
namics. The key to understanding this concept is realizing that 
entropy changes in the system can be negative as long as the 
entropy change of the universe is positive. Biological systems 
can decrease their own entropy, but only at the expense of cre-
ating more entropy in the surroundings (which they do pri-
marily by emitting the heat they generate by their metabolic 
processes). Thus, for any biological process, ΔSuniv is positive.
𝚫H, 𝚫S, and 𝚫G
18.4	 (a) Sublimation is endothermic (it requires energy to overcome 
the intermolecular forces that hold solid carbon dioxide to-
gether), so ΔH is positive. The number of moles of gas increases 
when the solid turns into a gas, so the entropy of the carbon di-
oxide increases and ΔS is positive. Since ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, ΔG 
is positive at low temperature and negative at high tempera-
ture.
Standard Entropies
18.5	 Kr 6 Cl2 6 SO3. Because krypton is a monoatomic gas, it has 
the least entropy. Because SO3 is the most complex molecule, 
it has the most entropy. The molar masses of the three gases 
vary slightly, but not enough to overcome the differences in 
molecular complexity.
Free Energy Changes and Le Châtelier’s Principle
18.6	 (a) A high concentration of reactants relative to products will 
lead to Q 6 1, making the term RT ln Q in Equation 18.14 
negative. ΔGrxn is more negative than ΔG°rxn and the reaction 
is more spontaneous.
K and 𝚫G°rxn
18.7	 (c) Since the equilibrium constant is less than 1, the reaction 
proceeds toward reactants under standard conditions (when 
Q = 1). Therefore, ΔG°rxn is positive.
The Conditions of Spontaneity
18.8	 ΔGrxn 6 0, Q 6 K

his chapter’s opening quote from Michael Faraday illustrates an important aspect of 
basic research (research for the sake of understanding how nature works). The 
Chancellor of the Exchequer (the British cabinet minister responsible for all finan-
cial matters) wanted to know how Michael Faraday’s apparently esoteric investigations of 
electricity would ever be useful to the empire. Faraday responded in a way that the chan-
cellor would understand—he pointed out the eventual financial payoff. Today electricity 
is a fundamental form of energy, powering our entire economy. Although basic research 
does not always lead to useful applications, much of the technology our society relies on 
has grown out of basic research. The history of modern science shows that we must first 
understand nature (the goal of basic research) before we can harness its power. In this 
chapter, we discuss oxidation–reduction reactions (first introduced in Chapter 4) and how 
we can exploit them to generate electricity. The applications range from the batteries that 
power flashlights to the fuel cells that may one day power our homes and automobiles.
	 19.1	 Pulling the Plug on the Power Grid
The power grid distributes centrally generated electricity throughout the country to 
homes and businesses. When you turn on a light or electrical appliance, electricity flows 
from the grid through the wires in your home to the light or appliance. The electrical 
energy is converted into light within the lightbulb or into work within the appliance. 
The average U.S. household consumes about 1000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity 
per month. The local electrical utility monitors your electricity use and bills you for it.
The kilowatt-hour is a unit of energy 
first introduced in Section 6.2.

890	
Chapter 19  Electrochemistry
In the future, you may have the option of disconnecting from the power grid. Several 
innovative companies are developing small, fuel-cell power plants—each no bigger than a 
refrigerator—to sit next to homes and quietly generate enough electricity to meet each 
household’s power needs. The heat produced by a fuel cell’s operation can be recaptured 
and used to heat water or the space within the home, eliminating the need for a hot-water 
heater or a furnace. Similar fuel cells can also power cars. Fuel cells are highly efficient and, 
although obstacles to their development and use must yet be overcome, one day they may 
supply a majority of our power while producing less pollution than fossil fuel combustion.
Fuel cells are based on oxidation–reduction reactions (see Section 4.9). The most 
common type of fuel cell—the hydrogen–oxygen fuel cell—is based on the reaction 
between hydrogen and oxygen:
2 H2(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 H2O(l)
In this reaction, hydrogen and oxygen form covalent bonds with one another. Recall that, 
according to the Lewis theory, a single covalent bond is a shared electron pair. However, 
since oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, the electron pair in a hydrogen–­
oxygen bond is not equally shared: oxygen gets the larger portion (see Section 9.6). In 
effect, oxygen has more electrons in H2O than it does in elemental O2—oxygen has 
gained electrons in the reaction and has therefore been reduced.
In a reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, oxygen atoms gain electrons directly 
from hydrogen atoms. In a hydrogen–oxygen fuel cell, this same redox reaction occurs, 
but the hydrogen and oxygen are separated, forcing electrons to travel through an exter-
nal wire to get from hydrogen to oxygen. The moving electrons constitute an electrical 
current. In this way, a fuel cell employs the electron-gaining tendency of oxygen and 
the electron-losing tendency of hydrogen to force electrons to move through a wire to 
create the electricity that can provide power for a home or an electric automobile. 
Smaller fuel cells can also replace batteries and be used to power consumer electronics 
such as laptop computers, smartphones, and MP3 players. The generation of electricity 
from spontaneous redox reactions (such as those that occur in a fuel cell) and the use of 
electricity to drive nonspontaneous redox reactions (such as those that occur in gold or 
silver plating) are examples of electrochemistry, the subject of this chapter.
	 19.2	 Balancing Oxidation–Reduction 
Equations
Recall from Section 4.9 that oxidation is the loss of electrons, and reduction is the gain 
of electrons. Recall also that we can identify oxidation–reduction reactions through 
changes in oxidation states: oxidation corresponds to an increase in oxidation state, and 
reduction corresponds to a decrease in oxidation state. For example, consider the following 
reaction between calcium and water:
Ca(s) +
+
2 H2O(l)
Ca(OH)2(aq)
H2(g)
+2
−2
−2 +1
+1
0
0
Oxidation
Reduction
Because calcium increases in oxidation state from 0 to +2, it is oxidized. Because hydro-
gen decreases in oxidation state from +1 to 0, it is reduced.
Balancing redox reactions can be more complicated than balancing other types of 
reactions because both the mass (or number of each type of atom) and the charge must 
be balanced. We can balance redox reactions occurring in aqueous solutions with a spe-
cial procedure called the half-reaction method of balancing. In this procedure, we break 
down the overall equation into two half-reactions: one for oxidation and one for reduc-
tion. We then balance the half-reactions individually and add them together. The steps 
differ slightly for reactions occurring in acidic and in basic solution. Examples 19.1 and 
19.2 demonstrate the method for an acidic solution, and Example 19.3 demonstrates the 
method for a basic solution.

cell can power an entire house.
▲ The Toyota Mirai is the first mass-
produced fuel-cell vehicle that runs 
on hydrogen gas and produces only 
water as exhaust.

	 19.3	 Voltaic (or Galvanic) Cells: Generating 
Electricity from Spontaneous Chemical 
Reactions
Electrical current is the flow of electric charge. Electrons flowing through a wire or 
ions flowing through a solution both constitute electrical current. Since redox reactions 
involve the transfer of electrons from one substance to another, these reactions have the 
potential to generate electrical current as we discussed in Section 19.1.
For example, consider the spontaneous redox reaction:
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ¡ Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)
When Zn metal is placed in a Cu2+ solution, the greater tendency of zinc to lose elec-
trons results in Zn being oxidized and Cu2+ being reduced. Electrons are transferred 
directly from the Zn to the Cu2+ (Figure 19.1▶, on the next page). Although the actual 
process is more complicated, we can imagine that—on the atomic scale—a zinc atom 
within the zinc metal transfers two electrons to a copper ion in solution. The zinc atom 
then becomes a zinc ion dissolved in the solution. The copper ion accepts the two elec-
trons and is deposited on the zinc as solid copper.
Suppose we were to separate the zinc atoms and copper ions and force the electron 
transfer to occur another way—not directly from the zinc atom to the copper ion, but 
through a wire connecting the two half-reactions. The flowing electrons would consti-

A Spontaneous Redox Reaction: Zn + Cu2+
▶ Figure 19.1  A Spontaneous 
Oxidation–Reduction Reaction   
When zinc is immersed in a solution 
containing copper ions, the zinc 
atoms transfer electrons to the 
copper ions. The zinc atoms are 
oxidized and dissolve in the solution. 
The copper ions are reduced and are 
deposited on the electrode.
The Voltaic Cell
The generation of electricity through redox reactions is carried out in a device called 
an electrochemical cell. A voltaic (or galvanic) cell is an electrochemical cell 
that produces electrical current from a spontaneous chemical reaction. A second type of 
electrochemical cell, called an electrolytic cell, consumes electrical current to drive a 
nonspontaneous chemical reaction. We discuss voltaic cells in this section and electrolytic 
cells in Section 19.8.
In the voltaic cell in Figure 19.2▶, a solid strip of zinc is placed in a Zn(NO3)2 solu-
tion to form a half-cell. A solid strip of copper placed in a Cu(NO3)2 solution forms a 
second half-cell. The strips act as electrodes, conductive surfaces through which elec-
trons can enter or leave the half-cells. Each metal strip reaches equilibrium with its ions 
in solution according to these half-reactions:
 Zn(s) ∆Zn2+(aq) + 2 e-
 Cu(s) ∆Cu2+(aq) + 2 e-
However, the position of these equilibria is not the same for both metals. As we have 
just seen, the zinc has a greater tendency to ionize than the copper, so the zinc half-
reaction lies further to the right. As a result, the zinc electrode becomes negatively 
charged relative to the copper electrode.
If the two half-cells are connected by a wire running from the zinc—through a light-
bulb or other electrical device—to the copper, electrons spontaneously flow from the zinc 
electrode (which is more negatively charged, and therefore, repels electrons) to the cop-
per electrode. As the electrons flow away from the zinc electrode, the Zn/Zn2+ equilibrium 
shifts to the right (according to Le Châtelier’s principle) and oxidation occurs. As elec-
trons flow to the copper electrode, the Cu/Cu2+ equilibrium shifts to the left, and reduc-
tion occurs. The flowing electrons constitute an electrical current that lights the bulb.
The continual flow of electrical current 
in a voltaic cell requires a pathway 
by which counterions can flow to 
neutralize charge buildup; this is 
discussed later.
The idea that one electrode in a 
voltaic cell becomes more negatively 
charged relative to the other electrode 
due to differences in ionization 
tendencies is central to understanding 
how a voltaic cell works.

Current and Potential Difference
We can understand electrical current and why it flows by analogy with water current in a 
stream (Figure 19.3▶). The rate of electrons flowing through a wire is analogous to the rate 
of water moving through a stream. Electrical current is measured in units of amperes (A), 
also called amps. One ampere represents the flow of one coulomb (a measure of electrical 
charge) per second:
1 A = 1 C>s
Because an electron has a charge of 1.602 * 10-19 C, 1 A corresponds to the flow of 
6.242 * 1018 electrons per second.
The driving force for electrical current is analogous to the driving force for water cur-
rent. Water current is driven by a difference in gravitational potential energy (caused by 
a gravitational field). Streams flow downhill, from higher to lower potential energy. Elec-
trical current is also driven by a difference in potential energy (caused by an electric field 
resulting from the charge difference on the two electrodes) called potential 
­difference. Potential difference is a measure of the difference in potential energy (usually in 
joules) per unit of charge (coulombs). The SI unit of potential difference is the volt (V), 
which is equal to one joule per coulomb:
1 V = 1 J>C
In other words, a potential difference of one volt indicates that a charge of one coulomb 
experiences an energy difference of one joule between the two electrodes.
A large potential difference corresponds to a large difference in charge between the 
two electrodes, and therefore, a strong tendency for electron flow (analogous to a steeply 
descending streambed). Potential difference, since it gives rise to the force that results in 
the motion of electrons, is also referred to as electromotive force (emf).

Chapter 19  Electrochemistry
In a voltaic cell, the potential difference between the two electrodes is the cell 
potential (Ecell) or cell emf. The cell potential depends on the relative tendencies of 
the reactants to undergo oxidation and reduction. Combining the oxidation of a sub-
stance with a strong tendency to undergo oxidation and the reduction of a substance 
with a strong tendency to undergo reduction produces a large difference in charge 
between the two electrodes, and therefore, a high positive cell potential.
In general, cell potential also depends on the concentrations of the reactants and 
products in the cell and the temperature (which we will assume to be 25 °C unless other-
wise noted). Under standard conditions (1 M concentration for reactants in solution 
and 1 atm pressure for gaseous reactants), the cell potential is called the standard cell 
potential (E°cell) or standard emf. For example, the standard cell potential in the zinc 
and copper cell described previously is 1.10 volts:
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ¡ Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)  E°cell = +1.10 V
If the zinc is replaced with nickel (which has a lower tendency to be oxidized) the 
cell potential is lower:
Ni(s) + Cu2+(aq) ¡ Ni2+(aq) + Cu(s)  E°cell = +0.62 V
The cell potential is a measure of the overall tendency of the redox reaction to occur 
spontaneously—the lower the cell potential, the lower the tendency to occur. A negative 
cell potential indicates that the forward reaction is not spontaneous.
Anode, Cathode, and Salt Bridge
In all electrochemical cells, we call the electrode where oxidation occurs the anode and 
the electrode where reduction occurs the cathode. In a voltaic cell, the anode is the 
more negatively charged electrode, and we label it with a negative (-) sign. The cathode 
of a voltaic cell is the more positively charged electrode, and we label it with a (+) sign. 
Electrons flow from the anode to the cathode (from negative to positive) through the 
wires connecting the electrodes.
As electrons flow out of the anode, positive ions (Zn2+ in the preceding example) 
form in the oxidation half-cell, resulting in a buildup of positive charge in the solution. As 
electrons flow into the cathode, positive ions (Cu2+ in the preceding example) are 
reduced at the reduction half-cell, resulting in a buildup of negative charge in  
the solution.
If the movement of electrons from anode to cathode were the only flow of charge, 
the buildup of the opposite charge in the solution would stop electron flow almost 
immediately. The cell needs a pathway by which counterions can flow between the half-
cells without the solutions in the half-cells totally mixing. One such pathway is a salt 
bridge, an inverted, U-shaped tube that contains a strong electrolyte such as KNO3 and 
connects the two half-cells (see Figure 19.2). The electrolyte is usually suspended in a gel 
and held within the tube by permeable stoppers. The salt bridge allows a flow of ions 
that neutralizes the charge buildup in the solution. The negative ions within the salt bridge 
flow to neutralize the accumulation of positive charge at the anode, and the positive ions flow to 
neutralize the accumulation of negative charge at the cathode. In other words, the salt bridge 
completes the circuit, allowing electrical current to flow.

Note that the anode and cathode 
need not actually be negatively and 
positively charged, respectively. 
The anode is the electrode with the 
relatively more negative (or less

Electrochemical Cell Notation
We represent electrochemical cells with a compact notation called a cell diagram or line 
notation. For example, we represent the electrochemical cell discussed previously in 
which Zn is oxidized to Zn2+ and Cu2+ is reduced to Cu as follows:
Zn(s)Zn2+(aq)Cu2+(aq)Cu(aq)
In this representation,
• the oxidation half-reaction is on the left and the reduction is on the right. A double 
vertical line, indicating the salt bridge, separates the two half-reactions.
• substances in different phases are separated by a single vertical line, which repre-
sents the boundary between the phases.
• for some redox reactions, the reactants and products of one or both of the half-­
reactions may be in the same phase. In these cases (which we explain further next), 
we separate the reactants and products from each other with a comma in the line 
diagram. Such cells use an inert electrode, such as platinum (Pt) or graphite, as the 
anode or cathode (or both).
Consider the redox reaction in which Fe(s) is oxidized and MnO4
-(aq) is reduced:
5 Fe(s) + 2 MnO4
-(aq) + 16 H+(aq) ¡ 5 Fe2+(aq) + 2 Mn2+(aq) + 8 H2O(s)
The half-reactions for this overall reaction are:
Oxidation:  Fe(s) ¡ Fe2+(aq) + 2  e-
Reduction:  MnO4
-(aq) + 5 e- + 8 H+(aq) ¡ Mn2+(aq) + 4 H2O(l)
Notice that in the reduction half-reaction the principal species are all in the aqueous 
phase. In this case, the electron transfer needs an electrode on which to occur. An inert 
platinum electrode is employed, and the electron transfer takes place at its surface. Using 
line notation, we represent the electrochemical cell corresponding to the above reaction as:
Fe(s)Fe2+(aq)MnO4
-(aq), H+(aq), Mn2+(aq)Pt(s)
The Pt(s) on the far right indicates that an inert platinum electrode acts as the cathode 
in this reaction, as depicted in Figure 19.4▼.

	 19.4	 Standard Electrode Potentials
As we have just seen, the standard cell potential (E°cell) for an electrochemical cell depends 
on the specific half-reactions occurring in the half-cells and is a measure of the potential 
energy difference (per unit charge) between the two electrodes. We can think of the 
electrode in each half-cell as having its own individual potential, called the standard 
electrode potential. The overall standard cell potential (E°cell) is the difference between 
the two standard electrode potentials.
We can better understand this idea with an analogy. Consider two water tanks with 
different water levels connected by a common pipe, as shown in Figure 19.5◀. The water 
in each tank has its own level and corresponding potential energy. When the tanks are 
connected, water flows from the tank with the higher level (higher potential energy) to 
the tank with a lower water level (lower potential energy). Similarly, each half-cell in an 
electrochemical cell has its own charge and corresponding electrode potential. When the 
cells are connected, electrons flow from the electrode with more negative charge (greater potential 
energy) to the electrode with more positive charge (less potential energy).
One limitation of this analogy is that, unlike the water level in a tank, we cannot 
measure the electrode potential in a half-cell directly—we can only measure the overall 
potential that occurs when two half-cells are combined in a whole cell. However, we can 
arbitrarily assign a potential of zero to the electrode in a particular type of half-cell and 
then measure all other electrode potentials relative to that zero.
The half-cell electrode that is normally chosen to have a potential of zero is the 
standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). This half-cell consists of an inert platinum 
electrode immersed in 1 M HCl with hydrogen gas at 1 atm bubbling through the solu-
tion, as shown in Figure 19.6▼. When the SHE acts as the cathode, the following half-
reaction occurs:
2 H+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ H2(g)  E°cathode = 0.00 V
If we connect the standard hydrogen electrode to an electrode in another half-cell of 
interest, we can measure the potential difference (or voltage) between the two elec-
trodes. Because we assigned the standard hydrogen electrode zero voltage, we can now 
determine the electrode potential of the other half-cell.
For example, consider the electrochemical cell in Figure 19.7▶. In this electrochem-
ical cell, Zn is oxidized to Zn2+ and H+ is reduced to H2 under standard conditions (all 
solutions are 1 M in concentration, and all gases are 1 atm in pressure) and at 25 °C.

Electrons travel from the anode (where oxidation occurs) to the cathode (where reduc-
tion occurs), so we define E°cell as the difference in voltage between the cathode (final state) 
and the anode (initial state):
 E°cell = E°final - E°initial
 = E°cathode - E°anode
The measured cell potential for this cell is +0.76 V. The anode (in this case, Zn>Zn2+) 
is at a more negative voltage (higher potential energy) than the cathode (in this case, the 
SHE). Therefore, electrons spontaneously flow from the anode to the cathode. We can 
diagram the potential energy and the voltage as follows:
Anode: Zn(s)       Zn2+(aq) + 2 e–

+
– 0.76 V

Cathode: 2 H+(aq) + 2 e–       H2(g)
Referring back to our water tank analogy, the zinc half-cell is like the water tank with the 
higher water level, and electrons therefore flow from the zinc electrode to the standard 
hydrogen electrode.
Because we assigned the SHE a potential of zero (0.00 V), we can determine the elec-
trode potential for the Zn>Zn2+ half-cell (the anode) from the measured cell potential (E°cell):
 E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode
 0.76 V = 0.00 V - E°anode
 E°anode = -0.76 V
The potential for the Zn>Zn2+ electrode is negative. The negative potential indicates that 
an electron at the Zn>Zn2+ electrode has greater potential energy than it does at the SHE. 
Remember that the more negative the electrode potential is, the greater the potential energy of an 
electron at that electrode (because negative charge repels electrons).

Chapter 19  Electrochemistry
What happens if we connect an electrode in which the electron has more positive 
potential (than the standard hydrogen electrode) to the standard hydrogen electrode? 
That electrode would then have a more positive voltage (lower potential energy for an 
electron).
For example, suppose we connect the standard hydrogen electrode to a Cu electrode 
immersed in a 1 M Cu2+ solution. The measured cell potential for this cell is -0.34 V. 
The anode (defined as Cu>Cu2+) is at a more positive voltage (lower potential energy) 
than the cathode (the SHE). Therefore, electrons will not spontaneously flow from the 
anode to the cathode. We can diagram the potential energy and the voltage of this cell 
as follows:
Anode: Cu(s)       Cu2+(aq) + 2 e–

0.00 V
+0.34 V

Cathode: 2 H+(aq) + 2 e–       H2(g)
The copper half-cell is like the water tank with the lower water level, and electrons do not 
spontaneously flow from the copper electrode to the standard hydrogen electrode.
We can again determine the electrode potential for the Cu>Cu2+ half-cell (the 
anode) from the measured cell potential:
 E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode
 -0.34 V = 0.00 V - E°anode
 E°anode = +0.34 V
The potential for the Cu>Cu2+ electrode is positive. The positive potential indicates that 
an electron at the Cu>Cu2+ electrode has lower potential energy than it does at the SHE. 
The more positive the electrode potential, the lower the potential energy of an electron 
at that electrode (because positive charge attracts electrons).
By convention, standard electrode potentials are written for reduction half-reactions. 
We write the standard electrode potentials for the two half-reactions just discussed as:
 Cu2+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ Cu(s)   E° = +0.34 V
 Zn2+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ Zn(s)   E° = -0.76 V
We can see that the Cu>Cu2+ electrode is positive relative to the SHE (and therefore, 
tends to draw electrons away from the SHE) and that the Zn>Zn2+ electrode is negative 
relative to the SHE (and therefore, tends to repel electrons toward the SHE). Table 19.1 
lists the standard electrode potentials for a number of common half-reactions.
Summarizing Standard Electrode Potentials:
▶
▶
The electrode potential of the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is exactly zero.
▶
▶
The electrode in any half-cell with a greater tendency to undergo reduction is posi-
tively charged relative to the SHE, and therefore, has a positive E°.
▶
▶
The electrode in any half-cell with a lesser tendency to undergo reduction (or 
greater tendency to undergo oxidation) is negatively charged relative to the SHE, 
and therefore, has a negative E°.
▶
▶
The cell potential of any electrochemical cell (E°cell) is the difference between the 
electrode potentials of the cathode and the anode (E°cell = E°cat - E°an).
▶
▶
E°cell is positive for spontaneous reactions and negative for nonspontaneous reactions.
Multiplying a half-reaction by some 
constant to balance a redox reaction 
does not affect the value of E° for the 
half-reaction.

Predicting the Spontaneous Direction  
of an Oxidation–Reduction Reaction
To determine the spontaneous direction of an oxidation–reduction reaction, we 
examine the electrode potentials of the two relevant half-reactions in Table 19.1. The 
half-reaction with the more negative electrode potential tends to lose electrons, and 

	
19.4  Standard Electrode Potentials	
903
therefore, undergo oxidation. (Remember that negative charge repels electrons.) The 
half-reaction having the more positive electrode potential tends to gain electrons, and 
therefore, undergo reduction. (Remember that positive charge attracts electrons.)
For example, consider the two reduction half-reactions:
 Ni2+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ Ni(s)    E° = -0.23 V
 Mn2+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ Mn(s)   E° = -1.18 V
Because the manganese half-reaction has a more negative electrode potential, it repels 
electrons and proceeds in the reverse direction (oxidation). Because the nickel half-reac-
tion has the more positive (or less negative) electrode potential, it attracts electrons and 
proceeds in the forward direction.
We can confirm this by calculating the standard electrode potential for manganese 
acting as the anode (oxidation) and nickel acting as the cathode (reduction):
The following mnemonics (NIO and 
PIR) help to predict the spontaneous 
direction of redox reactions:
N.I.O.—More Negative Is Oxidation
P.I.R.—More Positive Is Reduction
Oxidation (Anode):	
 Mn(s) ¡ Mn2+(aq) + 2 e-	
E° = -1.18 V
Ni2+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ Ni(s)	
E° = -0.23 V
Reduction (Cathode):
	
 Ni2+(aq) + Mn(s) ¡ Ni(s) + Mn2+(aq)	
E°cell = E°cat - E°an
 = -0.23 V - (-1.18 V)
 = 0.95 V
The overall cell potential is positive, indicating a spontaneous reaction. Consider the 
electrochemical cell corresponding to this spontaneous redox reaction in Figure 19.8▼. 
We draw the manganese half-cell on the left as the anode and the nickel half-cell on the 
right as the cathode. Electrons flow from the anode to the cathode.
Another way to predict the spontaneity of a redox reaction is to note the relative 
positions of the two half-reactions in Table 19.1. The table lists half-reactions in order of 
decreasing electrode potential, so the half-reactions near the top of the table—those hav-
ing large positive electrode potentials—attract electrons, and therefore, tend to occur in 
the forward direction. Half-reactions near the bottom of the table—those having large 
negative electrode potentials—repel electrons, and therefore, tend to occur in the reverse 
direction. In other words, as we move down Table 19.1, the half-reactions become less 
likely to occur in the forward direction and more likely to occur in the reverse direction. 
As a result, any reduction half-reaction listed is spontaneous when paired with the reverse of a 
half-reaction that appears below it in Table 19.1.
For example, if we return to our two previous half-reactions involving manganese 
and nickel, we can see that the manganese half-reaction is below the nickel half-reaction 
in Table 19.1:
 Ni2+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ Ni(s)    E° = -0.23 V
 Mn2+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ Mn(s)   E° = -1.18 V
Therefore, the nickel reaction occurs in the forward direction (reduction) and the man-
ganese reaction occurs in the reverse direction (oxidation).

Summarizing the Prediction of Spontaneous Direction for Redox Reactions:
▶
▶
The half-reaction with the more positive electrode potential attracts electrons more 
strongly and undergoes reduction. (Substances listed at the top of Table 19.1 tend to 
undergo reduction; they are good oxidizing agents.)
▶
▶
The half-reaction with the more negative electrode potential repels electrons more 
strongly and undergoes oxidation. (Substances listed near the bottom of Table 19.1 
tend to undergo oxidation; they are good reducing agents.)

Any reduction reaction in Table 19.1 is spontaneous when paired with the reverse of 
any of the reactions listed below it on the table.

Predicting Spontaneous Redox Reactions and 
Sketching Electrochemical Cells
Without calculating E°cell, predict whether each of the redox reactions is 
spontaneous. If the reaction is spontaneous as written, make a sketch of the 
electrochemical cell in which the reaction could occur. If the reaction is not 
spontaneous as written, write an equation for the spontaneous direction in which 
the reaction would occur and sketch the electrochemical cell in which the 
spontaneous reaction would occur. In your sketches, make sure to label the anode 
(which should be drawn on the left), the cathode, and the direction of electron flow.
(a)	 Fe(s) + Mg2+(aq) ¡ Fe2+(aq) + Mg(s)
(b)	 Fe(s) + Pb2+(aq) ¡ Fe2+(aq) + Pb(s)
Solution
(a)	 Fe(s) + Mg2+(aq) ¡ Fe2+(aq) + Mg(s)
This reaction involves the reduction of Mg2+:
Mg2+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ Mg(s)
E° = -2.37 V
and the oxidation of Fe:
Fe(s) ¡ Fe2+(aq) + 2 e-
E° = -0.45 V
However, the magnesium half-reaction has the more negative electrode 
potential, and therefore, repels electrons more strongly and undergoes oxida-
tion. The iron half-reaction has the more positive electrode potential, and 
therefore, attracts electrons more strongly and undergoes reduction. So the 
reaction as written is not spontaneous. (The reaction pairs the reduction of 
Mg2+ with the reverse of a half-reaction above it in Table 19.1—such pairings 
are not spontaneous.)
However, the reverse reaction is spontaneous:
Fe2+(aq) + Mg(s) ¡ Fe(s) + Mg2+(aq)
The corresponding electrochemical cell is shown in Figure 19.9◀.
(b)	 Fe(s) + Pb2+(aq) ¡ Fe2+(aq) + Pb(s)
This reaction involves the reduction of Pb2+:
Pb2+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ Pb(s)
E° = -0.13 V
and the oxidation of iron:
Fe(s) ¡ Fe2+(aq) + 2 e-
E° = -0.45 V
The iron half-reaction has the more negative electrode potential, and there-
fore, repels electrons and undergoes oxidation. The lead half-reaction has 
the more positive electrode potential, and therefore, attracts electrons and 
undergoes reduction. Therefore, the reaction is spontaneous as written. (The 
reaction pairs the reduction of Pb2+ with the reverse of a half-reaction below 
it in Table 19.1—such pairings are always spontaneous.) The corresponding 
electrochemical cell is shown in Figure 19.10◀.

Predicting Whether a Metal Will Dissolve in Acid
In Chapter 16, we learned that acids dissolve metals. Most acids dissolve metals by the 
reduction of H+ ions to hydrogen gas and the corresponding oxidation of the metal to 
its ion. For example, if solid Zn is dropped into hydrochloric acid, the following reaction 
occurs:
 2 H+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ H2(g)
 Zn(s) ¡ Zn2+(aq) + 2 e-
 Zn(s) + 2 H+(aq) ¡ Zn2+(aq) + H2(g)
We observe the reaction as the dissolving of the zinc and the bubbling of hydrogen 
gas. The zinc is oxidized and the H+ ions are reduced. Notice that this reaction involves 
the pairing of a reduction half-reaction (the reduction of H+) with the reverse of a half-
reaction that falls below it in Table 19.1. Therefore, this reaction is spontaneous. What 
happens, however, if we pair the reduction of H+ with the oxidation of Cu? The reaction 
is not spontaneous because it involves pairing the reduction of H+ with the reverse of a 
half-reaction that is listed above it in the table. Consequently, copper does not react with 
H+ and does not dissolve in acids such as HCl. In general, metals whose reduction half-
reactions are listed below the reduction of H+ to H2 in Table 19.1 dissolve in acids, while metals 
listed above it do not.
An important exception to this rule is nitric acid (HNO3), which can oxidize metals 
through the reduction half-reaction:
NO3
-(aq) + 4 H+(aq) + 3 e- ¡  NO(g) + 2 H2O(l) E° = 0.96 V
Since this half-reaction is above the reduction of H+ in Table 19.1, HNO3 can oxidize 
metals (such as copper) that can’t be oxidized by HCl.

We have seen that a positive standard cell potential (E°cell) corresponds to a spontaneous 
oxidation–reduction reaction. And we know (from Chapter 18) that the spontaneity of 
a reaction is determined by the sign of ∆G°. Therefore, E°cell and ∆G° must be related. 
We also know from Section 18.10 that ∆G° for a reaction is related to the equilibrium 
constant (K) for the reaction. Since E°cell and ∆G° are related, then E°cell and K must also 
be related.

Chapter 19  Electrochemistry
Before we look at the nature of each of these relationships in detail, let’s consider 
the following generalizations.
For a spontaneous redox reaction (one that proceeds in the forward direction when 
all reactants and products are in their standard states):
• ∆G° is negative (60)
• E°cell is positive (70)
• K 7 1
For a nonspontaneous reaction (one that proceeds in the reverse direction when all 
reactants and products are in their standard states):
• ∆G° is positive (70)
• E°cell is negative (60)
• K 6 1
The Relationship between 𝚫G° and E°cell
We can derive a relationship between ∆G° and E°cell by briefly returning to the definition 
of potential difference from Section 19.3—a potential difference is a measure of the 
difference of potential energy per unit charge (q):
E =
charge (in C)
potential energy difference (in J)
Maximum work (wmax)
Charge (q)
Since the potential energy difference represents the maximum amount of work that can 
be done by the system on the surroundings, we can write:
	
wmax = -qE°cell
[19.1]
The negative sign follows the convention used throughout this book that work done by 
the system on the surroundings is negative.
We can quantify the charge (q) that flows in an electrochemical reaction by using 
Faraday’s constant (F), which represents the charge in coulombs of 1 mol of 
electrons:
F = 96,485 C
mol e-  
The total charge is q = nF, where n is the number of moles of electrons from the ­ 
balanced chemical equation and F is Faraday’s constant. Substituting q = nF into 
Equation 19.1:
wmax = -qE°cell
	
= -nFE°cell
[19.2]
Finally, recall from Chapter 18 that the standard change in free energy for a chemi-
cal reaction (∆G°) represents the maximum amount of work that can be done by the 
reaction. Therefore, wmax = ∆G°. Making this substitution into Equation 19.2, we arrive 
at the following important result:
	
∆G° = -nFE°cell 
[19.3]
where ∆G° is the standard change in free energy for an electrochemical reaction, n is the 
number of moles of electrons transferred in the balanced equation, F is Faraday’s con-
stant, and E°cell is the standard cell potential. Example 19.6 shows how to apply this equa-
tion to calculate the standard free energy change for an electrochemical cell.

Periodic Trends and the Direction of Spontaneity for Redox 
Reactions  Consider the result of Example 19.6. The calculation revealed that the 
reaction is not spontaneous. Based on conceptual reasoning, which of the following 
best explains why I2 does not oxidize Br-?
(a)	 Br is more electronegative than I; therefore, you do not expect Br- to give up an 
electron to I2.
(b)	 I is more electronegative than Br; therefore, you do not expect I2 to give up an 
electron to Br-.
(c)	 Br- is in solution and I2 is a solid. Solids do not gain electrons from substances 
in solution.

The Relationship between E°cell and K
We can derive a relationship between the standard cell potential (E°cell) and the equilibrium 
constant for the redox reaction occurring in the cell (K) by returning to the relationship 
between ∆G° and K that we learned in Chapter 18. Recall from Section 18.10 that: 
	
∆G° = -RT ln K

By setting Equations 19.3 and 19.4 equal to each other, we get:
-nFE°cell = -RT ln K

where E°cell is the standard cell potential, n is the number of moles of electrons trans-

	 19.6	 Cell Potential and Concentration
We have learned how to find E°cell under standard conditions. For example, we know that 
when [Cu2+] = 1 M and [Zn2+] = 1 M, the following reaction produces a potential of 
1.10 V:
Zn(s) + Cu2 +(aq, 1 M) ¡ Zn2 +(aq, 1 M) + Cu(s)  E°cell = 1.10 V
However, what if [Cu2+] 7 1 M and [Zn2+] 6 1 M? For example, how would the cell 
potential for the following conditions be different from the potential under standard 
conditions?
Zn(s) + Cu2 +(aq, 2 M) ¡ Zn2 +(aq, 0.010 M) + Cu(s)  Ecell = ?
Since the concentration of a reactant is greater than standard conditions, and since the 
concentration of product is less than standard conditions, we can use Le Châtelier’s 
principle to predict that the reaction has an even stronger tendency to occur in the for-
ward direction and that Ecell is therefore greater than +1.10 V (Figure 19.11▶, on the 
next page).
Cell Potential under Nonstandard Conditions:  
The Nernst Equation
We can derive an exact relationship between Ecell (under nonstandard conditions) and 
E°cell by considering the relationship between the change in free energy (∆G) and the 
standard change in free energy (∆G°) from Section 18.9:

electrochemical cell under standard and nonstandard conditions. In this case, the nonstandard 
conditions consist of a higher cu2+ concentration ([cu2+] 7 1 M) at the cathode and a lower 
Zn2+ concentration at the anode ([Zn2+] 6 1 M). According to Le Châtelier’s principle, the 
forward reaction has a greater tendency to occur, resulting in a greater overall cell potential 
than the cell potential under standard conditions.
where R is the gas constant (8.314 J>mol # K), T is the temperature in kelvins, and Q is the 
reaction quotient corresponding to the nonstandard conditions. Since we know the 
relationship between ∆G and Ecell (Equation 19.3), we can substitute into Equation 19.7:
 ∆G = ∆G° + RT ln Q
 -nFEcell = -nFE°cell + RT ln Q
We then divide each side by -nF to arrive at:

CHECK  The answer has the correct units (V). The value of Ecell is larger than E°cell, as expected based on Le Châtelier’s 
principle because one of the aqueous reactants has a concentration greater than standard conditions and the one ­aqueous 
product has a concentration less than standard conditions. Therefore, the reaction has a greater tendency to proceed 
toward products and a greater cell potential.

Concentration Cells
Since cell potential depends not only on the half-reactions occurring in the cell, but 
also on the concentrations of the reactants and products in those half-reactions, we 
can construct a voltaic cell in which both half-reactions are the same, but in which a 
difference in concentration drives the current flow. For example, consider the electrochemical 
cell shown in Figure 19.12▶, in which copper is oxidized at the anode and copper ions 
are reduced at the cathode. The second part of Figure 19.12 depicts this cell under 
nonstandard conditions, with [Cu2+] = 2.0 M in one half-cell and [Cu2+] = 0.010 M in 
the other:
Cu(s) + Cu2+(aq, 2.0 M) ¡ Cu2+(aq, 0.010 M) + Cu(s)
(see Equation 19.6)

	
19.6  Cell Potential and Concentration	
913
The half-reactions are identical, and the standard cell potential is therefore zero:
Reduction (Cathode):	
Cu2+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ Cu(s)	
E° = 0.34 V
Oxidation (Anode):	
Cu(s) ¡ Cu2+(aq) + 2 e-	
E° = 0.34 V
Cu2+(aq) + Cu(s) ¡ Cu(s) + Cu2+(aq) E°cell = E°cat - E°an
= +0.00 V
Because of the different concentrations in the two half-cells, the cell potential must 
be calculated using the Nernst equation:
 Ecell = E°cell - 0.0592 V
2
 log 0.010
2.0
 = 0.000 V + 0.068 V
 = 0.068 V
The cell produces a potential of 0.068 V. Electrons spontaneously flow from the half-cell with 
the lower copper ion concentration to the half-cell with the higher copper ion concentration. We 
can imagine a concentration cell in the same way we think about any concentration gra-
dient. If we mix a concentrated solution of Cu2+ with a dilute solution, the Cu2+ ions 
flow from the concentrated solution to the dilute one. Similarly, in a concentration cell, 
the transfer of electrons from the dilute half-cell results in the formation of Cu2+ ions in 
the dilute half-cell. The electrons flow to the concentrated cell, where they react with 
Cu2+ ions and reduce them to Cu(s). Therefore, the flow of electrons has the effect of increas-
ing the concentration of Cu2+ in the dilute cell and decreasing the concentration of Cu2+ in the 
concentrated half-cell.

concentration, the cell potential is zero. If one half-cell has a greater cu2+ concentration than 
the other, a spontaneous reaction occurs. In the reaction, cu2+ ions in the more concentrated 
cell are reduced (to solid copper), while cu2+ ions in the more dilute cell are formed (from solid 
copper). The concentration of copper ions in the two half-cells tends toward equality.

ecall from Section 8.1 that tiny pumps in the mem-
branes of human nerve cells pump ions—especially so-
dium (Na+) and potassium (K+)—through those membranes, 
establishing a concentration gradient for each type of ion. 
The concentration of sodium ions is higher outside the cell 
than within, while exactly the opposite is true for potassium 
ions. These concentration gradients result in an electrical po-
tential across the cell membrane, called the resting potential, 
of about -70 mV. (The interior of the cell is negative with re-
spect to the exterior.)
When the nerve cell is stimulated, certain channels in the 
membrane open, allowing Na+ ions to rush into the cell and 
causing the potential to temporarily rise to about +30 mV 
(Figure 19.13▼). Other channels that allow K+ ions to rush

to near its resting potential. The result is a spike in the elec-
trochemical potential across the membrane, which provides 
the stimulus for a similar spike in the neighboring segment of 
the membrane (Figure 19.14▲). In this way, an electrical sig-
nal moves down the length of a nerve cell.
When the electrical signal reaches the end of the nerve 
cell, it triggers the release of a chemical neurotransmitter, 
which travels to the neighboring nerve cell and stimulates the 
same kind of electrochemical spike. In this way, neural sig-
nals travel throughout the brain and nervous system.
	 19.7	 Batteries: Using Chemistry to  
Generate Electricity
We have seen that we can combine the electron-losing tendency of one substance with 
the electron-gaining tendency of another to create electrical current in a voltaic cell. 
Batteries are voltaic cells conveniently packaged to act as portable sources of electricity. 
The actual oxidation and reduction reactions vary depending on the particular type of 
battery. In this section, we examine several different types.
Dry-Cell Batteries
Common batteries, such as the kind in a flashlight, are called dry-cell batteries 
because they do not contain large amounts of liquid water. There are several familiar 
types of dry-cell batteries. The most inexpensive are composed of a zinc case that acts as 
the anode (Figure 19.15(a)▶). The zinc is oxidized according to the reaction:
Oxidation (Anode): Zn(s) ¡ Zn2+(aq) + 2 e-

(a) In a common dry-cell battery, the 
zinc case acts as the anode and a 
graphite rod immersed in a moist, 
slightly acidic paste of MnO2 and 
Nh4cl acts as the cathode.  
(b) Longer-lived alkaline batteries 
employ a graphite cathode immersed 
in a paste of MnO2 and a base.
The cathode is a carbon rod immersed in a moist paste of MnO2 that also contains 
NH4Cl. The MnO2 is reduced to Mn2O3 according to the reaction:
Reduction (Cathode): 2 MnO2(s) + 2 NH4
+(aq) + 2 e- ¡
Mn2O3(s) + 2 NH3(g) + H2O(l)
These two half-reactions produce a voltage of about 1.5 V. Two or more of these batteries 
can be connected in series (cathode-to-anode connection) to produce higher voltages.
The more common alkaline batteries (Figure 19.15(b)▶) employ slightly differ-
ent half-reactions in a basic medium (therefore the name alkaline). In an alkaline bat-
tery, the zinc is oxidized in a basic environment:
Oxidation (Anode):	
Zn(s) + 2 OH-(aq) ¡ Zn(OH)2(s) + 2 e-
Reduction (Cathode):  2 MnO2(s) + 2 H2O(l) + 2 e- ¡

Overall reaction:	
Zn(s) + 2 MnO2(s) + 2 H2O(l) ¡
Zn(OH)2(s) + 2 MnO(OH)(s)
Alkaline batteries have a longer working life and a longer shelf life than their nonalka-
line counterparts.
Lead–Acid Storage Batteries
The batteries in most automobiles are lead–acid storage batteries. These batteries 
consist of six electrochemical cells wired in series (Figure 19.16▼). Each cell produces 2 V 
for a total of 12 V. Each cell contains a porous lead anode where oxidation occurs and a 
lead(IV) oxide cathode where reduction occurs according to the reactions:
Oxidation (Anode):	
Pb(s) + HSO4
-(aq) ¡ PbSO4(s) + H+(aq) + 2 e-
Reduction (Cathode):	 PbO2(s) + HSO4
-(aq) + 2 3 H+(aq) + 2 e- ¡

Overall reaction:	
Pb(s) + PbO2(s) + 2 HSO4
-(aq) + 2 H+(aq) ¡
2 PbSO4(s) + 2 H2O(l)
Both the anode and the cathode are immersed in sulfuric acid (H2SO4). As electrical cur-
rent is drawn from the battery, both electrodes become coated with PbSO4(s). If the bat-
tery is run for a long time without recharging, too much PbSO4(s) develops on the 
surface of the electrodes and the battery goes dead. The lead–acid storage battery can be 
recharged by an electrical current (which must come from an external source such as an 
alternator in a car). The current causes the preceding reaction to occur in reverse, con-
verting the PbSO4(s) back to Pb(s) and PbSO4(s).

Other Rechargeable Batteries
The ubiquity of power electronic products such as laptops and smartphones, as well as the 
growth in popularity of hybrid electric vehicles, drives the need for efficient, long-lasting, 
rechargeable batteries. The most common types include the nickel–cadmium (NiCad) 
battery, the nickel–metal hydride (NiMH) battery, and the lithium ion battery.
The Nickel–Cadmium (NiCad) Battery
Nickel–cadmium batteries consist of a solid cadmium anode and a NiO(OH)(s) cathode. 
The electrolyte is usually KOH(aq). During operation, the cadmium is oxidized and the 
NiO(OH) is reduced according to the equations:
Oxidation (Anode):	 Cd(s) + 2 OH-(aq) ¡ Cd(OH)2(s) + 2 e-
Reduction (Cathode):	 2 NiO(OH)(s) + 2 H2O(l) + 2 e- ¡
2 Ni(OH)2(s) + 2 OH-(aq)
The overall reaction produces about 1.30 V. As current is drawn from the NiCad bat-
tery, solid cadmium hydroxide accumulates on the anode and solid nickel(II) hydroxide 
accumulates on the cathode. But if current is run in the opposite direction, the reactants 
can be regenerated from the products. A common problem in recharging NiCad and 
other rechargeable batteries is knowing when to stop. Once all of the products of the 
reaction are converted back to reactants, the charging process should ideally terminate. 
If charging does not stop, the electrical current drives other, usually unwanted, reac-
tions such as the electrolysis of water to form hydrogen and oxygen gas. These reactions 
typically damage the battery and may sometimes even cause an explosion. Conse-
quently, most commercial battery chargers have sensors that measure when the charg-
ing is complete. These sensors rely on the small changes in voltage or increases in 
temperature that occur once the products have all been converted back to reactants.
The Nickel–Metal Hydride (NiMH) Battery
Although NiCad batteries were the standard rechargeable battery for many years, they 
are being replaced by other types of rechargeable batteries, in part because of the toxicity 
of cadmium and the resulting disposal problems. One of these replacements is the 
nickel–metal hydride or NiMH battery. The NiMH battery employs the same cathode 
reaction as the NiCad battery, but it employs a different anode reaction. In the anode of 
a NiMH battery, hydrogen atoms held in a metal alloy are oxidized. If we let M represent 
the metal alloy, we can write the half-reactions as follows:
Oxidation (Anode): M # H(s) + OH-(aq) ¡ M(s) + H2O(l) + e-
Reduction (Cathode): NiO(OH)(s) + H2O(l) + e- ¡ Ni(OH)2(s) + OH-(aq)
In addition to being more environmentally friendly than NiCad batteries, NiMH 
batteries also have a greater energy density (energy content per unit battery mass), as we 
can see in Table 19.2. In some cases, a NiMH battery can carry twice the energy of a 
NiCad battery of the same mass, making NiMH batteries the most common choice for 
hybrid electric vehicles.
The Lithium Ion Battery
The newest and most expensive common type of rechargeable battery is the lithium ion 
battery. Since lithium is the least dense metal (0.53 g>cm3), lithium batteries have high-
energy densities (see Table 19.2). The lithium battery works differently than the other 
batteries we have examined so far, and the details of its operation are beyond the scope of 
▲ Several types of batteries, 
including NiCad, NiMH, and lithium 
ion batteries, are recharged by 
chargers that use household current.

our current discussion. Briefly, we can describe operation of the lithium 
battery as being due primarily to the motion of lithium ions from the 
anode to the cathode. The anode is composed of graphite into which 
lithium ions are incorporated between layers of carbon atoms. Upon 
discharge, the lithium ions spontaneously migrate to the cathode, 
which consists of a lithium transition metal oxide such as LiCoO2 or 
LiMn2O4. The transition metal is reduced during this process. Upon 
recharging, the transition metal is oxidized, forcing the lithium to 
migrate back into the graphite (Figure 19.17▶). The flow of lithium ions 
from the anode to the cathode causes a corresponding flow of electrons 
in the external circuit. Lithium ion batteries are commonly used in 
applications where light weight and high-energy density are important. 
These include smartphones, laptop computers, and digital cameras.
Fuel Cells
We discussed the potential for fuel cells in the opening section of 
this chapter. Fuel cells may one day replace—or at least work in 
combination with—centralized power grid electricity. In addition, 
vehicles powered by fuel cells may one day usurp vehicles powered 
by internal combustion engines. Fuel cells are like batteries; the key 
difference is that a battery is self-contained, while in a fuel cell the 
reactants need to be constantly replenished from an external source. 
With use, normal batteries lose their ability to generate voltage 
because the reactants become depleted as electrical current is drawn 
from the battery. In a fuel cell, the reactants—the fuel provided from 
an external source—constantly flow through the battery, generating 
electrical current as they undergo a redox reaction.
The most common fuel cell is the hydrogen–oxygen fuel cell  
(Figure 19.18▼). In this cell, hydrogen gas flows past the anode (a 
screen coated with platinum catalyst) and undergoes oxidation:

Chemistry IN YOUR DAY | The Fuel-Cell Breathalyzer
P
olice use a device called a breathalyzer to measure the 
amount of ethyl alcohol (ch3ch2Oh) in the bloodstream 
of a person suspected of driving under the influence of 
alcohol (Figure 19.19▼). Breathalyzers work because the 
quantity of ethyl alcohol in the breath is proportional to the 
quantity of ethyl alcohol in the bloodstream. One type of 
breathalyzer employs a fuel cell to measure the quantity of 
alcohol in the breath. When a suspect blows into the breath-
alyzer, ethyl alcohol is oxidized to acetic acid at the anode:
Oxidation (Anode): ch3ch2Oh(g) + 4 Oh-(aq) ¡
ethyl alcohol
hc2h3O2(g) + 3 h2O(l) + 4 e-
acetic acid
At the cathode, oxygen is reduced:
Reduction (Cathode): O2(g) + 2 h2O(l) + 4 e- ¡
4 Oh-(aq)
The overall reaction is the oxidation of ethyl alcohol to acetic 
acid and water:
Overall: ch3ch2Oh(g) + O2(g) ¡
hc2h3O2(g) + h2O(l)
The magnitude of electrical current produced depends on 
the quantity of alcohol in the breath. A higher current results 
from a higher blood alcohol level. When calibrated correctly, 
the fuel-cell breathalyzer can precisely measure the blood 
alcohol level of a suspected drunk driver.

The half-reactions sum to the following overall reaction:
Overall reaction: 2 H2(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 H2O(l)
Notice that the only product is water. In the space shuttle program, hydrogen–oxygen 
fuel cells consume hydrogen to provide electricity and astronauts drink the water that is 
produced by the reaction. In order for hydrogen-powered fuel cells to become more 
widely used, a more readily available source of hydrogen must be developed.
	 19.8	 Electrolysis: Driving Nonspontaneous 
Chemical Reactions with Electricity
In a voltaic cell, a spontaneous redox reaction produces electrical current. In an 
electrolytic cell, electrical current drives an otherwise nonspontaneous redox reaction 
through a process called electrolysis. We have seen that the reaction of hydrogen with

oxygen to form water is spontaneous and can be used to produce an electrical current in 
a fuel cell. Conversely, by supplying electrical current, we can cause the reverse reaction 
to occur, separating water into hydrogen and oxygen (Figure 19.20▲):
 2 H2(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 H2O(l)
(spontaneous—produces electrical current; 
	
occurs in a voltaic cell)
2 H2O(l) ¡ 2 H2(g) + O2(g)	
(nonspontaneous—consumes electrical  
	
current; occurs in an electrolytic cell)
Recall from Section 19.7 that one of the problems associated with the widespread 
adoption of hydrogen fuel cells is the scarcity of hydrogen. Where will the hydrogen to 
power these fuel cells come from? One possible solution is to obtain hydro-
gen from water through solar-powered electrolysis. A solar-powered electro-
lytic cell can produce hydrogen from water when the sun is shining. The 
hydrogen made in this way could be converted back to water to generate elec-
tricity and could also be used to power fuel-cell vehicles.
Electrolysis also has numerous other applications. For example, most 
metals are found in Earth’s crust as metal oxides. Converting an oxide to a 
pure metal requires that the metal be reduced, a nonspontaneous process. 
Electrolysis can be used to produce these metals. Thus, sodium is produced 
by the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride (discussed in the following 
subsection).
Electrolysis is also used to plate metals onto other metals. For exam-
ple, silver can be plated onto a less expensive metal using the electrolytic 
cell shown in Figure 19.21▶. In this cell, a silver electrode is placed in a 
solution containing silver ions. An electrical current causes the oxida-
tion of silver at the anode (replenishing the silver ions in solution) and 
the reduction of silver ions at the cathode (coating the less expensive 
metal with solid silver):

▲ Figure 19.22  Voltaic versus 
Electrolytic Cells  In a Zn>cu2+ 
voltaic cell, the reaction proceeds 
in the spontaneous direction. In a 
Zn2+>cu electrolytic cell, electrical 
current drives the reaction in the 
nonspontaneous direction.
Since the standard cell potential of the reaction is zero, the reaction is not spontaneous 
under standard conditions. An external power source can be used to drive current flow 
and cause the reaction to occur.
The voltage required to cause electrolysis depends on the specific half-reactions. For 
example, we have seen that the oxidation of zinc and the reduction of Cu2+ produce a 
voltage of 1.10 V under standard conditions:
Reduction (Cathode):	
Cu2+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ Cu(s)	
E° = 0.34 V
Oxidation (Anode):	
Zn(s) ¡ Zn2+(aq) + 2 e-	
E° = -0.76 V
Cu2+(aq) + Zn(s) ¡ Cu(s) + Zn2+(aq)
E°cell = E°cat - E°an
= +1.10 V
If a power source producing more than 1.10 V is inserted into the Zn>Cu2+ voltaic cell, 
electrons can be forced to flow in the opposite direction, causing the reduction of Zn2+ 
and the oxidation of Cu, as shown in Figure 19.22▲. Notice that in the electrolytic cell, 
the anode has become the cathode (oxidation always occurs at the anode) and the cath-
ode has become the anode.
In a voltaic cell, the anode is the source of electrons and is therefore labeled with 
a negative charge. The cathode draws electrons and is therefore labeled with a posi-
tive charge. In an electrolytic cell, however, the source of the electrons is the external 
power source. The external power source must draw electrons away from the anode; 
thus, the anode must be connected to the positive terminal of the battery (as shown 
in Figure 19.22). Similarly, the power source drives electrons toward the cathode 
(where they are used in reduction), so the cathode must be connected to the negative 
terminal of the battery. The charge labels (+ and -) on an electrolytic cell are oppo-
site of what they are in a voltaic cell.

Electrons are forced to the cathode, which must be connected to the negative termi-
nal of the power source (cathode -).
Predicting the Products of Electrolysis
Predicting the products of an electrolysis reaction is in some cases relatively 
straightforward and in other cases more complex. We cover the simpler cases 
first and follow with the more complex ones.
Pure Molten Salts
Consider the electrolysis of a molten salt such as sodium chloride, shown in 
Figure 19.23▶. Na+ and Cl- are the only species present in the cell. The chloride 
ion cannot be further reduced (-1 is its lowest oxidation state), so it must be 
oxidized. The sodium ion cannot be further oxidized (+1 is its highest oxidation 
state), so it must be reduced. Thus, we can write the half-reactions:
Oxidation (Anode):	
2 Cl-(l) ¡ Cl2(g) + 2 e-
Reduction (Cathode):	
2 Na+(l) + 2 e- ¡ 2 Na(s)
	
2 Na+(l) + 2 Cl-(l) ¡ 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g)
Although the reaction as written is not spontaneous, it can be driven to occur 
in an electrolytic cell by an external power source.
We can generalize as follows:
• In the electrolysis of a pure molten salt, the anion is oxidized and the 
­cation is reduced.
Mixtures of Cations or Anions
What if a molten salt contains more than one anion or cation? For example, suppose our 
electrolysis cell contains both NaCl and KCl. Which of the two cations is reduced at the 
cathode? In order to answer this question, we must determine which of the two cations 
is more easily reduced.
Although the values of electrode potentials for aqueous solutions given in Table 19.1 
do not apply to molten salts, the relative ordering of the electrode potentials does reflect 
the relative ease with which the metal cations are reduced. We can see from the table that 
the reduction of Na+ is listed above the reduction of K+; that is, Na+ has a more positive 
electrode potential:
 Na+(aq) + e- ¡ Na(s)
   E° = -2.71 V 
 (for aqueous solution)
 K+(aq) + e- ¡ K(s)     E° = -2.92 V   (for aqueous solution)
Therefore, Na+ is easier to reduce than K+. Consequently, in a mixture of NaCl and KCl, 
Na+ has a greater tendency to be reduced at the cathode.
Similarly, what if a mixture of molten salts contained more than one anion? For 
example, in a mixture of NaBr and NaCl, which of the two anions is oxidized at the cath-
ode? The answer is similar: the anion that is more easily oxidized (the one with the more 
negative electrode potential):
 2 Cl-(aq) ¡ Cl2(g) + 2 e-   E° = 1.36 V   (for aqueous solution)
 2 Br-(aq) ¡ Br2(l) + 2 e-    E° = 1.09 V   (for aqueous solution)
Since the electrode potential for the bromine half-reaction is more negative, electrons 
are more easily extracted from it. The bromide ion is therefore oxidized at the anode.
We can generalize as follows:
• The cation that is most easily reduced (the one with the more positive electrode 
­potential) is reduced first.
• The anion that is most easily oxidized (the one with the more negative electrode 
potential) is oxidized first.

Aqueous Solutions
Electrolysis in an aqueous solution is complicated by the possibility of the electrolysis 
of water itself. Recall that water can be either oxidized or reduced according to the 
following half-reactions:
Oxidation (Anode):	 2 H2O(l) ¡ O2(g) + 4 H+(aq) + 4 e-	
E° = 1.23 V (standard conditions)
E = 0.82 V([H+] = 10-7 M)
Reduction (Cathode):	
2 H2O(l) + 2 e- ¡ H2(g) + 2 OH-(aq)
E° = -0.83 V (standard conditions)
E = -0.41 V([OH-] = 10-7 M)
The electrode potentials under standard conditions are shown to the right of each half-
reaction. However, in pure water at room temperature, the concentrations of H+ and 
OH- are not standard. The electrode potentials for [H+] = 10-7 M and [OH-] = 10-7 M 
are shown in blue. Using those electrode potentials, we can calculate Ecell  for the elec-
trolysis of water as follows:
Ecell = Ecat - Ean = -0.41V - 0.82 V = -1.23 V
When a battery with a potential of several volts is connected to an electrolysis cell con-
taining pure water, no reaction occurs because the concentration of ions in pure water is 
too low to conduct any significant electrical current. When an electrolyte such as 
Na2SO4 is added to the water, however, electrolysis occurs readily.
In any aqueous solution in which electrolysis is to take place, the electrolysis of 
water is also possible. For example, consider the electrolysis of a sodium iodide solution, 
as shown in Figure 19.24▼. For the electrolysis of molten NaI, we can readily predict that 
I- is oxidized at the anode and that Na+ is reduced at the cathode. In an aqueous solu-
tion, however, two different oxidation half-reactions are possible at the anode, the oxi-
dation of I- and the oxidation of water:
Oxidation:  2 I-(aq) ¡ I2(aq) + 2 e-	
E° = 0.54 V
Oxidation:  2 H2O(l) ¡ O2(g) + 4 H+(aq) + 4 e- 	
E = 0.82 V ([H+] = 10-7 M)
Similarly, two different reduction half-reactions are possible at the cathode, the 
reduction of Na+ and the reduction of water:
Reduction:  2 Na+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ 2 Na(s) 	
E° = -2.71 V
Reduction:  2 H2O(l) + 2 e- ¡ H2(g) + 2 OH-(aq)
E = -0.41 V ([OH-] = 10-7 M)
How do we know which reactions actually occur? In both cases, the 
answer is the same: the half-reaction that occurs more easily. For oxidation, 
the half-reaction with the more negative electrode potential is the eas-
ier one from which to extract electrons. In this case, therefore, the 
iodide ion is oxidized at the anode. For reduction, the half-reaction with 
the more positive electrode potential is the one that accepts electrons 
more easily. In this case, therefore, water is reduced at the cathode. 
Notice that Na+ cannot be reduced in an aqueous solution—water is 
reduced before Na+.
We can make the following generalization:
Oxygen
Hydrogen
▲ Pure water is a poor conductor of 
electrical current, but the addition of 
an electrolyte allows electrolysis to 
take place, producing hydrogen and 
oxygen gas in a stoichiometric ratio.
• The cations of active metals—those that are not easily reduced, 
such as Li+, K+, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Al3+—cannot be reduced 
from aqueous solutions by electrolysis because water is reduced at 
a lower voltage.
The Electrolysis of Aqueous Sodium Chloride  
and Overvoltage
An additional complication that we must consider when predicting the 
products of electrolysis is overvoltage—an additional voltage that must be 
applied in order to make some nonspontaneous reactions occur.

19.8  Electrolysis: Driving Nonspontaneous Chemical Reactions with Electricity	
923
We can demonstrate this concept by considering the electrolysis of a 
sodium chloride solution, shown in Figure 19.25▶. In order to predict the 
product of the electrolysis, we consider the two possible oxidation 
half-reactions:
Oxidation:	 2 Cl-(aq) ¡ Cl2(g) + 2 e-	
E° = 1.36 V
Oxidation:	 2 H2O(l) ¡ O2(g) + 4 H+(aq) + 4 e-
	
	 	
	
	
E = 0.82 V([H+] = 10-7 M)
and the two possible reduction half-reactions:
Reduction:	 2 Na+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ 2 Na(s)	
E° = -2.71 V
Reduction:	 2 H2O(l) + 2 e- ¡ H2(g) + 2 OH-(aq)
E = -0.41 V([OH-] = 10-7 M)
Since the oxidation of water has a more negative electrode potential 
than the oxidation of Cl-, we would initially predict that it would be easier 
to remove electrons from water, and thus water should be oxidized at the 
anode. Similarly, since the reduction of water has a more positive electrode 
potential than the reduction of Na+, we would expect that it would be eas-
ier to get water to accept electrons, so water should be reduced at the cath-
ode. In other words, we initially predict that a sodium chloride solution would simply 
result in the electrolysis of water, producing oxygen gas at the anode and hydrogen gas at 
the cathode. If we construct such a cell, however, we find that, although hydrogen gas is 
indeed formed at the cathode (as predicted), oxygen gas is not formed at the anode—chlo-
rine gas is formed instead. Why? The answer is that even though the electrode potential 
for the oxidation of water is 0.82 V, the reaction actually requires a voltage greater than 
0.82 V in order to occur. (The reasons for this behavior are related to kinetic factors that 
are beyond the scope of our current discussion.) This additional voltage, the overvoltage, 
increases the voltage required for the oxidation of water to about 1.4 V. The result is that 
the chloride ion oxidizes more easily than water and Cl2(g) is observed at the anode.

possible oxidation and reduction half-

­equation for its oxidation, which 
­occurs at the anode.
At the cathode, both the reduction of 
Al3+ and the reduction of Mg2+ are pos-
sible. The one that actually occurs is the 
one that occurs more easily. Since the 
reduction of Al3+ has a more positive 
electrode potential in aqueous ­solution, 
this ion is more easily reduced. There-

(b)	 Since LiI is in an aqueous solution, two 
different oxidation half-reactions are

the electrode potential of water under 
conditions in which [H+] = 10-7 M. 
Since the oxidation of I- has the more 
negative electrode potential, it is the 
half-reaction to occur at the anode.
Similarly, write half-reactions for the 
two possible reduction half-reactions 
that might occur at the cathode, the 
reduction of Li+ and the reduction of 
water. Since the reduction of water has 
the more positive electrode potential 
(even when considering overvoltage,

age by about 0.4–0.6 V), it is the half-
reaction to occur at the cathode.

Stoichiometry of Electrolysis
In an electrolytic cell, electrical current is used to drive a particular chemical 
reaction. In a sense, the electrons act as a reactant, and therefore, have a 
stoichiometric relationship with the other reactants and products. Unlike 
ordinary reactants, for which we usually measure quantity as mass, for 
electrons we measure quantity as charge.
For example, consider an electrolytic cell used to coat copper onto metals, 
as shown in Figure 19.26◀. The half-reaction by which copper is deposited 
onto the metal is:
Cu2+(aq) + 2 e- ¡ Cu(s)
For every 2 mol of electrons that flow through the cell, 1 mol of solid copper is 
plated. We can write the stoichiometric relationship:
2 mol e- : 1 mol Cu(s)
We can determine the number of moles of electrons that have flowed in a 
given electrolysis cell by measuring the total charge that has flowed through the 
cell, which in turn depends on the magnitude of the current and on the time that 
the current runs. Recall from Section 19.3 that the unit of current is the ampere:
1 A = 1 C
s
If we multiply the amount of current (in A) flowing through the cell by the time (in s) 
that the current flowed, we find the total charge that passed through the cell in that time:
Current a C
s b * time (s) = charge  (C)
The relationship between charge and the number of moles of electrons is given by 
­Faraday’s constant, which, as we saw previously, corresponds to the charge in coulombs 
of 1 mol of electrons:
F = 96,485 C
mol e-
These relationships can be used to solve problems involving the stoichiometry of 
electrolytic cells, as demonstrated in Example 19.10.

	 19.9	 Corrosion: Undesirable Redox Reactions
Corrosion is the (usually) gradual, nearly always undesired, oxidation of metals that 
are exposed to oxidizing agents in the environment. From Table 19.1, we can see that the 
reduction of oxygen in the presence of water has an electrode potential of +0.40 V:
O2(g) + 2 H2O(l) + 4 e- ¡ 4 OH-(aq)  E° = +0.40 V
In the presence of acid, the reduction of oxygen has an even more positive electrode 
potential of +1.23 V:
O2(g) + 4 H+(aq) + 4 e- ¡ 2 H2O(l)  E° = +1.23 V
The reduction of oxygen, therefore, has a strong tendency to occur and can bring 
about the oxidation of other substances, especially metals. Notice that the half-­
reactions for the reduction of most metal ions are listed below the half-reactions for the 
reduction of oxygen in Table 19.1. Consequently, the oxidation (or corrosion) of those 
metals is spontaneous when paired with the reduction of oxygen. Corrosion is the 
opposite of the process by which metals are extracted from their ores. In extraction, the 
free metal is reduced out from its ore. In corrosion, the metal is oxidized.
▲ A metal must usually be 
reduced to extract it from its ore. In 
corrosion, the metal is oxidized back 
to its more natural state.

▼ Figure 19.27  Corrosion of 
Iron: Rusting  The oxidation of iron 
occurs at anodic regions on the 
metal surface. The iron ions migrate 
to cathodic regions, where they react 
with oxygen and water to form rust.
Corrosion of Iron
Given the ease with which metals oxidize in the presence of oxygen, acid, and water, why 
are metals used so frequently as building materials in the first place? Many metals form 
oxides that coat the surface of the metal and prevent further corrosion. For example, 
bare aluminum metal, with an electrode potential of -1.66 V, is quickly oxidized in the 
presence of oxygen. However, the oxide that forms at the surface of aluminum is Al2O3. In 
its crystalline form, Al2O3 is sapphire, a highly inert and structurally solid substance. The 
Al2O3 coating acts to protect the underlying aluminum metal, preventing further corrosion.
The oxides of iron, in contrast, are not structurally stable, and they tend to flake 
away from the underlying metal, exposing it to further corrosion. A significant part of 
the iron produced each year is used to replace rusted iron. Rusting is a redox reaction in 
which iron is oxidized according to the following half-reaction:
Fe(s) ¡ Fe2 +(aq) + 2 e-  E° = -0.45 V
This oxidation reaction tends to occur at defects on the surface of the iron—known as 
anodic regions because oxidation is occurring at these locations—as shown in Figure 19.27▼. 
The electrons produced at the anodic region travel through the metal to areas called 
cathodic regions where they react with oxygen and H+ ions dissolved in moisture:
O2(g) + 4 H+(aq) + 4 e- ¡ 2 H2O(l)  E° = +1.23 V
(The H+ ions come from carbonic acid, which naturally forms in water from carbon 
dioxide in air.) The overall reaction has a cell potential of +1.68 V and is highly 
spontaneous:
2 Fe(s) + O2(g) + 4 H+(aq) ¡ 2 H2O(l) + 2 Fe2 +(aq)  E°cell = +1.68 V
The Fe2+ ions formed in the anodic regions can migrate through moisture on the surface 
of the iron to cathodic regions, where they are further oxidized by reaction with more 
oxygen:
4 Fe2 +(aq) + O2(g) + (4 + 2n) H2O(l) ¡ 2 Fe2O3 # nH2O(s) + 8 H+(aq)
rust
Rust is a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide whose exact composition depends on the con-
ditions under which it forms.
Consider each of the following important aspects of the formation of rust:
• Moisture must be present for rusting to occur. The presence of water is necessary be-
cause water is a reactant in the last reaction and because charge (either electrons or 
ions) must be free to flow between the anodic and cathodic regions.
• Additional electrolytes promote rusting. The presence of an electrolyte (such as sodium 
chloride) on the surface of iron promotes rusting because it enhances current flow. 
This is why cars rust so quickly in cold climates where roads are salted, or in coastal 
areas where seawater mist is present.
• The presence of acids promotes rusting. Because H+ ions are involved in the reduction 
of oxygen, lower pH enhances the cathodic reaction and leads to faster rusting.

Preventing the Corrosion of Iron
Preventing the rusting of iron is a major industry. 
The most obvious way to prevent rust is to keep 
iron dry. Without water, the redox reaction 
cannot occur. Another way to prevent rust is to 
coat iron with a substance that is impervious to 
water. Cars, for example, are painted and sealed 
to prevent rust. A scratch in the paint can lead to 
rusting of the underlying iron.
Rust can also be prevented by placing a sacri-
ficial electrode in electrical contact with the iron. 
The sacrificial electrode must be composed of a 
metal that oxidizes more easily than iron (that is, 
it must be below iron in Table 19.1). The sacrificial 
electrode oxidizes in place of the iron (just as the 
more easily oxidizable species in a mixture is the 
one to oxidize), protecting the iron from oxida-
tion. A related way to protect iron from rusting is 
to coat it with a metal that oxidizes more easily 
than iron. Galvanized nails, for example, are 
coated with a thin layer of zinc. Since zinc has a 
more negative electrode potential than iron, it 
will oxidize in place of the underlying iron (just 
as a sacrificial electrode does). The oxide of zinc is not crumbly and remains on the nails as 
a protective coating.
▲ In galvanized nails, a layer of zinc 
prevents the underlying iron from 
rusting. The zinc oxidizes in place of 
the iron, forming a protective layer of 
zinc oxide.
▲ A scratch in paint often allows the 
underlying iron to rust.
Sacrificial
electrode
Iron pipe
▲ If a metal more active than iron, 
such as magnesium or aluminum, 
is in electrical contact with iron, the 
metal rather than the iron will be 
oxidized. This principle underlies the 
use of sacrificial electrodes to prevent 
the corrosion of iron.

Key Concepts
Pulling the Plug on the Power Grid (19.1)
▶
▶Oxidation–reduction reactions are reactions in which electrons 
are transferred from one reactant to another.
▶
▶In the most common form of fuel cell, an electrical current is cre-
ated as hydrogen is oxidized and oxygen is reduced; water is the 
only product.
Balancing Oxidation–Reduction Equations (19.2)
▶
▶Oxidation is the loss of electrons and corresponds to an increase 
in oxidation state; reduction is the gain of electrons and corre-
sponds to a decrease in oxidation state.
▶
▶We can balance redox reactions using the half-reaction method, 
in which the oxidation and reduction reactions are balanced sepa-
rately and then added. This method differs slightly for redox reac-
tions in acidic and in basic solutions.
Voltaic (or Galvanic) Cells: Generating Electricity 
from Spontaneous Chemical Reactions (19.3)
▶
▶A voltaic electrochemical cell separates the reactants of a sponta-
neous redox reaction into two half-cells that are connected by a 
wire and a means to exchange ions so that electricity is generated.
▶
▶In an electrochemical cell, the electrode where oxidation oc-
curs is the anode and the electrode where reduction occurs is the  
cathode; electrons flow from the anode to the cathode.
▶
▶The rate of electrons flowing through a wire is measured in am-
peres (A), and the cell potential is measured in volts (V).
▶
▶A salt bridge allows ions to flow between the half-cell solutions 
and prevent the buildup of charge.
▶
▶The cell diagram or line notation symbolizes electrochemical 
cells concisely by separating the components of the reaction  
using lines or commas.
Standard Electrode Potentials (19.4)
▶
▶The electrode potentials of half-cells are measured in relation to that 
of a standard hydrogen electrode, which is assigned an electrode  
potential of zero under standard conditions (solution concentra-
tions of 1 M, gas pressures of 1 atm, and a temperature of 25 °C).
▶
▶A species with a highly positive E° has a strong tendency to attract 
electrons and undergo reduction (and is therefore an excellent 
oxidizing agent).
▶
▶A species with a highly negative E° has a strong tendency to repel 
electrons and undergo oxidation (and is therefore an excellent re-
ducing agent).
Cell Potential, Free Energy, and the Equilibrium 
Constant (19.5)
▶
▶In a spontaneous reaction, E°cell is positive, the change in free 
energy (∆G°) is negative, and the equilibrium constant (K) is 
greater than 1.
▶
▶In a nonspontaneous reaction, E°cell is negative, ∆G° is positive, 
and K is less than 1.
▶
▶Because E°cell, ∆G°, and K all relate to spontaneity, we can derive 
equations relating all three quantities.
Cell Potential and Concentration (19.6)
▶
▶The standard cell potential (E°cell) is related to the cell potential 
(Ecell) by the Nernst equation, Ecell = E°cell - (0.0592 V>n) log Q.
▶
▶As shown by the Nernst equation, Ecell is related to the reaction 
quotient (Q); Ecell equals zero when Q equals K.
▶
▶In a concentration cell, the reactions at both electrodes are iden-
tical and electrons flow because of a difference in concentration. 
Nerve cells are a biological example of concentration cells.
Batteries: Using Chemistry to Generate  
Electricity (19.7)
▶
▶Batteries are packaged voltaic cells.
▶
▶Dry-cell batteries, including alkaline batteries, do not contain 
large amounts of water.
▶
▶The reactions in rechargeable batteries, such as lead–acid storage, 
nickel–cadmium, nickel–metal hydride, and lithium ion batteries, 
can be reversed.
▶
▶Fuel cells are similar to batteries except that fuel-cell reactants 
must be continually replenished from an external source.
Electrolysis: Driving Nonspontaneous Chemical 
Reactions with Electricity (19.8)
▶
▶An electrolytic electrochemical cell differs from a voltaic cell in 
that (1) an electrical charge is used to drive the reaction, and (2) al-
though the anode is still the site of oxidation and the cathode the 
site of reduction, they are represented with signs opposite those of 
a voltaic cell (anode +, cathode -).
▶
▶In electrolysis reactions, the anion is oxidized; if there is  
more than one anion, the anion with the more negative E° is 
oxidized.
▶
▶We can use stoichiometry to calculate the quantity of reactants 
consumed or products produced in an electrolytic cell.
Corrosion: Undesirable Redox Reactions (19.9)
▶
▶Corrosion is the undesired oxidation of metal by environmental 
oxidizing agents.
▶
▶When some metals, such as aluminum, oxidize, they form a sta-
ble compound that prevents further oxidation. Iron, in contrast, 
does not form a structurally stable compound when oxidized, and 
therefore, rust flakes off and exposes more iron to corrosion.
▶
▶Iron corrosion can be prevented by protecting iron from water, 
minimizing the presence of electrolytes and acids, or using a sac-
rificial electrode.

Answers to Conceptual Connections
Voltaic Cells
19.1	 (a) Electrons are negatively charged, and therefore, flow away 
from the more negatively charged electrode and toward the 
more positively charged electrode.
Standard Electrode Potentials
19.2	 (b) A negative electrode potential indicates that an electron 
at that electrode has greater potential energy than it has at a 
standard hydrogen electrode.
Selective Oxidation
19.3	 (d) The reduction of HNO3 is below the reduction of Br2 and 
above the reduction of I2 in Table 19.1. Since any reduction 
half-reaction is spontaneous when paired with the reverse of 
a half-reaction below it in the table, the reduction of HNO3 is 
spontaneous when paired with the oxidation of I- but is not 
spontaneous when paired with the oxidation of Br-.

n this chapter, we examine radioactivity and nuclear chemistry, both of which 
­involve changes within the nuclei of atoms. Unlike ordinary chemical processes, in 
which elements retain their identity, nuclear processes often result in one element 
changing into another, frequently emitting tremendous amounts of energy. 
Radioactivity has numerous applications, including the diagnosis and treatment of 
medical conditions such as cancer, thyroid disease, abnormal kidney and bladder func-
tion, and heart disease. Naturally occurring radioactivity allows us to estimate the age 
of fossils, rocks, and ancient artifacts. And radioactivity, perhaps most famously, led to 
the discovery of nuclear fission, used for electricity generation and nuclear weapons.
	 20.1	 Diagnosing Appendicitis
One morning a few years ago I awoke with a dull pain on the lower right side of my 
abdomen that was worse by early afternoon. Since pain in this area can indicate 
appendicitis (inflammation of the appendix), and since I know that appendicitis can 
be dangerous if left untreated, I went to the hospital emergency room. The doctor who 
examined me recommended a simple blood test to determine my white blood cell count. 
Patients with appendicitis usually have a high white blood cell count because the body 
is trying to fight the infection. In my case, the test was negative—I had a normal white 
blood cell count.

940	
Chapter 20  Radioactivity and Nuclear Chemistry
Although my symptoms were consistent with appendicitis, the negative blood test 
clouded the diagnosis. The doctor said that I could elect to have my appendix removed 
anyway (even though it might be healthy) or I could submit to another test that might 
confirm the appendicitis. I chose the additional test, which involved nuclear medicine, 
an area of medical practice that employs radioactivity to diagnose and treat disease. 
Radioactivity is the emission of subatomic particles or high-energy electromagnetic 
radiation by the nuclei of certain atoms. Such atoms are said to be radioactive. Most 
radioactive emissions can pass through many types of matter (such as skin and muscle, 
in this case).
During the test, antibodies—naturally occurring molecules that fight infection—
were labeled with radioactive atoms and then injected into my bloodstream. Because 
antibodies attack infection, they migrate to areas of the body where infection is pres-
ent. If my appendix was indeed infected, the antibodies would accumulate there. I 
waited about an hour, and then a technician took me to a room and laid me on a 
table. She inserted a photographic film in a panel above me and removed the covering 
that prevents exposure of the film. Radioactivity is invisible to the eye, but it exposes 
photographic film. If my appendix had been infected, it would have (by then) con-
tained a high concentration of the radioactively labeled antibodies. The antibodies 
would emit radiation and expose the film. The test, however, was negative. No radio-
activity was emanating from my appendix. After several hours, the pain in my abdo-
men subsided and I went home. I never did find out what caused the pain.
	 20.2	 The Discovery of Radioactivity
Radioactivity was first observed in 1896 by a French scientist named Antoine-Henri 
Becquerel (1852–1908). Becquerel was interested in the newly discovered X-rays (see 
Chapter 7), which were a hot topic of physics research in his time. He hypothesized that 
X-rays were emitted in conjunction with phosphorescence, the long-lived emission 
of light that sometimes follows the absorption of light by certain atoms and molecules. 
Phosphorescence is probably most familiar to you as the glow in glow-in-the-dark 
products (such as toys or stickers). After such a product is exposed to light, it reemits 
some of that light, usually at slightly longer wavelengths. If you turn off the room lights 
or put the glow-in-the-dark product in the dark, you see the greenish glow of the emitted 
light. Becquerel hypothesized that this visible greenish glow was 
associated with the emission of X-rays (which are invisible).
To test his hypothesis, Becquerel placed crystals—composed 
of potassium uranyl sulfate, a compound known to phospho-
resce—on top of a photographic plate wrapped in black cloth. 
He then exposed the crystals to sunlight. He knew the crystals 
had phosphoresced because he could see the emitted light when 
he brought them back into the dark. If the crystals had also emit-
ted X-rays, the X-rays would have passed through the black cloth 
and exposed the underlying photographic plate. Becquerel per-
formed the experiment several times and always got the same 
result—the photographic plate showed a dark exposure spot 
where the crystals had been (Figure 20.1◀). Becquerel believed 
his hypothesis was correct and presented the results—that phos-
phorescence and X-rays were linked—to the French Academy of 
Sciences.
Becquerel later retracted his results, however, when he dis-
covered that a photographic plate with the same crystals showed 
a dark exposure spot even when the plate and the crystals were 
stored in a drawer and not exposed to sunlight. Becquerel real-
ized that the crystals themselves were constantly emitting some-
thing that exposed the photographic plate, regardless of whether 
or not they phosphoresced. Becquerel concluded that it was the 
uranium within the crystals that was the source of the emissions, 
and he named the emissions uranic rays.
▲ The greenish light emitted 
from glow-in-the-dark toys is 
phosphorescence.
▲ Figure 20.1  The Discovery of Radioactivity  This 
photographic plate (with Becquerel’s original comments at top) 
played a key role in the discovery of radioactivity. Becquerel 
placed a uranium-containing compound on the plate (which 
was wrapped in black cloth to shield it from visible light). The 
plate was darkened by some unknown form of penetrating 
radiation that was produced continuously, independently of 
phosphorescence.

	
20.3  Types of Radioactivity	
941
Soon after Becquerel’s discovery, a young graduate student named Marie Sklodowska 
Curie (1867–1934) (one of the first women in France to pursue doctoral work) decided to 
study uranic rays for her doctoral thesis. Her first task was to determine whether any 
other substances besides uranium (the heaviest known element at the time) emitted 
these rays. In her search, Curie discovered two new elements, both of which also emitted 
uranic rays. Curie named one of her newly discovered elements polonium, after her 
home country of Poland. The other element she named radium, because of its high level 
of radioactivity. Radium is so radioactive that it gently glows in the dark and emits sig-
nificant amounts of heat. Since it was clear that these rays were not unique to uranium, 
Curie changed the name of uranic rays to radioactivity. In 1903, Curie and her husband, 
Pierre Curie, as well as Becquerel were all awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for the dis-
covery of radioactivity. In 1911, Curie received a second Nobel Prize, this time in chemis-
try, for her discovery of the two new elements.
	 20.3	 Types of Radioactivity
While Curie focused her work on discovering the different kinds of radioactive elements, 
Ernest Rutherford and others focused on characterizing the radioactivity itself. These 
scientists found that the emissions are produced by the nuclei of radioactive atoms. Such 
nuclei are unstable and spontaneously decompose, emitting small pieces of themselves 
to gain stability. These fragments are the radioactivity that Becquerel and Curie detected. 
Natural radioactivity can be categorized into several different types, including alpha (a) 
decay, beta (b) decay, gamma (g) ray emission, and positron emission. In addition, some 
unstable atomic nuclei can attain greater stability by absorbing electrons from one of 
the atoms’ own orbitals, a process called electron capture.
In order to understand these different types of radioactivity, we must briefly review 
the notation for symbolizing isotopes from Section 2.6. Recall that we can represent any 
isotope with the following notation:
Mass number (A) = the sum of the number of protons and number of
                                    neutrons in the nucleus
Atomic number (Z) = the number of protons in the nucleus
Chemical symbol
Z
AX
Mass number
Atomic number
Since A represents the sum of the number of protons and neutrons, and since Z repre-
sents the number of protons, the number of neutrons in the nucleus (N) is A - Z.
N  =  A − Z
Number of neutrons
For example, the symbol 21
10Ne represents the neon isotope containing 10 protons 
and 11 neutrons. The symbol 20
10Ne represents the neon isotope containing 10 protons 
and 10 neutrons. Remember that most elements have several different isotopes. When 
we are discussing nuclear properties, we often refer to a particular isotope (or species) of 
an element as a nuclide.
We represent the main subatomic particles—protons, neutrons, and electrons—
with similar notation.
Proton symbol 1
1p Neutron symbol 1
0n Electron symbol 0
-1e
The 1 in the lower left of the proton symbol represents 1 proton, and the 0 in the lower 
left corner of the neutron symbol represents 0 protons. The -1 in the lower left corner of 
the electron symbol is a bit different from the other atomic numbers, but it will make 
sense to you when we see it in the context of nuclear decay a bit later in this section.
▲ Marie Curie, one of the first 
women in France to pursue a 
doctoral degree, was twice awarded 
the Nobel Prize, in 1903 and 1911.

in about 1905. Irène (left) became 
a distinguished nuclear physicist in 
her own right, winning a Nobel Prize

acclaimed biography of her mother.

Types of Radioactivity

Chapter 20  Radioactivity and Nuclear Chemistry
Alpha (A) Decay
Alpha (A) decay occurs when an unstable nucleus emits a particle 
composed of two protons and two neutrons (Figure 20.2◀). Since 
two protons and two neutrons combined are identical to a helium-4 
nucleus, the symbol for alpha radiation is the symbol for helium-4:
	
Alpha (A) particle	
4
2He	
When an element emits an alpha particle, the number of pro-
tons in its nucleus changes, transforming the element into a differ-
ent element. We symbolize this phenomenon with a nuclear 
equation, an equation that represents nuclear processes such as 
radioactivity. For example, the nuclear equation for the alpha decay 
of uranium-238 is:
Parent nuclide
Daughter nuclide
90
234T
24He
92
238U
+
The original atom is the parent nuclide, and the product of the decay is the daughter 
nuclide. In this case, uranium-238 (the parent nuclide) becomes thorium-234 (the daughter 
nuclide). Unlike a chemical reaction, in which elements retain their identities, in a nuclear 
reaction elements often change their identities. Like a chemical equation, however, a 
nuclear equation must be balanced. The sum of the atomic numbers on both sides of a nuclear 
equation must be equal, and the sum of the mass numbers on both sides must also be equal:
238
92 U ¡ 234
90 Th + 4
2 He
Reactants
Products
Sum of mass numbers = 238
Sum of mass numbers = 234 + 4 = 238
Sum of atomic numbers = 92
Sum of atomic numbers =  90 + 2 = 92
We can deduce the identity and symbol of the daughter nuclide in any alpha 
decay from the mass and atomic number of the parent nuclide. During alpha decay, 
the mass number decreases by 4 and the atomic number decreases by 2, as shown in 
Example 20.1.

For Practice 20.1  Write the nuclear equation for the alpha decay of Po-216.
As we discuss in Section 20.4, nuclei 
are unstable when they are too large 
or when they contain an unbalanced 
ratio of neutrons to protons.
In nuclear chemistry, we are primarily 
interested in changes within the 
nucleus; therefore, the 2+ charge 
that we would normally write for a 
helium nucleus is omitted for an 
alpha particle.
Alpha radiation is the 18-wheeler truck of radioactivity. The alpha particle is by far 
the most massive of all particles commonly emitted by radioactive nuclei. Conse-
quently, alpha radiation has the most potential to interact with and damage other 
molecules, including biological ones. Highly energetic radiation interacts with other 
molecules and atoms by ionizing them. When radiation ionizes molecules within the 

	
20.3  Types of Radioactivity	
943
cells of living organisms, the cells can usually repair the damage. However, in some 
cases the cells can die or begin to reproduce abnormally. The ability of radiation to 
ionize other molecules and atoms is called its ionizing power. Of all types of radio-
activity, alpha radiation has the highest ionizing power.
However, alpha particles, because of their large size, have the lowest penetrating 
power—the ability to penetrate matter. (Imagine a semi trying to get through a traffic 
jam.) In order for radiation to damage important molecules within living cells, it must 
penetrate into the cell. Alpha radiation does not easily penetrate into cells because it can 
be stopped by a sheet of paper, by clothing, or even by air. Consequently, a low-level 
alpha emitter that remains outside the body is relatively safe. However, consuming large 
amounts of an alpha emitter can be dangerous because the alpha particles then have 
direct access to the molecules that compose organs and tissues.
Beta (B) Decay
Beta (B) decay occurs when an unstable nucleus emits an electron (Figure 20.3▶). 
How does a nucleus, which contains only protons and neutrons, emit an electron? In 
some unstable nuclei, a neutron changes into a proton and emits an electron:
Beta decay   Neutron ¡ proton + emitted electron
The symbol for a beta (b) particle in a nuclear equation is:
Beta (B) particle         
0
-1e         
We represent beta decay with this nuclear equation:
1
0n ¡ 1
1p +
0
-1e
The -1 reflects the charge of the electron, which is equivalent to an atomic number of 
-1 in a nuclear equation. When an atom emits a beta particle, its atomic number 
increases by 1 because it then has an additional proton. For example, the nuclear equa-
tion for the beta decay of radium-228 is:
228
88Ra ¡ 228
89Ac +
0
-1e
Notice that the nuclear equation is balanced—the sum of the mass numbers on both 
sides is equal, and the sum of the atomic numbers on both sides is equal.
Beta radiation is the four-door sedan of radioactivity. Beta particles are much less 
massive than alpha particles and consequently have a lower ionizing power. However, 
because of their smaller size, beta particles have a higher penetrating power and only 
something as substantive as a sheet of metal or a thick piece of wood stops them. Conse-
quently, a beta emitter outside of the body poses a higher risk than an alpha emitter. If 
ingested, however, the beta emitter does less damage than an alpha emitter.
Gamma (G) Ray Emission
Gamma (G) ray emission is significantly different from alpha or beta radiation. 
Gamma radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation (see Section 7.2). Gamma rays are 
high-energy (short-wavelength) photons. The symbol for a gamma ray is:
Gamma (G) ray       
0
0g         
A gamma ray has no charge and no mass. When a gamma-ray photon is emitted 
from a radioactive atom, it does not change the mass number or the atomic number of 
the element. Gamma rays are usually emitted from nuclei in excited states or in conjunc-
tion with other types of radiation. For example, the alpha emission of U-238 (discussed 
previously) is also accompanied by the emission of a gamma ray:
238
92U ¡ 234
90Th + 4
2He + 0
0g
The emission of gamma rays in conjunction with other types of radiation is so com-
mon that it is often left out of nuclear equations. Nuclear chemists simply understand 
that the gamma rays are emitted along with the other types of decay. However, in some 
instances, there can be a delay between the initial decay and the subsequent emission of 
gamma ray. The initial decay leaves the daughter nucleus in metastable state (an unsta-
ble state that can exist for a prolonged period of time). The daughter then emits a

to its negative charge.

metastable state:

The m next to the mass number stands for metastable.
Gamma rays are the motorbikes of radioactivity. They have the lowest ionizing 
power, but the highest penetrating power. (Imagine a motorbike zipping through a traf-
fic jam.) Shielding gamma rays requires several inches of lead or thick slabs of concrete.
Positron Emission
Positron emission occurs when an unstable nucleus emits a positron (Figure 20.4◀). 
A positron is the antiparticle of the electron; it has the same mass as an electron, but 
the opposite charge. If a positron collides with an electron, the two particles annihilate 
each other, releasing energy in the form of gamma rays. In positron emission, a proton is 
converted into a neutron and emits a positron:
Positron emission            Proton ¡ neutron + emitted positron
The symbol for a positron in a nuclear equation is:
Positron           0
+1e         
We represent positron emission with this nuclear equation:
1
1p ¡ 1
0n +
0
+1e
When an atom emits a positron, its atomic number decreases by 1 because it has one less 
proton after emission. Consider the nuclear equation for the positron emission of 
phosphorus-30 as an example:
30
15P ¡ 30
14Si +
0
+1e
We can determine the identity and symbol of the daughter nuclide in any positron emis-
sion in a manner similar to that used for alpha and beta decay, as shown in Example 20.2. 
Positrons are similar to beta particles in their ionizing and penetrating power.
Electron Capture
Unlike the forms of radioactive decay that we have discussed so far, electron capture 
involves a particle being absorbed by rather than emitted from an unstable nucleus. 
Electron capture occurs when a nucleus assimilates an electron from an inner orbital 
of its electron cloud. Like positron emission, the net effect of electron capture is the 
conversion of a proton into a neutron:
Electron capture          Proton + electron ¡ neutron
We represent electron capture with this nuclear equation:
1
1p +
0
-1e ¡ 1
0n
When an atom undergoes electron capture, its atomic number decreases by 1 because it 
has one less proton. For example, when Ru-92 undergoes electron capture, its atomic 
number changes from 44 to 43:
92
44Ru +
0
-1e ¡ 92
43Tc

	 20.4	 The Valley of Stability: Predicting the 
Type of Radioactivity
So far, we have described various different types of radioactivity. But we have not 
discussed what causes a particular nuclide to be radioactive in the first place. And why 
do some nuclides decay via alpha decay, while others decay via beta decay or positron 
emission? The answers to these questions are not simple, but we can get a basic idea of 
the factors that influence the stability of the nucleus and the nature of its decay.
A nucleus is a collection of protons (positively charged) and neutrons (uncharged). We 
know that positively charged particles such as protons repel one another. So what binds the 
nucleus together? A fundamental force of physics known as the strong force binds the 
nucleus together. All nucleons—protons and neutrons—are attracted to one another by 
the strong force. However, the strong force acts only at very short distances. We can think of 
the stability of a nucleus as a balance between the repulsive coloumbic force among protons 
and the attractive strong force among all nucleons. The neutrons in a nucleus, therefore, 
play an important role in stabilizing the nucleus because they attract other nucleons 
(through the strong force) but lack the repulsive force associated with positive charge.
It might seem that adding more neutrons would always 
lead to greater stability, so that the more neutrons the better. 
This is not the case, however, because protons and neutrons 
occupy energy levels in a nucleus that are similar to those 
occupied by electrons in an atom. As you add more neutrons, 
the neutrons must occupy increasingly higher energy levels 
within the nucleus. At some point, the energy payback from 
the strong force is not enough to compensate for the high 
energy state that the neutrons must occupy.
An important number in determining nuclear stability is 
the ratio of neutrons to protons (N>Z). Figure 20.5◀ is a plot of 
the number of neutrons versus the number of protons for all 
known nuclei. The yellow dots represent unstable nuclei and 
the green dots represent stable ones. The region of the graph 
with the green dots (stable nuclei) is known as the valley (or 
island) of stability. Notice that for the lighter elements, the 
N>Z ratio of stable nuclei is about 1 (equal numbers of neu-
trons and protons). For example, the most abundant isotope 
of carbon (Z = 6) is carbon-12, which contains six protons 
and six neutrons. However, beyond about Z = 20, the N>Z 
ratio of stable nuclei begins to get larger. For example, at Z = 44 
stable nuclei have N>Z ratios of about 1.275 and at Z = 80, the 
N>Z ratio reaches about 1.5. Above Z = 83, stable nuclei do 
not exist—bismuth (Z = 83) is the heaviest element with 
­stable (nonradioactive) isotopes.

20.4  The Valley of Stability: Predicting the Type of Radioactivity	
947
The type of radioactivity emitted by a nuclide depends in part on the N>Z ratio.
N, Z too high: Nuclides that lie above the valley of stability have too many ­neutrons 
and tend to convert neutrons to protons via beta decay. The process of undergoing 
beta decay moves the nuclide down in the plot in Figure 20.5 and closer to (or into) 
the valley of stability.
N, Z too low: Nuclides that lie below the valley of stability have too many protons 
and tend to convert protons to neutrons via positron emission or electron capture. 
This moves the nuclide up in the plot in Figure 20.5 and closer to (or into) the valley 
of stability.
One way to decide whether a particular nuclide has an N>Z that is too high, too low, 
or about right is to consult Figure 20.5. Those nuclides that lie within the valley of stability 
are stable. Alternatively, we can also compare the mass number of the nuclide to the atomic 
mass listed in the periodic table for the corresponding element. The atomic mass is an aver-
age of the masses of the stable nuclides for an element and thus represents an N>Z that is 
about right. For example, suppose we want to evaluate N>Z for Ru-112. Ruthenium has an 
atomic mass of 101.07, so we know that the nuclide with a mass number of 112 contains 
too many neutrons and therefore has an N>Z that is too high. The following example dem-
onstrates how to apply these considerations in predicting the mode of decay for a nucleus.
Example 20.3	
Predicting the Type of Radioactive Decay
Predict whether each nuclide is more likely to decay via beta decay or positron 
emission.
(a)	 Mg-28	
(b)	 Mg-22	
(c)	 Mo-102
Solution
(a)	 Magnesium-28 has 16 neutrons and 12 protons, so N>Z = 1.33. However, for 
Z = 12, you can see from Figure 20.5 that stable nuclei should have an N>Z 
of about 1. Alternatively, you can see from the periodic table that the atomic 
mass of magnesium is 24.31. Therefore, a nuclide with a mass number of 28 is 
too heavy to be stable because the N>Z ratio is too high and Mg-28 undergoes 
beta decay, resulting in the conversion of a neutron to a proton.
(b)	 Magnesium-22 has 10 neutrons and 12 protons, so N>Z = 0.83 (too low). 
Alternatively, you can see from the periodic table that the atomic mass of 
magnesium is 24.31. A nuclide with a mass number of 22 is too light; the N>Z 
ratio is too low. Therefore, Mg-22 undergoes positron emission, resulting in the 
conversion of a proton to a neutron. (Electron capture would accomplish the 
same thing as positron emission, but in Mg-22, positron emission is the only 
decay mode observed.)
(c)	 Molybdenum-102 has 60 neutrons and 42 protons, so N>Z = 1.43. However, 
for Z = 42, you can see from Figure 20.5 that stable nuclei should have N>Z 
ratios of about 1.3. Alternatively, you can see from the periodic table that the 
atomic mass of molybdenum is 95.94. A nuclide with a mass number of 102 is 
too heavy to be stable; the N>Z ratio is too high. Therefore, Mo-102 
undergoes beta decay, resulting in the conversion of a neutron to a proton.

decay or positron emission.

Magic Numbers
In addition to the N>Z ratio, the actual number of protons and neutrons also affects the 
stability of the nucleus. Table 20.2 shows the number of nuclei with different possible 
combinations of even or odd nucleons. Notice that a large number of stable nuclides 
have both an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons. Only five stable 
nuclides have an odd and odd combination.

Chapter 20  Radioactivity and Nuclear Chemistry
The reason for this is that nucleons occupy energy levels within the nucleus much 
as electrons occupy energy levels within an atom. Just as atoms with certain numbers of 
electrons are uniquely stable (in particular, the number of electrons associated with the 
noble gases: 2, 10, 18, 36, 54, etc.), so atoms with certain numbers of nucleons (N or 
Z = 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and N = 126) are uniquely stable. These numbers are referred 
to as magic numbers. Nuclei containing a magic number of protons or neutrons are 
particularly stable. Since the magic numbers are even, this accounts in part for the 
abundance of stable nuclides with even numbers of nucleons. Moreover, nucleons also 
have a tendency to pair (much as electrons pair). This tendency and the resulting stabil-
ity of paired nucleons also contribute to the abundance of stable nuclides with even 
numbers of nucleons.
Radioactive Decay Series
Atoms with Z 7 83 are radioactive and decay in one or more steps involving primarily 
alpha and beta decay (with some gamma decay to carry away excess energy). For 
example, uranium (atomic number 92) is the heaviest naturally occurring element. Its 
most common isotope is U-238, an alpha emitter that decays to Th-234:
238
92U ¡ 234
90Th + 4
2He
The daughter nuclide, Th-234, is itself radioactive—it is a beta emitter that decays to 
Pa-234:
234
90Th ¡ 234
91 Pa +

-1e
Protactinium-234 is also radioactive, decaying to U-234 via beta emission. Radioactive 
decay continues until a stable nuclide, Pb-206, is reached. Figure 20.6◀ illustrates the 
entire uranium-238 decay series.
	 20.5	 Detecting Radioactivity
The particles emitted by radioactive nuclei are very energetic and therefore can be 
readily detected. In a radiation detector, the particles are detected through their 
interactions with atoms or molecules. The most common radiation detectors are 
thermoluminescent dosimeters (Figure 20.7◀), which are issued to people working 
with or near radioactive substances. These dosimeters contain crystals of salts such as 
calcium fluoride that are excited by the ionizing radiation. The excited electrons are 
trapped by impurities that are intentionally introduced into the crystals. When the 
crystals are heated, the electrons relax to their ground state, emitting light. The amount 
of light emitted is proportional to the radiation exposure. These dosimeters are collected 
and processed regularly as a way to monitor a person’s exposure. We discuss the effects 
and measurement of exposure in more detail in Section 20.11.
Radioactivity can be instantly detected with devices such as a Geiger-Müller 
counter (Figure 20.8▶). In this instrument (commonly referred to as a Geiger coun-
ter), particles emitted by radioactive nuclei pass through an argon-filled chamber. 
The energetic particles create a trail of ionized argon atoms. High voltage applied 
between a wire within the chamber and the chamber itself causes these newly formed 
ions to produce an electrical signal that can be displayed on a meter or turned into an 
audible click. Each click corresponds to a radioactive particle passing through the 
argon gas chamber. This clicking is the stereotypical sound most people associate 
with a radiation detector.
A second type of device commonly used to detect radiation instantly is a  
scintillation counter. In a scintillation counter, radioactive emissions pass through a 
material (such as NaI or CsI) that emits ultraviolet or visible light in response to 
­excitation by high-energy photons. The photons excite the atoms to a higher-energy 
state. The atoms release this energy as light, which is detected and turned into an electri-
cal signal that is read on a meter.

	 20.6	 The Kinetics of Radioactive Decay  
and Radiometric Dating
Radioactivity is a natural component of our environment. The ground beneath you 
most likely contains radioactive atoms that emit radiation. The food you eat contains 
a residual quantity of radioactive atoms that are absorbed into your body fluids and 
incorporated into tissues. Small amounts of radiation from space make it through our 
atmosphere to constantly bombard Earth. Humans and other living organisms have 
evolved in this environment and have adapted to survive in it.
One reason for the radioactivity in our environment is the instability of all atomic 
nuclei beyond atomic number 83 (bismuth). Every element with more than 83 protons 
in its nucleus is unstable and therefore radioactive. In addition, some isotopes of ele-
ments with fewer than 83 protons are also unstable and radioactive. Radioactive nuclides 
persist in our environment because new radioactive nuclides are constantly being formed 
and because many of the existing ones decay away only very slowly.
All radioactive nuclei decay via first-order kinetics, so the rate of decay in a ­particular 
sample is directly proportional to the number of nuclei present as indicated in the 
equation:
Rate = kN
where N is the number of radioactive nuclei and k is the rate constant. Different radioac-
tive nuclides decay into their daughter nuclides with different rate constants. Some 
nuclides decay quickly (large rate constant), while others decay slowly (small rate 
constant).
The time it takes for one-half of the parent nuclides in a radioactive sample to decay 
to the daughter nuclides is the half-life and is identical to the concept of half-life for 
chemical reactions that we discussed in Chapter 14. Thus, the relationship between the 
half-life of a nuclide and its rate constant is given by the same expression (Equation 
14.19) that we derived for a first-order reaction in Section 14.4:
	
t1>2 = 0.693
k

[20.1]
Nuclides that decay quickly have short half-lives and large rate constants—they are 
considered very active (many decay events per unit time). Nuclides that decay slowly 
have long half-lives and are less active (fewer decay events per unit time). For example, 
thorium-232 is an alpha emitter with a half-life of 1.4 * 1010 years, or 14 billion years.  
A sample of Th-232 containing 1 million atoms decays to 12 million atoms in 14 billion

tive sample does not decay to zero atoms in two half-lives—we can’t add two half-lives 
together to get a “whole” life. The amount that remains after one half-life is always one-
half of what was present at the start. The amount that remains after two half-lives is one-
quarter of what was present at the start, and so on.

The Integrated Rate Law
Recall from Chapter 14 that for first-order chemical reactions, the concentration of a 
reactant as a function of time is given by the integrated rate law:
	
ln[A]t
[A]0
= -kt
[20.2]
Because nuclear decay follows first-order kinetics, we can substitute the number of 
nuclei for concentration to arrive at the equation:
	
lnNt
N0
= -kt
[20.3]
where Nt is the number of radioactive nuclei at time t and N0 is the initial number of 
radioactive nuclei. Example 20.4 demonstrates the use of this equation.
Example 20.4	
Radioactive Decay Kinetics
Plutonium-236 is an alpha emitter with a half-life of 2.86 years. If a sample initially contains 1.35 mg of Pu-236, what 
mass of Pu-236 is present after 5.00 years?
SORT  You are given the initial mass of Pu-236 in a sample and 
asked to find the mass after 5.00 years.
GIVEN:  mPu@236(initial) = 1.35  mg;
t = 5.00 yr; t1>2 = 2.86  yr
FIND:  mPu@236 (final)
STRATEGIZE  Use the integrated rate law (Equation 20.3) to solve 
this problem. You must determine the value of the rate constant 
(k) from the half-life expression (Equation 20.1).
Use the value of the rate constant, the initial mass of Pu-236, 
and the time along with integrated rate law to find the final 
mass of Pu-236. Since the mass of the Pu-236 (mPu@236) is directly 
­proportional to the number of atoms (N), and since the inte-
grated rate law contains the ratio (Nt>N0), you can substitute the 
initial and final masses for the initial and final number of atoms.

­original mass (1.35 mg), which seems reasonable given that the amount of time is between one and two half-lives. (One 
half-life would result in one-half of the original mass, and two half-lives would result in one-fourth of the original mass.)

Chapter 20  Radioactivity and Nuclear Chemistry
Since radioactivity is a first-order process, the rate of decay is linearly proportional 
to the number of nuclei in the sample. Therefore, the initial rate of decay (rate0) and the 
rate of decay at time t (ratet) can also be used in the integrated rate law:
Ratet = kNt   Rate0 = kN0

We can use Equation 20.4 to predict how the rate of decay of a radioactive sample will 
change with time or how much time has passed based on how the rate has changed (see 
examples later in this section).
The radioactive isotopes in our environment and their predictable decay with time 
can therefore be used to estimate the age of rocks or artifacts containing those isotopes. 
The technique is known as radiometric dating, and we examine two different types 
individually.

Radiocarbon Dating: Using Radioactivity to 
Measure the Age of Fossils and Artifacts
Archaeologists, geologists, anthropologists, and other scientists use 
radiocarbon dating, a technique devised in 1949 by Willard Libby 
(1908–1980) at the University of Chicago, to estimate the ages of fossils and 
artifacts. For example, in 1947, young shepherds searching for a stray goat 
near the Dead Sea (east of Jerusalem) entered a cave and discovered ancient 
scrolls that had been stuffed into jars. These scrolls—now named the Dead 
Sea Scrolls—are 2000-year-old texts of the Hebrew Bible, predating other 
previously discovered manuscripts by almost a thousand years.
The Dead Sea Scrolls, like other ancient artifacts, contain a radioac-
tive signature that reveals their age. This signature results from the pres-
ence of carbon-14 (which is radioactive) in the environment. Carbon-14 is constantly 
formed in the upper atmosphere by the neutron bombardment of nitrogen:
14
7N + 1
0n ¡ 14
6C + 1
1H
After it forms, carbon-14 decays back to nitrogen by beta emission with a half-life of 5715 
years:
14
6C ¡ 14
7N +
0
-1e t1>2 = 5715 yr
The continuous formation of carbon-14 in the atmosphere and its continuous decay 
to nitrogen-14 produce a nearly constant steady-state amount of atmospheric carbon-14. 
The atmospheric carbon-14 is oxidized to carbon dioxide and incorporated into plants 
by photosynthesis. The C-14 then makes its way up the food chain and ultimately into 
all living organisms. As a result, the tissues in all living plants, animals, and humans con-
tain the same ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 (14C  :  12C) as that found in the atmo-
sphere. When a living organism dies, however, it stops incorporating new carbon-14 into 
its tissues. The 14C  :  12C ratio then begins to decrease with a half-life of 5715 years.
Because many artifacts, including the Dead Sea Scrolls, are made from materials that 
were once living—such as papyrus, wood, or other plant and animal derivatives—the 
14C  :  12C ratio in these artifacts indicates their age. For example, suppose an ancient artifact 
▲ The Dead Sea Scrolls are 
2000-year-old biblical manuscripts. 
Their age was determined by 
radiocarbon dating.
Libby received the Nobel Prize 
in 1960 for the development of 
radiocarbon dating.
A steady state is a set of 
conditions that results in constant 
concentrations of the relevant 
species.

	
20.6  The Kinetics of Radioactive Decay and Radiometric Dating

has a 14C  :  12C ratio that is 25% of that found in living organisms. How old is the artifact? 
Because it contains one-quarter as much carbon-14 as a living organism, it is two half-lives or 
11,460 years old. The maximum age that can be estimated from carbon-14 dating is about 
50,000 years—beyond that, the amount of carbon-14 is too low to measure accurately.
We can check the accuracy of carbon-14 dating against objects whose ages are 
known from historical sources. These kinds of comparisons reveal that ages obtained 
from C-14 dating deviate from the actual ages by up to about 5%. For a 6000-year-old 
object, that is an error of about 300 years. The reason for the deviations is the variance of 
atmospheric C-14 levels over time.
In order to make C-14 dating more accurate, scientists have studied the carbon-14 
content of western bristlecone pine trees, which can live up to 5000 years. The tree 
trunks of the pines contain growth rings corresponding to each year of the tree’s life, and 
the wood laid down in each ring incorporates carbon derived from the carbon dioxide in 
the atmosphere at that time. The rings thus provide a historical record of the atmo-
spheric carbon-14 content. In addition, the rings of living trees can be correlated with 
the rings of dead trees (if the lifetimes of the trees overlap), allowing the record to be 
extended back about 11,000 years. Using the data from the bristlecone pine, we can cor-
rect the 5% deviations from historical dates. In this way, the known ages of bristlecone 
pine trees are used to calibrate C-14 dating, resulting in more accurate results.
▲ Western bristlecone pine trees 
can live up to 5000 years; scientists 
can precisely determine the age of 
a tree by counting the annual rings 
in its trunk. In this way, the trees 
can calibrate the time scale for 
radiocarbon dating.
Example 20.5	
Radiocarbon Dating
A skull believed to belong to an ancient human being has a carbon-14 decay rate of 4.50 disintegrations per minute per 
gram of carbon (4.50 dis>min # g C). If living organisms have a decay rate of 15.3 dis>min # g C, how old is the skull? (The 
decay rate is directly proportional to the amount of carbon-14 present.)
SORT  You are given the current rate of decay for the skull 
and the assumed initial rate. You are asked to find the age of 
the skull, which is the time that passed in order for the rate 
to have reached its current value.

he Shroud of Turin—kept in the cathedral of Turin in Italy—is a linen cloth 
bearing a mysterious image. Many people have interpreted the image 
as that of a man who appears to have been crucified. The image becomes 
clearer if the shroud is photographed and viewed as a negative. Some claim 
that the shroud is the original burial cloth of Jesus, miraculously imprinted 
with his image. In 1988, the Roman Catholic Church chose three independent 
laboratories to perform radiocarbon dating on the shroud. The laboratories 
took samples of the cloth and measured the carbon-14 content. The three 
independent laboratories all arrived at similar results—the shroud was made 
from linen originating in about a.d. 1325. Although some have disputed the 
results (and continue to do so), and although no scientific test is 100%  
reliable, newspapers around the world announced that the Shroud did not 
date back to biblical times.

Uranium/Lead Dating
Radiocarbon dating can only measure the ages of objects that were once living and that 
are relatively young (650,000 years). Other radiometric dating techniques can measure 
the ages of prehistoric objects that were never alive. The most dependable technique 
relies on the ratio of uranium-238 to lead-206 within igneous rocks (rocks of volcanic 
origin). This technique measures the time that has passed since the rock solidified (at 
which point the “radiometric clock” is reset).
Because U-238 decays into Pb-206 with a half-life of 4.5 * 109 years, the relative 
amounts of U-238 and Pb-206 in a uranium-containing rock reveal its age. For example, 
if a rock originally contained U-238 and currently contains equal amounts of U-238 and 
Pb-206, it is 4.5 billion years old, assuming that the rock did not contain any Pb-206 
when it was formed. The latter assumption can be tested because the lead that results 
from the decay of uranium has a different isotopic composition than the lead that was 
deposited in rocks at the time of their formation. Example 20.6 shows how we can use 
the relative amounts of Pb-206 and U-238 to estimate a rock’s age.
CHECK  The units of the answer (yr) are correct. The magnitude of the answer is about 10,000 years, which is a little less 
than two half-lives. This value is reasonable given that two half-lives would result in a decay rate of about 3.8 dis>min # g C.
For Practice 20.5  A researcher claims that an ancient scroll originated from Greek scholars in about 500 b.c. Its 
carbon-14 decay rate is 89% of that found in living organisms. How old is the scroll, and could it be authentic?

Using Uranium/Lead Dating to Estimate the Age of a Rock
A meteor contains 0.556 g of Pb-206 to every 1.00 g of U-238. Assuming that the meteor did not contain any Pb-206 at 
the time of its formation, determine the age of the meteor. Uranium-238 decays to lead-206 with a half-life of 4.5 billion 
years.
SORT  You are given the current masses of 
Pb-206 and U-238 in a rock and asked to 
find its age. You are also given the half-life 
of U-238.

STRATEGIZE  Use the integrated rate law 
(Equation 20.3) to solve this problem. To 
do so, first determine the value of the rate 
constant (k) from the half-life expression 
(Equation 20.1).
Before substituting into the integrated 
rate law, you need the ratio of the current 
amount of U-238 to the original amount 
(Nt>N0). The current mass of uranium is 
simply 1.00 g. The initial mass includes the 
current mass (1.00 g) plus the mass that 
has decayed into lead-206, which you can 
determine from the current mass of Pb-206.
Use the value of the rate constant and the 
initial and current amounts of U-238 and 
the integrated rate law to find t.

contain any Pb-206 at the time of its formation, determine its age.
The Age of Earth
The uranium/lead radiometric dating technique as well as other radiometric dating 
techniques (such as the decay of potassium-40 to argon-40) have been widely used to 
measure the ages of rocks on Earth and have produced highly consistent results. Rocks 
with ages greater than 3.5 billion years have been found on every continent. The oldest 
rocks have an age of approximately 4.0 billion years, establishing a lower limit for Earth’s 
age (Earth is at least as old as its oldest rocks). The ages of about 70 meteorites that have 
struck Earth have also been extensively studied and have been found to be about 4.5 
billion years old. Since the meteorites were formed at the same time as our solar system 
(which includes Earth), the best estimate for Earth’s age is therefore about 4.5 billion years. 
That age is consistent with the estimated age of our universe—about 13.7 billion years.
The age of the universe is estimated 
from its expansion rate, which can be 
measured by examining changes in 
the wavelength of light from distant 
galaxies.

Berlin laboratory. Together with 
Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, Meitner 
determined that U-235 could 
undergo nuclear fission.
	 20.7	 The Discovery of Fission: The Atomic 
Bomb and Nuclear Power
In the mid-1930s Enrico Fermi (1901–1954), an Italian physicist, attempted to synthesize 
a new element by bombarding uranium—the heaviest known element at that time—
with neutrons. Fermi speculated that if a neutron could be incorporated into the nucleus 
of a uranium atom, the nucleus might undergo beta decay, converting a neutron into a 
proton. If that happened, a new element, with atomic number 93, would be synthesized 
for the first time. The nuclear equation for the process is shown here:

Fermi performed the experiment and detected the emission of beta particles. How-
ever, his results were inconclusive. Had he synthesized a new element? Fermi never 
chemically examined the products to determine their composition and therefore could 
not say with certainty that he had.
Three researchers in Germany—Lise Meitner (1878–1968), Fritz Strassmann 
(1902–1980), and Otto Hahn (1879–1968)—repeated Fermi’s experiments and then 
performed careful chemical analysis of the products. What they found in the 
­products—several elements lighter than uranium—would change the world forever. 
On January 6, 1939, Meitner, Strassmann, and Hahn reported that the neutron bom-
bardment of uranium resulted in nuclear fission—the splitting of the uranium 
atom. The nucleus of the neutron-bombarded uranium atom was split into barium, 
krypton, and other smaller products. They also determined that the process emits 
enormous amounts of energy. A nuclear equation for a fission reaction, showing how 
uranium breaks apart into the daughter nuclides, is shown here:

Notice that the initial uranium atom is the U-235 isotope, which constitutes less 
than 1% of all naturally occurring uranium. U-238, the most abundant uranium iso-
tope, does not undergo fission. Notice also that the process produces three neutrons, 
which have the potential to initiate fission in three other U-235 atoms.
Scientists quickly realized that a sample rich in U-235 could undergo a chain 
reaction in which neutrons produced by the fission of one uranium nucleus would 
induce fission in other uranium nuclei (Figure 20.10▶). This self-amplifying reaction 
is capable of producing an enormous amount of energy. This is the energy that is har-
nessed in an atomic bomb. However, to make a bomb, a critical mass of U-235—
enough U-235 to produce a self-sustaining reaction—is necessary.
The Manhattan Project
Fearing that Nazi Germany would develop a bomb based on nuclear fission, several 
U.S. scientists persuaded Albert Einstein, the most famous scientist of the time, to 
write a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt warning of this possibility. Einstein 
wrote, “. . . and it is conceivable—though much less certain—that extremely powerful 
bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by 
boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with 
some of the surrounding territory.”
The element with atomic number 100 
is named fermium in honor of Enrico 
Fermi.
The element with atomic number 109 
is named meitnerium in honor of Lise 
Meitner.

shown here) encouraged Franklin 
Roosevelt to fund research for a 
fission bomb.

958	
Chapter 20  Radioactivity and Nuclear Chemistry
Einstein’s letter helped persuade Roosevelt, and in 1941 he assembled the resources 
to begin the costliest scientific project ever attempted. The top-secret endeavor was 
called the Manhattan Project and its primary goal was to build an atomic bomb before the 
Germans did. Physicist J. R. Oppenheimer (1904–1967) led the project at a high-security 
research facility in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Four years later, on July 16, 1945, the United 
States detonated the world’s first nuclear weapon at a test site in New Mexico. The first 
atomic bomb exploded with a force equivalent to 18,000 tons of dynamite. Ironically, 
the Germans—who had not made a successful nuclear bomb—had already been defeated 
by this time. Instead, the United States used the atomic bomb on Japan. One bomb was 
dropped on Hiroshima and a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Together, the 
bombs killed approximately 200,000 people and led to Japan’s surrender.
Nuclear Power: Using Fission to Generate Electricity
Nuclear reactions, such as fission, generate enormous amounts of energy. In a nuclear 
bomb, the energy is released all at once. The energy can also be released more slowly and 
used for peaceful purposes such as electricity generation. In the United States, nuclear 
fission generates about 20% of electricity. In some other countries, nuclear fission 
generates as much as 70% of electricity. To get an idea of the amount of energy released 
during fission, imagine a hypothetical nuclear-powered car. Suppose the fuel for such 
a car was a uranium cylinder about the size of a pencil. How often would you have to 
refuel the car? The energy content of the uranium cylinder is equivalent to about 1000 
twenty-gallon tanks of gasoline. If you refuel your gasoline-powered car once a week, 
your nuclear-powered car could go 1000 weeks—almost 20 years—before refueling.
Similarly, a nuclear-powered electricity generation plant can produce a lot of elec-
tricity from a small amount of fuel. Such plants exploit the heat created by fission, 
using it to boil water and make steam, which then turns the turbine on a generator to 
produce electricity (Figure 20.11▼). The fission reaction occurs in the nuclear core of

contact with the steam that drives the turbines.)

the power plant. The core consists of uranium fuel rods—enriched to about 3.5% 
U-235—­interspersed between retractable neutron-absorbing control rods. When the 
control rods are retracted from the fuel rod assembly, the chain reaction can occur. 
When the control rods are fully inserted into the fuel assembly, however, they absorb 
the neutrons that would otherwise induce fission, shutting down the chain reaction. 
By retracting or inserting the control rods, the operator increases or decreases the rate 
of fission. In this way, the fission reaction is controlled to produce the right amount of 
heat needed for electricity generation. In case of a power failure, the control rods auto-
matically drop into the fuel rod assembly, shutting down the fission reaction.
A typical nuclear power plant generates enough electricity for a city of about one 
million people and uses about 50 kg of fuel per day. In contrast, a coal-burning power 
plant uses about 2,000,000 kg of fuel to generate the same amount of electricity. 
­Furthermore, a nuclear power plant generates no air pollution and no greenhouse gases. 
A coal-burning power plant emits pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, 
and sulfur oxides. Coal-burning power plants also emit carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.
Problems with Nuclear Power
Nuclear power generation, however, is not without problems. Foremost among them 
is the danger of nuclear accidents. In spite of safety precautions, the fission reaction 
occurring in a nuclear power plant can overheat. The most famous examples of this 
occurred in Chernobyl, in the former Soviet Union, on April 26, 1986, and at the 
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan in March of 2011.
In the Chernobyl incident, operators of the plant were performing an experiment 
designed to reduce maintenance costs. In order to perform the experiment, they had to 
disable many of the safety features of the reactor core. The experiment failed with disas-
trous results. The nuclear core, composed partly of graphite, overheated and began to 
burn. The accident caused 31 immediate deaths and produced a fire that scattered 
radioactive debris into the atmosphere, making much of the surrounding land (within 
about a 32-kilometer radius) uninhabitable. As bad as the accident was, however, it was 
a not a nuclear detonation. A nuclear power plant cannot become a nuclear bomb. The 
uranium fuel used in electricity generation is not sufficiently enriched in U-235 to pro-
duce a nuclear detonation. U.S. nuclear power plants have additional safety features 
designed to prevent similar accidents. For example, U.S. nuclear power plants have large 
containment structures to contain radioactive debris in the event of an accident.
In the 2011 Japanese accident, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami 
that flooded the coastal plant and caused the cooling system pumps to fail. Three of 
the nuclear cores within the plant dramatically overheated and experienced a partial 
meltdown (in which the fuel becomes so hot that it melts). The accident was intensi-
fied by the loss of water in the fuel storage ponds (pools of water normally used to 
keep spent fuel cool), which caused the fuel stored in the ponds to also overheat. The 
release of radiation into the environment, however, while significant, was much lower 
in Japan than at Chernobyl. In fact, no radioactivity-related deaths were reported at 
the Fukushima plant or the surrounding area. The cleanup of the site, however, will 
continue for many years.
A second problem associated with nuclear power is waste disposal. Although the 
amount of nuclear fuel used in electricity generation is small compared to other fuels, 
some of the products of the reaction are radioactive and have long half-lives. What do 
we do with this waste? Currently, in the United States, nuclear waste is stored on site at 
the nuclear power plants. A single permanent disposal site was being developed in Yucca 
Mountain, Nevada, to store U.S. waste. However, in 2010, the Obama administration 
halted the development of this project and formed the Blue Ribbon Commission on 
America’s Nuclear Future to explore alternatives. The committee has made several 
important recommendations. These include the development of both a temporary 
above-ground storage facility and a permanent underground facility. However, the com-
mittee has not made any decisions regarding Yucca Mountain as a potential site for the 
storage facility.
▲ In 1986, the reactor core at 
Chernobyl (in what is now Ukraine) 
overheated, exploded, and destroyed 
part of the containment structure. 
The release of radioactive nuclides 
into the environment forced the 
government to relocate over 
335,000 people.
Reactor cores in the United States 
are not made of graphite and cannot 
burn in the way that the Chernobyl 
core did.

	 20.8	 Converting Mass to Energy: Mass 
Defect and Nuclear Binding Energy
Nuclear fission produces large amounts of energy. But where does the energy come 
from? We can answer this question by carefully examining the masses of the reactants 
and products in the fission equation from Section 20.7:

236.05258 amu
235.86769 amu
Notice that the products of the nuclear reaction have less mass than the reactants. 
The missing mass is converted to energy. In Chapter 1, we learned that matter is con-
served in chemical reactions. In nuclear reactions matter can be converted to energy. 
The relationship between the amount of matter that is lost and the amount of energy 
formed is given by Einstein’s famous equation relating the two quantities:
E = mc2
where E is the energy produced, m is the mass lost, and c is the speed of light.
For example, in the fission reaction just shown, we calculate the quantity of energy 
produced as follows:
 Mass lost (m) = 236.05258 amu - 235.86769 amu
 = 0.18489 amu *
1.66054 * 10-27 kg
1 amu
 = 3.0702 * 10-28 kg
 Energy produced (E) = mc2
 = 3.0702 * 10-28 kg (2.9979 * 108 m>s)2
 = 2.7593 * 10-11 J
The result (2.7593 * 10-11 J) is the energy produced when one nucleus of U-235 under-
goes fission. This may not seem like much energy, but it is only the energy produced by 
the fission of a single nucleus. We can also calculate the energy produced per mole of 
U-235 to compare it to a chemical reaction:
2.7593 * 10-11 
J
U@235 atom * 6.0221 * 1023 U@235 atoms
1 mol U@235
= 1.6617 * 1013 J>mol U@235
The energy produced by the fission of 1 mol of U-235 is about 17 billion kJ. In contrast, a 
highly exothermic chemical reaction produces 1000 kJ per mole of reactant. Fission pro-
duces over a million times more energy per mole than chemical processes.
Mass Defect and Nuclear Binding Energy
We can examine the formation of a stable nucleus from its component particles as 
a nuclear reaction in which mass is converted to energy. For example, consider the 
formation of helium-4 from its components:

4.03298 amu
4.00260 amu
In a chemical reaction, there are 
also mass changes associated 
with the emission or absorption of 
energy. Because the energy involved 
in chemical reactions is so much 
smaller than that of nuclear reactions, 
however, these mass changes are 
completely negligible.
The electrons are contained on the 
left side in the two 1
1H, and on the 
right side in 4
2He. If you write the 
equation using only two protons on 
the left (1
1p), you must also add two 
electrons to the left.

	
20.8  Converting Mass to Energy: Mass Defect and Nuclear Binding Energy	
961
A helium-4 atom has less mass than the sum of the masses of its separate compo-
nents. This difference in mass, known as the mass defect, exists in all stable nuclei. The 
energy corresponding to the mass defect—obtained by substituting the mass defect into 
the equation E = mc2—is the nuclear binding energy, the amount of energy 
required to break apart the nucleus into its component nucleons.
Although chemists often report energies in joules, nuclear physicists often use 
the electron volt (eV) or megaelectron volt (MeV): 1 MeV = 1.602 * 10-13 J. Unlike 
energy in joules, which is typically reported per mole, energy in electron volts is 
reported per nucleus. A particularly useful conversion for calculating and reporting 
nuclear binding energies is the relationship between amu (mass units) and MeV 
(energy units):
1 amu = 931.5 MeV
A mass defect of 1 amu, when substituted into the equation E = mc2, gives an 
energy of 931.5 MeV. Using this conversion factor, we can readily calculate the binding 
energy of the helium nucleus:
 Mass defect = 4.03298 amu - 4.00260 amu
 = 0.03038 amu
 Nuclear binding energy = 0.03038 amu * 931.5 MeV
1 amu
 = 28.30 MeV
The binding energy of the helium nucleus is 28.30 MeV. In order to compare the binding 
energy of one nucleus to that of another, we calculate the binding energy per nucleon, 
which is the nuclear binding energy of a nuclide divided by the number of nucleons in 
the nuclide. For helium-4, we calculate the binding energy per nucleon as follows:
 Binding energy per nucleon = 28.30 MeV
4 nucleons
 = 7.075 MeV per nucleon 
We can calculate the binding energy per nucleon for other nuclides in the same 
way. For example, the nuclear binding energy of carbon-12 is 7.680 MeV per nucleon. 
Since the binding energy per nucleon of carbon-12 is greater than that of helium-4, 
we conclude the carbon-12 nuclide is more stable (it has lower potential energy).
An electron volt is defined as the 
kinetic energy of an electron that has 
been accelerated through a potential 
difference of 1 V.
Example 20.7	
Mass Defect and Nuclear Binding Energy
Calculate the mass defect and nuclear binding energy per nucleon (in MeV) for C-16, a radioactive isotope of carbon 
with a mass of 16.014701 amu.
Solution
Calculate the mass defect as the difference 
between the mass of one C-16 atom and the 
sum of the masses of six hydrogen atoms and 
10 neutrons.
 Mass defect = 6(mass 1
1H) + 10(mass 1
0n) - mass 16
 6 C
 = 6(1.00783 amu) + 10(1.00866 amu) - 16.014701 amu
 = 0.118879 amu
Calculate the nuclear binding energy by 
­converting the mass defect (in amu) into MeV. 
(Use 1 amu = 931.5 MeV.)
0.118879 amu * 931.5 MeV
amu
= 110.74 MeV
Determine the nuclear binding energy per 
nucleon by dividing by the number of nucleons 
in the nucleus.
 Nuclear binding energy per nucleon =

a mass of 238.050784 amu.

Chapter 20  Radioactivity and Nuclear Chemistry
The Nuclear Binding Energy Curve
Figure 20.12▲ shows the binding energy per nucleon plotted as a function of mass 
number (A). The binding energy per nucleon is relatively low for small mass numbers 
and increases until about A = 60, where it reaches a maximum. Nuclides with mass 
numbers of about 60, therefore, are among the most stable. Beyond A = 60, the 
binding energy per nucleon decreases again. Figure 20.12 illustrates why nuclear fission 
is a highly exothermic process. When a heavy nucleus, such as U-235, breaks up into 
smaller nuclei, such as Ba-140 and Kr-93, the binding energy per nucleon increases. This 
is analogous to a chemical reaction in which weak bonds break and strong bonds form. 
In both cases, the process is exothermic. Figure 20.12 also reveals that the combining of 
two lighter nuclei (below A = 60) to form a heavier nucleus is exothermic as well. This 
process is called nuclear fusion, which we discuss in the next section of this chapter.
	 20.9	 Nuclear Fusion: The Power of the Sun
Nuclear fission is the splitting of a heavy nucleus to form two or more lighter ones. 
Nuclear fusion, by contrast, is the combination of two light nuclei to form a 
heavier one. Both fusion and fission emit large amounts of energy because, as we 
have just seen, they both form daughter nuclides with greater binding energies 
per nucleon than the parent nuclides. Nuclear fusion is the energy source of stars, 
including our sun. In stars, hydrogen atoms fuse together to form helium atoms, 
emitting energy in the process.
Nuclear fusion is also the basis of hydrogen bombs. A modern hydrogen 
bomb has up to 1000 times the explosive force of the first atomic bombs. These 
bombs employ the fusion reaction shown here:

1H + 3
1 H ¡ 4
2He + 1
0n
In this reaction, deuterium (the isotope of hydrogen with one neutron) and tri-
tium (the isotope of hydrogen with two neutrons) combine to form helium-4 and 
a ­neutron (Figure 20.13◀). Because fusion reactions require two positively charged 
nuclei (which repel each other) to fuse together, extremely high temperatures are 
required. In a hydrogen bomb, a small fission bomb is detonated first, creating 
­temperatures and pressures high enough for fusion to proceed.
Nuclear fusion has been intensely investigated as a way to produce electricity. 
Because of the higher energy density—fusion provides about ten times more energy 
per gram of fuel than does fission—and because the products of the reaction are

less problematic than those of fission, fusion holds promise as a 
future energy source. However, despite concerted efforts, the genera-
tion of electricity by fusion remains elusive. One of the main prob-
lems is the high temperature required for fusion to occur—no 
material can withstand those temperatures. Using powerful magnetic 
fields or laser beams, scientists have succeeded in compressing and 
heating nuclei to the point where fusion has been initiated and even 
sustained for brief periods of time (Figure 20.14▶). To date, however, 
the amount of energy generated by fusion reactions has been less 
than the amount required to get it to occur. After years of spending 
billions of dollars on fusion research, the U.S. Congress has reduced 
funding for these projects. Whether fusion will ever be a viable 
energy source remains uncertain.
	20.10	 Nuclear Transmutation and 
Transuranium Elements
One of the goals of the early chemists of the Middle Ages, who 
were known as alchemists, was the transformation of ordinary metals into gold. Many 
alchemists hoped to turn low-cost metals, such as lead or tin, into precious metals, 
and in this way become wealthy. These alchemists were never successful because their 
attempts were merely chemical—they mixed different metals together or tried to get 
them to react with other substances in order to turn them into gold. In a chemical 
reaction, an element retains its identity, so a less valuable metal—such as lead—always 
remains lead, even when it forms a compound with another element.
Nuclear reactions, in contrast to chemical reactions, result in the transformation of 
one element into another, a process known as transmutation. We have already seen 
how this occurs in radioactive decay, in fission, and in fusion. In addition, other nuclear 
reactions that transmute elements are possible. For example, in 1919 Ernest Rutherford 
bombarded nitrogen-17 with alpha particles to form oxygen:
14
7N + 4
2He ¡  17
8O + 1
1H
Irène Joliot-Curie (daughter of Marie Curie) and her husband Frédéric bombarded 
aluminum-27 with alpha particles to form phosphorus:

13Al + 4
2He ¡  30
15P + 1
0n
In the 1930s, scientists began building devices that accelerate particles to high velocities, 
opening the door to even more possibilities. These devices are generally of two types, the 
linear accelerator and the cyclotron.
In a single-stage linear accelerator, a charged particle such as a proton is accelerated 
in an evacuated tube. The accelerating force is provided by a potential difference (or volt-
age) between the ends of the tube. In multistage linear accelerators, such as the Stanford 
Linear Accelerator (SLAC) at Stanford University, a series of tubes of increasing length are 
connected to a source of alternating voltage, as shown in Figure 20.15▼. The voltage 
alternates in such a way that, as a positively charged particle leaves a particular tube,

At the same time, the tube that 
the particle is now approaching 
becomes negatively charged, 
pulling the particle toward it. This 
process repeats through a number 
of tubes until the particle has been 
accelerated to a high velocity.

in California. The Fermi National 
Accelerator Laboratory complex in

after they are made.
that tube becomes positively charged, repelling the particle to the next tube. At the same 
time, the tube that the particle is now approaching becomes negatively charged, pulling 
the particle toward it. This continues throughout the linear accelerator, allowing the 
particle to be accelerated to velocities up to 90% of the speed of light. When particles of 
this speed collide with a target, they produce a shower of subatomic particles that can be 
studied. For example, researchers using the Stanford Linear Accelerator were awarded 
the 1990 Nobel Prize in physics for discovering evidence that protons and neutrons were 
composed of still smaller subatomic particles called quarks.
In a cyclotron, a similarly alternating voltage is used to accelerate a charged particle, 
only this time the alternating voltage is applied between the two semicircular halves of 
the cyclotron (Figure 20.16▲). A charged particle originally in the middle of the two 
semicircles is accelerated back and forth between them. Additional magnets cause the 
particle to move in a spiral path. As the charged particle spirals out from the center, it 
gains speed and eventually exits the cyclotron aimed at the target.
With linear accelerators or cyclotrons, all sorts of nuclear transmutations can be 
achieved. In this way, scientists have made nuclides that don’t normally exist in nature. 
For example, uranium-238 can be made to collide with carbon-12 to form an element 
with atomic number 98:
238
92U + 12
6C ¡  244
98Cf + 61

This element was named californium (Cf) because it was first produced (by a slightly differ-
ent nuclear reaction) at the University of California at Berkeley. Many other nuclides with 
atomic numbers larger than that of uranium have been synthesized since the 1940s. These 
synthetic elements—called transuranium elements—have been added to the periodic table.

	20.11	 The Effects of Radiation on Life
As we discussed in Section 20.2, the energy associated with radioactivity can ionize 
molecules. When radiation ionizes important molecules in living cells, problems can 
develop. The ingestion of radioactive materials—especially alpha and beta emitters—is

particularly dangerous because the radioactivity once inside the body can do additional 
damage. The effects of radiation can be divided into three different types, which we 
discuss in this section: acute radiation damage, increased cancer risk, and genetic effects.
Acute Radiation Damage
Acute radiation damage results from exposure to large amounts of radiation in a short period 
of time. The main sources of this kind of exposure are nuclear bombs and exposed nuclear 
reactor cores. These high levels of radiation kill large numbers of cells. Rapidly dividing 
cells, such as those in the immune system and the intestinal lining, are most susceptible to 
radiation. Consequently, people exposed to high levels of radiation have weakened immune 
systems and a lowered ability to absorb nutrients from food. In milder cases, recovery is 
possible with time. In more extreme cases, death results, often from infection.
Increased Cancer Risk
Lower doses of radiation over extended periods of time can increase cancer risk. Radiation 
increases cancer risk because it can damage DNA, the molecules in cells that carry 
instructions for cell growth and replication. When the DNA within a cell is damaged, the 
cell normally dies. Occasionally, however, changes in DNA cause cells to grow abnormally 
and to become cancerous. These cancerous cells grow into tumors that can spread and, 
in some cases, cause death. Cancer risk increases with increasing radiation exposure. 
However, cancer is so prevalent and has so many convoluted causes that determining an 
exact threshold for increased cancer risk from radiation exposure is difficult.
Genetic Defects
Another possible result of radiation exposure is genetic defects in future generations. 
If radiation damages the DNA of reproductive cells—such as eggs or sperm—then the 
offspring that develop from those cells may have genetic abnormalities. Genetic defects 
of this type have been observed in laboratory animals exposed to high levels of radiation. 
However, such genetic defects—with a clear causal connection to radiation exposure—
have yet to be verified in humans, even in studies of Hiroshima survivors.
Measuring Radiation Exposure and Dose
We can measure radiation exposure in a number of different ways. One method is to 
measure exposure, the number of decay events to which a person is exposed. The unit used 
for this type of exposure measurement is the curie (Ci), defined as 3.7 * 1010 decay events 
per second. A person exposed to a curie of radiation from an alpha emitter is bombarded 
by 3.7 * 1010 alpha particles per second. However, recall that different kinds of radiation 
produce different effects. For example, we know that alpha radiation has a much greater 
ionizing power than beta radiation. Consequently, a certain number of alpha decays 
occurring within a person’s body (due to the ingestion of an alpha emitter) do more damage 
than the same number of beta decays. If the alpha emitter and beta emitter are external to 
the body, however, the radiation from the alpha emitter is largely stopped by clothing or the 
skin (due to the low penetrating power of alpha radiation), whereas the radiation from the 
beta emitter penetrates the skin and causes more damage. Consequently, the curie is not an 
effective measure of how much biological tissue damage the radiation actually does.
A better way to assess radiation exposure is to measure radiation dose, the amount 
of energy actually absorbed by body tissue. The units used for this type of exposure mea-
surement are the gray (Gy), which corresponds to 1 J of energy absorbed per kilogram of 
body tissue, and the rad (for radiation absorbed dose), which ­corresponds to 0.01 Gy:
 1 gray (Gy) = 1 J>kg body tissue
 1 rad = 0.01 J>kg body tissue
Although these units measure the actual energy absorbed by bodily tissues, they 
still do not account for the amount of damage to biological molecules caused by that 
energy absorption, which differs from one type of radiation to another and from one 
type of biological tissue to another. For example, when a gamma ray passes through 
We explain DNA in more detail in 
Chapter 22.

966	
Chapter 20  Radioactivity and Nuclear Chemistry
biological tissue, the energy absorbed is spread out over the long distance that the radi-
ation travels through the body, resulting in a low ionization density within the tissue. 
When an alpha particle passes through biological tissue, in contrast, the energy is 
absorbed over a much shorter distance, resulting in a much higher ionization density. 
The higher ionization density results in greater damage, even though the amount of 
energy absorbed by the tissue might be the same.
Consequently, a correction factor, called the biological effectiveness factor, or 
RBE (for Relative Biological Effectiveness), is usually multiplied by the dose in rads to 
obtain the dose in a unit called the rem for roentgen equivalent man:
Dose in rads * biological effectiveness factor = dose in rems
The biological effectiveness factor for alpha radiation, for example, is much higher than 
that for gamma radiation.
On average, each adult is exposed to approximately 310 mrem of radiation per year 
from natural sources shown in Table 20.4. The majority of this exposure comes from 
radon, one of the products in the uranium decay series. As we can see from Table 20.4, 
however, some medical procedures also involve exposure levels similar to those 
received from natural sources. The increased use of computed tomography (CT) scans 
over the last decade—which have associated exposures of 200–1600 mrem—has raised 
some concerns about the overuse of that technology in medicine.
It takes much more than the average natural radiation dose or the dose from a 
medical diagnostic procedure to produce significant health effects in humans. The 
first measurable effect, a decreased white blood cell count, occurs at instantaneous 
exposures of approximately 20 rem (Table 20.5). Exposures of 100 rem produce a defi-
nite increase in cancer risk, and exposures of over 500 rem often result in death.
A roentgen is defined as the 
amount of radiation that produces 
2.58 * 10-1 C of charge per kg of air.

24 hours of ingestion. Which of the two nuclides produces the greater radiation dose?
	20.12	 Radioactivity in Medicine 
and Other Applications
Radioactivity is often perceived as dangerous; however, it is also 
immensely useful to physicians in the diagnosis and treatment 
of disease and has numerous other valuable applications. The 
use of radioactivity in medicine can be broadly divided into 
diagnostic techniques (which diagnose disease) and therapeutic 
techniques (which treat disease).
Diagnosis in Medicine
The use of radioactivity in diagnosis usually involves a 
radiotracer, a radioactive nuclide attached to a compound 
or introduced into a mixture in order to track the movement of 
the compound or mixture within the body. Tracers are useful 
in the diagnosis of disease because of two main factors: (1) 
the sensitivity with which radioactivity can be detected, and 
(2) the identical chemical behavior of a radioactive nucleus 
and its nonradioactive counterpart. For example, the thyroid 
gland naturally concentrates iodine. When a patient is given 
small amounts of iodine-131 (a radioactive isotope of iodine), 
the radioactive iodine accumulates in the thyroid, just as 
nonradioactive iodine does. However, the radioactive iodine 
emits radiation, which can be detected with great sensitivity and 
used to measure the rate of iodine uptake by the thyroid, and 
thus to image the gland.
Because different radiotracers are taken up preferentially by 
different organs or tissues, various radiotracers are used to monitor metabolic activity and 
image a variety of organs and structures, including the kidneys, heart, brain, gallbladder, 
bones, and arteries, as shown in Table 20.6. Radiotracers can also be employed to locate 
infections or cancers within the body. To locate an infection, antibodies are labeled (or 
tagged) with a radioactive nuclide, such as technetium-99m (where “m” means metasta-
ble), and administered to the patient. The tagged antibodies aggregate at the infected site, 
as described in Section 20.1. ­Cancerous tumors can be detected because they naturally 
concentrate phosphorus. When a patient is given ­phosphorus-32 (a radioactive isotope 
of phosphorus) or a phosphate compound incorporating another radioactive isotope 
such as Tc-99m, the tumors concentrate the radioactive substance and become sources of 
radioactivity that can be detected (Figure 20.17▲).
▲ Figure 20.17  A Bone Scan   
These images, front and rear views 
of the human body, were created 
by the gamma ray emissions of

locate cancer that has metastasized

tumor elsewhere.

▲ Figure 20.18  A PET 
Scan  The colored areas indicate 
regions of high metabolic activity in 
the brain of a schizophrenic patient 
experiencing hallucinations.
A specialized imaging technique known as positron emission tomography 
(PET) employs positron-emitting nuclides, such as fluorine-18, synthesized in cyclo-
trons. The fluorine-18 is attached to a metabolically active substance such as glucose and 
administered to the patient. As the glucose travels through the bloodstream and to the 
heart and brain, it carries the radioactive fluorine, which decays with a half-life of just 
under two hours. When a fluorine-18 nuclide decays, it emits a positron that immedi-
ately combines with any nearby electrons. Since a positron and an electron are antipar-
ticles, they annihilate one other, producing two gamma rays that travel in exactly 
opposing directions. The gamma rays can be detected by an array of detectors that can 
locate the point of origin of the rays with great accuracy. The result is a set of highly 
detailed images that show both the rate of glucose metabolism and structural features of 
the imaged organ (Figure 20.18◀).
Radiotherapy in Medicine
Because radiation kills cells and is particularly effective at killing rapidly dividing 
cells, it is often used as a therapy for cancer (cancer cells reproduce much faster than 
normal cells). Medical technicians focus high-energy photons on internal tumors to 
kill them. The photon beam is usually moved in a circular path around the tumor 
(Figure 20.19▼), maximizing the exposure of the tumor while minimizing the 
exposure of the surrounding healthy tissue. Nonetheless, cancer patients receiving 
such treatment usually develop the symptoms of radiation sickness, which include 
vomiting, skin burns, and hair loss.
▶ Figure 20.19  Radiotherapy 
for Cancer  This treatment involves 
exposing a malignant tumor to 
gamma rays generated by nuclides 
such as cobalt-60. The beam is 
moved in a circular pattern around 
the tumor to maximize exposure 
of the tumor to radiation while 
minimizing the exposure of healthy 
tissues.

You may wonder why radiation—which is known to cause cancer—is also 
used to treat cancer. The answer lies in risk analysis. A cancer patient is normally 
exposed to radiation doses of about 100 rem. Such a dose increases cancer risk by 
about 1%. However, if the patient has a 100% chance of dying from the cancer 
that he already has, such a risk becomes acceptable, especially since there is a sig-
nificant chance of curing the cancer.
Other Applications
Radioactivity is often used to kill microorganisms. For example, physicians 
use radiation to sterilize medical devices that are to be surgically implanted. 
The radiation kills bacteria that might otherwise lead to infection. Similarly, 
radiation is used to kill bacteria and parasites in foods. Like the pasteurization 
of milk, the irradiation of foods makes them safer to consume and gives them a 
longer shelf life (Figure 20.20▶). The irradiation of raw meat and poultry kills 
E. coli and Salmonella, bacteria that can lead to serious illness and even death 
when consumed. The irradiation of food does not, however, make the food 
itself radioactive, nor does it decrease the nutritional value of the food. In the 
United States, the irradiation of many different types of foods—including beef, 
poultry, potatoes, flour, and fruit—has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Radioactivity is also used to control harmful insect populations. For example, 
fruit flies can be raised in large numbers in captivity and sterilized with radiation. 
When these fruit flies are released, they mate with wild fruit flies but do not pro-
duce offspring. The efforts of the wild fruit flies, which might otherwise lead to 
reproduction, are wasted, and the next generation of flies is smaller than it would 
otherwise have been. Similar strategies have been employed to control the popula-
tions of disease-carrying mosquitoes.

Food  Irradiation kills microbes that 
cause food to decay, allowing for longer 
and safer storage. The food is not 
made radioactive, and its properties 
are unchanged in the process. These 
strawberries were picked at the same 
time, but those on the bottom were 
irradiated before storage.

Key Concepts
Diagnosing Appendicitis (20.1)
▶
▶Radioactivity is the emission of subatomic particles or energetic 
electromagnetic radiation by the nuclei of certain atoms.
▶
▶Because some radioactive emissions can pass through matter, 
­radioactivity is useful in medicine and many other areas of study.
The Discovery of Radioactivity (20.2)
▶
▶Radioactivity was discovered by Antoine-Henri Becquerel when 
he found that uranium causes a photographic exposure in the 
­absence of light.
▶
▶Marie Sklodowska Curie later determined that this phenomenon 
was not unique to uranium, and she began calling the rays that 
produced the exposure radioactivity. Curie also discovered two 
new elements, polonium and radium.
Types of Radioactivity (20.3)
▶
▶The major types of natural radioactivity are alpha (a) decay, beta 
(b) decay, gamma (g) ray emission, and positron emission.
▶
▶Alpha radiation is helium nuclei. Beta particles are electrons. 
Gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation of very high energy. 
Positrons are the antiparticles of electrons.

▶
▶A nucleus may absorb one of its orbital electrons in a process called 
electron capture.
▶
▶We can represent each radioactive process with a nuclear equation 
that illustrates how the parent nuclide changes into the daughter 
nuclide. In a nuclear equation, although the specific types of atoms 
may not balance, the atomic numbers and mass numbers must.
▶
▶Each type of radioactivity has a different ionizing and penetrating 
power. These values are inversely related; a particle with a higher 
ionizing power has a lower penetrating power. Alpha particles 
are the most massive and they have the highest ionizing power, 
followed by beta particles and positrons, which are equivalent in 
their ionizing power. Gamma rays have the lowest ionizing power.
The Valley of Stability: Predicting the Type of 
Radioactivity (20.4)
▶
▶The stability of a nucleus, and therefore the probability that it 
will undergo radioactive decay, depends largely on two factors. 
The first is the ratio of neutrons to protons (N>Z) because neu-
trons provide a strong force that overcomes the electromagnetic 
repulsions between the positive protons. This ratio is one for 
smaller elements but becomes greater than one for larger ele-
ments. The second factor related to nuclei stability is a concept 
known as magic numbers; certain numbers of nucleons are more 
stable than others.
Detecting Radioactivity (20.5)
▶
▶Radiation detectors determine the quantity of radioactivity in an 
area or sample.
▶
▶Thermoluminescent dosimeters employ salt crystals for ­detection 
of radiation; such detectors do not provide an instantaneous 
­response.
▶
▶Two detectors that instantly register the amount of radiation 
are the Geiger-Müller counter, which uses the ionization of ar-
gon by radiation to produce an electrical signal, and the scin-
tillation counter, which uses the emission of light induced by 
radiation.
The Kinetics of Radioactive Decay and Radiometric 
Dating (20.6)
▶
▶All radioactive elements decay according to first-order kinetics 
(Chapter 14); the half-life equation and the integrated rate law for 
radioactive decay are derived from the first-order rate laws.
▶
▶The kinetics of radioactive decay is used to date objects and arti-
facts. The age of materials that were once part of living organisms 
is measured by carbon-14 dating. The age of ancient rocks and 
Earth itself is determined by uranium>lead dating.
The Discovery of Fission: The Atomic Bomb and 
Nuclear Power (20.7)
▶
▶Fission is the splitting of an atom, such as uranium-235, into two 
atoms of lesser atomic weight.
▶
▶Because the fission of one uranium-235 atom releases enormous 
amounts of energy and produces neutrons that can split other 
uranium-235 atoms, the energy from these collective reactions 
can be harnessed in an atomic bomb or nuclear reactor.
▶
▶Nuclear power produces no air pollution and requires little mass 
to release lots of energy; however, there is always a danger of ac-
cidents, and it is difficult to dispose of nuclear waste.
Converting Mass to Energy: Mass Defect and 
Nuclear Binding Energy (20.8)
▶
▶In a nuclear fission reaction, mass is converted into energy.
▶
▶The difference in mass between a nuclide and the individual pro-
tons and neutrons that compose it is the mass defect, and the cor-
responding energy, calculated from Einstein’s equation E = mc2, 
is the nuclear binding energy.
▶
▶The stability of a nucleus is determined by the binding energy 
per nucleon, which increases up to mass number 60 and then 
­decreases.
Nuclear Fusion: The Power of the Sun (20.9)
▶
▶Stars produce their energy by the process that is the opposite of fis-
sion: nuclear fusion, the combination of two light nuclei to form 
a heavier one.
▶
▶Modern nuclear weapons employ fusion. Although fusion has 
been examined as a possible method to produce electricity, experi-
ments with hydrogen fusion have thus far been more costly than 
productive.
Nuclear Transmutation and Transuranium Elements 
(20.10)
▶
▶Nuclear transmutation, the changing of one element to another 
element, was used to create the transuranium elements, elements 
with atomic numbers greater than that of uranium.
▶
▶Two devices are most commonly used to accelerate particles to the 
high speeds necessary for transmutation reactions: the linear ac-
celerator and the cyclotron. Both use alternating voltage to propel 
particles by electromagnetic forces.
The Effects of Radiation on Life (20.11)
▶
▶The effects of radiation can be grouped into three categories. 
Acute radiation damage is caused by a large exposure to radiation 
for a short period of time. Lower radiation exposures may result in 
increased cancer risk because of damage to DNA. Genetic defects 
are caused by damage to the DNA of reproductive cells.
▶
▶The most effective unit of measurement for the amount of radia-
tion absorbed is the rem, which takes into account the different 
penetrating and ionizing powers of the various types of radiation.
Radioactivity in Medicine (20.12)
▶
▶Radioactivity is central to the diagnosis of medical problems by 
means of radiotracers and positron emission tomography (PET). 
Both of these techniques can provide data about the appearance 
and metabolic activity of an organ, or help locate a tumor.
▶
▶Radiation is also used to treat cancer because it kills cells. 
­Radiation can kill bacteria in foods and control harmful insect 
populations.

rganic chemistry is the study of carbon-containing compounds. Carbon is 
unique in the sheer number of compounds that it forms. Millions of organic 
compounds are known, and researchers discover new ones every day. Carbon is 
also unique in the diversity of compounds that it forms. In most cases, a fixed number of 
carbon atoms can combine with a fixed number of atoms of another element to form 
many different compounds. For example, 10 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms form 
75 distinctly different compounds. With carbon as the backbone, nature is able to take 
the same combination of atoms and bond them together in slightly different ways to 
produce a huge variety of substances. It is not surprising that life is based on the chem-
istry of carbon because life needs diversity to exist, and organic chemistry is nothing if 
not diverse. In this chapter, we peer into Friedrich Wöhler’s “primeval tropical forest” 
(see chapter-opening quotation) and discover the most remarkable things.
	 21.1	 Fragrances and Odors
Have you ever ridden an elevator with someone wearing too much perfume? Or found 
yourself too close to a skunk? Or caught a whiff of rotting fish? What causes these fragrances 
and odors? When we inhale certain molecules called odorants, they bind with olfactory 
receptors in our noses. This interaction sends a nerve signal to the brain that we experience 
as a smell. Some smells, such as that of perfume, are pleasant (when not overdone). Other 
smells, such as that of the skunk or rotting fish, are unpleasant. Our sense of smell helps us 
identify food, people, and other organisms, and it alerts us to dangers such as polluted air or 
spoiled food. Smell (olfaction) is one way we probe the environment around us.

980	
Chapter 21  Organic Chemistry
Odorants, if they are to reach our noses, must be volatile. However, many volatile sub-
stances have no scent at all. Nitrogen, oxygen, water, and carbon dioxide molecules, for 
example, are constantly passing through our noses, yet they produce no smell because they 
do not bind to olfactory receptors. Most common smells are caused by organic molecules, 
molecules containing carbon combined with several other elements, such as hydrogen, 
nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Organic molecules are responsible for the smells of roses, 
vanilla, cinnamon, almond, jasmine, body odor, and rotting fish. When you wander into a 
rose garden, you experience the sweet smell caused in part by geraniol, an organic compound 
emitted by roses. Men’s colognes often contain patchouli alcohol, an earthy-smelling 
organic compound extracted from the patchouli plant. If you have been in the vicinity of 
skunk spray (or have been unfortunate enough to be sprayed yourself), you are familiar with 
the unpleasant smell of 2-butene-1-thiol and 3-methyl-1-butanethiol, two particularly odor-
iferous compounds present in the secretion that skunks use to defend themselves.
The study of compounds containing carbon combined with one or more of the ele-
ments mentioned previously (hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur), including their 
properties and their reactions, is organic chemistry. Besides composing much of 
what we smell, organic compounds are prevalent in foods, drugs, petroleum products, 
and pesticides. Organic chemistry is also the basis for living organisms. Life has evolved 
based on carbon-containing compounds, making organic chemistry of utmost impor-
tance to any person interested in understanding living organisms.
	 21.2	 Carbon: Why It Is Unique
Why did life evolve based on the chemistry of carbon? Why is life not based on some 
other element? The answer may not be simple, but we do know that life—in order to 
exist—must entail complexity, and carbon chemistry is clearly complex. The number of 
compounds containing carbon is greater than the number of compounds containing all 
of the other elements combined. The reasons for carbon’s unique and versatile behavior 
include its ability to form four covalent bonds, its ability to form double and triple 
bonds, and its tendency to catenate (that is, to form chains).
Carbon’s Tendency to Form Four Covalent Bonds
Carbon—with its four valence electrons—forms four covalent bonds. Consider the Lewis 
structure and space-filling models of two simple carbon compounds, methane and ethane:
CH3
CH3CHCH2CH2SH
3-Methyl-1-butanethiol
CHCH2SH
CH3CH
2-Butene-1-thiol

primarily to the molecules shown 
here.

The geometry about a carbon atom forming four single bonds is tetrahedral, as 
shown in the figure for methane. Carbon’s ability to form four bonds, and to form those 
bonds with a number of different elements, results in the potential to form many differ-
ent compounds. As you learn to draw structures for organic compounds, always remem-
ber to draw carbon with four bonds.
Carbon’s Ability to Form Double and Triple Bonds
Carbon atoms also form double bonds (trigonal planar geometry) and triple bonds 
(linear geometry), adding even more diversity to the number of compounds that carbon 
forms. Consider the Lewis structure and space-filling models of the carbon compounds 
ethene and ethyne:

Vitalism and the Perceived Differences between  
Organic and Inorganic Compounds
B
y the end of the eighteenth century, chemists had 
learned that compounds could be broadly categorized as 
either organic or inorganic. Organic compounds come from 
living things, whereas inorganic compounds come from the 
nonliving things on Earth. Sugar—obtained from sugarcane 
or the sugar beet—is a common example of an organic com-
pound. Salt—mined from the ground or extracted from ocean 
water—is a common example of an inorganic compound.
Organic and inorganic compounds are different, not only 
in their origin, but also in their properties. Organic compounds 
are easily decomposed. Sugar, for example, readily decom-
poses into carbon and water when heated. (Think of the last 
time you burned something sugary in a pan or in the oven.) 
Inorganic compounds are more difficult to decompose. Salt 
decomposes only when heated to very high temperatures.
Even more curious to these early chemists was their in-
ability to synthesize a single organic compound in the labora-
tory. Although they were able to synthesize many inorganic 
compounds, despite concerted efforts, they were not able to 
synthesize any organic compounds.
The origin and properties of organic compounds led early 
chemists to postulate that organic compounds were unique 
to living organisms. They hypothesized that living organisms 
contained a vital force—a mystical or supernatural power—
that allowed them to produce organic compounds. They 
thought that producing an organic compound outside of a liv-
ing organism was impossible because the vital force was not 
present. This belief—which became known as vitalism—­
explained why no chemist had succeeded in synthesizing an 
organic compound in the laboratory.
An experiment performed in 1828 by German chemist 
Friedrich Wöhler (1800–1882) marked the beginning of the 
end of vitalism. Wöhler heated ammonium cyanate (an inor-
ganic compound) and formed urea (an organic compound):
Nh4OcN ¡
heat h2NcONh2
	
ammonium cyanate	
urea
Urea was a known organic compound that had previous-
ly been isolated only from urine. Although it was not real-
ized at the time, Wöhler’s simple experiment was a key 
step in opening all of life to scientific investigation. He 
showed that the compounds composing living organisms—
like all compounds—­follow scientific laws and can be stud-
ied and understood. 
Today, known organic com-
pounds number in the mil-
lions, and modern organic 
chemistry is a vast field 
that produces substances 
as diverse as drugs, pe-
troleum products, and 
plastics.

In contrast, silicon (the element in the periodic table with properties closest to that 
of carbon) does not readily form double or triple bonds because the greater size of silicon 
atoms results in a Si ¬ Si bond that is too long for much overlap between nonhybridized 
p orbitals.
Carbon’s Tendency to Catenate
Carbon, more than any other element, can bond to itself to form chain, branched, and 
ring structures as we can see in propane, isobutane, and cyclohexane:

Although other elements can form chains, none surpasses carbon at this ability. Sil-
icon, for example, can form chains with itself. However, silicon’s affinity for oxygen (the 
Si ¬ O bond is stronger than the Si ¬ Si bond) coupled with the prevalence of oxygen in 
Chemistry IN YOUR DAY | 

982	
Chapter 21  Organic Chemistry
our atmosphere means that silicon–silicon chains are readily oxidized to form silicates 
(the silicon–oxygen compounds that compose a significant proportion of minerals). By 
contrast, the C¬ C bond (347 kJ>mol) and the C¬ O bond (359 kJ>mol) are nearly the 
same strength, allowing carbon chains to exist relatively peacefully in an oxygen-rich 
environment. Silicon’s affinity for oxygen robs it of the rich diversity that catenation 
provides to carbon.
	 21.3	 Hydrocarbons: Compounds Containing 
Only Carbon and Hydrogen
Hydrocarbons—compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen—are the simplest 
organic compounds. However, because of the uniqueness of carbon, many different kinds 
of hydrocarbons exist. We use hydrocarbons as fuels. Candle wax, oil, gasoline, liquid 
petroleum (LP) gas, and natural gas are all composed of hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons 
are also the starting materials in the synthesis of many different consumer products, 
including fabrics, soaps, dyes, cosmetics, drugs, plastic, and rubber.
As shown in Figure 21.1▼, we classify hydrocarbons into four different types: alkanes, 
alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. We differentiate alkanes, alkenes, 
and alkynes—also called aliphatic hydrocarbons—based on the kinds of bonds 
between carbon atoms. (We discuss aromatic hydrocarbons in detail in Section 21.7.) As 
Table 21.1 illustrates, alkanes have only single bonds between carbon atoms, alkenes have a 
double bond, and alkynes have a triple bond.

Drawing Hydrocarbon Structures
Throughout this book, we have relied primarily on molecular formulas as the simplest 
way to represent compounds. In organic chemistry molecular formulas are insufficient 
because, as we have already discussed, the same atoms can bond together in different ways 
to form different compounds. For example, consider an alkane with four carbon atoms and 
10 hydrogen atoms. Two different structures, named butane and isobutane, are possible:

Isobutane
Butane and isobutane are structural isomers, molecules with the same molecular 
formula but different structures. Because of their different structures, they have different 
properties—indeed, they are different compounds. Isomerism is ubiquitous in organic 
chemistry. Butane has two structural isomers. Pentane (C5H12) has three, hexane (C6H14) 
has five, and decane (C10H22) has 75!
We represent the structure of a particular hydrocarbon with a structural formula, 
a formula that shows not only the numbers of each kind of atoms, but also how the 
atoms are bonded. Organic chemists use several different kinds of structural formulas. 
For example, we can represent butane and isobutane in each of the following ways:

The structural formula shows all of the carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule 
and how they are bonded. The condensed structural formula groups the hydrogen atoms 
with the carbon atom to which they are bonded. Condensed structural formulas may 
show some of the bonds (as the previous examples do) or none at all. We can also write 
the condensed structural formula for butane as CH3CH2CH2CH3. The carbon skeleton for-
mula (also called a line formula) shows the carbon–carbon bonds only as lines. Each end 
or bend of a line represents a carbon atom bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as neces-
sary to form a total of four bonds. Carbon skeleton formulas allow us to draw complex 
structures quickly.
Note that structural formulas are generally not three-­
dimensional representations of molecules—as space-filling or ball-
and-stick models are—but rather two-dimensional representations 
that show how atoms are bonded together. As such, the most 
important feature of a structural formula is the connectivity of the 
atoms, not the exact way the formula is drawn. For example, con-
sider the two condensed structural formulas for butane and the cor-
responding space-filling models below them as shown on the right.
A carbon skeleton formula is called a 
line formula because it uses lines to 
represent a molecule.

Since rotation about single bonds is relatively unhindered at room temperature, the two 
structural formulas are identical, even though they are drawn differently.
We represent double and triple bonds in structural formulas with double or triple 
lines. For example, we draw the structural formulas for C3H6 (propene) and C3H4 
­(propyne) as follows:

Stereoisomerism and Optical Isomerism
Stereoisomers are molecules in which the atoms have the same connectivity but a 
different spatial arrangement. We categorize stereoisomers into two types: geometric 
(or cis–trans) isomers and optical isomers. We discuss geometric isomers in Section 21.5. 
Optical isomers are two molecules that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of one 
another. Consider the molecule shown here with its mirror image:
Molecule
Mirror image
 

986	
Chapter 21  Organic Chemistry
The molecule cannot be superimposed onto its mirror image. If we swing the mirror 
image around to try to superimpose the two, we find that there is no way to get all four 
substituent atoms to align together. (A substituent is an atom or group of atoms that is 
substituted for a hydrogen atom in an organic compound.)
Molecule
Mirror image
The mirror image is
not superimposable
on original molecule.
Optical isomers are similar to your right and left hands (Figure 21.2◀). The two are 
mirror images of one another, but you cannot superimpose one on the other. For this 
reason, a right-handed glove does not fit on your left hand and vice versa.
Any carbon atom with four different substituents in a tetrahedral arrangement 
exhibits optical isomerism. Consider 3-methylhexane:

The molecules shown here are nonsuperimposable mirror images and are optical 
isomers of one other.
Optical isomers are also called enantiomers. Any molecule, such as 3-methylhex-
ane, that exhibits optical isomerism is said to be chiral, from the Greek word cheir, 
which means “hand.” Optical isomerism is important, not only to organic chemistry, 
but also to biology and biochemistry. Most biological molecules are chiral and usually 
only one or the other enantiomer is active in biological systems. For example, glucose, 
the primary fuel of cells, is chiral. Only one of the enantiomers of glucose has that famil-
iar sweet taste, and only that enantiomer can fuel cellular functioning; the other enan-
tiomer is not even metabolized by the body.
Some of the physical and chemical properties of enantiomers are indistinguishable 
from one another. For example, both of the optical isomers of 3-methylhexane have 
identical freezing points, melting points, and densities. However, the properties of enan-
tiomers differ from one another in two important ways: (1) in the direction in which 
they rotate polarized light and (2) in their chemical behavior in a chiral environment.
Rotation of Polarized Light
Plane-polarized light is light that is made up of electric field waves that oscillate in only 
one plane as shown in Figure 21.3▶. When a beam of plane-polarized light is directed 
through a sample containing only one of two optical isomers, the plane of polarization 
of the light is rotated as shown in Figure 21.4▶. One of the two optical isomers rotates 
the polarization of the light clockwise and is the dextrorotatory isomer (or the d 
isomer). The other isomer rotates the polarization of the light counterclockwise and 
is the levorotatory isomer (or the l isomer). An equimolar mixture of both optical 
isomers does not rotate the polarization of light at all and is called a racemic mixture.
C

▲ Figure 21.2  Mirror Images   
The left and right hands are 
nonsuperimposable mirror images, 
just as are optical isomers.
Dextrorotatory means turning 
clockwise or to the right. Levorotatory 
means turning counterclockwise or to 
the left.

Chemical Behavior in a Chiral Environment
Optical isomers also exhibit different chemical behavior when they are in a chiral 
environment (a chiral environment is one that is not superimposable on its mirror 
image). Enzymes are large biological molecules that catalyze reactions in living 
organisms and provide chiral environments. Consider the following simplified picture 
of two enantiomers in a chiral environment:
Carbon
atoms
Enantiomer ﬁts.
Enantiomer does not ﬁt.
One of the enantiomers fits the template, but the other does not, no matter how it is 
rotated. In this way, an enzyme is able to catalyze the reaction of one enantiomer 
because that particular enantiomer fits the “template.” As we have already seen, most 
biological molecules are chiral, and usually only one or the other enantiomer is active in 
biological systems.

	 21.4	 Alkanes: Saturated Hydrocarbons
Alkanes (hydrocarbons containing only single bonds) are often referred to as saturated 
hydrocarbons because they are saturated (loaded to capacity) with hydrogen. The 
simplest hydrocarbons are methane (CH4), the main component of natural gas; ethane 
(C2H6), a minority component in natural gas; and propane (C3H8), the main component 
of LP gas:

Alkanes containing four or more carbon atoms may be straight or branched (as we 
have already seen). The straight-chain isomers are often called normal alkanes, or 
n-alkanes. As the number of carbon atoms increases in the n-alkanes, so does their boil-
ing point (as shown in Table 21.2). The increase is due to the increasing dispersion 
force with increasing molar mass (see Section 11.3). Methane, ethane, propane, and 
n-butane are all gases at room temperature, but the next n-alkane in the series, pen-
tane, is a liquid at room temperature. Pentane is a component of gasoline. Table 21.3 
summarizes the n-alkanes through decane, which contains 10 carbon atoms. Like pen-
tane, hexane through decane are all components of gasoline. Table 21.4 summarizes 
the uses of hydrocarbons.

Naming Alkanes
Many organic compounds have common names that we can learn only through 
familiarity. Because of the sheer number of organic compounds, however, we need a 
systematic method of nomenclature. In this book, we adopt the nomenclature system 
recommended by the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry), 
which is used throughout the world. In this system, the longest continuous chain of 
carbon atoms—called the base chain—determines the base name of the compound. 
The root of the base name depends on the number of carbon atoms in the base chain, 
as shown in Table 21.5. Base names for alkanes always have the ending -ane. Groups 
of carbon atoms branching off the base chain are alkyl groups and are named as 
substituents. Remember that a substituent is an atom or group of atoms that has been 
substituted for a hydrogen atom in an organic compound. Common alkyl groups are 
shown in Table 21.6.

	 21.5	 Alkenes and Alkynes
Alkenes are hydrocarbons containing at least one double bond between carbon atoms. 
Alkynes contain at least one triple bond. Because of the double or triple bond, alkenes 
and alkynes have fewer hydrogen atoms than the corresponding alkanes and are therefore 
called unsaturated hydrocarbons because they are not loaded to capacity with 
hydrogen. Recall that noncyclic alkenes have the formula CnH2n and noncyclic alkynes 
have the formula CnH2n - 2. The simplest alkene is ethene (C2H4), also called ethylene:

Ethene or

Formula
Structural formula
Space-filling model
C2H4
The geometry about each carbon atom in ethene is trigonal planar (see Example 
10.8 for the valence bond model of ethene), making ethene a flat, rigid molecule. Ethene 
is a ripening agent in fruit such as bananas. When a banana within a cluster of bananas 
begins to ripen, it emits ethene. The ethene then causes other bananas in the cluster to 
ripen. Banana farmers usually pick bananas green for ease of shipping. When the 
bananas arrive at their destination, the fruit is often “gassed” with ethene to initiate rip-
ening. Table 21.7 lists the names and structures of several other alkenes. Most of them do 
not have familiar uses except their presence as minority components in fuels.
The general formulas shown here for 
alkenes and alkynes assume only one 
multiple bond.

cule. Ethyne (or acetylene) is commonly used as fuel for welding torches. Table 21.8 
shows the names and structures of several other alkynes. Like alkenes, the alkynes do 
not have familiar uses other than their presence as minority components of gasoline.
Naming Alkenes and Alkynes
We name alkenes and alkynes in the same way we name alkanes with the following 
exceptions:
• The base chain is the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the double or 
­triple bond.
• The base name has the ending -ene for alkenes and -yne for alkynes.
• We number the base chain to give the double or triple bond the lowest possible 
number.
• We insert a number indicating the position of the double or triple bond (lowest 
possible number) just before the base name.
▲ Welding torches burn ethyne in 
pure oxygen to produce the very hot 
flame needed for melting metals.

Geometric (Cis–Trans) Isomerism in Alkenes
A major difference between a single bond and a double bond is the degree to which 
rotation occurs about the bond. As discussed in Section 10.7, rotation about a double 
bond is highly restricted due to the overlap between unhybridized p orbitals on the 
adjacent carbon atoms.
Consider the difference between 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dichloroethene:
Cl

The hybridization of the carbon atoms in 1,2-dichloroethane is sp3, resulting in rela-
tively free rotation about the sigma single bond. Consequently, the two structures are 
identical at room temperature because they quickly interconvert:

In contrast, rotation about the double bond (sigma + pi) in 1,2-dichloroethene is 
restricted, so at room temperature, 1,2-dichloroethene exists in two isomeric forms:

These two forms of 1,2-dichloroethene are different compounds with different 
properties as shown in Table 21.9. This kind of isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism 
(see Section 21.3) called geometric (or cis–trans) isomerism. We distinguish 
between the two isomers with the designations cis (meaning “same side”) and trans 
(meaning “opposite sides”). Cis–trans isomerism is common in alkenes. As another 
example, consider cis- and trans-2-butene. Like the two isomers of 1,2-dichloroethene, 
these two isomers have different physical properties. For example, cis-2-butene boils at 
3.7 °C, and trans-2-butene boils at 0.9 °C:

	 21.6	 Hydrocarbon Reactions
One of the most common hydrocarbon reactions is combustion, the burning of 
hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen. Hydrocarbon combustion reactions are highly 
exothermic and are commonly used to warm homes and buildings, to generate electricity, 
and to power the engines of cars, ships, and airplanes. It is not an exaggeration to say 
that hydrocarbon combustion makes our current way of life possible. Approximately 
90% of energy produced in the United States is generated by hydrocarbon combustion.
Alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes all undergo combustion. In a combustion reaction, 
the hydrocarbon reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water:
 CH3CH2CH3(g) + 5 O2(g) ¡ 3 CO2(g) + 4 H2O(g) 
 Alkane combustion
 CH2“ CHCH2CH3(g) +  6 O2(g) ¡ 4 CO2(g) + 4 H2O(g)    Alkene combustion
 CH ‚ CCH3(g) + 4 O2(g) ¡ 3 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g) 
 Alkyne combustion
Reactions of Alkanes
In addition to combustion reactions, alkanes also undergo substitution reactions, in 
which one or more hydrogen atoms on an alkane are replaced by one or more other 
atoms. The most common substitution reaction is halogen substitution (also referred to 
as halogenation). For example, methane can react with chlorine gas in the presence of 
heat or light to form chloromethane:
CH4(g) + Cl2(g) ˚˚˚˚˚
 
 "

 CH3Cl(g) + HCl(g)

 "

 CH3CH2Cl(g) + HCl(g)
	
Ethane	
Chlorine	
Chloromethane
Multiple halogenation reactions can occur because halogens can replace more than 
one of the hydrogen atoms on an alkane. For example, chloromethane can react with 
chlorine, and the product of that reaction can react again (and so on):
 CH3Cl(g) + Cl2(g) ˚˚˚˚˚

Notice that the halogenation of hydrocarbons requires initiation with heat or light,

 "

 Cl # + Cl #
The resulting chlorine atoms are free radicals (see Section 9.9), as the dot that repre-
sents each chlorine atom’s unpaired electron indicates. Chlorine radicals are highly 
reactive and attack the C¬ H bond in hydrocarbons. The subsequent reaction proceeds 
by this mechanism:
 Cl # + R¬ H ¡ R # + HCl
 R # + Cl2 ¡ R¬ Cl + Cl #
Notice that a chlorine free radical is produced as a product of the last step. This free radi-
cal can go on to react again, unless it encounters another chlorine free radical, in which 
case it reacts with it to re-form Cl2.
Reactions of Alkenes and Alkynes
Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions in which molecules add across (on 
either side of) the multiple bond. For example, ethene reacts with chlorine gas to form 
dichloroethane:

The addition of chlorine converts the carbon–carbon double bond into a single bond 
because each carbon atom bonds to a chlorine atom.
Alkenes and alkynes can also add hydrogen in hydrogenation reactions. For exam-
ple, in the presence of an appropriate catalyst, propene reacts with hydrogen gas to form 
propane:

Hydrogenation reactions convert unsaturated hydrocarbons into saturated hydro-
carbons. For example, hydrogenation reactions convert unsaturated vegetable oils into 
saturated fats. Most vegetable oils are unsaturated because their carbon chains contain 
double bonds. The double bonds put bends into the carbon chains that result in less effi-
cient packing of molecules; thus vegetable oils are liquids at room temperature, while 
saturated fats are solids at room temperature. When food manufacturers add hydrogen 
to the double bonds of vegetable oil, the unsaturated fat is converted into a saturated fat, 
turning the liquid oil into a solid at room temperature. The words “partially hydroge-
nated vegetable oil” on a label indicate a food product that contains saturated fats made 
via hydrogenation reactions.
Alkenes can also add unsymmetrical reagents across the double bond. For example, 
ethene reacts with hydrogen chloride to form chloroethane:

oil is a saturated fat that is made by 
hydrogenating unsaturated fats.

	
21.6  Hydrocarbon Reactions

If the alkene itself is also unsymmetrical, then the addition of an unsymmetrical reagent 
leads to the potential for two different products. For example, when HCl reacts with pro-
pene, two products are possible:

When this reaction is carried out in the lab, however, only the 2-chloropropane 
forms. We can predict the product of the addition of an unsymmetrical reagent to an 
unsymmetrical alkene with Markovnikov’s rule, which states the following:
When a polar reagent is added to an unsymmetrical alkene, the 
positive end (the least electronegative part) of the reagent adds to 
the carbon atom that has the most hydrogen atoms.
In most reactions of this type, the positive end of the reagent is hydrogen; therefore, the 
hydrogen atom bonds to the carbon atom that already contains the most hydrogen atoms.

	 21.7	 Aromatic Hydrocarbons
As you might imagine, determining the structure of organic compounds has not always 
been easy. During the mid-1800s chemists were working to determine the structure of a 
particularly stable organic compound named benzene (C6H6). In 1865, Friedrich August 
Kekulé (1829–1896) had a dream in which he envisioned chains of carbon atoms as 
snakes. The snakes danced before him, and one of them twisted around and bit its tail. 
Based on that vision, Kekulé proposed the following structure for benzene:
C
H
H
C
C
H
C
H
C

H

This structure has alternating single and double bonds. When we examine the 
­carbon–carbon bond lengths in benzene, however, we find that all the bonds are the 
same length, which indicates that the following resonance structures are a more accu-
rate representation of benzene:

The true structure of benzene is a hybrid of the two resonance structures. We often 
represent benzene with the following carbon skeletal formula (or line formula):
The ring represents the delocalized p electrons that occupy the molecular orbital shown 
superimposed on the ball-and-stick model. When drawing benzene rings, either by 
themselves or as parts of other compounds, organic chemists use either this diagram or 
just one of the resonance structures with alternating double bonds. Both representa-
tions indicate the same thing—a benzene ring.
The benzene ring structure occurs in many organic compounds. An atom or group of 
atoms can be substituted for one or more of the six hydrogen atoms on the ring to form 
compounds referred to as substituted benzenes, such as chlorobenzene and phenol:
	
Cl
Chlorobenzene
	
OH
Phenol
Because many compounds containing benzene rings have pleasant aromas, ben-
zene rings are also called aromatic rings, and compounds containing them are called aro-
matic compounds. Aromatic compounds are responsible for the pleasant smells of 
cinnamon, vanilla, and jasmine.
Naming Aromatic Hydrocarbons
Monosubstituted benzenes—benzenes in which only one of the hydrogen atoms has 
been substituted—are often named as derivatives of benzene:
	
CH2
CH3
Ethylbenzene
	
Br
Bromobenzene
Recall from Section 9.8 that the  
actual structure of a molecule 
represented by resonance structures 
is intermediate between the two 
resonance structures and is called a 
resonance hybrid.

	
21.7  Aromatic Hydrocarbons	
1001
These names take the general form:
(name of substituent)benzene
However, many monosubstituted benzenes have names that can only be learned 
through familiarity. Some common ones are shown here:
CH3
Toluene
	
NH2
Aniline
	
OH
Phenol
	
CH
CH2
Styrene
Some substituted benzenes, especially those with large substituents, are named by 
­treating the benzene ring as the substituent. In these cases, the benzene substituent is 
referred to as a phenyl group:

Disubstituted benzenes—benzenes in which two hydrogen atoms have been 
substituted—are numbered, and the substituents are listed alphabetically. We determine 
the order of numbering on the ring by the alphabetical order of the substituents:
	
Cl
CH2

1,3-Dichlorobenzene
	
Cl

Also in common use, in place of numbering, are the prefixes ortho (1,2 disubstituted),

Compounds containing fused aromatic rings are called polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbons. Some common examples (shown in Figure 21.5▶, on the next page) include 
naphthalene, the substance that composes mothballs, and pyrene, a carcinogen found 
in cigarette smoke.

Reactions of Aromatic Compounds
We might expect benzene to react similarly to the alkenes, readily undergoing addition 
reactions across its double bonds. However, because of electron delocalization around 
the ring and the resulting greater stability, benzene does not typically undergo addition 
reactions. Instead, benzene undergoes substitution reactions in which the hydrogen 
atoms are replaced by other atoms or groups of atoms as shown in the following examples:

21.8  Functional Groups	
1003
	 21.8	 Functional Groups
Most other families of organic compounds are hydrocarbons with a functional group—a 
characteristic atom or group of atoms—inserted into the hydrocarbon. A group of 
organic compounds that all have the same functional group is a family. For example, 
the members of the family of alcohols each have an ¬ OH functional group and the 
general formula R¬ OH, where R represents a hydrocarbon group. (That is, we refer to 
the hydrocarbon group as an “R group.”) Some specific examples include methanol and 
isopropyl alcohol (also known as rubbing alcohol):

The presence of a functional group in a hydrocarbon alters the properties of the com-
pound significantly. For example, methane is a nonpolar gas. By contrast, methanol—
methane with an ¬ OH group substituted for one of the hydrogen atoms—is a polar, 
hydrogen-bonded liquid at room temperature. Although each member of a family is 
unique and different, their common functional group causes some similarities in both 
their physical and chemical properties. Table 21.10 lists some common functional groups, 
their general formulas, and an example of each.

	 21.9	 Alcohols
As we discussed in Section 21.8, alcohols are organic compounds containing the ¬ OH 
functional group, or hydroxyl group, and they have the general formula R¬ OH. In 
addition to methanol and isopropyl alcohol, ethanol and 1-butanol (shown here) are 
also common alcohols:

Naming Alcohols
The names of alcohols are like the names of alkanes with the following differences:
• The base chain is the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the ¬ OH 
functional group.
• The base name has the ending -ol.
• We number the base chain to assign the ¬ OH group the lowest possible number.
• We insert a number indicating the position of the ¬ OH group just before the base 
name. For example:
	
CH3CH2CH2CHCH3
OH
2-Pentanol
	
CH2

About Alcohols
The familiar alcohol in alcoholic beverages, ethanol, is most commonly formed by the 
yeast fermentation of sugars, such as glucose, from fruits and grains:
C6H12O6 ¡
yeast 2 CH3CH2OH + 2 CO2
	
Glucose	
Ethanol
Alcoholic beverages contain ethanol, water, and a few other components that impart 
flavor and color. Beer usually contains 3–6% ethanol. Wine contains about 12–14% etha-
nol, and spirits—beverages like whiskey, rum, or tequila—range from 40% to 80% etha-
nol, depending on their proof. The proof of an alcoholic beverage is twice the percentage 
of its ethanol content, so an 80-proof whiskey contains 40% ethanol. Ethanol is used as 
a gasoline additive because it increases the octane rating of gasoline and fosters its com-
plete combustion, reducing the levels of certain pollutants such as carbon monoxide 
and the precursors of ozone.
Isopropyl alcohol (or 2-propanol) is available at any drugstore under the name of rub-
bing alcohol. It is commonly used as a disinfectant for wounds and to sterilize medical 
instruments. Isopropyl alcohol should never be consumed internally, as it is highly toxic. 
Four ounces of isopropyl alcohol can cause death. A third common alcohol is methanol, 
also called wood alcohol. Methanol is commonly used as a laboratory solvent and as a fuel 
additive. Like isopropyl alcohol, methanol is toxic and should never be consumed.
Alcohol Reactions
Alcohols undergo a number of reactions including substitution, elimination (or 
dehydration), and oxidation. Alcohols also react with active metals to form strong bases.

	
21.9  Alcohols	
1005
Substitution
Alcohols react with acids such as HBr to form halogenated hydrocarbons:
ROH + HBr ¡ R¬ Br + H2O
In these reactions, the halogen replaces the hydroxyl group on the alcohol. For example, 
ethanol reacts with hydrobromic acid to form bromoethane and water:
CH3CH2OH + HBr ¡ CH3CH2Br + H2O
Elimination (or Dehydration)
In the presence of concentrated acids such as H2SO4, alcohols react and eliminate water, 
forming an alkene. For example, ethanol eliminates water to form ethene according to 
the reaction:
CH2

Oxidation
In organic chemistry, we think of oxidation and reduction in terms of the changes to the 
carbon atoms in the molecule. Thus, oxidation is the gaining of oxygen or the losing of 
hydrogen by a carbon atom. Reduction is the loss of oxygen or the gaining of hydrogen 
by a carbon atom. We can draw a series showing relative states of oxidation:

Reduction
Oxidation
In this view, an alcohol is a partially oxidized hydrocarbon; it can be further oxidized to 
form an aldehyde or carboxylic acid, or it can be reduced to form a hydrocarbon (but this 
is rare). For example, ethanol can be oxidized to acetic acid according to the reaction:
CH3CH2OH ˚˚˚˚˚
 
 "
Na2Cr2O7
H2SO4
 CH3COOH
Reaction with Active Metals
Alcohols react with active metals, such as sodium, much as water does. For example, 
methanol reacts with sodium to form sodium methoxide and hydrogen gas:
CH3OH + Na ¡ CH3ONa + 1
2H2
Sodium methoxide
The reaction of water with sodium produces sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas:
H2O + Na ¡ NaOH + 1
2H2
In both cases, a strong base forms (OH- for water and CH3O- for methanol).

Naming Aldehydes and Ketones
Many aldehydes and ketones have common names that we can learn only by becoming 
familiar with them, but we can systematically name simple aldehydes according to the 
number of carbon atoms in the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the 
carbonyl group. We form the base name from the name of the corresponding alkane by 
dropping the -e and adding the ending –al:

About Aldehydes and Ketones
The most familiar aldehyde is probably formaldehyde, shown earlier in this section. 
Formaldehyde is a gas with a pungent odor. It is often mixed with water to make formalin, 
a preservative and disinfectant. Formaldehyde is also found in wood smoke, which is 
one reason that smoking is an effective method of food preservation—the formaldehyde 
kills bacteria. Aromatic aldehydes, those that also contain an aromatic ring, have 
pleasant aromas. For example, vanillin causes the smell of vanilla, cinnamaldehyde is 
the sweet-smelling component of cinnamon, and benzaldehyde accounts for the smell 
of almonds (Figure 21.7▼):

The carbonyl group in aldehydes and ketones is unsaturated, much like the double 
bond in an alkene. Because of this feature, the most common reactions of aldehydes and 
ketones are addition reactions. However, in contrast to the carbon–carbon double 
bond in alkenes, which is nonpolar, the double bond in the carbonyl group is highly 
polar (Figure 21.9▶). Consequently, additions across the double bond result in the more 
electronegative part of the reagent bonding to the carbon atom and the less electronega-
tive part (often hydrogen) bonding to the oxygen atom. For example, HCN adds across 
the carbonyl double bond in formaldehyde:

Figure 21.10▶ shows the structures of some common carboxylic acids and esters.
Naming Carboxylic Acids and Esters
We systematically name carboxylic acids according to the number of carbon atoms in 
the longest chain containing the ¬ COOH functional group. We form the base name 
by dropping the -e from the name of the corresponding alkane and adding the ending 
-oic acid:

We name esters as if they were derived from a carboxylic acid by replacing the H on 
the OH with an alkyl group. The R group from the parent acid forms the base name of 
the compound. We change the -ic on the name of the corresponding carboxylic acid to 
-ate, and drop acid, naming the R group that replaced the H on the carboxylic acid as an 
alkyl group with the ending -yl, as shown in the following examples:

About Carboxylic Acids and Esters
Like all acids, carboxylic acids taste sour. The most familiar carboxylic acid is ethanoic 
acid, better known by its common name, acetic acid. Acetic acid is the active ingredient 
in vinegar. It can form by the oxidation of ethanol, which is why wines left open to 
air become sour. Some yeasts and bacteria also form acetic acid when they metabolize 
sugars in bread dough. These are added to bread dough to make sourdough bread. 
Other common carboxylic acids include methanoic acid (formic acid), present in bee

Carboxylic Acid and Ester Reactions
Carboxylic acids act as weak acids in solution:
RCOOH(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H3O+(aq) + RCOO-(aq)
Like all acids, carboxylic acids react with strong bases via neutralization reactions. For 
example, propanoic acid reacts with sodium hydroxide to form sodium propanoate and 
water:
CH3CH2COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) ¡ CH3CH2COO-Na+(aq) + HOH(l)
A carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester via a condensation reac-
tion, a reaction in which two (or more) organic compounds join, often with the loss of 
water (or some other small molecule):

If the two R groups differ, we use each of their names in alphabetical order. If the 
two R groups are the same, we use the prefix di-. Some examples include:
H3C¬ CH2¬ CH2¬ O¬ CH2¬ CH2¬ CH3
Dipropyl ether
H3C¬ CH2¬ O¬ CH2¬ CH2¬ CH3
Ethyl propyl ether
About Ethers
The most common ether is diethyl ether. Diethyl ether is a useful laboratory solvent 
because it can dissolve many organic compounds and it has a low boiling point 
(34.6 °C). The low boiling point allows for easy removal of the solvent. Diethyl ether was 
used as a general anesthetic for many years. When inhaled, diethyl ether depresses the 
central nervous system, causing unconsciousness and insensitivity to pain. Its use as an 
anesthetic, however, has decreased in recent years because other compounds have the 
same anesthetic effect with fewer side effects (such as nausea).
	21.13	 Amines
The simplest nitrogen-containing compound is ammonia (NH3). Amines are organic 
compounds containing nitrogen that are derived from ammonia with one or more of 
the hydrogen atoms replaced by alkyl groups. Like ammonia, amines are weak bases. 
We systematically name amines according to the hydrocarbon groups attached to the 
nitrogen and assign the ending -amine:
	
Ethylamine

Ethylmethylamine

Amines are most commonly known for their awful odors. When a living organism 
dies, the bacteria that feast on its proteins emit amines. For example, trimethylamine 
causes the smell of rotten fish, and cadaverine causes the smell of decaying animal flesh:

Amine Reactions
Just as carboxylic acids act as weak acids, so amines act as weak bases:
RNH2(aq) + H2O(l) ∆RNH3
+(aq) + OH-(aq)
Like all bases, amines react with strong acids to form salts called ammonium salts. For 
example, methylamine reacts with hydrochloric acid to form methylammonium chloride:
CH3NH2(aq) + HCl(aq) ¡ CH3NH3
+Cl-(aq)
Methylammonium chloride
An important amine reaction that we will see again in Chapter 22 is the condensa-
tion reaction between a carboxylic acid and an amine to form an amide:
CH3COOH(aq) + HNHR(aq) ¡ CH3CONHR(aq) + HOH(l)
This reaction is responsible for the formation of proteins from amino acids (see  
Section 22.4).

contain carbon (and other elements including hydrogen, oxygen, 
and nitrogen).
Carbon (21.2)
▶
▶Carbon forms more compounds than all the other elements  
combined.
▶
▶Carbon’s four valence electrons (in conjunction with its size)  
allow carbon to form four bonds (in the form of single, double, or 
triple bonds).
▶
▶Carbon also has the capacity to catenate, to form long chains, 
­because of the strength of the carbon–carbon bond.
Hydrocarbons (21.3)

▶
▶We categorize hydrocarbons into four different types: alkanes,  
alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons.
▶
▶Stereoisomers are molecules that feature the same atoms bonded 
in the same order but arranged differently in space. Optical isom-
erism, a type of stereoisomerism, occurs when two molecules are 
nonsuperimposable mirror images of one another.
Alkanes (21.4)
▶
▶Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons—they contain only single 
bonds and are therefore represented by the generic formula 
CnH2n + 2. Alkane names always end in -ane.
Alkenes and Alkynes (21.5)
▶
▶Alkenes and alkynes are unsaturated hydrocarbons—they contain 
double bonds (alkenes) or triple bonds (alkynes) and are repre-
sented by the generic formulas CnH2n and CnH2n - 2, respectively.
▶
▶Alkene names end in -ene and alkynes end in -yne.
▶
▶Because rotation about a double bond is severely restricted, geo-
metric (or cis–trans) isomerism occurs in alkenes.
Hydrocarbon Reactions (21.6)
▶
▶The most common hydrocarbon reaction is probably combustion, 
in which hydrocarbons react with oxygen to form carbon dioxide 
and water; this reaction is exothermic and is used to provide most 
of our society’s energy.
▶
▶Alkanes can also undergo substitution reactions, where heat or 
light causes another atom, commonly a halogen such as bromine, 
to be substituted for a hydrogen atom.
▶
▶Unsaturated hydrocarbons undergo addition reactions. If the ad-
dition reaction is between two unsymmetrical molecules, Mar-
kovnikov’s rule predicts that the positive end of the polar reagent 
adds to the carbon with the most hydrogen atoms.
Aromatic Hydrocarbons (21.7)
▶
▶Aromatic hydrocarbons contain six-membered benzene rings rep-
resented with alternating single and double bonds that become 
equivalent through resonance. These compounds are called aro-
matic because they often produce pleasant fragrances.
▶
▶Because of the stability of the aromatic ring, benzene is more 
stable than a straight-chain alkene, and it undergoes substitution 
rather than addition reactions.
Functional Groups (21.8)
▶
▶Characteristic groups of atoms, such as hydroxyl (¬ OH), are 
functional groups. Molecules that contain the same functional 
group have similar chemical and physical properties and are re-
ferred to as families.
Alcohols (21.9)
▶
▶The family of alcohols contains the ¬ OH group and is named 
with the suffix -ol.
▶
▶Alcohols are commonly used in gasoline, in alcoholic beverages, 
and in sterilization procedures.
▶
▶Alcohols undergo substitution reactions, in which a substituent 
such as a halogen replaces the hydroxyl group.
▶
▶Alcohols undergo elimination reactions, in which water is elimi-
nated across a bond to form an alkene, and oxidation or reduction 
reactions.
▶
▶Alcohols also react with active metals to form alkoxide ions and 
hydrogen gas.
Aldehydes and Ketones (21.10)
▶
▶Aldehydes and ketones both contain a carbonyl group (a carbon 
atom double-bonded to oxygen).
▶
▶In aldehydes, the carbonyl group is at the end of a carbon chain, 
while in ketones it is between two other carbon atoms.
▶
▶Aldehydes are named with the suffix -al and ketones with the 
­suffix -one.
▶
▶A carbonyl can be formed by the oxidation of an alcohol or 
­reverted to an alcohol by reduction.
▶
▶Like alkenes, carbonyls undergo addition reactions; however, be-
cause the carbon–oxygen bond is highly polar, the electronegative 
component of the reagent always adds to the carbon atom, and 
the less electronegative part adds to the oxygen.
Carboxylic Acids and Esters (21.11)
▶
▶Carboxylic acids contain a carbonyl group and a hydroxide on the 
same carbon and are named with the suffix -oic acid.
▶
▶Esters contain a carbonyl group bonded to an oxygen atom  
that is in turn bonded to an R group; they are named with the 
­suffix -oate.
▶
▶Carboxylic acids taste sour, such as acetic acid in vinegar, while 
esters smell sweet.
▶
▶Carboxylic acids react as weak acids but can also form esters 
through condensation reactions with alcohols.
Ethers (21.12)
▶
▶The family of ethers contains an oxygen atom between two R 
groups.
▶
▶Ethers are named with the ending -yl ether.
Amines (21.13)
▶
▶Amines are organic compounds that contain nitrogen and are 
named with the suffix -amine.
▶
▶They are known for their terrible odors; the smell of decaying ani-
mal flesh is produced by cadaverine.
▶
▶Amines act as weak bases and produce a salt when mixed with a 
strong acid.
▶
▶The combination of an amine with a carboxylic acid leads to a 
condensation reaction; in our bodies, this reaction produces 
­proteins from amino acids.

Data Interpretation and Analysis
Preparation of Fruit-Scented Esters
	121. 	Ester compounds often have a sweet, pleasant odor. Many 
characteristic fruit scents are largely due to the natural pres-
ence of one or more ester compounds. As such, artificial 
scents for foods are often composed of complex mixtures of 
various esters. The exact identities and ratios of ingredients 
that compose particular scents are closely guarded secrets in 
the food and fragrance industry. 
Suppose that you are a chemist working for a company 
that is creating a new line of air fresheners. The company is con-
sidering three scents: apple, pear, and pineapple. The project 
manager has asked you to prepare the ester compounds that are 
largely responsible for these scents. The carbon skeleton formu-
las for these ester compounds are shown in Figure a▶.

n Chapter 21, we examined organic chemistry and discussed the different types of 
­organic compounds and their structures and chemistry. In this chapter, we turn to 
­biochemical compounds, those organic compounds important in living organisms. 
Biochemistry—the area of study at the interface between chemistry and biology that 
strives to understand living organisms at the molecular level—exploded in the second half 
of the twentieth century. That explosion began with the discovery of the structure of DNA 
in 1953 by James D. Watson and Francis H. C. Crick and continues to this day, most recent-
ly marked by the 2003 completion of the Human Genome Project, which succeeded in 
mapping the 3 billion base pairs within the DNA of humans. The benefits of biochemistry 
to humankind are numerous, ranging from a better understanding of illnesses and better 
drugs to cure them to a better understanding of ourselves and our origins.
	 22.1	 Diabetes and the Synthesis  
of Human Insulin
Diabetes afflicts over 16 million people in the United States alone. Today, it is a chronic 
but generally manageable ailment; at the beginning of the twentieth century, however, 
diabetes was often fatal. The most dangerous form, type 1 diabetes, develops when 
the pancreas does not make enough insulin, a protein that promotes the absorption of 
glucose from the blood into cells, where glucose is used for energy. Consequently, people 
with diabetes have high blood-sugar levels that can lead to a number of complications, 
including heart disease, blindness, and kidney failure. Before 1922, the only option 

1030	
Chapter 22  Biochemistry
diabetics had was to control their blood-sugar levels through diet, but this was often not 
enough to overcome the disease.
Important advances throughout the twentieth century dramatically changed the 
prognosis for diabetics. The initial breakthrough came in 1922, when researchers first 
injected insulin from animal sources into a diabetic. The insulin worked, resulting in 
a nearly complete recovery for the patient. Within a year, insulin harvested from the 
pancreases of slaughtered pigs became widely available, and, for many patients, dia-
betes became a long-term manageable disease. However, insulin taken from pigs and 
cattle is not identical to human insulin, and some patients do not tolerate the animal 
insulin as well as others.
In 1955, Frederick Sanger (1918–2013) discovered the detailed chemical structure 
of human insulin. As we will see later in this chapter, proteins are biological mole-
cules composed of repeating units called amino acids (of which there are 20 different 
types in humans). Sanger was able to determine the specific sequence of amino acids 
in human insulin, work for which he received the 1958 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. 
Knowing the amino acid sequence allowed researchers to synthesize human insulin 
in the laboratory by 1963. Unfortunately, they could not make sufficient amounts to 
meet the needs of diabetics.
The growing field of biotechnology, however, allowed a fledgling company called 
Genentech to synthesize human insulin on a large scale by the early 1980s. Researchers 
at Genentech were able to insert the human gene for insulin—the blueprint that deter-
mines how insulin is synthesized in humans—into the DNA of bacterial cells. When the 
bacteria reproduced in culture, they made copies of the inserted human insulin gene 
and passed it on to their offspring. Furthermore, as the growing bacterial culture synthe-
sized the bacterial proteins that it needed to grow and survive, it also synthesized human 
insulin. In other words, researchers at Genentech were able to get bacteria to produce 
human insulin for them! The ability to synthesize human insulin in this way revolution-
ized the treatment of diabetes, resulting in better health and extended lives for hundreds 
of millions of people who suffer from this disease.
The study of the chemistry occurring in living organisms is biochemistry, the 
topic of this chapter. Many biologically important molecules are very large and com-
plex—they are macromolecules. However, understanding their structures is not as diffi-
cult as you might imagine because most of them consist of much smaller, simpler 
components linked together into long chains (polymers). In this chapter, we divide our 
study of biochemistry along the lines of the major chemical components of cells: lipids, 
carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids.
	 22.2	 Lipids
Lipids are the chemical components of the cell that are insoluble in water but soluble 
in nonpolar solvents. Fatty acids, fats, oils, phospholipids, glycolipids, and steroids are 
all lipids. Their insolubility in water makes it possible for lipids to compose the structural 
components of cell membranes, which separate the aqueous interior of the cell from its 
aqueous environment in the body. Lipids also play a role in long-term energy storage 
and insulation.
Fatty Acids
One type of lipid is the fatty acid, a carboxylic acid (see Section 21.11) with a long 
hydrocarbon tail. The general structure for a fatty acid contains the carboxylic  
acid group:

O
OH
R
Fatty acid general structure

	
22.2  Lipids	
1031
The R on the left side of the structure represents a hydrocarbon chain containing 3 to 19 
carbon atoms. Fatty acids differ only in their R group.
Myristic acid, found in butterfat and in coconut oil, has the R group CH3(CH2)12. 
Myristic acid is a saturated fatty acid: its carbon chain has no double bonds:

Other fatty acids—called monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids—have one 
or more double bonds in their carbon chains. For example, oleic acid—found in olive oil, 
peanut oil, and human fat—is a monounsaturated fatty acid:

Dispersion forces are discussed  
in Section 11.3.
The long hydrocarbon tails of fatty acids make them insoluble in water. Table 22.1 
lists several fatty acids, some common sources for each, and their melting points. Notice 
that the melting points of the fatty acids increase as their carbon chain lengths increase. 
The longer the chains, the greater the dispersion forces between adjacent molecules in 
the solid state, and the higher the melting point. Notice also that the melting points 
decrease with the presence of double bonds. For example, stearic acid and oleic acid have 
the same number of carbon atoms, but stearic acid melts at 70 °C and oleic acid melts at 
4 °C. The double bond puts a “kink” in the carbon chain that makes it more difficult for 
neighboring molecules to interact over the entire length of the chain (Figure 22.1▶, on 
the next page), thus lowering the melting point.

the triglyceride is a saturated fat and tends to be solid at room temperature. Triglycerides 
from warm-blooded animals (for example, lard from pigs) are generally saturated.
If the fatty acids in a triglyceride are unsaturated, the triglyceride is an unsaturated 
fat, or an oil, and tends to be liquid at room temperature. Triglycerides from plants (olive 
oil, corn oil, canola oil, etc.) or from cold-blooded animals (fish oil) are generally 
unsaturated.
Most of the fats and oils in our diet are triglycerides. During digestion, triglycerides 
are broken down into fatty acids, glycerol, monoglycerides, and diglycerides. These 
products pass through the intestinal wall and reassemble into triglycerides before they 
are absorbed into the blood. This process is slower than the digestion of other food types, 
and for this reason eating fats and oils gives a lasting feeling of fullness.
The effect of fats and oils on health has been widely debated. Some diets call for a 
drastic reduction of our daily intake of fats and oils, whereas others actually call for an 
increase in fats and oils. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends 
moderate consumption of fats and oils, less than 30% of total caloric intake.
Other Lipids
Additional lipids found in cells include phospholipids, glycolipids, and steroids. 
Phospholipids have the same basic structure as triglycerides, except that one of 
the fatty acid groups is replaced with a phosphate group. Unlike a fatty acid, which 
is nonpolar, the phosphate group is polar. A phospholipid molecule therefore has a 
polar region and a nonpolar region. Consider the structure of phosphatidylcholine, a 
phospholipid found in the cell membranes of higher animals (Figure 22.3▶ on the next 
page). The polar part of the molecule is hydrophilic (has a strong affinity for water), while 
the nonpolar part is hydrophobic (is repelled by water).
Glycolipids have similar structures and properties. The nonpolar section of a gly-
colipid is composed of a fatty acid chain and a hydrocarbon chain. The polar section is a

cally as a circle with two long tails (Figure 22.4◀). The circle represents the polar, hydro-
philic part of the molecule, and the tails represent the nonpolar, hydrophobic parts. 
Phospholipids and glycolipids are key components of cell membranes; the polar parts 
interact with the aqueous environments inside and outside the cell, and the nonpolar 
parts interact with each other, forming a double-layered structure called a lipid bilayer 
(Figure 22.5◀). Lipid bilayers encapsulate cells and many cellular structures.
Steroids are lipids with a four-ring structure:
Cholesterol, testosterone, and b@estradiol are common steroids:

body. Like phospholipids and glycolipids, cholesterol is part of cell membranes. Cholesterol 
also serves as a starting material (or precursor) for the body’s synthesis of other steroids such 
as testosterone, a principal male hormone, and b@estradiol, a principal female hormone.

	 22.3	 Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are responsible for short-term storage of energy in living organisms, and 
they make up the main structural components of plants. Carbohydrates—as their name, 
which means carbon and water, implies—often have the general formula (CH2O)n. 
Structurally, we identify carbohydrates as polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones. For 
example, glucose, with the formula C6H12O6, has the following structure:

Glucose
Glucose is a six-carbon aldehyde (that is, it contains the ¬ CHO group) with ¬ OH 
groups on five of the six carbon atoms. The many ¬ OH groups make glucose soluble in 
water (and therefore in blood), which is crucial to glucose’s role as the primary fuel of 
cells. Glucose is easily transported in the bloodstream and is soluble within the aqueous 
interior of a cell. We broadly classify carbohydrates as simple carbohydrates (or simple 
sugars) and complex carbohydrates.
Simple Carbohydrates: Monosaccharides  
and Disaccharides
Monosaccharides—meaning 
“one 
sugar”—are 
the 
simplest 
carbohydrates. 
Monosaccharides contain between three and eight carbon atoms and have only one 
aldehyde or ketone functional group. The general names for monosaccharides begin 
with a prefix that indicates the number of carbon atoms, followed by the suffix -ose. The 
most common carbohydrates in living organisms are pentoses and hexoses.
Glucose, the structure of which we saw previously, is an example of a hexose, a 
six-carbon sugar. Glucose is also an example of an aldose, a sugar with an aldehyde 
group. Often, we combine these two ways of designating sugars; glucose is an aldohex-
ose (aldo- indicates that it is an aldehyde; -hex- indicates that it has six carbon atoms; 
and -ose indicates that it is a carbohydrate).
Another common carbohydrate is fructose, a polyhydroxy ketone with the following 
structure:
The name should not be taken 
literally—the hydrogen and oxygen in 
carbohydrates do not bond together in 
the same way that they bond in water.

Variations in the positions of the ¬ OH and ¬ H groups on these carbon atoms 
result in a number of different possible isomers for glucose. For example, switch-
ing the relative positions of the ¬ OH and ¬ H group on the carbon atom closest 
to the carbonyl group results in mannose, an optical isomer of glucose.

exhibit optical isomerism? How many of the carbon atoms in fructose are chiral?
Most five- and six-carbon monosaccharides undergo intramo-
lecular reactions that convert their straight carbon chain into a ring. 
For example, in glucose, the alcohol group on C5 reacts with the car-
bonyl group (C1), as shown in Figure 22.6◀ to form the ring struc-

22.3  Carbohydrates	
1037
In a glucose solution, the vast majority of the mole-
cules are in ring form. However, the molecules in ring 
form exist in equilibrium with a small fraction in the 
open-chain form. Other common monosaccharides, in 
their ring form, include fructose (discussed previously in 
its straight-chain form) and galactose shown at the right.
Galactose, also known as brain sugar, is a hexose 
usually found combined with other monosaccharides 
in disaccharides such as lactose (see next paragraph). 
Galactose also occurs within the brain and nervous system 
of most animals. Galactose and glucose differ only in the 
stereochemistry at C4. Notice that in galactose the ¬ OH 
group is roughly perpendicular to the plane of the ring 
while in glucose it is roughly in the same plane as the ring.
Two monosaccharides can link together via a glyco-
sidic linkage to form a disaccharide, a carbohydrate that 
can be decomposed into two simpler sugars. For example, 
glucose and fructose join to form sucrose, commonly known 
as table sugar (Figure 22.7▶). When we eat disaccharides, 
the link between individual monosaccharides is broken during 
digestion by hydrolysis, the splitting of a chemical bond with 
water that results in the addition of H and OH to the products. The 
resultant monosaccharides readily pass through the intestinal wall 
and enter the bloodstream to become fuel for cells.
Complex Carbohydrates
Monosaccharides can also link to form a type of natural polymer (or 
biopolymer) called a polysaccharide, a long, chain-like molecule 
composed of many bonded monosaccharide units. Polysaccharides are 
known as complex carbohydrates because of their long chains of 
sugars. The most common polysaccharides are cellulose, starch, and glycogen, all 
three of which are composed of repeating glucose units. The main difference 
among them lies in the way the units are bonded to each other. In cellulose, the oxygen 
atoms are roughly parallel with the planes of the rings. This is referred to as a b@glycosidic 
linkage. In starch and glycogen, the oxygen atoms joining neighboring glucose units 
point down relative to the planes of the rings. This is an a@glycosidic linkage:

Chapter 22  Biochemistry
Cellulose
The main structural component of plants, cellulose, is the most abundant organic 
substance on Earth and consists of glucose units bonded together by b@glycosidic 
linkages. This structure allows neighboring cellulose molecules to form multiple 
hydrogen bonds with one another, resulting in the rigid and structurally stable 
properties we associate with wood and fiber. Humans lack the enzyme required to 
digest cellulose. When we eat cellulose (usually called fiber when it is present in 
foods), it passes right through our intestines, providing bulk to stools and preventing 
constipation. In contrast, some bacteria have the enzyme required to metabolize 
cellulose into its component glucose units. These bacteria are common in the guts of 
termites and ruminants such as cows, allowing them to extract caloric content from 
cellulose.
Starch
The main energy storage medium for plants is starch, the soft, pliable substance abundant 
in potatoes and grains. Starch is composed of two slightly different polysaccharides, 
amylose and amylopectin. Both are made up of glucose units bonded together by a@glycosidic 
linkages, but amylopectin contains branches in the chains. When animals digest starch, the 
link between individual glucose units is broken by hydrolysis, allowing glucose molecules 
to pass through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream.
Glycogen
The structure of glycogen is similar to that of amylopectin, but the chain is even 
more highly branched. Animals use glycogen to store glucose in the muscles. 
Glycogen’s highly branched structure leaves many end groups that can be quickly 
hydrolyzed to meet energy needs. When muscles become depleted of glycogen, 
muscle movement and exercise become much more difficult. Marathon runners 
often “hit the wall” at about mile 20 because they have depleted most of the glycogen 
from their muscles.
	 22.4	 Proteins and Amino Acids
Proteins are the workhorse molecules in living organisms; they are involved in 
virtually every facet of cell structure and function. For example, most of the 
chemical reactions that occur in living organisms are enabled by enzymes, proteins 
that act as catalysts in biochemical reactions. Without enzymes, life would be 
impossible. Proteins are also the structural elements of muscle, skin, and cartilage. 
They transport oxygen in the blood, act as antibodies to fight disease, and function 
as hormones to regulate metabolic processes. Proteins reign supreme as the working 
molecules of life. Table 22.2 summarizes the functions of some of the important 
classes of proteins and lists examples of each.

In a protein, the presence of an R 
group does not necessarily indicate a 
pure alkyl group. See Table 22.3 for 
possible R groups.
Amino Acids: The Building Blocks of Proteins
Proteins are polymers of amino acids. Each amino acid molecule consists of a carbon 
atom—called the a@carbon—bonded to four different groups: an amine group, an R 
group (also called a side chain), a carboxylic acid group, and a hydrogen atom:

The R groups, or side chains, differ chemically. For example, phenylalanine has a

group, whereas lysine, since it contains nitrogen, has a basic one. When amino acids are 
strung together to make a protein, the chemical properties of the R groups determine 
the structure and properties of the protein. Table 22.3 shows the most common amino 
acids in proteins and their three-letter abbreviations. The diversity of amino acids cre-
ates the possibility for an even larger diversity of proteins.

22.4  Proteins and Amino Acids	
1041
Because all amino acids (except glycine) contain four different groups attached to a 
tetrahedral carbon (the a@carbon), all amino acids (except glycine) are chiral about that 
carbon. The amino acids that compose naturally occurring proteins are the Lenantio-
mers, and they are called L-amino acids. Why life on Earth is based on this enantiomer 
over the other is an interesting question that remains to be answered. (It seems just as 
likely that life could have used the D-enantiomer.)
Although we usually write the structures of amino acids as neutral, their actual 
structure is ionic and depends on pH. In general, amino acids undergo an intramolecu-
lar acid–base reaction and form a dipolar ion, or zwitterion:

Dipolar ion
At room temperature this equilibrium lies far to the right. Since one side of the dipo-
lar ion is positively charged and the other negatively charged, amino acids are highly 
polar and soluble in water. They also have fairly high melting points (usually 7200 °C). 
In addition, the intramolecular acid–base reaction makes amino acids less acidic and less 
basic than most carboxylic acids and amines, respectively.

Peptide bond
The resulting bond is a peptide bond, and the resulting molecule—two amino 
acids linked together—is a dipeptide. When two or more amino acids link in this way, 
the molecule they form has two distinct ends: an amino terminal (or N-terminal end) 
and a carboxyl terminal (or C-terminal end). A tripeptide is three amino acids joined by 
peptide bonds; a tetrapeptide is four; and so on. Short chains of amino acids are called 
oligopeptides generally, and longer chains (more than 20) are called ­polypeptides. 
Functional proteins usually contain one or more polypeptide chains, with each chain 
consisting of hundreds or even thousands of amino acids joined by peptide bonds.
The formation of a peptide bond is an 
example of a condensation reaction 
(see Section 21.11).

	 22.5	 Protein Structure
A protein’s structure is critical to its function. For example, recall from Section 22.1 that 
insulin is a protein that promotes the absorption of glucose out of the blood and into 
muscle cells where the glucose is needed for energy. Insulin recognizes muscle cells 
because muscle cell surfaces contain insulin receptors, molecules that fit a specific portion 
of the insulin protein. If insulin were a different shape, it would not latch onto insulin 
receptors on muscle cells and could not do its job. Thus, the shape or conformation of a 
protein is crucial to its function.
We can broadly classify proteins into two main structural categories: fibrous pro-
teins and globular proteins (Figure 22.8▶). Fibrous proteins tend to have relatively 

	
22.5  Protein Structure	
1043
simple linear structures and be insoluble in aqueous solutions. They serve primarily 
structural functions within living organisms. Collagen and keratin, for example, are both 
fibrous proteins (see Table 22.2). Globular proteins tend to have more complex struc-
tures but are often roughly spherical in overall shape. Globular proteins are generally 
structured so that polar side chains on amino acids are oriented toward the exterior of 
the protein, while nonpolar side chains are oriented toward the interior of the protein. 
Consequently, globular proteins tend to be soluble in water, but they maintain a nonpo-

Primary Structure
The primary structure of a protein is the sequence of amino acids in its chain(s). 
Primary structure, which determines the other three kinds of structure, is maintained 
by the covalent peptide bonds between individual amino acids. The primary structure 
of egg-white lysozyme—a protein that helps fight infection—is shown in Figure 22.10▼. 
The figure illustrates the amino acid sequence, the N-terminal and C-terminal ends, and 
the presence of disulfide linkages, covalent cross-links between cysteine amino acids in 
the polymer. We discuss disulfide linkages in more detail later in the section on tertiary 
structure. Researchers determined the first amino acid sequences for proteins in the 
1950s. Today, the amino acid sequences for thousands of proteins are known.
Changes in the amino acid sequence of a protein, even minor ones, can destroy the 
function of a protein. Hemoglobin, as we saw in Chapter 15, is a protein that transports oxy-
gen in the blood. It is composed of four polypeptide chains made up of a total of 574 amino 
acid units. If valine is replaced by glutamic acid in just one position on two of these chains, 
the disease known as sickle-cell anemia results. The red blood cells of people with sickle-cell 
anemia take on a sickle shape that impedes circulation, causing damage to major organs. In 
the past, sickle-cell anemia was fatal, often resulting in death before age 30—all due to a 
change in a few atoms of two amino acids out of 574. Modern therapies have extended the 
life span of people with sickle-cell anemia so that they now live into their 40s and 50s.
▲ The genetic disease known as 
sickle-cell anemia results in red blood 
cells with a sickle shape. These cells

▶ Figure 22.10  Primary Structure of Egg-White 
Lysozyme  Primary structure refers to the sequence of 
amino acids in a protein.
Secondary Structure
The secondary structure of a protein refers to certain regular periodic 
or repeating patterns in the arrangement of protein chains. Secondary 
structure is maintained by interactions between amino acids that are 
fairly close together in the linear sequence of the protein chain or that 
are adjacent to each other on neighboring chains or chains that fold 
back on themselves. The most common of these patterns is the A@helix, 
shown in Figure 22.11◀. In the a@helix structure, the amino acid chain 
wraps into a tight coil from which side chains extend. The structure is 
maintained by hydrogen-bonding interactions between NH and CO 
groups along the peptide backbone of the protein. Some proteins—
such as keratin, which composes human hair—have the a@helix pattern 
throughout their entire chain. Other proteins have very little or no 
a@helix pattern in their chain.

A second common pattern in the secondary structure of proteins is the 
B@pleated sheet (Figure 22.12▲). In this structure, the chain is extended (as opposed 
to coiled) and forms a zigzag pattern. The peptide backbones of neighboring chains 
interact with one another through hydrogen bonding to form zigzag-shaped sheets. 
Some proteins—such as silk—have the b@pleated sheet structure throughout their 
entire chains. Since the protein chains in the b@pleated sheet are fully extended, silk is 
inelastic. Many proteins have some sections that are b@pleated sheet, other sections 
that are a@helical, and still other sections that have less regular patterns referred to as 
random coils.
Tertiary Structure
The tertiary structure of a protein consists of the large-scale bends and folds 
resulting from interactions between the R groups of amino acids that are separated by 
large distances in the linear sequence of the protein chain. These interactions, shown in 
Figure 22.13▼, include hydrogen bonding, disulfide linkages (covalent bonds between 
cysteine amino acids), hydrophobic interactions (attractions between large, nonpolar 
side chains), and salt bridges (acid–base interactions between acidic and basic side 
chains). Fibrous proteins generally lack tertiary structure; they simply extend in a long 
continuous chain with some secondary structure. Globular proteins, by contrast, fold in 
on themselves, forming complex globular shapes rich in tertiary structure.

Chapter 22  Biochemistry
Quaternary Structure
Some proteins—called monomeric proteins—are composed of only one polypeptide 
chain. However, multimeric proteins are composed of several polypeptide chains, 
called subunits. We just saw, for example, that hemoglobin is composed of four such 
subunits. The way that subunits fit together in a multimeric protein is referred to as the 
quaternary structure of the protein. Quaternary structure is maintained by the same 
types of interactions that maintain tertiary structure, but the interactions are between 
amino acids on different subunits.
Summarizing Protein Structure:
▶
▶
Primary structure is the amino acid sequence. It is maintained by the peptide bonds 
that hold amino acids together.
▶
▶
Secondary structure refers to the repeating patterns in the arrangement of protein 
chains. These are maintained by interactions between the peptide backbones of 
amino acids that are close together in the chain sequence or adjacent to each other 
on neighboring chains. Secondary structure is characteristic of fibrous proteins, but 
globular proteins also frequently feature regions of a@helix, b@pleated sheet, and ran-
dom coil secondary structure.
▶
▶
Tertiary structure refers to the large-scale twists and folds of globular proteins. These 
are maintained by interactions between the R groups of amino acids that are sepa-
rated by long distances in the chain sequence.
▶
▶
Quaternary structure refers to the arrangement of subunits in proteins that have 
more than one polypeptide chain. Quaternary structure is maintained by interac-
tions between amino acids on different subunits.
	 22.6	 Nucleic Acids: Blueprints for Proteins
We have seen that the amino acid sequence in a protein determines that protein’s 
structure and function. If the amino acid sequence is incorrect, the protein is unlikely 
to function properly. How do cells in living organisms synthesize the many thousands 
of different required proteins, each with the correct amino acid sequence? The answer 
lies in nucleic acids, molecules that serve as blueprints for protein synthesis. Nucleic 
acids employ a chemical code to specify the correct amino acid sequences for proteins. 
Nucleic acids are broadly divided into two types: deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, which 
exists primarily in the nucleus of the cell; and ribonucleic acid, or RNA, which exists 
throughout the cell.
The Basic Structure of Nucleic Acids
Like proteins, nucleic acids are polymers. The individual units composing nucleic acids 
are nucleotides. Each nucleotide has three parts: a sugar, a base, and a phosphate 
group that serves as a link between sugars (Figure 22.14▼).

The base attaches to the sugar at C1, and the phosphate attaches to the sugar at C3 and 
C5. When a base is attached to the sugar, the numbers of the carbon atoms in the sugar 
ring are primed to distinguish them from the carbon atoms on the bases (which are not 
primed). For example, C5 becomes C5′ and C3 becomes C3′.
Bases
Every nucleotide in DNA has the same sugar, but each nucleotide has just one of four 
different bases. In DNA, the four bases are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and 
thymine (T). Each of these bases bonds to the sugar via the nitrogen atom circled in the 
illustrations shown here:

▲ Figure 22.15  Base Pairing in DNA  The bases in nucleic acids are complementary. Each pyrimidine base pairs with only 
one purine base (G with C, A with T) via specific hydrogen bonds that occur between the two bases.
The bases in nucleic acids 
are complementary—that is, 
each one precisely pairs with 
another base. Each pyrimidine 
base pairs with only one purine 
base via specific hydrogen bonds 
that occur between the two bases. 
More specifically, guanine pairs only with 
cytosine through three hydrogen bonds, and 
adenine pairs only with thymine through two 
hydrogen bonds as shown in Figure 22.15▲. In 
other words, guanine is complementary to cytosine 
and adenine is complementary to thymine. This base 
pairing is central to DNA replication, as we discuss in 
­Section 22.7.
Phosphate Links
The sugar units in nucleic acids link together by phosphate groups, 
which bind to C5′ and C3′ of the sugar as shown in Figure 22.16▶. 
Note that a nucleic acid molecule has two distinct ends, which we refer to 
as the 5′ end and the 3′ end.
The Genetic Code
The order of bases in a nucleic acid chain determines the order of amino acids in a protein. 
However, since there are only four bases, and since together they must have the ability 
to code for 20 different amino acids, a single base cannot code for a single amino acid. A

Genetic Structure
▲ Figure 22.17  Genetic Structure  The hierarchical structure of genetic information is 
chromosome, gene, codon, and nucleotide.
sequence of three nucleotides—called a codon—codes for each amino acid (Figure 22.17▲). 
The genetic code—the code that identifies the amino acid specified by a particular codon—
was worked out in 1961. It is nearly universal—the same codons specify the same amino 
acids in nearly all organisms. For example, in DNA the sequence AGT codes for the amino 
acid serine, and the sequence ACC codes for the amino acid threonine. It does not matter if 
the DNA is in a rat, a bacterium, or a human—the code is the same.
A gene is a sequence of codons within a DNA molecule that codes for a single pro-
tein. Since proteins vary in size from a few dozen to thousands of amino acids, genes 
vary in length from dozens to thousands of codons. For example, egg-white lysozyme 
(see Figure 22.10) is composed of 129 amino acids. So the lysozyme gene contains 129 
codons—one for each amino acid in the lysozyme protein. Each codon is like a three-
letter word that specifies one amino acid. String the correct number of codons 
together in the correct sequence, and you have a gene, the instructions for the amino 
acid sequence in a protein. Genes are contained in structures called chromosomes 
(Figure 22.18▶). A human cell generally contains 46 chromosomes in its nucleus.
▲ Figure 22.18  Chromosomes   
Genes are contained in structures

cells contain 46 chromosomes.
In addition to having a codon for 
each amino acid, genes also contain 
additional coding that signals, for 
example, where the gene begins and 
where it ends.

	 22.7	 DNA Replication, the Double Helix, and 
Protein Synthesis
Most of the cells in our bodies contain all of the genes required to make all of the proteins 
that we need—the DNA within any one cell is complete. However, any particular cell does 
not express all those genes; it does not synthesize all those proteins. Cells synthesize 
only the proteins that are important to their function. For example, a pancreatic cell 
expresses the insulin gene within its nucleus to synthesize insulin. Pancreatic cells do 
not express the gene for keratin (the protein in hair), even though the keratin gene is 
also contained in their nuclei. The cells in our scalp, in contrast, which also have both 
insulin and keratin genes in their nuclei, synthesize keratin but not insulin.
DNA Replication and the Double Helix
The human body contains on the order of 1013 cells, most 
of which have complete copies of the DNA that originally 
was present in a single cell (the fertilized egg). When a 
cell divides, it makes complete copies of its DNA for each 
daughter cell. The ability of DNA to copy itself is related to its 
structure, discovered in 1953 by James D. Watson and Francis 
H. C. Crick. Watson and Crick, aided by evidence from 
X-ray diffraction photos (see Section 12.2), determined that 
DNA exists as two complementary strands wound around 
each other in a double helix (Figure 22.19◀). The strands 
are antiparallel, so one runs 3′ ¡ 5′ while the other runs 
5′ ¡ 3′. The bases on each DNA strand are directed toward 
the interior of the helix, where they hydrogen-bond to their 
complementary bases on the other strand. For example, if a 
section of DNA contains the bases:
A
T
G
A
A
T
C
C
G
A C
the complementary strand has the sequence:
T
A C
T
T
A G G C
T
G
As we saw earlier, A pairs only with T, and C pairs only with G. The two complementary 
strands are tightly wrapped into a helical coil, the famous DNA double helix structure 
(Figure 22.20▼).

◀ Figure 22.21  DNA Replication   
When a cell is about to divide, its DNA 
unwinds. With the help of the enzyme 
DNA polymerase, a complement to 
each daughter strand is formed, 
resulting in two complete copies of the 
original DNA.
When a cell is about to divide, the DNA unwinds and the hydrogen bonds joining 
the complementary bases break (Figure 22.21▲), forming two daughter strands. With 
the help of the enzyme DNA polymerase, a complement to each daughter strand—with 
the correct complementary bases in the correct sequence—forms. The hydrogen bonds 
between the old strands and the newly complementary strands then re-form, resulting 
in two complete copies of the original DNA, one for each daughter cell.
Protein Synthesis
Living organisms must continually synthesize thousands of proteins to survive, each 
when it is needed and in the quantities required. When a cell needs to make a particular 
protein, the gene—the section of the DNA that codes for that particular protein—
unravels. Complementary copies of that gene are then synthesized (or transcribed) as 
single strands of messenger RNA (or mRNA). The mRNA moves out of the cell’s nucleus to 
structures in the cytoplasm called ribosomes.
At the ribosome, protein synthesis occurs. The ribosome (which has a large subunit 
and a small subunit) moves along the mRNA chain that codes for the protein, “reading” 
the sequence of codons. At each codon, the specified amino acid is brought into place 
and a peptide bond forms with the previous amino acid (Figure 22.22▼). As the ribo-
some moves along the mRNA, the protein forms. All of this is orchestrated by enzymes 
that catalyze the necessary reactions.

Chemistry and Medicine | The Human Genome Project
I
n 1990, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the 
­National Institutes of Health (NIH) embarked on a 15-year 
project to map the human genome, all of the genetic material 
of a human being. Over 2500 researchers from 18 countries 
contributed to this research, which has been referred to as 
the Mount Everest of biology. An initial draft of the map was 
completed in 2001 and the final draft was completed in 
2003. Here, we highlight some of what has been learned 
through this massive undertaking.
•	 The human genome contains 3165 million nucleotide 
base pairs.
•	 The average gene contains about 3000 base pairs. The 
largest gene is for the protein dystrophin (dystrophin 
deficiency is the root cause of muscular dystrophy); it 
contains 2.4 million base pairs.
•	 The human genome contains about 30,000 genes. The 
function of over half of these is still unknown. Before 
the Human Genome Project, researchers had estimated 
that humans had about 100,000 genes. The number of 
genes in humans is not much larger than the number 
found in many simpler organisms. For example, the num-
ber of genes in a roundworm is nearly 20,000. Whatever 
makes humans unique, it is not the number of genes in 
our genome.
•	 Less than 2% of human DNA actually consists of genes. 
These genes are aggregated in seemingly random areas 
within the genome, with vast expanses of noncoding 
DNA between the coding regions. This stands in contrast 
to other organisms, which tend to have more uniform 
distribution of genes throughout their genome.
•	 The order of DNA base pairs is 99.9% identical in all 
humans.
•	 About 1.4 million single base-pair differences (called 
SNPs for single-nucleotide polymorphisms) have been 
identified in the human genome. Understanding SNPs 
can help in identifying individuals who are susceptible 
to certain diseases. Knowledge of SNPs may also allow 
physicians to tailor drugs to match individuals.
Knowledge of the human genome is expected to lead to 
the development of new therapies in several ways. First, 
knowledge of genes can lead to smart drug design. Instead 
of developing drugs by trial and error (the current procedure 
for many drugs), knowledge of a specific gene will allow sci-
entists to design drugs to carry out a specific function re-
lated to that gene or its protein product. Second, human 
genes themselves can provide the blueprint for the produc-
tion of certain types of drugs, either in the laboratory or by 
other organisms. For example, in Section 22.1 we dis-
cussed how insulin is made by inserting the insulin gene 
into bacteria, which then synthesize the needed drug. In-
triguingly, it may even be possible to replace abnormal or 
missing genes in the cells of diseased patients. Such gene 
therapies are still in the early stages of development, but 
they may eventually give us a powerful new tool for 
­combating inherited diseases.
Although the completion of the Human Genome Project 
may seem like the end, it is really just the beginning. 
­Thousands of studies in the coming years will rely on the 
data obtained through this endeavor.
Summarizing DNA Coding:
▶
▶
DNA contains the code for the sequence of amino acids in proteins.
▶
▶
A codon—three nucleotides with their bases—codes for one amino acid.
▶
▶
A gene—a sequence of codons—codes for one protein.
▶
▶
Genes are contained in structures called chromosomes that occur within cells. 
­Humans have 46 chromosomes in the nuclei of their cells.
▶
▶
When a human cell divides, each daughter cell receives a complete copy of the 
DNA—all 46 chromosomes.
▶
▶
When a cell synthesizes a protein, the base sequence of the gene that codes for 
that protein is transferred to mRNA. The mRNA then moves to a ribosome, where 
the amino acids are linked in the correct sequence to synthesize the protein. The 
­general sequence of information flow is:

Key Concepts
Diabetes and the Synthesis of Human Insulin (22.1)
▶
▶Diabetes is a chronic illness that occurs when the pancreas cannot 
make enough insulin, a protein that promotes the absorption of 
glucose into cells.
▶
▶The chemical structure of insulin was discovered in 1955 by Fred-
erick Sanger, who made it possible for insulin to be synthesized in 
the laboratory.
▶
▶Eventually, scientists inserted the human gene that codes for the 
production of insulin into bacteria, which were then able to pro-
duce enough insulin to supply diabetics.
Lipids (22.2)
▶
▶Lipids are biological chemicals that are nonpolar and, therefore, 
insoluble in water. In our bodies, lipids compose cell membranes, 
store energy, and provide insulation.
▶
▶A type of lipid called a fatty acid is a carboxylic acid with a long hy-
drocarbon chain. Fatty acids can be saturated, meaning they con-
tain the maximum number of hydrogen atoms, or unsaturated, 
meaning they contain one or more carbon–carbon double bonds. 
Saturated fatty acids experience greater intermolecular forces, 
making them solid at room temperature, while unsaturated fatty 
acids are liquids.
▶
▶Fats and oils are triglycerides, triesters composed of glycerol bond-
ed by ester linkages to three fatty acids. Like fatty acids, triglycer-
ides can be saturated (fats) or unsaturated (oils).
▶
▶Other lipids include phospholipids, made up of a glycerol 
bonded to two nonpolar fatty acids and a polar phosphate 
group, used in animal cell membranes; glycolipids, similar to 
phospholipids but with a sugar molecule as their polar head; 
and steroids, four-ringed lipids that include cholesterol and sex 
hormones.
Carbohydrates (22.3)
▶
▶Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones and 
­generally have the formula (CH2O)n. They are important to short-
term energy storage and plant structure composition.
▶
▶Monosaccharides, the simplest carbohydrates, contain three 
to eight carbons with one aldehyde or ketone functional group. 
­Glucose, an example of a hexose, can exist both in a linear form 
and a ring form.

	
Chapter in Review	
1055
▶
▶Two monosaccharides combine to form a disaccharide. For exam-
ple, glucose and fructose combine to form sucrose. The glycosidic 
linkages that connect the two monosaccharides are broken during 
digestion by hydrolysis.
▶
▶Polysaccharides are polymers of monosaccharides known as com-
plex carbohydrates. They include cellulose, also called fiber, the 
main structural component of plants; starch, an energy storage 
compound found in potatoes and grains; and glycogen, used by 
animals to store glucose in the muscles.
Proteins and Amino Acids (22.4)
▶
▶Proteins are polymers of amino acids and serve a variety of biologi-
cal functions including structure composition, metabolic regula-
tion, and muscle contraction. Enzymes are particularly important 
proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions in cells.
▶
▶An amino acid contains a carbon atom bonded to an amine group, 
a carboxylic acid group, a hydrogen atom, and an R group. There 
are 20 amino acids in humans, and they differ only in their R 
group.
▶
▶Amino acids form peptide bonds between the amine end of one 
amino acid with the carboxylic end of another, creating dipep-
tides, tripeptides, and so on, or polypeptides, large examples of 
which are called proteins.
Protein Structure (22.5)
▶
▶Protein structure and shape are critical to protein function.
▶
▶Proteins can be broadly divided into two structural categories. Fi-
brous proteins are generally linear, insoluble structures that serve 
structural functions. Globular proteins fold into roughly spherical 
conformations with nonpolar side chains oriented to the interior 
and polar side chains oriented to the exterior; this structure makes 
globular proteins soluble in water.
▶
▶Protein structure can be analyzed at four levels. The primary struc-
ture is the sequence of the amino acid chain. The secondary struc-
ture refers to certain regular repeating patterns in the arrangement 
of protein chains, such as a-helix and b-pleated sheet patterns. The 
tertiary structure refers to large-scale bends and folds due to interac-
tions between the R groups of amino acids such as hydrogen bond-
ing, disulfide linkages, hydrophobic interactions, and salt bridges. 
Quaternary structure shows the way that monomeric subunits fit 
together in multimeric proteins that have more than one polypep-
tide chain.
Nucleic Acids (22.6)
▶
▶Nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, are the chemical blueprints 
used to synthesize proteins. Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleo-
tides, which are each composed of a sugar, a base, and a phosphate 
group.
▶
▶The bases of DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and 
thymine (T), which are subject to complementary pairing: each 
pyrimidine base combines with only one purine base.
▶
▶Phosphate links bind the C5′ carbon of one sugar with the C3′ 
carbon of another sugar to make the polymeric chain.
▶
▶The order of the bases in a nucleic acid chain specifies the order of 
amino acids in a protein.
▶
▶Each amino acid is coded by a codon, a sequence of three  
bases. A gene is a sequence of codons that codes for a specif-
ic protein. Genes, in turn, are contained in structures called 
­chromosomes.
DNA Replication, the Double Helix, and Protein 
Synthesis (22.7)
▶
▶Though the DNA code is complete in any cell in the body, every 
cell does not express every gene. Cells only express the genes rel-
evant to their function.
▶
▶DNA is composed of two complementary strands wound around 
each other in a double helix. The strands are antiparallel; the bases 
of each strand face the interior and hydrogen-bond to their com-
plements on the other strand.
▶
▶In order to replicate, a DNA strand divides and an enzyme 
called DNA polymerase creates the complement of each of the 
divided strands, thereby making two copies of the original DNA 
molecule.
▶
▶To synthesize proteins, the section of DNA that codes for that 
gene unravels. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthesized as a copy 
of the gene. The mRNA joins with ribosomes, structures that 
“read” the mRNA code and synthesize the correct sequence of 
amino acids.

Conceptual Problems
	 90. 	How many different tetrapeptides can form from four different 
amino acids?
	 91. 	Could the genetic code have been based on just three bases and 
three-base codons? Explain why or why not. (Assume that the 
code must accommodate 20 different amino acids.)
	 92. 	The genetic code is random, which means that a particular 
codon could have coded for a different amino acid. The genetic 
code is also nearly universal, meaning that it is the same code 
in nearly all organisms (and in the few where it differs, it does 
so only slightly). If scientists ever find life on another planet, 
they will be curious to know its genetic code. What would a 
completely different genetic code indicate about the origin  
of the life forms? What would a genetic code identical to ter-
restrial life indicate?

Challenge Problems
	 85. 	One way to fight viral infections is to prevent a virus from repli-
cating its DNA. Without DNA replication, the virus cannot mul-
tiply. Some viral drug therapies cause the introduction of fake 
nucleotides into cells. When the virus uses one of these fake 
nucleotides in an attempt to replicate its DNA, the fake nucleo-
tide doesn’t work and viral DNA replication is halted. For exam-
ple, azidothymidine (AZT), a drug used to fight the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, results in the 
introduction of the following fake thymine-containing nucleo-
tide into cells. Examine the structures of the real nucleotide and 
the AZT fake nucleotide. Propose a mechanism for how this 
fake nucleotide might halt DNA replication.
	
	 The kinetics of glucose transport through the membrane  
follows the Michaelis–Menten equation:
 V0 =
Vmax[glucose]
Kt + [glucose]
 V0 = rate of glucose entry
Vmax = 	maximum rate (the point at which addition of  
	
glucose has no effect on the rate)
Kt = transport constant
	
	 The Michaelis–Menten equation can be rearranged so that a 
plot 1  >  V0 versus 1>[glucose] produces a straight line. 
­Rearrange the equation and plot the data in order to deter-
mine Kt and Vmax for glucose transport across the erythrocyte 
membrane.
	 88. 	Eukaryotic DNA is equipped with special ends called telomers. 
Telomers are made up of hexanucleotide sequences that repeat 
at the ends of the DNA. For example, human DNA features re-
peating AGGGTT sequences. Functionally, telomers protect the 
ends of chromosomes from being treated as a broken piece of 
DNA in need of repair. Interestingly, telomers are cut off each 
time the DNA is replicated, indicating a possible cellular clock 
that allows only a certain number of cellular replications. Telom-
erase is the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of telomers. 
Telomerase is present in limited quantities within certain cells 
such as fetal tissue, adult male germ cells, and stem cells. It is also 
found in over 85% of tumor cells. Researchers speculate that the 
telomerase activity may be linked to cancer. Propose an explana-
tion for why telomerase activity could be associated with cancer 
and speculate on ways in which cancer treatments in the future 
may capitalize on research on this enzyme.
	 89. 	Write the major equilibrium that is established in a solution of 
glycine at pH = 2 and at pH = 10. The pKa of the COOH group 
is 2.3 and the pKa of the NH3
+ group is 9.6. Determine the rela-
tive concentrations of each member of the relevant conjugate 
acid–base pair at pH = 2 and pH = 10. Calculate the pH at 
which glycine is neutral.

Data Interpretation and Analysis
Digestion of Lactose by the Lactase Enzyme
	 98. 	Lactose is a disaccharide sugar present in milk. Lactose is 
composed of two monosaccharides, galactose and glucose, that 
are joined together by a b-glycosidic bond. The b-glycosidic 
bond forms between the hydroxyl group on C-1 of galactose and 
C-4 of glucose.
When lactose is digested, the glycosidic bond between 
galactose and glucose is hydrolyzed. The enzyme responsible 
for hydrolyzing lactose is lactase, which is found in the small 
intestine. Millions of people lack sufficient levels of lactase, 
and as a result, they experience lactose intolerance. If lactose is 
not hydrolyzed, it remains in the intestines. Bacteria in the gut 
ferment the lactose, causing many unpleasant symptoms such 
as indigestion, cramping, and gas. Fortunately, commercial 
preparations can enable lactose-intolerant individuals to 
consume and digest milk products without discomfort.
Use the information provided to answer the following 
questions:
a. Draw the structure of lactose. (The structures of galactose and 
glucose are shown on page 1037 with their carbon number-
ing scheme.)

c. A glutamic acid in the active site of lactase is suspected to be

Answers to Conceptual Connections
Peptides
22.1	 Six possible tripeptides can form from these three amino 
­acids. They are (1) Ser-Gly-Ala; (2) Gly-Ala-Ser; (3) Ala-Ser-Gly;  
(4) Ala-Gly-Ser; (5) Ser-Ala-Gly; (6) Gly-Ser-Ala. Notice that 
bonding the amino acids in reverse order results in a different 
molecule because the N-terminal and the C-terminal ends re-
side on different amino acids. For example, in Ser-Gly-Ala, the 
N-terminal amino acid is Ser (conventionally drawn on the 
left) and the C-terminal side is Ala. In Ala-Gly-Ser, in contrast, 
the N-terminal amino acid is Ala and the C-terminal one is Ser.
The Genetic Code
22.2	 The number of unique two-base sequences of four bases is 
42 = 16. The number of unique three-base sequences of four 
bases is 43 = 64. A two-base system could code for 16 amino 
acids, and a three-base system could code for 64 amino acids.

Chemistry of the 
Nonmetals
What one learns in chemistry is that Nature wrote 
all the rules of structuring; man does not invent 
chemical structuring rules; he only discovers the 
rules. All the chemist can do is find out what 
Nature permits, and any substances that are thus 
developed or discovered are inherently natural.

I
n these last few chapters, we explore the descriptive chemistry of the nonmetals and 
metals. These descriptions are part of a branch of chemistry called inorganic chemistry. 
We begin our exploration of descriptive inorganic chemistry by looking at the 
­chemistry of some of the main-group elements. The main-group elements are grouped to-
gether because their valence electrons occupy only s or p orbitals; however, their properties 
vary greatly. The main-group elements include metals, nonmetals, and metalloids and 
they may be solids, liquids, or gases at room temperature. This great diversity of properties, 
bonding, and structures of all the main-group elements cannot be adequately described in 
a single chapter. Therefore, this chapter focuses on only a few main-group elements 
­(silicon, boron, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, sulfur, and the halogens) and their 
compounds in an effort to illustrate the diversity within the group.
	 23.1 	 Insulated Nanowires
In 1991, scientists discovered carbon nanotubes, the long, thin, hollow cylinders of 
carbon atoms that we discussed in Section 12.6. In the late 1990s, scientists discovered 
that they could make similar tubes from boron nitride. Boron nitride contains BN units 
that are isoelectronic (having the same number of electrons) with carbon in the sense 
that each BN unit contains eight valence electrons, or four per atom (just like carbon). 
The size and electronegativity of a carbon atom are also almost equal to the average of 
those properties for a boron atom and a nitrogen atom (Table 23.1). As a result, BN forms 
a number of structures that are similar to those formed by carbon, including nanotubes.

An important difference between boron nitride nanotubes and carbon nanotubes 
is their conductivity. Carbon nanotubes conduct electrical current, but 
boron nitride tubes act as insulators. In 2003, scientists were able to com-
bine these two sorts of nanotubes into one structure: a conducting 
carbon nanotube with an insulating boron nitride sheath, shown in 
Figure 23.1◀. The result is an insulated conducting wire that is 
100,000 times thinner than a human hair. Such thin wires may some-
day be used in computers and other electronic devices, allowing these 
devices to continue to become smaller and more efficient.
The more we learn about the structures and reactivities of known 
materials, the better equipped we are to discover new materials and applica-
tions. Even though it may seem that most inorganic compounds have already 
been discovered and analyzed, new materials, with immense impacts on our society, are 
constantly being discovered. As Buckminster Fuller stated in this chapter’s opening quote, 
we continue to find “what Nature permits.” In some cases, what nature permits turns out 
to be extremely useful to society.
	 23.2 	 The Main-Group Elements: Bonding  
and Properties
We identify the main-group elements by their electron configurations. In this chapter, 
we focus on groups 3A–7A, the major part of the p block in the periodic table. The p 
orbitals fill incrementally across any row of this section of the periodic table; they contain 
from one electron in group 3A to five electrons in group 7A (the halogens). The physical 
properties of the elements, such as atomic size and electronegativity, also change across 
each period, and this affects their reactivity and the types of compounds they form.

23.2   The Main-Group Elements: Bonding and Properties 	 1065
Recall from Section 8.6 that the effective nuclear charge of the main-group elements 
becomes greater as we move to the right across any row in the periodic table. This increas-
ing effective charge results in smaller radii, increasing electronegativity, and increasing 
ionization energy as we move to the right across the periods. Consequently, as we have 
seen since the early chapters of this book, the nonmetals on the right side of the periodic 
table (those toward the right of the p block) tend to form anions in ionic compounds. 
They are easily reduced, gaining electrons to completely fill their p orbitals and attain 
noble gas electron configurations. These elements act in reactions as oxidizing agents—
they oxidize other substances while they are themselves reduced. The smallest halogens 
and the elements in the oxygen group are the strongest oxidizing agents in the p block.
Elements near the center of the p block have fewer p electrons and do not usually fill 
the p orbitals by forming anions; instead they share electrons, forming covalent bonds. 
We see this type of reactivity in the vast array of molecular compounds formed by the 
smaller elements in the carbon and nitrogen groups. The main-group elements on the 
far left of the p block have only one p electron and form cations in ionic compounds and 
electron-deficient species (species with an incomplete octet) in covalent compounds.
Notice that as we move to the right across any row in the p block, the type of bond-
ing changes as the elements become less metallic. Recall from Section 8.8 that metallic  
character increases as we go down each column. The diagonal group of metalloid ele-
ments stretching from boron to astatine divides the main-group elements: to the left of 
this diagonal, the elements are metals that form cations and metallic compounds; to the 
right, the elements are nonmetals that form anions and covalent compounds.
The vast range in elemental properties, from those of metallic elements such as 
thallium and lead that have very low electronegativities of 1.8 and 1.9 (respectively) to 
those of the nonmetallic elements such as oxygen and fluorine that have the highest 
electronegativities of 3.5 and 4.0 (respectively), results in the great chemical diversity of 
the elements in the p block. These elements include metals, alloys, simple covalent com-
pounds, enormous covalent network compounds, simple binary ionic compounds, and 
complex chain and layered ionic compounds.

	 23.3 	 Silicates: The Most Abundant Matter  
in Earth’s Crust
The most abundant elements in Earth’s crust are oxygen (45–50% by mass) and silicon 
(about 28% by mass). The few other elements that individually comprise more than 1% 
of the crust’s mass are aluminum, iron, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium 
(Figure 23.2▼), and most of these are found in silicon and oxygen compounds. In order 
to understand the matter on Earth’s surface, we must understand silicon and oxygen 
compounds.
Oxygen: 46.4%
Silicon: 28.2%
Al: 8.32%
Fe: 5.63%
Ca: 4.15%
Na: 2.36%
Mg: 2.33%

▶ Figure 23.2  Major Elements in 
Earth’s Crust  The major components 
of Earth’s crust are oxygen and silicon. 
Only a few other elements compose 
more than 1% of the crust each.
Silicates are covalent atomic solids (see Section 12.6) that contain silicon, oxygen, 
and various metal atoms. Rocks, clays, and soils contain silicates. Their great diversity 
illustrates a theme that we have encountered since Chapter 1 of this book: the properties 
of substances are determined by their atomic and molecular structures. The structures of 
silicates determine their properties—and since these structures are varied, their proper-
ties are also varied. Some silicates form strong three-dimensional materials, whereas 
others break into sheets, and still others are highly fibrous. Let’s examine more closely 
several of these structures.
Quartz
Recall from Chapter 12 that silicon and oxygen form a network covalent structure in which a 
silicon atom bonds to four oxygen atoms, forming a tetrahedral shape with the silicon atom 
in the middle and the four oxygen atoms at the corners of the tetrahedron (Figure 23.3◀). 
As we examined in Chapter 12, the silicon atom bonds to each oxygen atom with a single 
covalent sigma bond. Recall that the silicon atom in this structure bonds to four oxygen 
atoms and obtains a complete octet. However, each oxygen atom is one electron short of 
an octet, so each O atom forms a second covalent bond to a different Si atom, forming the 
three-dimensional structure of quartz. Quartz has a formula unit of SiO2 and is generally 
called silica. Each Si atom is in a tetrahedron surrounded by four O atoms, and each O atom 
acts as a bridge connecting the corners of two tetrahedrons (Figure 23.4▼).
Aluminosilicates
Aluminosilicates are a family of compounds in which aluminum atoms substitute for 
silicon atoms in some of the lattice sites of the silica structure. Since the aluminum ion 
has only three valence electrons (in contrast to the four valence electrons 
of silicon), a SiO2 unit becomes AlO2
- upon substitution of aluminum. The 
negative charge is balanced by a positive counterion. A common group of 
aluminosilicates is the feldspars. The mineral albite is a feldspar. A mineral 
is a homogeneous, crystalline substance that naturally occurs in the Earth’s 
crust. In albite, one-fourth of the Si atoms are replaced by Al atoms. Na+ 
ions provide the necessary balancing positive charge. The formula for albite 
is Na(AlSi3O8), but it may be written as Na(AlO2)(SiO2)3 to illustrate the 
substitution of Al for Si.

Example 23.1	
Determining the Composition of an 
Aluminosilicate
Write the formula for anorthite, a crystal in which Al atoms substitute for one-
half of the Si atoms and the charge is balanced by Ca2+ ions.
Solution
The AlO2
- unit substitutes for one-half of the SiO2 units; therefore, the formula 
has equal numbers of AlO2
- and SiO2 units. You must balance every AlO2
- ion 
in the formula by a corresponding positive charge. Since Ca2+ has a 2+ charge, it 
can balance two AlO2
- units. Thus, the formula for anorthite is Ca(Al2Si2O8) or 
Ca(AlO2)2(SiO2)2.

Individual Silicate Units, Silicate Chains, and  
Silicate Sheets
In many silicate compounds, the oxygen atoms are not connected to two silicon atoms 
to form the neutral compound that is found in quartz. Instead, the oxygen atoms gain 
electrons from metal atoms and form polyatomic anions, such as SiO4
4-. The positively 
charged metal ions then bond to the negatively charged silicon oxide. In these minerals, 
the SiO4 tetrahedrons occur singly, in chains, or in sheets.
When a tetrahedron occurs singly (not bonded to other tetrahedrons), it forms the 
SiO4
4- polyatomic anion (which has four extra electrons that satisfy the octet rule for the 
four oxygen atoms). These types of silicates are orthosilicates (or nesosilicates) and 
require cations that have a total charge of 4+ to neutralize the negative charge. The cat-
ions can be of a single metal, such as Zn2+ in Zn2SiO4 (the mineral wil-
lemite), or they can be a mixture of different metals, such as the family 
of crystals called olivines [(Mg, Fe)2SiO4] where the Mg2+ and Fe2+ ions 
can exist in variable proportions, providing a total charge of 4+. All of 
these compounds are held together by ionic bonding between the 
metal cations and SiO4
4- polyatomic anions.
The silicate tetrahedrons can also form structures called 
­pyrosilicates (or sorosilicates) in which two tetrahedrons share one 
corner (Figure 23.5▶), forming the disilicate ion, which has the for-
mula Si2O7
6-. This group requires cations that balance the 6- charge 
on Si2O7
6-. Again, these cations can be the same metal ions or a mix-
ture of different metal ions. For example, in the mineral 
hardystonite (Ca2ZnSi2O7), two Ca2+ ions and one Zn2+ 
ion provide the 6+ charge.
The silicon tetrahedron also forms structures called 
pyroxenes (or inosilicates) in which many of the tetrahe-
drons bond together creating chains (Figure 23.6▶). The 
formula unit for these chains is the SiO3
2- unit, and the 
repeating unit in the structure is two formula 
units (Si2O6
4-). Two of the oxygen atoms are 
bonded to two silicon atoms (and thus to 
two other tetrahedrons) at two of the four 
corners of each tetrahedron. The silicate 
chains are held together by ionic bonding to

metal cations, which lie between the chains. For example, in the crystal diopside, 
CaMg(SiO3)2, Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions bond with the silicate chains.
Some silicate structures have double chains in which half of the tetrahedrons of one 
chain are bonded to tetrahedrons in another chain through oxygen atoms. The miner-
als with double silicate chains are called amphiboles, and the repeating unit in the crys-
tal is Si4O11
6- (Figure 23.7▲). Half of the tetrahedrons are bonded by two of the four 
corner O atoms, and half of the tetrahedrons are bonded by three of the four corners, 
joining the two chains together. The bonding within the double chains is very strong, 
but the bonding between the double chains is not so strong. This structure often results 
in fibrous minerals such as asbestos. An example of an asbestos-type mineral is tremo-
lite, Ca2(OH)2Mg5(Si4O11)2. In this crystal, hydroxide ions bonded to some of the metal 
cations help balance the charge between the cations and the anionic silicate chains.
When three of the four oxygen atoms are bonded between the silicate tetrahedrons, 
the sheet structure shown in Figure 23.8▼ results. These compounds are called phyllosili-
cates and have a formula unit of Si2O5
2-. Sheets of tetrahedral silicates are bonded 
together by metal cations that lie between the sheets. For example, the mineral talc, 
Mg3(Si2O5)2(OH)2, is a phyllosilicate. The weak 
interactions between silicate sheets give talc its 
slippery feel (this is similar to the way the weak 
interactions between sheets of carbon atoms 
give graphite its slippery feel). Table 23.2 sum-

Composition and Charge Balance of Silicates
The silicate chrysotile is an amphibole with the formula Mg6Si4O11(OH)x. Use 
charge balancing to calculate the value of x in the formula.
Solution
The silicate unit for amphiboles is Si4O11
6-. The formula has six Mg2+ ions for a 
total charge of 12+. To balance, you need to add another 6- charge to the 6- 
charge for the silicate. Therefore, add six OH- ions to the formula for chrysotile, 
giving a formula of Mg6Si4O11(OH)6.

	 23.4 	 Boron and Its Remarkable Structures
The group 3A elements each have a filled s sublevel and one electron in the p sublevel. 
This electron configuration prevents these main-group elements, especially boron, 
from easily attaining a full octet. Most of the elements in group 3A are metals; however, 
because of its small size and higher electronegativity, boron behaves as a semimetal. 
These characteristics endow boron with some special properties and result in a wide 
array of structures not common to most elements.
Elemental Boron
The structure of elemental boron is complex. Boron has at least five different allotropes 
(different structures with the same elemental composition). The structure of each allotrope 
is based on an icosahedron (Figure 23.9◀), a geometrical shape, containing 20 triangular 
faces joined at 12 vertices, that is very roughly spherical. Twelve boron atoms occupy the 
12 vertices. Each different allotrope connects the icosahedrons in different ways. They all 
have boron atoms outside the icosahedrons that bridge the icosahedrons together.
Boron is rare in Earth’s crust, making up less than 0.001% by mass. Yet because it is 
highly concentrated at various deposits around the world, it can be mined in large quanti-
ties. The largest deposit occurs at a mine in Boron, California, which has operated continu-
ously for over 135 years. Naturally occurring boron always occurs in compounds, and it is 
almost always bonded to oxygen. Among the major sources of boron are the sodium borates, 
which include borax, Na2[B4O5(OH)4] # 8 H2O, and kernite, Na2[B4O6(OH)2] # 3 H2O. 
Another major source of boron is calcium borate, or colemanite, Ca2B6O11 # 5 H2O. In all of 
these compounds, boron is bonded in polyatomic anions.
The primary use for boron today is in glass manufacture. Recall from Section 12.7 
that adding boron oxide to silicon oxide glass alters the thermal expansion of the glass, 
which is important for glassware intended for heating. When glass is heated, the outer 
edge of the glass warms and expands more quickly than the inner edge, creating stress 
that can result in cracking. Adding boron oxide to glass reduces its thermal expansion, 
allowing the glass (called borosilicate glass or Pyrex) to be heated without cracking.
Elemental boron is also used in the nuclear energy industry. Boron readily absorbs 
neutrons and is used in the control rods of nuclear reactors. When the nuclear reaction 
needs to be slowed down, the rods are inserted into the reactor to absorb the neutrons 
(see Section 20.7).
Boron–Halogen Compounds: Trihalides
Boron forms many covalently bonded compounds in which boron atoms bond to each 
other. In some ways, these compounds are similar to those in which carbon covalently 
bonds to itself; however, the structures are different because boron is less electronegative 
and has only three valence electrons. Recall from earlier in this section that elemental 
boron has a tendency to form polyhedral cluster structures. Boron also tends to form 
electron-deficient compounds (compounds in which boron lacks an octet).
Boron halides have the general formula BX3 and have a trigonal planar structure:
B
X
X
X
120°
The bonds in the boron trihalides are stronger and shorter than a typical single bond, 
which we can explain using valence bond theory and hybridization. The boron atom 
uses sp2 hybridized orbitals to form sigma bonds with the three halogen atoms. Because 
boron’s three valence electrons are used to form the sigma bonds, the third p orbital of 
boron is an empty orbital that is perpendicular to the trigonal plane of the molecule. 
Each halogen atom has a filled p orbital, also perpendicular to the trigonal plane of the 
molecule. The empty p orbital on the boron atom can overlap with the full p orbitals on

the halogens, forming a coordinate-covalent-type second bond. In BCl3, for example, 
the boron and chlorine are joined by bonds resembling a double bond. Like normal dou-
ble bonds, the boron–chlorine bond is shorter and stronger than a single bond.
The boron trihalides are strong Lewis acids. For example, BF3 reacts with NH3 
according to the following Lewis acid–base reaction:
BF3(g) + :NH3(g) ¡ F3B:NH3(s)
Boron trihalides act as Lewis acids in many organic reactions, such as those in which 
alcohols or acids are converted into esters. In water, the trihalides hydrolyze to form 
acidic solutions according to these reactions:
 BF3 + H2O ¡ BF3 # H2O ¡ BF3OH-(aq) + H+(aq)
 4 BF3 + 3 H2O ¡ 3 H+ + 3 BF4
-(aq) + B(OH)3(aq)
 BCl3 + 3 H2O ¡ B(OH)3(aq) + 3 H+(aq) + 3 Cl-(aq)
Boron–Oxygen Compounds
Boron forms very strong bonds with oxygen in structures that contain 
trigonal BO3 structures. The formula for the crystalline structure of boron 
and oxygen is B2O3. In this compound, the trigonal BO3 structures hook 
together to form interlocking B6O6 hexagonal rings (Figure 23.10 ▶). 
Each hexagonal ring has a boron atom at each of its six corners and 
an oxygen atom in the middle of each of the six sides. The compound 
B2O3 melts at 450 °C. If the molten B2O3 cools quickly, it forms a glass 
(an amorphous solid). The glass still contains many interlocking B6O6 
hexagonal rings but lacks the long-range order of the crystal. Molten 
boron oxide dissolves many metal oxides and silicon oxide to form 
glasses of many different compositions.
Boron–Hydrogen Compounds: Boranes
Compounds composed of boron and hydrogen, called boranes, form many unique 
cluster, cagelike, and netlike structures. The closo-boranes have the formula BnHn
2- 
and form fully closed polyhedrons with triangular sides; Figure 23.11▼ shows two of 
these structures. A boron atom, with an attached hydrogen atom, occupies each of the 
vertices in the polyhedrons. The closo-borane with the formula B12H12
2- forms the full 
icosohedral shape that elemental boron does, but it includes added hydrogen atoms.
If the borane polyhedron is missing one or more boron atoms, extra hydrogen atoms 
attach to the structure to make the borane neutral. Researchers have identified over 35 
structurally different neutral boranes, ranging from B2H6 to B20H26. We classify these 
neutral boranes on the basis of their different chemical formulas. The nido-boranes, 
named from the Latin word for nest, have the formula BnHn + 4. They consist of a cage of

for spiderweb, have the formula BnHn + 6. They consist of a cage of boron atoms that is 
missing two or three corners. Figure 23.12▲ shows examples of a nido- and an 
arachno-borane.
Boranes not only form interesting structures, but they are also valuable as catalysts 
in organic reactions. For example, adding an alkene to a diborane forms an alkane 
bonded to the boron atom. The alkane can be cleaved (split) from the boron, resulting in 
a net hydrogenation reaction such as the one shown here that can be carried out under 
mild (lower temperature) conditions:

	 23.5 	 Carbon, Carbides, and Carbonates
The group 4A elements exhibit the most versatile bonding of all elements. As we saw in 
Chapters 12 and 21, carbon has the ability to bond with other carbon atoms and with 
a few other elements to form a great variety of organic compounds. These compounds 
are the molecules of life, which we examined in Chapter 22. The different forms of 
elemental crystalline carbon were covered in Chapter 12 (see Section 12.6). Here we 
focus on amorphous carbon and those compounds of carbon that are known as inorganic 
(rather than organic).
Amorphous Carbon
Carbon occurs naturally in noncrystalline forms. Noncrystalline coal forms from the 
decomposition of ancient plant material that has been buried for millions of years, 
during which time it undergoes a process called carbonization. The carbonization 
reaction, which occurs under high pressure in the presence of water and the absence of 
air, removes most of the hydrogen and oxygen (which are lost as volatile gases such as 
methane and water) from the original organic compounds that composed the plant. The 
resulting coal contains a mixture of various hydrocarbons and carbon-rich particles. It is 
extensively mined and employed as an energy source throughout the world. Coal types 
are classified by the amount of carbon and other elements that they contain, as shown 
in Table 23.3.
Among the types of coal listed in Table 23.3, anthracite has the highest carbon con-
tent and consequently yields the most energy per mass when burned. Bituminous coal 
also contains a relatively high amount of carbon but has in addition high levels of sulfur, 
which results in increased formation of sulfur oxides when bituminous coal is burned. 
Sulfur oxides are the pollutants that create acid rain (see Sections 3.6 and 16.12).
Heating coal in the absence of air forms a solid called coke that is composed mainly 
of carbon and ash. Coke is used in the steel industry for the reduction of iron ore to iron.

In a blast furnace, the carbon in the coke is oxidized to form carbon monoxide, which 
reduces the iron in iron oxide according to these reactions:
O2(g) + C(s) ¡ CO2(g)
coke
CO2(g) + C(s) ¡ 2 CO(g)
coke
Fe2O3(s) + 3 CO(g) ¡ 2 Fe(s) + 3 CO2(g)
Heating wood in the absence of air produces charcoal. Like coal, charcoal contains 
a high amount of amorphous free carbon and is a common fuel for outdoor cooking 
grills. Charcoal retains the general overall shape of the original wood, but the process 
creates many voids, resulting in a much lower density. The voids within charcoal create 
high surface area that makes the charcoal useful for filtration. The impurities in a liquid 
or gas adsorb (or stick) on the charcoal surface as the liquid or gas flows through the 
pores in the charcoal.
Very fine carbon particles with high surface areas are called activated carbon, or 
activated charcoal. The large surface area of the particles, greater than 103 m2>g, makes 
activated carbon particles extremely efficient at adsorbing other molecules onto their 
surfaces. Activated carbon is made by heating amorphous carbon in steam, which 
breaks the grains into smaller sizes and removes any other materials adsorbed on the 
surface. Activated carbon is used to filter impurities from gas and as a decolorizing 
agent, removing impurities that discolor organic products such as sugar or wheat flour.

soot
Carbon black, a fine, powdered form of carbon, is a component of soot. Each day, over 
a million tons of carbon black, a strengthener for rubber tires, is used in manufacturing. 
The black color of automobile tires is due to the several kilograms of carbon black within 
each tire, accounting for over 25% of the mass of the typical tire.
Carbides
Binary compounds composed of carbon combined with less electronegative elements 
are carbides. We classify carbides into three general categories: ionic, covalent, and 
metallic. All types of carbides have some shared properties; they are extremely hard 
materials with high melting points.
Ionic Carbides
Compounds composed of carbon and a low-electronegativity metal such as an alkali metal 
or an alkaline earth metal are ionic carbides. Most ionic carbides contain the dicarbide 
ion, C2
2-, commonly called the acetylide ion. For example, calcium carbide has the formula 
CaC2 and a structure similar to that of NaCl (Figure 23.13▶, on the next page).
Calcium carbide forms by the reaction of calcium oxide with coke in an electric 
furnace:
CaO(s) + 3 C(s) ¡ CaC2(s) + CO(g)

1074	
Chapter 23  Chemistry of the Nonmetals
Ionic carbides react with water, forming acetylene. For example, sodium carbide reacts 
with water according to the reaction shown here:
Na2C2(s) + 2 H2O(l) ¡ 2 NaOH(aq) + C2H2(g)
In the past, calcium carbide was used as a source of acetylene (which is highly 
flammable) for lighting. The solid CaC2 reacts with water, releasing acetylene gas, 
which was burned in applications such as automobile headlights and lamps for mines. 
Transporting solid calcium carbide was more convenient and safer than transporting 
the flammable gas.

Covalent Carbides
Compounds composed of carbon and low-electronegativity nonmetals or metalloids are 
covalent carbides. The most important covalent carbide is silicon carbide (SiC), a very 
hard material. Over 500,000 tons of silicon carbide are produced annually, mostly for 
use as an abrasive material in the cutting and polishing of metals. In a process analogous 
to the formation of calcium carbide, silicon carbide forms by the reaction of silicon 
oxide with coke at high temperatures:
SiO2(s) + 3 C(s) ¡ SiC(s) + 2 CO(g)
A gem-quality form of SiC, called moissanite, has also been developed. Moissanite is 
described as being more brilliant than all other gems, including diamonds. Yet moissan-
ite costs much less than diamond and is consequently sold as a diamond substitute (like 
the more common diamond substitute cubic zirconia, ZrO2). Moissanite was first identi-
fied in small particles at the Diablo Canyon meteorite impact crater in Arizona and is 
sometimes advertised as “a gift from the stars.”
Metallic Carbides
Compounds composed of carbon and metals that have a metallic lattice with holes 
small enough to fit carbon atoms are metallic carbides. Metallic carbides retain many 
metallic properties, such as high electrical conductivity, but they are stronger, harder, 
and less malleable than their corresponding metals. Adding carbon to steel, for example,

increases its hardness by forming regions of cementite (Fe3C) in the steel matrix. 
Tungsten carbide (WC) is a metallic carbide used in cutting tools.
Carbon Oxides
Carbon forms two stable oxides, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Earth’s 
atmosphere contains about 0.04% carbon dioxide by volume. Plants use atmospheric 
carbon dioxide to produce sugars during photosynthesis:
6 CO2(g) + 6 H2O(g) ¡ C6H12O6(s) + 6 O2(g)
Carbon dioxide returns to the atmosphere via animal respiration, plant and animal 
decay, and (in modern history) fossil fuel combustion. Because carbon dioxide is highly 
soluble in water, the oceans of the world act as a reservoir for CO2, keeping the amount 
of CO2 in the atmosphere generally stable. As we saw in Section 6.10, however, the 
increase in the combustion of fossil fuels in the last century has increased the amount of 
CO2 in the atmosphere by about 38%.
Recall from Section 11.8 that CO2 has a triple point at -57  °C and 5.1 atm. At 
atmospheric pressure, therefore, the liquid phase of CO2 does not exist. Solid carbon 
dioxide sublimes directly to the gas phase when heated, which is why solid CO2 is called 
“dry ice.”
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. The boiling point 
of carbon monoxide is -192 °C at atmospheric pressure, and CO is only very slightly 
soluble in water. Carbon monoxide is toxic because it interferes with the ability of hemo-
globin to bind oxygen. Unlike carbon dioxide, which is very stable, carbon monoxide is 
relatively reactive and can be used as a reducing agent.
For example, carbon monoxide reacts with oxygen and metal oxides to form carbon 
dioxide:
 2 CO(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 CO2(g)
 CO(g) + CuO(s) ¡ CO2(g) + Cu(s)
Carbon monoxide also reduces many nonmetals, producing compounds with the 
reduced form of the nonmetal:
 CO(g) + Cl2(g) ¡ COCl2(g)
 CO(g) + S(s) ¡ COS(g)
The product of the first reaction listed is phosgene (COCl2), also known as carbonyl 
chloride, a poisonous gas that was used in World War I as a chemical weapon. Phosgene 
is now an important industrial chemical used in the production of polycarbonates. The 
product of the second reaction, carbonyl sulfide (COS), is a fungicide (a substance that 
kills fungi).
Carbonates
When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms carbonic acid (H2CO3). As a weak acid, 
carbonic acid partially ionizes into hydrogen carbonate (or bicarbonate) and carbonate:
CO2(aq) + H2O(l) ∆H2CO3(aq)
carbonic acid
H2CO3(aq) ∆H+(aq) + HCO3
-(aq) ∆2 H+(aq) + CO3
2-(aq)

Recall from Section 13.4 that the solubility of carbon dioxide, like that of other gases, 
increases with increasing pressure. Carbon dioxide under high pressure carbonates soft 
drinks. Under most conditions, less than 0.5% of the dissolved carbon dioxide reacts 
with water to form carbonic acid. This leaves most of the carbon dioxide as dissolved gas 
molecules, so the soft drink does not acquire much of a sour acidic taste.
The hydrated crystal of sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 # 10 H2O, is known as washing 
soda. Heating washing soda releases the waters of hydration, forming the stable anhydrous 
sodium carbonate, Na2CO3. All of the alkali metal ions form stable carbonates that remain 

1076	
Chapter 23  Chemistry of the Nonmetals
stable even when heated. The carbonates all make basic solutions when added to water 
because the carbonate ions readily ionize water (as described more fully in Section 16.8):
Na2CO3(s) ¡ 2 Na+(aq) + CO3
2-(aq)
CO3
2-(aq) + H2O(l) ¡ HCO3
-(aq) + OH-(aq)
Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is baking soda. When heated, baking soda gives off 
carbon dioxide gas, which is why its use in baking helps raise dough:
2 NaHCO3(s) ¡ Na2CO3(s) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)
Baking powder is a mixture of NaHCO3 and an acid. The two components of the mixture 
are kept from reacting by a starch filler. When water is added to the mixture, however, 
the two components dissolve and react, producing the carbon dioxide that forms pock-
ets of gas in baked products. You can perform a simple test to determine if baking powder 
is still good (that is, whether the acid has not already slowly reacted with the sodium 
bicarbonate) by pouring some boiling water over a small sample of the baking powder. If 
the hot water produces bubbles, then the baking powder is still active. Alka-Seltzer is 
another common consumer product that employs sodium bicarbonate, in this case 
mixed with citric acid and aspirin. When immersed in water, the acid and carbonate 
react to produce carbon dioxide, creating the familiar fizz.
▲ Alka-Seltzer™ contains sodium 
bicarbonate mixed with citric acid 
and aspirin. When put in water, the

	 23.6 	 Nitrogen and Phosphorus: Essential 
Elements for Life
The group 5A elements range from nonmetallic nitrogen and phosphorus to metallic 
bismuth. Both nitrogen and phosphorus are nonmetals; they do not conduct 
electricity, and they form acidic oxides. Both have s2p3 electron configurations, and 
yet their chemical properties are very different. Phosphorus is much larger and less 
electronegative; it also has d orbitals available for bonding.
Elemental Nitrogen and Phosphorus
Nitrogen was identified in 1772 and phosphorus in 1669. Elemental nitrogen is a diatomic 
gas that composes about 78% of Earth’s atmosphere by volume (see Section 5.6). To 
obtain elemental nitrogen, air is cooled below -196 °C, which causes it to liquefy. When 
the liquid air is warmed slightly, the nitrogen boils off, leaving liquid oxygen (which 
boils at the higher temperature of -183 °C). Passing the vaporized gas over hot copper 
metal purifies the nitrogen by removing residual oxygen (which reacts with the copper 
to form CuO). Nitrogen gas can also be separated from the other atmospheric gases by 
passing air through certain silicate materials called zeolites, which have channels of just 
the right diameter to separate gas molecules of different size. Some mineral sources for 
nitrogen are saltpeter (KNO3) and Chile saltpeter (NaNO3).
As we first saw in Section 9.5, nitrogen  molecules have a triple bond between the 
two N atoms. The strength of the triple bond makes N2 very stable, and attempts to 
break the bond have not been commercially successful. When nitrogen gas is heated

with oxygen or hydrogen, nitric oxide (NO) or ammonia (NH3), respectively, form with 
low yields. When nitrogen gas is heated with active metals, metal nitrides form. Aside 
from this, however, nitrogen gas is relatively unreactive.
The stability of elemental nitrogen makes it useful in creating a protective atmo-
sphere to prevent oxidation in many industrial processes. For example, industrial fur-
naces employ a nitrogen atmosphere to anneal (hold at elevated temperature below the 
melting point) products made of metal, and chemical reactions sensitive to oxygen are 
carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere. Nitrogen is also used to preserve a variety of foods.
Elemental phosphorus was first isolated by accident from urine when Henning 
Brand (1630–1710), a physician and alchemist from Hamburg, Germany, was distilling 
urine in an ill-informed attempt to obtain gold from the golden liquid. The elemental 
form of phosphorus that Brand obtained instead was a white, waxy, flammable solid 
called white phosphorus. White phosphorus is highly toxic to humans. For over a 
hundred years, urine was the main source for elemental phosphorus. Today, however, 
phosphorus is obtained from a calcium phosphate mineral called apatite, [Ca3(PO4)2]. 
The mineral is heated with sand and coke in an electric furnace:
2 Ca3(PO4)2(s) + 6 SiO2(s) + 10 C(s) ¡ P4(g) + 6 CaSiO3(l) + 10 CO(g)

white phosphorus
White phosphorus consists of P4 molecules in a tetrahedral shape, with the 
phosphorus atoms at the corners of the tetrahedron (Figure 23.14▶). The bond 
angles between the three P atoms on any one face of the tetrahedron are small 
(60°) and strained, making the P4 molecule unstable and reactive. White phos-
phorus spontaneously burns in air; it is normally stored under water to prevent 
contact with air.
When heated to about 300  °C in the absence of air, white phosphorus 
slightly changes its structure to a different allotrope called red phosphorus, 
which is amorphous. The general structure of red phosphorus is similar to that 
of white phosphorus, except that one of the bonds between two phosphorus 
atoms in the tetrahedron is broken (Figure 23.15▼). The two phosphorus atoms 
link to other phosphorus atoms, making chains that vary in structure.

Red phosphorus consists of chains of

Red phosphorus is neither as reactive nor as toxic as white phosphorus, and even 
though it is also flammable, it can be stored in air. Red phosphorus is used commercially 
in applications such as match heads. Rubbing a match head onto a surface produces 
enough heat (through friction) to ignite the phosphorus. Most strike-anywhere matches 
feature the phosphorus compound tetraphosphorus trisulfide (P4S3) and an oxidizing 
agent, potassium chlorate (KClO3).
A third allotrope of phosphorus is black phosphorus. Black phosphorus is 
obtained by heating white phosphorus under pressure. This form of phosphorus is the 
most thermodynamically stable form, and therefore the least reactive. Black phospho-
rus has a layered structure similar to that of graphite.

Nitrogen Compounds
Nitrogen, with a valence electron configuration of 2s22p3, can gain three electrons or 
lose five electrons to obtain an octet. Nitrogen forms many covalent compounds with 
oxidation states from -3 to +5, as shown in Table 23.4.
Nitrogen Hydrides
The most common nitrogen hydride is ammonia (NH3), the strong-smelling com-
pound in which nitrogen displays its lowest oxidation state (-3). Ammonia is important 
to humans because it reacts with sulfuric acid (or phosphoric acid) to produce ammo-
nium salts for fertilizers:
2 NH3(g) + H2SO4(aq) ¡ (NH4)2SO4(aq)
For hundreds of years, natural biological materials such as animal manure were used 
as nitrogen-containing fertilizers. In the 1800s, however, the nitrogen-bearing nitrate 
mineral NaNO3 was discovered in Chile (and named Chile saltpeter). This nitrate min-
eral became an important source of fertilizer and made the country of Chile very 
wealthy. However, because Chile saltpeter was a limited source, chemists were continu-
ally striving to develop a new source.
The obvious unlimited source of nitrogen is the atmosphere, but the strong triple 
bond in elemental nitrogen renders it unusable by plants. In order to be used as fertilizer, 
elemental nitrogen has to be fixed, which means that it has to be converted into a nitro-
gen-containing compound such as NH3. However, the direct reaction of nitrogen gas 
with hydrogen gas to form ammonia is very slow and produces low yields of ammonia 
under normal conditions:
N2(g) + 3 H2(g) ∆2 NH3(g)
In the early 1900s, German chemist Fritz Haber studied the equilibrium conditions 
for this reaction and showed that high pressures and lower temperatures favored the 
product. Carrying out the reaction at a higher pressure, and using a catalyst to increase 
the reaction rate, the industrial process for producing ammonia from nitrogen gas and 
hydrogen gas—now called the Haber–Bosch process—became practical by the mid-
1930s. This process is the main industrial process for making ammonia and fixing nitro-
gen for many uses, including fertilizers and explosives.
Hydrazine (N2H4) is another nitrogen and hydrogen compound in which nitrogen 
has a negative oxidation state (-2). Hydrazine is the nitrogen analog of hydrogen perox-
ide; it has a bond between nitrogen atoms that is similar to the bond between oxygen 
atoms in hydrogen peroxide (Figure 23.16◀). Hydrazine, like hydrogen peroxide, is a col-
orless liquid. However, while hydrogen peroxide is a powerful oxidizing agent, hydrazine 
is a powerful reducing agent, as shown in the following reactions:

The oxidation state of each atom appears directly below its symbol. Notice that in each

Hydrogen azide (HN3) is a nitrogen and hydrogen compound with a higher nitro-
gen-to-hydrogen ratio than ammonia or hydrazine. Ammonia and hydrazine are both 
basic:
 N2H4(aq) + H2O(l) ¡ N2H5
2+(aq) + OH-(aq)
  NH3(aq) + H2O(l) ¡ NH4
+(aq) + OH-(aq)

Since the rightmost structure has the least amount of formal charge, it contributes most

Hydrogen azide is thermodynamically unstable compared to its constituent ele-
ments and reacts explosively to produce hydrogen and nitrogen gas:
2 HN3(l) ¡ H2(g) + 3 N2(g)
The sodium azide salt is a stable solid at room temperature, but at elevated tempera-
tures, or with a spark, it quickly forms elemental sodium and nitrogen gas:
2 NaN3(s) ¡ 2 Na(l) + 3 N2(g)
The large volume of N2 gas that forms from a small volume of NaN3(s) is the basis for air-
bags in automobiles. However, pure sodium azide also forms liquid sodium, which is 
dangerous because of its high reactivity. Therefore, other components, such as KNO3 
and SiO2 are added to the mixture in airbags to react with the liquid sodium:
 10  Na(l) + 2 KNO3(s) ¡ K2O(s) + 5 Na2O(s) + N2(g)
 
 2 K2O(s) + SiO2(s) ¡ K4SiO4(s)
 2 Na2O(s) + SiO2(s) ¡ Na4SiO4(s)
The overall reaction produces the large volume of nitrogen gas required to fill an auto-
mobile airbag quickly, along with harmless potassium and sodium silicates.
Nitrogen Oxides
Under certain conditions, especially high temperatures, nitrogen is oxidized by oxygen 
to form a number of different oxides. For example, during lightning storms, nitrogen 
monoxide (NO) gas forms in the upper atmosphere:
N2(g) + O2(g) ˚˚˚
 
 "
lighting
 
 2 NO(g)
Other nitrogen oxides, such as nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen trioxide, form from the 
further oxidation of nitrogen monoxide:
 2 NO(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 NO2(g)
 NO(g) + NO2(g) ¡ N2O3(l)
All nitrogen oxides are thermodynamically unstable and eventually decompose into their 
constituent elements or react to form more stable compounds. However, many of these 
reactions are kinetically slow, so some nitrogen oxides persist for long periods of time.
The most important nitrogen oxide, because of its significance in biological systems, 
is probably nitrogen monoxide (NO), also called nitric oxide. In 1987, nitrogen monox-
ide was named molecule of the year by the journal Science because of several discoveries 
related to its biological functions. For example, NO helps control blood pressure through 
blood vessel dilation, it is important in memory and digestion, and it plays major roles in 
inducing male erections and female uterine contractions. The ability to adjust NO levels 
is a key role of the medications that treat erectile dysfunction (such as Viagra).
Earlier in this section, we learned that lightning forms NO in the atmosphere. In 
Sections 3.6 and 16.12 we saw that NO and NO2, formed as by-products of fossil fuel 
combustion, are among the important precursors of acid rain. Nitrogen monoxide and 
nitrogen dioxide are both reactive free radicals (they contain unpaired electrons). At low 
temperature, two NO2 molecules dimerize to form N2O4, pairing their two lone elec-
trons. If N2O4 is heated, it decomposes back to NO2. Consequently, the equilibrium 
between NO2 and N2O4 is highly temperature-dependent, as we saw in Section 15.9:

Chapter 23  Chemistry of the Nonmetals
Dinitrogen monoxide (N2O), also called nitrous oxide, is a good oxidizing agent. It 
can support the combustion of active metals:
Mg(s) + N2O(g) ¡ MgO(s) + N2(g)
Dinitrogen monoxide is unstable when heated, decomposing into nitrogen and oxygen 
gas:
2 N2O(g) ¡
heat 2 N2(g) + O2(g)
Dinitrogen monoxide (often referred to as “nitrous” or laughing gas) is used as an anes-
thetic by dentists and to pressurize food dispensers (such as whipped-cream dispensers). 
Commercially, N2O is produced by the decomposition of ammonium nitrate:
NH4NO3(aq) ¡
heat
 
N2O(g) + 2 H2O(l)
Nitric Acid, Nitrates, and Nitrides
Nitric acid is an important commercial product of nitrogen. In an electric furnace, nitric 
acid forms from nitrogen and oxygen gas:
2 N2(g) + 5 O2(g) + 2 H2O(g) ¡ 4 HNO3(g)
This reaction is thermodynamically favored, but it is kinetically slow. (What would hap-
pen to our atmosphere if this reaction were thermodynamically and kinetically favored?) 
Because of the slow speed of this reaction, a more efficient process, called the Ostwald 
process, is used to commercially produce nitric acid.
The first step of the Ostwald process involves passing ammonia gas over hot metal 
gauze at 600–700 °C to form NO gas. The gauze is made of metals such as platinum and 
rhodium that are good catalysts for this reaction:
4 NH3(g) + 5 O2(g) ˚˚˚
 
 "
catalyst
 
 4 NO(g) + 6 H2O(g)
Next, additional oxygen is added to oxidize the NO to NO2 gas, which is then passed 
through a water spray to form nitric acid:
3 NO2(g) + H2O(l) ¡ 2 HNO3(l) + NO(g)
These steps are similar to the natural process that forms acid rain from NO and NO2 gas 
in the atmosphere. The NO gas made during this last step can be recycled back to form 
more NO2 and eventually more HNO3.
Nitric acid is a strong acid that completely ionizes in water. Concentrated nitric acid 
is 70% nitric acid by mass, or 16 M. A small fraction of the HNO3 in a bottle of concen-
trated nitric acid will react with water to form NO2, a reddish brown gas that, in small 
amounts, gives the acid its characteristic pale yellow color:
4 HNO3(aq) ¡ 4 NO2(g) + O2(g) + 2 H2O(l)
The main commercial uses of nitric acid are in the production of fertilizers and 
explosives. Over a million tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer is produced annually by 
the reaction between ammonia and nitric acid:
NH3(g) + HNO3(aq) ¡ NH4NO3(aq)
Besides being a good fertilizer, ammonium nitrate and some other nitrates are also good 
explosives. Ammonium nitrate explodes according to the following reaction:
2 NH4NO3(s) ¡
heat
 
2 N2O(g) + 4 H2O(g) ¡ 2 N2(g) + O2(g) + 4 H2O(g)
Metal nitrates are responsible for the various colors seen in fireworks displays. The 
different metal ions emit different colors as the nitrate explodes in air. For example, cop-
per nitrate produces a green-colored light according to the reaction:
2 Cu(NO3)2(g) ¡
heat
 
2 CuO(s) + 4 NO2(g) + O2(g) + green light
As we learned in Chapter 4, nitrates  are very soluble in water. For reactions that 
need soluble metal cations, a nitrate compound is a good source for the cation without 
interference from the anion.

Nitrites are compounds containing the nitrite ion (NO2
-). Sodium nitrite is used as a 
food preservative because it kills Clostridium botulinum bacteria, the cause of botulism, 
and because it keeps meat from discoloring when the meat is exposed to air. Consumers 
have voiced concerns over this practice, both because it hides the true age of the meat and 
because the nitrites can react with amines in the meat to form compounds called nitrosa-
mines, which are suspected cancer-causing agents. However, no evidence exists to sup-
port the idea that nitrites at levels currently used in meats increase cancer risk in humans.
Phosphorus Compounds
Phosphorus has a valence electron configuration of 3s23p3, similar to that of nitrogen. 
Phosphorus also forms many compounds, with oxidation states ranging from -3 
through +5. The most stable compounds have the +5 oxidation state.
Phosphine
Phosphine (PH3) is a colorless, poisonous gas that smells like decaying fish. In phos-
phine, phosphorus has an oxidation state of -3. Since phosphorus is less electronega-
tive than nitrogen, phosphine is less polar than ammonia. Phosphine forms from the 
hydrolysis of metal phosphides:
Ca3P2(s) + 6 H2O(l) ¡ 2 PH3(g) + 3 Ca(OH)2(aq)
The disproportionation of white phosphorus in a basic solution can also produce 
phosphine:
2 P4 + 3 OH- + 9 H2O ¡ 5 PH3 + 3 H2PO4
-
When heated, phosphine decomposes to phosphorus and hydrogen:
4 PH3(g) ¡ P4(s) + 6 H2(g)
Like ammonia, phosphine can form phosphonium compounds such as PH4Cl and PH4I. 
Unlike ammonia, phosphine is not basic in aqueous solution.
Phosphorus Halides
When phosphorus reacts with the halogens, it forms phosphorus halides, the most 
important of which generally have the formulas PX3 and PX5:
 P4(s) + 6 Cl2(g) ¡ 4 PCl3(l)
 P4(s) + 10 Cl2(g) ¡ 4 PCl5(s)  (with excess chlorine)
Phosphorus halides react with water to form phosphoric acid and the corresponding 
hydrogen halide. For example, PCl3 reacts with water:
PCl3(l) + 3 H2O(l) ¡ H3PO4(aq) + 3 HCl(aq)
Reaction of PCl3 with oxygen at room temperature forms phosphorus oxychloride:
2 PCl3(l) + O2(g) ¡ 2 POCl3(l)
Other phosphorus oxyhalides form as a result of the reactions of POCl3 with metal 
­fluorides or iodides:
POCl3(l) + 3 NaI(s) ¡ POI3(g) + 3 NaCl(s)
The phosphorus halides and oxyhalides are important compounds in organic 
chemistry and serve as starting materials for the production of many phosphorus-­
containing compounds. Many of the key compounds in pesticides, oil additives, fire 
retardants for clothing, and surfactants (agents that act at surfaces), for example, are 
commercially made from phosphorus oxyhalides.
Phosphorus Oxides
White phosphorus reacts directly with oxygen to form phosphorus oxides, as in the 
reaction shown here:
P4(s) + 5 O2(g) ¡ P4O10(g)
Disproportionation is a reaction in 
which an element is both reduced and 
oxidized during the same reaction. 
In this equation the phosphorus in 
P4 is both oxidized and reduced. 
Phosphorus has an oxidation number 
of 0 in P4 and is reduced to -3 in PH3 
and oxidized to +5 in H2PO4
-.

Chapter 23  Chemistry of the Nonmetals
The product depends upon the amount of oxygen. Tetraphosphorus hexaoxide, P4O6(s), 
forms when oxygen is limited, and tetraphosphorus decaoxide, P4O10(s), forms when 
greater amounts of oxygen are available.
Phosphorus oxides form interesting cage structures (Figure 23.17▼). We can visual-
ize the P4O6 structure as a tetrahedron with a phosphorus atom at each of the vertices 
and an oxygen atom between each pair of phosphorus atoms. The P4O10 structure has 
four additional oxygen atoms bonded to each phosphorus atom at the vertices of each 
tetrahedron.
Phosphoric Acid and Phosphates
Phosphoric acid and phosphates are among the most important phosphorus-contain-
ing compounds. Phosphoric acid is a colorless solid that melts at 42 °C. Concentrated 
phosphoric acid is 85% phosphoric acid by mass, or 14.7 M. Phosphoric acid is produced 
from the oxidation of white phosphorus to tetraphosphorus decaoxide (see previous 
reaction), which is then reacted with water:
P4O10(s) + 6 H2O(l) ¡ 4 H3PO4(aq)
This method produces a very pure phosphoric acid. A less pure product forms from the 
reaction of calcium phosphate (a mineral source of phosphate) with concentrated 
­sulfuric acid:
Ca3(PO4)2(s) + 3 H2SO4(aq) ¡ 3 CaSO4(s) + 2 H3PO4(aq)
One direct use of phosphoric acid is rust removal. In steel production, thick steel 
slabs must be heated and rolled into thinner ones. During this process, the hot steel 
is exposed to air, which oxidizes the surface. To remove this rust, the thin steel sheets 
pass through phosphoric or hydrochloric acid baths, which dissolve the rust from 
the metal.
A major use of phosphoric acid is fertilizer production. In the past, phosphorus-
containing materials such as fish, bones, and bat guano were used as fertilizer. Sulfuric 
acid decomposes bones to make phosphorus compounds that are more readily taken up 
by plants. Today many different phosphorus compounds have been developed specifi-
cally as fertilizers for various types of plants.
Detergent manufacturers use sodium phosphate compounds as additives. Com-
pounds such as sodium pyrophosphate (Na4P2O7) and sodium tripolyphosphate 
(Na5P3O10) remove metal ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ from hard water, increasing the 
effectiveness of the detergent and preventing scum rings on sinks and tubs. However, 
phosphate compounds in detergents are being replaced by other compounds because of 
ecological problems—primarily the overfertilization of algae in bodies of water—associ-
ated with the phosphates.
Phosphoric acid and phosphates are also important chemicals in the food industry. 
Phosphoric acid is a soft drink additive. At a low concentration, phosphoric acid is non-
toxic and adds a tart, acidic taste to soft drinks. It also prevents bacterial growth in the 
soda. Table 23.5 summarizes the uses of phosphates in the food industry.

	 23.7 	 Oxygen
The group 6A elements have an s2p4 valence electron configuration and a strong 
attraction for electrons. They obtain a full octet by gaining only two more electrons. 
Because of its small size, oxygen is a much stronger oxidizing agent than the rest 
of the group 6A elements. Oxygen has the second highest electronegativity of any 
element (3.5), while the rest of the 6A elements range from 2.5 to 2.0. Because of its 
high abundance (almost half the mass of Earth’s crust is composed of oxygen) and its 
high reactivity, oxygen occurs in many common compounds, including metal oxides, 
carbonates, silicates, hydrates, and water. Oxygen is also critical for life; the oxidation of 
biomolecules by oxygen provides energy for most living systems on Earth.
Elemental Oxygen
Oxygen exists naturally as a colorless, odorless, diatomic, nonpolar gas. It condenses to 
a pale blue liquid at -183 °C. Oxygen is slightly soluble in water (0.04 g in 1 L or 0.001 
M at 25 °C). This rather low concentration of oxygen is enough to support life in aquatic 
environments. A few types of living systems that dwell deep in the ocean near vents that 
exude sulfur-containing fumes base their life processes on sulfur chemistry rather than 
oxygen chemistry.
Today, about 21% of Earth’s atmosphere is composed of O2, but this was not 
always the case. Earth’s early atmosphere was reducing (rather than oxidizing) and 
contained hydrogen, methane, ammonia, and carbon dioxide. About 2.7 billion years 
ago, cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) began to convert the carbon dioxide and water 
to oxygen by photosynthesis. It took hundreds of millions of years to reach the cur-
rent oxygen levels.
Joseph Priestley (1733–1804), an English scientist and minister, is credited with dis-
covering oxygen. In 1774, he isolated oxygen by focusing sunlight on mercury(II) oxide 
and collecting the gas that was released as the red powder oxide formed liquid mercury. 
He tested the gas by using it to make a candle burn more brightly. He carried out a num-
ber of experiments with oxygen over the years, including bravely breathing his new-
found gas. Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794) is credited with recognizing that oxygen is 
necessary for combustion. He described combustion as the reaction of a substance with 
oxygen (and not the loss of a substance). These discoveries and explanations were impor-
tant steps in the development of modern chemistry.
Oxygen is one of the most abundantly produced industrial chemicals. The major 
production method is the fractionation of air. Fractionation involves cooling air until its 
components liquefy. Then the air is warmed, and components such as N2 and Ar are sep-
arated out, leaving oxygen behind. Most commercial oxygen is stored and transported as 
a gas in tanks under high pressure. Another method for the production of oxygen is the 
electrolysis of water. Passing an electric current through water containing a small 
amount of an electrolyte produces hydrogen gas at the cathode and oxygen gas at the

under the ocean that provide energy

dwelling near the vents.

anode (see Section 19.8). Because of the large amount of electricity needed, however, 
electrolysis is not a cost-efficient method for oxygen production:

 2 H2(g) + O2(g)
In the laboratory, oxygen can be produced by heating and decomposing metal 
oxides and other oxygen-containing compounds. The oxides of mercury, silver, and gold 
lose all their oxygen when heated, while the oxides of other metals, such as barium, lose 
only some of their oxygen:
 2 HgO(s) ¡
heat 2 Hg(l) + O2(g)
 2 BaO2(s) ¡

Metal nitrates and chlorates also yield oxygen when heated. A catalyst, such as man-
ganese oxide or iron oxide, can make these reactions very fast and dangerous:

Uses for Oxygen
The greatest industrial use for oxygen is the enrichment of the air in a blast furnace for 
the conversion of high-carbon iron to steel. Large quantities of oxygen are also used in 
oxyhydrogen or oxyacetylene torches for the cutting of metals. In addition, oxygen is used to 
create artificial air for use underwater, during high-altitude travel, and in safety equipment.
Oxygen plays an important role in the treatment of a number of medical condi-
tions, such as acute and chronic lung diseases and heart disorders. Generally, patients 
use masks or nasal catheters to receive oxygen from a tank of compressed oxygen. How-
ever, portable oxygen concentrators have been developed that use molecular sieves to 
separate and concentrate oxygen from air. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the application 
of high oxygen levels to patients with skin wounds, such as those with skin grafts or 
hard-to-heal wounds associated with diabetes. The high oxygen level kills anaerobic bac-
teria that can infect such wounds.
Oxides
As a strong oxidizing agent, oxygen reacts with most other elements to form oxides. We 
classify oxides according to the oxidation state of oxygen in the oxide (Table 23.6). The 
type of oxide that forms depends on the size and charge of the metal. Regular oxides are 
more stable for the smaller ions with a higher charge. Superoxides are more stable for the 
larger ions with a smaller charge.

Oxygen also reacts with many nonmetals to form covalent compounds. Many of 
these nonmetals form several different binary oxides. For example, we have already seen 
that carbon forms CO and CO2 and that nitrogen forms N2O, NO, N2O3, NO2, N2O4, and 
N2O5.
Ozone
Ozone (O3), an allotrope of oxygen, is a toxic blue diamagnetic gas with a strong odor. 
People can detect the smell at levels as low as 0.01 ppm, and the odor is often noticed 
in electrical storms or near electrical equipment because the gas forms from O2 by an

electrical discharge. Ozone is denser than O2 and condenses to a deep blue liquid at 
-112 °C. Ozone is naturally made by the irradiation of O2 with ultraviolet light in the 
upper atmosphere:
3 O2(g) ˚˚˚˚
 
 "
UV radiation
 
 2 O3(g)
Ozone is also produced by passing O2 gas through an electric field. The volume of gas 
decreases as the O2 is converted to O3. Ozone is produced industrially by the electrolysis 
of cold concentrated sulfuric acid.
Thermodynamically unstable, ozone decomposes spontaneously to oxygen:
2 O3(g) ¡ 3 O2(g)
Ozone is used commercially as a strong oxidizing agent. For example, ozone can oxi-
dize NO2 to N2O5 or PbS to PbSO4:
 2 NO2(g) + O3(g) ¡ N2O5(g) + O2(g)
  PbS(s) + 4 O3(g) ¡ PbSO4(s) + 4 O2(g)
Ozone kills bacteria and is an environmentally safe replacement for chlorine in 
water-purification plants because the only by-product is O2. However, since ozone natu-
rally decomposes, it must constantly be replenished, an economic drawback that limits 
its use.
The air we breathe contains ozone because it forms as a by-product of fossil fuel 
combustion. Since it is a strong oxidizing agent, it is a harmful substance. In the lower 
atmosphere, ozone damages the lungs and skin, stings the eyes, and damages most plant 
and animal tissues. Ozone also reacts with many types of plastic and rubber materials, 
causing them to become brittle and to crack.
As we also saw in Section 6.10, the  layer of ozone in the upper atmosphere plays an 
important role in the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. It absorbs 
the UV radiation and breaks apart to O2 and O. This oxygen atom will often react with 
another O2 molecule to re-form as ozone. During this cycle, each ozone molecule 
absorbs many ultraviolet photons. Recall from Section 3.9 that the  ozone layer has been 
depleted by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). However, legislation has banned CFCs in the 
hope that their reduction will help the ozone layer to recover.
	 23.8 	 Sulfur: A Dangerous but Useful Element
Like oxygen, sulfur is a nonmetal that belongs to the 6A family. However, sulfur’s 3p 
orbitals extend farther out from the nucleus than do oxygen’s 2p orbitals. Consequently, 
sulfur is larger and is a much weaker oxidizing agent than oxygen. 
Unlike oxygen, which forms compounds with only negative 
oxidation states, sulfur forms compounds with both negative and 
positive oxidation states. Sulfur, selenium, and tellurium generally 
form covalent compounds with +4 or +6 oxidation states, forming 
anions only when bonding with highly electropositive metals. 
Sulfur is also much less abundant than oxygen, yet it still composes 
about 0.06% of the mass of Earth’s crust.
Elemental Sulfur
Elemental sulfur occurs in a few natural deposits, mostly deep 
underground in the Gulf Coast area of the United States and 
in eastern Europe. These deposits are believed to have formed 
as a by-product of anaerobic bacteria that decomposed sulfur-
containing minerals over many years. The Frasch process, 
which allows us to recover sulfur from the earth, is diagrammed 
in Figure 23.18▶. Superheated water and compressed air are 
forced down long pipes into the sulfur deposits. The hot water 
melts the sulfur, which is pushed up to the surface along with

the hot water through a third pipe. Some sulfur deposits also occur at Earth’s 
surface—often in hot springs—where volcanic activity has made the sulfur accessible 
(Figure 23.19▲).
Sulfur has several allotropes; the most common naturally occurring allotrope of 
sulfur is composed of an S8 ring structure called cyclooctasulfur. Most of the differ-
ent allotropes have ring structures with rings ranging in size from S6 to S20. When 
heated above its melting point of 112 °C, cyclooctasulfur forms a straw-yellow liquid 
with low viscosity. Above 150 °C, the rings begin to break, and the sulfur becomes a 
darker, more viscous liquid as the broken rings entangle one another. The color is 
darkest at 180 °C when the liquid becomes very viscous and pours very slowly, as can 
be seen in the accompanying photo. Above this temperature, however, the intermo-
lecular forces between the S8 chains weaken, and the liquid becomes less viscous 
again. If the hot liquid is poured into cold water, the sulfur will quench into an 
amorphous solid (Figure 23.20▲). Initially, this amorphous material is flexible like a 
plastic, but it hardens into a brittle solid.
The Frasch process, while important, provides less than one-third of the world’s sul-
fur; sulfur is a by-product of a number of other industrial processes and is thus recovered 
from them. For example, dihydrogen monosulfide (H2S), which is commonly called 
hydrogen sulfide, is a component of natural gas. The H2S is separated from the other 
components by passing the gas through organic solvents such as ethanolamine. The H2S 
dissolves in the organic solvent:
HOC2H4NH2(l) + H2S(g) ¡ HOC2H4NH3
+(solvent) + HS-(solute)
	
ethanolamine
The H2S is recovered and oxidized to elemental sulfur through a two-step process—the 
Claus process—that accounts for over 50% of all sulfur produced:
 2 H2S(g) + 3 O2(g) ¡ 2 SO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)
 4 H2S(g) + 2 SO2(g) ¡ 6 S(s) + 4 H2O(g)
The third major source of sulfur production is metal sulfide minerals, such as the 
mineral iron(II) disulfide (also known as iron pyrite). Roasting iron pyrite in the absence 
of air causes the sulfur to disproportionate (react with itself) to form iron(II) sulfide and 
elemental sulfur:
2 FeS2(s) ¡
heat 2 FeS(s) + S2(g)
Alternatively, the metal sulfide can be roasted in air to oxidize the metal sulfide. The sul-
fur is then removed as sulfur dioxide:
2 ZnS(s) + 3 O2(g) ¡ 2 ZnO(s) + 2 SO2(g)

can also be found at Earth’s surface where volcanic activity

Hydrogen Sulfide and Metal Sulfides
Hydrogen sulfide, a component of natural gas, is toxic and forms by the reactions of 
anaerobic bacteria on organic substances. Rotting vegetation and bogs are natural 
sources of H2S for the atmosphere. Fortunately, we can detect the odor of H2S (a rotten 
egg smell) at concentrations as low as 0.02 ppm, which pose no threat to our health. 
Levels as low as 10 ppm can cause nausea, and 100 ppm can cause death. The smell of 
H2S becomes more difficult to detect at high levels because H2S also has an anesthetic 
effect that dulls the sense of smell. Consequently, the sudden onset of strong H2S odor is 
a reason to move quickly to fresh air.
It might initially seem that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) would share chemical properties 
with water (H2O), but it does not. Water has a larger bond angle (104.5°) than hydrogen 
sulfide (92.5°) and is much more polar. Because of its polarity, water forms strong hydro-
gen bonds, whereas hydrogen sulfide does not. In addition, the O¬ H bond is much 
stronger than the S¬ H bond. These differences result in a far lower boiling point and 
greater reactivity for hydrogen sulfide compared to water. Water is a stable molecule in 
the presence of air and oxygen. Hydrogen sulfide burns in air, reacting with oxygen to 
form elemental sulfur or sulfur oxides.

Hydrogen sulfide forms from the reactions of metal sulfides with hydrochloric acid:

Only a few of the metal sulfides, those with group 1A and 2A metals and Al, are very sol-
uble in water. Some common metal sulfides and their solubility product constants are 
listed in Table 23.7. The low solubility of these sulfides allows the use of H2S as a good 
analytical method to determine whether metal ions are present in a solution. Sodium 
sulfide is used to precipitate toxic metals from industrial waste sources.

1088	
Chapter 23  Chemistry of the Nonmetals
Metal sulfides have a number of industrial uses, mostly because they are toxic to 
bacteria. For example, SeS2 is a shampoo additive that kills bacteria and controls dan-
druff, and As2S3 kills parasites.
Sulfur Dioxide
Sulfur dioxide is another toxic sulfur compound. Under standard conditions, it is a 
colorless, dense gas that has an acidic taste. The acidic taste results from the reaction of 
the gas with the water in your mouth:
SO2(g) + H2O(l) ¡ H2SO3(aq)
Sulfur dioxide forms naturally during volcanic activity when sulfides oxidize in the 
high volcanic temperatures. Sulfur dioxide is also a pollutant that forms during many 
industrial processes, such as coal and oil combustion and metal extraction. As we have 
seen, when the sulfur dioxide is emitted into the air, it reacts with oxygen and water to 
produce acid rain:
2 SO2(g) + 2 H2O(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 H2SO4(aq)
Sulfuric acid as a pollutant is destructive to plants, animals, and man-made structures 
(see Section 16.12).
To prevent the release of SO2 into the atmosphere, industrial processes “scrub” 
their emissions to remove the SO2. The exhaust gas flows through stacks lined with 
calcium carbonate that, when heated, capture sulfur oxides in the form of calcium 
sulfate dust:
CaCO3(s) ¡
heat
 
CaO(s) + CO2(g)
2 CaO(s) + 2 SO2(g) + O2(g) ¡ 2 CaSO4(s)
The CaSO4 dust is collected and disposed of. New uses for the tons of waste CaSO4, such 
as discarded fireproof insulation, are needed.
One use for SO2 capitalizes on its toxicity. Food producers spray fruits and other veg-
etation with a solution containing SO2 to kill mold and preserve the fruit. As a result, the 
fruits and vegetables can be shipped throughout the world, making it possible for inhab-
itants of the Northern Hemisphere to enjoy summer fruits (from the Southern Hemi-
sphere) in the winter.
Sulfuric Acid
The most important use of sulfur and its compounds is the production of sulfuric 
acid. In fact, sulfuric acid is the most abundantly produced chemical in the world 
because it is a strong acid, a strong oxidizing agent, and a good dehydrating agent. 
It is also plentiful and inexpensive. Sulfuric acid is used in fertilizers, color dyes, 
petrochemicals, paints, plastics, explosives, battery, steel, and detergent industries, to 
name just a few.
Pure H2SO4 melts at 10.4  °C and boils at 337  °C. At room temperature, it is an oily, 
dense liquid. Sulfuric acid reacts vigorously and exothermically with water. Pure or con-
centrated H2SO4 must be added to water slowly to avoid rapid heating, boiling, and 
splattering:
H2SO4(l) ¡
H2O(l )
 
H2SO4 (aq)  highly exothermic
The strong attraction between sulfuric acid and water makes sulfuric acid a very strong 
dehydrating agent. As shown in Figure 23.21◀, its affinity for water is strong enough to 
decompose some organic materials, such as sucrose:
C12H22O11(s) + H2SO4(l) ¡ 12 C(s) + 11 H2O(g) + H2SO4(aq)
Sulfuric acid is produced industrially by a method known as the contact process, 
developed in the early twentieth century. In this method, elemental sulfur is first heated 
in air to form SO2 gas, which is then heated in contact with a V2O5 catalyst to form SO3 
gas:

The SO3 gas is absorbed into concentrated sulfuric acid, producing a dense form of 
sulfuric acid called oleum, H2S2O7, which produces H2SO4 when dissolved in water:
 SO3(g) + H2SO4(l) ¡ H2S2O7(l)
 H2S2O7(l) + H2O(l) ¡ 2 H2SO4(aq)
As we have already seen, sulfuric acid is used in fertilizer production, which consumes a 
significant amount of the sulfuric acid produced.
	 23.9 	 Halogens: Reactive Elements with High 
Electronegativity
The halogens are all one electron short of a noble gas electron configuration. They are 
the most electronegative elements in their respective periods and are therefore very 
reactive. They do not naturally occur in their elemental form. The source of most of the 
halogens (except fluorine) is the dissolved salts present in seawater. The major sources 
for fluorine are several different minerals, including fluorspar (CaF2) and fluoroapatite 
[Ca10F2(PO4)6].
We have already seen some of the properties of the halogens, especially those that 
exhibit periodic trends, in Section 8.9. For example, the atomic radius of the halogens 
increases regularly from fluorine to iodine, as shown in Table 23.8. Due partly to its small 
size, fluorine has the highest electronegativity of all elements and is always found in oxi-
dation states of -1 or 0. The other halogens can be found with oxidation states ranging 
from -1 to +7. The positive oxidation states occur when a halogen bonds to more elec-
tronegative elements such as fluorine or oxygen.

Elemental Fluorine and Hydrofluoric Acid
Fluorine is the most reactive element and forms binary compounds with all elements 
except He, Ne, and Ar. Fluorine even forms compounds with some of the noble gases, 
producing compounds such as XeF2, XeF6, and XeOF4. The high reactivity of fluorine is 
related to several factors. First, the F ¬ F bond is among the weakest halogen–halogen 
bonds, as shown in Table 23.9. In order for a halogen to react with other substances, the 
halogen–halogen bond must break. The energy required to break that bond is small for 
F2, so the resulting reaction is more exothermic. Second, the small size of fluorine results 
in a high lattice energy for the ionic compounds that it forms. The high lattice energy 
means the compounds are very stable.

The high reactivity of fluorine is illustrated by its ability to burn (or quickly oxidize) 
many substances, such as iron and sulfur, that do not readily burn with oxygen:
   Fe(s) + F2(g) ¡ FeF2(s)
 S(s) + 3 F2(g) ¡ SF6(g)
Fluorine gas even reacts with asbestos and glass, two materials commonly used as con-
tainers for reactive substances. Consequently, fluorine is normally held in metal con-
tainers made of iron, copper, or nickel. These metals also initially react with fluorine, 
but then a thin layer of the product coats the surface of the metal, protecting the under-
lying metal from further reaction.
Elemental fluorine is produced from the electrolysis of hydrofluoric acid, forming F2 
and H2 gases:
Oxidation:	
 2 F-(g) ¡ F2(g) + 2 e-
Reduction:	
 2 H+(g) + 2 e- ¡ H2(g)
Gaseous hydrogen fluoride can be obtained from the reaction of the mineral fluor-
spar 1CaF22 with sulfuric acid:
CaF2(s) + H2SO4(l) ¡ 2 HF(g) + CaSO4(s)
In its solid form, HF has a crystal structure that contains zigzag chains of alternating 
H and F atoms. In aqueous solutions, HF is a weak acid (Ka = 3.5 * 10-4 for HF at 298 K). 
Like all anions in aqueous solution, the F- ions from ionized HF are solvated by water 
molecules. However, the F- ions can also associate with other HF molecules to form HF2
-.

The structure of HF2

gen atom (a hydrogen atom that essentially forms two bonds):

Hydrofluoric acid is a strong oxidizing agent and reacts with glass according to the 
following reactions:
SiO2(s) + 4 HF(aq) ¡ SiF4(g) + 2 H2O(l)
or:
SiO2(s) + 6 HF(aq) ¡ SiF6
2-(aq) + 2 H+(aq) + 2 H2O(l)
As a result, hydrofluoric acid cannot be held in a glass container and is generally stored 
in plastic. The ability of HF to react with glass makes it useful in etching glass. The parts 
of the glass to be etched are left exposed, and the rest of the surface is masked with a 
nonreactive substance such as plastic. The surface is then exposed to hydrofluoric acid

and the nonmasked glass etches away, leaving the desired pattern. Hydrofluoric acid is 
particularly dangerous because it quickly penetrates into tissues, damaging internal 
organs and bones. Direct exposure of just 2% of body surface area to concentrated hydro-
fluoric acid can be fatal.

Halogen Compounds
Halogens form ionic compounds with most metals, they form covalent compounds 
with many nonmetals, and they can bond with other halogens to form interhalogen 
compounds. Here we look at some of the compounds halogens form.
Interhalogen Compounds
Covalent compounds composed of two different halogens are known as interhalogen 
compounds or interhalides. The general formula of these compounds is ABn, where A is 
the larger halogen, B is the smaller halogen, and n is 1, 3, 5, or 7. The smaller halogens 
surround the larger halogen in the AB3 compounds. The only known AB5 compounds 
contain fluorine as the smaller halogen (because the other halogens are too large for five 
of them to fit around another halogen). The compound IF7 is the only known interhalo-
gen compound with n = 7. The large size of the iodine atom allows seven small fluorine 
atoms to surround it. The interhalides can be formed by reacting the elemental halogens 
with one another. Interhalide polyatomic ions, such as ICl2
+ and ICl4
-, also exist.
Example 23.7	
Formation of Interhalogen Compounds
Write the balanced equation for the formation of ClF3 gas from the elemental 
halogens.
Solution
The unbalanced reaction is:
Cl2(g) + F2(g) ¡ ClF3(g)
At least two ClF3 molecules form from each Cl2 molecule; therefore, add a 2 before 
ClF3 and then a 3 before F2. The balanced equation is:
Cl2(g) + 3 F2(g) ¡ 2 ClF3(g)
For Practice 23.7  Write a balanced equation for the formation of IF5 gas from 
the elemental halogens.
The geometry of the interhalides can be predicted from the valence shell electron 
pair repulsion model (VSEPR). Because the halogens do not form double or triple bonds, 
the shapes of these compounds are relatively straightforward to determine, as shown in 
Examples 23.8 and 23.9.

The only industrially useful interhalide is ClF3, employed in the nuclear energy 
industry to produce UF6(g), which is used to separate 235U (61% of naturally occurring 
uranium) from 238U. Uranium ores react with gaseous hydrogen fluoride to form UF4(s), 
which reacts with ClF3(g) to form the gaseous uranium compound:
UO2(s) + 4 HF(g) ¡ UF4(s) + 2 H2O(g)
   UF4(s) + ClF3(g) ¡ UF6(g) + ClF(g)
Because of the difference in mass between the two isotopes, 238UF6 effuses more slowly 
than 235UF6 (see Section 5.9 for a description of effusion). The mixture of gases is allowed 
to flow through barriers with very small pores. Since 235UF6 effuses more quickly, the 
initial flow of gas that exits the pores is enriched in 235UF6. By repeating the process, the 
two isotopes can be nearly completely separated.
Halogen Oxides
Most halogen oxides are unstable, and many are explosive. A unique halogen oxide 
is OF2; oxygen usually has a negative oxidation state in its compounds but has a +2 
oxidation state in OF2 (due to the high electronegativity of fluorine).

A number of different chlorine oxides are known, including Cl2O, ClO2, Cl2O6, and 
Cl2O7. Chlorine dioxide is a powerful oxidizing agent used to bleach flour and wood 
pulp (to make white paper). Because ClO2 is explosive, the gas is diluted with CO2 or N2 
for safety. Some water treatment plants use ClO2 for water disinfection in place of Cl2. 
ClO2 is produced by the oxdiation of sodium chlorite with Cl2 or by the reduction of 
sodium chlorate with hydrochloric acid:
2 NaClO2(aq) + Cl2(g) ¡ 2 NaCl(aq) + 2 ClO2(g)
2 NaClO3(aq) + 4 HCl(aq) ¡ 2 ClO2(g) + Cl2(g) + 2 H2O(l) + 2 NaCl(aq)
Example 23.10	
Identifying Changes in Oxidation States
Identify the change of oxidation state for Cl in the production of chlorine dioxide 
from sodium chlorite. Identify the oxidizing agent and the reducing agent.
Solution
First determine the oxidation state of Cl in each compound.
2 NaClO2(aq) + Cl2(g) ¡ 2 NaCl(aq) + 2 ClO2(g)
	
+1 +3 -2	
0	
+1 -1	
  +4 -2
The Cl in the NaClO2 was oxidized from +3 to +4 by the oxidizing agent Cl2, 
which was reduced from 0 to -1 by the reducing agent NaClO2.
For Practice 23.10  Identify the change of oxidation state for Cl in the 
production of chlorine dioxide from sodium chlorate. Identify the oxidizing agent 
and the reducing agent.

Key Concepts
Bonding and Properties (23.2)
▶
▶Main-group elements are defined by their electron configurations 
and their location on the periodic table.
▶
▶The properties of the main-group elements show great diversity. 
Metals, nonmetals, and metalloids are all found among the main-
group elements.
▶
▶Some main-group elements form covalent bonds while others 
form ionic bonds.
The Most Common Matter: Silicates (23.3)
▶
▶Silicates (found in rocks, clays, and soils) are covalent atomic sol-
ids that contain silicon, oxygen, and various metal atoms.
▶
▶Silicate structures consist of four oxygen atoms bonded to silicon, 
forming a negatively charged polyatomic anion with a tetrahedral 
shape. Various metal ions within the structure balance the charge 
of the compound.
▶
▶The SiO4 tetrahedrons can link to form chains, double chains, 
sheets, or even extended three-dimensional structures.
▶
▶The properties of the silicates depend on the connections between 
the silicate tetrahedrons. Because of the wide variety of combina-
tions of tetrahedron connections and the many different metal 
ions that fit within the structure, an enormous variety of different 
silicate minerals exist in nature, making the silicate materials the 
most common structures found on Earth.
Boron (23.4)
▶
▶Because of its small size and high electronegativity, boron behaves 
as a metalloid.
▶
▶The structure of elemental boron consists of icosahedron struc-
tures bonded together in various ways.
▶
▶Boron tends to form electron-deficient compounds.
▶
▶Compounds of boron and hydrogen form cluster compounds re-
sembling spheres, cages, and nets.
Carbon (23.5)
▶
▶Organic chemistry is based on the chemistry of carbon, and 
­carbon is also very important in many inorganic compounds and 
applications. Important types of amorphous elemental carbon in-
clude carbon black and coke.
▶
▶Important types of inorganic carbon compounds include carbides 
and carbonates. Carbon can form carbides with metallic, covalent, 
or ionic properties.
▶
▶Carbon and its oxygen compounds are intimately involved in the 
functions of life.
Nitrogen and Phosphorus (23.6)
▶
▶Nitrogen and phosphorus have been known for over 200 years; 
both form compounds, with oxidation numbers ranging from -3 
up to +5.
▶
▶Both nitrogen and phosphorus compounds are critical for plant 
growth; their most important use is as fertilizers. The strong triple 
bond between nitrogen atoms in N2 makes nitrogen from the at-
mosphere inaccessible to most plants, so ingenious chemical pro-
cesses have been devised to make nitrogen compounds that are 
more available to plants.
Oxygen (23.7)
▶
▶Oxygen is the most common element on Earth. It is found in the 
atmosphere as the elemental gas and as many oxide gases.
▶
▶Oxygen is found in ocean water and in Earth’s crust as silicate and 
oxide compounds. Oxygen is a strong oxidizing agent and forms 
compounds with -1
2, -1, or -2 oxidation states.
▶
▶Ozone, O3, is a helpful molecule in the upper atmosphere, where 
it absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation, but it is a harmful mol-
ecule at Earth’s surface.

Sulfur (23.8)
▶
▶More sulfuric acid is produced than any other chemical; most of it 
is used to make fertilizers. Other uses take advantage of its strong 
oxidation and dehydration properties.
▶
▶Elemental sulfur has several allotropes ranging from ring struc-
tures to chain structures and amorphous materials, depending 
upon temperature.
Halogens (23.9)
▶
▶The halogens are the most electronegative elements, so they are 
always found as compounds, usually ionic. When the halogens 
bond with other electronegative elements, however, they can 
form covalent compounds.
▶
▶Fluorine has special chemical properties because it is the most 
electronegative element and is very small, making it a very strong 
oxidizing agent.
▶
▶Interhalogen compounds are formed between two halogens, with 
the larger halogen as the central atom of the structure.

which gem has the most interesting structure?

	109. 	As a group, create a single schematic drawing of a factory that 
uses the Haber-Bosch process and the Ostwald process to make 
NH4NO3 fertilizer. The factory may only take in N2(g), H2(g), 
and O2(g). Pass your diagram around the group and have each 
group member add one step in the process. Where might the 
factory obtain H2?
	110. 	Ask each group member to work individually to write out two or 
three reactions from one section of the chapter. Replace the 
symbol for the element that is the topic of that section with a 
blank or an X. Take turns playing “identify the mystery ele-
ment” as follows. One person shares their reactions (with the 
blanks) with the group. The person to the right of the person 
sharing tries to identify the missing element. If that person 
can’t, the group member to the right tries. Continue until ei-
ther the element has been identified or all group members have 
had a chance. The next round starts with the person who was 
first to guess the element sharing reactions with the group. 
Continue until all have shared reactions, and all reactions have 
been correctly identified.
	111. 	Working individually, find a sentence in the chapter that 
uniquely describes a particular main-group compound. As in 
the previous question, take turns reading your sentences to the

Data Interpretation and Analysis
Hydrogen Sulfide in Well Water
	112.	Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) smells like rotten eggs, and its smell can 
be detected at concentrations as low as 0.02 ppm. Well water, 
which is drawn from underground depths of 30–250 meters 
(100–800 feet), is commonly contaminated with hydrogen sul-
fide. The contamination arises from bacterial decomposition of 
sulfur-containing organic and inorganic matter present in the 
oxygen-deficient underground environment. Some H2S gas dis-
solves in the water that is pumped for drinking supplies, where 
it is detected by taste at concentrations as low as 0.05 ppm. 
­Municipalities remove H2S to improve water taste and to pre-
vent the accumulation of toxic H2S gas within the system.
Table a lists hydrogen sulfide solubility in water when the 
partial pressure of hydrogen sulfide is 1.00 atm. Table b lists 
­solubility product constant data for common metal sulfides.

oxygen transport by some ancient 
life-forms on Earth.
I
f you look around your house, classroom, or neighborhood, much of what you see is 
made of metal or at least has some metal parts. Can you imagine life without metals? 
Without metals, we would have no skyscrapers, which need the rigid framework of 
steel beams; no automobiles, which need metal engines and bodies; and no electricity, 
which needs copper and aluminum wire for transmission. Metallurgy is both a very old 
and a very new science. We find the roots of metallurgy in the distant past, when our 
primitive ancestors began to search for and process metals. Of the three prehistoric ages 
of humankind—the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age—two are named after 
our quest for metals. But we do not commonly find metals as elements on Earth; instead 
we find them in compounds, often scattered within other compounds. The mining, 
separating, and refining of the vast array of metals is a fairly new science. Many modern 
metals were not available even as recently as 200 years ago. In the middle of the nine-
teenth century, gold was cheaper than aluminum because aluminum was so difficult to 
refine, and titanium, which is important in the aerospace industry, could not even 
be manufactured. In this chapter, we cover the area of chemistry known as metallurgy.
	 24.1	 Vanadium: A Problem and an Opportunity
Companies often seek help from university researchers to solve specific technical 
problems. In one case, representatives of an oil company sought help from a university’s 
chemistry and engineering departments to address vanadium contamination in oil. 
Because vanadium is toxic, the U.S. government regulates the quantity of vanadium 

1102	
Chapter 24  Metals and Metallurgy
that can be emitted by industrial processes, and oil companies have to figure out 
environmentally acceptable ways to remove the vanadium from the oil.
Vanadium is a rare element, making up only about 0.015% of Earth’s crust (by mass). 
It is a soft white metal with high ductility and malleability, which means that it can be 
easily drawn into narrow wires or rolled into thin sheets. Because of the high reactivity 
of pure vanadium, this element occurs naturally within compounds (not in its elemen-
tal form). However, vanadium compounds are not normally found in the rocks or soils 
near oil fields, so why does this rare, reactive metal occur in oil? The answer lies in the 
biology of ancient life-forms. Most modern animals use iron in hemoglobin to transport 
oxygen through their bloodstreams (see Section 15.1), and a few (such as lobsters) use 
copper for this function. It appears that some extinct animals used vanadium. Even 
today, one group of simple marine organisms, the tunicates or sea squirts, are believed to 
employ vanadium compounds for oxygen transport. The source of vanadium in some 
crude oil may be the very animals from which the oil was formed.
During refining, crude oil is heated to carry out the reactions that form the different 
petroleum products. If some of the vanadium-containing oil burns during heating, the 
vanadium forms vanadate compounds, ionic compounds with vanadium oxide poly-
atomic ions such as VO4
3- and VO3
-. These compounds, which have low melting points, 
can dissolve the protective oxide coatings on stainless steel containers, causing the steel 
to corrode and ruining the containers in which the oil is stored. If the vanadium com-
pounds are not removed from the oil before storage, the customer inherits the problem. 
In addition, vanadium and many of its compounds are toxic, so oil companies cannot 
simply dump the extracted vanadium compounds into the environment.
The presence of vanadium in crude oil may, however, turn out to be profitable for 
the oil companies. If vanadium can be economically recovered from oil, then oil could 
become a major source of vanadium, a valuable metal with several important industrial 
uses, including the production of iron alloys and sulfuric acid.
The recovery of vanadium from oil involves metallurgy, the topic of this chapter. 
Metallurgy includes all the processes associated with mining, separating, and refining 
metals and the subsequent production of pure metals and mixtures of metals called 
alloys (which we define in Section 24.4). In this chapter, we explore the general proper-
ties and natural distribution of metals; several different categories of metallurgical pro-
cesses, including pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, electrometallurgy, and powder 
metallurgy; the structures and alloys formed by metals; and the metallic products and 
applications for several selected materials.
	 24.2	 The General Properties and Natural 
Distribution of Metals
Metals share several common properties. All metals are opaque (we cannot see through 
them), and they are good conductors of heat and electricity. They generally have high 
malleability (the capacity to be bent or hammered into desired forms) and ductility 
(the capacity to be drawn into wires). We can explain these properties by the bonding 
theories that we have already examined for metals: the electron sea model and band 
theory. In the electron sea model, discussed in Section 9.11, each metal atom within 
a metal sample donates one or more electrons to an electron sea, which flows within 
the metal. In band theory, discussed in Section 12.8, the atomic orbitals of the metal 
atoms are combined, forming bands that are delocalized over the entire crystalline solid; 
electrons move freely within these bands. The mobile electrons in both of these models 
endow metals with many of their shared properties.
Each metal, however, is also unique, and even their shared properties may vary 
within a range. For example, some metals, such as copper, silver, and aluminum, have 
much higher thermal and electrical conductivities than do other metals. Table 24.1 
lists the thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity (a low resistivity corresponds 
to a high conductivity) of a few metals. Notice that both properties can vary by fac-
tors of 10 or more. Most metals are very strong, malleable, and ductile. But lead is a 
▲ Vanadium is a soft white metal.

	
24.2  The General Properties and Natural Distribution of Metals	
1103
soft, weak metal, and chromium is a brittle 
metal that will not bend without breaking. 
When we think about the shared properties of 
metals, we must allow for a range of properties 
as well as some unique ones.
Over 75% of the elements in the periodic 
table are metals, yet metals make up only 
about 25% of the mass of Earth’s crust  
(see Figure 23.2 for the composition of Earth’s 
crust). Earth’s core is thought to be composed 
of iron and nickel, but because the core is so 
far from the surface, these metals are not 
accessible. The most abundant metal on Earth 
is aluminum, a main-group metal. Several 
alkali and alkaline earth metals (calcium, 
sodium, potassium, and magnesium) make up more than 1% of Earth’s crust. Iron, 
which makes up about 5% of the crust, is the only transition metal that accounts for 
more than 0.1% of the crust. Of the first-row transition metals, titanium, chromium, 
iron, nickel, copper, and zinc are all plentiful enough to be important industrial 
materials.
Only a few metals occur naturally as elements, including nickel, copper, palladium, 
silver, platinum, and gold. Because of their low reactivity, these metals are often called 
the noble metals. They are usually concentrated within mountainous or volcanic regions 
in small, isolated veins within a rock matrix.
Most of the rest of the metals occur naturally in positive oxidation states within 
mineral deposits. Minerals (as we saw in Chapter 23) are homogeneous, naturally 
occurring, crystalline inorganic solids. A rock that contains a high concentration of a 
specific mineral is called an ore. Metallurgical processes separate useful minerals from 
other, unusable material in the ore.
The main sources for the alkali metals are chloride minerals, such as halite (sodium 
chloride) and sylvite (potassium chloride). Halite occurs in large deposits in sites that 
were once ancient oceans, or it can be precipitated by evaporating ocean water. The main 
source for some other metals are oxide minerals, such as hematite (Fe2O3), rutile (TiO2), 
and cassiterite (SnO2). The ores containing these minerals are unevenly distributed 
throughout Earth. For example, North America has large deposits of hematite but no 
substantial deposits of cassiterite. Sulfides are the most important minerals for many 
metals, such as galena (PbS), cinnabar (HgS), sphalerite (ZnS), and molybdenite (MoS2).
The main mineral source for some other metals can be complex. For example, the 
primary mineral sources for vanadium are vanadinite 3Pb5(VO4)3Cl4 and carnotite 
3K2(UO2)2(VO4)2 # 3 H2O4, which is also a main mineral source for uranium. Vanadium, 
as we have seen, is also found in crude oil. No specific minerals contain the metal 
radium. Yet radium sometimes substitutes for uranium within uranium-containing min-
erals. The small amount of radium that replaces uranium in carnotite is the major source 
of radium. Tantalum and niobium, named after the Greek god Tantalus and his daughter 
Niobe, always occur together in mixed deposits of columbite 3Fe(NbO3)24 and tantalite 
3Fe(TaO3)24. The minerals are mined together, and the elements are later separated by 
recrystallization (see Section 13.4).
▲ Most NaCl salt is produced by 
trapping ocean water in shallow 
basins and letting the water 
evaporate.

Chapter 24  Metals and Metallurgy
	 24.3	 Metallurgical Processes
Mined ores are first physically separated into their metal-containing and nonmetal-
containing components. Then, the elemental metal is extracted from the compounds 
in which it is found, a process called extractive metallurgy. In this section, we 
look at several metallurgical processes, including pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, 
electrometallurgy, and powder metallurgy. After separation and extraction, the metal is 
refined; refining is the process in which the crude material is purified.
Separation
The first step in processing metal-containing ores is crushing the ore into smaller 
particles. The particles that contain the minerals are then separated from the undesired 
material, called gangue (pronounced “gang”), usually by physical methods. For 
example, in some cases, a cyclone of wind is used to lift the gangue away from the metal-
containing particles, as shown in Figure 24.1▼. If the minerals are magnetic, magnets 
can separate the minerals. Electrostatic forces can also separate polar minerals from 
nonpolar gangue.
Sometimes solutions separate the minerals from the gangue, as shown in  
Figure 24.2▼. A wetting agent (or detergent) that preferentially attaches to the mineral 
surfaces is added to a mixture of the mined material and water. Air is blown through the 
mixture, forming bubbles and a froth. Because they are attached to the wetting agent, 
the minerals segregate into the froth, where they can be collected. The gangue separates 
into the solution.

the minerals attach to the froth in a bubbled solution. The minerals in the 
froth are separated from the gangue remaining in the solution.
Pyrometallurgy
Once the mineral is separated from the gangue, the elemental metal is extracted from the 
mineral. Several different techniques can achieve this separation. In pyrometallurgy, 
heat is employed to extract a metal from its mineral. Different heating conditions have 
different effects on the mineral.
Pyrometallurgy contains the Greek 
stem pyro, meaning fire or heat.

	
24.3  Metallurgical Processes	
1105
Calcination is the heating of an ore in order to decompose it and drive off a vola-
tile product. For example, when carbonate minerals are heated, carbon dioxide is driven 
off, as shown in these examples:
PbCO3(s) ¡
heat PbO(s) + CO2(g)
4 FeCO3(s) + O2(g) ¡
heat 2 Fe2O3(s) + 4 CO2(g)
Many minerals occur in a hydrated form (that is, they contain water). Calcination 
can also drive off water:
Fe2O3 # 2 Fe(OH)3(s) ¡
heat 2 Fe2O3(s) + 3 H2O(g)
Heating that causes a chemical reaction between the furnace atmosphere (the gases in 
the furnace) and the mineral is called roasting. Roasting is particularly important in 
processing sulfide ores. The ores are heated in the presence of oxygen, converting the 
sulfide into an oxide and emitting sulfur dioxide. For example, the roasting of lead(II) 
sulfide occurs by the reaction:
2 PbS(s) + 3 O2(g) ¡
heat 2 PbO(s) + 2 SO2(g)
In some cases, especially with the less active metals such as mercury, roasting the sulfide 
produces the pure metal:
HgS(s) + O2(g) ¡
heat Hg(g) + SO2(g)
When roasting forms a liquid product, which makes separation easier, it is called 
smelting. Consider, for example, the smelting of zinc oxide:
ZnO(s) + C(s) ¡
heat Zn(l) + CO(g)
The gaseous carbon monoxide separates from the liquid zinc, allowing the metal to be 
readily recovered. In some cases, a flux must be added to the mixture during smelting to 
help separate the two materials. The flux is a material that will react with the gangue to 
form a substance with a low melting point. For example, oxides of silicon within gangue 
can be liquefied by reaction with calcium carbonate according to the reaction:
SiO2(s) + CaCO3(s) ¡ CO2(g) + CaSiO3(l)
	
gangue	
flux	
slag
The waste liquid solution that forms from the flux and gangue is usually a silicate 
material called a slag. The liquid metal and the liquid slag have different densities, and 
therefore separate. Holes tapped at different heights into the side of the container hold-
ing the liquid metal and slag allow the more dense liquid to flow out of the lower tap 
holes and the less dense liquid to flow out of the higher tap holes.
Hydrometallurgy
The use of an aqueous solution to extract metals from their ores is hydrometallurgy. 
A hydrometallurgy process is used to obtain gold. Gold occurs in its elemental state, but 
often as very small particles mixed with other substances. The gold can be separated out 
of the mixture by selectively dissolving it into solution, a process called leaching. In 
this process, solid gold reacts with sodium cyanide to form a soluble gold complex:
4 Au(s) + 8 CN-(aq) + O2(g) + 2 H2O(l) ¡ 4 Au(CN)2
-(aq) + 4 OH-(aq)
The impurities are filtered out of the solution, and the gold is reduced back to elemental 
gold with a reactive metal such as zinc:
2 Au(CN)2
-(aq) + Zn(s) ¡ Zn(CN)4
2-(aq) + 2 Au(s)
Leaching has been practiced for many years and often results in the contamination of 
streams and rivers with cyanide. New alternatives using the thiosulfate ion (S2O3
-) are 
being investigated to replace leaching.
Different acid, base, and salt solutions are sometimes used to selectively separate 
out metal-bearing minerals. For example, sulfuric acid is used to separate the copper and 
Hydrated compounds are discussed 
in Section 3.5.

Chapter 24  Metals and Metallurgy
iron from the mineral chalcopyrite, CuFeS2, and a sodium chloride solution is used to 
separate the lead from the insoluble mineral anglesite, PbSO4:
 2 CuFeS2(s) + H2SO4(aq) + 4 O2(g) ¡ 2 CuSO4(aq) + Fe2O3(s) + 3 S(s) + H2O(l)
 PbSO4(s) + 4 NaCl(aq) ¡ Na2[PbCl4](aq) + Na2SO4(aq)
Hydrometallurgy is often more economical than pyrometallurgy because of the high 
energy costs associated with the elevated temperatures needed for calcination and 
roasting.
Electrometallurgy
In electrometallurgy, electrolysis is used to produce metals from their compounds. 
For example, the Hall process is an electrometallurgical process crucial to aluminum 
production. The main source of aluminum is bauxite, Al2O3 # n H2O. A hydrometallurgical 
process, the Bayer process, separates bauxite from the iron and silicon dioxide with which 
it is usually found. In this process, the bauxite is heated in a concentrated aqueous NaOH 
solution under high pressure. The aluminum oxide dissolves, leaving the other oxides 
behind in solid form:
Al2O3 # n H2O(s) + 2 OH-(aq) + 2 H2O(l) ¡ 2 Al(OH)4
-(aq)
The basic aluminum solution is separated from the oxide solids, and then the alumi-
num oxide is precipitated out of solution by neutralizing it (recall the pH dependence of 
the solubility of Al(OH)3 from Section 17.8). Calcination of the precipitate at tempera-
tures greater than 1000 °C yields anhydrous alumina (Al2O3). Electrolysis is then used to 
reduce the aluminum out of the aluminum oxide. Because Al2O3 melts at such a high 
temperature (greater than 2000  °C), however, the electrolysis is not carried out on molten 
Al2O3. Instead, in the Hall process the Al2O3 is dissolved into molten cryolite (Na3AlF6), 
and graphite rods are used as electrodes to carry out the electrolysis in the liquid mixture 
(Figure 24.3▼). The carbon that composes the graphite electrodes is oxidized by the 
­dissolved oxygen ions in the molten salt and converted to carbon dioxide. The aluminum 
ions dissolved in the molten salt reduce to molten aluminum, which sinks down to the 
bottom of the cell and is removed:
Oxidation:	
 C(s) + 2 O2-(dissolved) ¡ CO2(g) + 4 e-
Reduction:	
 3 e- + Al3+(dissolved) ¡ Al(l)
See Section 19.8 for a description of 
electrolysis.

Hall process produces aluminum metal by 
reducing the aluminum ions in alumina. 
Graphite electrodes act as reducing agents. 
Dissolved oxygen ions in the molten cryolite 
oxidize the carbon in the graphite electrodes 
to form carbon dioxide.
Another important example of metallurgy is the refinement of copper. The most 
abundant copper source is the mineral chalcopyrite, CuFeS2. First, the chalcopyrite is 
converted to CuS by roasting. During this process, the iron also forms oxides and sul-
fides. Silica is added to form an iron silicate slag, which is then removed. The remaining 
copper(II) sulfide reacts with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide gas and copper metal, but 
the metal is not very pure. Electrolysis is employed to refine the copper.

	
24.3  Metallurgical Processes	
1107
In the electrolysis cell used to refine copper, both the anode and the cathode are 
made of copper (Figure 24.4▲). The anode is the impure copper (that needs to be refined), 
and the cathode is a thin sheet of pure copper. As the current flows through the cell, the 
copper from the anode oxidizes and dissolves in a copper sulfate solution. It then plates 
out as pure copper on the cathode. The impurities in the copper anode separate from the 
copper during electrolysis because, even though the more active metals also oxidize from 
the anode, they stay in solution and do not plate out on the cathode. The less active met-
als do not oxidize at all and simply fall to the bottom of the cell as the copper is dissolved 
from the anode. The sludge at the bottom of the electrolysis cell contains many precious 
metals, including gold and silver. About one-quarter of the silver produced in the United 
States is from the impurities recovered from the refinement of copper.
Powder Metallurgy
Powder metallurgy, first developed in the 1920s, is used to make metallic components 
from powdered metal. In powder metallurgy, micron-sized metal particles are pressed 
together under high pressures to form the desired component. The component is then 
heated (sintered). The sintering process occurs below the melting point of the powder 
but at a temperature high enough to fuse the metal particles together, strengthening the 
metal and increasing its density.
Originally, iron powder from mill scrap was used in powder metallurgy. The scrap 
was primarily iron oxide that would fall off the steel as it was being milled. The iron 
oxide dust was heated in a hydrogen atmosphere to reduce the oxide to iron particles. 
Manufacturers called the powdered metal iron sponge because numerous holes form in 
the particles when the oxygen escapes.
In the 1960s, the A. O. Smith Company in the United States introduced a new 
method for the development of powdered metal, called water atomization. In this 
method, the pure metal is melted and a small stream of the liquid is allowed to flow 
from the bottom of the container of molten metal. A high-pressure blast of cold water 
hits the stream of metal, breaking it into small droplets that quickly solidify. Powdered 
metal particles made in this way are smoother and more dense than the sponge powder 
particles from oxide scrap. In addition to powdered iron metal, many copper, bronze, 
carbide, and brass parts are made with powder metallurgical processes.
Powder metallurgy offers several advantages over traditional casting or milling of 
metal. For example, waste is almost eliminated because the part can be pressed directly 
into the desired shape. Intricate teeth on gears and multiple holes can be designed into 
the press, and therefore do not have to be machined after production. Making cast metal

objects from metals with high melting points, such as molybdenum and tungsten, can 
be difficult because of the high temperatures necessary to melt the metal. Using the 
powder avoids the need for high temperatures.
	 24.4	 Metal Structures and Alloys
We can describe the structures of metals as the closest packing of spheres, first discussed 
in Section 12.3. Elemental metals generally crystallize in one of the basic types of crystal 
lattices, including face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, and hexagonal closest 
packed. The crystal structure of a metal may change, however, as a function of temperature 
and pressure. Table 24.2 lists the crystal structures for the 3d transition metals.

Alloys
An alloy is a metallic material that contains more than one element. Some alloys 
are simply solid solutions, whereas others are specific compounds with definite ratios 
of the component elements. Alloys have metallic properties, but they can consist of 
either two or more metals or a metal and a nonmetal. We broadly classify alloys as 
substitutional or interstitial. In a substitutional alloy, one metal atom substitutes 
for another in the crystal structure. The crystal structure may either stay the same 
upon the substitution, or it may change to accommodate the differences between 
the atoms. In an interstitial alloy, small, usually nonmetallic atoms fit in between 
the metallic atoms of a crystal. The alloy maintains its metallic properties with these 
interstitial atoms in the structure.
Substitutional Alloys
For two metals to form a substitutional alloy, the radii of the two metal atoms must be 
similar, usually within 15% of each other. For example, the atomic radii of copper and 
nickel are both 135 pm, and both of the elements form the face-centered cubic structure. 
Therefore, either metal can easily replace the other in the metal crystal structure.

Figure 24.5▶ is a phase diagram for a copper and nickel alloy. 
This phase diagram, called a binary phase diagram, is different from 
the diagrams that we discussed in Section 11.8, which show the 
phases of a pure substance at different pressures and temperatures. 
This diagram shows the different phases for a mixture at different 
compositions and temperatures. The x-axis indicates the composi-
tion (in this case, the mole percent of nickel in the alloy, with the 
left side representing pure copper and the right side representing 
pure nickel). The y-axis indicates the temperature.
Pure copper melts at 1084 °C, as indicated by the change from 
solid to liquid at 0% nickel. Pure nickel melts at 1455 °C, as indi-
cated by the change from solid to liquid at 100% nickel. The area on 
the diagram above the line connecting the melting points of cop-
per and nickel represents a liquid solution of the two metals. The 
area below that line represents a solid solution of the two metals. 
Any ratios of copper and nickel can form the face-centered cubic 
structure.

The phase diagrams of some alloys are more complex. Consider the phase ­diagram 
for chromium and vanadium in Figure 24.6▶, on the next page. Both Cr and V form 
the body-centered cubic crystal, and the atoms are similar in size. Yet this phase dia-
gram reveals an important difference between this alloy and the Cu and Ni alloy:  

1110	
Chapter 24  Metals and Metallurgy
the melting temperature does not vary in a uniform way from the lower melting point of Cr 
to the higher melting point of V. Instead we see that the alloys with intermediate composi-
tions melt at lower temperatures than either pure metal. The lowest melting point is 1750 °C 
at a composition of 30 mol % vanadium. Solid compositions that melt at temperatures lower 
than either of the pure metals, as well as compositions that melt at temperatures higher than 
either of the two metals, are common in these types of alloys.
Alloys with Limited Solubility
Some alloys are composed of metals that each have different crystal structures. For 
example, nickel crystallizes in the face-centered cubic structure and chromium in the 
body-centered cubic structure. Because of their different 
structures, these two metals do not form a miscible 
solid solution at all compositions. At some intermediate 
composition, the structure has to change from that of one 
of the metals to that of the other. Figure 24.7◀ is the nickel 
and chromium phase diagram from 700 °C to 1900 °C. 
Notice that the diagram has two different solid phases: face-
centered cubic and body-centered cubic. From pure nickel 
(0 mol % chromium) to about 40–50 mol % chromium, the 
structure is face-centered cubic. In this structure, Cr atoms 
substitute for Ni atoms in the face-centered cubic structure of 
nickel. However, beyond a certain percentage of chromium 
(which depends on temperature), that structure is no longer 
stable. At 700 °C about 40 mol % Cr can fit in the crystal, and 
at 1200 °C about 50 mol % Cr can fit in. Adding additional 
Cr beyond these points results in a different phase.
At the other end of the diagram (nearly pure chromium) 
and at 700 °C, only a small amount of nickel can be substituted 
into the body-centered cubic structure of the chromium. As 
the temperature rises to 1300 °C, however, about 20 mol % 
nickel can be accommodated into the chromium structure. 
The region in between the two phases is called a two-phase 
region. At these compositions, the two phases (nickel-rich 
face-centered cubic and chromium-rich body-centered cubic) 
exist together. The amount of each phase depends upon the composition of the alloy.
We can determine the composition and relative amounts of the two different phases 
that coexist in a two-phase region from a phase diagram. Point A on Figure 24.7 in the 
Cr–Ni phase diagram represents 50% composition at 700 °C, and both phases are pres-
ent. Some of the Cr atoms have substituted into the nickel-rich face-centered cubic 
structure, but there is too much Cr to all fit into the crystal. The leftover Cr atoms form 
the chromium-rich body-centered cubic structure with a small number of Ni atoms in 
the crystal.

The two crystals that exist at point A are (1) the nickel-rich face-centered cubic 
structure with 40 mol % Cr; and (2) the chromium-rich body-centered cubic structure 
with 5 mol % Ni. The 50% composition on the phase diagram has just slightly more Cr 
atoms than can fit into the nickel structure. Thus, most of the crystals in the two-phase 
region are the nickel-rich face-centered cubic structure with only a small amount of the 
chromium-rich body-centered cubic structure, as determined by a method called the 
lever rule. The lever rule states that in a two-phase region, whichever phase is closer to 
the composition of the alloy is the more abundant phase. In this example, the 50 mol % 
Cr composition on the phase diagram is closer to the 40 mol % Cr composition of the 
nickel-rich face-centered cubic phase than the 95 mol % Cr composition of the 
­chromium-rich body-centered cubic phase, so more face-centered cubic crystals are 
present than body-centered cubic crystals.

Interstitial Alloys
Recall that in contrast to substitutional alloys, where one metal atom substitutes for 
another in the lattice, interstitial alloys contain atoms of one kind that fit into the 
holes, or interstitial sites, of the crystal structure of the other metal. In metals with the 
interstitial elements hydrogen, boron, nitrogen, or carbon, the alloy that results retains 
its metallic properties.

1112	
Chapter 24  Metals and Metallurgy
Closest-packed crystal structures have two different types of holes between 
the atoms in the crystalline lattice. An octahedral hole, shown in Figure 24.8◀, 
exists in the middle of six atoms on two adjacent closest-packed sheets of metal 
atoms. The hole is located directly above the center of three closest-packed metal 
atoms in one sheet and below the three metal atoms in the adjacent sheet. This 
configuration of metal atoms is identical to a regular octahedral configuration 
that consists of four atoms in a square plane with one atom above and one atom 
below the square.
We can calculate the size of an octahedral hole by determining the size of a hole 
on a square of four atoms in a plane (Figure 24.9◀). Any of the four corners of the 
square is the 90° angle of a right triangle formed from the adjacent two sides and the 
diagonal line that runs across the center of the square. According to the Pythagorean 
theorem, the length of the diagonal line (c) is related to the length of the sides (a and 
b) as follows:
	
c2 = a2 + b2
[24.1]
If we let rm equal the metal atom radius, the lengths of the sides are 2rm. We can then 
substitute 2rm for both a and b:
 c2 =  (2rm)2 + (2rm)2
 c2 = 8rm
2
 c = 2.828rm

[24.2]
We can see from Figure 24.9 that the length of the diagonal (c) is twice the radius of 
the atoms plus twice the radius of the hole:
c = 2rm + 2rhole
[24.3]
Combining Equations 24.2 and 24.3, we get the important result:
 2.828rm = 2rm + 2rhole
 0.828rm = 2rhole
 rhole = 0.414rm

[24.4]
The octahedral hole, surrounded by six metal atoms, has a radius that is 41.4% of the 
metal atom radius. By contrast, the hole in the center of a cube in the simple cubic struc-
ture has a radius that is 73% of the metal atom radius. The number of octahedral holes in 
a closest-packed structure is equal to the number of metal atoms.
The second type of interstitial hole in a closest-packed structure is a tetrahedral 
hole (first introduced in Section 12.5), which forms directly above the center point of 
three closest-packed metal atoms in one plane and below a fourth metal atom located 
directly above the center point in the adjacent plane (Figure 24.10▼). The number of 
tetrahedral holes in a closest-packed structure is equal to twice the number of metal 
atoms. Because this hole is surrounded by only four atoms, the hole is smaller than the 
octahedral interstitial hole. We can apply geometric considerations similar to those used 
previously for the octahedral hole to determine that the tetrahedral hole has a radius 
that is 23% of the metal atom radius.

to the radius of the two corner 
atoms plus the diameter of the hole. 
The Pythagorean theorem relates the 
length of the diagonal to the lengths 
of the sides of the square.

Table 24.3  Formulas of Several Interstitial Alloys
Interstitial alloys form when small nonmetallic atoms fit within the octahedral or 
tetrahedral holes of the crystalline lattice of the metal. The formulas for these alloys 
depend both on the type of hole occupied by the nonmetallic atom and on the fraction 
of holes occupied. For example, titanium and carbon form an alloy with a closest-packed 
structure for titanium in which all of the octahedral holes are filled with carbon atoms. 
Since the number of octahedral holes in a closest-packed structure is equal to the number 
of atoms in the structure, the ratio of carbon atoms to titanium atoms is 1:1 and the cor-
responding formula is TiC. In the compound formed between molybdenum and nitro-
gen, by contrast, only one-half of the octahedral holes in the closest-packed structure of 
Mo are filled with N. Therefore, the formula for this compound is Mo2N. Table 24.3 lists 
the formulas and relative number of holes filled for several different interstitial alloys.

	 24.5	 Sources, Properties, and Products  
of Some of the 3d Transition Metals
In this section we examine major sources, interesting properties, and important products 
of several of the 3d transition metals, specifically, titanium, chromium, manganese, 
cobalt, copper, nickel, and zinc. We also survey the different metallurgical methods 
used to separate and refine them. The variety of uses for these metals reflects their varied 
structures and properties.
Titanium
Titanium is the ninth most abundant element in Earth’s crust and the fourth most 
abundant metal. Titanium was discovered in 1791, but the pure metal was not isolated 
until 1910. The principal minerals of titanium are rutile (TiO2) and ilmenite (FeTiO3). 
Another source of titanium is coal ash, the residue from burned coal. Black shiny 
ilmenite is found in granite deposits along the North Atlantic coast, often within silica 
sand. The mineral ilmenite is magnetic due to the presence of Fe2+ ions, so it can be 
separated with a magnet from the nonmagnetic silica. The separated mineral is heated 
in the presence of carbon under an atmosphere of chlorine gas, forming TiCl4, a volatile 
gas that can be isolated:
FeTiO3(s) + 3 Cl2(g) + 3 C(s) ¡ 3 CO(g) + FeCl2(s) + TiCl4(g)
The TiCl4 gas is reacted with hot magnesium metal turnings (shaved pieces of 
­magnesium), forming elemental titanium—a solid sponge material:
TiCl4(g) + 2 Mg(s) ¡ 2 MgCl2(l) + Ti(s)

Chapter 24  Metals and Metallurgy
Titanium is very reactive, readily oxidizing in the presence of oxygen and even 
nitrogen. Consequently, the elemental titanium is arc-melted—a method in which 
the solid metal is melted with an arc (an electrical discharge) from a high-voltage electric 
source in a controlled atmosphere to prevent oxidation—and then collected in a water-
cooled copper pot. Because of titanium’s high reactivity, any further processing must be 
done in a protective atmosphere of an inert gas, such as Ar, to prevent oxidation.
Despite its reactivity, solid titanium is highly resistant to corrosion in air, acid, 
and seawater because it quickly reacts with oxygen to form an oxide that coats the sur-
face, preventing further oxidation of the underlying metal. Consequently, titanium is 
often used in the production of ship components such as propeller shafts and rigging. 
Titanium is also very strong and light; it is stronger than steel and less than half as 
dense. It is denser than aluminum but twice as strong. For these reasons, titanium is 
used in the airline industry for the production of jet engine parts. When titanium is 
alloyed with 5% aluminum and trace amounts of Fe, Cr, and Mo, the resulting metal 
retains its strength under higher temperature.
The most common use of titanium, however, is as titanium(IV) oxide (TiO2), which 
forms a clear crystal but a brilliant white powder. Most white paints include TiO2, which 
is far less toxic than PbO2, which was used in older paints. Titanium(IV) oxide is made by 
reacting sulfuric acid with ilmenite, which dissolves the titanium into solution:
FeTiO3(s) + 3 H2SO4(l) ¡ FeSO4(aq) + Ti(SO4)2(aq) + 3 H2O(l)
Neutralizing the solution with strong base forms titanium(IV) oxide:
Ti4+(aq) + 4 OH-(aq) ¡ TiO2(s) + 2 H2O(l)
Calcination of the oxide dries it to form TiO2 rutile crystals. Large rutile crystals are 
sometimes used as gems because they resemble diamonds.
Chromium
The name chromium comes from the Greek root chroma, which means color. 
The different compounds of chromium are brightly colored (Table 24.4; 
Figure 24.11◀). The main ore source of chromium is chromite, FeCr2O4. No 
appreciable sources of chromium ores exist in the United States. Chromium 
metal is produced by reducing chromium ore with aluminum:
3 FeCr2O4(s) + 8 Al(s) ¡ 4 Al2O3(s) + 6 Cr(s) + 3 Fe(s)
Metallic chromium is a white, hard, lustrous, and brittle metal. The metal 
readily dissolves in acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, but it does 
not dissolve in concentrated nitric acid (because nitric acid forms an oxide on 
the surface of the chromium that resists further reaction). The primary use of 
chromium is in the production of steel alloys called stainless steels. Reducing 
chromite with carbon produces ferrochrome, an alloy that is added to steel:
FeCr2O4(s) + 4 C(g) ¡
heat FexCry(s) + 4 CO(g)

▲ Figure 24.11  Chromium Compounds   
Chromium compounds tend to be brightly 
colored.

The chromium reacts with any oxygen in the steel to protect the iron from rust-
ing. Chromium compounds were also used extensively in metal coatings, such as 
paints because the chromium helps to rustproof the underlying metal, and in wood 
preservatives because these compounds kill many of the bacteria and molds that rot 
wood. Chromium compounds are finding less use today, however, because of their 
toxicity and potential carcinogenicity. Nonetheless, because of their great corrosion 
resistance, chromate coatings are still used on large outdoor steel structures such as 
bridges, and chromate paints are used to mark streets (on the pavement) and on 
street signs.
Because chromium has the electron configuration 3Ar4 4s13d5, with six orbitals 
available for bonding, it can have oxidation states from +1 to +6. Low-oxidation-state 
chromium exists primarily as the cation in salt compounds such as Cr(NO3)3 and CrCl3. 
High-oxidation-state chromium occurs within the polyatomic anions of salts. The most 
important compounds with chromium in the +6 oxidation state are the chromates 
and dichromates. In an acidic solution (below pH 6), the orange-red dichromate ion 
Cr2O7
2- is more stable. In more basic solutions (above pH 6), the yellow chromate ion 
CrO4
2- dominates. Adding acid to a solution containing the chromate ion produces 
the dichromate ion:
2 H+(aq) + 2 CrO4
2-(aq) ¡ Cr2O7
2-(aq) + H2O(l)
The chromate ion has a tetrahedral arrangement of oxygen atoms around a chro-
mium atom. The dichromate ion has one bridging oxygen between the two tetrahedrons 
surrounding the chromium ions:
2−
16.2 nm
17.7 nm

Chromate (CrO4

Dichromate (Cr2O7

The high-oxidation-state chromates and dichromates are very strong oxidizing 
agents (that is, they are easily reduced). Consequently, they are used as coatings on 
other metal surfaces to prevent oxidation. The chromates react with the atoms on 
the surface of the other metals, forming a strongly bonded gel-like film. The film is 
nonmetallic and bonds very effectively with paint and resins that are applied over 
the film. We can see evidence of the oxidizing power of dichromate in the ability of 
ammonium dichromate to sustain combustion without any additional oxygen. Once 
ignited, ammonium dichromate burns with visible flames, giving off a smoke of 
green chromium oxide dust:
(NH4)2Cr2O7(s) ¡
heat 4 H2O(g) + N2(g) + Cr2O3(s)
Manganese
Manganese, with the electron configuration [Ar]4s23d5, exhibits a wide range of 
oxidation states, from +1 to +7. The most common natural sources of manganese 
are pyrolusite (MnO2), hausmannite (Mn3O4), and rhodochrosite (MnCO3) minerals. 
Calcination of rhodochrosite produces manganese(IV) oxide:
MnCO3(s) + 12O2(g) ¡
heat MnO2(s) + CO2(g)
The manganese(IV) oxide or pyrolusite minerals can react with active metals such as Al 
or Na to produce the elemental metal:
3 MnO2(s) + 4 Al(s) ¡ 3 Mn(s) + 2 Al2O3(s)
▲ Ammonium dichromate does not 
require additional oxygen to burn.

Chapter 24  Metals and Metallurgy
Pyrolusite, however, is often found as an impure mineral, containing mixtures of 
MnO and Fe2O3. Heating the mineral in the presence of carbon can reduce the mineral, 
forming an alloy of manganese and iron called ferromanganese:
MnO2(s) + MnO(s) + Fe2O3(s) + n C(s) ¡ MnxFeyCz(s) + n CO(g)
Ferromanganese generally contains about 5–6% carbon and is used as an alloying mate-
rial in steel production. Manganese is added to steel alloys to change the physical prop-
erties of the steel. For example, manganese makes the steel easier to deform at high 
temperatures. Adding manganese to steel helps the rolling and forging steps of steel pro-
duction. Steel alloys containing about 12% manganese are used in military armor and 
industrial applications such as bulldozer blades. Manganese also strengthens copper, 
aluminum, and magnesium alloys.
Manganese is a reactive metal that dissolves in most acids. When heated in the presence 
of air, it forms the various manganese oxides, including MnO, Mn3O4, and MnO2. When 
heated in pure oxygen, the high-oxidation-state oxide Mn2O7 also forms. At high-oxidation 
states, the manganese compounds are good oxidizing agents. Dissolving MnO2 into a solu-
tion of hydrochloric acid oxidizes the chloride and produces chlorine gas:
MnO2(s) + 4 HCl(aq) ¡ Cl2(g) + 2 H2O(l) + MnCl2(aq)
The permanganate ion (MnO4
-) has an oxidation state of +7 for Mn and is also an 
important oxidizing agent. The permanganate ion can even oxidize hydrogen peroxide, 
which is itself used as an oxidizing agent:
2 MnO4
-(aq) + 3 H2O2(aq) + 2 H+(aq) ¡ 2 MnO2(s) + 3 O2(g) + 4 H2O(g)
The compound MnO2 is a glass additive. By itself, MnO2 is either a brown or black 
crystal, depending on the degree of hydration. Yet, when added to a silica glass, it 
imparts a pink color to the glass. The pink color is useful because it counteracts the green 
color often seen in glass, which is due to small concentrations of impure iron oxides. In 
other words, MnO2 is added to glass to “decolorize” it. Old manganese-containing glass 
that has been exposed to UV light for over 100 years develops a slight purple tint. This 
purple color is due to the oxidation of MnO2 to Mn(VII) oxides.
Cobalt
Cobalt ore is often found within the ores of other metals, such as iron, nickel, lead, and 
silver. Cobalt’s most common ores are sulfide minerals, such as cobaltite (CoAsS), which 
is collected as a by-product in the extraction processes of the other metal ores. No large 
deposits of cobalt ores occur in the United States, but surveys indicate that there are 
cobalt-rich deposits in the Pacific Ocean near the Hawaiian Islands.
Cobalt, like iron and nickel, is ferromagnetic and is important in the production 
of magnets. The atoms in ferromagnetic materials contain unpaired electrons like the 
paramagnetic materials described in Section 8.7. In ferromagnetic materials, however, 
these electrons can all align with their spins oriented in the same direction, creating a 
permanent magnetic field.
Magnets are increasingly important in industrial and military applications. In the 
United States, concerns have arisen over the lack of domestic sources of cobalt for these 
applications. New and stronger magnetic materials that do not require cobalt have been 
developed, but these require neodymium, which is found mostly in China.
Cobalt is also an important additive for high-strength steels. Carbaloy, a mixture 
composed primarily of cobalt metal with grains of tungsten carbide, is a very tough 
material. The strength of the cobalt and the hardness of the carbides make carbaloy a 
good material for industrial cutting and abrasion. Cobalt also forms many com-
pounds with brilliant blue colors and is used in making pigments and inks. Cobalt 
compounds are essential for health because cobalt is the metal in vitamin B12, which 
prevents anemia.

Copper
Copper, which can be found in its elemental form, was one of the first elements to be 
isolated and used by humans—copper products have been known for over 10,000 years. 
Ancient civilizations used copper to form tools. The earliest known artifacts produced 
by the smelting of copper are at a site in Tepe Yahya, Iran, dating from about 3800 b.c.e. 
The discovery of bronze, a copper and tin alloy, improved tool making because copper’s 
bronze alloys are stronger, and they resist wear and corrosion better than pure copper.
The most important copper ores are chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) and malachite 
[Cu2(OH)2CO3]. Copper ores often occur near deposits of elemental copper, providing 
early humans with an easy way to locate copper ores. The electrometallurgical produc-
tion of pure copper from chalcopyrite is described in Section 24.3.
The high natural abundance and generally high concentration of copper and cop-
per ores make copper an economical choice for many industrial applications. Today over 
40% of copper products are made from recycled copper. The ease and low cost of recy-
cling copper have allowed copper to remain an important industrial metal.
The high conductivity of copper is second only to that of silver, making copper the 
most important metal for electrical wires. Along with iron in steel, copper is now among 
the most widely used metals; it is used in electrical motors and devices, the electrical wir-
ing that snakes though the walls of houses, and the electrical transmission network link-
ing power sources to homes and industries all over the world. Because of its high heat 
conductivity, copper is also used as a heat exchange material—for example, in car radia-
tors. In addition, copper is used to make pipes for water distribution. Copper pipes can 
be readily connected to each other with watertight seals by soldering. Copper displaced 
lead for use as water pipes because of the toxicity of lead. Today, because of its lower price 
and lighter weight, plastic is used for many water pipes.
Copper has a distinctive reddish color that can be polished to a beautiful metallic 
luster; it has been used in architecture, as a decorative metal in jewelry, and as a material 
for sculpture. Copper composes the decorative sheathings on many domes and rooftop 
art works. When exposed to the atmosphere and rain, copper can oxidize, forming a 
number of different compounds, such as malachite and brochanite (Cu4SO4(OH)6), 
which have beautiful blue or green colors. Copper roofing shingles can be purchased as 
polished copper sheets or as sheets that have already been oxidized and exhibit a beauti-
ful weathered patina (a coating that comes with age and use). Chemical compounds 
speed up the aging process and produce the desired patina, which takes 20 or more years 
to develop naturally.
Even though copper has many useful properties, it is not a very strong metal; 
therefore, alloys of copper with improved strength have been developed. Bronze was 
one of the first alloys ever produced. This alloy of copper and tin has been used for 
thousands of years because it could be made even in the low heat of a Stone Age camp-
fire. Brass, another widely used alloy, contains copper and zinc. Many brass and 
bronze alloys also contain other metals to achieve certain physical properties. Some 
of the most important applications of bronze and brass are for plumbing fixtures, 
bearings, and art decorations. In addition, the tendency of brass and bronze alloys 
(unlike those of iron) not to spark when struck makes them useful in applications 
where sparks could be dangerous.
Nickel
Most of the world’s nickel comes from deposits in Ontario, Canada. These deposits 
are believed to have formed from a meteorite impact (most meteorites have high 
nickel content). The nickel occurs as a sulfide compound mixed with copper and iron 
sulfides. To produce nickel, sulfides are roasted in air to form metal oxides, and then 
they are reduced to the elemental metals with carbon. The metal mixture is heated in 
the presence of carbon monoxide, forming nickel carbonyl, which has a boiling point of 
43 °C and can be collected as a gas:
Ni(s) + 4 CO(g) ¡
heat Ni(CO)4(g)
▲ Copper is used in a variety of 
applications.
▲ Copper wiring is used to conduct 
electricity in wires.

Chapter 24  Metals and Metallurgy
When the nickel carbonyl is heated past 200 °C, it decomposes back to nickel metal and 
carbon monoxide. This method of refining nickel is the Mond process.
Nickel metal is fairly unreactive and resistant to corrosion, characteristics that it 
shares with platinum and palladium. Consequently, nickel is used as an alloying metal 
in the production of stainless steels. Many nickel alloys are used for applications where 
corrosion resistance is important. For example, the alloy Monel contains 72% Ni, 25% 
Cu, and 3% Fe and is resistant to reaction with most chemicals. Monel does not react 
even with fluorine gas at room temperature. Nickel–steel alloys are used for armor plates, 
and elemental nickel is often plated onto other metals as a protective coating.
Zinc
Elemental zinc was officially discovered in Europe in 1746 when calamine (zinc silicate) 
was reduced with charcoal to produce the metal. However, zinc had been used for many 
hundreds of years before this discovery because zinc ores and copper ores were used to 
form copper–zinc brass alloys. The main sources of zinc are ores composed of sphalerite 
(ZnS), smithsonite (ZnCO3), and an oxide mixture of zinc, iron, and manganese called 
franklinite. These ores are roasted to form the oxides of the metals and then reduced 
with carbon to produce the elemental metals.
Zinc combines with many different metals to form useful alloys. As we have dis-
cussed, the combination of zinc and copper produces the brass family of alloys. The 
combination of zinc and nickel with copper produces alloys with a silver color called 
German or silver brass. Zinc is also used in solder alloys with low melting points.
Galvanizing a steel object (such as a nail) involves dipping the object into a molten 
bath of zinc. The zinc, which is more reactive than the iron in steel, preferentially oxi-
dizes, forming a tough protective coating. Zinc compounds are also used to coat steel 
before applying other coatings. The zinc compounds, such as zinc phosphate, adhere 
strongly to the steel surface, forming rough crystals onto which other coatings, such as 
paint, adhere very well. If a painted steel surface is scratched, the underlying exposed 
metal is susceptible to rust, but the added zinc ions prevent this by migrating toward the 
defect and forming a protective zinc oxide coating.
Zinc and zinc compounds have generally been considered safe. Zinc additives in 
coatings have replaced many of the chromium and lead additives (both of which are 
toxic) that were previously used. Today, however, even zinc additives in coatings are 
being studied for environmental hazards. In Europe, all substances that contain zinc 
compounds must be labeled as potential polluters of environmental water. More 
environmentally safe organic compounds have been developed to replace the metal-
lic anticorrosion additives, but these compounds are more expensive to produce. 
Opportunities abound for chemists to develop needed products that are both envi-
ronmentally safe and economically viable.
▲ Zinc phosphate adheres strongly 
to steel surfaces, forming rough 
crystals onto which other coatings, 
such as paint, can be applied.

Key Equations and Relationships
Lever Rule (24.4)
In a two-phase region on a phase diagram, two different crystal structures coexist in equilibrium. 
Whichever phase has a composition closer to the overall composition of the alloy is the phase 
present in the larger relative amount.
Key Concepts
General Properties (24.2)
▶
▶Metals have many common physical properties, such as high 
conductivity of electricity and heat and high malleability and 
ductility. These properties vary among the different metals.
Natural Distribution of Metals (24.2)
▶
▶Metals are unevenly distributed throughout Earth’s crust. All the 
metals together compose about 25% of the mass of Earth’s crust, 
but just a few key metals are abundant enough to each individu-
ally compose more than 1% of the crust.
▶
▶Few metals exist naturally in their elemental state; most are 
found in ores, rocks that contain a high concentration of metal-­
containing minerals.
▶
▶Most metal-containing minerals are oxides, sulfides, chlorides, 
carbonates, or more complex compounds.
Metallurgical Processes (24.3)
▶
▶To be useful, metals have to be separated from the gangue, the un-
usable part of the ores, reduced to elemental metals and refined to 
be more pure.
▶
▶Extractive metallurgy is the general term for the processes, such 
as pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and electrometallurgy, that 
separate metal from ore.
▶
▶A method of forming metal components from micron-sized metal 
particles is powder metallurgy.
Phase Diagrams (24.4)
▶
▶Elemental metals tend to crystallize in three crystalline structures: 
face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, and hexagonal closest 
packed.
▶
▶When two types of metal atoms bond together, they form an alloy.
▶
▶A binary phase diagram is a graphical representation of the phases 
and crystal types of alloys present at different compositions and 
temperatures.
▶
▶If the two metals in an alloy are similar in size and have the same 
crystal structure, they tend to form a miscible solid solution, 
which means that they can form an alloy at any composition ra-
tio. If the two metals are dissimilar in size or crystal structure, the 
solubility of one atom in the other’s crystal structure is often lim-
ited. At certain compositions two different crystals can coexist in 
equilibrium; this is called a two-phase region. The lever rule deter-
mines which phase is present in a greater proportion.
Types of Alloys (24.4)
▶
▶There are two different types of alloys, substitutional and interstitial.
▶
▶A substitutional alloy is a mixture in which one type of metal 
atom replaces another type of metal atom in the crystal structure.
▶
▶In an interstitial alloy, one type of atom (either a metal or non-
metal) fits into the holes within the crystal structure of the metal. 
Interstitial alloys can be made with different atoms filling different 
fractions of the different types of holes.

alloy that melts at a relatively low temperature and connects 
two or more metal pieces. The technique of soldering is com-

boards. Table a lists tensile strength and hardness data for 
pure tin, pure lead, and two tin–lead alloys. Tensile strength is 
the maximum stress a material that is being stretched or

I
n this chapter, we examine the chemistry of the transition metals and an important 
class of transition metal compounds called coordination compounds. We will see 
that coordination compounds form all of the types of isomers that we have studied 
so far, as well as some new types. In our examination of the transition metals, we draw 
on much of what we learned in Chapters 7 and 8 about electronic structure and period-
icity. We also briefly revisit valence bond theory to understand bonding in coordina-
tion compounds, but we quickly shift to a different theory—called crystal field theory—
that better explains many of the properties of these compounds. Transition metals and 
coordination compounds are important, not only because of their interesting chemis-
try, but because of their numerous applications. Coordination compounds are the basis 
for a number of therapeutic drugs, chemical sensors, and coloring agents. In addition, 
many biological molecules contain transition metals that bond in ways that are similar 
to coordination compounds. For example, the oxygen-carrying site on hemoglobin is 
an iron ion bonded partly to an amino acid in the hemoglobin molecule and partly to a 
flat molecule called a porphyrin. An oxygen molecule reversibly bonds to the iron and 
is transported throughout the body by blood flow.
	 25.1	 The Colors of Rubies and Emeralds
Rubies are deep red and emeralds are brilliant green, yet the color of both gemstones 
is caused by the same ion, Cr3+. The difference lies in the crystal that hosts the ion. 
Rubies are crystals of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) in which about 1% of the Al3+ ions are 
replaced by Cr3+ ions. Emeralds, by contrast, are crystals of beryllium aluminum silicate 

1128	
Chapter 25  Transition Metals and Coordination Compounds
3Be3Al2(SiO3)64 in which a similar percentage of the Al3+ ions is replaced by Cr3+. The 
embedded Cr3+ ion is red in the aluminum oxide crystal but green in the beryllium 
aluminum silicate crystal. Why?
The answer to this question lies in the effect that the host crystal has on the energies 
of the atomic orbitals in Cr3+. Atoms in the crystal create a field around the ion—some-
times called the crystal field—that splits the five normally degenerate d orbitals into two 
or more levels. The color of each gemstone is caused by electron transitions between 
these levels. In rubies, the crystal field is stronger (and the corresponding splitting of the 
d orbitals greater) than it is in emeralds. Recall from Chapter 7 that the  color of a sub-
stance depends on the colors absorbed by that substance, which in turn depends on the 
energy differences between the orbitals involved in the absorption. The greater splitting 
in ruby results in a greater energy difference between the d orbitals of Cr3+, and conse-
quently the absorption of a different color of light than in emerald.
The colors of several other gemstones are also caused by the splitting of the d orbit-
als in transition metal ions embedded within host crystals. For example, the red in gar-
net, which has Mg3Al2(SiO4)3 as a host crystal, and the yellow-green of peridot, which 
has Mg2SiO4 as a host crystal are both caused by electron transitions between d orbitals 
in Fe2+. Similarly, the blue in turquoise, which has 3Al6(PO4)4(OH)8 # 4 H2O42- as a host 
crystal, is due to transitions between the d orbitals in Cu2+.
In this chapter, we examine the properties of the transition metals and their ions more 
closely. We also examine the properties of coordination compounds in some detail. We first 
discussed this common type of transition metal compound in Chapter 17 (see Section 17.8). 
In a coordination compound, bonds to a central metal ion split the d orbitals much as they 
are split in the crystals of gemstones. The theory that explains the splitting and the corre-
sponding colors is crystal field theory, which we also explore in this chapter.
▲ Ruby and Emerald  The red 
color of ruby and the green color of 
emerald are both caused by Cr3+.
▲ Garnet, Peridot, and Turquoise  The red in garnet and the yellow-green of peridot are both 
caused by fe2+. The blue of turquoise is caused by Cu2+.
	 25.2	 Properties of Transition Metals
Transition metals, the elements in the d block of the periodic table, are a study in 
similarities and differences. When we compare their properties with the varied 
properties of the main-group elements, they seem markedly similar. For example, almost 
all transition metals have moderate to high densities, good electrical conductivity, high 
melting points, and moderate to extreme hardness. Their similar properties are related 
to their similar electron configurations: they all have electrons in d orbitals that can be 
involved in metallic bonding. In spite of their similarities, however, each element is also 
unique, and the transition metals exhibit a wide variety of chemical behavior. Before 
we examine some of their periodic properties, let’s review the electron configurations of 
these elements, first discussed in Chapter 8.
Electron Configurations
Recall from Section 8.4 that, as we move to the right across a row of transition elements, 
electrons are added to (n - 1)d orbitals (where n is the row number in the periodic table 
and also the quantum number of the highest occupied principal level). For example, 
as we move across the fourth-period transition metals, electrons are added to the 3d 
orbitals, as Table 25.1 shows.

	
25.2  Properties of Transition Metals	
1129
In general, the ground state electron configuration for the first 
two rows of transition elements is [noble gas] ns2(n - 1)dx and for the 
third and fourth rows it is [noble gas] ns2(n - 2)f 14(n - 1)dx, where x 
ranges from 1 to 10. Recall from Section 8.4, however, that because 
the ns and (n - 1)d sublevels are close in energy, many exceptions 
occur. For example, in the first transition series of the d block, the 
outer configuration is 4s23dx with two exceptions: Cr is 4s13d5 and 
Cu is 4s13d10. This behavior is related to the closely spaced 3d and 4s 
energy levels and the stability associated with a half-filled or com-
pletely filled d sublevel.
Recall from Section 8.7 that the transition metals form ions by 
losing electrons from the ns orbital before losing electrons from the 
(n - 1)d orbitals. For example, Fe2+ has an electron configuration of 
[Ar] 3d6 because it has lost both of the 4s electrons to form the 2+ 
charge. Examples 25.1 and 25.2 review the steps in writing electron 
configurations for transition metals and their ions.

Chapter 25  Transition Metals and Coordination Compounds
Atomic Size
As we discussed in Section 8.6, for main-group elements, the 
size of atoms decreases across a period and increases down a 
column. For transition metals, however, there is little variation 
in size across a row (other than for the first two elements in 
each transition metal row, such as Sc and Ti in the first row), as 
Figure 25.1◀ illustrates. The reason for the difference is that, 
across a row of transition elements, the number of electrons in 
the outermost principal energy level (highest n value) is nearly 
constant. As another proton is added to the nucleus with each 
successive element, another electron is added as well, but the 
electron goes into an n - 1 orbital. The number of outermost 
electrons thus stays the same, and the electrons experience a 
roughly constant effective nuclear charge as we move across the 
row, keeping the radii approximately constant.
Looking down a group, we see a small but expected increase 
in size from the first transition metal row to the second, but the 
size of elements in the third row is about the same as it is for 
those in the second row. This pattern is also different from that 
of the main-group elements, especially when we consider that 
in any given column, the third transition row has 32 more elec-
trons than the second row. The reason that the third transition row elements are not 
larger is because 14 of the 32 electrons are in a (n - 2)f  sublevel, and while electrons in f  
orbitals are in lower principal quantum levels, they are not very effective at shielding the 
outer electrons from nuclear charge. Consequently, the outer electrons are held more 
tightly by the nucleus, offsetting the typical increase in size between the periods—an 
effect called the lanthanide contraction.

Ionization Energy
The first ionization energies of transition elements follow the 
expected main-group periodic trend and slowly increase across 
a row (Figure 25.2◀), but the increase is smaller than for main-
group elements. As we move down a group, we see that the 
third transition row generally has a higher ionization energy 
than do the first two rows, a trend counter to that observed 
in the main-group elements. In the transition elements the 
charge of the nucleus increases substantially from one row 
to the next, but there is only a small increase in atomic size 
between the first and second rows, and no increase in size 
between the second and third row. The outer electrons are 
therefore held more tightly in the third transition row than in 
the first two rows.

25.2  Properties of Transition Metals	
1131
Electronegativity
The electronegativity values of the transition metals, like their ionization energies, 
follow the main-group trend and slowly increase across a row, as shown in Figure 25.3▼. 
The increase is smaller than the increase that occurs in the main-group elements, but we 
expect that given the similarity in the sizes of the atoms. The trend in electronegativity 
values down a group (or column) is another example of the transition metals behaving 
differently from the main-group elements. The electronegativity values generally 
increase from the first transition row to the second, but there is no further increase for the 
third row. In the main-group elements, in contrast, we see a decrease in electronegativity 
as we move down a group. The difference is again caused by the relatively small change 
in atomic size as we move down a column for the transition elements, accompanied by 
a large increase in nuclear charge. One of the heaviest metals, gold (Au), is also the most 
electronegative metal. Its electronegativity value (EN = 2.4) is even higher than that of 
some nonmetals (EN of P is 2.1), and compounds of an Au - ion have been observed.

The electronegativity of the transition elements 
generally increases across a row, following the 
main-group trend. However, in contrast to the main-
group trend, electronegativity increases from the 
first transition row to the second. There is little 
electronegativity difference between the second and 
third transition rows.
Oxidation States
Unlike main-group metals, which tend to exhibit only one oxidation state, the 
transition metals often exhibit a variety of oxidation states (Figure 25.4▼). The 
highest oxidation state for a transition metal is +7 for manganese (Mn). The electron 
configuration of manganese in this oxidation state corresponds to the loss of all the 
electrons in the 4s and 3d orbitals, leaving a noble gas electron configuration ([Ar]).  
This is the same configuration we see for all of the highest oxidation states of the 
elements to the left of Mn. To the right of manganese, the oxidation states are all lower, 
mostly +2 or +3. A +2 oxidation state for a transition metal is not surprising, as 4s 
electrons are readily lost.

bound to a highly electronegative 
element such as oxygen; they do not 
exist as bare ions.

Chapter 25  Transition Metals and Coordination Compounds
	 25.3	 Coordination Compounds
We discussed at the end of Chapter 17 that transition  metals tend to form complex ions. 
A complex ion contains a central metal ion bound to one or more ligands. A ligand is 
a Lewis base (or electron donor) that forms a bond with the metal. When a complex ion 
combines with one or more counterions (ions of opposite charge that are not acting as 
ligands), the resulting neutral compound is a coordination compound.

▲ Complex Ion and Coordination Compound  A coordination compound contains a complex 
ion and corresponding counterions. The complex ion contains a central metal atom coordinated 
to several ligands. The compound shown here is [Co(nH3)6]Cl3.
The first coordination compounds were discovered in the early eighteenth cen-
tury, but their nature was not understood until nearly 200 years later. Swiss chemist 
Alfred Werner (1866–1919) studied ­coordination compounds extensively—especially a 
series of cobalt(III) compounds with ammonia. The formulas for these compounds 
were then written as CoCl3 # 6 NH3, CoCl3 # 5 NH3 and, CoCl3 # 4 NH3. In 1893, Werner 
proposed that the central metal ion has two types of interactions that he named 
­primary valence and secondary valence. The primary valence is the oxidation 
state on the central metal atom, and the secondary valence is the number of mole-
cules or ions directly bound to the metal atom, called the coordination number. In 
CoCl3 # 6 NH3 the primary valence is +3, and it was discovered that the ammonia mol-
ecules are directly bound to the central cobalt, giving a coordination number of 6. 
Today we write the formula of this compound as [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 to better represent the 
coordination compound as the combination of a complex ion, Co(NH3)6
3+, and three 
Cl -  counterions.
We write the formulas of the other cobalt(III) compounds studied by Werner as 
[Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2 and [Co(NH3)4Cl2]Cl. In these two cases, the complex ions are 
Co(NH3)5Cl2+ (with two Cl - counterions) and Co(NH3)4Cl +
2  (with one Cl - counterion), 
respectively. With this series of compounds, Werner demonstrated that the Cl - can 
replace NH3 in the secondary valence. In other words, Cl - can act as a counterion, or it 
can bond directly to the metal as part of the complex ion.
The complex ion itself contains the metal ion in the center and the ligands—which 
can be neutral molecules or ions—arranged around it. We can think of the metal–ligand 
complex as a Lewis acid–base adduct (see Section 16.11) because the bond is formed

when the ligand donates a pair of electrons to an empty orbital on the metal. For exam-
ple, consider the reaction between the silver ion and ammonia:
A bond of this type, which we first encountered in Section 10.6, is often referred to as a 
coordinate covalent bond. Ligands are therefore good Lewis bases and have at least 
one pair of electrons to donate to, and bond with, the central metal ion. Table 25.2 con-
tains a number of common ligands.

Ligands that donate only one electron pair to the central metal are monodentate. 
Some ligands have the ability to donate two pairs of electrons (from two different atoms) to 
the metal; these are bidentate. Examples of bidentate ligands include the oxalate ion 
(abbreviated ox) and the ethylenediamine molecule (abbreviated en) shown here. The 
­ethylenediamine ligand bonded to Co3+ is shown in Figure 25.5(a)▼.

The EDTA ligand wraps itself completely around the metal, donating up to six pairs 
of electrons (Figure 25.5b▼). A complex ion that contains either a bidentate or polyden-
tate ligand is a chelate (pronounced “key-late”), and the coordinating ligand is known 
as a chelating agent.
A survey of many coordination compounds shows that coordination numbers can 
vary from as low as 2 to as high as 12. The most common coordination numbers are 6, as 
occurs in [Co(NH3)6]3+, and 4, as occurs in [PdCl4]2-. Coordination numbers greater 
than 6 are rarely observed for the first-row transition metals. Typically, only 1+ metal 
ions have a coordination number as low as 2, as occurs in [Ag(NH3)2] +. Odd ­coordination 
numbers exist, but they are rare.
Some ligands, called polydentate ligands, can donate even more than two elec-
tron pairs (from more than two atoms) to the metal. The most common polydentate 
ligand is the ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion (EDTA4-) shown here:

The common geometries of complex ions, shown in Table 25.3, depend in part on 
their coordination number. A coordination number of 2 results in a linear geometry, 
and a coordination number of 6 results in an octahedral geometry. A coordination num-
ber of 4 can have either a tetrahedral geometry or a square planar geometry, depending 
on the number of d electrons in the metal ion. Metal ions with a d8 electron configura-
tion (such as [PdCl4]2-) exhibit square planar geometry, and metal ions with a d10 
­electron configuration (such as [Zn(NH3)4]2+ ) exhibit tetrahedral geometry.
Naming Coordination Compounds
To name coordination compounds, we follow a series of general rules based on the system 
originally proposed by Werner. As with all salts (see Section 3.5), the name of the cation 
goes before the name of the anion.
Guidelines for Naming Complex Ions
Examples
1.	 Name the ligands.
•	 Name neutral ligands as molecules with the following 
notable exceptions:
H2O (aqua)
nH3 (ammine)
CO (carbonyl)
•	 Name anionic ligands with the name of the ion plus an 
ending modified as follows:
-ide becomes -o
-ate becomes -ato
-ite becomes -ito
nH2CH2CH2nH2 is ethylenediamine.
H2O is aqua.
CI- is chloro.
SO4
2- is sulfato.
SO3
2- is sulfito.
Table 25.4 lists the names of some common ligands.
2.	 List the names of the ligands in alphabetical order before the 
name of the metal cation.
Ammine (nH3) is listed before chloro (Cl-), which is listed before 
nitrito (nO2
-).
—Continued on the next page

Chapter 25  Transition Metals and Coordination Compounds
Guidelines for Naming Complex Ions
Examples
3.	 Use a prefix to indicate the number of ligands (when there is 
more than one of a particular type): di- (2), tri- (3), tetra- (4), 
penta- (5), or hexa- (6).
If the name of the ligand already contains a prefix, such 
as ethylenediamine, place parentheses around the ligand 
name and use bis- (2), tris- (3), or tetrakis- (4) to indicate the 
number.
Prefixes do not affect the order in which you list the 
ligands.
Trichloro indicates three Cl- ligands. Tetraammine ­indicates four 
nH3 ligands.
Tris(ethylenediamine) indicates three ethylenediamine ligands.
4.	 Name the metal.
a.	 When the complex ion is a cation, use the name of the 
metal followed by the oxidation state written with a ­roman 
numeral.
b.	 If the complex ion is an anion, drop the ending of the 
metal and add –ate followed by the oxidation state ­written 
with a Roman numeral. Some metals use the Latin root 
with the -ate ending. Table 25.5 lists the names for some 
common metals in anionic complexes.
In cations:
Co3+ is cobalt(III).
Pt2+ is platinum(II).
Cu+ is copper(I).
In anions:
Co3+ is cobaltate(III).
Pt2+ is platinate(II).
Cu+ is cuprate(I).
5.	 Write the entire name of the complex ion by listing the ligands 
first followed by the metal.
[Pt(nH3)2Cl4]2 - is diamminetetrachloroplatinate(II). [Co(nH3)6]3+ 
is hexaamminecobalt(III).

	 25.4	 Structure and Isomerization
Isomerism is common in coordination compounds. We broadly divide the isomerism 
observed in coordination compounds into two categories. Each category has 
subcategories, as shown in Figure 25.6▶, on the next page. In structural isomers, 
atoms are connected to one another in different ways, whereas in stereoisomers, atoms 
are connected in the same way but the ligands have a different spatial arrangement 
about the metal atom.
Structural Isomerism
We subdivide the broad category of structural isomers into two types: coordination 
isomers and linkage isomers. Coordination isomers occur when a coordinated 
ligand exchanges places with the uncoordinated counterion. For example, two different 
compounds have the general formula Co(NH3)5 BrCl. In one of them, the bromine 
coordinates to the metal and chloride is a counterion, pentaamminebromocobalt(II) 
chloride, [Co(NH3)5Br]Cl; in the other one, the chlorine coordinates to the metal and 
bromide is the counterion, pentaamminechlorocobalt(II) bromide, [Co(NH3)5Cl]Br.
Linkage isomers have ligands that can coordinate to the metal in different orien-
tations. For example, the nitrite ion (NO2
-) has a lone pair on the N atom as well as lone 
pairs on the O atoms—either of the two atoms can form coordinate covalent bonds with 
the metal. When the nitrite ion coordinates through the N atom, it is a nitro ligand and

in the yellow-orange complex ion pentaamminenitrocobalt(III), [Co(NH3)5NO2]2+, 
which contrasts with the red-orange complex ion pentaamminenitritocobalt(III),

Stereoisomerism
We can also subdivide the broad category of stereoisomers into two types: geometric 
isomers and optical isomers. Geometric isomers result when the ligands bonding 
to the metal have a different spatial arrangement. One type of geometric isomerism, as 
we saw in Section 21.5, is cis–trans isomerism, which in complex ions occurs in square 
planar complexes of the general formula MA2B2 or octahedral complexes of the general 
formula MA4B2. For example, cis–trans isomerism occurs in the square planar complex 
Pt(NH3)2Cl2. Figure 25.8(a)▼ shows the two distinct ways in which the ligands can be 
oriented around the metal. In one complex, the Cl- ligands are next to each other on 
one side of the molecule—this is the cis isomer. In the other complex, the Cl- ligands are 
on opposite sides of the molecule—this is the trans isomer.
Geometric isomerism also exists in the octahedral complex ion [Co(NH3)4Cl2]+. As 
shown in Figure 25.8(b)▼, the ligands arrange themselves around the metal in two ways, 
one with the Cl- ligands on the same side (the cis isomer) and another with the Cl- ligands 
◀ Figure 25.8  Cis–trans Isomerism   
(a) Cis–trans isomerism in square planar 
Pt(nH3)2Cl2. In the cis isomer, the Cl- 
ligands are next to each other on one 
side of the molecule. In the trans isomer, 
the Cl- ligands are on opposite sides of 
the molecule. (b) Cis–trans isomerism 
in octahedral [Co(nH3)4Cl2]+. In the cis 
isomer, the Cl- ligands are on the same 
side. In the trans isomer, the Cl- ligands 
are on opposite sides.

1140	
Chapter 25  Transition Metals and Coordination Compounds
on opposite sides of the metal (the trans isomer). Note that cis–trans isomerism does not 
occur in tetrahedral complexes because all bond angles around the metal are 109.5°, and 
each corner of a tetrahedron is considered to be adjacent to all three other corners.
Another type of geometric isomerism is fac–mer isomerism, which occurs in octa-
hedral complexes of the general formula MA3B3. For example, in Co(NH3)3Cl3, the 
ligands arrange themselves around the metal in two ways (Figure 25.9▼). In the fac 
isomer the three Cl- ligands are all on one side of the molecule and make up one face 
of the octahedron (fac is short for facial). In the mer isomer the three ligands form an 
arc around the middle of the octahedron (mer is short for meridian).

Cl- ligands are on one side of the molecule 
and make up one face of the octahedron. In 
the mer isomer, the three ligands inscribe 
an arc around the middle (or meridian) of 
the octahedron.
The second category of stereoisomerism is optical isomerism. Recall from Section 
21.3 that optical isomers are nonsuperimposable mirror images of one another. If you 
hold your right hand up to a mirror, the image in the mirror looks like your left hand.

SOLUTION 
The ethylenediamine (en) ligand is 
bidentate, so each occupies two coordi-
nation sites. Each Cl- is monodentate, 
occupying one site. The total coordina-
tion number is 6, so this must be an 
­octahedral complex.

All the ligands are monodentate, so the 
total coordination number is 4. Ni2+ is a 
d8 electronic configuration, so we 
expect a square planar complex.
Identify if this is cis–trans or ­ 
fac–mer isomerism.
With ethylenediamine occupying four

hand. Molecules or ions that exhibit this quality are chiral. The isomers are enantiomers, 
and they exhibit the property of optical activity (the rotation of polarized light).  
The complex ion [Co(en)3]3+ is nonsuperimposable on its mirror image, so it is a chiral 
complex (Figure 25.10▼).

Continued—
The previous examples demonstrate optical isomerism in octahedral complexes. 
Tetrahedral complexes can also exhibit optical isomerism, but only if all four coordina-
tion sites are occupied by different ligands. Square planar complexes do not normally 
exhibit optical isomerism as they are superimposable on their mirror images.
	 25.5	 Bonding in Coordination Compounds
The bonding in complex ions and coordination compounds can be described by valence 
bond theory, which helps us to understand the geometries of the complex ions. However, 
other properties of complex ions, such as their 
colors and their magnetic properties, require a 
different model called crystal field theory. We 
examine both models in this section.
Valence Bond Theory
Recall from Section 10.6 that according   
to valence bond theory, a coordinate 
covalent bond is the overlap between a 
completely filled atomic orbital and an 
empty atomic orbital. In complex ions, 
the filled orbital is on the ligand, and the 
empty orbital is on the metal ion. The metal 
ion orbitals are hybridized according to the 
geometry of the complex ion. The common 
hybridization 
schemes 
are 
shown 
in 
Figure 25.11◀. An octahedral complex ion 
requires six empty orbitals in an octahedral 
arrangement on the metal ion. A full set 
of d2sp3 hybrid orbitals results in the exact 
orbitals needed for this geometry. A set of 
sp3 hybrid orbitals results in a tetrahedral 
arrangement of orbitals, a set of dsp2 hybrid

orbitals results in a square planar arrangement, and a set of 
sp hybrid orbitals results in a linear arrangement of orbitals. 
In each case, the coordinate covalent bond is formed by 
the overlap between the orbitals on the ligands and the 
hybridized orbitals on the metal ion.
Crystal Field Theory
Crystal field theory (CFT) is a bonding model for transition 
metal complexes that helps us to understand their colors 
and magnetic properties. To illustrate the basic principles 
of CFT, we examine the central metal atom’s d orbitals in an 
octahedral complex.
Octahedral Complexes
The basic premise of CFT is that 
complex 
ions 
form 
because 
of 
attractions between the electrons on 
the ligands and the positive charge 
on the metal ion. However, the 
electrons on the ligands also repel 
the electrons in the unhybridized 
metal d orbitals. CFT focuses on these 
repulsions. Figure 25.12▶ shows how 
the 
ligand 
positions 
superimpose 
on the d orbitals in an octahedral 
complex. Notice that the ligands in an 
octahedral complex are located in the 
same space as the lobes of the dx2 - y2 
and dz2 orbitals. The repulsions between electron pairs in the ligands and any potential 
electrons in the d orbitals result in an increase in the energies of these orbitals. In 
contrast, the dxy, dxz, and dyz orbitals lie between the axes and have nodes directly on 
the axes, which results in less repulsion and lower energies for these three orbitals. 
In other words, the d orbitals—which are degenerate in the bare metal ion—are split 
into higher- and lower-energy levels because of the spatial arrangement of the ligands 
(Figure 25.13▼). The difference in energy between these split d orbitals is known 
as the crystal field splitting energy (Δ). The magnitude of the splitting depends on 
the particular complex. In strong-field complexes, the splitting is large, and in  
weak-field complexes, the splitting is small.

Chapter 25  Transition Metals and Coordination Compounds
The Color of Complex Ions and Crystal Field Strength
We discussed in the opening section of this chapter that transition metals in 
host crystals often show brilliant colors because of the crystal field splitting 
of their d orbitals. Solutions of complex ions display brilliant colors because 
of similar splittings. For example, an [Fe(CN)6]3- solution is deep red, and an 
[Ni(NH3)6]2+ solution is blue (Figure 25.14◀).
Recall from Chapter 7 that the color of an object is related to the absorp-
tion of light energy by its electrons. If a substance absorbs all of the visible 
wavelengths, it appears black. If it transmits (or reflects) all the wavelengths 
(absorbs no light), it appears colorless. A substance appears to be a particular 
color if it absorbs some visible light but also transmits (or reflects) the wave-
lengths associated with that color. A substance also appears to be a given 
color if it transmits (or reflects) most wavelengths but absorbs the comple-
mentary color on a color wheel (Figure 25.15▼). For example, a substance that 
absorbs green light (the complement of red) will appear red. A solution of 
[Ti(H2O)6]3+ is purple because it absorbs strongly between 490 and 580 nm, 
the yellow-green region of the visible spectrum (Figure 25.16(a)▼).
The easiest way to measure the energy difference between the d orbitals in a 
complex ion is to use spectroscopy to determine the wavelength of light absorbed 
when an electron makes a transition from the lower-energy d orbitals to the higher-
energy ones. With that information we can calculate the crystal field splitting 
energy, Δ:
Ephoton = hn = hc
l = Δ
Consider the [Ti(H2O)6]3+ absorption spectrum shown in Figure 25.16(b)▼. The 
maximum absorbance is at 498 nm. Using this ­wavelength, we calculate Δ:
 Δ = hc
l =
(6.626 * 10-34 J # s)(3.00 * 108 m>s)
(498 nm * 1 * 10-9 m>nm)
 Δ = 3.99 * 10-19 J
This energy corresponds to a single [Ti(H2O)6]3+ ion. We can convert to kilojoules per 
mole:

Example 25.8	
Crystal Field Splitting Energy
The complex ion [Cu(NH3)6]2+ is blue in aqueous solution. Estimate the crystal field splitting energy (in kJ/mol) for this ion.
Solution
Begin by consulting the color wheel to determine approxi-
mately which wavelength is being absorbed.
Because the solution is blue, you can deduce that orange 
light is absorbed since orange is the complementary color  
to blue.
Estimate the absorbed wavelength.
The color orange ranges from 580 to 650 nm, so you can 
estimate the average wavelength as 615 nm.
Calculate the energy corresponding to this wavelength, 
using E = hc>l. This energy corresponds to Δ.
 E =
(6.626 * 10 - 34 J # s)(3.00 * 108 m>s)
(615 nm)(1 * 10 - 9 m>nm)
 E = 3.23 * 10 - 19 J = Δ
Convert J>ion into kJ>mol.
 E =
(3.23 * 10 - 19 J>ion)(6.02 * 1023 ion>mol)
(1000 J>kJ)
 Δ = 195 kJ>mol
For Practice 25.8  The complex ion [Co(NH3)5NO2]2+ is yellow. Estimate the crystal field splitting energy (in kJ>mol) 
for this ion.
The magnitude of the crystal field splitting in a complex ion—and, therefore 
whether it is a strong-field or a weak-field complex—depends in large part on the ligands 
attached to the central metal ion. Spectroscopic studies of various ligands attached to 
the same metal allow us to arrange different ligands in order of their ability to split the d 
orbitals. This list is known as the spectrochemical series and is arranged from ligands that 
result in the largest Δ to those that result in the smallest:
CN- 7 NO2
- 7 en 7 NH3 7 H2O 7 OH- 7 F- 7 Cl- 7 Br- 7 I-
	
large Δ	
small Δ
	
typically strong-field ligands	
typically weak-field ligands
Ligands that produce large values of Δ are strong-field ligands, and those that give small 
values of Δ are weak-field ligands.
The metal ion also has an effect on the magnitude of Δ. If we examine different metal 
ions with the same ligand, we find that Δ increases as the charge on the metal ion increases. 
The greater charge on the metal draws the ligands closer, causing greater repulsion with the 
d orbitals and therefore a larger Δ. An example of this behavior occurs in the complex ions 
between NH3 (a ligand in the middle of the spectrochemical series) and the +2 or +3 oxida-
tion states of cobalt. Hexaamminecobalt(II) ion, [Co(NH3)6]2+, has a weak crystal field 
(small Δ) and hexaamminecobalt(III) ion, [Co(NH3)6]3+, has a strong field (large Δ).

Connection 25.2
 
Weak- and Strong-Field Ligands  Two ligands, A and B, form complexes 
with a particular metal ion. When the metal ion complexes with ligand A, the resulting 
solution is red. When the metal ion complexes with ligand B, the resulting solution is 
yellow. Which of the two ligands produces the larger Δ?
Magnetic Properties
The strength of the crystal field can affect the magnetic properties of a transition metal 
complex. Recall that, according to Hund’s rule, electrons occupy degenerate orbitals 
singly as long as an empty orbital is available. When the energies of the d orbitals are split

one does not.

by ligands, the lower-energy orbitals fill first. Once they are half-filled, the next electron 
can either: (1) pair with an electron in one of the lower-energy half-filled orbitals by 
overcoming the electron–electron repulsion associated with having two electrons in 
the same orbital; or (2) go into an empty orbital of higher energy by overcoming the 
energy difference between the orbitals—in this case, the crystal field splitting energy, Δ. 
The magnitude of Δ compared to the electron–electron repulsions determines which of 
these two actually occurs.
We can compare two iron(II) complexes to see the difference in behavior under 
strong- and weak-field conditions. [Fe(CN)6]4- is known to be diamagnetic, and 
[Fe(H2O)6]2+ is known to be paramagnetic. Both of these complexes contain Fe2+, which 
has an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d6. In the case of [Fe(CN)6]4-, CN- is a strong-field 
ligand that generates a large Δ, so it takes more energy to occupy the higher-energy level 
than it does to pair the electrons in the lower-energy level. The result is that all six elec-
trons are paired and the compound is diamagnetic, as shown in the accompanying figure 
in the margin.
In [Fe(H2O)6]2+, H2O is a weak-field ligand that generates a small Δ, so the electron 
pairing energy is greater than Δ. Consequently, the first five electrons occupy the five d 
orbitals singly and only the sixth pairs up, resulting in a paramagnetic compound with 
four unpaired electrons, as shown in the accompanying figure in the margin.
In general, complexes with strong-field ligands have fewer unpaired electrons rela-
tive to the free metal ion and are therefore called low-spin complexes. Complexes 
with weak-field ligands, by contrast, have the same number of unpaired electrons as the 
free metal ion and are high-spin complexes.
When we examine the orbital diagrams of the d1 through d10 metal ions in octahe-
dral complexes, we find that only d 4, d 5, d6, and d7 metal ions have low- and high-spin 
possibilities. Since there are three lower-energy d orbitals, the d1, d2, and d3 metal ions 
always have unpaired electrons, independent of Δ. In the d8, d9, and d10 metal ions, the 
three lower-energy orbitals are completely filled, so the remaining electrons fill the two 
higher orbitals (as expected according to Hund’s rule), also independent of Δ.

Tetrahedral and Square Planar Complexes
So far, we have examined the d orbital energy changes only for octahedral complexes, 
but transition metal complexes can have other geometries, such as tetrahedral and 
square planar. We use crystal field theory to determine the d orbital splitting pattern for 
these geometries as well. For a tetrahedral complex, the d orbital splitting pattern is the 
opposite of the octahedral splitting pattern: three d orbitals (dxy, dxz, and dyz) are higher 
in energy, and two d orbitals (dx2 - y2 and dz2) are lower in energy (Figure 25.17▼). Almost 
all tetrahedral complexes are high-spin because of reduced ligand–metal interactions. 
The d orbitals in a tetrahedral complex interact with only four ligands, as opposed to six 
in the octahedral complex, so the value of Δ is generally smaller.

	 25.6	 Applications of Coordination 
Compounds
Coordination compounds are found in living systems, in industry, and even in 
household products. Recall from Chapter 24 how silver and gold metals are extracted 
from their respective ores using cyanide complexes and how nickel metal is extracted 
by forming the gaseous carbonyl complex, Ni(CO)4. In this section, we describe a few 
additional applications of coordination compounds.

Chapter 25  Transition Metals and Coordination Compounds
Chelating Agents
In Section 25.3, we introduced the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion 
(EDTA4-). This ligand has lone pairs on six different donor atoms that can interact 
with a metal ion to form very stable metal complexes. EDTA is used to treat victims of 
heavy metal poisoning such as lead poisoning. The patient is given [Ca(EDTA)]2- and 
because the lead complex (Kf = 2 * 1018) is more stable than the calcium complex 
(Kf = 4 * 1010), the lead displaces the calcium. The body excretes the lead complex and 
leaves behind the calcium, which is nontoxic (and is in fact a nutrient).
Chemical Analysis
Some ligands are selective in their binding, preferring specific metal ions; these 
ligands can be used in chemical analysis. For example, dimethylglyoxime (dmg) 
is used to chemically analyze a sample for Ni2+ or Pd2+. In the presence of Ni2+, an 
insoluble red precipitate forms, and in the presence of Pd2+, an insoluble yellow 
precipitate forms. Similarly, the SCN- ligand is used to test for Co2+ or Fe3+. In the 
presence of Co2+ a blue solution forms, and in the presence of Fe3+ a deep red solution 
forms (Figure 25.19◀).
Coloring Agents
Because of the wide variety of colors found in coordination complexes, they are often 
used as coloring agents. For example, a commercially available agent, iron blue, is a 
mixture of the hexacyano complexes of iron(II) and iron(III). Iron blue is used in ink, 
paint, cosmetics (eye shadow), and blueprints.
Biomolecules
Living systems contain many molecules based on metal complexes. Hemoglobin 
(involved in oxygen transport), cytochrome c (involved in electron transport), 
carbonic anhydrase (involved in respiration), and chlorophyll (involved in 
photosynthesis) all have coordinated metal ions that are critical to their structure 
and function. Table 25.7 summarizes the biological significance of many of the other 
first-row transition metals.

stream to areas throughout the body that are depleted in oxygen, where oxygen is 
released and replaced by a water molecule. The hemoglobin then travels back to the 
lungs to repeat the cycle.

Chlorophyll, shown in Figure 25.22◀, is another porphyrin-based biomolecule. In 
chlorophyll the porphyrin is not surrounded by a protein, and the coordinated metal is

Carbonic Anhydrase
In carbonic anhydrase, the zinc ion is bound in a tetrahedral complex, with three of 
the coordination sites occupied by nitrogen atoms from surrounding amino acids and 
the fourth site available to bind a water molecule (Figure 25.23▼). Carbonic anhydrase 
catalyzes the reaction between water and CO2 in respiration:
H2O(l) + CO2(g) ∆H+(aq) + HCO3
-(aq)
▲ Figure 25.23  Carbonic Anhydrase  Carbonic anhydrase contains a zinc ion that is 
bound in a tetrahedral complex, with three of the coordination sites occupied by nitrogen 
atoms from surrounding amino acids. The fourth site is available to bind a water molecule.
A water molecule alone is not acidic enough to react with a CO2 molecule at a sufficient 
rate. When the water molecule is bound to the zinc ion in carbonic anhydrase, the positive 
charge on the metal draws electron density from the O¬ H bond and the H2O becomes 
more acidic—sufficiently so to readily lose a proton. The resulting bound OH- easily reacts 
with a CO2 molecule, and the reaction is much faster than the uncatalyzed version.
Drugs and Therapeutic Agents
In the mid-1960s, researchers found that the platinum(II) complex cis-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2], 
known as cisplatin, is an effective anticancer agent (Figure 25.24◀). Interestingly, 
the closely related geometric isomer trans-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2] has little or no effect on 
cancer tumors. Cisplatin is believed to function by attaching itself to the cancer cell’s 
DNA and replacing the Cl- ligands with donor atoms from the DNA strands. The cis 
arrangement of the Cl- ligands corresponds to the geometry required to bind to the 
DNA strands. The trans isomer, though closely related, cannot bind properly due to 
the arrangement of the Cl- ligands and is therefore not an effective agent. Cisplatin 
and other closely related platinum(II) complexes are still used today in chemotherapy 
for certain types of cancer and are among the most effective anticancer agents 
available for these cases.

Chapter 25  Transition Metals and Coordination Compounds
Key Concepts
Electron Configurations (25.2)
▶
▶As we move across a row of transition elements, electrons add to 
the (n - 1)d orbitals, resulting in a general electron configura-
tion for the first- and second-row transition elements of [noble 
gas] ns2(n - 1)dx and for the third and fourth rows of [noble gas] 
ns2(n - 2)f 14(n - 1)dx, where x ranges from 1 to 10.
▶
▶A transition element forms a cation by losing electrons from the 
ns orbitals before losing electrons from the (n - 1)d orbitals.
Periodic Trends (25.2)
▶
▶The variations in atomic size, ionization energy, and electro-
negativity across a row in the periodic table are similar to those 
of main-group elements (although the trends are less pro-
nounced and less regular). As we move down a group, however, 
atomic size increases from the first row to the second but stays 
roughly constant from the second row to the third because of 
the lanthanide contraction. This contraction results in ioniza-
tion energy and electronegativity trends as we move down a 
column that are opposite of the main-group elements.
Composition and Naming of Coordination 
Compounds (25.3)
▶
▶A coordination compound is composed of a complex ion and a 
counterion.
▶
▶A complex ion contains a central metal ion bound to one or more 
ligands. The number of ligands directly bound to the metal ion is 
the coordination number.
▶
▶The ligand forms a coordinate covalent bond to the metal ion by 
donating a pair of electrons to an empty orbital on the metal.
▶
▶Ligands that donate a single pair of electrons are monodentate. 
A ligand that donates two pairs of electrons is bidentate, and a 
­ligand that donates more than two pairs is polydentate.
▶
▶In naming coordination compounds, we use the name of the cat-
ion followed by the name of the anion. To name a complex ion, we 
use the guidelines outlined in Section 25.3.
Types of Isomers (25.4)
▶
▶We broadly divide the isomerism observed in coordination com-
pounds into two categories: structural isomers, in which atoms 
are connected differently to one another, and stereoisomers, 
in which atoms are connected in the same way but the ligands 
have a different spatial arrangement about the metal atom.
▶
▶Structural isomers are either coordination isomers (a coordinated 
ligand exchanges places with an uncoordinated counterion) or 
linkage isomers (a particular ligand has the ability to coordinate 
to the metal in different ways).
▶
▶Stereoisomers are either geometric isomers (the ligands bonded 
to the metal have a different spatial arrangement relative to each 
other, leading to cis–trans or fac–mer isomers) or optical isomers 
(nonsuperimposable mirror images).
Crystal Field Theory (25.5)
▶
▶Crystal field theory is a bonding model for transition metal complex 
ions. The model describes how the degeneracy of the d orbitals is 
broken by the repulsive forces between the electrons on the ligands 
around the metal ion and the d orbitals in the metal ion.
▶
▶The energy difference between the split d orbitals is the crystal 
field splitting energy (Δ). The magnitude of Δ depends in large 
part on the ligands bound to the metal.
▶
▶Octahedral complexes with a d4, d5, d6, or d7 metal ion can have 
two possible electronic configurations with different numbers of 
unpaired electrons. The first, called high-spin, has the same num-
ber of unpaired electrons as the free metal ion and is usually the 
result of a weak crystal field. The second, called low-spin, has fewer 
unpaired electrons than the free metal ion and is usually the result 
of a strong crystal field.

Conceptual Problems
	 78. 	Two ligands, A and B, both form complexes with a particular 
metal ion. When the metal ion complexes with ligand A, the 
solution is green. When the metal ion complexes with ligand B, 
the solution is violet. Which of the two ligands results in the 
largest Δ?

	 80. 	The complexes of Fe3+ have magnetic properties that depend

Questions for Group Work
Discuss these questions with the group and record your consensus 
answer.
	 81.	Choose a row of the transition metals in the periodic table. 
Have each group member look up and graph (where appropri-
ate) a separate trend for the elements in that row, choosing from 
electron configuration, atomic size, ionization energy, and elec-
tronegativity. Each member should present a graph to the 
group and describe the general trend and any notable excep-
tions. If possible, form new groups made up of individuals who 
researched the same property for different rows of the periodic 
table.
	 82. 	Have each group member write down the names and formulas 
for two coordination compounds. Taking turns, show each for-
mula to the group and have the rest of the group name the com-
pound, with each member contributing one step in the process. 
Once all group members have had their formulas named, repeat 
the process by showing each formula name to the group and 
having group members determine the correct formula.
	 83.	Working individually, draw a pair of coordination compounds 
that are isomers. Take turns showing your drawings to the group 
and having them identify the type of isomerism and the rea-
sons your drawing demonstrates that type of isomerism. If your 
group misidentifies your type of isomerism, rather than telling 
them the correct answer right away, point out the part of the 
structure that prevents it from being the type of isomerism they 
thought it was.
	 84. 	Divide the electron configurations d1 through d10 among the 
group members so that every configuration is assigned to at 
least two group members. Working individually, draw the or-
bital diagram for the configurations assigned to you, including 
both high-spin and low-spin diagrams where possible. Present 
your diagrams to your group. Combine everyone’s diagrams 
into one set for the group.
	 85.	Working individually, review one of the applications of

Data Interpretation and Analysis 
Qualitative Test for Fe3+ Ions in Solution
	 86. 	Many aqueous solutions of complex ions display brilliant  
colors that depend on the identities of the metal ion and 
ligand(s). Some ligands bind selectively to certain metal ions, 
producing complex ions with characteristic colors. These 
­distinctive ­complex ions serve as qualitative indicators of the  
presence of particular metal ions. For example, Fe3+ is identified 
by 
the 
rapid 
formation 
of 
the 
intensely 
colored  
pentaaquathio-cyanatoiron(III) complex ion, [Fe(H2O)5SCN]2+, 
when ­thiocyanate, SCN -, is added to a solution containing 
hexaaquairon(III), [Fe(H2O)6]3+, according to the following 
chemical equation:
[Fe(H2O)6]3+(aq) + SCN-(aq) ∆[Fe(H2O)5SCN]2+(aq)

Answers to Conceptual Connections
Atomic Size
25.1	 The element W has the larger radius because it is in the third 
transition row and Fe is in the first. Atomic radii increase from 
the first to the second transition row and stay roughly constant 
from the second to the third.
Weak- and Strong-Field Ligands
25.2	 Ligand B forms a yellow solution, which means that the com-
plex absorbs in the violet region. Ligand A forms a red solution, 
which means that the complex absorbs in the green. Since the 
violet region of the electromagnetic spectrum is of shorter 
wavelength (higher energy) than the green region, ligand B 
produces a higher Δ.

If the decimal point is moved to the left, as in the previous 
example, the exponent is positive. If the decimal is moved to 
the right, the exponent is negative:
0.00034

10−4
×
=
To express a number in scientific notation:
1.	
Move the decimal point to obtain a number between 1 
and 10.
2.	
Write the result from step 1 multiplied by 10 raised to 
the number of places you moved the decimal point.
• The exponent is positive if you moved the decimal  
point to the left.
• The exponent is negative if you moved the decimal  
point to the right.
Consider the following additional examples:
290,809,000
 = 2.90809 * 108
 0.000000000070 m = 7.0 * 10-11 m
Multiplication and Division
To multiply numbers expressed in scientific notation, 
­multiply the decimal parts and add the exponents:
(A * 10m)(B * 10n) = (A * B) * 10m + n
To divide numbers expressed in scientific notation, divide the 
decimal parts and subtract the exponent in the denominator 
from the exponent in the numerator:
(A * 10m)
(B * 10n) = a A
B b * 10m - n
Consider the following example involving multiplication:
 (3.5 * 104)(1.8 * 106) = (3.5 * 1.8) * 104 + 6
 = 6.3 * 1010
Consider the following example involving division:
 (5.6 * 107)
(1.4 * 103)
= a 5.6
1.4 b * 107 - 3
 = 4.0 * 104
A. Scientific Notation
A number written in scientific notation consists of a ­decimal 
part, a number that is usually between 1 and 10, and an  
exponential part, 10 raised to an exponent, n:

Exponential part
Decimal part

Exponent (n)
Each of the following numbers is written in both scien-
tific and decimal notation:
 1.0 * 105 = 100,000   1.0 * 10-5 = 0.000010
 6.7 * 103 = 6700    6.7 * 10-3 = 0.0067
A positive exponent (n) means 1 multiplied by 10 n times:
 100 = 1
 101 = 1 * 10
 102 = 1 * 10 * 10 = 100
 103 = 1 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000
A negative exponent (-n) means 1 divided by 10 n times:
 10-1 = 1
10 = 0.1
 10-2 =
1
10 * 10 = 0.01
 10-3 =
1
10 * 10 * 10 = 0.001
To convert a number to scientific notation, we move the 
decimal point to obtain a number between 1 and 10 and then 
multiply by 10 raised to the appropriate power. For example, 
to write 5983 in scientific notation, we move the decimal 
point to the left three places to get 5.983 (a number between 
1 and 10) and then multiply by 1000 to make up for moving 
the decimal point:
5983 = 5.983 * 1000
Since 1000 is 103, we write:
5983 = 5.983 * 103
We can do this in one step by counting how many places we 
move the decimal point to obtain a number between 1 and 10 
and then writing the decimal part multiplied by 10 raised to 
the number of places we moved the decimal point:
5983
5.983

Appendix I  Common Mathematical Operations in Chemistry 
1000 is 3 because 10 must be raised to the third power to get 
1000. The logs of several multiples of 10 are shown here:
 log 10 = 1
 log 100 = 2
 log 1000 = 3
 log 10,000 = 4
Because 100 = 1 by definition, log 1 = 0.
The log of a number smaller than one is negative because 
10 must be raised to a negative exponent to get a number 
smaller than one. For example, the log of 0.01 is -2 because 
10 must be raised to -2 to get 0.01. Similarly, the log of 0.001 
is -3 because 10 must be raised to -3 to get 0.001. The logs of 
several fractional numbers are shown below:
 log 0.1 = -1
 log 0.01 = -2
 log 0.001 = -3
 log 0.0001 = -4
The logs of numbers that are not multiples of 10 can be 
­computed on your calculator. See your calculator manual for 
specific instructions.
Inverse Logarithms
The inverse logarithm or invlog function is exactly the oppo-
site of the log function. For example, the log of 100 is 2 and 
the inverse log of 2 is 100. The log function and the invlog 
function undo one another:
 log 100 = 2
 invlog 2 = 100
 invlog(log 100) = 100
The inverse log of a number is 10 rasied to that number:
 invlog x = 10x
 invlog 3 = 103 = 1000
The inverse logs of numbers can be computed on your calcula-
tor. See your calculator manual for specific instructions.
Natural (or Base e) Logarithms
The natural (or base e) logarithm (abbreviated ln) of a number 
is the exponent to which e (which has the value of 2.71828…) 
must be raised to obtain that number. For ­example, the ln of 
100 is 4.605 because e must be raised to 4.605 to get 100. Simi-
larly, the ln of 10.0 is 2.303 because e must be raised to 2.303 
to get 10.0.
The inverse natural logarithm or invln function is exactly 
the opposite of the ln function. For example, the ln of 100 is 
Addition and Subtraction
To add or subtract numbers expressed in scientific notation, 
rewrite all the numbers so that they have the same exponent, 
then add or subtract the decimal parts of the numbers. The 
exponents remained unchanged:
 A * 10n
 {B * 10n
(A { B) * 10n
Notice that the numbers must have the same exponent. 
Consider the following example involving addition:
4.82 * 107
+3.4 * 106
First, express both numbers with the same exponent. In this 
case, you rewrite the lower number and perform the addition 
as follows:
 4.82 * 107
 +0.34 * 107
 5.16 * 107
Consider the following example involving subtraction:
7.33 * 105
-1.9 * 104
First, express both numbers with the same exponent. In this 
case, you rewrite the lower number and perform the subtrac-
tion as follows:
 7.33 * 105
 -0.19 * 105
 7.14 * 105
Powers and Roots
To raise a number written in scientific notation to a power, 
raise the decimal part to the power and multiply the expo-
nent by the power:
 (4.0 * 106)2 = 4.02 * 106 * 2
 = 16 * 1012
 = 1.6 * 1013
To take the nth root of a number written in scientific no-
tation, take the nth root of the decimal part and divide the 
exponent by the root:
 (4.0 * 106)1>3 = 4.01>3 * 106>3
 = 1.6 * 102
B. Logarithms
Common (or Base 10) Logarithms
The common or base 10 logarithm (abbreviated log) of a 
number is the exponent to which 10 must be raised to obtain 
that number. For example, the log of 100 is 2 because 10 must 
be raised to the second power to get 100. Similarly, the log of

the following relationship between the volume of a gas and 
its pressure:
4.605 and the inverse ln of 4.605 is 100. The inverse ln of a 
number is simply e raised to that number:
 invln x = ex
 invln 3 = e3 = 20.1
The invln of a number can be computed on your calculator. 
See your calculator manual for specific instructions.
Mathematical Operations Using 
­Logarithms
Because logarithms are exponents, mathematical operations 
involving logarithms are similar to those involving ­exponents 
as follows:
log(a * b) = log a + log b   ln(a * b) = ln a + ln b
log a
b = log a - log b 
  ln a
b = ln a - ln b
log an = n log a 
  ln an = n ln a
C. Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation contains at least one term in which 
the variable x is raised to the second power (and no terms in 
which x is raised to a higher power). A quadratic equation has 
the following general form:
ax2 + bx + c = 0
A quadratic equation can be solved for x using the quadratic 
formula:
x = -b { 2b2 - 4ac
2a
Quadratic equations are often encountered when solving 
equilibrium problems. Here we show how to use the quadrat-
ic formula to solve a quadratic equation for x:
3x2 - 5x + 1 = 0 (quadratic equation)
 x = -b { 2b2 - 4ac
2a
 = -(-5) { 2(-5)2 - 4(3)(1)
2(3)
 = 5 { 3.6
6
 x = 1.43 or x = 0.233
As you can see, the solution to a quadratic equation usually 
has two values. In any real chemical system, one of the val-
ues can be eliminated because it has no physical significance. 
(For example, it may correspond to a negative concentration, 
which does not exist.)
D. Graphs
Graphs are often used to visually show the relationship 
­between two variables. For example, in Chapter 5 we show

▲ Volume versus Number of Moles  The volume of a gas sample 
increases linearly with the number of moles of gas in the sample.
The horizontal axis is the x-axis and is normally used to 
show the independent variable. The vertical axis is the y-axis 
and is normally used to show how the other variable (called 
the dependent variable) varies with a change in the indepen-
dent variable. In this case, the graph shows that as the pres-
sure of a gas sample increases, its volume decreases.
Many relationships in chemistry are linear, which means 
that if you change one variable by a factor of n the other vari-
able will also change by a factor of n. For example, the volume 
of a gas is linearly related to the number of moles of gas. When 
two quantities are linearly related, a graph of one versus the 
other produces a straight line. For example, the graph below 
shows how the volume of an ideal gas sample depends on the 
number of moles of gas in the sample:
A linear relationship between any two variables x and y 
can be expressed by the following equation:
y = mx + b

A-4	
Appendix I  Common Mathematical Operations in Chemistry 
where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept. The 
slope is the change in y divided by the change in x:
m =
∆y
∆x
For the graph above, we can estimate the slope by sim-
ply estimating the changes in y and x for a given interval. For 
example, between x = 0.4 mol and 1.2 mol, ∆x = 0.80 mol 
and we can estimate that ∆y = 18 L. Therefore the slope is:
m =
∆y
∆x =
18 L
0.80 mol = 23 mol>L
In several places in this book, logarithmic relationships 
­between variables can be plotted in order to obtain a ­linear 
relationship. For example, the variables [A]t and t in the 
­following equation are not linearly related, but the natural 
logarithm of [A]t and t are linearly related:
 ln[A]t = -kt + ln[A]0
 y = mx + b
A plot of ln[A]t versus t will therefore produce a straight line 
with slope = -k and y-intercept = ln[A]0.

135.	 If the amu and mole were not based on the same 
isotope, the numerical values obtained for an atom of 
material and a mole of material would not be the same. 
If, for example, the mole were based on the number 
of particles in C-12 but the amu were changed to a 
fraction of the mass of an atom of Ne-20, the number 
of particles and the number of amu that make up one 
mole of material would no longer be the same. We 
would no longer have the relationship in which the 
mass of an atom in amu is numerically equal to the 
mass of a mole of those atoms in grams.
137.	 The different isotopes of the same element have the 
same number of protons and electrons, so the attrac-
tive forces between the nucleus and the electrons 
are constant and there is no difference in the radii of 
the isotopes. Ions, on the other hand, have a dif-
ferent number of electrons than the parent atom 
from which they are derived. Cations have fewer 
electrons than the parent atom. The attractive forces 
are greater because there is a larger positive charge in 
the nucleus than the negative charge in the electron 
cloud. So, cations are smaller than the atom they 
are derived from. Anions have more electrons than 
the parent. The electron cloud has a greater negative 
charge than the nucleus, so the anions have larger 
radii than the parent.

133.	 14 g KO2. In designing the unit, you would need to 
consider the theoretical yield and % yield of the reac-
tion, how changing the limiting reactant would affect 
the reaction, and the stoichiometry between KO2 and 
O2 to determine the mass of KO2 required to produce 
enough O2 for 10 minutes. You might also consider the 
speed of the reaction and whether or not the reaction 
produced heat. Additionally, because your body does 
not use 100% of the oxygen taken in with each breath, 
the apparatus would only need to replenish the oxygen 
used. The percentage of oxygen in air is about 20% and 
the percentage in exhaled air is about 16%, so you can 
assume that 4% of the air would need to be replenished 
with oxygen.

of constant volume. When a fuel is burned under 
constant pressure some of the energy released does 
work on the atmosphere by expanding against it. Less 
energy is manifest as heat due to this work. When a 
fuel is burned under constant volume, all of the energy 
released by the combustion reaction is evolved as heat.

Krypton’s outer electron shell is filled, giving it chemi-
cal stability. Bromine is missing an electron from its 
outer shell and subsequently has a high electron affin-
ity. Bromine tends to be easily reduced by gaining an 
electron, giving the bromide ion stability due to the 
filled p subshell that corresponds to krypton’s chemi-
cally stable electron configuration.
	 93.	 V: [Ar] 4s23d3
	
V3+: [Ar] 3d2
	
Both V and V3+ contain unpaired electrons in their 3d 
orbitals.
	 95.	 A substitute for K+ would need to exhibit a 1+ electric 
charge and have similar mass and atomic radius. Na+ 
and Rb+ would not be good substitutes because their 
radii are significantly smaller and larger, respectively. 
Based on mass, Ca+ and Ar+ are the closest to K+. 
Because the first ionization energy of Ca+ is closest to 
that of K+, Ca+ is the best choice for a substitute. The 
difficulty lies in Ca’s low second ionization energy, 
making it easily oxidized.

d.	Aluminum’s first ionization energy is lower than 
Mg because its 3p electron is shielded by the 3s or-
bital. Oxygen’s first ionization energy is lower than 
that of N because its fourth 2p electron experiences 
electron–electron repulsion by the other electron in 
its orbital.
101.	 For main-group elements, atomic radii decrease across 
a period because the addition of a proton in the 
nucleus and an electron in the outermost energy level 
increases Zeff. This does not happen in the transition 
metals because the electrons are added to the nhighest - 1 
orbital and the Zeff stays roughly the same.
103.	 Noble gases are exceptionally unreactive due to the 
stability of their completely filled outer quantum levels 
and their high ionization energies. The ionization 
energies of Kr, Xe, and Rn are low enough to form some 
compounds.
105.	 6A: ns2np4, 7A: ns2np5, group 7A elements require only 
one electron to achieve a noble gas configuration. 
Since group 6A elements require two electrons, their 
affinity for one electron is less negative because one 
electron will merely give them an np5 configuration.

It seems Ar will also have 2.69 * 1022 atoms>L.
	
	
dAr = 1.78 g>L. This corresponds to accepted values.
117.	 Density increases to the right because, though elec-
trons are added successively across the period, they are 
added to the 3d subshell, which is not a part of the out-
ermost principal energy level. As a result, the atomic 
radius does not increase significantly across the period, 
while mass does.

123.	 A relatively high effective nuclear charge is found in 
gallium with its completed 3d subshell and in thallium 
with its completed 4f subshell, accounting for the rela-
tively high first ionization energies of these elements.
125.	 The second electron affinity requires the addition of 
an electron to something that is already negatively 
charged. The monoanions of both of these elements 
have relatively high electron density in a relatively 
small volume. As we shall see in Chapter 9, the dian-
ions of these elements do exist in many compounds 
because they are stabilized by chemical bonding.

135.	 Since Ca has valence electrons of 4s2, it has a relatively 
low ionization energy to lose two electrons. F has a 
highly exothermic electron affinity when gaining one 
electron but not a second electron because of its 2s22p5 
valence electrons. Therefore, calcium and fluoride 
combine in a 2:1 ratio.
141.	 a.	 First ionization energy increases from left to right 
because effective nuclear charge increases.
	
c.	 The first ionization energy of P is about the same as 
S because the electrons in S are paired in the same 
orbital, so that even though effective nuclear charge 
is higher in S, the effect of the repulsion between 
the paired electrons makes the first ionization ener-
gies similar.

	 43.	 As the size of the alkaline earth metal ions increases, 
so does the distance between the metal cations and 
oxygen anions. Therefore, the magnitude of the lattice 
energy decreases accordingly because the potential 
energy decreases as the distance increases.
	 45.	 One factor of lattice energy is the product of the 
charges of the two ions. The product of the ion charges 
for CsF is -1, while that for BaO is -4. Because this 
product is four times greater, the lattice energy is also 
four times greater.

are all sp3 hybridized. This hybridization results in a 
tetrahedral electron group configuration with a 109.5° 
bond angle. NH3 and H2O deviate from this idealized 
bond angle because their lone electron pairs exist in 
their own sp3 orbitals. The presence of lone pairs lowers 
the tendency for the central atom’s orbitals to hybrid-
ize. As a result, as lone pairs are added, the bond angle 
moves further from the 109.5° hybrid angle and closer 
to the 90° unhybridized angle.

+, the central N has two electron groups, so the

- 
the central N has three electron groups, two bonds 
and one lone pair. The ideal hybridization is sp2, but 
the ONO bond angle should close down a bit because 
of the lone pair. A bond angle around 115° is a good 
guess. In NO2 there are three electron groups, but one 
group is a single electron. Again, the ideal hybridiza-
tion would be sp2, but since one unpaired electron

sigma bond combined with a pi bond, and a triple 
bond as a double bond with an additional pi bond. 
Molecular orbital theory defines a single bond, double 
bond, and triple bond as a bond order of 1, 2, or 3, 
respectively, between two atoms.

	 51.	 When the tube is clean, water experiences adhesive 
forces with glass that are stronger than its cohesive 
forces, causing it to climb the surface of a glass tube. 
Water does not experience strong intermolecular forces 
with oil, so if the tube is coated in oil, the water’s cohe-
sive forces will be greater and it will not be attracted to 
the surface of the tube.
	 53.	 The water in the 12-cm dish will evaporate more 
quickly. The vapor pressure does not change, but the 
surface area does. The water in the dish evaporates 
more quickly because the greater surface area allows for 
more molecules to obtain enough energy at the surface 
and break free.

have a strong effect on temperature.
	 83.	 The general trend is that melting point increases with 
increasing mass. This is because the electrons of the

	 97.	 Decreasing the pressure will decrease the temperature 
of liquid nitrogen. Because the nitrogen is boiling,  
its temperature must be constant at a given pressure. 
As the pressure decreases, the boiling point decreases, 
and therefore so does the temperature. If the pressure 
drops below the pressure of the triple point, the phase 
change will shift from vaporization to sublimation and 
the liquid nitrogen will become solid.

105.	 The water within a container with a larger surface area 
will evaporate more quickly because there is more 
surface area for the molecules to evaporate from. Vapor 
pressure is the pressure of the gas when it is in dynamic 
equilibrium with the liquid. The vapor pressure is 
dependent only on the substance and the temperature. 
The larger the surface area, the more quickly it will 
reach the dynamic state.
107.	 The triple point will be at a lower temperature since 
the fusion equilibrium line has a positive slope. This 
means that we will be increasing both temperature 
and pressure as we travel from the triple point to the 
normal melting point.
109.	 The liquid segment will have the least steep slope be-
cause it takes the most kJ>mol to raise the temperature 
of the phase.
111.	 There are substantial intermolecular attractions in the

e.	 Yes. Since polarizability correlates with the disper-

To obtain this structure, the monomer from part a 
would react in a head-to-head (or tail-to-tail) addition 
as opposed to the head-to-tail addition that leads to 
the structure shown in Table 12.3.
	 93.	 Because the structure is face-centered cubic, there are 
therefore four C60 molecules per unit cell. Thus there 
must be 3 * 4 = 12 Rb atoms per unit cell, and all sites 
(tetrahedral and octahedral) are occupied.
	 95.	 The liquid must be cooled quickly in order to prevent 
the formation of an organized crystal structure, and 
instead achieve an amorphous product.
	 97.	 Both structures may be viewed as having essentially a 
face-centered cubic unit cell with half of the tetrahe-
dral holes filled. Diamond, however, consists of only 
one type of atom (C) and is covalently bound, whereas 
zinc blende has S2- ions at the face-centered cubic 
sites and Zn2+ ions in the tetrahedral holes, and is held 
together by ionic forces.

129.	 Piso = 0.131 atm, Ppro = 0.068 atm. The major intermo-
lecular attractions are between the OH groups. The OH 
group at the end of the chain in propyl alcohol is more 
accessible than the one in the middle of the chain in 
isopropyl alcohol. In addition, the molecular shape of 
propyl alcohol is a straight chain of carbon atoms, while 
that of isopropyl alcohol is a branched chain and is more 
like a ball. The contact area between two ball-like objects 
is smaller than that of two chain-like objects. The smaller 
contact area in isopropyl alcohol means the molecules 
don’t attract each other as strongly as do those of propyl 
alcohol. As a result of both of these factors, the vapor 
pressure of isopropyl alcohol is higher.
131.	 0.005 m
133.	 Na2CO3 0.050 M, NaHCO3 0.075 M
135.	 The water should not be immediately cycled back into 
the river. As the water was warmed, dissolved oxygen 
would have been released, since the amount of a gas able 
to be dissolved into a liquid decreases as the temperature 
of the liquid increases. As such, the water returned to the 
river would lack dissolved oxygen if it was still hot. To pre-
serve the dissolved oxygen necessary for the survival of 
fish and other aquatic life, the water must first be cooled.

	 95.	 With one exception, the formation of any oxide of 
nitrogen at 298 K requires more moles of gas as reac-
tants than are formed as products. For example, 1 mol 
of N2O requires 0.5 mol of O2 and 1 mol of N2, 1 mol 
of N2O3 requires 1 mol of N2 and 1.5 mol of O2, and so 
on. The exception is NO, where 1 mol of NO requires 
0.5 mol of O2 and 0.5 mol of N2:
1
2 N2(g) + 1
2 O2(g) ¡ NO(g)
	
This reaction has a positive ∆S because what is 
­essentially mixing of the N and O has taken place in 
the product.

	 99.	 a.	Positive, the process is spontaneous. It is slow unless 
a spark is applied.
	
b.	Positive, although the change in the system is not 
spontaneous; the overall change, which includes 
such processes as combustion or water flow to gen-
erate electricity, is spontaneous.
	
c.	Positive, the acorn-oak tree system is becoming 
more ordered, so the processes associated with 
growth are not spontaneous. But they are driven 
by spontaneous processes such as the generation 
of heat by the sun and the reactions that produce 
energy in the cell.

105.	 a.	 -95.3 kJ>mol. Since the number of moles of 
reactants and products is the same, the decrease in 
volume affects the entropy of both equally, so there 
is no change in ∆G.
	
b.	102.8 kJ>mol. The entropy of the reactants (1.5 mol) 
is decreased more than the entropy of the product 
(1 mol). Since the product is relatively more favored 
at lower volume, ∆G is less positive.
	
c.	204.2 kJ>mol. The entropy of the product (1 mol) 
is decreased more than the entropy of the reactant 
(0.5 mol). Since the product is relatively less favored, 
∆G is more positive.

107.	 Nuclide A is more dangerous because the half-life is 
shorter (18.5 days) and so it decays faster.
109.	 Iodine is used by the thyroid gland to make hor-
mones. Normally we ingest iodine in foods, especially 
iodized salt. The thyroid gland cannot tell the differ-
ence between stable and radioactive iodine and will 
absorb both. KI tablets work by blocking radioactive 
iodine from entering the thyroid. When a person 
takes KI, the stable iodine in the tablet gets absorbed 
by the thyroid. Because KI contains so much stable 
iodine, the thyroid gland becomes “full” and cannot 
absorb any more iodine—either stable or radioactive—
for the next 24 hours.

hedral shape with the atoms at the corners of the tetra-
hedron. This allotrope is unstable because of the strain 
from the bond angles. Red phosphorus is much more 
stable because one bond of the tetrahedron is broken, 
allowing the phosphorus atoms to make chains with 
bond angles that are less strained.

The base is weaker than ammonia because of electron 
withdrawal by the electronegative nitro group.
	 99.	 The triple bond in nitrogen is much stronger than the 
double bond in oxygen, so it is much harder to break. 
This makes it less likely that the bond in nitrogen will 
be broken.
101.	 Sodium dinitrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4) can act as a 
weak base or a weak acid. A buffer can be made by mix-
ing it with either Na2HPO4 or with Na3PO4, depending 
on the desired pH of the buffer solution.
103.	 F is extremely small and so there is a huge driving force 
to fill the octet by adding an electron, giving a -1  
oxidation state. Other halogens have access to  
d ­orbitals, which allows for more hybridization and 
oxidation state options.
105.	 SO3 cannot be a reducing agent because the oxidation 
state of S is +6, the highest possible oxidation state for 
S. Reducing agents need to be able to be oxidized. SO2

	 23.	 The flux is a material that will react with the gangue to 
form a substance with a low melting point. MgO is the 
flux.
	 25.	 Hydrometallurgy is used to separate metals from ores 
by selectively dissolving the metal in a solution, filter-
ing out impurities, and then reducing the metal to its 
elemental form.
	 27.	 The Bayer process is a hydrometallurgical process by 
which Al2O3 is selectively dissolved, leaving other 
oxides as solids. The soluble form of aluminum is 
Al(OH)4
-.
	 29.	 Sponge powdered iron contains many small holes in 
the iron particles due to the escaping of the oxygen 
when the iron is reduced. Water-atomized powdered 
iron has much smoother and denser particles as the 
powder is formed from molten iron.

	 33.	 Cr and Fe are very close to each other in mass, so their 
respective atomic radii are probably close enough to 
form an alloy. Also, they both form body-centered 
cubic structures.
	 35.	 A: solid, 20% Cr, 80% Fe
	
B: liquid, 50% Cr, 50% Fe

	 49.	 rutile: 33.3% Ti by moles, 59.9% Ti by mass
	 	
ilmenite: 20.0% Ti by moles, 31.6% Ti by mass
	 51.	 Titanium must be arc-melted in an inert atmosphere 
because the high temperature and flow of elec-
trons would cause the metal to oxidize in a normal 
­atmosphere.
	 53.	 TiO2 is the most important industrial product of 
titanium, and it is often used as a pigment in white 
paint.
	 55.	 The Bayer process is a hydrometallurgical process 
used to separate Al2O3 from other oxides. The Al2O3 
is selectively dissolved by hot, concentrated NaOH. 
The other oxides are removed as solids, and the 
Al2O3 precipitates out of solution when the solution 
is neutralized.
	 57.	 cobalt and tungsten
	 59.	 3.3 kg Fe, 2.0 kg Ti
	 61.	 Four atoms surround a tetrahedral hole, and six atoms 
surround an octahedral hole. The octahedral hole is 
larger because it is surrounded by a greater number of 
atoms.
	 63.	 Mn has one more electron orbital available for bonding 
than does chromium.
	 65.	 Ferromagnetic atoms, like paramagnetic ones, have 
unpaired electrons. However, in ferromagnetic  
atoms, these electrons align with their spin oriented 
in the same direction, resulting in a permanent 
­magnetic field.
	 67.	 The nuclear charge of the last three is relatively high

Then reduce the oxide with coke.
CoO(s) + C(s) ¡  Co(s) + CO(g)
	
The oxides of arsenic are relatively volatile and can be 
separated, but they are poisonous.
	 77.	 Au and Ag are found in elemental form because of their 
low reactivity. Na and Ca are group 1 and group 2 met-
als, respectively, and are highly reactive as they readily 
lose their valence electrons to obtain octets.
	 84.	 a.	 Because they are stronger and harder.
	 	
c.	 Tin, 232 °C; Lead 328 °C
	 	
e.	 Because the melting range is neither too sharp nor 
too broad.  It has a pasty range that helps it to set, 
but then  hardens quickly.

Since the bond order is positive, the H2
+ ion should 
be stable; however, the bond order of H2
+ is lower 
than the bond order of H2 (bond order = 1). There-
fore, the bond in H2
+ is weaker than in H2.
10.10.	 The bond order of N2
+ is 2.5, which is lower than 
that of the N2 molecule (bond order = 3); therefore, 
the bond is weaker. The MO diagram shows that the

	 Since ∆G°rxn is negative, the reaction is spontaneous
