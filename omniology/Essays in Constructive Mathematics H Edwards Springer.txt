Preface 
He [Kronecker] was, in fact, attempting to describe and to initiate a new 
branch of mathematics, which would contain both number theory and alge-
braic geometry as special cases.—Andre Weil [62] 
This book is about mathematics, not the history or philosophy of mathemat-
ics. Still, history and philosophy were prominent among my motives for writing 
it, and historical and philosophical issues will be major factors in determining 
whether it wins acceptance. 
Most mathematicians prefer constructive methods. Given two proofs of 
the same statement, one constructive and the other not, most will prefer the 
constructive proof. The real philosophical disagreement over the role of con-
structions in mathematics is between those—the majority—who believe that 
to exclude from mathematics all statements that cannot be proved construc-
tively would omit far too much, and those of us who believe, on the contrary, 
that the most interesting parts of mathematics can be dealt with construc-
tively, and that the greater rigor and precision of mathematics done in that 
way adds immensely to its value. 
Mathematics came to a fork in the road around 1880. On one side, 
Dedekind, Cantor, and Weierstrass advocated accepting transfinite "construc-
tions" like those needed to prove the Bolzano-Weierstrass "theorem." On the 
other, Kronecker argued that no such departure from the standards of proof 
adhered to by Dirichlet and Gauss was necessary and that the Aristotelian 
exclusion of completed infinites could be maintained. As we all know, the first 
group carried the day, and the Dedekind-Cantor-Weierstrass road was the 
one taken. 
The new orthodoxy was consolidated by Hilbert a century ago, and has 
reigned ever since, despite occasional challenges, notably from Brouwer and 
Bishop. During this century, the phrase "foundations of mathematics" has 
come to mean for most working mathematicians the complex of ideas sur-
rounding the axioms of set theory and the axiom of choice, matters that for 

X 
Preface 
Kronecker had no mathematical meaning at all, much less foundational mean-
ing. 
Why, a hundred years after this choice was made, and made so decisively, 
do I believe that the road Kronecker proposed might win new consideration? 
The advent of computers has had a profound impact on mathematics and 
mathematicians that has already altered views about the nature and meaning 
of mathematics in a way favorable to Kronecker. The new technology causes 
mathematics to be taught and experienced in a much more computational 
way and directs attention to algorithms. 
In other words, it fosters construc-
tive attitudes. My own preference for constructive formulations was shaped 
by my experience with computer programming in the 1950s, and computer 
programming at that time was trivial by today's standards. 
No evidence supports the image that is so often presented of Kronecker as 
a vicious and personal critic of Cantor and Weierstrass—another instance of 
history being written by the victors. As far as I have been able to discover, 
Kronecker vigorously opposed the views of Cantor and Weierstrass, as well as 
those of Dedekind, with whom he was on far better terms, but he was not 
hostile to the men themselves. Moreover, his opposition to their views—which 
was of course reciprocated—was rarely expressed in his publications. In the 
rare instances in which he mentioned such issues, he merely stated his belief 
that the new ways of dealing with infinity that were coming to be accepted 
were unnecessary. 
Instead of excoriating nonconstructive methods, as legend 
would have us believe, he concentrated his efforts on backing up his beliefs 
with concrete mathematical results proved constructively. 
No one doubts that Kronecker was one of the giants of nineteenth-century 
mathematics, but it is often said that he succeeded in his works because he 
ignored the strictures that he advocated in his philosophy. This view of the 
relation of Kronecker's mathematics to his philosophy is often ascribed to 
Poincare, but as I have written elsewhere [21], this ascription is based on 
a misinterpretation of a passage [53] in which Poincare writes about issues 
unrelated to the treatment of infinity in mathematics. Indeed, no one who has 
studied Kronecker's works could believe that he accepted completed infinites 
or made use of nonconstructive arguments. Like many other mathematicians 
since, he was impatient with the philosophy of mathematics and wanted only 
to get on with his mathematics itself, but for him "mathematics" was always 
constructive. 
That attitude inspires these essays. My goal has been not to argue against 
the prevailing orthodoxy, but to show that substantial mathematics can be 
done constructively, and that such mathematics is interesting, illuminating, 
and concordant with the new algorithmic spirit of our times. I have given ex-
amples of what I mean by constructive mathematics, without trying to define 
it. The underlying idea is well expressed in the essay of Poincare mentioned 
above, in which he says that the guiding principle for both Kronecker and 
Weierstrass was to "derive everything from the natural numbers" so that the 
result would "partake of the certainty of arithmetic." I regard the natural 

Preface

numbers not as a completed infinite set but as a means of describing the ac-
tivity of counting. 
(See Essay 1.1.) The essence of constructive mathematics 
for me hes in the insistence upon treating infinity, in Gauss's phrase, as a 
fagon de parler, a shorthand way of describing ideas that need to be restated 
in terms of finite calculations when it comes to writing a formal proof. 
It will surely be remarked that almost all of the topics treated in the essays 
come from algebra and number theory. They not only partake of the certainty 
of arithmetic, as Poincare says, they are arithmetic—what Kronecker called 
"general arithmetic." (Again, see Essay 1.1.) But there are three exceptions. 
In Essay 4.4, Newton's polygon is treated as a method of constructing an 
infinite series, which means, constructively, as an algorithm for generating ar-
bitrarily many terms of the series. Convergence is not an issue because the 
theory treats the series themselves, not their limits in any sense. In Essay 5.1, 
a complex root of a given polynomial—a convergent sequence of rational com-
plex numbers whose limit is a root of the polynomial—is found by an explicit 
construction. Finally, Essay 5.4, which sketches a proof of the spectral theo-
rem for symmetric matrices of integers, necessarily deals with real numbers, 
that is, with convergent sequences of rationals. 
An essay is "a short literary composition on a single subject, usually pre-
senting the personal views of the author." There is nothing literary about 
these essays, but they do treat their mathematical subjects from a personal 
point of view. For example. Essay 5.1 explains why the "fundamental the-
orem of algebra" is misnamed—in a very real sense it isn't even true—and 
Essay 1.2 explains why Euclid's statement of Proposition 1 of Book 1 of the 
Elements^ 
"On a given finite straight line to construct an equilateral trian-
gle" is better than "Given a straight line segment, there exists an equilateral 
triangle of which it is one of the sides," the form in which most of Euclid's 
present-day successors would state it. These are my opinions. To my dismay, 
it is incessantly borne in on me how few of my colleagues share them and 
how completely mathematicians today misunderstand and reject them. These 
compositions try—they essay—to present them in a way that will permit the 
reader to see past the preconceptions that stand between what I regard as 
a commonsense attitude toward the study of mathematics and the attitudes 
most commonly accepted today. They essay to reopen the Kroneckerian road 
not taken.

Synopsis 
The essays are divided into five parts: 
A Fundamental Theorem 
Topics in Algebra 
Some Quadratic Problems 
The Genus of an Algebraic Curve 
Miscellany 
The fundamental theorem of Part 1 constructs a splitting field for a given 
polynomial. As is shown in Part 2, the case in which the given polynomial 
has coefficients in a ring of the form Z[ci, C2, ..., Cj^]—a ring of polynomials 
in some set of indeterminates ci, C2, .. •, Cj^ with integer coefficients—suffices 
for the apparently more general case of a polynomial f{x) whose coefficients 
are "algebraic quantities" in a very general sense. For this reason, only poly-
nomials with coefficients in Z[ci, C2, ..., Cjy] are considered in Part 1. 
Another way to state the problem "Construct a splitting field for a given 
polynomial" is "Extend the notion of computation with polynomials with 
integer coefficients in such a way that the given polynomial can be written 
as a product of linear factors." Computation in Z[ci, C2, ..., Cj^] involves 
just addition, subtraction, and multiplication, but it extends to computations 
involving division in the field of quotients of the integral domain Z[ci, C2, 
..., c^y] in the same way that computation in the ring of integers extends to 
computation in the field of rational numbers. As Gauss's lemma shows (Essay 
1.4), this extension does not affect the factorization of polynomials. A simple 
further extension of Z[ci, C2, ..., c^^] is effected by "adjoining" one root of 
a monic, irreducible polynomial with coefficients in Z[ci, C2, ..., Cy] to the 
field of rational functions. This simple construction, which Galois used with 
amazing success, although with some lack of rigor, is generally known as a 
"simple algebraic extension" of the field of quotients of Z[ci, C2, ..., c^y]. For 
the sake of brevity, I have called a field constructed in this way the "root field" 
of the monic, irreducible polynomial used in its construction (Essay 1.3). 

xiv 
Synopsis 
With this specific description of the way in which computations in Z[ci, 
C2, . •., c^y] are to be extended, the construction problem to be solved becomes, 
"Given a polynomial / with coefficients in Z[ci, C2, . . . , c^y], find an auxiliary 
polynomial g with coefficients in the same ring such that g is monic and 
irreducible and such that its root field splits / " in the sense that / can be 
written as a product of linear factors with coefficients in the root field of g. 
The problem, then, is, "Given / construct ^f." The solution in Part 1 is 
iterative. Suppose that ^ is a failed attempt at a solution. Thus, the factor-
ization of / over the root field of g contains at least one irreducible factor 
of degree greater than 1. The iteration needs to construct a better attempt 
at a solution. Specifically, it needs to construct a new auxiliary polynomial, 
call it gi, with the property that the factorization of / over the root field of 
gi contains more linear factors than does the factorization of / over the root 
field of ^f. If gi fails to split / , the same procedure can be applied again to find 
a g2 that gives / more linear factors than gi did. Since the number of linear 
factors of / increases with each new ^, and since the number of such factors 
is bounded above by the degree of / , such an iteration must eventually reach 
a solution of the problem—an attempted g that does not fail. 
To make this sketch into an actual iterative construction of a splitting field 
for / requires two main steps. First, given / and an attempt at g^ one needs 
to be able to factor f when it is regarded as a polynomial 
with coefficients 
not 
in Z[ci, C2, ' • y Ci,] hut in its extension, 
the root field of g. The difficult step 
in the construction of a splitting field for / is the algorithmic solution of this 
factorization problem. The algorithm is set forth in Essay 1.5, with examples, 
and the proof that it achieves its objective is in Essay 1.6. The relation of the 
algorithm to Kronecker's solution of the same factorization problem is among 
the subjects discussed in Essay 1.7. Second, one needs to describe explicitly 
how to pass from a g that fails to split / to a new gi that comes closer to 
splitting / . The underlying idea of the construction is simple: Because g does 
not split / , there is an irreducible factor, call it (/), of / over the root field of g 
whose degree is greater than 1. Adjoin to the root field of g a root of (j). This 
double adjunction, first of a root of g and then of a root of 0, gives a field 
over which / has more linear factors—a field in which / has more roots— 
because it contains a root of 0, and the root field of g did not. The problem 
is to write this double adjunction as a simple one—specifically as the field 
obtained by adjoining a root of a new gi with coefficients in Z[ci, C2, •.., c^y]. 
The construction of such a gi is given in Essay 1.8. 
Finally, although there are infinitely many polynomials g that split / , there 
is only one splitting field of / in the sense that if ^ is a minimal 
splitting 
polynomial of / 
one that is itself split by any polynomial that splits /—the 
root field of g is isomorphic to the root field of any other minimal splitting 
polynomial of / . 
The end result is a theorem that in my opinion deserves the name "Fun-
damental Theorem of Algebra" much more than the theorem that is and 
probably always will be known by that name: Given a polynomial 
f (in one 

Synopsis 
xv 
variable) with coefficients in Z[ci, C2, ..., Cjy] there is an explicit way to ex-
tend rational computations in Z[ci, C2, .. -, Cj^] so that f factors into linear 
factors; moreover, any two minimal ways of doing this are isomorphic. For 
the relation of this theorem to the "Fundamental Theorem of Algebra" see 
Essay 5.1. 
The theorem of Part 1 that has just been described is implicitly contained— 
with no hint of a proof—in Lemma III of Galois's treatise [27] on the algebraic 
solution of equations (see [22]). In this sense, it is the foundation of Galois 
theory. The connection is explained in Essays 2.1 and 2.3. Essay 2.2 is devoted 
to justifying Kronecker's assertion that every field of algebraic quantities is 
isomorphic to the root field of a polynomial with coefficients in some Z[ci, 
C2, ...; Cj^] as that concept was defined in Part 1. This fact is the basis of 
Kronecker's later view—despite the fact that he had previously given the title 
Foundations of an Arithmetical Theory of Algebraic Quantities to his ma-
jor publication—that "algebraic quantities" were unnecessary in mathemat-
ics and that algebraic questions should be studied using "general arithmetic" 
instead (see Essay 1.1). 
The algorithmic description of fields of algebraic quantities in terms of 
"adjunction relations" in Essay 2.3 gives a construction of the splitting field 
of a polynomial that is very close to Chebotarev's in his excellent but little-
known book on Galois theory [8]. 
The construction of the splitting field of a general monic polynomial of 
degree n in Essay 2.4 proves another basic theorem of Galois—another to 
which Galois gave no hint of a proof—that the Galois group of an nth-degree 
polynomial f{x) whose coeflacients are 'letters' is the full symmetric group. 
The splitting field is explicitly given by adjunction relations fi{ai) — 0, where 
(1) 
fi{x) - 
^^""^ 
{x - ai){x - 0^2) • • • {x - 
ai-i) 
is the irreducible polynomial satisfied by a root a^ of f{x) whose coefficients 
are polynomials in the roots o^i, 0:2, ..., o^i-i already adjoined. (The right 
side of (1), as it stands, is of course not a polynomial; it becomes one once 
i — 1 roots ai, 0^2, • • •, <^z-i of /(^) have been adjoined and the divisions (1) 
calls for have been performed.) The degree n! of the extension is of course the 
product of the degrees of these adjunction relations. The nub of the matter is 
the proof that each fi{x) is irreducible over the field generated by ai, 0^2, • • •, 
ai-i. These ideas stem from Kronecker, as does the fundamental theorem of 
divisor theory in Essay 2.5. 
Part 3 deals with different matters altogether. Its primary inspiration is 
Gauss's proof of quadratic reciprocity in Section 5 of the Disquisitiones Arith-
meticae^ but the proof is recast by translating it from a study of quadratic 
forms and their composition to a study of modules and their multiplication. 
The "modules" involved are entities of the following type. With "number" 
meaning a number 0, 1, 2, ..., let a "hypernumber" for a given A mean 

xvi 
Synopsis 
an expression y -\- x\/~A in which x and y are numbers. Such hyper numbers 
can be added and multiphed, and, when the sizes of the coefficients allow it, 
subtracted as well. It is natural to assume that the given A is not a square, 
because otherwise, y -f- x\/A 
would be a number, and nothing new would be 
found by computing with hypernumbers. It will also be assumed that A is 
positive, 
but this assumption is made for the sake of simplicity and has no 
particular justification except that the case of positive A suffices for the proof 
of quadratic reciprocity. 
Let mi, 7722, • • • 5 ^/x be a list of hypernumbers. Two hypernumbers a and 
b will be said to be congruent 
mod [mi, m2, ..., 
ruk], denoted by a = 6 mod 
[mi, m2, . . . , rn^], if they can be made equal by adding sums of multiples 
(with multipliers that are hypernumbers) of m i , m2, . . . , m^ to each. This 
is a simple generalization of Gauss's definition of a = 6 mod m, which means 
that a and b can be made equal by adding multiples of m to each. (This form 
of the definition eliminates the need for negative numbers in the discussion of 
congruences.) A module is a list of hypernumbers [mi, m2, . . . , m^] written 
between square brackets to indicate that they are to be used to define a 
congruence relation in this way. Two modules are equal if they define the 
same congruence relation. Essay 3.2 gives all these definitions, along with an 
algorithm for determining whether two given modules are equal. 
When the product of two lists is defined to be the list that contains all 
products with one term from the first list and one from the second, the module 
determined by the product depends only on the modules determined by the 
factors, so the operation gives a way to multiply modules. Since the multipli-
cation defined in this way is clearly associative and commutative, the modules 
for a given A form a commutative 
semigroup 
in which the module [1] is an 
identity. 
One more level of abstraction is needed for the most interesting construc-
tion. Let a module be called principal if it can be represented by a list 
[y + x^/A] with just one hypernumber and if, in addition, that hypernumber 
satisfies y'^ > Ax'^. The principal modules are a subsemigroup 
of the semi-
group of modules—which means simply that a product of principal modules 
is principal—so there is an associated quotient structure: Two modules are 
equivalent if they can be made equal by multiplying each by a principal 
module. (That is. Mi ~ M2 means there are principal modules Pi and P2 
for which Mi Pi — M2P2') The equivalence classes of modules for a given A 
defined in this way form a finite semigroup, which I call the class semigroup. 
It can be determined for each given A by algorithms described in Essay 3.3. 
These algorithms are essentially the same as Gauss's methods in Section 5 of 
the Disquisitiones 
for determining the equivalence classes of binary quadratic 
forms for a given "determinant" A^ but in my opinion they are simpler in con-
ception. Some rudimentary facts about class semigroups are proved in Essay 
3.4 that are then used in Essay 3.5 to prove the law of quadratic reciprocity. 
The final two essays of Part 3 relate the multiplication of modules to 
Gauss's composition of binary quadratic forms by showing how, given two 

Synopsis 
xvii 
binary quadratic forms, the theory of multiphcation of modules can be used 
to determine whether there is a third binary quadratic form that composes 
them in Gauss's sense, and, if so, to find all such compositions. Once this con-
nection is clearly made, it seems to me that the module-and-multiplication 
formulation will have more appeal than the form-and-composition formula-
tion. But whether or not the module-and-multiplication version is preferred 
over Gauss's, it has the advantage of relating directly to Gauss's, thereby 
making Gauss's masterpiece more accessible to modern readers whose famil-
iarity with Dirichlet's simplification of it may, for reasons explained in Essay 
3.6, be an impediment. 
Part 4, on the genus of an algebraic curve, is inspired by Abel's great memoir of 
1826 (first published, thanks to the negligence of the Paris Academy, in 1841). 
The inspiration for the algorithmic method of Part 4 goes back even further, 
to Newton's method of constructing infinite series expansions of algebraic 
functions, commonly known today as "Newton's polygon." 
The construction used in Part 4 (see Essay 4.1) to describe the genus of a 
curve is based on ideas of Abel that predate the theory of Riemann surfaces 
by many years, and it makes no reference to complex numbers, much less to 
Riemann surfaces. Let an algebraic curve xi^^v) 
— 0 be given (where x is 
an irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients that contains both x and 
y and, for simplicity, is monic in y), and let a large number N of points on 
the curve also be given. Choose a rational function 0 on the curve with many 
zeros (it will have equally many poles, of course) including zeros at all of the 
N given points. An algebraic variation of the N points is a variation of the 
N points that can be achieved as a variation of the N special zeros of the 
rational function 0 when the coeflicients of 9 are varied in such a way that the 
remaining zeros and all of the poles remain unchanged. (It is assumed that 
the N given zeros are points where x is finite, and the poles are specifically 
taken to be the poles of x^ for some large z/, but in fact any set of poles will 
do, as long as there are enough of them, and the zeros can also be at points 
where x is infinite.) The N zeros then vary with N — g degrees of freedom, 
where the number ^, the genus of the curve, depends only on the curve, not 
on the other choices. 
To make this rough idea of the genus of x(^, ^) = 0 into a definition re-
quires, of course, that much more be said. Although the natural first step 
might seem to be the introduction of complex numbers in order to deal rigor-
ously with the zeros and poles of ^ on x(x, 2/) = 0, the approach taken in Part 
4 is quite the opposite: It dispenses with the notion of zeros and poles alto-
gether. Just as the degree of a polynomial determines the number of its roots, 
general conditions on rational functions 6 can be related heuristically to the 
notions of zeros and poles of 9 on the curve xi^^v) — 0 ^^d their locations. 
On this basis, one can give a satisfactory description of rational functions 9 
on x{x,y) = 0 with prescribed poles of prescribed multiplicity, all in terms of 
"general arithmetic"—the arithmetic of polynomials with integer coefficients. 

xviii 
Synopsis 
Then Abel's description of the genus can be given sohd, constructive meaning 
in terms of the number of free coefficients in 0 when conditions are placed on 
its zeros and poles, a description that uses nothing but general arithmetic. 
Essay 4.2 relates Abel's construction to Euler's addition formula for elliptic 
curves and to the geometric description of addition on an elliptic curve that 
is so familiar in the present time of great interest in elliptic curves. Essay 4.3 
gives the details of the definition of the genus of x(x, ^) = 0 in these terms. 
Essay 4.4 is an exposition of the Newton algorithm. The task of the al-
gorithm is to construct a solution y oi xi^iV) 
— 0 ^s an infinite series of 
(possibly) fractional powers of x. In constructive mathematics an infinite se-
ries must of course be presented as an algorithm that generates the successive 
terms of the series, and this is what the Newton algorithm does. More pre-
cisely, the input to the algorithm is a truncated series solution 7/ of x(^, ?/) = 0 
and the algorithm generates one further term of the series. In the early stages, 
a truncated solution may be ambiguous, meaning that it may be extended in 
more than one way, and the algorithm must determine all possible extensions; 
eventually, as is proved in the essay, a set of unambiguous truncated solutions 
is reached, each of which is prolonged by the algorithm with the addition of 
one more term in just one way and therefore represents an infinite series so-
lution. (Note that convergence is not an issue, because the series itself—not 
any kind of limit of the series—is the objective.) 
Essay 4.5 gives an algebraic method of evaluating the genus as it was 
defined in Essay 4.3. Essay 4.6 gives a simpler description of the genus as the 
dimension of the vector space of holomorphic differentials on the curve. 
These differentials are the ones that have no poles, and they have the property 
that the algebraic variations of a set of A^ points on the curve are described 
by the differential equations 
N 
^hj{xi,yi)dxi 
= 0 for j = 1, 2, ..., ^, 
where the differentials hj{x,y)dx 
are a basis of the space of holomorphic 
differentials. Essay 4.7 uses the holomorphic differentials on a curve to state 
and prove the Riemann-Roch theorem as a formula for the number of arbitrary 
constants in a rational function with given poles. 
The last essay of Part 4 proves that the genus is a birational invariant, 
even though the method of Essay 4.5 for computing it depends on the choice 
of a parameter x on the curve. This important result can be stated as follows: 
In the terminology of Essay 2.2, the field of rational functions on an algebraic 
curve is an algebraic field of transcendence degree one. The genus as it is 
defined above depends only on this field itself, not on the particular presen-
tation of it as a root field that is used in the definition. This conclusion is 
established, in essence, by showing that if x and z are different parameters on 
the curve then hdx is Si holomorphic differential (relative to the parameter x)

The miscellany of Part 5 begins with a proof of what is called the Fundamental 
Theorem of Algebra—in fact two proofs of it. But my main point in that essay 
is that this theorem is not truly a theorem of algebra at all because it relates 
in an essential way to the nonalgebraic notion of complex numbers. The next 
essay gives a proof of the Sylow theorems in the theory of finite groups, and 
the following two summarize the constructive and algorithmic approach of my 
1995 book on linear algebra. My hope is that Linear Algebra and the present 
book will reinforce one another—this book making the case for the clarifying 
power of algorithmic methods and Linear Algebra giving yet another example 
of that power. The final essay is a further correction to the Kronecker legend. 

A Fundamental Theorem 
Essay 1.1 General Arithmetic 
La derniere chose qu^on trouve en faisant un ouvrage c^est de savoir celle 
qu^il fallait mettre la premiere. (The last thing one discovers in composing 
a work is what should be put first.)—Pascal, Pensees 
Kronecker quoted this saying of Pascal in the first of a series of lectures he 
gave on the concept of number.* It may have been a somewhat rueful reflection 
on his own experience with his 1881 treatise Grundzilge einer arithmetischen 
Theorie der algebraischert Grossen (Elements of an Arithmetical Theory of 
Algebraic Quantities) [39], which contains at least two indications that he al-
tered his point of view profoundly while writing it, deciding ultimately that 
the subject of his title was not the one he should be dealing with at all. In 
his introduction to the treatise and in point IV of its last section he speaks 
of reducing the entire theory of "algebraic quantities" to the theory of ratio-
nal functions of variables. In later works he did just that. For example, in 
Ein Fundamentalsatz der allgemeinen Arithmetik [42] and Uber den Zahlbe-
griff [43], both published in 1887, he emphasized the importance of rational 
computation with polynomials with integer coefficients and again stated that 
theories of algebraic numbers and algebraic quantities could be reduced to 
such rational computations. Thus, whether or not it was the last thing he dis-
covered in writing his 1881 treatise, Kronecker came to believe that he should 
have begun with rational algebra. That is where these essays begin. 
Elsewhere Kronecker said, "In mathematics, I recognize true scientific 
value only in concrete mathematical truths, or, to put it more pointedly, only 
in mathematical formulas" (see [21]). I would rather say "computations" than 
"formulas," but my view is essentially the same. Computation, in turn, is an 
outgrowth of counting, and in this sense mathematics is founded on numbers, 
* These lectures, given in the last year of Kronecker's life, 1891, are preserved in 
the form of a handwritten transcript in the archives of the mathematics library 
of the University of Strasbourg, and were recently published [45].

not as abstract "objects" of any kind, but as the system of symbols by which 
we record the results of counts. We learn to use and understand the symbols 
0, 1, 2, 3, ... at an early age, and most of us understand fairly soon that the 
important thing is not the actual names or symbols that are used, or even 
the decimal system on which they are based, but the mere fact that there are 
agreed-upon symbols and names and an agreed-upon system for counting. In 
this essay, the word "number" will mean a number 0, 1, 2, ... in this most 
basic sense. 
The more sophisticated computations that we learn later in life grow out 
of counting. First, the operations of addition and multiplication are grounded 
in counting. (Counting first to a then to b is the same as counting to a -\- b. 
Counting a times to b is the same as counting to ab.) Subtraction—the inverse 
of addition—of course makes sense only when the number being subtracted 
is not larger than the one from which it is to be subtracted. However, expe-
rience teaches us to widen our horizon in such a way that this limitation on 
subtraction can be put in the background and for the most part ignored. This 
can be done very conveniently in the way Kronecker does it in the essay Uber 
den Zahlbegriff {On the Concept of Number), mentioned above. 
He first introduces ''''Buchstabenrechnung,''^ calculation with letters, in the 
following way: "The same laws [that govern the addition and multiplication of 
numbers] needed to be regarded as valid for calculation with letters as soon as 
letters began to be used to represent numbers whose determination might or

should be postponed. With the introduction of the principle of computing with 
indeterminates as such, which originated with Gauss, the special theory of 
whole numbers broadened into the general arithmetical theory of polynomials 
with whole number coefficients."* 
In particular, we can compute with—add and multiply—polynomials in a 
single indeterminate t whose coefficients are numbers. When we use Gauss's 
notation f{t) = g{t) mod (t+1) to mean that f{t) can be transformed into g{t) 
using the identity t + 1 ^ 0 mod (t +1), we then have a system of computation 
in which t plays the role of —1. This system of computation is what we mean 
by the ring of integers. 
In modern notation, these observations can be abbreviated Z = N[t] mod 
(t+1), meaning that an element of Z—an integer—is represented by an expres-
sion of the form aof^ + ait'^~^ + • • • + a^, where N denotes the set of numbers 
{0,1, 2 , . . . } , where t is an indeterminate, and where n, ao, ai, . . . , a^ are num-
bers. Two such representations by definition represent the same element of Z if 
one can be transformed into the other using t-\-l = 0 mod (^+1) in conjunction 
with the usual laws that govern addition and multiplication of numbers. Since 
t^ = t2 + (t-f 1) =t'^-\-t-\-l 
=t{t-hl)-hl 
= 1 mod (t+1), we can always replace 
t^ with 1. Therefore, we can replace t^ with t, t^ with t^ and then with 1, and 
so forth, to represent any integer by an expression of the form at -\- 6, where a 
and b are numbers. Two such expressions represent the same integer, that is, 
at-\-b = ct-{-d mod (t + 1), if and only if at + 6-f a + c = ct + d-\-a-\-c mod (t + 1), 
which is to say b-{-c = d-\-a mod (t + 1). Since this congruence does not involve 
t, it is equivalent to the equation b -\- c — d -\- a. In short, the simple device of 
computation with polynomials in t mod t + 1 is all that is needed to describe 
the usual construction of the ring of integers as ordered pairs of numbers (a, b) 
subject to the equivalence relation "(a, b) = (c, d) means a-\- d = b^ c^^ when 
equivalence classes are added and multiplied in the obvious ways. As Kro-
necker observes, the interpretation of the equation 7 — 9 = 3 — 5 truly involves 
this new meaning of the equal sign. 
In essence, the device of using integers instead of numbers makes it possible 
to do computations without bothering about whether particular subtractions 
are possible unless a reason arises to examine that issue. Similarly, it makes 
possible writing all terms of an equation on one side of the equal sign, which 
greatly simplifies reasoning by eliminating the need to consider separately 
cases in which the terms would appear on different sides of the equation if 
numbers were used instead of integers. 
* Dieselben Gesetze mussten flir die sogenannte Buchstabenrechnung als maass-
gebend angenommen werden, sobald man anfing, die Buchstaben zur Bezeichnung 
von Zahlen zu verwenden, deren Bestimmung vorbehalten bleiben kann oder soil. 
Aber mit der principiellen Einfiihrung der "Unbestimmten" (indeterminatae), 
welche von Gauss herriihrt, hat sich die specielle Theorie der ganzen Zahlen zu 
der allgemeinen arithmetischen Theorie der ganzen ganzzahligen Functionen von 
Unbestimmten erweitert.

1 A Fundamental Theorem 
The fourth rational operation, division, is the most interesting one. The 
division of numbers naturally takes the form of division with remainder: 
Two 
numbers a and b with b ^ 0 determine numbers q and r by the conditions 
a = qb -\- r and r < b. This operation is of course very closely connected to 
the original meaning of Gauss's congruence concept a = r mod b. 
In the more general setting of Buchstabenrechnung—computing 
with poly-
nomials in several indeterminates whose coefficients are numbers—the notion 
of divisibility has a clear meaning, but the more useful concept of division with 
remainder does not. An exception is the case of division by a polynomial with 
integer coefficients that is monic in one of its indeterminates, meaning that 
b = x'^ -\- terms of degree less than n in x. In this case, for any polynomial a 
with integer coefficients, there are unique polynomials q and r with integer 
coefficients for which a — qb-\-r and for which the degree of r in x is less than 
the degree n of 6 in x. 
Another role played by division in elementary arithmetic is the cancella-
tion law of multiplication: 
If ab = ac and a ^ 0, then b = c. This law is 
obviously valid for numbers—even for integers. Its validity in other contexts, 
when equality is replaced by some kind of congruence, is often a crucial issue. 
When it is valid, the ring of congruences classes under addition and multi-
plication is an integral domain. For an integral domain one can construct 
a field of quotients^ the set of all formal quotients p/q in which ^ 7^ 0, when 
p/q = p' /q' is defined to mean pq' = p'q and when addition and multiplication 
are defined by (p/q) + {p'/q') 
= {pq' -^ p'q)/qq' 
and (p/q) • {p'/q') = 
pp'/qq'. 
However, for the most part fields of quotients themselves—for example, the 
field of rational numbers—will be avoided. The potential of one, the ability to 
compute with formal quotients of elements of an integral domain, is enough. 
Toward the end of his life, Kronecker adopted the term "general arith-
metic" {allgemeine 
Arithmetik) 
for the arithmetic of rings of the form Z[ci, 
C2, . . . , Cj/], which is to say rings of polynomials in some set of indeterminates 
ci, C2, . . . , Cjy with integer coefficients (or, in conformity with the approach 
above, rings N[t, ci, C2, . . . , Cjy] mod {t + 1), where N denotes the set of num-
bers). Of course there is little to be said about these rings themselves; rather, 
the substance of general arithmetic lies in the study of certain further con-
structions that use them. 
Kronecker wrote a number of papers about what he called module sys-
tems, and he formulated his proof of his Fundamentalsatz 
of general arith-
metic in terms of module systems. For me, however, his module systems pose 
difficulties. For one thing, a module system in its simplest form—namely, a 
ring of the form Z[ci, C2, . . . , c^,] mod [Mi, M2, . . . , M^], a polynomial ring 
in which computations are done modulo a finite number of given relations 
Mi = 0—is not normally a field because division is not normally possible. 
Therefore, one needs to enlarge the realm of objects with which one computes 
in some way in order to allow the computations to use the most convenient and 
natural representations of them—for example to allow the use of cj = 
y ~ 

Essay 1.1 General Arithmetic

in computations with ^ / ^ . For another thing, this description Z[ci, C2, . . . , 
Cjy] mod [Ml, M2, . . . , M^] of module systems opens the door to the prob-
lem of determining whether two such module systems are isomorphic, 
which is 
tantamount to the "ideal membership problem" for rings of the form Z[ci, C2, 
. . . , Cjy], a problem that poses serious difficulties* from a constructive point of 
view. 
For these reasons, I have avoided module systems^ and have instead used 
the concrete notion of a simple algebraic extension of the field of quotients of 
a ring Z[ci, C2, . . . , Cj^]; such simple algebraic extensions are described and 
given the name "root fields" in Essay 1.3. As will be shown in Essay 2.2— 
using an argument Kronecker himself gave [39, §2]—fields of this type provide 
a setting for all algebraic computations. 
* Much serious work has been done on the ideal membership problem and the 
related problem of constructing Grobner bases, but since I have not been able to 
understand this work in a way that is consistent with my notions of constructivity, 
I am glad that it is unnecessary for the topics I develop here. 
' Specific module systems in which the problems mentioned above do not arise are 
used in some of the constructions—for example in Essays 1.5 and 2.4.

The essays that follow contain applications of general arithmetic to a variety 
of topics, one of which is the theorem Kronecker stated and proved in his 1887 
paper Ein Fundamentalsatz 
der allgemeinen 
Arithmetik 
(On a Fundamental 
Theorem of General Arithmetic) [42]. This theorem states, roughly, that every 
polynomial 
has a splitting 
field. 
Proposition 1 of Book 1 of Euclid's Elements 
[25] is, in the Heath transla-
tion, "On a given finite straight line to construct an equilateral triangle." To 
modern ears, this seems a strange way to state a proposition. A modern writer 
would be more likely to say, "Given a finite straight line, there is an equilateral 
triangle of which it is one of the sides." But Euclid has many such proposi-
tions. His propositions fall into two categories, often described as "problems" 
and "theorems." That Proposition 1 is a "problem" is signaled not only by 
the form of its statement but also by the fact that its proof ends with "as 
was to be done" rather than "as was to be proved." Gauss on at least one 
occasion* concludes a proof with QEF ("quod erat faciendum"—that which 
was to be done) instead of QED ("quod erat demonstrandum"—that which 
was to be demonstrated), and Galois in his treatise [27] on the algebraic solu-
tion of equations presents eight "propositions," five of which are "theorems," 
two of which are "problems," and one of which is a "lemma," but today the 
designation "problem" has disappeared from formal mathematical exposition, 
and the designation "proposition" has become more or less synonymous with 
"theorem." 
The usual definition of "constructive mathematics" is that it requires exis-
tence theorems to be proved constructively—that is, constructive mathematics 
does not accept as a proof of existence an argument that assumes a disproof 
of existence and derives a contradiction. But the very notion of an "existence 
theorem" reflects a nonconstructive bias. Is it not ridiculous to say, "Every 
polynomial has a splitting field," and then to stipulate that "The proof will 
give an actual construction of a splitting field" ? Is it not more reasonable to 
follow the Euclidean model and say "Given a polynomial, construct a splitting 
field for it," thereby making clear that the proof is a construction? 
In these essays I do follow the Euclidean model, except that I have decided 
to use the word "theorem" for both types of Euclidean "propositions." Mathe-
maticians today regard "theorems" as the fundamental units of mathematics. 
Kronecker used the term Fundamentals 
atz even though his theorem was in 
truth a construction. I doubt that an effort to give another term like "prob-
lem" or "construction" the same status as "theorem" would succeed. And a 
See §73 of Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. The notation QEF at the end of §73 was 
omitted from the German translation by Maser.

"fundamental problem" or a "fundamental construction" would be much less 
imposing than a "fundamental theorem." Thus, these essays, although they 
will not contain "existence theorems," will contain many theorems that are 
constructions, including the theorem of this essay. 
Gauss's doctoral dissertation of 1799 was devoted to a proof of a theorem 
very close to what is now called the "fundamental theorem of algebra": A 
polynomial 
of degree n has n complex roots when they are counted with multi-
plicities. In the dissertation he sharply criticizes earlier attempts to prove the 
theorem, saying that they used computations with the roots and that such 
computations virtually assumed the truth of the theorem to be proved. How-
ever, as Bashmakova and Rudakov point out in an essay on the history of the 
theorem [35], Gauss returned to the theorem in 1815 and gave a new proof 
that took an approach very similar to the one he had criticized in 1799; he 
justified on other grounds certain limited computations with the roots of the 
given polynomial, and then used such computations to show that the roots 
could be described as complex numbers. (For this second proof, see Essay 5.1.) 
Kronecker, with his Fundamentalsatz, 
came to the realization that 
this 
is the theorem: what is important is not the complex numbers but, rather, 
the fact that computations with the roots can be justified. That is, given a 
polynomial 
with integer coefficients, 
one can describe a system of 
computation 
that extends computations 
with integers in such a way that the polynomial 
has 
a number of roots equal to its degree. 
In a pragmatic sense, Galois had realized the same thing more than fifty 
years earlier. Lemma III of his treatise on the algebraic solution of equations 
[27], which was written in 1830-1831 even though it was not published until 
1846, is in essence a construction of a splitting field for a given polynomial. 
Unfortunately, Galois does not prove Lemma III. He does give a construction 
of a splitting field, but the construction uses computations with the roots! 
Thus, from a foundational point of view, what Galois proved was that if there 
is any vaHd way to compute with the roots of a polynomial, then computations 
with the roots can always be done using what is now called a Galois resolvent, 
as in his Lemma III. Until computations with the roots were validated— 
until Kronecker's Fundamentalsatz 
was proved—Galois theory was without a 
general foundation, even though splitting fields could be constructed in specific 
cases. 
For example, in the case of the polynomial x^ — 2, the polynomial y^ -\-10S 
is a Galois resolvent, which is to say that computations in Q[y] mod 
(y^-^lOS) 
extend computations in the field of rational numbers Q in such a way that 
x^ — 2 factors into linear factors, as is shown by the formula

mod (/ + 108).

Putting aside for the moment the question of how such a formula might be 
constructed, one can easily check that it is correct; the product of the last 
two factors is ^{{36x 
+ y^)'^ - 324y'^) = 3^(36^x2 _^ ^2xy^ + y'^{-10S)

by the first factor gives x^ + ^y^ - ^y^ - f^/ 
- ^|/2(-108) + ^(-108) = 
x^ — 2 mod (2/^ + 108). Otherwise stated, the formula proves that adjunction 
to the field Q of a root ?/ of i/^ + 108 = 0 gives a field over which x"^ — 2 splits 
into linear factors. 
Kronecker states the more general version 
(^) ^- - ( - C) h ^
) ( - ' ^ ) °- (»' - -^) 
of this formula in his Fundamentalsatz paper [42, end of §2]. This version, too, 
is easy to check even if it is not easy to guess. It proves that adjunction to the 
field of rational functions in c of a root y oi y^ -i- Tic? gives a field over which 
x^ — c splits into linear factors. 
The general case is developed and proved in the next few essays in the 
form of the following theorem: 
Fundamental Theorem. 
Given a polynomial f in x with integer coeffi-
cients, construct a polynomial g in y with integer coefficients that is irre-
ducible, monic in y, and has the property that a formula of the form 
(3) 
fix) = aoY[(^x- 
^
) 
mod g{y) 
holds, in which the (j)i{y) are polynomials whose coefficients are integers, the 
ipi are nonzero integers, and ao is the leading coefficient of f. 
More generally. 
Given a polynomial f in x, ci, C2, ..., Cj^ with integer coefficients, construct 
a polynomial g in y, c\, C2, ..., Ci, with integer coefficients that is irreducible, 
monic in y, and gives rise to a formula (3), in which the (j)i{y) are now polyno-
mials in y, ci, C2, • - -, Cy with integer coefficients, the ipi are nonzero polyno-
mials inci, C2, '.', Cjy with integer coefficients, and QQ is the leading coefficient 
of f as a polynomial in x. 
To say that g{y) is monic in y means that g has the form y^-\ 
where the 
omitted terms all have degree less than n in y. As will be seen in Essay 1.3, 
this assumption simplifies computations mod g{y). The requirement that g be 
irreducible guarantees that Z[^, ci, C2, ..., c^^] mod g{y, ci, C2, . •., c^^) (where 
ly may be zero) will be an integral domain. In modern parlance, the field of 
quotients of this integral domain is a splitting field of / as a polynomial with 
coefficients in the field of rational functions in ci, C2, ..., c^^. It is obtained by 
adjoining a root y of g to this field of rational functions. 
A familiar example of a splitting of this sort, put in an unfamiliar way, is

Here use is made of the fact that y is a, square root of b'^—Aac mod (|/^—6^+4ac) 
to express the roots of the quadratic polynomial ax^ + 6x + c in the form

Essay 1.3 Root Fields (Simple Algebraic Extensions) 
In brief, one adjoins a root y of g{y) by computing with expressions of the form 
p{y)/q, 
where p{y) is a polynomial in y and q is nonzero; addition and mul-
tiplication are performed in the obvious ways, while division is accomplished 
by "rationalizing the denominator." 
Here the given polynomial g{y) is assumed to be an irreducible polynomial 
with integer coefficients—or, more generally, with coefficients in the ring Z[ci, 
C2, • . • , Cjy ] of polynomials with integer coefficients in some given set ci, C2, 
. . . , Cjy of indeterminates—that is monic in y. The advantage of assuming that 
g{y) is monic in y is that it means that division with remainder can be used 
to find, for any polynomial in y^ another polynomial congruent to it mod g{y) 
whose degree is less than n — degg. Since a polynomial of degree less than 
n = degg can be divisible by g{y) only if it is zero, it follows that 
every 
polynomial 
in y with coefficients 
in Z[ci, C2, .. •, c^] is congruent mod g{y) to 
one and only one such polynomial 
whose degree in y is less than n. Thus, the 
ring Z[7/, ci, C2, . . . , c^] mod g{y) can be described as the elements of Z[^, ci, 
C2, . . . , Cjy] whose degrees are less than n = deg^f, added in the usual way 
and multiplied by ordinary multiplication of polynomials followed by division 
with remainder by g{y) to find a polynomial congruent to the product mod 
g{y) whose degree in y is less than n. 
The advantage of the assumption that g{y) 
is irreducible is that it 
implies—as will be proved in the next essay—that the ring Z[^,Ci, C2, . . . , 
Cjy] mod g{y) defined in this way is an integral domain. Therefore, as described 
in Essay 1.1, there is an associated field of quotients. 
It is this field of quo-
tients of the integral domain Z[?/, ci, C2, . . . , Cj^] mod g{y) that I will call the 
root field of g{y). Another way to describe it is as the simple algebraic 
extension of the field of rational functions* in ci, C2, . . . , Cjy obtained by 
adjoining a root of g{y). 
An element of the root field is represented in the first instance by a quotient 
of elements of Z[?/, ci, C2, . . . , c^y] in which the denominator is not zero mod 
g{y). Since computations are all to be done mod g{y)j one can assume without 
loss of generality that both numerator and denominator have degree less than 
the degree n of g{y). Moreover, one can assume without loss of generality that 
the denominator 
does not contain y by virtue of the following lemma: 
L e m m a (Basic elimination). 
Given polynomials 
g{y) and q{y) in y with 
coefficients 
in Z[ci, C2, • .., Cy] such that g{y) is irreducible and monic in y 
and q{y) is nonzero mod g{y), construct 
polynomials 
r{y) and s{y) such that 
r{y)q{y) 
+ s{y)g{y) 
is nonzero and does not contain 
y. 
* The "field of rational functions" in ci, C2, ..., c^^ is simply the field of quotients of 
the integral domain Z[ci, C2, ..., Cu]- Note that the word 'function' is not being 
used in its modern sense here, because p/q has no 'value' at roots of q. When 
i/ = 0, the ring is just the ring of integers Z and the field is just the field of 
rational numbers Q. 

Essay 1.3 Root Fields (Simple Algebraic Extensions)

Proof. Let n be the degree of g{y) and k the degree of q{y). Consider 
the polynomials in y with coefficients in Z[ci, C2, . . . , c^] of the form 
r{y)q{y) + s{y)g{y)^ 
where degr < n and degs < k. These polynomials have 
degree less than n-\-k, so they are described by their n + k coefficients, which 
depend linearly on the n coefficients of r and the k coefficients of s. Thus, 
the dependence is described by an {n -\- k) x (n + k) matrix of elements of 
Z[ci, C2, . . . , Cjy]. If the determinant of this matrix were zero, there would 
be nonzero polynomials r{y) and s{y) with coefficients in Z[ci, C2, . . . , c^] 
for which r{y)q{y) 
+ s{y)g{y) 
= 0, which is impossible because it would im-
ply that r{y)q{y) 
was a product divisible by g{y) in which neither factor was 
divisible by g{y) {q{y) ^ 0 mod g{y) by assumption, and r{y) ^ 0 mod g{y) 
because r{y) ^ 0 and degr < deg^), contrary to the fact that for 
polynomi-
als with coefficients 
inZ[y^ci,

system ofn-\-k

'r{y)q{y) + s{y)g{y) 
does not contain i/' has a nontrivial solution—i.e., a so-
lution other than the solution r{y) = s{y) = 0. (In fact, it has the explicit 
nontrivial solution in which the coefficients of r and s are Di, —D2^ D^, —i^4,

where the denominator t does not contain y. In short, every element of the 
root field oi g{y) can be represented by a quotient in which the denominator is 
independent of y. Since the numerator can be reduced mod g{y) and common 
factors in numerator and denominator can be canceled, it follows that an 
element of the root field of g{y) has a representation

reversing the signs of numerator and denominator. 
This method of representing elements of the root field of g{y), together 
with the fact that it is the field of quotients of Z[?/, ci, C2, . . . , c^,] mod g{y)^ 
describes completely how computations in that field are to be done.

Essay 1.4 Factorization of Polynomials with Integer 
Coefficients 
When you can settle a question 
by explicit construction, 
be not 
satisfied 
with purely existential 
arguments.—Hermann 
Weyl [55] 
The naive construction of a splitting field for a given polynomial is simple. 
Given a polynomial / with coefficients in a field K^ let it be factored into its 
irreducible factors over K. If these factors are all linear, K is a splitting field 
for / . Otherwise, let / i be one of the irreducible factors whose degree is greater 
than 1, and let Ki be the field K[y] mod fi{y). 
(The irreducibility of/i over K 
implies that K[y] mod fi{y) 
is a field, because, as in the last essay, if p{x) ^ 0 
has degree less than the degree of /i(x), then r{x)p{x) 
-\-s{x)fi{x) 
— 0 has no 
nontrivial solution in which degr < d e g / i and degs < degp, which implies 
that the problem "r(x)p(x) + s{x)fi{x) 
does not contain x'' has a nonzero 
solution.) Then Ki contains K^ so every root of / in ii^ is also in Ki, 
which 
is to say that / has a least as many linear factors over K as it does over 
Ki. In fact, it must have at least one more linear factor over K i , because 
Ki contains at least one root of / i , and K contains none. Thus, there are 
more linear factors of / as a polynomial with coefficients in Ki than there 
were linear factors of / as a polynomial with coefficients in iC. If Ki is not a 
splitting field for / , the process can be repeated to find another field K2 over 
which / has more linear factors than it does over Ki. Since / has at most 
deg / linear factors over any field, repetition of this process terminates after 
at most deg / steps with a field in which / splits into linear factors. 
The problem with this "construction" occurs at the first step. How can 
one accomplish the factorization of a polynomial with coefficients in a given 
field into irreducible factors? The answer must of course depend on the field 
of coefficients. If it is a finite field, the list of possible factors is finite, so 
they can all be tried, but for an infinite field, even for the field of rational 
numbers, the problem is more subtle. Kronecker presents an algorithm for 
factoring polynomials with integer coefficients early in his Grundziige 
einer 
arithmetischen 
Theorie 
der algebraischen 
Grossen. 
(See also [40].) It is, in 
essence, the one used in the proof of the following theorem. 
Theorem 1. 
Given a nonzero polynomial 
(in any number of 
indeterminates) 
with integer coefficients, 
list its 
divisors. 
Proof. Consider first the case in which the given polynomial contains no in-
determinates, which is to say that it is a nonzero integer, call it a. A divisor 
of a is a nonzero integer, and its absolute value is at most \a\. Therefore, a 
list of divisors of a can be found by listing the 2\a\ nonzero integers whose 
absolute values are at most |a|, and striking those that do not divide a. 
Consider next the case in which the given polynomial contains just one 
indeterminate, say it is f{x) 
= aox'^ + aix'^"^ 
+ • • • -h a^, where x is the 
indeterminate and ao, ai, . . . , a^, n are integers with ao ^ 0 and n > 0. 

14 
1 A Fundamental Theorem 
Choose* n -\- 1 distinct integers ro, ri, . . . , r^ for which /(r^) / 0, and for 
each z = 0, 1, . . . , n let (/)^(x) be the''" polynomial of degree n with 
rational 
coefficients determined by the conditions (t>i{rj) = 0 for j ^ i and (t)i{ri) = 1. If 
^(x) is a factor of / ( x ) , then its degree is at most n and its value agrees with the 
value of g{ri)<pi{x)^g{r2)(l)2{x)-\-- 
• •+^(^n)0n(^) at each r^. Two polynomials 
in X with rational coefficients whose degrees are less than n + 1 and whose 
values agree for n + 1 distinct rational values of x are identical. Therefore, the 
list of polynomials of the form &i(/)i(x)+6202(^) + * * '-^bn4^n{x) in which bi is an 
integer that divides /(r^) for each i is a finite list of polynomials with rational 
coefficients that includes all divisors of f{x)—finite 
because the number of 
possible values of bi is finite for each i. To construct a list of divisors of f{x)^ 
it will suffice to strike from this list the polynomials that are not divisors 
of f{x). 
To do this, first strike all polynomials in the list whose coefficients 
are not integers. Then test-'- each of the remaining polynomials to determine 
whether it divides / ( x ) , and strike it if it does not. 
This method of deducing the case of one indeterminate from the case of 
none can also be used to deduce the case of /c + 1 indeterminates from the 
case of k. Again f{x) 
= QQX'^ -\- aix'^~^ + • • • + a^i, but now ao, ai, ..., 
an are 
* Theorem: A nonzero polynomial f{x) of degree n with coefficients in an integral 
domain has at most n distinct roots in that integral domain. Proof: Suppose f{x) 
is a nonzero polynomial of degree n with coefficients in an integral domain that 
has m > 0 distinct roots ai, a2, .•-, o^m in that domain. Then n > 0 and 
g(y) = f{y + ai) defines a polynomial of degree n that has m distinct roots 0, 
Q;2 — Q^i, Q^3 — Q^i, • • • , o^m — «i- Because ^(0) = 0, g{y) = yh(y), where h{y) has 
degree n — 1. The m — 1 roots a2 — Q^i, Q^a — Q^i, • • • , o^m — o^i of g{y) other than 
zero are roots of h{y)^ because (ai — ai)h{ai — ai) — g{ai — ai) = 0 and the first 
factor on the left is not zero. If a polynomial of degree n had n + 1 distinct roots, 
this construction would prove that n > 0 and would yield a polynomial of degree 
n — 1 with n distinct roots, which is impossible because it would imply an infinite 
sequence of polynomials of decreasing degrees. Corollary 1: Given a polynomial 
of degree n with integer coefficients, any set of 2n -\- 1 distinct integers contains 
at least n + 1 that are not roots of it. Corollary 2: Let f{x) be a polynomial with 
coefficients in an integral domain that has degree n and n distinct roots ai, 
a^, 
. . ., OLn in the integral domain. Then f{x) = a{x — ai){x — a2) • • • (x — an), where 
a is the leading coefficient of f{x). Deduction: The difference between /(x) and 
a(x — ai)(x — a2) •' - (x — an) is a polynomial of degree less than n that has n 
distinct roots, so it must be zero. 
^ As was shown in the previous note, (/)i(x) must be a rational number times 
n ^ i ( ^ — rj). The rational multiplier is determined by the condition 0(ri) = 1 
to be the reciprocal of the value of Y[ -^^(^ ~ ^j) when x = ri.

a polynomial 
that has degree less than deg/ and that is divisible by g{x) if and only if the 
original f(x) was. If the new f{x) is zero, it is divisible by g{x). Otherwise, apply 
the same test to the new f{x).

polynomials in k indeterminates, witfi ao 7^ 0 and n > 0. Again choose n-\- 1 
integers r^ for which / ( n ) 7^ 0 and again construct the polynomials (l)i{x) with 
rational coefficients that are one at r^ and zero at all other r j . Construct the 
finite list of expressions of the form 61 ^i (x) + &202(^) H 
H bn(l)n{x) in which 
bi is a divisor of f{ri). 
(Here /(r^) is a polynomial in k indeterminates with 
integer coefficients. By the inductive hypothesis, its divisors can be listed.) 
The required list of divisors is obtained by striking from this finite list the 
entries that are not polynomials with integer coefficients and those that do 
not divide 
f{x). 
A polynomial with integer coefficients is a unit if it is 1 or —1. The trivial 
divisors of a nonzero polynomial are the units and the polynomial itself times 
a unit. A nonzero polynomial is reducible if its list of divisors given by the 
theorem contains more than the four trivial divisors, or, what is the same, if 
it can be written as a product of two polynomials, neither of which is a unit. 
A nonzero polynomial is irreducible if it is not a unit and not reducible. 
Corollary. 
Given a nonzero polynomial 
with integer coefficients 
that is not 
a unit, write it as a product of irreducible 
polynomials. 
Deduction. 
Take the given polynomial as the initial input to the following 
algorithm: 
Input: A product of nonzero polynomials (with integer coefficients) none of 
them units. 
Algorithm: 
If each input factor is irreducible—which 
is to say that for each 
of them the list of divisors 
given by the theorem 
contains 
only the 
trivial 
divisors—the 
algorithm terminates. 
Otherwise, 
at least one factor is reducible. 
Replace one reducible factor in the input product with a representation 
of that 
factor as a product of two factors, 
neither of which is a unit. 
If the algorithm terminates, it terminates with a representation of the 
original polynomial as a product of irreducible polynomials, as required. But 
it must terminate because the list of all divisors of the original polynomial is 
finite. 
A nonzero polynomial with integer coefficients is prime if it is not a unit 
and if it divides a product of polynomials with integer coefficients only when 
it divides one of the factors. 
T h e o r e m 2. 
Irreducible polynomials 
with integer coefficients 
are prime. 
When there are no indeterminates in the polynomials, this is the proposi-
tion that irreducible integers are prime. Euclid proved it using the following 
lemma: 

16 
1 A Fundamental Theorem 
L e m m a (The Euclidean* algorithm). 
Given positive integers f and g, 
find integers (j) and t/j for which (j)f -\- ipg is positive and divides both f and g. 
Proof 
Let a sequence of pairs of numbers {fni9n) 
be defined by taking (/i, ^i) 
to be (/, g) and taking (/n+i, ^n+i) to be either {fn^Qn - fn) or (/^ - gn, gn), 
depending on whether fn ^ 9n or fn > gn > ^' When ^^ = 0, the sequence 
terminates. A step that changes fn changes it to a positive value, so each fn 
is positive. Similarly, each g^ is nonnegative. A step reduces fn-^Qn^ either by 
fn or by gn- By the principle of infinite descent, therefore, the sequence must 
terminate. Let (c?, 0) be the terminal pair. Then d is positive. Since /n+i and 
gn-\-i are sums of multiples of fn and g^, both entries of the terminal pair (d, 0) 
are sums of multiples of the initial pair (/, ^). Thus, there are integers 0 and 
ip such that d = (j)f -\- ipg. A common divisor of /n+i and gn+i is a common 
divisor of fn and gn^ so, since d divides both entries of (d, 0), it divides both 
/ and ^, which proves the lemma. ^ 
The proof of Theorem 2 for polynomials with indeterminates will use a 
lemma analogous to the one above: 
L e m m a (The Euclidean* algorithm for polynomials). 
Given 
nonzero 
polynomials 
f and g in one indeterminate 
with coefficients in a field, 
construct 
polynomials 
(f) and i/j with coefficients 
in the same field for which (j)f + ij^g 
divides both f and g. 
Proof. Let a sequence of pairs of polynomials (fn.gn) 
be defined by taking 
ifi^gi) 
to be (/, g) and taking (Z^+i, ^n+i) to be the pair derived from 
{fn,9n) 
in the following way: If 0 < d e g / ^ < deg^^, set i = deg^f^ — deg/^ and 
{fn+i,gn+i) 
= (/n, 9n " i^x^fn/fJ^), wlicrc /x is the leading coefficient of fn and 
u is the leading coefficient of gn- If deg/n > deg^^ > 0, set (/^+i,^n+i) = 
{fn — l^x^9n/^i9n)^ 
whcrc i = degfn 
— deg^n and /i and v are the leading 
coefficients of fn and gn- The sequence terminates if fn or g^ is zero (that 
is, has degree —oo), which must occur eventually, because deg/n + deg^n 
decreases with each step. Let d be the nonzero member of the terminal pair. 
Clearly c?, like all members of all pairs of the sequence, has the form (f)f -\-ijjg, 
where 0 and ijj are polynomials with coefficients in the field. 
The predecessor of (/^_^i,^^+i) in the sequence just constructed is either 
(/n+i,5'n+i + 
ra'/n+i//^) 
or (/n+1 + /ix'^fn+i/^^^n+i)- In both cascs, every 
common divisor of fn-\-i and gn^i is a common divisor of fn and gn- Since d 
is a common divisor of the polynomials in the terminal pair, it is a common 
divisor of the polynomials in the initial pair (/, ^), and the proof of the lemma 
is complete. 
* In essence, this is the algorithm Euclid used [25, Book 7, Propositions 1 and 2], 
although the formulation is entirely different. 
^ For another version of this proof, see Essay 3.2. 
"'• It is "Euclidean" by virtue of the analogy with the previous case, not because 
Euclid considered anything of the kind.

Proof of Theorem 2. Let /, g^ and h be in the ring of polynomials Z[xi, X2, 
..., Xm] in m indeterminates with integer coefficients and let them satisfy (1) 
/ is irreducible, (2) / divides gh, and (3) / does not divide g. It is to be shown 
that / must then divide h. 
When 777, = 0 the proof is the one that Euclid, in essence, gave [25, Book 7, 
Prop. 24]. In this case, /, g, and h are integers. Since changing the sign of / or 
g or h does not change (1), (2), (3), or the desired conclusion, /, ^, and h can 
be assumed to be nonnegative. Then / > 0 and ^^ > 0, because / is not zero 
by (1) and g is not zero by (3). The Euclidean algorithm provides a positive 
d = <t>f -\-^g that divides both / and g. Since / is irreducible and d is positive, 
d = 1 or /. By (3), d ^^ f. Therefore (t)f ^ i^g ^ 1. Thus 0//^ + ipgh = h is 
divisible by /, as was to be shown, because / divides both terms on the left. 
Next consider the case of Theorem 2 in which / contains fewer than m 
indeterminates: 
A Special Case. 
An irreducible element of Z[xi^ X2^ • • •, Xm-i] is prime 
as an element of Z[xi, X2, • - -, Xm]-
Let / be an irreducible polynomial in xi, ^2, ..., Xm-i with integer co-
efficients, and let g{x) and h{x) be polynomials in x, Xi, a;2, •. •, Xm-i with 
integer coefficients for which (2) and (3) hold. Then all coefficients oi g{x)h{x) 
are divisible by /, but at least one of the coefficients oi g{x) is not divisible by 
/. Let g{x) = a^x^ -\- aix^~^ + • • • + a^, where the a^ are polynomials in xi, 
X2, ..., Xm-i: and let / be the least index for which aj is not divisible by /. 
If h{x) were not divisible by /, then, in the same way, when h{x) was written 
in the form h{x) = box^ -\- bix^~^ -}-••• -\- bt there would be a least index J 
for which bj was not divisible by /. Then the coefficient of x^^'^ in g{x)h{x) 
would be a lb J plus terms divisible by / (this coefficient is ajbj plus terms 
that are products in which one factor is divisible by / ) . But ajbj would not 
be divisible by / by the inductive hypothesis, so g{x)h{x) would not then be 
divisible by /, contrary to hypothesis. Therefore h{x) must be divisible by /, 
as was to be shown. 
The general case, in which / may contain x, can now be deduced from 
the case of TTI — 1 indeterminates as follows: The Euclidean algorithm gives 
equations d{x) = (t){x)f{x) -\- ip{x)g{x)^ f{x) — qi{x)d{x)^ g{x) = q2{x)d{x) 
where d^ 0, -0, gi, q2 are polynomials in x with coefficients in the field of 
rational functions in xi, X2, ..., Xm-i- Let ^ be a common denominator of all 
five of these polynomials. (For example, 6 could be taken to be the product 
of all denominators of all coefficients of the five.) Then D{x) — 6 • d{x)^ 
^{x) = 6 • 0(x), ^{x) = 6 • '0(x), Qi{x) = 6 ' qi{x), and Q2{x) = S • q2{x) all 
are in Z[x, Xi, X2, .. •, Xm-i] and they satisfy D{x) — ^{x)f{x) 
+ ^{x)g{x)^ 
d'^ • f{x) = Qi{x)D{x) 
and 6'^ • g{x) = Q2{x)D{x). By the special case already 
proved, each irreducible factor e of S'^ divides either Qi{x) or D{x). Therefore, 
6'^ ' f{x) = Qi{x)D{x) 
can be divided by each of the irreducible factors of 6'^ 
in succession to find f{x) 
= {Qi{x)/ei) 
• {D{x)/e2) where (5^ = 6162. By 
(1), D{x)/e2 must be ±1 or ±f{x). 
By (3), D{x)/e2 7^ ±f{x). 
Therefore, 

18 
1 A Fundamental Theorem 
D{x) = ±62, SO dze2h{x) = ^(x) • f{x) ' h{x) + ^{x) • g{x) • h{x), which shows 
that f{x) 
divides e2/i(x), say €2h{x) = Q3{x) • f{x). 
By the special case, each 
irreducible factor of 62 divides Qs{X)^ 
so f{x) 
divides /i(x), as was to be 
shown. 
Thus Theorem 2 follows by induction. 
Corollary 1 (Unique factorization of polynomials with integer coef-
ficients). 
If (j)i(j)2' •' (j)^ = '0i'02 • • • '01/; where the factors 
on both sides are 
irreducible polynomials 
with integer coefficients, 
then fi = v, and the 
factors 
can be so ordered that (j)i = —-0^ for an even number of values ofi, and (j)i = ipi 
for all others. 
Deduction. 
Let such an equation 0i02 * * • ^^^ — i^ii^2 ''' i^i^ be given in which 
/i > 1. Since Theorem 2 implies that ^i divides t/jj for some j , the tp^s can 
be rearranged to make 01 divide '0i, say 0i = qicf)!. Then 0203 ••* 0^^ = 
^1'020^3 • • • 01/ is a product of factors, at least z/ — 1 of which are irreducible. If 
fi were less than z^, ji iterations of this step would express 1 as a product of z/ 
factors, at least u — ji oi which were irreducible, contrary to the fact that the 
only factors of 1, the units 1 and —1, are not irreducible. Therefore, /J. > v. 
For the same reason, z/ > /x, so /i and u must be equal in any such equation. 
In the first equation 0203 • • • 0;u = ^10203 •' 'i^i^ found by the process above, 
qi must therefore have no irreducible factors and therefore must be a unit. 
Thus, fi steps rearrange the T/^'S in such a way that 0^ = qi(f)i for each z, where 
qi is a unit and 1 = qiq2''' 
q^- The last equation shows that the number of 
g's that are —1 is even, and the corollary follows.

The naive method of constructing a splitting field that was sketched at the be-
ginning of the preceding essay suggests that the factorization into irreducibles 
of a polynomial with coefficients in a root field (see Essay 1.3) might be a 
key tool in the proof of the fundamental theorem. In fact, as later essays

irreducible polynomials with

Notation: The ring of polynomials in ci, C2, . . . , c^ with integer coefficients 
will be denoted by R = Z[ci, C2, . . . , Cy\. Its field of quotients, the field of 
rational functions in ci, C2, . . . , c^^, will be denoted by K. When z/ = 0, i^ is 
the ring of integers and K is the field of rational numbers. 
This essay is devoted to a description 
of the algorithm for finding the 
factorization of f{x) mod g{y) in the form of a congruence (1). The 
validity 
of the algorithm will be proved in the next essay. 
The factorization algorithm will make use of computations in the ring 
R[x.,y] mod {f{x),g{y)) 
of polynomials in x, y, ci, C2, . . . , c^ with integer 
coefficients, where two such polynomials represent the same ring element— 
by definition—if their difference is a multiple of f{x) 
plus a multiple of g{y) 
* As far as (1) is concerned, 0i can be replaced by any polynomial that is congruent 
to it mod g{y), and this condition on the degrees of the 0's need not be satisfied. 
Restricting the degree in this way serves to determine the factors (j)i(x^y) once 
f{x) and g{y) are given, as is shown by the final proposition of Essay 1.4.

(the multipliers being, of course, in R[x, y]). Since f(x) is monic of degree TTI, 
^m — f(^x) is di polynomial of degree less than m in x that represents the same 
ring element as x"^, so any ring element that is represented by a polynomial 
of degree m -\- j in x for j > 0 can also be represented by a polynomial 
whose degree in x is less than m -\- j (replace the leading term (j){y)x'^^^ in 
X with (j){y)x^{x'^ — f{x)) while leaving the other terms unchanged). Thus, 
every ring element can be represented by a polynomial whose degree in x is 
less than m. In fact, every element of R[x,y] is congruent mod f{x) to one 
and only one polynomial of degree less than m in x, because an element of 
R[x,y] whose degree in x is less than m can be a multiple of f{x) only if 
it is zero. In the same way, any element of R[x,y] is congruent mod g{y) 
to just one element whose degree in y is less than n. Moreover, since the 
reduction method can be applied to each coefficient (f)i{y) of a polynomial 
(l)i{y)x'^~^ + 02(l/)^^"^ + • • • + (l>m{y) that has already been reduced mod 
/(x), every element of R[x^ y] mod {f{x),g{y)) 
is represented by one and only 
one element of i^[x, y] whose degree in x is less than m and whose degree in 
y is less than n. 
Each element of this ring R[x,y] mod {f{x),g{y)) 
is a root of a monic 
polynomial with coefficients in R. Specifically, if (t){x^y) is an element of 
R[x^y]^ a monic polynomial J^{z) of degree mn with coefficients in R for 
which T{(j){x^y)) = 0 mod {f{x)^g{y)) 
can be constructed in the following 
way: For each of the mn monomials x'^y^ in which 0 < i < m and 0 < j < n, 
the polynomial (j){x^y)x'^y^ is congruent mod f{x) and g{y)^ as was just seen, 
to a sum of multiples of x^y^ ^ where 0 < a < m and 0 < /^ < n, in which the 
multipliers are in R, Thus, the congruence 
m—l n—1 
determines an mn x mn matrix M of elements Mij^^fs of R once an order-
ing of the m.n monomials x'^y^ is decided upon. Otherwise stated, M is the 
matrix that represents multiplication by (/)(x, y) relative to the basis x^y^ of 
R[x,y] mod {f{x)^g{y)) over R. The characteristic polynomial of this matrix, 
which is to say the polynomial ^(2:) = det(2;/—M), is monic of degree mn in z; 
by the Cay ley-Hamilton theorem, it satisfies J^{(j){x, y)) = 0 mod 
{f{x),g{y)). 
(A proof will be given in the next essay.) 
Let this construction be applied not to a single polynomial (j){x^y) but 
to tx -\- uy^ regarded as a polynomial in new indeterminates t and u whose 
coefficients are in R[x^y]. The result is a polynomial T{z,t^u) 
in 2:, t, and u 
with coefficients in R. Specifically, T is the characteristic polynomial det(2:/ — 
M) of the mn x mn matrix M determined by C • {tx -h uy) = MC mod 
{f{x),g{y)), 
where C is the column matrix of length mn whose entries are the 
monomials x'^y^ in which 0 < i < m and 0 < j < n arranged in some order 
and tx-\-yu is a 1x1 matrix. The entries of M are homogeneous polynomials 
of degree 1 in t and u with coefficients in R, so the entries oi zl — M are 

22 
1 A Fundamental Theorem 
homogeneous of degree 1 in z, t, and u. Thus, J-{z^ t, u) is homogeneous of 
degree mn in these indeterminates and has coefficients in R; moreover, it is 
monic in z. 
As was seen in the last essay, the irreducible factors of J^{z,t^u) as a 
polynomial with integer coefficients (in 3 + z/ indeterminates) can be found, 
say T{z^t^u) 
= YlJ^i{z^t^u)^ where the Ti[z^t^u) 
are irreducible. Because 
T is homogeneous, its irreducible factors Ti are homogeneous. Because J^ is 
monic in 2:, the leading coefficient of each of its irreducible factors Ti as a 
polynomial in z is ±1, so one can stipulate that each Ti is monic in z, and 
this condition determines the J^i completely. The required factorization 
(1) 
f{x) = (t)i{x,y)(l)2{x,y) •' • (j)k{x,y) mod g[y) 
contains one factor (j)i{x,y) for each Ti{z^t^u). It is constructed as follows: 
As will be shown, the degree of J^i (it is homogeneous in z, t, and u) is a 
multiple of n, say it is /x^n. (By symmetry, this degree is also a multiple of m, 
a fact that is not of interest here.) Substitute tx + uy for z and 1 for t in Ti 
and write the result in the form 
(2) T^{x + uy, 1,u) = B^^ou^^^ + ^^,2^^^""' + ^^,2^^^""' + • • • + ^^,M^n. 
Each coefficient Bi^j is a polynomial in x, y, Ci, C2, ..., c^^-i, and Cy with 
integer coefficients. The first fii of these coefficients are all zero mod g{y)^ 
which is to say that reduction mod g{y) gives 
J^i{x -h uy, 1, u) = i^iU^^^""-^^ + • • • mod g[y), 
where the omitted terms are of lower degree in u and ifji = Bi^^. mod g{y). 
The factor (l)i{x, y) of f{x) mod g{y) corresponding to this factor Ti of T is 
(3) 
0z(x, y) = -77^f|- mod ^(2/), 
where g'{ij) is the derivative oi g{y). (Implicit in this statement, since (/)^(x, y) 
is monic in x, is the statement that ipi = g'{y)^^x^^ + • • • mod g{y) where the 
omitted terms have lower degree in x.) 
Example 1. f{x) = x'^ — 2 and g{y) = ^^ — 3. The first step is to find J^{z, t, u) 
for this / and g. When the monomials x"^^ for 0 < a < 2 and 0 < /^ < 2 
are put in the order 1, x, y, xy, the matrix that represents multiplication by 
tx + uy becomes 
' 0 t u 0

z^ - (4^2 -h6?i2)^2 _^4^4 _ 12^21^2 _|_9^4^ rpj^-g polynomial T{z, t, u) is irreducible 
because J-{z, 1,1) = z^ — lOz^ + 1 obviously has no root mod 5, so it can only 
have a factorization of the form {z"^ -i-az-\-b) (z^ -h cz-^ d) = z^ — lOz^ + 1, and 
this would imply a — —c, d -^ ac-\- b = —10, and 6 = d = ±1, so a^ = —ac = 
b-\-d-\-10 =^ ±2 + 10, which is impossible. Therefore, x^ — 2 is irreducible mod 
y^ — 3 (the factorization algorithm produces only the one factor corresponding 
to ^ itself). To determine this factor—which must, of course, be a:^ — 2 itself— 
one computes the coefficient ip of u^ in T{x + uy, 1, li) = {x -\- uy)^ — (4 -h

(As expected, the coefficient of v?^ which is y'^ — 18, is zero mod g{y).) In the 
same way, the factor of /(x) mod g{y) corresponding to ^2 is x + \y. Indeed, 
(x - \y) (x + \y) = x2 - ^y'^ = x^ - 2 mod [y'^ - 18), so /(x) = x^ - 2 splits 
mod g{y) = y'^ — IS into linear factors. (If y = \/T8, then | = \/2.)

too onerous. (One method is to use the formula z"^ — A\z^ -h A2Z^ — A3Z + A4 
for the characteristic polynomial, where Ai is the sum of the i x i principal 
minors of the matrix.) The result is 
T{z, t, u) = z^ + 2citz^ + (2c2t^ + cji'^ - 2du^)z^ + Cit{2c2t'^ -

a homogeneous polynomial in 2:, t, and u with coefficients in Z[ci,C2] when 
c\ — 4c2 is substituted for d. The difficult step is the factorization of T{z^ t, u). 
When t = 0 it is ^^ - 2dv?'z'^ + d^u^ = {z'^ - dv?Y, and when 1/ = 0 it is 
z"^ + 2citz^ + (2c2 + cl)t^z'^ + 2ciC2t'^z + clt^ = (z^ + ci^t + C2t^Y. Therefore, 
the factorization of ^ , if there is one, must be of the form (2:^ + citz + C2t^ + 
ptu — dv?){z'^ -\- citz -\- C2t^ + gti^ — (ii^^), where p and g' are in Z[ci, C2]. The 
coefficient of t^ix is 0 on the one hand and C2(p + q) on the other, so p — —q. 
Then the coefficient of t^v? is 2c2<i — c\d on the one hand and —2dc2 — p^ on 
the other, so p^ = —A:C2d-\-c\d = (i^, which gives the factorization [z'^ ^citz-{-
C2t^ + dtu — du^){z'^ + citz 4- C2t^ — c^tix — du^) of ^ ( z , t, u), where d is the 
element c^ — 4c2 of Z[ci, C2]. Let ^1(2;, t, i/) be the ffist of these factors. Then 
Ti{x -\- uy^ 1, u) = {x -\- uyY -f ci(x + uy) + C2 + du — du^, and the resulting 
factor of f{x) mod g{y) is 
2x^ + ciy -{- d _ 2xy^ + ci^^ -V dy _ 
C\ - mod^(?/). 
(Note that the coefficient of u^ is y^ 
d = 0 mod 5'(2/), as expected.) In the 
same way, ^2 leads to the factor x + y — | . Note that this process merely fac-
tors f{x) mod g{y). It does not construct the polynomial g{y) modulo which 
f{x) 
is a product of linear factors.

and the blocks off the diagonal are zero, and where Mx is the 9 x 9 matrix 
of 3 X 3 blocks that has the form of the matrix G; that is, the first block in 
the first row is zero, the second block in the first row is the identity matrix 
/s, and so forth, the first block in the last row being 2/3. Hand computation 
of this 9 x 9 determinant is straightforward but tedious. An easier method of 
hand computation uses the formula T{z^ l^u) = det {{zl^ — uG)^ — 2/3) that 
is proved in the next essay. Since G^ = 2/3 (this is the main property of G), 
it follows that J-{z^ l^u) is the product of the determinant of {zl — uG) — G 
and the determinant of 
[zI - uGf + {zl - uG)G + G^

J^i{z^t,u). 
The second determinant is z^ -^2{-2u + ifz'^ + 4.{v? - w + 1)^ - 3 • 2{v? -u^-

call it T2{z^t^u). 
The first factor Ti{z,t,u) 
is irreducible because its degree is 3, and any 
factor of J-" has degree divisible by 3. That ^2(^5^,'^) is irreducible follows 
from the irreducibility of J^2(^, 1, -1) = z^ -\- 108. (Since z^ + 108 = (z^ -h 
2)(z^ -i- z -\-2){z'^ — z -\-2) mod 5 and the factors on the right are irreducible 
mod 5, all factors of z^ -\- 108 must have even degree. Similarly, 2:^ + 108 = 
{z^ — 2){z^ + 2) mod 7 and the factors on the right are irreducible mod 7, so 
all factors of 2^^ + 108 must have degree divisible by 3. Thus, 2;^ -h 108 has no 
proper factor.) Therefore, x^ — 2 is a product of a factor of degree 1 and a 
factor of degree 2 mod y^ — 2. 
The actual factorization x^ — 2 = {x — y){x'^-^xy-\-y'^) mod {y^ — 2) is in fact 
obvious once the factor of degree 2 is known to be irreducible. Its derivation 
using the algorithm is as follows: The coefficient of u^ in J^i{x -\- uy^ l,ifc) is 
3xy^ — 6, so the factor is ^^| o"^ = 3xy -6j/ ^ ^ _ y ^ ^ ^ g{y). (As expected.

Let f{x) 
and g{y) be monic, irreducible polynomials with coefficients in the 
ring R = Z[ci, C2, . . . , c^,] of polynomials in ci, C2, •.., c^, with integer 
coefficients. The last essay showed that if C is a column matrix of length 
mn whose entries are the monomials x^y^ 
with 0 < a < m — d e g / and 
0 < /3 < n = deg^, arranged in some order, then the congruence 
MC = C'{tx

U{x),g{y)) 
determines an mn x mn matrix M whose entries are homogeneous linear 
polynomials in t and u with coefficients in R. (Here tx -f uy is to be regarded 
as a 1 X 1 matrix, so that the right side of the congruence, like the left, is a 
matrix product.) 
Let ^ ( z , t, u) = det{zl — M) be the characteristic polynomial of M (which, 
by the way, is independent of the choice of the order of the entries of C) and 
let 
be its factorization into irreducible factors that are monic in z. Clearly T is 
homogeneous of degree mn in z, t, and u with coefficients in R^ so the J^i are 
homogeneous in z, t, and u. It is to be shown that the degree of each J-i{z, t, u)

This statement follows from the observation that J^i{x -\- uy, l,u) is a sum of

where Ac,/?^ is in Z[ci, C2, ..., c^] and a + /? + 7 =

uiod g{y) and the coefficients of all higher powers 
of u are zero mod g{y). The main step in the proof of these statements is 
the proof that, as was stated in the preceding essay, T{tx -\- uy^t^u) = 0 mod 
{f{x)^g{y)). 
For the proof of this congruence, let M be as above and let 
A^* be the adjoint of the matrix M — {tx + uy)Imn — M of which J^{tx + 
uy^ t, u) is the determinant. (That is, the entry in the zth row of the jth 
column of A^* is (—1)*"^-^ times the determinant of the [mn — 1) x {mn — 1) 
matrix that remains when the zth column and the jih row of At are deleted.) 
Then A4* • M — J-'{tx + uy,t,u)Imn- 
By the definition of M, all entries of 
the column matrix AiC are zero mod {f{x)^g{y)). 
Therefore all entries of 
J^{tx + uy^t^u)ImnC 
are zero mod {f{x),g{y)). 
Since 1 is an entry of C, it 
follows that J^{tx + uy^t^u) = 0 mod {f{x)^g{y)). 
Thus, T{x + uy^ 1, w) = 
0 mod {f{x)^g{y)). 
Since the combined degree in x and u of any term of 
T{x + uy^ 1,7x) is at most m.n^ the coefficient of u^^~^ has degree at most j 
in X] when j < m it follows that this coefficient has degree less than m, which

means that it is already reduced mod f{x) and therefore, because reduction 
of it both mod f{x) and mod g{y) gives the result zero, it must be zero mod 
g{y). Thus, the coefficients of u^ for k > m{n — 1) are all zero mod g{y)^ as 
was to be shown. As in the previous paragraph, the coefficient of 
J^{x + uy^ 1, i/) is congruent to g'{y)^x'^ 
+ • • • mod g{y)^ where the omitted 
terms have degree less than mmx. 
Since f{x) is monic of degree mmx^ 
the 
polynomial T{x + uy^ 1, u) — g'(y)^ f {x)u'^^^~^^ is zero mod {f{x)^g{y)) 
and 
the coefficient of 
it has no terms of degree m or greater in x, so 
this coefficient is zero mod g{y)^ as was to be shown. 
Thus, when the two sides of the congruence J^{x -\- uy, 1, u) = Yl^ J^i{x -h 
uy^l^u) laod g{y) are regarded as polynomials in u whose coefficients are 
polynomials in x with coefficients in the root field of g{y)^ the left side is 
a polynomial of degree m{n — 1) whose leading coefficient is g'{y)'^f{x). 
The 
ith factor on the left has been shown to have degree at least /ii{n — 1). If it 
had greater degree for any i, the degree of the product would be greater 
than J2iii{n — 1) = m{n — 1), which is not the case. (Since the ring of 
polynomials in x with coefficients in the root field of g{y) is an integral do-
main, the degree of a product is the sum of the degrees of the factors, and 
the leading term of a product is the product of the leading terms.) There-
fore, J^i{x + uy^ l^u) = \lji{x^y)u^^^^^~^^ + • • • mod g{y)^ where the omitted 
terms have degree less than //^(n — 1) in u^ from which the desired congruence 
g'{y)'^f{x) 
= Ylii^i{x,y) 
mod g{y) follows. Since it has already been shown 
that il^i{x,y) = g'{yY^x^^ + • • • mod g{y)^ it remains only to show that the 
il)i{x^ y) are irreducible over the root field of g{y). This fact will follow from a 
quite different description of T{z^ 1,'^), namely, as det f{zln — uG), where G 
is the n X n matrix described above. 
As was noted above, the matrix My obtained from M by setting t = 0 
and li = 1 in M is a matrix of n x n blocks in which the nondiagonal blocks 
are all zero and the diagonal blocks are all the matrix G described above. 
Similarly, M^, the matrix obtained by setting t = 1, u = 0 in M, is a matrix 
of n X n blocks; the first (m — l)n rows are the last (m — l)n rows of Imn^ 
and the last n rows contain the matrices —amln, —^m-i-^n, • • •, —<^i^n, where 
the ai are the coefficients of f{x) = x'^ + aix'^~^ + • • • + a-m- What is to be 
shown is that ^(^, l,t^), which is the determinant of zimn — ^x — uMy by 
the definition of ^ , is det f{zln — uG). Let C be the matrix of n x n blocks 
in which blocks above the diagonal are zero, blocks on the diagonal are J^, 
and blocks i steps below the diagonal are {zIn — uGy. By direct computation, 
{zImn — Mx — uMy)C has the last (m — l)n rows of —Imn in its first (m — l)n 
rows, and has f{zln — uG) in the first n columns of its last n rows. Since the 
determinant of £ is 1, it follows that J^{z^l^u) — dzdet f{zIn — uG). Since 
T{z^ 1, u) and det f{zln — uG) are both monic in 2:, the sign is plus.

1 A Fundamental Theorem 
Since the matrix G satisfies g{G) — 0 (by direct computation,* or, because 
g is the characteristic polynomial of G, an application of the Cay ley-Hamilton 
theorem), a factorization f{x) = 6i{x,y)02{x,y) 
- - - Oi{x^ y) mod g{y) in which 
each Oi{x^ y) has coefficients in the field K of rational functions in ci, C2, ..., 
Cy and is monic in x implies T{z^\^u) 
— detf{zln 
— uG) = <letY\Oi{zIn — 
uG^G) — Y\detOi{zIn 
— uG,G). Such a formula gives a factorization of 
^(z,l,ii) over K in which the factors have degrees z^^n in z, where Ui is 
the degree of Oi in x. If the factorization f{x) = Yl^ii^^v) 
i^od ^(y) found 
above could be further factored, it would follow that J-'{z, 1,'w), and therefore 
J^{z,t,u), 
could be factored over K into factors of lower degrees than the 
factors ^(2^, t,u) = Yl ^i{z^ t, u). But by Gauss's lemma (see Essay 1.4) a fac-
torization of the monic polynomial T{z^ t, u) over the field of quotients K oi R 
implies a factorization over R itself. Therefore, since !F{z^'^^^) — Y\^i{^^t^u) 
is by definition a factorization that cannot be further factored, the proof is 
complete.

Essay 1.7 About the Factorization Algorithm 
The method of factoring f{x) mod g{y) in the preceding essays has as an 
immediate corollary: 
The Kronecker—Kneser* Theorem. 
Let f and g be monic, 
irreducible 
polynomials 
with coefficients 
in Z[ci, C2, ..., 
c^\, and let 
f{x) 
= 01 (x, y)02(^, y)-" 
(t>k{x, y) mod g{y) 
and 
g{y) = xlJi{x,y)i;2{x,y)"- 
^pi{x, y) mod 
f{x) 
be the factorizations 
of each modulo the other. Then k = I, and the 
factors 
can be so ordered that deg^ (/)^/ deg^^ ipi = deg / / deg^ for each i. 
Proof. To factor g{y) mod / ( x ) , one constructs the characteristic polynomial 
^{z, t, u) of the matrix tMy^uM^ 
for which {tMy-\-uMx)C 
= C{ty-\-ux) 
mod 
{g{y)^ f{x)), 
where C is the column matrix of length mn that contains the 
monomials y^x^ 
in which 0 < a < n = degg and 0 < f3 < m = d e g / . 
Because this characteristic polynomial is independent of the order chosen 
for the entries of C, it is clear that !F{z^t^u) 
= !F{z^u^t). 
The factorization 
algorithm proves that A: = / is the number of irreducible factors of 
J^{z,t,u), 
and the integers deg / deg^ ipi = deg^ deg^, (pi are the degrees of those factors. 
In addition to its aesthetic appeal, this theorem is a powerful tool. See 
Essay 2.1, where it is used in the proof of Galois's fundamental theorem. 
Inevitably, some readers will object that the algorithm is impractical. The 
construction of T{z, t, u) is already a formidable task, and the factorization 
of this polynomial in three indeterminates with integer coefficients is even 
more daunting. But the practicality of the algorithm is irrelevant, because its 
purpose is to prove the existence of the factorization, not to effect it. Once the 
factorization is known to exist, methods for constructing it can be addressed. 
A similar situation occurs in the case of the fundamental theorem of algebra 
(see Essay 5.1); Newton's method is in most cases the best way to 
construct 
the roots of a polynomial, but other methods are needed to prove that there 
are roots to be constructed. 
Kronecker emphasized the importance of the problem of factoring f{x) 
mod 
g{y) in a footnote to his 1887 paper "Uber den Zahlbegriff" [43, p. 262 of vol. 
* I called this theorem "Dedekind's reciprocity theorem" in Galois Theory [18, 
p. 66], but I have since learned that it already had the name "Kronecker-
Kneser theorem" (see ([8] and [50]). Richard Dedekind discovered it in 1855, 
but the discovery was not published until Scharlau's paper [59] appeared in 
1982. Kronecker included the theorem in his university lectures ([32, p. 309]). 
He might have known of Dedekind's work, but since he does not seem to have 
cited Dedekind, he probably discovered the theorem independently. The first 
publication of the theorem was by A. Kneser [36].

1 A Fundamental Theorem 
Ilia of the repubhcation in Mathematische 
Werke]. In 1881, he had already 
described an algorithm for such factorizations in the following way: 
It can be assumed that f{x) 
has no repeated factors, because otherwise 
one could free it of repeated factors by dividing it by its greatest common 
divisor with its derivative. One sets z -\- uy in place of x in f{x), 
where 
u is an indeterminate; at the same time, one treats / itself as a function 
of X and the algebraic quantity y, which may figure in its coefficients. 
Therefore, denote / by f{x,y) 
and form the product of all the conjugate 
expressions f{z-\-uy^ y)^ that is, all of them that arise when y is replaced by 
its conjugate values. This product is a polynomial in z whose coefficients 
are rational functions in ci, C2, . . . , c^^ [the presence of u in the coefficients 
is ignored] and therefore, as has been shown, can be decomposed into 
irreducible factors. If these factors are Fi(z), F2{z), . . . , then, as is easy 
to see, the greatest common divisors of / ( z + uy^ y) and Fi{z) for z = 1, 2, 
... give the irreducible factors of f{z + uy^ y)^ from which the irreducible 
factors of f{x) 
itself can be found when x — uy is substituted for z. It 
remains to remark that substitution of 2; +1^^ for x ensures that y actually 
occurs in the coefficients of /."^ 
Dabei kann angenommen werden, dass die Function f{x) keine gleichen Factoren 
enthalt; denn anderenfalls wiirde man dieselbe von gleichen Factoren dadurch 
befreien konnen, dass man sie durch den grossten Theiler, den die Function f{x) 
mit ihrer Ableitung gemein hat, dividirt. Man setze nun zuvorderst z -\- uy an 
Stelle von x in /(x), wo u eine unbestimmte Grosse bedeutet; man betrachte 
ferner / selbst als Function von x and der zum Rationalitats-Bereich gehorigen 
algebraischen Grosse y welche also auch in den Coefficient en vorkommen kann, 
bezeichne demnach die Function / durch /(x, y) und bilde das Product aller mit 
einander conjugirten Ausdriicke 
f{z-\-uy,y), 
d. h. aller derjenigen, welche entstehen, wenn man die mit y conjugierten alge-
braischen Grossen an Stelle von y setzt. Dieses Product ist eine ganze Function 
von z, deren Coefficienten rationale Functionen der Variabeln ci, C2, ..., Cj, sind, 
kann also nach dem Vorhergehenden in irreductible Factoren zerlegt werden. Sind 
diese Factoren: J^i{z), ^2(2^), •••, so bilden, wie leicht zu sehen, die grossten 
gemeinschaftlichen Theiler von 
f{z-\-uy,y) 
und 
Th{z) 
fur /i = 1, 2, ... die irreductibeln Factoren von f{z-\-uy^ y), aus denen die Factoren 
von f{x) selbst unmittelbar hervorgehen, wenn wieder x — uy ?iii Stelle von z 
gesetzt wird. Es ist noch zu bemerken, dass die Einfiihrung von 2: + ny an Stelle 
von X zu dem Zwecke erfolgt ist, das Vorkommen von y in den Coefficienten zu 
sichern. (From §4 of [39]. The translation above is somewhat free, and Kronecker's 
notation F, 91, IH', d\'\ d\"'^ ..., has been changed to /, ?/, ci, C2, ..., Cjy to agree 
with the notation of these essays.) 

Essay 1.7 About the Factorization Algorithm 
33 
My discussion of this subject in [18, §§60-61] shows that I found the exact 
algorithm Kronecker had in mind—not to mention its validity—far from "easy 
to see." In retrospect, however, I do see that it is essentially the algorithm of 
Essay 1.5. 
Instead of factoring a polynomial in x alone as in Essay 1.5, Kronecker 
changes f{x) to f{z + uy), where u is an indeterminate, in order to be sure 
that the polynomial to be factored does involve y. He then forms the "pro-
duct of its conjugates," by which he surely means (see his §2) the norm of 
f{z -h uy) as a polynomial with coefficients in the root field of g{y)^ which 
is to say that it is plus or minus the constant term of the polynomial of 
which f{z-\- uy) is a root. The polynomial of which f{z-\- uy) is a root is the 
characteristic polynomial of the matrix M of elements of R[z, u] defined by 
C • f{z + uy) = MC mod g{y)^ where C is the column matrix with entries 1, ?/, 
^^, ..., y'^~^ (n being the degree of ^). Thus, Kronecker's ^1(2;), ^2(^)5 • • • are 
the irreducible factors of the constant term of the characteristic polynomial 
of this M. But this is zbdetM, and M is the n x n matrix f(zl 
+ wG), 
where G is the matrix determined by g{y) as in Essay 1.6. Thus, the Fi{z) 
are the irreducible factors of det/(2;/ + uG). Since, as was shown in Essay 
1.6, det/(;^/ + uG) = T{z^ 1, —u)^ he is saying that the desired irreducible 
factors 0i(x, y) are the greatest common divisors of f{z^-uy) with Ti (z, 1, —u)^ 
T2{z^ 1, —It), ..., or, better, the greatest common divisors of j{x) with T\{x — 
uy^ 1, —ix), ^2(^ — uy^ 1, —'^)5 
When one changes the sign of u and notes 
that a common divisor of f{x) and Ti{x -\- uy^l^u) must be independent of 
u and must therefore divide all coefficients of J^i{x -h uy^l^u), 
Kronecker's 
claim becomes the statement that (j)i{x^y) is the greatest common divisor of 
fix) and the coefficients of J-i{x + uy^ l,?i) when it is expanded in powers 
of u. Now, (j)i{x^y) is the greatest common divisor of f{x) and the leading 
coefficient %lji{x,y) mod g{y) in this expansion, so his claim comes down to 
the statement that (/)i(x, y) divides all the other coefficients oi Ti{x-^uy^l, 
u) 
when they are regarded as polynomials in x with coefficients in the root field 
of ^(y). 
Proposition. 
As a polynomial in x and u with coefficients in the root field 
of g{y), J^i{x -\-uy^l^u) is divisible by (f)i{x^y). 
Proof. Let /C be the field K[x^y] mod ((/>i(x, y),g{y)), which is the ring of poly-
nomials in X with coefficients in the root field of g{y) modulo the irreducible 
polynomial (j)i{x^y) with coefficients in this root field. (As before, K denotes 
the field of rational functions in ci, C2, ..., c^.) Since f{x) is 0 as a polyno-
mial with coefficients in /C (because f{x) is divisible by (j)i{x^y) mod ^(2/)), 
and since ^(2;, t, tt) = 0 mod {f{x),g{y)) 
as was shown in Essay 1.6, J-'{z^ t, u) 
is zero as a polynomial with coefficients in IC. Therefore at least one of its 
factors Tj{z^t^u) 
must be zero as a polynomial with coefficients in /C. For 
any such value of j , J-j{x -\- uy^ 1, u) must be zero as a polynomial in u with 
coefficients in /C. In particular, iljj{x^y) must be zero as an element of /C, 
which is to say that ipj{x,y) is divisible by (f)i{x^y) mod g{y). But ipjix^y) 

34 
1 A Fundamental Theorem 
is a unit times (j)j{x^y) and the irreducible factors (j)j{x^y) of f{x) mod g{y) 
are distinct because f{x) is irreducible. Therefore, 2pj{x,y) is not divisible by 
(j)i{x^y) mod g{y) unless j — i, and the proposition follows.

Essay 1.8 Proof of the Fundamental Theorem 
As before, R will denote the ring Z[ci, C2, ..., c^^] of polynomials in ci, C2, ..., 
Cjy with integer coefficients and K will denote its field of quotients, the field 
of rational functions of ci, C2, ..., c^^. When z/ = 0, i? is the ring of integers 
and K is the field of rational numbers. The theorem to be proved was stated 
in Essay T2: 
Fundamental Theorem. 
Given a polynomial f{x) — a^x^^a\x^~^ 
^ 
h 
On of positive degree n with coefficients in R, construct a monic, irreducible 
polynomial g(y) with coefficients in R with the property that f{x) is a product 
of linear factors with coefficients in the root field of g{y). 
In other words, when the factors of f{x) mod g{y) are taken to be monic in 
X, the factorization is to have the form f{x) = ao{x — pi{y)){x — p2{y)) • • • (x — 
pn{y)) mod g{y), where ao is the leading coefficient of f{x) and the pi{y) are 
elements of the root field of g{y). Such a polynomial g{y) will be said to split 
f{x). As the proposition at the end of Essay 1.4 implies, the roots Pi{y) are 
determined, as elements of the root field of g{y)^ by f{x). 
Loosely speaking, the root field of g{y) extends computations in J^ in such 
a way that the given f{x) with coefficients in R splits into linear factors. 
The factorization algorithm of the preceding essays, which assumes that 
f{x) is monic and irreducible, can be used to factor an arbitrary / by taking 
the change of variable xi = aox and writing aQ~^f{x) = Xi + aiXi~^ + 
aoa2Xi~'^ H 
ha^Q~^ajX^~-^ H 
ha^'^an- A factorization of aQ~^f{x) as a 
polynomial in Xi becomes a factorization of f{x) as a polynomial in x when 
it is divided by the nonzero element OQ"^ of K and the substitution Xi = aox 
is made. In this way, the theorem is reduced to the case in which f{x) is 
monic. The iteration theorem below proves this case of the theorem using the 
factorization algorithm for monic, irreducible polynomials, which obviously 
implies a factorization algorithm for arbitrary monic polynomials. 
This theorem differs from Kronecker's theorem in Ein 
Fundamentalsatz 
der allgemeinen Arithmetik [42] in that it specifies that the splitting field is 
to be described as the root field of g{y)^ whereas Kronecker left the form 
of the description open and in fact preferred a "prime module system" of 
an altogether different type. Nor is the proof below similar to Kronecker's, 
which constructed specific relations satisfied by the roots in a splitting field. 
Instead, it constructs a splitting polynomial g{y) for f{x) in an iterative way 
that follows the naive proof sketched at the beginning of Essay 1.4. 
Iteration Theorem. 
Given a monic polynomial f{x) with coefficients in R, 
and given a monic, irreducible polynomial g{y) with coefficients in R that does 
not split f{x), construct a monic, irreducible polynomial h{z) with coefficients 
in R for which the factorization of f{x) mod h{z) contains more linear factors 
than does the factorization of f{x) mod g{y). 

36 
1 A Fundamental Theorem 
Proof. The factorization of f{x) mod g{y) is accomphshed by applying the 
factorization algorithm to each of the monic, irreducible factors of f{x) and 
taking the product of the results. By assumption, at least one of the irreducible 
factors of f{x) mod g{y) obtained in this way has degree greater than 1. With 
the notation as before, at least one of the polynomials T{z^ t, u) used in the 
factorization of f{x) mod g{y) (there is an T for each irreducible factor of 
/(x)) must, by assumption, have at least one factor !Fi{z^t^u) that gives rise 
to a monic factor (j)i{x^y) of f{x) mod g{y) of degree greater than 1. Let 
Ti{z,t^u) 
be such a factor, and let <pi{x^y) be the corresponding factor of 
f{x) 
iaodg{y). 
Lemma. 
The monic polynomial ha{z) — ^i(z, 1, a) with coefficients in R is 
irreducible for at least one positive integer a less than (deg^i)^. 
Proof. The essence of the construction is a double adjunction., first of a root y 
of g{y) to R to form the root field of g{y) and then of a root x of 0i(a:, y) to 
find a simple algebraic extension of the root field of g{y)- Let /C be the field 
obtained in this way. That is, elements of /C are represented by polynomials in 
X with coefficients in the root field oi g{y), and two such polynomials represent 
the same element of /C when they differ by a multiple of (f)i{x^ y). Clearly, each 
element of /C has a unique representative of degree less than /ii = deg^^^i; 
since each element of the root field of g{y) has a unique representative as a 
polynomial of degree less than n — degg in y with coefficients in K., /C is 
a vector space of dimension jiin over K. It is obviously a ring in the usual 
way (to multiply elements, multiply their representatives, and reduce first 
mod (j)i{x^y) to reduce the degree in x and then reduce mod g{y))' It is a 
field by virtue of the irreducibility of 0i(x,7/) mod g{y). (This irreducibility 
implies that if g(x, y) is a nonzero polynomial of degree less than //i in x with 
coefficients in the root field of g{y), then r{x,y)q{x,y) 
+ s{x,y)(j)i{x,y) 
= 
0 mod g{y) has only the trivial solution, because irreducible polynomials with 
coefficients in the root field of g{y) are prime. Therefore, by the argument 
of the elimination lemma of Essay 1.3, there is a solution of r{x,y)q{x,y) 
+ 
s{x,y)(j)i{x^y) = qi{y), where qi{y) is a nonzero element of the root field of 
g{y). Therefore, q{x, y) has a reciprocal r(x, y)/qi{y) in /C and a fortiori is not 
a zero divisor.) 
Let Ci denote the column matrix of length /xin containing the monomials 
rj.ocy(3 -^^ which 0 < Of < /ii and 0 < /? < n. Let J\f{u) be the //in x jiin matrix

(This single congruence is equivalent to

therefore one 
with coefficients in R—whose 
degree in z was less than jj^in = d e g ^ i and for 
which reduction of F{x + uy, u) mod (01 (x, y)^g{y)) 
gave zero. Application of 
the Euclidean algorithm to Ti{z^ 1, u) and F{z^ u) as polynomials in z with co-
efficients in the field of quotients of K[u] would give polynomials a{z) and f5{z)

irreducible, it would be a factor either of D{z, u) or of Qi{z^ u). It cannot be a 
factor of D(z, w), because this would imply that it was a factor of A{u)F{z^ 
u)^ 
contrary to deg^ F < fiin = d e g ^ ^ i . Nor can it be a factor of Qi{z,u)^ 
be-
cause then D{z^u) 
would divide A(u) and therefore be independent of z, con-
trary to D(x+n?/, it) =^ A{x^uy^u)Ti{x-^uy^l^u)-\-B{x+uy^u)F{x^uy^u) 
= 
0 mod {(j)i{x,y),g{y)). 
Therefore, detM{u) 
^ 0. 
Given an integer a, consider the homomorphism i from K[z\ to IC that 
carries z to x -[- ay and carries elements of K to themselves. Since L carries 
ha{z) 
= ^1(2^, 1, a) to J^i{x + a^, l,a), which represents the zero''" element 
of /C, L defines a homomorphism from K[z] mod ha{z) to /C. The matrix of 
coefficients of L relative to the basis x'^y^ of /C and the basis z^ (0 < 7 < 
/iin) of K[z] mod ha{z) is Af{a). If its determinant is nonzero, then L is an 
isomorphism. In this case, because /C is a field, K[z] mod ha{z) is a field, which 
implies that ha{z) is irreducible over K and therefore, by Gauss's lemma (see 
Essay 1.4), is irreducible over R. 
The degree of det J\f{u) is at most |//in(//in — 1) < (//in)^ = (deg^i)^, so 
det J\f{u) is zero for fewer than (deg^i)^ integers a, and the lemma follows. 
Proof of the Iteration 
Theorem. 
Suppose that h{z) = ha{z) 
= ^1(2:, 1, a), 
where a is chosen in such a way that h is irreducible, and let )C be the root 
* If the rank of J\f{u) is fiin — 1, any nonzero row of the adjoint matrix J\f{uy 
oi J\f{u) is such a solution. Otherwise, choose an (r -h 1) x (r + 1) subsystem of 
the original fiin x /^in system whose rank r is the same as that of the original 
system. A nonzero row of the adjoint of the matrix of coefficients of the chosen 
subsystem, filled out with zeros, is a nontrivial solution of the original system.

1 A Fundamental Theorem 
field of h{z). It is to be shown that the factorization of f{x) mod h{z) contains 
more linear factors than does the factorization of f{x) mod g{y). In other 
words, it is to be shown that the root field of h{z) contains more roots of f{x) 
than does the root field of g{y). 
As was shown in the proof of the lemma, K[z] mod h{z) is isomorphic to 
/C, which is by definition K[x^y] mod {g{y)^ (j)i{x^ay^y)). 
Since this last field 
contains a root y of g{y)^ it contains a field isomorphic to K[y] mod g{y)^ so 
it certainly contains at least as many roots of f{x) as K[y] mod g{y) does. 
But f{x) = (t)i{x,y)(l)2{x,y) •'• (pkix, y) mod g{y) implies that f{x-^ay) 
= 
0 mod {g{y), (pi{x-\-ay, y)), so /C contains a root of f{x)—namely, the element 
represented hy x-\- ay—that is not in the subfield corresponding to K[y] mod 
g{y) (because it is reduced mod {g{x)^(j)i{x + cty.y)) and contains x). Thus, 
f{x) has at least one more root in the new field than it did in the old, as was 
to be shown. 
Proof of the fundamental theorem. Given /(x), start with g{y) = y and ap-
ply the following algorithm. If g{y) splits /(x), the algorithm terminates. 
Otherwise, use the iteration theorem to construct h{z) such that the factor-
ization of f{x) mod h{z) has more linear factors than does the factorization of 
f{x) mod g{y). Replace g{y) with h{z) and repeat. Since the number of linear 
factors of f{x) mod g{y) increases with each step and can never exceed deg/, 
the algorithm must terminate after at most deg/ steps with a polynomial 
that splits f{x).

Essay 1.9 Minimal Splitting Polynomials 
The theorem of the preceding essay puts the statement "every polynomial has 
a splitting field" in a very specific and concrete form: Given a polynomial f{x) 
in one indeterminate with coefficients in R = Z[ci, C2, . . . , Cj^], the iterative 
algorithm that proves the fundamental theorem in the last essay constructs 
a monic, irreducible polynomial in one indeterminate g{y), with coefficients 
in the same ring i?, with the property that all factors of the factorization of 
f{x) mod g{y) are linear in x. 
The splitting field of a polynomial, as opposed to a splitting field, is the 
field generated by the roots. In other words, it is the field implicit in the 
assertion (see Essay 1.2) that there is a valid way to do rational computations 
with the roots of a polynomial. A specific and concrete description of the 
splitting field of f{x) is given by an amended version of the theorem of the 
preceding essay: 
Theorem. 
Given a polynomial 
f{x) = aox'^ -h aix^~^ 
-h • • • -f a^ with coef-
ficients 
in R, construct 
a monic, irreducible polynomial 
g{y) with 
coefficients 
in R that splits f{x) and is itself split by any polynomial 
that splits 
f{x). 
In particular, g{y) splits itself. Galois wrote,* ".. .every equation depends 
on an auxiliary equation with the property that all the roots of this new equa-
tion are rational functions of one another," which is to say that the polynomial 
in the new equation splits itself. He went on to write, "... this remark is a mere 
curiosity; in fact, an equation which has this property is not in general any 
easier to solve than any other," but it is hard to understand how Galois could 
call his observation a "mere curiosity," because, as Essay 2.1 will explain, his 
brilliant insight into the algebraic solution of equations is based on the exis-
tence of such an "auxiliary equation" and on the fact that the solution of such 
an equation can be analyzed using the automorphisms of its splitting field. A 
polynomial that splits itself is called a Galois polynomial. 
Proof. The construction that proved the theorem of the preceding essay in 
fact proves this stronger theorem, because the polynomial 
it constructs 
is split 
by any polynomial 
that splits f{x). Since any polynomial that splits f{x) also 
splits the identity polynomial g{y) = y, the proof of this statement comes down 
to proving the following statement: Let a monic, irreducible polynomial 
with 
coefficients 
in R split both f{x) 
and g{y); then it also splits any 
polynomial 
h{z) constructed 
by the iteration 
theorem of the preceding 
essay. 
Since h{z) has the form ^ i ( z , l,a) for some integer a, it will suflB.ce to 
prove that any polynomial gi{v)—monic, 
irreducible, and with coeflBcients in 
R—that 
splits the monic, irreducible polynomials f{x) and g{y) also splits 
the polynomial J-{z, t, u) that is constructed from f{x) and g{y) by the fac-
torization algorithm in Essay 1.5. 
Quoted from my translation of Galois's memoir in Appendix 1 of [18].

1 A Fundamental Theorem 
Let /C denote the root field ofgi{v). Since gi{v) splits /(x), /C contains m = 
deg / distinct (because / is irreducible, it is relatively prime to its derivative, 
so it has no multiple roots) roots of /; call them ai, a2, ..., a^. Similarly, 
/C contains n = deg^ distinct roots of g; call them 61, 62, ..., bn- That gi{v) 
splits J^{z^ t, ix) will be proved by proving that 
J-{z, t, u) = jT(^ — ciit — bju)^ 
where the product is over all mn pairs (i, j) in which 1 < i < m and I < j < n. 
The number mn of factors on the right is the degree of the homogeneous 
polynomial on the left, and they are distinct (to say that two polynomials of 
the form z — ait — bjU are equal means that their coefficients are equal, which 
occurs only when both i and j have the same values in them), so the formula 
will be proved if it is proved that each z — ait — bjU is a factor of T{z, t, u). In 
other words, what is to be shown is that T{ait + bjU^ t, u) — 0. To put it yet 
another way, the determinant of the vnn x mn matrix (a^t H- bju)Imn — tMx — 
uMy is to be shown to be zero for all pairs (i, j). Here M^ is by definition 
the mn x mn matrix of elements of R for which MxC = Cx mod 
{f{x),g{y)), 
where C is a column matrix of length mn whose entries are x^y^ for 0 < 
a < m, 0 < P < n. Thus, each of the mn entries of the column matrix 
MxC differs from the corresponding entry of Cx by a polynomial of the form 
(j){x^y)f{x) + il){x,y)g{y). Because a^ is a root of f{x) and bj is a root of 
g{y)^ it follows that MxCij and Cijai are equal as matrices whose entries are 
in /C, where Cij is C with a^ substituted for x and bj substituted for y. In 
the same way, MyCij = Cijbj. Therefore {{ait + bju)Imn — t^x — uMy)Cij = 
t{ailmn — Mx)Cij -\-u{bjImn " ^y)Cij 
= 0. Siucc 1 = a^b^ is one of the entries 
of Cij, the determinant of {ait -\- bju)Imn — tMx — uMy must be zero, as was 
to be shown. 
A polynomial that splits f{x) and is split by any other polynomial that 
splits f{x) is a minimal splitting polynomial of f{x). There are infinitely 
many minimal splitting polynomials of /(x), but only one splitting field. In 
other words, the root fields of two minimal splitting polynomials are isomor-
phic, as follows from the fact that each polynomial splits the other. This 
observation is the key to the notion of the Galois group of f{x), which is 
introduced in the first essay of Part 2.

Theoreme. Soit une equation donnee, dont a, h, c, ... sont les m racines. 
II y aura toujours un groupe de permutations des lettres a, h, c, ... qui

1° que toute fonction des racines, invariables par les substitutions de ce

2° reciproquement, toute fonction des racines, determinable

ment, soit invariable par ces substitutions.—E. Galois [27] (English trans-
lation [18, p. 104]) 
A Galois polynomial is a monic, irreducible polynomial that splits itself, 
and a Galois field is the root field of a Galois polynomial. Here the Galois 
polynomial, call it ^f, is assumed to have its coefficients in a ring of the form 
i^ = Z[ci, C2, ..., c^y], the polynomials with integer coefficients in some set Ci, 
C2, ..., Ciy of indeterminates, so the associated Galois field extends the field 
of quotients K of R, which is the field of rational functions in ci, C2, ..., Cj^. 
As is explained in Essay 1.3, computations in the Galois field are done with 
expressions of the form p{y)/q^ where p{y) is a polynomial in y with coefficients 
in R whose degree is less than deg^f, and g is a nonzero element of R. Such 
an expression can also be regarded as a polynomial in y with coefficients in 
K, in which case the notation K[y] mod g{y) becomes a natural one for the 
root field of g{y). 
Because g splits itself, g{x) = HlLiC^ ~" P^iv)) ^^d g{y)^ where n is the 
degree of g and pi{y), p2{y), • • •, pn{y) are elements of the field. The poly-
nomials pi{y) represent distinct elements of the root field of g{y). When they 
are reduced mod g{y)^ they are determined by g{y). One of them is y. Sub-
stitution of one of the roots Pi{y) in place of y gives an automorphism of 
K[y] mod g{y). (Since g{pi{y)) = 0 mod g{y), (piy) = ^{y) mod g{y) implies 
(j){pi{y)) = "(pipiiy)) mod^(y), so substitution of Pi{y) for y gives a homo-
morphism of K[y] mod g{y) to itself. It is represented by an n x n matrix

of elements of K, so to prove that it is one-to-one and onto it will suf-
fice to prove (j){pi{y)) = {) vnod g{y) only when (f){y) = 0 mod g{y). But if 
(j)(y) ^ 0 mod g{y)^ then (j){y) has a reciprocal mod g{y)^ so (pipiiy)) has a 
reciprocal mod g{y) and is therefore not zero mod g{y).) Conversely, since an 
automorphism of the field must carry the root ^ of ^ to another root of g^ 
there are precisely n automorphisms of K[y] mod g{y), and an automorphism 
is determined by the root Pi{y) of g to which it carries y. The group of these 
automorphisms is the Galois group of the field. More generally, the Ga-
lois group of a polynomial f{x) is the Galois group of a minimal splitting 
polynomial of f{x) (see Essay 1.9). 
The modern version of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory states 
that the subgroups of the Galois group of a given Galois polynomial g{y) cor-
respond one-to-one to subfields of the Galois field K[y] mod g(y) that contain 
K. This is nearly Galois's statement of his Proposition 1. Galois was thinking 
of the field as being built up by a succession of what he called "adjunctions" 
(see Essay 2.3), and the main problem was to determine, after certain adjunc-
tions had been made, which elements of the field could then be "determined 
rationally." He said (see above) that there is a subgroup of the group of auto-
morphisms that leaves fixed the elements that can be determined rationally 
and leaves only these fixed. (He described the automorphisms in terms of the 
way that they permute the roots of some polynomial of which the Galois field 
is the splitting field. For him, the elements of the Galois field were rational 
functions of the roots, so an automorphism of the field was tantamount to the 
permutation of the roots that it effected.) In more modern terminology, he 
was saying that the subfield generated by the adjoined elements xi, X2, ..., 

Essay 2.1 Galois's Fundamental Theorem

Xm contains exactly the elements that are left fixed by the automorphisms 
that leave all of the x's fixed: 
Galois's Theorem. 
Let xi, 
X2, 
.., 
Xm be elements 
of a Galois 
field 
K[y] mod g{y). The obvious necessary condition for another element z of the 
field to be expressible as a polynomial 
in xi, X2, . . . ; Xm with coefficients 
in 
K—namely, 
that z be unmoved 
by any automorphism 
of the field that leaves 
each of xi, X2, 
. •, Xm unmoved—is 
also 
sufficient. 
Proof 
Suppose first that xi, X2^ .. •, Xm are all in K, or, what is eff'ectively 
the same, that m = 0. Then all automorphisms leave the x's unmoved, and 
what is to be shown is that all automorphisms leave z unmoved only if z is 
in K. Let z be expressed as a polynomial in y of degree less than n = deg^ 
with coefl^icients in K^ say z{y) = aiy^~^ 
-\- a2y^~^ + • • • + a^. Consider the 
polynomial C{X) = aiX^~^ 
+ a2X^~'^ -\ 
\- a^ — z{y), a polynomial in the 
indeterminate X with coefficients in the Galois field. (All coefficients but the 
constant term an — z{y) are in the smaller field K.)To 
say that substitution of 
any root pi{y) in place of ^ in z{y) does not change z{y) mod g{y) is to say that 
ai{pi{y)Y-^ 
+ a2{Pi{y)T-'' 
+ • • • + a^ - z{y) = z{pi{y)) - z{y) = 0 mod g{y). 
In other words, each Pi{y) is a root of C{X) in the Galois field. Since the 
degree of C(-^) is less than n, the fact that it has n distinct roots in the root 
field of g{y) (that is, n distinct linear factors X — Pi{y)) implies* that it is 
zero. In particular, its constant term a^ — z{y) must be zero, so z{y) = a^ is 
in i^, as was to be shown. 
Suppose next that m = 1, and let x{y) denote the one given field ele-
ment. Let the list of images x{pi{y)) 
of x{y) under the Galois group con-
sist of cr distinct field elements, each occurring r = n/a 
times, and let 
0(X) = n ( - ^ ~ ^{pi{y))) 
be the polynomial of degree a in the indetermi-
nate X with coefficients in the Galois field obtained by taking the product 
of the distinct 
factors X — x{pi{y)). 
For any j = 1, 2, . . . , n, changing y 
to pj{y) 
in (j){X) merely permutes the factors and does not change (j){X). 
Therefore, each coefficient oi (j){X) is unchanged by the automorphisms in the 
Galois group, so, by the case m = 0 that has already been proved, 0(X) is 
a polynomial with coefficients in K. Therefore, an element ao in R can be 
found for which aQ(j){X) has coefficients in R. If x{y) is replaced by aQx{y), 
the new x{y) is a root of the monic polynomial aQ~'^(/)(X/ao), and an element 
of the Galois field can be expressed as a polynomial in the old x{y) with coef-
ficients in K if and only if it can be expressed as a polynomial in the new one 
with coefficients in K. Therefore, one can assume without loss of generality 
that (/)(X) is monic in X with coefficients in R. It is irreducible, because a 
monic factor of (/)(X) = JJ(X — x{pi{y))) 
over iC is a product of some subset 
of its factors X — x{pi{y)) 
over the Galois field, so, if it is not 1, it has at 
least one x{pi{y)) 
as a root, which implies that it has all x{pi{y)) 
as roots 
(because an automorphism carries roots to roots, and the automorphisms act

transitively on the Pi{y)) and is therefore 0(X) itself. If g{Y) is the Galois 
polynomial that defines the field, the statement that (j){X) has a = deg(/) 
roots in the Galois field is the statement that g(Y) 
splits 0(X). Therefore, 
by the Kronecker-Kneser theorem,* the factorization of g{Y) mod <j){X) con-
sists of G factors, each of degree r = n/cr, say g{Y) = W ^liY^ X) mod (j){X)^ 
where each ^i is a polynomial in two indeterminates with coefficients in K. 
Since (j){x{y)) = Omod^(^), g{Y) = Y\^i(X-,^{y)) 
mod ^(?/) (the difference 
of g{Y) 
and ^^^^^(y, X ) is a multiple of 0(X) so it is a polynomial in X 
and Y in which the substitution of x{y) for X gives a polynomial in y and 
y that is zero mod g{y))^ so each ^i{Y^x{y)) 
has precisely r distinct roots 
/?i(^) mod g{y)^ and the roots of ^ mod g{y) are partitioned in this way into a 
sets of r each. Let lZ^i(y, X) be the factor for which l^i(i/, x(y)) = 0 mod g{y). 
Suppose now that z{y) is unchanged by all automorphisms y H^ pi{y) that 
leave x{y) 
unmoved; i.e., z{pi{y)) 
= z{y) uvod g{y) for every z for which 
x{pi{y)) 
= x(y) laod g{y). Division of z{Y) 
by ^liY^X)—where 
capital let-
ters are used to emphasize that the division is division of a polynomial in 
Y with coefficients in i^ by a monic polynomial in Y with coefficients in 
K[X] 
and has nothing to do with operations in the Galois field—gives an 
equation z(Y) 
= q{Y^ X)^i(Y^ 
X) + r(Y^ X), where the degree of the remain-
der r(y, X) in Y is less than r. Since ^i{pi{y)^x{y)) 
= 0 mod g{y) for each 
of the T values of i for which x{pi{y)) 
= x{y) vaod g{y) (because the au-
tomorphism y h-> pi{y) carries ^i{y^x{y)) 
mod g{y) to ^i{pi{y),x{y)) 
and 
y^i{y,x{y)) 
= 0 mod g{y) by the definition of lZ^i(F, X)), and since by assump-
tion z{pi{y)) 
= z{y) mod g{y) for each of them, r{pi{y)^x{y)) 
is the same 
element of the Galois field for each of r distinct values of z, which is to say 
that r{Y,x{y)), 
as a polynomial in Y with coefficients in the Galois field, 
has the same value z{y) for r distinct values Pi{y) of Y. Because the degree 
of r in y is less than r, the argument given in the case m = 0 shows that 
r{Y,x{y)) 
— z{y) is the zero polynomial (in Y with coefficients in the Ga-
lois field), which gives the required expression z{y) = r(0,x(i/)) of z{y) as a 
polynomial in x{y) with coefficients in K. 
Finally, the general case follows from the case ?7i = 1 just proved once one 
proves the lemma below, because a polynomial in uiXi -\- U2X2 + • • • + UmXm, 
where ui, U2, . . . , Um are integers, can obviously be expressed as a polynomial

f x of the Galois field, and let u be an integer 
that is not equal to any such Zi. (The number of ^'s is at most n — 1, so there 
is sure to be such an integer u among 1, 2, ..., n.) Then x — uxi ^ X2 has 
the required property, because an automorphism that does not move x cannot

. . . the deep meaning of Kronecker^s 
view, according to which the 
absolutely 
algebraic fields [finite fields or algebraic number fields of finite degree] are 
the natural ground-fields 
of algebraic geometry, 
at any rate as long as purely 
algebraic methods are being used.—Andre 
Weil [62] 
Kronecker asserted, in substance, in §2 of his treatise Grundziige 
einer 
arithmetischen 
Theorie 
der algebraischen 
Grossen 
[39] that the field of ra-
tional functions 
in any finite set of algebraic quantities 
is isomorphic 
to a 
root field as that term is defined in Essay 
1.3. 
Because the term "algebraic quantity" is vague, this is not an assertion that 
can be proved. However, it can be deduced from a few natural assumptions 
about "algebraic quantities" as follows. 
Suppose first that just one "algebraic quantity" q is involved. For any poly-
nomial F{X) 
with integer coefficients, F{q) should be a meaningful algebraic 
quantity, because one must surely be able to add, subtract, and multiply al-
gebraic quantities. Moreover, one should be able to determine when two such 
polynomials in q have the same value, or, what is the same, able to deter-
mine which such polynomials in q are zero. If only the zero polynomial 
F[X) 
satisfies F{q) — 0, then the field of rational functions in q is simply the field 
of rational functions in a single indeterminate, which is the root field of the 
polynomial y — ci with coefficients in Z[ci]. Otherwise, there is an irreducible 
polynomial F{X) 
with integer coefficients for which F{q) = 0, provided one 
makes the natural assumption that a product of "algebraic quantities" can 
be zero only when one of the factors is zero. (Of course, F{q) = 0 implies 
that F is not a unit.) Let F{q) = a^q^ + aiq^~^ 
+ • • • + a^i be zero, where 
the coefficients ai are integers and F{y) is irreducible, and let / be the monic 
polynomial with integer coefficients defined by f{y) 
= a^~^F{y/a^)). 
Then, 
because rational functions of q are rational functions of a^q and conversely, 
and because ao^ is a root of / , the field of rational functions in q is isomorphic 
to the root field of / ( ^ ) , which completes the "proof" of Kronecker's assertion 
in the case of a single algebraic quantity. 
Suppose now that the assertion is true for a set gi, ^^2, • • •, ^m of ^ algebraic 
quantities and let an (m-hl)st algebraic quantity qm+i be given. Let Q and QQ 
denote the fields of rational functions in gi, ^^2, • • •, ^m+i and in gi, ^2, • • •, ^m, 
respectively. By the inductive hypothesis, QQ is isomorphic to the root field of 
some monic, irreducible polynomial g{y) with coefficients in Z[ci, r!2, •. •, c^] 
for some u. An element of i? can be expressed as a quotient of polynomials 
in qm+i with coefficients in QQ. AS before, there are two cases, depending 
on whether there is a nonzero polynomial F{X)

field of g{y)^ say F{q,y) 
= 0, where F is a polynomial in two indeterminates 
with coefficients in Z[ci, C2, . . . , Ci^] and y is a root of g{y) in a splitting field 
of g; then g is a root of J^{X) = HiLi -^(-^^ yi)-) where n is the degree of g and 
the yi are the roots of g in the splitting field, so that T{X) 
has coefficients 
that are symmetric polynomials in T/I, 2/2,---i^n and are therefore in Z[ci, 
C2, . . . , Ci^]. The given field Q is then isomorphic to a subfield of the splitting 
field of g{X)T{X), 
namely, the subfield obtained by adjoining first a root y 
of g and then a root q of F{X,y). 
By the theorem of the primitive element, 
this field is the root field of a monic, irreducible polynomial with coefficients 
in Z[ci, C2, . . . , Ci^]. In either case, then, i? is a root field, as was to be shown. 
The definition of an "algebraic quantity" is problematic, because algebraic 
quantities by their very nature do not exist in isolation; they are "things on 
which rational computations can be performed," and therefore are items in 
entire systems of computation, which is to say, elements of entire fields. All 
in all, it seems best to adopt Kronecker's later view (see Essay 1.1) and to 
abandon the notion of algebraic quantities in favor of a formulation of the 
subject in terms of "general arithmetic" and to make the above assertion a 
definition: 
An algebraic field is a field that can be described as the field of quotients 
of an integral domain of the form Z[ci, C2, . . . , c^] mod F , where F is a 
nonconstant irreducible element of Z[ci, C2, . . . , c^y]. (If F is constant and 
irreducible, this field of quotients is the field of rational functions in ci, C2, . . . , 
Cjy with coefficients in the field with p elements for some prime p, a field that 
does not really seem to merit the name "algebraic field." The field of rational 
functions in ci, C2, . . . , Cjy with integer coefficients is an algebraic field; for 
example, it is the field of quotients of Z[ci, C2, . •., c^, Cj^-\-i] mod c^y+i.) 
Note that there is no stipulation that the irreducible polynomial be monic 
in one of its indeterminates. Such a stipulation would involve the indetermi-
nates asymmetrically. As was seen above, one can adjoin a root of a polynomial 
F{X) 
= aoX'^ + aiX^~^ 
+ • • • + a^ by adjoining a root of the monic polyno-
mial f{X) 
= aQ~^F{X/ao), 
from which it follows easily that every algebraic 
field can be presented as the root field of an irreducible element of Z [ci, C2, 
. . . , Ciy] that is monic and of positive degree in Ci for some i. 
A set of elements i^i, 1^2, • • •, Uk of an algebraic field is algebraically 
independent if no nonzero polynomial (j) in k indeterminates with integer 
coefficients satisfies 0(iii, U2, . . . , Uk) = 0. If the polynomial F that deter-
mines an algebraic field involves c^^, then the indeterminates ci, C2, . . . , Cj^-i 
represent algebraically independent elements of the algebraic field. (The con-
struction of this field can be described as the adjunction of a root of a monic 
irreducible polynomial to the field of rational functions of ci, C2, . . . , Cjy_i.) 
Therefore, such an algebraic field always contains a set of z/ — 1 algebraically 
independent elements. The transcendence degree of an algebraic field is the 
maximum number of elements in an algebraically independent subset. The fol-
lowing proposition implies that an algebraic field defined by some irreducible 
F in Z[ci, C2, . . . , Cj/l has transcendence degree u — 1:

Proposition. 
Let a nonconstant

element F OJTA\C\, C^, -..,

he given. Assume 
that F involves c^ and let u he an element 
of the algehraic 
field F determines. 
For a given numher I < v, one can determine 
whether the 
elements Ci, 02, . •., ci, u are algebraically independent, 
and if they are, one 
can describe the algebraic field as being determined 
by an irreducible 
element 
Fi ofZ[di, 
d2, . . . ; dj^], where the first I + 1 indeterminates 
di, d2, ..., 
di-^i 
are identified 
with ci, C2, ..., 
ci^u. 
Proof. Assume without loss of generality that F is monic in Cy. Every element 
of the algebraic field can be written in exactly one way in the form Yl,i=i Vii^i^ 
C2, . . . , Ci^_i)c^~% where N is the degree of F in Cj^ and the rji{ci, C2, . . . , 
Cj^-i) are rational functions in the first v — 1 indeterminates. When the 
N-\-l 
elements l^u^v?., . . . , u^ of the field are written in this form, one can construct 
a linear dependence of these elements of the field over the field of rational 
functions in ci, C2, . . . , c^-i, and from this one can construct a polynomial in 
u indeterminates with integer coefficients in which substitution of ci, C2, . . . , 
Cjy_i, 16, regarded as elements of the given root field, results in zero. One of the 
irreducible factors of this polynomial, call it G, must have the same property. 
This G is determined, up to sign, by u. Since Ci, C2, . . . , c^, li are algebraically 
independent if and only if at least one of the indeterminates Q+i, Q+2? • • •, 
Cy-i occurs in G, what is to be shown is that when this is the case, the given 
algebraic field can be described as stated in the proposition. 
Suppose Ch occurs in G for some h> I. Assume without loss of generality 
that h — u — 1. The field of quotients of Z[ii, ci, C2, . . . , Cy-i] mod G is an 
algebraic field that can be identified with a subfield of the given algebraic 
field. It can also be described as the field obtained by adjoining Cy-i to the 
field of rational functions in li, ci, C2, . . . , Cy-2' Since the given algebraic 
field can then be obtained by adjoining Cy to this field, the desired conclusion 
follows from the theorem of the primitive element, which implies that the 
given algebraic field, which can be obtained by two successive adjunctions to 
the field of rational functions in tx, ci, C2, . . . , Cy-2-> can be obtained by a 
single adjunction. 
Thus, given k algebraically independent elements of an algebraic field, one 
can successively alter the presentation of the field so that the first k indeter-
minates of the polynomial that describes it represent these k field elements. 
In particular, because the v indeterminates of a defining relation do satisfy 
an algebraic relation, k 
<u. 
In conclusion, every algebraic field has a well-defined transcendence degree, 
and an algebraic field of transcendence degree u is one that can be presented 
as the root field of an irreducible polynomial g with coefficients* in Z[ci, C2, 
. . . , Cyj^i] that is monic in Cyj^i. An algebraic number field is an algebraic 
field of transcendence degree zero. 
* The coefficient ring Z[ci, C2, .. •, c,y] may include indeterminates that do not occur 
in g. For example, g{ci) — c\ -\-2 can be regarded as having coefficients in Z[ci] 
or in Z[ci, C2]. In the first case its root field is Q ( \ / ^ ) , which has transcendence 
degree 0; in the second, its root field is the field of rational functions in C2 with 
coefficients in Q(\/—2) which has transcendence degree 1.

Galois, 
[27] (English translation, [18, p. 101]) 
Loosely speaking, the assertion of the preceding essay states that any alge-
braic computation can be regarded as taking place inside the root field of 
some polynomial. Since the theorem of Part 1 implies that every such field 
is a subfield of a Galois field—the root field of a Galois polynomial—every 
algebraic computation 
can be regarded as taking place inside a Galois field. 
For example, the factorization of f{x) mod g{y), where / and g are monic 
and irreducible, can be described, now that the theorem of Part 1 and Galois's 
fundamental theorem have been proved, in the following way: In a Galois field 
in which fg splits, adjoin to* K a root 6 of ^ to obtain a subfield K{b) of the 
Galois field that contains a root of ^. The factorization problem is to determine 
the irreducible factors of / when elements ofK{b) 
are permitted as coefficients. 
Over the Galois field, f{x) 
is a product of linear factors, say f{x) 
= fK^ ~" 
Oi). Because f{x) 
is irreducible, it is relatively prime to its derivative, which 
implies that the roots a^ of f{x) are distinct. The automorphisms of the Galois 
field that leave b unmoved partition these roots into orbits, two roots being in 
the same orbit if and only if there is an automorphism that carries one to the 
other without moving b. Thus, f{x) 
= Yl (f^ji^)^ where the factors (l)j{x) on the 
right are the products of the factors x — ai over all roots ai in one orbit. Each 
factor (t)j [x) of f{x) found in this way is unchanged by the automorphisms that 
leave b fixed—such automorphisms merely permute the factors of 0j(x)—so 
by Galois's theorem each 0j(x) can be expressed in the form (j)j{x,b)^ where 
0j is a polynomial in two indeterminates with coefficients in K that is monic 
in X. Each (f)j{x,b) is irreducible over K{b)^ because any monic factor other 
than 1 over K{b) must be divisible by at least one of the monic factors x — ai 
of 0j(x, b) over K and therefore must, by the definition of 0j(x, 6), be divisible 
by all such factors, which implies that it is divisible by (j)j{x^b) (because its 
linear factors are distinct). In conclusion, f{x) 
— O^jC^'^) ^^ ^^^ unique 
factorization of f{x) 
into monic factors irreducible over K{\)). 
Similarly, the factorization T{z^ t, u) — W{z — ait — bjU)., where the product 
is over all vnn pairs (a^, bj) in which ai is a root of / and bj is a root of ^ in a 
splitting field for fg (see Essay 1.9), implies that the factorization of T into 
factors irreducible over R is obtained by grouping^ together factors z—ait—bjU 
that are in the same orbit under the action of the Galois group. The Galois 
* As before, K is the field of quotients of the ring i^ = Z[ci, C2, ..., Ci/] in which / 
and g have their coefficients. 
^ Here the notion of "grouping" is very close to Galois's original use of the word 
"group" in a similar context.

group acts transitively on the bj (because g is irreducible), and the a^ for which 
z — ait — bjU are in a given orbit for any one bj are, as was just shown, the roots 
Gi of one of the irreducible factors (/)fc(a:, bj) of f{x) when bj is adjoined. From 
this it follows that the factorization f{x) = Yl(j)k{x^y) mod g{y) implies that 
the factorization ^(2:, t^u) = Yl ^k{z^ t, u) of J^ into factors irreducible over R 
is found by defining the factors Tk{z, t, u) to be Y\{z — a^t — bju), where, for a 
given /c, the product is over all roots bj of g and, for each 6j, over all roots a^ of 
/ for which (l)k{cii, bj) = 0. Thus, the degree of ^^ is /i/gn, where /ik = deg^, 0^. 
Moreover, J^k{x + uy^ l,w) = Y\{{x — ai) -f u{y — bj)) when the product is 
over all /i^n pairs (a^, bj) for which (/)k{cii^ bj) = 0. When Tkix + uy, l,u) is 
expanded as a polynomial in u whose coefficients are polynomials in x and y 
with coefficients in R, the terms of degree greater than fikU — n m. u are zero 
mod g{y)^ because, as is clear from the product representation, it is a sum of 
terms, each of which contains all n factors y — bj of g{y). (The portion x — ai 
of fewer than n factors is used in forming the term, so all distinct portions 
u{y — bj) are used at least once.) By the same token, the coefficient '0fc(x,y) 
of u^k(n-i) ^^ J^j^[x -h uy^ 1, u) (in the notation of Essay 1.5) contains only n 
terms that are nonzero mod g{y); explicitly, 
^k{x,^) = XI^^'^^'^^'^ ( _/, )

Therefore, ^l^ki^^y) has degree jj^k in x and its leading coefficient is

(The first step follows from / _^.)( _ij ) = 0 mod g{y) when j 7^ /c, and the sec-

g^{y) when y = 6^-.) Similarly, JF(x + uy, 1, li) = f{x)g'{y)^u'^^^~^^

Galois theory can be used to describe computations in a subfield K{ai^

polynomials x — Sai over all distinct images Sai oi ai under the Galois group 
is a monic polynomial in x with coefficients in K that is irreducible over K 
by the argument above. Call it fi{x). 
Then fi{ai)

that can be used to replace any element of the Galois field expressed as a 
polynomial in a i with coefficients in K^ say '0(Q;I), by another expression of 
the same element of the same form in which the degree of the polynomial 
is less than /xi; one has only to divide ip{ai) by / i ( a i ) regarded as a monic 
polynomial with coefficients in K to find '0(Q;I) = 9(Q^I)/I(Q^I) + r(o^i) and 
then to note that '?/^(Q;I) = r{ai) 
as elements of the Galois field.* In this way, 
the relation fi{ai) 
= 0 can be used to find the unique representation 
of any 
element 
of K{ai) 
as a polynomial 
in a i with coefficients 
in K of degree less 
than 111. Similarly, if /i2 is the number of distinct images of 0^2 under the 
elements of the Galois group that leave a i unmoved, the product of the /X2 
distinct linear polynomials of the form x — Sa2, where Sa2 is the image of 0^2 
under an element S of the Galois group that leaves ai unmoved, is a monic 
polynomial f2{oLi^x) of degree 112 with coefficients in the field K[ai) 
that is 
irreducible over this field and that satisfies /2(0^1,0^2) = 0- Using the relation 
/2(ai, 0^2) = 0 one can (division with remainder by a monic polynomial) find, 
for any polynomial in a i and a2 with coefficients in K, another polynomial 
representing the same element of K{ai.,a2) 
whose degree in a2 is less than 
Ii2' By the irreducibility of /2, the only way that a polynomial in ai and a2 
of degree less than 112 in a2 can be zero is for the coefficient of each power of 
a2 to be zero. Division by /I(Q;I) to reduce the degree in ai does not increase 
the degree in 0^2 and proves that each element of K{ai^a2) 
is represented 
by 
one and only one polynomial 
in Q;I and (X2 with coefficients 
in K whose degree 
in ai is less than /ii and whose degree in 0^2 is less than /i2- Continuation of 
this process leads to the following description of the Galois field: 
Proposition. 
Given elements 
a\, a2, .. -, otn of a Galois field K[y] mod 
g{y), 
and given an element f3 of this Galois field that is unmoved 
by the ele-
ments of the Galois group that leave all of a\, a2, .. -, otn unmoved, 
express (3 
as a polynomial 
in ai, 
0L2, • -, OLn with coefficients 
K whose degree in ai for 
each i is less than the number of distinct 
images of ai under elements 
of the 
Galois group that leave all of ai, a2, • • •, oii-i unmoved. 
This polynomial 
is 
determined 
by (3. It will be called the representation 
in canonical form of (3 
as an element of the sub field K{ai, 
a2, . •., otn) of the Galois field generated 
by a\, a2, • •., 01^ over K. 
Computations in K{a\., a2, . . . , 01^) can be done by dealing with polyno-
mials in canonical form; addition is the usual addition of polynomials, while 
multiplication is the usual multiplication of polynomials followed 
by reduc-
tion to canonical form. The reduction of a polynomial to canonical form uses 
n relations fi{ai) 
= 0, / 2 ( Q ^ I , « 2 ) = 0, . . . , /n(a;i, 0^2, . . . , a^) = 0 that 
will be called adjunction relations. The relation fi = 0 can be described 
either as af' = (j)i{ai^ a2, ..., 
cxi), where (piiai^ a2, • • • ? <^i) is the expression 
of af' in canonical form, or as the statement that x = a^ is a root of the

polynomial IK^ ~" '^^i)^ where the product is over all distinct images of ai 
under elements S of the Galois group that leave ai, a2, ..., o^i-i fixed and 
where the coefficients of this polynomial are written in canonical form. The 
adjunction relations are naturally used in reverse order—that is, /n = 0 is 
used to reduce the degree in a^, then fn-i = 0 is used to reduce the degree 
in a^-i without increasing the degree in a^, then fn-2 = 0 is used to reduce 
the degree in an-2 without increasing the degree in either a^ or Qn-i? and 
so forth, to end with a polynomial in canonical form. 
The theorem of the primitive element (Essay 2.1) implies, of course, that 
the field K{ai, 
a2, ..., c^n) described in this way can be described by a 
single adjunction K{(3) with a single adjunction relation f{P) = 0. However, 
a construction of a field by a number of simple adjunctions may be preferable 
to a single adjunction, because it may describe the field more simply. For 
example, the classical question of whether a given equation can be solved by 
radicals simply asks whether a splitting field for a given a polynomial f{x) 
can be described by adjunction relations of the special form af' = 0i(ai, 0:2, 
..., ai-i) in which the right side does not involve ai. 
Example 1. The splitting field of /(x) = x^ — x'^ — 1. This polynomial is 
irreducible over Z, because a factorization would have the form (x^ + Ax + 
l)(x2 + 5 x - 1), and ^ + 5 = 0, - 1 + AB + 1 = - 1 , and - ^ + 5 = 0 would 
all hold. The factorization of f{x) mod f{y) can be found by the elementary 
calculation x^ 
{x - y){x ^ y){x'^ 
of f{x) to Q gives f{x) either 2 or 4 roots, depending on whether x^ + a^ — 1 
splits over Q(a). 
If one assumes that f{x) is not a Galois polynomial—which is to say that 
x^ + i/^ — 1 is irreducible mod y^ — y'^ — 1—this factorization of f{x) mod f{y) 
implies that the adjunction relations 
a^ = a^ + 1, 
b = —a, 
2 
1 
2 
c = 1 - a , 
d = —c, 
describe the splitting field. 
These relations show that the permutation (ab) is in the Galois group, 
because they easily imply the relations b^ = 6"^ + 1, a = —6, c^ = 1 — 6^, 
d = —c that result when a and b are interchanged and c and d are unmoved. 
Similarly, the four-cycle (acbd) is in the Galois group because the adjunction 
relations also imply all the relations c^ = c^ + 1, (i = —c, 6^ = 1 — c^, a = —6 
obtained when the roots of f{x) in the splitting field are permuted in this way. 
These two permutations generate a group of 8 motions (a dihedral group). 
Since the field described by the adjunction relations obviously has degree 8 
over Q, these 8 motions account for the entire Galois group.

As for the proof that f{x) is not a Galois polynomial—which comes down 
to the statement that 1 — a^ is not a square in the field Q(a) obtained by 
adjoining a root of a^ — a^ — 1 to the rationals—the means to do it are given 
by the algorithms of Part 1, but the computations they require are not easily 
done with pencil and paper. As is shown in Essay 1.6, x'^ -\-y^ — 1 is irreducible 
mod y^ — y'^ — 1 \i and only if the determinant of {zl/^ — UGY -\- G^ — I4 is 
irreducible in Z[z,u\, where G is the 4 x 4 matrix whose first 3 rows are the 
last 3 rows of I4 and whose last row is 1, 0, 1, 0. This determinant, call it 
JS(^, 1, u), is z^ + (-2i/2 - 2)z^ -h (-u^ + 16^/2 - 1)^4 _^ ^2u^ _ i2u^ _ y2^2 _^ 
2)z^ -h {y? H- 6^^ + \\u^ + ^u^ + 1). It is irreducible because J^3(^, 1, 2) = z^ -
10z^-\-47z'^ — llOz^ + 841 is in fact irreducible. (The proof can be accomplished 
using the primitive methods of Essay 1.4, but of course a computer algebra 
package will find the answer much more quickly.) Therefore, the algorithms of 
Part 1 lead to the conclusion that ^3(^, 1,2) is a minimal splitting polynomial 
ofx^-x^-1. 
An easier method of proving that f{x) is not a Galois polynomial using 
an altogether different method is to observe that f{x) has the real root 
'1 + V5 
so that Q(a) can be embedded in the field of real numbers; relative to this 
embedding, 1 — a^ is a negative number, so it is not a square in Q(a). 
Once the adjunction relations are known, the computation of ^^3(2;, 1,2) 
can be accomplished as follows: This polynomial is the polynomial of which 
aH-2c and its conjugates—a set of 8 distinct elements of the splitting field—are 
the roots. Therefore, it is the product of the eight conjugates of ^ —a —2c under 
the Galois group. The product of this linear polynomial and its conjugate 
z — c — 2a under {ac){bd) is z'^ — 3(a -h c)z + bac + 2. The motion {ah){cd) 
carries 2^ — a — 2c to 2^ + a + 2c and 2; — c — 2a to z + c + 26 and their 
product to z^ + 3(a + c)^; + bac + 2; thus, the product of all four factors is 
z^-f-(10ac+4-9(a+c)2)z2_^(^5^^_l_2)2 = ^4_(^5^3^)^2_2i_^20i, where use is 
made of the identity a^(? = a^(l — a^) — —a'^-^a^ = —1 to write i for ac. Since 
{ah) carries i to — i, the product of all 8 conjugates is therefore the norm of 
z"^ - (5 + 8i)z2 - 2 1 + 20i, which is the polynomial z^ - 10z^+47z^ -110^^ + 841 
found above. 
The explicit factorization oix^ — x'^ — 1 in the field Q\z\ mod {z^ — lOz^ -f 
4:1 z^ — 1102:^ + 841) can be found using a method described by Galois (see [18,

(a^ — 1)X -\- {a^ — a)^ a polynomial relation between a and t = a + 2c is given

As the preceding essay explains, a natural way in which to describe the 
splitting field of a polynomial is to give the relations that tell how to adjoin 
each new root to the field obtained by adjoining the roots that precede it. 
Given the splitting field of any polynomial / ( x ) , one can write 
(1) 
{x - ai){x - ai^i) 
---{x-an)^ {x - ai){x 
- a2) " ' {x - 
ai-i)' 
where Q;I, 0^2, • • •, c^n are the roots of f{x) 
in the splitting field, arranged in 
some order. The right side can be regarded as specifying a monic polynomial of 
degree n — i-\-l with coefficients in the field obtained by adjoining a i , 0^2, . . . , 
a^_i, namely, the polynomial that results from simple division of the monic 
polynomial in the numerator by the monic polynomial in the denominator, 
because the numerator does not involve any a's at all, and the denominator 
involves just o^i, 0^2, • • •, ^ i - i - As the left side shows, a^ is a root of this monic 
polynomial. Since the adjunction relation is the irreducible monic polynomial 
with coefficients in the field obtained by adjoining a i , 0^2, . . . , o^i-i of which 
ai is a root, it must be an irreducible factor of the polynomial indicated by 
the right-hand side of formula (1). The key to the theorem above is that these 
polynomials themselves are irreducible, so they are the adjunction relations 
that describe the splitting field. 
Galois, with his customary terseness, said this when he wrote (see above) 
that "In the case of algebraic equations, this group is none other than the set of 
all 1 •2-3 • • • n permutations of the n letters, because in this case the symmetric 
functions are the only ones that can be determined rationally"; the order of 
the Galois group is the product of the degrees of the adjunction relations, so 
Galois's statement that the order of the Galois group is n • (n — 1) • (n — 2) • • • 1 
implies that the polynomial in (1) is the adjunction relation at each step. How 
Galois might have justified his assertion can only be guessed. The proof that 
follows is inspired by Kronecker.* 
The adjunction relations are certain polynomials in a i , a2, • • •, c^n and 
ci, C2, . . . , Cn that are zero as elements of the splitting field of f{x) 
= 
x^ + cix^~^

constructing the splitting field as the root field of a Galois polynomial with 
coefficients in Z[ci, C2, ..., Cn] and then doing the computations sketched in 
Essay 2.3. The objective is to find them without constructing the splitting 
field. 
Let R be the ring of polynomials in 2n indeterminates ai, a2, ..., a^, ci, 
C2, ..., Cn with integer coefficients. Imagine that a splitting field of f{x) = 
x'^ + Cix^~^ + C2x'^~'^ + • • • + Cri has been constructed and that an order 
has been chosen for the roots o^i, 0^2, ..., ce^ of f{x) in the splitting field. 
Substituting a^ for a^ for i = 1, 2, ..., n while sending each Q to itself defines 
a homomorphism from R to the splitting field. The objective is to determine 
the kernel of this homomorphism, and, more generally to determine conditions 
under which two elements 0 and ip of R have the same image in the splitting 
field. The following proposition gives sufficient conditions for this to be the 
case: 
Proposition 1. 
Let ai for i = 1, 2, ..., 
n he the elementary 
symmetric 
polynomials in ai, a2, ...; On, which is to say the coefficients of x'^~^, x'^~'^, 
..., 
1, respectively, in the polynomial HlLiC^ "^ ^0- Then the elements Q 
and (—l)Vi of R have the same image in the splitting field of f{x) = x'^ -\-
cix'^~^ + C2X^~^ H 
\- Cn under any homomorphism from R to the splitting 
field constructed in the way that was just described. Consequently, elements 0 
and ipofR have the same image in the splitting field whenever their difference 
is a sum of multiples of the polynomials Ci — (—l)Vi. 
Proof Change x to —x in the definition of the elementary symmetric polyno-
mials and multiply by (—1)'^ to obtain x^ — crix^~^-h(72x^~^H 
h(—l)^cr^ = 
{x — ai){x — 02)'' • {x — On)' Under a homomorphism of R into the splitting 
field that comes from ordering the roots o^i, 0^2, • • •, otn of /(x) and sending 
Oi to ai for each i while sending each Q to itself, this polynomial is carried 
to /(x). Since f{x) = x"' + cix^~^ + C2X^~^ -^ • - • -\- Cn has this same image 
under such a homomorphism, the corresponding coefficients (—l)^cr^ and Q 
must also have the same image, as was to be shown. 
Let Ai — Ci~ {—lyai for i = 1, 2, ..., n. Then such homomorphisms send 
Ai, ^2, ..., An all to zero. Therefore, if 0 and '0 are elements of R for which 
0 ~ V^ = Z] DiAi^ where Di, 2^2, • • •, Dn are elements of R, then cj) and tp 
must have the same image under any such homomorphism, and the proof is 
complete. 
Let the statement that (j) and ip satisfy (/> — '0 = ^DiAi 
for some elements 
Di, D2, • • • 5 Dn of R be abbreviated (j) = ip mod A. Since this congruence 
relation is consistent with addition and multiplication, a ring R mod A is 
defined in this way. 
Proposition 2. 
As a polynomial with coefficients in the ring R mod A, the 
polynomial {x — ai){x — a^+i) • • • (x — a^); call it fi{x), for i = 1, 2, ..., n, is 
congruent to

in which the exponents ei, e2, • • •, ei are nonnegative integers whose sum is 
n — i—j-\-l. (In particular, (t)ij (x) is monic of degree n — i — j + l inx. When 
i = 1, it is simply x^~^.) 
Proof. To say that two elements of R[x] (polynomials in x, ai, a2, ..., a^, ci, 
C2, ..., Cn with integer coefficients) are congruent mod A means, of course, 
that their difference can be written in the form J2^=i^j^j 
where Di, D2, 
..., Dn are in R[x]. The case i = 1 of (2) follows from the observation that 
the right side minus the left side is ^2^=1 x^~^ Aj. When the formula is proved 
for one value of i, one knows in particular, because 
(x - ai)fi^i{x) - fi{x) = fi{x) - fi{ai), 
that {x — ai)fi-\-i{x) is congruent to 
{(l)i,o{x) - 02,0(^0) + (02,1 (x) - (t)i,l{ai))ci-\ 
\-{(l)i,n-i{x) - (j)i,n-i{cii))Cn-i 
mod A, say their difference is ^^=iDi,jAj, 
where the elements Z^2,i, ^2,2, 
..., Di^n of R[x] are defined in this way. Each of the n — i -\- I summands 
{(t)i,t{x)-(l)i^,{ai))c, is divisible by x-a^, as is {x-ai)fi^i{x), 
so ZlJ^i A j ^ j 
is divisible by x —a^. The quotient is ^ EijAj^ where Eij is found by striking 
from Dij all terms that are not divisible by x and dividing what is left by x. 
In particular, fi^i{x) and 
/.x

are congruent mod A (their difference is ^Ei^jAj). 
But this is the statement 
to be proved, because, (j)i^ri-i{x) being monic of degree 1 in x, the numerator 
of the last term is x — a^, while the numerators of the other terms are (x — 
ai)(j)ij^i^j{x)^ as follows easily from 
x^ -a^ = {x- a) (x^-^ -f x^-^a + • • • + a^'^) . 
Let an element of R be said to be in canonical form if its degree in a^ 
is at most n — i for each i = 1, 2, ..., n. The following proposition makes 
computations in the ring R mod A possible: 

Essay 2.4 The Splitting Field of x^ + cix^"^ + C2x''~^ + - • - + Cn 
59 
Proposition 3. 
Each element of R is congruent mod A to one and only one 
element in canonical form. 
Proof Let Ti = 0i,o(ai) + (/)z,i(a^)ci+0i,2(<^2)c2H 
\-(l)i^n-i{cii)cn-i-^Cn-i+i. 
Then Ti — a'^~'^~^^-\ hCn-i+i, where the omitted terms have degree at most 
n — i in ai, and do not contain aj for j > i or Cj for j > n — i -f 1. Moreover, 
Ti = 0 mod A (because fi{ai) = 0). 
Division of a given element 0 of i? by T^ = a^ + • • • regarded as a monic 
polynomial in a^ leaves a remainder that is congruent to (f) mod A, call it 
01, from which a^ has been eliminated. Division of 01 by T^-i = cin-i + *' • 
regarded as a monic polynomial in an-i leaves a remainder that is congruent 
to 01 = 0 mod A, call it 02, in which the degree of a^-i is at most 1 and a^ 
has not been reintroduced. Continuing in this way—on the zth step dividing 
0i_i by Tn+l_^ regarded as a monic polynomial in a^+i-z and calling the 
remainder 0^—produces a sequence 0 = 0o, 0i, 02, • • •, 0n of polynomials 
congruent to 0 mod A. Since the degree in a^ is reduced to at most n — z by 
the (n + 1 — i)th step and is not increased by any subsequent step, 0^ is in 
canonical form. Thus, every element 0 of i? is congruent mod A to an element 
0n in canonical form. 
Any element '0 of i^ is congruent mod A to an element from which the 
c's have been eliminated, because division of ip by Ti regarded as a monic 
polynomial in Cn leaves a remainder that does not contain c^, then division 
of this remainder by T2 regarded as a monic polynomial in c^-i leaves a 
remainder that contains neither c^-i nor c^, and so forth. (In other words, 
at the ith step, one substitutes c^+i-i — Ti in place of Cn-\-i-i to obtain an 
element that is unchanged mod A in which c^+i-i is no longer present and 
no c with a larger index is reintroduced.) 
When the input to the first algorithm is a polynomial in ai, a2, ..., a^ 
alone and the input to the second algorithm is a polynomial in canonical 
form, these two algorithms are inverse to one another and establish a one-to-
one correspondence between polynomials in ai, a2, ..., a^ and polynomials 
in canonical form in which corresponding polynomials are congruent mod A, 
because the first algorithm produces a sequence of equations

in which, when 0 contains none of Ci, C2, ..., c^, 0^ contains none of Q+i, 
Q+2, ..., c^ for z = 1, 2, ..., n — 1, and 0^ is in canonical form. Thus, 0^ is 
the remainder when 0^+i is divided hy Tn-i regarded as a monic polynomial 
in Q+i, as was to be shown. 
To say that a polynomial 0 in ai, a2, ..., a^ alone is congruent to zero mod 
A means that it has the form 0 = ^DjAj] 
this means that 0 = 0 because

substitution of (—1)V^ for Q in this equation leaves the left side unchanged 
and makes the right side zero. 
Thus, two elements of R in canonical form are congruent mod A if and 
only if the two polynomials in ai, a2, . . . , a^ alone to which they correspond 
are congruent mod A, which is true if and only if these two polynomials are 
equal. This shows that two elements of R in canonical form are congruent 
mod A only if they are equal and completes the proof of the proposition. 
Proof of the Theorem. 
The formula x^ -f Cix'^~^ + C2x'^~'^ + • • • + c^ = (x — 
ai){x — a2) •'' {x — an) mod A gives an explicit factorization of this polynomial 
with indeterminate coefficients into linear factors over an integral domain that 
contains Z[ci, C2, . . . , c^] as a subring. (Elements of R that do not contain ai, 
a2, ... ^ an are in canonical form, so they are congruent mod A only if they are 
equal.) Thus, the field of quotients of this integral domain is a splitting field 
of the polynomial. Since it is generated over Z[ci, C2, . . . , c^] by the roots of 
the polynomial in the ring, it is a minimal splitting field and is therefore the 
splitting field. 
Corollary 1.

Essay 2.5 A Fundamental Theorem of Divisor Theory 
In 1894, when Richard Dedekind's theory of ideals was first beginning to gain 
widespread recognition, Adolph Hurwitz published a paper [33] in which he 
proposed a new approach to the theory. Unfortunately for him, Dedekind did 
not accept his proposal as a friendly amendment. In fact, Dedekind replied [13] 
rather sharply that he too had discovered the approach Hurwitz described— 
he had even published a paper [12] on it in an out-of-the-way journal—but 
that he had firmly decided against it on philosophical grounds. 
Neither Hurwitz nor Dedekind seems to have been petty or disagreeable as 
a general rule, but both of them felt they had a vital stake in the matter. Hur-
witz replied [34] that he was not persuaded by Dedekind's philosophical objec-
tions to his proposal and that the published theorem to which Dedekind had 
referred was in fact a special case of a theorem Kronecker had published [41] 
long before Dedekind had, although Hurwitz himself had only lately learned 
of Kronecker's theorem. 
The interesting part of this story is that three eminent mathematicians— 
Kronecker, Dedekind, and Hurwitz, in that order—discovered and focused on 
this one theorem and its importance for the theory of ideals (or, as Kronecker 
termed it, the theory of divisors), yet the theorem is not widely known today 
and is rarely included in modern treatments of the theory. 
Dedekind regarded the theorem as a generalization of Gauss's lemma [28, 
Art. 42]: If the product of two monic polynomials 
with rational coefficients 
has 
integer coefficients, 
then the factors must have integer coefficients. He restated 
Gauss's lemma in the following form: If the product of two polynomials 
(not 
necessarily monic) with rational coefficients 
has integer coefficients, 
then the 
product of any coefficient 
of the first and any coefficient 
of the second is an 
integer. This statement obviously implies Gauss's lemma (1 is a coefficient 
of both polynomials in Gauss's case). The reverse implication can be proved 
fairly easily, so the two statements are essentially the same. The advantage 
of Dedekind's version is that it is true with algebraic numbers and algebraic 
integers in place of rational numbers and rational integers. Thus, Dedekind's 
theorem states that if the product of two polynomials 
whose coefficients 
are 
algebraic numbers has coefficients 
that are algebraic integers, then the product 
of any coefficient 
of the first and any coefficient 
of the second is an algebraic 
integer. 
Another way to put it is the following: Let ao, ai, . . . , Om and 6o, &i, . . . , 
bn be two sequences of algebraic numbers. There are two ways to "multiply" 
them, call them the "polynomial" way, in which the product is the sequence 
dobo^ dobi + ai6o, ao62 + ai6i + a26o, .. •, ambn of coefficients of the product 
{aox'^ + aix'^~^ 
H 
\- am){box'^ -^ bix^~^ -\ 
\-bn) of polynomials of which 
the given sequences are the coefficients, and the "pairwise" way, in which the 
product is the sequence of products a^fej, where 0 < i < m and 0 < j < n, 
arranged in some order. Each term of the polynomial product is a sum of 
terms of the pairwise product, so if all terms of the pairwise product sequence 

Essay 2.5 A Fundamental Theorem of Divisor Theory 
63 
are algebraic integers, the terms of the polynomial product sequence are too. 
Dedekind's theorem states the converse: if all terms of the polynomial product 
of two sequences of algebraic numbers are algebraic integers, then so are all 
terms of the pairwise product. 
Here an algebraic number is a "quantity" x that satisfies an equation 
x^ -\-Aix^~^ -\-' • • +^iv = 0 in which the coefficients Ai are rational numbers. 
After this definition is made, one can prove that in fact x is an algebraic 
number if the coefficients Ai are merely algebraic numbers. An algebraic 
integer is an algebraic number that satisfies such an equation in which the 
Ai are integers. Again, one can prove that in fact x is an algebraic integer if 
the Ai are merely algebraic integers. 
Dedekind's version of Gauss's lemma is then the statement that each 
term aibj of the pairwise product satisfies an equation of the form (aibj)^ + 
Ai{aibj)^~^

be chosen to be algebraic integers whenever all terms of the polynomial prod-

one can give (theoretically, at least) explicit formulas in which the A's are 
expressed as polynomials with integer coefficients in the terms of the polyno-
mial product and are therefore algebraic integers whenever the terms of the 
polynomial product are algebraic integers. Stated in this way, the theorem 
becomes a very concrete theorem of "general arithmetic":

Some Quadratic Problems 
Essay 3.1 The Problem An + B = n and 
"Hypernumbers" 
The problem that motivates the study of 'hypernumbers' in the next few 
essays comes from the prehistory of mathematics. 
In "The Measurement of the Circle," Archimedes states that Y|| < \/3 
and ^YH' > v ^ without giving any derivation. The closeness of these approx-
imations becomes clear when one compares 265"^ = 70225 to 3 • 153^ = 70227 
in the case of the first and 1351^ = 1825201 to 3 • 780^ = 1825200 in the case 
of the seco'nd to find that 265^ + 2 = 3- 153^ and 1351^ = 3 • 780^ + 1. There 
have been many attempts to guess how Archimedes might have derived these 
estimates. One can be certain that they were not found by trial and error; very 
probably, they involve some analogue of what is today called the continued 
fractions algorithm, but there is no documentary evidence on which to base 
such speculations. 
A similar problem is treated in earlier Greek mathematics. As early as 
the time of Pythagoras, Greek mathematicians are said to have derived* an 
entire sequence of approximations to \/2 in the form of "side and diagonal" 
numbers. If d is the length of the diagonal of a square and s is the length 
of its side, then (P = 25^ by the Pythagorean theorem. The followers of 
Pythagoras are thought to have discovered that there are no whole-number 
solutions (d, s) of this equation—and to have been very dismayed to learn that 
numbers, in the simplest sense, are not sufficient for the description of this 
simple geometrical construction. But their study of the problem probably 
went well beyond the impossibility of (P = 2s'^ in whole numbers to the 
following sequence of approximate solutions d^ = 2s'^ d= 1. A solution (d^, Sn) 
of (i^ = 2s^ =b 1 implies a solution (o^^+i, s^+i) of <i^+i = 2s'^_^i =F 1 via the 
formulas s^+i = dn-\-Sn and dn-\-i = s^+s^+i, as is easy for us, with our simple

algebraic notation, to verify.''' Let (o^o, ^o) = (1,1). Then dg = 2^0 — 1, and the 
formula generates the sequence (1,1), (3,2), (7,5), (17,12), (41,29), (99,70), 
(239,169), (577,408), . . . , which alternates between solutions of d^ + 1 = 2s^ 
and solutions of c/2 = 25^ + 1; that is, 1^ + 1 = 2-l2,32 - 2-22 + 1, 7^ + 1 = 2.5^ 
and so forth. In this way one derives, for example, 577^ = 2 • 408^^ + 1, which 
shows that | ^ is a very good approximation to v/2, because ( | ^ ) ^ = 2 + 4 ^ , 
but that it is a bit too large. 
Plato's reference in Theaetetus 
to the study of the irrationality of square 
roots up to vTz probably indicates that mathematicians of his time studied 
rational approximations of these other square roots as well. There are other 
indications that techniques of finding approximate solutions of y-^ = 
Ax^ 
were studied by ancient mathematicians whose works are lost. In India, Brah-
magupta, in the 7th century, stated the formula that will be studied later in 
^ The statement that d^ = 2s^ ± 1 implies d^-j-i = 2s^_j_i =F 1 can be deduced from 
the formula (2s + d)^ + d^ == 2s^ + 2(s + <i)^, which is Proposition 10 of Book 
2 of Euclid's Elements [25], except that Euclid had no algebraic symbolism and 
expressed the equation in words rather than a formula. This proposition can be 
proved algebraically by noting that both sides are equal to 4s^ + 4sd + 2d^ or 
can be deduced from a diagram consisting of two squares, one with side s and 
one with side s -\- d, resting side by side on a horizontal line with the smaller 
square on the left. Let A be the upper left vertex of the small square and let B 
be the upper right vertex of the large square. The desired identity comes from 
two ways of describing the square on the line segment AB. On the one hand, it 
is 2s^ + 2(s + G?)^, because AB is the hypotenuse of the right triangle whose third 
vertex is diagonally opposite the vertices A and B in their respective squares. On 
the other hand, it is (s + s + d)^ + d^, because AB is the hypotenuse of the right 
triangle whose third vertex is the point where the extension of the top side of the 
small square intersects the right side of the large square. Thus, d^ > 2s^ implies 
(2s + df 
< 2(s + df 
and 2(s + df - (2s + df 
= d^ - 2s^; in the same way, 
d^ < 2s^ implies (2s + df - 2(s + df = 2s^ - d^. 

Essay 3.1 The Problem AD + B = D and "Hypernumbers" 
67 
this essay, and Bhascara Acharya, in the 12th century, mentioned the spec-
tacular fact that the smallest number x for which 61x^ + 1 is a square is 
X = 226153980. Problems similar to this one are connected with the fa-
mous "cattle problem" of Archimedes [49], causing scholars to believe that 
Archimedes knew far more about such number-theoretic problems than our 
usual view of Greek mathematics as being primarily geometrical would lead 
us to expect. 
These problems will be studied in this group of essays in the form of the 
problem that will be indicated by the symbolic equation AU -h 5 = D, which 
is to say the problem "Given numbers A and 5 , find numbers x for which 
Ax'^-\-B is a square," say Ax^-^B 
= y"^. (At first glance, Archimedes' solution 
265^ + 2 = 3-153^ does not appear to be an instance of this problem, because 
A = 3 and B = 2 are on opposite sides of the equation, but if the equation 
is multiplied by 3, it becomes 3 • 265"^ H- 6 = (3 • 153)^, which is a solution 
of 3n + 6 = n. Conversely, in any solution (x, y) of 3x^ -\- ^ — y^ ^ y must be 
divisible by 3, say z = i//3, and division of 3x^ + 6 = ^z^ by 3 gives a solution 
of x^ + 2 = 3z^.) Because the solution of this problem is easy when ^4 is a 
square,* the case in which ^4 is a square will be ignored. 
Brahmagupta stated (but in words, not as an algebraic formula) the crucial 
tool that is used in the solution of AU + B = D. It is the observation^ that a 
solution of AU + ^ = D can be combined with a solution of AU + C = D to find 
a solution of ^ D + BC = U. Specifically, if Ax'^ -\- B = y'^ and Au'^ -\-C = v'^, 
then A{xv + yu)'^ + BC — {^Axu -h yv)^. It seems likely that some version of 
this remarkable fact was known was known in Greek times and that it was 
involved in the calculation of approximations to square roots. Archimedes' 
approximations to \/3 can be derived using Brahmagupta's formula in the 
following way: Combine the simple equation 3 - 1 ^ + 1 = 2^ with itself to 
obtain 3 • 4^ + 1 = 7^, then combine this new equation with 3 • 1^ + 1 ^^ 2^ to 
obtain 3 • 15^ + 1 = 26^, and so forth, to obtain the infinite sequence 
3 - 1 ^ + 1 = 2 ^ 
3.42 + 1 = 7^ 
* When A is a square, the problem is to write the given B in the form s^ — ^^ = 
(s — t)(s +1), where t is a multiple of the square root of A. Thus s — t — B\ and 
s-\-t — ^2, where B = B1B2 is one of the finite set of factorizations of B in which 
Bi < B2. Since Bi-\-B2 — 2s is even, the problem is thus to find all factorizations 
BxB2 = B, if any, in which Bx < B2, Bi = B2 mod 2, and {B2 - Bi)/2 
is a 
multiple of the square root of A. For each of them, {^^^Y 
= {^^^Y 
+ B 
is a solution, and there are no others. 
^ See [10, p. 363]. The proof, using modern algebraic notation, is a simple calcula-
tion. How Brahmagupta might have proved it without algebraic notation—or how 
he might have known it is true—is a mystery. Certainly Euclid's Proposition 10 
of Book 2 (see note above) indicates a Greek awareness of a similar phenomenon 
many centuries earlier, but there is no reason to suppose that the Greeks were 
the first.

Archimedes used. (One naturally wonders whether D + 1 = 3n is possible; 
it is not, because —1 is not a square mod 3.) 
In modern terminology, Brahmagupta's formula has become the statement 
that for expressions of the form y + xy/A, the product of the norms is the 
norm of the product. Here the norm of y -\- xy/A is by definition its product 
with its conjugate y — x\M, which is to say that it is {y + xy/A){y — xy/A) = 
^^ — Ax^. When one computes with these expressions using the normal rules of 
algebra—the Buchstabenrechnung of Essay 1.1—one finds that the conjugate 
of a product is the product of the conjugates, because 
f ^ -h xvAj 
(v-^ uvAj 
= (yv + Axu) -\- [yu + xt')vG4, 
whereas 
(y — XVA\ (V — uyA\ 
= {yv + Axu) — {yu + 
xv)vA, 

Essay 3.1 The Problem AU-\- B = U and "Hypernumbers" 
69 
so the norm of a product can be computed in either of two ways: the product 
can be expanded (y + x\/]4) (v + uy/A j = {yv -f Axu) + {yu + xv) y/A to find 
that the norm of the product is {yv-\-Axu)'^ — A{yu-\-xv)"^, or the norm of the 
product can be computed by multiplying the product ( y + xvAj 
f v -\- uy/Aj 
by its conjugate (y — xy/Aj (v — uy/Aj. 
Thus 
{yv + Axu)'^ - A{yu + xv)^ = {y'^ - Ax^){v'^ - Au^). 
With B = y'^—Ax'^ and C = v'^—Au'^, this is Brahmagupta's formula rewritten 
as {yv + Axu)'^ — A{yu + xv)'^ = BC. 
A solution of ^ n + 5 = D is an expression y + X \ / A , in which x and y 
are numbers, whose norm is B. For want of a better term, I will call such 
an expression y + x\/A a hypernumber for A, so that the problem "find all 
solutions of An + -B = D" for given numbers A and B^ with A not a square, 
becomes "find all hypernumbers for A whose norms are J5." 
More precisely, the hypernumbers for a given number A not a square can 
be described in the following way: As in Essay 1.1, a number is a term in the 
sequence 0, 1,2, 
For a given number A not a square, a hypernumber is an 
expression y -f- xy/A in which x and y are numbers and y/A is a mere symbol. 
Hypernumbers for the same A are added in the obvious way, 
(T/I + X2 vC4) + (2/2 + X2\/l) = (^1 + y2) + {xi + 
X2)VA, 
and they are multiplied using the rule f y/A J = A to obtain 
(^yi + X2^/Aj [y2 + 2:2V^j = (2/12/2 + ^^1X2) + {yiX2 + 
y2Xi)\fA. 
Otherwise stated, the hypernumbers for A are N(X) mod (X^ — A), the set 
of all polynomials in X whose coefficients are numbers, when two such poly-
nomials are considered to be equal if they are congruent mod (X^ — A). Every 
polynomial in X whose coefficients are numbers is congruent mod {X'^ — A) 
to one and only one polynomial of degree less than 2 (replace X^ with A, 
X^ with AX, X^ with A^, and so forth), and the defining relation X'^ =^ A 
justifies writing yfA in place of X. This definition of course implies the rules 
of addition and multiplication of hypernumbers just stated. 
(The assumption that A is not a square guarantees that nonzero factors can 
be canceled in the arithmetic of hypernumbers y-\-xy/A, because it guarantees 
that X'^ — A is irreducible, from which it follows that Z[X] mod {X'^ — A) is an 
integral domain; then for integers r, 5, x, y, u, v the congruence 
{s-\-rX){y-\-
xX) = (s -f rX){v 4- uX) mod (X^ - A) implies 5 + rX = 0 or y + xX = 
v + uX mod (X^ — A) and therefore implies s -\- rX = 0 or y-{- xX — v ^ uX. 
On the other hand, if A = r^ then, (r + X)r = (r + X)X mod (X^ - A) even 
though r + X ^ O a n d r ^ X mod (X^ - A).) 

70 
3 Some Quadratic Problems 
The exclusion of negative numbers is a bit inconvenient—-the norm y'^—Ax'^ 
of a hypernumber y + xy/A may not be a number in this strict sense because 
Ax'^ may be larger than 2/^, and the conjugate y — x\J~A of ^ + x\/~A will be 
a hypernumber only when x = 0—but insistence on the narrow definition 
of "number" can be maintained with very little real difficulty and gives the 
theory a pleasing economy of structure. All of the results in the first five 
essays of this section, including the law of quadratic reciprocity in Essay 3.5, 
are deduced using only the arithmetic of numbers 0, 1, 2, ... in the narrowest 
sense. 

Essay 3.2 Modules 
71 
Essay 3.2 Modules 
The notion of a module of hypernumbers that is introduced in this essay is 
used in the next essay to solve AD -\- B = D and in the following essays to 
deal with other questions in number theory. Very simply put, a module of 
hypernumbers for a given A is a list of hypernumbers for that A, written 
between square brackets to indicate that the list is to be used to define a 
congruence relation. The concept is motivated by the following reexamination 
of the Euclidean algorithm. 
Gauss's notion of what it means to say that a = b mod m—that 
is, two 
numbers a and b are congruent modulo a third number m—was generalized by 
Kronecker* as follows: Given a list of numbers mi, m2, . . . , TTT,^, two numbers 
a and b are congruent modulo [TTII, m2, •.., m^], written 
a = b mod [mi, 1712, • • •, rn/j], 
if there are numbers ii, 22, - - - ^i/j. and j i , J2, • • •, j ^ such that Ci-\-Yla=i '^^'^a = 
^ + Sa=i^Q!^^Q!- ^ module is a (nonempty, finite) list of numbers [TTII, 7722, 
. . . , 777,^] written between square brackets to indicate that they are to be used 
to define a congruence relation in this way. Two modules are equal if they 
define the same congruence relation. 
Clearly, two modules are equal if the lists of numbers they contain can 
be obtained from one another by a sequence of steps in which (1) terms are 
rearranged, or (2) a zero is omitted from the list or annexed to it, or (3) a 
term is added to or subtracted from another term. (A subtraction assumes, 
of course, that the term being subtracted is less than or equal to the term 
from which it is being subtracted.) In the case of operations of types (1) 
or (2) the assertion is obvious. In the case of an operation of type (3), it 
follows from the observations that a -f- ii(mi + 7712) + Z2^2 + ^3^3 + • • • = 
6+ji(miH-7n2)-f J2^2+J3^3H 
implies a-hiimi +(21+^2)^2^-is^sH

6+jimiH-(jiH-J2)^2+J3^3 + - • • and, conversely, a+Zi777,i+i2^2-f ^WsH

implies a+ii(?77.i+777,2)+ (^'(+^2)^2+^3^3H 
^ 
b-\-j'i{mi 
+777-2) + (^1 +^2)^2 + J3^3 + • • • when i^777,2 + J W 2 is added to both 
sides. These simple observations lead to a version of the Euclidean algorithm: 
T h e Euclidean Algorithm. 
Input: A list of numbers describing a module. 
Algorithm: 
While the list contains more than one 
number 
If the first entry is zero, drop it from the list. 
If the first entry is greater than the second entry, interchange 
the first two 
entries. 
Otherwise, 
subtract the first entry from the second. 
End 
See, for example, [44, p. 144]. Kronecker did not go to the extreme that I have of 
insisting that the multipliers all be natural numbers, so he did not need to put 
sums of multiples of m's on both sides of the equation.

3 Some Quadratic Problems 
Output: The list with one entry that remains. 
For example, [21,15,6] = [15,21,6] = [15,6,6] = [6,15,6] = [6,9,6] = 
[6,3,6] = [3,6,6] = [3,3,6] = [3,0,6] = [0,3,6] = [3,6] = [3,3] = [3,0] = 
[0,3] = [3]. 
Each step results in a new module equal to the preceding one; it either 
reduces the length of the list (the first alternative holds), or it reduces the 
sum of the entries (the third alternative), or it is followed by a step in which 
one of these two types of reduction occurs (the second alternative). Therefore, 
the algorithm eventually terminates, and reduces the module to a very simple 
form: 
Theorem 1. 
Given any module [mi, m2, - • •, m^]; there is a number n for 
which [mi, m2, ..., m^] — [n]. 
This theorem gives a canonical form for modules, because [ni] = [77,2] only 
if ni =712. (If [^1] = [^2], then each of the numbers ni and n2 is a multiple 
of the other, which implies ni = 712, because it implies that if one is zero, 
then both are, and otherwise, each is less than or equal to the other.) One 
can determine whether two given modules are equal by putting them both in 
canonical form; they are equal if and only if the canonical forms are identical. 
The number n is obviously the greatest common divisor of mi, 7712, • • •, '^n^^ 
except when the numbers m^i are all zero, in which case there is no greatest 
common divisor because all numbers are common divisors. 
Corollary. 
// two lists determine the same module, they can he transformed 
into one another by a sequence of steps of types (1), (2), and (3) described 
above. 
Deduction. One can pass from either of them to their common canonical form 
and back by a sequence of such steps, so one can pass from either of them to 
the other. 
The "Euclidean algorithm" of Essay 1.4 shows that if [7711,7712] = [^], there 
are integers (j) and if) for which (j)mi + ipm2 = 77,. Without using integers, this 
fact can be stated and generalized as follows: 
Proposition 1. 
// [777,1, ^ 2 ; •••; '^^i] = [^] o.'nd m.^ 7^ 0, then there are 
numbers ki, k2, ..., kf^ for which kirui +/c2r7i2H 
\-k^-im.^-i-\-n 
= kfj^m^. 
Proof. Because 71 = 0 mod [77,] and therefore 77, = 0 mod [777,1, ^ 2 , • • •, '^^l]l 
there are numbers zi, 22, ..., i^ and ji, J2, • • •, j/^ such that n -\-J2^a'^a 
= 
Xlia^a- What is to be shown is that there is an equation of this form in 
which ia > ia for Q; = 1, 2, ..., /i — 1. If i^ < ja for some a, one can add 
T^a'^ii to both sides by adding 772^ to i^ and 777,c, to j ^ , increasing io, without 
changing any other i and without changing any j other than j ^ . Repetition of 
this step enough times makes ice ^ ja without changing the relation between

Two numbers mi and 1712 are relatively prime if [mi, 7712] = [1]. Proposi-
tion 1 implies that if mi and m2 are relatively prime and nonzero then each is 
invertible mod the other. It also implies an important theorem of elementary 
number theory: 
The Chinese remainder theorem. 
// / > 0 and F > 0 are relatively 
prime and g and G are given numbers, the congruences x = g mod / and 
X ~ G mod F determine a number x mod fF in the sense that there is a 
solution X of the congruences and any two solutions are congruent mod fF. 
Proof By the proposition, there are numbers /ci, A:2, /i, and I2 for which 
kif + 1 = k2F and hF + 1 = hf. 
Then x = g • k2F ^ G • hf 
satisfies 
X = g-k2F = g'{kif^l) 
= g mod / and x = G-hf = G-(/iF-f 1) = G mod F, 
as required. The uniqueness of x mod fF follows from simple counting: Since 
one of the fF numbers x less than fF solves each of the fF possible problems 
X = g mod / and x = G mod F in which g < f and G < F, no two of them 
solve the same problem. 
There is a natural way to multiply modules: The product of [777,1, '^2, 
..., m^] and [ni, 77,2, • • •, nj^] is by definition the module described by a list 
[..., rrianp,...] made up of all products of one m and one 77,, arranged in some 
order. Multiplication is well defined for modules in the sense that if one list 
is replaced by another list describing the same module, then the product list 
may change, but the module it describes will not. (This statement is clear if 
the passage from one factor to an equal factor involves rearranging the list or 
omitting or annexing zeros. If the passage involves adding a term to or sub-
tracting a term from another, it is only slightly less obvious.) Multiplication 
of modules is obviously commutative and associative. 
All of the same ideas apply without change to modules of hypernumbers, 
except that there is no Euclidean algorithm in the case of hypernumbers, and 
the problem of establishing a canonical form for modules of hypernumbers is 
more challenging. 
Let a number A, not a square, be fixed throughout the discussion. A mod-
ule of hypernumbers is simply a list [mi, m2, ..., m^] of hypernumbers 
(for the given A) enclosed in square brackets. Two hypernumbers a and b 
are congruent modulo a given module, written a = fe mod [mi, 777-2, •••? 
m^], if there are hypernumbers ii, i2, . • •, i/^ and ji, J2, ..., j ^ such that 
a -\- ^ia'^a 
= b -\- YlJa'^a- 
Two modulcs are equal if they determine the 
same congruence relation. 
Again it is easy to see that two modules are equal if the lists of numbers 
they contain can be obtained from one another by a sequence of steps in which 
(1) terms are rearranged, or (2) a zero is omitted from the list or annexed to 
it, or (3) a term is added to or subtracted from another term. (A subtraction 
is of course possible only when the coefficients of the term being subtracted 
are no larger than the corresponding coefficients of the term from which it 
is being subtracted.) In the hypernumber case, there is another elementary 

74 
3 Some Quadratic Problems 
operation that does not change the module, namely, (4) \fA times a term is 
added to or subtracted from another term. 
This set of four types of transformations that change a module into an 
equal module are sufficient to establish a method for determining whether 
two given modules are equal: 
T h e o r e m 2. 
Let A he a fixed number, 
not a square. Every module of hy-
pernumbers 
for A that is not"" equal to [0] is equal to a module of the 
form 
[e/, eg + ey/A], where e, f, and g are numbers for which ef ^ 0, g < f, 
and 
g^ = A mod / . Two modules of this form are equal only if they are 
identical. 
A module [e/, eg + e^/A] in which e / 7^ 0, ^ < / , and g'^ = A mod / will 
be said to be in canonical form. 
Proof. The following elaboration of the Euclidean algorithm puts any module 
that is not equal to [0] in canonical form after a finite number of steps. 
By assumption, the list that presents the given module contains at least 
one nonzero entry, call it y + x\/~A. Because the number \y'^ — Ax'^\ can be 
annexed to the list, one can assume without loss of generality that the list that 
presents the given module contains a nonzero number. (The annexed number 
is y(7/ + X \ / A ) — x\fA{y 
+ x\fA) 
if y'^ > Ax'^ and xy/A{y + x\fA) 
— y{y + xy/A) 
if y'^ < Ax'^. Therefore, annexing it to the list does not change the module. It 
cannot be zero because A is not a square, so Ax'^ cannot be a square"^ unless 
x = 0.) 
Therefore, provided the given module is not [0], one can assume without 
loss of generality that the list representing the given module has a nonzero 
number as its first entry. Moreover, because the first entry times \/]4 can be 
annexed to the list if necessary, one can also assume without loss of generality 
that the list contains at least one hypernumber that is not a number. 
Reduction to Canonical Form 
Input: A presentation of a module in which the first entry is a nonzero num-
ber, and at least one entry is a hypernumber that is not a number. 
* The module [0] is equal only to modules of the form [0, 0,..., 0]. It is a very trivial 
sort of module—congruence mod it is simply equality—which for the most part 
will be ignored. A module in canonical form is not [0]. 
^ li y^ = Ax^ and x ^ 0, then A must be a square, as can be seen as follows: Let 
[x,y] = [d] ^ [0]. If 2/ = 0, then yl = 0 is a square. Otherwise, by Proposition 1, 
there are numbers a and jS for which ax + d = /3y, from which it follows that 
[xd] = [xd,Ax^] = [xd.y'^] = [xd,y^, f3^y^] = [xd, y^, {ax -\- df] = [xd,y^,d'^] = 
[d"^]. Thus, xd = d^,x = d, y"^ = Ad^, and {y/d^ 
= A. Or if one is willing to take 
the unique factorization of numbers as known, one can simply observe that some 
prime factor of A divides A an odd number of times, and therefore divides Ax'^ 
an odd number of times, so Ax"^ is not a square.

Algorithm: While the module is not in canonical form 
If any number in the list is preceded by an entry that is not a number, 
interchange the two. 
Otherwise, if the second entry is a number, use the Euclidean algorithm to 
replace the first two entries with their greatest common divisor. 
Otherwise, if there is a third term (in which case the first term is a number 
and the second and third terms are not numbers), make use of the first term 
to perform the Euclidean algorithm on the coefficients of y/A in the second 
and third terms. Specifically, if the coefficient of y/A in the second term is less 
than or equal to the coefficient of ^TA in the third term, add the first term to 
the third term as many times as necessary and then subtract the second term 
from the third; otherwise, interchange the second and third terms. 
Otherwise (in which case there are just two entries, the first a number and 
the second not), if the coefficient of y/A in the second entry does not divide 
the other coefficient of the second entry, annex VA times the second entry to 
the list as a third entry. 
Otherwise, if the coefficient of y/A in the second entry does not divide the 
first entry, annex y/A times the first entry to the list as a third entry. 
Otherwise (in which case the module has the form [e/, eg + ey/A] but is 
not in canonical form), subtract the first term from the second if possible. 
Otherwise, annex the difference of the numbers eA and eg^, which is the 
difference of the hypernumbers y/A{eg-\-ey/A) 
and g{eg-\-eyA), 
to the list as 
a third entry. 
End 
Output: The module in canonical form with which the algorithm terminates. 
Example. To apply the algorithm to [7+5\/3] one must first annex |7^—3-5^| — 
26. The succeeding steps are 
[26, 7 + 5\/3] = [26, 7 + 5^3,15 + 7^3] = [26,7 + 5^3,8 + 2^3] 
= [26,8 + 2\/3,7 -h 5v^] = [26,8 + 2\/3,25 + 3\/3] 
= [26,8 + 2V^, 17 + 73] - [26,17 + v^, 8 + 2^3] 
= [26,17 + x/3,17 + v^] - [26,17 + \/3,0] 
= [26,0,17 + \/3] = [26,17 + V^]. 
The final module is in canonical form because 1 divides both 17 and 26, 17 is 
less than 26, and 17^ = 3 mod 26. 
This algorithm terminates for the following reasons: 
By assumption, the input list contains both a number and a hypernumber 
that is not a number. A step that changes a hypernumber into a number 
leaves a hypernumber in the list unchanged, and the only step that reduces 
the number of numbers in the list replaces two numbers with a single one 
(the greatest common divisor of the first two entries). Therefore, at each step 

76 
3 Some Quadratic Problems 
there is at least one number and at least one hypernumber not a number. 
They are arranged by the first step to put all numbers first, and the second 
step eventually reduces the number of numbers in the list to one. 
Steps of the first three types do not change the greatest common divisor 
of the coefficients of \/]4 that occur in entries of the list. Since they reduce the 
total of the numbers in the list or the total of the coefficients of ^Tk (except 
for the finitely many steps that rearrange terms), eventually a step beyond 
the first three must be reached. 
Each such step reduces either the greatest common divisor of the coeffi-
cients of ^/]4 or the greatest common divisor of the numbers in the list (except 
for finitely many steps that reduce the first coefficient of the second term), so 
only a finite number of them can occur before canonical form is achieved. 
Lemma. 
Let [e/, eg + e\/]4] he a module in canonical form. 
The 
congruence 
y + xy/A 
= 0 mod [e/, eg + eVA] 
is equivalent 
to the pair of 
congruences 
y = gx mod ef and x = 0 mod e. 
Proof 
Because 
efVJ 
+ efg = f [eg + 
e^/A^ 
and 
vA {eg + evAj 
= g ieg ^ evA\ 
mod e/, 
an equation of the form 
y + x \ ^ + iief 
+ i2 (eg + e\fA\ 
= y' + x'\fA 
+ jief 
+ J2 Ug + e\/~A\ 
in which zi, 22, j i , J2 are hypernumbers 
implies another equation of the same 
form in which ii, 22, j i , J2 are numbers. (For example, if zi = a+/5\/]4, one can 
add I3efg to both sides and replace l3\fAef-]-f3efg 
with f]f{eg-\-ey/A) 
to obtain 
another equation of the same form in which ii is a, 22 is increased by /3/, and ji 
is increased by Pg. If ^2 = Q^ + /3V^, one can use the fact that y/A{eg + 
e\/^)-\-
7 e / = g{eg + ey/A) + Sef for suitable 7 and S to add P'yef to both sides and 
replace f3y/A{eg + e^/A) + P^ef 
with f3g{eg + ey/A) -f- pSef to obtain another 
equation of the same form in which Z2 is a -\- Pg, while pS is added to ii and 
P^ is added to j i , and so forth.) Therefore, y -h xy/A = 0 mod [e/, eg + ey/A] 
if and only if y -\- x \ ^ -\- iief -\- i2{eg -\- ey/A) = jief-\-J2{eg-\-e\/^) 
for some 
numbers ii, 22, j i , J2- Comparison of the coefficients of VA shows not only 
that X = 0 mod e but also that x -\- i2e = J2e; then comparison of the other 
terms shows that y-\-iief-{-i2eg 
= jief-\-J2eg 
= jief-\-{x-\-i2e)g 
and therefore 
that y = gx mod ef. Conversely, if x -h ie = je and y + kef 
= gx -\- lef for 
numbers z, j , A:, /, then y-\-xy/A-\-kef-hi{eg-\-ey/A) 
= gx-\-lef -{-jey/A-\-ieg 
= 
gje + lef + je\/A 
= j{eg + ey/A) + lef, so 2/ + xy/A = 0 mod [ef, eg + e\/\A].

Completion of the Proof of Theorem 2. Thus, if [e/, eg -f eVA] = [e' f, e'g' + 
e'y/A\^ then e'^f' + e'^/A = 0 mod [e/, eg + e\/]4], which imphes in particular 
that e' = 0 mod e. By symmetry, e = 0 mod e', so e = e^ Then e' f 
= 
^ • 0 mod ef implies f' = 0 mod /, and f — f follows as before by symmetry. 
Finally, eg' + e\fA = 0 mod [e/, eg + ev^] implies eg' = ge mod e/, which is 
to say g' = g mod /. Since both g and ^' are less than f = f ^ 9 = 9' fohows. 
Corollary. 
// two modules are equal, each can be transformed into the other 
by a sequence of steps of types 
(l)-(4)' 
Deduction. Such steps suffice to transform a module into its canonical form 
and vice versa. 
The product of two modules of hypernumbers can be defined, exactly as 
in the case of modules of numbers, to be the module described by the list 
containing all products in which one factor is from a list describing the first 
module and the other factor is from a list describing the second. Products are 
easily shown to be well defined for modules; that is, if a factor is replaced by 
an equal module, the new product is equal to the old one. 
The product operation defined in this way is commutative and associative, 
which is to say that it makes the set of modules of hypernumbers for a given 
A into a commutative semigroup. In this semigroup, [1] is an identity. 
The "modules" described here are closely related to Dedekind's "ideals" in 
the ring Z[\/]4], but the underlying attitude is opposite to Dedekind's. His goal 
was to divorce the theory as much as possible from algorithmic techniques, 
and he felt that he had achieved his goal by considering the infinite set of all 
ring elements that are zero mod [e/, eg-\-e^/A] to be a mathematical entity. To 
me, it borders on the absurd to believe that a mathematical idea is made "con-
crete" [23, Remark 21, p. 60] by describing it as an infinite set whose elements 
are themselves abstractions. Modules of hypernumbers for a given A are made 
concrete by specifying how they are to be described (as finite, nonempty lists 
of hypernumbers between square brackets) and how to compute with them 
(they are multiplied by the familiar rule, and one determines whether two 
given modules are equal by reducing them both to canonical form). 
Examples. When A — 3^ some modules in canonical form are [2,1 + ^3], 
[3, A/S] , [11,5 + Vs], [ll, 6 + \/3]. Some products of such modules are 
2,1 + Vsl [2,1 + V^j = [4, 2(1 + V3), 4 + 2\/3] = [2] [2,1 + A/3, 2 + A/S 
= [2] [2,1 + ^/3,1]= [2],

two reduced forms with the same determinant that belong to different pe-
riods can be equivalent.)—P. G. Lejeune Dirichlet [16, §80] 
Again let ^ be a fixed number, not a square. As was seen in the previous essay, 
the modules of hypernumbers for A form a commutative 
semigroup 
under 
multiplication, or, to put it more simply, the operation of multiplication of 
modules is commutative and associative. Computations in the semigroup of 
modules will be used in this essay to solve An -\- B = D. A key role will be 
played by the following notion of equivalence of modules. 
A module will be called principal* if it can be expressed in the form 
[?/ + x\/]4] for some hypernumber y-\-xy/A 
that satisfies y'^ > Ax^. The princi-
pal modules form a subsemigroup—in other words, a product of principal mod-
ules is principal—by virtue of Brahmagupta's formula {y'^ — Ax^){v'^ — Au^) 
= 
{yv + Axu)^ 
— A{yu + xv)'^, because this formula shows that the product 
[{y + x\^){v 
+ US/A)] 
= [{yv + Axu) 
+ {yu -f xv)y/A] 
of [y -\- X^/A] 
and 
[^; + 'U\/A] satisfies {yv-{-Axu)^ 
> A{yu-\-xv)'^ 
when y'^ > Ax'^ and v'^ > Av?. 
Two modules Mi and M2 will be called equivalent, written Mi ~ M2, if 
there are principal modules Pi and P2 for which Mi Pi = M2P2. This is 
an equivalence relation (transitivity follows from the fact that a product of 
principal modules is principal, because Mi Pi = M2P2 and M2P1 = M3P2 im-
ply MiPiP{ = M2P2P1 = M3P2P2) that is consistent with multiplication of 
modules (Mi ~ M2 implies M1M3 ^ M2M3 for any module M3). The class 
semigroup is simply the set of equivalence classes, multiplied by multiplying 
representatives. Otherwise stated, the class semigroup is the quotient 
semi-
group of the semigroup of modules relative to the subsemigroup of principal 
modules. 
Computations in the class semigroup depend on solving the problem of 
determining 
whether two given modules are equivalent; this problem, which I 
will call the equivalence problem, is solved by the theorem of this essay. It is 
the main step in the solution of AU -h P = •• 
The equivalence problem cannot be solved by giving a canonical form that 
picks one representative out of each equivalence class, because there is no 
natural canonical form for this particular equivalence relation. Instead, the 
solution of the equivalence problem will follow a procedure like the one Gauss 
used in Section 5 of Disquisitiones 
Arithmeticae 
to determine whether two 
given binary quadratic forms are equivalent; it consists of two parts, the first 
establishing that every module is equivalent to one in a certain finite set of 
* This term derives from the fact that the module is in the principal class of the 
class group. It has always seemed to me peculiar to apply the adjective "principal" 
to the module itself, but the usage is universal among mathematicians.

stable^ modules, and the second giving a method of determining whether two 
stable modules are equivalent. Specifically, an algorithm—the "comparison 
algorithm"—will be given for generating a sequence of modules equivalent to 
a given one. A sequence of equivalent modules generated by the comparison 
algorithm eventually begins to cycle, as will be shown; a module will be called 
stable if the sequence of modules obtained by applying the comparison algo-
rithm to it cycles back to this module itself. The equivalence problem will be 
solved by showing that the obvious sufficient condition for the equivalence of 
two modules—namely, that apphcation of the comparison algorithm to them 
leads to the same cycle of stable modules—is also necessary. Thus, the an-
swer to Dirichlet's "most difficult question" is no: Reduced forms in different 
periods are not equivalent, or, in the present formulation, stable modules in 
different cycles are not equivalent. 
By the definition of equivalence, a module [e] [/, g -h \^4] in canonical form 
is equivalent to [f,g-\-^/A]. 
Therefore, in solving the equivalence problem one 
can assume without loss of generality that the given modules in canonical 
form have e = 1. 
^ I have avoided Gauss's term "reduced" because it conflicts with my term "reduc-
tion algorithm," an algorithm for reducing a coefficient of VA, not for reducing 
the module.

Comparison Algorithm. 
Input: A module [f,g + \/A] in canonical form with e = 1. 
Algorithm: Let r be the smallest solution ofr-\-g = 0 mod / for which r^ > A. 
Let A ^ (r2 - 
A)lf. 
Let gi be the smallest solution of gi = r mod /i. 
Output: A module [fi,gi-\-VA] 
in canonical form with e — 1 and an equation 
[r + \/A] [/, g -\- y/A] = [/] [/i, gi + ^/A] showing that it is equivalent to the 
input module. 
That the definition of/i makes sense—that is, that r'^ = A mod /—follows 
from r = —g mod / and the fact that ^ is a square root of A mod /. That gi 
is a square root of A mod /i follows from r = gi mod /i and r'^ — A = ffi. Of 
course gi < fi, because gi is the smallest number in its class mod /i. Finally, 
when q is defined hy qf = r -{- g one obtains the output equation 
[r + VI] [/, ^ + /A] = [/(r + yZ), r^ + A + (r + g) VI]

Let the output [/i, gi -h \/I] of the comparison algorithm be called the 
immediate successor of the input [/, g + A/I] , and let the successors of 
[/, g+y/A] be the modules in the sequence generated by repeated application of 
the comparison algorithm. Not only is each successor of [/, g + y/A] equivalent 
to [/, g -j- \ / I ] , but the algorithm gives an explicit equivalence

[fi,gi^y/A]. 
Theorem. 
Let [/, g + \/I] and [F, G -\- \/A] be modules in canonical form

between [/, g + \/I] and [F, G -h \/I] ^^ the sense that any equivalence \Y +

where k is a number for which [F, G + VA] is the kth successor of [/, g + y/A]. 
In particular, there are no equivalences when [F, G + y/A] is not a successor 
of[f,g + VA].

Proposition 1. 
The number of stable modules is finite, and every module 
has a stable successor. 
Proof As above, let [fi.gi + ^/A] be the ith successor of the given module, and 
let r^ be the number used in passing from [/j_i,^^_i + \/A] to [fi.gi + \/A]. 
In other words, let r^ be the least solution of r^ + ^^_i = 0 mod fi-i whose 
square is greater than A. It will be shown that if \ri — / i - i p > A, then 
| r ^ - / ^ - l p > |r,+i - fi\'^. 
Note ffist that \ri — / i - i p < ^ if and only if \ri — /^p < A, because 
both are equivalent to fi-i -\- fi < 2ri, as one sees when one writes them as 
rf + ff_i < 2rifi-i 
-i- A and rf -\- ff < 2rifi -\- A, respectively, subtracts A 
from both sides, and uses rf — A = fi-ifi 
to obtain fi-ifi 
+ f^_i < 2r^/i_i 
and fi-ifi 
+ ff < 2rifi^ respectively. In the same way, the three inequalities 
\ri - / i - i p > A, \ri - Zip > A, and fi-i -\- fi > 2ri all imply one another. 
Also, on successive steps, the inequality r^ + r^+i > 2fi holds, as can be 
seen as follows: Because r^-hri-t-i = gi-\-ri-^i = 0 mod fi, it will suffice to prove 
that ri -\- r^+i > fi. This is true if ri > fi. It is also true if r^ < /z_i, because 
then rf > rf - A ^ fifi-i 
> fin, so r^ > fi. Otherwise, /^_i < r^ < fi, 
in which case (r^ — fi-iY 
< -A by the definition of r^ {A is not a square, 
so {ri — fi-iY 
7^ A), which implies |r^ — fi\^ < A, as was just seen. Thus, 
{fi — ^i)'^ < f^i-\-i and fi — ri < r^+i in this case as well. 
Suppose now that |r^ — fi-i\^ 
> A. If fi < r^+i, the definition of r^+i 
implies |r^+i — fi\^ < A, so of course |r^ — /^-ip > |r^+i — /^p in that case. 
Otherwise, r^+i < fi, in which case the inequality of the last paragraph imphes 
that ri — fi > fi — rij^i > 0. On the other hand, the assumption |r^ —/^_ip > A 

Essay 3.3 The Class Semigroup. Solution of AD + B = D. 
83 
implies fi-i 
-\- fi > 2ri, as was seen above. Therefore /^_i —ri > ri — fi^ which 
combines with the previous inequality to give fi-i 
— Vi > fi — r^+i > 0, from 
which the desired inequality |r^ — / ^ - i p > |^i+i — /zP follows. 
Therefore |r^ — / i _ i p decreases as long as it is greater than A, so a step 
must be reached at which |r^ — / i - i p < A. That the same inequality holds on 
all subsequent steps—which is to say that Ir^ —/^_i p < A implies |r^+i —/^P < 
A—can be proved as follows: 
If |r^—/^_ip < A, then |r^—/^p < A, as was seen. If |r^+i—/^p were greater 
than A, then fi would be greater than r^+i (r^+i is the least number in its class 
mod fi whose square is greater than A), in which case the above inequality 
n + r^+i > 2fi would imply U - fi > fi - r^+i > 0, from which \ri - /^P > 
1/^ — r^+ip > A would follow. Therefore, 1/^ — r^+ip must be less than A. 
Thus, the sequence of successors of any module eventually reaches a mod-
ule [/, g-\-\^] 
in canonical form for which |r — / p < A, where r is the least so-
lution of r + ^ = 0 mod / for which r^ > A. Let M. denote the set of such mod-
ules. The set A4 is finite, as one sees when one sets (p = |^ — / | and notes that 
then (f)^ < A and (j) = =br = =b^ mod / , so / divides A — (j)"^. In particular, / < 
A. Since canonical form requires that g be less than / , A1 is therefore finite. 
The comparison algorithm defines a function from A4 to itself, as was 
shown above. Since it carries [/,^ + y/A] in A^ to a module [fi,gi 
+ VA] for 
which |r — / i p < A, / i and gi determine r as the least number in the class of 
gi mod / i whose square is greater than A. (If gf > A, then r = gi; otherwise, 
r = gi + / i / i for /i > 0.) Therefore, [fi^gi -\- VA] determines r and determines 
[/, ^ -h y/A] by the rules f = {r"^ — A)/fi 
and g = —r mod / . In short, the 
function from A4 to itself defined by the comparison algorithm is one-to-one. 
Therefore, the comparison algorithm permutes the finite set A^, which im-
plies that every module in M. is stable—application 
of the comparison algo-
rithm to it cycles back to this module itself—and the proof of the proposition 
is complete. Moreover, it has been shown that the stable modules are precisely 
those in Ai. (It is not difficult to show that these are the modules [/, g -\- VA] 
in canonical form in which / divides a number of the form A — 0^ and the 
square root g oi A mod / satisfies either g'^ < A o r {f — gY < A.) 
See the table at the end of the essay for a list of the stable modules for a few 
values of A and the cycles into which they are partitioned by the comparison 
algorithm. 
The first step in finding all equivalences between [/, g + A/A] and [F, G + 
\ / A ] , where [F,G + ^/A\ is stable, will be to find all equivalences of the special 
form[^-hxV^][/,^ + \/]4] = [n][F,G^VA] 
in which ^-ha;A/I = 0 mod [F,G4-
\fA\. 
The solution of this problem will use the following algorithm:

and [F, G -h \/~A\ are in canonical form, 
and y + x\fA

Define yi -h Xl^/A

Define Fi to be {p^ — A)/F 
and Gi to be the least solution 
of p -\- Gi = 
O m o d F i . 
Output: A new equation [yi + xi\fA\[f^g

Xi < X, which can be used as a new input equation—that is, [-Fi, Gi + \/A\ is 
in canonical form, yi > Ax\^ and y\ + xi\fA 
= 0 mod [Fi, Gi -h \/^]—unless 
xi = 0 . 
Justification. 
By the choice of p, px > y and p = G mod F , so the definition 
of xi as {px — y)/F 
is valid by virtue of ^ = Gx = px mod F (because 
y + x\fA 
= 0 mod [F, G + V^])- Moreover, Fxi 
= px — y < Fx because 
px — y > Fx would imply p> F and (p — F)x > ?/, contrary to the definition 
of p. Thus, xi < X. Since p'^x'^ > y^ > Ax'^ implies p^ > A (because x > 0), 
it follows that [pyY — f? - y^ > A- Ax^ — (Ax)^ and py > Ax; at the same 
time, py = Gy = G^x = Ax mod F , which shows that the definition of yi 
as {py — Ax)/F 
is valid. That yf > Ax\ follows from (p^ - A){y'^ - Ax'^) > 
0 when one rewrites this inequality first as p^y^ -\- A?x^ 
> Ax'^p^ -\- Ay^ ^ 
then as {py — Ax)"^ > A{xp — yY^ and divides by F^. Since p^ = G^ = 
A mod F , the definition of Fi as (p^ - A)/F 
is valid and Fi > 0. Also, 
Gl = {-pf 
= p'^ = A mod Fi by virtue of p^ - yl = F F i , so [Fi,Gi + 
\AA] is in canonical form. When q is defined by p + Gi = g'Fi, one deduces 
[Fi][F,G + V3] = [Fi][F,p + ^] 
= [(p - y/A){p + ^ ) , F i ( p + v ^ ) ] = 
[ ( g F i - G i - A / Z ) ( p + x / I ) , F i ( p + v ^ ) ] = [ ( g F i - G i - y Z ) ( p + x / I ) , F i ( p + 
\/]4), gFi(p + VA) - {qFi - Gl - V^)(p + V^)] (the third entry is q times 
the second minus the first) = [{qFi - Gi - V ^ ) ( p + \/]4), Fi(p -h \ / A ) , ( G I + 
^ ) ( p + v^)] = [Fi(p + ^ ) , ( G i + VI)(p + V^)] = [p+^][Fi,Gi + VI]. 
Since (p + V ^ ) ( y i + X I A / A ) = (p^ - ^)(?/ + a:\/]4)/F = Fi(?/ + x\/]4) = 0 mod 
[Fi][F,G + / A ] , the equation [Fi][F,G + V^] = [ p + v ^ ] [ F i , Gi + V A ] implies 
(p + V A ) {yi-\-Xi ^/A) = 0 mod [p + \/]4] [Fi, Gi + V^] and therefore implies* 
yi+xi^/A 
= 0 mod [Fi, Gi + %/]4]. Finally, multiplication of the input equation 
by [Fi] gives [Fi][?/ + x ^ ] [ / , ^ + / A ] = [n][p + y:4][Fi,Gi + ^ ] ; multiply by 
[p—V^]—which is valid even though p—y/Ais 
not a hypernumber because the 
hypernumbers y-\-xy/A 
and p + y/A can both be multiplied by p—y/A—to 
put 
this equation in the form [Fi][F{yi + xiy/A)][f, 
g-j-^/A] 
= [n][FFi][Fi, Gi + 
^/A] 
and divide by [FFi] to conclude that the output equation holds. 
The theorem will be proved by proving that if [F, G + ^/A] is stable and 
if the reduction algorithm is applied iteratively until x is reduced to zero, 
then (1) the terminal equation is obvious from the original equation and (2) 
the steps of the algorithm can be retraced using the comparison algorithm 
* The definitions imply—when use is made of the fact that if a, 6 and c are hyper-
numbers with c 7^ 0 then ac = be implies a = b—that, for any nonzero hypernum-
ber c and any module M, a congruence ac = be mod [e]M implies a = b mod M.

to go from the terminal equation back to the original, thereby determining 
the possible original equations and showing that [F, G -f y/A] is a successor 
of [f,g + V^]. For example, the input equation [236 + 89\/7][83,16-\-V7] = 
[83][3, l + \/7] leads to 
[236 -h 89\/7][83,16 + v^] = [83] [3,1 -f V7] 
{pi = 4), 
[107 + 40^7] [83,16 + ^ ] = [83] [3,2 + ^ ] 
(p2 = 5), 
[85 + 31v^][83,16 + ^/7] = [83] [6,1 + V7] 
{p^ = 7), 
[63 + 22A/7][83, 16 + X/7] - [83] [7, V7] 
{PA = 7), 
[41 + 13^7] [83,16 + V7] = [83] [6, 5 + ^7] 
(ps = 5), 
[19 + 4^7] [83,16 + V7] = [83] [3,1 + ^7] 
(pe - 7), 
[35 + 3x/7][83,16 + A/7] = [83] [14, 7 + ^7] 
(pr = 21), 
[51 + 2v^][83,16 + v^] = [83] [31,10 + v^] 
(ps = 41), 
[67 + A/7] [83,16 + 77] = [83] [54,13 + x/7] 
(pg = 67), 
[83] [83,16 + / f ] = [83] [83,16 + A/7]. 
Each step leaves the second factor on the left and the first factor on the 
right unchanged. At the last step, the uniqueness of canonical form implies 
that the two sides are identical. Therefore, the terminal equation [83] [83,16 + 
\/7] = [83] [83,16 + \/7] is determined without computation by the original 
one. Moreover, at each step the module on the right will be seen to be the 
immediate successor of the module below it. In fact, the number pi used to 
go from equation i — 1 to equation i is the number r used by the comparison 
algorithm to go from the module in equation i to the one in equation i — 1, 
which implies that the input equation at the top of the list can be obtained 
by starting with the identity at the bottom and successively multiplying by 
67 + A/7, dividing by 83, multiplying by 41 + \/7, dividing by 54, and so forth, 
applying the operations to the hypernumbers in the first factors on the left 
and to the modules in the second factors on the right. 
As this example indicates, the key fact used to determine the possible 
input equations is that application of the reduction algorithm to an equation 
[y + xy/A] [/, g + \fA] = [n] [F, G + ^/A] in which [F, G + VA] is stable produces 
a sequence of equations [i/i + Xi^/A][f^ g + \/]4] = [n][F^, Gi + ^/A\ in which 
the immediate successor of [F^, Gi + A/A] is [Fj_i, G^_i + \fA\ and the number 
Pi used by the reduction algorithm to go from equation i — 1 to equation i 
is the number used by the comparison algorithm to go from [F^, Gi + y/A\ 
to its immediate successor. Let a step of the reduction algorithm be called 
traceable if the number p used to perform it is equal to the number r used by 
the comparison algorithm to determine the immediate successor of [Fi, Gi + 
Lemma. 
A step of the reduction algorithm is traceable if [F, G + \fA\ is 
stable or if it follows a traceable step. 
Proof. Let [y + x^/A][f, g + y/A] = [n][F, G + \/A] be an input to the reduc-
tion algorithm. To say that the resulting step of the reduction algorithm is 

86 
3 Some Quadratic Problems 
traceable is to say that p = r where p is the number used by the reduction 
algorithm and r is the number used by the comparison algorithm to determine 
the immediate successor of [Fi,Gi -f y/A]. Let s be the number used by the 
comparison algorithm to determine the immediate successor 
The first step of the proof will be to show that if the step is not traceable, 
then p-\- s = F. 
If the step is not traceable, then because p'^ > A and p-\- Gi = 0 mod Fi, 
and because r is by definition the smallest number for which r'^ > A and 
r + Gi = 0 mod Fi, p must be at least as great as Fi, and the square of 
p- 
Fi must be greater than A. Then {p - Fi^ > A or p^ + Ff > 2pFi + A, 
from which it follows (subtract A and divide by Fi) that F -\- Fi > 2p and 
F > p -\- {p — Fi) > p^ so F — p > p — Fi > 0. If p -\- s were greater than 
or equal to 2F, it would follow that s > F -\- {F - p) > F dnid {s - F)'^ > 
{F - PY > {p- FiY > A, contrary to the definition of s. Thus, p + s < 2F. 
Since p + s = G + 5 = 0 mod F, the desired conclusion p-\- s = F follows from 
the assumption that the step is not traceable. 
Since p ^ s = F implies |s — F p = p^ > A, which in turn implies that 
[F, G + \/]4] is not stable (see the proof of Proposition 1), the first statement 
of the lemma, that if [F, G + y/A] is stable then the step is traceable, follows. 
Suppose, finally, that the step follows a traceable step of the reduction 
algorithm. Then the step that it follows is retraced by multiplying by s + \/A 
and dividing by F. Thus, the previous x is {y + sx)/F. Since the reduction 
algorithm reduces x, it follows that x < ^^^^, which is to say Fx < y ^ sx. If 
the step were not traceable, F would be 5 + p, so px + sx would be less than 
y + sx, and px would be less than ?/, contrary to the definition of p. Therefore, 
the proof of the lemma is complete. 
Proposition 2 (Solution of Pell's equation). 
The only solutions of PelVs 
equation Ax'^ -\-l = y'^ are those given by the reduction algorithm, namely, the 
pairs {x,y) given by formula (2) when [f,g + \fA] = [fki9k + \fA] = [!]• 
Proof. Putting [y^x\fA\ 
in canonical form when y and x are relatively prime 
and y'^ > Ax"^ easily gives [y + XVA] — [y'^ — Ax'^^g + V^], where g is 
determined by y = gx mod (^^ — Ax"^). Therefore, Ax^ + 1 = 7/^ implies 
[y + x\/]4] = [1]. Conversely, if y^ > Ax^ and [y + XA/A] = [1], then x and y 
are relatively prime and y^ — Ax^ = 1. In short, solutions of Pell's equation 
correspond one-to-one to hypernumbers y + xy/A for which y^ > Ax^ and 
[y + xVA] = [l]. 
Since [1] is stable, infinitely many of its successors are [1]. Each such suc-
cessor implies a solution {xk,yk) of Pell's equation given by the formula 
is to be shown

But a solution of Pell's equation is, as was just shown, a hypernumber 
y + x\fA that satisfies [y + xv^][l] — [1]. This equation is an input to the 
reduction algorithm (write the right side as [1][1,A/A]), and repeated appli-
cation of the reduction algorithm reduces it to [l][l,\/]4] = [l][l,^/]4]. The 
input y + x\fA = 1 + 0 • ^/A of course is already reduced and corresponds to 
the trivial solution A • 0^ + 1 = 1^ of Pell's equation. Otherwise, the reduction 
requires /c > 1 steps, all steps are traceable, and y + x\/A is obtained when 
1 is multiplied by pk + \fA and divided by 1, multiplied by pk-i + ^/A and 
divided by / ^ - i , and so forth. Since the sequence of p's is the sequence—in 
reverse order—of r's obtained by applying the comparison algorithm to [1], 
Proposition 2 follows. 
For example, when A = 13, the cycle of [1] is [1], [3,1 + Vl3], [4,1 -h vT3], 
[9,7 + ^13], [12,ll + Vl3], [13,713], [12,1 + 713], [9,2 + ^13], [4,3 + 713], 
[3, 2 + \/l3], after which the sequence returns to [1] and repeats. The r's used 
at the successive steps are 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 13, 11, 7, 5, 4, after which they 
repeat. Thus the smallest solution of 13a:^ -\-l = y'^ other than the trivial one 
is given by the coefficients of 
(4 + 7l3)'(5 + 713)^(7 + 713)^(11 + 713)^(13 + 713) 
32 .42 . 92 .122 . 13 
which is easily found to be 649 + 1807l3. That is, the smallest solution of 
Pell's equation when A = 13 is 13 • 180^ + 1 = 649^ Since (649 + 1807l3)^ = 
842401 + 2336407l3, the next smallest solution is 13 • 233640^ + 1 = 842401^ 
and so forth. 
(For any A^ as for A = 13, the sequence of r's is in fact a palindrome, so 
the sequence of p's is identical to the sequence of r's.) 
Proposition 3. // [/, g + ^/A\ is principal, then [f,f — g-h VA] is also 
principal, and the product of these modules is [/]. 
Proof. Suppose [/, ^ + 72] = [y-\-xy/A], where y'^ > Ax'^. Since any common 
divisor of x and y divides the coefficient of \fA in ^f + \fA, x and y are 
relatively prime. Therefore, the number y'^ —Ax^^ call it TV, is relatively prime 
to X, and x has a reciprocal, call it r, mod N. Then [y -\- x^/A] = [N, y -\-
XVA, r{y + X 7 A ) ] = [N,G-\- 
7 3 ] , where G = ry mod N, so f = N, g = G, 
and y = xry = gx mod A^. 
The solutions (X, Y) of Pell's equation obviously grow without bound, so 
there is a solution Y'^ = AX'^ + 1 of Pell's equation in which X > x. Since 
y^-Ax^ 
= / > 0, it follows that X'^y^ = AX^x^-^fX^ 
> AX^x'^-hx^ = Y^x'^, 
which implies Xy > Yx. Also, Y'^y'^ = A^x^X'^ ^-Ax^ ^ f AX'^ ^ f > A^X'^x^, 
so Yy > AXx. Therefore, the formula z + wy/A = (Y -\- XVA){y 
- XVA) 
defines a hypernumber z -\- wyfA (even though, by the strict definition being 
used here, y — xyA is not a hypernumber). This hypernumber satisfies [z + 
w^fA){y + X 7 A ) = ( r + X^fA){y - x^fA){y + x^^A) = (F + X^fA)f, 
Thus, 

88

[z + wy/A][y -h x^/A] = [F + Xy/A][f]

z = {f—g)w

= 
( y + X\/A)f 
gives wy -\- zx = / X , so 0 ^ wy -\- zx = wgx -\- zx mod / , 
which implies, because x is relatively prime to / , that wg -\- z = 0 mod / , or 
z = (f — g)w mod / , as was to be shown. 
Corollary. 
A module that is equivalent to [1] is 
principal 
Deduction. 
To say that M is equivalent to [1] means that there are principal 
modules Pi and P2 for which MPi 
— P2. By Proposition 3, there is a principal 
module P3 such that P1P3 = [n] for some number n. Thus M[n] = P2P3, which 
implies M[n\ = [z -{- wy/A]^ where z^ > Aw'^. This equation impHes that n 
divides both z and i^, so M = [^ + ^^^^1 ^^ principal. 
Proof of the Theorem. 
Suppose that [/, g + y/A] and [P, G + ^/A] are equiva-
lent—say [y + xy/A][f,g 
+ y/A] = [v -\- UVA][F,G 
+ y/A] where y'^ > Ax^ 
and v^ > Au^—and 
that [P, G + \/]4] is stable. By Proposition 3, there is 
a hypernumber z + w\fA 
for which z^ > Aii;^ and [z + i^jv^lit' + u\/A\ 
= 
[n] for some number n. Let the given equivalence between [/, g + y/A\ and 
[P, G + \fA\ be multiplied by [P(2; + w\fA)] 
to yield an equation of the form 
[Y + X / A ] [/, ^ + \/]4] = [N] [P, G + \/A], where TV = Fn, that is an input to 
the reduction algorithm. Application of the reduction algorithm reduces this 
equation to [N][f,g + y/A] = [N][f,g^ 
\fA]. Since [P, G + \fA] is stable, the 
steps of the algorithm can be retraced by applying the comparison algorithm 
to [/, ^ + \ / ^ ] , from which it follows that Y + X\/~A can be obtained by 
multiplying N hy ri -{- \/]4, dividing by / , multiplying by r2 + \ / ^ , dividing 
by / i , and so forth, stopping with the kih step, where [P, G + \/~A] is the A:th

Deduction. If two stable modules are equivalent, the theorem implies that 
each is a successor of the other, so they are in the same cycle. 
Solution of An^B 
= D. A solution of Ax^ -\-B = y'^ is called primitive if 
X and y are relatively prime. The primitive solutions are found in the following 
way: 
For each square root p of A mod B, use formula (2) to find all solutions 
of the problem [y + x\fA\[B^p^yfA] 
— [B]. Each pair {x, y) found in this way 
is a primitive solution of Ax'^ -\- B — y'^, and there are no others. 
The solutions {x,y) that are not primitive are of the form {ud^vd), where 
is a square factor of B and (w, v) is a primitive solution of Au^ ~^ ^ ~ 
v^. Therefore, they can be found by finding all square factors d^ of B that are 
greater than 1 and, for each of them, using the method just described to find 
all primitive solutions (u, v) of Au^ 
B_ 
Proof. The hypernumbers (3) are the solutions of [y -\- x\fA\[B^p -\- \fA\ = 
[5][1, yA\ found by the construction of the theorem. Multiplication by [5, B — 
p + \fA] then gives [y + xV^][5] = [B][B, B - p-^ ^/A], which implies [y + 
xv]4] = [B, B — p-\-\/A]^ so X and y are relatively prime and satisfy y"^ —Ax"^ = 
B. Conversely, if x and y satisfy these conditions, then reduction of [^ + x\/]4] 
to canonical form gives [B^g -\- ^/A] for some square root g of A mod B, so 
[y + x\^][B^ 
B — g ^ y/A] = [B] for another square root B — g of A mod 5 , 
and y + x^/A is among the solutions given by (3). 
For example, the solution of 79n + 21 = D requires finding the square 
roots of 79 mod 21. (Note that 21 has no square factors, so all solutions are 
primitive solutions.) These are easily found by finding the square roots ±1 
of 79 mod 3 and the square roots ±3 of 79 mod 7 and putting them together 
using the Chinese remainder theorem to find the four square roots 4, 10, 11, 
and 17 of 79 mod 21. The module [21,4 + \/79] is stable, and its cycle under 
the comparison algorithm contains 8 stable modules; since [1] is not among 
them, the square root 4 of 79 mod 21 gives rise to no solutions of 79n + 21 = D. 
Similarly, the module [21,17 -h A/79] is stable. Its cycle—which contains the 
conjugates of the modules in the cycle of [21,4 + \/79], as is shown in the 
table below—also has length 8 and does not contain [1], so this square root 
does not give rise to any solutions of 79n + 21 = D either. Application of 
the comparison algorithm to [21,10 + \/79], on the other hand, reaches [1] 
in two steps from [21,10 + \/79] to [2,1 + \/79] to [1]; the values of r are 
first 11 and then 9, so 7/ + x\/79 = (II+V^)(9+A/79) = 89 + 10\/79, and the 
smallest solution of 79n + 21 = D in the sequence of solutions corresponding 
to [21,10 + A/79] is 79 • 10^ + 21 = 89^. The next solution is found by taking

the comparison algorithm two steps further, which multiplies 89 + 10\/79 by 
(9+v^K9+x/79) ^ go -f 9 / 7 9 , which of course describes the smallest solution 
79 • 9^ + 1 = 80^ of Pell's equation in the case A = 79. Since (89 +10\/79) (80 + 
9 v ^ ) = 14230+1601^79, the next solution of 790 4-21 = D in this sequence 
is 79 • 1601^ + 21 = 14230^. More generally, the nth solution in the sequence is 
contained in the coefficients of (89 + 10\/79)(80 + 9\/79)''"^. In the same way, 
the fact that [21,11 + v ^ ] ^ [1] leads to an infinite sequence of solutions of 
79x^ + 21 = 2/^, namely, the solutions in which x is the coefficient of \/79 in 
(10 + \/79)(80 + 9\/79)'^"^. All solutions are contained in these two infinite 
sequences.

* Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, §§185, 186, 187, 195, 196, 198, 223. The reason 79 is 
of interest is that it is the smallest value of A for which the class group contains 
a square that is not the identity—for example, [3,1 + A/79]^ ~ [9, 4 + V ^ ] / [1]. 
Perhaps Gauss's attention was drawn to this case by the fact that it occurs in a 
counterexample Lagrange gave to a conjecture of Euler [48, Article 84]. Lagrange 
notes that the problem 79 • D + 733 = D has a solution (the comparison algorithm 
gives [733, 476 + A/79] - [90, 77 + v/79] - [1]) but the problem 79 • D + 101 = D 
does not ([101,33 + ^79] - [45,23 + A/79] - [9,4 + A/79] ^ [1]), contrary to a 
conjecture of Euler that would have implied that the answer to "Does An-\~B = D 
have a solution?" might, for prime B, depend only on the class of B mod 4A.

Essay 3.4 Multiplication of Modules and Module Classes 
In this essay, the semigroup of modules and the class semigroup are examined 
more closely. In the semigroup of modules, modules can be decomposed as 
products of their "p-parts" where p ranges over the primes, and in this way 
the semigroup can be described quite fully, except for the crucial problem 
of determining 
the primes p mod which A is a square, which are the primes 
for which [p] is a product in which neither factor is [1]. This question is the 
subject of Essay 3.5. 
The structure of the class semigroup depends on more subtle consider-
ations, and general statements are harder to come by. The theorem that is 
proved in this essay and that is used in the next to prove the law of quadratic 
reciprocity merely describes the subgroups of index 2 of the class group in a 
few simple cases (namely, the cases in which A is an odd prime or twice an 
odd prime or a product of two primes that are congruent mod 4). 
The computation of products of modules comes down to the computation 
of products [/, g + \/~A] [F, G + \fA] (where g'^ = A mod / and G'^ = A mod 
F), because multiplication of a module by [e] is easy. The following theorem 
determines these products when / and F are relatively prime: 
T h e o r e m 1. 
/ / / and F are relatively 
prime, 
[/F, z + V ^ ] ; where z is determined 
by z = g mod / and z = G mod F. 
Proof. By the Chinese remainder theorem,* the congruences z = g mod / 
and z ^ G mod F determine a unique z mod / F , so the formula [/F, z -\- y/A] 
determines a module. The desired product is [/F, / ( G + V ^ ) , F{g-\-y/A), 
{g-\-
VA){G 
+ VA)], which is [/F, f(z + y/A),F{z 
+ yfA),gG 
+ A + (^ + G ) v ^ ] , 
because fG 
= fz mod / F and Fg = Fz mod / F . If / 3 / = aF -\- 1, then 
z + \fA 
is the difference of (3f{z + \fA) 
and aF{z 
-h v ^ ) , so the desired 
product is [fF,z 
-h VA^gG 
+ A + (^ + G)y/A]. 
Since A = z'^ mod / and 
A = z"^ mod F and since / and F are relatively prime, A = z'^ mod / F ; 
moreover, {z — g){z — G) = 0 mod / F , so A + gG = z{g + G) mod / F , which 
implies that gG + ^ in the last term can be replaced by z{g -\- G)^ and the 
desired product becomes [/F, z + \/]4, {g -^ G){z + v ^ ) ] = [fF^ z + V ^ ] , as 
was to be shown. 
Given a prime p and a module [/, g + \fA\, 
let the p - p a r t of [/, g + vC4] 
be the module [p^^g -\- \ / ^ ] , where n is the number of times p divides / . (If 
p does not divide / , the p-part of [/, ^ + ^fA\ is [1] by this definition.) By 
Theorem 1, every module is the product of its p-parts, and one can find the 
product of [/, g -f- \fA\ and [F, G + vG4] by finding the product of their p-parts 
for each prime divisor p of / F , which reduces to finding the product of the 
p-parts for the primes p that divide both / and F . In short, the computation 
of [/, g + \fA\ [F, G + \fA\ can be done prime by prime. For all but a very few 
primes, the needed products are given by the three propositions that follow.

3 Some Quadratic Problems 
Proposition 1. 
Let p be an odd prime that does not divide A. If A is not a 
square mod p, there are no modules [/, g + A/A] in canonical form other than 
[1] in which f is a power of p. If A is a square mod p, there are exactly two 
modules [p^ ^g -\- \/A\ in canonical form for each n > 0^ and they are the nth 
powers of those in which n = 1. The product of the two in which n = 1 is [p]. 
Thus, a product of the form [p'^^g + A/]4][^^, G + y/A] can be found by 
writing it as [p, ^ + \/]4]^[p, G + A/Z]^ and observing that the theorem imphes 
that their product is [p,g + \/A]'^+'' if [p,g + VA] = [p,G -\- VA], and is 
[j9]^[p, G + \/]4]^-^ or [p]^[p, g + \/]4]^-^ in the obvious way 'ii\p,g + VA]^ 
[P.G^VA]. 
Proof Because a polynomial of degree n with integer coefficients that is not 
zero mod p has at most n roots mod p, A has at most two square roots mod 
p. Because —g is a square root of A mod p whenever g is, and because g and 
—g are different mod p when this is the case (if they were the same, then 2g 
would be zero mod p so AA = {2gY = 0 mod p, contrary to hypothesis), A 
has either no square roots mod p or exactly two. When it has two, and when 
g < p is one of them, the product [p, g + \/]4][p,P — ^ + VA] is [p^,p{p — g ^ 
^/^)iP{9 + ^/^)iP9 — g'^ -\- A -\- py/A]. The third term minus the second is 
2pg mod p^ and [p^, 2pg] = [p] (again, because the square of 2g is not divisible 
by p and p is prime), so the first term p^ can be replaced by p, and the module 
is equal to [p]. 
If, for some n > 1, gn-i is a square root of A modp^~^, then there is 
a unique square root of A mod p^ that is congruent to gn-i modp^~^, be-
cause the formula {gn-i + l3p^~^Y = Amodp^ implies 2(3gn-i = {A— 
^^_i)/p^~^ mod p, which determines /? mod p because 2gn-i is relatively 
prime to p. Therefore, for each value of n and for each square root g of 
A mod p there is exactly one square root of A mod p^ that is g mod p; call it 
gn. If [p,^ + ^ ] " - ^ = [p^-\gn-i 
+ VA], then the same formula holds with 
n in place of n - 1, because [p,^ + y/A]'^ = [p'^~^,gn-i + ^/A][p,g 4- VA] = 
[p^-\gn^VA][p,gn 
+ VA] = [p^,p{gr^ + ^/A), gl ^ A + 2gnVA] = [p",p(^n + 
VA),2gn{gn + VA)] = [p^.g^ + VA] (because [p,2^,] = [1]). Thus [p,^ + VA]-
is the unique module [p^,G -\- y/A] in canonical form in which G = g mod p, 
as was to be shown. 
Proposition 2. 
If p is a prime that divides A once but not twice, the only 
module [p^,^ -f vA] in canonical form in which n > 0 is [p, V^]; the square 
of[p,VA] is [p]. 
Proof If g were a square root of A mod p^ for n > 1, then p would divide g^ 
and therefore would divide g itself, so p^ would divide g^ = A mod p^, contrary 
to the assumption that A^O 
mod p^. Therefore, the only module [p^,g-\-\/A] 
in canonical form in which n > 0 is [p, \/A] because g"^ = A = 0 mod p 
implies ^ = 0 mod p. The square of this module is [P^,PA/]4, A] = [p], because 
[p^,^] = [p] by assumption. 

Essay 3.4 Multiplication of Modules and Module Classes 
95 
Proposition 3. 
If A is odd, the modules in canonical form [2^,^ + v^] with 
n > 0 are as follows: 
(i) When A = 3 mod A, [2,1 + A/Z] is the only one; its square is [2]. 
(a) When A = b mod 8, there are three: a = [2,1 + ^/A], /? = [4,1 + \fA], 
and (5 = [4, 3 + yA\. 
The product of a with any of the three is [2\a, whereas 
p^ = [2]~P, 'f = [2]/3 and (3p = [4]. 
(Hi) When A = 1 mod 16, let a = [2,1 + VA], /? = [8,5 + VA], and 
P = [8,3 + y/A]. The modules in question are a and four infinite sequences 
of modules /^^/[2^-i], ^''/[2''-^], 
a/3^/[2^], and op /['^"'] for n > 0, these 
modules being distinct from one another. They can be multiplied using o? — 
\2\a andf5p^ 
[8]. 
(iv) When A = 9 mod 16, the answer is given by (Hi) when (5 is changed 
to [8,1 + y/A] and ^ to [8, 7 + y/A]. 
Proof, (i) The square of any odd number is 1 mod 4, so A = 3 mod 4 implies 
that no module [2^,^ -f v^] is in canonical form when n > 1. The square of 
[2,1 + \/A] is [4,2 + 2A/I, A + 1 + 2y/A] = [4,2 + 2y/A, A - 1], which is [2] 
because [A, A - 1] = [2]. 
(ii) Similarly, the square of any odd number is 1 mod 8, so ^ = 5 mod 8 
implies that there are no modules [2^, p -h A/A] in canonical form in which 
n > 2. The multiplication formulas that are given are easy to verify. For 
example, [4,1 -f- y/Af = [16,4(1 -f \/]4), 1 + A + 2y/A]] twice the third term 
minus the second is 2+2A—A — 2(^1—1) = 8 mod 16, so the 16 in the first term 
can be replaced by 8, after which the second term can be dropped because it 
can be expressed in terms of the first and third, resulting in [8, H-A-f2\/]4] = 
[2][4,3 + yi]. 
(iii) and (iv) Let .A be 1 mod 8. For each n>l, 
there is a unique solution 
gn < 2^+2 of gl = A + 2^+^ ^^^ 2^+^ for which gn = 1 mod 4. In fact, 
^1 = 5 is determined by these conditions when A = 1 mod 16, and gi = 1 
is determined by them when A = 9 mod 16. For n > 1, knowledge of gn-i 
enables one to find gn in the following way. The congruence h^ = A.+2^"^^ mod 
2n+3 Q£ which gn is a root implies, because g^_i = A-\- 2^+^ mod 2^^+^, that 
h^-gl_i 
= 2^+1 mod 2^+2. If /i = 1 = gn-i mod 4, then /i + ^n-i is divisible 
by 2 but not 4, so the congruence {h -\- gn-i){h — gn-i) = 2^^^ mod 2^^+^ 
imphes that h — gn-i is divisible by 2^ but not 2^'^^. Thus h = gn-i + 
2^ mod 2^^+^. In short, if the conditions on gn can be met, then gn = gn-i + 
2^ mod 2^+^. The two possible values gn-i =t 2^ of gn mod 2^+^ determined 
in this way have squares that differ by 2^^+^ mod 2"^+"^, so the condition g'^ = 
A + 2^+^ mod 2^"^^ is satisfied by exactly one of them. 
The sequence ^1, ^2, 93 j • • • determined in this way describes the modules 
/3^/[2'^~^] — [2^+^, ^n H- VA], as can be seen as follows: By the very definition 
of ^1, P = [8,^1 + y/A] in both (iii) and (iv). What is to be shown, then, is 
that [8,^1 + \/]4][2^+\^n_i + VA] = [2][2^+^^n + VA]. The product on the 
left side is [2^^\S{gn-i 
+ y/A),2^^^{gi-^VA),gign-i-hA 
+ 
{gi+gn-i)VA]. 
Because gn-i = gn + 2'' mod 2^+\ one has 8gn-i = 8gn + 2^+^ mod 2^+^, 

96 
3 Some Quadratic Problems 
so the second term can be changed to 8{gn + y/A) -h 2"^+^. Similarly, the 
third term can be changed to 2''^^{gn + VA) + 2"'+^. (Use ^i = ^2 + 4 mod 8 
and g2 = Qn mod 8.) Finally, the congruences g^ = gi + 4 mod 8 and gn = 
gn-i + 2- mod 2-+1 imply {g^ - gi){gn - 9n-i) 
= 2^+^ mod 2-+^ which 
combines with A = g'^ -\- 2"^+^ mod 2^^+"^ to give A -\- gign-i 
= 9n{9n-i + 
^fi) mod 2^+^, and the product [8,^i + \/]4][2^+-^,^^_i + \/]4] can be written as 
[2"+^8(5n + y I ) + 2"+^2"+l(9n + V I ) + 2"+^(5l+5„-l)(5r^ + VA)+2"+3a], 
where a = 0 or 1. The diflFerence between ^^ ^"^"^ times the second term and 
4 times the last term is 2"^+^ mod 2^+"^, because ^^"^^"""^ is odd. Thus the first 
term can be changed to 2^+^, and the desired product can be expressed as 
[2"+^ ^{gn + v ^ ) , 2^^\9n 
+ VC4), (^1 + ^n-i)(^n + v^)]- The third term is 
a multiple of the second and can be dropped. Because [8,^1 + gn] = [2], this 
brings [8,^i + \/I][2^+\^n_i+ \/I] to the desired form [2-2^+^ 2(^^ + V^)]. 
The sequence ^1, '§2^ ^25 • • • defined by 'g^ = —gn mod 2^"^^ satisfies the 
same conditions as the sequence ^1, ^2, S's • • •, except that the condition 
gn = I mod 4 is replaced by ^^ = 3 mod 4. Therefore, the same argument 
gives ;5''/[2^-i] = [2^+2^-^^ + VA\ = [2'^+^^^ + \ / I ] . For n > 1 there 
are four modules of the form [2^~^^,g + V^], one for each of the four square 
roots of A mod 2^+^, which are ib^^ and ih^^ + 2^"*"^. The first two have been 
77,4-1 
accounted for. The remaining two are a/?^^^/[2"^+^] and a(3 
/[2^+^], as 
follows from the observation that the last term in [2,1 + \/]4][2^'^'^, :^gn-\-i + 
y/A] = [2-+^2(±^,+l + ^ ) , 2 - + 3 ( l + v ^ ) , ± ^ , + l + A + ( l ± ^ , + l ) ^ / I ] can 
be changed to (1 ± ^n+i)(±^n+i) + 2""+^ + (1 ± ^n+i)V^, which is 2^+^ plus 
a multiple of the second term; therefore, the first term can be replaced with 
2^+^, so that the module becomes [2^+^, 2(±c/n+i + V^)] = [2][2^+^ zb^f^ + 
2'^+^H-\/]4], as was to be shown. When n = 0 the result is [2] [4, ±l+\/]4], which 
accounts for the two modules aP/[2] = [4,1 + y/A\ and a^/[2] = [4,3 + \/]4] 
and completes the proof. 
These three propositions cover all products [/, g + \/]4] [F^ G + y/A] except 
those in which some prime p divides both / and F and divides A twice. In 
particular, if A is square-free, it describes all products. 
The description of products of equivalence classes of modules is in prin-
ciple much easier, because the number of equivalence classes is finite, so one 
can simply compile a multiplication table showing all products of all pairs 
of classes. However, multiplication tables are rarely very enlightening. More 
insight into the class semigroup is obtained by considering specific features. 
In particular, as Gauss's work in Section 5 of Disquisitiones 
Arithmeticae 
showed, enough information about the class semigroup on which to base a 
proof of quadratic reciprocity is provided by analyzing the classes that are 
ambiguous in the sense defined below. 
Lemma. 
// [/, g + y/A] is stable and if [/i, gi + y/A\ is its successor in the 
comparison algorithm, then [/, f—g-\-y/A] 
is the successor o/[/i, /i —gi-\-VA] 
in the comparison algorithm. 

Essay 3.4 Multiplication of Modules and Module Classes

Proof. By definition, [/i, gi + VA] is determined by / / i = r'^ — A and gi = 
r mod /i where r is the least solution of r + ^f = 0 mod / whose square is 
greater than A. Similarly, the successor of [/i, / i — ^i + \/^] is [f^g^ + V^] 
where / ' / i = r^ — ^ , ^' = ri mod f\ 
and ri is the least solution of ri = 
gi mod / i whose square is greater than A. It was shown in Essay 3.3 in the 
proof that the comparison algorithm permutes stable modules that r is the 
least number in its class mod / i whose square is greater than A. Thus, since 
ri and r are both gi mod / i , ri = r, which implies f 
= f and g' = ri = 
—g mod / , as was to be shown. 
Thus, if [/, g -\- y/A] is stable, the cycle of [f,f 
— g-\- y/A] contains the 
modules obtained by changing g to f — g in the modules in the cycle of 
[f,g + vA], but they are traversed in the opposite direction. In particular, if 
[fif~9~^ 
VA] ^ [/, ^ -h y/A] holds for one module in a cycle it holds for all 
When this is the case, the cycle is called ambiguous. 
Let Ml, M2, •.., Mjy be the modules in an ambiguous cycle in the order 
given them by the comparison algorithm. Let the definition of Mi be extended 
to all integers i by setting Mi = Mj whenever i = j mod z/, and, for Mi = 
[fi 5 9i + VA] •> let Mi denote [/^, fi — gi-^ y/A]. Call a stable module Mi pivotal 
if (1) Mi = Mi or (2) Mi = M^_i. An ambiguous cycle contains 
exactly 
two pivotal modules—unless it contains just one module—as can be seen as 
follows: 
Let the given cycle be ambiguous and let /i > 0 satisfy MQ = M ^ . By 
the lemma, Mi = M ^ _ i , M2 = M^_2, and so forth. If /i > 1 renumber the 
modules in the cycle by setting M/ = M^+i. Then M/ = M^+i = M^_i_i = 
-M^_^_2, so the renumbering of the modules has the effect of reducing /i by 
2. In this way, // can be successively reduced until it is 0 or 1. 
If // = 0, then Mi — M(^_i) = M^^^i for each z, which is to say Mi — Mj^-i, 
so Mi is pivotal of type (1) if and only iii = —i mod u and pivotal of type (2) 
if and only if i = 1 — i mod ly. Thus, when z/ = 2cr for a > 0 the only pivotal 
modules are MQ and M^ (because 0 and a are the only numbers i less than u 
for which 2i = 0 mod 2a and 2i = 1 mod 2cr has no solutions at all) and when 
z/ = 2r -f 1 the only pivotal modules are MQ and M^-^-i. Similarly, if /i = 1, 
then Mi = Mi^+i_^, so Mi is pivotal of type (1) if and only if i = 1 — i mod v 
and pivotal of type (2) if and only if i = 2 — z mod u, from which it follows 
that there are two pivotal modules when z/ = 2(j for cr > 0, namely, Mi and 
M0-+1, and two pivotal modules when u = 2 T -h 1, namely. Mi and M^+i. 
That there are two pivotal modules unless u = 1 follows from the observation 
that the modules given by these formulas are distinct unless 1/ = 1.

(a) If A is an odd prime, 
there are four pivotal 
modules, 
[1,VA], 
[2,1 -h VA], 
[A,y/A], 
and [ ^ ^ , 1 + y/A] (except that in the cases 
A = 3 and A = b the last of these coincides with one of the first two to form 
a cycle of length 1). 
(b) If A is twice an odd prime, say A = 2p, there are four pivotal 
modules, 
[1,VA], 
[2,VA], 
[P,VA], 
and[A,^/A].

3 Some Quadratic Problems 
(c) If A is a product of two odd primes, 
say A = pq, where p < q, there are 
eight pivotal modules, 
[1, ^/A], [p, \/]4], [q, VA], [A, ^/A], [2,1 + VA], 
[2p,p-\-
\/A], 
[^^y^, 1 + VA] cind [ ^ ^ , p + \fA\ 
(except that the last of these 
coincides 
with one of the others to form a cycle of length 1 if q — p — 2 or 4). 
Thus, in cases (a) and (b) there are 2 ambiguous cycles, and in case (c) 
there are four. 
Proof 
(a) A module [/, g + y/A] in canonical form is pivotal of type (1) if and 
only if ^ = —g mod / . When this is the case, 2g = 0 mod / and 4A = (2^)^ = 
0 mod / ; that is, / is a factor of 4A. Since A is an odd prime, / = 1, 2, 4, or A, 
because / < A in a stable module. Since f = 4 would imply 2g = 0 mod 4 and 
^ = 0 mod 2, it is impossible in view of ^^ = A mod / . Therefore, the only 
possible pivotal modules of type (1) in this case are [l,v^], [2,1 +/A], and 
[A, v ^ ] , all of which are clearly pivotal of type (1). If [/, ^ + y/A] is pivotal of 
type (2), then its predecessor in the comparison algorithm is [f,f 
— g-\- V ^ ] , 
and the r that determines the step from [f^f — g-\- VA] to [/,g-\-y/A] satisfies 
p ^ y.2 _ ^ 
Thus, A = {r - f){r -\- f), which implies that r - / = 1 and 
r-\-f 
= A and therefore that / = ^ ^ , r = ^-^. 
Since the new g is congruent 
to r mod / , and since r = 1 mod / , the only possible pivotal module of type 
(2) is M ^ , l + \/]4 , which is in fact pivotal of type (2). 
(b) As in the proof of (a), if [/, g + ^/A] is pivotal of type (1), then 4^4 = 
0 mod / and / < A, so / = 1, 2, 4, p, or 2p. Again, / = 4 is impossible 
because it would imply ^4 = 0 mod 4, so the only pivotal modules of type (1) 
are the ones listed in (b). There are no pivotal modules of type (2) because 
A = 2 mod 4, so r^ — f^ = A is impossible. 
(c) If / is a factor of 4^4 less than or equal to A, then / = 1, 2, 4, p, g', 
2p, 2g, or A = pq. Since [2g, q + \/A] is not stable (both q'^ and {2q — q)'^ are 
q^ > pq =^ A)^ the only possible pivotal modules of type (1) are [1], [2, 1 + A/A], 
[p, vA], 
[q^ A / ^ ] , [2p^p + vA], and [A^ \A]^ all of which are indeed pivotal of 
type (1). Those that are pivotal of type (2) satisfy A = {r — f){r -\- f) as in 
the proof of (a), where r is the number used by the comparison algorithm to 
go to the pivotal module from its predecessor. Thus, either r — / = 1 and 
r-\-f 
= A or r — f = p and r + / = g. In the first case, r = 1 mod / , so the 
^^^, 1 + y/Al, 
and in the second case, r = p mod / , so the 
module must be 
module must be ^,P 
+ VA 
which completes the list. 
The complications that arise in the cases A = 1 mod 4 of Proposition 3 
stem from the fact that in these cases the class semigroup is not a group, which 
is to say that there are classes without inverses. For example, the square of 
[2,1 + \/5] is [2] [2,1 + V^], but [2,1 + V^] constitutes a cycle of length 1 and 
is therefore not equivalent to [1]. Therefore, the class of a = [2,1 + \/5] has 
no inverse because a^ ~ [1] would imply a = Q;[1] ^ a'^^y = [2] 0^7 ^ 0^7 ^ [1]. 
A module whose class is invertible in the class semigroup is called primitive. 

Essay 3.4 Multiplication of Modules and Module Classes 
99 
The class group for a number A, not a square, consists of the invertible 
elements of the class semigroup, those classes whose elements are primitive. 
For any given A, the class semigroup is found by finding the cycles of stable 
modules. One can then find the class group by using the following theorem to 
determine which cycles contain primitive modules: 
Theorem 3. 
Let [e][/, ^ + y/A] be a module in canonical form, and let d 
he the greatest common divisor of f, 2g, and '^ 7 ^ if d = 1, then [f,g + 
y/A][f,f 
— g -\- y/A] = [/]; in particular, [e][f,g + \/]4] is primitive, because 
the class of [f, f — g -\- A/]4] is inverse to its class. If d > 1, [e][f,g + ^/A] is 
not primitive. 
In particular, if A = 1 mod 4, the module [2,1 + y/A] is not primitive, 
because in this case d = 2. 
•/VA] 
Proof. By direct computation 
[f,g+y/A][f,f-g+VA] 
= [f, 
= [f, 
= [/] 
= [/][' 
-fg + fVAJg + fVA 
-2fg,fg + fVA,\g^-
'f,2gJ-lf^,g + VA 
i,g + \/A], 
Jg-g^ 
+ A 
where use is made of the first term /^ to compute with the coefficients of the 
other terms as numbers mod /^. If d = 1, this product is [/], which proves 
the first statement. 
Now, [d,g + VA][f,g + VA] = [df,d{g + VA),g^ + A + 2g^] 
= [df,dig + 
VA),A 
— g'^] (subtract 2g/d times the second term from the third, com-
puting mod df) = [d][f^g + ^/~A\ (because g^ = Axnoddf). 
Therefore 
[d,g + y/A][f,g + VA] = [d][f,g ^ yfA] - [/,^ + A/I], which shows that 
^/ [/? 9 + V^] ^^ primitive, then [d, g + \/~A\ ^ [1], which is to say that repeated 
application of the comparison algorithm to [d^ g + y/A\ must eventually reach 
[1]. But if d divides /, 2^, and '^ 7 ' for any module [/, ^ + \fA\ in canonical 
form—as is the case with the module [d^ gi -h \fA\ when gi is the smallest 
number congruent to g mod d because gi-\- g and gi — g are both zero mod d, 
so gf- A = g'^ - A-\-{gi^ 
g){gi - g) = 0 mod d"^—then d divides F, 2G, and 
^—^-^, where [F, G + \/I] is the successor of [/, g + Vl] in the comparison 
algorithm, as can be seen as follows: Let r = uf — g he the number used to 
find [F, G + A/A]. Then / F = r^ - A = u'^f^ - 2guf -i-g'^ - A = 0 mod df, 
which implies F = 0 mod d. Moreover, G = fiF -\- r for some /x, which gives 
2G = 2/xF ^2Tyf-2g 
= 0 mod d. Finally, G^ - A = r^ - A + 2/iFr -f M^F^ = 
Ff + 2/iFr + fi'^F'^ = Ff ^ 2/iFG = 0 mod dF, so d divides i ^ ^ . (Note 
that /x may be negative in these congruences, so that the argument is still 
valid when G < r.) 
Therefore, if [/, g + y/A] is primitive, d must divide 1, as was to be shown.

3 Some Quadratic Problems 
Corollary. 
Elements of the class group whose squares are the identity cor-
respond one-to-one to ambiguous cycles whose modules are primitive. 
Deduction. An equivalence class whose square is the identity contains modules 
whose squares are equivalent to [1]; in particular, the modules it contains are 
all primitive. By the theorem just proved, if [/, g + y/A] is a stable module in 
canonical form that is in such a class, then both [f,g-{-y/A] and [/, / —^ +\/]4] 
are in the class inverse to the class of [/, g + y/A], which shows that the cycle 
of [/, g -\- \/\A] is ambiguous. Conversely, if [/, g + VA] is both primitive and 
ambiguous, then [f,g + ^/A]^ ^ [f,g + VA][fJ 
- g + ^/A] = [/] ~ [1]. 
When this corollary is combined with Theorem 2, it determines the ele-
ments of the class group of order 2 in a few cases: 
Theorem 4. 
// A is prime and congruent to 1 mod 4, the class group has 
no element of order 2. If A is prime and congruent to 3 mod 4, or if A is a 
product of two primes A = pq for which p -\- q ^ 0 mod A, the class group has 
a unique element of order 2. 
Proof. When A is prime and 1 mod 4, [2,1 + VA] and [ ^ , 1 + ^/A] are not 
primitive, because the greatest common divisor of /, 2^, and ' Z^ ' is 2 for 
each of them, so at most two pivotal modules are primitive. The cycle of [1] 
therefore is the only one that represents an element of the class group whose 
square is the identity. (The few cases in which there are cycles of length 1 are 
enumerated in Theorem 2.) Therefore, the class group contains no elements 
of order 2. 
On the other hand, when A is prime and 3 mod 4, or when A — 2p where 
p is an odd prime, all four of the pivotal modules identified in Theorem 2 
are primitive. Therefore, there are two primitive, ambiguous classes. The case 
A = pq in which p and q are odd primes that satisfy p = q mod 4 is similar, 
because the four pivotal modules other than [1], [p, vA]^ [q, vA]^ and [A, yA] 
are not primitive (for all of them, /, 2g^ and '^ 7 ' are all even). Thus, in 
these cases, the class group has just one element of order 2.

greater significance in the historical development of number theory by 
the fact that their proofs, insofar as proofs have been found, had to be 
sought in areas that were hitherto almost completely unexplored and that 
in this way were opened to science.)—E. E. Kummer [47, Introduction] 
Essay 3.4 gives a description of the semigroup of modules for a given A {A not 
a square) that is virtually complete except that it leaves untouched the obvious 
question raised by its Proposition 1: For which odd primes p not dividing A 
are there modules [p,g + \/A] in canonical form? This is the question 
"What is the value of Xp(^)?" 
where, for a given odd prime p, Xp is defined to be the quadratic character 
of numbers mod p, which is to say that Xp is the function that assigns to a 
number A the value* —1 if the congruence A = x^ mod p has no solution x, 
the value 0 if A = 0 mod p, and the value 1 otherwise. 
In this way, the evaluation of Xpi-^) is essential to computation in the semi-
group of modules of hypernumbers for a given A. The problem of evaluating 
Xp(A) engaged Euler's interest rather early in his career (see [17]), when he 
discovered empirically 
the amazing fact that ifp and q are primes that 
satisfy 
p = q mod 4:A, then Xp{^) = Xq(^)- I^ other words, the answer to the ques-
tion "Is A a square mod p?" depends only on the class of the prime p mod AA. 
Euler made many attempts to prove what he had found empirically; in the 
process, he found refinements and generalizations of the phenomenon, thereby 
setting much of the agenda for number theory for the next hundred years, but 
the hoped-for proof eluded him. 
What Euler knew but couldn't prove about the values of Xp(^) implies the 
law of quadratic reciprocity fairly easily. This law, which is stated below, was 
put in its usual form by Legendre and was first proved by the young Gauss, 
who gave two proofs in Disquisitiones 
Arithmeticae^ 
published in 1801 when 
he was 24 years old. The second of these uses his theory of composition of 
binary quadratic forms. The proof that will be given in this essay is inspired by 
Gauss's second proof, but it will use modules and their multiplication 
instead 
of quadratic forms and their 
composition. 
The law of quadratic reciprocity is one case of a general formula for Xp (^) 
of the form 
Use of the "negative number" — 1 can be avoided by treating the values of XP ^^ 
numbers mod 4, so that —1 = 3, (—1)^ = 1-

in which p is an odd prime, A is a square-free number that is not divisible 
by p, the product on the right is a product over all odd* prime factors Ai of 
A^ and (TA{P) depends only on the classes of p and A mod 8; in fact crA{p) 
depends only on the classes of p and A mod 4 when A is odd. The formula 
for (JA (p) is given at the end of the essay. 
Euler's observation that Xpi^) = Xg(^) when p = q mod AA follows im-
mediately from (1), because p = q mod 4A implies p = q mod Ai for all odd 
prime factors Ai of A and implies p = q mod 4 when A is odd, p = q mod 8 
when A is even. 
The derivation of formula (1) is the subject of the present essay. The law of 
quadratic reciprocity is simply the case in which A is an odd prime. However, 
the derivation will begin with this special case. It will use two lemmas: 
Lemma 1. 
If p is an odd prime, Xp(p ~ 1) ^-^ 1 when p = 1 mod 4 and —1 
when p = 3 mod 4. 
Proof. I will use without proof the fundamental fact that for any prime p 
there is a primitive root 7 mod p, which is to say a number 7 with the property 
that every number not divisible by p is congruent to a power of 7 mod p. (See 
Section 3 of Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, which contains two proofs, the first 
in Articles 39 and 54, the second in Article 55.) 
If 7 is a primitive root mod p, then each of the p — 1 numbers between 0 
and p is congruent mod p to a unique power of 7 in which the exponent is less 
than p. Since 7^^ = 7^^ mod p if and only if 2/i = A mod {p — 1), a power 7'^ 
of 7 is a square mod p for X < p if and only if A is even. Since the roots 7*^ 
and ^^P~^y^ of x^ — 1 mod p coincide with ±1 mod p^ p—1 = 7^^"^)/^ mod p, 
which is a square mod p if and only if {p — l)/2 is even, or in other words, 
Xp(p — 1) = 1 if and only if p = I mod 4, as was to be shown. 
Let X4 denote the function that assigns the value 0 to even numbers, 
the value 1 to numbers congruent to 1 mod 4, and the value —1 to numbers 
congruent to 3 mod 4. Then Lemma 1 can be stated as 
Xp{p-1) 
= X4{p) for any odd prime p. 
As is easily proved, Xp(?7in) = XP(^^)XP(^) fo^" ^11 numbers m and n when-
ever p is prime and also when p = 4. 
Lemma 2. 
Given a primitive module and given a number N, construct a 
module [/, g -h \/3] in canonical form for which (1) f is relatively prime to N 
and (2) the product of [f^g + \fA\ and the given module is equivalent to [1]. 
* Since x^iv) — 1 for all odd primes p, it makes no difference whether A^ = 2 is 
included in the product in formula (1) when A is even. 

104 
3 Some Quadratic Problems 
Proof. Let [E][F, G-f \/]4] be the given primitive module. Since it is equivalent 
one may as well assume E — 1. Choose ji large enough that 
{^F+Gf 
> A. From G^ = A mod F it follows that ( / i F + G ) ^ - ^ = 0 mod F , 
say HF = (//F + G)^ - A. For all numbers z/, {uF + /xF + G)^ - A can be 
written in the form F • ^(z^), where q{iy) is a polynomial of degree 2 with 
coefficients that are numbers, namely, 
q{iy) = Fiy^ + 2(/iF + G)iy -f ( M ^ F + 2/xG + H). 
A common divisor d of the coefficients of q{iy) divides F , 2G, and iJ, so 
{/iF + G)2 = A mod d F and G^ = A mod dF; thus, (i divides F , 2G, and 
^—^—^, which implies d = 1 because [F, G + \/]4] is primitive by assumption. 
Thus, for any prime p, q{h') is a nonzero polynomial mod p whose degree is 
2 at most. Therefore, g(z/) has at most 2 roots mod p that are less than p. 
Moreover, since F and H cannot both be even (because at least one of F , 2G, 
and H is odd), q{u) is either odd when u is even (when H is odd) or odd when 
ly is odd (when H is even). Let Pi, P25 • • • ^ Pa hst the distinct prime divisors 
of FN. For each p^, choose a number Ui < pi for which q{iyi) ^ 0 mod Pi. Use 
the Chinese remainder theorem to construct a number i^ < Y[Pi such that 
u = Ui mod p^ for each i. Then q{iy) = ^(z^^) ^ 0 mod p^ for each i. In other 
words, q{iy) is relatively prime to 
FN. 
Let p — {u -\- fi)F -\- G for the z/ chosen in this way. Then [p+y/A] 
= 
[p^-
A,P+VA] 
= [F'q{iy),p-\-y/A] 
^ [F, p-\- y/A][q{iy), p-\- y/A] (because q{u) and 
F are relatively prime) = [F,G -\- y/A][q{i'), p + y/A] (because p = G mod F ) . 
Thus, because [p + ^/A] ~ [1], the module [^(z/),^ + \/]4] has the required 
properties. 
Proposition. 
If p is an odd prime divisor of A, the value of Xpif) 
^<5 ihe 
same for any two equivalent 
primitive 
modules 
[f,g + \/A] 
in which f 
^ 
0 mod p. In this way, Xp determines 
a homomorphism 
from the class group to 
the group with two elements ±1. Similarly, 
if A = 3 mod 4, the value of XA{f) 
is the same for any two equivalent primitive 
modules [/, g + \fA] in which f 
is odd, and the function 
from the class group to ±1 that XA determines 
in this 
way is a 
homomorphism,. 
Proof 
Let [/, g + y/A] be a given primitive module in canonical form. Use 
Lemma 2 to find a module [F, G-\-\/A] in canonical form with [/, g-\-y/A] [F, G + 
VA] 
^ [1] and F relatively prime to pf. Since Lemma 2 implies that there is a 
module in canonical form [JT, Q + y/A] with [J^,T-\-\^] 
[F, G + VA] - [1] and 
J^ relatively prime to p F , the equivalence class of [/, g^\J~A\ contains a module 
\T,Q^\fA\ 
(because both [/, ^ + / A ] and \T, ^ + \ / I ] are in the class inverse 
to the class of [F, G -h V^]) in canonical form in which T is relatively prime 
to pF. What is to be shown is that Xp(-^) = Xp{f) whenever / ^ 0 mod 2^. 
This will be done by proving that if / ^ 0 mod p, then Xp{f) — Xp{E). 
Now [/F, Z + VA] = [f,g + V^][F, G + V I ] - [1] for z = ^ mod / and 
z = G mod F , so there are principal modules [v + uy/A] and [y + xy/A] such

that [v + u\fA][fF^ 
z + VA\ — [y^ xy/A][l]. 
Since there is a principal module 
[t + s v ^ ] for which [t + s\/]4]['^ + '?^v^] = [N] for some number TV (Proposition 
3 of Essay 3.3), one can assume without loss of generality that i^ = 0; that is, 
['L'][/F, z-\- \fA\ = [^ + x\/]4] where y^ > Ax^. Since this equation implies that 
a: = 0 mod v and y = zx mod vfF 
(see Essay 3.2), the equation can be divided 
by V to give one of the form [/F, z + \/]4] = [2/ + xy/A]. This equation implies 
that X is relatively prime to y (any common divisor divides the coefficient of 
VA 
in 2: -f y/A) and therefore that x is relatively prime to y'^ — ^x^, from 
which it follows that [y + xy/A] = [y'^ - Ax^, y + XVA] = [y'^ - Ax'^, p + y/A] 
for some p {x is invertible mod y"^ — Ax'^). Therefore fF 
= y^ — Ax^. 
Since 
A = 0 mod p and fF 
^ 0 mod p, it follows that fF 
= y'^ ^ 0 mod p. Thus 
Xpif) 
= XpifF'^) 
= Xpiy'^F) = Xp{F), as was to be shown. 
The proof of the analogous theorem for X4 in the case A = 3 mod 4 follows 
the same steps, except that one needs to prove that if fF = y'^ — Ax^ and 
fF 
is odd, then X4(/) = X^i^)- 
This follows easily from the observation that y 
and X must have opposite parity (because fF is odd), so one of the terms y'^ 
and —Ax"^ is 0 mod 4 and the other is 1 mod 4, resulting in XA.{fF) = 1, from 
which X4(/) = XA{F) follows. 
Theorem. 
Let p and q be distinct odd primes. 
Ifp=l 
mod 4, then Xq{p) = 
1 implies Xp{q) = ^- VP = ^ mod 4, then Xq{p) = 1 implies Xp{q) = X4(^). ^/ 
p = g = 3 mod 4, then Xp{q) = -Xg(p)-
Proof 
If Xg(p) = I5 there is a module [q,g -h y/p] ^ [1]. By the proposition, 
the value of XP{Q) depends only on the class of [g, g + ^yp]. The kernel of the 
homomorphism defined by Xp froni the class group to the group with two 
elements is either a subgroup of index two or it is the whole group. 
When p = 1 mod 4, Theorem 4 of the preceding essay states that the class 
group has no element of order two. Therefore, the group has odd order (see 
Essay 5.2), so it can have no subgroup of index two, which implies that the 
kernel is the whole group, so Xq{p) — 1 implies Xpio) = 1, as was to be shown. 
When p ~ 3 mod 4, on the other hand, the class group contains a single 
element of order two, so the operation of squaring is a two-to-one homomor-
phism from the class group to itself whose image is a subgroup of index two. 
This subgroup is necessarily the kernel of the homomorphism determined by 
Xp, because this kernel contains all squares but does not contain the class of 
[p — 1,1 + ^ ] , because Xp{P~^) 
= ~ 1 - The homomorphism determined by X4 
also has the subgroup of squares as its kernel, because its value for the class of 
[p, y/p] is XA{P) = —1- Therefore, these two homomorphisms are identical, and 
the statement to be proved—that Xq{p) ~ 1 implies Xpio) = 
X4:{Q)—follows. 
When p = q = 3 mod 4 one finds in a similar way that if either XP{Q) 
or Xq{p) is 1, then the other is —1, but the possibility that both might be 
— 1 remains. Consider the class group in the case A — pq. By Theorem 4 
of the last essay, the class group in this case has a single element of order 
2, so the squares form a subgroup of index two, as before, that is obviously 

106 
3 Some Quadratic Problems 
contained in the kernel of the homomorphisms from the class group to the 
group with two elements that are determined by either Xp or Xq- I^ f^ct, since 
the class of [pg — 1,1 + -y/pq] is not in either kernel, these homomorphisms have 
the same kernel—the subgroup of squares—and are therefore identical. The 
stable modules [1], [p,-y/pq]^ [Q^ y/PO]^ ^^^ [PQ^ y/Pol ^^^ partitioned between 
the two ambiguous, primitive cycles. Since [1] is in the principal cycle and 
Ipq, y/pq\ is not (one step of the comparison algorithm shows that [pg, y ^ ] ^ 
[pg — 1,1 + y/p^]), exactly one of [p, >Jpq\ and [g, yjpq\ is in the kernel of the 
homomorphism in question, which is to say that exactly one of Xg(p) ^^^ 
XP{Q) is 1, as was to be shown. 
The Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. 
If p and q are distinct odd primes, 
then XP{Q) = Xq{p) unless p = q = 3 mod A, in which case XP{Q) — ~Xq{v)-
Proof. The last statement is of course part of the previous theorem. 
Since Xp(^) = — 1 is the negation of Xpio) — 1? the statement that XP{Q) — 
Xq{p) is the statement that Xpio) = 1 if and only if Xq{p) — 1-
Whenp = g = 1 mod 4, the theorem proves that Xq{p) — 1 implies XP{Q) — 
1, and the desired conclusion follows by symmetry. 
When p = 1 mod 4 and g = 3 mod 4, the theorem proves that Xq{p) — 1 
implies XP{Q) — 1 ^^d that XP{Q) — 1 implies Xq{p) ~ XA{P) — 1^ ^s was to be 
shown. 
Evaluation of XP(2). 
If P is an odd prime, Xp(2) — ^ if ctnd only if p ^ 
±1 mod 8. 
Proof Consider the class group in the case A = S. It has two elements, the 
class of [7,1 + V^] and the principal class. An odd prime p satisfies Xp(2) = 1 
if and only if it satisfies Xp(8) = 1^ which is true if and only if there is a 
module [p, g ^ ^/S] ^ [1] for some g. When this is the case, either [p^g + VS] 
or [p, q -h v^] [7,1 H- VS] is principal, which implies (unless p = 7) that either 
p or 7p is of the form y'^ — Sx'^ and therefore that p = ±1 mod 8. 
If p = 1 mod 8, then either [8,1 + y/p] or [8, 5 + ^ ] is primitive (because 
if (p— l)/8 is even, then |p — 25|/8 is odd). The homomorphism from the class 
group to ±1 determined by Xp is trivial (since p = 1 mod 4, the class group 
has no element of order 2), so Xp(8) = 1 and Xp(2) = 1-
Finally, if p = 7 mod 8, then the last two of the four pivotal modules 
[1, ^ ] , [2,1 + v^], [p, y/p], and [ ^ , l-\-^/p] are not principal—[p, ^ ] because 
it is equivalent to [p — 1,1 + y^], for which Xp{P~ 1) = ""I? and [^y^, 1 + y/p] 
because X4(^y^) = — 1- Therefore [2,1 + -y/p] must be principal, which implies 
that [2,1 + v^] = [^ + x^], 
where 2 = y^ - px\ Thus, Xp(2) = Xpiv^) = 1, 
as was to be shown. 
Let X8 denote the function that assigns the value 0 to even numbers, the 
value 1 to numbers congruent to ±1 mod 8, and the value —1 to numbers 
congruent to ±3 mod 8, so that Xp(2) is Xsip) for all odd primes p.

Essay 3.6 Gauss's Composition of Forms 
The structure of Gauss's Disquisitiones 
Arithmeticae 
suggests that the original 
purpose of his theory of composition of forms was to put the law of quadratic 
reciprocity in a setting that would make it seem clearer and more natural. 
In the first three sections of the book he introduces the elementary theory of 
congruences and proves the important theorem that there is a primitive root 
mod p for every prime p. In Section 4 he goes on to the statement and proof 
of what he calls the "fundamental theorem," essentially the law of quadratic 
reciprocity. His proof in Section 4 was described by H. J. S. Smith [60, Part 
1, Art. 18] as "repulsive to all but the most laborious students." Perhaps 
Gauss felt the same way about it, because he gave a second and altogether 
different proof in Section 5; in later years he gave other proofs, indicating 
that even then he was not satisfied that he had grasped the true basis of the 
phenomenon. 
It is misleading to think of Section 5 as just one of seven sections of the 
book, because in number of pages it is more than half of the book. A large 
part of it is devoted to the theory of "composition" of binary quadratic forms, 
which is used (Article 262) to prove the "fundamental theorem," but which is 
also used in the study of ternary forms and is studied for its own sake. Surely 
"composition" represents an early step in Gauss's quest for the deeper secrets 
of number theory. 
Section 5 had a profound effect on the development of number theory in 
the 19th century. Kummer's proof of his generahzed reciprocity law in mid-
century, a proof that was found only after years of intense effort, was directly 
inspired [47, p. 20 (700)] by Gauss's proof of quadratic reciprocity in Section 5. 
But beyond that, Section 5 was fundamental to the development of Dedekind's 
theory of "ideals" in the second half of the century, and in that way directly 
influenced the core ideas of modern abstract algebra. Moreover, the use of 
the structure of the group (without the name) of equivalence classes of binary 
quadratic forms in Section 5 (together with another implicit use of groups 
in Section 7) contributed to the development of the theory of groups. But 
perhaps the profoundest way in which Section 5 affected the development of 
mathematics lay in the challenge that it presented. Starting with Dirichlet, 
and continuing with Kummer, Dedekind, Kronecker, Hermite, and countless 
others, the unwieldy but fruitful theory of composition of forms called forth 
great efforts of study and theory-building that shaped modern mathematics. 
The "forms" in Gauss's theory are binary quadratic forms, which is to 
say that they are homogeneous polynomials (forms) of degree 2 (quadratic) in 
2 variables (binary) with integer coefficients. He used the notation ax'^-{-2bxy-i-
cy^ for such forms and, as this notation indicates, he only considered forms 
with even middle coefficients. Because I prefer not to impose this restriction, I 
have chosen different letters altogether and will denote binary quadratic forms 
by rx^ -f sxy + ty'^ ^ where x and y are the variables of the form and r, 5, and 
t are its integer coefficients. (In this essay and the next, I will do as Gauss 

Essay 3.6 Gauss's Composition of Forms 
109 
did and use integers instead of the numbers in the narrowest sense that were 
used in the other essays of Part 3.) I will also write the form as (r, 5, t) when 
the variables can remain unnamed. 
The notion of "composition" generalizes Brahmagupta's formula 
(x^ - Dy^){u^ - Dv'^) = X^ - DY'^ 
when X = xu-^ Dyv and Y = xv + yu 
(where D is a. fixed integer). Other examples are 
{x^ + xy + y^){u^ -huv-h v^) = X^ + XY-]-Y^ 
when X = xu — yv and Y = xv -{- yu -\- yv 
and 
(16x2 + 4xy - y'^){iu^ + 2uv - v'^) = 4X'^ + 6XY + F^ 
when X = Axu — 2xv — yu and Y = Axv -\- 2yu -\- yv. 
These formulas can be verified by the lengthy but simple process of per-
forming the prescribed substitutions for X and Y on the right and expanding 
to find that the resulting polynomial in x, ?/, u^ and v is indeed the product 
of the two polynomials on the left. 
In general, given two binary quadratic forms rx^ + sxy H- ty'^ and pv? + 
(juv-\-Tv'^ with integer coefficients, a third form RX'^ ^SXY^TY'^ 
is trans-
formable into their product (see Gauss's §235) if one can define X and Y to 
be sums of integer multiples of the monomials xu^ xv, yu, and yv in such a 
way that 
(ra^ + sxy + ty^){pu^ + 2auv + rv^) = RX'^ + SXY + T F ^ 
A form that is transformable into the product of two forms composes those 
forms if the six 2 x 2 minors of the 2x4 matrix of coefficients of the expressions 
of X and Y in terms of xu, xv, yu, and yv that effect the transformation 
have no common divisor greater than 1. (It is easy to check that the three 
formulas above are compositions. For example, the last formula shows that 
AX'^ + 6XY + y^ composes 16^^ + Axy — y'^ and 4tu^ + 2uv — v'^ because the 
minors of the matrix of coefficients 
4 - 2 - 1 0 
0 4 
2 1 
that effects the transformation are 16, 8, 4, 0, —2, and —1.) 
To modern ears, the phrase "composition of forms" suggests a binary op-
eration, assigning a composed form to each pair of given forms, but Gauss's 
compositions do not conform to this expectation. On the one hand, there 
may be no form that composes two given forms, while on the other hand, if 
some form does compose them, then infinitely many others also do,* because 
* Both the English and the German translations of the Disquisitiones wrongly 
translate the theorems of §236 and §249, among others, when they use definite 
articles rather than indefinite ones; the original Latin of course has no articles. 

110 
3 Some Quadratic Problems 
infinitely many others can be obtained by a unimodular change of vari-
ables in the composed form. Specifically, a matrix [^ 
^] with determinant 
1 can be used to define U and V as sums of multiples of xu^ xv, yu^ and yv 
by U = aX ^bY 
and V = cX -\- dY; then substitution of X = dU - bV 
and Y = —cU-\- aV in the known composition using X and Y produces a 
composition using U and V. 
It seems fair to say that Gauss's theory in its full generality is largely 
forgotten. When Andre Weil writes [63, p. 334] that Dirichlet "restored its 
original simplicity" he is overlooking the fact that Dirichlet composes only 
certain pairs of forms—pairs that are concordant or einig—and 
that Dirichlet 
justified this limitation by shifting all emphasis from the composition of forms 
to the composition of equivalence 
classes of forms, thus disregarding Gauss's 
success in developing the theory in the greatest possible generality. 
One could certainly argue that in this case Gauss's insistence on generality 
was excessive—that the purposes to which the theory is put are served just as 
well by the mere composition of equivalence classes, and that the classification 
of forms is so natural that the binary operation of composition of equivalence 
classes is a legitimate subject of study—but Gauss evidently disagreed. 
The technical demands of developing the theory in the way Gauss does 
are indeed formidable. This becomes clear from Gauss's very statement of 
what amounts to the associative law, not to mention the difficulty of proving 
the statement that if F composes 
f and f, 
if T composes 
F and f", 
if 
F' composes f and f", 
and if T' 
composes F' and f, 
then F and F' are 
properly 
equivalent 
(§240, where it is assumed that all forms enter directly 
into all compositions in the sense defined in Essay 3.7). 
The theory of multiplication of modules of hypernumbers resolves this con-
flict between the wish to preserve the full* generality of Gauss's theory and the 
wish to avoid its technical difficulties. Rummer's first paper [46, p. 324 (208)] 
on "ideal prime factors" mentions the possibility of applying his new theory 
to Gauss's—at least to justify Gauss's belief that the forms ax^ -\- 2bxy + cy'^ 
and ax'^ — 2bxy -\- cy^ should be considered to be inequivalent—but he never 
laid out the exact relation between the two theories. Similarly, Dedekind was 
well aware that Gauss's composition of forms was, in essence, the multipli-
cation of modules—"ideals" in his terminology—but he did not develop the 
correspondence in detail. Nor, as far as I know, has anyone since Dedekind. 
In all probability, the reason is that it was felt that Gauss's approach was a 
false start that could be disregarded and replaced with Dedekind's. But such 
an attitude has the great disadvantage that it destroys the access of modern 
readers to Gauss's classic. 
Essay 3.7 is meant to bridge the gap between the modern theory and 
Gauss's. On the one hand, modern readers will certainly see that the multipli-
cation of modules of hypernumbers is the multiplication of ideals in quadratic 
* In truth, Essay 3.7 does not preserve the full generality of Gauss's theory because 
it ignores forms (r, 5, t) for which 5^ — Art is a square. 

Essay 3.6 Gauss's Composition of Forms

number fields with the added technicahty of deahng not with all integers in 
the field but with what Dedekind called orders (Ordnungen) of integers in the 
field. On the other hand, as Essay 3.7 shows, multiplication of modules makes 
possible the complete description of Gauss's compositions in the sense that 
it solves the problem. Given two binary quadratic forms, determine whether 
they can he composed, and if so, find all possible compositions. In brief. Gauss 
himself showed that two forms can be composed if and only if they pertain to 
the same square-free integer (see Essay 3.7) and showed that knowledge of one 
composition implies knowledge of all, because any two differ by a unimodular 
change of variables. Thus, the problem is solved by Proposition 3 of Essay 
3.7, which describes how to use multiplication of modules to find an explicit 
composition of two given binary quadratic forms, provided they pertain to the 
same square-free integer.

Essay 3.7 The Construction of Compositions 
Binary quadratic forms with integer coefficients will be called "forms" in this 
essay. For simplicity, all forms will be assumed to be irreducible; in other 
words, forms (r, s,t) whose discriminants s^ — Art are squares are excluded.* 
Theorem. 
Given two forms, 
construct 
all forms that compose 
them. 
If {R,S,T) 
composes (r,s,t) 
and {p,a,r), 
then (—i?, — 5 , - T ) composes 
(—r, —5, —t) and (p, cr, r ) . Therefore, one can assume without loss of generality 
that r is nonnegative. Since s'^ — Art is not a square, r is positive in this case. 
Similarly, p can be assumed to be positive. 
The required construction is accomplished by the four propositions that 
follow. 
A form (r, s, t) will be said to pertain to a given square-free integer if its 
discriminant s^ — Art is a square times that integer. In this way, each form 
pertains to one and only one square-free integer. (An integer is square-free 
if it is not divisible by any square greater than 1.) The reducible forms that 
have been excluded from consideration are simply the forms that pertain to 
the square-free number 1 together with forms whose discriminant is zero. 
Proposition 1. 
If a form composes two others, then all three pertain to the 
same square-free 
number. 
Corollary. 
// two given forms pertain to different square-free integers, 
then 
no form composes 
them. 
Proof. Given are three forms (r, 5, t), (p, cr, r ) , and (R, 5, T) and a substitution 
X = poxu + pixv + p2yu + p^yv, 
Y = Qoxu + qixv + q2yu + qsyv, 
in which the 2 x 2 minors of the matrix of coefficients have no common divisor 
greater than 1, whose substitution in RX^ + SXY 
-\- TY^ 
results in (rx^ + 
sxy + ty'^){pu^ + GUV -h rv^). This last statement, when the coefficients of 
the various monomials x^u^, x'^v'^, . . . , xyuv are compared, amounts to nine 
equations: 
(1) 
Rpl^Spoqi^-^Tql^rp 
(2) 
Rpl^Spiqi^Tql^rr, 
(3) 
Rpl + Sp2q2 + Tql = tp, 
(4) 
Rpl + ^^3^3 + Tql = tr, 
(5) 
2Rpopi + S{poqi -^Piqo) + "^Tq^qi = ra, 
* Characteristically, Gauss does not exclude reducible forms, as is shown by the 
point he makes in §235 of avoiding the assumption that the first coefficients of 
his forms are nonzero. 

Essay 3.7 The Construction of Compositions 
113 
(6) 
2Rpop2 + S{poq2 + P2<7o) + 2Tgog2 = sp, 
(7) 
2Rpip3 + S{piq3 + PsQi) + 2Tgig'3 = sr, 
(8) 
2i^p2P3 + S{p2q3 + ^3^2) + 2Tg2^3 = ta, 
(9) 2R{pops + P1P2) + 5'(po93 + Pi92 + P2qi + P39o) + 2T(go^3 + ^1^2) = scr. 
Gauss's theory is based entirely on virtuosic algebraic deductions of general 
properties of transformations and compositions of forms from these nine equa-
tions. 
His very first step is to subtract 4 times the product of equations (1) and 
(2) from the square of (5). In the notation above, the result is 
(52 - 4RT){poqi 
- piqof 
= r\a^ 
- 
Apr). 
The right side is obvious; the left is not, but a little work with pencil and 
paper will confirm it. 
Since r > 0 and cr^ — 4pr is not a square, this equation shows that p^qi 
/ 
Pigo, so (p, G^ T) and (JR, 5, T) pertain to the same square-free integer, namely, 
the integer obtained by dividing (5^ — 4RT){poqi 
— PiqoY — '^'^{^'^ — 4pT) by 
its largest square factor. By the symmetry of the definition of composition, 
{r,s^t) 
and (i?, S', T) must also pertain to the same square-free integer, and 
the proposition is proved.* 
The content c of a form (r, s,t) 
is the greatest common divisor of its 
coefficients. 
Proposition 2. 
Let (r, s,t) and {p^a^r) 
be forms 
for which s^ — 4rt 
= 
a'^ — Apr and for which s and a are even, say s = 2s' and a = 2a'. In this 
case, s'^—Art = a'^—Apr — AA, where A = {s')'^—rt — {a'^—pr 
is not a square 
(by assumption). 
Let the module [r, s' + VA][p,a' 
-h VA] be put in 
canonical 
form, say it is [E][F,G + VA], and let H be defined to be (G^ - A)/F. 
Then 
a multiple of (F, 2G, H) composes (r, s, t) and (p, a, r ) . The specific 
multiplier 
is determined 
by the rule that the content of the composed form is the product 
of the contents 
of its ^factors, '^ 
(The theory of modules of hypernumbers was developed in the earlier 
essays only in the case in which A is a positive, nonsquare integer. Its extension 
to the case in which A is negative presents no difficulties at all. Therefore, 
forms with negative discriminants can be included in this proposition.) 
Proof 
The actual substitution that accomplishes the composition is given 
implicitly by the formula 
(10) (rx + {s' + VA)y^ 
(^pu + {a' + VA)V^ 
= E (FX 
+ ( G 4- \ / I ) y ) . 
* By doing a good deal more algebraic work, Gauss proves Proposition 1—his "first 
consequence"—also in the case r — 0. 

114 
3 Some Quadratic Problems 
Multiplication of this equation by its conjugate (the equation obtained by 
changing \/~k to — A/A) gives 
((rx + s'yf - V ) ({pu + o'vf - Av''\ = E^ ({FX + GVf - AY^) , 
or, what is the same, 
rp{rx^ + sxy + ty^){pu^ + auv + rv'^) = E^F{FX'^ + 2GXY + ijy^). 
Thus, the substitution imphcitly defined by (10) transforms FX^ + 2^X1^ + 
HY"^ times E'^F/rp into the product {rx'^ ^ sxy -\- ty'^){pu^ -\- auv -\- rv'^). This 
is the multiple of (F, 2G, H) described in the proposition. What is to be shown 
is that (1) the coefficients of the substitution implicitly defined by (10) are 
integers, that (2) c^ == '^r^C', where c, 7, and C are the contents of (r, 5,t), 
(p, cr, r), and (F, 2G, H) respectively, and that (3) the greatest common divisor 
of the six 2 X 2 minors of the matrix of coefficients of the substitution is 1. 
Comparison of the coefficients of y/A on the two sides of (10) shows that 
rxv -\- pyu -\- {s' ^ a')yv = EY^ after which a comparison of the remaining 
terms shows that rpxu + ra'xv + ps'yu + {s'a' + A)yv = EFX -\- G{rxv + 
pyu + (s' + a')yv). Therefore, the matrix of coefficients of the substitution 
determined by (10) is

That the entries of this matrix are integers can be seen as follows: 
By definition, [r, s' + y/A][p, cr' + v ^ ] = [E][F, G + VA]. Thus, F, F, and 
G are found by putting [rp, ra' + r^/A, ps' + p v ^ , s'a' -\- A^ {s' + G')\fA\ in 
canonical form. Let A, i3, and C be integers for which Ar -^ Bp -\- C{s' + a') 
is the greatest common divisor of r, p, and {s' -\- a'); call it d. Clearly, d 
divides both coefficients of all four numbers in the product module [rp, ra' + 
ryJ~A,ps'-\-p\fA,s'a'^A^-[s'^a')\fA\ 
with the possible exception oi s'a' ^A, 
and d divides this coefficient as well because A = [s'Y mod r, so s'a' -\- A = 
{s'a' + {s')'^) = s'{a' -f 5') = 0 mod d. Let GQ be defined by the equation 
6/(Go + V I ) = A{ra' + r V I ) + B{ps' + pVI) + ^(sV' + A + (5' + a^ VI). 
Thend(Go+VI) is a sum of multiples of hypernumbers already in the product 
module, so it can be annexed to the list, and multiples of it can be subtracted 
from the previous entries to put the product module in the form [rp, ra' + 
r\fA, ps' + p\fA, s'a' + ^ + (5' + a')^/A, d{Go + VA)] = [rp, ra' - rGo, ps' -
pGo, s'a' + A-{s'^ 
a')GQ, d{Go + VA)]. This module is [dFo, d{Go + VI)], 
where by definition [dFo] = [rp, ra' — rGo, ps' — pGoj s'a' -\- A — {s' ^ a')Go]-
(Note that all entries in the module on the right are divisible by d.) In short, 
[F][F, G + VA] = [(i][Fo, Go + V~A]- By the uniqueness of canonical form, it

follows that E = d^ F = FQ, and G = Go mod F , provided it is shown that 
Gl = AmodFo. 
Let a representation of a module be called full if VA times any hy-
pernumber in the list can be written as a sum of integer multiples of hy-
pernumbers in the list. If g^ = A mod / , then [f,g + \/A] is full, because 
fVA 
= -gf 
+ f{g + y/A) and {g + VA)y/A 
= qf + g{g + v ^ ) , where q 
is defined by q = {A — g'^)/f. 
Thus, the representation of any module in 
canonical form is full. A product of full representations is full, and any rep-
resentation obtained from a full representation by adding one hypernumber 
in the list to another or subtracting one from another is full, and the same 
is true for the operations of rearranging or of annexing to or deleting from 
the list a zero entry. Therefore, [dF^^dGo + d\fA\ is full, which implies that 
[dGo + dy/A)y/A 
= m • dFo + n • {dGo + d\/^) 
for integers m and n, which 
implies dGo = ^d and dA = mdFo-\-ndGo 
= mdFo-\-dG^^ 
so A = G^ mod FQ, 
as was to be shown. 
The identity E = d shows that the entries in the last row of the substitution 
matrix are integers. The identity EF = dFo shows that [EF] = [rp^ra' — 
rGo^ps' 
— pGo, s'a' -\- A — {s' -{- CF')GO] and therefore shows, because dGo = 
dG mod dF^ that the entries in the first row of the substitution matrix are 
integers. 
By direct computation, the six 2 x 2 minors of this matrix of coefficients are 
seen to be - ^ ^ times r, p, s' -\-G'^ G' — S', T, and t. Thus, the greatest common 
divisor of the six minors is 1 if and only if \E^F\ = \rp\ [r, p, s' ^a' ^a' — s' ^r^ t]. 
That this is the case can be proved as follows: 
It was seen above that \EF\ — \dFo\ is the greatest common divisor of rp, 
ra' — rGo, ps' — pGo-, and s'a' + A — (5' + o'^Go^ so what is to be shown is 
that 
\E\\rp,rG'-rGo.ps'-pGo.s'o 
^A-{s'^G')GO\ 
= 
\rp\\r,p,s'^G',G'-s',T,t\. 
The first three terms on the right—r^p, rp^ and rp(^s'^G'^—are 
all divisible by 
Erp and are therefore zero modulo the module on the left. That the remaining 
terms on the right are zero modulo the module on the left follows from the 
identities 
rpio' - s') = I • E{ra' - rGo) - ^ • E{ps' - pGo), 
rpT = 
^-^ 
• E{ra' - rGo) - ^ • E{s'a' + A-{s' 
+ 
a')Go), 
rpt = ^
^ 
• E{ps' - pGo) - ^ • E{s'a' 
+ A-{s' 
+ 
a')Go). 
On the other hand, the four terms in the module on the left are zero 
modulo the module on the right by virtue of 
Erp = Ar'^p + Brp^ + Crp{s' + G'), 
E{G' 
-GO)=BP{G' 
-s')^CpT,

(The last three equations are found by eliminating one of A^ i3, and C from 
E^Ar-^Bp-^ 
C{s' + cj') and EGQ = Ara' + Bps' + C{s'cj' + A).) 
Only the equation c^rp = E'^FC of step (2) remains to be proved. As was 
shown in the proof of Theorem 3 of Essay 3.4, if [/, ^ + VA] is in canonical 
form, then [f^g^^][fJ-g^^/A] 
= [f][d,g^y^], 
where [d] - [/, 2^, ^
]
. 
Thus, since [c] = [r, 2s',t], the product of [r^s' + VA] with its conjugate is 
[r][c^ s^-{-yA\. 
In the same way, the product of [p, a^ -\-V~A\ with its conjugate is 
[p] [7, cr' + \/]4], and the product of [F, G + A/Z] with its conjugate is [F] [C, G + 
/ A ] . Therefore, multiplication of [r, s' + \ / l ] [p, cr' + 7 1 ] = [E] [F, G + A/A] by 
its conjugate gives the equation [rp][c, s' + V^][7, cr' + ^/A] = [F^F][G, G + 
\/]4]. Since 5' = —s' mod c, cr' = —a' mod 7, and G = —G mod G, all modules 
in this last equation are self-conjugate, so the product of this equation with its 
conjugate is simply [r^p^] [c] [c, s' + VA] [7] [7, a' -h 7 1 ] = [F^F^] [G] [G, G + \ / I ] . 
Replacement of [rp] [c, 5' + VA] [7, a' + ^/A] with [F^F] [G, G -f / A ] on the left 
side of this equation gives [rpnE^F][C,G 
+ ^/A] = [E^F^C][C,G 
^ ^/A]• 
Reduction of G mod G puts both sides in canonical form, so rpc^E'^F 
= 
E^F'^C, 
from which the desired equation rpcj = E^FC 
follows. 
Proposition 3. 
Given two forms pertaining 
to the same square-free 
integer, 
construct 
a form that composes 
them. 
Proof 
Let (r, 5,t) and (p^a^r) 
be the given forms. Because they pertain to 
the same square-free integer, positive integers m and p can be chosen to make 
w?{s'^ — Art) = p'^{a^ — Apr). Moreover, because m and p can be doubled, 
if necessary, one can assume without loss of generality that ms and pa are 
even. Proposition 2 then constructs a form, call it (F, 2G, H), that composes 
{mr, ms, mt) and {pp, pa, pr) whose content is the product of the contents 
of {m.r,m.s,mt) 
and {p.p,pa,pr). 
Therefore, F , 2G, and H are all divisible 
by m/i, and the same substitution that gives (F, 2G, H) as a composition of 
{mr, ms, mt) and {pp, p.a, pr) gives f ^ , ^ , ^ j as a composition of (r, s, t) 
and {p, a, r ) , as was to be constructed. 
It remains to find all compositions of two given forms that pertain to 
the same square-free number. The compositions constructed by Proposition 
2—and therefore those constructed by Proposition 3—contain both forms di-
rectly in the sense Gauss defines that term, which is to say that the first two 
of the six minors, the minors poQi — PiQo and poq2 — P2(lo^ are both positive. 
(These minors are the positive integers r'^p/E'^F 
and rp^/E'^F.) 
More gener-
ally, the first form (r, s, t) enters directly if po92 —P2Q0 is positive, inversely 
if it is negative. (As was seen in the proof of Proposition 1, it cannot be zero.) 
Whether {p,a,r) 
enters directly or inversely is similarly determined by the 
sign of poQi — piQo- Since reversing the sign of y changes (r, s,t) to (r, — s, t) 

Essay 3.7 The Construction of Compositions

and changes the signs in the last two columns of the matrix of coefficients of 
the substitution while leaving everything else unchanged, it changes a com-
position in which (r, 5, t) enters directly into one in which it enters inversely 
and vice versa. Similarly, a composition in which (p, cr, r) enters directly can 
be changed into one in which it enters inversely and vice versa. In this way, 
all compositions of (r, 5, t) and (yo, cr, r) can be found by finding one composi-
tion of each of the four combinations of (r, ±5, t) and (p, zbcr, r) in which both 
forms enter directly and applying the final proposition: 
Proposition 4. 
Given one composition 
of a pair of forms 
in which 
both 
forms enter directly, every other such composition 
is obtained by a 
unimodular 
change of variables. 
Proof. Let the given forms be (r, s, t) and (p, a, r) and let the given compo-
sition RX^ 
+ SXY 
+ TY^ 
be effected by the substitution whose matrix of 
coefficients is 
TPO P I P2 P 3 
L^o qi q2 qs-
Let Aij be the six 2 x 2 minors of this matrix, where 0 < i < j < 3 and 
^ij 
~ Piqj ~ Pjqi- It is given that AQI and Z\o2 are positive. It is to be shown 
that any other composition matrix for the same two forms in which AQI and 
Z\o2 are both positive can be obtained by multiplying the given matrix on the 
left by a 2 X 2 matrix of integers whose determinant is 1. 
Every composition is accomplished, as was seen in the proof of Proposition 
3, by a substitution that accomplishes the composition of two forms with the 
same discriminant. In this case, the formulas (l)-(9) above imply, as Gauss 
proves in §235, that A^^ = r^, Z\oi(^03 - ^12) = rs, A01A23 = rt, A\^ = p^, 
AQ2{AQ2, + ^12) = per, and Z\o2^i3 = P^- (These are Gauss's equations (12)-
(14) and (18)-(20) when use is made of his identity A^ — dd'.) 
Since it is given that zioi > 0, the first equation determines Z\oi, after 
which the next two equations determine Z\o3 — A12 and Z\23- Similarly, the 
remaining three equations determine AQ2^ ^ 0 3 + ^ 1 2 , and Z\i3. In short, in any 
two compositions of the same forms (in which both forms enter directly), the 
six 2 X 2 minors of the matrix of coefficients of the substitution are 
identical. 
Then, as the elementary lemma Gauss proves in §234 shows, one matrix can 
be obtained from the other by multiplication on the left by a matrix of integers 
with determinant 1, as was to be shown. 
Example: Compose (16,4,-1) and ( 4 , 2 , - 1 ) . The discriminants of these 
forms are 80 and 20, respectively, so both pertain to 5. Multiply the second by 
2 so that the problem is to compose (16,4, —1) and (8,4, —2) with discriminant 
80. By Proposition 2, the composed form is computed by putting the product 
[16, 2 + \/20] [8, 2 H- \/20] in canonical form. The computation of this canonical 
form is [128,32 + 16^20,16 + 8^20, 24 + 4^20] - 
[4] [32,4 + 2A/20, 6 + ^20] = 
[4][32,24,6 + v ^ ] 
= [4][8,6 + A/20]. Thus, £; = 4, F = 8, G = 6, so 

118 
3 Some Quadratic Problems 
H = {6^ - 20)/8 = 2 and some multiple of (8,12,2) composes (16,4,-1) 
and (8,4,-2). The product of the contents 1 and 2 of the "factors" is the 
content 2 of (8,12,2), so this form itself composes (16,4, —1) and (8,4, —2). 
Division by 2 then implies that (4,6,1) composes the given forms (16,4, —1) 
and (4, 2, —1). The matrix of coefficients that describes the substitution that 
accomplishes the composition is

as can be found either by evaluating the matrix entries or by solving the 
equation 
(^16x + (2 + V20) y^ (^Su + (2 + \/20) v^ =4 (^SX + (6 -i- \/2o) F ) 
for X and Y in terms of x, y, u^ and v. This is the third example of a 
composition given in Essay 3.6. 
In the composition just given, both forms enter directly. The same method 
gives 
"82 - 1 
r 
02 1 0 
as a matrix that describes a substitution giving (1, 0, —5) as a composition of 
(16, —4, —1) and (4, 2, —1) in which both forms enter directly. Reversing the 
sign of y then gives the substitution 
82 
1 - 1 
0 2 - 1 0 
which gives (1,0, —5) as a composition of (16,4, —1) and (4,2, —1) in which 
the first form enters inversely and the second enters directly. 
To find all compositions of (16,4, —1) and (4,2, —1), one would also find 
a composition in which the first entered directly and the second entered in-
versely, and a composition in which both entered inversely. Every composition 
of the two forms is then obtained from one of these four by a unimodular 
change of variables. 

The Genus of an Algebraic Curve 
Essay 4.1 Abel's Memoir 
It appears to me that if one wants to make progress in the study of math-
ematics one should study the masters and not the pupils.—Niels Henrik 
Abel, quoted from an unpublished source in [52, p. 138] 
Niels Henrik Abel's submission of his Memoire sur une propriete generale 
d'une class tres-etendue de fonctions transcendantes to the Paris Academy in 
October 1826 should have been a high point in the history of mathematics. 
Instead, it was a low point in the history of the Paris Academy. 
Abel, lonely and unknown, was temporarily in Paris thanks to a travel 
grant from the government of Norway, and he hoped to win recognition in 
the city that was then the mathematical capital of Europe. Unfortunately, he 
naively believed that recognition could be won by submitting a work of un-
deniable genius to Europe's leading mathematical institution. He did not un-
derstand that works of undeniable genius are inherently difficult to read, even 
for the most learned readers, and he did not understand that the members of 
Europe's leading mathematical institution would not devote the needed time 
and thought to the work of a 24-year-old mathematician who was unknown 
to them and who came from a country they had scarcely heard of. 
Of course, one of the famous men of the Academy might by some lucky 
accident have taken notice of the memoir long enough to realize that it was 
worth pursuing, but none did. In 1837, eight years after Abel's untimely death, 
the Norwegian scholars charged with publishing Abel's collected works applied 
to the Academy via the Norwegian government and its diplomatic represen-
tatives in Paris for a copy of the memoir—Abel had apparently not kept a 
copy for himself—but the effort did not succeed, and the memoir is absent 
from the first publication of Abel's works in 1839. Finally, the Academy did 
publish the memoir in 1841, making it available to eager readers like C. G. J. 
Jacobi for the first time. 

120 
4 The Genus of an Algebraic Curve 
Fig. 4.1. Abel. 
In the two and a half years Abel lived after submitting the memoir, he 
enjoyed a growing reputation based on his publications in Crelle's 
Journal, 
but he patiently awaited publication of the Paris memoir, believing it would 
ensure his fame. He even alluded to the memoir in one of his published works, 
piquing the curiosity and indignation of Jacobi, who read the allusion too 
late to write to Abel about it. That Abel's memoir remained unpubhshed 
in his lifetime* deprived him of the challenge and encouragement of readers' 
responses and therefore probably deprived mathematics of important further 
work. 
(Incredibly, the tragedy was repeated only three years after Abel died when 
Galois went to an early grave ignored by the same Paris Academy.) 
Abel's memoir deals with integrals of algebraic differentials, 
a topic that 
is not at all easy to understand from the point of view of naive geometry and 
integration along a curve. Because an algebraic differential like dx/^/l 
— x^ 
is "many-valued" and because, moreover, an integral of such a differential 
depends on choosing both a path and a constant of integration, modern readers 
* The last work Abel published was a brief note that contained a theorem from the 
memoir. Abel's biographer Oystein Ore says that the theorem of that last brief 
note is the theorem of the memoir [52, p. 219], but it is far short of the theorem 
in the introduction of the memoir that I am discussing in this essay and that I 
take to be, in Ore's phrase, "the main theorem from the Paris memoir." 

Essay 4.1 Abel's Memoir 
121 
may well despair of understanding even what Abel means by the sum of a finite 
number of integrals of a given algebraic differential, much less why questions 
about such sums might be interesting or significant. 
But there is another way to describe the main idea that makes better sense 
to modern readers and explains the main theorem of the memoir more clearly. 
Abel's "algebraic differentials" are differentials of the form /(x, y)dx^ where / 
is a rational function of two variables and where y is an "algebraic function" 
of X. The notion of an "algebraic function" has become a source of unease for 
modern readers because an algebraic function is normally "many-valued" and 
the property of being single-valued is the essence of the set-theoretic notion 
of a "function." But of course there are modern ways to deal with algebraic 
functions. One is to give the functions their own special domain; this is the 
source of the theory of Riemann surfaces. The other is to regard an "algebraic 
function" not as a function at all, but simply as an element of an algebraic 
function field, which is to say an algebraic field whose transcendence degree is 
positive (see Essay 2.2). The subject of Abel's memoir is algebraic functions 
of one variable, which is to say, in the terminology of Essay 2.2, elements of an 
algebraic field of transcendence degree 1. In other words, Abel is dealing with 
the field of rational functions on an algebraic curve defined over the rationals. 
The concept that I propose as an aid to understanding Abel's memoir is 
that of an algebraic variation of a set of points on an algebraic curve. Abel 
describes such a variation as the solutions of a pair of equations 
x{x,y) = 0, 
(9(x,i/,a,a',a'',...) = 0, 
where xi^^v) is the irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients, monic in 
y, that defines the algebraic curve under discussion, and 0{x, y, a) is an auxil-
iary polynomial in x and y whose coefficients a, a'^ a", ... are indeterminates. 
For each fixed value of the coefficients a, a', a"^ ... the pair of equations de-
termines a set of points {{xk^yk)} on the curve x — ^'> ^^^ ^s the coefficients 
vary, these points vary along the curve. A variation of points on the curve 
that can be generated in this way is an algebraic variation. 
Somewhat more precisely, let C^ denote the set of all A^-tuples of points 
on the curve C defined by xi^^v) = 0- An algebraic variation of a point of 
C^ is determined by choosing a 0{x^y^a) of the form 0{x^y,a) = ^OijX^y^, 
where the exponent pairs (i, j) are in some specified finite set. To say that 
0{x,y^a) = 0 at a particular point of the curve xi^^v) — 0 means that the 
parameters aij in 6 satisfy a certain (linear) condition. Choose values for the 
aij that make ^ = 0 at all A^ of the given points. There will be other points of 
;)^(x, 2/) = 0 where ^ = 0 for these values of a^j, say there are M of them. An 
allowable variation of the N given points is one that results when the CLri j are 
allowed to vary from their fixed values in such a way that the M additional 
zeros all remain at zero while the N original ones are allowed to move. For 
each point of C^, the points of C^ that can be reached from it by a sequence 
of algebraic variations lie on an algebraic subvariety of C^. 

122 
4 The Genus of an Algebraic Curve 
Abel probably had some geometric conception of such variations of sets 
of points on xi^^v) 
— O5 but exactly what it might have been can only be 
guessed. Today one would never discuss intersection points without first spec-
ifying an algebraically closed ground field, but Abel would probably not have 
thought of curves as ordered pairs of complex numbers in anything like the 
modern way. More likely, he would have just imagined sets of points of in-
tersection of an ordinary plane curve with an auxiliary curve and considered 
constraints on variations of the intersection points produced by varying the 
auxiliary curve. In modern terms, the number of constraints 
on the variation 
of A^ points of a curve is the codimension 
of the subvariety of algebraic varia-
tions within the AT-dimensional variety C^ of all variations. This codimension 
is very nearly the same as the genus of the curve, and whatever his geometric 
conception of the problem setting may have been, it is this number that Abel 
successfully investigated. 
In terms somewhat closer to Abel's, if /(a^, y)dx is an algebraic differential 
(which is to say, a rational function / on the curve C times the symbol dx), 
and if an infinitesimal algebraic variation of the points {{xk^Uk)} is performed, 
Abel asserts that the resulting variation of Yl f{^k^yk)dxk 
is a differential 
that can be expressed rationally 
in terms of the parameters aij and their 
differentials.* Thus, if the point (Pi, P25 • • • ? PN) can be moved to the point 
(Q15 Q25 • • • 5 QN) of C^ by an algebraic variation, then

is equal to the integral of a rational differential in the aij and can therefore 
be expressed in terms of elementary functions—logarithms and trigonometric 
functions, as well as rational functions—of the aij. 
Now let g be the codimension of the subvarieties of algebraic variations. 
Then N — g oi the points (Pi, P2, . . . , P/v) can be moved in arbitrary ways by 
an algebraic variation, provided the remaining g points move in such a way 
as to keep the new (P{, P2, . . . , Pj^) on the same subvariety. Thus, if O is a 
chosen base point on the curve C, there is an algebraic variation—or at least 
a succession of algebraic variations—of a point (Pi, P2, . . . , PN) of C^ 
that 
connects it to a point of C^ of the form (O, O , . . . , O, Qi, (52, • • • Qg)- Then

where E can be expressed in terms of elementary functions of the parameters 
of the variation. (The paths of integration are, of course, the ones determined 
by the algebraic variation from (O, O , . . . , O, Qi^ Q2, • • • Qg) to (Pi, P2, • • •, 
Pjv) that is assumed.) Thus, disregarding elementary functions, a sum of 
any number N of integrals of f{x^y)dx 
can be expressed as a sum of just g 
integrals, where g depends only on the differential / ( x , y)dx being integrated— 
and in fact depends only on the algebraic curve xi^^v) 
— 0 ^^ which the 
differential has its existence—not on N. 
This is the main theorem of Abel's Paris memoir. In Abel's own words, 
"The number of these conditions [the number g above] does not depend at 
all on the number of summands, but only on the nature of the particular 
integrands that one considers. Thus, for example, for an elliptic integrand this 
number is 1; for an integrand that contains no irrationalities but a radical of 
the second degree, under which the variable has degree at most six, the number 
of necessary conditions is 2, and so forth."* 
I have said above that the crucial number of conditions g is "roughly" 
the genus of the curve C. Abel's statement that ^ is 1 in the elliptic case, 
2 in case y^ is a polynomial of degree 5 or 6 in x, and so forth, of course 
suggests that g is connected to the genus and is the genus in many cases. It 
fails to be the genus only because Abel bases his variation of the points on 
the variation of parameters aij in functions of the form 0{x, V^ci) = J2 ^ij^^V^ 1 
which is not quite general enough and in some cases gives too large a value 
for g because it omits certain variations that deserve to be called algebraic 
variations. When 6 is instead taken to have the form 9{x^ 2/5 <^) = XI ^i^ii^i 
v) 
where the "functions" Oi[x^ y) are integral over x—which may reduce g because 
it may include more variations—g becomes the actual genus, as will be shown 
in Essay 4.6. 
In an effort to clarify Abel's statement, I have taken some liberties with the trans-
lation. His actual words were, "Le nombre de ces relations ne depend nullement 
du nombre des fonctions, mais seulement de la nature des fonctions particuliere 
qu'on considere. Ainsi, par exemple, pour une fonction elliptique ce nombre est 1; 
pour une fonction dont la derivee ne contient d'autres irrationalites qu'un radical 
du second degre, sous lequel la variable ne passe pas le cinquieme ou sixieme 
degre, le nombre des relations necessaires est 2, et ainsi de suite." His "fonctions" 
are the integrals above, and his "derivees" are the integrands. What he is calling 
"une fonction elliptique" is what is today called an elliptic integral.

Man sollte weniger danach strehen, die Grenzen der mathematischen Wis-
senschaften zu erweitern, als vielmehr danach, den bereits vorhandenen 
Stoff aus umfassenderen Gesichtspunkten zu betrachten. (One should strive 
less to extend the boundaries of the mathematical sciences and much 
more to treat the already available material from more comprehensive 
viewpoints.)—E. Study [24, p. 140] 
Euler stated his addition formula for elliptic integrals in a variety of ways, 
none of which shed enough light on the formula to suggest a generalization to 
other kinds of integrands. The great achievement of Abel's Paris memoir was 
to describe Euler's formula as the case ^ = 1 of a more general phenomenon. 
It is customary today to describe an elliptic curve by a formula of the 
form y'^ = x^ -f g2X -\- gs, in which ^2 and gs are rational numbers, called 
its "Weierstrass normal form." When the curve is written in this form, the 
"addition" or "group law" on the curve is described as follows: Let P and Q 
be given points on the curve, and let S be the third point in which the line 
through P and Q intersects the curve. (The curve, being a cubic, intersects a 
line in the xy-plane in three points when they are counted in the right way.) 
The sum R — P -\- Q oi P and Q is defined to be the third point in which 
the line through S and the point at infinity intersects the curve. (The lines 
through the point at infinity are the lines x = constant—these are the lines 
that intersect the curve in only two finite points—so R is the point whose x-
coordinate is the same as that of S and whose ^/-coordinate is the ^-coordinate 
of S with the sign reversed.) 
This construction is connected to the theorem of Abel's memoir in the 
following way: Let 0{x^ ?/, a, 6, c) = ax -h by -\- c. Algebraic variations of the 
given points P and Q are obtained by choosing initial values for a, 6, and 
c that make 6 zero at P and Q and allowing a, 6, and c to vary in such a 
way that the third point of intersection of the line with the curve, call it 5, 
remains fixed. In other words, the algebraic variations of the pair (P, Q) are 
the pairs of points (P^ Q') on the curve for which P', Q', and S are colinear. 
In particular, if a point O of the curve is chosen as the origin—or the identity 
of the group law—then the algebraic variation of (P, Q) that carries P to O 
carries Q to the third point R in which the line through O and S intersects 
the curve. When O is chosen to be the point at infinity, R is the point 
P^Q 
described above. 
Abel's point of view explains why this "addition" is useful and shows 
that it is intrinsic to the curve. According to Abel, for any rational function 
f{x,y) 
of X and 2/ = \/x^~T^^xT^, the sum f^ f{x,y)dx 
+ f^ 
f{x,y)dx 
can be expressed in terms of integrals of rational functions, or, what is the 
same, /^ /(x, y)dx + /Q f{x,y)dx 
= J^ /(x, y)dx plus an integral of rational 
functions. In particular, in the special case /(x, y) = ^,in which the integrand 
is holomorphic in the sense explained in Essay 4.6, the formula is

which is one form of Euler's addition theorem. More precisely, these integrals 
depend on the paths of integration, and for the formula to hold, these paths 
must be chosen correctly. Thus, the sum of two integrals of dx/y can be 
expressed as just one integral of the same integrand, provided the limits of 
integration satisfy a certain algebraic relation and the paths of integration are 
chosen correctly. 
Once it is known that two such integrals can be reduced to one, it follows 
that any number of such integrals can similarly be reduced to one. Abel's 

126 
4 The Genus of an Algebraic Curve 
construction describes this all at once, rather than as a step-by-step reduction. 
An algebraic variation of a set of points (Pi, P2, . •., PN) on the curve is 
described by a function 6{x,y,a) 
of the form ^aijx'^y^ 
for some selection of 
exponent pairs (i, j ) . Since y^ is a polynomial in x^ it is natural to assume 
that all of the chosen values of j are less than 2, so that 9 takes the form 
01 (x) + (/)2(x)y, where (j)i and 02 are polynomials in x containing terms of 
certain specified degrees whose coefficients are indeterminates an and a^2. 
The procedure is to give 0 enough terms that values can be chosen for the 
parameters aij that make 0 zero at the given points Pi, P2, . . . , PN , and then 
to allow the parameters to vary from their chosen values in such a way that 
the value of 6 remains at zero for the zeros of 0 other than Pi, P2, . . . , PAT, 
while the A^ given zeros of 6 are allowed to vary. The main question is. How 
many conditions are imposed on the variation of the A^ points along the curve 
by the requirement that the variation be describable in this way? That the 
answer is 1—that the genus of this curve is 1—can be seen in the following 
way. 
The crucial step is to determine the number of zeros oi 6{x^y) = 01 (x) + 
(j)2{x)y on the curve. A simple way to do this is to make use of the idea that a 
rational function on an algebraic curve assumes each value the same number 
of times, when they are counted properly, and in particular that the number 
of zeros is equal to the number of poles. The function x assumes every value 
twice, and in particular, it has a double pole at the one point where x = CXD. 
The function ?/, on the other hand, assumes every value three times and has a 
triple pole at the one point where x = cx). (These statements can be justified in 
various ways, but since they are used here only as heuristic devices, no formal 
justification will be given.) It follows that a polynomial 0(J:) of degree u has 
2u poles, all of them at the point where x = 00, and that <p{x)y has 2z/ + 3 
poles, all at that same point. Consequently, if 0i(x) has degree v and 02(^) 
has degree z^ —2, then 0{x^ y) = (j)i{x)-\-(j)2{x)y has 2z/ poles, so it also has that 
number of zeros. Since 0i has z/ -h 1 variable coefficients and 02 (^) has z^ — 1, 
9 has 2iy coefficients. If 2i/ > A/', the A^ conditions on the 2iy coefficients of 9 
imposed by the requirement that 9 be zero at A^ given points can be satisfied 
by some choice of 9. Since 9 has 2z/ zeros, it has 2u — N zeros other than the 
A" required ones, and the algebraic variations of the A" given points are found 
by varying the 2v coefficients of 9 in such a way that these 2u — N extra zeros 
remain as zeros. The 2iy — N conditions stating that 9 must have these zeros 
are independent, 
so the coefficients of 9 then vary with 2iy — {2v — N) = N 
degrees of freedom. However, multiplication of ^ by a constant does not change 
its zeros, so varying the coefficients of 9 with A" degrees of freedom varies its 
zeros with only A^ — 1 degrees of freedom. In short, an algebraic variation of 
A' given points moves them in only A' — 1 different directions, which is to say 
that algebraic variations satisfy one constraint in this case. Otherwise stated, 
algebraic variations describe subvarieties of codimension 1 in C^. 
This description of the phenomenon is in no way tied to the Weierstrass 
normal form. Gauss alludes indirectly to the elliptic curve 7/^ = 1 — x^ in the 

Essay 4.2 Euler's Addition Formula 
127 
introduction to Section 7 of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae when he mentions 
the transcendental functions related to integrals of dx/y/l — x^. Euler too 
dealt with the curve y'^ — 1 — x^ [26], for which explicit and beautiful formulas 
can be developed for the addition law, and it is clear from Abel's published 
papers that this particular curve is one that he studied intensely. To require 
that it be put in Weierstrass normal form before the group law is described 
loses certain symmetries that deserve to be kept. But the above heuristic 
derivation of the fact that a curve in Weierstrass normal form has genus 1 
also proves that y^ = 1 — x^ has genus 1, because in this case x is CXD at two 
points, both of them simple poles, whereas y has double poles at these points 
((^)^ = {'^Y~^ is finite when X — oc), so 0{x,y) = 01 (x)+02(x)2/has a z/-fold 
pole at each—and therefore 2iy zeros—when deg(/)i = z/ and deg(j)2 = v — 2. 
Again the number of parameters in such a function 0i(x) + (t>2{x)y is 2z^, 
and the same arguments then show that the algebraic variation of N points 
on the curve moves them with only A^ — 1 degrees of freedom and therefore 
determines subvarieties of C^ of codimension 1. 
In the same way, Abel's construction generalizes the Euler addition formula 
to any curve C for which the algebraic variations describe subvarieties of C^ 
of codimension 1. If (Pi, P25 • • • 5 PN) is moved to (O, O,... ,0,R)

where E' is a quantity that can be expressed in terms of integrals of rational 
functions. (Moreover, E is zero when the integrand is holomorphic in the sense 
defined in Essay 4.6. This is true, as will be shown, of the integrand dx/y for 
curves in Weierstrass normal form or for the curve y^ = 1 — x^.)

4 The Genus of an Algebraic Curve 
Essay 4.3 An Algebraic Definition of the Genus 
Modern treatments of the genus of a curve normally describe it in terms of the 
topology of the associated Riemann surface. Therefore, modern mathemati-
cians are usually amazed to learn that the idea stems from Abel, who lived 
and worked at a time when even the notion of a complex function of a complex 
variable was in its early infancy and the notion of a Riemann surface was still 
in the future. (Riemann surfaces first appeared in Riemann's dissertation [57] 
of 1851.) But as the discussion in the preceding essay shows, Abel's point of 
view does not depend on complex numbers. 
The geometric picture of N points on the curve varying with N ~ g de-
grees of freedom that was presented in the preceding essays does depend on 
complex numbers, because the coordinates of the intersection points defined 
by X = 0, ^ = 0 exist only in some algebraically closed field, and the notion of 
continuous variation requires something like real numbers. But the actual de-
termination of the genus depends on purely algebraic considerations, at least 
in the examples of the preceding essay. All that is needed is to construct, for a 
large number z/, a formula 6{x,y,a^a\a'\ 
...) for the most general "function" 
in the field that has poles only at points where x = oc and no longer has poles 
at those points when it is divided by x^ (although this division will probably 
cause it to have poles at x = 0). The genus g is determined by the condition 
that the number of zeros of ^ is ^f — 1 greater than the number of arbitrary 
constants in the formula for 0. 
Of course elements of a function field are not really functions in the usual 
sense, so they do not really have zeros and poles, and the condition that an 
element have poles only where x = cxo is far from rigorous. Therefore, this 
description of the genus needs more explanation. Starting with the field of 
rational functions on an algebraic curve xi^^u) 
— 0—which is simply the root 
field of a monic, irreducible polynomial x(x, y) in y with coefficients in Z[x]— 
one needs to define what it means to say that an element 6 of the field has no 
poles where x is finite and that 6/x^ has no poles where 1/x is finite, and then 
one needs to determine how many zeros such a 0 has and how many arbitrary 
constants there are in the formula for the most general such 0. 
The idea of an element 0 having no poles where x is finite has a standard 
algebraic formulation: An element 0 of the field of rational functions on a 
curve x(x,2/) = 0 is integral over x if some power of 9 is equal to a sum 
of multiples of lower powers in which the multipliers are elements of the ring 
Q[x] of polynomials in x with rational coefficients.* The justification of this 
* One could also use the more restrictive, but perhaps more natural, definition in 
which the multipliers are required to be in Z[x]. Then an element would be integral 
over X in the sense defined above if and only if some integer multiple of it was 
integral in the more restrictive sense. Since | is certainly a "function" without 
poles, the definition given above is the one that describes "rational functions 
without poles" on an algebraic curve.

definition is, in the last analysis, pragmatic—it works in the sense that it 
suggests correct theorems and is useful in proofs. 
(The analogous definition of an algebraic integer in an algebraic number 
field^—see Essay 2.5—emerged in the work of Kronecker and Dedekind in the 
1860s and 1870s. Bourbaki [6] claims it is in the work of Eisenstein as early as 
1852, but I do not find it there. Kronecker [38, §1] used the above definition 
of integrality over x of an "algebraic function" in his study of function fields, 
but as far as I have found he does not explain or motivate it.) 
It is easy to see that the elements of the field of rational functions on 
x{x,y) 
that are integral over x form a ring in the field and that this ring 
contains Q[a:].''" 
If 0 is integral over x, then dividing an equation that demonstrates its 
integrality, say 9^ — ai{x)6^~^ 
+ • • • + CLn{x), by x'^^ for fi larger than the 
maximum degree of the ai{x) shows that 6/x^ is integral over 1/x for all such 
values oi fi} The order of ^ at x = oo is by definition the smallest u for which 
0/x^ is integral over 
1/x. 
Let 0{x^) 
denote the elements 0 of the field of rational functions on 
x{x,y) 
= 0 that are integral over x and have order at most v where a: = oc. 
The goal is to find a formula for the most general element 0 of 0{x^), 
and to 
compare the "number of zeros" of 0 to the "number of arbitrary constants it 
contains." 
The "number of zeros" of such a 0 has a very plausible meaning. By as-
sumption, xi^^y) 
is monic in y, say of degree n in y. Then the values of y 
for a given x are the roots of a monic polynomial of degree n, so there are 
n of them, counted with multiplicities. For this reason, there are n points on 
the curve for each x, so x assumes each value exactly n times on the curve, 
counted with multiplicities. For this reason, it is reasonable to take the view 
that X also assumes the value oc exactly n times—that x has n poles on the 
' If Zi^ can be expressed as a sum of multiples of lower powers of zi in which the 
multipliers are in Q[a:], and 2;^^ can be expressed as a sum of multiples of lower 
powers of Z2 in which the multipliers are in Q[x], then every polynomial in zi 
and Z2 with coefficients in Q[x] can be expressed as a sum of multiples of zlz2 
with coefficients in Q[x], where i < ni and j < n2- Therefore, multiplication by 
any such polynomial in zi and Z2—in particular multiplication by zi + Z2 and 
Z1Z2—can be represented by the nin2 x nin2 matrix of elements of Q[x] that 
gives its effect on these nin2 monomials z{z2' Therefore, since the polynomial in 
zi and Z2 is a root of the (monic) characteristic polynomial of this nin2 x nin2 
matrix by the Cay ley-Hamilton theorem, zi -\- Z2 and Z1Z2, and, in the same way, 
all polynomials in zi and Z2 with coefficients in Q[x], are integral over x. 
* Note that x(a:,y)/x'^ has the form xi(l/x,2//x'^), where xi is irreducible with 
integer coefficients and monic in its second variable, when K, is large enough, and 
that X and y can be expressed rationally in terms oi u = 1/x and v = y/x^, 
so 
the field of rational functions on xi^^v) 
— 0 can also be regarded as the field of 
rational functions on the curve xi(^5 ^) = 0. To say that an element of this field 
is integral over 1/x means, of course, that it is integral over u. 

130

curve, counted with multiphcities. Therefore, x^ has n poles of order v for a 
total of nu poles. Since 6 has the same poles as x^ (except when 6 is in the 
subset of 0{x^) containing "functions" that have fewer than the maximum 
number of poles allowed, which is sparse in 0(x^)), it follows that 0 should be 
regarded as having nu poles; reversing the above reasoning then leads to the 
conclusion that 0 assumes each value nu times, including the value zero. In 
short, it is plausible to take nu to be the number of zeros of a typical element 
of6)(x^). 
This analysis of the number of zeros of a typical element of 0{x^) for 
large u overlooks, however, a phenomenon that is exhibited by the example 
x{x,y) = (x^+2/^)^—2(x+?/)^. The field of rational functions on this "curve"— 
2 , 
2 
the root field of this xi^iU)—contains 
the element ^ ^ 
, which is a root of 
X^ — 2 (by definition, the square of x^ + y^ is 2{x -\- yY). Therefore, it is 
reasonable to let \/2 denote this element of the field. Then xi^^v) — (^^ + 
T/-^ —\/2(x + 2/))(x^+7/^ + \/2(x + y)), which shows that the field is an extension 
of degree two, not four, of the field of rational functions in x with coefficients in 
the number field Q(\/2). Geometrically, the curve (x^ +?/^)^ — 2(x + 2/)^ — 0 is 
quite simple, because the reduction {x'^-{-y"^ — \/2[x^y)){x'^-\-y'^-\-\/2{x-\-y)) 
= 
0 shows that it is a union of two circles, namely, the circle whose diameter 
is the line from the origin to (\/2, \/2) and the one whose diameter is the 
line from the origin to ( —V^, —V2). Geometers traditionally use algebraically 
closed ground fields in part to avoid situations like this in which a curve 
described by a simple irreducible polynomial becomes a union of two curves 
when the field of constants is extended. 
The simple constructive solution to this difficulty is not to make the giant 
leap to an algebraically closed ground field—the usual choice being the field of 
complex numbers, which is not an algebraic but a transcendental extension— 
but to adjoin new constants as needed. In the example, the constant \/2 is 
2 I 
2 
not just needed, it is already present as ^^'^^ , and when it is used the curve 
is reducible, and the geometric picture of the "curve" whose field of rational 
functions is the root field of (x^ -^-y'^Y — 2{x ^-y^ is a single circle x^ -h ^^ = 
^/2{x -h y). This revision of the picture makes it clear that the number of zeros 
of x on the curve is two, not four. Consequently, the number of poles of x^, 
which is the same as the number of zeros, is 2z^, not 4i/, and a typical element 
of 0{x^) has 2iy zeros, not 4z/. 
More generally, one needs to take into consideration the possibility that the 
root field of x(x, y) may contain constants other than the obvious constants 
in Q. Here a "constant" is an element of the root field that is a root of 
a polynomial with integer coefficients, or, what is the same, an element of 
0{x^). (A polynomial in x with rational coefficients is equal to a polynomial 
in 1/x with rational coefficients if and only if it is a rational number, and a 
root of a monic polynomial with rational coefficients is a root of a polynomial 
with integer coefficients.) For this reason, &(x^) will be called the field of 

Essay 4.3 An Algebraic Definition of the Genus 
131 
constants of the root field of x(^, ?/)• (Note that 0{x^) is a vector space over 
Q for all z^, and that 0{x^) is in fact a field.) 
The example then suggests the following definition: The number of zeros 
of a typical element of 0{x^) for large values of z^ is no z^, where no is the degree 
of the root field of x as an extension, not of the field Q{x) of rational functions 
in X with integer coefficients, but of the field of rational functions of x with 
coefficients in the field of constants 0{x^). When 0{x^) = Q, no is simply the 
degree of x in i/, but in the general case it is this degree divided by [0{x^) : Q]. 
Similarly, when one counts the "number of constants" in a formula for 
a typical element of 0{x^), 
one thinks of the constants as being in 
0{x^), 
not Q. Because the product of an element of 0{x^) and an element of 0(x^) 
is an element of 0(x^+^), 0{x^) is a vector space over 0{x^). The number 
of constants in a formula for a typical element of 0{x^) is quite simply the 
dimension of 0{x^) as a vector space over the field 0{x^). 
In this way, Abel's conception of the number of integrals to which a sum 
of integrals of an algebraic integrand can be reduced leads to the definition of 
the genus of the root field of x(x, y) as the number g for which dim0(x^) = 
noz^ — ^ + 1, where z/ is a large integer, where no is the degree n of x in 
y divided by the degree c of the field of constants 0{x^) as an extension 
of Q, where 0{x^) denotes the subset of the root field containing elements 
0 that are integral over x and have order at most u where x = oo, and 
where the dimension is the dimension of 0{x^) as a vector space over the 
field of constants 0{x^). 
The underlying idea is that an element of 0{x^) 
has noz^ zeros and contains dim0(a:^) parameters; variation of all dim0(x^) 
parameters in such a 0 varies its zeros with only dim0(x^) — 1 degrees of 
freedom—one degree of freedom is lost because multiplication of a function 
by a constant does not change its zeros—so the number of constraints g on 
the motion of the noz/ zeros under an algebraic variation is determined by the 
equation dim0(x^) — 1 = noz^ — g. 
The main theorem will be to show that this genus is intrinsic to the curve 
x{x,y) = 0 in the sense that if the root fields of two polynomials xi^^v) ^^^ 
isomorphic—if the two corresponding curves are birationally equivalent— 
then the fields have the same genus. Although the proof will be somewhat 
long, the underlying reason that the genus is intrinsic stems from the above 
discussions: It is the codimension of the subvarieties of C^ determined by the 
algebraic variations of N points on the curve.

Cramer, [11, Preface] 
The program outlined at the end of the last essay for constructing the genus 
of an algebraic curve—or, more precisely, the genus of the root field of a 
given x(x, y)—will be carried out in the following essays using an algorithm 
of Isaac Newton* for expanding an algebraic function of x as a power series in 
fractional 
powers of x. Known as Newton's polygon, or sometimes Newton's 
parallelogram^ 
it constructs, for a given polynomial equation xi^^v) 
= 0? 
infinite series expansions of y in fractional powers of x. It involves choices and 
results in n different expansions, where n — deg^ %. 
It will be useful to expand y not only in powers of x but also in powers of 
X — OL ioY various algebraic numbers a, something that can be accomplished 
by the same method, since setting x\ — x — a and Xil^i^y) — x(^ ~ 
^iV) 
gives an algebraic relation between x\ and y that can be used to expand y in 
(fractional) powers of Xi using Newton's polygon. 
Let x(x, 2/) be an irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients that has 
positive degree in both x and y and is monic in ^, and let a be a given 
value for x. The objective is to find infinite series "solutions" y — 6o{x — 
c^Y^ -\- Oi{x — ay^ -\- 02{x — a)^2 _^ ... of ^(x, y) = 0 in which the coefficients 
6i are algebraic numbers and the exponents eo < Si < - - - < Sk < - - - are 
an increasing sequence of rational numbers. It will also be assumed that the 
exponents increase without bound in the sense that for any given N one can 
find a value of k for which Sk > N. The meaning of the statement that such a 
* Newton's presentation is quite sketchy. My main source was Walker [61]. See 
also Newton [51, vol. 3, p. 50 and p. 360, vol. 4, p. 629], Hensel-Landsberg [31], 
and Chebotarev [9]. Chebotarev cites (end of §2) the Hensel-Landsberg book 
as his basic source, but he examines the Newton polygon much more fully than 
that book does, dealing thoroughly, for instance, with the history of the method. 
Unfortunately, his article is available only in Russian, and is difficult to find. 
Chebotarev advocates calling it Newton's "diagram" as Hensel and Landsberg 
do, saying that the "polygon" was not present in Newton's formulation, but the 
name "Newton's polygon" now seems firmly established.

series "solves" xi^^u) = 0 is clear, if somewhat nonconstructive: Such series 
can be added and multiplied term by term, and x = a -\- {x — a) is such a 
series (a terminating one), so xi^iV) represents such a series, the coefficients 
of which can be computed in an open-ended way by finding, for any given 
upper bound, all terms of the series x(x, ^) in which the exponent is less than 
that bound. To say that x{^^y) — 0 means simply that the result is always 
zero. 
Since y is integral over x, the exponents Si are to be expected to be non-
negative. Therefore, a knowledge of the terms of the series for y through the 
term 6k{x — aY'^ is all that is needed to compute all terms of x(^, y) in which 
the exponents are less than or equal to e^, because all omitted terms contain 
{x — aY^+^ for some i > 0 and £k-\-i > Sk- What is sought, then, are infinite 
sequences 6o^ ^i, O2, . • .and 0 < SQ < Si < - - - ioi which all terms of the

exponents greater than £k- A constructive solution of this problem must of 
course be an algorithm for generating such sequences. "Newton's polygon" is 
such an algorithm.

h 
6k{x — aY'^ of an infinite series solution y of xi^^u) 
= 0 in the sense just 
described, the algorithm should give all possible values 9k-\-i{x — aY^'^^ for the

The simple idea that underlies Newton's polygon is the observation that this 
infinite series in 5i with algebraic number coefficients, which is a sum of n + 
1 such series, can be identically zero only if all terms in the sum cancel, 
and, in particular, only if the lowest-order 
terms of these series cancel. If the

that ai + rji assumes its minimum value for at least two different pairs {i^ji)

These conditions limit the pairs (a, r) to a finite number of possibilities— 
the geometrical picture is the one described below—and even gives strong 
information about the coefficient 7 of the next term, namely, that it is a

of a polynomial in t whose

by the input. Consider the set of pairs [i^ji) of integers, where i is in the range 
0 < i < n, where ^i{s) / 0, and where ji is the number of times that s divides 
^i{s). By assumption, jo is defined and greater than at least one other ji. The 
segments of the Newton polygon corresponding to this input are the line 
segments that join two points (i^ji), say those corresponding to the indices ii 
and i2 > ii, in such a way that (1) the segment has negative slope, so it is 
described by the equation ai -\- rj = k where a = ji^ — ji^ and r = i2 — ii are 
both positive and where k is the common value of ai-\-rj for these two indices, 
(2) ai + Tji > k for all indices i for which ji is defined, and (3) ai + rji > k 
whenever ji is defined andi < ii ori> i2. With each such segment, associate

{i,ji) lies on the segment, of which there are at least two, and where Q is the 
coefficient of s^^ in ^i{s). Extend the input field A, if necessary, to split all 
polynomials r]{c) that result in this way from segments of the polygon. 
(Geometrically, the segments join to form a polygonal path that joins the 
point (0,jo) to the first point, call it (/, J), of the form (i,ji) at which ji 
assumes its minimum value. This path is determined by the fact that it joins 
points of the form {i,ji) in such a way that none of these points are in the 
interior of the closed polygon formed by it and the segments from (0, jo) to 
(0, J) and from (0, J) to (/, J).)

Fig. 4.5. When there are seven points {i,ji) = (0,10), (1,9), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), 
(5,2), (7,3), Newton's polygon has two segments. They join (0,10) and (4,2) via 
(2,4). 
truncated solution corresponding to 7 consists of the (possibly) extended field 
A constructed by the algorithm, the positive integer rm^ and the sequence 
/?^, /?;, /?^, . . . , / 3 ; , ^ , in which Pi^ = ft for 2 = 0, 1, . . . , /i and P^^^^ = 7 
but all other coefficients PI are zero. 
That each output (1) is a truncated solution—unless, of course, it is an 
actual solution—can be proved as follows: Set s — si and t = 5^(7 + ^1) in

By the choice of a and r, no term on the right contains si to a power less 
than the minimum value of ai + rji^ call it /c, and the terms that contain si 
to the power k exactly are s\r]{'^ + ti) by the definition of rj. Since 77(7 + ti) 
is a nonzero polynomial (its degree in ti is the largest value of i for which the 
point {i^ji) hes on the corresponding segment of the Newton polygon) with 
constant term zero (by the choice of 7), (2) is a polynomial in which the terms 
of lowest degree k in si all contain ti, as was to be shown. 
The ambiguity of a truncated solution is, in the notation used above, 
the least index i for which ji attains its minimum. Otherwise stated, it is the

A truncated solution will be called unambiguous if its ambiguity is 1. In this 
case, the polygon consists of a single line segment, and rj{c) is a polynomial 
of degree 1 whose single root is nonzero, so the algorithm produces a single 
output; moreover, the algorithm does not increase m, and it results in no 
extension of A because the root of r}{c) is already in A. 
The ambiguity of an output solution is the multiplicity of its ^ as a root of 
its r]{c), as follows from the above observation that the terms of lowest degree 
in si are Sirj{'y -t- ^i), because the multiplicity of 7 as a root of 77(c) is the 
number of times ti divides 77(74-^1). Thus, among the nonzero terms es^tl of 
(2) in which p assumes its minimum value A:, the one in which q has its least 
value is the one in which q is the multiplicity of 7 as a root of its r]{c). 
In particular, if the input truncated solution is unambiguous, so is the 
output truncated solution. Thus, if it begins with an unambiguous truncated 
solution, the algorithm constructs an infinite series solution (which may in rare 
cases be an actual terminating solution) with coefficients in the same A. In 
short, the construction of infinite series solutions is reduced by the Newton's 
polygon algorithm to the construction of unambiguous truncated solutions. 
Theorem 1. 
Construct n distinct infinite series solutions y of x{x^y) — 0 
at X — a. 
As above, a is a given algebraic number and xi^^v) is a given polynomial 
with integer coefficients that is irreducible, contains both x and y, and is monic 
of degree n in y. For the reason just stated, an infinite series solution can be 
regarded as having been constructed when an unambiguous truncated solution 
has been constructed. The proof of the theorem will follow an example: 
Let x(x, y) = y^ —xy-\-x^ (the curve x = 0 is the folium of Descartes—see 
Fig 4.6, p. 151) and let a = 0. If one begins with the truncated solution m = 1, 
y = 0, one begins with x(0 + s, 0 +1) = s^ — st -\-t^, and Newton's polygon 
joins the points (0, 3) and (3, 0) via the point (1,1). The two segments of the 
polygon are described by the equations 2i + j = 3 and i -\-2j = 3. 
The first segment gives just one output truncated solution 2/ = x^, because 
m = l,/i = 0, (j = 2, T = 1 and because the polynomial r]{c) = 1 — c in this 
case has just one nonzero root 1. It is a simple root, so this output solution 
is unambiguous. 
The second segment gives two output truncated solutions y = ^\fx (be-
cause vn— l,/i = 0, cr = l,T = 2), where 7 is a nonzero root of 77(c) = —c^(?. 
Thus 7 = zbl, and the output consists of two truncated solutions y = zby^. 
Both are unambiguous. 
Thus, Newton's polygon constructs three unambiguous truncated solutions 
and therefore constructs the three required infinite series solutions of y^ — 
xy^rx^ — ^ioY X — 0. These infinite series solutions can be found by repeated 
application of the Newton polygon algorithm, but the first few terms can be 
found more easily by the following method.

s^{s^ + 2t lb 3t^ + t^). The term 2t shows that this truncated solution is 
unambiguous. The continuation of the truncated solution y = :^^/x + • • • can 
be found using the equation s^ + 2t± 3t^ -h t^ = 0 to express t as a power series 
in s = y/x and substituting the result in y — ±s -\- st. Consider first the case 
in which the sign is plus. The relation s^ -\-2t -\- 3t^ -\-1^ — 0 can be written 
-1^3 + {\s^ + IsH' + .. •)(-§ -l)

- | 5 ^ - | 5 ^ - | - | - 5 ^ + | - ^ 5 ^ + --- = - ^ 5 ^ - | s ^ - i s ^ + ---, where theomitted 
terms all contain 5^^, from which y = s-{-st = s—^s"^— ^s^^ — ^s^^-\ 
. When 
5^ -h 2t + 3t^ + t^ = 0 is changed to s^ -\-2t - St"^ -\-t^ = 0, the corresponding 
solution is found by changing s to — 5 and t to —t. In summary, the second 
segment i + 2j = 3 corresponds to two infinite series solutions of y^ — xy-\-x^ = 
0; they begin 
y = =bv^ - -x^ T :^x^V^ - -x^ + • • •. 
The infinite series solution y — x'^ -\ 
corresponding to the first segment 
2i + j = 3 calls for computing the polynomial x(s, s^ -\- s^t) = 5^ — 5^(1 + 
t) + s^(l + tf = s^{-t + s^(l + t)^). The term -t shows that the truncated 
solution y = x^ is unambiguous. The expansion of y in powers of x can be 
found by using the relation —t + s^{l-\-t)^ = Oto expand t in powers of s = x 
and substituting the result in y = s'^ + s^t. Now, ^ = 5^(1 + ^)*^ implies 
t = 5^(1 + s^{l + tff 
= 5^(1 + 3s^(l + tf + 3s^(l + tf + s\l + tf) 
= 5^ + 35^(1 + tf + 35^(1 + tf + 5^2(1 + tf

= 5^ + 35^ + 12s^ -h 28s^^ + • • •, 
so 
7/ = x^ + x^ + 3x^ + 12x^^ + 28x^^ + • • • 
is the beginning of this infinite series solution of y^ — xy -{- x^ = 0. 
(Note that the sum of the three series is zero, at least up to the terms in 
x^, in accord with the fact that the coefficient of y'^ in y^ — xy -{- x^ is zero.) 
Proof of Theorem 1. A truncated solution oixi^iV) 
at x = a in which m = 1 
and /i = 0 is an algebraic number (3Q for which the terms of x(c^ + -5, /?o + ^) of

Newton polygon algorithm applied to any one of the n unambiguous truncated 
solutions y = po generates an infinite series solution y oi xi^^v) = 0 at x = a, 
which proves the theorem in this case. In the general case, one can apply the 
following algorithm: 
Input: A set of truncated solutions of x(x, y) = 0 at x = a. 
Algorithm: While the set contains a truncated solution whose ambiguity is 
greater than 1, let the Newton polygon algorithm he used to replace one such 
truncated solution with one or more longer truncated solutions. 
The theorem will be proved by proving that this algorithm terminates— 
that is, it reaches a stage at which all truncated solutions in the set that 
has been found are unambiguous—and by proving that each step leaves the 
sum of the ambiguities unchanged, so that if the algorithm starts with the 
truncated solutions y — j3o^ the sum of whose ambiguities is deg^ xi^iV) — '^ 
(because this sum is the sum of the multiplicities of the roots Po of x(a,y)), 
it terminates with a set of n unambiguous truncated solutions, which then 
imply n infinite series solutions. 
That the sum of the ambiguities does not change can be seen as follows: 
Let the notation be as in the description of Newton's polygon. The ambiguity 
of the input truncated solution is the least index / for which ji attains its min-
imum value J. Since the segments of the Newton polygon join (0, jo) to (/, J) 
and since the number of nonzero roots—counted with multiplicities—of any 
r]{c) is its degree minus the number of times c divides it, which is the differ-
ence i2 — ii of the i-coordinates of the endpoints of the corresponding segment, 
the ambiguity of the input truncated solution is the total number of nonzero 
roots, counted with multiplicities, of the polynomials rj^c) corresponding to 
segments of the polygon. Since, as was noted above, the multiplicity of 7 as a 
root of 77(c) is the ambiguity of the output truncated solution corresponding 
to 7, the sum of the ambiguities of the output solutions is the ambiguity of 
the input solution, as was to be shown. 
Each step of the above algorithm increases the number of truncated so-
lutions in the list unless the input truncated solution, which has ambiguity 
greater than 1 by assumption, yields a single output truncated solution, which 
means that 77(c) is a constant times (c — 7)^ for some nonzero algebraic num-
ber 7, where // is the ambiguity of the input solution. It will be shown that 
the number of steps of this type is bounded above, so that repeated applica-
tion of the Newton polygon algorithm eventually must increase the number 
of truncated solutions in the set. Since the total of their ambiguities is n at 
each step, it will follow that the process must terminate with n unambiguous 
truncated solutions, and the theorem will be proved. 
Suppose, therefore, that the (ambiguous) input truncated solution is one 
that produces a single output truncated solution. It is to be shown that iter-
ation of the algorithm eventually produces more than one output truncated 
solution. Let /i be the ambiguity of the input solution, which is therefore the 
ambiguity of each subsequent output solution as long as there is only one of 

140 
4 The Genus of an Algebraic Curve 
them. As was just noted, when there is only one output truncated solution, 
7y(c) is a constant times (c — 7)^ for some algebraic number 7, which im-
plies that Newton's polygon consists of a single segment that passes through 
pairs (i, ji) in which i has all values from 0 to /i because 77(c) contains terms 
in which c has all of these exponents. The single segment of the polygon is 
(io - jfx)i + A^J = k, where k = /xjo- Then (jo - j/.) • 1 + MJi = /ijo, which 
shows that jo — j i is divisible by fi. Therefore, the segment can also be writ-
ten ai -\- j = jo, where a = ^^~^^; that is, r can be taken to be 1, so that 
Si = s. Then (2) is divisible at least jo times by s (because k = jo), whereas 
x(a-f 5^, /3o+A«5H 
\-js^-\-ts^) 
is, by the definition of j ^ , divisible exactly j ^ 
times by 5. In other words, adding the next term 75^+"^ to the truncated solu-
tion increases the number of times s divides x(a-hs'^, Po-\-PiS-\ 
h/?/iS^+ts^) 
from j ^ to at least jo = Ji_i + (T/J^. 
Thus, if ly successive steps repeat the phenomenon of producing a single 
output truncated solution, it produces a truncated solution y = Po -^ - " -\-

On the other hand, elimination of y between x{^->y) ^^id -^{x,y) 
(see Essay

on the right and on 
the left gives a polynomial in s and t that is divisible at least (j^-\-/j,U) — {h-\-E) 
times by s. Thus j ^ + (/i — 1)17 — /i is bounded above by the number of times 
s divides D{a -\- 5^). Since /i > 1, this implies an upper bound on U; but 
L > u, because Z" is a sum of 1/ terms, each of which is at least 1, so z^ is 
bounded above, and the proof of Theorem 1 is complete.* 
* Walker's proof of this point [61, p. 102] is not constructive, because he jumps from 
the observation that the ambiguity can never increase and can never go below 
1 to the conclusion that he can find a step beyond which the ambiguity never 
decreases.

Theorem 2. 
Every truncated solution of x{x^y) = 0 for x — a is a trunca-
tion of one of the infinite series solutions constructed by Theorem 1. 
Proof As was shown prior to the statement of the Newton polygon algorithm, 
if an infinite series solution is truncated, and the algorithm is applied to the 
result, one of the outputs is the truncated series with the next nonzero term 
after the truncation added. Therefore, any truncated solution is among the 
outputs if one starts with the truncated solutions ?/ = /5o in which x(<^, Po) = 0 
and repeatedly applies the algorithm. Since these are the truncated solutions 
constructed by Theorem 1, Theorem 2 follows.

(One 
should give the problem a form in which it will always be possible to solve 
it, which can always be done for any problem whatever.)—Niels Henrik 
Abel [2, p. 217] 
I confess that the meaning of this dictum of Abel's is not altogether clear 
to me. Certainly it sounds like good advice, if one can understand what it 
means. My best guess is that he means something like what Kronecker meant 
when he said that one should require of one's definitions that one be able 
to determine by a finite calculation whether the definition is fulfilled in any 
given case. In the case of the determination of the genus of an algebraic field 
of transcendence degree one—the genus of a given algebraic curve—I believe 
both men would focus on constructive techniques like the ones given in this 
essay. 
The genus was described in Essay 4.3 in terms of the dimensions of the 
spaces 0{x^) 
of elements of the root field of x(^, y) (as always, an irreducible 
polynomial with integer coefficients that contains both x and y and is monic 
in y) that are integral over x and become integral over ^ when they are divided 
by x^. These dimensions can be determined easily once one constructs what 
Dedekind and Weber [14] called a normal basis of the root field. 
Theorem. 
For a given x{x, y), construct 
a subset yi, y2, •. •, yn of its root 
field with the property that yi, y2, ..., 
yn is a basis of the field over the field 
of rational functions 
in x in the sense that each element w of the root field 
has a unique representation 
in the form 
(1) 
w = (t)i{x)yi + (t)2{x)y2 H 
h (t)n{x)yn, 
where the coefficients 
(pi^x) are rational functions 
of x, and is an integral 
basis in the sense that w is integral over x if and only if each 
coefficient 
(l)i{x) in its representation 
(1) is a polynomial 
with rational coefficients, 
and 
further 
is a normal basis in the sense that w is in 0{x'^) 
if and only if each 
coefficient 
(t)i{x) in its representation 
(1) is not only a polynomial 
but also 
satisfies deg(j)i --\- Xi < ly, where Xi is the order of yi at x = oo for each i, that 
is, the least integer for which yi is in 
0{x^^). 
Proof 
Dedekind and Weber gave what appears to be an algorithm for con-
structing an integral basis (their §3), but their construction relies on the as-
sumption that for a given constant a one can either find an element y that 
is integral over x and remains integral over x when it is divided by x — o; or 
prove that there is no such y. The proof below uses, in essence, the method 
of Newton's polygon to justify this assumption and then constructs an inte-
gral basis using a method similar to theirs. However, they also assume that 

Essay 4.5 Determination of the Genus 
143 
a polynomial with rational coefficients can be written as a product of linear 
factors—they assume complex number coefficients—and the proof below is a 
modified version of theirs that adjoins only the constants that are needed. 
The first step will be to find a common denominator of the elements integral 
over X. 
The operation of multiplication by an element of the field can be described 
by the n x n matrix of rational functions of x that describes it with respect 
to the basis 1, ?/, ..., y^~^ of the root field as a vector space over the field 
of rational functions in x. In other words, an element z of the root field of 
X(x, ^) can be described by the matrix whose entry rriij in the zth row of the 
jth column is the rational function of x that is the coefficient of y^~^ in the 
representation of zy^~^ with respect to the basis 1, ?/, ..., y'^~^. The trace 
Sr=i ^^* ^^ ^^^ matrix obtained in this way is the trace of z with respect 
to X. 
Lemma. 
If an element of the root field ofxi^^y) 
is integral overx, its trace 
is a polynomial in x with rational coefficients. 
Let '0 = p(x, y)/q{x) be integral over x. Then, by the definition of integral-
ity, there is a relation of the form F('0) = 0, in which F is a monic polynomial 
with coefficients in Q[x]. Since F can be written as a product of irreducible, 
monic polynomials with coefficients in Q [x], il^ must be a root of an irreducible 
monic polynomial with coefficients in Q[x]; call it Fi. 
By the proposition of Essay 2.3, the root field of x(x,?/), because it con-
tains '0 and is generated over Q(x) by ?/, can be described by two adjunction 
relations /i('0) = 0 and /2(2/,'0) = 0, where /i and /2 have coefficients that 
are rational functions of x, /i is monic of degree z^i, say, and is irreducible, 
while /2 is monic of degree 1^2 ^ say, in y and is irreducible as a polynomial 
in y with coeflScients in the field of rational functions in x with ifj adjoined. 
Because /i and Fi both have ^ as a root, because both are monic with coef-
ficients that are rational functions of x, and because both are irreducible over 
the field of rational functions in x (Fi is irreducible in this sense by virtue 
of Gauss's lemma), /i = Fi. In particular, the coefficients of /i are not just 
rational functions of x, they are polynomials in x with rational coefficients. 
The trace of -0 is by definition the trace of the matrix that represents 
multiplication by '0 relative to the basis 1, 7/, • • •, y^~^ of the root field over 
the field of rational functions in x. Therefore (because iv {AB) = 
ti{BA)^ 
so ii{M~^AM) 
= tr (AMM~^) = tr (yl)), it is the trace of the matrix that 
represents multiplication by -0 relative to any basis. In particular, it is the 
trace of the matrix that represents multiplication by ^^ relative to the basis 
ip^y^, 0 < i < ui^ 0 < j < 1^2' When the elements of this basis are suitably 
ordered, the matrix that represents multiplication by ip becomes a z/2 x ^2 
matrix of ui x ui blocks (note that 1^11^2 = n) in which the blocks off the 
diagonal are all 0 and the blocks on the diagonal are all the same matrix: 
Its first 1^1 — 1 rows are the last z^i — 1 rows of /^^^, and its last row contains 
the negatives of the coefficients (after the first) of the polynomial /i = Fi,

listed in reverse order. In particular, its entries are all in Q[x], so its trace is 
in Q[x]. (In fact, its trace—and therefore the trace of ip—is simply —1^2 times 
the second coefficient of Fi.) 
The matrix, call it 5, whose entry in the zth row of the jth 
column is 
the trace of ^*+-^~^, is a matrix of polynomials in x with integer coefficients. 
Therefore, its determinant, call it D{x), 
is a polynomial in x with integer 
coefficients. The lemma implies that D{x) 
is a common 
denominator 
of the 
elements 
of the root field integral over x. In fact, if p{x,y)/q{x) 
is integral 
over x^ where p(x, y) and q{x) are polynomials with rational coefficients and 
q{x) 7^ 0, and if it is in lowest terms, then not only does q{x) divide D{x)^ 
but so does q{x)'^. This can be proved as follows: 
The matrix S of which D{x) is the determinant represents the bilinear form 
"the trace of the product" on the root field of x(x, y) relative to the basis 1, 
2/, . . . , y'^~^. 
This observation implies that D{x) ^ 0, because if D{x) were 
zero, there would be a solution v[x) oi S 'v{x) = 0 that was a nonzero column 
matrix whose entries Vi{x) were rational functions of x, and this would imply 
irx{wv) 
— 0 for all elements w of the root field, where i) = 
Yl^^i^ii^)y^~'^^ 
contrary to the fact that tr x{wv) = n when w is the reciprocal of v. 
If p(x, y)/q{x) 
is integral over x and in lowest terms in the sense that q{x) 
and the coefficients Pi{x) of p{x,y) 
= Po{x) + Pi{x)y 
+ • • • + 
pn-i{x)y'^~^ 
have no common divisor of positive degree, and if one of the coefficients 
Pi{x) is nonzero, then a new basis of integers is obtained by replacing y^ 
with p{x,y)/q{x) 
in the basis 1, ?/,..., y^"^. 
The entries of the matrix that 
represents the bilinear form "the trace of the product" relative to this new 
basis are polynomials in x with rational coefficients, because they are traces 
of elements integral over x. Therefore, its determinant is a polynomial in 
X. On the other hand, its determinant is ( ^ 7 ^ ) 
D{x), 
because the matrix 
that makes the transition from one basis to the other is the identity matrix 
with the (i + l)st row replaced by a new row consisting of the coefficients of 
p{x^y)/q{x) 
and which therefore has ^ 7 ^ in its (i + l)st column, so both the 
transition matrix and its transpose have determinant ^ 7 ^ . Therefore, q{xY' 
divides pi{x)'^D{x) 
for each i (trivially so when Pi{x) = 0). Thus, q{x)'^ di-
vides the greatest common divisor of these polynomials pi{x)'^D{x)^ 
which is 
the greatest common divisor of the Pi{x)'^ times D{x). Since p{x, y)/Q{x) is in 
lowest terms by assumption, q{x)'^ is relatively prime to the greatest common 
divisor of the p^(x)^, so q{x)'^ divides D{x)^ as was to be shown. 
Since every element p(x, y)/q{x) 
of the root field can be written in the form 
P(x,y) + ^q('^\ : where P(x,y) is a polynomial in x and y and where ^^f^y is 
a proper fraction in the sense that deg^ r < deg q (and, as it is natural to as-
sume, deg^ r <n — deg^ x)? in order to determine which elements p{x, 
y)/q{x) 
are integral over x it will suffice to determine which elements r(x, y)/q{x) 
are 
integral over x, because polynomials P{x^y) 
are always integral over x. But 
since r(x, y)/q{x) 
for a given q{x) contains just n • deg q unknown rational co-

efficients, the following proposition reduces this determination to the solution 
of a system of homogeneous linear equations. 
Proposition. 
A rational function 
p{x^y)/q{x) 
with rational coefficients 
is 
integral over x if and only if for each algebraic number a that is a root of q{x) 
and for each infinite 
series solution y of x(^5 y) = 0 in fractional 
powers of 
x — a given by Newton^s polygon, all terms of the power series in s that 
results 
from substituting 
the series for y in p{x^ y) and then substituting 
a -\- s^ 
for 
X, where m clears the denominators 
in the fractional 
exponents, 
are divisible 
by s at least as many times as the polynomial 
q{a -h s^) 
is. 
Loosely speaking, the condition is that each expression of 
p{x,y)/q{x) 
obtained by using an expansion of i/ as a power series in fractional powers 
of X — a, where a is a root of q{x), and writing the reciprocal of q{x) as a 
negative power ofx — a times a power series in x — a with nonzero constant 
term, contains nonnegative exponents exclusively; in short, p{x^y)/q{x) 
has 
no poles where x is finite. 
Proof. Let ^{x^p) 
= p^-\-Ci{x)p^~^-] 
\-Cj^{x) be the irreducible, monic poly-
nomial* whose coefficients Ci{x) are rational functions of x of which p(x, y)— 
regarded as an element of the root field—is a root. Because p(x, y) is integral 
over X (it is a polynomial in y with coefficients in Q[x]), the coefficients Q ( X ) 
are polynomials in x with rational coefficients. To say that p{x^y)/q{x) 
is in-
tegral over X means that Ci{x) is divisible by q{xy for each i. It is to be shown 
that this is true if and only if p{a + 5^, /3o + A ^ + /325^ H 
) = 0 mod s^ for 
all infinite series solutions y = /3o + A ^ + /325^ + • • • of x(x, ?/) = 0, where a 
is a root of g(x), where s = {x — a)^^^, 
and where e is the number of times 
that s divides q{a + s'^). 
By definition, to say that ^{x^p) 
— 0, where x and p are regarded as 
elements of the root field, means that ^{x^p{x^y)) 
= 0 mod xi^^v)- 
In other 
words, it means that !Z^(x,p(x, y)) = g(x, y)x{^^ v) fo^ some polynomial g(x, y) 
with rational coefficients. Since X(Q; + 5 ^ , /3O + /3ISH 
\-(3hS^) = 0 mod s^^^ 
for each /i, it follows that ^{a + s'^,p{a 
+ 5^,/?o + A s H 
h (3hS^)) = 
0 mod 5^+-^ for each h. Therefore, p{a -\- {x — a),Po -\- Pi{x — ay^'^

by omitting all terms in which the exponent is larger than h/m^ is a truncated 
solution of^{x^p) 
= 0 for X = a. By Theorem 2 of the last essay, it is therefore 
a truncation of one of the infinite series solutions p of ^{x^p) 
= 0 for x = a 
found by the construction''' of Theorem 1 of the last essay. It is to be shown, 
This polynomial can be found because ^{x,p) 
is a factor of the characteristic 
polynomial of the matrix that represents multiplication by p{x, y) relative to the 
basis 1, 2/, •••, y"""^-
^ Strictly speaking, this construction does not apply to lZ^(x,p), because its coeffi-
cients are rational and the description of the Newton polygon algorithm in Essay 
4.4 assumes that the coefficients of the given equation xi^^v) 
— 0 ^^^ integers, 
but the algorithm applies without modification to the case of rational coefficients.

therefore, that q{xy 
divides Ci{x) for each i if and only if for each root a of 
q{x) in an algebraic number field, every infinite series solution p of ^{x^p) 
= 0 
in fractional powers of a; — a is divisible by the highest power oi x — a that 
divides q{x) = q{a -\- {x — a)). 
Suppose first that q{xy 
divides Ci{x) for each i. For a given root a of 
q{x) whose multiplicity is e, {x — ce)^* then divides Ci{x). The initial term 
of any infinite series solution p oi ^{x^p) 
= 0 in fractional powers of x — a 
can be found using the method by which the Newton's polygon algorithm 
finds the next term of a truncated series solution. Specifically, the equation 
^{a + s,p) = Cjy{a + s) + Cj,_i(a -f s)p^ 
h ci{a + s)p^~^ + p ^ = 0 shows, 
because the terms of lowest degree cancel, that the lowest order term of a series 
expansion p = js^^^ + • • • corresponds to a segment of the "Newton polygon" 
dictated by the points {i,ji)j where ji for i = 0, 1, . . . , z/ is the number of times 
s = X — a divides Cjy-i{a + s), except that ji is undefined when Ciy-i{x) = 0. 
Since {x — ay^^~'^^ divides c,y_^(x), ji is at least e(z/ —z) whenever it is defined. 
In particular, the minimum value 0 of ji occurs only for i — u. The rightmost 
segment of the polygon, call it ai-\-TJ = /c, therefore has (z/, 0) as its right end; 
its other end is at a point (i, ji) for which ai -\- rji = k = au -\- r - 0. For this 
index i, both ji = ^{v — i) and ji > e(i/ — i) hold. Therefore, for this segment 
of the polygon, 7 > e. All infinite series solutions p = j{x — OLY^'^ + • • • that 
correspond to this segment of the polygon are therefore divisible by [x — a)^. 
As is easily shown, the ratio - is smallest for this rightmost segment,* so all 
solutions p = ^{x — a)^!'^ + • • • are divisible by (x — a)^, as was to be shown. 
Conversely, if q{xY fails to divide Ci{x) for some z, then {x — o;)^* fails 
to divide Q ( X ) for some root OL of multiplicity e of q[x) and some index i. 
Moreover, x(^5 V) was assumed in Essay 4.4 to be irreducible. The series expan-
sions of a reducible polynomial can be found by finding the expansions of its 
irreducible factors. 
* What is to be shown is that the ratio cr/r for any segment of the polygon is larger 
than the ratio cr/r for the segment to its right. Since cr/r is minus the slope of 
the segment, this is the statement that the slopes of the segments increase as 
one moves from left to right, which is evident. In actual inequalities, the three 
endpoints of two successive segments of Newton's polygon, call them (r, jV), (s, js), 
(t, jt), satisfy 
ar + Tjr = crs + Tjs <crt + 
rjt, 
cf'r + T jr > cr's + T'JS = cr't +

where a' and r' pertain to the segment from (s, js) to {t,jt), from which

For such an a the points (i, ji) of the polygon arising from ^{a -\- s,p) = 
Cy{a + s) + Cy-i{a + s)p-\-... 4-p^ include at least one for which e{u — i)> ji-
li ji — 0 for some i < z/, then ^{a^p) contains a term of degree less than u in 
p, so this polynomial in p has a nonzero root, call it /3o, and there is a solution 
p = /^o + • • • of ^{a^p) = 0 that is not divisible by 5 = a: — a, and therefore 
not divisible by {x — aY. Otherwise, as before, the rightmost segment of the 
polygon, call it cri-^rj = A:, passes through (i/, 0) and at least one other point 
of the form {i,ji). At least one point (i^ji) lies below the line j = e(z/ — i) 
of slope —e passing through (z^, 0); since all points (i^ji) lie on or above any 
segment of the polygon, the rightmost segment j = ^{u — i) must he under the 
line j = e{v — i) for i < u. Thus, ^ < e, so no solution p — 7(x — a)^!'^ -h • • • 
arising from this segment of the polygon is divisible by (x — a)^, and the proof 
is complete. 
Thus, in a proper fraction r{x^y)/q{x) 
that is integral over x^ the coef-
ficients of r{x^y) satisfy a homogeneous system of linear equations, so the 
most general such fraction can be written as a linear combination of a finite 
number of them, say of ^i, ^2, • • •, Cfc, with rational coefficients. When these 
elements ^1, ^2, • • •, ^A: together with 1, ^, 2/^, • • •, y^~^ are taken as input 
to the following algorithm of Kronecker ([39, §7]), the algorithm produces an 
integral basis of the root field of xi^^ v) ^s described in the statement of the 
theorem. 
Construction of an Integral Basis 
Input: Elements ^1, ?/2, ...,?// of the root field of x(^, y) integral over x that 
span the elements integral over x in the sense that each element integral over 
X can be expressed in the form X]i=i 4^i{^)yi where the coefficients (j)i{x) are 
polynomials in x with rational coefficients. (At the outset, I — n-\-k^ and the 
coefficients of the ^i can be taken to be rational numbers.) 
Algorithm: As long as the number I of elements in the spanning set is greater 
than n, carry out the following operations. Consider the I x / symmetric matrix 
\tvxiyiyj)] CLTid consider its symmetric nxn 
minor determinants—those 
nxn 
minor determinants in which the indices of the n columns selected coincide 
with those of n the rows selected. Each such minor determinant is a polyno-
mial in X with rational coefficients because all of its entries are. Rearrange 
yi, y2, ..., yi, if necessary, to make the first such minor—the one formed by 
selecting the first n rows and columns—nonzero and of degree no greater than 
that of any other nonzero symmetric nxn 
minor. Then the first n entries 
of yi, y2, ''', 
Vi dre linearly independent over Q{x), which means that each 
remaining entry yn+i, yn+2, - • -, yi can be expressed as a sum of multiples of 
the first n in which the multipliers are rational functions ofx. Each multiplier 
in each of these expressions can be written as a polynomial in x plus a proper 
rational function of x, one in which the degree of the numerator is less than 
the degree of the denominator. Let polynomial multiples of the first n of the 
y ^s be subtracted from the later y ^s in order to make the multipliers in the

representations 
of the later y ^s in terms of the first n all proper rational 
func-
tions. Delete any y ^s that have become zero as a result of these 
subtractions, 
rearrange the list again, and repeat. 
Output: A list ?/i, ?/2, . . . , yn of just n elements integral over x that span, 
over Q[x], the set of all elements integral over x. 
The operations of the algorithm—rearrange the T/'S, delete zeros, and sub-
tract one y times a polynomial in x with rational coefficients from another 
y—do not change the conditions satisfied by the original set of T/'S that they 
span the elements integral over x when coefficients that are polynomials in x 
with rational coefficients are used. 
An argument like the one above that proves that D{x) is a common de-
nominator of the elements integral over x proves that each iteration 
of the 
algorithm 
reduces the degree of the determinant 
of the first n x n 
symmet-
ric minor. Specifically, if, after the multipliers in the representations of ^n+i, 
yn-\-2 ? • • • 5 2// cis sums of multiples of T/I , ^2, • • •, Vn have been reduced so that 
they are proper rational functions, and after zeros have been deleted, there are 
more than n items in the fist, then one of the coefficients—say the coefficient 
of yi—in the representation of 2/n+i is a nonzero proper fraction, call it ^ ^ , 
where degp < deg q. The symmetric nxn 
minor for any selection of n indices 
is a polynomial. As before. Mi = ( 4 ^ j MQ when Mi is the minor in which 
the selected indices are 2, 3, . . . , n-f-l and MQ is the one in which they are 1,2, 
. . . , n. Thus, g(x)^Mi = p(x)^Mo, which shows that deg Mi < degMo. Thus, 
the minor of least degree has degree less than deg MQ , and deg MQ decreases 
with each step, as was to be shown. 
In this way, the algorithm continues to reduce the degree of the 
first 
nxn 
minor. By the principle of infinite descent, the algorithm must terminate. 
In other words, a stage must be reached at which the list contains only n 
elements. Clearly, they are an integral basis of the root field. 
The proof of the theorem will be completed by a second algorithm, which 
starts with an integral basis and produces a normal basis. It requires that 
one also construct an integral basis relative to the parameter u = ^] in other 
words, it uses a set 21, 2:2, . . . , 2;^ of elements of the root field of x(^, y) with the 
property that every element of the root field has a unique representation in the 
form Y2^i{^)^i^ 
where the coefficients ipi{x) are rational functions of x, and 
that the element is integral over u = - ii and only if each ipi(x) is a polynomial 
in ^. The algorithm just given can be used to construct such a set 2^1, 2^2, • • • 7

Construction of a Normal Basis

X.

-^, 
- - -, - ^ (which is a basis consisting of elements integral 
over ^) is not an integral basis relative to ^, construct a new integral basis in 
which one yk is replaced by a new y'j^ whose order A^ at x = 00 is less than Xk 
in the following way. Write each Zi of an integral basis relative to ^ in the form 
^ji^ij{x)^, 
where the il^ij{x) are rational functions of x. By assumption, 
at least one ipij (x) is not a polynomial in ^. (If all were polynomials in ^, 
then each Zi and therefore each element integral over - would be a sum of 
multiples of the -^ 
with coefficients that were polynomials in -.) Choose 
a value of i for which at least one ipij (x) is not a polynomial in ^. Since 
x^Zi = J2i^ij{^)^^~'^^yj

X, and Oj{-) is a polynomial in - . By the choice of i, £,j{x) 7^ 0 for at least

If ?/i, ?/2, ..., 2/n is a normal basis of the root field of x(x, 2/), the elements of 
0{x^) are those whose representations in the form ^ ^ (j)i{x)yi have coefficients 
(t)i{x) that are polynomials in x, with rational coefficients, of degree at most 
v — Xi for each i. When ly < Xi this condition of course means that (/>i(x) = 0. 
Therefore, the dimension of 0{x^) as a vector space over Q is the sum of the 
numbers u — Xi + 1 over all indices i for which Xi < u. For large u^ then, the 
dimension of 0{x^) as a vector space over Q is exactly (z/ + l)n — ^^ A^. At the 
other extreme, when u = 0 this dimension—which is the degree of the field of 
constants 0{x^) as an extension of Q, denoted by c in Essay 4.3—is simply 
the number of indices i for which A^ = 0. 
In the notation of Essay 4.3, the genus of the root field of xi^^v) is g —

D{x) = 12rr^ - 8x^ - 27:r^ = x^(4 - 27x^). 
The square of the denominator q{x) of an element of the root field integral 
over X must divide x'^{A — 21 x"^)^ so x is a common denominator of these 
integral elements. A proper fraction integral over x must therefore be of the 
form ^+ y+^y 
where a, 6, and c are rational numbers. 
By the proposition, and by the fact that y = i y ^ — ... and y = x'^ -\- - • •

With u = ~ and v = ^ the equation v^ — uv -\-1 = 0 holds. That 1, v, v^

2u - 3 2u^ 
from which 
D{u) = 4u^ - 27. 
Since D{u) is square-free, 1, i;, -z;^ is an integral basis over u. Thus, 1, y, y^ jx 
is a normal basis, because 1, -, ^-^ is the integral basis 1, v^ v^ over u. 
In this case, then, Q is the field of constants, and the genus is (0 + 1 +

Example 2: x(x, y^ — y^ ^ x^y -f x (the Klein curve). 
In this case, D{x) — —4x^ — 27x^, whose only square factor is x^, so again 
the proper fractions integral over x have the form ^^^V^^V ^ where a, 6, and

if a = 6 = c = 0, so \, y^ y^ is an integral basis over x. The orders of the

therefore, w^ ^2x'^'uP' -\-x^w — x^ — 0, from which it is clear that the order oiw

over 1/x, but division by x^ gives one that shows that wjx^ is not integral 
over 1/x.) That 1, 7/, ?/^ is a normal basis follows from the observation that 1,

Example 3: x(x, y) = (x^ + ?/^)^ - 2(x + ^)^ (see Essay 4.3).

as the root field of the polynomial x^ ^ y^ — \f2{x + y), whose degree in y is 
2 instead of 4. 
(The irrational constants in the root field, if there are any, can be found 
by constructing one solution y of x(x, ?/) = 0 for one rational value a oi x\ 
the field of constants A needed to express such a solution must contain all 
constants in the root field, because the solution makes it possible to express 
any element of the root field as a power series—possibly with some negative 
exponents—with coefficients in A, and in particular to express any constant 
in the root field as an element of A. For example, when a = 0 the roots of 
x(0, ?/) = y^ — 2y^ yield two unambiguous truncated solutions y — ±\/2 • x^ 
and the truncated solution y = 0 • x^, whose ambiguity is 2. If the ambiguous 
solution y = 0' x^ is used as an input to Newton's polygon, the output is the 
truncated solution y = —1 • x, with ambiguity 2. If this truncated solution 
is the input, there are two unambiguous outputs y — —x :k \/2 • x^, for each 
of which \/2 must be adjoined. Thus, A = Q(\/2) for any one of the four 
infinite series solutions for a = 0, and no cleverness is needed to discover the 
irrational constant \/2 in the root field. For any x(x,7/), the construction of 
a single unambiguous solution x = a-\- s^^ y = /SQ -\- f3is -\- • • • of x(^5 2/) = 0 
gives a number field A that contains, for the same reason, all constants in the 
root field of x(x,7/); factorization of xi^^v) over such an A will then show 
the extent to which the adjunction of constants can reduce the degree in y of 
x(x,2/), or, more precisely, will determine the degree of the root field as an 
extension of A(x).) 
The elements 1, \/2, y, V^y are easily shown to be a normal basis in 
which the A's are 0, 0, 1, 1, respectively, so the genus is ^ X] A^ — (no — 1) = 
^(0 + 0 + 1 + 1) - (2 - 1) = 0. When Q is replaced by Q(v^), 1 and y are 
a normal basis in which the A's are 0 and 1 respectively, and the genus is 
(0 + l ) - ( 2 - l ) = 0 . 
Of course, the genus is 0 geometrically, because the curve is a circle, which 
is birationally equivalent to a line. 
Example 4: xi^iV) = y^ + x"^ — 1 (the elliptic curve mentioned in Essay 4.2). 
Here the trace of 1 is 2, and the trace of 2/ is 0, so the trace of y^ = 1 — x^ 
is 2(1 — x^) and D{x) = 4(1 —x^). Since this polynomial has distinct roots, 1, 
y is an integral basis. The order of 1 at x = oc is of course 0, and the order of 
y is 2 (because division of 7/^ + a:^ — 1 by x^ gives a polynomial in -^ and ^). 
Since 1 and ^ are an integral basis relative to ^, as is easily shown, 1 and 
y are a normal basis and the field of constants is Q, which implies that the 
genus is (0 + 2) - (2 - 1) = 1. 
Example 5: xi^^u) = y^ + x^ — 1 (a frequently cited hyperelliptic curve). 
By considerations similar to those in the last example, D{x) = 4(1 — x^) 
has distinct roots, so 1 and y form an integral basis. The orders at a: = oc are 
0 and 3 respectively, and this basis is a normal basis. Therefore the genus is 
(0 + 3 ) - ( 2 - 1 ) = 2. 

154 
4 The Genus of an Algebraic Curve 
Example 6: xi^^u) = V^ ~ f{^)^ where f{x) is a polynomial of degree 2n — 1 
or 2n with distinct roots (a general hyperelliptic curve). 
As in the previous examples, 1 and y are a normal basis for which the 
orders at x = oo are 0 and n, so the genus is (0 + n) — (2 — 1) = n — 1, as is 
implied by the passage from Abel's memoir quoted in Essay 4.1.

Essay 4.6 Holomorphic Differentials 
Given an algebraic curve C, the method of the preceding essay determines its 
genus g regarded as in Essay 4.3 as the codimension of the subvarieties of C^ 
swept out by algebraic variations of N points on the curve. The objective of 
the present essay is to express this idea in terms of differential equations 
N 
(1) 
^hj{xi,yi)dxi==0 
(j = 1,2, . . . , ^ ) 
i=l 
describing these subvarieties of C^. Here the differentials hj{x, y)dx for j = 1, 
2, . . . , ^ are to be a basis, over the field of constants, of the space of holomor-
phic differentials on the curve, a concept that is to be defined. The equations 
(1) state that algebraic variations satisfy g infinitesimal conditions, where g 
is the dimension of the space of holomorphic differentials; therefore, not only 
do the algebraic variations partition C^ 
into subvarieties of codimension g, 
but this partition is expressed by g explicit differential equations. 
In these equations, (xi^i/i) 
for i = 1, 2, . . . , N are given solutions of 
x{xi, Vi) — 0, where x(^? y) = 0 is the equation of the curve C. The heuristic 
idea of (1) is the following: If (1) correctly describes the possible algebraic 
variations of N points, it certainly describes the possible algebraic variations 
of fewer than ISl points: Just add conditions dxi = 0 for a certain number 
of the points. Therefore, there is no loss of generality in assuming that N 
is the number n^v of zeros of an element of 0[xy) 
for some large v. (Here 
no again denotes the degree of the root field as an extension of the field 
obtained by adjoining all its constants to Q(x), or, in the notation used before, 
no = njc^j As has been shown, the most general element of 0(x^) is given 
by an explicit formula Q that contains A^ — ^ + 1 unknown constants, call 
them ai, a2, . . . , ajv-^+i (and in fact contains them linearly); the conditions 
x{p^, 2/) = 0 and Q{x^ ?/, ^ i , a2, . . . , aiv-^+i) = 0 define, implicitly, A^ solutions 
{xi^yi) 
of xi^iiUi) 
= 0 as functions of ai, a2, . . . , ajv-^+i, where A^ = UQU. 
Since multiplication of ^ by a constant does not change its common zeros 
with X, one of the parameters in ^, say ajv-c^+i, can be set equal to 1. Then 
the N moving points depend on N — g parameters, and they sweep out a 
subvariety of codimension g. In principle, the equations (1) result from 
implicit 
differentiation 
of the defining equations X = 0, ^ = 0 of the N moving points 
{xi^yi) in the following way. 
For fixed values of the x's, 2/'s and a's, the 27V relations dx{xi,yi) 
= 
0, dO{xi^yi^a) 
— 0 give 2A^ homogeneous, linear equations in the 3A^ — g 
differentials dx^, dyi^ daj, whose coeflacients are rational functions of the 3N—g 
variables. The relation dx{xi,yi) 
= 0 involves just one pair of values 
{xi^yi) 
and ai, a2, . . . , CLN-Q^ SO it can be used (provided X'l IS a local parameter 
at {xi,yi)) 
to express each dyi in terms of the corresponding dxi and 
dai, 
da2, . . . , daN-g and in this way to reduce the differential equations to just N 
equations in 2N — g differentials dxi and dai. These equations can be solved. 

156 
4 The Genus of an Algebraic Curve 
in the generic case, to express dai, da2, ..., da^-g in terms of the dxi and to 
ehminate them, leaving g relations among the dxi. These g relations are the 
required differential equations (1) because they describe the relations satisfied 
by the dxi when the parameters ai are allowed to vary. In other words, these 
are the infinitesimal relations satisfied by algebraic variations of the N points 
In practice, the actual elimination of the dai to find the relations among the 
dxi seems impractical, even in the simplest examples. Instead, the derivation of 
the equations (1) will depend on observing that the holomorphic differentials, 
the ones that express the crucial relations (1), are the differentials that have 
no poles. Heuristically, such differentials lead to relations (1) in the following 
way. 
If 0{x^ y) has UQV zeros on the curve x(x, 2/) = 0 and no zeros where 
X = (X), and if /i(x, y) dx has no poles—even when x = 00—then the differential 
eixv)^ ^^^ poles only at the n^u zeros oi 0{x^y). Thus, one can make use of 
the fact that the sum of the residues of a differential is zero to find that

zeros of 6 
As a function on the curve xi^^v) 
= 0^ ^{^^u) can be regarded, locally, as 
a function of x near each of its zeros (provided these zeros avoid places on 
the curve where x is not a local parameter), so ^ is meaningful at each zero 
of 6{x^y) on the curve. When this derivative is not zero, its reciprocal is the 
residue of ^T^T at the zero of 6 because ^(x, y) — a\x + a2X^ + • • • implies 
that this residue is, by definition, — when a\ 7^ 0. Thus

zeros of 0 
zeros of 6 
where dXi for each i is the infinitesimal change in Xi that results from an 
infinitesimal change d9 in 6. In other words, if the nou points where 6 is zero 
are moved to the nearby points where 0 is dO, then the UQU changes dxi in 
the x-coordinates of the intersection points satisfy ^ /i(xi, y^) dxi = 0, as was 
to be shown, provided the zeros of 0{x, y) are at points where both x and 
0 are local parameters on the curve. That this necessary condition for the 
dxi to result from an algebraic variation of the intersection points is also a 
sufficient condition follows from—or at any rate is made plausible by—the 
fact that the number of linearly independent holomorphic differentials is g, so 
that the system of differential equations (1) describes a subvariety containing 
the algebraic variations that has the same dimension A^ — ^ (at generic points) 
as the subvariety of algebraic variations and that therefore must coincide with 
it. 
With this geometric motivation, the remainder of this essay will (a) define 
the notion of "holomorphic differential" in a precise algebraic way that accords 

Essay 4.6 Holomorphic Differentials 
157 
with the notion of "no poles," (b) prove that the dimension of the holomorphic 
differentials as a vector space over the field of constants is g^ (c) prove that 
the sum of the residues of a differential is zero, and (d) flesh out the implicit 
differentiation sketched above to reach the conclusion ^ hj{xi, yi) dxi — 0. 
As before, let x(x, ?/) be an irreducible polynomial in two indeterminates 
with integer coefficients that contains both indeterminates and is monic in 
the indeterminate y. Let K denote the root field of x(^5 y\ A differential in 
K is an expression of the form f{x,y)dx, 
where f{x^y) 
is an element of K 
and dx is merely a symbol. More precisely, f{x,y) 
dx is a differential 
expressed 
with respect to the parameter 
x; it is easy to guess how a differential expressed 
with respect to the parameter x might be expressed with respect to another 
parameter of K, but in this essay all differentials will be expressed with respect 
to the preferred parameter x. 
As before, the root field K of xi^^v) 
will be regarded as an extension not 
of Q(x), the field of rational functions in x, but of Ko{x), the field of rational 
functions in x with coefficients in the field of constants KQ of K. (The symbol 
KQ thus replaces the symbol 0{x^) 
as the notation for the field of constants of 
the root field.) As before, let TIQ be the degree of K as an extension of 
Ko{x). 
By the definition of the genus, the dimension of 0{x^) 
as a vector space over 
KQ is TIQU — g -\- 1 for all sufficiently large u. 
In this essay, instead of differentials f{x,y) 
dx themselves, their 
traces 
will be considered; the trace of / ( x , y) dx is by definition the differential 
tTx{f{x,y))dx, 
where dx is a symbol and t r ^ ( / ( x , y)) is the element of KQ{X) 
that is the trace of f{x^y) 
with respect to the field extension K D Ko{x)] in 
other words, trx{f{x,y)) 
is the trace of the no x no matrix that represents 
multiplication by f{x,y) 
with respect to the basis 1, ^, y^, . . . , y^^~'^ 
of K 
over Ko{x) 
(or, for that matter, with respect to any basis of K over 
Ko{x)). 
The heuristic idea behind this definition is that tr ^^(/(x, y) dx) is the sum over 
all no values at x of the differential f{x,y)dx^ 
which, being symmetric in the 
no values of y for any given x, is a rational function of x alone. 
Holomorphic differentials were described above as differentials without 
poles. Certainly, the trace of a holomorphic differential must therefore be 
dx times an element of Ko{x) without poles; in other words, if h{x^y)dx 
is 
holomorphic, then tr^^ (/i(x, y)) must be a polynomial in x. However, this nec-
essary condition should not be expected to be sufficient, because f{x,y) 
dx 
might have two poles at the same value of x that cancel when the sum is taken 
over all y. In the case of two canceling poles, however, one would expect to be 
able to choose an element 0{x,y) 
oi K that was zero at just one of the poles 
and that had no poles for finite values of a:, so that 9{x,y)f{x,y) 
dx would be a 
differential that had no poles where f{x,y) 
dx did not and for which the poles 
that canceled in tr^^ {f{x,y)dx) 
no longer canceled in tr^c 
{9{x,y)f{x,y)dx). 
Therefore, such a differential would not satisfy the stronger necessary condi-
tion for a differential f{x,y)dx 
to be holomorphic: For every 9{x^y) that is 
integral over x, tr^^ {6{x^y)f{x^y)) 
is a polynomial in x. But this necessary 

158 
4 The Genus of an Algebraic Curve 
condition, too, should not be expected to be sufficient, because it would not 
detect poles of /(x, y) dx at places where x = (X). 
For these reasons, a differential f{x,y) dx will be said to be holomorphic 
for finite x if tr^: {0{x^y)f{x,y)) 
is a polynomial in x whenever 0{x,y) is 
integral over x, and will be said to be holomorphic if it is holomorphic for 
finite X and if f d{-) = —-^duis 
holomorphic for finite u. (Here d{-) = — ^ 
is a definition. It will be justified by Corollary 1 below. Since tr^^ is the 
same as tr^^ when u = ^—both are found using a basis of the field over 
Q(x) = Q{u)—to say that —^^du is holomorphic for finite u means that 
trn(^ • -4) = ^^xi^'^Of) is a polynomial in u — - whenever 9 is integral over 
u.) 
Theorem. 
Construct the holomorphic differentials for a given x(^, y) cind 
prove that their dimension as a vector space over the field of constants KQ is 
the genus of the root field of x{x,y). 
Proof Let the construction that was used to determine the genus in Essay 
4.5 be used to construct a normal basis yi, ^2, • • • ^ Vno of the root field as 
an extension of the field Ko{x) of rational functions of x with coefficients 
in the field of constants KQ and to construct nonnegative integers /ii, /i2, 
..., /ino for which an element of the root field is in 0{x^) if and only if its 
unique expression in the form (j)i{x)yi + 02(^)1/2 -h • • • + (/)no(^)2/no? where 
the coefficients are in JFCO(X), has coefficients that are polynomials in x with 
coefficients in KQ and the degrees of these polynomials satisfy deg (/){-\-fii < v. 
Let Si denote the symmetric no x no matrix of polynomials in x with 
coefficients in KQ whose entry in the zth row of the jth column is tixiViVj)^ 
where the trace is taken relative to the extension K D Ko{x). (In other words, 
this entry is the trace of the matrix that represents multiplication by yiyj 
relative to the basis yi, 2/2, • • •, 2/no of K over Ko{x).) The symmetric bilinear 
form "the trace of the product" is represented by -Si in the sense that if 
h = hiyi + /i2^2 H 
+ hnoVno and 9 = 9iyi + 6>22/2 H 
h 6>no2/no are the 
representations of two elements h and 9 of K relative to this basis, then 
tr x{h9) = [h^Si [9] where [h] represents the row matrix whose entries are /ii, 
^2 5 • • • 5 hno, and [9] represents the column matrix whose entries are ^1, 6>2, 
. . . , UriQ. 
With this notation, to say that h dx is holomorphic is to say that [h] Si [9] 
is a polynomial of degree at most u — 2 whenever the ith entry 9i of the 
column matrix [9] is a polynomial whose degree is at most u — fii^ because 
trx{h9) must be a polynomial in x, while tixi—x^h 
• ^ ) = — ^^^u-2 must 
be a polynomial in -. (Note that the hi need not be polynomials.) In other 
words, the row matrix [h]Si has the property that its product with a column 
matrix [9] is a polynomial of degree at most u — 2 when the ith entry of 9 is 
a polynomial of degree at most u — fii. If one takes all entries but one of [9] 
to be zero and that one to be a polynomial of degree v — iii for some large z/, 
one sees that the ith entry of [h] Si must be a rational function whose product 

Essay 4.6 Holomorphic Differentials 
159 
with any polynomial of degree z/ — /i^ is a polynomial of degree at most u — 2. 
Thus, the zth entry of [h]Si must be a polynomial of degree at most /i^ — 2 
when iii > 2 and must be zero if fii is 0 or 1. In other words, [h] must have 
the form [c]5';|~''^, where c is a row matrix whose ith entry is a polynomial in x 
of degree at most /i^ — 2 with coefficients in K^. (In particular, the ith entry 
is zero when /i^ is 0 or 1.) This formula [h] — [c\S^^ completely describes the 
holomorphic differentials hdx. The number of constants in the coefficients of 
the entries of [c] is the sum of the numbers fJ^i — 1 over all values of i for 
which fii > 0. Since exactly one /i^ is zero (because KQ = 0{x^) 
consists of 
all elements 0i^i + </>22/2 + '' • + ^PnoUno i^ which 0^ = 0 when //^ > 0 and (pi 
is constant when /i^ = 0), it follows that the number of arbitrary constants in 
this formula for h is ( ^ A^i) — (^o ~ l)^ which is the genus, as was to be shown. 
The proof that the sum of the residues of any differential f{x,y) 
dx is zero 
reduces, by virtue of the definition 
of the sum of the residues as the sum of 
the residues of the rational differential tr x{f{X'>y))dx^ 
to the same statement 
for rational differentials 4 ^ d x , where p{x) and q{x) are polynomials with 
coefficients in some algebraic number field KQ and q{x) ^ 0. To define the 
sum of the residues of such a differential, it will be convenient to assume 
that the denominator q{x) splits into linear factors over KQ^ although, as will 
be seen, the sum of the residues can be expressed rationally in terms of the 
coefficients of p{x) and q{x) even when this condition is not fulfilled. By the 
method of partial fractions, one can see that if q{x) — Y\{^ — o^iY^ -> where the 
ai are distinct constants, then 
for suitable constants pi(j. (One can assume without loss of generality that 
degp < degg, so that P{x) — 0. Multiplication of both sides of the required

is defined to be p^i, the 
coefficient of ^^^ in the partial fractions expansion of ^7^, when a is one of 
the roots a^ of q{x); otherwise, the residue at x = a of ^^dx 
is zero. 
Note that the residue at x = a of ( 4 \ + 
/^ 1 dx is the sum of the 
residues at x = a of ~^dx 
and ^4|y(ix. (The partial fractions decomposition 
of a sum is the sum of the partial fractions decomposition when terms with 
the same denominators are combined.) 
The conventional statement that the sum of the residues of a rational 
differential is zero assumes that the "residue at x = cxo" is included in the 
sum. In this way, the conventional statement can be seen, as the corollary 
below shows, as a method of evaluating the sum of the residues of ^^dx 
over 
all finite values of a. This evaluation is in fact quite easy: 
Proposition. 
The sum of the residues at a of a rational differential 
^^dx 
over all finite values of a is

where r{x) is the remainder when p{x) is divided by q{x), where the limit 
on the left is merely a mnemonic standing for the expression on the right, 
and the expression on the right denotes the quotient of constants in which the 
denominator is the leading coefficient of q and the numerator is the coefficient 
of x^~^ in r{x). 
Proof. Since the residues of f P(a:) + 4 ^ 1 dx are the same as those of 4f|c^^, 
one can assume without loss of generality that the quotient ^T^T in the given 
differential is a proper fraction; i.e., one can assume r{x) = p{x). The residue 
of r^^^Y is p if e = 1 and 0 if e > 1, so for fractions of the particular 
form ^ 
= ^^l^Y the residue is given by the formula lim^^^oo ^ ^ - The 
theorem therefore follows from the observation that if ^-T\ and '^'^)^\ are proper

so the same is true of their limits as x -^ oc, interpreted as in the statement of

Corollary 1. 
The sum of the residues of ^^^dx over all finite values of x

Corollary 2. 
When the residue of ^^dx 
at x = oo is defined as in Corol-
lary 1, the sum of the residues of a rational differential is zero. 
These algebraic facts make possible a plausible implicit differentiation of 
x(x, i/) = 0 and 6{x^ 2/, o^i, ci2, ..., CLN-Q) = 0 that leads to

As before, there is no loss of generality in assuming that N = n^v for

6{xi, yi) = 0 for some fixed 6 = aiOi + a2^2 H

addition, it will be assumed that the chosen 9 is in "general position" in the 
sense that a: is a local parameter at each of the N intersection points (x^, yi) 
and 0 has poles of order u at each of the n points where x = cx). 
Each of the N intersection points [xi^yi) implies a pair of differential 
equations

a2, ..., a^-g^i 
have the given values that determine the N points (xi^i/i), 
and Xi and i/i are the coordinates of one of these points. 
Elimination of dyi from the pair of equations (3) gives the single equation 
dxi + Q{Oidai + 02da2 + • • • + ^AT-^+Ic/aAT-^+I) = 0 in which Q denotes the 
quotient —e^-e Y ' "^^^^ quotient is in fact the reciprocal of the derivative of 
9 with respect to x (eliminate dy from the equations Xxdx + Xydy = 0 and 
Oxdx^Oydy = d^, a computation that assumes x is a parameter on the curve at 
the point in question). Otherwise stated, it is the residue of the differential ^ 
at this zero of the denominator 6^ because it is the value of the quotient ^/~^\ 
at the point (xi^yi) where numerator and denominator, taken separately, are 
both zero. (It is natural to think of this number as a limit, but of course it 
can be described algebraically as the value of the rational function of x and 
y when it is put in canonical form—a numerator in which y has degree less 
than n — deg x ^^^ ^ denominator that is a polynomial in x alone that is 
relatively prime to the numerator.) 
Therefore, if each equation dxi-\-Q{0idai-\-62da2-\-' • •-\-0 N -g+idajsi -gj^i) = 
0 is multiplied by the value h{xi^yi) of h at the corresponding point {xi^yi) 
and all N of these equations are added, the result is ^ h{xi,yi)dxi + Cidai -h 
C2da2 -\ 
h CN-g-\-idaN-g-\-i = 0, where the coefficient Cj of daj is the sum 
over all A^ zeros of 0 on the curve x = 0 of hOj times the residue of ^ at that 
point. It is to be shown that each such coefficient Cj is zero. 
Since neither 9j nor hdx has poles for finite x, the differential 
9jhdx/0 
has residues for finite x only at the zeros (xi^yi) of 9, and these residues are 
the values at {xi^yi) of 9jh times the residue of dx/9 at (xi.yi). In short, 
Cj is the sum of all residues of the differential 9jhdx/9 
at points where x is 
finite. Therefore, it is minus the sum of the residues at x = oo of the differential 
9jhdx/9. Since 9j has order at most z/ at x = CXD (it is in 0{x^)) and 9 has order 
z/ at X = oc (by assumption), 9j/9 is finite at x = oc, so 9jhdx/9 
has no pole 
at X = oo, which implies Cj = 0 and ^ h{xi,yi)dxi 
= 0, as was to be shown. 
Example 1: x{^^ v) = V^ -^ ^^V + ^ (the Klein curve). 
As was seen in Essay 4.5, 1, y, y'^ are a normal basis over Q{x) for which 
the A's are 0, 2, 3. Therefore {hi + h2y -\- hsy'^)dx is a holomorphic differential 
if and only if [hi

the solution in which a — I and b — c =^ 0 is y times this one, which leads to 
the formula

for the most general holomorphic differential on this curve. The formula has 
three parameters a, 6, c because the genus is 3. (For an easier derivation of 
this formula, see the examples of Essay 4.8.) 
Example 2: x(x, y) — y^ — f{x), where f(x) is a polynomial of degree 2n — 1 
or 2n with distinct roots (a general hyperelliptic curve). 
As was seen in Essay 4.5, 1 and y are a normal basis for which the orders 
at X = oo are 0 and n. (The matrix S{x) is [^ 
2f?x)]' whose determinant 
D(x) = 4:f(x) has distinct roots, so 1, ?/ is an integral basis over x. Division of 
y'^ - f{x) = 0 by x^^ gives (^)2 - ^ ^ = 0, which, when i; = ^ and li = ^, 
is a curve of the same form v^ — F{u) = 0 of which 1, t' is an integral basis

Essay 4.7 The Riemann-Roch Theorem 
Dedekind and Weber say in their classic treatise that the Riemann-Roch the-
orem, in its usual formulation, determines the number of arbitrary constants 
in a function with given poles [14, §28]. Indeed, that is exactly the way Roch 
himself formulated the theorem [58], as his title "On the Number of Arbitrary 
Constants in Algebraic Functions" indicates. The answer, a formula for the 
dimension of the vector space of rational functions with (at most) given poles, 
is a corollary of the theorem of this essay, which describes the principal 
parts 
of rational functions on an algebraic curve. 
Let f{x^y) 
be a rational function on a curve xi^iV) 
— 0^ say f{x,y) 
= 
p{x^y)/q{x)^ 
where p and q are polynomials with integer coefficients and / is 
regarded as an element of the root field of x(^, v)- The principal parts of / 
at finite values of x are, by definition, the terms with negative exponents in 
the expansions of / in powers oix—a for algebraic numbers a. Such expansions 
are obtained by applying Newton's polygon to expand y\nn 
— deg^ x ways in 
(possibly fractional) powers of x — a, substituting these expansions in p(x, y)^ 
and multiplying the result by the expansion of \/q{x) 
in powers oix — a] they 
can contain negative powers oi x — a only if the expansion of l/q(x) 
does, 
which is to say, only if a is a root of q{x). The principal parts of /(x, y) thus 
amount simply to a list of the roots a of q{x) and, for each of them, a list of 
the terms, if any, with negative exponents in the n series found by substituting 
expansions of y in powers of x — o; in / ( a + (x — a), y). 
One can define the principal parts of / at x = oo as the principal parts 
at li = 0 when u = ^, but for the sake of simplicity this essay will deal only 
with rational functions that are finite at x = CXD, so that there are no principal 
parts at X = (X). Specifically, the only functions considered will be those of 
the form f{x^y) 
— p{x^y)/q{x)^ 
where p{x^y) 
is in 0{x^) 
for v — degg. 
Expansion of numerator and denominator of f{x,y) 
= 
(^\/Jl 
in powers of 
1/x then gives a quotient of power series in 1/x in which neither numerator 
nor denominator contains terms with negative exponents (the numerator is 
integral over 1/x) 
and the denominator is not zero when 1/x = 0, so the 
expansions of /(a;, y) in powers of - contain no terms with negative exponents. 
For values a of x at which xi^^v) 
— 0 ramifies—which 
is to say that at 
least one of the expansions of y in powers oix — a involves fractional powers— 
the principal parts of a function satisfy an obvious consistency requirement, 
namely, since one solution ?/ = /^o + A-^ + /^2<5^ H 
in which s — "^Jx — a for 
vn> 1 implies m — 1 other solutions obtained by multiplying s by some TTith 
root of 1 other than 1, it must be true that a term of any one of the corre-
sponding expansions of /(x, y) determines the term with the same exponent 
in any of the other m — 1 expansions: One needs merely to change s to ujs for 
a suitable root of unity u). 
For these reasons, a set of proposed principal parts of a rational func-
tion on the curve x(x, ?/) = 0 will be defined to consist of (1) an algebraic 
number field A, (2) a finite set of elements cei, 0:2, • • •, a^ of A, and (3) for

each of the a^ and for each of the n ways of expanding y in powers of x — a^ 
an expression of the form 71 (x — ai)~^ + 72(x — ai)~'^ + • • • + 7z(x — Q;^)~^ 
where / is a positive integer and the 7's are in A, except that in the case of 
expansions of y that are in powers of A/X — a^ with m > 1 the expressions 
must take the form 71 ( >/x — a^)"-^ + 72( A/^"^^^^)~^ + • • • + 7K V^ ~~ ^i)~^ 
and must satisfy the consistency requirement just described. (A natural 
way to handle this consistency requirement is to prescribe the expression 
7i( A/X — ai)~^ + 72( \/x — ai)~'^ + • • • + 7/( ^/x — ai)~^ for just one expan-
sion of y in powers of A/X — ai in each set of m and to derive the others from 
it.) 
The problem is to determine whether, for a given set of proposed principal 
parts, there is a rational function on the curve that is finite where x = 00 
and that has the stated principal parts. The answer given by the theorem 
below is that the holomorphic differentials give simple necessary and sufficient 
conditions for there to be such a function. 
If hdx is a holomorphic differential and if /(x,?/) = 
(^ 
is finite when 
X = 00, then iVxifh) 
on the one hand is a rational function of x whose 
denominator q{x) has degree u and whose numerator tr x{ph) has degree at 
most i/ — 2, so the sum of the residues of tvx{fh) 
over all finite values of the 
variable is zero, and on the other hand is a rational function whose residue at 
any finite value a of x is a linear function of the principal parts of /. In this 
way, a certain linear function of the principal parts of / is necessarily zero. 
Explicitly, the following lemma can be used to express the residue of tr x{fh) 
at X == a in terms of the principal parts of /: 
Lemma. 
Let g{x^y) he a rational function on the curve x(x,i/) = 0. The 
expansion of tr x {9) ^^ powers of x — a is the sum of the n expansions in 
(possibly fractional) powers of x ~ a obtained by substituting the n solutions 
of x(^, y) =0 atx = a in g{x, y). 
Proof. Let the main theorem of Part 1 be used to construct a minimal splitting 
polynomial, call it F(x,2:), of x(x,2/) regarded as a polynomial in y with 
coefficients in Z[x] and let K be the root field of F(x, z), which is to say that 
K is the splitting field of x(x, y). Finally, let z be an expansion of a solution z of 
F(x, z) = 0 in (possibly fractional) powers of x—a, say z = 6o-}-Sis-\-S2s'^-\ , 
where x = a + 5^. (Let m be determined by the condition that the indices i 
of terms in z in which Si j^ 0 have no common divisor greater than 1.) The 
substitution x = a-\- s'^^ z = z embeds K in the field of quotients of the ring 
of power series in s with coefficients in A, where A is an algebraic number 
field containing a that is constructed by the Newton polygon algorithm. Let 
A(s) denote this field of quotients; it is, in effect, the ring of formal power 
series in s with coefficients in A enlarged to include power series with a finite 
number of terms with negative exponents, because the reciprocal of a power 
series 7^5* +7^+15*+^ H 
in which the term of lowest degree has degree i can 
be expressed as a power series —s~'^ H 
in which there are i or fewer terms 
with negative exponents.

In short, the spHtting field K of xi^^v) 
can be regarded* as a subfield of 
A{s) for a sufficiently large algebraic number field A under an embedding that 
carries x to a-\- s'^. Let ^i, ^2, • • •, ^/x be the distinct images of ^(x,y) under 
the Galois group of K. The irreducible polynomial i^{X) with coefficients in"'' 
Q{x) of which g{x^y) is a root is then n f = i ( ^ ~ 9i)^ ^^^ ^^x{g) is —j times 
the coefficient of X^~^ 
in ip{X)^ where j is the degree of the root field K 
of x(x, y) as an extension of its subfield generated by g^ because the matrix 
that represents multiplication by g relative to a basis of K over Q(x) can be 
arranged as a j x j matrix of // x /i blocks in which the blocks off the diagonal 
are all zero and the diagonal blocks are all the matrix whose first /x — 1 rows are 
the last /i — 1 rows of /^ and whose last row is the negatives of the coefficients 
of ip (except the leading coefficient 1) listed in reverse order. Thus, since the 
coefficient of X^~^ 
is — (^i -f ^2 H 
^ 9i^)^ ^^e expansion of tra;(^) in powers 
of s is given by tr x{g) = j{gi + 5^2 + • • • + gi^) when the gi are represented 
as elements of A{s). What is to be shown, then, is that substitution of the n 
expansions of y in powers of 5, along with substitution of o; + 5"^ for x, into 
g{x,y) 
gives each of the // expansions ^^ for i = 1, 2, . . . , /i exactly j times. 
The Galois group of K expresses each root z of F(x, z) as a polynomial 
in one such root with coefficients in Q(x). Substitution of z in these polyno-
mials, together with substitution of a + s ^ for x, gives deg^^ F{x,z) 
distinct 
embeddings of K in A(s). The possible expansions of y in powers of s and 
the possible expansions gi of g{x,y) 
all occur as images of y or g{x^y)^ re-
spectively, under these embeddings. The action of the Galois group on the 
embeddings implies the desired conclusion that each gi occurs for the same 
number of different expansions of y. 
(Note in particular that all fractional powers of x — a cancel when the sum 
fi'i +^2 + • • • +^/x is computed. This is a clear consequence of the "consistency 
requirement" described above, because the sum 
is zero whenever uj is an mth root of unity and LJ^ 7^ 1.) 
Thus, the residue of tvx{fh) 
dx at any a is the sum of the coefficients of 
(x — a)~"^ over all n expansions of fh in powers of s = \/x — a. Not only does 
this sum depend linearly on the principal parts of / , but the entries in the 
matrix that describes it are coefficients in the expansion of h in powers of s. 
* Such an embedding of an algebraic field of transcendence degree 1 in A{s) is 
analogous to an embedding of an algebraic number field in the field of complex 
numbers (see Essay 5.1). As in the latter case, the field K loses much of its 
constructive meaning when it is regarded merely as a subfield of A(s), because 
elements of A(5) are infinite series. An element of ii^ is a root of a polynomial 
whose coefficients are rational functions of x, so the infinite series that represents 
it as an element of A(s) can be specified by giving enough terms to determine an 
unambiguous truncated solution of the equation in question, after which all later 
terms are determined by Newton's polygon. 
^ As always, Q(a:) denotes the field of quotients of Z[x], which is to say the field of 
rational functions in x.

Theorem. 
If a set of proposed principal parts satisfies the condition just 
described for each holomorphic differential hidx in a basis hidx, h2dx, 
..., 
hgdx of the holomorphic differentials on x{^^ v) — 0^ then it in fact gives 
the principal parts of some rational function on the curve. In short, these g 
necessary conditions for a set of proposed principal parts to be the principal 
parts of a function are sufficient 
Proof Let a set of proposed principal parts be called subordinate to a 
polynomial q{x) if each a for which it specifies a polynomial 7i5~-^+725~^ + 
• • • + 7/5~Ms a root of q{x) and if, moreover, the multiplicity of a as a root 
of q(x) is at least //m, so that multiplication of 7i5~^ + 72^"^ + • • • + 7/5~^ 
by q{x) = q{a + s^) makes all exponents nonnegative. Every set of proposed 
principal parts is subordinate to some q{x), so it will suffice to prove that the 
theorem holds for all sets of proposed principal parts subordinate to a given 
q{x). Moreover, those subordinate to q{x) are also subordinate to q{x)r{x) for 
any polynomial r(x), so one can assume without loss of generality that q{x) 
is a polynomial of high degree. 
If /(x, y) is finite at x = oc and its principal parts are subordinate to q{x), 
then q{x)f{x^y) 
has order at most degq at x = 00 and has no poles for finite 
X, which is to say that f{x^y) = p{x,y)/q{x), 
where p{x^y) is in 0{x^) for 
V = degq. But for large v the set of such functions f{x,y) 
is a vector space 
of dimension ni/ — g -\- 1 over the field of constants. Functions that differ by 
a constant have the same principal parts and conversely, so the vector space 
of principal parts that actually occur is seen in this way to have dimension 
nv — g for large v. 
On the other hand, the dimension of the space of proposed principal parts 
subordinate to q{x) can be found in the following way. If a is a root of q{x) of 
multiplicity /i, and if none of the n expansions of y in powers oi x — a involve 
fractional powers, the proposed principal parts subordinate to q{x) contain nfi 
coefficients corresponding to this a, ji coefficients in each expansion (those of 
{x - a ) - \ (x - a ) - ^ ..., (x - a)-^). 
The same formula jin holds even when 
some expansions involve fractional powers, because the proposed principal 
part corresponding to an expansion in powers of "y/x — a contains m times as 
many coefficients in the required range, but by the "consistency requirement" 
the coefficients of just one determines those of a set of m of them. Therefore, 
a set of proposed principal parts subordinate to q{x) contains nv unknown 
coefficients 7, where n = deg^ x ^"^^ ^ — ^^Z Q-
In short, the principal parts that actually occur are a subspace of codimen-
sion g in the nu-dimensional space of proposed principal parts subordinate to 

168

q{x) when u = degq is sufficiently large. Since the conditions imposed by the 
holomorphic differentials—the sum of the residues of tixifh) 
is zero for all 
holomorphic differentials hdx—are expressed by g homogeneous linear con-
ditions on the coefficients of the principal parts, the actually occurring ones 
account for all of those that satisfy the necessary conditions provided the nec-
essary conditions are independent (because then they determine a subspace of 
codimension g). In short, it will suffice to prove that every polynomial divides 
one for which the g necessary conditions are independent as conditions on sets 
of proposed principal parts subordinate to that polynomial. 
The g homogeneous linear conditions imposed by the holomorphic differ-
entials on proposed principal parts subordinate to q{x) are expressed by a 
g X {nv) matrix of elements of A, call it Cq. What is to be shown is that every 
polynomial divides a polynomial q{x) for which the rank of Cq is g. This will 
be done by showing that if the rank of Cq is less than g and if (3 is any element 
of A that is not a root of q{x), then replacing q{x) with {x — P)q{x) increases 
the rank of Cq, except for very extraordinary coincidences in the choice of f3 
which can easily be avoided. 
In fact, changing q{x) to {x — P)q{x) increases the degree of q{x) by 1 
and therefore adds n columns to Cq. Each of the new columns contains the 
g values of the coefficient hi of one of the basis hidx^ h2dx^ ..., hgdx of 
holomorphic differentials at one of the n points on the curve at which x = (3. 
More precisely, let P be required to be an element of A {(3 can be taken to be 
a positive integer) for which xiP^^) 
has distinct roots; then each column of 
the new Cq corresponds to one of the roots 7 of x(/^, X) and it contains the 
values of /ii, /i2, .. •, /^5 when (/3,7) is substituted for {x, y). It is to be shown 
that if the original Cq has rank less than ^, then the extended Cq has rank 
greater than that of the original, except under extraordinary circumstances. 
The ranks of the original and the extended Cq are unchanged by a change 
of basis of the holomorphic differentials. If the rank of the original Cq is 
less than g, then there are constants ci, C2, ..., c^, not all zero, such that 
multiplication of the original Cq on the left by the row matrix with entries Ci, 
C2, ..., Cg gives a row of zeros. If a new basis of the holomorphic differentials 
is used in which the first holomorphic differential is X]f=i Cihidx, the original 
Cq becomes a matrix whose first row is zero and the extended Cq becomes a 
matrix in which the first row contains niy zeros and n new entries that are the 
values of the new hi at the n points {x,y) = (/^, 7). Thus, the extended Cq 
has greater rank unless all n of these values are zero. 
Clearly, it would be an extraordinary coincidence if a value of P chosen at 
random were to result in even one value of hi that was zero, much less n of 
them. Since the number of zeros of the rational function hi (which is nonzero 
and does not have a pole at {P, 7) by the choice of P) is finite, one can easily 
find a new P for which the first row of the extended Cq contains a nonzero 
entry, and therefore find a p for which the rank of Cq is increased. 

Essay 4.7 The Riemann-Roch Theorem 
169 
This theorem determines exactly which proposed principal parts are actual 
principal parts and therefore solves the Riemann-Roch problem of determin-
ing the dimension of the space of rational functions with prescribed poles 
with, at most, prescribed multiplicities. In the notation and terminology of 
the proof, one can say that the vector space of functions whose principal parts 
are subordinate to q{x) has dimension nv — p-\-l, 
where p is the rank of C^, 
because the proposed principal parts are a space of dimension nz/, those that 
actually occur satisfy p independent conditions, and the linear function that 
carries functions to their principal parts has a one-dimensional kernel. 
This formula nv — p^l 
gives the answer only in the special cases in which, 
roughly speaking, a pole is allowed at one point only if a pole is allowed 
at all other points where x has the same value (multiplicities counted). A 
more general case of the formula can be stated by introducing a little more 
terminology. Let one set of proposed principal parts be said to be subor-
dinate to another if they make use of the same algebraic number field A, 
if each a of the first also occurs in the second, and if for each proposed ex-
pansion of y in powers of x — a, the terms in the corresponding expression 
7i( \/^ - Q:i)~^+72( V^ - a^)"^ H 
h7/( V^ - OLi)~^ (where in most cases 
m is 1) of the first all have exponents at least as great (bearing in mind that 
— 1 is greater than —2) as the smallest exponent of a nonzero term in the 
corresponding expression of the second. In short, the first set of proposed 
principal parts calls for no poles of greater multiplicity than are called for by 
the second. Let the number of coefficients in a set of proposed principal 
parts be the number of elements of A that need to be specified to describe 
a set of proposed principal parts that is subordinate to it (bearing in mind 
that if it calls for terms with fractional exponents, then the coefficients of one 
of the m expressions 71 ( A/X — ai)~^ +72( \/^ ~ OLi)~'^ H 
h7/( \/^ ~ <^z)~^ 
determine those in the other m — 1). 
Corollary 1 (Riemann-Roch Theorem). 
The functions whose principal 
parts are subordinate to a given set of proposed principal parts form a vector 
space of dimension N — p -\- 1, where N is the number of coefficients in the 
given set of proposed principal parts and p is the rank of the g x N matrix 
that describes the necessary and sufficient conditions of the theorem. 
Deduction. The sets of principal parts subordinate to the given set form a 
space of dimension N; the necessary and sufficient conditions describe a sub-
space of codimension p, which is the space of possible principal parts of actual 
functions; and the space of functions with these principal parts has dimension 
one greater, because two functions with the same principal parts differ by a 
constant. 
The theorem also implies that the conditions (1) of Essay 4.6 satisfied by 
algebraic variations of N points on a curve are sufficient, with a few added 
assumptions, for a proposed variation to be algebraic:

Let (x^, yi) for i = 1, 2, ..., N he pairs of algebraic numbers 
that satisfy xi^i^Vi) = 0; ^^^ suppose that x(x^,X) has n distinct roots for

algebraic numbers 6i, 62, . - , ^N that satisfy ^i^ih{xi^yi)6i

zeros are precisely at the points (x^, yi) and whose expansion f = 7^(x—Xi)H 
in powers of x — xi at each such point shows that ^\{xi,yi) — ^i ^^ 'the sense 
that 6i = —.

Corollary 3.

most, at these N points and no other poles form a vector space of dimension 
N — g -{- 1 -\- ji, where g is the genus of the curve and fi is the dimension of 
the vector space of holomorphic differentials that are zero at all N points. 
Deduction. By Corollary 2, the dimension is A^ — p + 1, where p is the rank 
of the g X N matrix whose columns correspond to the N given points and 
whose g entries in each column are the values at the corresponding point 
of the coefficients hi of a basis hidx^ /i2<ix, ..., hgdx of the holomorphic 
differentials. What is to be proved is that in this case p = g — fi., which follows 
immediately from the observation that p is the dimension of the kernel of 
the linear function from A^ to A ^ given by multiplication of row matrices of 
length g on the right by the matrix. 
In particular, the space of functions described in Corollary 3 has dimension 
at least A^ — ^ + 1. 
It is natural to exclude (5^ = 0, because the points {xi,yi) for which 6i = 0 can be 
omitted from the list.

Essay 4.8 The Genus Is a Birational Invariant 
So far in these essays, the genus of the field of rational functions on an algebraic 
curve xi^^y) 
— 0 tias been described in ways that used the special element 
X of the field, first when the description was in terms of the dimension of 
the vector space 0(x^), then when it was in terms of the dimension of the 
space of holomorphic differentials h dx over the field of constants. However, 
the geometric motivation of the concept in terms of algebraic variations leads 
one to believe that the genus depends only on the curve, not on the parameter 
X used to describe the curve. If z is any element of the root field of x(x, y) 
that is not a constant, one can construct* an element w of this root field such 
that every element of the field can be expressed rationally in terms of z and 
w and such that z and w satisfy a relation of the form Xi(z, w) = 0, in which 
Xi{z, w) is an irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients that is monic in 
w. In short, the root field of x(^5 y) can also be described as the root field of 
Xi{z, w). What is to be expected, and what will be proved in this essay, is that 
the genus is the same whether x or 2; is the special parameter used to define 
it. In other words, the genus depends only on the field of rational functions 
on the curve, which is what it means to say that the genus is a 
birational 
invariant. 
The needed connection is obvious from the point of view of differential 
calculus: The rule hdx ^^ [h^) 
dz establishes a one-to-one correspondence 
between differentials expressed with respect to x and differentials expressed 
with respect to z. The heuristic meaning of "holomorphic" is "no poles," so 
this correspondence between differentials with respect to x and those with 
respect to z should be expected to put the holomorphic 
differentials in the 
two cases in one-to-one, linear correspondence, implying that the dimension of 
these spaces of holomorphic differentials—the genus in the two cases—should 
be the same. 
It is easy to give algebraic meaning to j ^ . Let x and z be given elements 
of the root field K of x{^^ y)- There is^ an irreducible polynomial 0(X, Z) in 
two indeterminates with integer coefficients—it is uniquely determined, up to 
* See Essay 2.2. The field Q(2;) of rational functions in z is isomorphic to a subfield 
of the root field, provided z is not a constant. Adjunction of x and y to Cl{z) gives 
an explicit extension of Q(2;) that is isomorphic to the root field of x(^?2/)- By 
the theorem of the primitive element, such a double adjunction can be obtained 
by a simple adjunction, and one can describe a simple adjunction as the root field 
of an irreducible monic polynomial with coefficients in 7A[Z] in the usual way. 
^ Since the root field is an extension of Q,{x) of finite degree n, the powers 1, z^ 
2;^, ..., z'^ are linearly dependent over Q(a:), which is to say that one can find a 
nonzero polynomial of degree at most n with coefficients in Q(x) of which 2: is a 
root. The needed relation (j){x^ z) = 0 is found by clearing denominators and pass-
ing to an irreducible factor if necessary. Because the root field of x(^5 y) contains 
Q(x), the relation (/)(x, 2:) = 0 must involve z. To say that z is a 
parameter—that 
it is not a constant—means that cj) also involves x; if this is not the case, the

its sign, by x and z—with the property that (l){x,z) = 0 in K. The deriva-
tive of X with respect to z is found algebraically by implicit differentiation: 
differentiation of (j){x, z) = 0 gives 0a;(x, z)dx -\- (j)z{x^ z)dz = 0 and therefore 
gives 
dx 
(t)z{x,z)

where the subscripts indicate partial derivatives. The theorem to be proved 
states that when ^ is defined algebraically in this way, h dx is holomorphic 
if and only if h^dz 
is, when, naturally, one determines whether hidz is 
holomorphic for hi = hj^ by dealing with it as a differential in the root field 
of Xi(2:, w) rather than the root field of x(a:, y). 
The notion of "principal parts" of an element of K that was defined in the 
preceding essay will play an important role in the proof, but now the depen-
dence of these principal parts on x needs to be emphasized: The principal 
parts of / relative to a parameter x are the terms with negative expo-
nents* in all possible expansions of / in (possibly fractional) powers ofx — a 
for algebraic numbers a. (Possible principal parts at x = cxo will be ignored.) 
As was shown in the last essay, for a given / one can find a polynomial q{x) 
with the property that the only possible principal parts of / relative to x 
occur when a is a root of q{x). Therefore, the determination of the principal 
parts relative to a; is a finite—and usually quite simple^—calculation. One can 
then use the following lemma to determine whether f dx is holomorphic for 
finite x: 
Lemma 1. A differential f dx is holomorphic for finite x if and only if all 
terms of all principal parts of f relative to x have exponents greater than — 1. 
This criterion says roughly that / dx has no poles, because at a point of 
the curve where x — a there is a local parameter s for which x — a = s'^ 
for some m; to say that / dx has no pole at this place where s = 0 is to say 
that f d{s^) — mfs^~^ds 
has no pole, which is to say that multiplication of 
/ by s'^~^ clears its denominator, or, what is the same, that its expansion 
in powers oi x — a = s^ contains no terms whose exponents are less than or 
equal to —1. 
Proof. Suppose first that all terms of all principal parts of / relative to x do 
have exponents greater than —1. If ^ is integral over x, then its image under 
any embedding of K in A{s) that takes x to a -\- s'^ for some m is a series 
denominator of ^ is zero and the derivative is not defined (x is not a function 
ofz). 
* This definition is imprecise in that it ignores the question of multiplicities. In 
Essay 4.7, n = deg^ % distinct embeddings of the root field of x in A(5) were 
constructed for each given a. A given / may have fewer than n distinct images, 
so the same principal parts may occur for more than one embedding. Obviously, 
Lemma 1 is not affected by the way in which multiplicities are treated. 

Essay 4.8 The Genus Is a Birational Invariant 
173 
that contains no powers of s with negative exponents. Therefore, it contains 
no powers of x — a — s'^ with negative exponents, so the image of fO under 
any such embedding contains no terms in which the exponent on x — a is —1 
or less. As was seen in Essay 4.7, the expression of tix{fO) as a power series 
in X — Q; is the sum of the n images of fO in A{s). Therefore, it is a series 
in which no term has an exponent less than or equal to —1. Thus, since it is 
a series expansion of a rational function of x, which implies that it contains 
no terms with fractional exponents, it is a power series in x — a. Since this 
is true for every a, it follows that trx{fO) must in fact be a polynomial in x 
whenever 0 is integral over x. In short, f dx is holomorphic for finite x which 
completes the proof of Lemma 1. 
Conversely, suppose that some embedding of the root field K of xi^^v) ^^ 
A{s) that carries x to a -{- s^—where a is an algebraic number and m is a 
positive integer—carries / to a series in which the exponent on s is less than 
or equal to —m, so that the exponent on x — a is less than or equal to —1. Let 
Zi^ Z2, '-. ^ Zn he 8iii integral basis of the root field over x, and let ^ = ^ QZ^, 
where Ci, C2, ..., Cn are constants to be determined. Consider the terms in 
the n expansions of 6 in (possibly fractional) powers of x — a in which the 
exponents are less than 1. When the n expansions do not involve fractional 
powers, the expansion of each Zi has just one term-—the constant term—in 
which the exponent is less than 1 in each of the n embeddings, and the same 
is true of 9; in this case, the n constant terms in the series representations of 
0 are the entries of the column matrix Mc where c is the column matrix with 
entries Ci, C2, ..., c^ and M is the n x n matrix whose jth column contains 
the n constant terms in the images of Zj under the n embeddings. 
When one or more of the n expansions do involve fractional exponents^ 
when the curve is ramified at x = a—a similar statement is true. An embed-
ding involving powers of 5 = \/x — a in which m > 1 implies m — 1 others 
in which s is replaced by ujs for the mth roots of unity uj other than 1. There 
are precisely m terms (some of which may be zero) in any one of these series 
in which the exponent on x — a is less than 1, namely, the terms in 5^, s^^ 
..., s^~^. Since the sum of the various values of m is n, it follows that all 
coefficients of all n expansions of 0 in which the exponents on x — a are less 
than 1 are determined by just n such coefficients, namely, the coefficients of a 
selection of the expansions when just one expansion is selected from each set 
of m related expansions. The same is true of each Zj, and all coefficients of 0 
are determined by those given by a formula Mc, as before, in which the jth 
column of M gives the coefficients of the selected expansions of Zj. 
(For example, in the case of the integral basis 1, y, y'^/x of the root field of 
y^—xy+x^ 
over x, it was shown in Essay 4.4 that there are three expansions of 
y when a = 0, namely, y = iby^+- • • and y = 0 + - • •, where the omitted terms 
are divisible by x. Therefore, every 0 integral over x has three expansions, 
but the one corresponding to y — —y/x + • • • can be derived from the one 
corresponding to y — ^Jx + • • • by changing ^Jx to —^/x. When just two 
expansions, those corresponding to y = \fx^ 
and 7/ = OH 
, are selected.

Mc-

1 0 1 
Cl 
C2 
_^3_ 
where the first two rows contain the coefficients of 1 and y/x in the first selected 
expansion and the last row contains the coefficient of 1 in the second.) 
That the matrix M is invertible can be proved as follows: If Mc = 0, then 
the n expansions of 0 contain no terms in which the exponent on x — a is 
less than 1, so 6/{x — a) is integral over x. If any Q were nonzero, one of the 
coefficients Ci/{x — a) in the representation oiO/{x — a) relative to the integral 
basis zi, 2^2, ..., Zn would not be a polynomial, contrary to the definition of 
an integral basis. Therefore, Mc = 0 implies c = 0, so the square matrix M is 
invert ible. In other words, the coefficients in the terms of the expansion of 0 
in which the exponent on x — o; is less than 1 can be given arbitrarily chosen 
values (subject to the relations among m such expansions when m > 1 that 
were just noted) by taking the column matrix c to be the column matrix of 
chosen values multiplied on the left by M~^. 
Because the principal parts of / are assumed to contain a nonzero term 
in which the exponent on x — a is less than or equal to —1, the least such 
exponent has the form e = —i — —, where i > 1 and 0 < j < m. Let 0 = J2 ^i^i 
be chosen so that the coefficient of {x — ay^^ 
in the expansion of 0 in the 
embedding in A{s) that gives rise to the nonzero term with exponent e in the 
expansion of / is nonzero, but all other expansion coefficients of terms with 
exponent less than 1 are zero. Then the expansion of fO in m embeddings 
begins j{x — a)"^ -h • • •, where 7 7^ 0, while in the remaining embeddings 
the expansion of fO contains no terms in which the exponent on x — a is 
less than or equal to —i. Therefore, the sum of the n expansions of fO is 
7717(0: — a)~* + • • •, where z > 1. In particular, this sum is not a polynomial 
in x. 
The bilinear form "the trace of the product" from K x K to Q{x) is 
described, relative to the integral basis zi, 2:2, • • •, z^hy 
diU n x n symmetric 
matrix S of polynomials in x with integer coefficients, namely, the matrix 
whose entry in the zth row of the jth column is tr x{ziZj). To say that f dx is 
holomorphic for finite x means simply that all entries of [f]S are polynomials 
in X when [/] denotes the row matrix whose entries are the coefficients that 
represent / in the integral basis 2:1, 2:2, ..., Zn- If this were the case, the sum 
of the expansions of /^, which is [/]/S'[c] where [c] contains the coefficients of 
0 = J2^i^i ^s above, would also be a polynomial in x. Since it is not, f dx 
must not be holomorphic for finite x, which completes the proof of Lemma 1. 
Theorem. 
Let z be a parameter in the root field of x(^, y) ctnd let ^ be 
the element of the root field defined using implicit differentiation as above. A 
differential f dx is holomorphic if and only if f^dz

Proof. The reciprocal oi ~ is ^ , so it will suffice to prove that '^fdx is 
holomorphic" implies '^f^dz 
is holomorphic." 
Let ^ be a given algebraic number and let an embedding of K in A (a) be 
given that carries z to 6 -{- a^ for some / / > 0. It is to be shown that if h dx 
is holomorphic, then the image oi h - ^ under this embedding contains no 
terms in which the exponent on z — b \s less than or equal to —1, or, what is 
the same, that all exponents in the expansion oi [z — 6) • h • ^ are positive. 
Assume first that the image of x under the given embedding has no terms 
in which the exponent on a is negative; say it is a + a'a + a"o-'^ + • • •. In 
this case, let m be the exponent of the first nonzero term in the expansion 
of X — a. (There is such a term because x is not a constant.) When an mth

Because the given embedding K —^ A (a) followed by the substitution 
cr = eis + 625^ H 
carries x io a-\- s^^ and because h dx is holomorphic, the 
resulting embedding K -^ A{s) carries /i to a series in s in which no term has 
an exponent less than or equal to — m on s. Otherwise stated, all exponents 
in the expansion of (x — a) • /i in powers of s are positive. Since this expansion 
is found by substituting the expansion of a in powers of s into the expansion 
oi {x — a) ' h in powers of cr, it follows that all exponents in the expansion of

Let this expansion be multiplied by the expansion of ^ • ^5^ in powers of

M^ ' frf — 0? where the

in powers of a of j^^E^ is the constant —a^^^ plus terms in a. Therefore, 
{z - 6) ' h ' j ^ = {{x - a) • h) (—a'^^^ -\ 
j is a product of two series in a, 
one with positive exponents and one with no negative exponents, which shows 
that all terms in the expansion of {z — 6) • h - ^ in powers of a have positive 
exponents, a conclusion that holds for any embedding K -^ A((7) that carries 
z to 6 -\- a^ and carries x to a series with no negative exponents. 
If an embedding that carries z to 6 -\- a^ carries x to a series with some 
negative exponents, it carries TX = ^ to a series in which all exponents are 
positive. Since ^ - du \s holomorphic for finite u by virtue of the assumption 
that hdx is holomorphic, it follows that all exponents in the expansion of 
{z - 6) ' ^ ' ^ m powers of a are positive. By the chain rule, ^ = ^ ^ = 
^ 
. ^ when X = :^, so it follows that all exponents in the expansion of 
{z — S) • h- j ^ — {^ ~ ^)' h' ^ • j ^ in powers of a are positive in this case too. 
Thus, Lemma 1 implies that h • j ^ - dz is holomorphic for finite z. 
By the same token, h- ^ -dv is holomorphic for finite v for any parameter 
V and in particular when v — ^. Therefore h • ^ • ^ • dv is holomorphic for 
finite V = ^, which completes the proof that h • ^ • dz is holomorphic. 
Corollary. 
The genus is a birational invariant 
The determination of the genus can be accomplished by finding holomor-
phic differentials, for which the following proposition is useful. 
An algebraic curve x(^, 2/) = 0 is nonsingular for finite x if no pair (a, /?) 
of algebraic numbers satisfies all three conditions xi^^P) — 0^ Xx{(^^ (^) = 0? 
and X^(Q;,/?) = 0. 
Proposition. 
If x{x,y) = 0 is nonsingular for finite x, then hdx is holo-
morphic for finite x if and only if h • Xy ^-^ integral over x. 
In other words, when x(x, ?/) = 0 is nonsingular for finite x, the differentials 
holomorphic for finite x are those of the form 
/^ \ , where (/)(x, y) is integral 
over X. 
Proof. First assume that hdx is holomorphic. By the proposition of Essay 
4.5, it will suffice to prove that the image oi h- Xy in each embedding of K in 
A(5) that carries x to a + s^, and carries rational numbers to themselves, is 
without negative exponents.

solution y = l3 -^ P'{x - a) + f3'\x — a)"^ H 
. The corresponding embedding 
K -^ A(5) does not involve fractional powers o^ x — a. The assumption that 
h dx is holomorphic implies that the image of h in A(5) contains no exponents 
less than or equal to —1, so all exponents are greater than or equal to zero. 
The same is true of the image of Xy—it is a polynomial in x and y and is 
therefore integral over x—so the image oi h • Xy under the embedding has no 
negative exponents, as was to be shown. 
Otherwise, XX{OL^I3) 7^ 0, because the curve is nonsingular for finite x. In

Essay 5.1 On the So-Called Fundamental Theorem of 
Algebra 
Nor does this account of infinity rob the mathematicians 
of their study; 
for all that it denies is the actual existence of anything so great that you 
can never get to the end of it. And as a matter of fact, 
mathematicians 
never ask for or introduce an infinite magnitude; they only claim that the 
finite line shall he of any length they please; and it is possible to divide any 
magnitude whatsoever in the same proportion as the greatest magnitude.— 
Aristotle [3, p. 261]. 
Regrettably, the name "fundamental theorem of algebra" has become firmly 
attached to the statement that the field of complex numbers is algebraically 
closed—that is, the statement that a polynomial in one indeterminate x whose 
coefficients are complex numbers can be written in the form a^ 11?= i(^ ~ ^j)^ 
where 
complex numbers and ao is the leading coefficient 
of f{x). From a constructive point of view, this "theorem" is false for the 
following reason. 
A "complex number" by definition has the form a + 6i, where a and b 
are real numbers and i = y/^. 
A real number is a convergent sequence of 
rational numbers. Thus, computations with real numbers are computations 
with convergent sequences, so they are computations with approximations, 
and it is not constructively true that a real number is either zero or nonzero. 
For example, the sequence of partial sums of the series X^^^ j ^ , where n^ = 1 
if i is an even number greater than 2 that is not the sum of two primes and 
rii = 0 for all other numbers i, is a well-defined real number, call it r, because 
its decimal expansion to a huge number of places is easily computable, and 
its computation to any number of places is a finite calculation. For as far 
as the computation has been carried, r appears to be zero. However, the 
statement that r = 0 amounts simply to the Goldbach conjecture that every 
even number greater than 2 is a sum of two primes, a statement that up to the

present time no one has been able to prove or disprove.* To write rx"^ + x in 
the form ao OC^ "" ^j) ^^^ must determine whether the Goldbach conjecture 
is true: If it is, then rx^ -f- x = a:, but otherwise, rx^ -\- x = rx{x -\- -). At the 
present time, then, no known construction finds the representation of rx^ + x 
in the required form. 
As will be shown in this essay, the theorem is true constructively when 
the coefficients of the given polynomial are known 
exactly. 
Theorem. 
Given a polynomial 
f{x) whose coefficients are complex 
rational 
numbers—numbers 
of the form u-\-vi 
in which u and v are rational 
numbers 
and i = \f^—express 
it in the form a^ Y\!j=i{^ ~ ^j)y 'where xi^ ^2; ..., Xn 
are complex numbers and OQ is its leading 
coefficient. 
If f{x) is the complex conjugate of / ( x ) , then f{x)f{x) 
is a polynomial 
with rational coefficients, so the fundamental theorem of Essay 1.2 provides 
an irreducible, monic polynomial G{y) with integer coefficients that splits 
f{x)f{x){x'^ 
+ !)• When the term i in the coefficients of f{x) is identified with 
one of the two square roots of —1 in the root field of G{y), f{x) becomes a 
polynomial with coefficients in the root field that splits into linear factors, 
because the polynomial f{x)f{x) 
of which it is a factor splits into linear 
factors. Therefore, f{x) 
= aoY\{x 
— Pj{y)) mod G{y) where the pj{y) are 
elements of the root field. Because the root field is isomorphic to the subfield 
Q[y*] of the complex numbers when y* is a complex root of G{y)^ these 
observations imply that the theorem to be proved is a corollary of the following 
simpler theorem: 
Main Theorem. 
Given a monic, 
irreducible polynomial 
with integer coef-
ficients, 
construct 
a complex 
root. 
(More generally, let the field Q[i] of complex rational numbers be replaced 
by the root field of a monic, irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients. 
The Main Theorem implies that such a root field is isomorphic to a subfield 
of the complex numbers. In other words, every algebraic number field is iso-
morphic to a subfield of the complex numbers. However, because algebraic 
computations can be done exactly in a root field, such subfields of the com-
plex numbers are very special; in them, as in Q[z], algebraic computation can 
be done exactly. If f{x) is a polynomial with coefficients in such a subfield of 
the complex numbers, then f{x) can be written as a factor of a polynomial 
(its norm) with rational coefficients, and the method just explained shows 
that f{x) can be written in the form OQ Yli^ ~ ^j)i where the Xj are complex 
numbers, but where the Xj are in fact contained in some algebraic number 
field viewed as a subfield of the complex numbers.) 
* If one accepts Kronecker's criterion quoted in the epigraph to Essay 1.5, one must 
say that the definition of "positive real number" lacks a firm foundation because 
no method can be given for determining whether the real number r is positive.

Lemma. 
Given a monic, irreducible polynomial f{x) 
with integer coeffi-
cients, and given a positive rational number e, find a rational complex number 
XQ for which |/(^o)| < e. 
Proof. Let n be the degree of the given polynomial f{x). Because 4 ^ ^ — ^ 
can be written as a quotient of polynomials in which the numerator has degree 
n— 1 and the denominator has degree n-hl, 4 ^ = ^ + 0(|x|~^) as \x\ -^ oc; 
that is, there is a constant K for which 1 4 ^ " ^ | ^ T^ ^^^ ^^^ sufficiently 
large |x|. It follows that if i? is a positive integer and S is the square in the 
complex plane whose vertices are d=i^ zb Ri^ then 
JdS f{x) 
Jds X

as i^ —> oo. Since f^^ ^ dx = 27ri • n for all R, it follows that there is a positive 
integer i?, call it RQ^ for which J^^ ^M ^^ ¥" 0^ where ^o is the square in 
the complex plane whose vertices are ibi^o i ^o^-
Because -^^^ _-^^^^ is a polynomial in x and y with integer coefficients, 
X 
y 
there is an integer M such that I 
~: 
I is at most M on the square SQ. 
I

I 
For such an integer, \f{x) — f{y)\ < M\x — y\ for all x and y in ^o- Let T 
be an integer larger than ^ 
and let So be partitioned into subsquares that 
are ^ on a side. If x and y are complex numbers in the same subsquare, 
then \f{x) - f{y)\ < v ^ ^ M < |e. Thus, if |/(a:)| > e at the midpoint of 
a subsquare, then f{x) is nonzero throughout the subsquare, which means 
that log/(x) is defined as a function of x throughout the subsquare; since the 
derivative of \ogf{x) 
is "TCT, it follows that the integral of 4 ^ dx around 
the boundary of each such subsquare is zero. If |/(x)| > e were true for the 
midpoints of all the subsquares, then J^^ 4 ^ dx^ which is the sum of the 
integrals around the boundaries of all the subsquares, would be zero, contrary 
to the choice of SQ. Thus, the finite set of midpoints of the subsquares contains 
at least one complex rational number XQ for which |/(:z^o)| < ^^ as required. 
(Note that the coordinates of the midpoints are rational, so |/(x)p at 
the midpoints can be computed exactly and compared to the rational num-
ber e^. Obviously, the amount of computation required to find an XQ by this 
construction could be huge even for a rather simple f{x) and a moderate e. 
The method described here is not a practical way of finding an XQ—which 
in most cases would be easily accomplished by simple bisection methods to 
get a rough estimate, followed by Newton's method—but a way that can be 
succinctly described and is a finite calculation.) 
Proof of the Main Theorem. Let f{x) be the given monic, irreducible polyno-
mial with integer coefficients. Since |/(x)| ^ CXD as \x\ -^ CXD, a positive integer 
N can be chosen for which \x\ > N implies \f{x)\ > 1.

Proof (See Gauss, [30]). Let f{x) 
be a monic, irreducible poly-
nomial with integer coefficients. If deg / is odd, a simple bisection argument 
proves that / must have not just a complex root but even a real root. (Since 
f{N) 
is positive and f{—N) 
is negative for all sufficiently large N, one can 
construct an interval on which f{x) 
changes sign. Repeated bisections—note 
that each bisection point is rational, so the value of / there can be determined 
exactly—produce nested intervals that become arbitrarily short on which / 
changes sign. The sequence of upper ends of these intervals converges, and its 
limit is a root of /.) The idea of the proof is to use the quadratic formula 
to reduce the problem of finding a complex root of a given polynomial whose 
degree is even to the problem of finding a complex root of a polynomial whose 
degree is divisible fewer times by 2. 
Specifically, given a monic, irreducible / with integer coefficients whose 
degree is divisible u times by 2, an auxiliary monic, irreducible polynomial 
with integer coefficients will be constructed with two properties: (1) Its de-
gree is divisible fewer than 1/ times by 2. (2) A complex root of the original 
polynomial can be constructed if a complex root of the auxiliary polynomial 
is given. 
Let the given monic, irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients be 
written in the form f{x) 
— W{x — pj) and define F(u,v) 
= H - ^^{u — {pj -\-
Pk)v + Pjpk)^ where the product is over all pairs {j,k) 
of indices for which 
I < j < k < n. Here the pi are elements of some Galois algebraic number 
field, so the coefficients of F , being symmetric in the pi, are integers. The aux-
iliary polynomial will be F{u, V), where V is an integer for which F(ix, V) (a 
polynomial in u with integer coefficients) is relatively prime to its derivative in 
the sense that there are polynomials a{u) and P{u) with rational coefficients 
for which a{u)F{u^ 
V)+I3{u)^{u^ 
V) — 1. The expression of f{x) in the form 
fj(x — pj) of course requires the construction of a splitting field for / ( x ) , but 
this construction is needed only to provide the rationale for the following con-
struction of F{u^ v) using computations with symmetric polynomials (Essay 
2.4). According to its definition, F{u,v) 
is the polynomial in u in which the 
coefficient of 
'^ is (—1)* times the ith elementary symmetric polynomial 
in the (2) expressions {pj -\- pk)v — pjPk^ where pj and pk ^ pj are in the 
splitting field. These are polynomials in v whose coefficients are symmetric 
polynomials in the pj, so F{u^ v) is a polynomial in u and v whose coefficients 
are symmetric polynomials in the pj. Since any symmetric polynomial is a 
polynomial with integer coefficients in the elementary 
symmetric polynomi-

184 
5 Miscellany 
als, and since the ith elementary symmetric polynomial in pi, p2, • • •, Pn is 
(—1)* times the coefficient of x^~'^ in /(x), F{u,v) is expressed in this way 
as a polynomial in two indeterminates with integer coefficients without using 
the splitting field in the calculation, except as a rationale. 
That an integer V can be chosen in such a way that F{u^ V) is relatively 
prime to its derivative in the sense described can be proved as follows: Again, 
a splitting field for f{x) is needed to justify the proof but is not needed for 
the calculations that constitute the proof. For any integer V, the Euclidean 
algorithm for polynomials with coefficients in Q can be applied to F(w, V) 
andff(ii,y)tofind a nonzero polynomial of the form A{u) = a{u)F{u, V) + 
(3{u)^{u,V) 
that divides both F{u,V) 
and ^{u,V). 
An integer V is to 
be found for which this "greatest common divisor" A{u) has degree 0. Of 
course the computation of A{u) involves only rational numbers, but it can be 
regarded as a calculation with polynomials whose coefficients are in a splitting 
field for f{x). When it is regarded in this way, A{u) can fail to be of degree 0 
only if it is divisible by at least one of the linear factors u — {pj -\- pk)V -\- pjPk 
of F{u, V) with coefficients in that field. Thus, it can fail to be of degree 
0 only if one of the roots {pj -\- Pk)V — pjPk of F{u^ V) in this field is also 
a root of ^{u^V). 
But the formula for the derivative of a product implies 
that ^{{pj 
+ Pk)y — PjPk^ y) is equal to plus or minus the product of the 
H2) ((2) ~ -'-) diff"erences of the roots of F(ix, F), or, what is the same, plus 
or minus the value when v = V oi the polynomial that is the product of the 
^(2) ((2) ~" 1) hnear polynomials in v with coefficients in the splitting field 
of f{x) that are differences of distinct roots of F{u^ v) as a polynomial in u. 
This product is a polynomial in v of degree ^{^) ((2) ~ l)^ which is nonzero, 
because the factors are all nonzero (if pj -h Pk = pm + Pn and pjPk — PmPm 
then {x — pj){x — pk) = {x — pm){x — pn), which implies when both j < k 
and m < n that j = m and k = n^ because / is irreducible and therefore has 
distinct roots), so it is a nonzero polynomial in v with rational coefficients. 
The number of roots of such a polynomial is at most equal to its degree, so 
there is certainly an integer V that is not a root. 
If the degree n of f{x) is even—so that v > 0—the degree (2) of F(ii, V) 
is divisible exactly u — 1 times by 2. Therefore, at least one of its irreducible 
factors is divisible fewer than u times by 2. The Main Theorem will therefore 
be proved if F{u, V) is shown to have property (2) stated above that a complex 
root of F{u^ V) (a complex root of an irreducible factor of F{u^ V) is of course 
a root of F{u, V)) enables one to construct a complex root of f{x). 
Since F{u^v) has the special form F{u^v) = nr=i(^* + ^'^^ "^ li^)^ the 
polynomial in three variables F {u-\- ^w^v 
— ^w) 
can be written in the 
form F{u,v)(b(u^v.w). 
In fact, if one defines QAu.v) to be —, i^'^^—, then 
F{u,v) = {ai -\- piU^-fiv)Qi{u,v), 
so | ^ = PiQi + (a^ -\- f3iU ^-/iv)^

I f = 7iQi + (<^2+A^+72^)^, and a typical factor of F ( i i + ^w,v

A | f - 7 i | ^ = (^i + A^ + l^v) ( A ^ - 7 i ^ ) , this factor is divisible by 
ai + jSiU -\- 7^f, and the entire product is divisible by F{u^ v). (Explicitly, this 
calculation proves that the quotient (j){u^ v^w) \sY\il

•) 
In the case of the auxiliary polynomial F{u, V) constructed for a given 
f{x) as above, it follows that if [/ is a complex root of F{u^ V) and if U' and 
V are the complex values of ^ 
and ^ , respectively, when {u^v) = (U^V), 
then F{U + V^w^ V — U'w)^ a polynomial in w with complex coefficients, is 
identically zero. Since t/' ^ 0 by the construction of V^ one can set w — ^^^-^r-
in this identity to find that F(f/ + y ^^^^^, a;), a polynomial in x with complex 
coefficients, is identically zero. The quadratic formula can be applied to the

number is a root of f{x)^ because 0 = F(X^, X) = W- ^{X'^ — {pj -f pk)X H-

Thus, if every monic, irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients whose 
degree is divisible fewer than u times by 2 has a complex root, the same is 
true of every monic, irreducible polynomial whose degree is divisible exactly 
ly times by 2, and the proof is complete. 
Both proofs show clearly that the algebraic issues involved in the theorem 
are handled by the theorem of Essay 1.2 and have nothing to do with complex 
numbers. The complex numbers enter only because every algebraic number 
field—which is to say, in the terminology of Essay 2.2, every algebraic field of 
transcendence degree 0—is isomorphic to a subfield of the complex numbers. 
However, from a constructive point of view, to regard the field elements as

Essay 5.2 Proof by Contradiction and the Sylow 
Theorems 
The widely held belief that "proofs by contradiction" are "not constructive" 
is mistaken. One can constructively prove that a certain construction is im-
possible by proving that if it were possible, then another construction 
that is 
clearly impossible would also be possible. Perhaps the oldest such proof is the 
proof that y/2 is irrational: 
Let a unit of length be fixed, and suppose an isosceles right triangle 
ABC 
could be given whose sides AB and BC and hypotenuse AC had whole number 
lengths. One could then construct a smaller isosceles right triangle with the 
same property in the following way. Let D be the point on the hypotenuse 
AC for which the length AD is equal to the length AB of the sides of 
ABC. 
Let E be the point where the perpendicular to the hypotenuse AC through 
the point D intersects the side BC. Then CDE 
would be an isosceles right 
triangle smaller than ABC 
whose sides and hypotenuse had whole number 
lengths, as can be seen in the following way: 
The side CD of CDE 
is the difference of the lengths AC and AD = 
AB, 
both of which would be whole number lengths, so it would be a whole number 
length. Moreover, the new triangle CDE 
is an isosceles right triangle because 
angle DCE 
is angle ACB 
and angle CDE 
is right, so the new triangle is 
similar to the original one. Finally, when AE is joined, the right triangles ADE 

Essay 5.2 Proof by Contradiction and the Sylow Theorems 
187 
and ABE are congruent because the hypotenuse and one side are equal, so the 
lengths DE and EB are equal, and the hypotenuse CE^ being the difference of 
the lengths CB and EB = ED = CD would be a difference of whole number 
lengths and would therefore be a whole number length. 
Thus, if there were such an isosceles right triangle, one would be able 
to construct an infinite decreasing sequence of positive whole numbers, for 
example, the whole number lengths of the hypotenuses of the sequence of 
isosceles right triangles constructed in this way. Since there can be no such 
sequence, there can be no such isosceles right triangle. 
By the Pythagorean theorem, such an isosceles right triangle is the same 
as a pair of whole numbers s and d for which (P = 25^, so another way to 
state the same conclusion is to say that no rational number d/s can have 2 as 
its square. 
The main Sylow theorem. Theorem 1 below, can be proved by the same 
method, which Fermat called the method of infinite descent. 
Theorem 1. 
If d divides the order \G\ of a finite group G, and if d is a 
power of a prime number, then G has a subgroup of order d. 
Lemma. 
// the order of an abelian group is divisible by a prime number p, 
then the group contains an element of order p. 
Note that the lemma is a very special case of Theorem 1. 
Proof. Suppose a finite abelian group G is given whose order is divisible by 
a prime p but that contains no element of order p. It will be shown that one 
would then be able to construct a smaller group of the same type. 
Choose an element a of G that is not the identity {\G\ is divisible by 
p > 1, so G contains elements other than 1) and let g > 1 be the order of 
a. If p divided g, then {a^^^Y = 1 would imply, since G contains no element 
of order p, that a^/^ = 1, contrary to the definition of q. Therefore, p does 
not divide q. Because p is prime, p and q are relatively prime, the Euclidean 
algorithm implies that some multiple of q is one more than a multiple of j9, 
say uq = vp -\- 1. Let C be the subgroup of G generated by a, and let G' be 
the quotient group G/C. (Since G is abelian, C is a normal subgroup.) Let 
b be an element of G that represents an element of G' whose pth power is 
1. Then b^ = a' for some i, and (a^^6)^ = a^^P+^ = a^^^ = T^ = 1. Since G 
has no elements of order p, it follows that a^'^b — 1. Therefore, 6 is a power 
of a, which means that it represents the identity element of G^ Therefore, G' 
contains no element of order p. The order of \G'\ is \G\/qy which is divisible 
by p because |G| is divisible by p and q is not. Thus, G', like G, is abelian and 
has order divisible by p but contains no element of order p. Since \G'\ < |G|, 
the impossibility of such a group G follows from the observation that the 
existence of such a G would imply the existence of an infinite sequence of 
positive integers \G\ > \G^\ > \G''\ > • • •, which is impossible. 

188 
5 Miscellany 
Proof of Theorem 
1. As in the proof of the lemma, a counterexample will be 
shown to imply a smaller counterexample. Thus, suppose G is a counterex-
ample, which is to say that G is a finite group for which there is a power of a 
prime p^ that divides \G\ but that is not the order of any subgroup of G. It is 
to be shown that from such a group one can construct a smaller such group. 
Let Z be the center of G. If p divides |^|, a smaller counterexample can be 
constructed as follows: In this case, the lemma implies (because Z is abelian) 
that Z contains an element of order p, call it a. Let C be the subgroup 
generated by a. Since G has no subgroup of order p^ and C has order p, k 
must be at least 2. Since G is a normal subgroup, G' = G/C is a group. The 
order of G' is |G|/p, so ^^^"^ divides |G'|. If iJ' is a subgroup of G' of order m, 
then the elements of G that represent elements of H' form a subgroup of G of 
order mp. Therefore, since G has no subgroup of order p^, G' has no subgroup 
of order p^~^ ^ which shows that G' is a smaller counterexample than G. 
If p does not divide |Z|, a smaller counterexample can be constructed even 
more easily. Since G is the union of Z and all the conjugacy classes of G that 
contain more than one element {Z is the union of the conjugacy classes that 
contain one element), since \G\ is divisible by p, and since \Z\ is not divisible 
by p, the number of elements in at least one conjugacy class with more than 
one element must not be divisible by p. If g is in such a conjugacy class, then, 
because the number of elements in the conjugacy class of ^ is |G|/|Z(^)|, where 
Z{g) is the centralizer of ^, \Z{g)\ < \G\ and p divides \Z{g)\ as many times 
as it divides |G|. Thus, p^ divides \Z{g)\ and Z{g) has no subgroup of order 
p^ (because G has no such subgroup), so Z{g) is a smaller counterexample. 
Thus, Theorem 1 follows by the principle of infinite descent. 
For the sake of completeness, the other Sylow theorems will be deduced 
from Theorem 1. 
Theorem 1 shows that if p is a prime divisor of |G|, then G has a subgroup 
of order p^, where p^ is the largest power of p that divides |G|. Such a subgroup 
is called a Sylow p-subgroup of G. 
Theorem 2. 
If H is a Sylow p-subgroup 
of a finite group G, and if K is 
a subgroup of G whose order is a power of p, then some conjugate 
of K is 
contained in H. 
In particular, any two Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate. 
T h e o r e m 3. 
Let s be the number of Sylow p-subgroups 
of G. Then s divides 
\G\ and 5 = 1 mod p. 
(Theorems 2 and 3 are true for primes that do not divide the order of 
G when one adopts the natural convention that in this case the only Sylow 
p-subgroup is {1}. Similarly, Theorem 1 is trivially true for the zeroth power 
1 of any prime.) 
Proof of Theorem 
2. The subgroup K acts on the left cosets of iJ in G by 
left multiplication, and this action partitions the left cosets into orbits. (To 

Essay 5.2 Proof by Contradiction and the Sylow Theorems

say that g and g' represent cosets in the same orbit means that kg is in the 
coset represented by g' for some k in K, or to put it another way, {kg)~^g' is 
in H for some kinK.) 
The number of elements in any orbit divides the order 
of K, which is a power of p, so the number of elements in any orbit is p^ for 
some z > 0. The sum over all orbits of these numbers p^ is the number of left 
cosets of H in G, which, because i7 is a Sylow p-subgroup, is not divisible by 
p. Therefore, p* = 1 for at least one orbit. In other words, for at least one g in 
G, the coset represented by kg is the same as the coset represented by g for 
all /c in X. In short, g~^kg is in H for all A: in i^. Since g~^Kg is a subgroup 
conjugate to K^ the theorem follows. 
Proof of Theorem 3. Let G act on the s Sylow p-subgroups by conjugation. By 
Theorem 2, this action is transitive: There is just one orbit of size s. Therefore, 
s divides \G\. 
Let iJ be a Sylow p-subgroup of G, and let H act on the s Sylow p-
subgroups by conjugation. This action partitions these s subgroups into orbits. 
Suppose the number of elements in the orbit of H' is 1. Then hH'h~^ = H' 
for all h in H. In other words, the normalizer of H' in G, call it N^ contains 
H. Since N also contains H' and both H and H' are Sylow p-subgroups of 
N {p can divide |A^| no more times than it divides |G|), Theorem 2 implies 
that H and H' are conjugate in N, which is to say that nH'n~^ 
= H for 
some n in N. But nH'n~^ = H' by the definition of N. Therefore, H' — i7, 
which shows that only one orbit—the orbit of H—consists of a single element. 
The number of elements in any orbit divides the order of H and is therefore 
a power of p. Therefore, all orbits other than the one with 1 element have p* 
elements, where z > 1, from which s = 1 mod p follows.

So ist es nicht erstaunlich,

that a great many modern textbooks have followed the abstract direction 
that has registered such great successes in the realm of research. How-
ever, I have had more than one opportunity to observe that in the realm 
of teaching this is not invariably the case.)—N. Chebotarev [8, Author's 
preface to the translation] 
Some years ago, Sheldon Axler published a book with the audacious title 
Linear Algebra Done Right [4]. I was probably more struck by the audacity of 
his title than most readers, because only a few years earlier I had published 
my own book called Linear Algebra, in which the subject had in fact been 
done right, but I had never thought to say so in the title. 
Of course, Axler's idea of doing it right turned out to have nothing to do 
with mine. 
Without doubt the most attractive quality of mathematics is its appar-
ent lack of subjectivity. "It must be easy for you mathematicians to grade 
papers," my friends often tell me, "because in mathematics there's only one 
right answer." In mathematics it can even happen that the student is right 
and the teacher wrong, and the teacher can be forced to admit it (usually, 
we hope, cheerfully). The other side of this pleasant coin is that mathematics 
attracts people who have a great need for certainty and encourages them to 
develop into rigidly dogmatic thinkers. 
The charge is made against advocates of constructive mathematics—it 
was made against Kronecker, against Brouwer, against Bishop—that they are 
dogmatists who implacably advocate unreasonably extreme views. But what 
distinguishes them from their accusers is neither the extremity of their views 
nor the tenacity with which they hold them, but the mere fact that their views 
differ from those of their accusers. The feeling on both sides too often is, "I am 
not convinced by your arguments because your arguments are unconvincing; 
you are not convinced by my arguments because you are dogmatic." 
Of course mathematicians feel that mathematics is pure reason and there-
fore immune to such controversy. But there are plenty of controversies in 
mathematics. How else can Axler's and my difference regarding linear algebra 
be described? His choice of title is—I assume—intended as a joke, just as I am 
joking when I say that my linear algebra book had already done it right. But, 
in both cases, not really. And I expect that if you ask the first mathematician 
who comes along which of us is right, the reply will be that both are wrong, 
and the right way to do linear algebra is . . . . 
So, having established that it is a mere matter of opinion, let me explain, 
if not why I am right, at least why my opinion differs from Axler's. His main

191 
goal is to avoid determinants, for the reason that the formula for determinants 
is difficult to motivate, contrary to the modern style of mathematics and, as 
Axler shows, avoidable. I agree with him that the formula for determinants is 
daunting, but I believe that determinants, like a boulder in the path, need to 
be dealt with, not avoided. They are central to linear algebra—specifically to 
the solution of systems of linear equations—and the sooner students can be 
brought to use them and be comfortable with them, the better. My main goal 
in Linear Algebra, by contrast, was to deal with the subject in an algorithmic 
way that I have found through teaching makes sense to students and gives 
them the tools they need to solve problems in linear algebra. (Also, the book 
defines determinants without the formula in a natural way that is explained 
below.) 
The early chapters are largely devoted to the following theorem. Let two 
m X n matrices of integers be called equivalent if one can be transformed 
into the other by a sequence of steps in which a row is added to or subtracted 
from an adjacent row or a column is added to or subtracted from an adjacent 
column. 
Theorem. 
Given two m x n matrices of integers, determine whether they 
are equivalent. 
Let an m X n matrix of integers be called strongly diagonal if it is 
diagonal (that is, the entry in the ith row of the jth column is zero whenever 
i 7^ j), if each diagonal entry is a multiple of its predecessor on the diagonal, 
and if the diagonal entries are nonnegative, except that the entry in the lower 
right corner may be negative when the matrix is square. The theorem is proved 
by giving an algorithm that transforms a given m x n matrix of integers into 
a strongly diagonal one and proving that two strongly diagonal matrices are 
equivalent only if they are equal. In short, the theorem is proved by showing 
that strongly diagonal form is a canonical form for matrices with respect to 
this equivalence relation. (Strongly diagonal form is very close to what is often 
called Smith normal form in honor of H. J. S. Smith.) 
The algorithm is simple. (In the book it is given in two stages: the rules for 
reducing to diagonal form in Chapter 2 and the additional rules for reducing to 
strongly diagonal form in Chapter 5.) The hard part of the proof is the proof 
that if two square diagonal matrices are equivalent, then the products of their 
diagonal entries are equal. That the absolute values of these products are equal 
is comparatively easy to prove, so the proof comes down to showing that the 
signs are the same. The investigation of the sign of the product of the diagonal 
entries in equivalent diagonal square matrices motivates the definition of the 
determinant of a square matrix as the product of the diagonal entries of 
an equivalent diagonal matrix; the main thing to be proved then becomes the 
theorem needed to make this definition valid, namely, the statement that if two 
square diagonal matrices are equivalent, then the products of their diagonal 
entries are the same. In fact, the difficult point of the proof can be put even 
more starkly: Let J be the strongly diagonal matrix that is the nxn 
identity 

192 
5 Miscellany 
matrix In with the last diagonal entry changed to —1. Prove that J is not 
equivalent to 7^. 
At first glance, this theorem seems to have little to do with linear algebra 
as it is generally thought of (vector spaces, linear maps, bases, etc.), but it 
provides an algorithmic solution to the core problem of linear algebra: Given 
an m X n matrix and a column matrix Y of length ?7i, find all column matrices 
X of length n for which AX = y. In linear algebra courses, the matrices are 
usually assumed to have real number entries, but the limit process inherent 
in the notion of a real number has nothing to do with linear algebra per se, 
and a more reasonable assumption is that the entries are rational numbers. 
The denominators can be cleared in order to translate the problem into one in 
which A and Y have integer entries, and the problem becomes that of finding 
all solutions X of AX — Y with rational entries (with, naturally, a preference 
for solutions whose entries are integers). 
If matrices A and B are equivalent, the solution of AX — Yis equivalent 
to the solution of BX' = Y' ^ because the column operations used to transform 
A into B can be regarded as invertible transformations of X into X' ^ while 
the row operations are invertible transformations of Y into Y'. Therefore, 
it suffices to solve AX — Y for diagonal matrices, which can be done by 
inspection. For example, DX = F for a diagonal matrix D (not necessarily 
square) has a solution X for every Y if and only if D has a nonzero entry in 
each row, which implies, in particular, that the number m of rows of D is no 
greater than the number n of columns. Similarly, DX determines X if and 
only if D has a nonzero entry in each column, which implies, in particular, 
that m > n. Thus, the equation AX = Y can be inverted to express y as a 
function of X only when m = n^ whether or not A is diagonal. Moreover, a 
square matrix is invertible if and only if the product of the diagonal entries of 
an equivalent diagonal matrix (which, at this point of the development, has 
not yet been shown to be independent of the choice of the equivalent diagonal 
matrix) is nonzero. 
// students found it helpful to think of mathematics in terms of sets and 
functions, this could all be told to them in the usual way: An m x n matrix 
describes a particular kind of function—a linear function—from Q'^ to Q"^. 
It can be onto only if n > m and can be one-to-one only if n < ?7i. If a linear 
function is both one-to-one and onto, then its inverse function is a linear 
function, which is to say that the square matrix of coefficients of the given 
function has an inverse matrix. 
Time after time in teaching the course I have decided that I surely could 
explain these facts of linear algebra in terms of linear functions in a way that 
the students would find helpful, and time after time the effort has failed. 
The statement that a function is one-to-one seems indistinguishable from the 
definition of a function for most students. Confusion about the difference be-
tween the statement that / is a function from Q^ to Q ^ and the statement 
that / is onto Q^ is compounded by the fact that different mathematicians 
mean different things when they talk about the "range" of a function. Class

discussions bog down in terminological and conceptual issues that have noth-
ing to do with linear algebra. These experiences have convinced me that the 
set-function conceptualization is not helpful for students of linear algebra. 
Perhaps it will work the other way around—a knowledge of linear algebra 
may help teach notions of sets and functions—but in my experience it does 
not work the way it is currently supposed to. 
The above theorem and related topics form the substance of the first six 
chapters. Chapter 7 is on Moore-Penrose generalized inverses. For every 
mxn 
matrix A of rational numbers, there is a unique n x m matrix of rational 
numbers B for which AB and BA are both symmetric and the equations 
ABA = A and BAB = B both hold. This matrix B is the Moore-Penrose 
generalized inverse of A, or the "mate" of A, as I call it for short. Clearly, if B 
is the mate of A^ then A is the mate of B. The main property of mates is that 
BY is the best solution, in the least squares sense, of the equation AX = Y 
for any column matrix Y of length m. (More precisely, when ||M|p denotes 
the sum of the squares of the entries of a matrix M, ||1^ — AX|p attains its 
minimum value when X = BY and, among all column matrices X of length 
n for which this minimum is attained, X = BY is the one for which ||X|p is 
smallest.) 
Chapter 8 generalizes the theorem stated above from the case of matrices 
of integers to the case of matrices of polynomials in one indeterminate x with 
rational coefficients. In this case, rather than restricting to addition or sub-
traction of an adjacent row or column, one allows subtraction of any multiple 
of a row or column from an adjacent row or column, where the multipliers are 
polynomials in x with rational coefficients. (In the case of integer matrices, the 
two definitions are the same because subtraction of an arbitrary integer mul-
tiple can be achieved by repeated additions or subtractions.) The condition 
that the nonzero diagonal entries of a strongly diagonal matrix must be posi-
tive is replaced by the condition that they must be monic unless, again, they 
occur in the lower right corner of a square matrix. Once again, every matrix 
is equivalent to a strongly diagonal matrix, and strongly diagonal matrices 
are equivalent only if they are equal. In this way, the problem of determining 
whether two given matrices are equivalent is solved. 
This solution leads to the proof of the following important theorem of 
intermediate linear algebra: Two n x n matrices of rational numbers A and 
B are similar if there is an invertible n x n matrix of rational numbers P for 
which A = 
P-^BP. 
Theorem. 
Given two nxn matrices of rational numbers, determine whether 
they are similar. 

194

Proof. It is not difficult to prove* that A is similar to B if and only ii xl — A 
is equivalent to xl — B when both are regarded as matrices whose entries are 
polynomials in x with rational coefficients. (Here / denotes the nx n identity 
matrix.) Therefore, the algorithm of Chapter 8 for solving this latter problem 
solves the problem of the theorem. 
The characteristic polynomial of a square matrix A is the determinant 
of xl — A. As follows from what has just been said, similar matrices have the 
same characteristic polynomial. The converse of this statement is false, as is 
shown by the fact that the matrix A = [^ 
|] is not similar to the 2 x 2 
identity matrix. In fact, the strongly diagonal matrix equivalent to xl — A 
in this case is [^ 
(3^^1)2], not [^~^ 
x - i ] ' "^^^ m i n i m u m polynomial of 
a square matrix A is the last diagonal entry of the strongly diagonal matrix 
equivalent to xl — A. The minimum polynomial of a matrix is easily shown 
to be the greatest common divisor of the polynomials of which it is a root 
(when the constant term of the polynomial is interpreted as a multiple of A^, 
and A^ is interpreted as / ) . For example, in the case of the matrix A just 
considered, ^4 is a root of f{x) if and only if f{x) is a multiple of J:^ — 2x + 1. 
By the above, similar matrices have the same minimum polynomial, but this 
necessary condition for two matrices to be similar is still not sufficient. Such 
considerations lead to the study of the elementary divisors of a matrix A, 
which are certain powers of irreducible polynomials (the elementary divisors 
of / are x — 1 and x — 1, while [J 
J] has just one elementary divisor (x — 1)^) 
whose product is the characteristic polynomial; they are easily described in 
terms of the strongly diagonal matrix equivalent to xl — A, and they do 
determine the similarity class of A. The elementary divisors are closely related 
to the rational canonical form of a matrix. The Jordan canonical form of 
a matrix, a subject that is much taught, and in my opinion overemphasized, 
in intermediate linear algebra courses, is the rational canonical form if one 
works over the complex numbers rather than the rational numbers, or, better, 
if one works over an algebraic extension of Q that splits the characteristic 
polynomial of the matrix. 
A matrix is diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix, or, what is 
the same, if its elementary divisors all have degree 1. The methods of Chapter 
9 not only make it possible to determine whether a given matrix is diagonal-
izable, they make it possible, when it is diagonalizable, to construct a similar 
diagonal matrix. However, this solution of the problem "determine whether 
a given matrix is diagonalizable" does not solve the problem of "diagonaliz-
ing" symmetric matrices in the sense of the spectral theorem because it tells 
only whether a symmetric matrix of rational numbers is similar to a diagonal 
matrix of rational numbers. 
This proof is marred by a misstatement in the first—and so far only—printing of 
the book. On p. 92, E should be assumed to have polynomial entries and D to 
have rational number entries.

Chapter 10 is devoted to the (finite-dimensional) spectral theorem, which 
states that symmetric matrices are similar to diagonal matrices of real num-
bers. In the strict sense, this is not a theorem of linear algebra because it 
involves limits in an essential way: The equivalent diagonal matrix normally 
contains irrational numbers. This topic warrants an essay of its own.

Essay 5.4 The Spectral Theorem 
I remember trying unsuccessfully to concoct a constructive proof of the spec-
tral theorem for symmetric matrices as long ago as 1964. It was only while 
writing my linear algebra book in the early 1990s that I realized that the 
eigenvectors 
would follow easily once the eigenvalues 
had been constructed, 
and that the eigenvalues could be described constructively, in most cases, as 
places where the characteristic polynomial changed sign. This does not cover 
the case of multiple eigenvalues, but while I was developing the ideas in Chap-
ter 9 of Linear Algebra it became clear to me that the important polynomial 
is not the characteristic 
polynomial 
of the symmetric matrix but its 
minimum 
polynomial, 
which in the case of a symmetric matrix has no multiple roots. In 
this way, the geometrically fascinating principal axes theorem for symmetric 
matrices reappeared as the rather modest assertion that the minimum 
poly-
nomial 
of a symmetric 
matrix 
changes sign a number 
of times equal to its 
degree. Once this is known to be true, simple bisection determines all of the 
eigenvalues as real numbers, and simple linear algebra over a splitting field of 
the minimum polynomial suffices to determine the corresponding eigenvectors. 
Once the problem was reduced in this way, Kronecker's work on Sturm's the-
orem helped me solve it finally to my satisfaction. The solution was included 
in the last chapter of Linear Algebra, where, as far as I know, no one has ever 
read it. Here it is once again, with a few simplifications and improvements. 
Theorem. 
Given a symmetric 
matrix S whose entries are integers, let 
f{x) 
be its minimum 
polynomial, 
and let m be the degree of f{x). 
Construct 
m-\-l 
rational numbers XQ < xi < X2 < - - - < Xm with the property that f{xi-i) 
and 
f{xi) 
have opposite signs for i = \, 2, ..., 
m. 
Proof. If 772 = 1, then f{x) 
= x + c, and one can simply set XQ — —N and 
xi = N for a sufficiently large number N. Assume, therefore, that m > 1. 
The function* tv {g{S)h{S)), 
defined for pairs of polynomials 
{g{x),h{x)) 
with rational coefficients, can be regarded as a symmetric bilinear function 
from Q[x] mod f{x) 
to Q. If h{x) has the property that tr {g{S)h{S)) 
= 0 
for all polynomials g{x), then h{x) = 0 mod f{x), 
because tr (/i(S')^) is the 
sum of the squares of the entries of the matrix h{S) (because S and there-
fore h{S) are symmetric), so the case g = h oi tv {g{S)h{S)) 
= 0 implies 
h{S) = 0. Therefore, the m x m matrix of rational numbers that represents 
this symmetric bilinear form with respect to the basis 1, x, x^, . . . , 
x'^~^ 
of Q[x] mod f{x) 
is invertible, from which it follows that every linear form 
Q[x] mod f{x) 
-^ Q can be expressed as g{x) ^-^ tr {g{S)h{S)) 
for some poly-
nomial h{x) with rational coefficients. In this way, a polynomial h{x) with 
rational coefficients can be constructed for which tr {g{S)h{S)) 
= gi for any

entries.

If it is stipulated that degh < m^ this property determines h when f{x) is 
given. When h{x) is defined to be the polynomial determined in this way, h{x) 
is relatively prime to /(x), because a common divisor d{x) of f{x) and h{x) of 
positive degree, say f{x) = qi{x)d{x) and h{x) = q2{x)d{x)^ where deg^ > 0, 
would imply deggi < m, say degg'i -ht = m, where t > 0, so x^~^qi{x) would 
be a polynomial of degree m—1 and tr {S*~^qi{S)h{S)) would be nonzero, con-
trary to S'-^qi{S)h{S) 
= S*-^qi{S)q2{S)d{S) 
= S'-^q2{S)f{S) 
= 0. There-
fore, h{x) is invertible mod f{x). 
Let Sm{x) = /(x), let Sm-i be the unique inverse of h{x) mod f{x) whose 
degree is less than m, and let later terms of the sequence Sm{x), 
Sm-i{x), 
Sm-2{x)^ ..., Sk{x) be defined by defining Si{x) to be the negative of the 
remainder when 5^+2 (^) is divided by 5^+1 (x). The sequence terminates with 
the last nonzero term Sk{x) generated in this way. It will be shown that each 
Si has the form Si{x) = si'^x^ + s^_^x^~^ H 
hSQ\ where the first coefficient 
5^ , call it Ci, is positive. In particular, si{x) has degree 1 with a positive 
leading coefficient, and the final nonzero term SQ is a positive constant. 
For any g{x) = gix^"^ 
+ g2X^~'^ -\ 
h gm, the identity 
tT{g{S)sm-i{S)h(Sf)=g^ 
follows from the definitions of h{x) and Sm-i{x), because Sm-i{S)h{S) 
= /. 
Use of Sm-2{x) = -Sm{x) + qm-i{x)sm-i{x), 
whcrc qm-i{x) 
is the quo-
tient in the division that defines 5^-2(^)5 in ti {g{S)sm-2{S)h{S)^) 
gives 
- 0 + ti{g{S)qm-i{S)sm-i{S)h{S)'^), 
which is the coefficient of x^"^ in 
g{x)qm-i{x), 
provided g{x)qm-i{x) 
has degree less than m. Since 
Sm{x) — x'^ + • • • 
and 
Sm-i{x) = mx'^~^ + • • • 
(the latter because tr {sm-i{S)sm-i{S)h{S)'^) 
= tr (/) = m), it is clear that 
qm-i{x) has degree 1 and leading coefficient 1/m, so 
tr 
{g{S)sm-2{S)h{Sf)=g,/m 
whenever g{x) = gix'^~^ + • • •• The general case of this formula, which states 
that

nomial whose degree is at most i, will now be proved. 
Note first that the case i = m — 2 already proved implies, since Sm-2{x) 
has degree at most 771 — 2, that the coefficient Cm-2 of x'^~'^ in Sm-2{x) 
satisfies c^_2/m = tr {{sm-2{S)h{S))'^), 
which is the sum of the squares of 
the entries of Sm-2{S)h{S) 
and is therefore positive unless Sm-2{S)h{S) 
= 0; 
thus Cm-2 is positive, because h{S) is invertible and Sm-2{S) = 0 would imply

Therefore, the assertion that Si{x) has degree i and positive leading coefficient 
is proved for i = TTI, m — 1, m — 2.

{g{S)qi+i{S)s,+i{S)h{Sf) 
because ^(x)g'i+i(x) = ^^^''^^ • x'^'^^ + • • •. In particular, Si{S) ^ 0. The case 
g{x) = 5^(x) of this identity implies that Ci/ci-^i is the positive rational num-
ber tr {{si{S)h{S))'^)^ so Si(x) has degree i and a positive leading coefficient, 
as was to be shown. 
A polynomial of degree i cannot change sign more than i times, as can be 
seen as follows: If F(x) is a polynomial, if a and b are rational numbers for 
which F{a) < F{b), and if c is the midpoint of the interval [a, b], then the rate 
of increase of F on the interval is the average of the rate of increase on the 
two halves of the interval [a, c] and [c, 6], which is to say that 
F{b) - F{a) _ 1 fF{c) - F{a) 
F{b) - F{c) 
b — a 
2 \ 
c — a 
b — c 
as follows from c — a = b — c = ^{b — a). Select the half interval on which 
the rate of increase is larger, or, if the two rates are the same, select the half 
interval on the right. Iteration of this bisection and selection rule determines a 
nested sequence of subintervals of [a, 6], each half as long as its predecessor, and 
therefore determines a real number (their "intersection"). Since the derivative* 
F'{x) of F{x) at this real number is the limit of a nondecreasing sequence of 
positive rational numbers (namely, of the values of {F{b) — F{a))/{b — a), 
where a and b wee the endpoints of the successive intervals), the real number 
determined by the nested intervals is one at which F^x) is positive. In this 
way, any interval on which F{x) increases contains a real number at which 
F'{x) is positive, and therefore contains a rational number at which F'{x) 
is positive. Similarly, any interval on which F decreases contains a rational 
number at which F'{x) is negative. Therefore, if a polynomial with rational 
coefficients of degree i changes sign at least cr > 0 times, then z > 0, and 
its derivative is a polynomial of degree i — 1 that changes sign at least a — 1 
times. Repetition of this argument a times gives a polynomial of degree i — a, 
so z > cr. 
Moreover, if i nonoverlapping intervals on which a polynomial of degree i 
changes sign are given, bisection of each of them (but moving the midpoint

h) — F{x) = F'{x)h + • • •, where the omitted terms all contain h?.

slightly if it happens to be a root of the polynomial) gives 2i nonoverlapping 
intervals; the polynomial changes sign on at least i of them and, as was just 
shown, on no more than i of them. Therefore, repetition of the bisection 
process constructs i real roots of the polynomial and shows that the values of 
such a polynomial 
for two rational numbers a and b have opposite signs if and 
only if the interval 
[a, b] contains 
an odd number of its i real roots, provided 
neither a nor 6 is a root. 
For each i = 1, 2, ..., 
m, Si{x) has i real roots, and the number of real 
roots of Si{x) that are greater than a given one of them is equal to the 
number 
of real roots of Si-i{x) 
that are greater than it, as can be proved inductively 
as follows: 
This statement is obviously true in the case i = 1, because a polynomial 
of degree 1 has just one root, and no roots of SQ are greater than it. Suppose 
now that it is true for a given i, and let pi, p2^ .. •, Pi be the real roots of 
5i(x), in ascending order. By the inductive hypothesis, the number of real 
roots of Si-i{x) 
greater than pj is i — j ^ so, since Si-i{x) 
is positive for all 
sufficiently large values of x, Si-i{pj) 
has the sign (—1)*"-^. (A polynomial 
of degree z — 1 has at most i — 1 roots, counted with multiplicities, so the 
roots of Si-i{x) 
are simple and Si-i{x) 
changes sign at each root.) Since the 
formula Si-^i{x)-\-Si-i{x) 
== qi{x)si{x) 
implies* that Si-\-i{x) and s^_i(x) have 
opposite signs at a root of Si{x)^ it follows that the sign of s^+i(x) at pj is 
(—1)*"-^+^. Because the leading coefficient of Si-i{x) 
is positive, when yo^+i is 
chosen to be a large enough number and when —po is chosen to be a large 
enough number, the same rule describes the sign of 5^+i(x) at all of the real 
numbers po, pi, . . . , p^+i. Since these signs alternate, it follows that 
Si^i{x) 
changes sign z + 1 times, and therefore has i -h 1 real roots. Moreover, the j t h 
one of these roots lies in the j t h interval where s^+i(x) changes sign, which 
places it between pj and pj+i and shows that the number of roots of s^+l(x) 
greater than a given root of Si-^i{x) is the number of p^s greater than it, as 
was to be shown. 
Thus, sufficiently close rational approximations to the roots of 
Sm-i{x), 
together with a pair of values ±A^ for a large number A/", demonstrate m 
changes of sign in Sm{x) — f{x), 
as required.

fore, there are polynomials a{x) and /3{x) with rational coefficients for which 
a{x)si{x) + p{x)si-i{x) 
= 1. If p is a real root of Si{x), then 1 = 
/3{p)si-i{p), 
which implies that the real number Si-i{p) 
is nonzero. Similarly, a root of 
Si-i{x) 
is not a zero of Si{x). Thus, when p is a root of Si{x), the equation 
Si-\-i{p) + Si-i{p) = 0 implies that Si+i(p) and Si-i{p) have opposite signs.

Deduction. All that is needed is to construct the matrix that is orthogonal 
projection on the eigenspace corresponding to each eigenvalue p^, which is 
to say orthogonal projection on the kernel oi S — pil for all roots pi of the 
minimum polynomial of S. (To say that a matrix is an orthogonal projection 
means that it is symmetric and idempotent.) Each of these orthogonal pro-
jections is easy to find, because the orthogonal projection on the kernel of a 
symmetric matrix M is / — Q, where Q is orthogonal projection on the image 
of M, which is to say that Q is M multiplied on the right by the Moore-
Penrose generalized inverse of M. Therefore, the spectral decomposition of 
S can be given once the Moore-Penrose generalized inverses of the matrices 
I — S -\- pil are found. Note that the computation of the Moore-Penrose gen-
eralized inverse of a matrix requires exact computations with the entries, so 
it becomes possible only after a splitting field for the minimum polynomial is 
constructed; the interpretation of the p's and P's as real numbers requires an 
identification of the splitting field with a subfield of the field of real numbers.

Essay 5.5 Kronecker as One of E. T. Bell's "Men of 
Mathematics" 
Kronecker laid himself out in 1891 to criticize Cantoris work to his stu-
dents in Berlin, and it became clear that there was no room for them both 
under one roof As Kronecker was already in possession, Cantor resigned 
himself to staying out in the cold.—E. T. Bell, Men of Mathematics^ p. 
570. 
Discussing Lindemann's proof that n is transcendental, Kronecker asked, 
^'Of what use is your beautiful investigation regarding TT? Why study 
such problems, since irrational [and hence transcendental] numbers do not 
exist?''^ihid., 
p. 568. 
It is a mistake to take Eric Temple Bell's book Men of Mathematics too 
seriously. Bell set out to write a popular book about the history of mathe-
matics, and he succeeded admirably. From its publication in 1937 until today, 
the book has amused and inspired several generations of amateur and pro-
fessional mathematicians, including mine. His outrageousness is part of his 
winning style. But in spicing up his stories he did create distortions, extrapo-
lations, and outright falsehoods that have since become common "knowledge." 
On the whole, the picture Bell paints of Kronecker is not negative. "His 
skepticism was his greatest contribution," the table of contents says of Kro-
necker, and at many points Kronecker is made the respectable spokesman for 
those who objected to the growing use of the transfinite. Kronecker would 
probably have preferred to have less about his philosophy and more about his 
mathematical achievements in the book, but his importance and his contri-
butions are certainly not slighted. Unfortunately, the word "vicious" is used 
more than once to describe his criticism of others, principally Weierstrass and 
Cantor, and, as I have said in the Preface, I do not feel this word is justified. 
I have recently come to understand what lies behind the two statements 
of Bell that are quoted above, and in explaining them in this essay I hope to 
shed some light on Kronecker and his ideas, as well as on Bell, his methods, 
and his lack of credibility. 
In the first quotation Bell implies that it was one thing to criticize pro-
fessional colleagues and quite another to do it in front of students. That was 
surely Cantor's view of it when he bitterly complained to W. Thome in a 
letter dated 21 September 1891 that Kronecker in public lectures had told his 
"immature audience" that Cantor's work was "mathematical sophistry" [56, 
document 38]. 
Bell was undoubtedly referring to this letter of Cantor's when he wrote 
of Kronecker's 1891 criticism of Cantor, but I doubt that his evidence of 
the alleged criticism was as reliable as that contained in the transcript of 
Kronecker's 1891 lectures that was recently published [45]. Despite Cantor's 
claim that Kronecker had denounced a specific work of his, the published 
version of Kronecker's lectures does not even mention Cantor, much less the 

202 
5 Miscellany 
specific work Cantor cites. The word "sophistry" is indeed used [45, p. 247] in 
connection with a transformation of i/-dimensional space into a space of some 
other dimension, which Cantor might reasonably imagine to be a reference to 
his work, but, as the editors of the lectures point out, the lectures were given 
just one year after Peano published his famous curve that fills an area of the 
plane. 
It is of course possible that Cantor knew more than we do about Kro-
necker's actual words; he says in the letter that he had obtained a copy of 
the lectures by chance, but nothing of the sort is to be found among his sur-
viving papers. However, it is equally possible that he was overreacting to a 
simple statement of opinion that may not even have been directed at him and 
that had, in the version that has survived, no tinge of personal animosity. For 
his part. Cantor says Kronecker's "entire course of lectures is a muddled and 
superficial mix of undigested ideas, boasts, unmotivated name-calling, and 
rotten jokes."* If Bell's impression of Kronecker's remarks came from this 
characterization of them it is easy to see why he used the word "vicious," but 
the surviving version of the lectures in no way deserves Cantor's description. 
Finally, before Kronecker's hostility can be taken, as Bell does take it, to 
be the cause of Cantor's spending his entire career at Halle instead of being 
called to Berlin, one must show that somewhere there was someone who felt 
Cantor was a qualified and desirable candidate for appointment at Berlin. The 
fact is that Kronecker died in the very year 1891 that these lectures were given, 
so there was very soon no question of their needing to live "under one roof." 
Weierstrass survived Kronecker, and when Weierstrass died he was succeeded 
by H. A. Schwarz, no friend of Kronecker's views, but I am unaware of any 
effort to bring Cantor to Berlin. 
When, as a graduate student, I first read the passage in Bell's book about 
Kronecker's attitude toward TT, I think I was as indignant as Bell wanted me to 
be with the claim that TT might not "exist." Years later, when I encountered the 
same anecdote in Constance Reid's book Hilbert, I had come to take a great 
interest in Kronecker and his ideas, so this time rather than being indignant, 
I was puzzled and unsure that the anecdote was authentic. Neither Bell nor 
Reid cites a source. 
Kronecker's works show no inhibition about the use of TT. His papers on 
analytic number theory and those on elliptic functions are full of TT'S. In the 
first lecture in his course of lectures on number theory [44], he refers without 
apology to "the transcendental number TT from geometry" and notes that it 
can be defined b y ^ = 1 — ^ + ^ — y + ---.I am not aware that he ever expressed 
any reservations about any particular transcendental number. What he had 
reservations about was the notion that the totality of real numbers could be 
treated as a mathematical entity. Why would he have had any reservations 
about the "existence" of TT, or even about the meaningfulness of Lindemann's

theorem that TT was transcendental? On the other hand, Bell's quotation of 
Kronecker could not be a mere invention. 
A few years ago, I found what I took to be Bell's source in Florian Cajori's 
History of Mathematics 
[7], where Cajori writes, "[Kronecker] once paradoxi-
cally remarked to Lindemann: 'Of what use is your beautiful research on the 
number TT? Why cogitate over such problems, when really there are no irra-
tional numbers whatever?' " But Cajori gives no source either. His book was 
originally published in 1894, which would put it only three years away from 
Kronecker and make plausible the hypothesis that Cajori learned the story 
through word of mouth. Only much later did I read carefully the copyright 
page of the Chelsea reprint edition I had. There was a "second, revised and 
enlarged edition" in 1919, of which the Chelsea edition was a reprint. When 
I finally tracked down a copy of the 1894 edition in microfiche, I learned that 
the story of Kronecker and n had been added in 1919, twenty-eight years after 
Kronecker's death. 
Then, in June of 2003, while writing to Professor David Rowe of Mainz 
about a different question, I had the happy thought to ask him whether he 
knew where Cajori might have heard the story. By return e-mail he was able 
give me what seems certain to be the correct source.* In 1904, Teubner pub-
lished a German translation of Poincare's Science et Hypothese annotated by 
Lindemann [54]. One of Lindemann's notes—note (4) to page 20—cites Kro-
necker's advocacy of restating the theory of algebraic quantities entirely in 
terms of the theory of polynomials with integer coefficients (see Essay 1.1) 
and goes on to say: 
Spater ging Kronecker noch weiter, indem er die Existenz irrationaler 
Zahlen leugnete; so sagte er mir in seiner lebhaften und zu Paradoxen 
geneigten Art einmal: "Was nlitzt uns Ihre schone Untersuchung iiber die 
Zahl TT? Wozu das Nachdenken iiber solche Probleme, wenn es doch gar 
keine irrationalen Zahlen gibt?" (Later, Kronecker went even further and 
denied the existence of irrational numbers; thus, he once said to me in 
his lively and paradoxical way, "Of what use to us are your beautiful re-
searches about the number TT? Why consider such problems when in fact 
there are no irrational numbers?") 
Since Lindemann published this more than ten years after Kronecker's death, 
we are entitled to take his quotation marks with a grain of salt. Clearly, 
Lindemann felt that Kronecker was teasing him—not unkindly it would seem 
in view of the appearance of the word "beautiful"—but Kronecker's exact 
words, which are essential to an understanding of the underlying criticism, 
would probably have been difficult for Lindemann to recall after ten minutes, 
not to mention ten years. 
* Their different English versions of the alleged quotation suggest that Bell may 
have based his telling of the story directly on Lindemann, not on Cajori's retelling. 

204 
5 Miscellany 
That Kronecker would prefer to state Lindemann's result in a way that 
made no reference to the totality of transcendental numbers comes as no 
surprise. If his meaning was simply that he would prefer to state the result in 
a form something like, "For any polynomial f{x) in one variable with integer 
coefficients the sequence of rational numbers /(I — ^ + | — ^ + ---H- ^^,-^) can 
be bounded away from zero," no one would be scandalized, and the statement 
could not be used to ridicule Kronecker's views. I certainly do not claim 
to know what the point of Kronecker's criticism might have been—it could 
have been the form in which Lindemann stated his result or the methods he 
used or many things in between—but it seems certain to me that he would 
have regarded the result as having meaning and even as having considerable 
interest. 
For the fun of it, we can indulge Bell in his extravagant caricatures of our 
mathematical forebears, but we should be careful not to let them affect our 
understanding of the history of our subject. In particular, we should not let 
Kronecker's role as Bell's gadfly obscure his true-life role as a great mathe-
matician whose works are classics.
