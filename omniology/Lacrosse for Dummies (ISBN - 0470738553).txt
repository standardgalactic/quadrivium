About the Authors
Jim Hinkson: Jim has been involved in the game of lacrosse since he was 19. He played 
lacrosse for 11 years and was a member of six Canadian national minor championship 
teams. He has coached at every level of lacrosse, from house league to professional, 
participating in two Canadian junior championships, and winning one. He also coached 
teams in Toronto, Whitby, and St. Catharines, Ontario, as well as the New York Saints 
and New Jersey Storms, who competed in the National Lacrosse League. Hinkson, who 
grew up on a farm in Oshawa, Ontario, has authored fi ve books on lacrosse and coach-
ing. Hinkson was the primary author of the fi rst edition of Lacrosse For Dummies, which 
focused mainly on box lacrosse.
Joe Lombardi: Joe is one of the most established, respected, and versatile multimedia 
journalists in the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut tri-state area. He has worked as an 
editor and reporter for daily and weekly newspapers; as a writer for national magazines; 
as a host, announcer, and analyst on television and radio; and as associate publisher and 
contributor for several sports-related Web sites, including Rivals.com, CBS MaxPreps 
(www.maxpreps.com), and LaxLessons.com.
One constant throughout Joe’s career has been his work on the lacrosse scene. He was 
a fi xture on the scene during the sport’s rapid growth. A New York City native, Joe grew 
up in historic Irvington in New York’s Hudson Valley region. In 2008, he was named Man 
of the Year by the Lacrosse Coaches Association of Section 1 (Westchester, Rockland, 
Putnam, and Dutchess counties in New York). A graduate of the University of Dayton in 
Ohio, Joe is the primary author of Lacrosse For Dummies, 2nd Edition.


Dedication
For Chuck Howard, a sports broadcasting pioneer, who taught me about lacrosse 
and broadcasting, and who would’ve loved to have seen the popularity the sport 
he loved now enjoys.
—Joe Lombardi


Authors’ Acknowledgments
Jim Hinkson: Thanks to my former teammates, players, and friends in lacrosse who 
have touched my life as I journeyed along my whirlwind lacrosse path. From Oshawa to 
Brooklin to Detroit to Peterborough to Windsor to Philadelphia to Rexdale to Whitby to 
St. Catharines to New York to Toronto to New Jersey, it has been a great ride with lots of 
ups and downs.
Joe Lombardi: I’ve watched and covered hundreds of men’s and women’s lacrosse 
games, but writing this book allowed me to enjoy a true fi rst: I became a student of the 
game. Many thanks to the countless coaches and players for all their invaluable insights 
and for their eagerness and openness to help. I am especially grateful to Joe Alberici, Ric 
Beardsley, Kristen Carano Bulkley, Paul Carcaterra, Roy Colsey, Tom Interlicchio, and 
Brian Logue for going above and beyond in sharing their knowledge with me. Special 
thanks to two former Loyola University (Maryland) standouts, Jordan and Ryan Rabidou, 
for allowing me access to the valuable drills, practice plans, and plays that are now on 
display at LaxLessons.com. And fi nally, I’m indebted to my friend and colleague, Jim 
Stout, of CBS MaxPreps for generously providing photographs (taken by Stout and Ray 
Nelson) that are published in this new edition of Lacrosse For Dummies.

Foreword
M  
y first memory of lacrosse is from when I was an 11-year-old boy. My 
father and I walked down to the local high school to practice pitching 
on the baseball diamond. Before long, my attention wandered to the football 
field, where a game I had never seen before was being played. At first, I had 
trouble following the game. But soon I began to appreciate how the ball was 
passed from player to player with great speed and accuracy. Over and over, 
this same process was repeated until, finally, a player was close enough to 
the goal to take a shot.
That is the game of lacrosse, my father told me. Well, needless to say, base-
ball practice was over for me — not for the day, not for the summer, but 
forever. I had to play this game. And so it began — my love affair with North 
America’s greatest and fastest game. I was hooked by the speed, the contact, 
the strategy. And I’m sure that a million lacrosse players the world over have 
experienced something similar. To see this game is to love it.
With its unique style, rules, and following, lacrosse is a truly amazing sport. 
It’s a combination of many sports: You can see bits and pieces of football, 
hockey, soccer, and basketball in a lacrosse game — hard, physical contact; 
shooting on goal; running up and down the field at high speed; and offensive 
and defensive strategy.
Lacrosse is an amazing combination of some of the greatest team games in 
the world, and, as such, it has quickly become one of the fastest growing 
sports around. When I started playing, a handful of lacrosse hotbeds existed 
in the United States: Maryland, upstate New York, and New York’s Hudson 
Valley, where I’m from. Those hotbeds were where the game was played at 
its highest level among high school and youth teams. Today, lacrosse has 
exploded into a national phenomenon. Teams from Texas, Florida, California, 
and Colorado are among the many competing at the high school and youth 
level. Colleges are adding both men’s and women’s teams. Why has lacrosse 
grown so quickly? Watch one game, my friend — just watch one game. You’ll 
be hooked, too.

Introduction
L
acrosse is the fastest growing sport in North America, with the record 
number of players and fans in field lacrosse now spearheading that 
growth. In this book, we explore the reasons for this surge in participation 
and fan interest, but if you’ve ever been to a game — or better yet, if you play 
or coach lacrosse — you already know the reasons.
In a nutshell, lacrosse features the physicality of football, the speed and 
quickness of hockey, and the passing and transitions of basketball. Anyone 
can play this sport — from shorter people with speed and quickness to 
bigger people with strength and power. And after you start, it’s very tough to 
stop. Lacrosse is habit forming.
About This Book
The first edition of Lacrosse For Dummies emphasized box lacrosse. In this 
edition, we shift the focus to field lacrosse, but we still offer plenty of infor-
mation and insights on box as well. Both editions have one important thing in 
common: Like the first edition, this book is for players, coaches, and fans at 
all levels of lacrosse.
The beauty of For Dummies books is that you can use them to find what you 
need to know, without having to wade through a bunch of stuff you don’t 
care about. Just pick up the book and start reading anywhere you want. Sure, 
you can read it from front to back, but you don’t have to — you can read 
each chapter on its own, without feeling like you’re in the dark.
Conventions Used in This Book
We don’t use many special conventions in this book, but be aware of the 
following:
 
✓ When we introduce a new term, we put it in italics and define it shortly 
thereafter (often in parentheses).

2
Lacrosse For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
✓ When we give you a list of steps to take in a particular order, we put the 
actionable part of the step in bold so you can easily find what you’re 
supposed to do.
 
✓ When we mention Web addresses and e-mail addresses, we put those in 
monofont so they stand out from the surrounding text.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break 
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that we haven’t put in 
any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using 
one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book, 
pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
Throughout the book, when we refer to box lacrosse, we’re talking about the 
version of the game that is most popular in Canada and that is played exclu-
sively indoors — with fewer players per team and a reduced playing surface. 
Field lacrosse can be played either outdoors or indoors, so, for that reason, 
we don’t use the terms indoor lacrosse or outdoor lacrosse.
Finally, despite the male-oriented names of positions — such as attackman 
and defenseman — most of the information found in this book applies to all 
lacrosse players, male and female. When distinct differences exist between 
men’s lacrosse and women’s lacrosse, we make sure to note them.
What You’re Not to Read
If you’re short on time, you’ll be glad to know that you don’t have to read 
everything to get the information you need. You can safely skip sidebars (text 
in gray boxes); they’re interesting, but not essential to your understanding of 
the topic at hand. You can also skip anything marked with the Technical Stuff 
icon (see “Icons Used in This Book,” later, for more information).

 Introduction
Foolish Assumptions
When we wrote this book, we made a few assumptions about who you are. 
You probably fall into one of the following categories:
 
✓ You know nothing about lacrosse, but you saw it being played some-
where and it piqued your interest. You want to know more.
 
✓ You already play lacrosse, but you want to improve. You’re looking for 
techniques and strategies you can use to up your game.
 
✓ You’re a parent whose son or daughter has started playing lacrosse. You 
want to know what to expect from your kid’s coach, and what exactly 
those kids are doing when they’re out on the field.
 
✓ You’re a coach who wants to read about drills that other coaches run to 
improve their teams.
How This Book Is Organized
Lacrosse For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is presented in five parts, starting with 
the basics of the game — such as the ball and stick, the number of players, 
the equipment used, and the way the game is played. The rest of the book 
moves through how to watch the game, how to become a player, how to 
coach lacrosse, and how to follow the game. So this book can be whatever 
you want it to be — simple and basic or in depth.
Part I: Getting Started
This part gives you a good idea of what the basic game of lacrosse is all 
about, breaking the game down into simple terms and discussing the differ-
ent player roles and positions, as well as some particulars about how the 
game is played. This part also discusses lacrosse equipment and how to get 
dressed so that you’re well protected — a necessity in this sport. Finally, it 
gives you an overview of officiating, so you know what those guys in black-
and-white stripes mean when they wave their arms around.

Lacrosse For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Part II: Playing Lacrosse
How do you score goals and prevent them from being scored? Those are the 
two most simple, yet most critical, aspects of lacrosse. In this part, we take an 
in-depth look at both — providing information that helps you develop offen-
sive and defensive skills. We also take an up-close-and-personal look at what 
it takes to play goalie. We break down all the key components of two of the 
most important parts of lacrosse — the possession game and specialty teams. 
Finally, we tell you what you need to know to become a better player — both 
mentally and physically.
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse
Here, you discover the fundamentals of coaching lacrosse, including building 
a team and preparing for games and practices. We also tell you how a coach 
game coaches, from setting up an offensive system to establishing a defensive 
system and then applying these systems to certain situations in a game. We 
also look at specific offensive formations, as well as specific defensive sets.
Part IV: Following Lacrosse: 
The Fan’s Point of View
Are you new to the game? In this part, we tell you what you should look for 
when watching lacrosse — offense, defense, you name it. We also cover how 
and where you can follow all levels of lacrosse on TV. Then we take an in-depth 
look at “the surge,” which in this case, refers to the continuing growth in the 
popularity of the game. At many colleges and high schools, lacrosse’s popular-
ity is hardly a new phenomenon, so we fill you in on the most tradition-rich 
high school and college programs. Finally, we tell you everything you need to 
know about the two pro leagues — Major League Lacrosse and the National 
Lacrosse League.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This essential part of every For Dummies book is fun because it includes our 
list of the top lacrosse players of all time. Now, considering the fact that this 
list includes men and women, field lacrosse players and box lacrosse players, 

5
 Introduction
you can look at this chapter as the starting point of discussions — and argu-
ments. We also give you ten reasons to get excited about lacrosse (as if you 
needed them!), as well as ten interesting facts about the game.
In the back of this book, we include a couple of resources to share some of 
the nuts and bolts of lacrosse with you. To understand the game, you have 
to understand the language of lacrosse, so we include a glossary of lacrosse 
vocabulary. And the appendix offers some resources for more information on 
lacrosse, including magazines, Web sites, and organizations.
Icons Used in This Book
Every For Dummies book has icons in the margins, to draw attention to impor-
tant tidbits and valuable advice. Lacrosse For Dummies uses the following icons:
 
The Tip icon points you to what some of the best players and coaches have 
to say about the game and how they play and coach it. Anytime you see this 
icon, you’re sure to find suggestions that will help improve your play.
 
The Remember icon points out important information that you want to 
remember.
 
The Warning icon offers some cautionary words about potential safety con-
cerns and other dangers that you may face when playing or coaching lacrosse.
 
Need to know why something happens the way it does in lacrosse? The 
Technical Stuff icon alerts you to information that you can choose to read or 
skip. It’s not necessary to your understanding of the material, but it sure is 
interesting!
 
Whenever we give you information specific to the women’s game, we flag it 
with this icon.
 
Plenty of differences exist between the game of box lacrosse (which is played 
indoors) and the game of field lacrosse (which is typically played outdoors, 
but can also be played inside). This icon helps you sort out the details.

Where to Go from Here
If you’re a beginner or a fan, you may want to turn to the glossary of lacrosse 
terms and their definitions at the back of this book. Or start with Chapters 3 
and 4, where we cover the fundamentals of the game. If you’re a parent and 
new to the sport, turn to Chapter 13 and read about youth lacrosse and 
coaching. If you’re a spectator, Chapter 16 is a great introduction to watch-
ing lacrosse. No matter who you are, Chapter 4 can help you understand the 
rules of the game. If you’re a coach, you may want to start with Part III. Or 
if you’ve already played for a few years and want to pick up some new tips, 
start with Part II. Finally, the Part of Tens appeals to just about everybody. 
Use the index and table of contents to find the information you’re looking for, 
or dive right in with Chapter 1!

Part I
Getting Started

In this part . . .
E
very lacrosse game starts with a faceoff — or, in the 
women’s game, a draw. This part begins this book’s 
play for you. Here, you discover the basics of the game — 
everything you need to get a head start in understanding 
how the game is played. You find out the game’s most fun-
damental elements, including the roles of each player on 
the field or on the floor and the rules of play.

Chapter 1
Lacrosse and You
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a big-picture look at lacrosse
▶ Playing lacrosse
▶ Coaching lacrosse
▶ Watching lacrosse as a fan
T
he popularity of lacrosse is at an all-time high. Why? Because more 
people in more places have been exposed to lacrosse. It really is that 
simple. As anyone who watches the sport for the first time quickly discovers, 
lacrosse is habit forming — some may even say addictive. It combines the 
best attributes of several of the most popular sports around — football, bas-
ketball, hockey, and more. It’s fast moving, challenging, and never dull. Plus, 
you don’t have to have superhuman strength or size to succeed at lacrosse.
In this chapter, we provide a quick overview of the differences between field 
lacrosse (which is typically played outdoors) and box lacrosse (which is 
played indoors), as well as between the men’s and women’s games. Then we 
look at lacrosse from three perspectives — that of the player, the coach, and 
the fan.
Whether you’re playing lacrosse for the first time or looking to improve your 
game, whether you’re coaching a team or you’re a parent or fan, lacrosse — 
and this book — has something to offer you. This chapter gets the ball rolling.
Understanding the Game of Lacrosse
Someone watching a lacrosse game for the first time may be surprised, intimi-
dated, or just plain confused — after all, there’s a lot going on. Players are 
running on and off the field or floor rapidly, possession is often up for grabs, 

10
Part I: Getting Started 
and the hits just keep on coming (except in the women’s game, where con-
tact is not allowed). Lacrosse is a game of running, dodging, spinning, cutting, 
and faking. It offers plenty of excitement — from sprinting all out on a fast 
break to outrunning an opponent for a goal.
Lacrosse is a high-scoring game, which makes it especially exciting for fans. If 
you ever see a shutout in a lacrosse game, mark it on your calendar, because 
chances are, you’ll watch thousands more games and never see another.
With lacrosse, throwing a ball — accurately — is the name of the game. The 
difference between lacrosse and most other sports is that you have to throw 
the ball using a stick, not with your hand.
 
A lacrosse ball is about 8 inches in circumference and about 2½   inches in 
diameter. It weighs a bit more than 5 ounces.
Although it’s not easy, with good instruction and lots of practice, in a short 
time, almost anyone can master the basic skills needed to play the fastest 
game on two feet. In fact, unlike many other team sports where size and 
strength are essential, lacrosse rewards the small and the speedy. Sure, it 
helps to be big (especially if you’re also fast), but small players can excel in 
lacrosse if they’re quick, intelligent, aggressive, and skilled with a stick.
In the following sections, we fill you in on the two forms of lacrosse and the 
ways in which the men’s and women’s games differ.
The two forms of lacrosse: Field and box
Lacrosse comes in two main forms:
 
✓ Field lacrosse: Today, field lacrosse (which got its start with Native 
Americans — see the nearby sidebar “The origins of lacrosse”) is the 
most popular form in the United States. There are 10 or 12 players on 
the field (depending on whether the players are men or women — see 
“Mars and Venus: How the men’s and women’s games differ”). The play-
ing surface is 110 yards long and 60 yards wide for men, a little bigger 
for women. The goals are 6 feet high and 6 feet wide.
 
✓ Box lacrosse: Box, which is most popular in Canada, is played on the 
equivalent of an ice hockey rink, in which the ice has been replaced 
with artificial turf. Box lacrosse has fewer players than field lacrosse — 
only 6. The players are assigned different roles — offense, transition, or 
defense — depending on their position. The playing surface is smaller 
(180 to 200 feet long and 80 to 90 feet wide), the goals are smaller (4 feet 

11
 Chapter 1: Lacrosse and You
high and 4 feet wide), the goalies wear more protection, and there is 
more scoring than there is in field lacrosse.
 
 Box lacrosse has been strictly a male domain for most of its history. But 
lately, some upstart women’s leagues have formed in Canada.
For more on the rules of lacrosse, and the differences between field and box 
lacrosse, check out Chapter 4.
Mars and Venus: How the men’s 
and women’s games differ
Men’s lacrosse is one of the oldest sports in North America — possibly 
dating back to the 12th century (see the nearby sidebar “The origins of 
lacrosse”). But the first women’s lacrosse game wasn’t played until 1890 
in Scotland; it wasn’t played in the United States until 1926 in Baltimore, 
Maryland. And women’s lacrosse wasn’t played at the Division I level in the 
National Collegiate Athletic Association until 1982.
The field lacrosse game for women has grown and evolved over the years. 
For example, formal boundaries weren’t instituted until 2006 (before that, no 
hard boundaries existed), and you can count on more changes in the wom-
en’s game in the years to come.
The origins of lacrosse
Lacrosse was first played by Native Americans, 
usually as a way to settle disputes between 
tribes or to celebrate and honor religious ritu-
als. The Cherokee Indians referred to the sport 
as Tewaaraton (which means “little brother of 
war”) and actually used it to train for battle.
In these early contests, the field of play could 
stretch for hundreds and hundreds of yards 
with no boundaries to speak of, teams could 
number well into the hundreds, and a game 
could last for several days. The small, speedy, 
and healthy players would’ve been the earliest 
stars of the game.
The sport was called baggataway by the 
Six Nations of the Iroquois in the area that is 
now western New York and southern Ontario. 
Baggataway is an Algonquian verb meaning “to 
hit with something.” The Iroquois narrowed the 
number of participants significantly (to around 
15 per team), set up goals, and established 
boundaries.
The name lacrosse was born when French 
explorers first witnessed the sport. The French 
thought that the stick looked like the staff of a 
bishop — which was known in France as la 
crosse.

12
Part I: Getting Started 
One thing is for sure, though: The game has caught on. Today, there are 
three times as many women’s collegiate lacrosse programs as there were in 
1990. In fact, the sport is so popular that colleges are having trouble finding 
enough qualified officials and coaches, especially outside the sport’s tradi-
tional East Coast hotbeds.
 
Some key differences do exist between the men’s and women’s game:
 
✓ Physical contact: The main difference between men’s and women’s 
lacrosse comes down to contact. In the men’s game, physical contact is 
legal — and encouraged (especially by coaches) — while in the women’s 
game, it is not. As a result, there is far less protective equipment in the 
women’s game: Men wear helmets, mouth guards, gloves, shoulder pads, 
elbow pads, and often ribs pads, whereas women wear mouth guards 
and protective eyewear, but (with the exception of goalies) no helmets 
or padding. (For more on lacrosse equipment, see Chapter 2.)
 
✓ Number of players: In the men’s game, ten players are on the field — 
three attackmen, three midfielders, three defensemen, and a goaltender. 
In the women’s game, there are 12 players on the field — offensive 
attack players (first home, second home, third home, and two attack 
wings) and the defense (center, two defensive wings, point, cover 
point, third man, and goalie). (Turn to Chapter 3 for more on all these 
positions.)
 
✓ Sticks: Unlike men’s lacrosse, mesh is not permitted for the pockets of 
women’s sticks; the pockets must be strung in the traditional way. Also, 
the top of the ball must be above the sidewall when it’s in the pocket.
 
✓ Field size: In men’s lacrosse, the field measures 110 yards long and 60 
yards wide. In women’s lacrosse, the field is a bit bigger: 120 yards long 
and 70 yards wide.
Lacrosse: A Player’s Game
Although you can get a ton of enjoyment from lacrosse by coaching or watch-
ing the sport, the most thrilling way to participate is by playing the game 
yourself. If you’re not shooting and scoring, you’re hustling for ground balls, 
checking the opposing stick handler, or making big saves. If you’re a lacrosse 
player, there’s never a dull moment.
Each position in lacrosse requires different skills — for example, attackmen need 
shooting ability, midfielders need speed, and defensemen need toughness — but 
every lacrosse player needs strong stick skills and good hand-eye coordination.

13
 Chapter 1: Lacrosse and You
 
Whether you’re an attackman or a long-stick midfielder, the main attribute you 
need to play lacrosse is not really a skill at all: You need to work hard and 
hustle all the time. So many good things in lacrosse — getting a ground ball, 
making a big check — are a direct byproduct of doing just that.
Playing offense: Stick skills and shooting
Good offensive skills start with the stick. You won’t be able to shoot the ball 
hard and with accuracy if you aren’t an adept stick handler. As we cover in 
Chapter 5, the best way to improve those skills is through practice.
 
We all like to work on things we’re already good at. In lacrosse, you need to do 
the opposite. If you’re dominant with one hand, you should strive to improve 
your other hand. Being able to pass, catch, and shoot with either hand is 
essential in beating your defender and, ultimately, the goalie.
Dodging is also crucial. Think of dodging like ball fakes in basketball. They’re 
moves that allow you to get past a defender, often including faking one way 
and going another. Dodges are crucial — especially for midfielders, who have 
more of the field to operate on offensively.
In Chapter 6, we offer some shooting drills and exercises you can use to take 
your skills up a notch. In addition, we examine the differences in shooting 
techniques from close range to the goal, as well as from the perimeter.
Defending: The do’s and don’ts
Hard hits and checks often garner the most attention, but effective defense 
includes many things that rarely — if ever — draw oohs and aahs from the 
crowd.
Specifically, we’re referring to assets such as communicating with your team-
mates, using good footwork, and playing with your head. Granted, these attri-
butes aren’t exactly glamorous, but they are the keys that make for a strong 
defender. We break down all this — and more— in Chapter 7.
In addition, we take a look at specific ways to defend offensive players — 
both when they have the ball and when they don’t. We also give you some 
drills that will help you develop your defensive agility, as well as other key 
defensive skills.

Part I: Getting Started 
The goalie’s goal: Keeping 
the ball out of the net
Keeping the ball out of the net is the goalie’s job — and it’s a tough one. In 
fact, there’s no position quite like the goalie on the field. After all, who else is 
willing to stand in the line of fire of shots coming directly at him — from all 
angles — often at speeds as high as 100 miles per hour? Yes, indeed, goaltenders 
are a breed apart.
In addition to needing mental strength, goaltenders need plenty of other attri-
butes to stop the ball from crossing the goal line. We examine the basics of 
goaltending — from proper stance to following the ball — in Chapter 8.
Possession is nine-tenths 
of the (lacrosse) law
Offense, defense, goaltending, specialty teams . . . these are all critical to win-
ning lacrosse. But the possession game is the most important of them all. 
Period. That’s because you can’t score if you don’t have the ball.
From faceoffs and ground balls to rides and clears, the possession game 
is complex. We take a look at all it in Chapter 9, starting with the faceoff. 
Lacrosse is one of the few sports where you can score and then get the ball 
right back again — that’s why faceoffs are so crucial.
Using specialty teams to your advantage
When one team has a player advantage for a period of time following a pen-
alty, that’s known as a man-up opportunity. Whenever this situation occurs, 
there are two specialty teams on the field — the man-up team (the offensive 
team that has the advantage) and the man-down team (the defensive team 
that is shorthanded).
 
In box lacrosse, man-up opportunities are known as power plays, the same 
term used in ice hockey.
In Chapter 11, we talk about what makes for effective players on specialty 
teams — both when you’re a man-up and when you’re a man-down. We also 
take a look at the best kind of shots to take when you have a player advan-
tage. Finally, we outline some especially effective man-up plays.

 Chapter 1: Lacrosse and You
Getting physical
Being the best lacrosse player you can be starts with being in the best pos-
sible physical condition, so that you’re in a position to succeed when game 
time comes. In Chapter 12, we pinpoint specific steps you can take to ensure 
that you’re at your best physically, including ways to improve quickness, 
agility, and strength, with some weight-training pointers as well.
Being the best player you can be also involves being mentally ready. In 
Chapter 12, we cover goal setting, relaxation, visualization, self-talk, focus, 
and getting energized.
Coaches’ Corner
When a team executes its game plan effectively, coaching looks easy. But the 
reality is, coaching is hard work — and if you’ve coached for more than a few 
minutes, you already know that.
The best way to get your team to succeed is to put it in position to do so. 
That means putting players at the right spots at the right times. It also means 
finding the right style of play to match your team’s strengths and weak-
nesses. (See Part III for more on the fundamentals of coaching lacrosse.)
You also need to develop your coaching style for both the offense and the 
defense. We tell you the most effective offensive and defensive schemes to 
employ in Chapters 14 and 15, respectively.
Your players have to be physically prepared before the start of each game, 
but they have to be just as prepared mentally. To help your players play 
intelligent lacrosse, scouting is critical at the higher levels of the sport — 
usually starting at the varsity level in high school and becoming more intense 
at the collegiate and professional levels. For example, is the opposing goalie 
stronger on high shots or low ones? Is the opposing team’s best attackman 
adept at shooting with his off hand? This kind of knowledge is vital. In fact, 
effective scouting can make the difference between a win and a loss. (We give 
you tips on scouting in Chapter 13.)
Another key part of coaching is making sure your players are ready to play. 
Are they confident? Are they motivated? Are they focused? These are just 
some of the questions you need to ask yourself before each and every game. 
(Turn to Chapter 13 for more on motivating your players to succeed.)

Part I: Getting Started 
From a Fan’s Perspective
If you’re a fan of lacrosse, you’re in good company: There are more lacrosse 
fans today than ever before, and that number is only growing.
In lacrosse, the action is constant, which means that you have to keep track 
of many different elements simultaneously — from offense and defense to 
specialty teams and goaltending. (We tell you specifically what to look for in 
Chapter 16.) There’s never a dull moment in a lacrosse game.
If you’re almost anywhere in North America these days, there should be a 
lacrosse game near you, whether at the youth, collegiate, pro, or recreational 
level. In Chapter 17, we take a look at the premier high school and collegiate 
programs playing the game today. We also cover tradition-rich minor-league 
box lacrosse in Canada, and we touch on the spread and growth of the inter-
national game. We tell you where — and when — you can follow the action, 
from the youth level to the pros.
Pro lacrosse now has both box and field versions. We tell you what you need 
to know about both those leagues in Chapter 18, as well as provide online 
sources for news and information.
So go out and catch the action! That’s especially good advice if you’re rela-
tively new to the game. There’s no substitute for watching as much lacrosse 
as possible to familiarize yourself with the rules and the unique aspects of 
the game. And you have plenty of opportunities to do just that: There are 
more outlets providing coverage of the game than ever before. Turn to the 
appendix for more on where you can watch some of the action on TV.

S
ome players are known for their exceptional stick skills or shooting abil-
ity. Others are recognized for their speed, aggression, quickness, or size. 
Lacrosse players have many different physical attributes, but they’re all out-
fitted the same. In this chapter, we take a look at the equipment you need to 
play the game, whether it’s field or box lacrosse, men’s or women’s, adult or 
youth. We also provide some pointers for parents on buying equipment.
The Tools of the Trade: 
The Ball and the Stick
When you get right down to it, you can enjoy a good lacrosse workout —
whether it be shooting off the wall by yourself or throwing and catching with 
a friend — with just two tools: a ball and a stick. In this section, we take at 
the two basic tools with which it all starts.

18
Part I: Getting Started 
The ball
In the early playing days of lacrosse, the ball had no standard size, although 
most were about the size of a tennis ball. Most lacrosse balls had an outside 
cover of rawhide or deerskin and were stuffed with deer hair. Or they were 
just plain round wood wrapped with rawhide. In 1867, Dr. George Beers, a 
Canadian dentist considered by many to be the “father of lacrosse” because 
he created the first set of rules, replaced the hair-stuffed deerskin ball with a 
hard rubber ball.
Today, this so-called Indian rubber ball is standard for all lacrosse play. The 
ball, which can be white, yellow, or orange, generally measures just less than 
8 inches in circumference and about 21⁄2 inches in diameter, and it weighs a 
little over 5 ounces.
 
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the governing body of 
U.S. collegiate sports, approved the use of a lime-green-colored ball, though 
you’re not likely to see it in wide use anytime soon. There’s no truth to the 
rumor that the NCAA is considering applying a lime dye to the lacrosse field 
grass to really spice up the game.
The stick
The stick first used by Native players was about 3 feet long with a circular net 
at one end, laced with thongs to hold the ball in place. This netted pocket at the 
end of the stick was very deep in order to carry the ball. The deep pocket of the 
stick made it difficult to throw the ball, though, so the early game had little 
passing — it was more a game of strength and endurance than a game of skill.
In the 1880s, the stick changed: Its handle (or shaft) was curved at the end, 
and a large, flat, triangular surface of webbing extended from the top down 
about two-thirds the length of the handle. The deep-pocket stick used by the 
Native players required less skill, but this new flat stick increased dodging 
and led to more passing, which sped up the game.
Today, men’s lacrosse players play with aluminum- or titanium-handled 
sticks with plastic heads. The stick, or the crosse, still has a net pocket at the 
end, but the depth is much shallower than it was in the game’s beginnings — 
about the diameter of one ball or slightly less.
 
Sticks in women’s lacrosse are usually made of wood, laminated wood, or syn-
thetic material.

19
 Chapter 2: Suiting Up: Buying the Right Equipment
In the following sections, we cover the various parts of the stick, and tell you 
what the rules say about sticks, as well as what to look for when you shop.
 
Try out a few sticks before you buy. As you play more, you’ll get a better idea 
of the kind of stick you like by playing with your own stick, as well as by trying 
out other players’ sticks.
Stick head
The stick head (see Figure 2-1) for all men’s field lacrosse players except the 
goalie must measure 61⁄2 to 10 inches wide. The goalie’s stick head must mea-
sure 10 to 12 inches wide.
 
Figure 2-1: 
The head is

the lacrosse

ball.
 
Pocket
Shooting strings
Throat
Head or tip
 
For all women’s field lacrosse players except the goalie, the stick head must mea-
sure 7 to 9 inches wide. The goalie’s stick head can be up to 12 inches wide.
The width of the pocket in a field lacrosse stick should be 61⁄2 to 10 inches. By 
rule, the pocket must be shallow enough to see a portion of the ball over the 
sidewall.
 
In box lacrosse, the width of the pocket should be 41⁄2 to 8 inches; for the goal-
tender in box lacrosse, the pocket can be no more than 15 inches wide.
 
The biggest difference between men’s and women’s field lacrosse sticks is in 
the pocket: In the women’s game, there is no mesh, except for on the goalie’s 
stick.

20
Part I: Getting Started 
Most lacrosse stick heads come flat when you buy them — that is, they have 
no pockets. You have to create (and then re-string) the pocket yourself. Try 
not to make your pocket right at the throat of the stick. You want it more 
toward the center of the mesh.
 
You may be able to ask your local sporting goods store to create the pocket 
for you before you take your new stick home.
 
Introduced in the mid-1990s, offset heads (with the head set back from the 
shaft) are tremendously popular with players of all levels in both forms of 
lacrosse. An offset head allows the pocket to be deeper while still releasing 
the ball with a high trajectory, enabling the shooter to increase the velocity 
of the shot while still adding torque to the cradle and making it harder for the 
ball to come out.
Stick length
Standard length for sticks in men’s field lacrosse is 40 to 42 inches from the 
end of the head to the end of the handle. Sticks for defensive players (as well 
as one midfielder) can measure 52 to 72 inches in length. The goalie’s stick 
can be 40 to 72 inches long.
 
In women’s lacrosse, the stick must be between 351⁄2 and 431⁄4 inches in length. 
The goalie’s stick must be between 351⁄2 and 48 inches in length.
 
In box lacrosse, the stick’s length should be between 42 and 46 inches. The 
goaltender’s stick has no minimum or maximum length.
Longer sticks are designed for defense. They make it harder for opposing 
offensive players to score, but they also limit field defensemen from getting 
involved offensively because of the decreased stick-handling ability that 
comes from carrying around 10 to 20 additional inches of stick.
 
Use a legal length that feels comfortable to you. If you’re choking up on the 
grip, the stick is too long for you. If you’re handling the stick properly, there’s 
no need to cut it off to make it shorter. If you cut your stick off short and 
you’re still growing, you may have to have to buy a new handle or another 
stick before another season begins.
 
Don’t cut your stick too short. Officials will check for legal stick length and 
may assess a minor penalty to a player with an illegal stick. In the 2002 World 
Lacrosse Championship, for example, a U.S. player received this penalty 
during the championship game against Canada.
Stick handle
Unlike hockey players, lacrosse players don’t use left-handed or right-handed 
sticks. Sticks are made neutral, which means that the middle of the tip of the 
head is lined up exactly in line with the handle.

21
 Chapter 2: Suiting Up: Buying the Right Equipment
From Head to Toe: Putting 
on the Equipment
With the advent and use of the plastic stick and aluminum handle, lacrosse has 
moved in a new direction. Players used to pad up along their arms to prevent 
any unnecessary injuries from wooden sticks. In today’s game, however, the 
philosophy about equipment seems to be “less is more.” Players are dressing 
light, with equipment that gives them more flexibility and less bulkiness.
 
Wearing the proper lacrosse attire (shown in Figure 2-2) is about more than 
just having the right look with the latest cool jersey. Equipping yourself for 
lacrosse is really more about making sure that you have all the accessories 
that will help keep you safe and healthy, as well as suiting yourself up to play 
the best possible lacrosse.

Other than the goaltender, women’s players don’t wear helmets (see Figure 2-3). 
But they must wear protective eyewear, mouth guards, and gloves. Some players 
also wear soft headgear and nose guards. (In addition to a helmet, face mask, 
mouth guard, and throat and chest protectors, the goalies may also wear pad-
ding on their shoulders, arms, hands, and legs.)

In field lacrosse, goalies use helmets, throat guards, chest protectors, and 
gloves.
 
Goalies in box lacrosse are much more protected, with all the same equipment 
as field goalies wear, plus shoulder pads, leg pads, and shin guards. In addi-
tion, unlike the field lacrosse chest protectors, the chest protectors of box 
lacrosse goalies include arm guards, because more shots are taken from close 
range to the goalie in box than in field.

23
 Chapter 2: Suiting Up: Buying the Right Equipment
Gloves
Lacrosse gloves are similar to hockey gloves, but they have a lot more flex-
ibility, which allows you to handle the stick properly.
 
If you’re a hockey player, and you’re just trying your hand at lacrosse, you can 
save a little money by using your hockey gloves. If you don’t play hockey, the 
differences between lacrosse and hockey gloves are big enough to warrant 
buying lacrosse gloves.
What do you look for in a lacrosse glove? Basically, you want a good fit. Some 
less expensive gloves have a little more nylon on the top; the more expensive 
ones have leather tops. Both styles give adequate protection, but leather 
tends to last longer. Manufacturers put mesh in the palms so that the gloves 
can breathe a lot more, last a lot longer, and give you a better feel of the 
handle.
 
Breathability is especially critical for box lacrosse played in hot arenas.
Shoulder pads, arm guards, 
and elbow pads
Most lacrosse shoulder pads are fairly skimpy, but that helps players move 
more freely. Besides, the biggest function of lacrosse shoulder pads is to hold 
your arm guards on so that your arms don’t get banged up. A three-piece pad 
comes all connected, with curved fiberglass to protect forearms, elbows, and 
biceps. With a properly fitted three-piece pad, you don’t need extra elbow 
pads.
Rib or kidney pads
The rib or kidney pad (it’s the same piece of equipment but it’s referred to 
by both names) is a one-piece unit that typically fits over the shoulders like 
suspenders and wraps around your stomach and lower and middle back for 
protection.
 
Rib or kidney pads are not mandatory to wear, but they are recommended. 
This is especially true for youth players, who tend to get hit in that area of the 
body more frequently.

24
Part I: Getting Started 
Helmets
In a sport as hard hitting and physical as lacrosse, head protection is vital. 
(Believe it or not, in the early days of lacrosse, men didn’t wear helmets at 
all.) The lacrosse helmet should fit properly and not move or flop around. 
Helmets are also equipped with a set of grills in the front. Some have face-
masks, though this is not nearly as common.
Mouth guards
The mouth guard not only protects your teeth from getting chipped and 
cracked but also helps prevent concussions by keeping your teeth from jam-
ming together.
 
You can get your dentist to make you a guard, or you can buy a premade 
one that’s a bit cheaper but will do the job effectively. The biggest difference 
between the two is that the dental mouth guard is built from a mold taken 
of your teeth, so it tends to stay on your teeth a little more comfortably and 
leads to less gagging.
Running shoes
Look for three-quarter-cut or high-top shoes rather than low-cut shoes. The 
higher-cut shoes are better at absorbing all the cutting and picking and roll-
ing of lacrosse. Also, keep your lacrosse shoes separate from your everyday 
shoes. Wearing your lacrosse shoes daily will break down the soles, causing 
you to slip and slide in a game.
Make sure your shoes are a good fit; shoes that are too big will cause blis-
ters. Some players wear two pairs of thick socks for absorption and protec-
tion of their feet. Others wear ankle socks for looks and comfort. Just make 
sure your socks are smooth when you put them on, because any wrinkle can 
cause blisters.
Supporting Your Kid’s Body
 
The single most important thing a youth player can wear is the kidney pad 
(see “Rib or kidney pads,” earlier in this chapter).

25
 Chapter 2: Suiting Up: Buying the Right Equipment
The equipment used for youngsters is the same as the big boys — and girls — 
use for both field and box lacrosse. However, youth lacrosse players use their 
own specially made sticks, sometimes known as junior sticks. Junior sticks have 
thin aluminum handles. These sticks are fine for smaller players (ages 4 to 8), 
but kids ages 9 to 12 have to start getting into full-size handles because they’re 
too strong for junior sticks. Between ages 9 and 12, they can still use aluminum, 
but most players use titanium, titanium alloy, or even wooden handles, which 
are the cheapest.
The rule for the length of the stick, from the end of the head to the end of the 
handle, is 36 inches or less for players up to 12 years of age in youth lacrosse.
 
Table 2-1 is a rundown of equipment kids need to play the game. Remember: 
Be sure to check with your local league for its unique requirements before 
making a purchase.

If you’re buying equipment for the first time, talk to parents of older players 
about equipment and the best places in your area to buy it.
 
If you’re coaching youth lacrosse, make sure that parents know what equip-
ment they need to provide before the first practice. You don’t want kids showing 
up to practice without mouth guards, for example, and having to watch from the 
sideline because their parents thought mouth guards would be provided.

Chapter 3
Meeting the Team
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the lacrosse positions
▶ Scoring on offense
▶ Dominating on defense
▶ Tending the goal
I
n this chapter, we introduce the players on the field and floor. In addition 
to breaking down each position, and talking about the number of players 
needed and what their responsibilities are, we also look at what it takes to 
be an effective player on offense and a dominating player on defense. This 
chapter covers the basics — giving you a leg up in understanding and playing 
lacrosse with success.
Introducing the Field Lacrosse Players
A men’s field lacrosse team includes nine players, plus the goaltender. A 
women’s team has 11 players, plus the goaltender.
Each field lacrosse team is allowed a maximum of six players (plus the goalie) 
on half the field at any one time. When a men’s field team is in its offensive 
zone, it must keep three players (plus the goalie) behind the midfield line. 
Of course, it’s not six on ten, because its opponent can only have six players 
(plus the goalie) defending the zone at the same time. This so-called split field 
in field lacrosse forces more specialization in playing positions.
 
In women’s field lacrosse, a maximum of seven players (plus the goalie) are 
allowed on half the field at any one time. When a women’s field team is in its 
offensive zone, it must keep three players (plus the goalie) behind its midfield 
line.

28
Part I: Getting Started 
The four main men’s field lacrosse positions are attackman, midfielder, 
defenseman, and goalie, though each position includes even more specific 
roles. Men’s teams employ three attackmen, three midfielders, and three 
defensemen.
 
The main women’s field lacrosse positions are attack and defense (which 
includes the goaltender). Here’s a look at the positions on the field:
A look at women’s field lacrosse
Women’s field lacrosse at the U.S. collegiate 
level is the fastest growing sector of the sport, 
aside from the overall growth in popularity of 
the sport, beginning with the youth level. In part, 
this growth is thanks to Title IX, a federal regula-
tion specifying that the athletic participation of 
every National Collegiate Athletic Association 
(NCAA) institution must mirror the gender ratio 
of its student body.
Major universities outside the Northeast, such 
as Florida, Northwestern, and Oregon, have 
established varsity women’s lacrosse programs 
over the past decade. Following this trend, 
youth programs and club teams have dramati-
cally expanded and advanced, introducing 
more young girls to the sport.
Although women’s lacrosse is similar to the 
men’s game in overall excitement and appear-
ance, the two games have some significant 
differences:
 ✓ With the exception of goalies, women do 
not wear padding or helmets, because body 
checking is not allowed.
 ✓ Women’s sticks can’t enter an imaginary 
7-inch bubble around any player’s head, 
and stick checks must be made away from 
the offensive player’s body. The result is 
that the women’s game places much more 
emphasis on defensive footwork and posi-
tioning than the men’s game does.
 ✓ Women’s stick shafts are narrower and the 
pockets are much shallower, which makes 
passing and catching vastly different from 
the men’s game. In the men’s games, 
passes are more frequent and unleashed 
at higher velocities.
 ✓ Women’s teams have 12 players on the field 
(including a goalie), as opposed to 10 for 
men.
 ✓ Field sizes are recommended to be 120 
yards long and 70 yards wide for women, 
which is 10 yards longer and 10 yards wider 
than it is for men.
 ✓ The offensive end of the field, which can 
hold only seven offensive players and 
seven defensive players (plus the goalie), is 
set off by a restraining line located 30 yards 
from the end line.
 ✓ Penalties for fouls are free position shots, 
taken from either an 8-meter arc around 
the goal (for a major penalty) or a 12-meter 
arc around the goal (for a minor penalty). 
Offending players must stand 4 meters 
behind (for a major foul) or to the side (for a 
minor foul), while the offensive player takes 
a free position shot.
 ✓ Faceoffs, which are called draws in the 
women’s game, begin with the ball pinched 
between the backs of the opposing players’ 
stick heads, which are held waist-high.

29
 Chapter 3: Meeting the Team
 
✓ Attack: The attack positions are made up of first, second, and third homes, 
all of whom are responsible, in differing degrees, for delivering goals. In 
addition, the two attack wings move the ball from defense to offense.
 
✓ Defense: The defensive assignments are broken down into the following 
areas: center, two defensive wings, point, cover point, third man, and 
goalie. The center handles draws. The wings are similar to midfielders 
in the men’s field games — with offensive and defensive responsibilities. 
The point covers the opposing team’s first home; the cover point, the 
opposing team’s second home; and the third man, the third home. The 
goaltender is the last line of defense.
This section introduces you to field participants and the roles they play. In 
addition, we take a look at offensive and defensive concepts that are appli-
cable to both the men’s and women’s games.
Putting the ball in the net: The attackmen
The attackmen are the primary offensive weapons looking to feed and score. 
They create most of the offense and generally don’t play defense. Attackmen 
are the three players kept on the opposite side of the midline while the ball is 
at the other end.
Attackmen often stay on the field the whole game. Many attackmen have the 
ability to both feed and score, but some of them focus on one of those offen-
sive elements and become specialists in that area.
Feeders
Feeders are the attackmen who set up scoring players. They’re obviously 
adept passers, but they also have outstanding field vision. Feeders often 
operate from the X position (the area behind the net).
Finishers
Finishers are the attackmen who deliver the goals. They generally have strong 
stick skills, quick releases, and hard, accurate shots. The trend in recent years 
is for finishers to have good strength and size — normally traits you would 
see in midfielders — so that defensemen have trouble moving them out of the 
crease area (the area just outside the crease, which surrounds the goal).
Playing offense and defense: 
The midfielders
Midfielders play offense and defense, following the flow of the game and get-
ting involved at both ends of the field. Midfielders, or “middies,” are crucial 
to a team’s transition offense and defense.

30
Part I: Getting Started 
Teams generally run three lines consisting of three midfielders each. For 
example, some midfielders may be defensive specialists, coming on the field 
only in certain situations, while others may play only faceoffs and then run 
off the field. However, many midfielders also run regular midfield shifts, and a 
select few are dangerous offensive weapons.
Although the three field players with longer sticks play defense, a fourth long 
stick can be used in the midfield. This player is known as a long-stick midfielder.
 
To be an effective two-way midfielder, you need size, speed, strength, stamina, 
and aggression. Midfielders must have it all in order to be effective both 
offensively and defensively. No position on the lacrosse field requires such a 
myriad of skills.
 
Midfielders must play both ends of the field. Doing that requires athleticism 
and endurance.
The first line of defense: Close defensemen
The three close defensemen generally stay on their half of the field while 
their team is on offense, though they are allowed to cross the midline in tran-
sition as long as an equal number of midfielders stays back.
The role of the defensemen is generally to stop the opposing attackmen from 
scoring or creating offense. Occasionally, a defenseman will be dispatched to 
cover a dominant opposing midfielder (as shown in Figure 3-1).
 
Here are some traits that are common among the best defensive players in the 
game:
 
✓ Communication: Communication is a critical component of the defen-
seman position. Because the ball moves frequently when the opposing 
team is on attack, defensemen must react accordingly — that means 
making quick slides and switches. In order to effectively executive these 
slides and switches, defensemen must communicate with their team-
mates frequently and effectively.
 
✓ Agility: Because offensive players make quick cuts and are effective 
dodgers, defenders must have the agility to stay with them.
 
✓ Footwork: Good technical defense starts with footwork. In fact, footwork 
is even more important than quickness — although being quick certainly 
helps.

Saving the day and keeping the 
ball in play: Goaltenders
Goalies in field lacrosse have to be more athletic than those in box lacrosse 
because of the larger goal: It’s 6 feet high and 6 feet wide in field lacrosse. 
Field lacrosse goalies play with their sticks held upright and the head of the 
stick pointing skyward, as shown in Figure 3-2.
 
In box lacrosse, goalies use the hockey style, where the stick is held on the 
ground.
In addition to stopping shots and getting the ball out of the defensive end, 
goalies are also responsible for directing the defense.

Goaltenders need the following attributes:
 
✓ Good reflexes: Shots on net come hard and fast, so if a goaltender 
doesn’t have good reflexes, it’s a problem. A big problem.
 
✓ Fearlessness: A field lacrosse goalie is protected by relatively little 
equipment — just a helmet, chest protector, throat guard, and gloves — 
and faces shots that routinely come in at over 90 miles per hour.
Introducing the Box Lacrosse Players
To make up a line (a group of five players who go on the floor together) you 
need two creasemen (right and left), two cornermen (also right and left), 
and a pointman. When transitioning from defense to offense, the pointman 
can come up either side of the floor or up the middle of the floor. And don’t 
forget the most important player on the team, the goaltender.

33
 Chapter 3: Meeting the Team
Hanging out with the goalie: 
The creasemen
The two creasemen are generally good goal scorers and usually play at the 
front of any fast break. A fast break is an offensive situation in which players 
move quickly up the floor from the defensive to the offensive end, often as a 
result of forcing a turnover on defense (such as stealing the ball) and usually 
with at least one more offensive player than defenders.
 
After they get into the offensive end, and the fast break or odd-man situation has 
been successfully defended, the creasemen have a number of offensive options:
 
✓ Cut to the ball. From their floor position, which is usually in the area 
around the crease of the goal area (from center left or right out to the 
sideboards), creasemen can move toward the stick handler in anticipa-
tion of a pass.
 
✓ Pop out in the crease area. By stepping out to receive a ball in the 
crease area of the floor, a creaseman can look for a one-on-one opportu-
nity against the goalie or against a defender to get to the goalie.
Which side of the floor do you play on?
At the youth level of box lacrosse, inexperi-
enced players sometimes play both sides of 
the floor, because they don’t know what they 
should do except run around, go after every 
loose ball (youth lacrosse has a lot of those), 
and try to hit anybody who moves.
But where players position themselves on the 
floor is important for both offensive and defen-
sive strategy. For example, the cross-check is 
a defensive maneuver to stop or slow down the 
stick handler; with the cross-check, players are 
getting hit on the side of the arm while carrying 
the ball.
If the stick handler goes down the wrong side of 
the floor — in other words, a left-shot creaseman 
goes down the left side of the floor — an incom-
ing cross-check would force him to turn his body 
away from the cross-check to protect the ball, 
thereby turning his back to the play.
But if that same stick handler goes down the 
proper side of the floor — in other words, a left-
shot creaseman goes down the right side of the 
floor — he can still turn sideways to protect 
the ball from an incoming cross-check, but he 
won’t be forced to turn completely away from 
the play. He can continue to face the play to see 
who’s open or to see the net.
Players need to know their position on the floor. 
They also need to be aware of the role they’ve 
been assigned to carry out in the position.

34
Part I: Getting Started 
 
✓ Set a pick. A creaseman can assist a teammate, either the stick handler 
or another offensive player, by setting a pick — that is, stepping in the 
path of his teammate’s defender. A pick may allow the stick handler to 
work away from his defender to get an open look to the goal for a shot, 
or it may allow an offensive teammate to work away from his defender to 
get open for a pass.
 
 In fact, the best creasemen are great at setting picks; the pick may often 
lead to a pass to the creaseman for a possible short shot on goal, an 
offensive set play known as the pick and roll.
Creasemen are very adept at going one-on-one against their defenders when 
close around the goal. They should also be good loose-ball players, because 
one of their primary roles is to go after every loose ball in the near-goal 
corner on a missed shot at the goal or on an errant pass to a teammate.
 
The critical qualities required in a good creaseman include stick skill, intelli-
gence, mobility, quickness, and vision of the floor.
On defense, creasemen are usually not the bigger (and better) defenders who 
would play against the better offensive players on the opposition, but they 
still should play good defense, usually defending the offensive players near-
est the centerline. This defensive positioning allows the creasemen to get a 
quick start on any fast-break opportunity.
Cutting corners: The cornermen
When transitioning from defense to offense, the two cornermen run up the 
floor behind the creasemen, often carrying the ball to try to create a fast-
break opportunity.
 
In an offensive set — that is, after a fast break or odd-man situation is over — 
cornermen have the following options:
 
✓ Shoot long. With their typical positioning around the center of the offen-
sive zone, cornermen look for most of their shots from long range.
 
✓ Look to go one-on-one. With the ball, a quick-footed cornerman can look 
for opportunities to take on his defender, trying to shake him free for 
either an open shot on goal or a pass to a teammate. Also, taking advan-
tage of a defender’s slip, cornermen can quickly move toward the goal 
and take on another defender one-on-one. More often than not, this situ-
ation leads to a quick pass to a creaseman or other cornerman, whose 
defender has moved to help out his beaten teammate.

35
 Chapter 3: Meeting the Team
 
✓ Look for a cutter. When carrying the ball, a cornerman faces the play, 
waiting for a teammate (usually a creaseman) to shake free a bit from his 
defender and cut toward the ball. A good pass from the cornerman to a 
cutter can then set up an open shot on goal.
 
✓ Wait for a pick. On a pick-and-roll play, the cornerman’s defender is 
usually the recipient of the pick. With his defender knocked off by his 
teammate’s pick, a cornerman can look to score or look to pass to the 
creaseman who set the pick.
On offense, the cornermen help create action by passing the ball, either 
across the floor or down into the crease area. This skill is especially critical 
when the defense is preventing a lot of player movement on the offensive end 
of the floor.
On defense, cornermen are usually the better defenders on a team, the play-
ers through whom the opposing offense must go.
Where does the winger play?
Many Canadian box lacrosse coaches also 
coach hockey and, of course, many young 
lacrosse players also play hockey. This over-
lap is natural — after all, hockey and box 
lacrosse are very similar — but it can cause 
some problems.
First, in hockey, a right winger is usually a right 
shot — a player who shoots from the right side 
of the body — who plays on the right side of 
the ice. But in lacrosse, the right-shot players 
play on the left side of the floor and are called 
left creasemen or left cornermen. And the right 
creasemen or right cornermen play on the right 
side of the floor, but are left-shot players. It all 
comes down to getting the best angle on the 
shot and protecting the stick with your body.
In addition, box lacrosse coaches who come 
out of hockey often call their offensive play-
ers wingers or centers — using these terms 
isn’t ideal (because they’re not accurate), but 
it isn’t a major problem. On the other hand, it 
is a problem when coaches call the backcourt 
players (or the last players to come up the floor 
on offense) defensemen. If you call these play-
ers defensemen, they may develop a tendency 
to stay out of the regular flow of the offense, as 
they would in hockey. Defensemen in hockey 
stay at the blue line and very seldom leave that 
area. If a lacrosse defender stays near the 
centerline without getting into the regular flow 
of the offense, the team ends up with three 
offensive players against five defenders.
To avoid this tendency, try thinking more like 
a basketball coach. When your team has the 
ball, every player is an offensive player, and 
when your team doesn’t have the ball, every 
player is a defensive player.

36
Part I: Getting Started 
Directing floor activity: The pointman
The pointman’s responsibilities are similar to the cornermen’s responsibili-
ties. He can move up the floor behind a cornerman or run up the middle of 
the floor.
 
The pointman needs all the qualities of a cornerman. He needs to be
 
✓ A good long-ball shooter: The pointman’s primary position in the offen-
sive zone is in the top area of the floor, closest to the centerline.
 
✓ Good at going one-on-one: If he can create some distance between him-
self and his defender, the pointman can more easily look to pass to a 
teammate closer to the goal.
 
✓ Smart with the ball: The pointman should develop the ability to read his 
own teammates’ energy level so that he can determine which side of the 
floor to pass to in order to create the best scoring opportunity.
The pointman’s biggest asset is his ability to make good plays — that is, to 
initiate the action on an offensive set play and still be a threat to score.
 
A pointman can be a bigger, slower player who isn’t usually a great scorer. A 
pointman should, however, make up for this lack of speed with a great sense 
of the action on the floor, the awareness to anticipate where the ball goes and 
when the ball doesn’t go where it’s supposed to, and the ability to get back 
quickly on defense.
Defending the net: The goaltender
The goaltender’s job is to stop the ball from going into the net. Sounds pretty 
simple, but it’s the hardest position to play. Goalies are the backbone of the 
team — a team won’t be successful without good goaltending. Goalies have 
to know how to play the angles, how to take away corner shots, and how to 
move around the crease area to get in good position to stop the ball.
But good goaltenders should be able to do more than just stop the ball; they 
also have to be able to initiate a fast break or breakout. A good goalie is a real 
threat if he can send a deep pass to a player breaking out down the floor or 
even an accurate short pass to a teammate to run the ball up the floor.
 
The better the goalie, the better the team.
Goalies tend to be a little different — as the saying goes, they walk to the 
beat of a different drummer — and that’s probably one of the reasons why so 
many of them are so good.

37
 Chapter 3: Meeting the Team
Defending the floor: The defensive players
All offensive players — creasemen, cornermen, and pointmen — are also 
defensive players. Lacrosse is similar to basketball in this sense — when the 
player or one of his teammates has the ball, they’re on offense, and when 
they don’t have the ball, they’re on defense.
 
In the National Lacrosse League, most positions are now specialized. Offensive 
players play strictly on offense, and defensive players play defense.
Unlike on offense, defensive players have no set positions. Usually, a line 
sent out to the floor includes two or three players whose strength is playing 
defense rather than scoring. These players pick up the better offensive play-
ers on the opposing team to defend. The players on a line whose skills are 
primarily offensive usually end up defending the weaker offensive opponents 
when on defense.
 
Having several players on a line who can play both offense and defense well 
is usually a luxury. But many lacrosse teams today tend to go with a so-called 
offense-defense system, which allows players who excel on one end of the floor 
or the other to run on and off the floor, depending on which team has posses-
sion of the ball. A solid defender, for example, is on the floor to play defense 
when his team doesn’t have the ball. When his team takes possession, he 
heads for his team’s bench to be replaced by a more offensive-minded player.
Carrying the Offense: Keys 
for the Offensive Player
The ability to handle the ball — that is to pass, catch, cradle, and shoot with 
great skill — gives you and your team a tremendous advantage in a lacrosse 
game. But you also need to use certain offensive skills when you aren’t carry-
ing the ball.
On offense, you have to be able to beat a defender, whether you’re with the 
ball or without the ball. And you should never take your eyes off the ball — 
you have to know where the ball is at all times.
This section offers the basics that you need to be successful on the offensive 
end of the field or floor.

38
Part I: Getting Started 
Practicing efficient stick handling
Stick handling (also called ball handling) isn’t really true handling — you 
don’t use your hand at all. Instead, efficient stick handling requires great skill 
with handling the lacrosse stick. And the best stick handlers can work won-
ders with the ball and stick, whether catching, cradling, passing, or scoring.
 
To become a great stick handler — or at least to master the fundamentals of 
stick handling — you have to practice. Walk to school while cradling a ball, 
spend Saturday mornings in the off season throwing and catching off an out-
door wall (preferably one without windows), or set up a goal-shaped target to 
practice shooting against.
Take the time to become comfortable with the basics of each of the stick-
handling skills in the following sections.
Catching
Your best chance for catching a pass in your direction is to make sure that 
you’re facing the passer and you can see the path that the ball is taking 
toward your stick. After the ball reaches your stick, drop the stick back 
slightly as the ball hits the pocket to minimize the risk of the ball popping 
back out.
 
Make sure that you’re facing the direction that the pass is coming from, and 
allow your stick to give a little as it receives the ball. If you follow these two 
tips, you should have little trouble with any pass sent your way.
Cradling
Efficiency at cradling (holding the ball in your stick’s pocket while you decide 
whether to shoot or pass) allows you to scan your options on the playing 
surface without having to look constantly at your stick to make sure you still 
have the ball. You can use different styles of cradling depending on the game 
situation. For example, if you’re being tightly defended, you should cradle 
with both hands, and the stick should be positioned closer to your body so 
it’s more difficult for the defender to strip the ball away from you.
 
Your goal is to
 
✓ Protect the ball from a defender.
 
✓ Hold onto the ball while you watch for a teammate to cut for a pass or 
for an opening for a shot on goal.
 
✓ Always be ready to release the ball.

39
 Chapter 3: Meeting the Team
Passing
Just as you need to be in the proper position to catch a pass, positioning is 
critical for making a pass. However, facing the receiver directly is not usually 
the best bet. Instead, you want to have a slightly sideways stance because 
you’re also likely to be keeping the ball away from a defender at the same 
time that you’re passing it. Also, make sure that you’ve made eye contact 
with the receiver before you send a crisp, two-handed pass her way.
Shooting
Shooting is just like passing, except to a smaller target that doesn’t move but 
has a large, padded object in the way trying to “catch” your pass. The four 
most effective shot styles to work on are the overhand long shot, the under-
hand long shot, the sidearm long shot, and the backhand shot that’s usually 
from close in.
Moving — with and without the ball
Lacrosse is a game of constant movement. If you have the ball, you’re work-
ing around the offensive zone trying to find an open teammate or trying to 
find an opening through which you can take a shot. If you don’t have the ball, 
you’re moving and running and picking and shifting and trying to shake free 
an opponent so that you can be in position to take a pass or pick up a ground 
ball.
Moving with the ball takes a combination of quickness, anticipation, and 
vision. Quick, darting moves may help you get past a defender so that you 
can break for the goal or pass to an open teammate. Anticipating when and 
from where a check is coming may create yet another opening for a scoring 
opportunity.
 
Keep your eyes on the activity in the rest of the offensive zone while also 
looking out for defenders — this takes particularly sharp concentration while 
you’re also moving around the playing surface. (Some of the best playmakers 
in the game — or in any game, for that matter — do seem to have eyes in the 
backs of their heads.)
Moving without the ball helps you beat a defender and get open for a pass. 
The most basic play and most effective move without the ball is just to speed 
past your defender on the off-ball side. You can use quickness and deception, 
you can slash at your defender’s stick to knock it down and go, or you can 
just check your defender and push off.

40
Part I: Getting Started 
Knowing where the ball is at all times
Field vision — the ability to see what’s happening on the playing surface at all 
times — is a tremendous asset to successful lacrosse. The best players can 
see what their teammates are doing, anticipate where their teammates are 
going, know where the defensive players are and what they’re likely to do, 
and still be able to keep an eye on where the ball is in the zone.
 
You need some time and practice to be able to have the kind of field vision 
that the best players have, so for now, work on making sure you know where 
the ball is. If you know which of your teammates has the ball, you can then 
quickly look around the field for an opening, for an opportunity to set a pick, 
or to anticipate a shot on goal and a possible ground ball.
Focusing on Defense: Keys 
for the Defensive Player
Half the battle of playing defense is good position. Of course, you need to 
know how to stop an opponent with the ball and without the ball, but good 
position saves you a lot of unnecessary work. How you use your stick on 
defense is also important, whether you use it as a slash, poke-check, or 
check. And sometimes you have to use your body to compensate for making 
wrong decisions.
This section offers the basics that you need to gain success on the defensive end.
Establishing your position
Defensive positioning is a matter of how you play your opponent in relation to 
the rest of the defensive zone. Depending on game situations, you may choose 
to defend an offensive player by forcing him toward the sidelines or by trying 
to get him to go higher up in the zone. Making the correct decision — knowing 
where on the field you’ll be in the right place at the right time defensively — is 
half the battle of playing solid defense.
Positioning also requires some understanding of how your teammates 
defend. By keeping yourself in a positive defensive position — such as 
between your opponent and the goal or between your opponent and the 
middle of the zone — you can be in a more ideal position to help out a team-
mate who has been beaten or to double-team a cutting offensive player.

41
 Chapter 3: Meeting the Team
Using (or not using) the stick
Stick-checking is more of an integral part of playing defense in field lacrosse 
than it is in box lacrosse. In the field game, where sticks can be up to 72 
inches long, stick checks make up roughly 85 percent of the defensive tactics.
Footwork is crucial for a stick check in order to keep yourself in good posi-
tion to make a check or use the body. Stick checks are effective in causing 
turnovers — deflecting passes or shots, stripping the ball from the oppo-
nent’s crosse, and forcing a player into throwing an errant pass or shot. If an 
offensive player loses the ball, a defensive player’s stick check likely caused 
it. Field defenders use physical pressure with the body to keep an offensive 
player from dodging and putting herself in a good spot to shoot or pass.
 
In box lacrosse, stick checking is a legal defensive tactic. At one time, the 
thinking was that you should use your stick on defense only as an emergency 
measure or as an accessory to a cross-check. In the National Lacrosse League 
today, however, stick-checking on the stick handler’s gloves is one of the main 
tactics for stopping a stick handler. But this tactic remains illegal in minor 
lacrosse.
When you try to stick-check a player, you’re trying to stop the momentum of 
a usually running, often rather large, opponent with a piece of aluminum or 
wood. It’s a bit like trying to block a 300-pound defensive lineman in football 
with a 170-pound place kicker.
 
What you should be stopping your opponent’s momentum with is your body 
and a legal cross-check. In this better scenario, you hold the stick with both 
hands across your body as additional leverage for the check. In this position, 
you’re also keeping your hands on the stick so that you can quickly move to 
pick up a loose ball or intercept a pass.
Defending the Goal: Keys 
for the Goaltender
Goaltender is a unique position on the field. After all, in men’s lacrosse, at 
any given time, there are three attackmen, three midfielders, and three defen-
semen . . . but only one goaltender. As a result, most of what you need to 
know about this position is unique from all others. Here’s a look at few of the 
most important traits you can have as a goalie.

42
Part I: Getting Started 
Taking your optimum goal position
The so-called ready stance is a balanced and relaxed position in the crease, 
ready to react forward, backward, or sideways, depending on the location 
of the ball. With your knees bent, your back straight, and your positioning 
square to the ball, this body positioning in front of the goal puts you in the 
best shape to take on any and all comers.
Building up your save repertoire
Field goalies have to defend a larger net than box goalies do. About 90 per-
cent of a field goalie’s saves are stick saves. Generally, field goalies use their 
bodies to save only when the ball gets by the stick and hits them in the chest.
Lacrosse goaltending comes down to two basic styles of saves:
 
✓ Reflex saves: Reflex saves are the kind of saves that you make as a 
response to a shot — for example, a save that kicks away a low-flying 
shot, a body save that deflects a high shot, or a stick save that knocks 
away a bounce shot.
 
✓ Angle saves: Angle saves are about positioning your body in the goal 
in anticipation of a shot. With good body positioning, you’re effectively 
reducing the number of potential angles that an offensive player has for 
a shot.
Starting the offense
Possibly the most underappreciated skill that a lacrosse goalie can have is 
her ability to jump-start the offense with a well-timed and perfectly executed 
outlet pass. After stopping a shot, a goalie’s quick-release pass to a teammate 
streaking toward the offensive zone can lead to a fast-break, two-on-one (or 
three-on-two) scoring opportunity.
 
Passing quickly and accurately is a highly specialized skill, especially with the 
bulky equipment that goalies wear today. Use your team’s practice time to 
work on your passing. It’s a good exercise when your coach has the rest of the 
team running drills at the other end of the field or floor.

Laying Down the (Lacrosse) Law
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing the playing field (or box)
▶ Following how the game is played
▶ Understanding the game’s officials
▶ Playing by the rules
A
s with any team or individual sport, lacrosse is played by a set of rules. 
Rules are there for a reason: They help dictate the flow of the game so 
that all players start on the same level playing field, so to speak. Rules also 
help the game’s fans understand what’s happening on that level playing field.
Of course, the primary objective of the game is to score more goals than the 
other team. And you do this by getting the ball past the other team’s goalie 
and into the netting of the goal.
Whether you’re curious about the slashing penalty or just need to know how 
long the playing field is, this chapter gives you the basic lacrosse rules and 
regulations.
Field of Dreams: Playing Field Lacrosse
Field lacrosse is played primarily outdoors (though it can be played indoors 
on artificial turf) on a large playing surface. Men’s teams have ten players 
per team — three attackmen, three midfielders, three defensemen, and the 
goalie.
 
Women’s field lacrosse teams have 12 players — 5 attackers, 6 defenders, and 
the goalie.

44
Part I: Getting Started 
Men’s lacrosse games are played in quarters lasting 15 minutes for college 
(for a total of 60 minutes for the game), 12 minutes in most high schools (for 
a total of 48 minutes), and 8 minutes for most youth leagues (for a total of 32 
minutes).
 
Women’s lacrosse is played in two 30-minute halves at the collegiate level 
(for a total of 60 minutes for the game) and two 25-minute halves at the high 
school level (for a total of 50 minutes).
Examining the field
Field lacrosse traverses a large space, which produces a wide-open game 
with specialized positions and an emphasis on team coordination on offense 
and defense.
The men’s game is played on fields measuring 110 yards long and 60 yards 
wide.
 
The women’s game is played on a field measuring 120 yards long and 70 yards 
wide.
Fields are divided by a midline and two restraining lines 35 yards from the 
end lines; the restraining lines signify the offensive and defensive zones sur-
rounding each goal. A field’s midline serves as the off-sides line. When the 
ball is in one end, seven defensive players (including a goalie) and six offen-
sive players are allowed between the end line and midline.
 
In the women’s game, a defender cannot remain in the arc (the 8-meter semi-
circular area in front of the goal in which major fouls are called) for over 3 
seconds unless she’s within a stick’s length of the offensive player.
Figure 4-1 shows the field lacrosse layout.
Out of bounds is called as it is in soccer or basketball on all plays except 
shots. If a player throws an errant pass at midfield over the sideline, the pos-
session is awarded to the other team. But if he unleashes a shot over the 
goal, whichever team has a player closest to where the ball crossed out of 
bounds gets possession. When a player takes a shot that clearly misses the 
goal, everyone generally sprints to the end line trying to gain or maintain 
possession.
Field lacrosse goals measure 6 feet wide by 6 feet high, and the crease is a 
full-circle 9-yard radius surrounding the goal area. Offensive players are not 
allowed inside the crease. Goals are waived off and/or possession is given to 
the defense if an offensive player steps inside the crease.

The crease violation is a controversial call among some field lacrosse fans. 
The dive (trying for a closer shot by entering the crease by air — that is, not 
stepping in the crease area) was taken out of the NCAA game before the 1999 
season in an effort to protect goalies from offensive players leaping into the 
crease. Although he didn’t perform the straight-on dive that the NCAA was 
worried about, Syracuse’s Gary Gait made an unforgettable move by jump-
ing from outside the crease behind the goal and dunking a shot around front 
against Penn in the 1988 national semifinal game. He pulled the move, later 
coined the “Air Gait,” twice in the 11-10 win.
Keeping the field game moving
Youth, high school, and college field lacrosse games — for both men and 
women — have no shot clock for the offense. The men’s game does have 
some rules to help the game keep up its fast-moving pace:
 
✓ Defensive clear-out: Defensive players have 20 seconds to clear the ball 
past the defensive area line, or a technical foul is called and possession 
is given to the opposing team.
 
✓ Five-second count: If any sort of stalling occurs between the defen-
sive area line and midline, officials will give the player with the ball a 
5-second count, during which he must cross midfield or advance within 
5 yards of an opponent.

46
Part I: Getting Started 
 
✓ Ten-second count: When they’ve moved over the midline, teams have 
10 seconds to advance the ball into the attack area. If the offensive 
team moves the ball out of the attack area after it has entered, a new 
10-second count is started.
The summertime professional outdoor lacrosse league, Major League 
Lacrosse, has a 60-second (formerly a 45-second) shot clock. Coaches and 
officials have talked about experimenting with a shot clock in the college 
game. Without a shot clock, officials can keep teams from stalling by issuing 
a “keep it in” warning if the teams are obviously holding the ball from play 
in the attack area and not advancing toward the goal. In the last 2 minutes of 
games, the team with the lead must keep the ball in after it enters the attack 
area.
Faceoffs begin each quarter and follow each goal. Two players meet at the 
faceoff, with each team stationing a player on each wing (20-yard lines paral-
lel to the sidelines placed 20 yards from the center circle). When the whistle 
blows, the wing players can converge on the ball, but no other players can 
cross over the restraining lines and into the middle of play until possession is 
gained by one team or the other.
 
Draws are the women’s version of faceoffs. The ball is drawn upward after it’s 
put between the sticks of two standing players.
Substituting players
Attackmen and defensemen are substituted less frequently than midfielders, 
who generally come on and off in three-man lines. (See Chapter 3 for details 
about the roles of field lacrosse players.) Some teams have specialty defense 
units, but the first defensive line generally sees the most action. Faceoff spe-
cialists and wing players often run directly off the field as soon as their team 
gains possession.
A 10-yard special substitution box straddles the midline and serves as the 
exclusive entrance and exit for all players to the field — no limit is placed on 
the number of substitutes a team can make.
Unraveling penalties and physical play
Penalties generally last 30 seconds or a minute, though some penalties last 
up to 3 minutes, depending on the severity of the violation. (For example, a 
penalty for using an illegal stick is three minutes.) After the team with the 
player advantage scores, the offending player is released from the penalty 
box, unless the foul was non-releasable, in which case the penalty is carried 

47
 Chapter 4: Laying Down the (Lacrosse) Law
out for the duration, regardless of scoring. Only harsher penalties earn non-
releasable calls.
If the team without the ball commits a technical foul, it has to play without a 
man for 30 seconds. Technical fouls committed by teams with the ball simply 
give possession to the opponent.
 
In women’s lacrosse, minor and major penalties do not result in extra-player 
advantages. Instead, the team that receives the benefit of the ball, gets what 
is called a free position shot, which is similar to a foul shot in basketball. For 
major fouls, the player called for the foul must stand 4 yards behind the offen-
sive player. For minor fouls, the player is placed 4 yards off and in the direc-
tion she was approaching the offensive player at the time of the foul.
Because man-up opportunities often last just 30 seconds, one errant pass or 
ill-advised shot can squander the advantage very quickly. The best NCAA 
man-up units generally achieve a 50 percent success rate, while the success 
rate for the best man-down units hovers in the mid-80s.
Any player accumulating five personal penalties is ejected from the game, 
though this is an extremely rare occurrence, and the player’s team does not 
have to play short-handed after the expulsion. Fighting is almost nonexistent 
in field lacrosse, thanks in part to stiff penalties. Occasional heat-of-the-
moment skirmishes break out during games, but actual one-on-one, gloves-off 
fisticuffs do not happen in field lacrosse. In the NCAA and at the high school 
level, fighting results in an automatic ejection, a three-minute non-releasable 
penalty, and suspension from the next game.
If a goalie commits a penalty, he must serve the time and is replaced with a 
backup. (For more information, see the nearby “Penalties and goalies” 
sidebar.)
A field lacrosse player can’t cross-check (using the portion of the stick 
between his hands to check his opponent). Cross-checking is a personal foul, 
earning between one and three minutes of penalty time. In field lacrosse, no 
check is legal on a player without the ball. Players are allowed to push and 
use sticks to hold opponents’ sticks, as long as they’re within 5 yards of a 
loose ball.
 
Contact to the body — either with one’s own body or with a stick — is not per-
mitted in women’s lacrosse, marking the biggest difference between it and the 
men’s game. A defensive player marks an opponent by being within a stick’s 
length of the offensive player.
Lacrosse sticks, or crosses, must conform to regulations. One stick is checked 
at random after each quarter in field lacrosse. Coaches can specifically 
request that an opposing player’s stick be checked. Violation carries a three-
minute non-releasable penalty.

Box of Dreams? Inside the Boards 
in a Lacrosse Arena
You’ve entered an arena to watch a box lacrosse game. That in and of itself 
results in a different lacrosse experience for most field lacrosse players and 
fans, who may have never had the experience of watching a game indoors. As 
soon as you look at the floor, you notice different markings than you’d find 
on the ice for hockey or on a basketball court, sports that are also played in 
an arena. You’ll probably also notice that the playing surface is artificial turf 
rather than cement, wood, or ice.
 
Although artificial turf is easier to run and fall on than cement, wood, or ice, 
it’s not as easy on the legs as an outdoor grass field is.
The box lacrosse playing area must have boards around the sides and the 
ends of the playing surface with a minimum height of 3 feet. The fact that the 
playing area is surrounded by boards — making it “lacrosse with walls” — is 
another major difference from the field game.
Arenas vary in size, so playing surfaces are not always uniform in size, which 
also differs from field lacrosse. However, most box lacrosse playing surfaces 
Penalties and goalies
It’s not open season on the goalie, as long as 
he remains in the crease area. When a goalie 
is outside the crease, an opponent may chase 
or stick-check him. If the player tries to check 
the goalie too hard or take him out of the play, 
a penalty may be assessed. Goalies are aware 
of this rule and sometimes trick opponents 
into committing stupid penalties. Also, when a 
goalie has been taken out on a check illegally, 
it can lead to payback and additional penalties, 
because most teams stick up for their goalies.
When in the crease, goalies are not to be inter-
fered with at all. Anything from a ball-possession 
violation to a major penalty may be assessed for 
messing with the goalie in the crease.
Goalies may be assessed penalties, particularly 
when they step outside the crease. When a 
goalie hits or illegally picks on a player outside 
the crease, he may be called for a major pen-
alty. (All those pads to protect the goalie from 
flying balls can be painful to the unsuspecting 
opponent.)
In field lacrosse, the goalie serves the penalty 
(with the team getting a minute to warm up the 
backup goalie), except in some youth leagues in 
which a designated player (called an in-home) 
does the time. Goalie penalties in box lacrosse 
are served by a teammate who is on the floor at 
the time of the infraction.

49
 Chapter 4: Laying Down the (Lacrosse) Law
are 180 to 200 feet long and 80 to 90 feet wide, and the features inside those 
playing surfaces are the same (see Figure 4-2):
 
✓ Restraining lines: The two lines that run across the width of the floor 
(from the team benches to the penalty boxes) have several functions:
 
• They restrain players. The eight players who are not involved in 
competing for the faceoff must line up behind the restraining lines 
until the ball comes out of the faceoff circle, at which time they can 
pursue a loose ball or defend the stick handler.
 
• They serve as the 10-second threshold. When a team takes posses-
sion in its own zone, it has 10 seconds to move the ball over the 
opposite restraining line. If 10 seconds pass before the ball crosses 
that line, the team forfeits possession.
 
• They serve as the over-and-back line. After the team on offense has 
crossed over the opposite restraining line, it can’t allow the ball to 
go back over that line (toward the center faceoff circle) or it risks 
losing possession of the ball.
 
✓ Change area: The rectangular boxes that run parallel to the team 
benches are there for shifting players in and out of the game, similar to 
ice hockey. A player coming off the floor must have his foot in the box 
before the player replacing him can come on the floor. If an offensive 
player comes on the floor too early, the offensive team loses possession 
of the ball. If a defensive player goes onto the floor too early, the defen-
sive team faces a two-minute penalty. These rules are similar to field 
lacrosse, except, of course, for the presence of the box in front of the 
bench, which in field lacrosse is the sideline.
 
✓ Crease: This semicircular marking around the goal is 9 feet in diameter 
and serves to protect the goalie. In field lacrosse, the crease is 18 feet in 
diameter. If an opposing offensive player enters the crease, the offense 
loses possession of the ball. If an opposing offensive player is stepping 
on the line of the crease or is in the crease and scores, the goal is disal-
lowed. But if the ball goes into the net before he steps into the crease, 
the goal stands. These rules are the same in field lacrosse.
 
✓ Nets: Box lacrosse nets are smaller than field nets. Box nets are 4 feet 
wide and 4 feet high.
The playing surface isn’t the only difference between box and field lacrosse. 
Pro, major, and junior box lacrosse games consist of three 20-minute periods 
(similar to hockey) for a total of 60 minutes, while some youth box games can 
be as short as 32 minutes.

Understanding the Game’s Participants 
and Their Roles
A lacrosse game is a match of skill and wits with three primary groups of 
participants: the players, their coaches, and the game officials. This sec-
tion offers a brief rundown of what each group of participants does during a 
game. For more detailed information about some of these gamers, check out 
Part II of this book for players and Part III for coaches.
Introducing tonight’s players
With more and more skilled athletes playing lacrosse, the game has become 
more specialized, with players assigned specific roles to match their physi-
cal or mental attributes. But, to some degree, every player must be versatile, 
because in lacrosse, you can go from playing offense to defense and back to 
offense in a split second.

51
 Chapter 4: Laying Down the (Lacrosse) Law
The attack players are expected to provide the team with the majority of its 
scoring. The defensive players, including the goaltender, are expected to 
prevent the other team from scoring. Midfielders are expected to do it all — 
including the most amount of running.
Each men’s field lacrosse team has 10 players on the field at any given time; 
for women’s teams, it’s 12 players.
Cheers to Beers: The first set of lacrosse rules
The first sign of lacrosse turning into a more 
organized game came in 1867, when Dr. George 
Beers, a Montreal dentist, presented a code 
of rules to a lacrosse convention in Kingston, 
Ontario. The rules adopted became the basis 
of the game that developed over the ensuing 
years, first for field lacrosse and later for box 
lacrosse:
 ✓ The object of the game was to send the ball, 
by means of the lacrosse stick, through the 
enemy’s goalposts.
 ✓ The game was opened by the act of “facing 
off,” in which two centers held their 
lacrosse sticks on the ground and the ball 
was placed between them.
 ✓ The major rule was that the ball could not 
be touched with the hands except by the 
goaltender. The goaltender could only 
block the ball with his hand; he couldn’t 
throw it with his hand.
 ✓ The field was a minimum of 150 yards long.
 ✓ A goal umpire represented each team.
 ✓ Teams had 12 men on each side with no 
substitution except for injury.
 ✓ The positions were goal, point, cover point, 
center, third attack, second attack, first 
attack, out home, and in home.
 ✓ The hair-stuffed deerskin ball was replaced 
with a hard rubber ball.
 ✓ A new stick was introduced, with a shaft 
ending in a sort of crook and a large, flat, 
triangular surface of webbing extending as 
much as two-thirds the length of the stick. 
Because this new stick was large and flat 
and there was no pocket — unlike the short, 
narrow, bagged stick used by the Native 
Americans — the game became more of 
a catching-and-throwing game than a run-
ning-and-dodging game. The new lacrosse 
stick was held with two hands; players 
retained the ball in the pocket using a con-
tinuous rocking motion.
 ✓ Fouls included spearing, tripping, holding, 
slashing with the stick, throwing the stick, 
stopping the ball with the hands (the goal-
tender was exempt from this rule), and gen-
eral rough play. Fouls were penalized either 
by suspension of the offender until a goal 
was scored or until the end of the game.
 ✓ No one could interfere with a player who 
wasn’t in possession of the ball.
 ✓ The goals were 6-foot-tall poles placed 
6-feet apart.
 ✓ The first side to score three goals won the 
match.
Because of his efforts in promoting and orga-
nizing lacrosse, Dr. George Beers is known as 
the “father of lacrosse.”

Part I: Getting Started 
 
Unless a player (or two) is in the penalty box, each box lacrosse team has six 
players on the floor at any one time, including the goalie, a pointman, two 
creasemen, and two cornermen.
Because most players these days have either offensive or defensive special-
ties, you’ll see a lot of line changes (running to and from the benches as 
players exchange positions, depending on who has possession of the ball). 
If a team gains control of the ball, some players run the ball up the field and 
others run to the bench so that the better offensive players can get on the 
field to score. If a team loses possession of the ball, some players run back 
on defense and others run to the bench to get the better defensive players 
on the field to stop the opposition from scoring. Some players can play both 
ways — offense and defense — which makes them very valuable.
Leading the team: The coach’s role
The coach’s primary role during a game is to change the lines and put out 
special checking assignments against the opposition’s best offensive player. 
When a penalty has been called, the coach calls for either the man-up 
offense, when the opposing team is penalized, or the man-down defense, if 
his team receives the penalty.
Most teams have three coaches:
 
✓ Head coach: The head coach oversees the whole operation of the game. 
The head coach also makes sure that the bench is organized and makes 
all final decisions on who should play at what time in the game.
 
✓ Offensive coach: The offensive coach changes the offensive players and 
gives feedback to the offensive players to make them better.
 
✓ Defensive coach: The defensive coach changes the defensive players and 
gives feedback to the defensive players to make them better. The defen-
sive coach also makes sure that the players pick up the correct checking 
assignment (which tells each player which opposing player to defend).
Officials: The men in black
In a lacrosse game, a minimum of two — and sometimes as many as four — 
officials are assigned to work each game. The official’s job is to make sure 
that the rules of the game are enforced. Officials try to assure that the game 
is run smoothly and is played on as close to an even level as possible. If the 
players try to take advantage of the rules by doing something illegal, the offi-
cial will call a penalty on the offender.

53
 Chapter 4: Laying Down the (Lacrosse) Law
In addition to monitoring the play of the game, officials are responsible for 
ensuring that players are using the proper equipment, including the appro-
priate game wear, such as helmets and pads, that help prevent injuries, and 
the proper game equipment, such as the lacrosse stick.
For more on officials and the role they play, turn to “Officiating Lacrosse,” 
later in this chapter.
Starting and Stopping Play 
and Everything in Between
The basic elements of the game are pretty much the same no matter who’s 
playing. To determine possession at the start of each quarter and after every 
goal, a faceoff occurs. Play is stopped when a goal is scored, when a penalty 
is called, and when the ball goes out of bounds.
 
The women’s lacrosse version of the faceoff is called a draw. Here, the ball is 
positioned between the opposing players’ sticks, which are held horizontally 
at the center of the field.
Just about every other event that starts or stops play of the game involves 
ball possession (see Chapter 9). You gain possession from chasing down 
loose balls and ground balls, from winning faceoffs, from intercepting bad 
passes, and from recovering shots at the net.
Why all the scoring?
In 1954, the National Basketball Association 
(NBA) instituted a 24-second clock — each 
team had 24 seconds during an offensive pos-
session to attempt a shot or turn the ball over. 
In its first year of use, the 24-second clock 
increased scoring in NBA games by more than 
17 percent. NBA teams averaged more than 13 
points per game over the previous season.
Many levels of lacrosse also play with a shot 
clock. In Major League Lacrosse (MLL), the shot 
clock is 60 seconds. In the National Lacrosse 
League (NLL), a 30-second shot clock begins 
when a team gets possession of the ball. The 
offensive team must get a shot on net during 
that time, or it loses possession of the ball. If the 
offensive team shoots the ball at the goal and 
doesn’t score, it can recover the rebound or 
loose ball, after which the clock starts all over 
again. You can get off a lot of shots 30 seconds 
or 60 seconds at a time. 

54
Part I: Getting Started 
You can also lose possession of the ball, turning the ball over to your oppo-
nent when they may or may not have earned it. You can give up possession 
by taking more than 10 seconds to get the ball into the offensive zone, by set-
ting illegal moving picks, by doing an illegal draw on the faceoff (for example, 
having a foot inside the small circle), by touching the ball in play with your 
hand, and by having too many offensive players on the field.
Officiating Lacrosse
If you ask the question, “Who would want to be an official in any sport?” the 
likely answer would be, “Not too many.” Officials are constantly plagued by 
that question, especially with all the verbal abuse from players, coaches, 
managers, and, of course, fans. Many fans take officials for granted. Others 
believe that officials are there to be abused and are convenient to blame 
when a game is lost. Well, the truth is, without fans, the game wouldn’t be the 
same; but the game needs officials to interpret its rules fairly and accurately 
for both teams so that fans can get the most enjoyment out of the sport.
 
In field lacrosse, game officials are referred to as just that — “officials.” 
They’re known as “umpires” in the women’s game and “referees” in box 
lacrosse.
Knowing what it takes 
to be a good official
Working as a an official in any sport, you must gain respect from players, 
coaches, peers, and fans. And you gain this respect by developing a reputa-
tion for calling a good game and by being consistent in the calls that you 
make.
You have to enjoy the sport, you have to be physically and mentally fit, and, 
most important, you have to know the rules. Proper positioning — that is, 
being in the best position to see the most action — is an asset to an official. 
Conditioning and practice enable you to be in the right place at the right 
time. Proper positioning also assures players and coaches that you’re up to 
the tempo of this very fast-paced game.
When you’re a team player, you get to know your teammates and what to 
expect of them. The same is true with refereeing: When you work as an offi-
cial, you often have different partners to cooperate with, so you have to get 
to know each other’s styles.

55
 Chapter 4: Laying Down the (Lacrosse) Law
 
The hardest and most difficult thing to do as an official is to let the players 
play the game while still keeping control of it. Officials must know what to call, 
when to call it, and when to let things go. Patience also plays a big part, 
because officials are constantly challenged by players who want to find out 
what they can get away with.
An official calls what he sees from where he’s positioned. A good official 
keeps up with the pace of the game and quickly covers the play. Because 
youth lacrosse is generally played during the spring and summer, hot 
weather can add a lot of friction to the game, and tempers can easily flare 
when calls are missed.
Looking at the different types of officials
Most high school field lacrosse games are officiated with two or three offi-
cials. A bench official is often added for playoff games. College officiating 
crews are often comprised of a head official and two other officials. A bench 
official and bench manager may also be used. An official scorer must be pro-
vided by the home team.
 
Two umpires officiate most women’s field lacrosse games, though three 
umpires are used at the NCAA level. The home team must provide an official 
scorer.
 
The NLL uses a four-man refereeing system. Three referees — the crew chief, 
the referee, and the technical referee — are on the floor. The technical referee 
(or tech ref) watches the benches, determines when a team has too many 
players on the floor, and starts the faceoffs. The crew chief and the referee call 
the balance of the game as if they were working only a two-man system, with 
the crew chief having the final say when discrepancies occur or when some-
thing is missed. The fourth referee operates the shot clock, times the penalty 
situations, and monitors the game flow.
Managing the games within the game
Throughout any game, officials keep their eyes on what they call mini-games 
(bursts of exciting action that take place over a short period of time, usually 
benefiting one team only). You may notice some mini-games after a team has 
been hit with several penalties in a row, after one team has scored several 
goals in quick succession, or after a team loses a once-commanding lead. All 
these events frustrate players and coaches, adding an extra challenge to the 
officials’ roles. Good officials recognize these situations and know how to 
keep control of the game and make sure that all calls are legitimate and not 
overblown.

56
Part I: Getting Started 
 
In box lacrosse, when referees lose control, fighting will erupt — and this 
could lead to bench-clearing brawls. Being an official in a brawl situation is 
tough, and when the crowd gets involved, it can be mind-boggling.
 
The best any official can do when a fight breaks out is to take a step back and 
make mental notes on what’s happening, looking for the dirty stuff that leads 
to major penalties and match penalties. When the situation starts to wind 
down, then the official’s “coaching” begins, with a lot of yelling at players and 
coaches. The players eventually come to grips and stop fighting, as they, too, 
become aware of the game misconduct and possible suspensions looming.
As for unruly fans, leave them to the public law enforcers who are often pres-
ent. It’s their job.
 
Here are a few guidelines that can help you become the best official you 
can be:
 
✓ Be consistent. Lacrosse is a fast-paced game with a lot of contact (in the 
men’s game) and many borderline calls to make or not make. So, you 
have to be consistent in what you call a penalty and what you don’t and 
set the tone early in the game.
 
✓ Be fair. Fairness is the most important attribute of any official. Officials 
are the only objective and neutral arbiters of the game. Act accordingly.
 
✓ Communicate with coaches. Talk to both head coaches throughout the 
game, but especially after calls they may dispute.
 
✓ Admit mistakes. We all make them — so will you. When it happens and 
you realize it, acknowledge it and correct it.
The Fine Print: All the Rules 
You Need to Know
The sidebar “Cheers to Beers: The first set of lacrosse rules” earlier in this 
chapter offers an interesting look at how the game was played in its early 
years. This section looks at how lacrosse is played today, including the rules 
that dictate the game and the penalties that enforce those rules, from the 
perspective of how an official calls the game.

57
 Chapter 4: Laying Down the (Lacrosse) Law
Playing the game
Though the following game situations may seem clear, the official makes 
them all, well, official. The official signals you may see during a game for 
these situations are shown in Figure 4-3.
 
✓ Delayed penalty: When a penalty occurs during play and the non-offending 
team has possession of the ball, the referee signals a delayed penalty, 
meaning that a penalty is being called against the defensive team. The 
offensive team is allowed to continue play until the defensive team gets 
possession, at which time play is called and the penalty is assessed.
 
✓ Faceoff: The faceoff takes place after a goal, at the beginning of every 
quarter or period, or when the ball goes out of bounds or over the play-
ing boards.
 
✓ Goal disallowed: If a team scores, but the goal is disallowed because 
someone was standing in the crease or for some other violation, the ref-
eree signals no goal.
 
✓ Goal scored: When the ball goes into the net, the referee signals a goal.
 
✓ Shot on net: When a shot on net is called, the team closest to the ball 
when it goes out of bounds gains possession when the ball is thrown in 
bounds.

Losing possession on game violations
These infractions of the rules lead to the offensive team losing possession 
of the ball. When play is stopped because of these violations, the defensive 
team receives possession in its own zone. Figure 4-4 shows the official signals 
for these situations:
 
✓ Five-second count: After stopping the ball in the crease, the goaltender 
has 5 seconds to get the ball out and to a teammate or lose possession 
of the ball.
 
✓ Twenty-second count: When a defensive team takes possession of the 
ball in its own zone, it has 20 seconds to push the ball up into its offen-
sive zone.
 
 In box lacrosse, this is a 10-second count, but the signal is the same.
 
✓ Back over: In box lacrosse, when an offensive team has the ball in its 
offensive zone, and the ball goes back over the offensive line into the 
neutral zone or into the defensive zone, for any reason other than a shot 
on net, the offending team loses possession of the ball.
 
✓ Free-hand check: If the stick handler pushes off a defending player, usu-
ally with his upper arm and forearm, possession is awarded to the non-
offending team.
 
✓ Goal-crease violation: This violation is called when an offensive player 
reaches or leans into the crease (except for faking or attempting a shot). 
Minor and major penalties may also be assessed for illegal play around 
the net (see the next section).
 
✓ Hand ball: If a player other than the goalie touches the ball with his 
hand outside of the goal crease, possession is awarded to the non-
offending team.
 
✓ Shot-clock violation: In the MLL, if the offensive team does not attempt 
a shot in 60 seconds (30 seconds in the NLL), it loses possession of the 
ball. (The official has no signal for this violation; instead, the shot clock 
buzzes to indicate that time has expired.)
Paying for penalties
Men’s lacrosse has timed penalties — 30 seconds, 1 minute, and 3 minutes 
in field, and 2-, 5- and 10-minute penalties as well as match penalties in box. 
Combinations of penalties can also be assessed depending on the infraction.

In women’s lacrosse, teams receive free position shots after penalties, which 
are similar to foul shots in basketball in that the team that benefits from the 
call is awarded a free shot on goal (or pass if it so chooses).
 
Box lacrosse also has game and gross misconducts, which are not timed pen-
alties but instead exclude the penalized player from the game (and possibly 
future games, depending on the severity of the penalty).
The team that is called for the penalty must serve it, resulting in the offend-
ing team playing one player short. The non-offending team goes on a man-up 
(field lacrosse) or power play (box lacrosse), which gives them an advan-
tage for the time of the penalty. If the non-offending team scores during the 
penalty, the penalized player can leave the penalty area and return to play. 
For a major or match penalty, the man-up (or power play) can result in two 
potential goals before the penalty is wiped out. Depending on the league, the 
penalized player may or may not be released; if not, another player can play 
for the balance of the penalty time.
The most common personal fouls in men’s field lacrosse are
 
✓ Slashing: No stick swing is allowed against the body of the opponent.
 
✓ Tripping: Any checking below the waist of an opponent, whether by a 
stick or by any part of a player’s body, is tripping.

60
Part I: Getting Started 
 
✓ Unnecessary roughness: This is called when excessive contact to the 
opposition, which can often be violent, occurs.
 
✓ Cross-checking: Cross-checking is usually delivered to the midsection 
of the arm or on the back area. Cross-checking is legal when the oppos-
ing player is in possession of the ball. When the cross-checked player 
doesn’t have the ball, it’s an infraction.
Other personal fouls include
 
✓ Illegal stick: Officials perform random stick checks at the end of each 
quarter to make sure stick length and pocket size conform to regula-
tions. For example, if, when placed in the pocket on a stick check, the 
top of the ball is under the top of the sidewall, the stick is illegal. (For 
more on stick regulations, turn to Chapter 2.)
 
✓ Unsportsmanlike conduct: This penalty may be assessed when a player 
or someone on the bench conducts himself in an unsportsmanlike way.
 
✓ Illegal body check: This penalty occurs when a player checks an oppo-
nent below the waist, above the shoulders, or from the rear, or when he 
checks an opponent who is within 5 yards of a loose ball or who doesn’t 
have possession.
Technical fouls include pushing, holding, off sides, illegal screens, stalling, 
and warding off.
Penalties in the box
Here are some of the two-minute box lacrosse 
penalties, also referred to as minors:
 ✓ Cross-checking: See the “Paying for penal-
ties” section for a description.
 ✓ High-sticking: No stick-check is allowed 
above the shoulders of an opposing player.
 ✓ Holding: When a player grabs hold of 
another player’s body, sweater, and/or 
stick, thereby keeping him from the play, 
this penalty is called.
 ✓ Checking from behind: This penalty is 
called when a player cross-checks an 
opponent from behind. This penalty can 
be a 2-minute, a 5-minute, or even a match 
penalty, depending on the severity of the 
hit.
 ✓ Hooking: A player can’t use the stick as a 
“hook” to slow down an opponent.
 ✓ Interference: This penalty applies to several 
situations. It’s used when a player makes 
contact with an opposing player during a 
line change, or otherwise interferes with 
a player or goalie. Other examples include 
when a player loses his stick and an oppo-
nent redirects it so that it can’t be retrieved, 
or when a player gets in the way of another 
player who doesn’t have the ball but is exe-
cuting a play.
 ✓ Slashing: See the “Paying for penalties” 
section for a description.
 ✓ Tripping: See the “Paying for penalties” 
section for a description.

61
 Chapter 4: Laying Down the (Lacrosse) Law
 ✓ Unsportsmanlike conduct: See the “Paying 
for penalties” section for a description.
 ✓ Too many players on the floor: This infrac-
tion usually occurs when one player is a 
little too fast to get on the floor during a line 
change (or one player is a little too slow to 
get off the floor).
All the common minor penalties can lead to 
5- or 10-minute penalties, depending on the 
severity of the infraction and the discretion 
of the referee. Here are some of the common 
5-minute penalties: 
 ✓ Boarding: Players may hold up opponents 
against the boards to try to slow down their 
momentum or steal the ball, but checking a 
player into the boards brings down a major 
penalty. If you bring down the player and 
he doesn’t get back up, you may be up for 
some serious suspension time.
 ✓ Butt-ending: Jabbing an opponent with 
the butt end of the lacrosse stick (or some-
times even pretending to jab your oppo-
nent) will land your butt in the penalty box 
for 5 minutes.
 ✓ Charging: No credit card will get you out of 
this penalty. A 5-minute penalty is given for 
rushing and running into an opponent.
 ✓ Fighting: Drop your gloves and you may be 
finished for the game (and your team will 
likely spend the next 5 minutes of the game 
short-handed). Drop your gloves more than 
once, and you could risk missing several 
games or even the rest of the season.
 ✓ Spearing: Similar to butt-ending, this pen-
alty involves jabbing an opponent with the 
mouth of your stick.
Unfortunately, extreme penalties do occasion-
ally happen in box lacrosse. These infractions 
typically involve getting caught up in a fight 
between two other players (called third man 
in); severe unsportsmanlike conduct, usu-
ally directed toward a referee; and deliberate 
attempts to injure another player. Get hit with 
one of these penalties, and you’ll be leaving the 
game earlier than you anticipated. You’ll also 
likely be suspended. These penalties are the 
10-minute penalties, game misconducts, and 
match penalties. For these penalties, you’ll be 
removed from the game and a teammate will 
take your place in the penalty box.

efense wins championships. Having possession of the ball is as impor-
tant as it gets. So too is limiting turnovers and penalties. But, in the 
end, the name of the game is scoring. That’s because the team with the most 
goals at the end of the game wins. You can’t get much simpler than that. In 
order for your team to get to that point, however, players must have offen-
sive skills that lead to numerous scoring opportunities. In this chapter, we 
show you how to develop your offensive skills — or the skills of the players 
on your team, if you’re a coach — to help your team score big.
Grasping Basic Stick-Handling Skills
Few players are great stick handlers, the kind you watch with awe from 
the stands. A backhand shot into the top corner of the net or an over-the-
shoulder long bounce shot, a great stick fake on the goalie or on a defender, 
a great pass threaded through a crowd of players into the receiver’s stick — 
you wonder how they saw any opening and how they could get that shot or 
pass off. All these moves, and more, make up stick handling. When a player 
has skills, the ball seems to be glued to his stick, and his stick has “eyes” on 
every pass and every shot.
 
Because lacrosse players don’t actually touch the ball as they do in basketball, 
this skill is best labeled stick handling, rather than ball handling. But you’ll 
hear people use the term ball handling in lacrosse. Just know that it means the 
same thing.

66
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
How do you become a great stick handler? Simple. You practice and practice 
and practice, on your own time. You pass at the wall, you play one-on-one 
with an imaginary defender, and you do crazy tricks with the ball in your stick. 
You practically sleep with the stick and ball — they’re with you all the time, 
wherever you go. You do this until the ball and stick feel like they’re an exten-
sion of your body and until you can do almost anything you want with the ball.
Getting a grip
The key to handling the stick — whether you’re cradling, catching, passing, 
or shooting — is the grip. You hold the stick with your fingers, snugly but 
loosely, so that your wrists can turn and rotate freely. You definitely don’t 
want to grab the stick tight with your fingers wrapped around the shaft and 
the palms of your hands touching the shaft.
Where you place your thumbs is an individual preference — place them 
wherever they feel comfortable. Some players like to let them just gently 
wrap around the shaft; others like to place them along the shaft.
Where you place your top-arm hand (the hand that’s attached to the arm that’s 
closer to the top of the stick) also depends on where it feels comfortable. Your 
top-arm hand can be placed slightly below or slightly above the midpoint of the 
handle. (Note: If you’re a left-handed player — that is, if most of your passes and 
shots come with the stick on your left side of your body — your top-arm hand is 
your left hand. Right-handed players use the right hand as the top-arm hand.)
Your bottom hand is usually placed at the butt end of the stick. Some players 
like to make a bump with tape at the end of the handle so that their hands 
don’t slip off the end of the handle, and for better support of the stick.
Your grip on the stick doesn’t change much during a game. In other words, you 
keep the same grip whether you’re passing or catching. When shooting, play-
ers typically slide their top-arm hand down closer to the bottom hand so that 
they can get more of a whip in their shot, which helps them get more power.
 
If you’re a beginner, you may have trouble catching the ball, so try to grip the 
stick higher up on the shaft, even at the throat of the stick, to make catching 
the ball easier. Holding the stick this way is almost like holding a baseball 
glove, and you improve your chances of catching the ball. When you go to 
pass, you can always slide your top hand down the shaft to the midpoint area.
Cradling the ball
Cradling is maintaining possession of the ball in the pocket of your stick with-
out passing, catching, or shooting and without having to look at the ball. With 

67
 Chapter 5: Getting the Ball into the Goal: Developing Offensive Skills
practice, you’ll know when the ball is in your stick by feeling its weight, not 
by looking at it. By cradling, you can look at the net, see your teammates cut-
ting, and concentrate on beating your defender, all without worrying about 
whether you have the ball in your pocket.
The idea of cradling is to use both your wrists and arms to create the most 
amount of rotation possible. A cradler puts his dominant hand at the top 
of the stick and his other hand at the bottom. The dominant wrist and arm 
should curl toward the shoulder on the dominant side, while the other hand 
should simply guide. It has no purpose in the actual cradle.
 
Cradling is the key to ball handling in the women’s game. Without a pocket 
to stabilize the ball, women’s players must employ centrifugal force, using a 
sweeping yet controlled movement of the cradle to anchor the ball in the stick. 
Cradling is often taught to beginners as an ear-to-ear motion — the shaft of the 
stick is held vertically to either the left or right ear before it’s slowly moved 
to the nose and then to the opposite ear, before repeating the process in the 
other direction and back. As players’ skills advance, they modify their cradling 
so that it’s done with minimal motion and on one side of the body only.
In field lacrosse, you have more room to run than you do in box lacrosse, 
so you have to be more versatile at using both hands with the cradle. But, 
because field players have more space to work with, they can sometimes 
employ a one-handed cradle, using the free arm to protect the arm in which 
they’re carrying the ball and keeping the stick vertical.
 
A warding penalty can be called if you use your free arm in any way to hold, 
push, or control the defender.
 
Most box players have better stick skills and protection than their field 
lacrosse counterparts, because box players can’t simply run away from 
defenders while cradling the ball. They’re constantly under pressure from 
someone.
Players practice three basic styles of cradling, depending on the game situation:
 
✓ Small cradle: You use the small cradle (shown in Figure 5-1) when 
standing stationary, looking to pass to a teammate, or getting ready to 
shoot. You hold the stick in a horizontal position while rocking only the 
stick’s head back and forth slightly by the wrist of the top-arm hand, 
getting ready to pass or shoot. The small cradle locks the ball into the 
middle of the pocket, setting it up for a quick shot, dodge, or pass.
 
✓ Medium cradle: You use the medium cradle (shown in Figure 5-2) when 
running up the field or floor with the ball in a passing or shooting posi-
tion. Here, you hold the stick at a 45-degree angle to the field and the 
cradle is a little more vigorous. You use the top-arm hand to swing the 
stick and head forward and backward to keep the ball in the stick while 
you’re looking to pass or shoot.

68
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
✓ Large cradle: You use the large cradle (shown in Figure 5-3) when taking 
a check. You hold the stick in a vertical position with large movement of 
the stick swinging in and out from your body, using the top-arm hand. 
When the stick is held in this position, your body protects the stick 
while you continue to cradle to feel the ball in your stick.

Beyond Handling: Catching the Ball
Most players who first play the game have more difficulty catching the ball 
than passing it. It’s amazing how the ball can fall right into an inexperienced 
player’s stick and he can still wind up dropping it. A player who’s new to 
the game will tend to tighten up on his grip as the ball approaches his stick 
instead of relaxing his grip and relaxing his top-hand arm. By tightening up, 
the stick acts like a tennis racquet and the ball ricochets off it. This section 
starts with the basics of catching, before we move on to passing.
How to position your body for the catch
The first step in catching the ball is to make sure your body is in the right 
position. Face the stick handler and hold your stick up over your shoulder 
and in front of your body for a target. Hold the stick with your fingers — in 
other words, don’t grab the stick hard — and place your thumbs along the 
shaft. Your top hand should be slightly below midpoint of the handle, while 
your bottom hand is placed at the butt end of the stick. For beginners, keep 
your eye on the ball all the way into the pocket of the stick.

70
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Give and you shall receive the catch
Giving is moving the stick back to absorb the ball into the pocket of the stick. 
To explain the importance of giving on the catch, consider whether you 
could catch a tennis ball with a tennis racquet. If you held the racquet out 
straight and didn’t move it when the ball hit, the ball would bounce off the 
racquet. But if you tried to absorb the tennis ball onto the racquet by moving 
the racquet back as the ball moved toward it, the ball would drop onto the 
racquet without bouncing off.
Catching in lacrosse involves the same motion. Start with the stick beside 
your head. As the ball approaches the stick, relax your top arm backward 
and drop the stick back to gradually absorb the ball into the pocket of the 
stick. By the time you actually catch the ball, the stick should be behind your 
body (as shown in Figure 5-4). And now you’re in a position to pass the ball 
back to your partner.
 
In women’s lacrosse, the best technique to use is to both give and catch 
passes at ear level to develop correct habits as opposed to the bucket catch, 
in which the stick is dropped and the ball settles in place without much skill 
being necessary.
 
Always catch passes with two hands, and don’t move your hands while catch-
ing. Then, after you catch the pass, swap hands quickly — move the head of 
the stick from one hand to the other. The defense will be forced to adjust and 
won’t know which direction you’re going.
 
These days, players don’t wind up their sticks as much as they used to. 
Winding up is pulling a stick far behind your waist or below your shoulder 
before shooting. Instead, most of today’s players hold the sticks beside their 
heads to catch and shoot all in one motion. This adjustment helps them get off 
their shots quickly, giving the goalie less of a chance to stop the shot.
What’s the Catch? Building 
Your Passing Skills
To play lacrosse successfully and with confidence, you have to know how 
to handle the ball and pass it. As with catching the ball, the most important 
place to begin is with your stance.

71
 Chapter 5: Getting the Ball into the Goal: Developing Offensive Skills
 
Figure 5-4: 
Catching 
requires giv-
ing a little.
 

72
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Positioning your body for the pass
A sideways stance is the best position for passing the ball because it also 
helps you protect the stick in a game. Before you pass, position yourself 
sideways from the player who will receive the pass. This position is more 
realistic in a game situation, because if you have the ball in your stick, you’re 
probably being checked or bothered by a defender. Turning your body side-
ways protects the ball from the defender.
Gripping the stick for the pass
The grip of the stick is the same as it is for stick handling and catching. Your 
top hand is at the midpoint of the shaft, and your bottom hand is at the end 
of the handle.
 
Always pass with two hands.
Some players like to move their hands closer for passing and farther apart for 
catching, but you want to make sure not to move your hands when passing. 
When you have the ball, hold the stick vertically at a 45-degree angle with 
your top hand beside your head.
Moving the stick forward with the pass
To start your passing motion, move the top hand straight back, with the butt 
end of the stick pointing at your target. As you prepare to release the ball, 
step with your front foot to get power into your pass.
On the forward motion of the stick, transfer your weight from the back foot to 
the front foot — the foot opposite your stick. Be careful not to step with the 
foot on the same side as your stick because you’ll not only lose power but look 
and feel awkward.
As you bring the stick forward, snap both your wrists and bring the stick’s 
head straight ahead — not across your body — with your top arm fully 
extended and the butt of your stick touching your elbow (see Figure 5-5).
 
To make sure that you’ve thrown a perfect overhand pass, your stick should 
come close to touching your elbow. In reality, the butt of your stick doesn’t 
usually end up touching your elbow — it misses your elbow by a few inches to 
the inside. What you want to avoid is the butt ending up in the stomach area, 
which creates a side-arm passing motion that isn’t as accurate as the over-
hand passing motion.

Remembering the keys to good passing
 
Here are some other important passing points to keep in mind:
 
✓ Don’t hold onto the ball too long. If you do, you’ll open yourself up to 
drawing a check from the defense, or even drawing a double team.
 
✓ Throw hard, crisp passes that are short and parallel to the field. The 
shorter the pass, the less chance it has of being intercepted.
 
✓ Don’t stand still after catching the ball. Make the defense work by 
moving around.

74
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
✓ Try to pass after picking up a ground ball. Because the ball was loose, 
a defender is probably behind you ready to check you or try to strip the 
ball away. So try to find the nearest open man (preferably with a short 
stick). This strategy is also crucial for igniting your team’s transition 
game — a key component for just about any successful lacrosse team.
 
✓ Stress accuracy over power. Pass quickly but don’t sacrifice accuracy.
 
✓ Use the head of the receiver’s stick as your target.
 
✓ Keep in mind that every pass thrown is the responsibility of the 
passer. Make eye contact with your receiver to let him know that you’re 
looking for him. When you do so, you become the eyes of your receiver. 
If your receiver is covered or turning his head for the pass, keep your 
eye on your teammate’s defender to see if the defender is going to hit him.
 
✓ Don’t pass out of panic. Even if you have a defender — or two — draped 
on you, keep moving and look to make a good pass instead of forcing a 
pass that could easily be intercepted.
 
If you drop passes regularly, you could be thinking too far ahead of yourself — 
that is, thinking of shooting or passing off the ball before you catch it. You 
drop the ball not because of poor technique, but because of poor concentra-
tion. Concentrate on catching the ball first, before you think of shooting or 
making a play.
 
In order for a team to pass successfully, the players must be adept at moving 
without the ball and moving well to the ball. Good movement without the ball 
allows you to get open so that you can catch a pass. Moving to the ball is espe-
cially effective when you aren’t being watched by the defense.
Working on Passing and Catching Drills
Passing and shooting on the run are among the most important elements of 
lacrosse. Being able to seamlessly pass, catch, and shoot on the run is much 
more important than any behind-the-back shots, bounce passes, or stick fakes.
 
Behind-the-back passes and bounce passes are more common in box lacrosse 
than they are in the field game. The playing surface is smaller in box, so play-
ers use behind-the-back passes to deceive the opposition because there is less 
reaction time. And bounce passes are a more reliable form of moving the ball 
in box lacrosse than they are on grass.
The drills in this section are designed to help you improve your catching and 
passing skills. You can work on these drills by yourself, with a partner, or 
with your teammates before or after practice. Or you can play a little pass-
and-catch around the neighborhood with a group of friends.

75
 Chapter 5: Getting the Ball into the Goal: Developing Offensive Skills
 
Here are some key things to focus on during passing and catching drills:
 
✓ Situate your body in a position so that you block the defender from 
the ball — similar to boxing out in basketball.
 
✓ Look at your partner’s stick head.
 
✓ Relax the stick right before the ball arrives, and let the momentum of 
the ball carry it back a few inches. Think about catching the ball as if it 
were an egg.
 
✓ Don’t stab at the ball when you’re trying to make the catch. If you do, 
the ball will likely pop out.
 
✓ After catching the ball, drop your stick farther back. This way, you can 
pass the ball from behind your body, with your stick level to the field.
 
✓ Throw hard, level passes, and stay away from rainbow passes. 
Rainbow passes are high-arcing passes that take forever to reach their 
destination. By the time the receiver catches the ball, he’s being hit by 
the defender and he can’t make a good play.
 
✓ Snap your wrists forward on the release of the ball.
 
✓ Freeze your stick on the follow-through. In other words, hold your stick 
for a second at your target so that you get more accuracy on your pass.
 
✓ Take pride in hitting the receiver’s stick.
 
Make sure you’re continually fixing or correcting your stick’s head. Check 
where the pocket should be, how deep the pocket should be, and how many 
shooting strings there should be. (See Chapter 2 for more about the stick 
head.)
Individual passing drills
Here are a couple of passing drills that you can practice on your own. These 
drills emphasize the progression of passing and catching — grip, catch, and 
pass.
1-on-0 form passing
In this drill you pretend to pass without a ball. It’s a good idea to have a 
teammate or coach watch you — someone who can tell whether you’re doing 
all the basics right. Good passers should be able to analyze themselves or 
other players and correct their mistakes.
1-on-0 stationary passing
Shoot and pass against a wall, the arena boards, or a target high on the 
Plexiglas. All the great players develop their passing skills with this drill.

76
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Partner passing drills
The following drills are ones that you can practice with a teammate or a 
parent or a coach. These drills are how great passers are made. Do a few of 
them every day to develop into a good passing player.
2-on-0 stationary passing drills
These drills will definitely help with your passing form. In these drills, just 
two players pass back and forth; it may help to have a third player around to 
watch and help correct any flaws.
 
✓ Practice catching with one partner throwing the ball with her hand, 
not with her stick, to the other partner. You can start with tennis balls 
so that you avoid the tendency to “cheat” by using the weight of the 
lacrosse ball to help you catch.
 
 This simple drill is important, because if you start to throw the ball back 
and forth with your sticks, the balls will be on the field or anywhere 
except near the receiver’s body. By throwing the ball with the hand, at 
least you’re throwing accurately and your partner will have a chance to 
practice catching.
 
✓ Pass and catch with only one hand, usually the top hand. This is a 
good drill for catching and developing wrist snap for passing.
 
✓ Pass and catch from a passing distance you would normally throw 
from in a game, about 30 feet.
 
✓ Move closer together and pass from a short distance, about 10 feet 
apart. Continue making hard and level passes, even at this distance.
 
✓ Move to opposite sides of the field to practice passing from a far dis-
tance. Again continue making hard and level passes from this longer 
distance. You may have a slight arc on the pass because of the distance, 
but not enough to slow the ball down.
 
✓ Practice fake passes. From a normal distance, fake a pass one way and 
then pass the other way to your partner.
 
✓ From a normal distance, do “hot potato” or “quick stick” passing. 
This is passing without any real catch — the ball goes in the stick and is 
thrown back, all in one motion.
 
✓ Practice winding up for a long shot and then passing. Take a wind-up 
position, stick level to the field, as if you’re going to shoot. Then fake a 
shot by twisting your top wrist in before passing.
 
✓ Practice fake shots. Fake a shot by bringing the stick across the front of 
your body and then back as if shooting, but instead pass to your part-
ner. Or you can fake a shot by turning your stick in with your wrists, 
freezing the defender, and then stepping across as if shooting, but 
instead passing to your partner.

2-on-0 stationary timed passing
In this drill, you and your partner count the number of passes you can catch 
in 30 seconds.
In a variation on this drill, if you’re practicing with a number of teammates, 
you can race to see who’s the first pair to catch 20 passes.
2-on-0 stationary passing with two balls
In this drill, one partner throws a ball in the air while the other partner 
throws bounce passes.
2-on-1 “monkey in the middle”
This defensive-pressure drill helps you avoid panicking with the ball when 
you’re being pressured by a defender. Stand about 20 feet apart from your 
partner, with a defensive player between the two of you. The defensive 
player attacks the stick handler and tries to intercept his pass. The stick 
handler passes around the defender’s stick to his partner. The stick handler 
can’t pass until the defensive player is close to him.
For a variation on this drill, the passer can fake a pass and step around the 
defender to pass. The defender then goes after the other partner and plays 
that person’s stick.
2-on-0 passing on the run
For this drill, you work with a number of teammates. Players form two lines 
beside the net — right-handed players in one line, and left-handed players 
in the other. Partners run down the field to the other end, passing back and 
forth.
Team passing drills
Here are some passing drills that you can work on as a team, either at prac-
tice or before a game, in addition to the ones your coach gives you.
Knockout drill
Line up six players — three sets of partners opposite each other. Start the 
drill with two balls. The players pass the balls back-and-forth in random 
order. If a player throws a bad pass or drops a good pass, she gets a point. 
When a player has three points, she’s out of the drill. The drill continues until 
there are two players left passing two balls back and forth and, finally, one 
winner.
The only rule is that you can’t pass to a player who already has a ball.

Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Pepper drill
Line up four passers with one ball opposite one receiver who has a ball. The 
passers pass to the receiver quickly, and as soon as the receiver passes a 
ball, the next passer passes to him.
 
Make him pass quickly so that as soon as a ball is released, another one is 
coming at him.
Zigzag drill
This drill improves stick handling because of its high repetition of passing.
Line the whole team up with everybody opposite a partner. Place a bucket 
of balls at both ends of the line. From one end, the players pass all the balls 
down to the other end of the line in a zigzag formation.
Beating the Defender: 
Moving with the Ball
The great lacrosse players are great because they can easily beat a defender 
and score. You need to be able to pass or collect ground balls, but the big-
gest offensive asset that a player can have is to be able to beat your oppo-
nent one-on-one.
Protecting the ball in the stick
You’re going to handle the ball sometime during a game, so you need to know 
how to protect it from a defender. The key here is the ability to cradle, pass, 
and shoot the ball without looking at it. You need to know that the ball is in 
your stick by cradling and by feel — this gives you freedom to concentrate 
on protecting the ball from a defender by looking at her rather than trying to 
look at the ball and at the defender at the same time. 
Taking a check
Another step in the basics of beating a defender is learning how to take a 
check. The natural tendency when you get hit is to tighten up with your 
body, but this can cause you to become rigid with the stick. Plus, when 
you’re hit, the ball will be jarred loose out of your stick. Instead, do the oppo-
site when you receive a check: Relax and lean into the direction of the force 
of the hit.

79
 Chapter 5: Getting the Ball into the Goal: Developing Offensive Skills
 
When you see or feel a hit coming, take a wide stance to absorb the hit and 
cradle the stick, making sure the ball faces away from the force of the direc-
tion of the hit so that the ball doesn’t pop out of the stick. As you approach 
your defender with the ball, hold the stick low and horizontal across the front 
of your body. Just before you get hit, bring your stick up in a vertical position 
and turn your body sideways to take the hit on the arm, protecting the ball in 
the stick. Keep your head up to look at the net; you may want to shoot or 
watch your checker over your shoulder to see what he’s going to do next.
 
You can slide your top hand up to the throat of the stick to cradle the ball on a 
hit, or you can keep your top hand at the midpoint mark of the handle to be in 
a position to pass or shoot.
 
Unless you’re an experienced player, don’t try to pass when you’re being 
checked. Instead, hold onto the ball until you’re free to dish it off to a 
teammate.
Dodging
One of the most important attributes of any player on offense is the ability to 
dodge. Dodging is the lacrosse equivalent of a basketball player driving to the 
basket past a defender and not just settling for catching and shooting from 
outside. In lacrosse, the purpose of a dodge is to free your hands to make a 
pass or take a shot.
 
These key elements all lead to effective dodging:
 
✓ Use both hands. This way, the defender won’t know what direction 
you’re heading. The easiest player to prevent from dodging is the player 
who isn’t adept with his off hand. If you aren’t adept with your off hand, 
the defender will overplay your strong hand, forcing you to pass off.
 
✓ Keep your head up. By keeping your head up, you’ll have a good view of 
the entire field, which will help you see where to pass or shoot after you 
complete your dodge move.
 
✓ Protect the stick. If you don’t protect your stick, the ball will probably 
be stripped by your defender. Protecting your stick is especially impor-
tant when dodging because, by their very nature, dodges usually are 
made when within a stick check’s reach of the defense.
 
✓ Change direction and speed. Doing one or both of these things is an 
effective way to set the defense up for a dodge.
In the following sections, we cover the five primary dodge moves.

80
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Face dodge
In a face dodge, you run at a defender, pulling the stick across your face to 
the opposite side of your body, and then continue around the defender using 
your body to shield the stick.
Split dodge
A split dodge involves more of a fake than the face dodge does. You run right 
at the defender, stutter-stepping and switching the stick from one hand to the 
other. This move is very similar to the crossover dribble in basketball.
 
The key is to fake that you’re going in one direction, and then change direc-
tions — and hands — after planting your outside foot. Changing speeds com-
pletes the move to perfection.
Roll dodge
A roll dodge is a spin move, in which you slip around a defender using your 
body to shield your stick. Run at a defender with your stick in your right 
hand, plant with your left foot, and spin away from and around the defender. 
(Do the opposite if you’re starting left-handed.)
The keys to beating a defender
If you want to be a good one-on-one player, you 
need the following assets:
 ✓ The ability to hang onto the ball when being 
checked.
 ✓ The ability to move both ways — inside 
to the middle of the field and outside 
toward the sideline.
 ✓ First-step quickness to change direction.
 ✓ Balance to stay standing.
 ✓ Upper-body strength to receive a hit and 
overpower your defender.
 ✓ Intelligence to out-think the opponent.
 ✓ Deception to make the defender expect an 
action and then see something else.
 ✓ Instinct — great players have a knack for 
beating defenders without thinking about 
how they do so.
A great saying in lacrosse is to be quick, but 
don’t hurry. When beating a defender, you 
should have control of your body. Keep your 
offensive moves simple — the less movement, 
the better. Stay relaxed and loose, with your 
knees bent. Slow down and do things with a 
purpose, using patience before you accelerate. 
When you hurry, you tend to appear unsettled, 
frantic, flustered, and confused.
Remember, however, that if you don’t attack the 
defender, he’ll attack you. So neutralize your 
defender by making him react to an offensive 
move.

81
 Chapter 5: Getting the Ball into the Goal: Developing Offensive Skills
Bull dodge
A bull dodge is common in the box game and really can only be used effec-
tively by an offensive player with size and power. It’s simply leaning into a 
defender while cradling the stick away on the opposite side and using your 
size and strength to create enough room to pass or shoot.
Question-mark dodge
The question-mark dodge is the most complicated of the dodge moves. 
Starting behind the goal, you can go left or right, curling around and in 
toward the goal, before sharply spinning back away from the cage and shoot-
ing, creating a question-mark path.
This move is not used to beat a defender as much as it is to create enough 
space to get off a shot.
Cutting: Moving without the Ball
Moving without the ball helps you to beat a defender and get in the clear for 
a pass. The most basic play and effective move without the ball is the go play, 
where you just cut past your defender from the off-ball side. It can be a move 
of first-step quickness and deception; you knock your defender’s stick down 
and go.
Another common move is the body fake, a deception in which you make your 
defender think you’re going to do one thing and then you do something else. 
The body fake is a move more of quickness than of strength. Your quickness 
helps make the fake move look like the real thing, instead of looking like a 
fake. You make a body fake usually on the run to get your defender off bal-
ance by reacting to your fake. You can make one of two body fakes: 
 
✓ The outside-fake move, where you fake a cut to the outside and then cut 
back inside
 
✓ The inside-fake move, where you fake a cut to the inside and then cut 
back outside
The other type of fake is the fake shot, which is an offensive move that 
has more to do with the stick than the body. A good fake shot freezes the 
defender for a split second to give you enough time to go around him. You 
can wind up to fake a shot and then pull your stick in front of your body and 
go around the outside of the defender.

82
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
Relax on the hit. Resisting a check is counterproductive. Instead, you should 
relax your body to become dead weight and equalize pressure, which makes it 
harder to push you out of the way. And protect your stick after you go by the 
defender because the defender will go after your stick from behind you to dis-
lodge the ball. In fact, some defenders even let you go by them on purpose — 
this is called the matador defense — and then try to stick-check you from 
behind. This is similar to the trail check, in which a defender checks the stick 
of an offensive player from behind out of necessity but not by design — 
because the offensive player is one or more strides ahead of the defender, 
often near the goal area.
Cutting to the cage
So you want to know what the best box lacrosse 
players, the ones in the National Lacrosse 
League, use to beat the best defenders? 
Read on.
 ✓ The inside-slide or bull move: This is the 
most common one-on-one move used by 
players to cut across the top of the zone. 
All you do is lean into your defender and try 
to muscle your way past him across the top 
of the offense, a natural move. Usually, this 
move starts on the side of the floor so that, 
when you eventually get by your defender, 
you’re in the middle of the floor in a good 
position to shoot.
 
 You have to turn your body sideways to take 
the cross-check on your non-stick shoul-
der, remembering to take a wide stance for 
balance and support and to lean with your 
body and dip your shoulder into the cross-
check. Swing or cradle your stick vertically 
so you know where the ball is. When you 
have the ball in your stick, it should never 
stop moving.
 ✓ The outside-slide move: In this move, the 
stick handler leans into his check and cuts 
outside toward the boards to slide back 
in toward the net. You need this move 
to counter the inside-slide move when 
defenders overplay you to force you to the 
boards. In the past, this move was used 
only periodically, but now it’s executed as 
much as the inside-slide move.
 
 When you approach the defender, turn your 
body outward facing the boards, while at 
the same time swinging your stick outside 
to protect it. Taking the cross-check on 
the stick side, or inside shoulder, lean your 
body weight on the defender as you move 
down the side of the floor, trying to weasel 
your way back in to get on the inside of the 
defender.
 ✓ The inside and outside spins: To execute 
the inside spin, you fake the outside-slide 
move (make it look real), lean on your 
defender who is cutting to the outside while 
receiving a cross-check, and then quickly 
roll back inside and cut across the top for 
the shot.
 
 To execute the outside spin, you fake the 
inside-slide move (again, make it look real), 
lean on your defender cutting to the inside 
while receiving a check, and then quickly 
roll back and cut outside for the shot.

 Chapter 5: Getting the Ball into the Goal: Developing Offensive Skills
Practicing Individual Offensive Drills
Though lacrosse is a team game, you can play it by yourself to get better. The 
great players have always stressed how important it is to their games to go 
to a wall and practice on their own. They always have a stick in their hands. 
Instead of putting it away between practices, they constantly cradle or shoot. 
They play against imaginary defenders, practice stick faking or body faking, 
or shoot at a net or a wall. All this practice is never work to them, but fun, 
helping them in their drive to be the best.
You can practice many of the drills in this section on your own. But most 
important, take a tip from the game’s great players and work with your stick 
whenever you have the chance, not just in practice or during a game.
Individual cradling drills
The drills in this section help with both cradling and stick handling.
1-on-0 stationary cradling
Stand still and practice cradling the ball in your stick. This is one of the best 
drills that you can do at any time, anywhere, on your own.
 
For a little variety, try jogging while cradling.
1-on-0 fake shot
From all positions (overhand, sidearm, and underhand), just keep the ball in 
your stick and circle your body without dropping it. Or keep the ball in your 
stick and wave the stick out in front of your body.
Stick-handling drills with a partner
Try your hand at these 2-on-0 catching and passing drills with a partner:
 
✓ Pass two balls simultaneously. You can try both players passing 
through the air, or one partner passing through the air and the other 
throwing a bounce pass.
 
✓ Throw underhanded passes only.
 
✓ Throw sidearm passes only.
 
✓ Throw behind-the-back passes only.

84
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
✓ Pass and catch the ball with only one hand on your stick — first your 
left hand and then your right hand.
 
✓ Swing your stick to your opposite hand and then flip the ball under-
hand or overhand to your partner.
Protecting-the-ball-in-the-stick drills
Working with your teammates or a couple of friends, these drills help you 
with ways to keep defenders from poking the ball out of your stick.
1-on-1 circle drill
In this drill, the defender tries to check the stick handler’s stick using the over-
the-head check, wraparound check, or stick-check. The stick handler looks 
over his shoulder to protect the stick while constantly cradling. The stick han-
dler can only move in a confined area. Start and stop on the whistle, or you can 
play it so that whoever hangs onto the ball the longest is the winner.
1-on-2 circle drill
This drill is similar to the drill in the preceding section, except the stick han-
dler can move a little bit more because he now has two defenders trying to 
get the ball off of him.
Taking-a-check drills
As a lacrosse player, you have to be ready to take a hit, even when you’re 
practicing. Working on these drills will help you get your body ready to 
absorb a real hit during a real game.
Shoot-through drill
Start with four lines — two down low just behind the goal and two above the 
restraining line. (Two players act as defensemen on either side of the goal.) 
The drill starts with the upper lines carrying the ball and passing off to the 
players down low, who catch the passes while moving toward the goal. The 
stick handlers then power through hard checks from the defensemen before 
unleashing their shots.
1-on-1 bump drill
The defensive player pushes the stick handler with his hands, and then he 
bumps the stick handler with his body. The key here is that the stick handler 
has to relax his body on any hit instead of tightening up.

85
 Chapter 5: Getting the Ball into the Goal: Developing Offensive Skills
1-on-1 charging defender drill
In this drill, the stick handler is stationary while the defender runs at or 
charges the stick handler to hit him with his body and dislodge the ball.
 
The stick handler must relax on the hit.
1-on-1 equalize pressure
The stick handler leans on the defender and moves across the top of the field 
or floor, trying to slide off the check for a shot. If he runs out of territory, he 
rolls or spins back and still leans on the defender, but he tries to cut around 
the defender on the outside.
In a variation on this drill, the stick handler leans on the defender and moves 
outside, trying to slide off the check and back inside for a shot. If he runs out 
of territory, he rolls or spins back and still leans on the defender, but he tries 
to cut around the defender cutting across the top.
1-on-1 man-in-the-middle drill
The defender plays behind the offensive man who receives a pass from the 
pointman at the top of the offense. The defender can only push on the offen-
sive player while the offensive player leans into him relaxed to catch the ball, 
turn, and shoot.
Making a game of drills
Running drills doesn’t have to be all work and 
no play. Here are a couple of suggestions for 
turning your box lacrosse practice sessions into 
a competition:
 ✓ Tag game: Use five balls with six players in 
a confined area marked off by cones. The 
player without the ball is “it,” and he must 
go after the stick handlers and try to steal a 
ball from one of them. If he’s successful, the 
player whom he stole the ball from is now it.
 ✓ British bulldog game: In this game, there 
are two teams, one along the sideboards 
with balls, the other in the middle of the 
floor. On the call “British bulldog,” play-
ers with the balls run across the floor to 
the other side, trying not to get checked off 
or lose the ball. If a player is checked and 
loses the ball, he now becomes part of the 
defensive team to check the stick handlers. 
Last man with a ball is the winner.

86
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Beating-a-defender drills
These drills are best practiced with teammates or friends. You need to have 
the experience of seeing a defender lose his balance or get fooled in some 
way so that you can anticipate when to blow past him.
1-on-1 offensive-move progression
This drill is a progression to practice offensive moves — first when neither 
player has a stick, then when only the offensive player has a stick, and finally 
when both players have sticks:
 
✓ One partner practices an offensive move to beat his partner. The 
defender plays token defense by just leaning on the stick handler with 
his stick.
 
✓ One partner practices an offensive move to beat his partner. The 
defender pushes and shoves with his stick.
 
✓ One partner practices an offensive move to beat his partner. The 
defender uses solid checks.
Gauntlet drill
In this drill, stick handlers zigzag, or go in and out, around a straight line of 
stationary players. This drill helps players work on balance, quickness, pro-
tecting the stick, and relaxing when taking a hit.
The stationary players can’t move, but they can check the stick handlers 
as they go through the line to force them to protect the balls in their sticks. 
They can try to stick-check the stick handlers to try to get the ball from 
them, either while the stick handler faces them or after the stick handler has 
passed them.
1-on-1 offense from a stationary start with a cross-field pass
Start with two lines with balls — left handed and right handed. The first offen-
sive player in each line is covered by a defender. The first offensive player in 
one line doesn’t have a ball, but he receives a cross-field pass and then goes 
one-on-one against the defender, just as in a real game.
The offensive player who just passed receives a pass from the next player in 
line and goes one-on-one. You rotate from the offensive line to a defender.
1-on-1 live half-field drill
Start these one-on-one drills with the stick handler having a ball, with the 
defender having the ball and passing it to the offensive player, from a ground-
ball situation, or from a pick situation. Here are some variations:

87
 Chapter 5: Getting the Ball into the Goal: Developing Offensive Skills
 
✓ The stick handler tries to beat the defender by turning sideways to 
receive the cross-check.
 
✓ The stick handler tries to beat the defender by turning his back to the 
defender and rolling back and forth.
 
✓ The stick handler tries to beat the defender by working him (rolling 
back and forth, faking one way or the other) for as long as he can. With 
patience and continual movement, an offensive player can beat any 
defender.
 
✓ The stick handler tries to beat the defender when the defender tries to 
take the ball from him. The defender can use an over-the-head check or 
wraparound check.
 
✓ The stick handler tries to beat the defender facing him in just 5 seconds.
The offensive player should keep his stick cocked as much as possible, 
always look to shoot, and not shoot from the wrong side of the field, but go 
back to his proper side to shoot (that is, the left-shot side or right-shot side).
1-on-1 off the bench
A right-shot player rolls the ball to the goalie and breaks for a return pass 
around midfield. When he catches the ball, a left-shot defender comes off the 
bench to play defense. They go one-on-one.
1-on-1 game
Make up two teams — right shots and left shots. The defender has the ball 
and passes to the offensive player in front of him. The offensive right shot 
gets one point if he beats his defender and another point for a score. You can 
play to 15 points.
Here are some variations on this drill:
 
✓ The stick handler on the run attacks the defender.
 
✓ The stick handler, from a stationary position, attacks the defender.
 
✓ The stationary offensive player receives a cross-field pass and then goes 
one-on-one.
 
✓ The offensive player cuts to the ball on the run for a pass and shot.
 
✓ The offensive player receives a down pass in the corner area or pops 
out and goes one-on-one.

88
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Taking shots after beating a defender
The section “Practicing individual offensive drills,” earlier in this chapter, 
offers suggestions for some of the most basic offensive moves that you can 
make to try to get in position for an open shot. You can use the following 
drills to work on both those moves and the shots that follow the moves. 
Shoot against an outdoor target or at the net before or after practice.
 
✓ Inside-slide move, across the top of the zone, or an outside-slide move 
and shoot: If you’re working with a friend or teammate, ask him to hit 
you while running or shooting.
 
✓ Inside- or outside-spin move and shoot: Practice shooting while running.
 
✓ Outside body fake and shoot: Fake outside, cut inside, and shoot.
 
✓ Inside body fake and shoot: Fake inside, cut outside, and shoot.
 
✓ Fake shot, cut to outside, back to inside, and shoot.
 
✓ Fake shot, cut to the middle in front of the crease, and shoot.
 
✓ Fake shot while sidestepping down the side, and then cut across the 
top in front of the crease for a shot.
 
✓ Fake shot while sidestepping down the side, and then spin outside 
and in for a shot.
 
✓ Bait move while being checked: Expose your stick over your shoulder, 
and when the defender goes after it, pull it back in and shoot.
 
When you take the shot, aim for an area behind the goaltender because he’ll 
probably move. So if you look toward the goalie, the shot will probably wind 
up hitting him. Shooting with a quick release is also an effective weapon in 
scoring goals. For starters, it often prevents the defense from getting in posi-
tion to throw a check. Plus, it prevents the goaltender from getting set up to 
make a save.

Chapter 6
Putting the Ball in the Goal: 
Shooting Fundamentals
In This Chapter
▶ Improving your shooting skills
▶ Taking outside shots
▶ Taking shots from close in
▶ Practicing shooting drills
S
hooting is one of the most important skills a lacrosse player can have. And 
great shooters have the knack of not only shooting the ball straight — and 
hard — but also “thinking” their way around a goalie. Shooting is just like 
passing a ball against a wall, but a little bit harder. (In fact, later in this chap-
ter, we explain how using an actual wall can help you improve your shooting 
skills.)
In lacrosse, every player on the field is allowed to shoot and potentially score — 
even goaltenders (though on extremely rare occasions). And that’s a good 
thing, because scoring is the fun part of lacrosse. There’s nothing quite like 
hitting the back of the net behind a goalie.
In this chapter, we offer the fundamentals of shooting to score, as well as the 
skills you should work on and some drills to help you build those skills.
Becoming a Great Shooter
Some lacrosse players seem to be able to score at will; others couldn’t get 
the ball in the water if they fell out of a boat, to borrow a saying that shows 
how bad some players can be at it. If you work on your shooting form, you’ll 
definitely improve your shooting percentage (the number of goals you make 
divided by the number of shots you take), making you a better shooter.

90
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
Some players just don’t have the touch or feel for shooting. Whether it’s their 
technique, their body size (usually too bulky), their stick, the way they hold 
their stick, their confidence, their selection of shots, or their timing, one or 
more of these traits is keeping them from being good shooters.
Acquiring a shooter’s stick
The tool of the trade for the shooter is the stick (also known as the crosse). 
The great shooters can take the head of a stick apart and restring it the way 
they like it. The pocket is crucial to becoming a great shooter.
 
Great shooters’ sticks have a few things in common:
 
✓ A pocket that’s located high: You’ll never meet a great shooter who has 
any of the following: a pocket that is at the throat of the stick (where the 
head joins the handle of the stick). Some shooters like the feel of the ball 
hitting the end of the plastic frame of the head just slightly so that they 
know the ball has left the stick. A high pocket, which is near the scoop 
of the head, is ideal for perimeter shooting in the field game and is the 
pocket of preference for box players, too.
 
✓ A pocket depth that’s about equal to a ball’s depth: Great shooters 
don’t have a pocket that’s too shallow (because the ball has a hard time 
staying in a shallow pocket) or too deep (because then the stick can’t 
be used to pass and shoot quickly and accurately). They have to get the 
pocket depth just right — about a ball’s depth — and the ball should 
come out of the pocket nice and smooth.
 
 Depending on the type of shooter you are, you may find different types 
of pockets to be more effective. The deeper the pocket, the more whip 
and power it has. Outside shooters generally employ deeper pockets to 
put more power behind their shots. Inside players don’t need as much 
power; they benefit more from a shallower pocket that zips the ball right 
off the stick.
 
✓ A pocket with shooting strings: Shooting strings are adjustable strings 
that run horizontally below the head of the stick. The ball should rest at 
the tip of the pocket on the last shooting string.
Getting the ball past the goalie
To shoot a little white ball behind a goalie into a net takes more than just the 
ability to hit an open spot. Why? Because goalies tend to move. If goalies just 
stood there and gave you the shot, lacrosse wouldn’t be much of a game. So 
the first trick to shooting is to learn to read the goalie.

91
 Chapter 6: Putting the Ball in the Goal: Shooting Fundamentals
Some goalies, called reflex goalies, show you an open spot and then take it 
away. Others come out on an angle to take away openings. They’re ready to 
move sideways, anticipating where you’re going to shoot by reading your 
eyes, reading the position of your stick, or just plain guessing where they 
think the shot is going. (For more about the types of saves that goalies make, 
see Chapter 8.)
 
The great shooters believe that they can shoot faster than a goalie can 
move, so if they see an open spot, they just shoot it. Goalies can be scored 
on because they have more to contend with than just a stationary shooter. 
Goalies have to move according to where the ball is, watch for cutters, and be 
aware of opponents around the net.
Focusing on form
To become a player with “the touch” — someone who can shoot hard with 
the ball always going where it should — you have to be aware of your shoot-
ing form. Great form means never looking as if you’re forcing your shot.
 
Soft hands (see the nearby sidebar, “Can great shooting be taught?”) come 
from having proper form: using your wrists, holding the stick with your fingers 
loose, extending your wrists back when cocking your stick, and then extend-
ing your wrists fully on the follow-through.
Resolving shooting problems
If you’ve mastered a shot in practice, why can’t you make it in a game? A 
number of things can contribute to this problem:
Can great shooting be taught?
Do great shooters have a touch, a natural thing, 
something they’re born with? Some players 
were born with soft hands — they can catch, 
throw, and shoot effortlessly and accurately. 
But most players have to put in the practice 
time to make themselves better shooters.
After you’ve mastered the proper mechanics of 
shooting, you have to practice every day to take 
your shooting skill to the next level. Confidence 
comes from taking 100 to 200 shots a day until you 
feel confident about where the ball is going and 
can hit that spot on the wall almost every time.

✓ You may have stopped believing in yourself. By practicing your shoot-
ing until you know you can hit whatever you’re aiming at, your confi-
dence will soar again.
 
✓ You may be telegraphing your shot (looking directly at where you’re 
going to shoot). Limiting your windup — just catching and shooting — 
keeps the goalie on his toes.
 
✓ You may be taking bad shots (for example, from a bad angle or from 
the wrong side of field), or maybe you’re being pressured or checked 
when you shoot.
 
✓ You may be rushing or hurrying your shot. Be patient. If you don’t have 
a good shot, don’t shoot.
 
✓ You may be bombing your shot (just winding up and shooting at no 
particular spot). Winding up is essential for perimeter shots, but you 
need to have a target in mind when you take them. Aiming to either side 
of the goal is helpful.
 
✓ You may lack concentration by not focusing on the open spot. Great 
shooters can focus on one thing — the open spot left by the goalie — 
and block out everything else.
 
If your fundamentals are fine, but you’re still having trouble shooting, you may 
be in a scoring slump. Sometimes players play uptight, so remember to have 
fun and relax. Or you may be trying too hard, so remember not to force your 
shot. Finally, just go back to the basics and practice, practice, practice.
Shooting from a Long Distance
The variety of long shots that you can work on include the overhand shot, 
the sidearm shot, the underhand shot, and the backhand shot (see Figure 6-1). 
It doesn’t matter what type of shot you use. The options for long shots include 
the straight long shot for either top corner of the net, the long bounce shot 
for either top corner or mid-corner, and the long low shot for either bottom 
corner. You also have in your repertoire the fake long shot, which takes a 
quick stick fake — bringing your stick across your body while stepping to the 
outside and then back in for the shot.
 
When you’re working on your perimeter shot, keep in mind the following:
 
✓ Look at the whole net on your shot and pick the open spot. Avoid look-
ing directly at the spot you’re shooting at because some goalies watch 
your eyes. Some players try to trick the goalies by looking at one corner 
and shooting to the other corner.

93
 Chapter 6: Putting the Ball in the Goal: Shooting Fundamentals
 
✓ Shoot with rhythm rather than flat footed. Players, whether they know 
it or not, hop-step (hop with the back leg, and step with the front foot) 
into their shot to synchronize all their body parts with the stick. In addi-
tion to the hop-step, at the end of your shot you should take a forward 
step to create a wide stance for the all-important transfer of body weight 
from the back foot to the front foot. This motion helps to get more 
power into your shot.
 
✓ Make sure that you cock the stick by dropping your stick straight back 
to wind up for your shot. Cocking the stick gives you the much-needed 
power to shoot long.
 
✓ Shoot the ball when it’s in the stick and still behind your head. This 
technique gives you more power than releasing the ball when it’s beside 
your head or in front of your body. The actual release of the ball from 
the stick is important in getting velocity in your shot.
 
 You want to shoot hard but you don’t want to sacrifice accuracy for 
speed. The most important thing to focus on is getting your shot on goal 
so that the goaltender has to make a save.

 Former Syracuse University standout Paul Carcaterra, now a television 
analyst with CBS College Sports and the MSG Network, says shooting is 
all about the follow-through. “Your hands should be away from your 
body,” he says. “That way, the head of the stick will be outside as well. 
One thing leads to another. Remember: No alligator arms, because then, 
you’ll be pushing the ball. Rotate your hips while shooting and then 
complete your follow-through almost as if you’re sweeping the stick 
toward the ground after releasing the shot.”
 
 Great shooters know that they can shoot faster than a goalie can move.
 
✓ Shoot in your range. If you’re in your range and you feel able to make 
your shot, the shot will be more relaxed. If you aren’t in your range — if 
you’re too far out from the goal to feel comfortable about the shot — you’ll 
probably force your shot, trying to make up for the distance. For great 
shooters, the fastest shots are the ones they swing easy with. They don’t 
try to swing or force the shot too much.
 
 If you don’t have a good shot or don’t see an opening to shoot at, don’t 
shoot. Shooting discipline is critical. Many players end up just shooting 
at the goalie, regardless of whether they have something to shoot at.
 
✓ Before you shoot, make sure your stick is not being interfered with. 
That means no stick or body is directly in front of your shot. You may be 
able to use defenders not directly in front as screens — but there needs to 
be a gap between you and the defender so he doesn’t interfere with your 
shot. Don’t shoot around opponents unless they’re playing back from you 
and can’t interfere with your stick. If you’ve beaten your defender, you 
should be one step ahead of him and be wide open before you shoot.
 
✓ You should be able to hit the open spot you’re shooting at. Have 
patience when shooting. Just before you shoot, take a split second to 
look at where you’re going to shoot. Some players rush their shots — 
they take automatics (shots without thinking) and end up hitting the 
goalie in the chest area or playing catch with the goalie (shooting a shot 
that’s easy for him to save).
 
✓ “Think” your way around the goalie. Positioning and strategy are criti-
cal to developing good shooting accuracy. Sometimes you don’t need to 
just shoot the ball straight and hard. Instead, make it look as if you’re 
going to shoot to the far corner by holding your stick in the sidearm 
position, and then bringing it over your shoulder in an overhand shot, 
shooting for the near side.
 
 If you’re shooting straight on with the goalie, step into the middle in 
front of the crease to move the goalie sideways and get him away from 
his near goalpost. This move gives you two options to shoot at: the far 
corner or the near corner.

95
 Chapter 6: Putting the Ball in the Goal: Shooting Fundamentals
Knowing the two best areas to shoot long
Striving to get a high shooting percentage gives your team a higher chance of 
winning. To help your team achieve a high percentage, here are the two best 
areas on the floor from which to shoot long shots:
 
✓ Exactly in the middle, where you have many options to pick from on 
the goalie: Here, you still have good options from the far corner (high or 
low) and the near side (high or low).
 
✓ Off-center on your proper shooting side.
 
Shooters commonly aim their shots for opposite the goalie’s stick side, 
because it takes more time for a goalie to move his stick to make the save. But 
keep in mind that goalies are conditioned to expect shots to be taken there. So 
a more effective move is to look toward an area before shooting, such as the 
low-left corner so the goalie expects the shot to go there, and then fire it to the 
opposite side (in this case, the high right side).
Nailing the overhand shot
When you’re trying to make an overhand shot, your stance is important 
because, in a real game, you’ll typically be turned sideways to protect your 
stick from your check.
Hold the stick with your fingers loosely, with the top hand just below the half-
way point on the shaft. Your stick should be high and behind your head, ver-
tically at a slight 45-degree angle. If you’re really winding up to shoot, move 
your stick backward, level to the field in a cocked position.
The shot originates from behind your head and you release the ball when it’s 
behind your head, but you follow through after the ball is gone. Pull the stick 
forward by extending your top-hand arm forward and snapping the wrists. 
On the follow-through, make sure you fully extend your top-hand arm and 
that the head of your stick points at the target.
 
The stick motion is directly over your shooting shoulder or to the side of that 
shoulder for the overhand shot. To get power, synchronization, and rhythm 
in your shot, step or hop-step into it. Step with your front foot to give your-
self a wide stance, which adds power to your shot. Arm extension is crucial: 
Extend your arm as if you’re throwing a football downfield, with your arm fully 
extended.

96
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Shooting Closer to the Goal
Crease players need to step out in front of the net to execute close-in shots 
and not stand on the side of the crease. Timid players tend to stand beside 
the crease instead of taking the step out in front of the net to get a better 
shot because they’re worried about getting hit from behind.
When you’re taking a straight close-in shot, no fake, just look at one corner 
and shoot at the other corner of the net. If you’re taking a close-in shot to the 
far side of the net, you can take three types of shots:
 
✓ Start from an overhand shooting position to an overhand shot.
 
✓ Start from an overhand shooting position to a sidearm shot.
 
✓ Start from a sidearm shooting position to a sidearm shot.
When you’re taking a close-in shot to the near side of the net, you can
 
✓ Start from an overhand shooting position to an overhand shot.
 
✓ Start from a sidearm shooting position to an overhand shot.
Developing a great fake
Most faking in lacrosse happens around the net, but you may sometimes do 
it when you’re far out with the ball or when you’re in trouble with the ball. 
Faking is used in lacrosse more than any other sport in the world.
 
You need to develop different fakes for different situations:
 
✓ Fake with your body. Jab your foot one way and go the other way.
 
✓ Fake a long shot with your stick. This fake freezes your defender and 
allows you to go around him.
 
✓ Fake a close-in shot against a goalie. This fake allows you to get the 
goalie’s reaction or to freeze the goalie, and you can then shoot to the 
open spot.
 
✓ Fake a pass. You freeze your defender to get yourself out of trouble 
when you’re being pressured by a defender and you don’t know what to 
do. A good fake pass against a defender checking you either freezes him 
or gets him to react by looking to intercept the pass, giving you time to 
go around him or at least giving you time to make a play.

97
 Chapter 6: Putting the Ball in the Goal: Shooting Fundamentals
Becoming a good close-in shooter
Patience is an extremely important asset around the net. But the longer you hang 
onto the ball around the net, the greater your chance of getting hit. So if you 
want to be a good player in close, you can’t be afraid to get hit, because you will.
 
When you’re cutting or running across in front of the net, the general rule is to 
put the ball back where you came from — that is, in the near side of the net.
When you fake a shot at a goalie and he doesn’t move, shoot at the corner 
you just faked at. You can fake right at a big goalie’s body, knowing he won’t 
move, but you’ll freeze him so that you can then pick and shoot. The other 
option you have against a big goalie is not to fake at all — just pick and shoot. 
The bigger goalies tend to rely more on angles.
Practicing Shooting Drills
You can work on shooting drills on your own with some kind of target that 
matches the dimensions of the net, or with a friend or teammate acting as the 
goalie. These drills, however, focus on what you can do in practice or with a 
group of teammates.
What to do on a breakaway
Breakaways are common in the box game, 
because of the limited length. Breakaways can 
occur two to three times a game and usually 
originate from the defensive end when a defen-
sive player anticipates an opponent’s shot and 
heads for his offensive zone early, although you 
sometimes can pass to an open player coming 
off the bench.
If you get a breakaway in a game, make sure 
that you run down the floor off-center, not down 
the middle or straight at the goalie. This gives 
you the option of cutting across the crease to 
move the goalie so that you can shoot to the 
near or far side of the net.

98
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Focusing on long-ball shooting drills
As you’re working on your long-ball shots, here are a few fundamentals to 
keep in mind:
 
✓ On your windup to shoot, your stick should be level to the field.
 
✓ Release the ball when it’s behind your head.
 
✓ Cock or twist your wrists before you release the ball to make sure it’s in 
the shooting pocket.
 
✓ Visualize a perfect shot.
 
✓ When you’re incorporating cutting into your drills, cut hard to the ball or 
pass the ball hard to the cutter. Before you cut, fake a cut the opposite way 
in which you want to cut, and cut with your stick up and ready to shoot.
 
Mix up the spots on goal. You may want a teammate or a coach to shout out 
where to aim. Alternate between shots at each corner, mix bounce shots in 
with shots aimed to the top or bottom of the net. And don’t forget to practice 
your fakes.
Work with several teammates to practice the following perimeter shooting 
drills. Remember to alternate right- and left-handed shooters in the drills.
Single-line drill
Every player has a ball and lines up in the center. Players run down and take 
a straight, perimeter shot from near the top of the box. Change shot locations 
each time down the field.
Semicircle long-ball shooting drill
Form three lines in a semicircle near the top of the box. Each line shoots con-
tinuously, first around the horn and then alternating from side to side. After a 
player shoots, he should fade off to the side.
Two-line shooting drills
With each player cradling a ball, start the two lines from the top of the box 
and then from the top middle. The lines can alternate sides shooting, first all 
right shots and then all left shots.
 
✓ Lines start from the top side of the field and cut across the top, alternating 
among planting their feet and shooting an overhand shot; shooting on the 
run; and faking a shot, pulling the stick across their body, and shooting.
 
✓ Lines start from the top side of the field, facing an imaginary defender, 
and just wind up and shoot.
 
✓ Lines start from one side of the field and cut across the top, alternating 
among planting their feet and shooting an overhand shot; shooting on 

99
 Chapter 6: Putting the Ball in the Goal: Shooting Fundamentals
the run; and planting, faking a windup, pulling the stick across the body, 
and shooting.
 
✓ Lines start from the top corner area of the zone and then cut across the 
top, shooting on the run.
Working on close-in shooting drills
When practicing your close-in shots, don’t forget these tips:
 
✓ Follow your rebound.
 
✓ Make sure that you step around in front of the net before you shoot.
 
✓ Place your top hand higher on your stick when you’re faking. You can 
fake with your wrists only (no arm action), or you can fake with your 
wrists and arms together.
 
✓ On faking, turn your wrists in and fake hard. Think to yourself, “I’m 
going to shoot,” so you make your fake look real. But remember to check 
back so that you don’t end up shooting instead.
 
✓ Against bigger goalies, don’t fake — just pick and shoot.
 
Mix up the spots on goal. You may want a teammate or a coach to shout out 
where to aim. Alternate types of fakes before shooting to alternating corners — 
for example, fake high and then shoot low or fake low and then shoot high.
Shooting games
Here are a couple games that you can work into 
your shooting practice routine:
 ✓ Shooting game “21”: Make up two teams, 
usually left shots against right shots. 
Players can take any type of shot. You get 
one point for a close-in shot, two points 
for a long shot, and three points for a long 
bounce shot. For variation, try close-in 
shooting only. A game goes to 21 points.
 ✓ Breakaway shooting game “15”: In this 
game, the stick handler runs the full length 
of the field, and the coach calls out which 
shot to take: a straight close-in fake and 
shot, a long shot on the run, or a long shot 
from a stationary position just inside the 
box. The game is played to 15 points.
And here’s a game that you can do on your own 
to practice shooting:
 1. Bring a bucket with about 60 balls with you 
to the field along with nine cones.
 2. Place the cones at nine different spots 
inside the box, along with six balls.
 3. Starting from the spot farthest from the 
goal, go from each spot to the next, shoot-
ing six balls on goal from each of the nine 
positions.

100
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Work with several teammates to practice the following close-in shooting 
drills. Remember to alternate right-shot and left-shot shooters in the drills.
Single-line drill
Every player has a ball, and all the players line up at midfield. Players run 
down the field, one right after the other, and take straight, close-in shots in 
rapid succession. Run the line of players again, this time giving players the 
option to fake or just shoot.
2-on-0 shooting drill
Players form two lines — right shots and left shots — one on each side of the 
crease. Each player cradles a ball. On the run, the players alternate from side 
to side and shoot around a cone, which is placed in the middle of the crease.
 
So that you don’t have players running into each other, keep the left shots 
inside and the right shots outside.
2-on-0 passing drill
One line, the passing line, is in the side position, passing diagonally to play-
ers in the other line. The passer passes to a stationary player in the crease 
area, who takes a quick shot. The passer should work on looking at the net 
while passing.
Don’t forget the goalie
If you’re a coach and you’re working on shooting 
drills with your team, remember to tell your goalie 
what’s expected of him during the drill. You want 
your goalie to improve along with your shooters.
Here are some important guidelines:
 ✓ The goalie needs to be properly warmed up 
before a game or practice. This means taking 
shots from a designated “warm-up” shooter, 
who is often a coach or assistant coach.
 ✓ The goalie should stand in a standard pos-
session in the middle of the net so that he’s 
ready to react to whatever types of varying 
shots he’ll face.
 ✓ The goalie should keep his body in a bal-
anced position, so he can easily adjust his 
position depending on the shot.
 ✓ The goalie should remain patient and not 
get jittery or jumpy while waiting for the 
opposing team to get a shot off.
 ✓ The goalie should make his own arc, or imag-
inary semicircle. This is an area in the middle 
about 2 feet from the goal line that covers 
shots that arrive at both the left and right of 
the goalie at varying angles and heights.
Rotating his body positioning will help both the 
shooter and the goalie. The goalie will become 
comfortable defending the net from different 
positioning perspectives, and the shooter will 
be able to practice against a goalie in a variety 
of different positions.

T
he fast pace of a lacrosse game is generally dictated by the offense. But 
that speedy offensive pace requires quickness and stamina from lacrosse 
players on the defensive side of the field, too.
This chapter gives you the strategies and tactics you need to make yourself 
a better individual defender. For information about building team defensive 
skills, see Chapter 10.
Stopping the Ball: Taking 
On the Stick Handler
Keeping up with the stick handler requires the solid combination of a number 
of skills, both physical and mental. This section reviews some of the skills 
that you need in order to play good individual defense.
Communicating with your teammates
For some reason, most lacrosse players have a hard time communicating on 
the field. Being vocal is a must because of all the action and movement that 
happens in a game — and this is especially true when you’re on defense.

102
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
Good defensive communication in a game should cover the following:
 
✓ Picks and screens: Warn your teammates when they’re about to be 
picked off or become the victim of a set screen. (Picks and screens help 
free up an offensive player so that he can get a more open look at the 
net or cut to an open spot for a pass.)
 
✓ Cuts: Let your teammates know when an offensive player is cutting 
toward another spot to receive a pass, usually a position that allows an 
easier shot on goal.
 
✓ Who’s guarding whom: When defending an offensive player, let your 
teammates know who you’re playing against, especially when a pick 
or screen causes you and another defender to switch checks. By not 
communicating, you may create a situation where two defenders are 
inadvertently guarding the same offensive player, leaving someone 
somewhere wide open for an easy shot.
 
✓ Helping: Some game situations dictate when it’s okay to have two 
defenders guarding the same offensive player (called double-teaming). 
If you leave your matchup to double-team the stick handler or another 
offensive player, let the teammate you’re helping know so that he can 
apply more defensive pressure and play more aggressively than usual.
Playing with your feet
One of the keys to defending well is to keep your body in balance. Your feet 
play the biggest role in keeping your body in balance. You play defense with 
your feet to maintain good position. As the offensive player moves, you move 
your feet while staying in your position of readiness with your knees bent, 
back straight, looking directly at your opponent’s chest, not at his stick or 
the ball.
 
A few strategies can help you defend in certain situations:
 
✓ Drop step. You drop step when the stick handler makes a move to the net 
to maintain a cushion. The drop step allows you to be ready to throw a 
check by having weight on your front foot so that you can push off from 
this front foot to stay with the stick handler. This way, if the stick handler 
decides to attack the net quickly, you’re in the position to move back 
quickly. The defender should remain centered and ready to adjust if the 
offensive player moves forward, rolls back, or changes direction.
 
✓ Defend the body, not the stick. Don’t play an offensive player’s stick 
on a windup for a shot — you don’t want to challenge what you think 
may be an upcoming shot. The stick handler could fake his shot and go 
around you, looking for an easier shot or for a teammate cutting to the 
net. Play your opponent’s body, not his stick.

103
 Chapter 7: Keeping the Ball out of the Goal: Developing Defensive Skills
 
✓ Shuffle step. As you move with the stick handler, often down the side-
lines as he tries to beat you, take short shuffle steps, or lateral side-
steps, shuffling sideways to stay with him (as shown in Figure 7-1).
 
 Keep a wide stance as you shuffle. Don’t bring your feet close together 
or you may lose your balance. Also, don’t cross your feet when shuffling. 
You’re more likely to trip over them than gain any advantage against the 
stick handler.
 
 A good way to improve your footwork is to jump rope, including 
weighted ropes. To start, jump rope 50 times. Then increase that 
amount each day in increments of 25.

Playing with your head
We’re not suggesting you make a header as you would in soccer — although 
lacrosse balls have been known to ricochet off helmets. Instead, we’re talking 
about on-the-spot thinking.

104
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
On defense, you have to play with your head differently from the way you 
do when you’re on offense. On offense, you can do all kinds of things with-
out thinking. But on defense, you’re always thinking and trying to anticipate 
what’s going to happen before it does.
 
Knowing your opponent’s strengths, favorite moves, and tendencies helps you 
in this anticipation. Which is his dominant hand? Is he quick? Does he like to 
shoot from the outside? Does he like to work inside?
Offensive players are creatures of habit, always trying to make the same 
move. As a defender, you have to know what your opponent is trying to do so 
that you can take away his primary move.
Establishing effective 
defensive positioning
Defensive positioning simply means being in the right place at the right time. 
In fact, many coaches feel that establishing good defensive positioning is half 
the battle of playing solid defense.
Play with your knees bent to make sure that you stay low, and with your 
feet placed shoulder-width apart for balance. Taking this low body position 
allows you to make quicker and stronger moves against the offensive player.
Also, make sure that you keep your head up by keeping your eyes directed 
to the top of the offensive player’s chest area or the top of the numbers on 
his jersey. Avoid looking directly at the ball, because you’ll probably end up 
trying to go after the ball, stick-checking, and being beaten off the ball. Also, 
if you drop your eyes to look at the waist area, you’ll end up dropping your 
head — again giving the offensive player the chance to beat you.
 
Checking is important, but taking the correct position against the stick han-
dler helps you prevent more scoring opportunities. Never give up body posi-
tion to throw a stick check. Plus, when the offensive player is a threat to feed, 
the defender should constantly keep the stick out in front to apply pressure to 
the bottom hand.
 
The key area to defend on the field is often referred to as the hole. It’s the 
7-yard radius around the goal. According to Adam Lodewick, defensive coordi-
nator at Yorktown High School in New York’s Hudson Valley, “If offensive play-
ers are moving in there freely, then your defense isn’t doing its job.” To help 
protect the hole, players should slough in, or stay tight toward the crease. 
This concept of protecting the crease area forces the offense into settling for 
lower-percentage shots from the perimeter.

105
 Chapter 7: Keeping the Ball out of the Goal: Developing Defensive Skills
 
In most game situations in box, the most effective defensive positioning 
against the stick handler is to force him to the sideboards. To do so, overplay 
the stick handler half a man — in other words, turn your shoulders to the 
sideboards either a quarter-turn or parallel to the boards.
Playing hard and with heart
You have to play hard and with heart. Maintain an attitude that suggests 
you’ll never give up. More often than not, getting to ground balls and playing 
solid defense are the result of who wants it the most.
 
Lacrosse is an aggressive game. To defend well, you need to be aggressive — 
not only in your play but also in your attitude. Defenders who have a reputa-
tion for being cocky and mouthy are thought of as pests. They bother people 
defensively, irritate their opponents, and generally tick people off. They’re 
also usually thought of as good defenders.
Defending the field of play
The distance from one end line to another on a lacrosse field is pretty long. 
So too are the sticks of the defensemen. Field lacrosse teams generally use 
three long-stick defensemen at once, though a fourth can be deployed as a 
midfielder. So space is important — a defensive player needs to use his stick 
to hold off and keep the midfielder or attackman at a distance.
Slashing or checking?
Especially in the National Lacrosse League 
(NLL), you’ll see wraparound checks. These 
checks occur when the defender works around 
the stick handler to get at the ball, poke-check-
ing to dislodge the ball and pressuring the stick 
handler. The poke-check is a move to dislodge 
the ball. The defender tries to poke his stick 
between the offensive player’s stick and body 
to pry the ball loose.
Slashing also has a place in lacrosse. When 
coaching slashing, be sure to encourage play-
ers to give a two-handed slash on the stick 
handler, just to let him know what kind of game 
he’s going to be in. But even while using the 
stick to slash, the players have to stay down. 
Of course, in field lacrosse this kind of slashing 
is illegal. Checking players with a stick is just 
that: a check.

106
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Cross-checking
A significant way in which box lacrosse dif-
fers from field lacrosse is that cross-checking 
is legal in the box game. In a cross-check, a 
defensive player applies pressure to the stick 
handler with his stick.
The defender holds the stick with two hands 
and applies it to the stick handler’s upper-body 
area. This defensive strategy works to slow 
down the stick handler’s drive toward the goal, 
perhaps forcing him to try an off-balance shot 
or pass off to a teammate.
When holding the stick to cross-check, your hands 
should be about body-width apart and your arms 
should be cocked. The open face of your stick 
should point backward to allow for easier pickups 
of loose balls by just turning your handle. Cross-
checking should only be used to stop a stick han-
dler, so you should keep both hands on the stick.
Good defense requires the defensive player to 
make two or three good cross-checks on a play, 
rather than one big hit. He has to move his feet 
constantly to keep up with the stick handler so 
that he can make multiple cross-checks.
Patience is the key in not getting beaten by the 
stick handler. One of the most important things 
to do to play good defense is to wait for the stick 
handler to come to you instead of reaching for 
or lunging at him. While waiting, make sure that 
you keep your feet active and ready to move. So 
get low, relax the muscles, and wait.
On contact, try to remain stationary so that 
you have a solid base with your feet. On the 
cross-check, try to keep the stick handler in the 
middle of the stick, between both hands. Follow 
these steps to deliver an effective cross-check:
 1. When you hit, extend your arms upward 
and outward.
 
 Never overextend on your check, because 
you’ll become vulnerable and off-balance.
 2. As you hit up and under, make contact on 
your opponent’s arm between his elbow 
and shoulder and stay down.
 
 If you stand up on the hit, you’ll lose your 
power and quickness.
 3. During the hit, make sure that your feet are 
under your body for balance.
 4. Cross-check and get off the stick handler.
 
 Make your hits short and hard, and then 
recoil, filling the gap you created with the hit 
by shuffling out with small steps. Just keep 
continually cross-checking. If you lean on 
the stick handler’s body with your stick when 
cross-checking, he’ll roll and slide past you.
You want to force the stick handler toward the 
boards by overplaying him half-a-man. In other 
words, don’t stand directly in front of him — stand 
slightly off to the side of him toward the center 
of the floor. This defensive stance essentially 
gives you a one-player defensive advantage, 
except that the extra “player” is really the side-
boards. Make sure that your hips are parallel to 
the sideboards and your head is aligned with 
the head of your opponent’s stick.
You may have to move out on the stick handler 
to maintain pressure, but you still have to wait 
for him to come to you.
Now this may sound like a contradiction. But 
really when you go after the stick handler, you 
should shuffle the last two steps so that you 
maintain control, keeping a safe distance away 
so that he can’t make his way around you, but 
effectively moving toward him to prevent a 
quick shot.
Against a good long-ball shooter, you can’t 
afford the luxury of thinking that a player can’t 
score from a certain scoring distance and then 
letting him shoot. Defenders can’t stay back 
and let shooters shoot because they will score.

 Chapter 7: Keeping the Ball out of the Goal: Developing Defensive Skills
If you get too close, the offensive player can make a quick move and zoom 
away. Defensemen need time to recover and that requires a space buffer with 
the offensive player.
Another important element of defense in field lacrosse is keeping your head 
on a swivel — figuratively, of course. Always keep your eyes moving between 
your man and the man with the ball.
Defensemen play with both hands on their stick, but they can’t use the space 
between their hands to check an opposing player.
One hand on the stick may be extended toward the offensive player to keep 
him at bay so that the head of the stick is used for this poke check.
Both hands can be involved in the same check if they’re used together, gen-
erally at the bottom of the shaft, to push off the opponent. Contact between 
each stick head is common, as the defensive player tries to check the ball out 
of the opponent’s possession. Defensemen can also use their bodies to hold 
off offensive players.
Stopping the Player: Defending Offensive 
Players without the Ball
Defensive positioning is the primary weapon a defender has against offensive 
players who don’t have the ball. Your goal as a defender is to maintain a posi-
tion that limits the possibility of the player you’re covering receiving a pass 
or cutting to get closer to the net. How you achieve that goal depends on 
which side of the field the ball is on.
Off-ball-side defending
When defending an offensive player on the off-ball side of the defense, you 
should form a flat triangle. In this triangle, you’re at the apex of the triangle, 
and the stick handler and the offensive player you’re covering form the base 
of the triangle. It’s called a flat triangle because you should play off the player 
you’re covering slightly and toward the stick handler in case you need to be 
in a position to help, so you’re flattening the triangle a bit.
If your defense takes the shape of a deeper triangle, you’re more likely to be 
protecting the net than keeping yourself available to help against the stick 
handler. In this situation, the opponent could cut very easily for a pass and 
shot.

108
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
On the off-ball side, always keep your opponent in front of you. If you play 
your check even — that is, parallel to the goal — he could fake up and cut 
behind you for a quick pass and shot. If your opponent goes behind you 
(called a backdoor cut), always assume that a pass is coming and turn and 
play his stick hard.
Off-ball defenders should play an open stance, facing down the field using 
their peripheral vision to see both their man and the ball. A helpful rule for 
defenders is “Two looks to your man, one look to the ball.”
 
In the National Lacrosse League (NLL), which has highly skilled offensive play-
ers, off-ball defenders play closer to their opponents, using more of a closed 
stance, belly to belly.
Ball-side defending
The defenders defending non–stick handlers on the ball side of the field 
should look over their shoulders at the stick handler in case their teammate 
needs help.
 
If the stick handler passes the ball, drop to the level of the ball immediately 
and then adjust your position according to your check. You’re now in a posi-
tion to collapse, help, and rotate, especially from the top of the defense.
Moving before the ball
The final rule for positioning when defending against offensive players with-
out the ball is that the defense moves before the offense moves on any move-
ment of the ball.
 
Here are a few more tips for this type of individual defense:
 
✓ Never let a player lean on your stick without the ball. He can equalize 
pressure, giving himself the chance to catch the ball and score before 
you can adjust using your stick.
 
✓ Never let a player lean against you while cutting through the middle. 
He can neutralize your ability to use your body to stop a pass.
 
✓ Play your man to deny him the ball. Stay between him and the ball, not 
between him and the net.

 Chapter 7: Keeping the Ball out of the Goal: Developing Defensive Skills
Drills to Build Your Defensive Skills
The drills in this section can help you improve the skills you need to be a 
strong defensive player. You’ll be able to practice defending the stick handler 
and other offensive players, as well as develop the agility you need to suc-
cessfully defend the ball. From footwork to stick work to defensive stance, 
you can work on these drills alone or with teammates.
Developing defensive agility
These drills are designed to help you improve your footwork. The majority of 
defensive drills deal with lateral action, footwork, communication, and quick-
ness, all actions that are part of every successful defensive player’s reper-
toire. Remember to keep your drills short, quick, and hard.
 
✓ Footwork: More often than not, running on defense involves moving 
backward or sideways, rather than forward. An effective way to work 
on improving your footwork is running backward (say, the length of the 
field and back). While facing the sidelines, run sideways the length of the 
field, taking lateral steps and keeping your body low.
 
✓ Defensive steps: To develop some of the defensive steps you need for 
defensive situations, this drill focuses on repeating each step in order. 
Start with an advance step, move into the retreat step, and swing side-
ways with the shuffle. When working on this drill, make sure to keep 
your body low, as you would in a game situation.
 
✓ Reaction: This wave drill prepares you for game situations in which you 
need to react to a quickly passed ball or a cutting player. Working with a 
teammate or with your whole team, you react to the direction your part-
ner or coach waves to, simulating the movement of the ball, for example. 
You can alternate the steps you take with the reaction, using a shuffle 
step during one set or a slide step during another. Again, make sure that 
your knees are bent and you’re in the proper stance.
 
✓ Covering the defender: In this shadow drill, work with a teammate to 
practice following the movements of an offensive player. To do this, you 
just need to mirror the other player’s movements for 10 seconds, alter-
nating so that your partner can also work on his defensive skills. Work 
on this drill both with contact and without contact.
 
✓ Slide steps: This defensive slide drill asks you to do the slide step back 
and forth ten times within a 10-foot area, timing yourself so that you 
have a way to gauge your progress. Alternatively, you can practice this 
slide drill in 30-second time periods, counting how many times you can 
slide back and forth in the area before the 30-second period ends.

110
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
✓ Lateral movement: This defensive square drill works on lateral motion, 
agility, and quickness. Place four cones (or other objects) to mark a 
square. The distance between the cones should match the distance 
you would normally move in a game. Move laterally around the cones 
both clockwise and counterclockwise. Try going around the square four 
times, or time it for 20 seconds.
 
✓ Stopping and starting: Using the same square setup, this drill lets you 
practice for those game situations when you have to stop or start sud-
denly. Start in the middle of the square, run to a corner, backpedal to 
the middle, and go to another corner. Do this with all four corners. You 
can also sprint to the corner and sprint back to the middle or slide to 
the corner and slide back to the middle.
 
Ric Beardsley, a four-time all-American defenseman at Syracuse University 
who also played in Major League Lacrosse, offers some methods you can use 
to develop defensive agility:
 
✓ Stretch. The more flexible you are, the faster you’ll be and the stronger 
you can get. As a defenseman, your hips and lower back need to be flex-
ible for power.
 
✓ Work on drills. Drills are boring but essential. A good defenseman 
needs to know the basics — you’ll use the basics more than any other 
player on the field. So doing those boring drills and taking them seri-
ously will actually make you better.
 
✓ Work on postion-specific training. Training for your position in the 
workouts that you do outside of practice is the key to success. Run and 
practice using a 20-pound weight vest, do explosive squats, and jump 
rope for quick feet. Another trick is to play with a weighted stick — a 
stick filled with sand.
Drills for defending the stick handler
The drills in this section help you work on some of the skills discussed ear-
lier in this chapter for defending the stick handler.
1-on-1 defensive progression
This drill is best with the whole team broken into partners — one offensive 
and one defensive. The offensive players play token offense so that the defen-
sive players can work on defending different situations.
Here’s how it works:
 
1. The defender leans on the stick handler and experiences what hap-
pens when the offensive player steps backs or rolls.

111
 Chapter 7: Keeping the Ball out of the Goal: Developing Defensive Skills
 
2. While stationary, the stick handler leans into the defender and rolls to 
try to beat the defender.
 
3. The stick handler just stands and lets the defender check him, feeling 
what it’s like to hit and fill the gap created by the hit.
 
4. The stick handler fakes one way, with the defender reacting to catch 
up to the fake, and then the stick handler fakes the other way.
 
 This becomes a reaction drill for the defender.
 
5. The stick handler fakes a cut inside and then cuts outside and down.
 
 The defender hits and slides down to prevent the stick handler from 
beating him on the outside.
 
6. The stick handler fakes an outside cut and cuts inside.
 
 The defender hits and moves to prevent the stick handler from getting 
an inside position to go to the net.
 
7. The stick handler runs down the outside, and then stops and rolls 
back into middle for a shot.
 
 The defender works on his footwork to stop the stick handler from 
coming back.
 
8. The stick handler fakes a shot, and cuts outside and back in.
 
 The defender stays low, keeping his stick up to interfere with the shot, 
but he doesn’t stick-check.
1-on-1 closing-out drill
Run this drill with a teammate or with the whole team. Partners are spaced 5 
yards apart. One partner passes to other and closes out hard on him — that 
is, he follows the pass to his partner and takes his defensive stance, shuffling 
the last two steps. Then he moves back to his original position, and the part-
ner with the ball passes and closes out on him.
1-on-1 steal-the-ball drill
Two players go one-on-one against each other. The stick handler is trying to 
score, and the defender can only poke and wrap around to get the ball from 
the stick handler.
2-on-1 fight-through-pick drill
This drill uses three players: a defender, a stick handler, and another offen-
sive player. The defender plays the stick handler, while the second offensive 
player tries to set a pick on the defender. The drill is designed so that the 
defender can either step back or step up to work around the pick and get 
back to defending the stick handler.

112
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
For variation, use three offensive players with two trying to set picks for the 
stick handler, from either side or with double picks. The defender then has to 
fight through both picks.
Drills for defending other offensive players
The drills in this section help you work on some of the skills discussed ear-
lier in this chapter for defending other offensive players.
2-on-1 denying man on ball side or off-ball side
This drill uses three players: two offensive players and one defender. The 
defender covers one offensive player, while the other offensive player tries to 
pass to his offensive teammate. The defender takes a closed stance, belly to 
belly, to deny the pass away. Deny the pass from the same side of the field or 
floor or from the opposite side of the field or floor.
1-on-1 multiple defensive teaching drill
 
This progression drill for the box game works best with two coaches control-
ling the ball, and it stresses stance, positioning, and communication. When 
communicating, players should call out “cutter,” “help right,” or “pick right.” 
The defender starts on the side, defending an offensive player without the ball; 
the coaches set up on opposite sides of the floor, one with the ball.
Here’s how it works:
 
1. Positioned on the ball side, the defender denies the entry pass using a 
closed stance, close to the offensive player as he goes in and out to get 
in the clear for a pass from a coach or another teammate.
 
 One coach throws a cross-floor pass to the other coach.
 
2. Switching to the off-ball side, the defender denies the cross-floor pass 
using an open stance, following the offensive player as he moves up 
and down the sidelines trying to get into the clear for a pass.
 
3. The offensive player tries to cut in front of the defender to the ball 
while the defender yells “cutter” and takes away the cut.
 
4. The offensive player circles the net and then fakes a cut in front of 
the defender before cutting backdoor (behind the defender). The 
defender yells “cutter,” turns his back to the ball, and plays the cut-
ter’s stick hard with a slash.

113
 Chapter 7: Keeping the Ball out of the Goal: Developing Defensive Skills
 
5. After the cut, the offensive player circles the net and comes back to 
the cornerman’s spot, while the defender is playing between him and 
the ball.
 
6. On the off-ball side, the defender calls “help right” and helps on pen-
etration by the coach or other teammate with the ball and makes a 
quick recovery back to his check.
 
7. On the recovery following the help, the defender closes out on the 
pass back to his check by the coach.
 
8. Bring another offensive player into the drill, starting him in the crease 
before moving to set an up pick, where the offensive player picks the 
defender from behind, between the net and the defender.
 
9. The defender steps back and plays the picker as he rolls or slides 
down to the net for a pass.
 
10. The stick handler cuts outside down the sidelines while the picker 
runs back to the top for a return pass from the stick handler, who is 
now in the crease area.
 
11. The defender defends the cross pick-and-roll on the ball by stepping 
back and playing the picker rolling to the net while the stick handler 
makes a cut across the top to pass down to the picker.
 
12. After his cut to the net, the picker goes to the crease position to 
receive a down pass and the defender defends a down pick-and-roll 
by stepping back on the pick and switching to the picker.
 
13. Another defensive player calls out “pick right” and the stick handler 
comes out of the pick and then runs the ball back down into the 
corner area while the defender follows his check to the top.
 
 The defender is now in the top area and his check is going to set a 
screen for the stick handler in the corner area.
 
14. The defender fights off the screen to get position between his check 
and the ball. When the stick handler comes off the screen, the 
defender comes out from the side or goes around the screen and 
comes out on the net side to switch and check him.
 
 The defender is now on the stick handler who backpedals to the top to 
finally go one-on-one.

Goaltending
In This Chapter
▶ Assessing who has the right stuff
▶ Picking up the goaltending basics
▶ Making saves
▶ Starting the offense
▶ Communicating with your defense
T
he most important task of a goaltender is to stop the ball from getting 
into the net. How to do that is what this chapter is all about.
Unfortunately, some coaches leave goaltenders on their own to learn how to 
play the position through trial and error. Practice sessions in which the goal-
tender is simply someone to shoot at rather than a vital team member who 
needs coaching also don’t help.
The fact is, the goaltender position may be the most complex one on the 
field. It requires a wide variety of attributes, such as quick reflexes, an even-
keeled temperament, poise, athleticism, communication skills, and leader-
ship qualities.
In this chapter, we take a look at the skills necessary to be a standout goal-
tender and tell you how you can become a better goalie. We also examine 
some of the attributes found among the game’s best goalies.

116
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Recognizing What It Takes 
to Play in Goal
No doubt about it, goaltender is a glamorous position in both hockey and 
soccer. One of the primary reasons why goalies get so much attention in 
those sports is that they have many opportunities to put up some impressive 
numbers, such as saves and shutouts. You wouldn’t see hockey or soccer 
goaltenders gain that type of notoriety if they allowed 14 goals a game.
But allowing double-figure goals is a regular occurrence for a lacrosse goalie. 
So, to be a successful goalie in lacrosse, you need to recognize that you’re 
going to get scored upon.
The most successful goalies are the ones who have the ability to bounce 
back and make a big save after letting in a goal. But there are other attributes 
essential to playing the position effectively. We explore them in this section.
Focus
A good lacrosse goalie should have the ability to stay focused during a game. 
Face it, your mind has a tendency to wander no matter what you may be 
doing. Keeping yourself mentally in the game at all times is important.
Being a goalie doesn’t reward a wandering mind. You have to keep your eye 
on the ball no matter how many offensive players run in front of you, how 
Seeing it from both sides
Ethan Vedder has seen the game from both 
sides. Vedder, an all-American goaltender for 
the nationally renowned Yorktown boys lacrosse 
program in New York, went on to become one 
of the nation’s best long-stick midfielders during 
his college career at Cornell University.
He says that his experience as a goaltender 
helped him see the goaltender position in a dif-
ferent light: “When you’re in goal, you see the 
whole field, so, many times, you realize where 
defenders should be before they do. But when 
you’re actually out in the field, you don’t have 
that advantage.”
Having excelled both in goal and in the field, 
Vedder says that, no matter what position 
you’re playing, communication and teamwork 
are critical to enjoying success.

117
 Chapter 8: Goaltending
many picks and screens take place off to your side, or how many fans are 
constantly chanting from the stands.
Desire
Being a goaltender requires a special type of personality. You must not only 
want to take on the role of being the last line of defense, but thrive on it. This 
means that you’ll be under the microscope. When a goal is scored, you’ll 
be the one people see holding your stick at your side in front of the net. But 
when you make a big save, that can change the momentum of a game and 
you’ll be the one people see as sparking the team.
Being a goaltender involves all kinds of mental and emotional peaks and val-
leys. There are also plenty of physical challenges. After all, you’ll be getting 
routinely hit with a hard rubber ball coming at you at eye-popping speeds.
Stick-to-itiveness
Many players are comfortable and confident when things are going well. In 
order to be an effective goaltender, you must display those traits when things 
aren’t going your way. After all, if you get down or rattled after allowing a goal 
or two, there’s a good chance the other team will capitalize by scoring even 
more goals. You need to shake off goals when you allow them, and look for-
ward, not back.
 
When the game is over, you can analyze what occurred that allowed the goal 
to be scored. But during the game, concentrate on preventing the next goal 
from being scored.
Communication
As goaltender, you’re the captain of the defense. Only you can see the entire 
defensive zone — including who is playing where and how the offense is 
maneuvering. Your defensemen are too busy guarding their opposing play-
ers to be able to get this vantage point. So, make the most of this advantage. 
Shout out help to them early and often. Also, be supportive of your team-
mates when they may be responsible for a player getting in position to score. 
Giving them that support could very well give them the confidence they need 
to prevent another similar play from occurring.

118
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
The Basics of Goaltending
Goaltending can be broken down into six basic tasks:
 
✓ Staying in your ready stance for the shot and forming an arc
 
✓ Staying centered
 
✓ Following the ball, using your eyes and your body
 
✓ Challenging the shooter
 
✓ Communicating with the defense
 
✓ Anticipating what’s going to happen as the play evolves
We cover each of these points in greater detail in the following sections.
Where it all starts: The ready stance
As a goalie, you have to take a stance, the ready stance. You have to be bal-
anced and relaxed so that you’re ready to react quickly forward, backward, 
and sideways.
Take a crouching position with your knees bent, back straight, and shoulders 
and chest square to the ball — that is, with your body on the goal line facing 
the ball.
How playing goalie differs in box lacrosse
Goaltending in box lacrosse is a whole different 
animal in many ways. With so much less space 
to cover in goal (4 feet wide and 4 feet high), the 
body is the most important tool for box lacrosse 
goalies when it comes to making saves.
But that isn’t the only difference between field 
and box goalies: Unlike field goalies, box goal-
ies stand with the stick of the head on the floor, 
as opposed to keeping the head of the stick 
upright.
One-on-one breakaways, which are rare in 
field lacrosse, are common in box lacrosse. But 
box lacrosse goalies don’t have to worry about 
players setting up plays behind the net as they 
do in field lacrosse, where there is 15 yards 
between the goal and end line.
Despite the smaller size of the goals, box 
lacrosse generally has more scoring than field 
lacrosse, where scores average around 20 
goals combined per game, while impressive 
save percentages for NCAA goalies average in 
the mid-60s. Shutouts are almost unheard of in 
box lacrosse. This is because scoring overall is 
higher in box lacrosse.

119
 Chapter 8: Goaltending
Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, and your body weight should 
be on the balls of your feet. Hold the stick upright, with very little space 
between the net of the stick and your helmet.
 
The goalie should make his own imaginary semicircle, or arc. This is an area in 
the middle that stretches roughly 2 feet from the goal line and uses the goal-
posts as a reference point. Forming this arc helps the goalie be in position to 
make saves on shots that arrive at both the left and right of the goalie at vary-
ing angles and heights. All movement should be started from this centering 
position.
 
Another key for a goalie is hand positioning. The goalie’s top hand should be 
on the throat of the stick, with the bottom hand toward the middle. The dis-
tance between the hands should be about the length of your waistline.
Staying centered
Position yourself a step above the goal line in the center of the net — that is, 
between the goal posts. This center position gives you the best flexibility to 
move your body with the ball.
Just as you need to stay centered physically, you need to stay centered 
mentally. “Lacrosse is a head game,” says former Yorktown (New York) High 
School all-American goaltender and Cornell University standout long-stick 
midfielder Ethan Vedder. “You’ll either win it or lose it. You can do a lot as a 
goalie before even facing a shot in terms of organizing your defense, putting 
your body in the right position, and knowing where the offense is going to 
shoot from and how you’re going to react to it.”
Following the ball
Because your primary task as goalie is to allow as few goals to be scored as 
possible, you need to make every effort to know where the ball is at all times, 
even when it’s behind you.
Knowing where the ball is involves more than just keeping your eye on the 
ball. You need to follow the ball with your body as well. Following the ball 
with your body involves moving your body when the ball moves, keeping it 
square to the ball in the shooter’s stick. When the ball swings to your right 
side, swing your body to the right, keeping it parallel between the ball and 
the net.

120
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Following the ball is especially important because, often, the play will be 
behind you — in the 15-yard area behind each goal — not in front of you. 
Much of a team’s offense flows through this 15-yard space, and you have to 
actually turn around completely so that you face the goal to watch the ball. 
Then, when the ball swings to the front, you should take a couple extra steps 
out to slice a shooter’s angle.
You also have to negotiate a large area when clearing the ball. After pos-
session is gained, according to the college rules a team has 20 seconds to 
advance past the restraining line (35 yards from the end line) and out of its 
defensive end.
Attackmen don’t sprint away after possession is lost. They stick around to 
help scramble your effort to clear the ball out of the defensive end. This 
means that you need to be athletic enough to run around and coordinated 
enough to handle the ball in the open field.
 
Keep your eye on the ball, following it around the playing area. And you not 
only want to follow the ball on a shot on goal but also as it’s passed around 
from player to player.
Challenging the shooter
As the goalie, you need to move out one or two steps from the goal line to 
challenge the shooter. You’re not likely to be a successful goalie if you’re 
looking at the position as one of comfort, waiting around for the occasional 
Working on your stick saves
If you arrive at any high school lacrosse venue 
a half-hour or so before game time, you’re 
sure to see a coach or player warming up the 
goalie while the rest of the team does pre-game 
warm-ups and drills. This activity may look lei-
surely, but it’s not. The goalie must treat every 
shot as if it’s in an actual game situation and 
make his best effort to stop each shot.
Whoever warms up the goalie should start with 
an array of either low or high shots and then 
switch off. Then he should shoot some bounce 
shots as well, or mix in the bounce shots in 
between the assortment of high and low shots.
The following drills are designed to help you 
work on your stick saves:
 ✓ For long, low shots: A semicircle of shoot-
ers shoots long, low shots. Focus on moving 
the stick to the ball with your body backing 
up the stick.
 ✓ For mid-waist shots: A semicircle of play-
ers shoots mid-waist shots. Use only your 
stick to stop shots.
 ✓ For bounce shots: A semicircle of players 
shoot bounce shots to any target in the net. 
Use only your stick to stop shots.

121
 Chapter 8: Goaltending
shot. By moving out from the goal line, you also cut down the available 
angles and space for your opponent to place the ball.
Playing in goal requires you to challenge the shooter so that he’s more likely 
to rush a shot and send it off-line or decide not to shoot at all.
 
How far out you move depends on how far away the shooter is, who’s shoot-
ing, and how big you are. You have to test your positioning to find the perfect 
spot that reduces your opponent’s shooting area. Generally, though, three 
steps out, or at the top of the crease, is a bit much, unless the shooter is way 
out and definitely shooting. If you’re that far out in the crease and the shooter 
fakes a shot, he can easily attack and put the ball over your shoulder.
The biggest problem for goaltenders is getting caught moving out when the 
shot is taken. When you move out, you can’t move laterally. If the shooter 
picks his shot, he’ll score.
When you do step out, remember that recovery is just as important as 
coming out. As the ball moves from side to side, shuffle your feet by taking 
small sidesteps and keep your stick on the ground.
If the ball is passed down low in the zone, retreat by stepping back and to the 
post. If the ball is passed up high, step out to challenge.
 
Coaches can run these drills for three distinct save styles:
 
✓ Soft toss. From a distance of about 6 feet away, the coach tosses the ball 
to the goalie, who does not use a stick. As a result, the goalie will catch 
the ball with his top hand. The coach tosses the ball to all areas around 
the goal area in order to simulate the variety of saves that a goalie will 
have to make in the course of a game.
 
✓ The goalie steps to the ball. Players take controlled shots so that the 
goalie can work on his technique and positioning.
 
✓ The goalie stays back in his net for reflexive saves. Players take rapid-
fire shots so that the goalie can work on his reflexes and quickness.
 
✓ The goalie takes a step out for angle saves. The coach calls out, at 
random, the types of shots for players to take: 
 
• Long, top-corner shots
 
• Long, bottom-corner shots
 
• Long shots directed at the mid-waist
 
• Long bounce shots for top corner
 
• Long bounce shots for mid-waist
 
• Close-in shots, without a fake
 
• Close-in shots with one strong fake

Do a progression as the goalie warms up. For example, many goalies prefer to 
start stick-side high for shot/hard pass placement then work to non-stick-side 
high. Next would be stick-side waist high, follow by non-stick side waist high, 
and work your way down to low and eventually bounce shots. A total of about 
two minutes should be spent on each area.
 
The step out can be a good strategy for goalies in defending against the 
breakaway — that is, when an offensive player breaks away from the rest of 
the players on the floor and anticipates a one-on-one opportunity against the 
goalie.
Communicating with the defense
A shy goaltender is not an effective goaltender. You need to speak out 
throughout the game, calling out assignments and helping your defensemen 
know where to be. You also need to be consistent in the specific words you 
use so that your defensemen understand and quickly identify whatever lingo 
your team is familiar with.
Don’t bite on the fake
As a goaltender, you’re sure to see your share 
of stick fakes. In fact, you’re likely to see stick 
fakes of stick fakes, before yet another stick 
fake that leads to a shot.
The idea, of course, is that the shooter wants 
you to move in one direction to block a shot 
that he fakes so that he can score on a shot 
the other way. Not only does a successful stick 
fake lead to a goal for the other team, but it can 
also make even the best goalies look a little silly.
You can do a couple of things to protect against 
the fake:
 ✓ Practice patience. If you can wait out a 
shooter’s stick fakes, you’re more likely 
to be able to react effectively against the 
shooter’s actual shot.
 ✓ Follow the shooter’s stick, not his or her 
body movements. Don’t look at head fakes, 
look for the ball. And if the player hides or 
drops his or her stick, react to it as soon as 
it’s visible again.
Actual practice may not help against stick fakes 
as much as knowing your opponents’ tenden-
cies. Knowing which shooters are more likely 
to try a stick fake, and which shooters are more 
likely to just shoot away, will help you be the 
most effective against stick fakes.
Bob Watson of the Toronto Rock, two-time 
National Lacrosse League goaltender of the 
year, says about playing the stick fake: “When 
you see a stick fake, you must stay square to 
the shooter’s stick and rely on your angles. 
Have patience and don’t overreact. Let the 
shooter make the first move.”

123
 Chapter 8: Goaltending
Anticipating what’s going to happen next
A vital part of what you need to do as a goaltender is to look ahead. You need 
to be aware of the tendencies of the other team’s shooters. For example, if an 
opposing attackman is weak with his right hand and is controlling the ball with 
his right hand under heavy pressure, he probably won’t shoot, so look for him 
to pass it off. Conversely, if a strong right-handed shooter makes a clean catch 
with his right hand in a position to shoot, be ready to try to stop his best shot.
Making the Reflex Save
The reflexive part of goaltending relies on your athletic ability to get your 
body in front of shots. No matter how much you’re able to cut down on the 
angle that a shooter may have on goal, you still have to move laterally or step 
sideways to make saves, whether it’s with your stick or your body.
 
Beginning goalies have a tendency to turn their body on a shot so that the 
ball hits their sides or their backs. Coaches can help them build confidence 
by using tennis balls in shooting drills so that goalies know that they can’t get 
hurt and are well protected.
The Goalie on Offense
The goaltender plays a key role in a team’s offense, primarily by starting the 
offense following a stopped shot. A crisp, accurate clearing pass can set the 
offense off on a fast break.
Talking it up
According to Ethan Vedder, as a goaltender, the 
six teammates in front of you in your zone are 
your six best friends. That means you’re hard 
on them at times, but always supportive. And, 
like any good friendship, communication is vital.
“You’re sitting in the middle of it all and you 
have the luxury of seeing what’s happening as it 
unfolds,” Vedder said. “They have other tasks, 
so you need to help them get in the right posi-
tion as much as possible.”
That means communicating, often in a forceful 
way. You shouldn’t order around your defen-
sive players — you just want to instruct them 
quickly and forcefully as far as positioning goes. 
After all, a split second may be the difference 
between a goal and a save. Often, the differ-
ence between a good goalie and a great goalie 
is communication and vocal leadership.

124
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
When you’re inside the crease, defenders may not make contact with you. 
But you’re fair game when you’re out of the crease. This means you can get 
hit by opposing defenders. It also means that, not only can you set up the 
fast break, but you can start it. At times, opposing players are so surprised to 
see the goalie ranging beyond midfield on a clear that they fail to defend him. 
On more than one occasion, this has led to the goaltender accomplishing the 
ultimate of rarities — scoring a goal.
Making the angle save
Because of the confined space in box lacrosse, 
it’s important that goaltenders play the angles as 
best they can to prevent opposing shooters from 
having a large amount of the net area to target.
The angle part of goaltending involves getting 
good body positioning, being in the right place 
at the right time, stepping out and cutting down 
with the body some of the open areas of the net to 
shoot at. As a goalie, you want to be out and set in 
a ready stance before the shot is taken. You have 
to know how to play angles to stop shots.
Here are a few drills to help you develop your 
angle-save skills:
 ✓ Form a triangle with a rope attached to 
you and to both posts. Learn to stay in the 
center of the posts — that is, in the middle 
of the net.
 ✓ Find an ideal spot against shooter. The 
shooter takes a position within good scor-
ing range and shoots at you. If he scores, 
he tells you to move slightly over because 
you’re giving him too much to shoot at.
 ✓ Five players spread out on the floor just to 
pass ball the around quickly. They shoot at 
you quickly and randomly.

Chapter 9
The Possession Game
In This Chapter
▶ Everything you need to know about faceoffs
▶ Understanding why ground balls are so important
▶ Focusing on rides and clears
Y
ou can’t score if you don’t have the ball. That’s why there are few — if 
any — things more important in lacrosse than getting and maintaining 
possession. This chapter takes a look at ways to do it.
The first way — the faceoff — is probably the most important. The faceoff 
determines who gets the ball at the beginning of the game, at the start of 
each subsequent quarter, and following each goal. If a team can dominate in 
the faceoff X (the area at midfield in which faceoffs are held), it can make up 
for deficiencies in many other areas. Faceoffs can also help a team trailing by 
several goals late in a game get right back in the game — and possibly even 
pull out the win.
Another way to get possession occurs when neither team has gained control 
of a ground ball. The team that successfully winds up scooping it up could 
wind up giving itself a big shift in momentum as well.
In this chapter, we also take a look at two areas that are often overlooked in 
the possession game:
 
✓ Rides: A ride occurs when the defensive team tries to prevent the team 
with possession from advancing the ball from its defensive end to the 
offensive zone.
 
✓ Clears: A clear occurs when the ball moves from the defensive half of 
the field into the offensive zone.

126
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
The Art of the Faceoff
Throughout this book, we mention that lacrosse is similar to hockey, basket-
ball, and football. But there’s another sport lacrosse is similar to: wrestling. 
Wrestling? Yes, wrestling. At least one aspect of lacrosse is very similar to 
wrestling — and it also happens to be one of the most important aspects of 
the sport: the faceoff.
Faceoffs, which often resemble a wrestling match for control of the ball, are 
held at the start of each game, the start of each subsequent quarter, and after 
a goal is scored. Because of this rule, lacrosse is one of the few sports where 
you can score and then get the ball right back — possession doesn’t auto-
matically shift to the opposing team the way it does with, say, basketball and 
football.
 
Faceoffs are such a vital part of the game that many teams have players who 
specialize in faceoffs. After possession is decided, those players sprint right 
off the field. In the sport, they’re known as FOGOs (which stands for face off, 
get off). Even though FOGOs may not be on the field when goals are scored, 
they’re often the most responsible for goals because they win the faceoffs that 
lead to the possessions during which goals are scored.
 
Michael Bartomioli, a midfielder on the University of Michigan’s 2009 Men’s 
Collegiate Club Lacrosse Association national championship team, says that 
the trend toward specialization in sports has been especially prevalent for 
lacrosse in the faceoff X. “Facing off becomes almost like a chess game — 
faceoff guys have become so skilled,” said Bartomioli. “When players can con-
centrate solely on facing off, they can master a number of different moves.”
X marks the spot
All the action occurs in the faceoff X, or the area right at midfield in which 
the faceoffs are conducted. After the official rests the ball in the middle of 
the centerline, two opposing players position themselves parallel to the line 
and as close to the line as possible without crossing it. They squat into their 
stances, with their elbows inside their knees and their backsides slanted 
toward the ball and facing the side of the field their goal is on (as shown in 
Figure 9-1).

127
 Chapter 9: The Possession Game
Drawing instead of facing off
The women’s lacrosse equivalent of the faceoff 
is called a draw. Like faceoffs, draws occur at 
the beginning of the game, at the beginning of 
each subsequent half, and after each score. 
Draws begin between two players who stand 
facing one another with their sticks held hori-
zontally and their feet about shoulder-width 
apart, with one foot toeing the center line. Any 
player may take the draw, and a maximum 
of five players may be positioned on the field 
either on the center circle or between the two 
restraining lines during a draw. All other field 
players must be below the restraining line.
The heads, or crosses, of their sticks’ faces are 
held back-to-back, hip-level in the air over the 
centerline. Each player’s stick is between the 
ball and the goal she’s defending. The backs 
of the crosses are lined up against each other 
with the bottoms of each crosse parallel, and 
the ball is placed by the official between the 
two crosses. A player taking the draw must not 
have either hand near the crosse of the stick 
or the ball when preparing to take the draw. 
On the word ready, the official signals the two 
players taking the draw to remain motionless. 
Then, after a whistle is blown, both players 
draw their crosses up and away from the other, 
in an attempt to get the ball to a teammate or 
to themselves. The ball is required to go above 
the head level of both players taking the draw.

Most players prefer to use short sticks rather than long sticks for faceoffs, 
because short sticks offer better control.
After the official blows his whistle to start play, the battle begins. That’s when 
timing and technique — two of the most critical aspects to success — come in.
Also of vital importance are the faceoff man’s two teammates perched in the 
wing areas. Oftentimes, a faceoff isn’t won cleanly by either player; instead, 
the ball is jarred loose and one of the charging wing players scoops it up.
 
The wings may go after the ball as soon as the whistle sounds. Other players 
have to wait until the ball goes over the defensive-area line or either team 
gains possession.
Techniques of the trade
Faceoff specialists use a variety of techniques. We cover the most common 
ones in the following sections.

129
 Chapter 9: The Possession Game
 
✓ Clamp: The clamp is probably the most popular grip. Here, the player 
places the back of the head of the stick over the ball before trying to pull 
the ball back toward him.
 
✓ Jump: In a jump, the player traps the ball with the face of the stick head, 
rather than the back of the stick head. A jump is basically a reverse 
clamp.
 
✓ Rake: In the rake, the player sweeps his stick like a rake to get the ball to 
one of his wing players.
 
✓ Plunger: Similar to the clamp, in the plunger, the player places the back 
of the stick head over the ball. Then he lifts his back hand while apply-
ing pressure with his front hand, pinching the ball with the stick head to 
allow him to control the ball and pull it around his opponent. If he pulls 
the ball around his opponent, this often leads to a fast break.
 
✓ Double over: In the double over, both hands face downward (allowing 
for more power) and are positioned high on the stick. The double over 
is also known as a motorcycle grip. This grip is the one used by former 
University of Delaware star Alex Smith. (For more on Alex, see the 
nearby sidebar, “Faceoff star, final four.”)
 
✓ Push: In the push, the player pushes the head of the stick forward as the 
top sidewall is facing toward him so that the ball moves forward, behind 
the opposing faceoff player, where it can be scooped up by either the 
faceoff player himself or a wingman, often leading to a fast break.
Faceoff fundamentals
The concepts and strategies for faceoffs are similar in both field and box 
lacrosse. The goal is for the player facing off to either pull the ball and collect 
it himself or push it toward a teammate. Players in the wing area should be 
the team’s fastest players and the players most adept at picking up the ball 
off the ground.
Faceoff star, final four
Winning a flurry of faceoffs often allows teams 
to overcome late-game deficits that may 
have seemed insurmountable. It can also lift 
programs to new heights. Case in point: the 
University of Delaware, whose unlikely run to 
its first Division I semifinal appearance in 2007 
would not have been possible without Alex 
Smith, who rewrote NCAA faceoff records. 
(Smith won nearly 70 percent of his faceoffs in 
his college career.) Prior to the 2007 season, 
Delaware had won just one postseason game 
in its history.

130
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
Here are some specific faceoff tips:
 
✓ Line up as close to the ball as you can.
 
✓ Be consistent in the way you grip the stick for each faceoff, so you can 
refine and improve your technique.
 
✓ Keep weight off your hands when lining up for the faceoff, so you can 
quickly move to an upright position while maintaining balance.
Getting the edge on the faceoff
During a faceoff in box lacrosse, you need to 
out-loose-ball the other team, each player out-
fighting the player beside him for possession. 
This may sound easy, but it takes team effort, 
not just one good faceoff player. Here are 
some tips to help your team improve its faceoff 
success:
 ✓ Get the jump on the opposition. Try to 
anticipate when the referee will blow the 
whistle. You don’t want to leave early, just 
before the whistle, even though refs don’t 
always call this violation. But try to pick up 
on some of the referee’s quirks — what 
he does just before he blows the whistle. 
Some players count from the time the ref-
eree leaves the small circle until he blows 
his whistle, hoping to pick up a pattern.
 ✓ Attack all loose balls. On most faceoffs, 
the ball comes loose, so players have to 
be ready to battle for the loose ball. You 
need tough players on the faceoff unit — 
quick, big, not afraid to get hit — and good 
stick handlers who can pick up the ball in a 
crowd. If the opposition gets to the ball first, 
players shouldn’t back off. Play your oppo-
nent’s stick hard to stop him from picking 
it up or bang him into the boards. Coaches 
should send two players after every loose 
ball.
 ✓ Line up on the opponent’s stick side. If you 
line up in this way, you can interfere with 
your opponent’s stick.
 ✓ Protect the ball. You want your team to use 
their bodies to protect the ball and keep 
both hands on the stick. Don’t pick up the 
ball with just one hand on an exposed stick.
 ✓ Back each other up on loose balls. On a 
loose ball, the defender on the ball side 
moves in for the loose ball, while the other 
defender balances the floor by going back 
on defense. The offensive forward (crease-
man) also cheats on the line and can be 
extra-aggressive, because he doesn’t have 
to worry about being scored on while the off-
ball forward (creaseman) goes back to the 
middle or even farther back, depending on 
the situation, to balance the floor defensively.
In the National Lacrosse League (NLL), all cen-
termen, who are assigned to take faceoffs, are 
right-hand shots because they have to stay 
on their own side of the centerline. A center-
man can grip only the shaft of the stick; he isn’t 
allowed to touch the plastic head of his stick.

131
 Chapter 9: The Possession Game
Each faceoff midfielder has his own technique that works especially well for 
him. Matt Witko, one of the leading players at Tufts University, distinguished 
himself as one of the premier faceoff specialists in the lacrosse hotbed of 
New York’s Hudson Valley during his playing days at Horace Greeley High 
School in Chappaqua. Here are some tips from Matt on how to improve your 
faceoff technique:
 
✓ Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart, with both feet facing 
the ball. You want to be comfortable in your stance, while at the same 
time being able to explode in either direction in order to get to the ball, 
and this stance allows you to do exactly that. Being in the right position 
to start is the most crucial part of facing off.
 
✓ Be quick. Timing is everything in facing off. The best faceoff players have 
the quickest hands. When you go out on the field for the opening draw, 
you should know what move you’re going to do and do it confidently.
 
 Make sure you’re always on the “front side” of the whistle. If you’re too 
early, it’s a violation. But if you’re too late, you almost certainly will lose 
the faceoff.
 
✓ Know your opponent. After the opening faceoff, you should have a good 
idea of what you’re up against and what your opponent’s go-to move is. 
Use this information to your advantage. Knowing what he can do allows 
you to counter his move.
 
 You have an array of moves at your disposal, from the plunger to the rake 
to the jump, all of which work well. The best faceoff men can do all of them, 
but being really good at one is often better than being average at a few.
 
✓ Pay attention to footwork. Footwork, such as stepping toward the ball 
or stepping upfield (toward the opponent’s goal), is a big part of your 
move. Use your feet and your eyes to be a great faceoff player. Once pos-
session is gained, footwork is key in creating a scoring opportunity.
 
✓ Work with your teammates to get possession. The part of the faceoff 
after the draw is won separates the best faceoff players from the rest. 
Being able to control the ball and read the situation is one of the hardest 
skills to pick up and only comes with a lot of practice. Winning the draw 
is half the battle — getting possession is the hardest part. A great faceoff 
specialist works with his wings to get possession of the ball.
 
✓ Be confident. Many faceoff players don’t have confidence with the ball — 
they do well in the faceoff, but when they have possession of the ball, 
they struggle with getting it into the offensive zone. As a result, teams 
often scheme to put a long-stick midfieldman on the faceoff player after 
he picks up the ball. Have confidence in your own stick skills. Be an 
athlete and run the ball into the box. Always be a threat to score — if a 
team doesn’t slide to you, don’t be afraid to shoot.

132
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Ground-Ball Wars
Faceoffs are critical when it comes to the possession game, but there is no 
area in lacrosse in which possessions are decided as frequently as ground 
balls. A ground ball, as the name suggests, occurs when a player scoops a ball 
up off the ground (as shown in Figure 9-2). It may sound simple, but as you’ll 
see, it’s anything but.
The importance of ground balls is unquestionable. Because they determine 
possession and because of their frequency, ground balls are arguably as 
important as any other aspect of the game — maybe more so. In fact, it’s 
not too much of a stretch to say that ground balls are the key to victory. If 
your team outplays your opponent in collecting ground balls, there’s a good 
chance it will win the game.
 
Ground balls may be even more important at youth levels than at the more 
advanced levels, because younger players’ stick skills are not as advanced, so 
ground balls occur much more frequently.

 Chapter 9: The Possession Game
 
In box lacrosse, ground balls are known as loose balls — and they’re every bit 
as important.
When ground balls happen
Here are a few of the game situations during which ground balls become 
available:
 
✓ When recovering a rebound off a missed shot
 
✓ When stealing the ball from the stick handler
 
✓ When forcing the opposition to take a bad shot
 
✓ When forcing the opposition to make a bad pass
 
✓ On any faceoff
 
Trying for the ground ball in these situations and actually gaining possession 
of it are two very different matters.
How to make a ground ball yours
 
Determination, anticipation, and hustle are the three most important attri-
butes when it comes to getting ground balls. But some important technique is 
involved, too. In order to be effective at getting ground balls, you need to prac-
tice them diligently and frequently — like any other lacrosse skill.
It all starts with anticipation. You have to believe that every possession is 
going to end up with a ground ball. That means anticipating how you’re going 
to get to the ball area as quickly and effectively as possible if the player 
you’re guarding is not the one with the ball.
Next, you want to think about your approach to the ball. Bend your knees, 
stay low, keep a wide stance, and bend over to protect the ball. You should 
always have two hands on the stick, with your top hand near the throat and 
your bottom hand at the butt or end of the stick. And remember to keep this 
butt end low to the field or floor to make it easier to scoop through the ball.
When it comes to actually picking up the ground ball, you have a few moves 
to choose from:
 
✓ Scoop pickup: The scoop pickup is probably the most common pickup 
in lacrosse because it’s so fast and simple. Aim for the area just behind 
where the ball is so that you can scoop the ball through in a motion 
somewhat similar to the one you use when shoveling snow. When you 
get the ball into your stick, make sure that you protect the stick by 

134
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
pulling it in close to your body and then start to cradle immediately, to 
make sure that you have the ball.
 
✓ Trap and scoop: Cover the ball with your pocket and then scoop up the 
ball.
 
✓ Indian pickup: The politically incorrect name Indian pickup refers to plac-
ing the backside of the head of your stick over the ball and knocking the 
ball with the side of the frame while turning the head of your stick over.
 
You probably won’t have time to try the fancier, less-effective moves of trap 
and scoop and Indian pickup, so focus your attention on the scoop pickup.
When you go after a ground ball with an opponent beside you, get your body 
between the ball and your opponent. With this positioning, you can use your 
body to shield the ball from your opponent while you pick it up.
After you get in front of your opponent, you may want to slow down a bit, 
maybe even backing up slightly so that you can prevent him from slashing at 
your stick as you try to pick up the ground ball.
 
The way you approach going after a ground ball could be the difference of two 
goals — a possible goal for your team and a possible goal for the opposition — 
so don’t take it casually. You want to attack ground balls aggressively instead 
of waiting for them to come to you. Attacking versus watching makes all the 
difference.
 
Don’t be the only player to go after a ground ball. Your team stands a better 
chance of picking up a ground ball if you’re consistently meeting one or more 
of your teammates at the ball. By outnumbering your opponent, you can more 
easily gain possession of the ground ball. Plus, with two or three teammates 
around a ground ball, you may be able to use one or two players to fend off 
opposing players so that the best stick handler can pick up the ground ball 
and do something with it.
 
Coaches need to have their players practice a wide variety of ground-ball situ-
ations. Some of these situations — including ground balls toward the sideline 
and ground balls toward the end line, for example — require different tech-
niques. A basic ground-ball drill is to have two players line up hip to hip, and 
then roll the ball out.
Wall ball (when a player practices individually by throwing and catching a 
ball against a wall) is not only good for honing your shooting technique. You 
can also use it to work on your ground-ball skills, too. Just throw the ball 
against the wall hard and low, and scoop it up.
 
All ground-ball drills should include a pass so that players can work on getting 
the ball out of danger and igniting their offense.

135
 Chapter 9: The Possession Game
What to do after you gain possession
After you get possession of the ground ball, you have a few options as far as 
what to do next:
 
✓ You can tuck the ball into your body to protect the ball.
 
✓ You can pass the ball back to your goalie, if you’re in your own defen-
sive zone.
 
✓ You can pass the ball to the closest available teammate.
If you can’t pick up the ball, knock it back to your goalie or to a teammate.
Riding High
A ride is a play that aims to prevent the team with possession of the ball 
from advancing the ball from the team’s defensive end to the offensive zone. 
Ground-ball tips from an all-American
Brian Dalton, a former all-American midfielder 
at Springfield College in Massachusetts, who is 
now an assistant coach at St. John’s University 
in New York City, offers some tips on getting 
ground balls:
 ✓ Box out your opponent. When you see that 
the ball is on the ground, get in front of the 
opposing player or players who are also in 
pursuit, and position your body between the 
ball and them. Then quickly get as low and 
wide to the ground as you can to prevent 
them from picking up the ground ball before 
you do.
 ✓ Get as low as possible. Position both your 
body and the butt end of your stick low to 
the ground.
 ✓ Use two hands. Unless you’re in an awk-
ward position and have no choice but to 
take a stab at the ball with one hand, use 
two hands. Then scoop the ball through and 
bring it up toward your face mask.
 ✓ Find an opening. Spring to explode to an 
open spot on the field as soon as you have 
possession. Within 2 seconds of getting the 
ground ball, get the ball moving.
 ✓ Create transition. You got the ground ball — 
now capitalize on it. Look to create a tran-
sition opportunity for your team. That will 
likely mean passing the ball to a teammate 
(preferably a short stick) who is open and 
in position to advance the ball. Try to outlet 
the ball within 5 to 10 seconds of coming 
away with the ground ball.
 ✓ Umbrella the ball. The most effective way 
to create a fast-break opportunity is for the 
wing players to get to either side of their 
teammate who just picked up the ground 
ball — with one on the left side and one on 
the right side of the player with possession.

136
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Because the ride starts in the defensive end, the defending team’s attackmen, 
who are stationed in the offensive zone, are the key players to effectively 
execute rides.
One of the unique aspects of lacrosse is that the most talented offensive 
players on the field quickly transition to key defensive players in a matter of 
seconds. In fact, one of the most effective riding attackmen in recent years at 
the collegiate level was also one of the game’s premier offensive stars: former 
Syracuse star Casey Powell.
The most effective riders are players with quickness, athleticism, and agility 
(traits often more common in midfielders than in attackmen). Because the 
attackmen are the most crucial riders, some may be lacking in one or more of 
those areas, but they can make up for it with stick-to-itiveness.
Why rides matter
Rides allow a team the opportunity to get the ball back as soon as it loses 
possession — whether on a shot on goal or on a turnover. If effective, rides can 
lead not only to changes in possession, but also to huge momentum shifts.
Teams that invest a lot of time, effort, and energy into riding are almost 
always rewarded for it. Strong riding often allows teams with inferior talent to 
stay in games. Think of rides as a key x factor that could very well determine 
the outcome of a game.
The most effective ride techniques
In order for rides to be effective, the attacking team has to transition to a 
defensive team that works together to prevent the offense from clearing the 
ball in just a few seconds.
After the offensive team becomes a riding team, it needs to be mindful of the 
following:
 
✓ Cover the deep guys. The clearing team will look to outlet the ball. If the 
deep players are well guarded, their first option will be eliminated.
 
✓ Make up for your shortcomings. Because of the presence of the goalie, 
the clearing team will always have a one-player advantage. Make up for 
it with aggressive play right away.
 
✓ Know who to cover. Applying pressure on the player with the ball right 
away is the main priority.

137
 Chapter 9: The Possession Game
 
✓ Take a chance. Because of the inherent man disadvantage, you can 
never play a straight man-to-man in a ride. So you’ll have to take 
chances. To free up a player for the ride, leave the player farthest from 
the ball open — while still covering the other deep offensive players.
A ride is effective if it causes a turnover — or if it forces the team with pos-
session to throw the ball toward either sideline. To that aim, attackmen must 
not go for big checks that could result in a penalty or could allow opposing 
players — usually defensemen on the clear — to break free. One of the riding 
attackmen should be a chaser, who is free to roam to whoever has the ball.
 
An effective alignment for a ten-man ride is to have your goaltender, a defense-
man, and two midfielders play deep and two defenders and a midfielder form a 
triangle upfield, with the three attackmen pressuring the opposing goaltender 
and defenders.
Clearing Things Up
A clear occurs when the ball moves from the defensive half of the field into 
the offensive zone. Clears are an often underappreciated aspect of the game 
because they often lead to scoring opportunities. Often, clears are only 
noticed when they aren’t completed successfully. There’s a reason for that: 
At the highest levels of lacrosse, teams will be able to successfully clear the 
ball the overwhelming majority of the time. But when they don’t, it can be the 
difference in a game.
Understanding why clears are crucial
Clears are important to a winning team’s success. Performing them success-
fully not only keeps the ball away from the opponent’s hands, but allows you 
to advance the ball offensively in a situation where you very nearly allowed a 
goal to be scored.
 
Here are two good, basic clears for your team to master:
 
✓ Off of a save: Two defenders cut to their respective sideline — the goal 
line extended — with the third defender remaining close to the crease in 
case the clear fails. The three midfielders break up the field: the outside 
midfielders cut toward the sidelines and the third inside midfielder finds 
space in the middle of the field. If the goalie throws the ball to the corner 
defenseman, the midfielders move back toward the ball, finding space.

138
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
✓ Off of a sideline clear: Have a midfielder pick the ball up, with two defen-
semen and the goalie parallel to him so that there are four players equally 
spaced from sideline to sideline. The other two midfielders and remaining 
defensemen are equally spaced across the midfield line. This will provide 
enough room for the player with the ball to find an open man.
Starting with the goalie
When it comes to clearing, the goaltender is in the center of the action (see 
Figure 9-3). If he’s not the one actually triggering the clear, then he, in effect, 
becomes an air-traffic controller.
If the goalie is the player triggering the clear, he has the advantage of being 
able to retreat into the crease, so that the riding team may not immediately 
check him.
Goalies also have the advantage because they can see the entire field and see 
which players are open before firing an outlet pass.

Practicing Team Offense 
and Defense
In This Chapter
▶ Fitting the players into the team offense or defense
▶ Working within a team offensive structure
▶ Defending as a team
A
 game that involves nine players plus a goaltender on each side of 
the ball requires team cooperation. Successful lacrosse teams work 
together, with each individual player displaying his greatest skills within the 
structure of the team’s offense or defense.
All offensive and defensive systems are team systems. We discuss the 
specifics of these systems — that is, the way teams play the game, either 
offensively or defensively — in Chapters 14 and 15. This chapter sets the 
foundation for understanding how a team works together so that it can suc-
cessfully run its offensive and defensive systems.
How the Players Fit In: Roles and Positions 
in Team Offenses and Defenses
There are six players on offense — three attackmen and three midfielders. 
These players all use short sticks except in some instances, usually in transi-
tion, when a long-stick player will bring the ball into the offensive zone.
Attackmen are the players who account for the majority of the scoring. 
They’re the players with the strongest stick skills and hardest, most accurate 
shots. Attackmen are also the most stationary players on the field. Some 

140
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
attackmen plant themselves in front of the crease and simply dunk home 
feeds; others operate behind the goal — or the X position — and direct the 
offense almost like a quarterback. Stick skills, speed, and size are an attack-
man’s greatest attribute, with some coaches rating speed and quickness over 
size and others putting more emphasis on stick skills or size.
Conversely, speed may be the most important attribute for a midfielder. 
Midfielders must run up and down the field and are the most mobile players 
on the field. They also regularly play both offense and defense.
The attackman’s role
Some attackmen spend most of their time setting up teammates for scor-
ing plays with passes. They’re known as feeding attackmen. Many feeding 
attackmen use the large amount of real estate behind the net to engineer the 
offense. This strategy allows them to see the entire offensive zone, including 
cuts that are made as well as the position of the goaltender and defense.
Crease attackmen are those who finish plays by scoring goals. They often 
operate right on the crease.
Not only do attackmen need to have the best stick skills of all the players 
on the team, but they need to have the quickest releases and most accurate 
shots as well. Attackmen also need to be able to get their shots off quickly, 
before slides come. They need to be adept at fakes — both stick fakes and 
head fakes. And they must have excellent hand-eye coordination, which is 
vital for catching as well as scoring from the crease area.
Attackmen have an important role on defense when it comes to rides: They 
must quickly transition from offense to defense as the defensive team is 
attempting to clear the ball.
The midfielder’s role
Midfielders need to be versatile and flexible in their roles when it comes to 
running an offense. Sometimes, they have scoring opportunities from close 
range (though not nearly as often as attackmen do), so they have to be able 
to catch and shoot quickly. They also have to be able to find the open man, 
especially on fast-break opportunities, which they often trigger because fast 
breaks start with either a faceoff win or ground ball at midfield.
Because midfielders are usually stationed at the top of the box in a set 
offense, they have to be adept long-range shooters as well. Long-range shoot-
ing is a difficult skill to acquire and one that requires persistent and diligent 
daily practice.

141
 Chapter 10: Practicing Team Offense and Defense
The box lacrosse offense
In box lacrosse, the offense is made up of two 
creasemen, two cornermen, and a pointman. 
The two creasemen start play low in the corner 
area of the floor. One creaseman is a right shot 
who plays on the left side of the floor. The other 
creaseman is a left shot who plays on the right 
side of the floor.
 ✓ The creaseman: The creaseman is like a 
forward or a winger in hockey or soccer. 
He tries to get out in front of the fast break 
and get down the floor as quickly as he can. 
He positions himself at the crease until any 
possibility of a fast break or odd-man situ-
ation has been eliminated. When the break 
is over, he has the option of staying low on 
the offense or coming up and setting a pick 
against the cornerman’s defender. He’s usu-
ally one of the fastest players on the team.
 
 On any missed shot, the creaseman’s job is 
to go after the loose ball if he has a chance 
to get it. If he can’t get it, he can delay the 
opposition’s break by pressing the stick han-
dler or trying to steal the ball from him. Or he 
can go to the bench if he’s in a system that 
replaces offensive and defensive players on 
the fly (that is, an offense-defense system).
 
 The creaseman must be able to get down 
the floor very quickly, either from the bench 
or out of the defense. Therefore, he must 
have a great ability to catch the ball while 
running at top speed. He must also have 
great ability to score on the run, either 
straight on at the goalie or cutting across 
close to the crease. Finally, he must be able 
to run plays such as the pick-and-roll and 
then have the ability to catch the ball in traf-
fic and score in tight.
 ✓ The cornerman: The cornerman is usually 
the quarterback-type player who starts 
the offense and handles the ball while on 
offense — he’s the player you want to play 
through. He starts at the top of the offense 
and is always a threat to shoot long or go 
one-on-one. He’s a strong long-ball shooter 
yet can cut inside and score. His options, if 
he doesn’t shoot or go one-on-one, are to 
wait for a pick by a creaseman, to pass off 
and cut for a return pass, to hang back at 
the top of the offense for a return pass, or 
to set a pick for a teammate. He also is des-
ignated as the defensive safety on any shot 
at the net, either going all the way back to 
protect his own net or running to the bench 
to get a defensive player on the floor.
 
 The two cornermen — a right shot and a left 
shot — play above and behind the crease-
men. They may start from this position, but 
they could end up anywhere on the floor, 
depending on the flow of the offense and 
where their teammates are on the floor. Their 
best bet is to stay on their own side of the 
floor so that they can always be an instant 
threat to shoot when receiving the ball.
 ✓ The pointman: This position can be either 
behind the cornerman on his proper side 
of the floor or in the middle of the floor. He 
can start in the middle, but after the passing 
and cutting begins, he can cut, pick, or stay 
where he is for a return pass.
 
 The pointman’s role is similar to a corner-
man’s role except that whichever side he’s 
on becomes the strong side of the offense 
(that is, the side with three offensive players). 
A good pointman is always a threat to score 
and he knows which of his teammates has 
the best chance of scoring if he passes the 
ball. He can also pass off and clear out to the 
opposite side of his pass or he can pass to a 
cornerman and run a pick-and-roll with him. 
Finally, he should have great anticipation as 
to when to get back on defense.

142
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
Former Syracuse University standout Paul Carcaterra, now a TV analyst with 
CBS College Sports and the MSG Network, offers some pointers for effective 
shooting for both attackmen and midfielders:
 
✓ Top scorers must have a feel for the cage and where to place their shots 
and when to release them.
 
✓ You can never work on your shooting and shooting situations too much. 
Practice your shot by yourself as often as you can, practice with a defen-
seman and goaltender, and practice the shots you get in a game.
 
✓ Be patient. Shooting is the skill in lacrosse that takes the most time to 
develop. It won’t come overnight, so give it time — and lots of hard work.
Practicing a Team Offensive Philosophy
The primary objective of an offensive team is, of course, to score. Scoring 
may come from defensive pressure, steals, checking, ground balls, fast 
breaks, or a set offense. It really doesn’t matter where the goal originates, as 
long as the team scores.
A secondary objective for an offensive team is to keep itself in position to 
defend against the abrupt change of possession. We discuss both of these 
objectives in this section.
Offense in the women’s game
Attackers are the focal point of the offense in 
the women’s game. Three home positions dom-
inate the attack. The primary jobs of the first 
home, who is stationed closest to the goal, are 
to shoot and finish offensive plays.
If the first home is the finisher of the offense, 
then the second home is the feeder. In addition 
to setting up plays, she must also be a capable 
shooter from every possible scoring position.
The third home is also a playmaker. But she 
usually triggers the start of a scoring play, often 
leading the shift to offense from defense.
However, the position the offensive unit is 
attacking from usually determines who the 
true playmaker will be. For example, it will 
vary based on whether the ball is on top of the 
8-meter arc or behind the goal area.
Attack wings perform duties similar to those of 
the third home. They must also be able to run 
well and pass effectively. 

143
 Chapter 10: Practicing Team Offense and Defense
Keep it simple
In general, a team should try to run a very simple offensive system, especially 
at the youth levels. Try to avoid fancy and complex plays. Instead use simple 
concepts that don’t take much time to set up.
 
Keep things fundamentally sound. The key is not what you do but how you do 
it. Make good crisp passes. Make sure the offensive players are not stagnant 
so that you keep your opponents moving. Know your teammates’ tendencies. 
Keep moving — with and without the ball.
 
Good execution and timing on your plays comes from skill with sound funda-
mentals. The two best things a player can offer on offense are a perfect pass 
and help to set up an open teammate with a pick or a screen.
Balance freedom and structure
Freedom to move with the ball is an effective tool in lacrosse. It often can 
lead to a one-on-one scoring opportunity. However, it can also lead to selfish 
play and grandstanding, keeping other offensive players out of the flow of a 
game.
One-on-one play serves as more of a starting point for offenses. And that 
translates into more of an emphasis on team offense and defense. More often 
than not, it turns into a six-on-six game in the offensive attack area, making it 
similar to basketball. The player with the ball tries to dodge by his man, draw 
a slide from another defender (when a defender leaves his cover for another 
player), and then find an open teammate.
 
Try to maintain a balance by allowing appropriate freedom within a structured 
or disciplined system. You may want to set goals so that your team aims for 50 
percent one-on-one plays and 50 percent team play.
Giving players too much individual freedom usually means that lacrosse is 
being played out of control. You want to be aggressive on offense, but with 
patience and control. You want to keep moving and cutting rather than con-
stantly forcing plays and shots. Constant movement not only leads to more 
open scoring opportunities but also wears down the defenders.

144
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Attack! Attack!
Attack the opposition and keep them off balance before they get a chance to 
attack you. Any offensive action will get a defensive reaction. By attacking on 
offense, you’re more likely to be facing a defense that is a split second behind 
you. Always tell defenders to be proactive, not reactive. Defenders can do 
Offensive mistakes that drive coaches crazy
Help your coach avoid premature graying by 
staying away from some of the following offen-
sive no-no’s:
 ✓ Poor stick-handling: Remember that oppo-
nents are always stick-checking, trying to 
steal the ball. A stick handler’s highest pri-
ority is to protect the ball at all times.
 ✓ Unforced turnovers: Losing the ball when 
not under pressure, badly thrown passes, 
or dropped passes are equally maddening. 
Take care with your passing and catching.
 ✓ Too much passing: Some players spend 
too much time looking to make the perfect 
pretty pass rather than looking to go one-
on-one to beat their defenders or looking to 
shoot. As long as their shooting percentage 
is good, the greatest players are those who 
are known for their ability to beat defenders 
and score, not so much their ability to pass 
and get assists. Now don’t get us wrong 
here — seeing the floor and the ability to 
make a perfect pass into a teammate’s stick 
for a score is naturally important, but it’s 
secondary to scoring in a team’s offensive 
weaponry.
 ✓ The inability to set a pick: You have to know 
how to set a pick on a pick-and-roll as well 
as how to come off a pick. This play is so 
effective in a team’s offensive scheme that 
it has to be an automatic play between two 
teammates. The most common mistake is 
to come off the pick looking to pass rather 
than looking to shoot. The play is designed 
to free up an offensive player for a clear 
shot on goal.
 ✓ Not knowing your cuts: Successful offen-
sive systems require precise timing. Some 
players don’t have the proper timing on 
their cuts — either cutting too early, when 
the stick handler isn’t ready to pass, or 
being checked out of a cutting opportunity. 
Keep working to make cuts happen, to col-
lapse the defense, and to just wear out the 
defenders.
 ✓ Not getting back on turnovers: Another 
major area that drives coaches crazy is 
when their team is scored upon in transi-
tion. On any shot, players need to be ready 
to react back down the field to take away 
the breakaway, instead of admiring the 
shot.

145
 Chapter 10: Practicing Team Offense and Defense
a lot to dictate what the offense can or can’t do, so they shouldn’t wait to 
attack. Forcing the offense to weak areas and positions is extremely effective.
 
An aggressive offense is usually going to be met with an aggressive defense. 
You’ll be taking shots both from the perimeter and from the crease area. 
You’ll have defensive players coming at you from all angles. You can’t be 
afraid to get hit — and you will be hit, especially when you cut toward the 
crease, the prime scoring area.
Focus on good shot selection
It stands to reason that if the primary objective of an offense is to score, then 
the number-one way to achieve that objective is to maintain a high shooting 
percentage. Players must know what a good shot is. Getting high percentage 
shots requires having discipline when taking shots, which reflects a team 
attitude.
 
Here are some pointers that will help you become the best shooter you can be:
 
✓ Don’t show off or be selfish with the ball when shooting.
 
✓ Pass up a so-so shot and pass to a teammate who has a better shot.
 
✓ Shoot smartly. If the goalie is not giving you anything to shoot at, shoot 
at the top corners or bounce a shot at him to try to mix him up.
 
✓ Keep moving. An offense with motion and cutting is much more difficult 
to defend against than one that is stationary.
 
✓ Take only good shots. Don’t bail out the goaltender and defense with 
poor shots.
 
Your shooting rule should be that you can’t shoot when an opponent’s stick 
or body is in front of your shot. The exception is when the defender backs off 
from the shooter, so that you can use him for a screen shot.
 
Offensive possessions are generally shorter in box lacrosse than they are in 
field lacrosse. They’re also less calculated in box lacrosse. There is less struc-
ture and coordination. It’s more common in box lacrosse for a player to take a 
shot without beating his defender.

146
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Building the Team Offense through Drills
In this section, we suggest drills that your team can practice to help establish 
a team attitude when on offense.
Zero passing
 
This drill is ideal to do before practice in place of the standard line drills. It’s 
beneficial because it’s much more realistic than normal line drills and concen-
trates on clearing.
There are three lines — one on the 25-yard line, one on the 50-yard line, and 
one on the opposite 25-yard line. The drill starts when the goalie outlets 
the ball to the first line. Each person continues to pass the ball up the field 
until the ball reaches the other goalie on the opposite side of the field. That 
goalie then outlets the ball to the other line opposite from where the ball drill 
started. So, in total, there are six lines parallel with each other.
Quarterback drill
In this drill, there are three lines 5 yards from the goal line. There is one line 
in front of the goalie, one line to the right of the goalie, and one line on the 
left of the goalie. You need three players for this drill in order to outlet the 
ball, and ideally, three goalies as well. The middle goalie is responsible for 
saying “Break!” The three lines then break up the field. The lines on the right 
A sampling of offensive sets
The most popular offensive formations in 
lacrosse are the 1-3-2 (with one player behind 
the net) and the 2-2-2 (putting two players in 
front of the crease).
Another set, the invert, is becoming more popu-
lar, especially against teams with dominant 
defensemen. Inverting means teams switch and 
move their middies behind the goal and push the 
attackmen out in front. This strategy forces the 
long sticks, who most often defend the attack-
men, out in front of the goal and away from the 
area where most of the offense is created.
Since long sticks are so much tougher to play 
against (because of the length of the stick and 
the fact that all they play is defense), a large 
part of offense involves trying to move around 
so that the player with the ball is going against 
a player with a short stick.

147
 Chapter 10: Practicing Team Offense and Defense
and left both run 15 yards and break hard toward the sideline. The middle 
line breaks just slightly to the right. After the three players catch the pass 
from the goalies, they need to get the ball out of their stick as quickly as 
possible, and pass it up to the waiting attackmen. The attackmen can pass 
it back to the middies for them to shoot, or the attackmen can shoot it 
themselves.
 
This drill is great for clearing and can really help a team looking to excel in 
transition opportunities.
Ball perimeter work
In this drill, there are a total of four lines:
 
✓ One at the X position (behind the net)
 
✓ One on the wing
 
✓ One up top
 
✓ One on the opposite wing
There are three balls in the drill at all times and each player is responsible 
for giving an accurate pass every time. Each player cuts hard toward the goal 
for eight to ten steps and then quickly pops back out to receive the pass.
 
The cut is important because it creates separation from the player and the 
opponent.
X shooting drill
In this drill, there are two lines 5 yards from the goal and another two lines 
on the goal line. The two bottom lines are responsible for giving an accurate 
pass to the player who’s cutting down opposite from where the lines are 
(hence, an X formation). The player cutting down must catch and shoot the 
ball very quickly into the lower corners.
 
This drill helps to improve hand-eye coordination, as well as passing and 
shooting accuracy.

148
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Practicing a Team Defensive Philosophy
A good defense stresses a team concept — that is, six defensive players play-
ing as one. A team-oriented defensive system helps players perform as one. 
Players are able to anticipate the movements of their teammates. In this kind 
of team-focused and disciplined system, players are more likely to be where 
they’re supposed to be and doing what they’re supposed to do, instead of 
freelancing wherever the action is.
Within this defensive system, your team is trying to take away the strength 
of your opponent. Rules on defense can improve your chances of success, 
but against certain teams, your system needs to be flexible enough to make 
adjustments during the game.
Offensive drills for box lacrosse teams
Your box lacrosse team can run a variety of 
drills geared specifically toward box offensive 
positions.
In the 2-on-2 screen on the ball drill, the cor-
nerman passes down and sets a down screen 
for the creaseman on his side of the floor. He 
fights to get an inside position on the defender 
to stop him from switching. The man who sets 
the screen pops back after the cutter passes 
him for defensive safety.
There are a variety of 3-on-3 pointman drills, 
which are set plays for the pointman at the top 
of the offense. He usually starts the drill and ini-
tiates the offense at the top of the offense.
 ✓ 3-on-3 pointman cross pick-and-roll on the 
off-ball side drill: The pointman passes to 
either cornerman, runs to the opposite side, 
and sets a cross pick-and-roll for the other 
cornerman.
 ✓ 3-on-3 pointman down pick-and-roll drill: 
The pointman passes to the cornerman and 
runs a down pick for the cornerman on the 
opposite side of the floor. The creaseman 
on that side of the floor just stays on the 
crease.
 ✓ 3-on-3 pointman give-and-go drill: The 
pointman passes to either cornerman and 
cuts for a return pass down the middle.
 ✓ 5-on-5 pointman double drill: The pointman 
passes to the cornerman, who passes to 
the creaseman, and both the pointman and 
the cornerman set a double screen for the 
creaseman. On the double screen, the top 
screener reads the play and comes back on 
defense.
In the 3-on-3 defensive safety drill (full floor), 
you have three lines. Two of the lines play 
three-on-three live at one end; on the shot, two 
defenders stay on floor while one defender runs 
to the bench for a substitution. The three former 
offensive players react back accordingly. The 
new offensive team gets one shot. After a shot 
by the new offensive team, the play is over. 
Now the new offensive team brings the ball up 
against a new defensive team.

149
 Chapter 10: Practicing Team Offense and Defense
A solid team defensive philosophy centers on placing your most talented 
defensive players in key positions. For example, in most cases, a coach 
whose team employs a man-to-man defense will assign his best defender to 
guard the opposing team’s most dangerous offensive player. In some cases, 
the coach may even decide to shut off that offensive player: The defensive 
player will shadow that offensive player extremely closely all over the field 
to deny him possession of the ball — let alone a shot on goal (if the strategy 
works to perfection, that is).
 
Defensive rules alone don’t get the job done. Knowing how to play defense 
alone doesn’t get the job done. The force of the personalities of players and 
coaches is what determines the quality and intensity of defense — that, and 
the guidelines discussed in this section.
Communicating on the field
This rule is probably the most important for defense: Players must talk to 
each other on the field. Communicating helps to get rid of any defensive 
indecision about who is guarding whom and, at the same time, builds team 
cohesion.
 
Here are some of the things that you need to communicate while playing 
defense:
 
✓ Let your teammates know when you’re defending a certain player. Call 
out, “I’ve got number four,” when picking up a check.
 
✓ Yell out “Who’s hot?” (meaning, “Who has the first slide?”). This call 
should elicit a quick response, “I’m hot,” from the player who has the 
first slide. Call out who the second and third slides are as well.
 
✓ If you spot a ground ball, call out something like “Ball!” This call warns 
the rest of the defenders to look for it, and the direction of the call gives 
them a general idea of where the ball is before they see it.
 
✓ When you gain possession of the ball, let your teammates know that it’s 
time to switch from defensive to offensive mode. Call out something like 
“Break!” to encourage the rest of the defenders to break for a breakaway 
or to run to the bench to let offensive players on the field.
 
✓ When you move over to help out a teammate, let him know that you’re 
there. Call out something like “I’m left” to let your teammate know — 
usually the one who’s defending the stick handler — that he has help.
 
✓ Likewise, if you need help, such as on a pick or a defensive switch, seek 
it. Call out something like “Pick left” and then, if necessary, “Switch” 
or “Stay” depending on whether you’re going to switch assignments 
because of the pick.

150
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
The flow of the game will dictate many more opportunities for you to commu-
nicate on defense.
 
In an effective defensive system, communication is just as important as play-
ing ability. Constantly remind yourself to talk to your teammates during a 
game — in fact, make sure that you remind yourself out loud, not just inside 
your head. And remember to talk during practice sessions as well, which will 
only serve to help you remember to keep on talking.
Adam Lodewick, the defensive coordinator of Yorktown High School in New 
York’s Hudson Valley, which has won 28 sectional titles since 1980, confirms 
the importance of communication: “You can throw any six guys out there 
who have never played together before, but if they communicate with one 
another, you can have a successful defense.”
Pressuring the stick handler
It doesn’t matter what style or type of defense you play — if you can’t stop 
the stick handler, you’re going to have a long season. Stopping the stick han-
dler is the foundation behind all defenses. So having the right technique is 
extremely important.
Defensive mistakes that drive coaches crazy
Improve your team’s defense by following these 
steps so that you can avoid making defensive 
blunders:
 ✓ Pressure the stick handler. Some defend-
ers are content to stand in front of the stick 
handler and either just watch him or wave 
their sticks in front of his stick to delay a 
pass or look to intercept a pass. Instead, 
you have to pressure him with check-
ing and slashing, giving yourself the best 
chance to avoid getting beaten by the stick 
handler faking a pass or a shot, and then 
cutting around you.
 ✓ Defend the pick-and-roll. All you have to 
do to defend the pick-and-roll is warn your 
teammate that a pick is coming. Speak up. If 
you don’t, both you and your teammate will 
end up trailing the cutter who is wide open 
for the pass.
 ✓ Close to the net, defend in front of your 
opponent. A basic offensive play is when 
an offensive player stands in front of the 
crease, waiting for a pass. Many defenders 
play behind him and try to check him out 
of the way. However, the offensive player 
can just lean on his defender, equalizing 
the defensive pressure and putting himself 
in a “relaxed” position to catch the ball and 
turn to shoot. The best way to defend this 
situation is to play on the ball side of the 
opponent. This way, you’re in a position to 
help your teammate on the stick handler if 
he gets beaten; plus, you can deny the pass 
to this offensive player very easily by just 
playing his stick with yours.

151
 Chapter 10: Practicing Team Offense and Defense
The basic defensive stance is taking what is called a position of readiness, 
which means staying down on your opponent by keeping your knees bent, 
staying balanced by spreading your feet wide apart, keeping your back 
straight, and looking at the stick handler at his chest rather than at the ball 
or his stick.
If the player doesn’t have the ball, hold your stick at chest level with your 
arms bent, ready to explode out. If he does have the ball, you always want 
your stick in front of the player’s gloves.
Naturally, you want to be between the ball and the net to stop penetration, 
but your position should also overplay him (that is, keep your body slightly 
off-center from your opponent, trying to force him to the sideline). In this 
position, you can best pressure the stick handler.
 
Be a pest. Check the stick handler’s body, and check him on his stick and 
glove; don’t just wave your stick in the air to try to intercept a pass — force 
the action. Create defensive pressure. Stop his movement toward the net. Be 
the aggressor.
 
When you check the stick handler, you’re really pushing him away from 
you, creating a gap between you and him. If you don’t quickly fill this gap by 
moving out on him, he’ll use you as a screen and shoot around you.
 
In the National Lacrosse League (NLL), players are always trying to get the 
ball off the stick handler by using a wraparound check, slashing, or poking, 
increasing their chances of being beaten or getting a penalty. Referees are 
unpredictable regarding the slash. At one point in a game, they’ll call it; other 
times, they’ll let it go. So consider your chances and the consequences as you 
make your defensive moves.
A key to playing defense is using space as a buffer with the offensive player. 
Overly aggressive defensemen are easily burned. You need to try to force 
the player with the ball away from his strong hand. For example, if a player is 
right-handed, force him so that he is going left, even if that’s toward the goal. 
Sliding (that is, picking up the open man) is the most important part of team 
defense. Slide packages can be complex, frequently involving more than two 
players.
With long sticks looming at the other end, it’s uncommon for a goalie to 
simply launch a clearing pass downfield. Clears are more deliberate, involv-
ing multiple steps as defensemen move the ball out of the defensive area past 
pressuring attackmen. Goalies need to communicate with their defensemen 
where the attackmen are and how to move the ball up the field.

152
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Forcing the ball
Your team defensive strategy should be to force the action. Always be aggres-
sive against the opponent so that you try to dictate where the ball is going 
instead of allowing the offense to dictate it.
When you force the action, you force the ball. By playing an offensive player 
a certain way, you may be able to get him to pass to a less-skilled shooter or 
to shoot from an angle that’s not his best shot. This section suggests some 
ways to force the ball from various points on the playing surface.
When the ball is at the top side
When the ball is at the top side of the offensive zone, play the stick handler 
to the inside part of the field to force that player to the sideline. Your goal in 
forcing the ball in this situation is to take away the first option; the stick han-
dler’s strongest move is the pass to the cutter across the top for a shot.
A defensive strategy that forces the stick handler to the sideline gives him 
only the second option, the weaker of the two. When the stick handler is in 
an outside lane, try to keep him in the alley (the lane between the defender 
and the side of the offensive zone).
When the ball is in the corner
When the ball is low in the corner area, you want to force the stick handler 
back into the middle; again, this is where your help is. If you’re beaten to the 
outside when in the corner area, your defensive teammate will have to come 
over from the off-ball side to help with the stick handler, who now just passes 
across to his teammate for an easy goal.
Defense is an attitude
Another key to defense is having the right 
attitude — being aggressive, mean, physi-
cally tough, intimidating, and irritating, as well 
as ticking people off. It may help you to think 
of defense as a stormy day with lightning and 
thunder. Play this type of aggressive defense to 
get the ball, to run, and to score.
To play good defense, a defensive player needs 
about 75 percent attitude and 25 percent skill. 
Attitude can make up for lack of skill. If you 
do get beaten because of weak technique, an 
aggressive attitude can still help you recover 
by pursuing the stick handler or cutter and pre-
venting him from scoring.

153
 Chapter 10: Practicing Team Offense and Defense
 
Ric Beardsley, a four-time all-American defenseman at Syracuse University 
who also starred in both Major League Lacrosse (MLL) and the NLL, offers 
some tips for defensemen:
 
✓ Find your man. Call out who you have on each dead ball.
 
✓ Be flexible. When playing defense, you need to keep your head on a 
swivel and hips open to the stick handler and your man off ball. This 
allows you to keep an eye on the ball and an eye on your man.
 
✓ Position yourself properly. Always stay between your offensive player 
and the goal.
 
✓ Communicate. Communicating with your defensive teammates is essen-
tial to good team defense and slide packages.
Defending picks: To switch 
or not to switch
Switching on defense means exchanging defensive assignments with a team-
mate during the play of the game. Switching occurs when two offensive play-
ers come close to each other, where one tries to interfere with the other’s 
defender in order to force the defenders to switch defensive assignments. 
One reason why picks are used so much is that, if they work, they create a 
moment of indecision for the defense or they create a gap for the stick han-
dler to shoot or go one-on-one.
The first thing you do is stop your opponent from setting the pick as he goes to 
set it. You can do this by checking the picker and pushing him out of the way 
so that you don’t get tied up with the picker. By getting tied up, you create a 
screen for the stick handler, which gives him a number of options, including 
moving toward the net for a more open shot or passing to an open teammate.
 
How can you defend a pick? First, you have to anticipate being picked before it 
occurs. The job of the defender on the picker is to verbally warn you that you’re 
about to be picked by calling out “Pick left” or “Pick right.” Then you can jump 
out hard at the stick handler, instead of waiting for him to come to you. Or if you 
do get picked, you can go to him hard to fill the gap created by the pick.
When you hear your teammate calling out an upcoming pick, you can neutral-
ize the pick by stepping back and switching checking assignments with your 
teammate. On this switch, make sure that you, as the defender on the stick 
handler, get on the inside position of your new check — that is, between your 
new check and the net — and play his body to prevent him from receiving 
the pass as he rolls to the net.

154
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
If it’s a poor pick, you don’t need to switch with your teammate; instead, you 
can stay with your own check by fighting or sliding through the pick and 
staying even with your opponent. In fact, when you get past the picker, you 
can show yourself to the stick handler at an angle to force him back to the 
sidelines. Be aware, though, that the stick handler may fake to go one way 
and then go the opposite way off the pick as an element of surprise.
 
If you don’t switch, the defender on the picker should call “Stay” to let you 
know that you’re not going to switch. He can even show himself to the stick 
handler while still staying with the picker just to slow down the stick handler 
and help you out.
Defending screens on the ball side: 
To switch or not to switch, part 2
To defend against the screen, the defender on the screener must stay 
between his check and the ball. He plays on the ball side, or top side, of the 
screener, putting his stick over the screener’s stick. He definitely does not 
stand behind the screener.
Now if the stick handler beats you, as the defender, and goes to the net, your 
teammate is in a position to leave his screener and stop him. But if the stick 
handler comes out of the corner to use the screen, your teammate (the one 
defending the screener) can move around behind the screener, to the other 
side, or even stay in the front, to get into a position to switch and jump out 
at the stick handler aggressively as he comes off the screen. When this hap-
pens, you can switch defensive assignments, going to the screener who may 
try to roll to the net.
 
What’s the difference between a screen and a pick? A screen is interference 
that happens away from the ball. A pick is interference that happens on the 
ball.
 
Ric Beardsley, the former Syracuse University and MLL star defenseman, has 
these words of wisdoms for defending players with the ball:
 
✓ Keep a half-step in front of your man. This is called being even with 
your man.
 
✓ Your stick should always be under or on the free hand. If you can take 
one of the stick handler’s hands away, he’s forced to play with one hand. 
If he can shoot and pass with one hand, well, then he deserves to score.
 
If the stick handler coming out of the corner can’t get close enough to the 
screen to rub his check out of the play, the defenders just stay with their 
checks.

155
 Chapter 10: Practicing Team Offense and Defense
Building the Team Defense through Drills
This section suggests a few drills that your team can practice to help estab-
lish a team attitude when on defense.
2-on-1 defending the pick-and-roll 
on the ball
In this drill, you can put the defender on the stick-handler first to learn to 
step back when being picked, or to fight through the pick (if it’s a poor pick), 
before reestablishing pressure on the ball. Then you can put the defender on 
the picker, who must call out “Pick” to the imaginary defender and jump out 
on the stick handler.
The next progression is to let the offensive player go one-on-one against the 
defender when he jumps out.
Maintaining floor position
When defending on the off-ball side of the 
defense in box lacrosse, your defense should 
form a flat triangle. You’re at the apex of the 
triangle (toward the center lane), and the stick 
handler (up top) and your check (in the outside 
lane) form the base of the triangle. It’s called 
a flat triangle because you play off your check 
slightly and toward the stick handler to be in a 
position to help.
If you play a deep triangle, where you’re closer 
to the net, with your check and the stick han-
dler at about equal distances from you, you’re 
protecting the net more than playing your check 
and watching the stick handler. In this situation, 
your check could cut very easily for a pass and 
shot. And in the flat triangle, you should always 
keep your opponent in front of you, never play-
ing him even, or parallel to the net, because he 
could fake up and cut behind you for a quick 
pass and shot. If your opponent goes behind 
you on a backdoor cut, always assume that a 
pass is coming his way and turn and play his 
stick hard.
Solid team defense related to the position of the 
ball suggests that if your stick handler passes 
the ball, you should move to the level of the 
ball immediately and then adjust your position 
according to your check. You’re now in a posi-
tion ready to collapse, help, and rotate, espe-
cially from the top of the defense.
The final rule for positioning is that the defense 
moves before the offense moves on any move-
ment of the ball.

156
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
4-on-4 shell drill to practice defensive 
positioning
This drill is a great one to do during every defensive practice. First, get the 
offense to stay stationary and move the ball around. After the defenders have 
taken the proper position regarding their checks and the ball, the offensive 
players without the ball can move to get in the clear; the stick handler can’t 
move.
Practice several scenarios with each drill, including moving with and without 
the ball, using and not using picks or screens, penetration or no penetration, 
and shot or no shot.
3-on-2 help-side defense
Break the 4-on-4 drill down into a 3-on-2 situation. The stick handler tries to 
make a pass to the 2-on-2 on the off-ball side, with offensive players remain-
ing stationary. Then the offensive players can interchange, move up and 
down the side, try to cut to the ball for a pass, and work a pick. The defend-
ers work to defend against each offensive scenario.
Box-specific defensive drills
Here are a couple of drills specific to box 
lacrosse defensive positions:
 ✓ 4-on-4 defending screens on the ball or 
off-ball drill: Defending the off-ball screen, 
the top offensive player passes outside to 
a teammate and then sets a screen for the 
bottom offensive player by tying up or get-
ting inside position on his defender on the 
way down. The defender on the screener 
must be ready to switch onto the cutter 
coming off the screen. He does this by not 
getting tied up and fighting to get inside 
position on the screener so that he’s in a 
position to fire out on the cutter.
 
 You can also work this drill on the ball side 
of the floor with the stick handler passing 
down to the creaseman and then trying to 
set a screen on his defender as he looks 
for a phony return pass. The stick handler 
comes out of the corner area looking to use 
the screen. The defenders play the screen 
accordingly.
 ✓ 3-on-2 half-floor defensive drill: A group of 
five players rotate in and out of the defense 
and offense. Two defenders try to stop 
three offensive players from scoring for 10 
seconds, or until they drop the ball. Give 
one group of two defenders five opportuni-
ties to stop the offense. This drill stresses 
aggressive and intense defensive play, 
communication on the floor, concentra-
tion, anticipation, helping out a teammate, 
totally recovering or rotating, and defensive 
coordination.

Specialty Teams
In This Chapter
▶ Revving up the offense with the man-up and power-play units
▶ Overcoming a player deficit with the man-down and man-short units
▶ Running drills for the specialty units
T
he most underappreciated part of lacrosse is its specialty teams: the 
man-up offense and the man-down defense in field lacrosse, and the 
power-play offense and the man-short defense in box lacrosse.
If you have a strong man-up offense that you can run when your opponent is 
down a player because of a penalty, your odds of scoring a goal are signifi-
cantly higher. In the case of non-releasable penalties (such as an illegal stick 
penalty), teams are often able to score two goals — sometimes even three 
goals or more — using their specialty teams.
Most field lacrosse penalties last 30 seconds or a minute, limiting your 
man-up offense’s ability to be patient. With the added space in field lacrosse, 
man-up units rely on set plays. Though penalty opportunities are few during 
games, most college teams spend as much time practicing their man-up plays 
as they do their six-on-six offenses. This is because in these often-elaborate 
offensive man-up sets, everyone has a role and execution is crucial to suc-
ceed in these extremely important scoring opportunities.
 
In box lacrosse, penalties are usually two minutes or five minutes in length. If you 
have a strong man-down defense that can keep an opponent’s man-up unit at 
bay, limiting the number of goals per shot attempts, you’ll also be very competi-
tive. In many cases the closest, toughest games are won by the specialty teams.
Good teams, more often than not, are ones that are not penalized frequently 
and also take advantage of penalties called against the opposition by cashing 
in with goals that often are crucial for swinging the momentum in a game.

158
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
In this chapter, we tell you the ingredients for effective specialty teams, 
including how to make the most of your man-up opportunities, and what to 
do when you’re short-handed.
Operating When You Have 
a Player Advantage
Man-up opportunities occur when an opposing player commits a penalty 
and is sent off to sit out of action for the designated amount of time. That 
player is not replaced, so the non-penalized team has a player advantage for 
the duration of the penalty period (or until it scores a goal, in the case of the 
releasable penalties). (See Chapter 4 for more information about the rules 
involved in man-up and power-play situations.)
Practicing patience on the 
man-up/power play
A key element for players on the man-up or power play is patience. Many 
players think they have to get the shot off right away or feel as though they’d 
better shoot because they may not get the ball back from their teammates.
The man-down team wants you to take quick shots, because quick shots 
usually aren’t as successful. Quick shots are okay occasionally, but they 
shouldn’t be the norm. Usually, they’re successful when you use them as an 
element of surprise.
 
Take your time by reversing the ball around the zone or among the three top 
players of your man-up or power play. Unless you have a no-brainer wide-
open shot, you never want to make one pass and then shoot, because the 
man-down players are usually in their best defensive position at the beginning 
of a penalty-killing situation, and they’re alert and active. Also, the goalie is in 
his best position to see the pass and shot.
 
Quick ball movement is crucial. Because a man-down defense has to rotate, 
the offensive team should strive to move the ball faster than they can rotate, 
creating an opportunity for an open shot.
On the flip side, you don’t want to just pass the ball and pass the ball and pass 
the ball and then shoot only when you realize you’re running out of time. A 
great man-up or power play not only moves the ball but also moves the defen-
sive players out of their alignment by penetrating or attacking the gaps.

159
 Chapter 11: Calling on the Special Forces: Specialty Teams
Aligning your players on 
the man-up/power play
In field lacrosse, when you’re up a man, the opposing team’s man-down align-
ment is usually similar to what the team uses when it’s defending a six-on-five 
transition — namely, a five-man zone.
 
In box lacrosse, the man-short defense is likely to be a simple box alignment 
with two players up top and two players down low. Your pointman should 
play at the top of the zone between the top two defenders. The standard prac-
tice is to line up other players behind the defenders, not beside them. Players 
tend to gravitate to their opponents, which makes it easier for the defensive 
team to check your players.
 
In box lacrosse, the shooters stand outside and behind the two top defenders. 
By playing your shooters behind the two top defenders — in fact, by playing 
them almost equidistant from the top and bottom defenders — you may be 
able to create uncertainty for the man-down players. On a pass to a shooter, 
which defender will move to play him — the top one or the bottom one? With 
this slight uncertainty, your shooter may get that split second he needs to get 
an open shot or pass. The creasemen can choose to move in and out of the 
middle — in front of or behind the defenders — to create an additional pass-
ing lane on power-play opportunities.
Singling out good man-up/
power-play players
To be successful on man-up and power-play chances, your players must 
practice discipline — they shouldn’t take any retaliatory penalties, mouth off 
to the referee, or do anything else irresponsible that would negate the advan-
tage you have. They also need to commit to being at practice all the time 
because the man-up and power play require precise execution, which must 
be practiced all the time.
 
If a player can’t or won’t give you this kind of discipline, that doesn’t mean 
you can’t use him. But you probably don’t want to waste your time with him 
on the man-up or power-play unit. He can still play a regular shift for the team, 
though.
 
Here are some important fundamental principles to remember on the man-up 
or power play:

160
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
✓ Make your passes count. Practice throwing shooting passes (passes that 
the receiver can catch and shoot all in one motion). Have your players 
work together to get to know their teammates’ best shooting positions. 
For example, if one shooter has a great sidearm shot, a shooting pass to 
him would be off to the side of his shooting arm.
 
 Also, try to avoid making predetermined passes, unless you’re running 
a set play. Instead, move the ball randomly, counting on your players to 
spot defensive weaknesses and get the ball to that area of the zone. 
 
✓ Be ready to shoot before you get the ball. Encourage your top offen-
sive players to be ready to shoot before receiving the pass. Their 
sticks should be back, level to the field or floor, and their feet should 
be planted for a quick step into their shots. This ready position helps a 
player get a quick and accurate shot off as soon after he catches the ball 
as possible.
 
✓ Keep your players moving. By moving the ball and moving your play-
ers, your man-up or power play can make the defense move or shift, 
potentially creating openings for penetration or shots. Don’t resort to 
only passing the ball around the outside.
 
✓ Keep your players properly aligned. This will allow them to pass 
and move into the play freely instead of catching and then retreating 
because of pressure.
 
When selecting your man-up units, choose your team’s top offensive players, 
regardless of position. An athletic midfielder may be able to get up and down 
the field and run on the first line, but a fourth attackman with more pure offen-
sive skills to feed, shoot, and dodge will be more valuable to a man-up unit.
Running set plays in the man-up/
power-play offense
You may have your best chance of scoring on the man advantage without 
running a set play. The freedom that your players have to read what the 
defense gives them is usually your best offensive weapon. However, having 
a set play does give a lift to a team whose ball and player movement have 
become stagnant.
Starting your man advantage with a set play in place gives the unit a clear 
plan of attack that can be adjusted based upon what the defense is allowing.
 
The best man-up plays for an offense are often similar to the ones it employs 
in settled situations. In the following sections, we give you a look at some 
effective man-up plays from LaxLessons.com.

161
 Chapter 11: Calling on the Special Forces: Specialty Teams
 
Give your plays unique names so you can call them out without revealing to 
your opponent what play you’re running. For example, if you’re running the 
3-3 set with a screen, and you yell out, “3-3!”, your opponent will know immedi-
ately what you’re planning to do. But if you’ve told your team ahead of time 
that the “3-3” is called “Emma,” you can shout out, “Emma!”, and the opposi-
tion will be none the wiser.
Crease pass and shoot
After one clockwise rotation, Player 4 carries the ball before throwing it to 
Player 3, who then passes it off to Player 2, who rotates up from behind the 
net before passing it off to Player 3. As Player 3 holds the ball, Player 1, as a 
decoy, cuts in his direction. Player 2 then gets the ball back at the goal line 
extended. After the defense rotates, Player 5 sets a screen that frees Player 6 
on the backside for a pass across the crease from Player 2.
Don’t miss the point on the power play
In box lacrosse, the pointman is definitely the 
most important player on the power play. If you 
don’t have a great pointman, you probably won’t 
have a great power play. Here are the signature 
qualities of a great pointman:
 ✓ A great long-ball shot, usually overhand or 
sidearm
 ✓ Great passing skills with the ability to pass 
quickly and accurately
 ✓ The ability to see the whole floor and read 
the defensive setup
 ✓ Decisiveness with the ball
The pointman has several options during a 
power-play set, including scoring with a long 
shot from the top, following passes to either 
shooter by taking a step toward the pass, and 
being ready to reverse the ball.
The two shooters (cornermen, in a regular set), 
left shot and right shot, play on each side during 
the power play and are your primary shooters 
from the side. They should be excellent shoot-
ers with the ability to hit the far top corner or 
far side of the net as their primary shot and the 
near side of the net as their secondary shot. 
They also have to be good passers who can 
dump a pass to the near creaseman or fire a 
level pass to the opposite side of the floor to the 
far creaseman or the other shooter.
The shooters should not pass to a creaseman 
unless a bottom defender comes up after the 
shooter. You should limit your passes to the 
crease unless you have a clear chance to 
score. They can also decoy the first pass by 
trying to fool the man-short players into thinking 
that you’re going to attack from one side, and 
then reverse the ball and look to attack from the 
other side.
Stress to your players that even with the decoy, 
as they swing the ball quickly to the other side, 
they should always look for an open shot. They 
should also swing the ball around quickly to get 
the goalie and the man-short players moving 
out of their positions. Too many teams slow 
down the ball while looking for a shot, giving the 
man-short players time to recover and interfere 
with a shot.

The ball is passed around once clockwise. The last player to catch it, Player 4, 
brings it up top. Player 4 then throws it to Player 2, who just moved from 
a wing position behind the cage to a position off the crease. As the pass is 
made, Player 5 cuts hard, using Player 2 as a decoy. Player 2 then throws the 
ball across the crease to Player 1. At the same time, Player 6 sets a pick on 
the top defenseman on the wing and Player 3 comes across to the right side 
of the screen by Player 5. If the defenseman getting screened comes out to 
cover Player 4, then Player 5 cuts to the goal for a pick and roll.
The 3-3 set with a screen is shown in Figure 11-2.

Following one rotation of the ball, Player 4 passes it off to Player 3, who

himself for a pass from Player 2. Player 1, meanwhile, cuts from the wing to 
the backside and gets a pass from Player 6. He then looks for Player 5 up top 
or Player 6 on the crease.

1 after the ball moves clockwise as Player 2 moves to get a pass. If nothing 
develops, Player 1 moves the ball to Player 6, who looks for Player 4.
The wide 2-2-2 set is shown in Figure 11-5.
3-3 camouflage
This play is set up so that the play that is run out of the 3-3 is disguised. After 
Player 3 moves the ball upfield, Player 4 rotates to the middle of the 3-3 set. 
Player 6 then moves toward the crease, Player 5 moves to the top-right posi-
tion, and Player 1 goes to the bottom-right spot. Player 2 then moves from 
the crease to the lower-left spot.
The 3-3 camouflage is shown in Figure 11-6.

Ready, set for some man-short plays
Here are a few set plays to try against a box 
alignment in the man-short defense in box 
lacrosse:
 ✓ Cutter play: Sending cutters through the 
man-short can create confusion and chaos. 
The first pass of this play goes from the 
pointman to the shooter. The second pass 
goes back to the pointman, who makes the 
third pass by reversing the ball to the other 
shooter.
 ✓ Swing play: The pointman passes to the 
shooter on the side of the floor from which 
the play runs. The shooter passes back to 
the pointman who continues the reversal 
to the other shooter. When this shooter 
catches the ball, the off-ball creaseman 
cuts into the middle while the off-ball 
shooter slides down into the creaseman’s 
spot for a pass and shot.
 ✓ Diagonal play: When you call this play, the 
creaseman on the side on which the play 
occurs moves behind the defender or out at 
an angle so that he creates a passing lane. 
Following a reversal sequence, the point-
man passes to the shooter who then makes 
a diagonal pass to the opposite creaseman. 
 ✓ Middle play: This play calls for the pointman 
to cut down the middle of the man-short. 
You should run this play only periodically; 
it’s a great surprise play to catch the man-
short off guard. If the pointman is a left 
shot, he passes to the right-shot shooter, 
who passes to the right-shot creaseman, 
who passes to the pointman cutting down 
the middle of the zone. If the pointman is a 
right-hand shot, reverse the sequence.
The diamond alignment of the man-short plays 
three defenders (a point defender and two wing 
defenders) against the three top players in the 
power-play alignment. The fourth defender (the 
back defender) plays between the two crease-
men in the middle of the zone, creating the 
fourth point on the diamond.
To beat a diamond man short, look for diagonal 
passes, send cutters through the middle of the 
zone, pick defenders in the zone, and get the 
ball to the crease. Here are a few set plays to 
run against the diamond-man short:
 ✓ Up pick play: The off-ball creaseman sets 
an up pick (that is, picking him up toward 
the top of the zone) on the off-ball wing 
defender while the off-ball shooter drops 
to the crease for a pass and shot from the 
opposite shooter or creaseman.
 ✓ Top pick play: To start this play, the left-
shot pointman passes to the right-shot 
shooter. The left-shot shooter sets a top 
pick (toward the top of the zone) on the 
point defender while the left-shot pointman 
cuts to the left-shot shooter’s position for a 
pass and shot.
 ✓ Diagonal pass to crease: The pointman 
passes to the shooter who returns the ball 
back to the pointman who reverses the ball 
to the other shooter. This shooter looks to 
make the diagonal pass to the opposite 
creaseman.

 Chapter 11: Calling on the Special Forces: Specialty Teams
Playing defense on the man-up/power play
When the man-down/power-play unit is playing defense, it can double-team 
the stick handler to try to create a turnover, or it can play a zone defense 
with some extra pressure on the stick handler (often a 2-1-2).
The best way for the man-down unit to get the ball back quickly is to pres-
sure the man-up players to force them to turn the ball over.
After a shot, the man-up/power-play unit does need to be prepared to play 
defense should the shot miss and the man-down team get the rebound. On 
the shot, each player goes to a previously assigned defensive player.
Most man-down defenses are set up with players near the goal trying to pre-
vent higher-percentage shots from being unleashed from just outside the 
crease. This often forces the man-up offense to settle for lower-percentage 
perimeter shots.
Attacking the six-on-five situation
In certain game situations, you have a chance 
to pull your goalie off the floor and send a sixth 
offensive player onto the floor. These situations 
usually occur on a delayed penalty, during the 
last 10 seconds of a period, or at the end of the 
game when you’re behind.
Try these plays to take advantage of this type 
of power play:
 ✓ Bench play: Just get the ball on the oppo-
site side of the bench and run a player off 
the bench right through the zone defense. 
This can be an element-of-surprise to run 
even when the defense is not expecting you 
to pull your goalie.
 ✓ Regular play: If the opposition plays a 2-1-2 
zone, put a player in the middle of the zone 
and attack the zone as if in a power play.
 ✓ High play: Against a 1-2-2 zone defense, 
place a man in the top middle of the zone. 
He can set a pick on the top defender for 
the pointman to get a shot.
 ✓ Low play: Place a good scoring creaseman 
in the bottom middle of the zone. He looks to 
receive a pass in the middle, usually from a 
creaseman, for a shot.

Defending at a Disadvantage: The 
Man-Down/Man-Short Defense
Maintaining discipline is even more critical for the man-down and man-short 
defense than for the man-up and power-play offense. If one of your man-down 
players ends up taking a retaliatory penalty or protests to a referee, you’re 
going to soon find your team on the short end of a two-man advantage.
Man-down defenses most often rely on a basic box-and-one scheme in field 
lacrosse. Defense may form a box around the offensive player who is respon-
sible for the ball-side crease area. This requires a four-man rotation. The 
alternative to this set is a five-man rotation in which the responsibility for the 
crease goes to the defender who is furthest from the ball. 
As with man-up units, the best pure defensive players should play man-down. 
Lateral movement, the ability to knock down passes, and take-away ability 
are more important than the speed to start a fast break.
After the defense gets the ball into the opposing offensive box, the penalty is 
released (unless it’s a harsher non-releasable call). Teams can then push the 
ball toward goal, but it’s usually advisable to pull the offense back and substi-
tute your offensive players back in.
To execute man-down defenses, you need aggressive, quick, and smart play-
ers. Your decision to play a box-and-one or a diamond man-short formation 
should be based on where the man-up or power-play offense set up its best 
shooters — and how many of its best shooters are on the field or floor.
 
Play in a box if the man-up/power-play unit keeps working the ball to the sides; 
rotate into a diamond when the ball stays at the top of the zone.
Building your man-down/
man-short defense
The two bottom defenders should be big and physical — all the better if they 
also have a long reach to deter passes and make that little check on the offen-
sive player’s hands and arms. They should be good at getting ground balls 
and quick enough to get back into the play on any rotation by his defensive 
teammates.

169
 Chapter 11: Calling on the Special Forces: Specialty Teams
The two top defenders are usually a little quicker than the bottom defenders; 
they need to be able to anticipate the results of a shot and use their quick-
ness to break for a transition pass.
Though quicker, they still have to play aggressively and be physical on the 
man down or man short. They should be smart enough to read who has the 
hot hand on the man-up or power play and overplay him a bit more. And if 
the two top defenders can score, the man-up or power-play unit may play 
more cautiously to avoid turning the ball over to the good scorers.
All your man-down/man-short defenders must stay active, both with their 
body movement and with their sticks. Because a man-up/power-play offense 
can involve a great deal of passing back and forth, you have to guard against 
your defenders getting bored and losing defensive focus.
 
Here are a couple of keys to running a man-down defense:
 
✓ Pack it inside. Stationing the majority of the defense toward the crease 
helps cut down on shots from just outside the crease and forces perim-
eter shots. It also forces the team on offense to work the ball around, 
which helps to chew time off the clock and kill the penalty.
 
✓ Run the 2-1-2 set. Station your quickest and most athletic player in the 
middle so he can cover the crease ball-side. The perimeter defensemen 
pinch in as needed.
Thinking inside the box
The box alignment is the common man-short 
defensive formation in indoor lacrosse. Quite 
simply, the four defensive players play in a box 
formation — two players at the top of the zone, 
and two players at the bottom. The two top 
defenders play the three top offensive players, 
while the bottom defenders play the creasemen.
From this formation, either of your two top 
defenders can easily break down the floor on 
a shot. In this formation, if the shooter on the 
power play cuts through the middle of the zone, 
the opposite-side bottom defender must leave 
his creaseman and cross-check the shooter 
with the ball.
The diamond alignment of the man-short 
defense is just a box alignment turned on its 
corner. Three defenders (a point defender and 
two wing defenders) play against the three top 
players in the power-play alignment. The fourth 
defender (the back defender) plays between 
the two creasemen in the middle of the zone, 
creating the fourth point on the diamond.

170
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Playing offense on the 
man-down/man-short
Although the man-down or man-short is definitely a defensive specialty team, 
occasionally you have to think offense with your defense. Your man-down or 
man-short defense will be a little stronger if you have players at the top who are 
a threat to score. The man-up or power-play offense won’t play as recklessly if 
they know that they may have to get back because of this scoring threat.
If the goalie stops a shot, he first looks to throw the long breakaway pass to 
one of the top players breaking or to a breaking player coming into the game. 
A breakaway situation can also occur following a ground ball or loose ball. 
In the chaos that accompanies recovering it, you may be able to beat the 
man-up or power-play unit down the field or floor. Look to pass the ball up 
the field or floor rather than run the ball up, because passing is the quickest 
way to move the ball.
If your man-down or man-short defense can’t create a quick scoring opportu-
nity in transition, your best offensive option is to slow down the game to run 
out the penalty.
Running man-down/man-short drills
In addition to running the following drills, your best man-down/man-short 
practice work will come out of game-like situations and scrimmages during 
practices.
Rotation drill
Place cones where the man-up/power-play unit would stand. The defensive 
players rotate together for cohesion.
Delay drill
In this drill, practice holding the ball by constantly running down picks on 
the off-ball side and throwing passes to the player coming off the pick and 
also by running a straight motion, spread offense.

▶ Increasing strength with weight training
▶ Getting mentally ready to play
L
acrosse players are among the fittest athletes in the world. They must 
have speed and quickness, as well as upper-body strength to take all the 
pounding that happens during the course of a game — whether it’s a check 
or a good, clean hit. You should do your best to be in game-ready shape 
when your team gathers to start workouts for an upcoming season. After all, 
pre-season training camps don’t always focus on getting into shape; instead, 
they usually concentrate on skills and team play.
Here are a few more things to keep in mind as you get in playing shape for 
lacrosse:
 
✓ No rest for the weary, so train to minimize weariness. A lacrosse game 
consists of endurance running, short bursts of speed, stop-and-start 
running with high intensity, and a lot of body and stick contact thrown 
in, with only brief rests before returning to action.
 
✓ Practice sprint marathoning. Lacrosse players have to run short bursts 
of speed over a long period of time, so players have to train for both 
types of running.
 
✓ Even a flat surface has its ups and downs. In a lacrosse game, if you’re 
in shape, you feel like you’re running downhill. If you’re not in very 
good shape, you feel like you’re running uphill — and the game can be 
drudgery.

172
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
In this chapter, we give you the information you need to be at the top of your 
game, both mentally and physically.
Understanding the Benefits 
of Being in Condition
Being in great shape allows you to perform at the highest level your body 
(and mind) can. Here are a few reasons why you should strive for top 
physical conditioning:
Staying in the zone
Being in game shape is a mental challenge 
for lacrosse players. You should be able to 
stay in the zone, which encourages great 
performance. This chapter discusses getting 
ready to play mentally. Here are a few tips to 
get you started:
 ✓ Be positive. Lacrosse is, after all, a game, 
and your mental attitude toward it should 
be a positive one. Remember, too, that 
staying positive is easy when you’re 
winning; the tough part is staying positive 
after you lose or make mistakes.
 ✓ Accept the challenge. Look forward to 
each upcoming game, to the challenge of 
the opponent (both your team’s opponent 
and any particular individual opponent you 
have in mind) and to the fundamentals of 
the challenge that awaits.
 ✓ Plan for success. The players who antici-
pate that each game will be a good game 
are usually the successful ones.
 ✓ Use your nervousness. Try to focus and 
quiet your mind before the game. But 
remember that feeling a little bit nervous is 
okay, too. Use your nerves to help you get 
physically energized and ready to play. Let 
your mind keep things loose.
 ✓ Have fun. Lacrosse is a game. Enjoy 
yourself!
The result of these good feelings is that you get 
into the zone. Being in the zone means that you 
play alert and can anticipate things before they 
happen — all the activity around you seems 
to happen in slow motion. Your mental focus 
is totally absorbed in playing the game and 
blocking out all distractions. You play with self-
confidence and you’re emotionally controlled. 
Being in the zone helps you play the game 
effortlessly and you react more by instinct than 
by rote.

173
 Chapter 12: Becoming a Better Lacrosse Player — Physically and Mentally
 
✓ You prevent injuries. Injuries are part of lacrosse. Whether it’s a cut, a 
skinned knee, a pulled muscle, a broken arm or leg, or a sprained ankle, 
if you play lacrosse, you will get injured. How often you get injured and 
how fast you recover depends a great deal on the condition you’re in.
 
 Eating right, stretching, and getting plenty of sleep can help limit 
injuries — with a little help from plain old good luck.
 
✓ You improve your lacrosse performance. If you’re in top physical 
condition, you can improve your speed, increase your ability to take 
a hit, become more agile, react quicker, run faster, and play longer at 
maximum efficiency.
 
✓ You get mentally tough. When you start to tire in your conditioning 
drills, that’s when you should start to push yourself more.
 
 Your team has to play together as one, so mental toughness as part of 
top physical conditioning is a team goal as well as a personal one. When 
working on conditioning, coaches need to make sure that all players 
reach the goals set for the team on any particular day. If one player falls 
behind, everyone goes again.
Stretching to Be Your Best
As with any physical conditioning, your best workout is only as effective as 
your best pre-workout stretch.
Stretching helps to reduce strains, sprains, spasms, and muscle tears and 
prevent muscles from being tight and inflexible. Stretching also helps to 
prevent injuries common to running, such as pulled muscles, shin splints, 
ankle sprains, hamstring pulls, pulled groins, and Achilles tendonitis (also 
known as an Achilles heel, an inflamed heel cord).
Stretching before and after practices and games will keep you flexible — it 
reduces muscle tension by increasing your range of motion, which makes you 
a better lacrosse player.
How to stretch
Before you stretch, it’s a good idea to warm up a little with a light jog, running 
backward, or even enough carioca to work up a sweat. (Carioca is a sideways 
running exercise in which you cross-step laterally up and down the playing 
surface.)

174
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Conduct your stretching sessions in just about the same way every time you 
work out. Work your larger muscles first, and then move on to your smaller 
muscles. In other words, start with your back, hips, hamstrings, groin, and 
quads (calves, ankles, and feet), and then follow up by stretching your 
shoulders, arms, wrists, and neck.
When you stretch, hold the stretch in a fixed position for a sustained period 
of time — aim for 20 to 30 seconds. Avoid bouncing up and down when 
stretching; save any movement for the practice or the game.
 
When stretching, you should feel a mild tension or a moderate burning 
sensation in your muscles, but no pain. If you feel pain, your body is telling 
you to stop.
Stretching exercises for lacrosse
Any kind of stretching is a good habit to get into before working out with 
your team or before a game, and some stretching methods are especially 
helpful for getting ready for lacrosse activity. This section introduces these 
drills.
Back stretches
Whether you’re playing on a grass or turf field or the hard indoor surface of a 
box lacrosse arena, your constant running — not to mention the convoluted 
body positions you may end up in as a result of a check or an awkward shot 
on goal — will put some strain on your back.
Here are some good stretches to get your back limbered up for practice or a 
game:
 
✓ Rollover: Lie on your back, with your arms flat on the field at your sides. 
Bring both your legs together over your head and back. While keeping 
your legs straight, and your arms on the field, try to touch the field with 
your feet.
 
✓ Pretzel stretch: This stretch works on your lower back. Sitting upright, 
place your right hand on the field behind you and rotate your head and 
shoulders toward your right hand. Then cross your left leg over your 
right leg. Pull your left knee across your body with your left arm until 
you feel the stretch in the hip and torso of your left side. Repeat the 
stretch on the other side.
 
✓ Lying gluteal stretch: Lie on your back. Bend your right knee and pull it 
toward your chest until you feel a good stretch in the lower-back area. 
Repeat the stretch on the other side.

175
 Chapter 12: Becoming a Better Lacrosse Player — Physically and Mentally
Leg stretches
Because lacrosse requires constant motion on your part, stretching your legs 
in preparation for playing is critical. These stationary exercises are a good 
start:
 
✓ Side-to-side leg swings: Swing one leg at a time from one side of your 
body to the other. Work on this exercise doing ten repetitions per leg. 
You may want to hang onto a teammate for balance.
 
✓ Front-to-back kicks: Swing one leg at a time, forward and backward, not 
using so much thrust that you risk kicking off your shoe. Remember: 
You’re just warming up here. Again, you may want to hang onto a 
teammate for balance. Work on ten repetitions per leg.
 
✓ Sitting leg stretch: Sit on the field with both legs straight and together. 
Bring your chest to your knees and hold for 20 seconds. This exercise 
stretches the backs of your legs as well as your hamstrings.
 
✓ Straddle leg stretch: Sit with your legs spread out flat on the field, 
forming a V, and slowly bend forward from the hips toward one foot. 
Keep your head forward and your back straight, bring your chest to one 
knee, until you feel tension in your hamstrings, and hold for 20 seconds. 
Then move to the other leg.
Hamstring and quad stretches
These leg-stretching exercises are designed to loosen up and improve the 
flexibility of your calf and thigh muscles:
 
✓ Sitting hamstring stretch: Sit on the field and bend your right leg, 
bringing the sole of your right foot to rest on the inside and upper part 
of your left leg. Lean slightly forward, bringing your chest to the left leg 
and stretch the hamstring of the left leg. Hold the stretch for 20 seconds. 
Repeat on the other side.
 
✓ Standing hamstring stretch: In a standing position, put your right leg up 
on a bench in a straight position and bring your chest to your right knee. 
Hold the stretch for 20 seconds. Repeat on the other side.
 
✓ Standing hamstring and calf stretch (iliotibial band stretch): In a 
standing position, cross your right leg over your left leg and then slowly 
bend, moving your hands down toward your left ankle. Hold the stretch 
for 20 seconds. Repeat on the other side.
 
✓ Stork stand: For this quad stretch, stand on your right leg, balancing 
yourself by holding onto a teammate. Grab your left foot near the toes, 
and pull your toes toward your buttocks. Stretch for 20 seconds. Repeat 
on the other side.

176
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
✓ Quad sit: Kneel on the field and then sit down on both legs. Lean back to 
stretch your quads. Hold for 20 seconds.
 
✓ Hurdler’s stretch: Start in a sitting position. Straighten your right leg in 
front of you, and bend your left knee, bringing your left leg behind you. 
Slowly lean back to stretch your left leg’s front thigh (the quad). Hold for 
20 seconds. Then slowly lean forward while grasping the right foot, to 
stretch your right leg’s back thigh (the hamstring). Hold the stretch for 
20 seconds. Repeat on the other side.
 
✓ Achilles stretch: This exercise works on your calf muscles. Stand a little 
away from a wall and lean on it with your hands, bending your right leg 
and placing your left leg straight behind you. Slowly move your hips 
forward until you feel a stretch in your left calf. Keep your left heel on 
the ground. Hold the stretch for 20 seconds. Repeat on the other side.
Abdomen and groin stretches
These stretching exercises will improve your flexibility, which can come in 
handy when you reach for loose balls or create an awkward shot opportunity:
 
✓ Crunches: This exercise stretches your abdominal muscles. Lying on 
your back with your knees bent and your feet on the field, pull yourself 
up into a sit-up position, holding briefly in a 45-degree angle to the field 
before lying back down. Start with one set of 25 crunches, and work up 
to a set of 100. Add more sets as your routine becomes more advanced.
 
✓ Sitting straddle stretch: Sit with your legs spread out flat on the field, 
forming a V, and slowly lean forward at the hips bringing your chest 
toward the ground until you feel a slight pull in your groin and hamstring 
area. Keep your back straight and hold this stretch for 20 seconds.
 
✓ Groin sit: Sit with your knees bent and your heels together. Use your 
elbows to press your knees toward the field. Stretch until you feel 
tension in the inner thigh or groin area, and hold for 20 seconds.
 
✓ Forward lunge: Also for the groin and hamstring, this exercise starts 
from a standing position. Lunge forward with your right foot, and then 
push the hip of your left leg forward. Hold for 20 seconds. Switch legs 
and repeat.

177
 Chapter 12: Becoming a Better Lacrosse Player — Physically and Mentally
Stretching your neck and shoulders
Designed to loosen up your neck and shoulders, these exercises work well for 
reducing tension — both physical and mental:
 
✓ Shoulder stretch #1: Wrap your right arm around in front of your neck 
as your left arm presses the right elbow back. Hold for 20 seconds. 
Repeat on the other side.
 
✓ Shoulder stretch #2: Reach over your head and down the back with 
your right arm as your left arm presses down at the elbow. Hold for 20 
seconds. Repeat on the other side.
 
✓ Shoulder stretch #3: Reach straight backward with both arms and press 
both arms upward toward your back. Hold for 20 seconds.
 
✓ Neck stretch: Tilt your head to the left, stretching the right side of your 
neck. Hold that position for 5 seconds. Then tilt your head to the right, 
holding that position for 5 seconds. Repeat six times (for a total of three 
times per side).
Stretching for speed during and before the season
Some stretching exercises not only can be 
targeted to certain activities but also provide 
your body with an opportunity to loosen up and 
prepare for a workout. Here are a few exercises 
to help you increase your running speed for a 
game:
 ✓ High-knee marching: In this drill, you try to 
improve your high-knee drive (your ability 
to lift your knee as high as possible on 
each stride), which you need when you 
accelerate during a game. Drive your knee 
upward, thigh parallel to the ground, and 
repeat on the other side. Keep your feet 
moving quickly. Try this drill for 20 yards 
with a marching or skipping motion.
 ✓ High knee with straight leg reach: With 
your legs straight, run while trying to extend 
your stride length. Keep your legs straight 
and your knees locked, pushing back off 
the ground. Focus on driving forward off 
the ground. Try this drill for 20 yards.
 ✓ Heel kicks: Run 20 yards aggressively, 
focusing on how rapidly your feet move to 
touch your buttocks with your heels. Keep 
your toes pointed, try to keep your upper leg 
from moving, and run with a slight forward 
lean and proper arm action.
 ✓ Shuffle: Across a 10-foot-wide section 
of the field, shuffle, focusing on lateral 
movement and low hip strength. If you work 
on keeping your center of gravity low, you 
can change direction more quickly.

Running for Top Physical Conditioning
You have to run both long and short distances in lacrosse because of the 
nature of the game. All that running requires you to stay in running shape 
with long-distance conditioning, sprint conditioning to increase speed, and 
endurance training. This section offers advice for this kind of training.
 
Although you can run for game-shape conditioning at any time during the 
year, long-distance and endurance training are best reserved for the off-season 
or during pre-season training, and conditioning for speed is ideal for in-season 
workouts.
Off-season and pre-season conditioning
A typical off-season lacrosse program may include a two-hour workout for 
total conditioning: 30 minutes of stretching, 30 minutes of weight training 
(strength training), 30 minutes of distance running (aerobic activity), and 30 
minutes of sports activity (basketball, field hockey, lacrosse).
Long-distance and endurance conditioning
Long-distance running is what you do first to build up a base for the 
cardiovascular part of the game. By building up your cardiovascular system, 
you can recover quickly so that you can run, rest, and then quickly give it a 
go again. Usually, a good long-distance run lasts from 12 to 15 minutes.
 
Because running is a high-impact exercise, try to run on a soft surface (such 
as grass or field turf) to reduce any potential knee and back problems. Avoid 
running on pavement.
Endurance, or interval, training is good for the off-season and pre-season 
because you can stop and start in the middle of an extended workout. Here’s 
an example of an endurance-training set:
 
✓ Inside single-line run: This is a 10- to 12-minute run around the 
perimeter of a field. If you’re working out with a group of teammates, 
you can add a sprint element by making sure that the player at the back 
of the line sprints to the front of the line after each lap.
 
✓ Outside 1-mile run: Record your time for this shorter long-distance 
run so that you can gauge your improvement. Less than six minutes is 
a fast time. Around seven minutes offers a high-fitness workout. A good 
average time is around eight minutes.
 
✓ Outside 11⁄2-mile run: Do another long-distance run and aim for between 
nine and ten minutes. Anything less than 12 minutes is good.

179
 Chapter 12: Becoming a Better Lacrosse Player — Physically and Mentally
 
✓ Outside 2-mile run: Keep this run to less than 14 minutes for a good 
workout. Remember to record your time.
 
✓ 20-yard shuffle run: Wind down with some 20-yard back-and-forth 
shuffle runs. This is a good run to close an endurance workout with.
 
Endurance training gets you in the best shape possible for training camp. 
Training camp isn’t the place to work yourself into shape. To make a team 
today, you have to be in shape going into training camp to impress the 
coaches.
Sprint conditioning
Speed is in the genes. You either have it or you don’t. But you can increase 
your speed to a certain degree. Here are a few different ways to increase 
running speed during the off-season:
 
✓ Weight training: To develop leg strength for longer strides, work out 
with squats, leg curls, leg extensions, leg presses, dead lifts, and 
step-ups.
 
✓ Resistance training: Also for leg strength (and longer strides), workouts 
may include running uphill, running up steps, running in water, and 
running with weights.
 
✓ Over-speed training: To develop your stride frequency (the number of 
strides in your sprint), try running in sand, running on a treadmill, or 
sprinting on a gradual downhill slope.
 
✓ Plyometrics: Plyometrics are exercises in which muscles are stretched 
with the goal of creating explosive strength through quick movements 
that increase performance. Examples include jumps, hops, and bounding 
exercises, all of which work to contract your muscles more quickly, 
increasing your power.
In-season conditioning
Beyond lacrosse games and practices, your in-season training regimen 
should focus on increasing efficiency — efficiency in endurance, efficiency in 
speed, and efficiency in transitioning between the two.
 
The primary way to achieve maximum efficiency in your workouts is with the 
correct form:
 
✓ Relax your torso, shoulders, hands, and jaw.
 
✓ Lean your upper body slightly forward, but don’t bend at the waist.
 
✓ Swing your arms without crossing the midpoint of the body. The faster 
your arms move, the faster your feet move.

180
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
✓ Keep your head upright and relaxed, focusing straight ahead.
 
✓ Move your feet in a straight line, not inward or outward.
 
✓ Drive your lead leg out and up, not just lifting it upward. Snap your down 
leg back beneath your hips with full extension. You want a pushing 
action off the balls of your feet.
 
✓ Don’t run on your toes. Your body is better at pushing than pulling, so 
make a pushing action with your feet against the ground.
To increase speed efficiency in a lacrosse game, stress short strides to begin 
with, and then, in the open field, generate more speed by opening up your 
stride. You run faster by increasing your stride length and moving your legs 
faster.
You can tailor your interval training during the season to your lacrosse 
practices. Focus the workouts on simulating lacrosse game conditions — that 
is, going for short intensive spurts of activity before a period of rest.
 
The shorter your work period, the higher its intensity should be. With shorter 
work periods, increase your rest or recovery period.
Here are some examples of efficient interval training sessions for endurance, 
power, and speed:
 
✓ Interval endurance training: Run 400 yards in consecutive 40-yard 
increments. This workout is relatively light (about 60 percent maximum 
effort) and should be done in 60 to 70 seconds. Your rest period should 
be about 180 seconds, about a 1:3 work-to-rest ratio. Complete three 
repetitions.
 
✓ Interval power training: This drill increases endurance for repeated 
high-speed sprints and is performed with 100 percent maximum effort. 
Run a 40-yard sprint within 6 seconds. Your rest period is 30 seconds, a 
1:5 work-to-rest ratio. Complete eight to ten repetitions.
 
✓ Interval sprint training: Sprint up and down the playing surface for 40 
to 45 seconds at 75 percent maximum effort. (This workout simulates 
the time and game speed of an average lacrosse game shift.) Rest for 120 
seconds, about a 1:3 work-to-rest ratio. Complete five repetitions.
 
The beauty of interval training is that these variables can be changed to your 
age and level of conditioning. Keep the distance a constant, but you can vary 
the time of the run and rest.

181
 Chapter 12: Becoming a Better Lacrosse Player — Physically and Mentally
 
All in-season drills should focus on keeping in game-shape throughout the 
season. This outcome is best achieved with continuous movement during 
practice, rather than extra conditioning after practice. During the season, 
coaches should avoid conditioning after practice because players may 
hold back during practice if they know they’ll be expected to run later. Try 
motivating your players: If they run an all-out effort during practice, there will 
be no conditioning after practice.
If you do run conditioning drills during in-season practices, here are a few 
tips to keep in mind:
 
✓ Go all-out. All running drills are at full speed and use the full length of 
the field.
 
✓ Set goals. Let your team know how much you’re expecting them to run, 
as well as the number of quality workout repetitions that you expect. Or 
set a time limit for completing certain drills.
 
✓ Toss a ball in the mix. Players run the hardest when a ball is involved 
in the drill. That’s why the best way to prepare for playing lacrosse is to 
scrimmage.
 
✓ Mix things up. Try to change the style, intensity, and order of drills 
conducted during practices, or your players will get bored.
 
✓ Create a challenge. Make your drills challenging and competitive. 
Your players are on the team for a reason — they want to succeed 
in a competitive environment. Try to make your practices almost as 
rewarding in that way as an actual game.
 
If you play three lines, players will go on the field every third shift, so try to 
relate your training to these variables. Make the training demands slightly 
greater than in game situations. Hard practice days should be followed by 
easy practice days or days off during the season. A hard practice should not 
be done on the day before an important game.
 
Recovery from a hard day or a game can take 24 to 48 hours.
Conditioning drills without a ball
Not every drill needs to have a ball to be successful. Here are a few drills to 
run during in-season practices that may be a blast for your team.

182
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Sprints down and back
Run five sprints from one end of the field to the other, adding one sprint if 
any player comes in over a predetermined set time. Use three groups of 
players — fast, medium, and slow — with target times for each group.
Suicide runs down and back
Suicide runs have three stages: Groups of players start at one end of the field 
and run to the first line and back, then to the far line and back, and finally to 
midfield and back. Use three groups of players — fast, medium, and slow — 
with target times for each group. Let your players know ahead of time how 
many repetitions they’ll run, adding one repetition for each time a player 
comes in over a predetermined time.
Variety run
This drill incorporates four separate styles of running. In the end, each 
player will run the length of the field and back twice. Set target times for each 
player.
 
1. Run half the length of the field.
 
2. Run backward back to the other end.
 
3. Zigzag through the cones to the other end.
 
4. Run the length of field chasing loose balls rolled to them.
Conditioning drills with a ball
In this section, we offer some drills to run with a ball.
 
As an alternative to running or other conditioning drills at the end of an 
intense practice, stage brief (three- or four-minute) games without line 
changes.
2-on-0 run and pass
Pair up players to run the length of the field while passing the ball back and 
forth. Each player should call out the receiver’s name when passing, and 
each pass should be thrown after no more than two steps with the ball.
The goal is to keep the ball moving forward (that is, passing in front of the 
other player and not behind or short of the receiver).
5-on-0 run, pass, and shoot
Line up five players across one goal line. The players run down half the 
length of the field and back together, passing the ball from one player to the 
next. When the line reaches just inside the offensive zone, the player who 
controls the ball shoots. The drill continues until every player shoots at least 
once.

183
 Chapter 12: Becoming a Better Lacrosse Player — Physically and Mentally
Shoot and break out on a loose ball
Roll a ball into a corner of the field and send a player after it. The player runs 
the ball down to the other end of the field and shoots on the goalie. Alternate 
left-hand and right-hand shots, switching sides when every player has run the 
drill at least once.
Improving Your Quickness and Agility
Quickness comes into play when you take a speedy first step with which 
you’re able to beat your defender and explosively go by her. This first quick 
step is important because it can get you past your defender or create space 
between you and your defender to be able to take a shot or make a pass.
If you have average speed, however, you may be able to beat your defender 
because of your agility, your flexibility, and your ability to change direction 
quickly. You can set up an opponent by making her think you’re going one 
way by your body language and instead you fake and go the other way. This 
kind of flexibility can cause your defender to lean one way while you make 
your offensive move the other way, again creating an opening for a shot or a 
pass.
Quickness and agility are critical to defensive play as well. A quick defender 
is able to react to offensive movement, possibly catching up to an opponent 
who has beaten him. Agility and flexibility on defense can combine with 
smarts to anticipate when an offensive player may try to beat you to the 
punch.
This section offers some quickness and agility drills to improve your 
offensive and defensive games.
Offensive drills
These drills work on your footwork and foot speed, skills required for quick 
and agile movement on the lacrosse playing surface:
 
✓ Faking: While jogging around the field, take short, quick steps in an 
opposite direction. Push right, step left, and then push left, step right.
 
✓ Pivoting (for a left-shot player): Fake right with your right foot, step 
inside with your left foot, pivot (or spin) on your left foot while pulling 
your right foot over your left foot, and then go left.
 
✓ Pivoting (for a right-shot player): Fake left with your left foot, step 
inside with your right foot, pivot (or spin) on your right foot while 
pulling your left foot over your right foot, and then go right.

184
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
✓ Agility obstacle run: Run up and down the field through and around 
cones. You can add faking drills to this run as well.
 
✓ Sprints: Set up a cone about 12 feet from the sideline. Run back and 
forth from the cone to the sideline, touching the sideline marker with 
your stick. Run in 30-second repetitions.
 
✓ Agility square: Start in a corner and run down the field for a pass, 
making a one-on-one move across the top of the zone. Then after a pass, 
make a V-cut to the crease area to set a cross pick before rolling back to 
the original corner for another pass.
Defensive drills
To improve footwork, most defensive drills deal with lateral action, footwork, 
communication, and quickness. Make your drills short, quick, and hard.
Footwork drills
Some examples of footwork drills are running backward (up and down the 
length of the field) and carioca (crossover runs facing the sideline and down 
the length of the field).
The wave drill
The team reacts to the direction in which the coach points. Your reaction 
motions should be step and slide down and back or drop-step and slide 
across. Work on keeping your knees bent and maintaining a proper defensive 
stance.
The shadow drill
With a partner, one player mirrors the other for 10 seconds. This drill can be 
a non-contact drill (the stick handler moves side to side and can’t beat the 
defender) or a contact drill (the stick handler works the defender but can’t 
beat him).
Defensive square drills
To work on lateral motion, agility, and quickness, place four cones to mark a 
square that equals the distance a player would move during a game. You can 
run this drill clockwise or counterclockwise. Do four repetitions or target a 
set time.
Here are a few types of square drills you can run:

185
 Chapter 12: Becoming a Better Lacrosse Player — Physically and Mentally
 
✓ Facing the same direction at all times, backpedal, shuffle, sprint forward, 
and shuffle from cone to cone to complete a square.
 
✓ Shuffle down to the first cone in a defensive stance (facing the boards). 
Open your stance and shuffle across to the next cone (facing the goal). 
Turn and run up the sideline to the third cone, changing to a shuffle for 
the last two steps. Close out the drill by shuffling back across to the 
original cone.
 
✓ Starting in the middle of the square, run to a corner and backpedal back 
to the middle. Repeat with all four corners. You can run the same drill 
with sprints or slides back and forth from middle to corner.
Getting into Shape with Weights
Strength is one of the keys to success in today’s lacrosse, and strength can 
best be developed through a properly organized weight-training program. 
You’re hit when you’re going after ground balls. You’re checked hard across 
your upper body and arms to stop you from going to the net. You’re stopped 
from cutting toward the goal. And you’re required to sprint to the other 
end of the field to score. In all these situations, weight training will help you 
improve your performance by increasing your endurance, flexibility, agility, 
running speed, and overall physical strength. Besides improving all these 
qualities, weight training helps to prevent injuries.
Weight training works on the overload principle. You demand a muscle to 
do something it doesn’t want to do by increasing the amount of weight or 
increasing the number of repetitions that you can do.
 
What you do during the off-season determines what you do during the season, 
and a solid off-season training program should include weight training. (Many 
players don’t regularly lift during the season because of the physical demands 
of games and practices — to say nothing of being stretched for time.) As with 
any training that you take on, keep a record or chart to gauge your progress, 
as well as to motivate you to greater heights.
For more information about training with weights, check out Weight Training 
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Liz Neporent and Suzanne Schlosberg (Wiley).
 
Here are some tips to keep in mind when weight training:

186
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
✓ Repeat consistent repetitions. Start with enough weight to do about 
eight reps each set, working your way up to ten reps. Repeat each 
exercise eight to ten times, working with 75 percent of your maximum 
weight (the most weight you’re capable of lifting for a single repetition 
of a given exercise). After you can complete ten repetitions without 
straining too much, increase the weight. It’s important to work with the 
weight that’s best for you — not too heavy yet challenging enough to 
make you work.
 
✓ Train in sets. You may want to start with one set, and then progress, 
working up to three sets. Some people recommend one set to total 
fatigue. A set is doing one type of exercise for eight to ten reps.
 
✓ Maintain consistency in your order of exercises. Start with the largest 
muscle groups first (shoulders, back, abdomen, chest, quadriceps, and 
calves), and then work with the smallest muscle groups (shoulders, 
arms, and ankles).
 
✓ Lift with proper form. The technique must be correct, slow, controlled, 
and smooth. Concentrate on your form and don’t cheat, such as arching 
your back when bench-pressing in order to get more leverage or 
bouncing or swinging the weight when doing arm curls. Lift weights up 
in 2 seconds and lower weights down in 4 seconds.
 
✓ Breathe consistently. Some people recommend no scheme to breathing 
when lifting weights, but say you just shouldn’t hold your breath. Others 
recommend that you breathe in while raising the weights or working 
the muscles and breathe out while you lower the weights. Whatever you 
choose to do, do it the same way every time.
 
✓ Raise and lower the weight through a full range of motion. This 
maintains or increases flexibility, which is important for preventing 
injuries.
 
✓ Take time between exercises. In a weight-training program, if you’re 
working on endurance, cut down your recovery time to 15 to 45 seconds 
between exercises, or even no rest. If you’re working on strength, rest 
for one to two minutes between exercises.
 
✓ Maintain a consistent training schedule. During the off-season, you can 
train three times a week on alternate days. Your muscles need time to 
recover and grow. An alternative that some players practice is to train 
six days a week by working the upper body one day and the lower body 
the next day.
 
 During the season, you can train two times a week to maintain if you 
have the time, but be careful, because rest is important during the 
playing season.
 
✓ Manage your training time. Spend no longer than 45 minutes (for 
endurance training) to one hour (for strength training) in the weight 
room. It’s a good idea to work in teams so that one of you can be a 
spotter, and you can push each other.

187
 Chapter 12: Becoming a Better Lacrosse Player — Physically and Mentally
 
Here are some standard weight-training exercises that you can start with for 
both the upper and lower body:
 
✓ Crunch (for abdominal muscles): Lie on your back on a mat, knees bent, 
and feet flat on the ground with your fingers lightly touching your ears. 
Slowly curl your torso until your shoulder blades leave the mat. Hold 
this position a few seconds, and then lower slowly back down to the mat.
 
✓ Bench press (for chest muscles): Lie on an exercise bench with your 
knees bent so your feet are flat on the ground. Grasp the barbell from 
the rack with your hands slightly wider than shoulder width apart. 
Slowly lower the barbell to your chest, and then press the barbell up 
until your arms are fully extended.
 
✓ Military press (for shoulder muscles): Sitting at the end of the bench, 
grasp the barbell, and plant your feet firmly on the ground. Lift the 
weight over your head and rest it on the back of your shoulders; push 
the bar up to arm’s length, and then lower it to the starting position and 
repeat.
 
✓ Bicep curl (for bicep muscles): In a standing position, hold the barbell 
with an underhand grip, allowing it to rest against your thigh. Slowly 
bring the bar up to your chest, bending your elbows but keeping your 
upper arms motionless against your sides. Hold the bar against your 
chest and then slowly lower it to the starting position.
 
✓ Lat pull-down (for back muscles): Grasp the bar at the lat pull-down 
station of a weight machine with your hands 3 feet apart, and then sit 
down, allowing your arms to extend overhead. Pull the bar down slowly 
until it touches the back of your neck right above your shoulders, and 
then return to the starting position.
 
✓ Squat (for quads and buttocks): In a standing position, grip a barbell 
and place it across your shoulders, behind your head. Holding the bar 
and placing your hands shoulder-width apart, slowly squat down until 
your upper thighs are parallel to the ground, and then return to the 
original position. Make sure you keep your head up and your back 
straight.
 
✓ Leg curl (for hamstrings): Sit in the curl machine placing your heels on 
top of the footpad. To get support, hold onto the front or side of the 
machine. Curl your legs (that is, bring your heels toward your buttocks), 
and then slowly let the weights come back up to the original position.
 
✓ Leg extension (for quads): Sit in the leg-extension machine with your 
feet under the footpad, raise the weight stack until your legs are parallel 
to the ground, and return it to the starting position.

Mentally Preparing for Lacrosse
Because lacrosse is such a physically demanding sport — whether it’s the 
endurance and stamina required for a field lacrosse contest or the quick 
turns and body banging of a box lacrosse game. Up to this point, the focus of 
this chapter has been on physical readiness, but being ready to play lacrosse 
takes more than just physical strength. As in any sport, mental toughness is 
more than just a hackneyed cliché — it’s a requirement.
How you mentally approach lacrosse — whether it’s your approach before 
a game or before a practice — is an important factor in how well you’ll play. 
For some players, preparing mentally may mean little more than going over a 
checklist of emotions and expectations before a game:
 
✓ Do I have the proper attitude or outlook?
 
✓ Am I calm and composed?
Eating and sleeping your way to game shape
What you eat and how you sleep affect the way 
you play. Good nutrition alone is not enough 
to produce a winner, but poor nutrition may 
be enough to keep you from being a winner. 
Athletes have to eat a balanced diet every day. 
Recovery is also critical to help you restore 
your energy — and the best recovery starts 
with a good night’s sleep.
Here are a few eating and sleeping tips to keep 
in mind to help you achieve your best on the 
lacrosse field:
 ✓ Stay hydrated. Water has more impact on 
performance than any of the foods you eat. 
The biggest mistake that players make is to 
wait until they’re thirsty to drink. You should 
drink throughout the day, regardless of 
whether you’re thirsty. Drink a considerable 
amount of juices, water, or sports drinks 
before, during, and after a lacrosse game 
or practice. Aim for at least eight glasses of 
water each day.
 ✓ Eat a simple, balanced diet that leans to 
the low side in fat content and to the high 
side in carbohydrates. (Carbohydrates help 
you increase endurance.) And stay away 
from junk foods.
 ✓ Eat and drink every two hours whenever 
possible. Aim for four to six meals per 
day, but eat lightly — for example, three 
moderately sized meals plus two to three 
snacks each day. Eat more frequently, but 
in smaller portions.
 ✓ Try for eight or more hours of sleep every 
night, especially during the season. Don’t 
underestimate the value of a nice catnap. 
During the season, short naps (10 to 15 
minutes) will leave you feeling energized 
and refreshed.

189
 Chapter 12: Becoming a Better Lacrosse Player — Physically and Mentally
 
✓ Do I feel optimistic?
 
✓ Am I self-confident?
 
✓ Am I alert and totally focused?
 
✓ Am I ready to have fun?
Other players, however, may need some additional help to prepare mentally 
for a game. This section discusses a few approaches.
Setting goals
By setting long-term personal goals, or outcome goals, you can become more 
self-motivated. For example, you may want to be recognized as the best 
player or the best defender on your team or in your league. If you’re motivated 
to do your best to achieve this goal, you can get mentally ready to play more 
easily. Outcome goals can also help you get over the rough spots that every 
player faces during a long season; short-term disappointments are overcome 
by long-term outcome goals.
These long-term outcome goals, of course, are nothing more than a whole 
bunch of short-term goals strung together. Your short-term goals may be 
performance or behavior goals. Either way, you’re setting a bar for yourself 
for the outcome of a game or practice. For example, a short-term performance 
goal may be to score two or three goals in a game. As well as competing 
against your opponent, you’re competing against yourself and the achievement 
of your short-term goals.
 
Coaches may want to have their players create personal plans so that they’re 
aware of goal-setting strategies to help them prepare to play.
Practicing relaxation
Athletes often fail to achieve their best performance because they’re too 
tight, anxious, or stressed out. Of all the human emotions, nervousness is the 
greatest enemy of achievement. You can’t eliminate pressure situations — 
they’ll always be there because they’re a natural part of a lacrosse game. If 
you’re prepared to play, however, the game won’t be a stressful situation and 
you’ll have “good pressure” as a result.
Good pressure heightens your senses, makes you more focused and motivated, 
and helps you play to your maximum potential. Understanding your response 
to that kind of pressure is one of the best ways to relax in preparation of a 
game.

190
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
Relaxation can help during a game as well. “Give it all you got” is one of the 
real myths in sports; in reality, giving it all you’ve got usually leads to tension, 
stress, and anxiety, slowing down your decision-making skills and hindering 
your performance. As you perform in a game, relax. A relaxed body and mind 
are characteristic of all great players.
In the following sections, we cover the various ways you can relax.
Relaxing with a proper attitude
You create your own pressure by the way you look at a situation and by 
what you say to yourself about it. Play down the importance of the outcome 
of a game. Approach each game as a welcome opportunity for success and 
challenge rather than as dreaded threats. You get “good pressure” if you look 
at the game as an opportunity to feel the joy of playing a great game against a 
worthy opponent.
 
Your anxiety level rises if you put a life-or-death price tag on the outcome of a 
game. In reality, no loss or setback from a game will ruin your life.
Relaxing by tightening and relaxing your muscles
Proper deep breathing and muscle-relaxing exercises help you feel loose 
and calm, relax your muscles, and energize yourself. This strategy involves 
just tensing and relaxing your muscles, which helps your muscles loosen up. 
Some players like to shake their arms to feel relaxed. You could also tighten 
and loosen your grip on your stick until you feel the level that’s just right.
Relaxing with deep breathing
A small amount of pre-game excitement and anticipation is healthy and 
necessary to get you ready to play a game. But how do you know if you’re 
too excited? Breathing is the first step to recognize your level of arousal. So 
before the game, check out your breathing.
Because stress influences breathing, be on the lookout for short, shallow 
breathing. Focus instead on inhaling slowly and deeply through your nose, 
filling your lungs and diaphragm as completely as possible. Then focus on 
your exhalation as you relax any muscle tension in your body, letting the air 
out slowly through your mouth.
 
The exhale is what relaxes you and reduces stress, which in turn increases 
performance.

191
 Chapter 12: Becoming a Better Lacrosse Player — Physically and Mentally
Visualizing your way to success
Visualization should be a part of mental preparation for every lacrosse 
player. There is a direct correlation between the mind and the physical body. 
You visualize in your mind how you want to play in the upcoming game, and 
when you have that in mind, the physical body just seems to take over.
Before a game, visualize yourself playing a perfect game. You want to visualize 
success, such as beating your defender, scoring a goal, or stopping your 
opponent’s goal scorer. The more real the experience in your mind, the more 
effective your performance will be.
Visualization works because it acts like a practice or dress rehearsal before 
the game. So when the time comes for the real game, you have a sense that 
you’ve already done this before.
 
Most players who visualize imagine all the good things that can happen in the 
game. But the top players also visualize all the bad things that can happen and 
how they’ll handle them.
Paying attention to self-talk
What do you say to yourself before a game? Is it positive or negative, or do 
you not talk to yourself at all? To get into the correct playing mental zone you 
have to be positive, you have to think you can do it.
The good lacrosse players know that if they don’t learn to control their 
thoughts, their thoughts will control them. Self-talk is basically the skill of 
replacing a negative inner voice that hurts your performance with a positive 
inner voice that will help you perform better. 
If your thoughts are positive and focused, you’ll increase your performance 
state. Positive self-talk helps you get into the zone by making you feel good, 
feel optimistic, focus on your performance, feel confident, feel energized and 
alert, and feel calm and physically relaxed.
 
If you want to be a good player, you have to learn to play hurt, play when 
fatigued, and play when you don’t feel like it. Great players talk themselves 
into playing their best when they feel their worst.

192
Part II: Playing Lacrosse 
 
You can also use self-talk to relax yourself. If you feel you’re trying too hard or 
tensing up, just tell yourself something like “relax,” “just let it happen,” “let it 
flow.” You can even talk out loud or give yourself a pep talk. For some players, 
talking out loud seems to help more than just talking in their heads.
 
The speed and tone of your voice is as important as what you say. Talking 
rapidly with a harsh tone will tighten your muscles. Talking slowly and in a 
low tone can relax you.
Some players also find that talking to the opposition helps them to stay 
relaxed.
Controlling your emotions
One player gets upset over a bad call and comes out on his next shift playing 
brilliantly. Another player might get upset over something and retaliate. Both 
players get upset, yet one handled it well, and the other didn’t. Know your 
hot buttons (what gets you upset and makes you lose your temper). Hot 
buttons can hurt your performance because powerful negative emotions 
weaken your decision-making ability.
You may not make the hot button go away, but you can learn to cope with 
the situation. Instead of allowing the situation to control you, you can control 
the response you choose. The best way to deal with getting upset is to be 
prepared for it. A self-control strategy is to make a list of adversities and 
visualize how you’ll react to them.
Have you ever seen a perfect game? There will always be setbacks, adversities, 
and mistakes in any game and in any season. By planning ahead and anticipating 
problems, you’ll feel confident that you can handle any unexpected situations. 
Think about all the things that could go wrong and imagine how you would 
handle them. Problems could happen before the game, in a hotel room or at 
home, on the bus, in the arena, just before the game, while warming up in the 
arena, as you step on the field for warm-up, during the game, or at the very 
end of the game. So the trick is to expect the unexpected and try to prepare 
for it.
Focusing on the game
Some players walk around before a game in a trancelike state. What they’re 
doing is focusing on their performance and thinking about the game. When 
you focus, you force everything out of your mind except your preparation 
and your performance to minimize as many distractions as possible before 
the game. You have to focus to avoid the invasion of self-defeating thoughts, 
such as worry, doubt, and fear, and to enter the game with your own positive 
thoughts.

193
 Chapter 12: Becoming a Better Lacrosse Player — Physically and Mentally
Focusing on what you’re doing
Focus your attention on your performance rather than on any desired 
outcome. Focus your attention on what you can control, which is your 
performance, rather than on things you can’t control, such as winning. Just 
think about doing your best and losing yourself in your performance.
 
Concentration is the ability to focus all your attention on what you’re doing in 
the present moment, not what happened two plays ago, and not what’s going 
to happen in the next two minutes.
Trying not to force concentration
Mental preparedness includes being in tune with what’s happening on the field 
and fitting into the flow of the action. When in this zone, you just let your focus 
happen. If you try too hard to focus, your performance deteriorates, especially 
when things are going badly: You think too much, you start to force things to 
happen, you play uptight, and end up getting yourself into more trouble.
 
When a player is playing well, she isn’t really thinking about anything; she’s 
just doing what comes naturally.
Focusing on the positive
You’ll perform better by thinking or focusing on what you have to do instead 
of on what you don’t want to do. If you think negatively, such as “I’m not 
going to throw the ball away,” that thought of not committing an error 
focuses your mind on committing the error, thereby directing the body to do 
just that. If you focus positively, such as “I’m going to hit my teammate’s stick 
high and outside,” that thought helps your mind to concentrate on a relaxed, 
positive focus — your teammate’s stick.
Blocking out distractions
To stay mentally alert during an entire lacrosse game takes full concentration. 
You have to work at it to shut everything out and dismiss all stray thoughts 
from your mind except what you have to do. You can’t have any momentary 
lapses, so you must play as if every ground ball, every one-on-one confrontation 
is important. You must concentrate on not letting your mind wander.
 
Be sure to focus on the here and now when playing in a game and not get caught 
up in the next game or even a big upcoming game next week or next month.

Energizing yourself going into a game
If you’re feeling sluggish or fatigued before a game, you likely have some nervous 
pent-up energy. Physical activities can get the circulation going and pump 
yourself up; try jumping up and down, skipping, or stationary biking. You may 
find that these physical activities will wake you up and make you more alert.
 
You get energy by using energy.
Try listening to upbeat music while you visualize or breathe or practice some 
other mental preparation. Whatever the activity, your goal is to get your 
heart pumping and excited for the upcoming challenge.
Establish a pre-game routine
Jitters and butterflies will always be there 
before a game. Nervousness keeps you alert, 
but it could result in nervous exhaustion if 
you don’t learn how to control it. You need a 
pre-game routine to help you relax before a 
game, to get rid of nervousness and butterflies, 
and to help you energize if you aren’t in a ready 
state to play.
Keep the same pre-game routine for every 
game. This approach prevents panic if things 
start going wrong. You should have a ritual — a 
warm-up routine to take control of your mental 
state and get rid of any negative distractions 
and thoughts. For example, what can happen 
before a big game? Players panic and change 
their approach to the game. A major cause of 
failure in the big game is altering your routine. 
You have to establish a pre-game routine that 
feels comfortable for you and then stick to it, no 
matter what happens.
So what is your routine? Do you take a nap? 
Do you eat a certain pre-game meal? Do you 
get dressed in a certain order? Do you never 
wash your socks and underwear until the end 
of the season? Do you have a special pre-game 
warm-up?
Are these idiosyncrasies, habits, good 
luck charms, superstitions, rituals, or just 
eccentricities? Call them what you will, they 
work. Some players like to be quiet; others like 
to be loud, joke around, and be chatty. Some 
players like to seclude themselves and listen to 
quiet music; others like to listen to loud music. 
Some have a plan to keep busy right up to game 
time to keep themselves from getting nervous. 
Some have developed a ritual of putting on 
their equipment in a certain order. Others just 
get dressed quickly and put on their equipment 
in any order. Some like to energize by doing 
physical exercises such as push-ups, jumping, 
skipping, or riding a stationary bike. Some like 
to relax by doing deep breathing and muscle 
relaxation.
Then there are others who want to watch the 
video of the opposition to look for habits and 
weaknesses. Some players go through the 
mental preparation strategies of relaxation and 
visualization, imagining their best games in their 
mind. Others get themselves ready to play by 
telling themselves how they want to feel and 
play.

S
uccessful coaches have all kinds of different techniques. There are 
motivators, disciplinarians, sympathizers (so-called “players’ coaches”), 
those known for their X’s and O’s (great strategists), delegators, or micro-
managers. But unsuccessful coaches in any sport have also had some or all 
of these traits, too. What sets the successful coaches apart from their peers 
is the ability to match the players on their team to a style of play that gives 
their team the best opportunity to win.
This chapter introduces the fundamentals of coaching as simply that: 
selecting the best players available and creating a system that will take the 
fullest advantage of their skills. We also offer a few tips about coaching kids, 
as well as methods for building team unity.
Determining Your Team’s Style of Play
What style of play do you want your team to use? Should you run or should 
you slow down the game? Should you play a tough, physical style or a quick, 
finesse style? Do you need to score a lot of goals or can you keep the score in 
a game low? These are some of the questions you need to be able to answer 
in order to succeed as a coach.

198
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
If you have the luxury of determining a style of play and then going out to 
recruit players who fit this style, fantastic. But the more likely scenario is 
that you’re given a team of players, and you have to develop a style of play 
that fits their individual strengths. For example, you may not have the biggest 
team around, but you may have the smartest, and your “overpower-them” 
strategy quickly becomes your “outwit-them” strategy.
 
If you coach high school or youth lacrosse, you may be able to seek out kids 
who fit into your system and convince them that lacrosse is a great sport to 
play!
No matter how you build your team, you still need to determine a style of 
play so that every player is playing from the same page of your playbook. 
Here are of the two main offensive styles that you may consider:
 
✓ Transition/aggressive: These teams rely on fast breaks and getting 
scoring opportunities off changes of possession, including ground balls 
and faceoffs. Defensively, they’re usually aggressive in checking the 
opposing stick handler. This style is generally favored by athletic teams 
that have speed and depth.
 
✓ Deliberate/ball control: Generally employed by teams that are 
fundamentally sound but lack speed and depth. Offensively, these teams 
usually run patient sets that chew time off the clock — sometimes 
bordering on stalling. Defensively, they often employ zones to make up 
for their lack of quickness, which could be exploited in a man-to-man set.
 
Effective coaching comes down to this: Put the players you have into a style of 
play that brings out the most in all of them so that they’re in the best possible 
position to succeed.
 
Jeff Brameier, who has won more than 400 games and coached more than 
50 all-Americans in 24 years as varsity coach at Darien High School in 
Connecticut, sums up his coaching philosophy: “Offensively and defensively, 
we like to consider ourselves multidimensional, meaning we don’t like to allow 
our opponents to be comfortable in knowing exactly what they’ll face when 
they compete against us. Offensively, we like to be very up-tempo and believe 
that it is important to get your shots. We like to have scoring balance and 
usually have four or five guys every year that hit the 80-point mark. Defensively, 
we’re quick and aggressive, but we rely a lot on our athleticism and great 
goaltending. Again, we run a complex offensive and defensive scheme which 
makes it more difficult to prepare to play us.”

199
 Chapter 13: Fundamentals of Coaching Lacrosse
Building Your Team
After you decide the type of system you’d like to try to run, you need to start 
looking for players who will best fit into that system. Look for players who 
have the skills necessary to achieve success in your style of play, as well as 
the game sense to recognize opportunities to both press forward and hold 
back with that style of play.
Regardless of what style of play your team focuses on, you also need to 
build a team that has some overall balance. If you’re coaching a quick, fast-
breaking team, you still need to have a few bigger players who can counteract 
those opponents who play a tough, hard-hitting, grind-it-out kind of game. If 
your top goal scorer is a right-handed shooting player, try to add a couple 
of strong left-handed shooting players so that you can run plays that feature 
scoring options from both sides of the goal.
 
When selecting your players, think about building your team in stages. If 
you’re allowed 21 players on your team, decide first — based on your style 
of play — what skills you must have from your top 7 players, how your middle 
7 players will support your best players, and how your last 7 players will 
contribute:
 
✓ Finding the cream of the crop: Usually, your top players are going 
to carry the team offensively. They’ll be responsible for most of your 
scoring and will need to be quick enough to stay away from disruptive 
checks, wily enough to anticipate defensive tendencies, and have the 
field vision to spot an open teammate.
 
✓ Finding players who love the dirty work: Doing the dirty work doesn’t 
(necessarily) mean taking on an opponent physically. Your middle group 
of players needs to have strong fundamental skills that will support your 
top players. These players should be able to play well both on offense 
and on defense. You’re looking for solid, if not great, defenders; occasional 
goal scorers; and players with size and defensive quickness who are 
willing to take one for the team to get a ground ball or slow down an 
opponent.
 
✓ Finding the right blend to complement your best: Based on your 
team’s style of play, you need a few players who have a strong work 
ethic and positive attitude to encourage your best players to stay within 
the system. This group is also where you’ll place any role players or 
specialists, such as a player who gives your team the best chance to win 
any faceoff. Or you may want to use this group to add players who are 
athletic enough to play any position on the team, giving you a bit of 
flexibility in case you lose a player or two to injury.

200
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
 
When you’re analyzing individual players, look at the following:
 
✓ Athletic ability: You want players who play hard, run hard, and rely 
on their conditioning. Look for athletic players who have quickness, 
strength, and endurance. For some players, great athletic potential 
may outweigh poor stick-handling skills, because you can shape that 
potential and teach stick handling.
 
✓ Lacrosse skills: Physical talent is relatively easy to spot and is one of the 
major keys to a team’s success. Players who are fundamentally sound in 
lacrosse skills will succeed on offense, defense, or both.
 
 If a player lacks the sport’s specialized skills, he can still be a solid role 
player who is able to out-hit, out-hustle, and outrun his opponents.
 
✓ Intelligence: Look for players who understand the game, who play 
focused and alert, who make smart plays, and who seem to be aware of 
everything that’s happening on the field.
Developing a Game Plan
The goals of any game are very simple: to play as hard and as well as possible, 
and to try to win the game. Coming up with a plan to achieve those goals, 
however, takes a bit more time and creativity.
Understanding your opponent
Find out everything you can about your upcoming opponent. Who are its 
biggest offensive threats? What are the weaknesses of its defenders? What 
are the tendencies of its goaltender? By understanding what an opposing 
team is likely to do during a game, you can build your game plan to match or 
overcome its strengths.
 
Take advantage of opportunities to scout an opposing team in action, either in 
person or on tape. By watching an upcoming opponent play, you can learn a 
great deal about the team’s tendencies. If you have the game on tape, you can 
watch play after play after play, over and over and over again, and then share 
the tape with your players.

201
 Chapter 13: Fundamentals of Coaching Lacrosse
Concentrating on defense
All great lacrosse teams win because of their defense. Good, flexible defenses 
can succeed against any kind of offense: settled, unsettled, or in between.
 
Defensive skills can be taught more easily than offensive skills. You can teach 
players how to be physical or how to get in position to dish out a good, clean 
hit. You can’t teach players how to acquire a shooter’s touch around the net.
 
Create an atmosphere on your team that rewards great defensive play. It’s 
natural for players to think that the fun part of lacrosse is scoring goals. By 
emphasizing solid defense, you help your players see the fun part of the game 
as stopping an opposing player from scoring goals. Provide incentives for 
hustling defensive play and hard work, creating quantifiable goals that players 
can reach, such as number of ground balls recovered.
Focusing on offense
The great offensive players seem to be born with a “nose for the net.” And 
then there are some players who practice and practice but never get the 
“touch” around the net to score. So if you have players who have difficulty 
scoring, you’d better come up with an offensive system that creates open 
shots, and emphasize that if the shot isn’t there, don’t shoot.
If you have good offensive players, you have a bit more flexibility in creating 
an offensive game plan. After establishing your opponent’s weaknesses, 
you can add set plays to your game plan that will take advantage of those 
weaknesses. If your opposing goalie is a great stick saver, have your shooters 
focus on the corner of the net that’s opposite his stick. And make sure that 
you have a nice mix of long-ball shooters and inside scorers.
 
No matter what your team’s offensive philosophy is, make sure that your 
offensive players always know who their defensive backup is — which player 
goes back on defense when a shot is attempted.
Coaching Lacrosse to Kids: 
What You Need to Succeed
When you’re coaching lacrosse to kids, you need everything from patience 
(it’s a tough game, after all) to the ability to teach them the game. In the 
following sections, we outline all the traits that a good kids’ lacrosse coach 
needs.

202
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
Being a good teacher
You can have plenty of knowledge about lacrosse, but your teaching ability 
will be judged by what your players learn. The most important aspect 
of teaching is being able to transfer knowledge. You may be the most 
knowledgeable coach in the world, but if your players can’t translate that 
knowledge into action, your expertise means nothing. So in addition to 
sharing what your players need to know, make sure that you’re giving them 
the tools they need to know what to do.
 
Your players will learn more if you follow these basic teaching principles:
 
✓ Don’t just dictate — explain. Of course, you need to tell players what 
you want them to do and achieve. But players learn best when they’re 
told what to do, how best to do it, why things need to be done a certain 
way, and what kind of success will come out of it. Be precise, but also be 
explicit.
 
✓ Do as I do, not as I say. Contrary to the well-known axiom, you do want 
your players to do as you do. So you need to be willing to demonstrate 
exactly what you’re asking your players to do. Use your assistant 
coaches, other players, or even parents — just make sure that your 
demonstrations are accompanied by a thorough explanation.
 
✓ Practice, practice, practice. Your players have to translate the knowledge 
they’ve received from your explanations and demonstrations into action 
on the field. Be sure to practice enough repetitions so that your players 
leave the field with confidence in their ability to achieve what you’re 
asking for.
 
✓ Give feedback. Make sure to include both positive and negative feedback. 
You want to reward your players for their successes, as well as give 
them a chance to learn from their mistakes.
 
 Your attitude about mistakes can help create an environment of support 
and security. Because mistakes are an important part of the learning 
process, don’t get upset over them. Instead, present your critical 
feedback with some more positive comments, making sure that players 
understand that mistakes are there to be learned from. Also, don’t 
compare one player to another player — that only pits them against 
each other, which is the opposite of what you want to happen.
Instilling confidence
You need to believe in and see the potential in your players, as well as be able 
to suffer through your players’ growing pains. By doing so, you help your 
players become more confident, which motivates them to play better. The 
skills will come with hard work, preparation, practice, and competition. 
Showing confidence is something that requires your full and constant attention.

203
 Chapter 13: Fundamentals of Coaching Lacrosse
Practicing patience
Setting high standards and having high expectations for your players is great. 
But you also need to be prepared for disappointment when they don’t meet 
those standards and expectations. In other words, expect a lot, but have 
patience.
 
Patience is one of the most important characteristics you need as a coach, 
because kids make many mistakes when they’re learning how to play lacrosse. 
As a youth coach, you have to be a good role model, and the best way to do so 
is to keep your cool during practices and games.
Fostering commitment
If you want to coach a good youth team, your players have to be committed 
to playing their best and playing with respect for the game and other players.
How do you get commitment? Sometimes the easiest way to foster commitment 
is to hold fast to the most important rule on the team: If you miss practice, you 
don’t play. Make sure that your players expect the consequences of breaking 
a rule. The first time that you give in and don’t enforce the consequences, 
you guarantee yourself more problems — from that player, from other players, 
and from all their parents.
 
When a player returns from a missed practice, make sure that you listen fully 
to the player’s explanation, which could be an honest and legitimate excuse, 
before handing out a punishment. If it’s an excusable mistake, then you can 
communicate to the rest of the team whether the player is being penalized 
and why.
Building Team Unity: All 
for One, and One for All
One of the most important abilities in coaching is team building (the ability 
to get players to think and act as one). To help create this atmosphere, each 
team must have a code of conduct that plainly states how the players should 
view the team and treat each other.
 
Establish this code of conduct together with your players in a team meeting. 
These principles get everyone moving in the same direction — together they 
can accomplish much more than a group of individuals who work on their own.

204
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
 
✓ Create a “team comes first” attitude. Teamwork means working 
together. Team agendas replace individual agendas. When the team 
comes first, it doesn’t matter who scores and it doesn’t matter who gets 
the glory; what matters is the team’s success.
 
✓ Provide motivation for cohesion. True motivation comes from a clear 
sense of shared goals and constantly comparing your team to its goals.
 
✓ Have fun together. Make sure that you and your players do more than 
practice together. Make your pre-game and pre-practice stretches a 
required element. Have training-camp breakfast so that players can get 
to know one another.
 
✓ Instill pride. Foster team unity by creating an atmosphere that suggests 
“We are the best.”
The result of a cohesive team is synergy — when the total becomes more than 
the sum of the parts. Synergy is when you put together 20 disparate players 
and they end up playing as if there were 30 of them. Working together as a 
team, a smaller, weaker team can overcome a team that’s bigger and stronger. 
Each player seems to gather strength and energy from his fellow teammates 
to create this extra strength.
Recognizing What Gives 
Your Team the Edge
Many coaching platitudes will tell you that when a team believes it will be 
successful, it can accomplish the impossible. Many teams may approach a 
season with the attitude that they’re going to be successful, but few reach 
their sport’s ultimate pinnacle: a championship.
 
To have an edge in any sport, you have to work for it. Here are a few practical 
and tangible tips that you can stress with your team to try to gain that edge:
 
✓ Perfect your fundamentals. Practice basic skills over and over again 
until your players can execute without thinking.
 
✓ Strive for peak conditioning. Your team’s commitment and responsibility 
to training will require sacrifices, but training also gives the team an 
edge.
 
✓ Go full speed — always. Whether during a game or a practice, in 
pre-game stretches or between-game training, give 100 percent.
 
✓ Work to improve. A good work ethic means little if you can’t use it to 
strengthen your weaknesses.

205
 Chapter 13: Fundamentals of Coaching Lacrosse
 
✓ No pain, no gain. Sure it’s another platitude, but if your players train 
harder and run faster and farther, even to the point of exhaustion, they’ll 
be giant steps ahead of other teams.
 
✓ Accept the hard road. Players don’t cut corners; they don’t cheat on 
laps; they don’t cheat by not touching the lines or the boards; they don’t 
leave early on the whistle. That’s the easy road to take. Your team takes 
the hard road, and it does so with pride.

▶ Putting in place an offensive plan
▶ Going up against the zone defense
▶ Penetrating, moving, or running set plays
▶ Running an effective fast-break offense
▶ Looking at offensive tactics for the women’s game
Your most important decision as a lacrosse coach is to determine what 
type of system to run. By system, we’re referring to a style of play that 
best fits your offensive and defensive strengths — such as an unsettled, 
fast-break style of play or a settled, slow-it-down style of play. The decision 
comes down to either creating a system around the strengths of your players 
or having your players adapt to the system you have in place. Good coaches 
adapt their system to their players’ talents instead of forcing their players to 
play their system, though exceptions do exist.
Another option is to have multiple systems. In other words, tailor your offense 
and defense to the situation or the team you’re playing. In some games, you’ll 
want to play an aggressive, fast-break-style offense. In others, you’ll want to 
be more patient. Having this kind of flexibility makes your team difficult for 
opposing teams to prepare and practice for. But make no mistake: Having 
multiple systems isn’t easy to attain. It requires having coaches who are 
knowledgeable and flexible enough to master different systems, as well as 
players who are able to learn and implement them.
This chapter doesn’t make the system decision for you, but it does help you 
understand what your options are.

208
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
Understanding the General Principles 
of Lacrosse Playing Systems
Good teams have a system they believe in — whether it’s an offensive 
running game or an offensive slow-down game. The most important point is 
to have a system, instead of allowing your players do whatever they want. 
Even if your team has a disciplined playing system, you can also be ready to 
adapt your system to fit the special skills of some of your players or adjust 
your style of play based on the strengths or weaknesses of the opposition.
Looking at offensive playing systems
In this section, we run through the basics of the two most popular offensive 
playing systems for lacrosse — fast-break offense and slow-down offense. 
Whether you’re new to coaching a team and you’re looking for the playing 
system that fits your players, or you have the luxury of going out and finding 
players to fit the system that works best for you, this information can help 
guide you.
Fast-break offense
The goal of this offense is to move the ball upfield as quickly as possible 
to gain a man advantage. Fast-break offenses thrive in a high-scoring game. 
They’re usually ignited by winning faceoffs, ground balls in the defensive end 
of the field after an opponent’s turnover, or off a quick outlet pass by the 
goaltender. You may also hear this style of play referred to as a running or a 
run-and-gun offense.
 
The fast-break offense is best suited for players with good speed and quickness 
who can move up and down the field quickly and efficiently. In addition, it’s 
also important to have players who are able to release their shots quickly in 
order to execute it effectively.
Slow-down offense
Quite the opposite from a fast-break offense, a team that runs a slow-down 
offense is trying to create a game tempo in which players patiently move the 
ball around before shooting. These offenses usually recognize that they don’t 
have the players to outrun their opponents into their offensive zone, so they 
focus on taking their time and setting up a play that plays to their strengths.
 
Players with a good understanding of both positioning and strategy are 
needed to run an effective slow-down offense. Often, this offense is employed 
by teams that are not quick afoot and who are consequently not as effective 
on fast-break opportunities.

209
 Chapter 14: Developing Your Coaching Philosophy for the Offense
 
Teams that employ the “slow-down” offense are, in effect, trying to patiently 
create and exploit the best matchups that will ultimately result in scoring 
opportunities. This is known as an invert offense. A key aspect of the invert 
offense is to force the midfielders to play behind the goal and the close 
defenders to defend above the goal off ball.
Keeping the system simple
As a coach, try to have a vision, an idea, or a system of exactly how you 
want your team to play and how you want your team to work within that 
style of play. Be clear about the system when you’re talking to your players. 
Tell them exactly what you want from them so that they can be successful. 
Encourage them to voice their opinions, while making it clear that you make 
the final call.
Your best chance for success is to keep your system simple and organized, 
and, where possible, to employ a system that reflects your own personality 
traits, such as competitiveness and stick-to-itiveness. Developing a system 
that reflects your personality can become a motivational tool for you and 
your team. When your coaching personality is known and respected, it may 
also be feared, giving your team a bit of a motivational advantage.
When contrasting styles collide
The 2009 NCAA Division I men’s lacrosse final 
between Syracuse University and Cornell 
University featured an intriguing matchup 
of teams with contrasting styles. Syracuse 
won 10-9 for its second straight national 
championship on a goal by Cody Jamieson 
1:20 into overtime. Cornell dominated the first 
56 minutes of the game, but Syracuse, which 
trailed by three goals late in regulation, rallied to 
force overtime. Syracuse is a classic example 
of a “run and gun”–style team. The Orange like 
to push the ball, push the pace of the game, and 
fast break because of their athletic and creative 
players.
How did Cornell, a big underdog entering 
the game, come within an eyelash of pulling 
out what would’ve been its first national title 
since 1977? By perfectly executing a patient, 
ball-control offense fueled by the Big Red 
gaining possession of the ball through excellent 
play in the faceoff circle and through controlling 
ground balls. (John Glynn, a senior all-
American, won ten faceoffs and came away 
with nine ground balls.)
Syracuse was able to create a frenetic pace 
much more to its liking late in regulation, 
benefiting from turnovers and a failed clear, 
before rallying to tie it with 4.5 seconds left in 
the fourth quarter on a wild scramble in front 
of the net. Syracuse’s late comeback showed 
just how quickly a potent, fast-break offense 
can decide a game, even though it has been 
contained or neutralized for the majority of a 
game.

210
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
 
If you’re the coach of a varsity team that relies on feeder teams, such as junior 
varsity squads, implement the same system at those levels as well. This gives 
players time to get acclimated and adjusted to it before moving up to the team 
at the higher level. It’s extremely advantageous to have continuity in game 
concepts throughout the levels of a program. A successful high school coach 
is usually very involved in his youth program.
 
Study other successful programs and different levels and see what systems 
they run and how those systems complement the talents of their players. 
When you decide on a system, your job isn’t done. You have to continually 
look to improve on it by observing how other programs that use the same 
system have made additions and adjustments to it.
As you continue to study and fine-tune the system you use, you have to keep 
it simple and readily understandable for players. Simplicity gives players 
the freedom to focus and stay in the present moment while they perform, 
giving them the best chance to make big plays. Also, by keeping your system 
simple, when it comes time to change the game plan, you can tweak things 
more quickly and easily than you can if you employ complicated schemes.
 
Organization helps players know where to go and what to look for when 
seeking guidance about an element of your system. Whether it’s in the form of 
a game or practice plan written out on the locker-room chalkboard or a 2-inch-
thick binder complete with set plays for any game situation and tips about 
what to eat before a game, your players will always know there’s a place to 
look to gets answers to their questions.
Systems help players perform as a team. In a disciplined system, players 
know where they’re supposed to be and what they’re supposed to do. The 
players can anticipate more quickly because they know what’s going to 
happen before it happens.
 
Here are factors to consider when deciding what type of system to employ:
 
✓ The characteristics of the team as a whole: Are the players aggressive 
and physical by nature? Do they rely on their athleticism rather than 
their stick skills?
 
✓ The characteristics of the team’s units: Is this attack quick and small or 
big and slow? Is the midfield athletic or not? Is the defense marked more 
by size or speed? How about that goalie? Is he stronger on perimeter 
shots or shots from around the crease?
 
✓ Your players’ preferences: Listen to your players: What are their 
thoughts? Do they think one system takes better advantage of their skills 
individually and as a unit? If not, why not? Having an open dialogue lets 
them know that it isn’t just your system, but the team’s, and you’re all in 
it together.

 Chapter 14: Developing Your Coaching Philosophy for the Offense
If you believe your system is flexible enough to adjust to athletes of varying 
skills and abilities, then you can make the decision to stick with a system 
year in and year out, and put the right players in the right spot to make it 
all work. If you decide to stick with the same system, allow players time to 
familiarize themselves with it in practice.
 
Adjust as needed. Don’t become a creature of your system. If it’s not working 
and you’ve tried hard to fix it without success, change. If it’s successful 
against some teams, but not others, try something different when necessary.
Setting Up the Offense
The main goal of an offense is to set up a player so that he has a good shot on 
net with the best chance of scoring. How you go about achieving this goal is 
the crux of this section.
Playing to your strengths on offense
You can design offensive set plays and your team can practice them for 
hours, but the true execution on offense depends more on the players’ 
abilities than on the actual play itself.
As a coach, your first job is to analyze the talents of your players and how 
they fit into your offensive scheme. Find out about your players’ offensive 
strengths: Look for the shooters, the passers, the players who are best at 
going one-on-one, the ones who can pick and roll, and even the aggressive 
players (often the ones who come away with the most ground balls). By 
knowing your players’ strengths, you can create an offense to complement 
them.
 
No matter what type of offensive system you run, strive to achieve offensive 
balance — not only in terms of who scores, but in terms of where they score 
from on the field.
Your offense can’t rely on one or two players. You have six players on offense 
at any given time — it’s vital that they all contribute. Some players will be 
more naturally gifted shooters; others will be better dodgers; still others will 
be outstanding passers. Use their strengths and work hard to get contributions 
from all of them. Emphasize to them that they all contribute equally toward 
the team’s success.

212
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
 
You need players who can go one-on-one, cut, and catch the ball in traffic. 
Look to fill these roles first before you design a simple offensive scheme; no 
scheme will be successful without players to fill these roles. Position your 
players on offense at spots from which you think they’re most likely to score. 
This positioning is usually determined by the players’ skills, abilities, size, 
strength, and quickness.
You need an inside-shooting game, with players who aren’t afraid to cut into 
the middle for a pass and shot, knowing that they’ll get hit. You also need 
a perimeter game to draw the defense out of the middle. Effective shooting 
from outside can cause the defense to change its alignment and force it to 
change its game plan.
Establishing your offensive formation
What kind of offensive alignment do teams set up in?
The most common offensive field formations are the 1-3-2, 1-4-1, 2-3-1, and 
2-2-2. In these formations, the first number represents the number of offensive 
players that are set up behind the crease. The remaining numbers indicate 
the rest of the offensive players in the attack zone.
Here’s a look at each:
 
✓ 1-3-2: The most commonly used formation, the 1-3-2 relies heavily on 
cutting and rotating. Two attackmen are in the wing position 4 to 6 yards 
above the goal line on opposite sides. The third attackman is at the X 
position behind the goal. One midfielder is in the crease area, and the 
other two middies are up top.
 
✓ 1-4-1: Screening, cutting, and motion are all key aspects of this set, in 
which one attackman operates behind the cage, two others are in the 
middle of the box crease area with two midfielders on the wings from 2 
to 15 yards above the goal line, and one midfielder up top of the box. It 
creates great spacing that allows players to see defensive slides.
 
✓ 2-3-1: Two attackmen are stationed behind the net with one in the crease 
area. The three midfielders umbrella around the top of the box. This 
formation provides great dodging opportunities for the midfielders 
against short-stick defenders.
 
✓ 2-2-2: Two attackmen are stationed behind the goal area, about 15 yards 
or so apart. In the middle of the restraining box, the other attackman is 
stationed along with a midfielder. The other two midfielders are situated 
toward each respective corner of the box. This formation is an effective 
way to get the ball near the net by providing space for dodging in the 
alleys.

213
 Chapter 14: Developing Your Coaching Philosophy for the Offense
 
These formations are a starting point. As a coach, you should allow for your 
players to move out of the area they start in, but your set will enable you to 
bring organization to the offense.
 
In box lacrosse, here are your offensive formation choices:
 
✓ Strong-side offense: In this formation, three players are lined up on 
one side. The strong-side formation is one that works especially well for 
running offenses. You can create a great deal of player movement off 
this set, having your three strong-side players alternate in and out of the 
center of the zone, looking for an opening for a pass or a shot.
 
✓ 1-2-2: In this formation, the pointman is at the top of the zone. The 1-2-2 
offensive alignment helps your offense maintain floor balance and 
defensive safety. In the 1-2-2, your pointman determines how much 
energy the players on the floor have and then decides which side to 
attack from. At the beginning of a set play in this alignment, the pointman 
stays at the top of the offense but can move anywhere within the zone 
when the offense starts.
Executing your offensive system
Some key concepts apply when you’re trying to effectively execute an 
offense — no matter what type of system you employ:
 
✓ Find the open man. Opposing defenses will sometimes double-team and 
will frequently employ slides, which create plenty of opportunities to 
find a player who is open for a shot. Players need to react quickly and 
pass promptly to take advantage of these opportunities.
 
✓ Don’t try to do too much. Double teams are part of the game. When they 
come, players have to recognize them quickly and react accordingly. That 
means not forcing bad shots or holding onto the ball too long, allowing 
defenders an opportunity to try to strip the ball away and cause a turnover.
 
✓ Know the defense. Offenses need to adjust to what the defense is doing. 
So you need to have schemes in place that you can run against whatever 
you see, whether it be zone, aggressive man-to-man, or specially 
designed defenses. Specially designed defenses — such as shutting off 
or variations of the basketball defenses of a box-and-one and triangle-
and-two — can be especially troublesome for you if you aren’t prepared 
to counter them.
 
✓ Make adjustments. If a defense is shutting off your high-scoring attackman, 
be proactive. If he has the necessary speed, put him at midfield so he’ll 
have the ball before the long pole assigned to him can pick him up. 
This strategy will also allow him to possibly capitalize on fast-break 
opportunities.

214
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
 
✓ Take advantage of mismatches. If you have a balanced offensive attack, 
there will always be short-stick defenders on one or more of your top 
scorers. Take advantage by running plays in which they can exploit the 
opportunity. Do the same if an undersized or slower defense is guarding 
a larger or quicker offensive player.
 
✓ Emphasize balanced scoring. An offensive with many weapons is much 
more difficult to defend than one that relies on just one or two players 
to account for the bulk of the scoring.
 
✓ Make sure that players play to their strengths. Have your strongest 
shooters in position to take the most shots and from the farthest out. 
You don’t want players with weak shots firing away from the perimeter. 
Possessions are valuable — don’t waste them.
 
✓ Take good shots. It’s really pretty simple: If a player is open or going 
against a short-stick defender and has a shot, he should take it. If he’s 
being double-teamed or isn’t in good position to score, he shouldn’t. 
More often than not, the team that takes the most good shots wins the 
game in matchups of teams with comparable talent.
Attacking the Zone Defense 
with a Zone Offense
The reason you run a zone offense is that your opposition is playing a zone 
defense. Effective techniques against a zone including frequent cutting, as 
well as overloading one side of the field. Some coaches even run man-up 
plays against a zone. This helps give players a structured plan of action 
against what can be a difficult defense to get high-percentage shots off 
against.
 
You can use your opponent’s choice of defense as a motivating tool for your 
team. Tell your players that the opposition is playing a zone defense because 
they can’t play you or guard you man-to-man. Now your players will feel good 
about attacking the zone because they know why they’re playing against it.
Because playing a zone offense is more of a reactionary strategy dictated 
by what the defense gives you, this section starts with a brief look at the 
strengths and weaknesses of a zone defense.

215
 Chapter 14: Developing Your Coaching Philosophy for the Offense
Understanding why teams 
play zone defense
In youth lacrosse, you may decide to run zone defenses much of the time 
because they’re easy to teach. You tell a player to play in a certain area of 
the field and not to move out of that area. This also helps cover for players 
whose footwork may not yet be at a level that allows them to backpedal and 
move quickly enough to keep up with quick and elusive offensive players.
However, coaches also know that opponents don’t like to play against zone 
defenses because they have to attack them a little differently from a man-
to-man defense (in which each defender is assigned an offensive player to 
cover).
 
Here are a few of the advantages of going with a zone defense:
 
✓ Zone defenses change the tempo of the game. Zone defenses are 
often difficult to attack because they hinder penetration to the crease 
area. This may result in the offense throwing the ball around because 
it doesn’t feel comfortable taking any of the shots that are available. 
Conversely, at times, the zone may also result in a team tending to 
hurry, which can force bad shots.
 
✓ Defenders in a zone defense are taught to break up the field after an 
opponent’s shot, hoping to set up a fast-break opportunity. This forces 
the faster and better offensive players to play at the top of the zone to 
defend against the breakout.
 
✓ Some teams play zone defense to hide their weak defenders. If 
defenders are assigned to an area of the field rather than to an individual 
player, their own lack of foot speed, for example, may not be nearly as 
evident.
 
✓ In a man-to-man defense, one great offensive player or a solid two-
man offensive game stands a better chance of beating you than in a 
zone defense. A zone defense forces all six offensive players to work 
together instead of letting the best players beat their own defenders.

216
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
Recognizing the weaknesses 
of zone defenses
The major weakness of playing a zone defense is that it doesn’t teach young 
players how to stop an opponent with the ball one-on-one, which is what the 
higher levels of lacrosse are all about.
Here are a few other strategic weaknesses of the zone defense that you may 
be able to exploit as an opposing coach:
 
✓ A zone is set up so that all defenders can see the ball, but they can 
sometimes get so caught up with watching the ball that they forget 
about the offensive player in their zone area who can cut and receive a 
pass and shoot.
 
✓ Because a zone is usually not active, defenders may play flat-footed, so 
they don’t move as quickly as they would when they’re playing on the 
balls of their feet defending an opponent man-to-man.
 
✓ Man-to-man defenses are more conducive in allowing defenders to play 
aggressively, leading to pass interceptions and stripping the ball.
 
✓ If the zone defensive team gets behind in a game, it’s hard for that team 
to catch up, because its style of play encourages the offensive team to 
play more deliberately to protect its lead. However, watch out when a 
zone team gets ahead in a game — the zone team seems to get stronger 
with every possession of the ball, and offensive teams usually become 
frustrated and often force bad shots.
 
✓ Because defenders are assigned to guard areas of the field and not 
individual players, they don’t have the same sense of accountability that 
they would have if they were given the responsibility of guarding one 
particular player.
 
 A 3-3 alignment is the most frequently employed zone. In it, the area 
beyond the goal line in the restraining box is broken up into six zones. 
Close defensemen cover the three zones closest to the goal, with the 
midfielders taking care of the remaining zones. Some alignments of this 
zone station the three midfielders in a line, allowing them to defend 
horizontally. Other zone alignments include a 2-3-1.
Grasping zone-offense principles
 
Running a successful zone offense requires a number of skills, but they all 
seem to play off the one critical component: patience. Because a good zone 
defense offers few scoring opportunities per possession, your team needs to 
show an ability to wait for the best opening to get the best shot. With patience 
in attacking the zone defense, they’ll end up getting a good shot.

217
 Chapter 14: Developing Your Coaching Philosophy for the Offense
In the following sections, we cover some other tips for running a zone 
offense.
Moving the ball
By moving the ball from side to side and around the horn (the outside of the 
zone), you stretch the zone from one side to the other. Swinging the ball 
around the zone quickly creates openings in the zone defense through which 
players can cut.
Another result of moving the ball around is that when a player receives a 
pass, he can set up his defender quickly by faking a shot, freezing him, and 
then going around him for a real shot.
 
Youth coaches, whose players’ stick skills are not as advanced, may want to 
emphasize moving the ball with fewer passes.
Aligning in the gaps
Zone offense players have a tendency to stand right beside the zone 
defender, making it very easy for him to do his job. What a zone offense 
player should do instead is to align himself in the gaps of the zone — that is, 
between two defenders, to create indecision about who should defend him.
Moving the players
To be effective against a zone defense, you want to make it move, stretch it 
out, and make it shift. Defensive players will move, stretch, and shift when 
they see a great deal of ball and player movement. When offensive players 
cut through the zone defense, the defensive players have to collapse into the 
zone to defend those cutters. When those defenders collapse, or shift out of 
their assigned area, another offensive player can fill that gap and attack the net.
 
The worst thing your players can do against a zone defense is to remain 
stationary. If that occurs, nothing will happen and the zone defense will win 
the battle. When a player cuts, another player should move to the area just 
vacated by the cutting player. When a player passes, he should cut, giving the 
receiver another option for the next pass. Cut backdoor (from behind the zone 
defense) where the defensive players will have a hard time seeing a cut. And 
cut while running in a circle rotation on one side of the field where you may 
have two to three players cutting one right after another.
V-cuts are also effective against a zone defense. A V-cut is simply a move 
in which the offensive player turns around and heads back to the position 
where he started. You don’t want the player looping back from the center. 
(That would be a U-cut.) Instead, he should make a sharp redirection, 
heading back in the general direction of where he came from, creating a V. 
After the V-cut, the player can be an instant threat for a pass or another cut, 
or he can circle the net. The main thing a V-cut accomplishes is to create 
movement so that a defensive player is forced to react quickly.

218
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
Making sure the stick handler penetrates
By going one-on-one or penetrating the zone, the stick handler is more likely 
to draw two defenders. When the stick handler penetrates the gaps, he’s 
trying to make the zone defense shift. If the shift includes two defenders, the 
stick handler should be able to dish off the ball to an open teammate.
Attacking from the side of the offense
Because it can be easier to stop the stick handler when the ball is at the top 
of the offense, attack from the side of the zone defense. You keep the defense 
moving and reacting to the ball and any moving players, creating openings 
for attacking the net.
Being ready to shoot
You never know when an opening in the zone will present itself. The key is to 
be ready to shoot, or be ready to create a shot, such as using a fake shot to 
freeze the defender and then shoot.
 
Be extra careful to avoid taking bad shots, because the top zone defenders will 
break quickly for a breakaway pass.
Being aggressive
By its very nature, the zone is passive when compared to man-to-man 
defenses. Zone defenses are designed to make the offense operate passively 
as well — namely, settling for perimeter shots. Don’t fall into that trap. You 
need to attack the zone aggressively. Have a plan, and be proactive against 
the zone and not reactive to it.
 
A goal scored by a good outside shot will often make a team come out of the 
zone into a man-to-man defense, which it usually doesn’t want to play. That 
doesn’t mean you should settle just for outside shots. Take good, open looks 
when they’re available from the perimeter, but remember to continue to work 
the zone.
Defending the defenders
On any shot, watch for zone defenders breaking out to take a fast-break pass 
from the goalie. When a defender takes off, your offensive players at the top 
of the zone should also take off.
 
You may be able to take advantage of defenders breaking out by looking to 
grab long rebounds. Consider keeping a player or two toward the top of the 
offensive zone in case a missed shot rebounds out there. You may end up with 
the ball and a couple of overmatched defenders.

219
 Chapter 14: Developing Your Coaching Philosophy for the Offense
Running a Penetration 
Man-to-Man Offense
The penetration offense takes advantage of the skills of your best offensive 
players. Players take on their defenders one-on-one. The offense runs 
primarily through the stick handler, who is charged with shooting first, 
passing second, and asking questions later. Other offensive players have 
to create their own offensive opportunities by positioning themselves for 
rebounds, ground balls, or passes when the stick handler is double-teamed.
Knowing when to go one-on-one
The best time to attempt a one-on-one move is when you have a mismatch 
against the defense. When no mismatch exists, your offensive players need to 
rely on fakes and dodges to try to create a mismatch, sending your opponent 
off balance.
The dodger must be aware of others on the field. He must always dodge to 
create space. You don’t want to make a great move only to run into your 
teammate or another defender. Space is created by teammates understanding 
the dodger’s strengths and clearing that area for him to dodge.
Box lacrosse zones
Box lacrosse features three basic zone 
offenses:
 ✓ Motion: This passing-centered type of 
game gives players the freedom to do 
whatever they want within your zone 
offense guidelines. This type of offense 
allows your players to take what the zone 
defense gives them.
 ✓ Continuity: This zone offense focuses 
on running through the same offensive 
concepts over and over until a seam in the 
zone defense opens up to create a scoring 
chance.
 ✓ Set plays: Your zone offense should have a 
few special set plays that you can run when 
your normal offense (zone or otherwise) 
becomes stagnant. The set plays force ball 
and player movement.

220
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
To beat a defender, you have to be quick. Unless you’re setting up a pick, 
hanging onto the ball while waiting for a chance to beat a defender slows 
down your offense. If the stick handler beats his defender and another 
defender helps, your stick handler has a teammate who can take a pass or 
cut for a close-in shot.
 
The stick handler must
 
✓ Keep his stick moving all the time when he has the ball. This is known as 
cradling. (See Chapter 5 for more on cradling.)
 
✓ Protect his stick with his body by turning his body sideways.
 
✓ Keep his feet moving, unless he’s setting up his defender to take a pick 
so that he can roll off him.
Opening up penetration with outside shots
When playing a team that plays a less aggressive defense, your players may 
find it difficult to beat a defender one-on-one. A less aggressive defender 
tends to stand back from the stick handler to protect against such one-on-
one penetration moves. To combat this style of defense, you need strong 
perimeter shooters.
Good perimeter scorers complement your best one-on-one moves. When you 
show the defense that you can score consistently from the outside, they’ll 
play your stick handlers tighter to try to take away the long shot. Their 
defense becomes more aggressive, and your offense has a better opportunity 
to beat defenders inside. Conversely, if you show that your stick handlers 
consistently beat defenders inside, the defense will play more loosely to 
protect against penetration, opening up space for your outside shooters.
Running set plays for 
a penetration offense
Set plays for this offense should create space for your best one-on-one 
players. You create space by clearing out the five other offensive players. 
Clearing out means positioning the offensive players without the ball to one 
side so that your stick handler can initiate a one-on-one play from the 
opposite side of the field or floor.
 
Mix up your set plays. When teams fall behind during a game, they have a 
tendency to panic and resort solely to one-on-one plays and nothing else. 
Make sure to include other set plays so that the defense can’t anticipate what 
your offense will run.

221
 Chapter 14: Developing Your Coaching Philosophy for the Offense
Mastering the Motion 
Man-to-Man Offense
The motion offense is just the opposite of the penetration offense. In the 
motion offense, you look to pass first, and then go one-on-one or shoot 
second. This offense is designed for passing the ball and cutting.
 
No matter what offense you run, you must have cutters going through the 
middle of the field. Some teams are afraid to cut because they may get hit, but 
the better defensive teams don’t let cutters cut across through the middle 
without physical contact.
You can’t run a successful offense without any movement; your players will 
simply just stand outside the defense and look to shoot from the perimeter. 
You have to cut to collapse the opposition’s defense. The offense must 
dominate the middle of the opposition’s defense. But you can pass around 
the outside of the defense, waiting for a teammate to get open.
Passing to keep the offense 
(and defense) in motion
Quality passing is critical to an effective motion offense. The idea behind 
the offense is to keep the ball moving until you can get it to the offensive 
player with the most ideal shot at goal or the best matchup to go one-on-one. 
Encourage your team to take pride in its passing; emphasize simple, unforced 
passes.
 
The quality of a player’s passing determines the quality of his shots. Remind 
your players of the following: Before every pass, they should keep their 
attention on the business at hand — focus on the pass and the target. Before 
receiving a pass, they should keep their eyes on the ball and be ready for the 
pass, knowing what they’re going to do with the ball before they catch it.
Here are a few other things to keep in mind as you work with your team on 
passing in the motion offense:
 
✓ Pass early and often. The qualities that determine a good passing team 
include players with good passing skills, a team-oriented offensive 
system (as opposed to one that centers on one or two great players), 
and players with an unselfish attitude about giving up the ball. By 
passing early, you’re giving the receiver the best chance to do something 
with the ball; by holding onto the ball too long before passing, you give 
defenders a chance to anticipate where the ball will go.

222
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
 
✓ Pass to get the offense going. Some passes result in a score; other 
passes get things started. The pass before the pass that leads to a score 
(often informally referred to as the hockey assist) is very important. If 
you start your offense with a bad pass, the next pass will also be bad — 
a chain reaction that usually leads to your team not having the ball. If a 
player receives a bad pass, he should pause before throwing the next 
pass so that your team can regain some purpose and composure in its 
offensive set.
You also want all your players involved in passing because it makes it harder 
for the defense to stop you as a team. By moving the ball quickly, and keeping 
everybody moving, your players are trying to make it hard for the defenders 
to guard them, which can lead to good things happening offensively.
 
When you pass the ball, you force the defense to react, usually by moving or 
shifting in the direction of the ball. Therefore, every pass counts.
 
The dodge, pass, pass, dodge is a motion play that starts at midfield. After 
dodging his defender and drawing a double team, the midfielder passes the 
ball out to the top of the restraining box. The player who receives the pass 
then throws it to a teammate on the other side of the field. That player then 
dodges toward the goal before shooting.
 
The triangle set is an effective way to implement a motion offense. In it, the six 
players move as one unit, rotating to keep the field balanced. Midfielders form 
a triangle toward the top of the box. An attackman is stationed in the X area 
behind the goal. An attackman and midfielder are in front of the net. Players 
then react to where the ball is passed, with players without the ball making 
cuts in the middle to draw the defense.
Moving without the ball
Passing skills are just one element of a good motion offense. The second 
critical element is your team’s ability to move without the ball. You must 
help your players understand the importance of moving — with or without 
the ball.
In a motion offense, when your players aren’t in the process of passing or 
receiving the ball, they have the following options:
Cutting through the middle
Players must cut through the middle with the idea that their defender can’t 
stay with them. They should cut with the stick ready to catch rather than just 
going through the motions. They can cut to the ball for a give-and-go as well.

223
 Chapter 14: Developing Your Coaching Philosophy for the Offense
 
One of the ways to measure the toughness of a player is by the number of 
times he catches the ball cutting through the middle. The toughest battles are 
getting shots in front of the net or in the middle of the defense. By passing and 
cutting through the defense, you force the defense to react and move, and 
start to wear them down.
Getting open for a pass
Your players need to work hard to get open. Most of a player’s time on 
offense is without the ball, so he should use it wisely. There are many 
different ways to do this, including
 
✓ Setting a pick for the stick handler
 
✓ Setting a pick on the off-ball side
 
✓ Running off a pick set by his teammate
 
✓ Setting a screen for his teammate on their own side of the field
 
✓ Running off a screen set by a teammate
 
✓ Making a V-cut to get open for a pass
 
✓ Staying where he is to stay out of the way of a developing play
When you’re running the motion offense, some players play too far outside 
the defense so that they don’t get hit. They may be afraid to cut into the 
middle and afraid to go one-on-one. Always coach your players to keep 
moving and working to get open for a pass. In any offensive scheme, but 
especially in the motion offense, getting open keeps the flow of play moving 
and increases the team’s chances to score.
Setting picks: Forcing the defense to create openings
Sometimes a defense can help your players get open. If a tough defender 
overplays your best scorer, call for a pick on the defender. This strategy 
may force the defender to switch assignments, with your scorer checked by 
a weaker defender. Or the defense may not switch, choosing to double-team 
your scorer, leaving a teammate in the clear.
Picks and screens are great ways for your players to help their teammates 
get in the clear. By getting a stick handler in the clear, you give him an open 
shot. Remember: An open shot comes when a player has time to shoot 
without a defender interfering with the stick.
When setting a pick, make sure that your players set a good solid pick and do 
so immediately so that the defense can’t figure out what play you’re running. 
They need to make body contact with a teammate’s defender that may force 
the defender to switch. When the stick handler passes the picker’s shoulder, 
he should push off on the defender and roll to the net for a soft pass from the 
stick handler.

224
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
 
In order for a pick to be legal, the picker must be stationary. But when setting 
the pick, in box lacrosse the picker is allowed to use his body to push off on 
the defender when he rolls to the net. (Using the body to push off on the 
defender is illegal in field lacrosse.)
Running the give-and-go play
This play is the quintessential motion offense set play; it requires crisp 
passing and quick cutting. It works best when a defender adjusts — even 
slightly — to the direction of a pass.
In a give-and-go play, an initial stick handler does both the giving and the 
going. He passes the ball to a teammate, typically in about the same area of 
the zone, and then cuts toward the goal hoping to take a pass from that same 
teammate. When it works well, the initial stick handler’s defender relaxes or 
follows the initial pass just enough so that the stick handler can break ahead 
of his defender toward the net.
When a player passes the ball, his next move is to fake or take one step away 
from where he threw the ball. When his defender reacts, he should then plant 
his outside foot and push off explosively and cut sharply to the ball or net. 
He can ask for the ball by keeping his stick up and out, even shaking his stick 
hard to indicate that he wants the ball.
When executing the give-and-go, a player has the option of cutting in front 
of a defender or cutting backdoor (going behind the defender). Your players 
have to anticipate how a defender is going to react and then decide what 
move to make.
 
The best option is to cut in front of the defender because your player can 
receive the pass and still be in a good position to shoot, even if the defender is 
right beside him. If your player is being overplayed or when the defender tries 
to cheat to intercept a cross-field pass, the backdoor cut becomes available 
for a pass and open shot.
Running the pick-and-roll play
Another game situation that works well in a motion offense, the pick-and-roll 
is a kind of give-and-go, but with the defender instead of the ball. In its simplest 
form, an offensive player sets a pick for a teammate before rolling into a 
passing lane and receiving a pass. It’s used in field lacrosse and extensively 
in box lacrosse.

225
 Chapter 14: Developing Your Coaching Philosophy for the Offense
An offensive player, the picker, gets in the way of the stick handler’s defender 
so that the stick handler can create some space for a shot or pass. The picker 
then rolls to the net for a pass from the stick handler and a close-in shot. In 
this give-and-go, the stick handler “gives” the defender, and the picker “goes.”
The pick-and-roll play creates confusion and indecision for the defense. Plus, 
it creates a gap for the stick handler, who has three options:
 
✓ Shooting coming off the pick
 
✓ Going one-on-one off the pick
 
✓ Passing to the picker (who could also be called the roller, having already 
set the pick)
 
When setting a pick, players will be checked by the defense. But a player 
shouldn’t let a defender stop him from setting it; if your player gets tied up 
with the defender, he should stay where he is and let the stick handler read 
it as a screen and make his cut off the screen. If the defender fires out on the 
pick at the stick handler, your player can then cut backdoor.
Running Set Plays in Your 
Man-to-Man Offense
Running set plays doesn’t really work well as an offensive system on its own. 
Instead, you may call set plays during games in which your better players are 
not handling the ball as much as you’d like, or your players may be holding 
onto the ball too long and not moving efficiently enough. The most common 
set plays in lacrosse involve only two to three players.
No matter the reason for running a set play, you want to maintain some 
parameters for how your players should execute the play:
 
✓ A well-executed one-on-one move takes precedence over any set play 
that you call for.
 
✓ Players can call a set play on their own during a game. They can either 
make a real call during action on the field, or they can suggest a play 
while on the sideline.
 
✓ If a set play doesn’t work, your players should know to return 
automatically to your regular offensive system.
 
✓ Consider running two set plays: a real one on the strong side and a 
decoy play on the off-ball side.

226
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
When running set plays, your offensive players need to play alertly and 
intelligently because you want them to read the defense (that is, anticipate 
what the defense may do so that your players can execute the called play). 
By reading the defenders, your offensive players can react efficiently when a 
defender doesn’t play the way your set play anticipates. Instead of ending up 
with a broken play (one that doesn’t reach its conclusion), you may end up 
with an improvised play that nevertheless leads to a score.
Teams get scoring chances using a number of offensive weapons. The 
following plays that help offensive players get in the clear for good shots 
provide examples:
 
✓ The outlet pass up the field from the goalie to a breaking player or a 
player coming from the sideline
 
✓ Going one-on-one against a player whose team is still in defensive 
transition
 
✓ From set plays such as picks, give-and-go, and screens
 
✓ From a motion-style offense that involves players passing and cutting 
continuously until someone is open for a shot on goal
Getting set for set plays
The following plays are designed for the 
strong-side alignment. Each play includes an 
introduction setting up the play, as well as tips 
for what you should ask your players to do.
 ✓ Up pick-and-roll: The main player here is 
at the top of the offensive zone when the 
creaseman comes up the floor and sets a 
pick for the stick handler. To make this pick-
and-roll work, stress that the stick handler 
faces his defender or turns sideways and 
receives a check while he waits for the 
pick. When coming off the pick, he should 
look to shoot right away or go one-on-one, 
and not fade away or look to pass. 
 ✓ Down screen: This screen play is designed 
to create a close-in shot for a shooter. The 
shooter works off his teammate’s screen 
to try to get to an opening in the defense 
for a shot. Stress that the picker get his 
whole body on the pick, not just an arm and 
shoulder, and then stay with the defender 
until the stick handler passes his shoulder. 
And remind him to roll so that he’s always 
facing the ball with his stick ready for a 
forward pass.

227
 Chapter 14: Developing Your Coaching Philosophy for the Offense
Breaking Out on the Quick: 
The Fast-Break Offense
A fast break is when the stick handler runs the ball up the field before the 
defense has a chance to get back and set up. A fast-break offense is designed 
to create odd-man situations and an easy score. But running the fast break is 
not just frenzied chaos; it’s more like organized chaos.
As a defenseman or midfielder brings the ball out of the defensive end, three 
attackmen and three opposing defensemen are waiting at the midfield line. 
The most important part of the fast break is for the attackmen to take 
advantage of whatever lag time exists (a split second usually) between the 
stick handler and whoever is defending him. This is when the offense can 
exploit a numbers advantage.
Attackmen must know exactly what to do when their teammates clear the 
ball and how best to prepare for the incoming players. Attackmen should set 
up in an L formation with the point attackman stationed on the opposite side 
of where the ball is being brought down — about 12 to 15 yards in front of 
the goal. The other two attackmen are positioned about 5 yards outside the 
crease. Common drills involve running different scenarios over the midfield 
line — one player bringing the ball up with no one trailing, two players with 
one trailing, three with two trailing, and so on. These drills help prepare the 
attackmen to know how to react and the midfielders know how to proceed 
when charging into the offensive zone.
The fast-break offense works especially well when you can play everyone 
on your team. The more players that you send out running at full speed, the 
better your chances of wearing down the opposition. (If you’re familiar with 
football, compare the impact of your fast break on the defense to the impact 
that a big, strong running back has on a defensive line: After 25 or 30 carries, 
the defensive line is just too tired to stop the running back.)
 
You also need to set a team objective to be one of the best-conditioned teams 
around. Being in proper condition is vital in order to have the stamina and 
energy you need to be at your best. Achieving it is not easy — it takes a lot of 
hard work and teammates pushing one another on a daily basis.
To run a fast-break offense, look for players who play with quickness, 
aggression, and tenacity. You also want players who are daring and aggressive 
on the defensive end. Because of the pace of play that you want, your 
fast-break players have to play both ends of the field or floor; aggressive 
defenders lead to turnovers, ground balls, and more fast breaks.

228
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
The fast-break offense places less emphasis on bigger, more physical players, 
and it has a place for the little guy. When building your fast-break team, look 
for players with speed rather than size, and then ride, ride, ride. (A ride 
happens when the defensive team tries to prevent the team with possession 
from advancing the ball from its defensive end to the offensive zone. See 
Chapter 9 for more on rides.)
 
Don’t limit your fast-break offense to just those few seconds that it takes for 
the stick handler to run the ball down the field. If your team doesn’t score 
off the fast break, you still want your players to emulate the pressure and 
intensity of the fast break in its set offense. Constantly attack the net. Keep 
players moving and cutting, looking for an opening or a breakdown on 
defense.
Offensive Principles for 
the Women’s Game
To have an effective offense in women’s lacrosse, you need most of the same 
attributes as you do in the men’s game — namely, skill, shooting and passing 
ability, and good decision-making. Speed and strength are also big pluses. 
The main goal remains the same — to get as many good shots on net as often 
as possible, and to convert on as many as possible.
The fast break in box
In box lacrosse, you want to break quickly, but 
in an organized manner, from the defensive end 
and run down the floor, creating an odd-man 
situation at the other end from which you can 
get a good scoring opportunity. When running 
the ball up the floor, the stick handler should look 
to attack the net so that he forces a defender to 
commit to him — that is, to choose to defend 
the stick handler rather than another offensive 
player on the fast break — and then he can 
pass to an open man. If the defender doesn’t 
commit to your stick handler, he may have an 
open shot on goal or, if another defender has 
joined the fray, he may just peel off to the side, 
looking to pass or set up the offense.
Too many fast-breaking teams can get bogged 
down by the pace of play dictated by a 
slow-down team, and they end up simply 
jogging the ball up the floor rather than 
running full-out. For most teams, slowing down 
a game is easier than speeding it up. To keep 
your team focused on running, stress the quick 
outlet pass by the goalie and the hard and fast 
breakout by the stick handler. Ideally, your 
cornerman should start the fast break, either by 
running the ball up the floor into the offensive 
end or by passing it to a breaking teammate. He 
has to protect the ball up the floor at the same 
time that he’s seeing the positioning of his 
teammates and their defenders.

229
 Chapter 14: Developing Your Coaching Philosophy for the Offense
Scoring plays in the women’s game are often ignited from the attack wing and 
third home positions, or midfield in general. Those players are responsible 
for transitioning the ball from defense to offense. From there, a second home 
will often look to originate a play. The ball usually moves to the first home, 
who is stationed in front of the goal and makes numerous cuts toward the goal.
The critical scoring area is located about 15 yards in front of, as well as to 
each side of, the goal that stretches 9 yards behind the goal, although it 
is not common for a player to shoot — let alone score — from beyond the 
8-meter arc.
Major fouls are called within the 8-meter semicircular area in front of the 
goal. Similar to lane violations in basketball, a defender can’t remain in the 
8-meter arc for more than 3 seconds unless she’s within a stick’s length of the 
opposing player.
Offensive players are awarded free-position shots after major defensive fouls. 
The fouled offensive player is placed on a hash mark somewhere along the 
8-meter arc, while the defender who committed the foul is placed 4 yards 
behind. All other defenders must clear out of the 8-meter area, either to an 
adjacent hash mark in preparation of defending the free-position shot, or if 
taken, somewhere else outside the 8-meter arc with both feet and sticks 
outside of the arc. When the whistle sounds, that player may shoot, pass, or 
run with the ball.
Following minor fouls called in the 12-meter fan after play resumes, a player 
may pass or run with the ball but may not shoot until someone has played 
the ball. The 12-meter fan is a semicircle located in front of the goal.
Just as in the men’s game, catching, cradling, and cutting are all crucial in 
setting up shots in the women’s game, as is dodging. Because sticks in 
women’s lacrosse don’t have deep pockets, cradling is much more difficult 
than it is in the men’s game. It requires a special skill set that the men don’t 
have to employ. Cradling is taught and necessary as a specific skill in the 
women’s game because of the lack of a pocket in the stick. As a result, stick 
handlers often don’t hold onto the ball as long as they do in the men’s game. 
However, this also results in a finesse game, because the women rely on 
smart, well-placed passes to advance the ball, instead of just running with it. 
Women don’t rely heavily on physical or lengthy one-on-one opportunities. 
Instead, they often employ one or two moves or dodges with a quick release 
on a shot. The women’s game is less gritty because it can’t rely on excessive 
physical play because of the rules and mechanics of the skills. In addition, 
longer passes are possible, but not overly used because catching is more 
difficult without deep pockets.
There’s also a difference in the method of shooting. In the women’s game, 
the shooter can release the ball more quickly and easily because there is no 
pocket in the stick. Men’s players can drop their sticks further back when 
winding up to release the ball from the deep pockets.

230
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
 
Here are a few effective offensive plays for the women’s game:
 
✓ Going back door: One of the attack players sets a pick while another 
attacker has possession near the goal. Meanwhile, a third attacker cuts 
toward the front of the goal where she receives a pass from the second 
attacker near the goal. This play works effectively when the initial stick 
handler draws the defense toward her, usually by pretending to drive 
to the goal. After her own defender and any adjacent defenders step or 
slide to the stick handler, there is room and a free player to pass to in a 
back-door position.
 
✓ Using the trailer: An attacker breaking toward the goal must use the 
trailer (the player who is directly behind). This doesn’t necessarily mean 
passing to the trailer, but it’s important to try to deceive the defense 
into thinking that it will or could be happening at any moment.
 
✓ Give and go: After passing off to the trailer, the lead player breaks to 
the goal for a pass after the defenders shift over to the trailer.
 
✓ Stack set: Here, the attack players form a line in front of the goal at the 
top of the fan while the first home holds the ball behind the net. When 
the first home calls for a break, the attackers move in various directions 
while a wing cuts in front of the goal. This play works well when the 
cutters are organized, yet unpredictable. The more you move the 
defense and make them adjust, the more likely that someone will be 
open for a pass and/or shot.

Coaching Defensively
In This Chapter
▶ Focusing on a defensive system
▶ Defending one player at a time: the man-to-man defense
▶ Blanketing the offensive zone with a zone defense
▶ Shutting off a top scorer
T
he main objective for any defense is to stop the opposition from scoring, 
or at least to force it to take as many bad shots as possible. And whether 
it’s a stay-in-your-area zone or an aggressive and pressuring man-to-man, 
another objective for the defense is to create a change of possession so that 
its own offensive team can get the ball and score.
Playing effective defense involves being physical and aggressive, but that 
doesn’t mean that defenses should be designed to find out who can give the 
biggest hit or who can intimidate the opposing team the most.
You want to develop a defense that’s physical and tough but also smart 
enough to avoid bad penalties from over-aggressive play, such as tripping, 
pushing, or slashing a player.
This chapter focuses on the two primary defenses that you’ll likely use in 
youth lacrosse: the man-to-man defense and the zone defense. We also share 
a few drills that you can use to develop your team’s defensive philosophy.
Choosing Your Defensive Playing System
Defense wins championships. So in order to achieve success, it’s crucial you 
find — and employ — the right defensive system for your team. Here’s a look 
at the two most frequently employed systems:

232
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
 
✓ Man-to-man defense: A man-to-man defense is an aggressive system 
that is constantly trying to create turnovers. Defenders are usually 
looking for stick handlers to hit or short sticks to slap at, trying to get 
their opponents to lose possession or make a bad pass or shot. This 
defense is prone to giving up goals when their aggressive play leads 
to overplaying mistakes, or it may create a number of goals when the 
offense becomes frustrated with the physical nature of play. The 
aggressive defense can also lead to penalties and man-up opportunities 
for the opposing team.
 
✓ Zone defense: Most teams that employ zone defenses also use more 
patient offenses. The zone defense can be effective at setting the pace of 
the game and creating lower scoring results.
 
The main difference between a man-to-man defense and a zone defense is that, 
in a man-to-man defense, defenders are assigned to specific offensive players. 
In a zone defense, they’re assigned to guard areas of the field (and whatever 
players enter them), rather than specific players.
 
Regardless of which playing system you choose, keep in mind the following 
tips when plotting your defensive strategy:
 
✓ Know your players and adjust accordingly. Are your players quick and 
athletic or good-sized but lacking speed? If the players have the foot 
speed and other intangibles, then a man-to-man defense may be the best 
fit for your team. Conversely, if your players are solid fundamentally but 
perhaps lacking in foot speed, think about employing a zone.
 
✓ Desire makes a difference. Whatever your players’ attributes may be, 
you should always remember, and emphasize the fact, that there’s no 
substitute for desire. You don’t have to be the biggest, strongest, or 
fastest player to be great on defense, but you must be a hard worker. 
Good defensive play, more often than not, is the byproduct of hard 
work.
 
✓ It takes more than defensemen. It’s all about six-on-six. Yes, the three 
close defensemen get the toughest assignments, but the midfielders 
have to play just as hard and with as much purpose.
 
✓ Players have to communicate. They have to know what their teammates 
are doing and where they’re going at all times. The man playing the ball 
should yell, “Ball, ball, ball” or “I got ball.”
 
✓ Footwork is fundamental. Hard hits and slick body checks may get the 
most attention in the stands, but nothing is more important than strong 
footwork when playing defense. Body positioning is also critical — a 
player should always keep his body between the offensive player and 
his own goal. It’s also important that players don’t cross their feet at any 
point while playing defense. Doing so prevents them from having the 
mobility to make quick movements in relation to where the offense has 
the ball.

233
 Chapter 15: Coaching Defensively
Going Head to Head: Playing 
a Man-to-Man Defense
In lacrosse, the unsung heroes are the standout defenders who either shut 
down the offensive stars or make it tough for the stars to score. If you don’t 
have a strong defense, you won’t be successful in lacrosse — plain and 
simple. No matter what league, the top teams generally boast the lowest 
goals-against average, but not necessarily the best goals-scored stats. The 
common perception is true: Offense may win games, but defense wins 
championships.
 
Your defense should be the cornerstone of your team. With a solid defense, 
your team can be competitive game in and game out, no matter how your 
offense performs.
There’s no quicker way to put together a competitive team from scratch than 
by emphasizing strong defensive play and working hard in practice and in 
games to achieve it. A solid defense starts with solid defenders, the kind of 
players who can take on offensive players on their own and have some 
measure of success in preventing them from scoring. These defenders are 
the foundation you need for a successful man-to-man defense.
Recognizing the types of 
man-to-man defenses
In a man-to-man defense, you assign individual defenders to cover specific 
offensive players by following them around wherever they go.
You can play a man-to-man defense in a variety of ways, centering on the ball 
or on individual players, or some combination of both. We cover these three 
types of man-to-man defense in the following sections.
Ball-oriented man-to-man defense
There’s no questioning the fact that in order to play great team defense, each 
defensive player must know where the ball is at all times. If you’re a ball-
oriented defensive team, your players focus more on where the ball is rather 
than where their opponents are.
However, defenders still have to keep track of the players they’re defending, 
which presents the primary challenge with this type of man-to-man defense: 
With the great ball movement and skills of today’s players, it’s hard to focus 
on the ball and also follow your man.

234
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
 
To play this style of man-to-man defense, you have to stress maintaining an 
open stance, looking down the field, and keeping your eyes on both your off-
ball man and the ball by looking between them so that you can see both of 
them at the same time.
In order for this defense to be effective, you need good pressure on the ball, 
which admittedly is hard to do with the ball moving so quickly and accurately. 
But without pressure on the ball, your defenders who are playing the off-ball 
opponent are susceptible to cross-field passes to the player they’re defending 
for a quick shot, or quick cuts by the offensive player to the ball.
Man-oriented man-to-man defense
If you’re a man-oriented defensive team, you must stress a closed stance — 
belly-to-belly — to keep your eyes on the opponent even to the point where 
you stay with him more than helping out. In this system, players don’t always 
know where the ball is, and they’re susceptible to picks and screens, so they 
end up trailing the play rather than anticipating and staying with the play. If 
the stick handler beats his defender, his defensive teammates aren’t looking 
for the ball and aren’t in position to help him.
Combination man-to-man
A combination type of defense gives the ball and the opponent equal 
importance. When a player defends an off-ball opponent, he should play in 
a closed stance, staying with him while looking slightly over his shoulder to 
find out where the ball is.
When your players know both where the ball is and where their opponents 
are, they’re better able to anticipate the next offensive move: Which offensive 
player will make a cut? Who will set a pick for a teammate? Who will receive a 
pick? Who will stay and wait for a return pass?
 
Anticipating an offensive player’s next move is half the battle on defense.
The difference in this defensive scheme is that, although a player defends 
one person, as does each of his teammates, they’re still looking to help. No 
matter what defensive systems you play, if you have defenders who play 
strong on-the-ball defense, you’re going to be in great shape every game.
 
The combination man-to-man defense is the primary one played in the 
National Lacrosse League (NLL).

235
 Chapter 15: Coaching Defensively
Playing both ways in the 
man-to-man defense
A team needs offensive defenders and defensive defenders on its defense. To 
be successful, a team needs to score goals from its six-on-six offense, from its 
fast breaks, and from its defense. When your defensive players can run down 
the field and score rather than just run down the field and pass off, you’re in 
a great position.
Midfielders must be active and aggressive on defense. No six-on-six defensive 
unit can be effective without getting strong efforts from its midfielders. It 
can’t just rely on the efforts of the long-stick defensive players.
You want to build a man-to-man defense that can initiate an instant offense 
from steals, ground balls, forced turnovers, and missed shots. These situations 
can lead to easy fast-break goals, and they take a great deal of pressure off 
your six-on-six offense.
 
Players who can play both ways — offense and defense — are a tremendous 
asset on any team.
 “I have 6!”
The easiest way for a player to know his 
defensive assignment is to have him call out 
his opponent’s number and point a stick at him. 
This simple practice helps keep everybody 
mentally in the game and removes indecision 
about who’s covering whom.
However, most of the time in the man-to-man 
defense, assignments will be determined prior 
to the game. In fact, defenders will have the 
advantage of knowing who they’re going to 
guard while offensive players are left wondering 
who will be assigned to cover them. This also 
allows defensive players more time to plan 
and prepare for the opposing players they’ll be 
covering.
In addition to knowing who’s defending whom, 
each player must know who has the ball. Get 
your players on the sideline to yell out to their 
teammates who has the ball. The hidden-ball 
trick is not just a baseball move.

236
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
Applying pressure in the 
man-to-man defense
The man-to-man defense is a very aggressive, pressuring defense. Most 
man-to-man teams want to put the opposition under continuous pressure by 
aggressively checking the stick handler. But where should you start applying 
this pressure?
The obvious answer is to start applying pressure when the stick handler 
enters the attacking zone. But when the stick handler isn’t in a scoring area, 
he can still pass the ball to a teammate who is in a prime scoring area. Now 
you have to defend a stick handler who’s a threat to both score and pass.
 
So the obvious answer may not always be the best answer, meaning that you 
have to rely on your players to decide how to play a stick handler, based on 
what they know about his offensive strengths and weaknesses. Scary? Yes, but 
that’s where your preparation as a coach comes in handy. By attending other 
games, watching game films, and doing research on your opposition, you can 
tell your players exactly what the opponent’s strengths and weaknesses are.
 
Continue to encourage your players to check the stick handler to slow him 
down, or to try to steal the ball from him. Aggressive checking can often 
pressure the offense into making mistakes and turnovers. However, if your 
players try to force a turnover, they risk enabling the stick handler to dash 
past his flailing defender on the way to the net. But if you don’t put pressure 
on the ball, the opposition will pick you apart with their passing. It’s a fine 
line. Knowing the risks of both options helps players and coaches decide what 
course of action to take.
Forcing defensive action to 
get an offensive reaction
Players in a man-to-man defensive system are daring and aggressive. They’ll 
take calculated risks and instigate action by attacking on defense. They don’t 
play conservatively or cautiously. They’re dictating the pace of play.
This type of defense doesn’t want to react to the offense by guessing where 
the play is going or waiting to find out what the offense is going to do. The 
man-to-man defense attacks the offense before it has a chance to attack the 
net. For example, when the stick handler is at the top of the offense, the 
defenders should try to force him toward the sidelines.

237
 Chapter 15: Coaching Defensively
This defense wants to make the offense do something by taking it out of its 
comfort zone. When the offense reacts to the defense’s aggressiveness, the 
defense is in a better position to anticipate and out-think what the offense is 
going to do before they do it.
 
When coaching an aggressive and pressuring man-to-man defense, you can 
compare your team to a small boxer taking on a big boxer in the ring. Size 
won’t help them knock anybody out, so they have to keep moving and jabbing 
to wear down the bigger opponent. In an aggressive man-to-man defense, you 
want to apply relentless pressure throughout the whole game to wear down 
the opposition. You’ll wear them down physically and mentally and force 
them into mistakes with your constant defensive pressure. If you’re fortunate 
enough to have a defensive team that includes both quick and big players, 
you can add explosive hitting to your repertoire. Your players will be quick 
enough to recover when they take themselves out of position to deliver a hit.
Concentrating on getting the job done
How many times have you seen a defensive player fall asleep for just a split 
second only to have a non–stick handler cut for a wide-open pass and shot 
with the defender trailing behind him? Or a stick handler faking one way 
and then going the other way when the defender bites on the fake? An alert 
defender can avoid these situations.
 
One of the qualities that great defenders all have in common is that they 
seldom get caught off-guard. Certainly, defensive players who play on the 
off-ball side may have a tough time staying alert when they have to concentrate 
on both their man and the ball. But the best defenders have a great ability to 
focus on the two things at once. And defending the stick handler means 
concentrating on more than just the stick handler. Your defender has to be 
aware of players picking him or the stick handler coming off a screen.
You may want to stress to your players that no stick handler should be 
allowed to go directly to the net without a defender attacking him to try to 
force a pass instead of a shot. In other words, don’t let a stick handler take an 
uncontested shot.
Defensive help can come from the interior or adjacent areas. Determine 
where the help should come from based on the quickness of your defensive 
team on the field.

238
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
Helping: Slides and rotations
A man-to-man defense is not successful if only individual defenders keep 
their own man from scoring. The defense has to keep the other team from 
scoring. Helping out is critical to a man-to-man defense because a good 
one-on-one offensive player can often beat a good defender — the offensive 
player knows where he’s going. Man-to-man defense works best when 
defenders help each other.
Sliding is simply helping out a teammate who has been beaten by the 
offensive player he’s covering. You need to decide how and under what 
situation you want your defense to slide.
 
In box lacrosse, slides are referred to as rotations. You can also use some 
planned rotation, where any or all of your defenders can rotate to play the ball 
or the moving offensive players.
 
Players need to be sure to use proper sliding technique: The defender closest 
to the defender who gets beat picks him up on the slide. Defenders must 
slide where the offensive player is going to be, not where he already is. The 
defender must veer toward the stick handler’s shooting hand on slides.
Where does the beaten defender go after a teammate has helped him? The 
typical move is for the defender to rotate opposite the direction in which the 
stick handler passes.
Using the man-to-man defense 
in game situations
The rest of this section about the man-to-man defense suggests a few ways in 
which this style of defensive play can help your team against certain offensive 
situations.
Defending the off-ball pick-and-roll
Most teams switch defenders when the offense executes an off-ball pick or 
screen. To prevent a pick or screen, however, off-ball defenders must play 
between their man and the ball, not between their man and the net, which is 
a perfect setup for a down screen.
If an offensive player cuts and tries to get the inside position on his defender 
so that he can set a screen, the defender must not let this happen because 
he won’t be in a position to switch to help his teammate being screened. 
The defender should instead move down with the screener evenly, staying 
between his man and the ball.

 Chapter 15: Coaching Defensively
Defending a player standing in the middle of the field
Some offensive players love to stand in the middle of the attacking zone, 
waiting to receive a pass and then take a shot. A good offensive player can 
lean and relax on the checker to neutralize the defender, receive a pass, turn, 
and get a shot off.
To counter a player who stands in front of the net looking for a pass, a 
defensive player just has to stand beside him, playing between him and the 
ball, and playing his stick by clamping his stick over the opponent’s stick. 
Now the defender is in a position to help a teammate if a screener tries to rub 
him out of the play.
Defending the give-and-go play
The give-and-go is one of the best plays in lacrosse. It’s simple to execute 
because all the player does is pass the ball and cut. Ideally, the cutter wants 
to beat his defender by a step so that he gets into the clear for a pass and 
Rotating against a motion offense
In box lacrosse, a total full rotation — with all 
five defensive players rotating — happens only 
in the ball-oriented type defense, because your 
players are following the ball as it moves around 
the offensive end of the floor. In a man-oriented 
or a combination-type defense, rotation occurs 
generally in a helping situation. Ideally, your 
defense will have such great defenders that 
they’ll never get beaten, and you won’t need 
any rotation at all.
Here is a sample rotating progression in box 
lacrosse against a motion offense, one that 
passes the ball around the zone:
 1. Rotate when the stick-handler from top 
corner cuts inside.
 
 If a defender in the top area of the floor is 
beaten by the stick handler into the middle 
of the floor, help comes from the off-ball 
top defender sliding over. If the stick 
handler sees the defensive pressure 
coming across, he may pass to a cornerman 
on the side of the floor where the help came 
from.
 2. Rotate on pass across to the cornerman.
 
 To help his teammate who rotated across, 
the bottom off-ball defender may leave his 
check to come up and pressure the new 
stick handler, who now may pass down to 
the creaseman on his side of the floor.
 3. Rotate on pass down to the creaseman.
 
 The off-ball bottom defender now rotates 
across the floor to check the creaseman 
who just received the pass.
 4. Rotate on pass across to the creaseman.
 
 And to make the rotation complete, the 
offensive creaseman, on seeing the bottom 
defender coming across, may pass to the 
other creaseman, but one of the off-ball 
top defenders has now rotated down to 
pressure the creaseman on his side of the 
floor.

shot. Or he can cut in front of his check and lean into him as he receives a 
pass and while he gets his shot off.
To defend this play, the defender shouldn’t wait to find out what a passer 
does after passing. Instead, when the stick handler passes the ball, the 
defender drops to the direction of the pass and toward the middle.
The defender is trying to maintain his position between his opponent and 
the ball. He doesn’t want to end up behind or beside the offensive player 
when he cuts. By stepping in the direction of the pass, the defender has a 
good chance of getting in front of the cutter, getting the inside position, 
forcing the cutter to go backdoor, and then reacting by playing his stick hard. 
If the cutter does get inside position on the defender, stress that the defender 
should just check his stick hard, assuming that a pass is coming.
Defending the odd-man break situation
At some point during a game, probably even at several points during a game, 
in both box and field lacrosse, your defenders are going to be outnumbered 
by attacking offensive players. These situations occur mainly in transition, or 
breaks.
 
Here are a couple coaching tips for defending these odd-man situations in a 
man-to-man defense:
 
✓ Defending the 4-on-3: The three back defenders play a triangle zone 
defense. The keys are to pressure the ball and rotate in the opposite 
direction to where the pass goes.
 
✓ Defending the 5-on-4: The four defenders play a box zone defense and 
rotate as against the 3-on-2.
Defending penetration by the stick handler
The standard man-to-man reaction to 
offensive penetration in box lacrosse is called 
help and recover. It’s a two-man game in which 
a defensive player helps a teammate who has 
been beaten while staying in position to recover 
should his own opponent end up with the ball. 
On the recovery back to his opponent, the 
defender has to close out quickly.
Closing out is running back to the new stick 
handler (the helper’s previous check), staying 
down in a defensive stance, shuffling the last 
two steps, and coming at an angle to force him 
to the boards and stop him from going to the net 
or from taking a long shot.
Stress to your defenders to cross-check the 
stick handler when they go to help, rather 
than stick-check, especially when closing out 
on great offensive players. If they gamble for 
the ball by stick-checking, they’ll come up out 
of their defensive stance and will become 
vulnerable to getting beaten.

241
 Chapter 15: Coaching Defensively
Defending the Zone
A zone defense places your defenders in assigned areas that they’re 
responsible for covering. So instead of being assigned to defend against 
specific offensive players, they’re entrusted with defending specific areas 
of the field.
The most commonly employed zone defense in field lacrosse is a 3-3. In this 
alignment, the close defense is assigned to cover the lower three zones, and 
the midfielders are assigned to the top three zones. The 3-3 is made up of 
four long sticks and two short sticks. The two short sticks play either up top 
or near the crease.
 
Playing near the crease is best against players who are more prone to dodging.
In a 2-3-1 zone, the defenders match up the positions of the players on 
offense with two players up top, three in the middle, and one down low.
 
Two basic types of zone defense are employed in box lacrosse. The only 
differences between these two alignments are how they start out and match 
up against the offensive alignment.
 
✓ 1-2-2: If the offense starts with an offensive player at the top of the 
offense, the zone defensive team plays a 1-2-2 zone defense, with the “1” 
player of the 1-2-2 matching up against the top offensive player.
 
✓ 2-1-2: If the offensive team overloads one side of the floor (the strong-
side alignment), the zone defensive team plays a 2-1-2 zone defense, with 
the “1” player staying in the middle of the zone. Except for this distinction, 
the guidelines for playing these defensive systems are the same, so the 
balance of this section applies to both alignments.
Some teams like to change to a zone defense just to change up the defense 
and give the offense a different look and try to change the tempo. Other 
teams change defenses each time down the floor to create some confusion 
and hesitancy with the offense.
Understanding the zone 
defense philosophy
The zone defense is designed to take away the opposition’s inside game and 
force outside shots, which are easier for the goalie to handle. This defense 
works best against offensive teams that haven’t yet developed as a team, that 
aren’t great at passing, or that have players who prefer to go on one-on-one 
and don’t want to give the ball up.

242
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
 
Here are some critical elements to any successful zone defense. Work with 
your players on these actions in the defensive zone:
 
✓ Adjust. When playing a zone defense, defenders must remember to 
adjust. The defenders have to constantly change and make adjustments 
during an offensive set, depending on the position of the ball.
 
✓ Talk. Defenders must communicate with each other. The close defenders 
(closest to the goal) are usually designated as field generals because 
they can see most of the defensive zone.
 
✓ Pressure the ball. The closest defender to the location of the ball must 
pressure the ball to stop the offense from moving it around easily. 
This strategy also helps keep all your defenders alert and in the game, 
because they always have a task to do as soon as the ball enters their 
area of the zone.
 
✓ Stop any penetration. Nobody penetrates between two or more 
defenders. This rule is important for helping out between defenders.
 
✓ Move with every pass. On every pass, all six defenders must move, 
even if it’s only a quarter-turn of the body to get a better view of the 
ball without losing sight of the offensive player in that area of the zone. 
By stressing universal movement on every pass, your defense will be in 
better position before the offense adjusts to the new ball position.
 
✓ Follow the cutter. If an offensive player cuts, the defender goes with the 
cutter until the cutter crosses over to another defender’s area of the 
zone. On the cut, make sure to cross-check the cutter (if you’re playing 
box lacrosse) or deny him a pass.
 
 The 1-2-2 box lacrosse zone defense looks especially like a man-to-man 
defense — at least until the first pass when the top defender drops into 
the middle to plug up any gaps. The four perimeter players are responsible 
for an area of the floor rather than for an offensive player, so the defense 
divides the floor into quarters. In this setup, when an offensive player 
goes from one area to another in the zone, the defender in the vacated 
area doesn’t follow.
 
 If the new defender doesn’t pick up the cutter, you can’t leave him alone 
to wait for a pass and an open shot. The initial defender should stay with 
the cutter, with an eye to any activity in his own area of the zone, until 
the new defender finally picks up the cutter.
 
✓ Protect the net in the middle. The middle defender always stays 
between the ball and the net. Even when the ball goes back to the top of 
the offense, the middle defender remains between the ball and the net 
while playing one of the top offensive players.

243
 Chapter 15: Coaching Defensively
 
✓ Protect the middle against a strong-side offensive set. When the ball 
is on the strong side (the side with the most offensive players), and the 
stick handler is in the middle of the other offensive players, the top 
ball-side defender must play him. If you play the middle defender in this 
situation, you’re leaving the middle vulnerable to an open shot by a 
cutter.
 
✓ Back up the middle against the weak-side offense. If the ball is with 
a player on the weak side (the side with fewer offensive players), the 
defenders on that side match up with each of them. The middle defender 
acts as a backup in this situation, protecting the middle from any cutters.
Containing the stick handler 
with a double-team
The one thing you don’t want to happen as a coach is to have one player beat 
you. So you should have a few wrinkles that will make it difficult for a great 
player to play against your team.
One way is to double-team him and force him to give up the ball. Although 
you can double-team an offensive player in any defensive set (including 
man-to-man), the double-team is essentially a zone-like defensive play. On 
the double-team, two defenders double the stick handler — that is, they both 
defend the stick handler at the same time — while the other defenders form a 
zone, ready to help and rotate if the stick handler breaks through the double-
team. Because one offensive player will always be open during a double-team, 
the defender furthest from the ball plays between the two offensive players 
closest to his area of the zone.
Here are some game situations in which coaches often like to call for the 
double-team:
 
✓ When the stick handler turns his back to the rest of his teammates
 
✓ When the stick handler is a weak stick handler who’s less likely to 
handle the pressure, making him panic and turn the ball over
 
✓ To force the opposition’s best player to pass the ball to a less talented 
teammate

244
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
Defense in the Women’s Game
 
Just as in men’s lacrosse, the two basic defenses in women’s lacrosse 
are man-to-man (sometimes referred to as person-to-person) and zone. In 
man-to-man, the defender is assigned one specific player, and it’s her 
responsibility to guard her, try to prevent her from scoring, and deny her 
passes. In zone, the defender’s main purpose is to keep herself between the 
offensive player and the goal, and guard an area of the field rather than a 
specific pre-assigned player.
Emphasizing body positioning 
and footwork
Because checking and contact to the body with the stick are not allowed in 
women’s lacrosse, the main concepts to emphasize with players are body 
positioning and footwork. Defenders can’t use their bodies to physically 
lead an offensive player to veer in one direction or another, so positioning 
and footwork are especially important. Your players have to move their feet 
quickly to keep pace with the offensive players they’re guarding, as well as 
remain balanced so they can react quickly to shifts from the opponent. Your 
players’ sticks should follow (or mirror) the position of the attacking players’ 
sticks, which are usually in the air.
Executing the double team
The double-teamer — the player who leaves 
his own offensive assignment to join another 
defender — should usually come from the 
strong side of the defense, the side with three 
defenders on it.
If the stick handler is on the strong side of the 
defense, the defender beside the defender 
checking the stick handler leaves his man to 
double-team. If the stick handler is on the weak 
side of the defense, the top defender on the 
strong side leaves his check and comes across 
to double-team the ball.
If the stick handler is on the weak side, but is 
with the creaseman, the top defender on the 
weak side drops down while the top defender 
on the strong side comes across. The other 
three defenders form a triangle ready to slide 
or rotate.
The defender creating the double-team should 
stick-check the stick handler rather than 
cross-check. If the ball is passed out of the 
double-team, the double-teamer rotates or 
drops opposite to the pass.

245
 Chapter 15: Coaching Defensively
Teaching techniques for stick checking (for the players marking “on ball”) 
is also important. Because women’s lacrosse sticks don’t have deep pockets 
and because body checking isn’t allowed, the skill level of the players needs 
to be at a high level. (Checking is not allowed at the modified level, according 
to US Lacrosse rules.)
An opportunity to check presents itself only when a player has done everything 
else she can to use good defensive body positioning to slow down, contain, 
or direct the offensive player to her disadvantage. When the offensive player 
makes a wrong move and fails to protect her stick, a defender can check in 
a quick, controlled motion that moves down and away from the body of the 
player with the ball. A check must also have a release, where the defender 
retracts her stick — she can’t hold her stick against the player’s with the 
ball. A check must be assessed as controlled, safe, and away from the body; 
otherwise a referee must call a foul in order to maintain safe play. Therefore, 
a check in the women’s game requires much skill, patience, eye-hand 
coordination, and timing.
At the heart of any successful defense — whether men’s or women’s — is 
good communication. This means that players must actively call out slides 
they’ll be making or those that their teammates should make. Instruct your 
players to call out in advance occasions in which your team will be double on 
the ball. They should keep the instructions clear and concise, because a split 
second can make the difference in whether a goal is scored. Have them use 
both general terms such as “I’m hot” (the player saying that is the first slide) 
and other terminology or words for strategy specific to your team.
Major or minor fouls result in a “free position.” Defenders are situated 4 
meters behind the offensive player taking the free position on major fouls. 
Those called for minor fouls are placed 4 meters in the area where she 
approached the offensive player prior to the foul. If the minor foul occurs in 
the critical scoring area, an indirect free position is awarded to the player 
with the ball. The 3-second rule requires defenders to stay outside the arc 
unless they’re following an attacker.
 
Defensive players must get low when going after ground balls. Make sure your 
players choke up on their sticks and bend their knees. This will help allow for 
clean pickups rather than swatting after the ball. Many players make the 
mistake of attempting to get ground balls while staying upright — make sure 
your players stay low. And moving through the ball while in stride (using a 
consistent motion involving your hips as well as your arms), as opposed to 
scooping while standing still, is crucial; it aids players not only in gaining 
possession of the ball, but also in evading any opponents competing for the 
ball and generating an offensive run.

246
Part III: Coaching Lacrosse 
Everyone’s a defender
All players on the field need to realize that, at some juncture in the game, 
all players are defenders. When a turnover happens in the attacking zone, 
players who just seconds earlier were on offense have to become defensive 
players. So every player on the field must be mindful of proper defensive 
strategies and techniques.
Emphasize to your players that a big part of defense comes down to effort 
and energy. Hustling after ground balls and working hard to follow the ball 
are essential — especially in the women’s game, where contact isn’t allowed.
Playing as a team is vital. Everyone must realize what her main mission is — 
namely, to prevent the other team from scoring. When your team prevents 
the opponent from scoring, their next priority is to shift from defense to 
offense and help create scoring opportunities.

Following Lacrosse: 
The Fan’s Point of View

In this part . . .
I
f you’re a lacrosse fan, one of the things that drew you 
to the sport is likely its similarities to other popular 
sports. In fact, in some respects, you can say lacrosse is 
hockey and basketball, with a little football and wrestling, 
all rolled into one. It’s also hard hitting, high scoring, and 
fast moving. Those are some of the reasons the sport is 
more popular now than it’s even been before — with par-
ticipation and fan interest growing at jaw-dropping rates. 
This part offers a look at all that and more. Here, we dis-
cuss what to watch for in games, take a look at some pre-
mier programs at the high school and college levels, and 
give an overview of the two professional lacrosse leagues.

hen you see the game of lacrosse for the first time, you may be a bit 
taken aback. What the heck is going on? Players run around at one 
end, and then they run up to one part of the field and right back to the other 
end. Some run back and forth to the sideline, while others don’t run from the 
playing surface at all. Players hit everything that moves and then, in turn, 
they’re hit. And just try following that little ball around — off a pass, off the 
turf, off the goalie, and off anything else that gets in its way.
As a fan, that last point is the key. Most of lacrosse action follows the ball — 
following ground balls, following shots on goal, following cross-field passes, 
following fast-break passes, or following where the ball goes on a faceoff.
This chapter offers some advice about watching the game of lacrosse from 
a fan’s perspective. Whatever the game — high school, college, pro, or your 
community’s youth lacrosse league — this chapter helps you follow all the 
action.
It All Looks a Little Familiar . . .
Fast breaks. Man-to-man defenses. Zone defenses. Outlet passes. Basketball? 
Sure. But lacrosse, too.
Man-up opportunities. Stick checks. Goalies coming up with big saves. 
Hockey? Yes, of course. But it’s also lacrosse.
Box lacrosse especially may seem familiar to you. You’re in an arena. If 
you’re at a National Lacrosse League (NLL) game, you’re probably in a pretty 
large arena — perhaps even one that you’ve been in before for a concert or a 
truck show or maybe a hockey or basketball game. 

250
 Part IV: Following Lacrosse: The Fan’s Point of View 
You’ll notice a host of similarities between ice hockey and box lacrosse — 
from the rink to the lines and rules to the way the game moves. Partly 
because they share an out-of-bounds factor, basketball and field lacrosse are 
quite similar as well. But all these sports are intertwined by a common flow 
to the game: Fast breaks are spliced into the action, but most of the games 
are dictated by half-court offenses and defenses. The offense works the ball 
around in an effort to get the defense out of position and create a scoring 
opportunity.
Two-man plays such as the pick-and-roll work in lacrosse as well as in both 
basketball and hockey. And knowing how to push the ball, how to play a 
numbers advantage or disadvantage, and when to slow things down are as 
important in lacrosse as they are in hockey and basketball.
In the following sections, we outline the specific similarities that lacrosse has 
to hockey and to basketball, as well as some differences between the sports.
Recognizing the game’s 
similarities to hockey
Like hockey, lacrosse is a very fast game. The two sports are also very 
physical; go to a pro hockey or a pro box lacrosse event, and you’re as likely 
as not to see a fight break out. And they’re both exciting games to watch as 
well as to play. Though there are many similarities between hockey and field 
lacrosse, there are even more similarities between hockey and box lacrosse.
Here are a few other similarities between hockey and lacrosse:
 
✓ A faceoff begins play at the start of each game, at the start of each 
quarter or period, and after a scored goal.
 
✓ In both hockey and lacrosse, a crease area around the net is a protected 
area for the goalie.
 
✓ Like hockey players, lacrosse players are legally allowed to hit an 
opponent with the body or stick.
 
✓ Both hockey and lacrosse players wear heavily padded equipment, such 
as kidney pads, gloves, and helmets.
 
✓ Like hockey, lacrosse uses different lines and shifts, so matching up 
players is crucial.

251
 Chapter 16: How to Watch Lacrosse
 
There are also a few specific similarities between hockey and box lacrosse:
 
✓ Each team has a goalie and five players on the playing surface.
 
✓ Each game is played in an arena 200 feet long and 85 feet wide.
 
✓ Each game has two- and five-minute penalties.
 
✓ That old hockey joke works for lacrosse, too: Went to a fight the other 
night and a lacrosse game broke out.
But the games aren’t completely alike. Here are a few important differences 
between hockey and lacrosse:
 
✓ Hockey is played on ice; field lacrosse is played on grass or turf and box 
lacrosse is played on AstroTurf.
 
✓ Hockey players wear skates; lacrosse players wear running shoes.
 
✓ The dimensions of the goals are different. A hockey goal is 4 feet high 
and 6 feet wide; a field lacrosse goal is 6 feet high and 6 feet wide, and a 
box lacrosse goal is 4 feet high and 4 feet wide.
 
✓ Box and pro lacrosse have shot clocks during which a team must get off 
a shot on goal in a designated amount of time or lose possession of the 
ball. Hockey has no shot clock.
Recognizing the game’s similarities 
to basketball
Lacrosse is similar to hockey because of all the hitting and physical play, 
but it’s even more like basketball because of the passing and ball control. 
In hockey, a team doesn’t always have complete possession of the puck 
because of the nature of the game — the puck takes weird and unexpected 
bounces and ricochets.
However, as in basketball, when a lacrosse team has possession of the ball, 
it can control the game and possession time. It’s pretty hard to get the ball 
away from a good stick handler. For this reason, winning a faceoff and getting 
ground balls are crucial in the game of lacrosse. After a team takes possession 
of the ball, it can control the tempo of the game.
Youth lacrosse coaches coming from the hockey world may have a tendency 
to play their players like hockey forwards and defensemen — keeping the 
defensemen back toward the center of the field when in their own offensive 
zone, for example. But lacrosse is more like basketball when it comes to what 
players do on each end of the field. When a team has possession of the ball, 

252
 Part IV: Following Lacrosse: The Fan’s Point of View 
everybody has an active role on the offense. When a team doesn’t have the 
ball, just about everybody plays defense.
Here are some other similarities between lacrosse and basketball:
 
✓ Although you won’t see any teams scoring 100 points in a game, lacrosse 
is a bit more like basketball in that it has many more legitimate scoring 
opportunities than hockey does.
 
✓ The lacrosse equivalent of a jump ball is the faceoff, which takes place at 
the start of each game, at the start of each subsequent quarter and any 
overtime periods, and after each goal is scored.
 
✓ In basketball and box lacrosse, each sport has a shot clock to regulate 
offensive play and help speed up the action. The shot clock in Major 
League Lacrosse (MLL) is 60 seconds; the NLL’s shot clock is 30 seconds; 
and the National Basketball Association has a 24-second shot clock.
 
✓ The three options of a basketball player with the ball are pass, shoot, or 
try to fake out the defender — and that’s the same in lacrosse.
 
✓ The cuts and movement of off-ball play are crucial in creating space and 
opening opportunities in both basketball and lacrosse.
 
✓ In both basketball and lacrosse, vision (that knack of seeing peripherally 
and being able to play with your head up) is essential. It’s what allows a 
player to follow his teammates and know where they’ll be.
 
✓ When an attack player in lacrosse backs into a defender while attacking 
the crease area, it’s similar to the way a forward posts up in basketball.
 
✓ Lacrosse involves both zone and man-to-man defensive play, just as 
basketball does. In fact, individual and team defense are virtually 
identical in basketball and lacrosse.
The footwork, lateral movement, and bent knee translate from one sport 
to the other. The communication, sliding/shifting, double teams, and cover 
schemes characterize team defense in both games.
Though there are similarities, lacrosse and basketball have some distinct 
differences as well:
 
✓ Most notably, basketball is primarily played indoors; field lacrosse is 
played outdoors.
 
✓ There are twice as many players on the field in lacrosse as there are in 
basketball (with ten players in lacrosse and five in basketball).

253
 Chapter 16: How to Watch Lacrosse
 
✓ Every player on the court in basketball must continuously play defense, 
whereas, in lacrosse, there are long stretches where players, especially 
attackmen, don’t have to play defense at all.
 
✓ Basketball players wear little gear aside from their uniforms. The 
physical nature of lacrosse, however, makes helmets, gloves, shoulder 
pads, elbow pads, and mouth guards necessities.
Knowing What to Watch For
You’ve made it to the game in time to buy a program or pick up a lineup so 
that you know who the players are. If you’re already a fan, you probably 
know the home team’s players. If you’re new to the game, you’ll want to read 
up on both teams.
 
You should be able to find out who the outstanding players are on both 
teams — the ones to watch during the game — based on matchups. Teams 
usually match up their best defensive player with the opponent’s best 
offensive player, so you’re sure to see at least one classic struggle.
Another great way to get information about either team is to ask the fans 
sitting around you. Most fans love to share information and advice on who to 
watch, what to watch for, and what other exciting things to anticipate during 
the game, such as a player who may be approaching a scoring record or a 
team battling to earn a playoff spot.
Lacrosse is different from some other sports in that there is a community-
type atmosphere. As a result, fans are usually eager to interact in the stands — 
even with fans from the opposing team. One of the reasons for this is that so 
many fans in stands are new to the game. Unlike sports such as football and 
basketball, in which most fans have grown up with the games and know the 
rules, lacrosse is still a new phenomenon to many. So their neighboring fans 
are always quick to pitch in with info and insights.
 
Don’t worry about trying to figure out the rules of the game. Even those who 
have followed the game for decades are still trying to figure some of them out. 
For example, box lacrosse players are allowed to slash another player’s stick, 
but they can also be penalized for slashing. If you really want to learn more 
about the rules of the game, check out Chapter 4 of this book. At the game, it 
may be helpful to remember some of the referee’s signals (also discussed in 
Chapter 4) so that you have some idea of what has happened to cause a play 
stoppage.

The balance of this section offers some suggestions about what game action 
to watch for. You’ll probably concentrate on what your favorite team is doing 
during the game, so these tips are written from that perspective.
Of course, if your team is playing against a team known for its defensive 
prowess, for example, you may want to pay closer attention to that team’s 
defense when your team has the ball.
Watching the offense
When your team has the ball, it’s obviously looking for ways to score. As 
a fan, you want to try to figure out its style of play or what type of play it’s 
running that will give the team the best chance to score. In the following 
sections, we cover what to look for.
Getting open
Following the ball doesn’t always take you to the most action. Often, the most 
exciting thing to watch is how the offensive team gets its better players open 
or away from the best defenders.
 
Look for offensive players off the ball who set picks for their teammates. A 
pick occurs when an offensive player positions himself in front of a defensive 
player defending one of his offensive teammates so that his teammate can 
have an opening to receive a pass or take a shot.
The player setting the pick has to be stationary; a moving pick is illegal. 
When it’s done correctly, picking off a defender can be the most exciting 
event in an offensive set; fans (and players) love it when a defender is picked 
right off his feet.
Executing plays
Most teams have a tendency to run similar plays all the time. They rely on a 
particular play because of the type of players they have on offense. For 
example, you may see offensive players habitually taking on a defender 
one-on-one, or you may see a lot of pick-and-roll plays.
Motion offenses are those in which players are constantly cutting and passing. 
Or a team’s offense may simply run through the player who has the hot hand 
during a particular game.
Controlling the tempo
Is your team dictating the pace of play? If you’re familiar with the style of play 
that your team prefers, you may be able to tell whether it’s controlling the 
tempo of the game. For example, if your team is loaded with smaller players, 
it probably has to play a fast-paced running game to be successful.

255
 Chapter 16: How to Watch Lacrosse
If its opponent is a bigger team that tends to run a more deliberate, patient 
offense, then two distinct styles of play are colliding. In this case, if both 
teams are scoring a lot of goals, then your team is probably controlling the 
tempo. If it’s a low-scoring game, then your team is likely losing the tempo 
battle — and probably the game.
 
Besides watching for a fast or slow tempo, you may spot another kind of 
tempo in a game: a scoring run. This is when a team scores consecutive 
multiple goals over a short period of time, also known as going on a run.
Momentum shifts swiftly in a lacrosse game. If your team quickly finds itself 
down by four or five goals, don’t worry: A scoring run could be right around 
the corner to get those four or five goals back. These scoring runs tend to 
come from playing good aggressive defense that forces a lot of turnovers, 
leading to transition opportunities. Winning several consecutive faceoffs also 
leads to scoring runs.
Pressing on the man-up
When the opposition takes a penalty, it gives the offense a man-up advantage. 
How does your team take advantage of the situation? Some teams have a 
series of set plays that they save for those man-up situations. Other teams 
prefer to stay back and pass around the zone until the defense allows an 
opportunity for a cutter or an open shot.
 
Man-up opportunities allow some of the best offensive players to have a 
chance to really show off their skills, taking on a defender one-on-one because 
eventually his opponent will run out of help and a teammate will be open.
Watching the defense
Are the teams playing man-to-man or zone defense? How is one team 
defending the great offensive players of the opposition? Does the defense 
pressure the stick handler or just sit back and let the offense take shots from 
long distance? These are a few things to look for on the defensive side of the 
ball. However, defense is also where you see most of the activity that results 
in turnovers or ground balls.
In the following sections, we tell you what to look for on defense.
Forcing turnovers
A turnover is when possession of the ball changes teams. Turnovers can be 
the result of careless offensive play (a bad pass, a dropped or missed pass, 
or an offensive penalty) or aggressive defensive play (a stolen pass, the ball 
stripped from the stick handler, or an offensive penalty).

256
 Part IV: Following Lacrosse: The Fan’s Point of View 
But the action doesn’t stop after the ball has been turned over. Good teams 
look to score off turnovers, creating scoring-run opportunities (see the 
“Controlling the tempo” section, earlier in this chapter). Aggressive play that 
forces turnovers can turn a game around, making the opposition pay the 
price for dropping the ball.
Forcing missed shots
A missed shot can technically be considered a turnover, but a missed shot 
can also be thought of as part of the natural flow of the game. No matter how 
you look at them though, missed shots are often the result of good solid 
defensive play.
From the offense, look for examples of
 
✓ Long-distance shots through a phalanx of other players
 
✓ Awkward, off-balance shots from poor angles toward the goal
 
✓ Arcing, slow-moving shots from players who’ve been hit as they shot
These poor shots are all the result of a good aggressive defense forcing 
low-percentage shots.
Going after ground balls
Ground balls should not be taken for granted. Whoever controls the ground 
balls, usually controls the game. Watch what happens after most of the 
ground balls are picked up.
If players are constantly running down to the other end of the field after a 
ground ball, chances are, you’re watching a good defense control the game. 
Also, you’re likely to see one or two players who just seem to have a nose for 
the ball and are always in the middle of a pile, fighting for that ground ball.
 
In box lacrosse, ground balls are known as loose balls.
Watching the goalie
The goalie is the backbone of the team. Watching a great goalie perform is a 
bit like watching a great artist at work. The best goalies rely not only on 
fundamental skills but also on their shot-saving creativity in goal.
In the following sections, we cover some things to look for in the goalie.

257
 Chapter 16: How to Watch Lacrosse
Playing the angles
Goalies who play the angles move around in goal more than you may expect. 
They’re looking to cut off any angle that an offensive player may have at a 
shot.
You’ll often see angle goalies reaching back to feel where they are in relation 
to the net — they try to keep themselves centered between the posts. And 
because they’ve usually cut off a shooter’s angle when they make a save, 
you’ll see a lot of body saves from angle goalies.
Relying on reflexes
Reflex-oriented goalies will make more stick, leg, or glove saves than body 
saves. That’s because they’re depending on their reflexes for seeing the ball 
as it approaches the net.
Reflex goalies still try to play the angles (see the preceding section), but 
they also tend to take more risks than angle goalies, thinking that their quick 
reflexes can save them from poor positioning.
Releasing the ball
After every stop, goalies have an opportunity to start the offense with a well-
timed and well-thrown pass. Scoring runs, for example, can be extended with 
a quick and accurate pass from a goalie to a fast-breaking offensive player.
Watching the game action
 
Any activity on the field or floor is relevant to the outcome of a lacrosse game, 
even if the clock isn’t ticking. In the following sections, we tell you what to 
watch for.
Winning the faceoff
Watch the faceoff strategy between the two teams. Some teams may place 
three players back on defense to defend against losing the faceoff. Other 
teams may place just two players on the defensive end, playing to win the 
faceoff and get an offensive start.
 
How they line up around the circle usually gives you a pretty good idea about 
whether a team is trying to score off the faceoff or just trying to get possession 
of the ball (or not let the other team get possession of it). You’ll also notice 
that teams have specific players who play the draw in almost every faceoff.

258
 Part IV: Following Lacrosse: The Fan’s Point of View 
Noting substitution patterns
Most coaches do have a specific substitution strategy for their players, 
but often that strategy is dismissed because of line changes made by the 
opposing team.
Teams try to match up their best defenders against the opposition’s best 
offensive players. So you’re bound to see a cat-and-mouse game between 
the two coaches as each tries to run players on and off the field or floor to 
get a matchup that’s in his favor. You can also keep track of which players 
play on both the offensive and defensive ends or which coaches operate an 
offense-defense strategy.
Monitoring injuries
Because of the physical nature of the game, players do suffer injuries. When 
a player leaves a game, make note of it and consider how his absence may 
influence the remainder of the game.
Spying on the fans
Lacrosse has passionate, loyal, and diehard fans. They dress with their 
home-team sweaters, hats, buttons, and colors. They get into the game, and 
anybody who hurts their team will hear about it, especially the referee.
Fans love to harass a referee about any little thing that may hurt the home 
team, no matter how legitimate the complaint may happen to be. You should 
get involved in the game — be a part of cheers and chants, wear the team 
colors — but maintain respect for the opposition and for the officials.
Closing out the game
In the last five minutes of a close game, hang onto your seat. Every possession 
could turn out to make the difference in the game. At this point in the game, 
you should be able to figure out who the real stars on each team are. With 
the game on the line, the best players — offensive and defensive — step up to 
challenge the opposition and find out who blinks first.
 
Look for the offensive player who handles the ball on every possession. He’s 
likely to be the one who wants the ball in that situation, the one who plays 
with composure and doesn’t panic. And he’s likely to score the game-winning 
goal.

259
 Chapter 16: How to Watch Lacrosse
But that star player needs help. He probably has a teammate who will 
sacrifice a little pain to set him up for that game-winning goal, stepping in 
front of the opposition’s best defender to set a crushing pick.
At the end of a close game, you’re almost guaranteed to see a one-on-one 
matchup between the best players on each team. Look for the little things 
that may give one player an edge over the other on that particular night, such 
as who looks more tired and who looks more alert at this stage of the game.
And then just sit back and enjoy. These one-on-one battles are what the 
game is all about — a healthy confrontation between a top scorer and a top 
defender to determine who’s the best.
Following Lacrosse on Television
Watching lacrosse on TV is a good way to keep up with your team’s rivals, in 
addition to watching your favorite team. But a televised game can’t match the 
entertainment value and intensity of watching a game in person. Plus, the ball 
moves so quickly that television cameras are often playing catch-up just to 
keep pace (though TV crews are getting better as more games are broadcast).
If you can’t get to the field and the big game is coming up, however, catch it 
at home. Televised lacrosse is fairly widely available, especially in lacrosse-
crazy areas of North America. And as with any sport, increased television 
coverage is monumentally crucial to the growth of lacrosse.
Calling it a night
Stick around after a game is over because you’ll 
see some interesting things. First, the players 
from both teams line up and shake hands. Now, 
these warriors have just beaten up on each 
other for four quarters, but like true athletes, 
they shake hands to thank their opponents for 
the game.
In the NLL, the league also has a post-game 
tradition in which the players run around the 
arena and wave to the fans to thank them for 
their support.
If you’re willing to hang around after a pro 
game, you may be able to get an autograph 
from your favorite player. In fact, your favorite 
player may be your teacher or your neighbor-
hood policeman or fireman — most players in 
the MLL and NLL work at another career.

CBS College Sports broadcasts the Division II and Division III championship 
games — and the Division I women’s national title game — which are also 
played over Memorial Day weekend.
Regular-season NCAA men’s and women’s games are broadcast live in select 
markets, with a game televised every spring week on WMAR in Baltimore.
High school lacrosse
Select varsity games are shown in some parts of the United States on cable 
TV and on the Internet. Perhaps the most extensive coverage of high school 
lacrosse is provided in the New York City area by the MSG Network. A weekly 
game of the week is shown on the MSG Network. In addition, MSG broadcasts 
a weekly lacrosse highlight show during the season called The Lax Report. 
Additional games are broadcast each week on the MSG Varsity channel, 
which launched in September 2009.
New ways to bring you the action
With advents in technology, lacrosse broad-
casts have evolved quite a bit the last few years 
and now include several new elements.
For example, the MSG Network in New York 
regularly attaches a portable microphone to 
high school players and coaches during games, 
and shows condensed highlights of what 
transpires during the subsequent week on its 
highlight show. The interaction between coach 
and player and coach and official is often very 
interesting.
Also interesting are the behind-the-scenes 
storylines that occur in lacrosse. During the 
2009 season, New Balance followed the 
Canandaigua, New York, varsity boys team from 
its first game to its last. The Braves’ final game 
was a 10-5 win against previously unbeaten 
Niskayuna in the Class B state championship 
game in Rochester. Marshall Johnson, a 
freshman (as of this writing) at Fairfield 
University, was followed extensively during 
the series. He had three goals and won 14 of 19 
faceoffs in the state final. You can’t script things 
much better than that.

Get ting in the Game
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the increasing popularity of high school and college lacrosse
▶ Noting the dramatic increase in attendance at the NCAA championships
▶ Getting acquainted with minor-league box lacrosse in Canada
T
he popularity of lacrosse continues to grow, so it makes sense that the 
number of participants and programs at the high school level has also 
surged. This increase at the high school level has transferred to colleges as 
well, where the number of college programs is up around the country.
What this means for you is, whether you’re a kid who’s interested in playing 
lacrosse yourself in high school, college, or beyond, or you’re a fan of the 
sport, you have plenty of opportunities in front of you. In this chapter, we 
fill you in on the growth of the sport at the high school and college levels, 
and give you some information on minor-league box lacrosse and the World 
Lacrosse Championship as well. (For information on the pros, check out 
Chapter 18.)
High School Highlights
High school lacrosse participation has experienced a massive amount of 
growth since 2000. According to the National Federation of High Schools, 
there were 74,225 high school boys and girls lacrosse players in 2000; by 
2008, according to US Lacrosse, the number had reached 218,823 players. 
As a result, the number of high schools offering the sport has also grown 
significantly. The State High School Association reports that lacrosse is the 
second-fastest growing sport in this decade. (Bowling is number one.)
Although lacrosse was traditionally popular in certain regions of the country — 
such as Long Island, Baltimore, and New York’s Hudson Valley — its popularity 
at the high school level (and beyond) has spread nationwide. The sport has 
caught on big time in states such as California, Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, 
North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, and Texas.

264
Part IV: Following Lacrosse: The Fan’s Point of View 
The following states officially sanction lacrosse as a championship sport 
at the high school varsity level: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, 
Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, 
New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, 
Tennessee, and Texas.
Ten tradition-rich high school boys’ 
lacrosse programs
Here’s a look at ten high school boys’ programs 
that are synonymous with success:
 ✓ Gilman School (Baltimore, Maryland): The 
Baltimore-based Greyhounds began and 
ended the 2009 season ranked number one 
in the final Under Armour/Inside Lacrosse 
2009 national rankings.
 ✓ West Genesee High School (West 
Genesee, New York): The Wildcats’ 
streak of seven straight state title-game 
appearances ended in 2009.
 ✓ Ward Melville High School (East Setauket, 
New York): The Patriots have played in 
the state championship game nine times, 
winning seven titles.
 ✓ Yorktown (Yorktown Heights, New York): 
Located in the lacrosse hotbed of the 
Hudson Valley, Yorktown has one of the 
most impressive streaks in the nation, with 
28 sectional championships since 1980 (as 
of this writing).
 ✓ Manhasset (Manhasset, New York): The 
alma mater of the legendary Jim Brown, 
there is no program with as long and rich a 
history as that of the Indians.
 ✓ Wilton (Wilton, Connecticut): The Warriors 
have won (as of this writing) a jaw-
dropping 20 state titles and 13 Fairfield 
County Interscholastic Athletic Conference 
championships.
 ✓ Darien (Darien, Connecticut): The Blue 
Wave won its fifth straight Class M state 
title in 2009 — a season in which coach Jeff 
Brameier picked up his 400th career win.
 ✓ West Islip (West Islip, New York): The 
Lions defeated Orchard Park 10-5 in the 
2009 Class A championship game for its 
third state title in four years.
 ✓ Garden City (Garden City, New York): 
Garden City fell to Manhasset in the 2009 
Woodstick Classic, the longest running 
continuous boys high school lacrosse 
rivalry in the nation. The Trojans had won 
11 of 12 meetings in the series, which dates 
back to 1935.
 ✓ McDonogh (Owings Mills, Maryland): 
The Maryland Interscholastic Athletic 
Association is a power-packed league that 
includes Gilman as well as McDonogh.
Many of the top boys’ programs also have 
exceptional girls programs as well, including 
McDonogh, Darien, West Genesee, Yorktown, 
and Garden City, to name a few.

 Chapter 17: Getting in the Game
College Corner
Though the traditional strength of U.S. collegiate lacrosse has been in the 
northeastern states and along the eastern seaboard, lacrosse has now found 
its way into the Midwest and into the West, with the programs at Ohio State, 
Notre Dame, Denver, and Air Force gaining prominence.
About 600 schools at the division I, II, III and junior-college levels field men’s 
and women’s lacrosse teams. The majority of men’s college programs — a 
total of 130 — compete at the Division III level. There are 35 Division II programs.
The Division I level, with 59 men’s teams in 2009, features the best talent 
and attracts the most attention from fans and media, thanks primarily to 
scholarships and much bigger budgets. Though Division I schools such as 
Michigan State University, the University of New Hampshire, and Boston 
College have recently dropped men’s lacrosse, other new programs such as 
Bellarmine University, the University of Detroit Mercy, Mercer University, 
and Jacksonville University have helped keep the number of teams at a 
steady level.
 
The level of parity in NCAA lacrosse has increased dramatically the last 
decade. Although the tradition-rich programs such as Johns Hopkins, 
Syracuse, Princeton, and Virginia remain in the national title chase, more 
programs than ever are in the hunt for postseason glory.
 
The most growth in collegiate lacrosse can be found on the women’s side, 
where there are now more than 300 programs — three times the number there 
were in 1990. As of this writing, more than 50 new Division III teams have been 
added since 1997.
 
The number of college lacrosse players increased 5.4 percent in 2008, 
according to US Lacrosse. There were a total of 29,822 players — 18,148 male 
and 11,674 female.
College lacrosse starts its official season in late February and culminates with 
the Division I men’s championship game on Memorial Day in late May. Teams 
play an average of about 15 regular-season games each spring, mostly on 
Saturday afternoons.
The culmination of every college lacrosse season is the Final Four, played on 
Memorial Day weekend and traditionally broadcast live on ESPN and ESPN2. 
The Division I men’s semifinals take place on Saturday; the Division II and III 
championships, on Sunday; and the Division I final, on Monday.

266
Part IV: Following Lacrosse: The Fan’s Point of View 
In the Division I tournament bracket, 16 teams compete for the title. Four 
teams make the Division II playoffs, and 22 teams vie for the Division III 
championship.
Since 2003, the Division I men’s final four has been regularly played at NFL 
stadiums, including Baltimore’s M & T Bank Stadium and Gillette Stadium in 
Foxborough, Massachusetts. It has grown into a massive event that now 
regularly draws crowds of more than 40,000 people.
 
The NCAA added a national championship for women’s lacrosse in 1982 with 
a Division I title game. (The men’s started awarding championships in 1971 at 
the D-I level.) A title game was added for Division III in 1985 and for Division II 
in 2001. Maryland has a Division I–leading nine national titles, including seven 
in a row from 1995 to 2001. A crowd of 6,515 attended Northwestern’s 21-7 
win over North Carolina in the 2009 NCAA D-I championship game at Towson 
University.
The NCAA isn’t the only place to play lacrosse at the college level. The Men’s 
Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA) is made up of 213 men’s teams 
in two divisions in the United States and Canada. The Women’s Collegiate 
Lacrosse League (WCLL) has been in existence since 1994 and is made up of 
40 teams; all told, there are 200 teams competing in the US Lacrosse Women’s 
Division I Intercollegiate Associates (WDIA), and the WCLL is just one of the 
leagues.
Talented players from far and wide
Most of the NCAA’s stars come from traditional 
hot-bed locations. For example, Syracuse 
stars Ryan, Casey, and Mike Powell grew up in 
upstate New York; Johns Hopkins legend Dave 
Pietramala came from Long Island; Princeton’s 
Jesse Hubbard played his prep lacrosse around 
Washington, D.C.; and Johns Hopkins’s Paul 
Rabil grew up playing in Maryland.
Plenty of Canadians have also made a large 
impact on the NCAA and that influence 
seems to be increasing as more players in 
Ontario and British Columbia are looking for 
scholarships at U.S. colleges. Legends such 
as Gary and Paul Gait and Tom Marechek (all 
three of whom went to Syracuse from British 
Columbia), Gavin Prout (who went from Ontario 
to Loyola College), and John Grant, Jr. (from 
Ontario to the University of Delaware), dominated 
college lacrosse during their tenures.
Colleges have also been tapping into overseas 
talent from such locations as Australia and 
England.

267
 Chapter 17: Getting in the Game
Introducing Minor-Level Box 
Lacrosse in Canada
 
Canadian box lacrosse at the minor level features three age levels, each with 
additional divisions, according to age or according to the quality of players:
 
✓ Minor lacrosse: A variety of leagues for players between the ages of 7 
and 20.
 
✓ Junior A and B leagues: For players ages 17 through 21. The A league 
features the better players.
 
✓ Major A and B leagues (also called Senior): For players over 21 years 
of age. These leagues also have the more highly skilled players at the A 
level.
Tradition-rich college programs
Here’s a look at some men’s collegiate pro-
grams that are synonymous with success:
 ✓ Johns Hopkins: Perhaps no college is as 
synonymous with a sport as Hopkins is 
with lacrosse. After all, at Hopkins — unlike 
most of the other top programs — lacrosse 
is the clear number-one sport. The Blue 
Jays have won nine NCAA championships.
 ✓ Syracuse: The roots of the Orange program 
date back to 1916, and its 11 national 
championships (as of this writing) are the 
most of any program in history. The list of 
legendary players who have worn Syracuse 
uniforms may also put SU at number one.
 ✓ Princeton: The Tigers appeared in eight 
Division I championship games from 1992 
to 2002, winning six times.
 ✓ Virginia: The Cavaliers have won three 
national titles since 1999 (as of this writing).
 ✓ Cornell: As of this writing, the Big Red have 
been to the NCAA title game seven times.
Few — if any — programs in any sport have 
risen to dominance in NCAA history faster 
than Northwestern University’s women’s 
program. After resuming play at the NCAA level 
in 2002 (following nine years as a club team), 
the Wildcats have, as of this writing, won five 
national titles and enjoyed two undefeated 
seasons.

268
Part IV: Following Lacrosse: The Fan’s Point of View 
With levels such as Tyke (ages 7 and 8), PeeWee (ages 11 and 12), and Midget 
(ages 15 and 16), minor-level lacrosse offers the greatest opportunity for 
young players to play the game. You can find minor leagues around Canada, 
called house leagues; they’re usually affiliated with a community’s arena. 
Teams typically are formed at the youngest ages, with the more successful 
teams staying together through the duration of their players’ minor careers. 
And the best of these teams — called rep teams — represent the community 
in national tournaments. At age 17, the best players from these house leagues 
reach the next level in a player draft conducted by teams in the Junior A and 
Junior B leagues.
The Junior and Senior leagues operate somewhat like professional or university 
competitive leagues. They’re made up of teams from communities primarily in 
Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta who draw on the best players in their 
particular house leagues. The teams then compete during the regular season 
for the right to participate in playoffs that can lead to a national championship 
series.
 
Because teams — franchises, almost — are responsible for fielding players, 
coaches, equipment managers, and so on, as well as for the fees required to 
maintain membership in a league, the number of teams participating may 
vary from year to year. In 2003, for example, three teams were added to the 
Junior B league of the Ontario Lacrosse Association, increasing the number of 
franchises from 22 in 2002 to 25 in 2003.
Other Canadian national trophies
Canadian lacrosse players have numerous 
national trophies to aim for. The following 
trophies are also highly coveted by players, 
coaches, and fans at other competitive levels:
 ✓ The Minto Cup: This trophy goes to the 
Canadian Lacrosse Association’s junior 
men’s league champion.
 ✓ The Mann Cup: This trophy goes to 
Canada’s senior men’s league champion.
 ✓ The President’s Cup: For the national box 
lacrosse champions at the Senior B level, 
this trophy was first awarded in 1964. Past 
champions have included the usual array of 
teams from Ontario and British Columbia, as 
well as three teams from Alberta — including 
the Edmonton Outlaws in 2002 — and a 
team from Tuscarora, New York, in 1994.
 ✓ The Founders Trophy: Since 1972, this 
trophy has been awarded to the national 
box lacrosse champions at the Junior B 
level. Nearly all past champions have come 
from the Province of Ontario.
 ✓ P. D. Ross Cup and Victory Trophy: Two 
divisions of senior men’s field lacrosse 
teams vie for these prizes, both first 
awarded in 1984.
 ✓ First Nations Trophy: Junior men’s field 
organizations compete for this championship, 
first awarded in 1985.

269
 Chapter 17: Getting in the Game
The champions of Junior A leagues from the Ontario Lacrosse Association 
(OLA) and the British Columbia Lacrosse Association (BCLA) compete for the 
Minto Cup. The championship is a best-of-seven series. The Junior A playoff 
participants are determined by a regular-season schedule. Between April and 
July, teams in the BCLA play a 24-game schedule. The OLA starts the season a 
little later (in May), and plays a 20-game schedule through July.
Taking on the world: The World 
Lacrosse Championship
The pride of wearing your home country’s 
sweater in competitive lacrosse started in 1967, 
the year of Canada’s centennial celebration. 
Canada invited the United States, England, and 
Australia to compete in an international amateur 
field lacrosse tournament, the beginning of the 
World Lacrosse Championship, now held every 
four years and sponsored by the Federation 
of International Lacrosse. Nations compete 
in a weighted round-robin tournament during 
which higher-ranked teams play an easier 
schedule based on their record in the previous

▶ Getting to know the top pro players
S
ure, lacrosse’s popularity has surged at the youth, high school, and 
college levels throughout the United States. But as a lacrosse fan, you’re 
not limited to watching amateurs play. Whether you’re a fan of field lacrosse 
or box, you can get your fill of the best that lacrosse has to offer in Major 
League Lacrosse (MLL) and the National Lacrosse League (NLL).
In this chapter, we fill you in on both leagues, and let you know which teams 
are in each league, how long each league’s season lasts, what the teams play 
for, and what the playoff structure is like.
Everything You Need to Know 
about Major League Lacrosse
The genesis of Major League Lacrosse came when fitness guru Jake Steinfeld 
read a 1998 Spin magazine story documenting the surge in popularity of 
lacrosse. Steinfeld discussed the idea of forming a pro field lacrosse league 
with one of the story’s contributors, Warrior Lacrosse president Dave 
Morrow. Tim Robertson, the former CEO of the Family Channel, teamed up 
with Steinfeld and Morrow to launch the league, which made its debut with 
Summer Showcase exhibition games at six sites in 2000. The league began 
play in 2001, giving field lacrosse a professional league of its own. (For more 
on the history of the MLL, check out the nearby sidebar, “Major League 
Lacrosse: The early years.”)
In the following sections, we fill you in on the MLL itself, as well as some of 
the best players to ever play in the league.

League basics
In an effort to create more scoring and more excitement, the MLL made some 
dramatic changes to field lacrosse rules, including eliminating the restraining 
box, adding a 60-second shot clock, and adding a 2-point goal line for shots 
from 16 yards out from the goal.
Major League Lacrosse: The early years
Here’s a look at some key dates in the formation 
and introduction of Major League Lacrosse:
 ✓ February 1999: Jake Steinfeld, Dave 
Morrow, and Tim Robertson partner up to 
form the league.
 ✓ July–August 2000: Summer Showcase 
exhibition games are played at six sites.
 ✓ January 13, 2001: Goaltender Sal LoCascio 
is selected by Bridgeport as the number-
one choice in the inaugural MLL draft.
 ✓ March 8, 2001: The league unveils 
names and logos for its teams at a press 
conference in New York City.
 ✓ June 7, 2001: Baltimore beats Long Island 
16-13 in the first game in MLL history. Chris 
Turner of Baltimore holds the distinction of 
being the first player to score a goal in the 
history of the league.
 ✓ August 2, 2001: Mark Millon of Baltimore 
has three goals and four assists and is 
named MVP in the league’s first all-star 
game, called the MLL LacrosseStar Game. 
It was played at the Ballpark at Harbor Yard 
in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
 ✓ September 1, 2001: The first Major League 
Lacrosse playoff games are played as Long 
Island beats Rochester and Baltimore 
defeats Boston in the semifinals at Kennedy 
Stadium in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
 ✓ September 3, 2001: Paul Gait of Long Island 
scores seven goals to earn MVP honors as 
Long Island beats Baltimore 15-11 in the 
inaugural MLL championship game.
 ✓ June 6, 2002: The MLL meets the NFL when 
the league plays a game at an NFL stadium 
for the first time as the Baltimore Bayhawks 
defeat the Rochester Rattlers 13-10 at 
Ravens Stadium.
 ✓ July 21, 2002: The league’s orange 
“grippy” ball debuts in the second annual 
all-star game, which is played at Prince 
George’s Stadium in Bowie, Maryland. The 
fluorescent orange ball has been the MLL’s 
official game ball ever since.
 ✓ September 1, 2002: Baltimore beats Long 
Island 21-13 at the second annual MLL 
championship game, which was played 
at Crew Stadium in Columbus, Ohio. Mark 
Millon has five goals and two assists for the

win their second MLL title in three years, 
beating Baltimore 15-14 in overtime 
at Villanova Stadium in Villanova, 
Pennsylvania.
 ✓ May 22, 2004: The MLL meets the West 
Coast for the first time as the league 
game between Baltimore and Rochester 
is played at Seahawks Stadium in Seattle, 
Washington. Baltimore wins 24-18.

273
 Chapter 18: Keeping Up with the Pros
 
Up until the 2009 season, the league limited the number of long-stick 
defensemen on the field to three (from the traditional four). The change to 
four long poles makes the MLL more consistent with the collegiate and high 
school levels.
As of this writing, there are now six teams in Major League Lacrosse:
 
✓ Boston Cannons
 
✓ Chicago Machine
 
✓ Denver Outlaws
 
✓ Long Island Lizards
 
✓ Toronto Nationals
 
✓ Washington Bayhawks (formerly of Baltimore)
The Cannons, Lizards, and Bayhawks all started play when the league made 
its debut in 2001. The Machine and Outlaws launched in 2006 as the league 
expanded to the western part of the United States. The MLL went beyond the 
U.S. border prior to the 2009 season with the addition of the Nationals.
Five MLL teams ceased operations after the 2008 season because of financial 
reasons. The Toronto Nationals were formed after they bought the rights to 
the Rochester Rattlers, assuming the Rattlers’ staff and player personnel.
One of those five defunct teams, the Philadelphia Barrage, won a league-
leading three MLL championships.
Each MLL team plays a 12-game regular season that totals 36 games among 
the teams. The regular season begins in mid-May and lasts until early August.
The top teams in each of the MLL’s two divisions advance to the semifinals. The 
teams with the best records regardless of division also make the semifinals. 
The MLL championship is played in late August over the course of one week-
end, with the two semifinals on Saturday and the championship, called the 
Steinfeld Cup, on Sunday.
MLL teams are made up of 19 players per team during games, most of whom 
were former NCAA Division I stars. The majority of the players in the league 
are from the United States, but a growing number are from Canada. (For more 
on the top MLL players, check out the next section.)
The top players
Major League Lacrosse has a long list of players familiar to fans of the college 
game. Here’s a look at 25 of the best:

274
Part IV: Following Lacrosse: The Fan’s Point of View 
 
✓ Matt Bocklet: A ground-ball machine for Johns Hopkins, Bocklet, one of 
three brothers who went on to play at the Division I level, is now starring 
for the Denver Outlaws after playing his inaugural MLL season with the 
Washington Bayhawks.
 
✓ Ryan Boyle: The four-time all-American at Princeton was a new arrival in 
Boston for the 2009 season. Boyle was a key member of the Philadelphia 
Barrage’s MLL title teams in 2006 and 2007. Also a standout in the NLL, 
he was NLL rookie of the year in 2005 with the New York Titans.

career-points leader is a fan favorite for the Long Island Lizards. He grew 
up in Farmingdale, Long Island.
 
✓ Jake Deane: Known as “Jake the Snake,” the former University of 
Massachusetts star is a defenseman for the Chicago Machine. The 
6'3", 200-pound native of Annapolis, Maryland, was nicknamed “The

four assists per game as a senior at Towson in 1999, has been getting his 
point(s) across for the Long Island Lizards.
 
✓ John Grant, Jr.: Grant has been an impact player in the league since it 
started play in 2001, when he starred for Rochester. (He took a two-
year hiatus from the league from 2002 through 2004, but he’s been 
unstoppable since.) Grant, who is also an NLL star, won MLL MVP 
honors in both 2007 and 2008.
 
✓ Zack Greer: After a storied career at Duke University in which he 
became the NCAA’s all-time leading goal scorer, and one season at 
Bryant University under former Duke coach Mike Pressler, the attackman 
made an immediate impact with the Long Island Lizards for the 2009 
season, his first in the professional ranks. Greer’s brother, Bill, plays for 
the NLL’s New York Titans.

275
 Chapter 18: Keeping Up with the Pros
 
✓ Kevin Huntley: The former Johns Hopkins star wasted little time 
showing his abilities at the pro level, earning 2008 rookie of the year 
honors. He joined the Washington Bayhawks in 2009 after playing the 
previous season for the Los Angeles Riptide.
 
✓ Kevin Leveille: An attackman for the Chicago Machine, the former 
University of Massachusetts all-American was named the MLL’s most 
improved player in 2005 and was among the leading candidates for MLL 
MVP in 2008.
 
✓ Sean Lindsay: An all-American at Syracuse University, he has made a big 
impact for several MLL teams. Most recently, the midfielder is starring 
for the Denver Outlaws.

star who plays for the Toronto Nationals won the league’s defensive 
player of the year award from 2006 through 2008.

Rattlers, the former University at Albany star goaltender joined the 
Toronto Nationals for the 2009 season.

has been a professional player for just two years, plays for the Boston 
Cannons. He has the size, speed, and shooting ability to be a perennial 
MLL star.
 
✓ Jesse Schwartzman: A two-time Johns Hopkins University all-American 
and a member of the Denver Outlaws, Schwartzman is one of the 
league’s top goaltenders.
 
✓ Alex Smith: After shattering faceoff marks for the University of 
Delaware, Smith did the very same thing during the 2008 season for 
Rochester, winning 249 of them.
 
✓ Kyle Sweeney: A three-time all-American long-stick midfielder for 
Georgetown, Sweeney has emerged as an MLL mainstay.
 
✓ Merrick Thomson: The Toronto attackman and former University at 
Albany star had played for the New Jersey Pride, one of the MLL 
franchises that folded. He was named the MLL’s most improved player 
for 2008.

276
Part IV: Following Lacrosse: The Fan’s Point of View 
 
✓ Joe Walters: A Jack Turnbull winner as attackman of the year, Atlantic 
Coast Conference player of the year, and four-time all-American at the 
University of Maryland, Walters is scoring big for the Toronto Nationals.

Massachusetts star, who plays for Toronto, has emerged as one of the 
MLL’s top scorers.
Everything You Need to Know about 
the National Lacrosse League
The National Lacrosse League is an 11-team indoor league that is played 
during the winter months. Its origins are in Canada, where it still holds the 
bulk of its popularity. (For more on the NLL’s history, see the nearby sidebar 
“Building on history: Professional lacrosse through the decades.”)
In the following sections, we fill you in on the NLL itself, as well as some of 
the best players to ever play in the league.
League basics
The National Lacrosse League (NLL) fields 11 teams, divided into two divi-
sions (Eastern and Western):
Eastern Division
Western Division
Boston Blazers
Calgary Roughnecks
Buffalo Bandits
Colorado Mammoth
New York Titans
Edmonton Rush
Philadelphia Wings
Minnesota Swarm
Rochester Knighthawks
San Jose Stealth
Toronto Rock

 Chapter 18: Keeping Up with the Pros
During a season that runs from early January through late April, each team 
plays 16 regular-season games: 8 at home and 8 away. Each team plays both 
home and away games with every other team in its division. Most games are 
played on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.
Building on history: Professional 
lacrosse through the decades
In 1931, a group of hockey promoters came 
up with the idea to create a professional box 
lacrosse league. They wanted their hockey 
arenas to be in use during the summer, and 
they wanted to keep their players in shape 
for hockey during the winter. The Canadian 
Professional Indoor Lacrosse League formed 
with four teams — the Montreal Canadians, 
the Montreal Maroons, the Toronto Maple 
Leafs, and the Cornwall Colts — using players 
from their hockey teams. Although the league 
enjoyed a successful first season, it closed 
down in 1932, but not before introducing the 
lacrosse world to a new game. Though several 
modifications to the field game were made, the 
indoor lacrosse game was basically the field 
game played in an enclosed space.
The number of players was reduced from 12 
to 7 (and then down to 6 in the 1950s). From 
the wide-open field game, lacrosse was 
transformed to a hard-checking game when 
cross-checking was introduced, and games 
were played in a restricted boarded area. 
This new lacrosse came to be known as box 
lacrosse, or boxla.
In 1968, the National Lacrosse Association 
began play in eight cities in Canada and the 
United States. The teams were the Montreal 
Canadians, the Toronto Maple Leafs, the 
Detroit Olympics, the Peterborough Lakers, the 
Vancouver Carlings, the Victoria Shamrocks, 
the New Westminster Salmonbellies, and 
the Portland (Oregon) Adanacs. This league 
introduced the 30-second clock to speed up the 
game, but the league only lasted until 1969.
An earlier incarnation of the National Lacrosse 
League made a go of it in 1974 and 1975. Again, 
teams were based in both the United States and 
Canada, but the league wasn’t successful. Over 
the two years of play, the league fielded teams 
in Baltimore, Boston, Long Island, Montreal, 
Philadelphia, Quebec, Rochester, Syracuse, 
and Toronto.
Then came the National Lacrosse League, 
which started play in 1987 as the Eagle Pro Box 
Lacrosse League, with four teams playing a 
six-game schedule. In 1988, the league upped 
the schedule to eight games, and in 1989, the 
league became the Major Indoor Lacrosse 
League (MILL), with six teams playing an eight-
game schedule. Just before the 1998 season, 
the MILL abandoned its single-entity ownership 
strategy — that is, teams were operated by the 
league itself — in favor of franchise ownership 
by individuals, and renamed the reorganized 
league the National Lacrosse League.

Part IV: Following Lacrosse: The Fan’s Point of View 
While some professional athletes may claim that they play “for the love of the 
game,” this cliché is a way of life for players in the NLL, who are effectively 
moonlighters in a profession that they love. Because the maximum player 
salary in the league is $23,000, players have to report to their regular (if not 
necessarily first-love) jobs during the week.
Eight teams — the top four from both divisions — earn playoff berths. First-
round matchups pit each division champ against the fourth-place finisher in 
their divisions in the semifinals. The number-two and number-three seeds in 
each division meet in the other semifinal. The higher-seeded teams host the 
games. The winners of those games then meet in the Eastern and Western 
division championship finals. The winners of the divisional finals series meet 
for the NLL Championship Game.
Each NLL team can dress 18 players and 2 goalies for each game; a team 
carries 23 players on its roster with 3 practice players. The league draws 
players from all over North America, whether the sources are NCAA field 
lacrosse or Canadian junior and senior associations. The team rosters are 
still primarily filled by Canadian players. Approximately 70 percent of players 
are from Canada. That statistic represents the prevalence of box lacrosse as 
the preferred style of play in Canada.
Still, the number of NCAA players in the league is moving upward. Some of 
the NLL’s top players had no box lacrosse experience when they entered the 
league, coming out of NCAA field-lacrosse traditions. These top players (and 
the U.S. universities where they played) include
 
✓ Jake Bergey (Salisbury State University)
 
✓ Paul Cantabene (Loyola College)
 
✓ Roy Colsey (Syracuse University)
 
✓ Hugh Donovan (Bucknell University)
 
✓ Jamie Hanford (Loyola College)
 
✓ Mike Law (Denver University)
 
✓ Brian Reese (University of Maryland)
 
✓ Mike Regan (Butler University)
 
✓ Tom Ryan (Bowdoin College)
 
✓ Tim Soudan (University of Massachusetts)

 Chapter 18: Keeping Up with the Pros
Growing pains
The professional sports world is littered 
with failed franchises and leagues, from the 
American Basketball Association of the late 
1960s and 1970s (remember the red, white, and 
blue basketballs?) to the United States Football 
League of the mid-1980s (at least no red, white, 
and blue footballs) to the North American 
Soccer League (which operated from 1967 
through 1984 and gave North American soccer 
fans an opportunity to see the remarkable Pelé 
in action).
The National Lacrosse League has had its 
share of disappointments as well (but signs of 
steady growth exist, including plans to expand 
even further to perhaps as many as 24 teams). 
The following franchises have been forced to 
pull the plug during the league’s history:
 ✓ Albany Attack, 2000–2004 (relocated to 
become San Jose Stealth)
 ✓ Anaheim Storm, 2004–2005
 ✓ Arizona Sting, 2004–2007
 ✓ Baltimore Thunder, 1987–1999 (relocated to 
become Pittsburgh CrosseFire)
 ✓ Boston/New England Blazers, 1989–1998
 ✓ Charlotte Cobras, 1996
 ✓ Chicago Shamrox, 2007–2008
 ✓ Columbus Landsharks, 2001–2003 (relo-
cated to become Arizona Sting)
 ✓ Detroit Turbos, 1989–1994
 ✓ Montreal Express, 2001–2002
 ✓ New Jersey Saints, 1987–1988 (relocated to 
become New York Saints)
 ✓ New Jersey Storm, 2002–2003 (relocated to 
become Anaheim Storm)
 ✓ New York Saints, 1989–2003
 ✓ Ontario Raiders, 1998 (relocated to become 
Toronto Rock)
 ✓ Ottawa Rebel, 2001–2003
 ✓ Pittsburgh Bulls, 1990–1993
 ✓ Pittsburgh CrosseFire, 2000 (relocated to 
become Washington Power)
 ✓ Syracuse Smash, 1999–2000 (relocated to 
become Ottawa Rebel)
 ✓ Vancouver Ravens, 2002–2004
 ✓ Washington Power, 2001–2002 (relocated 
to become Colorado Mammoth)
 ✓ Washington Wave, 1987–1989
 
When attending an NLL game, check out each team’s roster for players from 
your hometown (or nearby). Especially if you come from Ontario or British 
Columbia, or from the northeastern United States, you’re likely to find some-
one on a team to watch.

Part IV: Following Lacrosse: The Fan’s Point of View 
The top players
The National Lacrosse League has been filled with phenomenal players, but 
here’s a look at 25 of the best:
 
✓ Anthony Cosmo: The Boston Blazer is a three-time NLL all-star goal-
tender who was the league’s 2007 goalie of the year. He launched his pro 
career in 2001 with Toronto.
 
✓ Dan Dawson: An effective feeder and finisher for the Boston Blazers, 
Dawson, an Ontario native, combines exceptional stick skills with good 
size at 6'2" and 220 pounds.
 
✓ Dane Dobbie: Though small at 5'8" and 160 pounds, the Calgary 
Roughnecks standout is an accomplished scorer known for his left-
handed shooting ability — including strong outside shooting — and a 
strong, well-rounded game.
 
✓ Colin Doyle: Known as “Popeye,” Doyle has been an NLL star since he 
joined the league in 1998. Now with the San Jose Stealth, he’s the first 
player in league history to be named playoff MVP three times (in 1999, 
2002, and 2005). He was also named league MVP in 2005.
 
✓ Rhys Duch: Duch, the NLL rookie of the year for the 2009 season, set the 
league record for points by a first-year player with 89 (with 35 goals and 
54 assists). The former Stony Brook University standout helped the San 
Jose Stealth make the 2009 Western Division final.
 
✓ Scott Evans: The fifth overall selected in the 2003 NLL draft, he went 
on to make the league’s all-rookie team and continued to star for the 
Rochester Knighthawks for the next four seasons before suffering a torn 
anterior cruciate ligament, which sidelined him for the 2009 season.
 
✓ Shawn Evans: The younger brother of fellow Rochester Knighthawks 
star Scott Evans and Chicago Shamrocks assistant coach Stephen Evans, 
Shawn had four goals and six assists in a 15-14 win over the Buffalo 
Bandits in March 2009.
 
✓ Athan Iannucci: A first-round draft choice (eighth overall) by the 
Philadelphia Wings out of Hofstra, Iannucci hasn’t disappointed. He 
broke Gary Gait’s NLL record for goals in a season by scoring his 61st in 
April 2008 in just his second year of pro lacrosse. Earlier in the year, he 
became the first NLL player in 12 years to be named the league’s player 
of the month for back-to-back months.
 
✓ Tracey Kelusky: After making his NLL debut in 2000, Kelusky led the 
Calgary Roughnecks to the 2004 NLL Championship. The next season, he 
was named MVP of the NLL’s all-star game.

281
 Chapter 18: Keeping Up with the Pros
 
✓ Brian Langtry: He will always be fondly remember by fans of the 
Colorado Mammoth as the player who scored the first goal in franchise 
history — a 13-12 double-overtime victory against the Toronto Rock 
in 2003. Five years later, the native of Massapequa, New York, enjoyed 
another unforgettable outing, scoring nine goals to go along with four 
assists in a loss to the Portland LumberJax. Langtry also plays in the 
MLL as a member of the Denver Outlaws.
 
✓ Ken Montour: In his third tour of duty with the Buffalo Bandits, Montour 
was the 2009 NLL goaltender of the year. Named to play in the 2009 NLL 
all-star game, Montour led the league with a goals-against average of 
9.57 (making him the only starting goalie to average fewer than ten goals 
allowed per game) and a save percentage of 81.3.
 
✓ Bruce Murray: The Colorado Mammoth’s two-time all-star leads what is 
considered to be the premier defense in the NLL.
 
✓ Sean Pollock: Known for scoring clutch goals, the forward joined the 
Minnesota Swarm during its 2005 expansion season after playing as a 
rookie in 2004 with the Arizona Sting.
 
✓ Casey Powell: The first overall choice in the 1998 NLL draft, Powell 
started his pro career with the Rochester Knighthawks. Most recently, 
the Syracuse University legend has starred for the New York Titans, an 
expansion team that joined the league in 2006. He earned a spot in the 
all-star game for the 2007, 2008, and 2009 seasons.
 
✓ Lewis Ratcliff: The Toronto Rock standout, a native of London, England, 
was named MVP of the 2006 all-star game, when he scored four goals, 
including the winner with 4 seconds remaining.
 
✓ Josh Sanderson: Known simply as “Shooter,” the Calgary Roughneck 
has been named to the NLL’s all-pro team six teams. He shared the NLL’s 
single-season assist mark of 74 with Dan Dawson. Sanderson has a pair 
of cousins — Phil and Nate — who also play in the NLL.
 
✓ Mark Steenhuis: Despite the fact that he didn’t start playing lacrosse 
until he was 17 years old, Steenhuis has made a major impact. The 
Buffalo Bandits star is known as much for his bright orange shoes and 
long, curly, blond hair as he is for his exploits on the field. That’s not to 
say he’s not one of the premier players in pro lacrosse, though: He’s the 
first player in league history to be named MVP in multiple all-star games, 
earning the award in 2004, 2007, and 2009. Plus, he set the NLL single-
game mark for points (17) and assists (13) in February 2009.
 
✓ John Tavares: The Toronto native is the NLL’s all-time leader in career 
points, goals, and assists. He has played his entire NLL career with the 
Buffalo Bandits, since the team’s 1992 debut.

282
Part IV: Following Lacrosse: The Fan’s Point of View 
 
✓ Mike Thompson: He teams with Ken Montour (see earlier in this list) 
to give the Bandits perhaps the best goalie tandem in pro lacrosse. The 
duo teamed up to lead the Bandits to the 2008 NLL title; Thompson, a 
native of Akwesasne, Ontario, made 39 saves in the Champion’s Cup.
 
✓ Kaleb Toth: The second overall pick in the 1999 NLL draft, Toth, a 
Calgary native, has played with the Calgary Roughnecks since 2001. 
The 6'1", 205-pound right-hander is known for having one of the hardest 
shots in the league.
 
✓ Daryl Veltman: The left-handed shooting attackman for the Boston 
Blazers was the first pick overall in the 2008 NLL draft. Veltman’s uncle, 
Jim Veltman, a former Toronto Rock captain, is the NLL’s all-time leader 
in loose balls.
 
✓ Drew Westervelt: One of the leading scorers in the NCAA during his 
career at the University of Maryland–Baltimore County, the Philadelphia 
Wings attackman earned a spot in the 2009 NLL all-star game.
 
✓ Luke Wiles: The Toronto Rock forward, who was named to the 2006 NLL 
all-rookie team, has quickly emerged as one of the league’s rising talents. 
He was given the nickname “The Show” when he was in high school.
 
✓ Shawn Williams: A six-time NLL all-star, the Rochester Knighthawks for-
ward, a left-hander, is equally adept at scoring and dishing out assists.
 
✓ Jeff Zywicki: A former University of Massachusetts star, Zywicki scored 
a combined 88 goals and 160 points for the San Jose Stealth in the 2008 
and 2009 seasons. He and Colin Doyle (see earlier in this list) combine to 
form one of the most potent one-two scoring combos in pro lacrosse.

ost of these top ten men’s and women’s players are well-known. 
Others have made significant accomplishments despite flying under 
the radar just a bit. All have had major impacts on the game.
Jen Adams
This southern Australia native is regarded as the best player in the history of 
women’s lacrosse. A 2001 University of Maryland graduate, Adams is a three-
time national player of the year, starred on four teams that won national 
titles, and finished her career as the all-time NCAA leader in career points 
(445) and assists (178). She also led Australia to its first world title in nearly 
20 years when it won the 2005 World Cup. A natural right-hander who also 
frequently used her left hand, Adams was known for her strong stick skills 
and deceptive moves to the goal.
Kelly Amonte Hiller
Amonte Hiller is known today as a championship coach who built the 
Northwestern women’s team into a perennial national champion, but she 
was equally accomplished as a player. She was a four-time all-American at 
Maryland, where she is the school’s all-time leader in goals (187), assists 
(132), and points (319). She led the Terrapins to national titles in 1995 and 
1996, earning national player of the year honors both seasons. She was 
named to the All-World team at the 2005 World Cup.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Jim Brown
Best known for his football exploits, Brown once said, “I’d rather play 
lacrosse six days a week and football on the seventh.” The three-time All-
State star for Manhasset High School enjoyed a groundbreaking career at 
Syracuse University, where he was a two-time all-American. With no profes-
sional lacrosse opportunities available, he wound up becoming a National 
Football League Hall-of-Famer with the Cleveland Browns.
Roy Colsey
Few players in the game’s history have had the combination of Colsey’s 
strength, stamina, and one-on-one scoring ability. A prototypical two-way 
midfielder, Colsey was a first-team all-American for Syracuse University in 
1993, 1994, and 1995, and was Division I midfielder of the year in 1995. He 
enjoyed similar success at the professional level, as a four-time Major League 
Lacrosse (MLL) all-star. He also played for four National Lacrosse League 
(NLL) teams and was a member of the 2006 U.S. men’s national team.
Gary Gait
No matter what the level of lacrosse, Gait made a monumental impact, 
starting with his days at Syracuse University, where he was a three-time, 
first-team all-American and two-time NCAA player of the year while starring 
alongside his twin brother, Paul (see the next section). Gait made an impact 
right from the start of his NLL career in 1991, when he began setting records 
and winning awards, including rookie of the year in his first season with the 
Detroit Turbos. Known as a strong one-on-one player who could score from 
anywhere on the floor, Gait retired from the NLL in 2005 after being a peren-
nial all-star. He also coached in the league (with the Colorado Mammoth). 
Gait has also had a distinguished player career in the MLL, including a four-
year stint as player/coach of the Baltimore Bayhawks. He is now the head 
coach of Syracuse University’s women’s team.

 Chapter 19: Ten of the Greatest Men’s and Women’s Lacrosse Players
Paul Gait
Like his identical twin (see the preceding section), Paul was a strong one-
on-one player who could score consistently from inside and outside. Just 
like Gary, Paul enjoyed a star-studded career at Syracuse University and was 
named the most outstanding player of the 1989 NCAA tournament. He played 
in the NLL for 12 years and was selected to ten all-star teams. A chronically 
bad back prevented him from reaching even greater heights, and he retired 
from competitive play after the 2002 season, a season that saw him earn his 
first most valuable player award. Paul has won three NLL championships: 
Detroit in 1991, Philadelphia in 1994, and Rochester in 1997. Out of their 12 
years in the league, Paul and Gary played together for seven seasons. And 
like Gary, Paul is making his mark in coaching: He now guides the NLL’s 
Rochester Knighthawks.
Tom Marechek
Known for his wizardry with the stick and behind-the-back shots, this British 
Columbia native has been an impact player on championship teams in the 
collegiate ranks and in both the MLL and NLL. After forming an incomparable 
triumvirate at Syracuse University with Gary and Paul Gait, Marechek, who 
was a four-time all-American for the Orange, started his pro career in 1994.
Dave Pietramala
There may be no more high-profile position in the lacrosse world than that 
of head coach of the Johns Hopkins University men’s team. Pietramala 
has thrived in that position for the last ten years, guiding the Blue Jays to 
national titles and national prominence. That’s a role he had already served 
in to perfection as a player. The 1990 Hopkins graduate distinguished him-
self as one of the greatest defensemen in the history of the game, earning 
first-team all-American honors three times. A native of Hicksville, New York, 
Pietramala was twice named the nation’s most outstanding defenseman.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Casey Powell
After a groundbreaking career at Syracuse University in which he was a four-time 
all-American (making the first team three times), Powell has starred at the pro-
fessional level in both the MLL and NLL. The 6'1" attackman, who was a Division I 
Most Outstanding Player twice, is the oldest of the Powell brothers — a trio that 
includes former Syracuse stars Ryan and Mikey.
Mikey Powell
The most highly decorated recruit in Syracuse University history, Powell 
didn’t disappoint. He became the first player ever to win the Turnbull Award 
(as the top attackman in Division I) four times and was a four-time, first-team 
all-American at Syracuse. In 2001, he became the first freshman all-American 
in Syracuse history. As a high school star in Carthage, New York, he shat-
tered state records for points (194) and assists (120) in a season and points 
in a game (15).
More Lacrosse Greats
From Jack Turnbull, who starred at Johns Hopkins in the 1930s, to Paul Rabil, 
who did the same for the Blue Jays through 2008, scores of impact players 
have helped shape the game. Among the more noteworthy of late, in addi-
tion to Rabil, are Jake Berey; Rick Beardsley; Ted Dowling; Kevin Finneran; 
John Grant, Jr.; Kyle Harrison; Duane Jacobs; Mark Millon; Matt Panetta; Ryan 
Powell; Alex Smith; John Tavares; Frank Urso; and Jim Veltman.

Ten Reasons to Get Excited 
about Lacrosse
In This Chapter
▶ Focusing on the play
▶ Appreciating the atmosphere
▶ Taking part in the camaraderie
L
acrosse is an exciting game, played in an exciting atmosphere by men 
and women and boys and girls who love and respect the game. Here are 
ten of the many reasons for you to get excited about the fastest game on two 
feet.
Lacrosse Is a Magical Game to Watch
You’ll be amazed at the wizardry that players work with a stick, especially 
those at the professional level. From the best stick handlers, you’ll see fakes 
with the stick, behind-the-back shots and passes, pinpoint passes, no-look 
passes, and perfect simple passes.
They even dazzle their opponents and the game’s fans with such plays as the 
hidden ball trick, in which one player fake-flips the ball to a teammate and 
hangs onto the ball. This trick still works against even the most experienced 
players — anyone can be fooled when he’s not paying attention to what’s 
happening in the game.
Players and fans alike appreciate all this stick work, because they recognize 
how long and how hard players have practiced to refine and execute these 
skills. These players have a seemingly innate ability to perform magic with 
the stick and ball. Most of us could practice for hours and hours every day 
and never come close to what these great players can do.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Lacrosse Is Simple to Play 
but Hard to Learn
If you’ve never played the game, but you appreciate lacrosse as a fan, get 
your hands on a stick and find out how hard and frustrating it is to pass or 
shoot the ball and hit a target. After a number of futile attempts, you’ll have 
an even greater appreciation for the skills of passing and shooting.
After you’ve mastered the skills of the game so that you don’t have to think 
too much about what you’re doing, but instead can just execute a game plan, 
lacrosse becomes easy — relatively speaking, of course. All you have to do 
is shoot the ball and put it into the opposition’s goal. And if you don’t have 
the ball, you just try to stop the opposition from scoring. Although you can 
still learn a variety of methods to achieve those two simple goals, the game 
always comes down to scoring and preventing your opponent from scoring.
Lacrosse Is Fast Paced
The tempo of the game makes lacrosse exciting. It offers constant up-and-
down action. Players are running around all over the place. The ball is being 
fired quickly around the playing surface and at the goalie. The goalie gets in 
the action by passing the ball up the field or floor to a breaking teammate, 
quickening the pace of the game even more. And offenses use plays such as 
the pick and roll or the screen to free up players so that they can attack the 
goal quickly. It’s organized chaos.
Lacrosse Is High Scoring
The ultimate rarity in sports may be a shutout in lacrosse. Shutouts almost 
never happen. In fact, games that don’t reach double figures in goals are the 
exception rather than the rule. Lacrosse arguably has the perfect amount of 
scoring — not too much (like, say, basketball) or too little (like, oh, soccer). 
The average lacrosse game has a good amount of goals to be sure, but not so 
many that they lose significance.
Because lacrosse is high scoring, a team is almost never out of it — unless 
the game is a blowout. A string of faceoff wins and quick goals can easily 
pull a team back into the game. A recent example: Syracuse’s 10-9 overtime 
win over Cornell in the 2009 NCAA Division I men’s championship game. The 
Orange, who fell behind 9-6 with 5:37 remaining in the fourth quarter, tied it 
on a goal by Kenny Nims with 4.5 seconds left in regulation before winning it 
on a goal by Cody Jamieson in overtime.

291
 Chapter 20: Ten Reasons to Get Excited about Lacrosse
Lacrosse Has a Great Feel — Literally
One of the real reasons that players love to play lacrosse is because of the 
tremendous feeling you get just throwing the ball and having it go where 
you want. Players experience great exhilaration when the ball hits the twine 
of the net in goal. Male lacrosse players like to deliver a good, clean hit 
that stops a stick handler from getting by. (Contact is not permitted in the 
women’s game.) Goalies relish the challenge of stopping a player one-on-one. 
And players take great satisfaction in absorbing a hit yet still rolling past the 
player who’s trying his hardest not to get beaten. These one-on-one battles 
really get the competitive juices flowing and provide a feeling of satisfaction 
when you win the battle.
Lacrosse Is a Fair-Weather Friend
In box lacrosse, the weather is always fine. You go to the arena on a rainy day 
and walk past soccer players getting drenched in the rain or baseball players 
shivering from the cold and think to yourself, “Boy, am I glad to be playing 
inside tonight.”
Field lacrosse has its great-weather moments as well. There’s not much to 
beat the atmosphere of the well-played contest on the soft green grass on a 
crisp, sunny day in spring. The enormous increase in the number of turf sur-
faces has vastly improved playing conditions on the field during wet weather. 
In fact, except for when there’s thunder or lightning, a field lacrosse game is 
rarely canceled or postponed.
The college game can be a different story. Because the championships must 
be concluded by Memorial Day weekend, the season starts in mid to late 
February, which can be problematic in the Northeast — especially for those 
colleges that don’t have turf fields, which are more equipped when it comes 
to clearing off snow.
Lacrosse Is a Community Game
In small towns, lacrosse is a lot like a family gathering: Everyone involved in 
lacrosse pretty much knows everyone else. And when someone in the lacrosse 
community needs help, the lacrosse family pulls together and provides it.
Plus, you can relate easily to the players because they’re as likely as not to 
live right next door. For example, MLL and NLL players often work in your 
community as teachers, police officers, stockbrokers . . . you name it. And 
they make themselves available to the fans before and after games.

292
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Lacrosse Welcomes New Players
The lacrosse community is always willing to rally around newcomers, espe-
cially when it comes to helping them become involved in the sport. Want to 
know where to buy a good lacrosse stick? Lacrosse people will point you in 
the right direction. Want to know how to work on your faceoff technique? 
Lacrosse people will give you direction and advice on what to do.
Lacrosse Breeds Respect
The true lacrosse player and fan holds the game in high regard. And this 
respect transfers to the players on the field or floor. Players respect each 
other because they know how tough you have to be to play this great game. 
No lacrosse fan is ever surprised to see players who are bruised up, bleed-
ing, exhausted, sore, and fatigued from the game, still take the time to shake 
hands with their opponents after the game. Grudges never last long after a 
lacrosse game — maybe because, if a player hits you hard, you know you’ll 
have a chance to return the favor in the next game.
Lacrosse Creates Atmosphere
College or pro players can often be seen running around after the game, 
waving and greeting the fans. They’re also very accommodating in signing 
autographs. The players’ accessibility at the higher levels of the game is just 
one of the many things that makes for an excellent atmosphere.
So, too, does the camaraderie among fans. Did something just happen in the 
game that you don’t quite understand? No problem. If the person next to you 
in the stands can’t help out with an explanation, just ask anyone else within 
earshot. Even total strangers are like longtime friends when they’re watching 
a lacrosse game.

Ten Interesting Facts 
about Lacrosse

▶ Finding out about the history and growth of lacrosse
▶ Identifying famous folks involved in the game
▶ Focusing on some of the sport’s other intricacies
L
acrosse is a fun game to play! It has lots of high-paced action, scoring, 
and exciting plays. Lacrosse is also a fun game to learn about. All sorts 
of fascinating facts surround the game’s history and its growth. In this chap-
ter, we take a look at some of them.
Lacrosse Is the Oldest Team 
Sport in North America
Lacrosse has a proud history filled with fascinating facts. For starters, the 
name lacrosse itself came from French-Canadians who started playing the 
game in the 1800s and thought the stick resembled the crosse of a bishop’s 
crosier, or la crosse. The sport itself was first played by Native Americans 
as a way to train for battle. It was known as baggataway, or “little brother of 
war.” Many teams numbered in the hundreds and competitions lasted for 
days. Participants often were seriously injured during play; some even died.

“The Father of Lacrosse” Was a Dentist
The first written set of rules for the game was put together in 1867 by the 
Montreal Lacrosse Club’s George Beers, who named the positions and lim-
ited the number of players to — at that time — 12 per side. Beers, who was 
a dentist, is rightfully referred to as the “father of lacrosse.” The rules he put 
in place were quickly employed by the Canada Lacrosse Association, which 
started using a rubber ball and newly designed sticks. The sport as we know 
it today was first played in the United States in the mid-1870s, shortly after it 
was introduced in the United Kingdom.
The First Women to Play 
Lacrosse Were Scottish
Women’s lacrosse was born in the spring of 1890 when the first game was 
played at a girls prep school in St. Leonard’s, Scotland. In September 1884, 
the school’s headmistress, Louisa Lumsden, traveled to Canada where she 
witnessed a game between the Montreal Lacrosse Club and the Canghuwaya 
Indians, who were led by their chief, “White Eagle.” Impressed by the beauty 
and grace of the game, she decided to introduce it at St. Leonard’s.
The first girls game in the United States was played in 1926 in Baltimore, 
Maryland, at the Bryn Mawr School.
New York University Fielded the 
First College Lacrosse Team
Collegiate play began in the United States in 1877 when New York University 
fielded the first men’s team. Harvard and Columbia soon had squads of their 
own. Within a couple of years, Princeton and Yale also launched lacrosse 
teams. Harvard and Princeton were the most successful teams during the 
early years of collegiate lacrosse. But the sport experienced growing pains. 
Despite its success, Princeton dropped the sport because of conflicts with 
the use of its fields with other sports, but it reinstated the sport in 1921.

295
 Chapter 21: Ten Interesting Facts about Lacrosse
Lacrosse Made Its Olympic 
Debut in 1904
Lacrosse made its Olympic debut at the 1904 games in St. Louis. It was played 
again in 1908 in London. Canada won the gold medals both times, and every 
team medaled, because only three nations — including the United States and 
England — fielded teams.
Since then lacrosse has been either a demonstration or exhibition sport four 
times — in 1928, 1932, 1948, and 1984.
Body Contact Wasn’t Allowed in 
Men’s Lacrosse until the 1930s
Neither men’s nor women’s teams playing lacrosse in the United States used 
protective equipment when the sport was first introduced. But that all changed 
in the mid-1930s when men’s rules were changed to allow body contact.
The Mann Cup Was Originally Awarded 
to Field Lacrosse Teams
Box lacrosse joined the fray around 1932 as an activity that could be played at 
hockey arenas when they weren’t in use. The six-man game quickly caught on 
and, by the end of the decade, the Mann Cup, which was first awarded in 1910 
to Canada’s top amateur field team, had been transferred over to box. Though 
field lacrosse is still played in Canada, box lacrosse is far more popular.
Lacrosse Didn’t Go Pro until the 1980s
Professional lacrosse debuted in the mid-1980s when the six-team Major 
Indoor Lacrosse League (MILL) began playing box lacrosse in 1987, after 
evolving from the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League, which began a year earlier. 
The MILL merged into the National Lacrosse League in 1998. The professional 
outdoor game, Major League Lacrosse, launched in 2001.

A Super Bowl Coach Has 
Roots in Lacrosse
Bill Belichick, who has (as of this writing) coached the New England Patriots 
to three Super Bowl victories, played lacrosse throughout his youth, 
including stops at Annapolis High School in Maryland; Phillips Academy 
in Andover, Massachusetts; and Wesleyan University in Middletown, 
Connecticut.
Belichick, a regular at NCAA lacrosse final fours, was actively involved 
in bringing the 2008 and 2009 men’s championships to Gillette Stadium 
in Foxborough, Massachusetts. He also coached the sport to three of his 
children, including son Stephen, who is, as of this writing, a defenseman at 
Rutgers University in New Jersey.
Lacrosse Is a Hit in Movies and on TV
Lacrosse has been featured in several popular major motion pictures, includ-
ing the 1999 box-office smash hit teen comedy, American Pie.
The sport is also featured prominently in the new version of the popular TV 
show 90210, about teenagers growing up in Beverly Hills, California.
Actor Robby Benson received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor for 
his 1975 portrayal of 17-year-old prep-school lacrosse player Johnny Gunther, 
who died of a brain tumor in a made-for-television adaptation of the book 
Death Be Not Proud, by Gunther’s father, John.

down and follows through straight ahead.
over-the-shoulder pass or shot: See behind-the-back pass or shot.

utes in box lacrosse.
penalty area: Where the penalized player sits for the duration of a penalty.

 Glossary
plunger: A faceoff method in which the back of the head goes over the ball. 
The player then lifts his backhand while putting pressure on the front hand, 
pinching the ball with the head to allow him to control the ball and pull it 
around his opponent, often leading to a fast break.
pocket: The mesh area inside the frame of the lacrosse stick head. The 
pocket should be about the depth of a lacrosse ball.
pointman: The offensive player who plays either on the strong side or at the 
top and in the middle of the offense in box lacrosse.
poke check: A checking technique in which the defender tries to get his stick 
in between the opponent’s stick and his body to pry the ball loose or at least 
make him take a hand off the stick so that he isn’t a threat to score. Also 
called a can opener.
power play: In box lacrosse, when a team has more players on the floor than 
the opposition has, because of a penalty against the opposing team.
push: When a player pushes the stick head forward as the top sidewall is 
facing toward him so that the ball moves forward, behind the opposing 
faceoff player so it can be scooped up by either the player or a wingman, 
often leading to a fast break.
quick stick: A quick pass or shot in which the player doesn’t hesitate after 
the catch — the ball is in and out of the pocket.
rake: A faceoff method in which the player sweeps his stick like a rake to get 
the ball to one of his wing players.
restraining lines: In field lacrosse, the two lines, 35 yards from each end line, 
that separate the field into thirds. In box lacrosse, they’re the lines that run 
across the width of the floor on either side of the center circle. These lines 
determine one end of the offensive and defensive zones.
ride: A play that aims to prevent the team with the ball from advancing it 
from its defensive end to the offensive zone.
rip: An informal term for a shot on goal, usually one that’s hard and accurate.
screen: An offensive tactic in which a player blocks his defender from switch-
ing to defend the stick handler.

304
Lacrosse For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
set play: An offensive strategy that usually involves a series of predetermined 
moves in which each player has an assigned task.
shin guards: Leg guards to protect the goalie’s legs and used for stopping 
shots.
shooting strings: The strings stretched from the two widest parts of the 
head. Most sticks have between one and four shooting strings, and most are 
either nylon or hockey laces — or a combination of the two. They’re used to 
create a smoother release of the ball from the pocket.
sidearm pass or shot: A type of pass or shot in which the arm and stick 
movement is parallel to the field.
sideline: The two lines that run along either side of the field or floor and 
mark its limits.
slashing: A form of defense to stop or dislodge the ball that is more prevalent 
in the game today because of the use of the plastic stick.
slashing penalty: This penalty occurs when a player gets carried away with 
violent hitting of the stick on another player.
slide: When a defenseman leaves the man he is guarding to guard another 
player.
slough: A defensive strategy in which defenders play off their man to move 
further toward the goal area.
specialty teams: A group of players used in specific situations, such as man-
down, man-up, and faceoff.
sphere: In women’s lacrosse, no stick checks in the direction of the head are 
allowed to break this 7-inch area that surrounds the attacking player’s head.
split dodge: This offensive move in field lacrosse involves running at a 
defender and switching the stick from one hand to the other and running by.
stall: A strategy in which the offensive team runs time off the clock by pass-
ing the ball frequently and not shooting on goal.
stick check: When a player tries to check his opponent’s stick with his own 
stick to try to dislodge the ball.
stick fake: When the stick handler fakes a pass or shot to get a reaction out 
of the defender and to try to beat him.

305
 Glossary
switch: When two defenders exchange opponents. A pick is set and the 
defender on the stick handler gets blocked out of the play, so the back 
defender calls “switch,” and the two defenders exchange opponents.
Tewaaraton Award: The national College Player of the Year for men’s and 
women’s lacrosse earns this honor.
3-second rule: The women’s lacrosse rule in which defenders may not stay in 
the arc for more than 3 seconds without guarding an offensive player.
30-second rule: The box lacrosse offensive team must take a shot on net 
within 30 seconds or lose possession of the ball.
30-second shot clock: A clock that counts down the 30 seconds allotted to a 
box lacrosse offense to attempt a shot. With the exception of the 60-second 
clock in Major League Lacrosse, the outdoor professional league, field 
lacrosse has no shot clock.
transition: The change a team undergoes when it switches from defense to 
offense or vice versa.
trip: When a player uses his leg to cause an opponent to fall.
turnover: When a team loses possession of the ball without taking a shot, such 
as off a bad pass, when checked off the ball, or when committing a violation.
two-point goal: In Major League Lacrosse, the play in which a team is 
awarded two points for a successful shot from 16 yards or more out.
underhand pass or shot: A type of pass or shot in which the arm and stick 
movement comes from near the field or floor.
unsettled: Situations that occur after a team gains possession after a faceoff 
or turnover and often has a transition opportunity.
violation: An action that causes a team to lose possession of the ball.
warding off: An act of pushing off the defender with the arm when a player 
has possession of the ball. If it’s called, the stick handler loses possession.
wings: The two lines parallel to the sidelines where one player from each 
team stands during faceoffs. They are 20 yards from the faceoff X.
wrap check: This is used when the defender has to go around the player’s 
body to get to his stick.

306
Lacrosse For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
zone defense: In a zone defense, defenders are stationed to defend against 
an area of the field rather than one specific player, as they do in man-to-man. 
Lacrosse features two common zone defenses: 2-1-2 and 1-2-2. Teams play 
zone to change the pace of the game, to hide a weaker defensive player, or to 
enable players to be in position to break away on a shot.
zone offense: An offense that’s run when the opposition is playing a zone 
defense.
