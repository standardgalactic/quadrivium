Acknowledgments
This book would not exist without the instigation, support, time, and interest of many 
individuals. First, we’d like to thank Bob Elliott for planting the seed to write the book. 
His interest in the topic encouraged us to pursue and sign our book contract to begin 
the work. Bob graciously handed us over to Tom Dinse, who has been instrumental in 
coordinating and guiding us through the process. 
Thanks to Dave Depew for introducing us to two of our technical editors, Bob Bannon 
and Brandon Farr. Dave provided us with his most impressive industry and academic 
colleagues to closely review, challenge, and help us to structure the book contents. To 
that end, a special thanks to our technical editors—Bob, Brandon and Richard Perez—
for their detailed reviews, comments, and questions. Collectively, they opened us up to 
redefine and refine our visual solutions. We appreciate the extra time our editors each 
took to reflect on the solutions we presented. 
There are a number of others who have closely reviewed a few chapters in the book: For 
those, we thank Jacque Murphy, Catherine Musinsky, Matt Hull, and Michael Ledeoux, 
who provided spot-on feedback. Their words are embedded in the chapters they reviewed.
We also thank those that we interviewed to shape the book contents to begin with. We 
cannot thank each by name because we promised anonymity, but we can thank each 
by role. The perspective of portfolio managers, investment analysts, and controllers has 
proven invaluable as we discussed typical data displays, current challenges, and our 
visualization solutions. We could not have written this book without their perspectives 
as practitioners in the field. 
We have immense gratitude for our families for giving us the time to write the book. 
Their patience and support through the months has been touching. Natalia Rodri-
guez’s interest in knowing how close we were to finishing made our constant response 
of “almost done” increasingly comical. Surprise breakfasts, snacks, sandwiches, and 
encouraging notes from Isabela Rodriguez helped to keep our spirits and energy up. 
Alejandro (Julie’s husband) has been her life support providing a balance of quiet time 
to work and fun distractions when she needed to take a break.

Foreword
As the volume and complexity of the world’s data increases, so too does our requirement 
to find meaning and insight in the information we amass. For businesses, simply col-
lecting and storing data is of little use. The real power lies in unlocking more informed 
decision-making that can drive substantial user impact, revenue growth, and process 
innovation.
Much of the traditional business effort around data has been focused on how best to 
aggregate and organize an enterprise’s unstructured information into data sets for 
analysis. This has proven to be a massive exercise in both scale and futility. As data sets 
continue to grow from the proliferation of new information sources, they are simultane-
ously stretching and testing the boundaries of our legacy modes of analysis and making 
it challenging for financial services professionals to uncover relevant business insights.
Data visualization seeks to remove this complexity by presenting information in con-
sumable, graphical ways. Good visual communications do much more than simply 
replace words and numbers with imagery—they reveal data patterns, themes, and 
changes at a quick glance to help individuals make informed decisions effectively and 
efficiently. In time, it is likely that machine learning and artificial intelligence will fur-
ther intervene to unlock even greater insights from our visual communications.
In this book, two of Sapient Global Markets’ creative directors known for running 
highly successful engagements with our largest clients, Julie Rodriguez and Piotr 
­Kaczmarek, explore the power inherent in improving the visualization of financial data.

age their designs to make your displays more insightful.

Introduction
Financial data presentations are often riddled with incomplete, misleading, excessive, 
or raw data, compromising their ability to tell a full story and leading to inaccurate 
conclusions. As an industry, we need to improve our ability to see major issues, dis-
cover hidden details, make connections, and compare top investment ideas. Given 
ever increasing amounts of data, we need to work ever more diligently to ensure our 
decisions are based on a clear understanding of the data. This requires that we first 
undertake a close examination of the data, then explore data visualization solutions, 
making incremental refinements and continual critical assessments along the way. The 
chapters in this book provide a variety of data visualizations designed to improve your 
understanding of data and your ability to convey that understanding to your audience.
Our Approach
This book provides visualization methods that will help you navigate today’s cluttered 
landscape of financial markets. It starts with a review of current, commonly used meth-
ods for communicating financial data and then offers methods to refine or enhance 
them, or create new types of visualizations that are easy to use, elegant, and that facilitate 
better decision-making. Many break with today’s common practices for communicating 
data, but improve efficiency and clarity.
Core chapters (Chapters 3–10) examine current typical approaches to communicat-
ing data and contrast those against our revised visualization methods. These chapters 
  xvii

xviii    ﻿Introduction
provide industry examples organized by common portfolio management activi-
ties and by typical financial statements for pension funds, mutual funds, and 
hedge funds. We analyze existing, representative data sets, and keeping in mind 
their intended purpose, we propose alternative visualizations to improve their 
clarity and drive home the most important information they contain.
As information designers, we combine analytics and cognitive aesthetics to 
create data visualizations. We start by interviewing practitioners in the field to 
understand their goals; next we evaluate and interrogate the data itself for the 
various questions it might answer. Finally we craft design concepts that will 
reveal these answers most effectively. Our work is constantly evolving as we 
invent better ways to communicate data. The visualizations we present inform, 
inspire, and aspire to light the way to intelligent decision-making. 
Intended Audience
This book is designed for those who work within financial services, especially 
within investment management firms such as foundations, endowments, estate 
and wealth management companies, pensions, hedge funds, mutual funds, reg-
istered investment advisories, 401k plan sponsors, third-party providers, banks, 
or at brokerages, in addition to those responsible for disclosing the financial 
status of a for-profit or non-profit firm. 
Investment managers who actively manage investments, research analysts, and 
associates who provide insights and information to those that make investment 
decisions will find this a valuable resource when it comes to transforming data 
into active management decisions. Marketing analysts who provide sales and 
presentation materials and accounting and financial analysts will find visualiza-
tion solutions to showcase their data. 
Systems analysts, business analysts, and user experience designers who design, 
implement, and support systems for investment management firms can find 
security, portfolio, trade, performance, and risk management solutions they can 
adapt to their own uses. Some firms have business intelligence analysts tasked 

Introduction    xix
with creating specific reports to reflect departmental or firmwide conditions. 
These BI analysts may find they can reuse or repurpose many of the data visual-
izations in these pages.
Chapter Structure
This book has four parts and twelve chapters. Part 1 introduces the many uses 
of data visualizations and explains their many levels of importance. Part 2 pro-
vides data visualization solutions for active investing decisions across different 
phases of managing a portfolio.  Part 3 provides ideas for how best to present 
data for accounting, marketing, sales, and communications needs. Finally, 
Part 4 enumerates key principles and provides some next steps for implement-
ing visualizations.
Firms need to monitor, report, and identify needs on the basis of financial data. 
To monitor status, to answer the question, How are we doing? they need to 
consult a myriad of accounting, performance, risk, market, and transactional 
data. Reporting requires regulatory compliance. Various regulatory demands 
push standards and create rules for greater transparency. Well-documented 
audit trails allow firms to track accountability and answer the question, Are we 
compliant? Good decisions require clear understanding of status and strategies. 
Dots must connect in order to know What should we do differently? or How 
should we adjust in order to succeed? More than 250 charts and graphs in this 
book help furnish such questions with the tools to find clear and actionable 
solutions. From start to finish, we identify needs and design visualizations that 
reflect those needs. What follows is a short synopsis of what to expect from 
each chapter.
Part 1: Information Gains Through Data Visualizations
In his book Exploratory Data Analysis (Pearson, 1977), renowned mathemati-
cian John Tukey wrote, “The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to 
notice what we never expected to see.” In that book he encouraged translating 
text and numbers into visual methods like charts to explore data sets with the 

xx    Introduction
goal of reaching a more complete understanding of the data. The chapters in 
Part 1 introduce the uses of data visualizations and the value they provide.
Chapter 1: Paving a Path Toward Visual Communications
Today, we are challenged by both the size and complexity of data. Advance-
ments in technology enable us to access, store, and share more data than ever, 
but have also created higher standards for onscreen displays. We expect screen 
presentations to be increasingly immediate, simple, and telling, not to mention 
aesthetically pleasing. This chapter aims to answer, How should we best repre-
sent the data? 
Chapter 2: Benefits of Using Visual Methods
Why do we use charts and graphs? What are their benefits? How should we take 
advantage of these methods? If you know what something is good for, then you’ll 
know how to apply it. Part of the puzzle is to allow the connection between data 
and charts and maximize the utility of both. This chapter reviews the various 
benefits of data visualizations to make better use of the chart and graphing 
ideas that follow.
Part 2: Transforming Data for Active  
Investment Decisions
Part 2 focuses on the art of investment management as it applies to the man-
agement of separate client accounts, either individual or institutional. Invest-
ment Managers tend to make all the investment decisions for a client’s separate 
portfolio across multiple asset classes. You can find individuals in these roles 
at foundations, endowments, family offices, wealth management companies, 
registered investment advisories, or at brokerages. Because the investment 
approach, style, and process will vary from firm to firm or even individual 
to individual, we do not focus on process. Rather we showcase visualization 
techniques based on common investment activities used in the industry. The 
investment activities within Part 2 are organized by the major investment 
management phases. Each chapter provides visualizations for each phase of 

Introduction    xxi
the Investment Process: Security Assessment, Portfolio Construction, Trading, 
and Performance Measurement.  
At every phase of the Investment Process, members of the Investment Manage-
ment firm are seeking to “add value” for the client. This term can have many 
different meanings. The client might define adding value as outperforming a 
benchmark, outperforming other peer Investment Management firms in the 
industry, or simply striving to achieve positive investment results most of the 
time (outperforming “zero” or a benchmark of cash, as it is often called). 
The most important goal of the Investment Process is to gain value over some 
alternative. The most important function of our visualizations, therefore, is 
to help the Investment Management staff either find ways to add value to the 
Investment Process or to communicate to clients their level of success in that 
pursuit. 
Chapter 3: Security Assessment
Each investment option has its own set of characteristics to watch and track: 
This may include the short-term growth of a stock, or the stability of a bond to 
pay coupons, the longer-term returns of a mutual fund, or the diversification 
of an ETF. Despite, or because of, these variations, each investment option 
presents data points that make it harder to review. Data inconsistency presents 
a difficult comparison problem: How do we normalize this data? How do we 
ensure we are not missing out on the relative characteristics for each vehicle? In 
this chapter we introduce how to review a mix of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, 
and ETFs, and how to present a rich view of each while keeping them within a 
consistent framework. 
Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
During the Portfolio Construction phase of an Investment, investment profes-
sionals confer to create a portfolio best suited to the client by looking at data 
views designed for evaluation and reaction to change. This key chapter covers 
asset allocation, sector analysis, and risk management and monitoring. It pro-
vides visualizations that can be tailored to unique decision-making rationales.

xxii    Introduction
Chapter 5: Trading
In this chapter, we rethink how to use the data in tickers, quotes, and watchlists 
to provide you with better up-to-the-minute information on the current state of 
a security or index. This chapter explains how to create, use, and reuse a visual 
system to reduce the time required to learn new, additional visual markers. We 
provide visualizations to not only increase awareness of the data but also to 
improve the elegance and efficiency of the display. 
Chapter 6: Performance Measurement 
Market fluctuations impart volatility to the values of the instruments held in a 
portfolio. Tracking and analyzing the overall performance of the portfolio—in 
absolute terms and also relative to the fluctuations of the broader markets—is 
an important part of the Investment Process. Lessons can be learned by mem-
bers of the investment firm from a thorough analysis of market and portfolio 
performance, and through a feedback loop, those lessons can be used for 
improvement. This chapter discusses performance at the market, firm, and 
portfolio level and reviews both risk and return attribution.
Part 3: Showcasing Data for Effective Communications
Effective visual communications can improve your sales, marketing, and client 
presentations to help you connect more clearly with your audience. Part 3 walks 
through key chart designs for non-profit and for-profit organizations’ annual 
reports to showcase demographic, tributary, and funding ratio data for a pen-
sion fund. New visual techniques demonstrate how to display fund factsheet 
data and how to analyze the top 100 hedge funds.
Chapter 7: Financial Statements
Financial accounting is a large topic encompassing many different types of 
financial statements. This chapter reviews a few standard financial statements 
required of all public firms and which analysts are required to compile, review, 
and report, such as the Statement of Cash Flows, Statement of Financial Activity, 
and Operating Budget. These statements report fundamental data points that 

Introduction    xxiii
are not typically visualized. We suggest visualizations that observe standard 
accounting practices while making the data more transparent with supporting 
details. 
Chapter 8: Pension Funds 
This chapter focuses on one of the largest pension funds in the world and 
reviews how its annual report documents its status. We hone in on three main 
areas, including 1) demographics of plan members and their profiles, 2) contri-
butions versus benefits, and 3) fund position as revealed by the funding ratio. 
This chapter transforms table data, then combines them into both individual 
and consolidated charts.
Chapter 9: Mutual Funds 
Following fund profile, allocations, performance, and fees are key aspects of 
reviewing and marketing a mutual fund. In this chapter, we design some com-
monly displayed charts that represent these key components and incorporate 
the charts into a revised fund factsheet. The chapter ends with a few concise 
methods for comparing a list of mutual funds. 
Chapter 10: Hedge Funds 
This chapter uses pattern recognition and interactive displays to present tempo-
ral data of the top 100 performing hedge funds. We examine two important sets 
of hedge fund data: individual funds and overall industry analyses. We compare 
both hedge fund strategies and the funds within a strategy to analyze a firm’s 
growth in AUM. 
Part 4: Next Steps
To continue with the visualization ideas presented in this book, you need a 
way to implement and weave visualizations into your day-to-day analyses and 
communications. The chapters in this section provide some design principles to 
keep in mind, as well as a framework to help you decide your next steps.

xxiv    Introduction
Chapter 11: Data Visualization Principles
Chapter 11 raises key questions about the visualizations presented in the book. 
How can visualizations be introduced to create a concise understanding of data? 
How do we ensure that those visualizations are shown within a relative perspec-
tive to provide greater context? How do we reveal underlying issues and remove 
the risk of masking critical information? Or, vice versa, how can we pull ourselves 
away from the details to see and understand the big picture? We discovered 
three overarching principles that apply to all of our visualization methods. This 
chapter provides a detailed definition about each guiding principle and illus-
trates each one’s practical applications.  
Chapter 12: Implementing the Visuals
The technologies used to create data visualizations constantly evolve, as do 
recommendations for their implementation. This chapter suggests a framework 
for deciding how to design appropriate visualizations, and closes the book with 
a list of criteria for next steps in visualizations. We provide a set of criteria for 
refining and narrowing your choices based on your immediate needs.
How To Read This Book
There is an intentional flow to this book in which Part 1 introduces the need 
and value for data visualizations, Parts 2 and 3 show current data visualization 
examples, and Part 4 provides lessons learned and next steps to implement. 
Although core chapters (Chapters 3–10) within Parts 2 and 3 can be read in any 
order, we do recommend that you read Parts 2 and 3 before Part 4, and that you 
read each chapter in a linear fashion.
Reading the book in sequential order will provide an easier learning experience 
when it comes to understanding references from prior chapters. In particular, 
Chapter 11, “Data Visualization Principles,” refers to visualizations from core 
Chapters 3–10 to show how a design principle is applied in practice. Reading the 
core chapters first prepares you to better understand the principles and points 

Introduction    xxv
within Chapter 11. Chapter 12, “Implementing the Visuals,” similarly references 
visualization examples from prior chapters but does not require you to be as 
familiar with them.
Disclosures
Disclosure 1: Selected Examples Are Based on Variety
There are countless data sets and their visualizations we could have selected as 
examples on which to base our work. Ultimately, we narrowed down the candi-
dates to ones that provide variation and frequent use, and that typically result 
in efficiency, transparency, or usability issues that could use some alternative 
solutions. We wanted to represent various aspects of financial services, from 
the active investment phases of security assessment, portfolio construction, 
trading, and performance measurements, to marketing and communications, to 
compliance and reporting requirements. 
Our choice of a starting example does not reflect any endorsement or opinion 
about the investment process. The industry has debated many investment pro-
cesses, has standardized some, and has made others proprietary. Our starting 
example simply represents our search for the most familiar and representative 
data sets of the industry.
Disclosure 2: Visualization Solutions Are Not Firm-Specific
Creating proprietary software solutions often means customizing each solution 
for specific firm or client needs. In fact, most of what we do in our line of work 
is firm/client-specific and tailored. This book is not. The scenarios explored are 
commonly seen and our solutions are therefore neither proprietary nor based 
upon individual firm or client opinions or directions. Instead, we suggest unique 
solutions based on our explorations of the data sets, interviews with financial 
managers, and critiques from our technical editors. 

xxvi    Introduction
Disclosure 3: Visualization Solutions Are Reusable
Consider our data visualizations as flexible and reusable. Although we have 
organized the chapters by investment management phases and subjects, you 
may find that many of the visualizations they contain can be applied to other 
situations. Visuals can be mixed, matched, and reused to solve problems you 
encounter in your own work. As you read through the book, view our examples 
as design patterns that can be customized to fit your own needs. 
Disclosure 4: Data Reflects a Representative Sample Set
Unless otherwise noted, the source data sets are not specific to a firm or organi-
zation. Each firm’s data set will vary in the size of the individual value amounts 
and ranges, number of values in each list, and detail data types. The data visu-
alizations are based largely upon representative sample data, with a focus on 
transforming similar data ranges into visual communications. Your redesign of 
data visualizations may likely need to adjust to accommodate your data.
Disclosure 5: All Visualizations Can Be Designed  
for Interactions
Although some of the visualizations are based on printed publications or static 
reports, all the ideas can be applied to interactive displays. Interactive digital 
displays of the data sets can provide the flexibility your audience needs and 
enable them to get more answers from the data. A few chapters are entirely 
designed for interactive displays (Chapters 3 and 5) and the information they 
provide relates directly to screen use. 
Disclosure 6: Visualization Solutions Are Technology-
Agnostic
We decided to write this book to share our ideas with a larger audience. We 
offer ideas that focus on providing business value unconstrained by specific 
client needs or target technologies. With implementation technology require-
ments aside, we put aside interaction design details as well. The ideas we present 

Introduction    xxvii
are strictly conceptual and can be recombined with other ideas, integrated into 
an existing solution, and tailored to a firm’s specific needs. They make no pre-
sumptions about implementation and so address the largest possible audience. 
Each solution can be tailored on a case-by-case basis using the technology of 
your choosing. 
Disclosure 7: Visualization Solutions Represent  
New Innovations
This book provides innovative methods for visualizing data. In many regards, 
traditional methods no longer work. The data to which we have access tends to 
be more varied and complex than before, and so we need to update our visual-
ization methods. This book will expand your vocabulary of data visualization 
solutions to accommodate a whole new universe of how to display and interact 
with data. 
We hope this collection of visualizations help you to select and implement solu-
tions that best address your needs. Because some of the visualizations are new 
to your audience, you may need to explain how to read them. The more a new 
chart is used, the more familiar it will become. As the charts become familiar, 
your audience will require fewer explanations. 
Supplemental Information
So you can reuse and apply the examples in the book, we have provided access 
to the materials online. Digital assets for both data and visuals are housed on 
the companion website: http://www.wiley.com/go/visualizingfinancialdata, where 
you can download all the sample data sets and visualization solutions we pres-
ent. You can review sample data sets, compare them to your own, and with a 
gap analysis, decide how to work with variations in ranges or additional data 
points. Vector based pdfs’ layout, scale, hierarchy, color, and font treatment can 
all be customized to your own needs. In addition, these files give you the flex-
ibility to scale to the size you need and adjust as required. 

xxviii    Introduction
The online materials are small starter kits that can help you put together a 
presentation, new report, project proposal, or even proof of concept prototype 
to demo. Over time you can use the supplemental information to try out new 
ideas, quickly share and gain consensus, and decide how to incorporate and 
proceed. Use the starter kits to articulate a vision you may have for changing a 
current communication strategy with a concrete example.

Paving a Path Toward  
Visual Communications
1
Visual communications can alleviate problems related to your complex data deluge, 
extract key points from your data, and help you create a visual narrative. The sequence 
of events, influencing factors, and unknown truths are examples of individual data 
stories that can become clearer with visual communications. Visualizations tell stories 
with charts to address a variety of needs starting with your own needs to evaluate data, 
communicate to peers, convince the board, present to clients, or report regulatory com-
pliance. This chapter evaluates the current data state and presents a paved path toward 
a future with hardware and software advancements that you can use to create your own 
visual narrative. 
Over the years we (a design research team) have partnered to create improved data 
displays that solve information challenges for our clients. In 2010, for instance, we 
worked on a risk platform—a proprietary technology software solution—for one of the 
world’s largest bank holding companies. The platform, focused on structured products, 
was geared to provide research analysts with standard risk scenarios for fixed income 
securities. 
The most informative feedback we received about the platform came from an analyst 
named Dave (not his real name), whose job it was to sort through the data to identify 
﻿    3

the major themes and highlights and publish weekly market perspectives 
for the firm. As part of his work, Dave reviewed information on market data 
rates, detail holdings, historical prepays, current prepayment models, rates of 
return, and color commentary across a set of securities. In addition, he read 
12 daily news feeds, including them in his reports as needed. His reports were 
used all across the organization to make key decisions about fixed-income 
securities. In other words, his work was company-critical information.
As such, Dave needed to be in a position to access and analyze enormous 
amounts of data and distill it into a few key points to tell a clear story. In our 
conversation with Dave, he said that to maintain his position as a thought 
leader, he needed to remain “in constant discovery mode….” The value he pro-
vided lay in his ability to separate the signals from the noise and offer relevant 
insights. To deliver on that, Dave needed to improve his data displays. With 
that in mind he revealed that his main complaint was needing even more data 
display space despite using four separate computer screens, and he often found 
himself scrolling across vast spreadsheets to access that data. Here is what Dave 
told us he needed:
▸
▸He wanted to review Bloomberg market data on Treasuries, Swaps, 
LIBOR, and other indexes to compare them against portfolios by placing 
the two data sets side by side on one screen. 
▸
▸He wanted to analyze multiple securities at one time, and he wanted 
to see a portfolio summary view within the context of other related 
portfolios. 
▸
▸He wanted this text- and numbers-based information in a more graphi-
cal form to help him better interpret the data. 
Having worked as a research analyst for 15 years, Dave knew what he needed 
from his data displays, and it had everything to do with improving his digital 
experience. During our interview he even held up his smartphone, pointing 
to its tiny screen and then back to the four large monitors. According to Dave, 
despite their limited screen size, the apps were more efficient than the monitors. 
4    Chapter 1: Paving a Path Toward Visual Communications 

Information Delivery Needs
Dave is far from alone in wanting and needing a paved path toward better visual 
communication. The proliferation of apps on phones and tablets has created 
a new generation of users with higher expectations for all their digital experi-
ences. Mobile apps created for play are pushing people to expect more from the 
applications in their work environment. Today’s market demands immediacy, 
simplicity, and aesthetic appeal from mobile and desktop applications. 
Tens of thousands of people just like Dave are out there in the world. Research 
analysts and others in finance and many related fields study complex data sets. 
They deliver weekly reports that are largely qualitative but with quantitative 
supporting details. An ever-expanding universe of data, plus regulatory require-
ments and greater global reach all contribute to the world’s data complexity. 
Bloomberg’s market data, for example, is a huge and complex data source. The 
popular Bloomberg terminals provide data-driven insight into 52,000 compa-
nies, with more than 1,000,000 individuals consuming the 5,000 news stories 
published every day. Each terminal employs more than 30,000 command func-
tions to navigate through the information. Analysts like Dave spend a signifi-
cant portion of their time in Bloomberg.
As shown in Figure 1.1, other data sources, among the thousands that exist, include 
news and economic commentary as well as transactional, fund, portfolio, custo-
dian, and accounting data to be presented within the context of investor client data. 
And the list goes on and on. Data sources continue to increase in type and size.
The number of additional elements that compound the complexity of data is 
astounding: risk and compliance rules set by firms, corporate actions set by the 
market, and investor mandates set as client guidelines for engagement, to name 
just a few.

Industry Demands

For example, firms must configure reports for their clients that meet regulatory

requirements and disclosures set by the Dodd-Frank Act. Varying additional 
jurisdictional boundaries create added requirements to comply with regula-
tions by state bureaus and local foreign regulators. Outside of the United States, 
MiFID II regulates how trillions of euros worth of stocks, bonds, derivatives, 
and commodities are traded, settled, and reported. Influences of globalization 
layer still more factors of complexity into available financial data. 
Likewise, clients from various regions of the world, each with their own lan-
guage, currency, and culture, have differing expectations of how data should 
be presented (see Figure 1.2). They may expect data to be grouped, subgrouped, 
filtered, tallied, and organized into grids, pivot tables, or charts.

Enabling Factors
On the one hand, these factors increase the amount and complexity of the 
data. On the other hand, advancements in technology enable us to handle these 
increasing amounts of data more readily and present them in numerous different 
ways (see Figure 1.3). Improved processing power combined with cheaper data 
storage, faster transfer, and mobility are what make more data readily available. 
The upside is that this increased availability enables us to dig deeper and learn 
more. Technological advancements for gathering, storing, and sharing larger data 
sets increase our capabilities with interactive data visualizations. However, we 
must be careful to create visual communications that are accurate and insightful.

Figure 1.3  Hardware Capabilities
The world’s ability to store digital information has roughly doubled every 
40 months since the 1980s (see the following note). Major improvements in 
graphics cards and high-resolution displays have enabled the software side of 
the industry to create more sophisticated visuals without overburdening the 
computer systems, such as Business Intelligence (BI) and data visualization 
software (see Figure 1.4) now considered standard tools. In addition, we have 
powerful programming languages, open source charting libraries, technical 
computing packages, online visualization tools, and visualization research labs. 

Enabling Factors    9
This statistic comes from an article in Science written by Martin Hilbert and Priscila 
López, “The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute 
Information” (Science 332 (6025): 60–65.doi:10.1126/science.1200970. PMID 21310967).

Figure 1.4  Software Capabilities
We are at a point in which hardware and software can be used to present data, 
but we need to consider how best to represent it. Today, we can spend less time 
gathering and aggregating data and more time visually organizing data accurately. 
Although technology has enabled us to do more with our charting capabilities, 
demands in the marketplace push us to achieve higher standards. Because of 
technology, we can now move far beyond the traditional bar, line, and pie chart to 
create more sophisticated versions or introduce completely new visual concepts. 
As the standard for a sophisticated and accurate digital experience increases, 
the bar for communicating financial data to more diverse audiences is set ever 
higher. Firms often ask us, “What can we do to improve our investment com-
munications?” Soon thereafter, individuals at those firms often come back to us 
and ask, “How do I best present this data to my peers at a meeting I have next 
week? And by the way, the following week, I need to present this data to the 
review board and audit committee.” 
The presentation of data needs to encourage relevant conversations across audi-
ences. Each audience group will require a slightly different set of questions and 
therefore needs a different perspective of the data (see Figure 1.5).

A relationship manager, for example, may want to know which of the portfolios 
she covers are at risk for redemption, whereas senior management would like 
to know the firm-wide view of accounts at risk, trends, and coverage for those 
accounts. From an individual presentation to a firm-wide risk perspective, the 
narrative needs to adjust and tilt to meet the needs of the audiences.
Summary
Dave struggled with the amount of data on his screens as well as the presenta-
tion of the data in his reports. As a result, a well-designed visual narrative was 
missing from the key points Dave presented, and he found it difficult to neatly 
connect each influencing factor back to the supporting data in his reports. His 

12    Chapter 1: Paving a Path Toward Visual Communications 
story, and others like it, has informed our work. Since then, there continues to 
be an increase in data, globalization, rules/regulations, and hardware and soft-
ware capabilities. These increases influence the need and ability to create visual 
explanations of the data. As a result, we have focused our efforts on providing a 
much broader range of visualization solutions. Our analysis of current informa-
tion needs across different audiences has effectively paved a path toward visual 
communications. 
Visually interacting with data can provide multiple perspectives and serve 
multiple audiences. We have moved away from a visual narrative that provides 
a single perspective and shifted toward those that provide many viewpoints 
from the lowest level of details to the highest level of aggregation. We have more 
choices in how we display our data, and it is our job to present the clearest chart 
and most informative graph. We need to optimize how we visualize data to 
maximize our comprehension. In the following chapters we present a number of 
effective and innovative ways to chart complex data, leveraging technology, and 
addressing the needs of a variety of audiences.



Benefits of Using  
Visual Methods
Communicating with data visualizations is not just about being more effective by 
replacing text and numbers. A thoughtfully crafted visualization increases our under-
standing of the data. It reveals patterns, quantities, changes over time, or recurring 
themes at a glance. It makes data so much easier to comprehend that it can elicit “aha” 
moments, instant epiphanies, from your audience. Fellow theoretical physicist John 
Wheeler attributed to Albert Einstein the statement, “If I can’t picture it, I can’t under-
stand it.” Einstein’s quote advocates for the use of visual aids to create understanding. 
He understood the power of a visual and used drawings and charts throughout his note-
books to explain his observations and formulas.
What types of challenges can data visualizations of charts and graphs address? What 
are the inherent qualities of a chart and how can we leverage them? This chapter covers 
these questions as we address the overall benefits of data visualizations.

16    Chapter 2: Benefits of Using Visual Methods 
The Purpose of Charts
You can rely on data visualizations to see outliers, trends, correlations, and 
patterns. First, consider the case of outliers in the data. An exception report 
identifies instances in which some threshold was breached. Let’s say these data 
points or outliers are the focus of interest. Maybe they show errors in a system 
to highlight specific work to be corrected. Maybe you want to assign levels of 
priority to such work on the basis of the number of outliers. But what else could 
you do with the outlier data? You could track associations between the excep-
tions and the data to see if the exceptions are increasing or decreasing. Are they 
above or below your yearly averages? Is there a pattern in the outliers that may 
help identify their root cause? Does their timing correlate to other patterns in the 
data? Do they, for example, map to market volume, season, or something else?
This inquiry leads you to realize that reviewing this one exception report is not 
enough. You need to look at the data from different angles. Every question leads 
to another. 
In the exception report example just mentioned, you started with an unpriori-
tized list of exceptions or outliers. You ranked them by priority for course cor-
rection. You then looked for trends by comparing outliers over time. Finally, you 
looked into correlations in the data to see if associations in the exceptions track 
to time, market volume, or another variable. Patterns in the dataset help you 
to draw conclusions that in turn enable you to effectively predict and prevent 
future errors. 
Data visualizations need to anticipate and address follow-up questions. Under-
standing why you rely on data helps you design visualizations to meet an array 
of questions. Each data visualization has a stated purpose but also goes beyond 
its immediate purpose and serves as an entry point to multiple views. Data visu-
alizations enable you to discover things beyond the reach of their initial inten-
tion. They prime you to compare, connect, and create your own conclusions. 

The Purpose of Charts    17
The images in this chapter are meant to illustrate the purpose of data visualiza-
tions. Because they’re meant to show why data visualizations are used, they do 
not use real-world financial data nor are they examples of the charts and graphs 
in the chapters that follow. The data visualizations in the chapters that follow are 
based on actual financial data in the industry.

Data visualizations distill data. They reduce the effort required to understand 
comparisons, as calculations, and results are represented directly as visual 
content. To compare a table of numbers with 10 rows and 10 columns would 
require you to make roughly 4,950 calculations to understand the relationship 
between the 100 individual data points. Instead a simple comparison can be 
made by scanning the visual representation of this same data set. 
The formula used to arrive at the number of calculations mentioned in the pre-
ceding paragraph is N (N-1)/2, where N = number of data points.
Types of comparisons vary widely. You can compare like values or introduce 
context to provide fresh perspectives of the data. Typically, comparisons reveal 
rank, compare attributes, or show how an event might unfold over time. Con-
sider the following types of comparisons:
▸
▸Rank—Ranking establishes a relationship between a list of items to 
introduce “greater than,” “less than,” or “equal to” analysis. There are 
various ways of showing rank. Percentile rank indicates frequency of 
occurrences and the distribution of data across defined intervals. Both 
ordinal number sequence rankings and percentile rankings are useful for 
comparison. Ranked data enables you to quickly find the top candidates. 
Figure 2.1 is an example of a bar chart listing items in sequential order, 
ranking from the largest to smallest amount.

▸Attributes—An attribute is a characteristic of an object. Analyzing 
attributes is about understanding the various characteristics of an object. 
For example, Figure 2.2 shows three characteristics (A, B, and C) each of 
which can have specific values. It charts 49 objects to visually showcase 
characteristics mapped to the width, height, and size of center circle.

▸
▸Time—Historical or time-based data visualizations reveal how events 
evolve over a period of time and are easily compared with other related 
time-based data sets. The ability to compare and track changes over time 
describes behavior and can reveal a trend. Time series charts, as shown 
in Figure 2.3, typically display the discrete time markers on the x-axis.

Data visualizations that provide comparisons can help you answer questions 
regarding what and when. What is the top performing fund for this year? What 
were the most prevalent attributes of the fund? Have those attributes changed 
over time, if so when?
Establishing Connections
Relationships between data sets enable you to understand connections in 
the data. Is a data set part of a subset? Does one data set impact the results of 
another set and how? A visualization that connects the big picture with cor-
responding details enables you to inspect the data at various levels. Pointillist 
painting is a technique that uses small distinct dots of color and applies those 
dots in patterns to form a coherent picture. Individual dots in a painting are 
like individual data points in a visualization. Similar in effect to Pointillist 
painting, our individual data points, like the distinct dots in the painting, 
have little meaning, but when combined they form a vibrant picture. Your 

20    Chapter 2: Benefits of Using Visual Methods 
eyes make those connections and allow you to see the big picture and still 
inspect each dot or section. Data visualizations can show connections in the 
data by using the techniques of drill down, networks, and correlations.
▸
▸Drill down—Drill down visualizations enable you to look into the 
details without compromising the larger big picture view. Seeing the 
details in context of a larger view provides an enhanced perspective. 
Figure 2.4 provides a drill down example and shows the connec-
tions between the L1, L2, and L3 columns. The highlighted blue bar 
in L1 is the aggregate amount of the entire L2 contents, whereas the 
highlighted black bar in L2 is the aggregate amount of the entire L3 
contents.

▸
▸Networks—Networks link individual data points or nodes together. 
Seeing how data points connect to each other can reveal the influence 
or impact of one data point to another. Figure 2.5 shows a network 
in which A and H are linked through G and F in tandem. It shows 
how certain clusters can be directly linked, indirectly linked, or not 
linked at all.

▸
▸Correlations—Correlations between various data sets may reveal rela-
tionships between them that might not otherwise be apparent. Charts 
similar to Figure 2.6 can show how strongly related two data sets are to 
each other. The data sets in charts A and B have the strongest correla-
tions to each other, whereas charts C and D have weak or non-linear 
correlations.

Showing connections can answer questions as to “how and where.” For exam-
ple, drill down visualizations can reveal how an aggregated total is composed 
of underlying line items. Network visualizations can show how an event in 
one part of the world impacts the price of a commodity in another part of the 
world. The effect, influence, and means of linking datasets across locations can 
be shown and explained with networks. The third type of data visualizations 
that show connections are correlations. For example, correlations can explain if 
and how the size of a fund affects performance or if there exists a relationship 
between firm size and beta values. 
Drawing Conclusions 
Data visualizations enable you to draw your own conclusions and help you 
solve complex questions. A well-crafted visual system provides a set of answers 
that facilitate deeper evaluation. You can formulate theories on the basis of 
patterns, themes, and calculations. Visualizations that lead to conclusions can 
provide the mechanisms for you to advance your understanding by confirming 
a conclusion based on a tested hypothesis. For example, a pattern can help you 
to predict outcomes; groups of categories, and subcategories enable you to see 
themes; and complex formulas can be visualized to show you the results of a 
calculation.
▸
▸Pattern recognition—Visualizations that help you detect patterns take a 
step further into predicting outcomes. Discovering patterns enables you 
to see repeatable steps that lead into knowing what might occur next. 
Figure 2.7 shows a hypothetical pattern of activities and time of day with 
a 24-hour chart. A–L lists the activities, and the AM/PM range indicates 
the hour of the day. The chart then shows the pattern of which activities 
are completed based on time. Activities K and L are completed at night, 
whereas A and B are completed in the afternoon.

▸Themes/categories—Analysis that exposes themes in the data provides 
you with the ability to summarize the information and understand the 
important aspects of the data. Categories organically arise and can help 
you detect more themes. Figure 2.8 shows the data organized into four 
column groups that represent four themes. The black, gray, and blue 
represent the sentiment for each cell to buy, sell, or hold a stock. The 
emerging patterns show the grouping of a theme that is predominantly 
black cells, evenly mixed cells, gray cells, and blue cells.

▸
▸Visual calculations—Modeling an algorithm that represents a differen-
tial equation, for example, can require the output to be as complex of an 
answer as the input of the formula. In contrast, visualizing calculations 
can show and explain the results of the calculation. Figure 2.9 shows an 
equation with three variables. Each variable can be displayed within the 
context of the chart and a sample data point can be explicitly listed with 
the exact numeric values. 
x = 1.0
y = 0.71
z = 1.35
Figure 2.9  Visual Calculations Example
The benefit to these types of visuals is that the answer is based on the raw data, 
so we are able to see the results and not just ask why but also begin to under-
stand why. Why do small cap value funds outperform large cap core funds? Why 
did a financial model provide such volatile results? These are a sample of ques-
tions that represent conclusive types of inquires that can help you understand 
why an event occurred.

How to Leverage Charts 
We as humans have evolved robust visual processing skills to interpret our 
environment. Unless blindness has forced us to rely on other senses, we gather 
and process visual information during every waking moment. Consider a simple 
errand to a store across the street. Before you cross the street, you scan for the 
motion of cars to make sure it’s safe. You read the cross-walk signal, avoid the 
pothole in the street, and navigate the crowd. You assess the flow of traffic and 
make sure a car is not turning onto the street. Within seconds you are able to 
cross the street untouched. This is a simple example of our visual data process-
ing skills. Throughout the day we are able to make well-timed decisions based 
on seeing and assessing what is in front of us. Yet we rarely stop to think how 
visual data processing and analysis gets us through the day.
Imagine being limited to gathering information about your surroundings 
via raw numbers and text. Your ability to react and make a next move would 
require vast amounts of time and effort simply to consume the data. Assessing 
such data would require long calculations. Making sure it is safe to cross the 
street would turn seconds of scanning into minutes. The tasks that take you 
a few minutes may take hours and would lead to a higher risk of making the 
wrong choice. This text-and-numbers-based world seems unreasonable. 
The fact is much of our work is spent in this text-and-numbers-based world. 
Spreadsheets of data including but not limited to cash-flow models, balance 
sheets, earnings valuations, investment returns, research notes, and news all 
consume how we navigate our work. We consume textual and numeric informa-
tion, review the data, make our assessments via calculations, and decide on the 
appropriate next steps. However, how we communicate should reflect our visual 
cortex strengths and be designed around our ability to see and comprehend. 
Communications should be optimized knowing the gifts of our extremely 
evolved powers of visual perception. Our eyes have the power of seeing visual 
misalignments; tracking motion, color, texture, depth; and recognizing visual 
patterns. Knowing our strengths and building upon these strengths can help 
us better navigate the world of text and numbers. The more we replace text 
and numbers with visual objects, the more we can set up a system that works 

26    Chapter 2: Benefits of Using Visual Methods 
with our own visual system of seeing. But that is not all; the characteristics of a 
strong visual communication are many:
▸
▸Universal—The meaning of an image can span borders and foreign 
languages. Much like math, images are not just relevant to one society or 
region. As shown in Figure 2.10, a visual communication like a chart or 
graph can be used across the globe to share data. Use charts to commu-
nicate more easily with colleagues and clients in other regions.
Figure 2.10  Locations Across the Globe
▸
▸Immediate—Consumption and comprehension of a chart can be close 
to instantaneous. For example, reviewing a year’s performance of the 
NASDAQ and S&P 500 as a chart (Figure 2.11) is fast and understand-
able. If we contrast this chart with the text-and-numbers-based version, 
it would take a significant amount of time to analyze. The ability to scan 
the chart and understand the data is more easily achieved. Charts can be 
used to save time, easily interpret data, and learn and share the findings 
from the data.

▸
▸Concise—A small visual display can represent large amounts of data. 
Visual methods like small multiples (Tufte, 2001) display a series of 
individual charts with the same scale and axes to consolidate tables of 
numbers into concise images. Figure 2.12 displays small multiples with 
three datasets represented as a blue line, black line, and gray surface area 
within each chart. The collection of four charts shows a total of 12 data 
sets. What would normally require pages and pages of numeric tables can 
be shown in one page. Space efficiency is also introduced as an output of 
concise visuals; you can see more with less. You can use concise charts in 
small displays or when you need to display multiple data sets in one view.

28    Chapter 2: Benefits of Using Visual Methods 
▸
▸Inviting—Visualizations can be aesthetically pleasing and invite the 
reader to review them more closely. Appealing and engaging commu-
nications make the information more likely to be reviewed, used, and 
adopted. The Calendar Chart shown in Figure 2.13 is an example of such 
a chart that can pique your curiosity and encourage you to review the 
chart more closely.  It lists months in chronological order and points out 
3 months in the 2.5 year calendar that shares data results. Use charts to 
attract attention and interest your audience.

▸Memorable—Visuals are easier to remember than text and numbers. 
Known as the Pictorial Superiority Effect, the phenomenon explains that 
an image is more likely to be both recalled and recognized over text and 
numbers. Studies show that humans can remember more than 2,000 
pictures with at least 90% accuracy in recognition tests over a period of 
several days (Standing & Haber, 1970). Use charts to help your audience 
recall the data. Figure 2.14 is an illustration inspired by the children’s 
book The Little Prince. The book starts with a memorable story of a 
drawing. The drawing is of a boa constrictor that has eaten an elephant. 
Chances are that if you are familiar with the book, you will recognize the 
illustration.

▸
▸Revealing—Visualizations can reveal what otherwise may be missed or 
lost in translation. Discovering otherwise unnoticed information can be 
realized with different visualization techniques. Similar to how a photo-
graph reveals the reality of life, charts can reveal the reality of the data. 
Figure 2.15 is an example of a chart that points out A, B, and C cluster 
groups and derives meaning from the arrangement of circles.

▸
▸Reusable and versatile—Visualizations can be reused and have a range 
of media applications. Charts can be reused in video, animation, and 
infographics, and can be designed for print, screens, or large interactive 
displays. You can reuse and adapt chart concepts to target your com-
munication needs and delivery channel possibilities. Both what and how 
you communicate can be designed to meet specific needs. The visual 
communication options (Figure 2.16) to choose from increase with each 
delivery channel. For example, your option to show more or less data is a 
dynamic option in an interactive display.

Data visualizations enables us to turn on the light switch and see what is 
available. They shine light in a way that enables you to reveal data that would 
otherwise stay hidden. Making data visible can provide immediate gratification 
to audiences around the globe. You can represent your data with concise charts 
and evoke an inviting or memorable display. Visualizations can also be versatile 
and adjust to fit different needs. You can leverage these qualities of a visualiza-
tion to make the data work for you. 

Summary    31
Summary
The ability to encode the data into a visual picture is a communication strength 
that enables you to understand, explain, teach, convince, and reach larger audi-
ences. Pictures of data that carefully communicate the information needed by 
your audience are important and provide considerable value to compare, see 
connections, and make conclusions. Charts cross regional boundaries and can 
be used across the globe to quickly and concisely communicate large amounts 
of data. They can pique and keep your interest to draw you in and be remem-
bered. You can learn, make discoveries from charts, and reuse charts across 
different audiences and delivery mechanisms. Data visualizations produce solu-
tions that do much of the work for you regardless of volumes, real-time updates, 
or additional variations. You just need to take advantage of their capabilities.

Security Assessment 3
Assessing securities requires the most granular analysis of all investment processes. The 
approved universe of investment vehicles may differ widely across or even within firms. 
It may include stocks, bonds, commingled funds (for example, mutual funds or hedge 
funds), ETFs, money market instruments, currencies, or derivatives. Regardless of the 
breadth of securities in the approved universe, portfolio managers and analysts inside 
and outside the firm are tasked with assessing them. This chapter proposes visualization 
designs to those who assess securities for comparative and competitive purposes and 
would like to see a standardized view of those securities. 
We introduce a new framework for standardizing the presentation of stocks, bonds, 
mutual funds, and ETFs to make each more easily compared as an investment option. 
A framework can be defined as a supporting structure to an entity, which in this case is 
the investment option. We extend this definition of a framework through a visualiza-
tion approach that supports a range of key data points of each listed security. First we 
introduce and define how that framework is designed; second we apply it to the creation 
of profiles for stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs; and third, we present the resulting 
collection of profiles. Throughout this chapter we show how the framework is con-
structed with blueprints for each security type. 
The visualizations throughout this chapter use representative sample data and 
are not specific to a source. In addition, the visualizations are designed as inter-
active displays that can be configured and navigated by an end user. 
NOTE

36    Chapter 3: Security Assessment
Tile Framework
A standardized framework can be used to describe the profile of a security 
with a series of Tiles. Tiles are small visualizations of key characteristics or 
metrics of an entity within uniform squares that can be combined to identify 
the performance results of a security. Although the Tile Framework produces 
visual similarities between each security type, a different set of characteristics 
and results have to be defined for each security to make it analytically useful. 
This section describes the Tile Framework so that it can be used and defined for 
other securities.
Profile Tiles are the most fundamental. They describe the weights of a security 
within an asset class, market cap, sector, or region. The Profile Tiles shown in 
Figure 3.1 describe and summarize different security types. This figure illustrates 
the framework within a hypothetical security profile of a commingled fund.

Figure 3.1  Profile Tiles
The Profile Tiles serve multiple purposes. They help you understand the 
investment’s diversification and its conservative versus aggressive aspects. 
At the aggregate level, the profiles show you individual characteristics of a 
security (asset class, market cap, sector, and region), as well as corresponding

results (performance, value/growth, risk, and ratings). The Characteristics Tile 
describes inputs used in creating the investment, while the Results Tile shows 
their outcomes. Asset allocations determine the degree of the risk—high or 
low. Based on the sector weights, performance levels are revealed to be above or 
below the category average.
Color bars provide a system of levels. Horizontal bars show percentage levels 
across sectors, and vertical bars rank levels of attributes such as risk and ratings. 
This two-pronged approach to the Tiles visually documents intrinsic qualities 
of the investment and invites you to drill deeper into the details. It encourages 
you to ask what lies behind each block of color. Figure 3.2 illustrates how the 
Characteristics Tile is composed.

Figure 3.2  Characteristics Framework
To reveal the specific values that make up each Tile, additional views drill down 
into each band and show underlying details by redistributing the data into more 
refined categories (Figure 3.2). To create an understandable visual profile, the 
building blocks of the Characteristics Tile are arranged and colored consis-
tently. The color sequence starts with more conservative traits shown in darker 
blue on the left or top and continues to more aggressive traits represented as 
light blue on the right or bottom. In this way, assessing color value of the whole 
Tile reveals if the represented security is more conservative or aggressive.
In contrast to the Characteristics Tile, the Results Tile (see Figure 3.3) aggre-
gates values that you can influence.

The Results Framework (Figure 3.3) acts as a funnel that captures values into an 
aggregated ranked level. A collection of values for each attribute travel through 
the first and second custom weighting scheme to accumulate the level as seen 
within “Value & Growth” in the Results Tile. 
At each level a weighting scheme is introduced so that each individual or team 
responsible for security assessments can set this weighting scheme to their own 
needs and adjust it as needed. Such a customizable framework closely models 
how you might embed your own perspective into the analysis. The display 
becomes a combination of the investment’s inherent characteristics combined 
with your own position. 
Key Take-Aways
This section proposes a standardized Tile Framework that can be used to 
assess securities. The Tile Framework presents the summary or abridged 
level of information as an entry point to access the underlying details. 
Data sets are first logically grouped to compose two Profile Tiles. One Tile 
of data shows the characteristics of a security. Another Tile of data shows 
the investment results of the security. Both have the capacity to drill in to 
source data; however, the Results Tile enables you to apply custom weights 
to the security. Together, the Tile Framework produces a normalized data 
display designed to compare different security types.
Stocks
Asset class, market cap, sectors, and regions are stock characteristics that 
can be used to describe a stock.  This investment type can act as our common 
denominator as it shares many of the same traits, such as sectors and regions, 
with other securities. The benefit to starting with the basic traits of a stock is 
that it can create the same context for comparison across other security types. 
The Stock Tile, shown in Figure 3.4, adopts a color band chart to identify a 
stock’s characteristics.

Color connotes meaning and can be used to attach simple associations. The 
color band chart follows this lead with a set of color mappings that uses color 
fill to denote specific characteristics. The two stocks listed in the Stock Tile 
(Figure 3.4) show similarities and differences between their two profiles; the 
yellow overlay is one example of how to highlight such a difference. As previ-
ously stated, the characteristics provide just one aspect of the security. The next 
visual (Figure 3.5), shows the two Profile Tiles, Characteristics and Results, and 
adds a third. 
Together, the three Tiles provide a suitable introduction to the stock. The 
first Tile shows the current stock performance. The second Tile describes the 
specifics of the categorical characteristics. The third Tile provides a closer 
analysis of the performance, valuation, risk, and ratings results and layers in 
the comparative peer measurement. The Stock Tiles Schematic (Figure 3.5) 
shows just how data-rich the display can become and exactly what is behind 
the color codes.

The effort behind organizing the data into a visual system produces con-
cise and informative views of the data. You can rely on the Tiles’ knowing 
they are backed with readily available detailed schematics that explain the 
color bands.

Bonds
Connected to the interest rate market, bonds provide an interesting mix of 
both the predictability of a scheduled coupon payment and the unpredict-
ability of interest rates. These well-known traits are exclusive to bonds and are 
fundamental to why investors look to bonds. Yet just as importantly, the ratings, 
interest rate risk, yield, and maturity are additional key characteristics of bonds 
to consider. These unique data points are reflected in the profile framework for 
bonds. The next set of Tiles, as shown in Figure 3.6, applies the profile frame-
work and addresses the specific needs of bonds.

The maturity, quality, sectors, and regions can all be varied to represent differ-

how the color bands can describe and distinguish bonds. How does the coupon 
rate compare to the category average? How strong is the quality rating? The Bond 
Tile Schematic (Figure 3.7) addresses these questions with additional Tiles that 
are mapped to a schematic diagram.

Figure 3.7  Bond Tiles Schematic
Simulated to show the range of possible permutations, the Bond Tiles Schematic 
has adapted and isolated characteristics that are unique to bonds. For example, 
the ability to identify a government, corporate, municipal bond, and so on is a 
part of the adapted sector view. The third Tile continues to show the relative 
comparison to the category average performance illustrated with a dashed line. 
With these results, you can spot bonds that perform above industry average 
with lower risk. 

44    Chapter 3: Security Assessment
Key Take-Aways
This section illustrates how to adapt the framework to include specific 
bond traits like quality rating, maturity dates, and coupon rates. With the 
previously shown Stock Tiles and now the Bond Tiles, you can see how to 
incorporate the unique characteristics of each into a standardized frame-
work. The current price, characteristics, and relative results Tiles provide an 
introduction, comparison, and contrast of stocks and bonds. 
Mutual Funds
Although marketed as providing a good investment option of diversification 
for retirement accounts and beyond, mutual funds attract a range of investors. 
The asset class, market cap, sector, and region weights are fundamental traits of 
mutual funds and are well documented and commonly displayed with multiple 
charts. Figure 3.8 displays these traits by applying the framework of the Charac-
teristics Tile to a stock mutual fund.

The consistency of a visual framework has both pros and cons. A quick glance 
of the Stock Mutual Fund Tile (refer to Figure 3.8) highlights the fund’s sector 
diversity. However, the same quick glance may also miss the title label which 
tells you the investment name and and type. Consistency and standardization 
normalize the data for better comparison but they also require you to pay closer 
attention to the labels. 
For this reason, explaining the visual’s anatomy with labels requires a shift of 
attention. The Tile schematic (Figure 3.9) uses a previously shown technique that 
pushes the Tiles’ visuals to the background to present the labels in the foreground.

The same schematic technique shown for bonds in Figure 3.7 and stocks in 
Figure 3.5 explains Tile contents by revealing differences between security type 
Tiles. Similar to a tool tip, data labels in the schematic provide explanations of 
the Tiles. In addition, each Tile has a corresponding set of drill-down displays 
so that you can see more details regarding the make-up of the fund. Next, Fig-
ure 3.10 illustrates a drill-down of the Characteristics Tile.

Figure 3.13  Tile Band–Level 2 Options
Figure 3.13 provides two methods to compare the fund’s sector weights to the 
category average. In the weights representation on the left, the bars provide a 
dual purpose. The bar lengths indicate quantity weights and color indicates the 
offset from the category average and exposes either an under- or over-exposure 
to a sector. In the example on the right, in addition to using color to highlight 
offsets from the category average, alignment is a powerful technique in drawing 
attention to a different focus point. It is organized to pivot from the centerline 
of the category average, and separates the sector weights into two categories: 
The left side of the centerline shows under-exposed sectors and the right side 
shows over-exposed sectors. 

50    Chapter 3: Security Assessment
Simple alignment alterations can change one’s perspective on data and serve as 
an influential tool. With clarity comes understanding, which can ultimately lead 
to influence. If variation from the average is an important perspective, the left 
chart is ill equipped to tell that story. It requires you to calculate the variation. 
In contrast, the chart on the right makes the variation clear. You can elect to 
show one chart over another or both (Figure 3.13).
Key Take-Aways
This section applies the framework to stock mutual funds and shows 
how to drill down into sector weightings. The same drill-down technique 
can be applied to the Asset Allocation and Market Capitalization charac-
teristics and should ideally be applied across the Tile Bands to maintain 
consistency. 
Consistency in marks and patterns makes the framework more familiar and 
usable. You can include a variety of drill-down views  depending on the 
needs of your audience. Regardless of your drill-down selections, the same 
set of drill-down levels should be applied across all Tiles Bands to ensure 
that comparison is possible.
ETFs
Tied to an index, an ETF, or exchange-traded fund, provides a holistic view of 
its market’s economic strength, diversification, and outlook with the flexibility 
to purchase intra-day. As a large competitor to the mutual fund, consistent 
data points in the ETF provide a good comparison between the two securities. 
Figure 3.14 shows a case in which the ETF profile has identical characteristics to 
the mutual fund.
The Stock ETF Tile Schematic (Figure 3.14) is an exact replica of the previous 
Stock Mutual Fund Tile set. Both are based on stocks as the underlying security. 
For this reason, the same set of drill-downs that appear in the mutual fund 
(Figure 3.10–3.13) can be applied to this ETF. Similarly, certain characteristics 
within the Bond Tiles could apply to a Bond ETF Tile set. Figure 3.7 provides a 
schematic that could also be applied to a Bond ETF.

In the top Tile Band, the translucent yellow bar spans the entire row horizon-
tally to show the percentage of the overall regional exposure within emerging 
markets. In the bottom bar chart, the color yellow shows you the slice of the 
emerging markets within each region. The vertical bold lines mark the bond 
fund’s weights, whereas the dashed lines mark the category average weights. 
You may notice there is one case in which the marks slightly overlap—at the 
Americas category average dash line mark at 19.50 and the emerging markets 
yellow bar at 19.81. For these types of cases, numerical values uphold visual 
charts with data values. However, these specific values represent aggregated 
values that can be expanded upon. Next, Figure 3.16 shows the data within the

Figure 3.16  Layered Tile Band–Level 2
Layered Tile Band – Level 2 shows a more complete display of details to make 
the implicit explicit. The chart purposefully maintains a cross-region view. The 
deliberate decision to include all regions in one view rather than separate drill-
down views provides the following benefits:
▸
▸Context—A view across the different regions shows the weights in con-
text of all the regions.

54    Chapter 3: Security Assessment
▸
▸Consistent order—The detailed view is organized first by listing devel-
oped regions, and second by the emerging regions. This order mirrors 
the order of the Tile and follows the list of Americas, Greater Europe, 
Greater Asia, and Emerging. 
▸
▸Simple navigation—A complete view eliminates the back and forth 
requirements of navigating up to drill back down again.
▸
▸Flexibility—You can decide which Tile views to include. For example, 
you are not forced to follow one sequential path but instead can bypass 
certain displays. 
The next chart maintains the order of the regions, but changes alignment to 
guide an intelligent interpretation of the data. Figure 3.17 provides two displays 
of the data in side-by-side views.

Figure 3.17 shows how you can illustrate the same data, in the same order but 
with an altered visual structure to draw attention to a different point. The 
chart on the left starts the bar charts from a zero point on the left to compare 
region weights. The chart on the right places the starting point of the category 
average in the center and then assigns offsets from the category average. Under-
exposure of a region is shown in orange, and over-exposure is shown in green; 
the yellow background highlights emerging markets.
Key Take-Aways
Seen as one of the fastest growing competitors to mutual funds, investors 
are flocking to ETFs, and assets managers are shifting their business struc-
tures to provide ETF selection. Similar data points and comparisons make 
it easy to apply the framework to both stock and bond mutual funds. The 
Stock ETF Tiles are an example of how to reuse the Tile schematic from one 
security to another. A key to reuse is to adapt the same set of drill-down 
displays used in other security profiles.
Tile Collection
The Tile Collection (Figure 3.18) shows the standardized Tiles and how they each 
apply to a few investment types. The collection displays the quote, characteristics, 
and resulting outcomes across stocks, bonds, stock mutual funds, and stock ETFs. 
Diversity, relative rank, and conservative/aggressive profiles are all a part of the 
Tile communications. The push to standardize has brought with it benefits, not 
just for better comparison, but also for the opportunity to identify the key com-
parison points. You can decide to amend the framework and identify a different 
set of comparison points. The framework is flexible and can accommodate other 
aggregate values you would like to highlight.

Figure 3.19  Tile Collection with Results Tiles

58    Chapter 3: Security Assessment
Extreme differences from the category average are a simple way to identify out-
liers. Both Results Tiles provide the opportunity to clearly spot those outliers 
(refer to Figure 3.19). Apart from the category average, you can use other types 
of reference points such as benchmark index, portfolio average, peer average, or 
a custom collection of averages. Additional Tiles can be included to show other 
comparative aspects of the data. 
Key Take-Aways
Tiles are compact and communicate summary statements of representa-
tive data points (that is, outcomes of performance, value/growth, risk, and 
ratings). Each Tile is designed to summarize and surface the distinguishing 
traits of each security. For example, securities with unique characteristics 
such as stocks and other investments with emerging markets stand out 
from the list. The Stock Tile displays full color bands for characteristics, 
whereas the Stock ETF is diversified with investments in emerging markets 
shown with a yellow overlay. These distinctions define the security and 
make it easy to pick out from the collection. 
As a collection, the Tiles are easy to compare and contrast. The layout 
enables you to review the Tiles in rows or columns. The Tile Framework 
enables comparison because each Tile has a consistent structure. Both 
the data and the presentation of the data have been normalized to make 
comparisons possible. For example, rows of Tiles describe the security; 
and each row contains the same number and order of Tiles. Meanwhile, 
columns of Tiles provide cross comparison of the list.
Summary
This chapter proposes a unified method to assess various securities within a 
single framework by using Tiles. Some visualizations require time to learn 
before you can immediately understand the data. The visualizations throughout 
this chapter do require some learning, but Tiles provide schematics to identify

data points, so you don’t have to memorize them. The following list includes 
unique visualization techniques covered in this chapter:

The Tile Framework is flexible and can be adapted to represent different data 
points. It can be extended to include more Tiles to describe a security, as shown 
in Figure 3.19; or it can scale to support other securities. The framework can be 
amended to include additional bands within the characteristics or results Tiles; 
or it can include different data points within each band. The framework is flex-
ible in terms of how you drill down into subsequent detail views. You can elect 
which views to present when and link them together. The flexibility to adapt 
different data points must be paired with consistency to enable comparison: 
the number and type of bands, Tiles, and drill-down views must be the same 
throughout. Consistency makes the framework a reliable tool for assessing 
securities.


Portfolio Construction 4
Portfolio construction distinguishes itself as the phase in which all the efforts of various 
investment professionals come together to create the portfolio best suited for the client. 
In addition to the work performed in the Security Assessment phase of the Investment 
Process, the Portfolio Construction phase brings together three analytical tasks of a 
more global nature: Asset Allocation, Sector Analysis, and Risk Management.
Firms that place their primary emphasis on the Portfolio Construction phase believe 
there are forces at work at the market level, the asset class level, and at the sector level 
that are more than just the sum of the micro factors driving individual securities. Hence 
the focus of this chapter is on those firms that place an added priority on macro level 
thinking in the construct of their client portfolios. 
This chapter uses macro level data sets to cover a range of Portfolio Construction activi-
ties that reflect on macro level thinking. It starts with a review of the efficient frontier 
to discuss the diversification space of asset allocation. Next, we review sector leadership 
data: One data set presents 20 years of sector performance ranking and another includes 
22 alpha factors. Our last section on risk management involves multiple data visualiza-
tions: One set presents better methods to showcase the overlap of holdings and another 
presents stress tests across a set of portfolios.
﻿    61

62    Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
The visualizations throughout this Chapter use representative sample data and 
are not specific to a source. Although the visualizations are designed as interac-
tive displays that can be configured and navigated by an end user, they are also 
well suited to be incorporated into presentation materials.
Asset Allocation
The broadest, most macro-oriented level of thinking for the Portfolio Con-
struction phase is that of Asset Allocation. This is the phase at which the 
organization determines the overall weights to be given in the portfolio (either 
at initiation or at reallocation) to major asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and 
cash. These weights may be expressed for some firms in absolute terms and for 
other firms as an over-weight or under-weight relative to some defined bench-
mark. The weights, when set, fluctuate with time, as discussed in Chapter 6, 
“Performance Measurement,” and are subject to adjustment over time as the 
portfolio’s investment results are received and interpreted.
Asset Allocation analysis can become tentative and fluctuate with the specific 
recommendations of the security analysts. Most Asset Allocation analysis is 
done through the use of asset class indexes serving as representative bogeys 
for the holdings of securities eventually chosen for the portfolios. This enables 
detailed analysis of a variety of asset mixes, and the development of useful visu-
alizations regarding the risks and returns of those mixes, without the Portfolio 
Construction team having to wait on the results of the Security Assessment 
team. The visualizations offered here follow this accepted pattern of using broad 
market indexes to represent common asset classes.
As Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) indicates, portfolio diversification leads to 
the “efficient frontier.” The ability to show a risk and reward trade-off is often 
done with the context of the efficient frontier. To that end, Figures 4.1 and 4.2 
use the efficient frontier as the underlying fabric to plot and compare asset allo-
cation mixes.

Figure 4.1  2-D to 3-D Surface
A benefit to the three-dimensional chart is that it illustrates a greater perspec-
tive of the actual shape of the object being rendered. As a contrast to a 2-D 
version, the 3-D version shows the true shape of the data. With the 3-D version, 
you can see the data as a curved plane. Because you can see the full plane, the 
plotted data points are also in full view. 
In practice it may take a lot of computing power to identify and assess a cur-
rent and proposed asset allocation mix for the wanted risk and reward levels. 
Depending on the firm, the universe of securities to assess and include in a 
portfolio can range from hundreds to tens of thousands. Because of this, bin-
ning assets (grouping by a defined interval) into the surface plot can adjust to 
meet what might be possible, required, and desirable from a computational 
performance standpoint.

Figure 4.2  3-D Surface Plot
Although square binning (as illustrated on the surface of the 3-D surface plot in 
Figure 4.2) is one of the simplest forms, hexagonal binning provides the best flex-
ibility, efficiency, and data accuracy in a grid. The hexagon shape makes it more 
accurate because the center point is equidistant to the vertex boarder points. It 
is the shape that both creates a grid structure and has a lower perimeter to area 
ratio. Figure 4.3 covers the surface plot with hexagonal binning to provide a 
more flexible binning structure to mirror the universe of securities available.

Figure 4.3  3-D Hexagonal Surface Plot

66    Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
The hexagonal surface enables you to create an efficient frontier plot of your 
securities based on the precision you create. For example, you can control and 
to scale the bin sizes up or down so that large bins can target generalized asset 
allocation targets, whereas smaller bins can target more precise asset allocation 
targets.
The surface plot reveals the efficient frontier on the chart and makes the risk/
reward trade-off clear. Because the efficient frontier is based on estimates 
from past data and model projections, the panel is mapped to an estimated 
coordinate system to better optimize returns. For more specific data, the panel 
lists the corresponding information that maps to the identified location, cur-
rent allocations based on historical data, and proposed allocations based on 
aggregate model projections. The data panel makes the 3-D Surface Plot more 
discernable.
In general, it is hard to discern a particular location or set of locations on three-
dimensional charts because the perspective view loses a direct connection to the 
x-, y-, and z-axis. However, the data panel alleviates this challenge and pinpoints 
the values of the selected location. As an interactive system, the data panel can 
identify two locations for comparison. Therefore, the ability to identify the location 
on the chart with the data panel removes the general difficulties of a 3-D chart. As 
a means of comparing two data points across a curved plane, the 3-D version with 
the data panel provides a clear picture of the deltas between the two points.
Key Take-Aways
The 3-D Surface Plot (Figures 4.2 and 4.3) proves you can leverage the 3-D 
chart for its inherit strengths and amend its weaknesses with the introduc-
tion of data panels. As a method for comparing multiple asset allocations 
across a mix of asset classes, Figure 4.3 shows the location and the deltas 
of two specific asset balances in context of the efficient frontier. Data from 
the two asset balances are based on the surface locations. These locations 
use hexagonal binning to create the surface area of the plot. As a tech-
nique, hexagonal binning provides more flexibility and accuracy in your 
representation of the data. The shape creates accuracy, while the ability to 
scale the bin size up or down provides flexibility.

Sector Analysis    67
Sector Analysis
The next step down in the Portfolio Construction phase, after the Asset Alloca-
tion analysis has been performed, is to engage in Sector Analysis. The essence of 
Sector Analysis is that it is somewhat of a bridge between the high-level global 
macro factors that drive the asset classes and the most atomistic levels within 
those asset classes, namely the securities. Ultimately, the point of the offered 
visualizations will be to show how sector effects can best be visualized—the 
particular sector categorization scheme is less important; the offered tech-
niques work whichever schema is chosen.
We choose to provide our visualization examples for Sector Analysis here in the 
Portfolio Construction chapter in keeping with the theme that there are driving 
factors in the market that can move either an asset class or a sector within an 
asset class. Studying sector returns reveals intriguing information. For example, 
from year to year the sector returns can vary widely between the top-perform-
ing and bottom-performing sectors. Many portfolio managers like to capitalize 
on these variations and are aware of their magnitude.
Sector Leadership
This section examines and compares various graphical methods for displaying 
sector returns. The following sector leadership charts provide a range of visual 
techniques that show you the advantages and disadvantages of displaying data 
differently. The Calendar Year Returns of the Russell 1000 equity index, as 
shown in Figure 4.4, shows a sector chart that is commonly used to illustrate 
relative ranking and absolute returns. This sector chart, also known and ref-
erenced in the industry as the quilt chart or periodic table, is often applied to 
other attributes such as asset classes, markets, and alpha factors across various 
timeframes.

Russell 1000: Calendar Year Returns
Figure 4.4  Quilt Chart
The Calendar Year Returns chart organizes the data into a series of small tiles 
that each represents a sector. The organizational principle of each column is to 
stack sector tiles in rank order of best to worst performance returns, whereas 
the horizontal sequence tracks yearly progression. Each sector is assigned a 
unique color, which is maintained across the horizontal sequence (i.e., over 
time), which when combined with the tiles creates a patchwork quilt effect. 
The challenge with the Russell 1000 Calendar Year Returns chart is that it is not 
possible to see the actual numerical spread of sectoral investment performance 
within each year. The yearly spread has been visually eliminated and presented 
solely as numeric values—you are left to calculate the spread yourself. The 
Calendar Year Returns chart does not use visual cues to track spreads across the 
years but instead requires you to review each number and bit of text within each 
tile to derive the ranking, value, and name of each sector.

Sector Analysis    69
Next, consider an alternative approach to this same chart in which the table is 
organized by sector and the color scale is used to showcase the ranking. In the 
Calendar Year Returns: Sector Ranking version (Figure 4.5) a heatmap empha-
sizes sector ranking. A color gradient uses two opposite colors/hues to show a 
change in value.

Figure 4.5  Heatmap
Figure 4.5 applies a heatmap technique to the same data and organizes the rows 
to track each sector performance over time. Each column contains tiles ranging 
from orange indicating the worst-performing sector to blue representing the 
best-performing sector. The years are still represented along the top to logically 
show the progression of time moving to the right. 
Figure 4.5 illustrates incremental improvements in visual communication. 
Because the chart is structured with sectors listed in rows, it is easier for you to 
identify each sector and see how it has performed over time. The sector labels

also eliminate the need to include the abbreviated sector text in each tile. The 
next chart takes a step further toward simplifying how to visually communicate 
the information. The gray scale shown in Figure 4.6 enables you to focus on a 
“unidirectional” system of rank.

Russell 1000: Calendar Year Returns
Figure 4.6  Grayscale Heatmap
In contrast to a color gradient system that uses two opposite colors to rep-
resent a change in value, a unidirectional system gradually changes a single 
color value in one direction. The top-ranked sectors in each year are shown in 
black, whereas the bottom ranked sectors are shown in the lightest gray. You 
can quickly scan the chart and recognize the top-ranked sector as well as the 
bottom-ranked sector.
Though the use of gray scale can improve readability, other challenges remain. 
For example, the slight gradations of gray can make it difficult to distinguish 
between the middle-ranking sectors, fourth and fifth, or fifth and sixth sectors. 

Sector Analysis    71
This type of chart should not be used for such granular analysis. However, 
Figure 4.7 shows another way to represent sector ranking that offers more preci-
sion to more directly determine relative ranking.

Figure 4.7  Bar Track Chart–Row
Much like a tapestry, Figure 4.7 shows a rich picture that tells an evolved story 
of the data. The height of each sector bar represents the corresponding rank as 
shown in the legend: The bar for the top-ranked sector in each calendar year is 
outlined in green and the levels to each of the bars correspond to sector ranking 
position. To the right of the chart, the bars under the Sector Ranking heading 
provide a broader contextual view of overall sector ranking. The full bar lengths 
represent the cumulative sector rankings across the years; Energy is listed at 
the top because it has the highest overall ranking, whereas Utilities listed at the 
bottom shows the lowest overall ranking. The green section of the bar shows 
how many times the sector held the top rank rating.

72    Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
If you are interested in quickly seeing top-ranking sectors, you would favor a 
chart similar to Calendar Year Returns: Sector Ranking (Figure 4.7). The hori-
zontal line visually attached to each sector makes it particularly easy to see how 
well a sector has performed over the 20 years. The green bar outline stands out  
and enables you to identify the top-ranked sector for each year. 
The Sector Ranking Cumulative chart provides a summary view of the data 
to complete the data story. This cumulative data extends the chart and pro-
vides additional relative calculations in a visual easy-to-consume format. For 
example, as shown in Figure 4.7, the Energy sector has the highest cumulative 
ranking, whereas Information Technology has ranked first more often than any 
other sector. It is interesting to see just how close all sectors rank to each other 
in terms of cumulative ranking. It’s likely that you would not be able to see the 
cumulative ranking if you had to rely solely on the yearly bar charts.   
However, rank order is not the only important data point to highlight. The abso-
lute value of returns and their variation is often essential to the overall analysis 
of sector performance. Figure 4.8 addresses this requirement.
The Calendar Year Returns: Sector Returns chart (refer to Figure 4.8) provides 
you with a sorted view based on the absolute returns of each sector. Here, 
individual black and red bars represent yearly intervals to indicate positive 
and negative return, respectively. Both sector and year average returns are also 
shown at the right and bottom of the chart. In this case, the averages are equally 
weighted by sector and calculated with losses and gains observed across the 
years.
The horizontal line that unites each sector enables you to read each sector as a 
group. The horizontal sector line serves two purposes 1) improves scanability, 
meaning that it provides a consistent anchor to follow a sector’s performance 
across the years, and 2) creates space efficiency. By introducing color to repre-
sent negative or positive returns, the chart remains compact without taking 
up the space that would be needed to represent negative returns below the 
horizontal sector line. The color red is not just space-efficient but is also an easy 
mechanism to visually differentiate negative returns.

Figure 4.8  Bar Track Chart–Row with Pivot Summary
The dotted line that represents the average line plus the text values enables you 
to compare a particular year’s results to a historical average point of 11.16. For 
example, you can contrast Information Technology’s average return of 15.19% 
to Telecom Services’ 8.76% returns. Again, with the use of the average line, you 
are provided with a small but meaningful visual indicator that enables compar-
ison across all these examples. Structuring the data in this visual format with 
the average line shows the deviation from the mean. You no longer have to be 

74    Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
concerned with extracting meaning from numerical information, but instead 
you can extend and confirm your own knowledge with the use of the chart. 
Despite these improvements to the Sector Returns chart, the relative ranking 
is missing. You may still question: What was the top rank within each year? 
Although the Sector Returns chart focuses on each sector, you may want to 
instead focus on each year. Perhaps, you would like to compare the relative 
returns of all the sectors within each year. Next, Figure 4.9 considers these 
additional points.

Figure 4.9  Bar Track Chart–Column with Pivot Summaries

Sector Analysis    75
Figure 4.9 focuses on sector differentiation by structuring the data to show 
relative sector returns. The chart introduces a yellow triangle to visually tag the 
best-ranking sector within each year and a thin black line to show the worst-
ranking sector. In some years it might be difficult to distinguish the worst rank-
ing sector. The width of each black bar is directly correlated to the variation 
from the worst-performing sector and therefore similar widths communicate 
small variations. The sort order and listing of the sectors is based on historical 
average returns. Combining the elements of rank, variation, and average returns 
underscores the overall relative nature of the chart: 
▸
▸Ranking—In this chart (refer to Figure 4.9), iconography in the form of 
a yellow marker is introduced into the visualization to indicate which is 
the best-ranked sector. Yellow against black applies a high level of con-
trast that is well-suited to highlight exceptional occurrences.
▸
▸Variation—Organized by year, the relative return values are easy to 
detect and clearly show you the variations. The vertical alignment of the 
bar charts enables you to review each year and compare relative return 
values across sectors. For example, in 1999, Information Technology 
significantly over performed the worst sector, whereas Utilities only 
slightly over performed the worst sector. By disregarding the gain or loss 
aspect of performance and concentrating on sector differentiation, this 
view creates a clearer image of which sector performed better and by 
how much. 
▸
▸Average Returns—As shown in the Sector Ranking chart(s), Informa-
tion Technology, followed by Energy and Health Care are the top overall 
ranking sectors across the past 20 years. In addition, you can also put 
this in context with the period average returns for both the sector and 
year. The averages are equally weighted by sector and calculated with 
losses and gains observed. What is especially visible in this data repre-
sentation is how relative performance spread changed from year to year, 
showing dramatic differences in 1999 and 2000 compared with greatly 
reduced sector variation in 2013.

76    Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
Although Figure 4.9 provides a broad relative perspective of the data, another 
plausible option is part of relative performance. The Variation from all Sectors 
Average chart (Figure 4.10) manipulates the same data and showcases deviation 
from the mean.

Calendar Year Returns: Variation From All Sectors Average
Figure 4.10  Bar Track Chart–Column with Pivot Summaries
The main intent of Figure 4.10 is to answer the question With regard to sector 
leadership across the past 20 years, how much of a deviation from the all sectors’ 
average (of 11.16) was observed? This chart introduces deviation from the sec-
tors’ average with the use of color; black indicates a positive variation from the 
sectors’ average, whereas red indicates a negative variation. The use of color in 

Sector Analysis    77
this manner introduces a concise and consistent way of displaying the  
Bar charts. 
▸
▸Concise Core Chart—While maintaining a constant row height, the 
chart uses adjusted column widths to use horizontal space more effi-
ciently. Without extending the width of the chart, you can understand 
that in 1999 Information Technology greatly over performed the 12.5% 
sector average for the year, whereas Consumer Staples greatly under 
performed. 
▸
▸Concise Average Returns—Because the sectors are sorted by descend-
ing order, introducing color to this part of the chart enables you to 
quickly see the cut-off between a positive and negative deviation. To 
supplement, displaying the numeric value of the deviation from the mean 
enables you to numerically compare the averages and the deviation from 
the mean in the context of the visual display.
▸
▸Consistent: The consistent use of red and black provides a standard 
understanding of use. The average returns across the years are contrasted 
against the deviation from the mean with the use of color. 
Knowing the relative nature of performance enables you to better present 
and analyze your own performance in a sector. At the bottom of the chart, 
the horizontal “All Sectors Average Returns” is shown as a reference point 
to review the core chart. For example, the year 2000 has the greatest under-
performing deviations, as noted with Information Technology and Telecom 
Services, with a reference point of 8.2% as the average sector return. In con-
trast, in 2008, the average sector return was –35.9% and the Financials sector 
still had a considerable under-performing deviation from the mean. These ref-
erence points (like “All Sectors Average Returns”) provide additional context 
to answer “Exactly how bad is bad for this year if your money is in these sectors 
of the market?” 

78    Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
Key Take-Aways
As shown in the Tapestry Bar Charts (Figures 4.7–4.10), different views of the 
same data sets can lead to better insights into sector performance. Each 
chart uses distinct structural and visual methods that offer a unique per-
spective of the data. Depending on the points you would like to make, you 
can select from any combination of these charts to further communicate or 
analyze returns. As a collection, the charts can convincingly illustrate a full 
spectrum of specific points you can convey to your audience.
Sectors and Alpha Factors
In Chapter 3, Security Assessment, we offer the idea of alpha factors that drive 
individual securities. In this chapter we offer the idea that there are sector 
effects separate from security factors, and we present visualization techniques 
for those in the preceding sections. In this section, however, we acknowledge 
that there is a hybrid concept—the idea that the securities within a sector might 
have different alpha factors—or react differently to the same alpha factors—as 
securities in other sectors. This information could have been offered in either 
chapter—we chose to offer it here.
Interactive tools that combine both sector groupings and alpha factor analysis 
take steps toward a powerful system that provides dynamic updates to filter, 
sort, and regroup the table display. The ability to select from a range of alpha 
factors that best align to the strategy is a key strength of a dynamic system. The 
ability to not only select various alpha factors but to also select date range and 
frequency adds flexibility to the system. You can ask the system, Which sector 
performed the best in regards to alpha factor X? Which alpha factor showed the 
most consistent returns over the past ten years?
The Prior Day Factor dashboard, as shown in Figure 4.11, is organized to show a 
spectrum of alpha factor returns across all the sectors for a specified time. 
The table is constructed to show factor spreads and is organized in a range of 
positive to negative; green signifies positive, whereas red signifies negative. The 
top row, F1-FN Spread, summarizes alpha factor averages starting with the top 
returns of Beta and ending with the bottom returns of Long Term Momentum. 

Sector Analysis    79
F1-FN are the factor exposures in which F1 is the first factor and FN is the sub-
sequent list of factors. The numeric text inside each cell reinforces and reiterates 
the values with a corresponding color fill.

Figure 4.11  Heatmap–Green and Red
Presorting and organizing data into clear groups of performance leaders and 
performance laggers is a useful technique many find effective. Despite this 
improvement of an organized table, there are a few shortcomings to the visual. 
The combination of the numbers and color fill is conflicting and makes a dark 
color and bold text fight for your attention. In addition, the list of alpha factors 
is shown as a flat list with no organizational constructs. This sample data shows 
22 alpha factors. How can this dashboard be designed to scale up and double or 
triple in size? As a dashboard display, what can be done to bubble up informa-
tion into consolidated space efficient displays?
Mixing a table of data with visual indicators is often used in spreadsheets. In 
theory, this overall approach is a good one because it presents both textual 
information and visual information. Relying solely on hue-based visual indica-
tors can be tough for the color-blind reader to decode. Therefore, showing the 
text as a supplement can be the supporting attribute to the visual. Alternative 

80    Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
methods improve the legibility of the text but enable the color to act as a sup-
porting visual aide. To improve the legibility, first consider the step to change 
the cell color, as shown in Figure 4.12. 
The inability to distinguish between green and red colors is by far the most com-
mon color vision deficiency and impacts 8% of the worldwide male population 
and 0.5% of the female population. (“Color Perception” by Michael Kalloniatis

Figure 4.12  Heatmap–Blue and Orange
The Heatmap – Blue and Orange replaces the previous green and red colors 
with blue and orange; in this case, blue signifies positive performance, whereas 
orange signifies negative performance. The top row labeled F1-FN Spread drives 
the organizational structure of ordering the factors from positive returns on the 
left to negative returns on the right. In addition to this left-to-right organization, 
the sectors in the table have also been reordered by performance. Energy and 
Materials are both listed at the top of the list with the best overall performance, 
whereas Utilities and Telecom Services are listed at the bottom with the worst 
overall performance, which is determined by the average across the alphas. 
NOTE

Sector Analysis    81
Two modifications have been introduced in Figure 4.12. The first improves leg-
ibility to the red/green colorblind community with the use of blue and orange. 
The second slightly changes the organizational structure of the chart by altering 
the sector order by performance. These two small modifications become the 
foundational stepping stones that enable more improvements. 
A common practice is to combine the list of alpha factors into groups to answer: 
Which sector provides the best overall returns within risk or growth factors? Fig-
ures 4.13 and 4.14 introduce the organizational construct of factor groupings. 
Rather than analyzing individual factors, Heatmap Groups create categories of 
alpha factors for you to evaluate and see how categorical groupings either have 
consistent or inconsistent returns across all sectors. The dashboard display 
can also analyze each sector independently. For example, earnings per share of 
Information Technology shows positive performance both at the category level 
and at the individual factor level. Equipped with categorized data, you can more 
readily spot themes in the data.

Prior Day Factor Dashboard
Figure 4.14  Heatmap Groups–With and Without Numeric Values
Dashboard displays are often used to get an overall view of status and key 
performance indicators. In a relatively small amount of space, dashboards are 
meant to bubble up the most salient information. As an interactive display, a 
dashboard can be flexible to progressively display either more or less details of 
the data. High-level, mid-level and detail views provide the rationale for and 
disclosure of what is behind the numbers. 
These particular types of dashboards are easy to implement with Excel’s condi-
tional cell formatting. Because of this, heatmap dashboards are commonly used 
to highlight individual and aggregate cell data. Yet there are specific techniques 
that can push the dashboard metaphor further. For example, an interactive 
dashboard can progressively disclose more details within the same view. Inter-
active systems are designed and built to display various states, each controlled

by the end user. In addition, you can remove the numerical data and present 
only the color cells. Figure 4.15 consolidates the alpha factor groups to a single 
value.

Figure 4.15  Heatmap Groups–Consolidated
This display can reduce the number of columns from the original 17 (refer to 
Figure 4.10) to 4. This flexible approach opens the possibility for you to abstract 
the data, show the details, or include more group factors into the view.
In many cases, you may want to select from a range of alpha factors, inspect 
a few closely, and then maintain the other alpha factors in view as a point of 
comparison. Interactive dashboards can be flexible and enable varying levels 
of detail to be set by each factor group. Figure 4.16 illustrates the varying levels 
you can display.

Prior Day Factor Dashboard
Figure 4.16  Heatmap Groups–Expand and Collapse
The ability to customize and see details within aggregated data sets provides 
various levels of context. The benefits of a flexible system (refer to Figure 4.16) 
that ranges from detail to aggregate are three-fold: 
▸
▸Smoothly Scale—The ability to expand and collapse heatmap groups 
enables you to scale. You can scale up and include more alpha fac-
tors all in the same view without compromising the results of the 
communication. 
▸
▸Track Themes—Aggregations enable patterns and themes to emerge in 
the data. Secondary and tertiary levels of aggregation provide enough 

Risk Management    85
abstraction in the heat map views to scan the dashboard and confidently 
evaluate common behaviors in the data as themes. In addition, you can 
validate the observed theme by navigating to a more detailed view. 
▸
▸Focus Attention—Fully expanded detail views of the data provide focus 
with color and numerical data present for close inspection. The naviga-
tion system across the levels enables you to select a set of alpha factors to 
closely review and still maintain a summarized view of the other factors. 
Key Take-Aways
The Prior Day Dashboard is a tool that is both legible and flexible enough 
to reveal themes. By first converting the red/green colors to an orange/
blue combination and then reordering the sectors by performance, 
you can improve the legibility of the dashboard. The color change also 
improves the legibility of the numeric values. Because the background 
color is subdominant, you can embed or omit the numeric values from the 
cell and not compromise the legibility of the color value or the numeric 
value. Second, flexibility is achieved through navigation. You can navigate 
through three levels, ranging from a detail view to an aggregate view. 
Combining both design principles of legibility and flexibility creates results 
that help you discover themes in the data.
Risk Management
Risk Management can be divided between ex ante Risk Management and 
ex post Risk Management. Ex ante Risk Management takes place during 
the Portfolio Construction phase of the Investment Process. The phrase ex 
ante refers to the idea of analyzing the risk in the portfolio (or even in the 
individual securities) prior to the portfolio being implemented. As such the 
analysis of risk at the pre-implementation phase of Portfolio Construction 
allows for, just as in the Asset Allocation phase, the consideration of many 
different potential combinations of asset classes, sectors, and portfolios. 
Whereas up to this point in the chapter the analysis of asset mixes, sector 
weights, and individual securities has focused on the value that each decision 

86    Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
might add to the overall portfolio, ex ante Risk Management recasts those 
possible combinations according to what pain they might cause the portfolio 
if implemented. There is no free lunch, as the saying goes, and for every com-
bination that might add value to a portfolio, there is the risk of loss and/or 
under-performance of a benchmark. 
This section covers examples that can be used in both ex-post and ex-ante Risk 
Management. However, the set of three Risk Management methods provided 
here can be used to inform Portfolio Construction and as such have been incor-
porated into this section. The first method reviews the overlap of holdings and 
searches for high correlations in the data. The second method models various 
risk scenarios as a series of what-if scenarios. Stress testing provides a view into 
relative losses due to exogenous shocks and the absolute amount of the loss. The 
third example addresses multifactor risk attribution: The investigative process 
to identify where risk is coming from. Although the examples are shown at the 
firm level, you can also apply these methods to a group of funds or to an indi-
vidual portfolio. 
The responsibility to perform ex ante Risk Management may fall onto any 
number of individuals, depending on the investment philosophy of the invest-
ment firm. In most cases, however, ex ante Risk Management—especially at 
the Portfolio Construction level—falls to the Portfolio Management team to 
execute. Other parties may sometimes be involved in contributing to the ex 
ante Risk Management process as well. For example, there may be an indepen-
dent risk or compliance unit in the firm that enforces the idea that there are 
limits and identifies what those limits should be to the ex ante risk that can 
be taken by the Portfolio Manager in the construction of the portfolio. There 
may also be ex ante risk analysis performed in the Security Assessment phase, 
assessing the level of individual risk inherent in a given security (such as 
identifying the level of beta of a stock), but by and large the true ex ante Risk 
Management task is performed by the Portfolio Manager while constructing 
the final portfolio. Hence the visualizations presented here focus on being of 
use to the Portfolio Manager in thinking about the level of ex ante risk suit-
able for the portfolio.

Risk Management    87
Overlap of Holdings
A part of managing risk is understanding exactly where investments are placed 
and sized and how this maps to exposure. Severe overlap of holdings among 
funds or client portfolios creates risk by having too much in a particular invest-
ment; it removes the efficiency gains of diversification and relies on select 
investments to do well for the full portfolio to do well. It should be noted that 
this type of risk can be both to the client—who may have holdings in many 
different funds that overlap and thus is not as diversified as they would like to 
be—and to the firm, where the repeated offerings of products for clients that are 
similar cause a business concentration for the firm. To understand how much 
is invested in a particular security, company, industry, or sector, a report that 
shows the overlap of holdings across funds or portfolios is often conducted. 
Overlap of holdings is a practical tool that illustrates both sides of the invest-
ment; how much does fund A hold of fund B as well as how much does fund B 
hold of fund A. 
Overconcentration of a holding occurs for several reasons. First, market move-
ments change the market value of a holding to push the overlap into a higher 
concentration of redundancy. Second, a specific investment style or time hori-
zon, often set by the client, influences a similar set of underlying securities that 
leads to overlap. Third, because securities are selected based on a range of attri-
butes, it is possible for the same security to be included in different funds with 
different investment styles. Forth, it is not uncommon for the same provider to 
have funds that have significant overlap in holdings. 
Regardless of the overlap reasons, the first step is to be aware of the overlap 
by identifying high concentrations of exposure. This section showcases three 
alternative charts that improve how you identify these high concentrations of 
exposure. To take this first step to identify overlaps, review a typical overlap of 
holdings chart, as shown in Figure 4.17.  
The Holdings Overlap chart is a common tool that often uses a tricolor coding 
system to identify the overlap between funds. As a representation of the fre-
quency of occurrence in which two funds hold the same security, the holdings

overlap percentages are based on market value; orange represents more than 
50% market value, gray represents a 25–50% overlap, whereas blue represents 
less than 25%. By scanning the chart, you can identify the bands of orange 
that flow through the investments. You can also use the color codes to identify 
which funds have the largest overlap by category. Despite this ability to scan, 
there are a number of shortcomings to the chart that lead to misunderstanding 
and visual noise.

Figure 4.17  Frequency Matrix

Risk Management    89
The chart can easily be misunderstood. You could read the chart by first 
tracking the column and then the row. This interpretation would result in 
reading down the column label “Select Value Cap” and looking across the 
row label “Pragmatic Value.” This order would result in an interpretation that 
23% of the market value of the Select Value Cap fund consists of securities 
that can be found in the Pragmatic Value fund. However, this is not the right 
interpretation. If you read across the row labeled “Select Value Cap,” and look 
down the column entitled “Pragmatic Value,” you see the number “52.” This 
means that 52% of the market value of the Select Value Cap fund consists of 
securities that can be found in the Pragmatic Value fund; this is the correct 
interpretation.
The second shortcoming of the chart is the visual noise attributed to the 
cell clutter. Each number within the cells collectively adds clutter to the 
visual. You do not need to be aware, nor can you simultaneously process all 
the numbers listed inside each cell. You can focus only on a few numbers at 
a time. Therefore, the additional numbers add unnecessary clutter to  
the chart. 
Another shortcoming of the chart is how the chart tracks each number. The 
relationship of holdings from fund A to B and likewise fund B to A requires 
diligent tracking. Looking up and using the row and column headers as a coor-
dinate system to map these two relationships are additional steps you are forced 
to take to compare these two numbers. Next, you are required to repeat this 
manual mapping for each additional set of funds, adding more complexity as 
multiple sets are tracked and compared.
Instead, consider an alternative that no longer requires this tracking to occur, 
reduces the visual noise each number creates, and reduces the instructional 
requirements to read the chart. The set of four visualizations shown in Fig-
ures 4.18–4.21 provides an alternative that addresses these points.

Figure 4.18  Butterfly Chart - Closed
Figure 4.18 is structured with the same row and column structure as its 
predecessor (refer to Figure 4.17). However, the tricolor system and numbers 
have been replaced with right-aligned bar graphs that represent the market 
value percentage overlap. The sheer size of the bar illustrates the concentration 
of overlap. Alignment of the market value by the column header suggests a 
comparison that first starts with the column header. By providing focus on the 
column, you start by reading the chart from top to bottom and therefore deduce 
the order of operations to be the funds in column header A are xx% (a certain 
percentage) in row header B. 

Risk Management    91
Figure 4.19 shows you how to review the levels of overlap and readily see over-
laps between A to B as well as B to A. The chart name, Butterfly, reflects the way 
the chart works, which is evident in the figure.

Figure 4.19  Butterfly Chart—Opened
The opened view displayed in Figure 4.19 shows the user controlling the 
chart and actively selecting a column to open and review the contents. As the 
column opens, the contents are revealed in a Butterfly Bar chart pattern. The 
column contents contain expanded bar graphs that provide more detail to the 
overlap between both funds. The technique of using the Butterfly Bar chart 
also includes light vertical lines for comparison as well as two-toned colors to

delineate each percentage overlap. Within this interactive tool you can elect to 
open multiple funds for further comparison. The numbers that represent the 
percentage overlap relationship are shown within each open set of columns and 
map back to the column headers.
As you highlight each row, two numbers are revealed to show the overlap 
relationship. The yellow row highlight serves multiple functions: 1) identifies 
current focus location (in the case of interruption); 2) tracks each row label with 
the visual data; and 3) progressively reveals data details only as you inspect the 
chart closely. You can further organize the chart via sorting, as shown in Fig-
ures 4.20 and 4.21.

Figure 4.21  Butterfly Chart–Opened and Sorted
As shown in Figure 4.20, you can reorder the funds to be listed by descending 
order of market value % overlap. In Figure 4.21, a secondary sort organizes all 
funds to be sorted from left to right and top to bottom by percentage overlap. 
In this case, both the columns and row headers are reordered to reflect the new 
organization. Because the rows and columns are reordered, the group headings 
no longer apply and are removed from the chart. This final view resolves three 
major issues posed at the start: 
▸
▸Manual tracking—How can you eliminate the need to manually track 
each pairing? The Butterfly bars show each set of holdings in a side-by-
side view to eliminate manual tracking and the need to look up each 
holdings pair. 

94    Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
▸
▸Visual noise—How can you reduce the visual noise each number col-
lectively creates within each cell yet still provide this detail information? 
The numbered cells are replaced with bars. Removing numbers from the 
majority of the chart also removes distracting visual noise that impedes 
your ability to focus on a set of holdings. The numbers are present on the 
opened set of holdings. 
▸
▸Instructional directions—How do you improve the instructional require-
ments and equip your audience with a clear understanding of how to read 
the chart? The column headers shift so that the full labels appear only 
within the expanded columns. The instructions are embedded within the 
labels specifically tailored to each column header.
Despite these improvements, the Butterfly chart is missing the tricolor system 
that categorizes each band of holdings into three tiers. The next solution pro-
vides these categorical groups of holdings to reinstate the original three-tier 
system. Figures 4.22 and 4.23 explore this approach with the same data.

The Tiered Scatter Plot transfers the row/column header into an x-axis and 
y-axis coordinate system. The Tiered Scatter Plot is an interactive system that 
enables you to interact with the plot or select a fund from the drop-down list. 
This action highlights the fund location across the scatter plot. In addition, a 
mouse-over state within the scatter plot identifies the fund and displays the two 
percentages of A in B as well as B in A. The orange and blue arcs represent three 
tiers to identify each category threshold. All funds plotted within the orange 
arc are funds that have the highest overlap. All the funds between the blue and 
orange arcs are funds that have moderate overlap, whereas all funds below the 
blue arc represent low overlap percentages.

Figure 4.23  Tiered Scatter Plot—Black
The black background for screen use can be useful in environments in which the 
room lighting is dark and other applications on screen are also presented with black 
backgrounds. For example, if you use multiple screens and have an application like 
Bloomberg (or any other application that uses a black background) you will find it 
easier on your eyes to read the information with a black background across all your 
screens. The human eye can take up to 20–30 minutes to adjust from a dark environ-
ment to a bright environment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(eye)). 
TIP

96    Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
The tiered barriers, in Figures 4.22 and 4.23,  are drawn as arcs to capture 
a nonlinear system of categorization. The categorization of the overlap 
is meant to give you a tool that accurately groups levels of importance 
into tiers. The importance and consequence of the overlap is not simply a 
straight categorization of overlap in holdings that are greater than 50%, as 
indicated in the original Holdings Overlap chart (Figure 4.17). Consider 
the example in which the original fund overlap is categorized within the 
high level of importance of > 50% overlap, whereas Figure 4.22 categorizes 
the same holding within the low range of importance: A fund with an A 
to B overlap of 60% to 5% is in the highest bracket in Figure 4.17, whereas 
Figure 4.22 identifies it to be in the lowest bracket. Why? An overlap that 
shows a high percentage of bidirectional overlap is more noteworthy. If the 
same fund instead landed an A to B overlap of 60% to 60%, then it would be 
placed in the highest bracket. The arc system therefore defines the tiers and 
categorizes the overlaps based on a bidirectional relationship instead of a 
one-directional relationship. 
The benefit of this system is that it provides clearer focus on which funds 
should be closely reviewed. This solution prioritizes high concentrations of 
redundancies and provides a fund look-up feature. The Tiered Scatter Plot 
therefore provides both a mechanism to display and identify detailed data 
results. The display emphasizes the top bracket within the orange arc and 
directs you to first review these highly overlapped funds. The system also 
enables you to identify funds by location or by name. You can look up a fund’s 
location in the chart with the drop-down, or you can select a location and 
identify the name of the fund. 
The next chart, Figure 4.24, introduces yet another way to organize the data so 
that each fund pair is further categorized into more specific intervals.

Figure 4.24  Tiered Histogram
The Tiered Histogram (Figure 4.24) bins intervals of the same data set and color 
codes from the previously established tiers. The x-axis lists the discrete bins to 
track the market value percentage overlap, whereas the y-axis counts the num-
ber of fund pairs that can be categorized in each bin. Each fund pair overlap is 
identified as a circle. The calculation used to categorize each pairing is based 
on the geometric mean such that, the square root of overlap B in A multiplied 
by the overlap of A in B. Consider the fund example of Merit Equity and Merit 

98    Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
Value pairing. The square root of (54 × 42) equals 47.6235, which means that 
the pairing is slotted into the 45–50 bin. The formula creates a balanced system 
that includes both sides of the holdings.  
Similar to the Tiered Scatter Plot (refer to Figures 4.22 and 4.23), the histogram 
solution is interactive. As shown in Figure 4.24, the mouse-over state shows the 
fund pair names and the two corresponding overlap percentages for each rela-
tionship. You can also look up a fund: The Choose Fund drop-down enables you 
to locate a fund in the stacks of circles. 
The benefit of the histogram approach is that it provides more organization 
to the same data set. Histograms show the distribution and categorization 
of data and readily show outliers across the data set. The tricolor system 
reinforces the categories and assigns levels of priority to the visual for you 
to quickly identify which fund pairs require close inspection. As a next step, 
you could provide an ordered list of securities and performance for each pair-
ing to see the impact of these overlaps and further prioritize areas of focus.
Key Take-Aways
The three approaches in this section provide a suite of charts you can 
use depending on preferences and need. The Butterfly chart (Figures 
4.18–4.21) shows the full, sortable list of funds. The Tiered Scatter Plot 
(Figures 4.22 and 4.23) no longer shows the full list of funds but instead 
uses a coordinate system to show the relative location and clustering of 
each fund pair overlap. Here, a bidirectional calculation is also introduced 
to more accurately rank the overlaps into tiers. The Tiered Histogram (Fig-
ure 4.24) capitalizes on the distribution and uses a balanced calculation to 
bin each fund pair with more specificity. Regardless of the chart selected 
to review the data, all three alternative charts provide visual solutions 
that remove calculation efforts, provide more accurate representations of 
the overlap categories, and use positive/negative space to show overlap 
concentrations.

Stress Tests 
Because there is no certainty in risk, prudent techniques like stress tests assess 
risk and model reactions to various financial situations. Stress tests can cover a 
wide range of scenarios including tests based on one or more of the following: 
Historical situations, hypothetical scenarios, singular phenomenon with no 
indication of a repeat, multithreaded events that occur over time and concur-
rently, firm specific changes, and regional or global phenomenon that are 
wide spread. This section examines the stress test results and uses data from 
historical situations. You can assume the data in the test is brought to net pres-
ent value and is relative to the benchmark for direct comparison of the results. 
Putting aside the model selection, calculation of the numbers, and data results, 
review the visual treatment applied to one set of results in a table. Figure 4.25 
shows a table view of stress test results across a set of eight historical scenarios 
for five fund categories. 
The Stress Test data table provides a full listing of how a categorized 
group of funds would react to various scenarios. Each scenario represents 
a significant impactful event like the Lehman Aftermath, and Long Term 
Capital Management (LTCM), the private hedge fund failure of 1998. The 
numerical data entered into each cell represents expected excess one-month 
(non-annualized) returns relative to the benchmark one month after the 
event. The color cells represent two extreme data points: Red results exceed 
negative 2 and blue results exceed a positive 2. The cells that are not colored 
maintain the middle ground range between negative 2 and 2. (any other 
cutoff could be set other than 2%, reflective of the user’s sense of a “large 
market reaction.”)

Despite the color-coded cell technique used to highlight the top range and 
the low ranges, the table still requires you to read the numbers in each cell to 
understand exactly how high is the highest and how low is the lowest. A visual 
approach, as shown in Figure 4.26, can show the same ranges with additional 
data to represent the corresponding market value for each fund.

Figure 4.26  Weighted Bubble Chart

102    Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
Figure 4.26 has the same column header structure as the original table but 
introduces a y-axis with the expected percentage returns. The column headers 
sit on dotted vertical lines to connect the collection of bubbles. Each bubble 
location represents a fund’s excess returns relative to the benchmark 1 month 
after the sample event. The bubbles are layered on top of each other, sometimes 
overlapped based on the corresponding numeric, while the size of each bubble 
represents the market value to illustrate the business value at risk. Overlapping 
and varying sized bubbles require them to be ordered on a z-axis to ensure each 
fund is represented. 
The Weighted Bubble Chart does not require you to review each number to 
understand the spread of potential results. Instead, the replacement of 376 
numbers with different-sized bubbles enables you to see clusters, ranges, and 
estimate quantities above or below the zero mark. 
Although the chart helps to quickly evaluate the results of each test, each 
bubble is somewhat obstructed of the full market amount. Figure 4.27 shows an 
unobstructed view of each fund’s market value results and further rationalizes 
each of the test results.
Figure 4.27 builds on the same structure and benefits of the previous chart 
and fully displays each fund’s market value. Layers are removed, and instead 
the open spaces to the right and left are used to place each fund results. 
The surface space covered by the collection of bubbles becomes the collec-
tive market value indicator. Removing the z-axis simplifies the chart and 
provides more information for you to see both the market value and range of 
returns at once.

In addition, color is introduced to group the results into the same three return 
categories identified in the original Data Table shown in Figure 4.25.
The use of color, bubble arrangement, bubble size, and coordinate system 
improves the chart with the following benefits: 
▸
▸Creates hierarchy—Each stress test results are no longer read indi-
vidually. Instead, the chart can tell the full story of range and market 
value impact. The tricolor system reinforces the results by creating 
three simple categories of performance that are clearly defined and 
organized. 

104    Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
▸
▸Provides visual tracking—The coordinate system, comprised of a simple 
y-axis, provides the framework to improve visual tracking. 
▸
▸Produces attention and focus—Color is often used to highlight and call 
attention to certain areas of a table or chart. In the case of Figure 4.27, 
orange is used as the warning color to attract attention in the table. 
However, the combined strengths of color and size is more powerful and 
attract your attention even further.
Figure 4.28, lets you track a fund across the various stress tests. The chart  
is interactive with the capability to select and identify each fund’s results. 
When you select a fund from the drop-down, the fund name displays and 
the return results are underscored with a bold circle alongside the numeric 
results. 
The benefits of presenting the fund details upon request are two-fold. First, 
you no longer have to read 47 different fund names with the accompanying 376 
numeric results. The chart enables you to study the results first. By removing 
the numeric results and abstracting the fund names, you are provided the big 
picture view of all returns. Second, obtaining the details is flexible and can be 
examined by selecting a bubble to reveal the fund or selecting a fund to reveal 
the results. The context of the big picture view in the background provides a 
relative understanding of a fund’s results.

Key Take-Aways
You can take advantage of these types of stress test results for a variety of 
conversations and scenarios. This chart can scale and extend to a larger 
series of stress tests. The results can guide internal conversations within or 
outside of your group. As a business risk tool, the value at risk stress test 
results can show you the potential impact to firm revenue. Externally, these 
charts provide visual aides to facilitate existing or potential client conversa-
tions. You can share a portfolio’s stress test results at a client meeting and 
provide transparency into their portfolio’s potential performance.  

106    Chapter 4: Portfolio Construction
Summary
This chapter presents a variety of Portfolio Construction data visualizations 
that draw from activities top-down managers employ. These activities include 
determining asset allocations with sector and industry weights before security 
selection represented with visualizations that show current and proposed asset 
allocations of a portfolio, sector leadership, and sector alpha factors. In addition, 
two common risk management techniques, overlap of holdings and stress tests, 
are included as indirect inputs toward Portfolio Construction activities. These 
types of techniques manage firm risk from a business perspective to influence 
Portfolio Construction decisions. They also present clients with rationale for 
amendments and changes in their portfolio(s). 
The visualizations exhibit three types of solutions: singular, multifaceted, and 
varied. A singular solution represents the data with one visualization type 
alone. Examples of this solution include the 3-D Hexagonal Surface Plot used 
for asset allocations and Heatmap Groups used for sector alpha factors. 
The second type of solution is multifaceted, in that the data set is represented 
with one visualization type that can be adjusted in multiple ways to answer 
multiple follow-up questions. An example of this type of visualization is the col-
lection of Bar Track charts that can be arranged in multiple ways including row 
and column orientations that can include or omit corresponding pivot summa-
ries, as shown in Figures 4.7–4.10. For example, the Bar Track charts start with 
a solution that shows which sector is top ranked for each year. The next shows 
which sector has the best returns, across multiple years. 
A third type, the varied solution, represents the same date set with a variety of 
data visualizations. Each of the visualizations can enrich interpretations of the 
data by addressing various related questions. For example, the overlap of hold-
ings data set is represented with three different data visualizations: Butterfly, 
Tiered Scatter Plot, and Tiered Histogram. Each data visualization addresses a 
distinctive aspect of the data set and can be used to make different points. The 
Butterfly chart can be used as a look-up tool that lists each of the holdings pairs, 
whereas the Tiered Histogram shows the distribution of all the pairs. These are 
two different aspects of the same data set that impact how you would use the 
data visualization as a tool.

Tickers, quotes, and watchlists are the three standard communication tools that provide 
us with up-to-the-minute information on the current state of a security or index. With 
various global markets to keep track of, these industry displays focus on just a few data 
points to succinctly report market price. Staff tasked with identifying value in a security 
universe must have continuous access to the current price of any identified security of 
interest, and in most cases, continuous access to the pricing of securities compete for 
the analyst’s attention. Tickers, quotes, and watchlists communicate fundamental infor-
mation to assess the state of an investment as the markets fluctuate.
Today’s displays show ticker, quote, and watchlist data in undifferentiated numeric 
matrices, seas of numbers with neither hierarchy nor helpful highlighting. Staff’s ability 
to monitor and react to such data is compromised in this type of environment. In this 
chapter, we propose expanding the role of such displays from undifferentiated number 
dumps to richer, more effective tools that can increase awareness and allow staff to capi-
talize more rapidly on the information. As consumers of this basic data, we often need 
to act and act quickly. 
This chapter provides out-of-the-gate solutions to improve market monitoring. We take 
a two-fold approach by asking 1) Which data points are important enough to showcase? 
2) How can we represent these data to make them more actionable? We provide alterna-
tive solutions to the ticker, quote, and watchlist and propose a system of information

displays with consistent visual language between them. This chapter follows 
an iterative design approach that illustrates how to make incremental improve-
ments to a visualization. 
All the data in this chapter is hypothetical data and is representative of what is 
provided in the marketplace. While the data in this chapter deal exclusively with 
equities, it should be noted that the visualization recommendations presented 
here can be adapted to other market instruments such as bonds, commodities, 
currencies, and market indices. In addition, the visualizations are designed as 
interactive displays that can be configured and navigated by an end user.
Ticker
The industry has popularized the ticker and investors have become accustomed 
to its traditional design. It is widely and prominently displayed in public places 
such as New York City’s Times Square, it streams across building facades and 
inside of building entrances, and it is affixed to the bottom of most financial 
news channels. While the ticker has maintained its popularity, it has also 
retained the same old design. Partially due to a reduced need for active engage-
ment with the ticker, over the years the industry has become indifferent to the 
design of the tool. You no longer need to watch a ticker display because there 
are more sophisticated ways to obtain the same data using look-up tools such 
as quotes and watchlists. Multiple decades of using and seeing digital ticker 
displays stream across trade floors established a standard that now has more to 
do with its ornamental aspects than with delivering crucial information. 
Although we recognize that the ticker is antiquated, we start with it to show 
how we can make a classic design more relevant in today’s world. Relative to the 
other communication tools in this chapter, the ticker is fundamentally flawed. 
It requires constant monitoring and waiting for desired information to appear. 
Visualization techniques can do only so much to correct its constant motion 
and randomness. Still, the effort to improve the ticker is not pointless since the

lessons learned from redesigning the ticker can be applied to the quote and 
watchlist. The visuals in this section explore how to simplify the data and con-
solidate the display to create a more useful ticker.
This section starts with a review of the Classic Ticker, as shown in Figure 5.1. 
Visualizations that follow show a process of design iterations on the way to its 
final design. We ask questions such as: What elements can be removed? What 
can be replaced or added to make the ticker more efficient, readable, and useful?

Figure 5.1  Ticker—Five Data Points
The Classic Ticker displays each company’s 1) symbols, 2) volume of shares 
traded, 3) current price, 4) increase and decrease in price, and 5) amount. 
These data points do not effectively enable you to compare or react to change. 
Instead, each display requires a quick calculation to know if the change is 
significant or trivial. The constant motion of the ticker introduces more 
complication as you are forced to read and calculate the data quickly. Another 
problem with the ticker design is the use of color. Although the arrow pro-
vides a supporting indicator of price change, the color choice of green and red 
should be adjusted for those individuals with green and red color deficiencies. 
(As stated in Chapter 4, studies have shown that 8% of the male population 
and 0.5% of the female population worldwide cannot distinguish between 
green and red colors.)
To simplify the ticker to the essentials and rectify the color choice we start 
with the following design (Figure 5.2). The streaming ticker alludes to a 
dynamic environment of change. As the information flashes by, the display 
necessitates maximum simplification. However, most tickers list a maxi-
mum of five data points for each security, overloading the brain’s ability to 
quickly assess their meaning. Instead, identifying essential information will 
help ensure that key data points are effectively communicated. The ticker is

Figure 5.2  Ticker—two Data Points
The Simplified Ticker (refer to Figure 5.2) shows a considerably streamlined 
display with only two data points: the security symbol and the percentage 
change in price. As streaming data points, the information can be easily read 
and understood. The chosen hues solve the problem of colorblind traders. A 
comparison between the Classic Ticker and the Simplified Ticker is illustrated 
next in Figure 5.3.

Figure 5.3  Ticker Comparisons
This Ticker Comparison highlights the differences between the original and 
modified ticker. In the same footprint, two becomes three and five becomes 
two: The original display of two securities can now show three securities and 
the five data points are reduced to two data points. Succinct and clear, the 
modified ticker provides more actionable information with the addition of the 
percentage change. 
The percentage change is a key data point to highlight and expand upon within 
relevant contexts. For example, you can couple the percentage change in relative 
terms to the day’s price movement. This would enable you to quickly scan across 
the ticker display to see which securities are at a high or low point for the day.

Figure 5.4  Ball and Hash Marks
Is the current price at the highest or lowest point of today’s price? The vertical gray 
hash marks resemble a perforation line and serve as a scale of the day’s high and 
low spread. The white circle marks the current price relative to the day’s range of 
price movement. The white circle automatically connotes movement similar to 
a bouncing ball that changes directions and heights. As a visual data point, the 
ball communicates a percentage change number and reinforces the correspond-
ing numeric value. The next iteration, as shown in Figure 5.5, incorporates more 
information into the current price point marker with a trailing path.

Figure 5.5  Trailing Ball
The Trailing Ball (refer to Figure 5.5) paints a clearer picture of the day’s secu-
rity price. Is the price shooting up like a rocket with nice gains or falling like a 
star with dust trails? Or as in the third security example PAPE, despite the day’s 
gain, has there been a turn of events to make the price drop? Regardless of the 
percentage gain/loss, the trailing price, like a vector, shows recent directional 
movement. The trail also uses color to show either alignment or dissonance 
between the day’s gains and current directional movement. This small feature 
adds to the richness without increasing the display space. 
As reflections of what has happened during the day, the price stories act as a 
reporting analyst would with a ten-second introduction to the stock’s activity. 
Next, Figure 5.6 presents a variety of different price stories similar to what you 
might hear a news anchor deliver at the closing bell.

Figure 5.6  Trailing Story
How volatile is the security today? How far above or below the open price has the 
current price swayed? The horizontal gray line marks the open price point in 
relation to today’s price range. This one data point provides extra context to the 
current price.
The ticker, as shown in the Trailing Price Story, is now more interesting. You 
can see the day’s performance story for each security—each one with a different 
twist. You no longer have to rely on your memory to recall previous movement 
during the day. The day’s summarized view tracks the day’s movements for you 
in a concise, meaningful way. 
By efficiently using five data points, this version of the ticker can report a simple 
story of today’s price movement. The ticker shows 1) security symbol, 2) percent-
age change, 3) current price point relative to the day’s price movement, 4) direc-
tional movement of the current price, and 5) opening price relative to the day’s 
price movement. The original ticker with five data points is redesigned replacing 
alphanumeric data presentation with visuals that work in unison to tell a better 
story of what has occurred during the day. The focus of the data explains the 
directional change, what’s new and different, or what has not changed. 
To display the current price, Figure 5.7 can incorporate the price as two options: 
a primary and a secondary data point. If you want to focus on the current price 
within the context of price swings during the day, then the top option fits your 
needs. If you would rather focus on the percentage change to monitor large to 
small movements in the market with the price as a side data point, then the 
second option is a more suitable candidate.

A third option is also available. A trader with limit price targets for a set of 
securities will want to know how close the current price is to the limit price. 
This design suggestion is trader specific, requires configuration, and ideally 
integrates with a trading platform that already has the data. Figure 5.8 uses the 
same trailing ball visualization to fulfill this use case.

Figure 5.8  Trailing Ball and Goal Mark
Is the price change moving toward the limit price or away? In Figure 5.8, the blue 
horizontal mark indicates the limit price and the hash marks represent the day’s 
price change. The distance between the blue mark and the day’s price range is 
an indication of the increasing or decreasing gap required to reach the limit 
price. It shows how close the price has gotten to the limit price as an indication 
of what is possible based on the day’s activity.
Figure 5.8 applies color selection differently as well. You may have noticed that 
the color of the current price is the same as the color of the trailing ball color. 
In contrast, the trailing ball color referred to in Figure 5.7 can be different from 
the text color because it indicates the day’s price change. Security PAPE show-
cases these different color usage examples in Figures 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8. 

116    Chapter 5: Trading
You may ask: Why change the color coding, and why not keep the same color 
coding between the two options? Because the purpose of the trailing ball in Fig-
ure 5.8 is to track the direction and distance to the target limit price, the color 
choice reinforces the purpose to use the same color as the current price change. 
Likewise, in Figure 5.7 the color choice reinforces the purpose of the ticker 
option to emphasize the day’s price change. The key lesson is that color selection 
for text and visual elements should reinforce a specific purpose. Although this 
variation in color use may seem like a small detail, it can impact the interpreta-
tion and overall usability of the entire ticker. 
Key Take-Aways
The Classic Ticker (refer to Figure 5.1) relies on numerical information that 
requires a combination of memorization and quick computation to benefit 
from the recorded information. In contrast, the revised iterations (Figures 
5.6, 5.7, and 5.8) rely on visual clues that provide the story of how the price 
has moved. This section suggests alternate ticker designs with the goal of 
removing the need to compute numbers in order to derive meaning. The 
final version provides a visualization that most efficiently communicates 
the story of the day’s price movement. 
Although the movement of the ticker display conveys change, the display of 
the data referred to in Figure 5.1 is static. The typical auto scroll movement 
of the ticker shows the data points in a stagnant textual way. An appeal for 
a continuously changing display is somewhat ingrained in our minds from 
decades of seeing the Classic Ticker display (refer to Figure 5.1). The display 
shown in the Trailing Story (refer to Figure 5.6) reinforces the idea of con-
tinuous change with visual elements that convey change. The display shows 
the dynamic change in price, not with the motion of the ticker, but with the 
trailing price point reminiscent of a bouncing ball.
Like many newly designed interfaces, the new ticker may take some time 
to learn. However, the learning curve is not too steep and perhaps worth 
the benefits of rich price stories associated with each ticker. The display 
provides more reasons to be drawn into a performance change with 
insights to take action or investigate further.

Quote
Quotes vary in the amount of data they display. Some show as few as half a dozen 
data points; others show dozens and are accompanied with basic line charts that 
track performance. To improve the effectiveness of a quote we must answer: 
What can be done to clarify the quote across varying sets of data points? Improv-
ing its display goes beyond replacing text with graphics. It is also about creating a 
tool that quickly yet accurately informs its audience. 
This section suggests various sizes in which to package and display our quote: A 
small graphic can show the basic quote, a medium one adds commonly sought-
after data points, and a large one provides an extended fundamental and techni-
cal listing. This section provides a step-by-step approach to redesigning the 
quote. Each iteration improves upon the last with a rationale provided for each 
design choice. To start, let’s review typical data displays for a small, medium, 
and large quote. As shown in Figures 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11, the quote data is listed 
and organized in simple textual displays.

Figure 5.10  Quote—18 Data Points 
The small quote (Figure 5.9) is akin to data within the ticker and provides the 
most recent pricing information. The only graphical elements are colored text 
and an arrow that indicates an increase or decrease in the price.
Incorporating more data points into the medium-sized quote (refer to Fig-
ure 5.10) expands the display size and creates a more complete picture with the 
addition of a sparkline. 
Sparklines are used to illustrate trends using small embedded line graphs that 
typically do not include axes, coordinates, or labels. As noted by the definition, 
most sparklines do not include details. 
Despite the small area, details can be added to the sparkline to help you extract 
more information: The high and low point of the price are emphasized with a 
blue and red circle, respectively, the current price is emphasized with a black

vide more context to the sparkline and help you see the salient data points. 
The large-sized quote (Figure 5.11) is an example of how the display can grow 
both vertically and horizontal and continue to fit the extended data sets. The 
value/field pairing is repetitive and can be easily overlooked. To understand the 
significance of one value, it has to be reviewed in context of other values that 
are often not present in the quote data. In some cases, you may be very familiar 
with a security and will have deep knowledge of its performance, whereas in 
other cases you may not have the historical context of the price movements. 
The goal of introducing relative data points is to level the playing field and pro-
vide the knowledge of greater context. The relative data points can include the 
following:
▸
▸The relative performance across different time periods—How does the 
current performance compare against a month or year time period? What 
is the significance of the price range for the year?

current change, and industry-wide performance provide relative contexts for 
each quote. The next visualization (Figure 5.12) addresses the aspects of his-
torical change and introduces a 1-year, 1-month, 1-day perspective into

Figure 5.12  Quote—Nested Time Bars
Each performance view is connected to the next by keeping and layering the 
day’s spread. The black triangle points out the current price in all displays, 
whereas the gray triangle shows the open price. The teal color across the quote 
shows the positive day change, the black indicates today’s price spread, whereas 
the light gray bar corresponds to the timeframe’s spread. This type of historical 
connection shows you the current price point and current day’s movement in 
relative terms to the month and year. The significance of the day’s change is put 
into multiple time-based perspectives. 
Perspective is also introduced with averages. Averages are shown in the quote 
with a dashed line to mark average volume and various industry averages for 
all others that apply. The revised quote (refer to Figure 5.12) uses graphical 
elements that support historical and industry-based perspectives to show the 
significance of a value. 
Another method of showing context is connecting the current price in relative 
terms to time intervals. Figure 5.13 provides the relative perspective of time by 
percentage change.

Figure 5.13  Quote—Discrete Time Bars
As a discrete interval, a day, month, or year is a defined time frame in which 
gains and losses can be tracked. Figure 5.13 shows a contextual connection to 
the historical data by displaying the percentage change mapped to full period 
spreads. Is the stock up or down for the day, month, or year? And by how much? 
And how does that compare to the spread for that time period? The perspective 
of the display shows that today’s price is down for the month by 1.23% but sig-
nificantly up, by 12.98%, for the 52-week change. 
The same data display can be organized differently to fit different space and size 
requirements. For example, Figure 5.14 adopts a linear row layout.
The linear form factor shown in Figure 5.14 allows multiple quotes to be stacked 
and added to a collection of quotes. This is accomplished by keeping the key 
text values. Additionally, market fluctuations can be communicated with more 
than just the changing numbers of a data screen. Figure 5.15 introduces a new 
marker to track the change in price and emphasize the dynamic nature of the 
stock’s change in price.

Figure 5.15  Horizontal Contrail 
Similar to an aircraft with vapor trails, the performance change markers are 
attached to trails that show directional movement for each spread. The black 
circle end of the trail marks the current state, whereas the color tail-end marks 
the value at the beginning of the set period. Across the quote, color is consis-
tently applied to indicate an increase or decrease in value. You can scan the 
display and see that the Div & Yield % has increased, whereas the P/E ratio has 
decreased over the past quarter.
By organizing the orientation of the display from left to right or top to bottom, 
you can produce results that impact not just the quote layout but also the infer-
ences of the data. The next visualization changes the orientation of the contrail 
display. Figure 5.16 connects your verbal language associations of the terms up 
and down with your visual associations of how those terms should be shown.

Quote    125
The vertical orientation of the quote (refer to Figure 5.16) illustrates what is 
up and what is down in a visually intuitive way. You can track the black circle 
across the indicators and see what is above or below average and by how much. 
A combination of technical and fundamental indicators is incorporated into the 
display. By creating a simple representation of the data’s dynamic nature, the 
display opens the possibility of including technical indicators that otherwise 
are typically shown as separate charts. This version of the quote benefits from 
exploring 1) How should historical and industry context be shown? 2) How 
should changes across indicators be shown? 3) How can you connect verbal and 
visual language associations? 4) How should numeric values be incorporated into 
the visualization?

Figure 5.16  Vertical Contrail
Key Take-Aways
This section provides a step-by-step approach to the redesign of the quote 
to provide a cohesive solution that can apply to varying-sized quotes with 
different data points. At the start, three varying sizes of quotes are pre-
sented, each of which contain different amounts and types of data points. 
The uniting factor within each quote indicator is the continuous change in 
value. This section evolves the contrail marker as the uniting visual element 
that shows the continuous change across all indicators.

Watchlist    127
Watchlist
Most watchlists are tables of data with lists of values organized into columns. If 
a security is worth watching, chances are you are tracking it in your watchlist. 
Since the point of a watchlist is to monitor and be well informed on key indica-
tors for a security, the displays have to be at once comprehensive and pointed to 
show significant changes. This section continues from the previous section by 
using many of the same visual elements from the quote to help you answer: How 
can you display the security data for easy comparison? How can you display a 
large amount of watchlist data within a single view? Our intent is twofold: 1) to 
make it easier to analyze one security in the context of many and 2) to provide a 
birds-eye view across the collection. 
Similar to both the ticker and the quote, this section provides an evolutionary 
redesign of the watchlist with several iterations to explain the process. First, 
Figure 5.17 illustrates a typical watchlist populated with just a few stocks to 
present the sample data.

Figure 5.17  Watchlist Data Table
Next, Figure 5.18 repurposes the Horizontal Contrail Quote (refer to Figure 5.15) 
by stacking the quote to create the watchlist. Since a typical watchlist has the 
capability to show leaders and laggers, Figure 5.18 organizes the display to focus 
on the change %. By aligning the visual display to the opening price across both 
the Day Change and 52W Change columns, you can create a leader or lagger list 
either by sorting the short-term returns for the day or the longer-term returns 
for the year.

Although Figure 5.18 enables easy comparison of leaders and laggers, the day’s 
price spread is missing. Hence, Figure 5.19 adjusts the display to include the 
day’s spread.

130    Chapter 5: Trading
Watchlist – Period Change with Spread (refer to Figure 5.19) shows you the rela-
tive nature of a day change and how that relates to the year. By incorporating 
the period spread into a dark gray background, the Day Change and 52 Week 
Change columns include the volatility for each stock.
Watchlist - Period Change with Spread and Recent Changes visually addresses 
the need to see recent changes within the hour across the indicators. The abil-
ity to select a specific “Change” timeframe is provided at the bottom of each 
column. Did the Ask/Bid spread % increase or decrease and by how much? In 
addition to the price change, introducing the trail markers to the Volume and 
Ask/Bid columns provide immediate perspective on liquidity. For longer time 
horizon changes of P/E, Dividends, Yield, and Beta, the trail markers show 
trends in the fundamentals. The trail markers concisely provide more informa-
tion to the visual display. For example, the inclusion of movement and direction 
provides a simplified assessment of the current price point dynamics within the 
Bollinger bands channel.
What is the Dividend Yield spread across my watchlist? And how does it com-
pare to the industry average? The dot plot (shown in Figure 5.20) is added to the 
top of each column to provide a condensed view of what’s below. The dot plot 
display presents the full data collection vertically sorted by value with markers 
colored according to the direction of the period change. Below the dot plot is 
the stock list of dividend and yield values, each listed within their own row as 
color dots.
The current selection of 3.9% is one of the few in the watchlist that has made it 
beyond the 2.3% industry average marker. The ability to make this connection 
and others like it provide many benefits: 
▸
▸Concise—Tracks the same watchlist in a fraction of the space.
▸
▸Range context—Displays the distribution of the watchlist items.
▸
▸Placement context—The highlighted dot is shown within the sequential 
order of all the rest.

The column summary not only provides a perspective of the column contents 
but it also highlights the selected stock across the indicators. For example, 
Figure 5.21 shows a 52-week gain paired with a high Beta rating. The column 
summaries are interesting to see, and as an interactive system, you can query 
the display to see the relative placements across other securities. Actually, 
the more you review the column summary, the more you realize how your 
attention gravitates toward the top and dissipates from reviewing the column

tents lessens your need to closely review the detail column data. The sheer 
list of data points across all columns can become overwhelming even in an 
organized visual display. You could argue that displaying all the columns 
overloads the display with too much information. Although the display is 
largely visual and easier to track trends and outliers, the details of each col-
umn divide your focus.

Figure 5.22  Vertical Contrail with Dot Plot Summary – Alignment by Change

Watchlist    135
Figure 5.22 resolves the issue of competing attention by constraining the rep-
resentation of the remaining seven data dimensions to a collection of concise 
column summary views. The visualization shows the summary results across 
all indicators but provides focus to only one. Removing the column details 
improves the display and provides the space to include other details to aug-
ment the focus. 
With a larger summary display, you can layer in the values connected to each 
indicator and compare those values against the benchmark. These additions add 
to the flexibility of the display to see more and do more with the data. You can 
see more securities and compare those securities against a list of benchmarks. 
You might have noticed the display includes twice the amount of securities 
when compared to the previous watchlist. The previous watchlist contained 24 
securities, whereas this version’s vertical layout compactly lists 48. 
This iteration connects the summary and detail data, and as an interactive dis-
play, it provides the option to navigate the data by selecting from the indicators 
or the stock list. Visual techniques show the connections between the detail 
and summary level data: The highlighted ticker, bold stock name, black fill, and 
line gray connectors work together to improve the legibility, selection, and con-
nection between the displays. 
The next two figures use the same display and examine a different alignment. 
The detailed data display shown in Figure 5.23 is organized to align the day’s 
spread against the zero line. Even without resetting the sort order, the view 
shows the variability of the day’s price across the watchlist.

Figure 5.24  Detail Contrail versus Summary Dot Plot
To understand this iteration of the watchlist, Figure 5.24 presents the detail 
and summary view of the P/E ratio. The detail view on the left is akin to a 
zoomed-in version of the summary view on the right. Aside from the stock list, 
the detail view (visual on the left) provides the contrail and associated numeric 
values. Otherwise, the two views represent the same numeric values and visual 
perspective of the data. The similarity in the display and overlap in the data sets 
makes one view redundant and is not required in the display. For this reason, 
when the detail view is introduced, the interactive display removes the sum-
mary view to eliminate duplication. 
Key Take-Aways
Our goals in redesigning the watchlist were to allow analysis of a stock within 
the context of a collection, and to provide an aerial view of all the securities in 
that watchlist. Our new watchlist design meets these goals and amends a few 
others, providing various types of context. The range and distribution of val-
ues in an ordered list, the placement of each stock within this range, and the 

138    Chapter 5: Trading
performance of each stock in the list offer relative contexts to the watchlist 
group. However, the watchlist also provides context outside the group with 
industry, sector, index, and watchlist benchmark comparison. It also provides 
the context of time: A contrail shows recent changes across all the indicators. 
Our new watchlist is both more concise and consistent. It provides various 
forms of context with aerial summary views of the indicators and doubles 
the list of stocks in the watchlist. It adheres consistently to our previously 
established visual elements of the ticker and quote by applying the contrail 
to the watchlist.  
Visual System: Ticker, Quote, and Watchlist
Concise, information-rich displays can help you monitor and assess price 
movements, leading indicators, or comparative placement. The key purpose 
of the ticker, the quote, and the watchlist is to stay informed about changes in 
key performance indicators. For this reason, the solutions show change, com-
municate quickly, and work across different tools. The vertical contrail is the 
visual element that effectively communicates change and unites these three 
tools together. By encapsulating the following questions, the contrail element 
compactly and accurately communicates:
▸
▸Where are we now? The dot (either white, black, or colored-in) indicates 
the current value. Purposefully set to the highest contrast, the current 
value is meant to stand out in the foreground.
▸
▸Where were we earlier? The color tail of blue or orange shows the recent 
increase or decrease. As a fading tail, the end point of the color tail is 
meant to differentiate between the most recent changes in a darker color 
to least recent in a lighter color. 
▸
▸How quickly are we changing? The length of the trail in the quote and 
watchlist indicates either a quick change with a long trail or slow change 
with a short trail.
The final set of the redesigned ticker, quote, and watchlist is shown in Figure 5.25.

Summary
Tickers, quotes, and watchlists are some of the most widely used yet unchanged 
set of tools in the industry. These heavily text-based tools can be improved upon 
by asking, 1) Which data points are interesting to showcase? 2) How should you 
represent this data to make it actionable? This chapter provides new versions 
of each tool by answering those two questions and iterating through various 
designs. With each iteration we give you the thought process behind its design 
decisions to reveal how the final versions are derived. 
Our final versions of the ticker, quote, and watchlist share a uniting visual ele-
ment that makes the three tools relatable to each other. As the key visualization, 
the contrail is incorporated into the final version of each tool.

Although each tool has been redesigned separately, the underlying purpose, to 
show a change in price, unites all the visualizations. Therefore, each of the tools 
can be used either independently or together as a complementary system that 
supports your trading tasks. As you become more accustomed to the contrail, 
you’ll rely on it to monitor securities. You can extend the application of the 
contrail and integrate it into other trading tools such as the trade ticket or trade 
alerts.

Performance Measurement6
A key part of the Investment Process involves tracking and analyzing the overall 
investment performance of a portfolio—both in absolute terms and also relative to the 
fluctuations of the broader markets. A thorough analysis of market and portfolio perfor-
mance can teach members of the investment firm important lessons that, as a feedback 
loop, can be used to update both the Security Assessment and the Portfolio Construc-
tion work that has come before. For example, performance attribution can give insights 
to the sources of the returns and the risks that have been experienced. If the reality 
experienced by the portfolio ex post does not conform to the estimates calculated on an 
ex ante basis, changes, updates, and reallocations to the portfolio might be in order.
The visualization examples in this chapter are designed for multiple audiences—those 
who monitor, conduct, and present the measurement and analysis of investment perfor-
mance. Analyst teams, independent of the investment function, typically perform these 
types of Performance Measurement and Analysis. Teams in the investment firm’s back 
office, usually calculate Performance Measurements, whereas the firm’s middle office 
typically conducts Performance Analysis—that is, Performance Attribution. Although 
those in the back and middle offices conduct the analysis, those in the front office (i.e., 
portfolio managers) and the firm’s clients make the actual investment decisions. They 
use the output of Performance Analysis in the form of reports and presentation materi-
als. This chapter spans the front, middle, and back office functions of Performance 
Measurement and Analysis to benefit all parties, including clients, with improved 
visualizations.

144    Chapter 6: Performance Measurement
This chapter offers reviews for three forms of Performance Measurement and 
Analysis data. First, we look at direct observations of market performance and 
their impact on an investment firm’s funds and its portfolio managers’ set of 
portfolios. Our analysis of Performance Measurements shows how to apply the 
same visualization techniques to charts targeted to three different audiences. 
Second, we discuss profit and loss as revealed in a portfolio statement and a 
firm composite. For the firm composite, the standards set by Global Investment 
Performance Standards (GIPS) are assumed to have been reviewed and followed 
by the investment firm. Third, we see how the performance of both markets and 
the portfolio over time can be broken out into individual contributory factors of 
Attribution. These ex post data results can then be compared to ex ante return 
and risk assumptions made by the investment firm. We end the chapter with a 
review of performance and risk attribution to reflect upon how to display the 
priority of changes and updates that may be in order.
All the data in this chapter is hypothetical data and is representative of what is 
provided in the marketplace. 
Market Performance
How is the market performing right now? Which sectors are doing well? How are 
the influential large cap securities performing? Martin Wattenberg, an Ameri-
can artist and scientist who creates visual explorations of culturally significant 
data, designed and introduced the Map of the Market in 1999 to provide a holis-
tic answer to the question “How is the market doing?” His visualization became 
a well-regarded method to stay informed about the market throughout the day. 
The Map of the Market (Figure 6.1) introduced heatmaps and treemaps as new 
chart types and influenced others to use these innovative techniques. Treemaps 
present a hierarchy of nested data in rectangles and are often paired with heat-
maps that use color to denote another quantitative variable. 
NOTE

Figure 6.1  Heat and Tree Map
The Map of the Market is a representation of the current performance of 
publicly traded companies in one chart, usually a set of companies that are 
contained in a given index of the market. Each company is represented as a 
rectangle. The size of the rectangle corresponds to market capitalization, and its 
color indicates gains or losses in the price since the previous market close: Red 
indicates a drop in the price, and green an increase.
Wattenberg’s insight in creating The Map of the Market was to adapt an older 
visualization first introduced by Ben Shneiderman, an American computer 
scientist and professor at the Human Computer Interaction Lab at the Univer-
sity of Maryland College Park. His treemap technique displayed hierarchy in 
the form of nested rectangles. The treemap, in combination with Wattenberg’s 

146    Chapter 6: Performance Measurement
heatmap, rapidly direct the user’s attention toward areas of significant change. 
The Map of the Market is a powerful way to see the performance of the entire 
market. Despite these benefits, the chart has a few shortcomings. To better 
assess market performance, the data can be presented in a more structured way.
The next set of charts displays the same market data and further organizes 
how the data are presented. Similar to the Map of the Market, these charts are 
purely visual and omit numeric values. They can be augmented with a display 
panel that lists values of selected holdings. 
The Marimekko Chart in Figure 6.2 represents similar data to the Map of the 
Market, but it represents sectors as columns and companies as horizontal slices 
within each column. A Marimekko chart is a stacked bar chart used to repre-
sent two variables that are illustrated as the height and width of each bar. In 
Figure 6.2, the size of each slice corresponds to the market capitalization of the 
company it represents, with the best performing companies listed at the top and 
the worst at the bottom. As shown in the legend, this creates a gradient ranging 
from white to yellow to orange, indicating positive, neutral, and negative perfor-
mance, respectively. 
Within a market, you can also assess which sectors are experiencing gains and 
which are experiencing losses. The gradients are scaled to provide you with 
an overall sense of market performance and show if there are more gains than 
losses or if a day is mixed. Color gradient changes and gravitate more of your 
attention toward those sectors that are experiencing losses. Because the chart is 
organized vertically, side-by-side comparisons can be more direct. For example, 
Figure 6.2 shows contrasting gains and losses with gains in the financial sector 
and heavy losses in the technology sector. 
You can apply a similar approach to visually represent assets under manage-
ment of an investment firm’s managed funds, or to separately managed port-
folios. Next, Figure 6.3 applies a similar visualization method to show how an 
investment firm can monitor how their funds are performing.

Market Performance    149
The Firm Performance chart in Figure 6.3 shows how the investment manage-
ment firm’s funds are performing within a specified time frame. It applies a 
similar chart structure as Figure 6.2, but to market cap categories. In addition, 
the Firm Performance chart uses unique specification details. First, it uses a 
different color scheme to draw your attention toward the centered zero marker. 
The darkest gradient at the zero mark helps to split each column into its own 
negative and positive performance ranges. Just by tracking the zero marker 
across the categories you can see which category of funds produce more gains 
than losses. Second, the width of each fund category represents the relative per-
centage of total assets. Third, the height of each fund rectangle represents the 
relative assets under management within the firm. 
Next, the Marimekko chart in Figure 6.4 applies slightly different specification 
details to review performance across many portfolios. The Marimekko Chart – 
Polychromatic Gradient applies the same visual methods as the previous two 
charts and only alters 1) the category groups to reflect the underlying data; and 
2) the color scheme to closely track changes in performance. Using multiple 
gradients of color creates a highly differentiated color mapped scale which can 
reveal more specific percentage changes through color alone. Although our 
chart introduces more color bands, it purposefully limits the bands to three 
colors (including white) that are blended one to the next. Introducing too many 
colors into the scale would make it more difficult to decode which color was 
mapped to which value on the scale. (For more guidance on color use see Chap-
ter 11, which discusses design principles.)
Key Take-Aways
The Marimekko Chart solution provides visual techniques to display perfor-
mance status across investments that are categorized either by sectors in 
the market, funds at an investment management firm, or by separate client 
portfolios managed by investment managers. Performance, relative size of 
asset categories, and quantities of assets in a side-by-side layout provide a 
good way to compare all three.

The color scale you use directly impacts the details you would like to commu-
nicate. Although our examples apply certain gradients to certain types of data 
sets, these assigned gradients are not intended to be prescriptive. Depending on 
the color scale you select, you can emphasize different data points in the scale 
and distinguish performance changes. Table 6.1 lists color scheme options that 
can help you make a color scale selection.

Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) set global guidelines for mea-
suring, calculating, and reporting performance data. The established standards 
allow for a direct comparison of performance regardless of region or country 
and follow the guiding principle of providing full disclosure and fair representa-
tion. For detailed information about GIPS, visit http://www.gipsstandards.org/.

A composite as defined by the GIPS handbook is “an aggregation of one or more 
portfolios into a single group that represents a particular investment objective 
or strategy.” One key portion of the GIPS standards applies to composites. It 
enables you to investigate a firm’s performance track record or compare one 
firm’s performance gains over another firm. Because the standards are set at a 
global level, U.S. and non-U.S. firms that are GIPS-compliant can be compared 
and evaluated equally, on a level playing field. The data used in this section 
represents a sample investment firm’s composite and applies the following defi-
nitions as defined by GIPS: 
▸
▸Composite Gross Return (%)—The total rate of return of an investment 
before the deduction of any fees or expenses associated with the underly-
ing investment expenses, management fees (transaction expenses and 
administrative expenses), and carried interest. 
▸
▸Composite Net Return (%)—The total rate of return of an investment 
that reflects the deduction of all underlying fees and expenses, including 
management fees (transaction expenses and administrative expenses), 
performance fees, and accrued carried interest.
▸
▸Custom Benchmark Return—The total rate of return results taken from 
published sources on the relevant reference. 
▸
▸Composite 36 Month St Dev (%)—The 3-year annualized standard 
deviation measures the variability of the composite ex post.
▸
▸Benchmark 36 Month St Dev (%)—The 3-year annualized standard 
deviation measures the variability of the selected benchmark ex post.
▸
▸Number of Portfolios in the Composite—The number of portfolios 
managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strat-
egy and or type (for example, segregated or pooled, taxable versus tax 
exempt). The minimum portfolio size for inclusion in the composite is 
disclosed in the presentation notes that must be provided with the com-
posite, as per GIPS. 
▸
▸Internal Dispersion (%)—A measure of the spread of the annual returns 
of individual portfolios within a composite.

Figure 6.5  GIPS Data Table
Because it’s a simple table, deriving the information from it may seem simple 
as well. There are only ten years of data and seven columns: 70 data points is 
not a lot—or is it? Within one composite, you can track whether the composite 
produced positive or negative returns—both gross and net—and compare those 
returns to the benchmark. 
Instead, consider reviewing the data to observe the firm’s performance trends. 
The Firm Composite Interlocking Blocks, Figure 6.6, replaces the table text 
values with a variation of a bar chart. 
Under GIPS standards, the proposed visualization may supplement but not 
replace the data table in presentations to clients or prospective clients. Internal 
communications are under no such obligations.

Imagine Figure 6.6 is your internal standard to display composite data. Immedi-
ately, data definition standards paired with visualization standards provides you 
with a better way to quickly compare composites. Stacking up and comparing 
one block composite to another becomes more direct. You can identify and see: 
▸
▸The net returns above the benchmark 
▸
▸How those returns relate to the standard deviation 
▸
▸How risk exposure has evolved over the years

The blocks, marked at the 1% and 5% interval, are filled in a neutral light shade of 
blue and are shaped with Lego-like profile cutouts showing the difference between 
gross and net returns. The first column consolidates three data sets: Gross Return, 
Net Return, and Benchmark Return. The benchmark dotted line tracks excess 
and shortage in the first column, while the second column visually presents these 
variations across the years with cutouts that provide a direction comparison. For 
example, the second column tracks the offset from the benchmark and shows 
that 2002 and 2003 produced greater returns relative to the benchmark, whereas 
2004–2007 produced lower returns relative to the benchmark.

The Standard Deviation columns use similar but simplified visualization 
methods as the Returns columns. A side-by-side view of columns 2 and 3 make 
it easier to compare the risk and reward results. A few additional and notable 
techniques include:
▸
▸Column structure—A category and subcategory column pairing cre-
ates hierarchy and visual structure. Reading seven columns versus three 
simplifies and improves comprehension. Grouping data columns that 
contain related data sets improves comparison. Combining these related 
data sets into one chart column enables you to see the relationships.
▸
▸Integrated legends—The proximity of the legend to the visual element 
can impact how easy or difficult it is to understand the chart. The closer 
the legend is connected to the implementation, the easier it is for you to 
make a visual connection to ultimately identify and use. A legend that is 
connected to subheaders lessens the decoding required to understand 
each visual element. 
▸
▸Connected scales—Each chart column is associated with a scale located 
at the bottom of the chart that is centered on the zero line. This zero line 
is used as the anchor point to make the chart easier to reference both 
within and across various chart columns. 
▸
▸Color highlights—Color is used to emphasize different aspects of the 
data. Light gray and light blue are used to explain the results, and the 
blue/red combo is used to show the results. Reserving color to highlight 
key data helps direct your attention. 
The use of column structure, integrated legends, connected scales, and color 
highlights are visualization techniques that when combined can make your 
charts more effective. 
Key Take-Aways
The firm’s composite data aims to answer how well a firm’s investment 
strategy has performed. Standards, such as GIPS, create common data 
structure and measurement methods to facilitate comparisons. They 

Portfolio Gain/Loss    157
enable you to investigate a firm’s performance track record and compare 
one firm’s performance gains over another’s. Figure 6.6 extends the fair 
representation principle to a visual solution that adheres to standards that 
improve understanding. 
Portfolio Gain/Loss
The data behind gain/loss performance reporting contain valuable bits of infor-
mation that, however important, present challenges to the individual tasked 
with representing them clearly. Contributions, redemptions, market value 
additions and subtractions, realized gain versus unrealized gain, realized versus 
unrealized loss, and paid dividends are some of the main aspects of the data 
that require tracking. The Portfolio Gain/Loss (G/L) Table (Figure 6.7) shows a 
representative data set of total gain/loss data generated from a sample portfolio.
The Portfolio G/L Table tracks dividends collected, realized and unrealized gain/
loss, and total gain/loss for 57 securities. The unrealized data track the paper 
profits or losses on open positions, while the realized data show closed posi-
tions’ gains or losses based on the sale price minus the purchase price. Sorted in 
descending order, the Total Gain/Loss column prioritizes the list as the simple 
addition of the dividends and realized and unrealized gains and losses. 
The next set of charts represents the same data set displayed as distinctly 
arranged bar charts. Both charts are valid solutions and can be used according 
to the level of detail you would like to show. One chart presents the summary 
level data in a horizontal layout; the other presents summary and detail data in 
a vertical layout. Figure 6.8 presents the former.
The Portfolio G/L Summary chart consolidates the long list of securities into a 
condensed bar chart. The rows list aggregate dividends, gains, losses, subtotals, 
and totals, while the columns split the data into bars that represent realized and 
unrealized gains and losses. Centered along the zero line, each section within 
each bar represents a corresponding dollar amount. Color, then, reinforces the 
impact of both realized and unrealized losses.

Figure 6.8  Segmented Butterfly
The chart represents all 57 securities in one compact graphic. At a glance, you 
can compare realized and unrealized gains and losses with the relative size of 
each security’s gain/loss represented as a segment in each bar. Although this 
summary view displays no details, the next solution does. Figure 6.9 not only 
provides both a summary and detail view, but in addition, it rearranges the lay-
out to make it easier to connect the summary with details.
In this version, the columns list unrealized, realized, and dividends data as 
stacked blocks while the rows list the numeric values for gains, losses, subtotal, 
and total. The color blue is used to show gains while red bars and text is used to 
show losses. You can interact with the chart to highlight the unrealized, real-
ized, and dividends across the chart while simultaneously displaying the detail 
security data.
Many reports and interactive systems combine summary and detail views. 
Figure 6.9 illustrates an interactive system that provides details on demand. 
Within the first view, the system shows high-level data patterns that provide 
context to your questions without extraneous detail. Selecting or momentarily 
rolling over certain areas of the chart with your cursor can provide those details 
and fold them back when you’re through. This organization of data allows for 
just in time (JIT) data delivery, which increases efficiency and decreases visual 
waste by providing the data only when needed. To successfully apply this 
approach, understand that the goals and various use cases for your audience 
need to be closely considered and evaluated.

Key Take-Aways
The dynamic nature of portfolio gain and loss data can make it difficult to 
understand how they impact the aggregate totals of a portfolio’s perfor-
mance. Although your firm’s systems may do a good job at tracking the 
numbers, it may still be difficult for you or your audience to see how data 
sets contribute to subtotals and totals. 
The visualization solutions in this section show the impact of charting 
accumulated values while providing links between an investment’s indi-
vidual dividend payments and realized and unrealized gains and losses. 
The results provide aggregates and the ability to review a slice of the linked 
data with specifics that explain and identify an investment in greater detail. 
The JIT (just in time) display of the details makes it possible to review the 
subtotal and totals with no abstraction and then explore the investment 
specifics as a second step. Both Figures 6.8 and 6.9 can incorporate a 
details panel listing to display specific values. 
Attribution
It is well known that investment professionals debate the proper way to calculate 
and present both Return and Risk Attribution, leaving these issues still lacking 
in consensus. Some of the debate centers around identifying which underlying 
factors influence the active returns (or) risk. Other debates turn on more arcane 
aspects of how certain attribution analyses should be properly aggregated across 
portfolios or over time. In any event, we have chosen certain accepted method-
ologies in order to illustrate our visualizations. We neither support nor are we 
ideologically tied to a selected industry methodology. Instead, we have chosen  
examples based on wide distribution and common practices. You may subscribe 
to different attribution methodologies and models. If that’s the case, you may still 
be able to apply the principles and techniques we offer for visualizing your data. 
Return Attribution
Return Attribution data sets focus on the level of periodic investment returns 
of a portfolio, usually relative to the level of periodic investment returns of 

162    Chapter 6: Performance Measurement
a stipulated benchmark, to explain the impact of the portfolio management 
investment decisions. This section reviews quarterly sector weighting and 
security selection effects based on a portfolio’s quarterly returns to attribute 
these two investment decisions. 
The report methodology follows the Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (BHB) princi-
ples published in 1986. A key part of the methodology includes a quadrant table 
framework referred to as The Simplified Framework for Return Accountability. 
The BHB principles are published in “Determinants of Portfolio Performance” by 
Gary P. Brinson, L Randolph Hood, and Gilbert L. Beebower, in Financial Analyst 
Journal, July–August 1986, pp.39–44.
This section expands on the quadrant table introduced by BHB to display return 
attribution data. A series of tables and schematic diagrams are used to visually 
explain revised charts. Step by step, each figure shows how the final visualiza-
tion is derived. To start, Figure 6.10 illustrates the original BHB framework and 
shows how it is applied to a sample report.

Figure 6.10  Quadrant Table
NOTE

Attribution    163
The Quadrant Table displays sector weights and returns with the x-axis dedi-
cated to returns and the y-axis to sector weights. The quadrants that result 
in positive effects are filled in blue and the negative effect results are shown 
in yellow. Although the data seems simple and the quadrant approach seems 
straightforward, it can be tough to see the weight impact, rank the investment 
choices, see how good or bad those investment decisions are, or identify areas 
to learn from and adjust. Figure 6.11 uses the quadrant framework but improves 
upon the weighted impact in each sector.

Figure 6.11  Weighted Bubbles
The size of the bubbles within the quadrants correlates to the effect value. You 
can see that IT has the greatest impact with a negative effect of –55.9bps, while 
the Financial sector has the smallest impact of –1.1bps. The weighted bubbles 

164    Chapter 6: Performance Measurement
further inform you of the size and impact of certain investment choices. How-
ever, the rank order of the effect value is still difficult to grasp. Comparing the 
circle size and assessing which one is larger than another is even more difficult 
to do when the sizes are relatively close to one another.
To further improve this visualization, the next visual maintains the framework 
principles but reconstructs the underlying grid. A hyperbola in which y=k/x 
such that k is the value of the sector effect, x remains the returns, and y is the 
relative weights constructs the new grid. This new grid can make it easier to 
detect if the attribution results are comparable and within the same effect track. 
Although the table can list the calculated effect values, Figure 6.12 provides a 
coordinate system that shows you the location of each effect value.

Figure 6.12  Hyperbolic Quadrants

Attribution    165
Applying a hyperbolic grid to the quadrants is useful because it shows you the 
coordinate value of effect in bps. You don’t have to rely on the size of the bubble 
or the quadrant coordinates; instead you can simply reference the effect track. 
For example, you can see that both Energy and Materials are within the same 
10–20 bps effects track. 
The next iteration, as shown in Figure 6.13, presents the hyperbolic quadrant 
with a gradient to make the tracks more visible.

Figure 6.13  Hyperbolic Quadrants with Gradient

166    Chapter 6: Performance Measurement
To complement the values, a color-fill gradient highlights the positive and nega-
tive effect values and groups the results into bands. This version of displaying 
attribution data joins the gradient bands, effect values, and sector labels to 
further assess rank order.
One shortcoming of Figure 6.13 is the constant band comparison between 
the blue and orange quadrants. To assess the rank order of the sector relative 
returns, the chart requires you to track each sector one by one across the four 
quadrants. Instead, a simplified rank order can be displayed to eliminate the 
tracking across quadrants and bands. The next set of visuals illustrates how 
to apply an alternative value axis layout to replace the curvilinear effect scale. 
Figure 6.14 explains this space modification applied to the standard quadrant 
model.

Figure 6.15 provides a step-by-step illustration of how stretching the space as 
suggested in Figure 6.14 will lead to consolidations of quadrants. The two blue 
(“Good Quadrants”) and two orange (“Bad Quadrants”) overlap and thus create 
simplified bipolar areas.
Both Figures 6.14 and 6.15 visually describe the new coordinate system, which 
supports a rank view of effect. Visual gradients remain in the effect diagram to 
show the groups of positive and negative effects. With the three coordinates pres-
ent and explained, you can now incorporate the attribution weighting effects.

The results of the combined quadrant produce a simplified plane that plots the 
effect in rank order from high- to low-ranking effect values. The circular color 
fill differentiates overweight versus underweight selections. In Figure 6.16, it is 
interesting to see that all the negative effect values can be attributed to over-
weight choices.

Figure 6.16  Hyperbolic Plane
Another part of attribution reporting often includes security selection. The next 
set of figures applies the same grid structure and hyperbolic plane composition 
to the securities in a portfolio. To start, Figure 6.17 presents the list of securities 
within the BHB quadrant table.
The quadrant table can easily accommodate this list of securities and include 
many more. The security list is numbered, color-coded, and sorted by the effect 
value. Next, Figure 6.18 presents the data within the effect tracks and Fig-
ure 6.19 maps the security effect values to the hyperbolic plane.

This section provides two related solutions to identify and rank return attri-
bution data. Both solutions display the effect data within a hyperbolic grid

to provide a simplified ranking system, and both solutions can be applied 
to sector and security-level attribution reporting. The hyperbolic quad-
rants (Figures 6.13 and 6.18) maintain the original BHB quadrant system and 
apply the gradient color-fill to distinguish effect rank. This in turn (Figures 
6.16 and 6.19) creates a ranked positive to negative effect value list. 
Each visualization within this section has some merit. For example, the 
hyperbolic quadrant solution (Figures 6.12 and 6.18) has the advantage of 
resembling the original BHB quadrant system. The quadrant system shows 
attribution pertaining to the four combinations of weight and returns. The 
familiarity of this visualization can make it more readily understandable. 
In contrast, the hyperbolic plane (Figures 6.16 and 6.19) introduces a new 
coordinate system to provide a simplified ranking system. The new solu-
tion removes the quadrants and replaces these with a consolidated plane 
that shows the distribution and clusters of the effect values. 
Risk Attribution
Risk attribution focuses on the volatility of a portfolio’s periodic investment 
returns relative to the benchmark’s investment returns. This section charts 
multi-factor risk model data to evaluate ex post risk at a firm-wide level. The 
following charts show you how to display risk model results, and answer: Is a 
certain fund riskier than its peer and by how much? What is the relative volatil-
ity of the invested fund? A clear understanding of this data enables you to make 
informed decisions based on the relative volatility of a firm’s funds.  
The Risk Attribution Table (Figure 6.20) displays the results of sample risk 
­models. As you review the data table, consider how you would answer the ques-
tions related to peer relative risk. Note that the models are representative and 
can easily be replaced with other vendor models or your own proprietary mod-
els to track active risk, beta, and % factor risk. The Risk Attribution Table is a 
useful tool that provides 1) valuable data based on a range of calculation results; 
2) organized data groups; and 3) a look-up table used to reference and pinpoint 
certain data points. Yet there are several barriers that limit you from gaining 
insights from the data.

Portfolio Risk Attribution
Figure 6.20  Risk Data Table

Attribution    173
Although the table is an effective look-up tool, it is not effective for comparison. 
Across 43 funds and 12 different calculated results, you are presented and tasked 
to make sense of 516 different numeric data points. It is difficult to scan the table 
to compare and analyze how various funds have trended over the past year. It is 
also difficult to calculate the differences among multiple models. For example, 
to analyze a fund’s active risk, you need to review and calculate four data points: 
two models and those two models 1 year back. What is the active risk of our funds 
across models and what is the magnitude of change? How does the Active Growth 
funds compare to other funds in its category of Large Cap Growth?
Instead, consider an approach that maintains the three original benefits of the 
table (range of calculation results, organized group structure, look-up method) 
while removing the calculation efforts. The following set of figures are all part 
of one solution introduced in small parts. A small slice of the data is shown in 
Figure 6.21.

Figure 6.22  Bar Delta
Color-filled triangles attached to each bar show movement changes over a 
one-year period to track funds and their corresponding direction and rate of 
change for the labeled risk model. As shown in the legend, the tip of the triangle 
represents the current value, and the base of the triangle represents the values 
one year back. All triangle tips are attached to the ends of the bars, while all tri-
angle bases float to the right or left of the bar. To further enforce an increase or 
decrease in active risk orange (a warning color) indicates increases in the risk, 
whereas blue (a cool calming color) shows decreases. 
The resulting Figure 6.22 consolidates two data columns into one. This slice of 
the data set represents 16 risk values, and can answer the following questions: 
Which funds experienced an increase in active risk over the past year? Which 
funds were the most stable? Which fund decreased the most over the past year? 
These questions are relatively easy to answer using our visual system. In con-
trast, numeric representations, as shown in the original table, require 120 cal-
culations to be made to answer these same questions. Figure 6.23 consolidates 
more data and incorporates another slice of the data into the chart.

Figure 6.23  Bar Delta Stacks
As shown in Figure 6.23, two stacked bars encourage direct comparison 
between the risk models. This data slice includes 32 distinct values—calculated 
as eight funds, two models, and two points in time—all within one column. As 
a result of the consolidation to one column, the small differences across the data 
set can surface.  
The efficiency gains the chart provides through quick comprehension (with-
out calculations) outweigh the effort required to learn the visual system. 
However once learned, the chart can use multiple triangle markers and pro-
vide a comprehensive view across more funds and more attributes. 
Figure 6.24 applies these similar techniques and approaches to the remaining 
data set, transforming the original data table into one visual communication.

Portfolio Risk Attribution: Active, Beta, Factor and Stock Risk
Figure 6.24  Bar Delta Columns

Summary    177
The original twelve columns of data—for active, beta risk, factor, and stock 
risk—are reduced to three columns. And while the table no longer shows the 
numeric values, accommodations can be made to incorporate and layer those 
details as needed. As in previous visuals, when numeric values are needed, they 
can be displayed in a panel to the right of the chart.
Key Take-Aways
As a comprehensive review of a full fund list, the Portfolio Risk Attribu-
tion chart pinpoints funds or groups of funds with significant increases or 
decreases in risk. The ability to parse the data with ease is made possible 
by employing the following methods: 
▸
▸Direct comparison—Replacing numeric values with bars makes it 
easy to compare funds, risk models, or years. An enriched set of hori-
zontal stacked bar charts facilitates comparisons across the 43 funds.
▸
▸Data consolidation—Folding four columns into one unites related 
data sets. For example, all four data columns that represent active risk 
are consolidated into one chart column.
▸
▸Triangle markers—Triangle markers visually illustrate the rate of 
change for each fund. Which funds experienced the quickest decrease 
in active risk? Which fund group faced the most increase in beta risk? The 
triangle markers quickly answer these questions.
Figure 6.24 has been constructed to optimize your comprehension of the 
change in risk data to directly compare related data and discover trends 
guided by the triangular markers.
Summary
In this chapter, you have seen data sets composed of market level data with 
the market map, firm level data with the composite and risk attribution 
example, and portfolio level data with gain/loss and return attribution. 

178    Chapter 6: Performance Measurement
Across each of these use cases, you have seen visualization techniques that 
show you how to:
▸
▸Reorganize data for better comparison as shown in the market map
▸
▸Group-related data sets as shown in the GIPS composite table
▸
▸Provide data delivery on demand as shown in portfolio gain/loss report
▸
▸Map data to a different grid system as shown in return attribution 
Aside from these visualization techniques, this chapter has also introduced new 
chart types. The following table lists the visualization ideas we have applied to 
performance measurement data. They represent new versions of each chart type 
that best represent the data. The Marimekko chart is the only commonly used 
chart type that has been refined to showcase performance data. The other chart 
types introduce adjustments to emphasize different aspects of the data.

This chapter introduced new visualization techniques largely based on existing 
visual methods. Treemaps, stacked bars, quadrants, and single bar charts are 
all widely used methods to display data. However, adjusting the treemap from 
a set of nested rectangles to vertically organized rectangles improves compari-
son. And simply attaching interlocking blocks and triangles to a bar provides 
additional information about net results and the rate of change. Each of these 
visualizations builds on the familiarity of an existing chart type, then adds an 
improvement. Building upon prior knowledge makes each new visualization 
easier to interpret and learn and recognize as an improvement.

Financial Statements 7
Accounting standards set the expectations, scope, and definitions of the data in finan-
cial statements. In an annual report, hired auditors are expected to review data and 
presentation materials to ensure accuracy and honesty across all pages. Annual reports, 
10-K SEC filings, and established practices in compliance with generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) have well-documented principles, policies, and proce-
dures to ensure integrity and a common understanding in the practice of organizing 
and presenting financial data. 
As the industry recognizes accuracy as a baseline requirement, transparency and 
accessibility to the details of the data becomes important as well. This chapter explores 
visualization ideas that maintain conventional standards of financial statements while 
answering the following questions about how you might improve and augment the data 
display to be more transparent and easily accessible to answer: How do the operating 
expenses compare to the revenues? What comprises investment cash flows and how does it 
compare to operational cash flows? How can you show the connection between the state-
ment of financial position and cash flows or operating budget? 
Each section within the chapter reviews a fundamental aspect of financial statements 
including the statement of cash flows, statement of activities, and operating budget. 
Within each of these financial statements, we aim for accuracy, transparency, and 
accessibility, all the while showing you how to apply and embed those principles into 
charts. All the examples in this chapter start with the traditional text and numeric value

a chart that communicates the core data points and then extends the chart to 
incorporate more details or more capabilities in later examples. You learn how 
to further tailor the display by selecting from a range of visual techniques to 
enrich your review of the statement of cashflows, financial activity, and operat-
ing budgets. 
The data set used in the chapter is sourced from the annual reports of both  
nonprofit and for-profit organizations. Although the visuals are sourced and 
designed for print, a few are also shown as interactive displays.
Statement of Cash Flows
Knowing how cash moves in and out of an organization provides crucial 
insights into how an organization operates. Views that highlight cash flows 
focus on incoming flows for operation, investment, or finance and outgoing 
expenditures and investments. This data shown in a cash flows statement helps 
you answer questions such as: How well can this organization generate cash? 
How do incoming flows compare to outgoing cash flows? To help you see and 
better understand the answers to those questions, this section provides various 
data visualization techniques for statement of cash flows of both nonprofit and 
for-profit organizations. 
Nonprofit Organizations
The statement of cash flows for a nonprofit organization resembles that of a 
for-profit organization. The differences lie not in the structure of the statement 
but in the focus and results, showing how they manage cash flows. Nonprofit 
organizations focus on how little they require to operate and how generously 
they fund services that support their community. The visualization that follows 
the data table in Figure 7.1 can serve this focus. But first, we review a standard 
nonprofit cash flows statement (Figure 7.1).

186    Chapter 7: Financial Statements
As it stands, the Statements of Cash Flows table (Figure 7.1) presents a string 
of positive and negative numbers, subtotals, and totals. The numbers easily 
blend in from one line item to another and do not show the impact and size 
of each line item. Although each section provides a net amount, you still need 
to inspect individual line items to understand the extent and direction of the 
flows. Does one large positive flow counter the remaining negative flows? Or 
instead is there more of a balance? Augmenting the details of the flows with 
visual indicators enables you to make better sense of the data to see how the 
organization is spending. Figure 7.2 visualizes the data, so the previous ques-
tions can be quickly answered.

Figure 7.2  Summary Waterfall
As an organization, where did your cash level start at the beginning of the year, 
where did you spend, and how did you arrive at the current balance? Waterfall 
bar charts such as the one in Figure 7.2 show how movement of individual flows 
can impact a derived value. This type of chart is well-suited to display the cash 

Statement of Cash Flows    187
flows data in Figure 7.1. To help track the operating versus investing activities, 
the vertical line that starts at 32,737 provides a constant reference point as cash 
flows in and out of the organization. The line shows how close or far away from 
the starting point the flows reach. 
If you compare the order and values of the data in Figure 7.2 to the original 
Statements of Cash Flows (Figure 7.1) you may notice some differences. First, 
the order of the data has been altered to show the beginning and ending balance 
in the beginning and ending of the chart. Second, Figure 7.2 aggregates the val-
ues for each section. Next, Figure 7.3 expands the data set and includes all the 
values listed in the original cash flow table.
The Detail Waterfall (Figure 7.3) introduces the full data set while still main-
taining the same structure as the previous cash flows chart. The aggregations 
of positive cash flows (detailed in shades of blue) versus negative cash flows 
(shades of orange) reorganize the detail data into two categories of positive and 
negative. The color variations within each bar correspond to the listed line item 
amounts; some are too small to see or appear only as faint lines. For example, 
Funds Held by Bond Trustees listed as 13 (thousand) is too small of an amount 
to see as a color block, whereas the next listing of Short-Term Investments is a 
sizeable amount at 21,124 (thousand) and represented as the next color block. 
The color blocks provide more visual information about the varying amounts 
within each section. As a result, the waterfall chart provides three levels of hier-
archical exploration:
▸
▸Top-level aggregates—Results of top-level aggregates for operating, 
investing, and financing activities. For example, operating activities list 
–30,631 as the aggregate value. 
▸
▸Grouped items—Grouped additions are shown as blue bars and the sub-
tractions are shown in orange bars. To reinforce the grouping, the text 
items appear in the corresponding color of the bars.
▸
▸Individual items—Individual line items are listed within each group.

Figure 7.5  Multi-Year Summary Waterfall

Statement of Cash Flows    191
The benefit of the Waterfall chart is that it can expand from year to year and 
seamlessly connect one year’s flows into another. Detail or summary, two years 
or four, the Waterfall chart can expand or contract in both details and years. 
Observations of the data can include trends that point to long-term or short-
term cash flow strategy stated by the organization. For example, Figure 7.5 
shows a two-year trend of consistently allocating small Financing Activities 
paired with an increase in Investing Activities. As years are added to the chart, 
you can view more trends that connect organizational accomplishments set to 
a multi-year strategy. 
Key Take-Aways
Cash flows data can be well represented with the Waterfall chart. It shows 
how cash or cash equivalents move in and out of an organization using a 
series of bars describing how individual cash flows impact a derived value. 
Waterfall charts are flexible enough to represent summary, detail, and 
multi-year cash flows. These multi-year cash flows reveal if there are trends 
in how cash is used and if the goals are supported with a cash flows strat-
egy. Later in this chapter, you will see additional benefits to and variations 
on the Waterfall chart. It can be applied to other types of financial state-
ments, and other visualizations can be integrated into the Waterfall chart. 
For-Profit Organizations
For-profit organizations typically aim to show how well they manage their 
money to impress current and potential investors. Some may want to present 
healthy starting/ending cash amounts to prove they have sufficient working 
capital; and others may wish to demonstrate that they can generate cash to 
grow their business. In either case, the Waterfall chart can fulfill these goals. 
Figure 7.6 represents for-profit data and applies the Waterfall chart to visualize 
this data.

Although the data and goals of for- and nonprofit organizations may differ 
substantially, the detailed Waterfall cash flows visualization technique can work 
equally well for both. The same visualization techniques of displaying cash flows 
data in Detail, Summary, or Multi-year Waterfalls can be applied. But some may 
wish to visually distinguish the components of their cash flows by tweaking the 
style of the Waterfall visualization as in Figure 7.7.

Figure 7.7  Cascade
The slight slant to each bar reinforces the positive or negative direction of its 
cash flows. Slanting to the right or left visually links starting and ending points 
of each bar. This minor adjustment enables you to easily track the flows and 
removes the need to bundle positive and negative flows into undifferentiated 
groups. The Cascade chart’s fixed order of items, listed in a table format, allows 
for a more reliable year-to-year comparison of variations in cash flows compo-
nents. Figures 7.8 and 7.9 present three years of side-by-side cash flows data.

Figure 7.9  Multi-Year Interactive Cascade
Depending on your needs, you can select from any of the Cascade chart varia-
tions. For example, Figures 7.8 and 7.9 show two variations of the Cascade chart. 
Figure 7.8 shows aggregate values with a list of underlying items and assumes a 
static image or print and an audience that does not need to review the underly-
ing numeric values for each line item. In contrast, Figure 7.9 lists aggregate 
values with access to those specific values. It assumes an interactive display that 
can present the detail values on demand. Another way to join summary and 
detail cash flows is shown in Figures 7.10 and 7.11, respectively.

Statement of Cash Flows    197
The detail display (Figure 7.10) provides all 66 values across three years within 
one view. In contrast, the summary display (Figure 7.11) is abbreviated and shows 
only 12 data points. Another variation applied to the Cascade chart is the use of 
color. Because the bar slant communicates the direction of the cash flows, the 
bars can use color for another purpose. Color distinguishes the groupings in 
Figures 7.10 and 7.11 as opposed to the direction of the flows.

Figure 7.12  Comparison Cascade by Year
You can customize both the level of data aggregation from summary to detail 
and the specifics of how you render the data using color. If you want to empha-
size the groupings, you should mimic how color is used in Figure 7.10 and 
Figure 7.11. If you would rather showcase the positive and negative flows, apply 
the color encoding as shown in Figure 7.8. Aligning your communication needs 
with the variations and customizations of the chart is part of the selection 
process. 

Statement of Cash Flows    201
Compact summary views enable you to include a list of cash flows data across 
both years and firms (Figures 7.12 and 7.13). Figure 7.12 shows a year-centric 
view with the rows dedicated to a list of different firms, whereas Figure 7.13 
provides a firm-centric view with its rows dedicated to listing different years. In 
either case, the layout can scale to include more years and firms. You can pick 
the orientation of the data to align the flows by year or by firm.

Figure 7.13  Comparison Cascade by Firm
Both Figures 7.12 and 7.13 introduce red and black colors to highlight the 
change in cash and cash equivalents. This is yet another example of how you 
can select from various aspects of the chart structure.
Key Take-Aways
This section reuses the Waterfall chart and introduces the Cascade chart to 
represent cash flows data for for-profit organizations. Like variations on a 
theme, this section shows how to apply the Cascade chart technique to a 
variety of use cases. From Waterfall to Cascade, Summary to Detail, Single 
to Multi-year, each variation is tailored to serve different needs. Both the 

202    Chapter 7: Financial Statements
Waterfall and Cascade charts each augment a series of numbers with rec-
ognizable shapes that encode basic properties of yearly flows. The variety 
of Cascade chart types provides a selection of visualization techniques that 
you can mix and match to suit your needs. Say you want to present a multi-
year approach to financing activities. In this case you may elect to 1) use a 
three-year interactive data display, 2) include each numeric cash flows value, 
3) use color to group the activities, and 4) point out a positive or negative 
ending results in cash/cash equivalents with the red/black color code. Each 
of these choices tailors the data presentation to match your narrative.
Statement of Financial Activity
The Statement of Financial Activity is a key financial statement for  
nonprofits and is similar to the Income Statement for for-profit organiza-
tions. Although this section focuses on the Statement of Financial Activity 
data, the same visualization techniques can be applied to an Income State-
ment or any statement that describes how movement of individual flows 
impacts a derived value. Both statements present the income and expenses 
of an organization for a stated period of time. The Statement of Financial 
Activity shows the effects financial choices make on the net assets of an 
organization. Figure 7.14 shows the typical approach to presenting the  
Statement of Financial Activity as a table. 
Similar to cash flows data, the data listed in the Statement of Financial Activity 
(Figure 7.14) is composed of positive and negative flows across three groups includ-
ing unrestricted, temporarily restricted, and permanently restricted activities. 
With a similar data structure and purpose seen in the Statement of Cash Flows, 
Figure 7.15 applies the Waterfall chart to the Statement of Financial Activity. 
In Figure 7.15, an arrow points out net assets released from restrictions which 
makes it the only change this detailed Waterfall has from the original. Reusing 
a chart type like this across a set of financial statements creates consistency 
and builds upon any previously learned knowledge of how the chart works. The 
arrow visually connects two related objects within the chart to show the trans-
fer of assets between the referenced line items.

Figure 7.16  Integrated Waterfall

206    Chapter 7: Financial Statements
This version of the Interactive Waterfall (Figure 7.16) provides breadth and 
depth to the data—with multiple years’ worth of data providing breadth, and 
the pop-up display panel of detailed operating expenses providing depth. 
Questions regarding changes in the financial activity can be posed and 
answered by calling up the interactive display panel. How do the operating 
expenses compare to the revenues? Historically, what has been spent on aca-
demic support? To answer these types of questions, this Interactive Waterfall 
chart integrates two data sets—the Statement of Financial Activity and the 
Operating Budget—and two chart types. 
Key Take-Aways
This section illustrates how to use the Waterfall chart in other financial 
statements, and how to integrate data from two financial statements 
into one interactive chart. For example, the Interactive Waterfall chart 
(Figure 7.16) introduces the concept of integrating the Statement of Finan-
cial Activity and Operating Budget, thereby clarifying the connections 
between the two data sets. The interactive display provides a cohesive 
experience, contextually links the data, and explains each aggregate value 
with a historical perspective. 
Operating Budget
This section reviews a ten-year operating budget and suggests a way to provide 
a better grasp of how monies are allocated in an organization. Using consistent 
methods to present the same items across the years enables the user to compare 
changes in operating costs over the years. Which costs are consistently increas-
ing or decreasing? How do these adjustments impact future planning? Figure 7.17 
shows a sample ten-year operating budget to address these questions.

Figure 7.17  Ten-Year Operating Budget
With a total of 284 numeric values, the ten-year operating budget provides 
historical context behind current values. The trajectory of data across all items 
in the operating budget can provide context of scale. Relative to federal and 
state grants, how much has been provided in financial aid grants? How divergent 
or convergent are the revenues from Tuition to expenditures in Instruction? The 
next set of charts, starting with Figure 7.18, provides direct ways to represent 
the 284 data points.

Area Bar charts provide a straightforward method to show quantity rank 
information in a data set. To emphasize the current year, a combination 
of darker color bars and bold numbers bring your attention to the right of 
the chart. Color is used consistently for both the visual area Bar chart and 
text values to reiterate and fully distinguish the revenue versus expenditure 
data. You may have noticed the individual items have been reordered within 
the groups. To balance the chart, the larger budgets are placed toward the 
middle area of the chart and smaller budgets are moved toward the out-
skirts. The reordering of the list shows a semi-sorted view of top revenues 
and expenditures within closer proximity of each other. In addition, two 
vertical dotted lines group together the top three items from the original 
table. These types of order and grouping adjustments help compare the data 
more efficiently. 
Next, Figure 7.19 changes the Area Bar chart to highlight the last several years. 
A gradual shift of attention is attained with the Gradient Area bar chart 
example. The gradient technique communicates that the lighter color blocks are 
simply background information, whereas the stronger, darker color blocks are 
more relevant to the present and require most of our attention. Associations of 
past to present and informational to important are in harmony with the imple-
mentation of the gradient. 
Figures 7.18 and 7.19 primarily focus on the most-recent years of the data. 
Instead of placing your attention on recent years, Figure 7.20 introduces a dif-
ferent version of the chart to emphasize the change in quantities relative to the 
starting point of ten years previous to the current data.  
The Offset Area Bar chart uses a benchmark approach to illustrate past, cur-
rent, and future budgets. With the level set at year 2004, all budgets are mea-
sured as deviations from that starting point. This chart enables you to see which 
budgets have increased and which budgets have decreased and by how much.

Key Take-Aways
All three operating budget charts provide straightforward area chart 
views to show the trends and changes in a budget. Key lessons have been 
incorporated into each of these charts. First, the order of the operating 
revenues and expenditures is reorganized to improve the comparison of 
the large budget items. Second, the charts show visualization techniques 
that emphasize quantities in dollars or emphasize the relative changes in 
percentage from a given starting point. The benchmark of a starting year 
drives the comparison for all future years, providing a quick review of bud-
get changes. Third, the ten-year operating budget data can be integrated 
into other statements (Figure 7.16). You can select which operating budget 
chart to use depending on whether you wish to emphasize quantities or 
percentage change. 
Summary
The visualizations in this chapter focus on the need for transparency and acces-
sibility in the highly standardized world of financial statements. Transparency 
increases when readers can see the source details of an aggregated value, and 
accessibility increases when they can easily get to the details. Each visualiza-
tion reveals the size and impact of each line item. For example, the Summary 
Waterfall chart (Figure 7.2) shows how investment and operational cash flows 
compare in size and how they impact the year ending cash balance. 
These visualizations also link statements together. The Integrated Waterfall 
chart (refer to Figure 7.16) incorporates part of the operating budget data into 
an integrated view. Integrating the two statements makes the data more acces-
sible to those who wish to review past budgets in context. 
Financial statements are known for accuracy and attention to detail and employ 
a uniform method to gather and present data. The examples in this chapter 
maintain conventional standards of financial statements while introducing 
visuals to augment the standard tables. The visualizations reflect the direct and 
accurate stance of financial statements with the use of straight lines to indicate

precise aggregate levels, negative and positive flows, and quantity changes 
across the years.

The visualizations introduced in this chapter are all variations on a single theme. 
That theme is reuse; and the Waterfall chart provides one useful example. We 
reapply one basic concept to both nonprofit and for-profit organizational objec-
tives, and to two different financial statements with summary, detail, and mul-
tiple year versions. We explain reuse through other examples such as: 
▸
▸How to reuse the Cascade chart to expand the data set to compare one 
organization with others. 
▸
▸How to reuse an Area Bar chart and integrate it with another type of chart. 
▸
▸How to reuse visual techniques, such as color or groupings, from any of 
the charts to tailor your narrative. 
For this reason, many of the charts are similar in structure, yet distinct in how 
they reveal specifics. The chapter includes several versions of the same chart 
type: seven Cascade, and three Area bar charts. Each version reuses the basic 
chart structure yet displays detailed data, interactions, and groupings in dis-
tinct ways. Although the financial statements in this chapter have been limited 
to three, you can reuse these charts in other financial statements or data sets 
that require a similar purpose.

Pension Funds 
8
Pension funds are the largest managed pooled investment and represent $36.1 trillion 
worldwide (according to the 2015 Towers Watson annual Global Pension Assets Study of 
16 major markets). Many pension funds have significant funding gaps, and with greater 
market volatility, longer life expectancies, population bulges, and inflation, they con-
tinue to face adversity. Over the years, plan sponsors have made a number of changes to 
reduce their deficits including decreasing benefits, increasing employee contributions, 
increasing the retirement age, and shifting toward defined contribution plans. Given the 
changing landscape and the impact to millions of active participants in pension plans 
worldwide, a close review of the data is called for to tell a clear story of the current state 
of the funds and to help make accurate predictions about their future directions.
The California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) represents the fifth larg-
est pension in the world (Bloomberg data, 2014). Managers of this complex fund pro-
duce a 250-page annual report that incorporates numeric data to explain details within 
the current status of the fund. The report holds the majority of the data in tables and 
uses only seven charts to display the financial overview and fund performance, making 
it difficult to extract meaningful conclusions from the data. More can and should be 
done to show clearly the state of the fund to the 1.7 million CalPERS members. With 
$262 billion on the line, this fund has every reason to provide better representation and 
understanding of the data to all interested parties.
This chapter focuses on three major areas within the CalPERS fund: 1) plan members 
and their profiles; 2) contributions versus benefits; and 3) the ultimate position of the 
﻿    217

218    Chapter 8: Pension Funds 
fund as seen in the funding ratio. We use the Public Employees’ Retirement 
Fund (PERF) from the annual report, as it covers nearly all CalPERS retirement 
benefits. Examples from these three focus areas can be used in presentations 
to the board or conversations between the investments, funding, and financial 
departments of the fund. All the ideas can be applied to future annual reports 
as a way to improve pension communications to plan members. Although the 
examples in this chapter are not embedded in the investment process to actively 
manage pension funds, the examples provide fund status and can be used to 
assess current state. 
Plan Members
Visualizations in this section provide a brief overview of the plan participants 
in the fund and review current and historical data points to reveal trends in 
member populations. The demographic trend data displays what the fund needs 
to support and ultimately where the fund is headed with various member levels. 
For example, the member make-up with population segmentation, number of 
members, and change in members over a ten-year period are all views into the 
pension fund’s future requirements. 
Throughout this section, we start with the full data table to create a visual 
representation of the entire data set. Next, the visualizations evolve and become 
more selective in the data used from the tables to make different points and 
emphasize one perspective or data set over another. We introduce new tech-
niques and variations of existing chart types to improve how we communicate 
the information. 
The data in this section is taken from a few of the CalPERS annual report tables 
including Exhibit G: Members in Valuation, Exhibit D: Sample Non-Economic 
Assumptions, and Membership & Retirement Data. We have chosen these tables 
because they describe the member profile and are representative of others in the 
section; the first represents nine tables and the last four. The existing data set for 
actuarial member section is more expansive; the explorations are a start to what 
can be done with the data as we transform tables of data into usable charts. 

Plan Members    219
Members in Valuation
The Members in Valuation data set provides subtotal and total quantities for 
age groups and years of service. A chart can be structured to emphasize one 
data set over another: Individual values, cumulative values, or rank order are all 
perspectives the data sets can reveal. In this section, you see how different chart 
types can showcase individual values over cumulative values or rank order. 
First, review the existing data set. Figure 8.1 is a re-created table taken from 
CalPERS Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. The data and organizational 
structure of the table is a straight replica of what is presented in the report with 
eight similar tables that follow.

Figure 8.2  Color-Coded Line Chart
This unreadable Line chart (Figure 8.2) represents how some may depict the 
data. The ten color-coded age group lines cross over each other and create a 
tangled canvas. You could trace each line to see the individual age group results, 
but together the ten points seem meaningless and unrelated. Instead, you may 
need to see the details of each group, as well as the summary across all; you may 
need to provide an individual age group result, as well as a view across all the  
age groups. 
The next chart, shown in Figure 8.3, separates the age groups. You can notice 
immediate benefits. This separation detangles the groups and shows a clear 
profile to the years in service for each group.
It is easy to see a pattern emerge from Area Comparison (Figure 8.3). The 
combined series of charts enable you to see the changes in volumes as each 
age group incrementally expands into more years of service. Although the 
ten sequential charts reveal individual patterns, the chart shown in Figure 8.4 
reveals cumulative patterns.

Figure 8.3  Area Comparison Chart
The stacked area approach to the chart (Figure 8.4) provides four major benefits: 
1) each age group is clearly shown; 2) group patterns emerge; 3) cumulative 
member trends are presented; and 4) the data is consolidated into one chart. 
The primary distinguishing factor between Figures 8.3 and 8.4 is the values; the 
former shows values as individual age groups and the later as cumulative. Both 
charts are readable and provide different perspectives of the data to make dif-
ferent points. An additional perspective to the data can be the rank order by age 
group. Next, Figure 8.5 charts both totals and percentage to present rank.

Figure 8.5  Area and Bar Combo Chart

Plan Members    223
Across the years of service, what is the rank order of the members by age group? 
You could estimate it based on the Area chart. But instead the Bar chart pro-
vides a more accurate account of rank order. The two charts address this ques-
tion with relative and absolute ranked charts. The y-axis percentage provides 
the age group relative view, whereas the Bar chart provides the absolute number 
of members. The Combo chart presents five benefits: 1) each age group is rep-
resented; 2) group patterns emerge; 3) relative member trends are presented; 
4) actual group ranks are linked; and 5) the data is consolidated into a Combo 
chart that shares labels across the two charts.
Next, the age group-focused chart (the bottom chart of Figure 8.6) creates a 
more organized view of the data that makes it easier to evaluate. It displays how 
the number of members peak and then together decrease to converge around 
a stabilized level. This is a perspective brought about by pivoting the data. 
The reorganized structure of the chart reveals the overall pattern across age 
groups; it is easy to see there exists a rise and fall to the number of members in 
valuation. 
With the new pivoted view, we can ask the similar questions we answered with 
our previous charts: Which years of service group has the most distributed age 
group? A chart of individual groups can illustrate this view (Figure 8.7). Which 
age group has the largest population? A chart that accumulates the values can 
present this answer (Figure 8.8).

Figure 8.6  Color-Coded Line Chart
The charts show the technique of individual or cumulative values; sequential indi-
vidual charts (Figure 8.7) provide individual attention to the year of service ranges, 
whereas the cumulative (Figure 8.8) presents peak member volumes across all. Each 
chart features and emphasizes different data points. For example, the Area Com-
parison chart shows individual values, the Stacked Area chart highlights cumulative 
values, and the Area & Bar Combo emphasizes rank. Figure 8.9 applies the same 
Area & Bar Combo chart to show rank order of members by years of service.

Figure 8.9  Area & Bar Combo Chart
Combo charts can emphasize one perspective solely or present a major and a 
minor emphasis. Figure 8.9 provides a major and minor emphasis: relative and 
absolute rank of years of service rank as the major perspective and separate age 
group  values as the minor. Actually, both Figures 8.5 and 8.9 use the same chart 
structure to emphasize rank with greater accuracy and individual values as a 
secondary focus. In Figure 8.9, the chart secondarily shows the overall pattern to 
years of service relative to age group. This perspective is possible with the indi-
vidual years of service values presented as a percentage.
Key Take-Aways
Transforming a data table into a chart requires some careful decision-
making. If you decide to display all the data sets in one chart, you may 
end up with a spaghetti effect that communicates little. You may find 
it more effective to isolate each quantity either into separate charts or 
within a main chart with its own color fill.  Alternative charts that follow 
our spaghetti example emphasize different aspects of the data, including 

Plan Members    227
individual quantities, aggregate totals, and relative and rank quantities. 
You can tell a different story with each chart or present them all together 
to show all sides. 
In addition to deciding what chart type to use, you have to choose what 
the x-axis and y-axis represent. Re-assigning the x- and y- axes as in Fig-
ures 8.5 and 8.9 show the same chart type and data with different results 
because the data has been pivoted. The existing nine tables of Members 
in Valuation data can be easily overlooked. However, replacing them with 
Figures 8.5 and 8.9 emphasizes some interesting patterns in the data. 
Post Retirement
The next data set extends the age group to move beyond years of service and 
into post retirement. The post retirement numbers are presented in groups of 
male versus female, healthy versus disabled within bracketed age groups from 
50–100. This section reviews these different groups and explores how to present 
the data so that it best suits the needs of forecasting the pension. Figure 8.10 
displays the post retirement data provided by CalPERS.

228    Chapter 8: Pension Funds 
The table shown in Figure 8.10 is one of the many tables within Exhibit D: 
Sample Non-Economic Assumptions from the CalPERS actuarial section. The 
next set of charts, starting with Figure 8.11, use this data set to track and plot 
mortality rates across populations and gender.

Figure 8.11  Color-Coded Line Chart
As a starting point, a line chart (Figure 8.11) shows each column of data with 
similar trend lines and variations in the male/female populations. As such, 
distinction is given to these two populations through color sets: Blues for 
males and red/orange for females. Although the color line groupings provide 
some distinguishing factors between male/female and disabled/healthy 
variances, overlaps in the lines make it hard to clearly see the rates they 
represent. 

Plan Members    229
Aside from problems with the visibility of interwoven lines, the perspective of 
the chart itself also bears rethinking. Its current perspective, similar to the table 
data, revolves around mortality rates; however, the fund needs to plan to cover 
members who receive benefits. Figure 8.12 flips the perspective and reviews the 
survival rates as an alternative.

Figure 8.12 is the result of recalculating the mortality rate table data into one 
that focuses on survival percentages. It reveals a greater variation between the 
populations and shows a direct read of lower survival rates as time progresses. 
The chart aligns the legend order to the new perspective of healthy populations 
at the top. There is still more you can do to improve clarity and readability. To 
avoid population lines overlapping, you need to separate it into two fully reveal-
ing charts. Gender turns out to work well as a criterion by which to divide the 
data, as shown in Figure 8.13.

Figure 8.13  Dual Line Chart
This technique of separating the data into two charts makes it easier to see the 
two population rates. The technique greatly improves your ability to read the 
chart and focuses your attention to the data sets you want to compare. In addi-
tion, this technique of separation opens up the possibility to change the pairing 
into other sets, as shown in Figure 8.14.
The three sets of female/male pairing, as shown in Figure 8.14, uncovers similar 
trend lines and variations in longevity, with females living consistently longer 
than men. We learn more about how CalPERS should plan ahead, knowing that 
today’s survival rates are projections into tomorrow’s funding needs. 
Drastic changes are not always required to make a point. Figure 8.15 uses the 
color fill of an Area chart to communicate the volume of coverage the plan 
needs to consider. The small difference between a Line chart and Area chart 
adds weight and therefore gravitas to the area below the curve. In addition, the 
chart purposefully fills in the larger quantity to emphasize these are the topline 
numbers the pension needs to plan for.

Key Take-Aways
Although the original data focuses on mortality rates, the final chart recon-
siders the main purpose of the data. It flips the perspective from mortality 
to survival rates in order to emphasize the needs of the pension. The key 
take-away is that you should always question the data set’s perspective 
and ask what the data isn’t telling you that you should know. In this case, 
an aging population reveals that the pension should reflect how people 
are living longer lives. The survival rates chart provides this perspective. 
The second take-away is that you should untangle the data and make it 
more easily consumable by splitting it across multiple charts to make each 
data set more readable and easier to follow. For example, you can split the 
data into pairs to compare and contrast the statistics from different groups 
like we did here with male and female groups.  
Retirement Programs
The next plan membership data shifts from population segments of current 
values to population segments over a ten-year period of membership and retire-
ment data. The amount of data in the table opens the doors to a mix of charts. 
The first set of charts address the totals for each population segment. The sec-
ond set of charts addresses important ratios in the data. Last, a new technique 
is introduced to closely inspect and distinguish changes in the population and 
ratio charts.
The Membership and Retirement Data Table (Figure 8.16), taken from the 
Statistical Section of the annual report, tracks how the various member popula-
tions change over the years. With this data you uncover what these changes 
mean and contrast the data sets to see the balance of members to recipients. 
From one detail table to a detail chart, Figures 8.17 and 8.18 transfer the table 
line items to chart line items.

Stacking the data sets shows the accumulation and total member values,  
yet you may also want to compare the stacks. You may want to examine the  
balance of members across the groups. As a system of inputs and outputs, 
you may want to highlight contributors to and consumers of the fund, known 
as members and recipients, and the balance of these two entities within the 
system. In Figures 8.19 and 8.20, each member group is displayed as a tally of 
subtotals.

These figures remove the details to compare changes in volume across the 
member groups clearly. Changing the display from stacking the groups (Fig-
ure 8.19) to lining them up (Figure 8.20) enables you to focus your attention on 
the curve lines across groups. You can observe how the public and state agency 
members flatten while the benefit recipients rise steadily. Because you have the 
measurements for each group, you can see how the curve lines move in unison 
or diverge. Figure 8.21 shows the relationship between these two groups of 
recipients and members.

Figure 8.21  Ratio Area Chart
At times you may need to go beyond the table data and create your own calcula-
tions to understand relationships between two data sets. Figure 8.21 shows an 
example of this case: The plot of two populations as a ratio can get to the core 
of understanding the balance of members to recipients. The ten-year plot of the 
ratio produces a directional view into where the ratio may head if the conditions 
remain the same. Because a curve is the best indicator of change, Figure 8.22 
focuses more attention on the profile of the curve line.

Figure 8.22  Zoom Chart
A close inspection of the line profile of the all members reveals more details 
to the changes over time. The zoom view is paired up with the full Area chart 
view to disclose the full context of the chart. In Figure 8.22, you can review the 
changes to member numbers with a more granular scale and still see the mag-
nitude of size. As concentrated views, the Zoom chart highlights the changes. 
Similar to time-lapse photography that highlights movement and change of a 
seemingly motionless event, these concentrated views of the data do the same 
to bring forth changes.

Plan Members    239
A comparison across member groups uncovers the magnitude of change in 
member populations. Figure 8.23 uses the same technique of zooming into the 
y-axis to discover the significance in member changes.

Figure 8.23  Zoom Collection Chart
As a set, you can compare each graph and see that the public agency members 
show a slight upward turn while state members stabilize. Benefit recipient 
numbers have climbed, and continue to rise. The Zoom chart provides the 
type of resolution you need to detect small hiccups and bends in benefit 
recipients’ upward climb. The power of the Zoom chart is its capacity to call

attention to specific data points, making the unnoticed noticed. Figure 8.24 
illustrates this point.

Figure 8.24  Ratio Zoom Chart
Consider the ratio curve of recipients to members through the zoom lens. 
Figure 8.24 shows the original ratio on the left as a contrast to the zoomed-in 
version on the right. The differences are clear. The Zoom chart provides you an 
acute awareness of the ratio changes and similar to the previous Zoom charts, 
each one is paired with a full Area chart to show volume.  
Key Take-Aways
Temporal data that show totals and subtotals such as Plan Membership 
data can first be shown with basic Area or Line charts. Such simple rep-
resentations of the data ground your knowledge about the membership 
groups. From here, you can start to inquire and adjust the charts to reveal 
changing ratios and other comparative details of change over time. 

Contributions versus Benefits    241
This section introduced the Zoom chart, which provides a detailed view of 
a fluctuating area in a chart and thereby renders small variations more vis-
ible. The accompanying thumbnail of the full chart shows these variations 
in relation to total value. 
Contributions versus Benefits
As a priority, participants want to see their accrued benefits to understand what 
to expect from their payments. Participants also want to understand the health 
of the contributions that provide those benefits. In a payment-centric view, 
charts can be used to evaluate the net of both the contributions and deduc-
tions. This section reviews how those numbers impact the average allowance by 
reviewing and comparing fund profiles and member salary data. 
Additions by Source
This section transforms data tables into charts by starting with a simple depic-
tion of the data as a Bar chart. Across these simple depictions you find that the 
full data table is not always represented. The first visualizations in this section 
incorporate the full table of data but those that follow do not. Instead, the 
other charts use subtotals within the table to focus on different aspects of the 
data set.
This section uses data from two tables, as shown in Figure 8.25: The Additions 
by Source table is the detail breakdown of the Additions column in the Changes 
in Net Position table. Relationships between these two tables are illustrated in 
Figure 8.26 and represent a ten-year economic review of the fund.

Figure 8.26  Bar Charts

244    Chapter 8: Pension Funds 
Standard Bar charts like those in Figure 8.26 generally make comparisons easy 
and direct. The shared y-axis makes the comparison even more directly relatable. 
The word “direct” is key, and means that references and look-ups can be elimi-
nated. You could present each column of data as its own chart, as shown in Fig-
ure 8.26; however doing so would require the eyes of your readers to scan across 
bar heights to compare them. A review of Employer Contribution to Investment 
Income/Loss across ten years becomes tedious. Instead, you can provide a visual 
representation that eliminates not only references and look-ups but also the need 
for rulers to compare values across the years, as shown in Figure 8.27.

Figure 8.27  Fold-Over Stack Chart 

Contributions versus Benefits    245
To reduce the distance from one data set to another, simply remove the dis-
tance. You can align data sets around year markers, obviating the task of tracing 
to compare different data sets across the years. The Fold-Over Stack (Fig-
ure 8.27) consolidates six data sets into one chart: The stacked additions, shown 
in three shades of blue, incorporate the Additions by Source table. In addition, 
the triangular shape has the flexibility to accumulate either positive or negative 
values. The inverted yellow triangle provides a dual indicator of deductions and 
the net change.
Consolidating six charts into one not only saves space but presents relationships 
efficiently. The techniques used in the chart include:
▸
▸Alignment—Layering and aligning the data sets to yearly markers. 
▸
▸Stacking—Stacking the data within the triangular bar. Part Area chart, 
the volume of blues and yellow add and subtract to the net.
▸
▸Folding—Capping the positive values by bending the triangle down. The 
fold separates the positive and negative values.
▸
▸Pointing—The tip of the triangle acts as a pointer to the resulting net 
change. 
As you’ve seen in previous examples in this chapter, charts can emphasize 
one point over another. Figure 8.28 changes the perspective of the storyline to 
emphasize the net change.
Figure 8.28, augments the yellow points that end in the net change amounts 
with solid black bars to bring these values to the fore. Although the chart 
emphasizes net change, it deemphasizes the additions and deductions by plac-
ing them in the background as shadows. The Bar Shadow chart shows you the 
changes each year and describes how those changes were derived. If only net 
changes are of interest, this chart removes details from the previous chart to 
bring focus to the year over year changes. However, if instead the year end 
results are of interest then Figure 8.29 provides this emphasize.

The solid black bars in Figure 8.29 still dominate the chart. It not only tells the 
position at the end of each year but, as in Figure 8.28, also explains why. The 
net can be derived, but the main point of the chart is the net position. The chart 
emphasizes each year’s endpoint and uses color connectors to link one year to 
the next. They form paths of positive or negative addition and deduction events,

Figure 8.29  Bar Connectors Chart
Large sums, significantly and consistently above $100 billion at the end of each 
year, make details of additions and deductions harder to see. The next chart 
(Figure 8.30) solves this, still showing the full scale without sacrificing details.
Typical Waterfall charts present connected bars with negative or positive move-
ment, commonly shown as color bars. The synchronized positive movement of 
an addition and negative movement of a deduction is presumed in most Water-
fall charts but is not the case with the CalPERS data set. The net position data 
set is slightly more complex with cases of negative additions. For this reason, 
the standard Waterfall chart is slightly updated. The Directional Waterfall chart 
(Figure 8.30) uses color to denote additions and deductions but then also uses 
embedded arrows to reinforce the direction of the net position.

The additional benefit of Figure 8.30 is the “divide and conquer” approach  
of the two charts. Each chart is used for a specific need, and when paired 
together, the charts display a close-up view and understanding of the full con-
text. The chart on the left enables you to see a close-up view of the net position, 
whereas the chart on the right provides you context of scale. The context of 
scale chart shows just how much the net position has changed over the years 
and how that change compares to the overall size of the fund. The full y-axis 
starting at the zero mark makes the fund size more comparable to the net posi-
tion change.

Next, Figure 8.31 continues to use the dual chart approach yet focuses more 
attention on net positions.

Figure 8.31  Folded Bar Chart
The Folded Bar (Figure 8.31) chart is like a folded strip of paper that is creased 
to point up or down. It readily communicates an increase or decrease and points 
out inconsistencies in the alternating up/down pattern. The Folded Bar is a 2D 
chart that has been influenced by the look of a physical 3D object. Yellow bars 
drawn at an angle reinforces this perspective. 

250    Chapter 8: Pension Funds 
Key Take-Aways
This section builds on the strengths of the Bar chart and introduces varia-
tions on it to map data with a mix of positive and negative values. The Fold-
Over, Bar Shadow, Bar Connectors, Directional Waterfall, and Folded Bar 
charts are all variations of the Bar chart that can show year-to-year changes. 
Each chart displays a slightly different perspective of the data. The Fold-Over 
chart includes more details about cumulative additions and deductions. The 
Bar Shadow chart emphasizes the composition to derive the net change, 
while the Bar Connectors show the connections between year-end net posi-
tions. The Directional Waterfall and Folded Bar charts both show cumulative 
results of each year’s additions and deductions. 
Both easy to create and to read, the Bar chart is probably the most widely 
used chart type. Introducing these new techniques to the Bar charts is 
therefore relatively easier than introducing a completely new type of data 
visualization. 
Changes in Retirees & Beneficiaries
The Retirees & Beneficiaries data set takes a closer look into the deductions side 
of the equation with a review of the number of retirees added and removed each 
year. In addition to the “added to” and “removed from” yearly rolls, comparisons 
in annual allowances (as shown in Figure 8.32) present the profile of the fund.  
CalPERS annual report Exhibit H presents us with a schedule of Retirees &  
Beneficiaries Added to/and Removed from Rolls to end the actuarial section. 
The original table provides a 6-year review of four funds. In contrast, Fig-
ure 8.32 represents a 6-year review of one fund, PERF. This data reuses a previ-
ously presented chart with a different data set: Figure 8.33 shows you how to 
simplify the previously introduced Fold-Over chart.

Figure 8.33  Added & Removed Fold-over Chart
The general rule to reuse this chart pattern is based on its purpose to show 
additions, subtractions, and net. If the data type supports this purpose, the Fold-
Over chart design can be applied. Figure 8.33 largely focused on the first half of 
the table including added and removed rolls to derive the net. Figure 8.34 focuses 
on the second half of the table data starting with rolls at the end of the year. It 
uses the last four columns of the table data but shows two funds for comparison.

Figure 8.34  Area Comparison Chart
Figure 8.34 is another example of reusing a familiar chart type with a small 
twist. In general, Area charts are useful for showing the volume and profile of 
data. Figure 8.34 capitalizes on those benefits and accentuates them through 
additional tweaks to the chart. The Area Comparison chart collection 
improves the profile comparison of each chart by incorporating four addi-
tional alignment techniques:
▸
▸Horizontal dotted line—A horizontal dotted line is introduced to sup-
port the readers’ ability to compare the progress across the years from 
the starting point.

Contributions versus Benefits    253
▸
▸Vertical placement—The vertical placement of the dotted line is aligned 
and consistently situated across all charts.
▸
▸Matrix layout—The layout of column and row headers and aligned year 
labels provides an organized framework for comparison and growth. The 
framework can grow and include more funds if needed. 
The three techniques are small details that, when combined, improve your 
ability to see and compare variances. Unless explicitly pointed out, you may not 
know to re-create these small alignment details into your chart. However, when 
you do they will be valuable and used by your audience. 
Key Take-Aways
The charts in this section are all examples of previous charts you can 
repurpose and apply to different data sets. Both the Fold-Over and the 
Area Comparison charts have been slightly modified to adapt to specific 
needs. For the Fold-Over chart, details were removed until the data repre-
sented subtotals of Added and Removed Rolls. For the Area Comparison 
charts, details were added to make the charts easier to compare across a 
collection.
History of Member Salary
To contrast the allowances provided by the fund, the next data set reviews 
member salary. From one type of payment to the next, the following historical 
table data of salaries includes a standard ten-year span (Figure 8.35). 
Exhibit F: History of Member Salary of CalPERS is a small table listed among 
a series of reference tables. Listed on page 145 of the annual report, this is the 
type of table that may easily be skipped over and missed. The Salary Table (Fig-
ure 8.35) is selected to illustrate how the data can tell contrasting stories. Fig-
ure 8.36 shows these parallel stories by reviewing the profile of the quantities.

Figure 8.36  Area Comparison Chart
Area charts rely on the top line to project a profile of continuous data across the 
designated timeframe. A review of Figure 8.36 shows you three cases of yearly 
incremental changes and one case of extreme shifts in the data sets. However, 
each of the data sets has a designated y-axis scale. The data is not directly linked 

Contributions versus Benefits    255
by type; one data set covers individuals, two use dollars, and the fourth percent-
age. Despite these variations in incremental and extreme shifts, scales, and data 
types, you still need to learn from the data and understand: 
▸
▸How the member salaries have developed over the past decade 
▸
▸The pace of change between data sets
▸
▸The relationships are between these developments 
Essentially, you want to link the data sets in order to relate one data set to 
another. The next chart applies the previously introduced alignment technique. 
Figure 8.37 shows when and how to combine data sets and when/why to sepa-
rate data sets into two views.

Figure 8.37  Area Charts – Line and Bar Chart

256    Chapter 8: Pension Funds 
The key to relating one data set to another is alignment of similar data points. 
In the case of the salary data, the connection to all the data sets is time. In 
Figure 8.37, all four data sets are aligned around the yearly markers, starting in 
2003 and ending in 2012 together—so even though the line chart shows three 
y-axes, you can relate the three values to changes over the same time period. As 
the average salary continues to rise, the number of members and the total pay-
roll amounts fall;  these are the types of direct observations that can be made 
with an aligned and layered line chart. 
The two area charts shown in Figure 8.37 present the profile of a line and bar 
chart and are essentially extensions of a line and bar chart with added fill. The 
use of the two charts in this solution may elicit a key question: Why elect to 
use a line over a bar chart with the provided data set? A line chart is a useful 
method to uncover trends, layer more than one data set, and display up to three 
y-axes, whereas a bar chart’s strength lies in showing precise differences. Fig-
ure 8.37 makes use of each of the chart’s strengths and illustrates each case.  
Key Take-Aways
This short section shows an example of when and how to combine data 
sets into one chart and points out when to use a Line or Bar chart for time 
series data. If you want to closely track relationships between two data sets 
and the data sets have shared points, combining charts can be a viable 
technique. However, combining data sets that have more than three y-axes 
can become difficult to label let alone read. The key is to keep the data sets 
to three and visually create a shared starting point to compare and contrast 
changes. 
Time-series data is typically displayed as a Line chart, but there are some 
cases in which it is best to display as a Bar chart. The question is: How do 
you pick which one to use? A Line chart tracks the path of a moving point 
with an explicitly defined direction. In contrast, a Bar chart points out the 
stops along the path. To summarize, use a Line chart to point out trends in 
the data and use a Bar chart to show discrete changes and more precisely 
track variations in those changes.  

Funding Ratio    257
Funding Ratio
Fund managers are tasked with mitigating  liability exposures and improving 
funding ratios. The funding ratio data and the data sets related to funding ratio 
are a main focus of pension funds. This section provides useful funding ratio 
charts to showcase how you should display funding data and what types of data 
combinations improve your ability to analyze how the fund is doing. One data 
table is used to help shape the answers to this question: Exhibit A, Funding 
Progress in the CalPERS Annual Report includes the data for all the funds. This 
section focuses on one fund, the PERF, and uses a part of the Funding Progress 
table (Figure 8.38). The same techniques introduced in this section can be used 
to represent the remaining funds.

Figure 8.38  Funding Progress Table
Ten years of funding data in the Funding Progress Table (Figure 8.38) provides 
100 data points (including dates). There are multiple ways to combine 100 data 
points into representative illustrations. However, you need to first consider that 
these data points are essential to representing the overall health of a fund. The 

258    Chapter 8: Pension Funds 
communication for this data set needs to showcase independent points yet also 
combine data sets to compare and contrast.

Figure 8.39  Area Comparison Chart
Line charts can be simple and powerful tools. The immediate understanding of 
time series data as a simple line makes this type of chart frequently used. These 
area charts represent three columns of the table and could be extended so that 
every column in the table would be presented as an area chart. As the critical 
part of the pension fund story, each of the table columns could command their 
own chart. Assets, liabilities, and the market value of assets need to be shown. 
However, you can go beyond these straight representations and overlay the data 
sets, as shown in Figure 8.40. 
Two charts combined into one makes for easier comparisons. Stacked Area 
charts, such as Figure 8.40, layer assets on top of liabilities and share a y-axis 
to reinforce and enable a direct comparison of the data sets. The primary con-
sideration to creating these charts is to thoughtfully select the pairing options. 
Which column headers in the table should be paired? Which values should be set 
to the background and which to the foreground? Area Layer charts succeed when 
you consider the pairing of two data sets, such as assets and liabilities. The next 
charts, as shown in Figure 8.41, pair the remaining data sets with a slight varia-
tion in technique.

Figure 8.40  Stacked Area Charts
A part of delivering a clear visual representation is identifying the data sets that 
need to be bundled and communicated as a package. However, when layering 
data, the views can become obstructed and therefore compromised. Area and 
Line Charts in Figure 8.41 provide a simple solution that reveals crucial aspects 
of the two data sets without obstructions. The combination of an Area chart 
in the background with a Line chart in the foreground is simple yet should be 
executed with a few important details in mind:
▸
▸x-axis and y-axis—In order to pair charts, the x-axis data should be 
shared. When possible, you should aim to pair data sets that can also 
share the y-axis. If the y-axis is shared, gray grid lines can be introduced. 
This approach not only simplifies the comparison, but also creates a pair-
ing that is inherently compatible to relate. 
▸
▸Background versus foreground—Use the background for context and 
the foreground to convey your primary message. The top layer should 

260    Chapter 8: Pension Funds 
display the data set that your audience needs to focus on and follow 
closely. 
▸
▸Line treatment—Change the line treatment to show areas of overlap. 
This small detail helps to delineate when the primary data set is within 
the boundaries of the secondary set.

A close-up view of the funded ratio provides details to better evaluate the 
data. The Ratio Zoom Chart (Figure 8.42) accentuates the variations in value 
between the AVA and MVA data sets. You can clearly see the 25% difference 
between the values in 2009 and contrast this difference with a 0% difference 
just a year prior. 
Next, Figure 8.43 presents an example of combining data sets that do not share

Figure 8.43  Area and Line – Dual Axes Charts
The Area and Line – Dual Axes charts (Figure 8.43) is an example of how you 
can juxtapose two different data sets and contrast the movement of one value 
against another. These two sets are particularly interesting because the subject 
of Annual Covered Payroll is present in both and the units provide insights into 
each data set. The presence of both dollars and percentage provide both abso-
lute and relative context. For example, you can review the 2011 Annual Covered 
Payroll in billions while seeing the percentage of Unfunded Actuarial Accrued 
Liability for the same year.
Combined views, such as those shown next in Figure 8.44, transform the entire 
table data into five charts. Mirroring the table data with paired data sets is a 
technique you can use to tell mini stories about the data. The collection shows a 
consistent correlation between Actuarial Value of Assets and Actuarial Accrued 
Liability, which continues to increase year over year. In contrast, when review-
ing the Actuarial Value of Assets relative to the Market Value of Assets, there is 
a downward trend in the Funded Ratio when reviewing the ten-year span.

Key Take-Aways
The goal for this section is to showcase key data sets surrounding the 
funding ratio and to identify how best to present and combine data views. 
Consolidating two data sets into one view by combining area and line 
chart enables easy comparison while preserving clear differentiation. The 
result of these paired charts is that you can compare, contrast, and/or cor-
relate two data sets. The act of pairing key data sets shows your audience a 
perspective they may not realize on their own. If you do not provide these 
combined views, your audience may easily overlook or not carefully evalu-
ate the data in this way.  

264    Chapter 8: Pension Funds 
Summary
This chapter explored a few data sets within the CalPERS fund to better under-
stand the members, payments, and funding ratio of the plan. Although our 
data set focuses on these three areas, the chart types focuses on two—the Line 
and Bar charts. This chapter expands on the standard Line and Bar chart to 
review how they can be separated, combined, and enhanced to create a more 
understandable story of the data. Bar and Line charts are the most frequently 
used charts, and an understanding of how to extend and when to use each can 
be powerful. 
Throughout, the charts provide ways to untangle data and emphasize individual 
quantities, paired quantities, aggregate totals, and relative and absolute rank 
quantities. New types of Bar charts are introduced to show how to emphasize 
a different aspect of the data. They represent constituents of payments as addi-
tions, deductions, net change, and year-end net position. The full list of visual-
ization solutions include these:

This chapter skims the surface of the CalPERS data set in order to introduce 
new chart types and techniques listed in the preceding table. With a review of 
historical demographic, payment, and funding ratio data to help project, the 
charts are all meant to carefully assess the state of the pension fund for future 
planning. Each chart shows how to curate visualizations by combining and 
contrasting data sets, emphasizing different perspectives, and at times showing 
what the data isn’t directly telling you.

Mutual Funds 
9
According to the International Investment Funds Association, total worldwide mutual 
fund assets have reached an all-time high, approximately $31 trillion (at the start of 
2015), up $7.58 trillion over the previous 3 years. The majority of the mutual fund inves-
tors (approximately 82%) in the United States invest through employer-sponsored retire-
ment plan accounts, and more than 7,900 funds raise assets via employer-sponsored 
retirement programs (source: Investment Company Institute, 2014).
In addition, investors are provided with a range of documentation materials to make 
their mutual fund choices. Available documentation on mutual funds (“Standard Fund 
Documentation”) typically includes the following:
▸
▸Fund fact sheet
▸
▸Summary prospectus
▸
▸Prospectus
▸
▸Statement of additional information
▸
▸One or more annual reports

268    Chapter 9: Mutual Funds 
With data that points to growth in assets under management, growth in num-
ber of investors, and growth in number of funds, documenting and displaying 
fund data in clear, relative terms has never been more crucial.
This list grows if you also include fund analysis provided by third parties such 
as Morningstar, MarketWatch, Bloomberg, and others. This abundance of 
mutual fund choices combined with an overabundance of documentation can 
overwhelm investors. For this reason, visualizations in this chapter are designed 
for 401k plan sponsors and third-party providers to present fund data clearly 
and simply through various digital channels. Mutual fund companies may also 
use the proposed visualizations to portray specific aspects of their funds. 
This chapter analyzes the range of communication methods used to describe a 
mutual fund. We distill these methods to a core set of component visualizations 
for the fund’s allocation profile, fees, performance, and risk. Then we suggest 
how to share these core component visualizations for online digital formats. 
Specifically, we discuss how to apply these visualizations to the context of a new 
type of educational fund fact sheet and suggest how to make use of them in an 
interactive digital display. 
We close the chapter with a system for better comparison across a collection of 
funds. We look at core components and fund documentation from a historical 
perspective. Finally, we offer a comparative graphic study that embeds data 
visualizations into an existing table with varying time intervals. Such embed-
ded visualizations can be used to highlight outliers and rank funds. Because 
today’s investment choices are based on a fund’s capability to provide returns, 
these types of assessments bring clarity to fund comparison and selection. 
All the data in this chapter is hypothetical and is representative of what is 
provided in the marketplace.

Components essential to mutual fund communications include allocations, 
performance, and risk. All fund documents include them. Investment websites

often uses charts to explain them. The shared presence of these data components 
across the various documents, 401k plan sponsor websites, and third-party pro-
viders makes it practical to use a component-based approach to visualizations. 
You can design these data visualizations once and reuse them, disseminating 
them across all of your communications. Because the components can be dis-
tributed across multiple communications, it becomes more important to think 
through the core components and carefully craft each one. The component 
visualizations suggested in this section provide design iterations to highlight 
improvements of a previous chart or highlight alternative options you can use to 
make a different point or to reveal variations between investment schemes. 
Allocation Profile
A fund’s investment style and philosophy result in allocating holdings that 
reflect different percentages for market cap, sector, and region. This allocation 
profile helps to describe where the fund is invested and what you can expect 
to see in terms of its risks and returns. In this way, the allocation profile of the 
mutual fund (shown in Figure 9.1) introduces the fund and sets the stage for 
comparisons. The chart provided compares allocations between a real world 
equity fund we have chosen for illustration (ticker MFSMP) and the average of 
funds in its peer category.

Figure 9.1  Pie Chart

270    Chapter 9: Mutual Funds 
The most popular, but not always the most useful, method to graphically repre-
sent allocations is through the use of pie charts (Figure 9.1). This representation 
may suffice when all that’s needed is a rough allocation assessment, there is no 
need for comparison, and there are a limited number (fewer than four) of slices 
to show. In most cases, however, allocations include more than four categories, 
and their graphic representation must reveal internal variations and compari-
sons with category averages or benchmarks. As Figure 9.1 illustrates, pie charts 
fall short when it comes to revealing slight variations. The same data can be 
displayed with perhaps more success using a stacked bar chart (Figure 9.2).
Is the fund heavily weighted in consumer staples or utilities? What are its market 
cap allocations? Which sectors and regions does it represent? How do its alloca-
tions compare with benchmarks and category averages? The Stacked Bar with 
Table chart (Figure 9.2) provides these answers by aligning visual elements for 
comparison and providing text for explanation. The combination of image and 
text provides speed and precision in one view. 
Of the three allocations, the regional allocations in Figure 9.2 could be repre-
sented more directly with a map. Simple geometric forms can replace carto-
graphic details if all you need is to categorize by continents, which in the next 
example (Figure 9.3) are conveyed through their familiar spatial relationships.
As shown in Figure 9.3, showing proportional distributions in the form of 
colors on a rough map (in this case of the continents of North America, Latin 
America, Greater Europe, and Asia) reveals regional variations at a glance. Is 
there an equal or unbalanced distribution across the regions? Is the fund within 
developed or emerging markets? 
Regional allocation data have the flexibility to be displayed within the  
Stacked Bar chart or the Geometric Map; but with this flexibility come a few 
trade-offs.

Figure 9.3  Geometric Map
The Geometric Map (Figure 9.3) uses color saturation to provide a quick at-a-
glance understanding of the regional allocations. The simplified triangulated 
shapes of the continents are well-suited for scaling down and can convey the 
regional allocations even when considerably reduced in size. In contrast, the use 
of the Stacked Bar chart for the regional data, as shown in Figure 9.2, provides 
consistency across the other data points of market cap and sectors. It also 
provides numeric values and the ability to directly compare specific allocations 
with category averages. 
 In order to offer a historical perspective of the allocations, another option to 
the Geometric Map can provide direct comparisons. Figure 9.4 shows how vari-
ous allocations have changed over time.
The Historical Stacked Bar chart (Figure 9.4) is a natural extension of the 
Stacked Bar chart (Figure 9.2) and shows how a fund’s allocations change over 
time. An interactive display might juxtapose  these figures to show connections, 
for example, between current and previous allocations. Each block’s height 
marks its percentage allocation, revealing steps up or down over time in its 
individual assignment. 
The next example (Figure 9.5) shows how ten sector allocations vary over time.

Figure 9.5  Stacked Bar Groups Chart
Separating the sectors into defensive, sensitive, and cyclical sector groups 
(from top to bottom) enables one to review each allocation more accurately. 
Figure 9.5 gives more information about sector allocations than Figure 9.4 and 
here’s why:
▸
▸Comparative allocation at a category level—Small sets of subcategories 
in each group rely on vertical order to  associate graph layers and table 
row labels, avoiding awkward callout lines. 
▸
▸Alignment to the benchmark and category—Distinct groupings pro-
vide clearer comparisons with benchmarks and category averages.

Core Components    275
▸
▸Reestablished baselines—Maintaining smaller sets of row headers in 
each of the groups’ bar charts resets the starting point for each one. 
In Figure 9.4, 10 sectors must track across 7 points in time, with only 
a single baseline of zero. Giving each sector a different baseline turns 
allocations into constantly moving targets. Figure 9.5 alleviates this 
tracking problem.
Together, these two views can complement each other. You can provide alloca-
tion data both at the summary level (refer to Figure 9.4) as well as the detail 
level (refer to Figure 9.5), or combine them in an interactive solution. The next 
set of charts (Figure 9.6) shows an additional perspective that can be incorpo-
rated into each of the allocation data sets. 
One method to extend your audiences’ understanding of the fund allocations 
is to show offsets from the benchmark and category average. The sorted views 
organize the data display making it easier for you to see what is over-, under-, 
or closely aligned to the benchmark. The varying timeframes of year versus 
quarter are taken into consideration in Figure 9.6. As you zoom in and out 
of the visualization, the treatment of quarters and years stack up to cleanly 
reveal the time interval. Although such variations do not typically appear in 
present-day documents, this is an example of how extending the data view 
can provide an enriched perspective and reveal how a strategy has performed 
over time.

Key Take-Aways
This section questions the traditional method of showing allocations with 
pie charts and instead introduces the Stacked Bar chart, the Geometric 
Map, and the Surface Area Variations to explain the allocation profile of the 
fund. These alternative charts are interoperable and can be used individu-
ally or as a set. In addition, they can scale beyond market cap allocations 
and represent additional views of sector and region.
Fees
Fees have become top of mind for many as the market expands the number of 
mutual fund offerings and investors look for value. This growing sensitivity to 
fee levels results in selective investors carefully reviewing and comparing fee 
structures.  Overall cost structures that include service, transaction, sales load, 
and distribution fees as part of the expense ratio can be a strong marketing tool 
for those with favorable numbers. In this section, we provide various options to 
display fee data. Selecting one version over another will depend on the details 
your audience requires. 
Fund Operating Expenses
The next set of examples examines fund operating expenses in detail. You 
examine how to show fees in comparison to other share classes, category aver-
ages, and category quartiles. 
Fund operating expenses are typically listed as a table of numbers. In Figure 9.7, 
a combined view of such a table along with a Stacked Bar chart displays each 
number in both text and visual format.
While breaking down expenses provides useful details, the “net fees” value 
remains the most important number to note. Hence, the net fees are listed in 
bold as the Total Operating Expenses. To further emphasize total expenses, the 
chart adjusts the starting point, taking reimbursements into consideration. This 
enables you to visually reveal actual total operating expenses in the Stacked Bar 
charts and still provide a net result. Figures 9.8 and 9.9 show ways to simplify 
the fees view and introduce context relative to a peer group of fund classes.

The data shown in the Net Bar chart (Figure 9.8) focuses your attention to the 
total operating expenses. The numbers in percentage listed at the top of each 
bar provides you with a direct answer to the totals. This simplified view removes 
the details and can be suited for a summary view of the data. If presented in a 
digital format, the chart view can expand and show the table details on demand. 
Because share classes are targeted toward different types of investors, investors 
would rather see the details that are pertinent to them. Our next example (Fig-

adding the summary level view will depend on your audience and type of

Expense Ratio
The expense ratio of a fund distills the fund’s operating expenses to one num-
ber. Without context, that one number can seem out of line with expectations 
or experience. A simple way to add perspective and context to the expense 
ratio is by incorporating previous years’ fees, category averages, and category 
quartiles. The next set of charts explores how to best incorporate context to the 
expense ratio number. First, Figure 9.10 provides the historical perspective by 
including the previous years’ expense ratio.

than layering information to the foreground, the next examples layer informa-

Figure 9.11  Context Bar Chart—Quartile Background
Figure 9.11 uses a combination of foreground and background effects to provide 
more perspective and better comparison. Category quartiles, defined as a peer 
category, are represented by graduated blues in the background, giving the sense 
that they provide context to the expense ratio ranges in the foreground. The 
top quartile shown in the darkest blue indicates category data in the top 25%. 
It answers, What is the range of the highest expense ratios for the category? The 
bottom quartile in light blue shows the ranges of the category data below the 
25% mark of the expense ratio data. It answers, What is the range of the lowest 
expense ratios for the category?
The foreground bar chart emphasizes the category average by filling in the 
above average section in black, whereas the below average sections are left as 
dark gray. Is the expense ratio increasing or decreasing? How does it compare to 
the category average and top quartiles? Both of these questions can be answered 
with these two types of treatments as additional data points are introduced to 
the foreground and background. 
The next two charts (in Figure 9.12) experiment with different foreground 
markers to show how each one can communicate a different point.

Figure 9.12  Context Levels Chart—Quartile Background
Different markers can emphasize different points to help you to see the data

variation from the median. The stem markers (reference Figure 9.12) call atten-
tion to the expense ratio points, whereas the step markers identify the levels

with more precision. Because the steps are connected end to end, tracking the 
variation across the years becomes easier to do. Figure 9.13 highlights all three: 
1) the variation from the median, 2) the expense ratio points, and 3) greater 
precision and tracking across the years. It flips the question and changes the 
perspective from one of absolute percentage to one that concentrates on rela-
tive placement.

The background quartiles, as shown in Figure 9.13, are now aligned and mark

y-axis to show percentage, aligns the quartiles to that axis, and results in an 
absolute marked view of the data. In contrast, Figure 9.13 uses the y-axis to list 
the quartiles, layers the percentage within the quartiles, and results in a relative 
perspective of the data. In this way, the relative perspective shows you the varia-
tion from the median. The next example, Figure 9.14, shows a simple adjustment 
to show the trending data.

The replacement of the step markers with connected dots enables you to see  
the connections and trends between each point. In addition, Figure 9.14 illus-
trates the variation from the median and the expense ratio points. In relative 
terms, the expense ratio has increased over the course of 5 years in comparison 
to the peer group. Yet in absolute terms, the actual increase is .02%. This exam-
ple shows that both perspectives of the absolute and relative values are useful to 
review. The two perspectives create a fuller, more informed picture that com-
bines the actual expense ratio and the shifted view relative to category quartiles. 
Key Take-Aways
This section reviews both the total operating expenses and the expense 
ratio across 5 years. From an aggregate list to a historical perspective, 
the different data sets require different visual techniques. For example, 
individual numbers seen in this Fees section provide a mix of negative and 
positive values that impact the total operating expenses. Because of this, 
the chart begins by establishing the negative values as the starting point. 
You can reuse this technique in cases in which you need to show the net 

Core Components    285
results. In contrast, the expense ratio data enables you to track trends in 
context of the category quartiles. Relative and absolute values can provide 
two perspectives on your data. You can apply backgrounds such as the 
quartile background or quartile bands to provide a fuller context to your 
charts. 
Performance
Fund performance is tracked across years to show the enduring ability of the 
fund management team to generate returns. How does the fund’s performance 
returns compare to the category average? What is the 10-year growth of $10K 
invested in the fund? This section goes beyond these typical questions and intro-
duces additional relevant data points to your charts. The sales charge, load, and 
no load category quartiles are additional data points that will be included. First, 
this section starts with one of the most commonly shown charts—Figure 9.15 
shows a line chart.

This rolling ten-year view is common, simple to understand, and often com-
bined with a benchmark, noted in Figure 9.15 as the category average. Without 
a word, you can see how well the fund rebounded after the 2008 crisis. No text 
is required to analyze the alignment in performance to the category average. 
Minimal values are required to orient, see coordinates, and track trends. The 
classic line chart presents time series data well. As a successful communication 
display, the chart is a foundational data visualization that has been in use for 
centuries. 
The familiarity and simplicity of the line chart enables you to do more and 
introduce additional data points for a richer display. How does the sales 
charge decision for your fund impact its growth of investment vis a vis that of 
the category average? This question is answered in the following Line chart 
(Figure 9.16).
The top line chart in Figure 9.16 uses three lines to differentiate the no load, 
load, and category performance, whereas the bottom line chart uses the orange 
fill to highlight the gap between the load and no load. The fill technique simpli-
fies the display and makes it easier for you to track one line instead of three. 
The same data points are shown in both charts, but the messiness of three lines 
(top chart) is replaced with one (bottom chart). Next, Figure 9.17 incorporates 
category context into the chart. 
By using the fill technique in this figure, the quartile data is stacked in the 
background for additional context and shows a full category perspective of the 
fund’s growth. You can see how close a fund tracks to the category average as 
well as the range of the other quartiles. The next example (Figure 9.18) adjusts 
the coordinate system of the chart with different values in the y-axis.

Figure 9.17  Context Line Chart—Quartile Background
Figure 9.18 uses the same data points as Figure 9.17 yet both provide differ-
ent perspectives. The former delineates the contextual data with an absolute 
perspective of the data, whereas the latter does so with a relative perspective. 
If you would like to see the variation the fund experienced from the average, 
Figure 9.18 shows a clearer depiction of the data. If you would rather compare 
the variation of the fund to its peer quartiles, Figure 9.17 shows a better com-
munication tool. 
The next series of charts apply the same techniques to trailing return data. 
The visualizations, starting with Figure 9.19, builds on the commonly used bar 
chart. How well has the fund performed in the last month, year, or 5 years? How 
do these returns compare to the category average? You can answer both of these 
questions with Figure 9.19.

With a large number of funds to select from, the data points shown in Fig-

of the returns. Yet again, the visualizations can provide more context by using 
the same approach shown in the Growth of $10,000 chart and the Expense 
Ratio chart. The next example (Figure 9.20) incorporates more data into the

Figure 9.20  Context Bar Chart—Quartile Background
Similar to a map that layers streets in the context of terrain, Figure 9.20 layers 
returns in the context of category quartiles. The chart displays the returns 
and the context of the rank of those returns. For example, although the fund 
provided negative returns in the 3-month time mark, the quartile perspective 
shows it performed within the top quartile during that time. All funds delivered 
negative returns in the recent 3-month timeframe and positive returns across 
the longer 10-year periods. You can show both how the fund performs and how 
well it performs in context to all others. With the percent returns on the y-axis, 
the chart is a return-centric view of the data. You can see the fund’s actual 
returns. In contrast, Figure 9.21 maps the trailing returns to the quartile bands.

Both Figures 9.20 and 9.21 are useful in evaluating the actual returns in com-
parison to the peer relative returns, and together the charts provide a more 
complete perspective of the fund’s performance. There is no doubt that the peer 
group context is important to include as the mutual fund market bids for atten-
tion. As a communication tool, a collection of charts (Figure 9.22) can be used 
to compare, explain, and even perhaps justify results.

Absolute vs. Relative Values Comparison
Figure 9.22  Absolute and Relative Pairing Chart
Across fees, 10-year growth, and trailing returns, the charts introduced cat-
egory data as quartiles and produced views to showcase the numeric values 
in absolute terms and relative terms. As a collection, the Absolute & Relative 
Pairing (Figure 9.22) can be used to tell a multifaceted story. Visualizing and 
placing both absolute and relative charts into one view ensures a well-rounded 
perspective is provided.

Key Take-Aways
The benefits listed in each type of visualization show how coupling 
absolute and relative views can provide a richer perspective of the data. In 
Figure 9.22 the charts not only juxtapose absolute and relative views, but 
also ground them with the same reference bands of the category quartiles. 
By using the quartile backdrops in both sets of visuals, you can orient and 
compare absolute and relative values. As noted, both views show the 
placement of the actual value within the quartiles to be compared and 
contrasted. 
Although the charts (Figures 9.15–9.22) use a category average comparison 
data point, you can elect to use other comparison data points. For example, you 
can compare the fund data to a market benchmark with the same visualization 
techniques as shown in Figure 9.22.
Risk
Volatility, upside/downside capture, beta, Sharpe Ratio, R2 levels and other 
statistical measurements are some of the numeric tools you can use to evaluate 

294    Chapter 9: Mutual Funds 
investment risk in a mutual fund. This section addresses these key risk indicators 
that are typically presented in documentation materials distributed to the public. 
You can improve the visuals to track risk in context of the category average, bench-
mark, and market for better comparison. With the market upside capture set to 
100 by virtue of it being the benchmark, how might we show the fund’s upside and 
downside capture ratio of the market’s movements? How might we show the capture 
ratio data across the years? This section investigates and resolves these questions. 
Upside/Downside Capture
The upside capture ratio shows how much of the market gain the fund captured 
when the market rose while the downside capture shows how much of the mar-
ket loss the fund suffered when the market declines (i.e., did the fund provide 
some downside protection?). However, if you compare a fund across years or if 
you compare a set of funds for the same year, you may have additional ques-
tions. Which fund/year provides a greater tendency toward a beneficial upside 
or downside capture ratio? How closely aligned is the fund to similar capture 
experiences of the category average? Figure 9.23 shows the fund and market 
reference points to compare above or below market capture.

Similar to a laser pointer, the Upside/Downside Capture Points chart (Fig-
ure 9.23) projects both the angle and the end points onto a marked graph back-
ground. The combination of both the points and the angle enables you to assess 
just how far above or below the capture point the fund lies. The color use and 
labels provide the details to distinguish the fund from the index representing 
market movements. Figure 9.24 illustrates how you can include category average 
into the chart.

If you zoom into the display, (as shown with the image on the right of Fig-

chart provides details only a zoomed-in display can provide. From a distance, 
both captures look similar, but upon closer inspection, the gaps stand out easily. 
The next visual inspects how the upside and downside capture has changed over 
time. Figure 9.25 shows side-by-side views of the years’ captures to compare 
how a fund has adjusted and responded.

Again, the zoomed-in technique across the years enables you to see the differ-
ences more clearly. The category average points are rendered in gray and shadow 
the upside capture in blue and downside capture in orange. By presenting the 
data with foreground and background colors, you can focus your attention on the 
changes year over year. Where are the capture points across the years and what 
are the overall trends or tendencies of the fund? Figure 9.25 answers our questions 
regarding historical capture points but falls short on visualizing the trend data. 
The next set of visualizations explores how to show both trends and tendencies 
so that we see not only the capture points across the years, but we also see the 
overall capture tendency of the fund in one view. Figure 9.26 uses the dial meta-
phor and replaces the capture points with measurement levels.
Dials, knobs, meters, and gauges are measurement tools that can show levels 
of various amounts. The Dial Gauge visually answers the upside and downside 
capture question and introduces a third and fourth question: What level is the 
midpoint of the capture? And does the midpoint fall to the north or south of the 
zero line? The arrow marks the midpoint to indicate the fund’s capture ten-
dency. Next, Figure 9.27 shows how to include additional data points for further 
reference.

Figure 9.27 improves on Figure 9.26 by layering in category average data points. 
The inner black radius line reveals upside, downside, and midpoint captures 
for the category average. The visual now incorporates six total data points and 
explicitly labels four of them. Gray numerals label the category upside and 
downside capture points, and color ones label the fund data. 
The six dial data points afford better comparison. For example within the fund 
you can see the ranges and midpoints. In addition, you can use a collection of 
Comparison Dials (as referenced in Figure 9.28) to compare and quickly show 
capture results.
The dials (refer to Figure 9.28) can be read from the outside moving toward the 
center; the outside provides more summary level information, whereas the cen-
ter lists the detail information. 
▸
▸Summary level—The outside notch shows trend data of where the 
capture midpoint falls. So from the outset, you can assess the fund as a 
down or up capture fund. The colors reinforce the upside and downside 
levels, and overall the system is flexible enough to show below zero and 
beyond 200. 
▸
▸Midlevel—The category radius line (shown in black) provides compari-
son to the category average data. The fund’s midpoint notch shows align-
ment or misalignment to the category. 
▸
▸Detail level—The center provides the reader with the details to the 
actual numeric values. As reinforcement to the visuals, the text shows 
the exact upside and downside values that are harder to extract from the 
chart alone. 
The next visualization (Figure 9.29) layers in more details to show a histori-
cal perspective of the capture data. It incorporates yearly details within the 
Comparison Dial to see a clearer view of past captures. This new treatment 
transforms the Comparison Dial visualization and grows six data points in Fig-
ure 9.27 to show 16 data points in Figure 9.29.

Figure 9.29  Temporal Dial Chart
The blue gradients (refer to Figure 9.29) progressively show how the captures 
have evolved across the time periods. Complemented with category midpoint 
markers (dotted lines), the marked directive arrows help you answer: Does the 
fund tend to fall within the downside or upside capture across the years? Holisti-
cally, the chart enables you to assess the capture profile of the fund. The refer-
ence points of time, peer comparison, and midpoints together create the overall 
capture profile to better track trends. 
Although Figure 9.29 is comprehensive, it may take time to review. The next 
visualization aims to provide you with a simplified version. The quadrants 
approach (Figure 9.30) consolidates the upside/downside capture points and 
replaces the midpoint.

Figure 9.30  Dot Link Quadrant Chart
Mapping the upside and downside capture within quadrants, as shown in Fig-
ure 9.30, removes the need to mark the midpoint. Instead, you need to review 
only the quadrant placement and movement across the years. The upside and 
downside quadrant location is complemented with the associated values listed 
within the table. The quadrant approach enables you to notice the following:
▸
▸Rank—The quadrant system makes it easy to identify best and worst 
outcomes to distinguish top and bottom rank.
▸
▸Tendency—The consistent or inconsistent placement across the four 
sections is an indicator of the fund’s tendency. If the captures map 

302    Chapter 9: Mutual Funds 
consistently to the same quadrant, you can say the fund has a tendency 
toward the identified section.
▸
▸Offset—The lines that connect the fund to the category average show you 
just how offset the two are from each other. You can analyze how the fund 
closely aligns, forges ahead, or trails behind the category average.
Rank, tendency, and offset are the significant attributes you can track with the Cap-
ture Quadrants chart. To improve the prominence of these attributes even further, 
you can tilt the chart (as shown in Figure 9.31) to make the results indisputable.

Figure 9.31  Dot Link Quadrant Tilt Chart

Core Components    303
What year yielded the best capture ratio combination? And how did it compare 
to the category average? The 45-degree tilt (Figure 9.31) conveys the top captures 
by emphasizing the top center as the best. You can decide to be more prefer-
ential or sensitive to downside or upside capture. Marks to the right show a 
preference toward aversion to risk, whereas marks to the left show a preference 
toward greater opportunity gains. Therefore, the Quadrant Tilt becomes a use-
ful tool for seeing how stable the fund is and if the fund has more of a tendency 
to provide up or downside capture. 
Alpha, Beta, Sharpe Ratio, and Sortino Ratio Combination
Alpha, Beta, Sharpe Ratio, and Sortino Ratio are key risk metrics that are often 
listed in a fund’s marketing materials. As a set, the metrics provide a more holistic 
view of a fund’s risk profile. However, similar to previous examples in this chapter, 
the visualizations, like Figure 9.32, work best with the addition of relevancy.

Beta charts track two levels, the Sharpe/Sortino ratio tracks three levels each 
year. The Sortino Ratio is shown as a background fill for context. Figure 9.33

How aligned is the fund’s risk level to the category average? How wide is the 
spread? Which spreads are above the industry average, and which spreads are 
below? Figure 9.33 not only shows the spreads but also shows the direction of 
the spread. You can scan the chart just to see what is above or below the bench-
mark. Contrasting color shows the direction (blue for above average and yellow 
for below average) and height shows the size of the spread, removing your effort 
to make those assessments.

R2 levels
The R2 levels can explain the degree to which movements in the fund are 
attributed to movements in the benchmark index. Figure 9.34 uses a pie chart 
to show just how closely aligned they are to the benchmark across different 
timeframes.

R2 Levels
Figure 9.34  Pie Fill Chart
Why show the R2 levels in a radial format over a linear format? As a single 
number (refer to Figure 9.34), the radial form provides you with a better under-
standing of each year’s offsets from the benchmark. For example, the high 
correlation of 98 shows a thin sliver of a gap, whereas the low correlation of 43 
shows the level has not made it beyond the 50 mark. The white space in the pie 
shows the gap and how far off the fund is to the benchmark. The turn in the pie 
beyond the 50 mark is important to note and easy to see in a radial format. Your 
eyes can detect straight lines versus lines drawn at an angle; the Pie Fill takes 
advantage of this capability. In contrast, a square shape would not easily show a 
fill slightly over or under the 50% mark. The Pie Fill visualization enables you to 
see if the value is slightly over or under the 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% mark. Your 
ability to detect straight edges and accurately estimate the percentage is the 
reason why R2 levels are best shown in a radial format.
Sharpe Ratio
The next set of charts study the Sharpe Ratio more closely and provide compari-
son points to the benchmark, risk free rate, and time, as well as categorical suc-
cess metrics. This section starts by showing how the Sharpe Ratio is commonly

Is the fund and benchmark above or below the Sharpe Ratio = 1 line? With the 
familiar Return/Standard Deviation coordinate system (refer to Figure 9.35), 
the chart places the fund’s ratio and benchmark ratio in context of the risk-free 
rate. Figure 9.35 is a primer for incorporating a historical perspective to the 
next visualization. The Dot Link Temporal Collection (Figure 9.36) enables you 
to inspect the time continuum with the benchmark values for each year. 
Over time, which fund shows better returns for the same risk? The line indicating 
the Sharpe Ratio of 1 is drawn in the background and provides a consistent refer-
ence line across all funds. The story for each fund varies but the setting remains 
the same. The progression over the years, 10, 5, 3, and 1 from the light blue to dark 
blue highlights the most current time frame of 1 year in dark blue and the 10-year 
time frame as light blue. The MFSPM chart (within Figure 9.36) tells the story of 
how the fund has increased its risk metric in comparison to the benchmark. In 
contrast, the FLCSX chart (within Figure 9.36) shows how the Sharpe Ratio has 
improved over time and aligned consistently to the benchmark.

308    Chapter 9: Mutual Funds 
To gain a proper understanding of the fund-to-benchmark ratio relationship, 
you need to be aware that in this coordinate system (Figure 9.37), the ratio is 
represented as an angle. The chart explains:
▸
▸Benchmark line—The position of the benchmark and the risk-free rate 
determines the corresponding Sharpe ratio benchmark line. The bench-
mark line is marked with a short, bold black line. 
▸
▸Connected arc—The benchmark line is connected to the fund ratio with 
an arc. The arc shows the difference between the respective benchmark 
(S&P500) and Fund (MFSMP). 
Relative to the fund ratio, how does the benchmark compare? If the fund followed 
the same benchmark threshold, what is the ratio the fund should strive to beat? 
These questions can be answered with the Sharpe Ratio Arc. Another way to 
explain the answer to these questions is through Figure 9.38, Arc Connection.

Sharpe Ratio Comparison
Figure 9.39  Arc Collection
A review of three fund’s Sharpe Ratios shows a clearer connection to the 
benchmark. Similar to the previous two charts, Figure 9.39 illustrates the ratio 
benchmark line as an anchor to join the connected arc. The Sharpe Ratio Arcs 
answer key questions: 
▸
▸Does the fund have a history of being above or below the Sharpe Ratio 
equal to 1 line? 
▸
▸Does the fund benchmark have a history of being above or below the 
Sharpe Ratio equal to 1 line? 
▸
▸Is the fund positioned better relative to the Sharpe Ratio equal to 1 line 
than its benchmark? 

310    Chapter 9: Mutual Funds 
▸
▸How close is the fund tracking to the benchmark?
▸
▸How do the funds compare to each other? 
Yet, although the chart can answer these types of relative questions, you can 
still layer in more context into the background. Figure 9.40 illustrates this point.

Sharpe Ratio Comparison
Figure 9.40  Sharpe Ratio Arc Bands Collection
Did the fund make it into the good, very good, or excellent bands of risk adjusted 
returns? The Sharpe Ratio Arc Bands (Figure 9.40) adds these three aspirational 
categories to the background of the chart. The fill between 1–2 represents a 
good Sharpe Ratio, 2–3 very good, and greater than 3 represents excellent with 
the lightest blue band. Because the color bands represent one-half the chart, it 
makes it much clearer to see if the fund made or missed the threshold. 
Risk Components
Your perception of how well a fund is managing risk can largely be based on 
your understanding of the data. Although the previous section focuses on 

Core Components    311
charting ideas for each risk metric, this section focuses on combining those risk 
charts (as shown in Figure 9.41).

Figure 9.41  Multiple Views Collection
Multiple views of key risk metrics in one display can provide you with a wider 
understanding of how the fund is managing risk. The historical views across 
alpha, R2, beta, returns/standard deviation, Sharpe Ratio, and upside and down-
side capture can help you expand your view further to track trends and com-
pare against the category average. The collection paints a more complete story 
of how the various risk metrics are congruent or point toward an exception. You 
can review the exceptions in the story to inspect and ask, “Why this result?” 
The Multiple Views approach is a good start to assessing and managing risk for 
a fund. It collects multiple charts all centered on one aspect of the fund, in this 
case, risk. The approach is flexible and scalable to display different risk metrics 
or include more risk metrics to make the display more comprehensive. 
Key Take-Aways
The variety of risk metrics covered in this section produce a variety of data 
visualization solutions. The upside/downside capture metric is illustrated 
with Pointer, Dial Gauge, and Dot Line Quadrant charts to show the cap-
ture tendency of the fund. R2 values are shown as a Pie Fill. Alpha, beta, 
and Sharpe Ratio are illustrated with a Context Bar to highlight spreads 

312    Chapter 9: Mutual Funds 
from the category average. This section reviewed the Sharpe Ratio more 
closely, resulting in the Arc chart that provides a comparable benchmark 
target. The techniques vary because purposes and data differ. Study each 
risk metric. Perhaps the most powerful visualization is the Multiple Views 
(Figure 9.41): A compilation of key risk metrics provides a more complete 
assessment of risk.
Fund Fact Sheets
Fund fact sheets are one of the most commonly viewed documents and are 
often listed as the first document to reference online. Once accessed, readers 
will find that the two-page document is challenged to succinctly communicate 
the basic fund information. The data within the fund fact sheet overlaps with 
many other documents and, as marketing material, it is typically the most 
visual. The next fact sheet examples use the existing data, replace charts with 
new components, and update the layout to enhance the readability of the quan-
titative information. The new educational fund fact sheet embraces transpar-
ency and includes visual components that explain the fund. 
The existing Fund Fact Sheets (Figure 9.42) reference the data sets in tables and 
text and use just a few basic charts to display the data. As blocks of content, the 
fact sheets mix both graphics and text in no particular order across the pages. 
One fund fact sheet may present the top ten holdings and sector weights on 
the first page; another fact sheet will present these on the second page. One 
fund fact sheet will present data in a table; another will present the same data 
as a chart. Despite variations between fact sheets, most use the same types of 
data and charts. In general, they tend to limit the visualizations. The fund sheet 
examples in Figure 9.42, for example, show 1–2 charts per fact sheet. 
Figure 9.43 replaces a few content blocks of a typical fund fact sheet with the 
newly designed components presented earlier in the chapter.

The Fund follows an opportunistic core 
approach and employs a disciplined 
process to select stocks across numerous 
sectors, styles, and market capitalizations. 
The fund utilizes global research platform 
to identify investment opportunities that 
are attractive from both a quantitative and 
a fundamental perspective. Investments 
may be concentrated in a relatively small 
number of sectors.
Bond: A debt security (IOU) issued by a 
corporation, government, or government 
agency in exchange for the money the 
bondholder lends it. In most instances, the 
issuer agrees to pay back the loan by a 
speciﬁc date and make regular interest 
payments until that date.
Dividends: A payment of cash or stock 
from a company’s earnings to each 
stockholder as declared by the company’s 
board of directors.
Expenses: The costs of running a fund, 
expressed as a percentage of the fund’s 
assets. For example, a fund may have 
expenses that total 0.30% (less than half 
of 1%) of its assets.
Interest: Payments made by a company, 
a government, or a government agency to 
investors who lend them money. For 
example, an investor buys a bond from a 
company, which agrees to pay back the 
loan by a certain date at a set rate.
Mutual fund: An investment company 
that pools the money of many shareholders 
and invests it in a variety of securities in an 
effort to achieve a speciﬁc objective over 
time.
Total return: The change in the net 
asset value of an investment, assuming 
reinvestment of all dividend and capital 
gain distributions.
Investment strategy
The fund invests 60% to 70% of its assets in dividend-paying, and, to a lesser extent, 
non-dividend-paying common stocks of established medium-size and large companies. In 
choosing these companies, the advisor seeks those that appear to be undervalued but to 
have prospects for improvement. These stocks are commonly referred to as value stocks. 
The remaining 30% to 40% of fund assets are invested mainly in investment-grade 
corporate bonds, with some exposure to U.S. Treasury and government agency bonds, as 
well as mortgage-backed securities.gain distributions.
Investment objective
The Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation and reasonable current income.
The performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of 
future results. Investment returns and principal value will ﬂuctuate, so investors’ shares, 
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may 
be lower or higher than the performance data cited. For performance data current to the 
most recent month-end, visit our website.
Figures for periods of less than one year are cumulative returns. All other ﬁgures 
represent average annual returns. Performance ﬁgures include the reinvestment of all 
dividends and any capital gains distributions. All returns are net of expenses.
Composite Index: 65% S&P 500 Index and 35% Long Credit AA or Better Index through 
February 29, 2012; 65% S&P 500 Index and 35% U.S. Credit A or Better Index 
thereafter.
Who should invest
•  Investors seeking long-term growth of 
capital and income.
•  Investors with a long-term investment 
horizon (at least ﬁve years).
•  Investors seeking moderate dividend 
income.
Who should not invest
•  Investors unwilling to accept signiﬁcant 
ﬂuctuations in share price.

The fund is subject to several stock and bond market risks, any of which could cause an 
investor to lose money. However, because stock and bond prices can move in different 
directions or to different degrees, the fund’s bond and short-term investment holdings 
may counteract some of the volatility experienced by the fund’s stock holdings. The 
fund’s performance could be hurt by:
Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend 
to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.
Investment style risk: The chance that returns from large- and mid-capitalization 
stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, these stocks have been 
more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and 
they often perform quite differently.
Interest rate risk: The chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising 
interest rates.
Income risk: The chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest 
rates.
Credit risk: The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest and principal in a 
timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments 
will cause the price of that bond to decline.
Call risk: The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, the issuer of a bond 
will repay - or call - securities with higher coupons, or interest rates, before their maturity 
dates. Forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, the fund 
would experience a decline in income and lose the opportunity for additional price 
appreciation associated with falling interest rates.
Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to 
underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.
The performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of

Gross Expense Ratio is the fund's 
total operating expense ratio from the 
fund's most recent prospectus.
Net Expense Ratio reﬂects the 
reduction of expenses from fee waivers 
and reimbursements. Elimination of these 
reductions will result in higher expenses 
and lower performance.
The Fund seeks to provide long-term 
capital appreciation.

The fund may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose money on your investment in 
the fund. Stock markets and investments in individual stocks are volatile and can decline 
signiﬁcantly in response to issuer, market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, 
geopolitical, and other conditions. The fund's performance could be more volatile than 
the performance of more diversiﬁed funds. The fund's performance may be closely tied to 
the performance of companies in a limited number of sectors and could be more volatile 
than the performance of less focused funds. Please see the prospectus for further 
information on these and other risk considerations.
Before investing, consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. 
Contact your investment professional or visit our website for a prospectus or, if available, 
a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

The Fund follows an opportunistic core approach and employs a disciplined process to 
select stocks across numerous sectors, styles, and market capitalizations. The fund 
utilizes global research platform to identify investment opportunities that are attractive 
from both a quantitative and a fundamental perspective. Investments may be 
concentrated in a relatively small number of sectors.
The performance data shown represent past 
performance, which is not a guarantee of future 
results. Investment returns and principal value 
will ﬂuctuate, so investors’ shares, when sold, 
may be worth more or less than their original 
cost. Current performance may be lower or 
higher than the performance data cited. For 
performance data current to the most recent 
month-end, visit our website.
Figures for periods of less than one year are 
cumulative returns. All other ﬁgures represent 
average annual returns. Performance ﬁgures 
include the reinvestment of all dividends and 
any capital gains distributions. All returns are 
net of expenses.
The Fund seeks to provide long-term 
capital appreciation.

Figure 9.43  Fund Fact Sheet – Integrated Components
While you cannot completely replace text with visuals, the document as shown in 
Figure 9.43 replaces text blocks with integrated components, each of which includes 
both visuals and values. Instead of one chart, the fund fact sheet now shows 11. 
Each component is independent and can be replaced without a big impact on the 
overall layout. The only caveat is that the component dimensions should match.
The layout and location of each of the data sets (in Figure 9.43) has not changed 
from the previous fund fact sheet. Within the same allocated space, the layout 
augments the data with supporting charts to tell a richer story of the fund. You 
can see the fund profile and understand the risk metrics. Each component attracts 
your attention and encourages you to inspect the information more closely. 
The modular system of swapping out text blocks with integrated components 
can continue even further. Without much disruption to the rest of the fund fact

sheet, you can change how you design and communicate a data set. Figure 9.44 
shows a slight update to a component, using the modular system approach.

Figure 9.44  Fund Fact Sheet – Updated Components
Exactly what has changed between Figures 9.43 and 9.44? It is hard to tell. The 
updated components in the fund fact sheet maintain the order and integrity of 
the layout. Figure 9.44 simply uses different components for Sector Weightings 
and World Regions. The slight change is not disruptive to the layout. 
The next Fund Fact Sheet design (Figure 9.45) suggests an alternative layout to 
the fund fact sheet so that you can follow the content in an orderly way. It does 
disrupt the layout by rethinking it all together and considers this question: 
What might be a better way of designing the overall layout of the fund fact sheet 
so that it works better on paper and in a future digital solution?

The Fund follows an opportunistic core approach and employs a 
disciplined process to select stocks across numerous sectors, styles, 
and market capitalizations. The fund utilizes global research platform 
to identify investment opportunities that are attractive from both a 
quantitative and a fundamental perspective. Investments may be 
concentrated in a relatively small number of sectors.
The performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of future 
results. Investment returns and principal value will ﬂuctuate, so investors’ shares, when sold, 
may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or 
higher than the performance data cited. For performance data current to the most recent 
month-end, visit our website.
Figures for periods of less than one year are cumulative returns. All other ﬁgures represent 
average annual returns. Performance ﬁgures include the reinvestment of all dividends and any 
capital gains distributions. All returns are net of expenses. Performance results do not include 
adjustments made for ﬁnancial reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles and may differ from amounts reported in the ﬁnancial highlights.
The Fund seeks to provide long-term 
capital appreciation.
Summary of Results
For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, Class A shares of the 
Equity Opportunities Fund provided a total return of 41.3%     , at net 
asset value. This compares with a return of 32.4% for the fund’s 
benchmark, the S&P 500 Index.
Contributors to Performance
Strong stock selection in the special products & services sector was a 
positive factor for performance relative to the S&P 500 Index. Within 
this sector, an overweight position in payment solutions provider       
Core Technologies       and the fund’s holdings of education service 
provider Grand Laurel Education boosted relative results as both 
stocks turned in strong performance over the period. Bronco 
Technologies traded higher during the period, led by sales and 
earnings growth which exceeded 20% for the sixth consecutive 
quarter. The growth was partly attributed to successful acquisitions, 
including New Zealand based CardLink, and strong partnerships with 
ﬁrms such as Shell’s Global Commercial Fleet business.
Detractors from Performance
Stock selection in the energy sector hindered relative performance. 
Within this sector, the fund’s timing of ownership in shares of 
petroleum reﬁning and transportation company Marathon Oil       and 
independent oil reﬁner Bolerro Energy weakened relative 
performance. In addition, holdings of oil company Energy XXI 
(Bermuda) held back relative results.
Stocks in other sectors that held back relative results included the 
fund’s holdings of air cargo and aircraft operation solutions provider 
Atlas Worldwide Holdings, an overweight position in television and 
internet provider Border Communications      , holdings of sports 
apparel retailer Cumiez and an overweight allocation early in the 
period to infrastructure management software developer Solarwinds. 
Early in the period, Border Communications reported 
lower-than-expected earnings due to a decline in voice revenues 
which appeared to have driven the stock lower. During the reporting 
period, the fund’s relative currency exposure, resulting primarily from 
differences between the fund’s and the benchmark’s exposures to 
holdings of securities denominated in foreign currencies, was another 
detractor from relative performance. All of The Firms investment 
decisions are driven by the fundamentals of each individual 
opportunity and as such, it is common for our funds to have different 
currency exposure than the benchmark.

Fund Fact Sheets    317
Fund Manager Commentary 
Looking back at the ﬁscal year, we outperformed a very strong 19% 
return for the S&P 500 with leading performance from the ﬁnancials 
and information technology sectors. We still ﬁnd these two sectors to 
be attractively valued, and they currently represent a combined 47% of 
our portfolio      . For the ﬁscal year, 26 of the Oakmark Fund’s 
holdings gained over 30%, and only Apple declined by more than 
20%. Despite Apple’s poor full ﬁscal year performance, it was one of 
the Fund’s top two performers for the third quarter, gaining 21%. After 
a period of skepticism surrounding the company’s ability to create 
compelling new products, Apple is once again experiencing strong 
demand for its recently introduced iPhones     . We remain pleased that 
the company is allocating more of their $145B cash balance to share 
repurchases and dividends     . Throughout the market, even as equity 
valuations have increased, we are still ﬁnding attractive opportunities 
in businesses with strong balance sheets           , high free cash ﬂow, 
and a management committed to return a substantial portion of excess 
capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Strategic and Tactical Allocations 
Although equity markets moved higher in the quarter, we found 
opportunities to make new additions to the Fund, adding three U.S. 
and two European holdings. The ﬁrst name alphabetically is Bank of 
America     . For years, Bank of America was the poster child for all that 
was troubling about banks. But like the industry as a whole, we believe 
Bank of America has made tremendous progress simplifying and 
“de-risking” its business. For instance, in just the past few quarters it 
has gone from being one of the worst capitalized big banks to one of 
the best. (For perspective, the company’s tangible common equity ratio 
is 64% higher than it was in 2006, which was before the crisis           ). 
Management also took advantage of lowered investor expectations as 
an opportunity to invest heavily in systems technology and 
rationalization. Investors have rewarded the company for its progress 
and brought the stock up from its lows. However, it is still being valued 
at a sizeable discount to its peers. In our view, the discount derives 
both from stale perceptions of the relative risk proﬁle, but also because 
Bank of America’s near- term earnings are more depressed than its 
peers. We expect this discount to close with time, as investors 
reevaluate the “new” Bank of America and its proﬁtability catches up.
Risk Considerations
Portfolio characteristics are based on equivalent exposure, which 
measures how a portfolio's value would change due to price changes 
in an asset held either directly or, in the case of a derivative contract, 
indirectly.  The fund may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose 
money on your investment in the fund. Stock markets and investments 
in individual stocks are volatile and can decline signiﬁcantly in response 
to issuer, market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, 
and other conditions     . The fund's performance could be more 
volatile than the performance of more diversiﬁed funds. The fund's 
performance may be closely tied to the performance of companies in a 
limited number of sectors and could be more volatile than the 
performance of less focused funds     . Please see the prospectus for 
further information on these and other risk considerations.
Before investing, consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, 
charges, and expenses. Contact your investment professional or visit 
our website for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus 
containing this information. Read it carefully.
The performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of future 
results. Investment returns and principal value will ﬂuctuate, so investors’ shares, when sold, 
may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or 
higher than the performance data cited. For performance data current to the most recent 
month-end, visit our website.
Figures for periods of less than one year are cumulative returns. All other ﬁgures represent 
average annual returns. Performance ﬁgures include the reinvestment of all dividends and any 
capital gains distributions. All returns are net of expenses.

Fund Fact Sheets

318    Chapter 9: Mutual Funds 
The newly designed Fund Fact Sheet (Figure 9.45) now has both updated com-
ponents and layout. The communication is now organized for you to review the 
quantitative data to the left and the qualitative data to the right. The numerated 
markers (black circles) within the set connect the two points and provide you 
with the linked connection points between the visual on one side and the text 
on the other. This provides you with the opportunity to review each component 
independently and read the associated explanation. Although the layout has 
a distinct two-column structure, the organizing principle supports the tradi-
tional flow of a left to right, top to bottom structure. In addition, the layout still 
enables you to reorder or replace and update components without disrupting 
the layout.
Key Take-Aways
The redesigned educational fund fact sheet provides more flexibility for 
both the producer and the consumer of the information. As the producer, 
you can replace or add components without a disruption to the layout. 
You can create your own visual story of the fund. As a consumer of the 
sheet, you can scan through the charts without interference, or alternate 
between viewing the charts and reading the text. The two columns that 
separate the visuals from the text permit this flexibility. 
Mutual Fund Comparison
This section takes spreadsheets and tables of fund return data and transforms 
them into tables with embedded visualizations. The chief investment officer 
(CIO) can showcase a review of the firm’s capacity to provide returns to its 
investors by investing client assets in well-chosen mutual funds. A third-party 
analysis provider can confidently share a short-listed set of funds. The inves-
tor can review a set of funds. Across these three audiences, the focus of the 
analysis is largely a comparative one. In one case, comparison helps to rank the 
fund list and create a short list of fund candidates, and in another case, you can 

Mutual Fund Comparison    319
make a selection. Because comparison is the goal, this section incorporates new 
techniques for comparing total returns and expense ratios as well as returns in 
comparison to a benchmark.
Total Returns 
Total annual returns are the main focus of many mutual fund investments, and 
when paired with the expense ratio, you have a balanced view of value. In this 
section we discuss both of these data sets and show how to incorporate each 
one into a table. How do you track total returns as they relate to YTD, 1YR, 5YR, 
and 10YR data? How do you include expense ratio data? Figure 9.46 illustrates 
a prototypical reproduction of a mutual fund list that neatly organizes 10 col-
umns of data and 43 funds into 3 categories of Stock Funds, Asset Allocation 
Strategies, and Global/International Funds.
The Mutual Fund Table (Figure 9.46) is a perfect candidate for incorporating 
data visualization techniques to make the assessment process less painful and 
possible. For example, if the four data points within the Average Annual Total 
Returns (%) were visualized in terms of average annual total percentage returns, 
the core data set could become more comprehensible. Figure 9.47 shows how 
this might be done. It introduces the Ribbon technique to mark the average 
annual returns for each time marker.
The Ribbon is a flexible visual technique that provides you with an informative 
view of the return data points. The blue Ribbon (shown in Figure 9.47) marks 
the 1Y, 5Y, and 10Y timeframes, whereas the black dot marks YTD. As shown 
in the second row of Figure 9.47, the Ribbon can and does fold on top of itself 
to mark a directional change. With the wide point at the 10Y mark and the tip 
at the 1Y mark, the Ribbon also doubles as a tool to see trends and point direc-
tional movement. The length of each Ribbon segment is another indicator of 
how much the fund has moved between the time spans.

Figure 9.48  Label Consolidation

322    Chapter 9: Mutual Funds 
There are a number of tactical label adjustments that have been made to the 
table to consolidate and streamline the table data. Figure 9.48 adjusts labels to:
▸
▸Remove redundancies—The original Max Sales Charge column is a data 
set with largely repetitive data. The table has removed this repeated local 
value with a global note at the top left stating that the Sales charge is 
5.75%. This results in one less column.
▸
▸Relocate and readjust—The fund category label has been removed as a 
row header and relocated to the left of the fund list. Shown at 90 degrees, 
the Bond Funds label is still legible. This results in three fewer rows. 
▸
▸Reuse and reduce—The fund column incorporates the inception date 
of the fund as secondary data to consolidate two columns into one. In 
addition, the column header for each time period serves as the dot and 
Ribbon legend—to serve as a legend and a column header— and a dual-
purpose label. 
The effort to consolidate has provided more space to incorporate visuals into 
the data table. In addition, you can focus your attention on the core data points 
and simply be aware of other data points as needed. Although the label consoli-
dation effort is a tactical redesign effort, it is an essential one to integrate the 
Ribbon visualization. 
Now you may notice that the expense ratio data columns have not been 
incorporated. Next, the full data set is combined to show the expense ratios 
as embedded visuals into a table. With the addition of this data, the table (Fig-
ure 9.49) is complete and useful for the firm’s management, third-party provid-
ers, or investors to compare and rank.

Mutual Fund Comparison Sheet
Figure 9.49  Ribbon Comparison

324    Chapter 9: Mutual Funds 
Figure 9.49 lets you scan, review, and understand the data with minimal effort. 
The table consolidates 10 columns into three groups, emphasizes the visu-
als over the text, and communicates the same data points more effectively. 
Although the fund list is presented as a table, the solution could be made into 
an interactive one. Because the focus of the analysis is largely a comparative 
one, interactivity enables you to explore the data and look for trends. For exam-
ple, the black triangle above the 1Y column is a sort indicator. As an interactive 
display, you could select another column header to sort and the Ribbon display 
would adjust and reorder the funds. 
Key Take-Aways
One advantage to applying visual representation to a dense data set is 
the familiarity of the table structure. You can embed similar visualizations 
into your own tables to improve your ability to quickly analyze the data. 
The embedded visualization transforms each cell in the table into a con-
nected Ribbon that makes comparison possible. The strong benefit is the 
synchronicity of understanding the overall big picture view of the data 
while still retaining the granularity of the original input. The solution does 
not sacrifice the detail but rather enhances it and makes comparison of 
multiple variables a possibility.
Ranking Against Benchmarks 
A common practice for many firms is to review fund performance against the 
benchmark to rank and assess value. Benchmark returns require a combination 
of market data and internal company data to be brought together into one view. 
The ability to compare funds across various time intervals provides you with 
strong reference points for better assessment. 
The Category Returns vs. Benchmark, as shown in Figure 9.50, is an example of 
past performance of funds as they relate to risk adjusted alpha, % of the fund, 
and average returns. The purpose of this table is to highlight funds that exceed 
thresholds within alpha as well as % ahead of index.

Returns vs. Benchmark
Figure 9.50  Category Returns vs. Benchmark Table
The Category Returns vs. Benchmark data table is a representative sample of 
simulated fund data. A full data set may have multiple category headers to list 
the funds. Instead, the sample table includes one category, shown in bold, with 
corresponding funds listed below the header “Global/International/Regional.”
Each time interval lists secondary headers: Average Return, Alpha, and % Ahead 
of Index, which are then repeated five times for each time interval. The Average 
Return column is a simple equal weighted average return calculation that is 
annualized for periods greater than 1 year for each fund. Here alpha is defined 
as the difference between a fund’s actual performance and the performance that 
might have been expected given its volatility relative to the benchmark index. 
The percentage Ahead of Index is defined as the percentile ranking of the fund 
ahead of the index. The current Category Returns vs. Benchmark visualization 
is dedicated to answer the following:
▸
▸Across all funds, which fund produced positive or negative alpha? 
▸
▸Which fund results in a higher or lower threshold of positive or negative 
returns against the identified benchmark(s)?
▸
▸How consistent has this performance been for each fund?
The visual aids of red and tan color-coded cells highlight some of the textual 
data to call out instances that exceed a threshold. The hue-based indicator 

326    Chapter 9: Mutual Funds 
system employs a method of layering visual information on top of the text. In 
this case, tan is used to indicate instances of positive alpha (> 1.00) and % ahead 
of index > 77, whereas red is used to indicate negative alpha (< -1.00) with a % 
ahead of index < 50. 
The challenge with the Category Returns vs. Benchmark table is that although 
the data is organized as a list of funds, the column structure does not help to 
organize your own analysis. The table forces you to scan and read various parts 
of the table to make your own connections. Each value within the cells stands 
alone as a discrete value, and you are left to attempt to create a continuous 
system of tracking and linking the data points. The two main focus areas for 
improvement include a repetitive column system and use of color to highlight 
thresholds. 
Similar to other reports organized in spreadsheets, the Category Returns vs. 
Benchmark table repeats a serial list of column headers. The repeated header 
system is seen in cases in which there is a primary and secondary header. The 
shortfall of this table set-up is that you cannot easily compare “Average Return” 
against all time intervals or “Alpha” or “% Ahead of Index,” for that matter. 
Instead you are obligated to track textual information in the first cell to textual 
information in the tenth cell to compare the category average return within 
“YTD” to “5 Years.” 
You are forced to rely on the text inside the color cell to understand how much 
the threshold has been breached by reading each value. As an alternative, con-
sider a mechanism to easily identify, calculate, and compare. The goals of the 
next set of visual tools (starting with Figure 9.51) aims to do the following: 
▸
▸Help you identify a threshold breach either in a positive or negative 
direction as well as see the extent of the breach.
▸
▸See rather than read and calculate a value.
▸
▸Compare and track performance.
In Figure 9.51, the visual table illustrates numerical data as a series of bars that 
indicate defined threshold incidents in positive or negative returns.

Returns - Historical Span
Figure 9.51  Bar and Pin Chart
The table structure maintains the row headers listed as funds and the col-
umns headers for historical returns specifically within Alpha, % Ahead, and 
Return. However, the table emphasizes Alpha. It lists alpha first and is sorted 
in descending order of Alpha. A reference scale at the base of the table is 
presented to indicate the numerical values across each column header. The 
zero vertical lines connect the reference scale at the base of the table up to the 
column headers. As shown in the legend, the pin marker references 10 Year 
historical returns while taking note of the 3M return. 
The visual treatment used in Figure 9.51 emphasizes the display of historical 
spread and then marks the YTD performance as additional information. This 
version of the data is useful if you are interested in seeing or communicating 

328    Chapter 9: Mutual Funds 
long-term performance over short-term performance. However, you can also 
consider the reverse. What if you would rather emphasize the short-term 
performance? 
Next, consider another approach (Figure 9.52) that puts more focus on short-
term performance.

Figure 9.52  Bar Bracket Chart
This alternative chart (Figure 9.52) places more emphasis on the short-term per-
formance while still maintaining the context of the historical performance back 
to the 10-year timeframe. In this version of the same data, you can get an under-
standing of how the list of funds has performed across different time intervals. 
Alignment with the number line below shows the range of how consistent or 
inconsistent a fund has performed over the years. You can quickly see if the

current performance is within or outside of the fund’s “typical path” or if the 
fund has been making incremental progress toward the current performance.

Figure 9.53  Stem/Bubble Steps
The Stem/Bubble Steps uses varying elements of color, size, and shape to com-
municate each time period. As the legend indicates, each circle progressively 
grows in both size and color saturation as time nears. Each line and circle is 
anchored to a vertical line to indicate how much of a deviation there is from the 
centerline. And similar to musical notes on a page, the stem and bubble combi-
nation accentuate their location and can be described as how far above or below 
middle C they are on a keyboard. Anything played above or below a certain 
octave can be alerting and noted as a breach to the predefined threshold. 

330    Chapter 9: Mutual Funds 
The benefits of Figure 9.53 are threefold. First, the use of both size and color 
gives prominence to the current value. Second, each stem and bubble pairing 
presents historical points, each as independent value representations. Third, the 
circle shape communicates motion and depicts performance as dynamic. 
Despite these benefits, instead you may need to emphasize the threshold range 
with a more simplified chart (shown in Figure 9.54).

Figure 9.54  Bubble Trace
Figure 9.54 extends the benefits of the predecessor by introducing two con-
cepts: visual simplification and visual reinforcement. The first concept of visual 
simplification asks this question: What can be removed from the chart without 
compromising the intended communication? As a subtractive method, the 

Mutual Fund Comparison    331
goal of simplification is to remove visual noise from the chart to focus on the 
data results. Simplification of a visual removes additive hindrances, blocks, or 
barriers that cause you to pause without the benefit of greater understanding. 
Figure 9.54 uses a single horizontal line to anchor the performance markers. 
Eliminating the extra horizontal lines, referenced as stems in the chart, enables 
you to focus on the circles. 
Visual reinforcement asks the following question: What can be added to the 
chart to improve, extend, or supplement the intended communication? As 
supportive aides to a chart, visual reinforcements are typically not primary 
or prominent in a chart; rather these reinforcements are generally subtle and 
rendered in the background of a chart. In Figure 9.54, the light gray vertical 
block is rendered as a background fill and is used as a visual aid to clearly define 
the threshold points. The gray vertical block is a subtle introduction to the chart 
that improves your ability to read the chart. 
Key Take-Aways
Charts within the Category Returns vs. Benchmark collection (Figures 
9.51–9.54) emphasize certain time period over others. For example, the Bar 
and Pin Chart (Figure 9.51) focuses on long-term performance, whereas 
the Bar Bracket Chart (Figure 9.52) highlights more recent performance. 
The Stem/Bubble Steps (Figure 9.53) and the Bubble Trace (Figure 9.54) 
introduce a visual system that shows individual time period. Although the 
charts emphasize different points, their core purposes remain unchanged. 
They remain capable of helping you to identify a threshold break, to see 
(rather than read and calculate) a value, and to compare and track perfor-
mance across different time intervals. Which chart(s) you use depends on 
what needs you need to address.

Summary
This chapter discusses the redesign of core component visualizations and shows 
how to integrate them within qualitative information and quantitative tables. 
The Fund Fact Sheet, for example, combines these redesigned visual compo-
nents with textual description to convey qualitative information. In contrast, 
the quantitative table shown in the “Mutual Fund Comparison” section provides 
a column of visualizations next to corresponding numeric values to compare a 
short list of funds. In the former case, visualizations vary and represent differ-
ent data sets with comparison points within the fund. In the latter, the visual-
izations are consistent and repeat for comparison across a list of funds. Both of 
these use cases produce a diverse set of mutual fund data visualizations:

As sales and marketing tools, component visualizations and fund lists provide 
benefits not just for public relations but also for internal tools. For example, 
you could use visual components from the fund fact sheet section for your own 
monitoring needs. A visual component is a standalone element, and you can 
employ as many or as few components as you need. You can create your own 
dashboard or set of dashboards using a collection of components. To display a 
table data, for example, you could reuse the Ribbon technique when you need to 
show the change in value across different discrete time intervals. The descrip-
tion of each visualization listed here can help to identify which visual technique 
you can reuse and how.


Hedge Funds

Every hedge fund investors’ primary question is, “Can this hedge fund produce abso-
lute returns?” It is the job of the hedge fund manager to ensure this question can be 
answered with a resounding “Yes;” positive returns using alternative investment man-
agement techniques can be achieved. Although we cannot predict if a fund will produce 
absolute returns, data visualizations can surface patterns and behaviors of funds based 
on their characteristics to better analyze strategies. 
This chapter focuses on evaluating hedge funds from the perspective of the investor and 
the investment consultant who advises fund investors. We examine two important sets 
of hedge fund data to compare funds and strategies, starting with data from an individ-
ual fund and ending with data for the industry overall. Neither set of data is unique or 
proprietary to a specific firm’s methodology and instead is available publicly, providing a 
glimpse into the hedge fund world. 
The chapter begins by reviewing an example of exposure breakdowns for a fund to reveal 
the long/short aspects that are seen in many funds. The ability to employ a range of trad-
ing strategies of long and short positions in traditional and nontraditional markets can 
markedly influence fund performance. The visualization examples explore how these mar-
ket exposures present patterns and correlate to market movements. Contrasting the fund 
returns based on market exposure against a provided index is one means for investors and 
consultants to evaluate funds and determine if the fund manager is adding value. 
The second part of this chapter uses an industry-wide performance rankings data set. 
Here, we take a look at the hedge fund world as a whole and review data that uncovers 
  335

336    Chapter 10: Hedge Funds
top performing strategies and their respective ranking history over the post 
financial crisis period. We also review strategies and size in AUM (assets under 
management) for both the fund and firm to provide context to the strategy, fund, 
and rank order. Finally, we close with a cross-industry view of what it means to 
be top rank. Our review of the top 100 funds unveils the capability of strategies, 
funds, and firms to maintain top rank. Although the hedge fund industry aims 
for absolute returns, the visualizations reveal several of the top 100 funds are not 
consistently ranked and do not provide absolute returns.
The individual fund data within the first three sections of this chapter is 
hypothetical data and is representative of what is provided in the market-
place, whereas the source data for the top 100 funds is from Barron’s. 
Long/Short Positions
This section uses equity hedge strategy data that combines long and short posi-
tions. As one of many hedge fund strategies, this particular strategy uses a mar-
ket neutral strategy with a corresponding index to benchmark the strategy. The 
equity long/short fund data includes exposure breakdown by various categories, 
highlights net exposure, and compares these points across a set of funds. Firms 
can look inward and compare how various funds perform individually, as a fund 
of funds, or as a complete collection; consultants can review a set of funds; and 
investors can more readily see the variation of each fund.
First, begin by looking at exposure data for one fund, as illustrated in Figure 10.1. 
This chart shows you a simple method to present long and short positions.
The Butterfly chart (refer to Figure 10.1) shows both long and short positions 
across different groups within the fund. The bar charts are organized around a 
zero mark with long and short positions in percentage. The short position bars 
(in orange) are defined as the market value of the short position divided by the 
total short market value. Similarly, the long position bars (in blue) are defined as 
the market value of the long position divided by the total long market value.
NOTE

Long/Short Positions    337
The benefit of the Butterfly chart is that it consolidates two data sets of long and 
short positions into one continuous bar by expanding the scale. Color is used to 
distinguish the long versus the short positions, and you can generally see how 
positions are balanced. For example, the chart enables you to review either the 
symmetrical or asymmetrical exposure to long/short positions within a set of 
categories. Organizing the data around the zero mark begins to show a mirror 
image like a butterfly, but exactly how symmetrical are those exposures? The 
chart does not make it easy for you to answer if the long and short positions are 
equal, or if not equal, by how much. The next chart (Figure 10.2) includes visual 
queues to indicate asymmetrical exposures to show how much of an exposure 
actually exists with netted values.

The Butterfly Net Bar chart (refer to Figure 10.2) layers in the differences 
between the long and the short positions. The netted value displays a darker 
translucent bar chart on top of the existing bar chart to identify how much 
exposure there is and where it is greater or equal. Each individual chart stands 
alone as its own visual entity. However, what if you want to associate these fund 
exposures to a fund? There are two possible ways: You could achieve this with 
text and provide a label to be read, or you could achieve this visually in the 
chart. Figure 10.3 shows several exposure attributes of one fund combined into 
one visual entity.

Figure 10.3  Grouped Butterfly Bars

Combining the charts into a lassoed group presents you with one chart; 
the color bars, lasso line, and centered return value of 7.59 percent creates a 
grouped structure.
There are advantages and disadvantages to showing the full set of details in the 
Grouped Butterfly Bars. The advantages are, of course, the specifics that each 
detail level exposure provides. The disadvantages are the different amount of 
segments across the four groups; market cap has four segments, sector has ten, 
region has seven, and style has five. The variation makes it more difficult to 
assess and compare exposure across the four groups. For you to visually com-
pare the four groups within this fund or to another, you first need to objectify 
the visual. The representation of the same visual can be somewhat tweaked to 
produce a visual symbol. The Butterfly Bar Glyph (Figure 10.4) introduces a 
standardized number of segments for better comparison.
As a symbol embedded with meaning, each bar mark within the glyph indicates 
the long/short position, exposure, and net. You can see the net of each long/
short position shown as a black line that travels across each bar. 
Figure 10.4 introduces the concept of representing a fund through the vessel of 
a glyph. Glyphs are recognizable symbols that are created to represent a specific 
meaning. For example, each letter in the alphabet is a glyph. The symbols used 
to represent each letter are simple geometric lines that children learn to read and 
write by the age of 5. Glyphs are instantly recognizable because they are simplified.
The Butterfly Bar Glyph uniquely applies the strengths of a glyph to identify 
characteristics of a fund. For example, the groups have been reduced in com-
plexity to show you overall exposure within three segments. The three segments 
are exhaustive and mutually exclusive with 100% of the sector information 
represented in three segments. The standardized number of segments enables 
you to instantly recognize the coded values without repeated dependence on 
legends or keys.

Removing the details down to the essential features of the fund makes it easier 
for you to compare the exposures within and across funds. The next chart tests 
what can be displayed as essential features by scaling down the glyph. The 
scaled-down mini version abstracts the data set for you to call out the charac-
teristics even further. Figure 10.5 shows you how these mini glyphs can be both 
abstract and detailed by providing an unobstructed view of each exposure with 
the specifics of exposure as needed.

only on mouse-over. This layer technique provides you the benefits of both the 
visual data and text label data. It also enables you to consume the data into two 
logical steps: The symbolized quintessential essence of the fund and supportive 
detail labels of each long/short pairing. The added benefit of the scaled down 
glyphs is space. As shown in Figure 10.6, the mini glyphs take up less space, 
which makes it easier to compare with other funds.

Since losses can be infinite with short sells, a display like Figure 10.6 makes it 
easier for you to identify funds with short selling risk. As a set, the Mini Glyphs 

Long/Short Positions    343
enables better comparison by using techniques of consolidation, organization, 
scale, and standardization:
▸
▸Standardization—The glyph as a system introduces a set of consistent 
marks as standards. For example, the glyph has been standardized to 
three bars within each group. Standardization across all visual marks is 
an important gate into comparison. 
▸
▸Consolidation—The benefit of a glyph is the compact delivery of infor-
mation that combines four charts into one. Figure 10.6 shows you the 
consolidation of 40 charts into 10 small-sized glyphs. 
▸
▸Scale—The collection of glyphs (refer to Figure 10.6) efficiently reduces 
the chart footprint even further with the introduction of the Mini Glyph. 
Scaling down the glyphs enables the collection to physically fit within a 
smaller footprint and enables you to compare more glyphs in one view.
▸
▸Organization—The organization and placement of each Mini can help 
you in the task of comparison. Sequential order of the Mini Glyphs 
by specific fund exposure can help you to review and compare the set. 
Other larger glyph collections organized by returns, geography, or by 
internal company structures may be used to reveal patterns. 
Central to each glyph are the fund returns. The single bold text values stand 
out and are easy for you to scan across the collection. Exactly how you decide to 
organize, sort, or group the collection can improve scanning and analyzing the 
collection even further.
Key Take-Aways
The glyph is a useful visualization method to display multivariate data in a 
simple and concise format. This compactness provides quick side-by-side 
comparison of several entities, in this case funds, based on multiple prop-
erties. As a visualization vessel, the glyph can be used to support different 
data use cases. For example, you can take the same glyph design and 
display the return percentage in the center in context of the performance 
attribution data. Or you could project future fund performance in context 
of the current exposures. Either way, the glyph can display 39 data sets 

344    Chapter 10: Hedge Funds
(calculated with 4 groups of 3 bars with 3 data points each, plus the 3 data 
points in the middle of the glyph) within a small footprint.
Long Positions and Benchmarking
As stated earlier, not all strategies use short positions. The next set of visualiza-
tions helps you quickly assess long-only funds with a stronger presence of the 
benchmark numbers. Figure 10.7 reuses the glyph concept and introduces more 
color coding into the glyph to elevate differences in market exposure. In addi-
tion, this section shows how to visually incorporate each fund’s alignment or 
misalignment from the benchmark.

As the name suggests, the Tricolor Glyph introduces color to distinguish invest-
ment style within each group. Teal is reserved for the conservative characteris-
tics of large cap, defensive sectors, U.S. region, and value style. Purple denotes 
moderate characteristics and orange indicates aggressive characteristics. As a 
long-only fund of data, the chart’s bars grow outward exclusively. A few scaled-
down versions of the Tricolor Glyph, as shown in the bottom right, are used to 
test the readability of a miniature version.
The benefit of the tricolor system is that it provides you with more distinguish-
ing qualities across all characteristics of the fund. For this reason it can help 
you answer questions such as, Is the fund highly conservative? The dominating 
teal bars make it easy for you to see that’s the case. Despite the small scale of the 
minis, the solid block colors are distinguishable. However, you can also include 
details in the Mini Glyphs. The next sets of solutions (Figures 10.8 and 10.9) 
explore a few possibilities of how to incorporate details.

Figure 10.8  Mini Tricolor Glyph

346    Chapter 10: Hedge Funds
Similar to the Mini Glyph (Figure 10.5), the Mini Tricolor Glyph illustrates 
an interactive application of the visual. The details shown in the interactive 
Mini Tricolor Glyph example, however, are different. Instead of showing you 
the short/long netted amount, you can now see the benchmark’s outline of 
market exposure. You can compare each fund characteristic to the benchmark 
by using the black dotted line drawn on top of each bar. This enables you to see 
each fund’s alignment or off-set from the benchmark. In addition, the fund, 
benchmark, and category return values are placed in the center of the glyph for 
comparison. 
You can depict an entire collection of funds by using the mini form of the 
Tricolor Glyph. Figure 10.9 illustrates a set of funds for you to compare and 
contrast by using the tricolor technique. 
Comparing and contrasting the collection of glyphs, as shown in Figure 10.9, is 
easier for you to do with the use of the tricolor system. You can spot conservative 
funds highlighted as blue bars versus aggressive funds with dominant orange bars. 
The third example shows a moderate fund with dominant purple bars. More inter-
esting, motion is also now introduced as an element to the charts. Both the length 
and the dominant color influences in each chart have a flare of rotational pull. The 
rotational pull of the conservative fund creates a pinwheel that appears to rotate to 
the left, whereas the rotational pull of the aggressive fund creates a pinwheel that 
rotates to the right. In contrast, the moderate fund does not communicate motion 
and instead seems to balance in the center. Finally, the fund with mixed character-
istics no longer has a rotational pull and stands out for that reason.

Figure 10.9  Tricolor Glyph Collection
The benefit of the Tricolor Glyph collection is that it surfaces the overall char-
acteristic even further than the previous glyph example (refer to Figure 10.9). 
You can recognize each glyph as a pattern; the rotational direction provides the 
ability for you to recognize the pattern and proves the strength of a glyph as a 
symbol embedded with meaning. Primarily designed for pattern recognition, 
glyphs typically do not lend themselves to details or explanations. However, the 

348    Chapter 10: Hedge Funds
interactive mouse-over states listed on the third row (of Figure 10.9) do provide 
details.
Although the mouse-over technique is useful for you to briefly see the details 
and offset from the benchmark, the inherent brevity makes it difficult to com-
pare the benchmark offsets across all funds. In addition, it is hard for you to 
visualize the underweight and overweight exposures. The next glyph collection 
(Figure 10.10) introduces an indicator that clearly shows underweight and over-
weight exposures when compared to the benchmark.

Figure 10.10  Glyph Benchmark
You can clearly see the fund/benchmark net in the Glyph Benchmark collec-
tion (Figure 10.10). The color bars show areas of investment and interest with 
overweighted exposures, whereas the gray shown as negative space cutouts 
draw attention to areas with underweighted exposures. As a result, the glyph 
emphasizes the active management aspects of fund strategy for each parameter; 
the glyph’s bar shows you only the divergence from the benchmark and, in the 
center, a numerically represented tracking error.
The benefit of the Glyph Benchmark is that it works together as a system with 
the previous chart, Figure 10.9, to provide you another perspective to the same 
funds. The fund/benchmark active result uses the same visual layout to main-
tain consistency between the charts. You can extend your understanding of the 

Fund Characteristics    349
fund performance by introducing this data set as another layer of information 
or by sorting the collection by exposure, performance, or benchmark.
Key Take-Aways
The strength of the Tricolor Glyphs (Figures 10.7–10.10) is that they uncover 
distinct patterns and enable you to quickly recognize fund characteristics. 
The long-only data provides the ability to distinguish patterns and focus 
on benchmark comparison. Aggressive or conservative characteristics of a 
fund can stand out. Localized overweights and underweights in compari-
son to the benchmark can also stand out. These noticeable characteristics 
that stand out are possible through the visual system (Figures 10.7–10.10) 
that compares funds across a collection.
Fund Characteristics
In the previous glyph designs, the simple bar and line charts are combined 
to explain the fund’s exposures. Each glyph is encoded with the same basic 
element of a bar chart to show amount. This next section starts to coalesce 
around a different approach to the glyph: What if you used an already recogniz-
able object seen in nature to describe the fund characteristics? How would you 
describe these characteristics into an already familiar object? The next examples 
use an encoded glyph, defined as a familiar object that uses the object’s 
characteristics to represent a specific meaning. The Chernoff Fish shown in 
Figure 10.11 explores the idea of relying on a fish’s attributes to be the vessel of 
fund characteristics.
Similar in concept to Chernoff faces, the Chernoff Fish maps multiple charac-
teristics to a highly recognizable object, a fish. Statistician Herman Chernoff 
(who held teaching posts at MIT and Harvard) introduced the idea of showing 
multivariate values via the features of a person’s face. The eyes represent one 
value, the nose another value, and mouth a third value, and so on. Chernoff’s 
faces are symmetrical and show the front view of the face. Unlike Chernoff’s 
faces, the asymmetrical characteristics of a fish’s side profile reduce redundancy 

350    Chapter 10: Hedge Funds
of pairs and can be used to show you more variables. The schematic diagram in 
Figure 10.11 shows the well-appointed characteristics of a fish as a logical link to 
a fund’s characteristics. As the center of attention, the eyes show performance 
with the pupil representing the fund’s returns and the outline showing the top 
fund performance within the same category. The mass of the fish is depicted 
with the market cap for the belly and style for the back. The fins are reserved to 
show exposure across various regions and sectors.

Figure 10.11  Chernoff Fish
It is important for you to encode the right set of fund characters to fish char-
acteristics to make the glyph both logical and powerful. A sensible mapping of 
characteristics makes decoding the fish more memorable. As an example, it is 
easy to remember the pupil is mapped to performance as a major focus point to 
the fund. Encoding the market cap and style to the body creates a more power-
ful analysis of the investment style of the fund. The next illustration shows you 
how well-appointed characteristics impact a collection of funds.

Fund Characteristics    351
Encoding a fund’s characteristics impacts how well you can evaluate the entire 
collection. Good encoding practices enables you to answer the following ques-
tions: As a collection, how does the school of funds compare? How recognizable 
are the various funds and strategies employed? Do the conservative funds stand 
out? The School of Funds chart shown next, Figure 10.12, presents a collection 
of funds for further evaluation. Here, the chart illustrates how well the encod-
ing practices work.

352    Chapter 10: Hedge Funds
How do you distinguish the flounders from the barracudas? The School of Funds 
chart organizes 16 funds primarily by the fish’s mass characteristics. The funds 
are sorted horizontally by style and vertically by market cap. As you review 
each fund individually or scan the set, you will notice the variations are well 
noted and distinguishable both within and across the set. Although somewhat 
whimsical as a data visualization, there is rigor and strength in the approach. 
The benefits of the School of Funds chart include attributes analysis, pattern 
recognition, and ranking:
▸
▸Attributes analysis—How well can you identify and spot differences 
and similarities? Each fund’s features are translated into fish attributes 
that can help you explain the fund’s characteristics. Attributes analysis 
enables you to understand the characteristics to compare and contrast 
funds. Using the visual system based on individual fish characters, the 
overall understanding of the fish’s behaviors and positioning becomes a 
personality that naturally appears. For example, the agility of the small 
cap growth funds over the longevity of the large cap value funds becomes 
an extended part of the fund’s personality.
▸
▸Pattern recognition—How well can you recognize and foresee a recur-
ring behavior? Pattern recognition is the ability to predict outputs based 
on learned inputs. Decoding the fish’s features into fund characteristics 
and behaviors establishes the ability to provide potential next steps based 
on existing information.
▸
▸Ranking—Which fund has performed the best? Ranking establishes 
order in the collection by using the pupil size to identify greater than or 
less than returns against its peers. Comparing the fish eyes quickly high-
lights which funds are top ranked versus bottom ranked. 
The School of Funds visualization pushes beyond the conventional fund evalu-
ation and creates a new lexicon of how you can describe funds. Each fund has 
the potential to become more memorable as the combined fish characteristics 
produce a persona on their own. To extend the characteristics to a persona, 
the Long/Short Fund Strategies, as shown in Figure 10.13, illustrates how to 
distinguish the predominately long strategy funds from the funds that mainly 
use short strategies.

gies are orange and swim left, whereas funds dominated with long strategies 
are blue and face right. Or the long/short fund characteristics are shown as a 
set of two complementary strategies and can describe a market neutral fund 
with both long and short positions. Shorted investments are represented as an 
orange fish facing left, whereas the opposite-facing blue fish shape encodes the 
long exposures strategy. Yet more detailed characteristics can be added to the 
fish, as shown in Figure 10.14.

Detailed Sector Information
Figure 10.14  Detailed Chernoff Fish
The Detailed Chernoff Fish schematic adds sector details to the previous 
schematic (refer to Figure 10.11). Details can either enhance or detract from 
analyzing the main points of a visualization. Depending on the visualization, 
it can accommodate more details and present the details well or compromise 
the communication. The question becomes: Do these added details help or hurt 
the communication? The next chart, Detailed School of Funds (Figure 10.15) 

Fund Characteristics    355
tests the limits of adding details to the original Chernoff Fish. As you review 
the school of fish, also review the added sectors and evaluate if the details are a 
useful addition to the fish.
Fund Comparison
Detailed Sector Information
Figure 10.15  Detailed School of Funds
The full sector list, in the Detailed School of Funds, appears in the tail and pec-
toral fins. Both the presence and market exposure across the sectors is drawn 
with the color and thickness of the individual arches. Color saturation distin-
guishes the sectors, whereas the size of each arch shows the percentage value of 
the market exposure.
The drawback with the sector details is that they are not as legible or as memo-
rable as the original implementation of School of Funds (see Figure 10 12). First, 
the list of 10 sectors and 16 other characteristic initially requires you to refer-
ence the schematic and decode the shades of blue to one of the characteristics. 
Partly a numbers game, you are required to remember the placement and order 
of 26 characteristics in total. Next, you have to closely inspect and compare 
each feature to one another. The 10 similarly depicted sectors may constrain 
your ability to identify and distinguish the detailed sector characteristics. 
Lastly, the combination of the amount and type of details makes it more dif-
ficult for you to recall.

If not used often, this chart lobbies for the argument of simplification. In this 
case, simplification improves the visualization, making it both memorable and 
easier to decode for the infrequent audience. However, if frequently used, you 
would learn these details over time. You would be able to quickly decode the 
details and have access to more information from the features.
Key Take-Aways 
Glyphs are not just visual marks of lines created to symbolize data. As 
discussed in this section, glyphs can also be familiar objects in our environ-
ment that can be encoded to represent data. In both cases, successful 
glyphs are simple and standardized. Simplified glyphs make it easier for 
you to map characteristics of the glyph to a data value. The glyphs that 
work are those that are standardized to compare the data’s attributes, pat-
terns, and ranking. Although this section uses a fish as the glyph to com-
municate fund data, you can decide to use another familiar object. If you 
do have multivariate data to display, selecting an object that is asymmetric 
efficiently supports more data points per display area.
Strategy Rank
Each year, the inquisitive and competitive hedge fund industry publishes a list 
of top-ranking hedge funds, fund manager performance, and fund manager 
salaries. In a high-stakes industry with large sums to invest, peers and inves-
tors want to know how well a certain fund performed in comparison to others. 
Or how well managers performed compared to their peer group. The industry 
draws attention from outsiders and the media. Well-known publications such 
as Bloomberg and Barron’s grab the public’s attention with their annual reports 
that provide a ray of light into an otherwise opaque closed-doors world. In this 
section we take advantage of those publications to get a comprehensive view of 
the industry.
Although the source data for this section is provided by Barron’s, the strat-
egy categories for each of the funds has been provided by the authors. 
NOTE

Strategy Rank    357
The annual data set shows the results of a year’s worth of active investment 
decisions on behalf of the investment team to produce the top 100 performing 
funds based on a 3-year annualized gain. Did the team’s day-to-day decisions 
work? How well did its investment strategies do? How long can top-performing 
strategies hold top-ranking status? This section explores these questions in a 
series of visual methods to show investment strategies’ rank, performance, fund 
size, and firm size across the post-financial crisis period of 2008–2013. We start 
to answer these questions with the Stacked Area chart (Figure 10.16) that shows 
you the strategy categories used across those years.

Figure 10.16  Stacked Area

358    Chapter 10: Hedge Funds
The Stacked Area chart shown in Figure 10.16 represents the market share of 
the top 100 performing hedge funds, grouped by strategy. The 173 investment 
approaches within the full data sample were categorized into nine strategies: 
trading, regional, activist, macro, multi-strategy, arbitrage, event-driven, fixed-
income, and directional. The list of strategies/streams is ordered by the 2013 
strategy size with the smallest percentage at the top and the largest percentage 
at the bottom. Aside from creating a stream for the school of Chernoff Fish to 
swim in, the streams insinuate rivers that are widening or closing up to indicate 
its corresponding percentage. Dark blue color fill shows you how to highlight a 
particular strategy stream, whereas the other shades of blue alternate to simply 
distinguish one stream from another. 
Known as survivorship bias, it is often the case that only the successful strate-
gies are reported. Although it is true that the data is meant to report the top-
performing funds, the Stacked Area chart also tracks the trends of declining 
strategies. The Stacked Area chart neutralizes survivorship bias for strategies 
and shows either growing success or failure within the top 100 list. As a stream 
of fund strategies either gaining or losing traction in the top 100, the Stacked 
Area chart shows you the strategy progress across the post-2007 financial crisis. 
It shows which strategies are increasingly making the top 100 and which ones 
are appearing or disappearing from the list. 
Mathematically, more can be done to show you a relative ranking of the catego-
ries. The Stacked Area – Relative Rank chart shown in Figure 10.17 uses a new 
calculation to slightly adjust the results.
The Stacked Area – Relative Rank chart introduces the concept of ranking 
points. To accurately represent the strength of a strategy’s presence, each of the 
100 funds are assigned points based on the corresponding rank within the 100 
list. The rank points are calculated using the formula 
P = 100–Rank
where P = Points and Rank = Corresponding rank within the 100 list. The 
yearly value for each strategy represents the sum of the assigned fund points. 
The y-axis total points reaches 4,950, which is based on 100 funds with ranking 
points ranging from 0 to 99.

Although the changes are minor in this relative rank version, the nature of the 
chart’s curves and flowing stacked sections makes it difficult for you to detect the 
difference in accuracy. Regardless, knowing that the chart represents an accurate 
description of the strategies provides confidence and trust in the visual. Under-
standing the calculation used to rank the funds is just one part of trusting the 
visualization. The reliability of a data visualization is dependent on managing: 
▸
▸How the data is gathered—Is the data source credible? Are the defini-
tions and approach well-thought-out? 
▸
▸How the data is calculated—Are the values absolute or relative? Which 
formula best represents the data? Which formula best represents the 
question? 
▸
▸How the data is depicted—How does structure, scale, orientation, order, 
alignment, color, and use of visual marks impact your interpretation of 
the data?
The listed order by descending rank points may cause confusion. At first glance, 
the upward trend of the streams subconsciously communicates an increase and 
even perhaps an improvement. After reviewing the chart, it is clear the opposite 
is occurring. In more than one-half of the strategies, 5 of the 9 are actually 
decreasing in performance rank. The next example reviews how slight changes

to the chart’s visual arrangement can impact your perception of the data.

direction. Your job is to select the best default order to avoid a misinterpreta-
tion of the data.
Strategy Rank and Ranges
Aside from ranking strategies, you can explore other aspects of the ranking 
strategy data set regarding strategy average returns and range of least-effective 
to most-effective fund performance. The post-financial crisis period is an inter-
esting time span to analyze these attributes of averages and ranges. During this 
period of uncertainty, an unbiased review of the attributes helps you to track 
the trends of top strategies and analyze when and how the returns responded to 
the market conditions.
As shown in Figure 10.19, the strategy attributes display in a series of bidirec-
tional, equitable charts. Which strategy did well across the years? Which years 
showed strong returns? How well did a strategy perform and how consistent was 
that performance within the strategy? The Dot Matrix collection answers these 
questions with a flexible display that does not provide preference to one ques-
tion over another. It also gradually incorporates additional attributes into each 
chart in the collection:
▸
▸Figure 10.19 A provides an overview of category average returns for the 
3-year annualized returns. 
▸
▸Figure 10.19 B shows each category’s average returns as a dark blue cen-
ter and most-effective fund performance in light blue outer circles. 
▸
▸Figure 10.19 C adds the category’s least-effective fund performance in the 
center one-half ring.

Strategy Analysis    363
Because the dot shapes are directionally neutral, the data display can reveal 
strategy attributes. The sheer size of the dots lures your attention to the top 
performing strategies, whereas the range of attributes provides details and 
more context for further examination. The Dot Matrix approach can be used 
in other cases in which you need to review the data from two perspectives 
(of columns and rows) and do not want to emphasize one perspective over 
another.
Key Take-Aways
Accurate and neutral views of the data remove bias and allow the numbers 
to tell the story. How the data is gathered, calculated, and depicted can 
influence the understanding of the data. The Stacked Area  is an example 
of recalculating the data to accurately represent rank, while the Dot Matrix 
neutralizes the data display by fairly representing all the attributes in an 
egalitarian way. 
Strategy Analysis
It’s a common practice to step back and look at the overall returns of a strat-
egy category over a span of time. The following visualizations introduce a 
method to interact with 100 funds over a 6-year period. In his task analysis 
paper, “The Eyes Have It: Task by Data Type Taxonomy for Information 
Visualization,” Ben Shneiderman outlines the series of steps to navigate and 
visually interact with large data. Shneiderman’s Visual Information Seeking 
Mantra includes overview, zoom, filter, and details on-demand. The overview 
presents all the strategy averages per year and across the years. Next, the 
zoom view examines a single strategy and then zooms in further to examine 
the strategy at the fund level. Third, the filters are applied to focus on one 
year over another. Fourth, data display panels list the specific values regard-
ing a fund. 

364    Chapter 10: Hedge Funds
The illustrations in the next section show an interactive system that follows 
these four steps and introduces a fifth task of comparison to the list. 
Ben Shneiderman is a professor of Computer Science at the University of  
Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab. The paper referenced in this sec-
tion was published in Proceedings: IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages. 3–6 Sep 
1996. ISBN: 0-8186-7508-X. It’s available online at http://www.interactiondesign.
us/courses/2011_AD690/PDFs/Shneiderman_1996.pdf.
All Strategy Averages
The first step of providing an overview includes performance averages across 
all the strategies and years. A great candidate to show averages of performance, 
fund, and firm size of AUM with the capability to zoom and reveal details on-
demand is a bubble plot. 
The bubble plot is known to effectively reveal clusters and outliers. Later in 
this chapter you see how it can also show temporal data. Interactive bubble 
plots can be used to directly label items in dense regions of overlapping circles. 
Figure 10.20 illustrates how the interactive display can work to label and display 
supporting details such as: performance averages for the 2008–2013 period, 
averages in the 1-year returns, averages in the 3-year returns, averages in the 
strategy size of the fund assets, as well as averages in the strategy size of the 
firm assets.
The interactive display works by selecting the bubbles within the chart or 
selecting the strategy within the legend. Selecting a strategy in the legend high-
lights the strategy in the chart and displays the numeric values of both the aver-
age fund and firm assets. As you interact with the display, you can also decide 
to view the range and make-up of these averages for the 2008–2013 period. The 
presentation of averages consolidates the data and can be your entry point to 
zoom into the details of the data. Figure 10.21 zooms in to show you how the 
strategies perform across the years.

The yearly returns shown in the Bubble Plot: 2008–2013 Returns chart (Fig-
ure 10.21) expand the scale beyond the 30% mark into the 40% mark and then 
dip into negative returns on the y-axis as they expand into each category’s 
yearly returns. The 54 category bubbles in the chart show the distribution, 
concentration, and size of the fund assets. Size, color, and rendering style with 
slight transparency of the bubbles enable you to see more of the layered bubbles. 
Despite this richer picture of performance that expands the view, the over-
whelming amount of information makes the display too dense to be useful.

Figure 10.22  Temporal Path - Arbitrage

368    Chapter 10: Hedge Funds
The selected display of one strategy view at a time produces the results in the 
Temporal Path – Arbitrage chart. The isolation produces a clearer image of a 
strategy’s 6-year path. You can make the following observations of the strategy’s 
past performance history: 
▸
▸Large swings in performance gains and losses from year to year
▸
▸Somewhat consistent size of each fund’s assets
▸
▸Inconsistent size of the corresponding firm’s assets 
The Temporal Path adds perspective to the relative average marker, shown  
in white fill, and enables you to discover more about the strategy’s per-
formance returns. Now that the system of filtering is established, you can 
further explore how other strategies have performed over the same period. 
Figure 10.23 and 10.24 display a filtered view of two other strategy categories 
in the list.
The Temporal Path – Directional chart shown in Figure 10.23 exposes the 
truth behind an average profile similar to the previous category of Arbitrage. 
Yet as is evident from the path, the movement across the years includes some 
extreme ranges of negative returns in 2008 to mid-30% returns in 2013. In the 
earlier years, the strategy represented a significant portion of firms AUM and 
was popular with firms with relatively small AUM, whereas in the latter years 
the strategy gained popularity with firms with large AUM. You may have 
made the same observations. The strategy shown in Figure 10.24, the Tempo-
ral Path – Event-Driven chart, provides you with yet another set of interesting 
observations.

Figure 10.24  Temporal Path - Event-Driven
The Temporal Path – Event Driven chart reveals a few distinct qualities; 3 of the 
6 years cluster around consistent performance returns, and the firm and fund 
assets are closely aligned to each other. After reviewing the three Temporal Paths 
of Arbitrage, Directional, and Event Driven, it is clear that the averages represent 
some shared behaviors. All three have low-performance years in 2008 and 2011 
and exactly one superb performance year in the 30% range. You can compare and 
learn from Figure 10.25, which illustrates a collection of temporal category paths 
that reveal similarities, nuances, and divergence of performance.

Figure 10.25  Temporal Path Collection

372    Chapter 10: Hedge Funds
The benefits of the Temporal Path Collection are many. In addition to providing 
you with five data points (1-year returns, 3-year returns, fund size, firm size, 
and category average), the arrowed line paths tell a story about the strategy’s 
sequential movements in returns and average assets under management. You 
can compare the consistency or inconsistency of each strategy’s returns across 
the years. You can extend the years beyond this relatively small time span to 
show 10, 15, or more years of top performing funds. The paths take on their own 
descriptors, and you can even ponder labels such as the open lasso shown in the 
fixed-income, the infinity loop shown in regional, the pretzel shown in multi-
strategy, and the single loop shown in macro strategy.
The next step shows you numeric details on-demand by providing the metadata 
to a selected bubble in the form of text-value pairs. Figure 10.26 illustrates how 
to provide specific metadata information to describe the strategy category.

Figure 10.27  Fund Bubbles– Interactive Fund Display
You may have noticed that the display continues the pattern of zoom, filter, 
details on demand, and compare for better consistency across those tasks. Fund 
Bubbles – Interactive Fund Display (Figure 10.27) uses the following visual ele-
ments to provide a consistent experience: 
▸
▸Average marker—The average marker shown in a transparent black 
circle is the weighted average anchor to all the underlying funds.

374    Chapter 10: Hedge Funds
▸
▸Bubble rendering—The quantity of funds, large fund assets, and cluster 
placements make it a challenge to clearly see all the funds. You can miti-
gate this obstructed view with the use of transparency to see through 
the firm assets, three-dimensional sphere rendering to reinforce the 
layers, and rule-based layering of the bubbles to place the smallest fund 
on top.
▸
▸Yearly context—The five lighter bubbles shown in the background are 
present as context to the other 5-year averages. The legend shows you the 
strategy and year selected with the use of bold text.
▸
▸Text display panel—The name and descriptors help you to identify and 
learn additional details of the fund with a list of 11 data points.
With this perspective, you can explore and see which fund performed the best 
in the 3-year returns versus the 1-year returns, which fund had the most assets 
versus the smallest, and so on. The display can both zoom in to a specific strat-
egy to uncover the underlying funds for 1 year as well as zoom out to see all the 
underlying funds across all years. Figure 10.28 illustrates the display as a view 
into all the funds across all the years for one strategy. 
The overall effect of the All Years Directional Strategy chart is a big picture 
view of how the funds have performed over the years. The concentrations of 
performance returns, ranges, and size of the fund comprises this big picture 
view. To do so, this display uses the same visual elements of average marker, 
bubble rendering, and text display panel as well as a few others:
▸
▸Historical context—All funds are present and represent the years with 
a slight fade out to the earlier years; the effect pushes the earlier years 
to the background while highlighting the most current years to the 
foreground. 
▸
▸Negative returns—The negative returns, shown with a gray fill back-
ground, emphasizes the underwater funds that still managed to make it 
on the top 100 funds.

Figure 10.29  Fund Bubbles– All Years Collection
These three sequentially placed views enable you to analyze the results for each 
strategy. For example, you can see the differences in behaviors and track the 
recently ranked activity to answer: Which fund group observed the most 1Y 
negative returns? Which fund group shows the most promising 3Y returns track 
record? The collection enables you to be in a position to review the set and for-
mulate your own commentary to the observations. 
The full set of bubble charts provides flexibility and enables you to explore the 
collections of temporal bubbles within the context of the strategy averages. The 
interactive system promotes your understanding of the data by applying the fol-
lowing design methods: 
▸
▸Grouping—The top 100 hedge funds across 6 years results in 600 funds 
that are grouped into 9 strategies. You can isolate your observations by 

Strategy Analysis    377
showing the group averages and providing views that are exclusive to one 
strategy or 1 year. Grouping enables you to detect and articulate specific 
behaviors that become characteristic of the group. Side-by-side views of 
the groups enable you to contrast these behaviors and create a detailed 
description of the group as you search for and point out similarities and 
differences. 
▸
▸Drill-down—The ability to navigate through various levels, explore each 
level, and view details on demand all embody the drill-down method. The 
method provides a navigation structure to show where you are, where you 
were, and where you may go next. The transparent bubbles, navigation 
links, and display panel all support the drill-down design method. 
▸
▸Temporal Path—Temporal paths are a series of points connected in 
sequential order of time. As a design method, the path makes good on 
the phrase “The journey is more important than the destination” and 
accentuates the storyline that describes the temporal movements. Again, 
the technique of providing side-by-side views of the paths enables rich 
commentary to develop. 
Key Take-Aways
The interactive system showcases bubble plots as a conduit for exploring 
data and discovering hidden behaviors, trends, and outliers that may go 
unnoticed. Grouping data with averages and ranges, navigating through 
different levels, and seeing the linked temporal path are design methods 
to help you take notice and uncover how a strategy has performed over 
time, which funds make up those strategies, and how they compare to 
their peers. This section reviews the top 100 hedge funds at three levels:  
all strategies, individual strategies, and funds per strategy. The bubble plot 
system of interaction can be applied to other fund sets where the interest 
lies in understanding the rank of strategy category, percentage returns, 
size of fund, and firm AUM. Or you could also map different data to each 
axis and, for example, show the changes in risk versus reward the fund 
provides.

Summary
This chapter introduces new ways of interacting with data to rank, compare, 
and extract patterns across both small and large fund data sets. The chapter 
starts with the analysis of a single fund’s short and long exposures to display 
multivariate data and ends with an interactive display you can use to analyze 
top-performing strategies with hundreds of funds in one view. In both cases, 
the previously conceived methods of Chernoff Faces and Schneider’s Visual 
Information Seeking Mantra were referenced to show how you can apply those 
methods to create new visualizations. The visualization solutions include the 
following:
VISUALIZATION
DESCRIPTION
FIGURE
Butterfly Bar
Quantity represented with a continuous 
bar of opposing scales connected with a 
shared starting point.
10.1–10.3
Glyph
A symbol that uses marks to represent a 
specific meaning.
10.4–10.10
Encoded Glyph
A familiar object that uses the object’s 
characteristics to represent a specific 
meaning. 
10.11–10.15
Stacked Area
Layers of color fill that each represent a 
change in quantity for a variable.
10.16–10.18
Dot Matrix
Filled-in circles organized in a grid in 
which size indicates quantity.  
10.19
Bubble Plot 
Circles mapped to Cartesian coordinates 
in the form of bubbles that use color, 
size, transparency, outer rings, averages, 
temporal paths, and text display panels 
to layer in data points.
10.20–10.31
Each of the six visualizations serves a unique purpose and teach you key lessons 
along the way. The glyphs provide an identification system and prove to be an 
efficient method to communicate, decode, and see patterns emerge from the 
fund attributes. The stacked area shows you the changes in rank strategies and 
is a lesson in how you can recalculate and sort the data for better accuracy and 
perception. The dot matrix combines the category averages with minimum and 

Summary    379
maximum ranges to provide you with better context of rank and strategy attri-
butes. From dots to bubbles, the full data set of top hedge funds in the industry 
provide an interactive display with a lot of aggregate and detail data points for 
you to explore. The key take-away from the bubble display is the flexibility to 
see an overview of averages, to zoom into a year or strategy, to filter the display 
results, to see details of the meta-data on demand, and to select a number of 
views to compare. Just as the examples show you how to apply Chernoff Faces 
and Shneiderman’s patterns of use, you can apply specific methods, and con-
sider the lessons learned for your own data sets.

Data Visualization Principles11
What makes a data visualization successful? What principles should we adhere to? If we 
could establish guidelines to direct good visualization for representing financial data, 
what would be included in the list? To start, data visualizations should answer key ques-
tions from the perspective of the intended audience. Like a story, a visualization should 
provide a rich and unfolding perspective on the data that provides multiple answers 
to its audience members. It tells a factual story, fully embedded in the data: It should 
be clear and efficient—qualities that may at times be difficult to achieve. This chapter 
discusses three major data visualization principles in greater detail and grounds each 
principle with a list of guidelines and examples from previous chapters. The overarching 
recommendations we discuss include:
▸
▸Cater to your audience—Focus on the audience, the purpose, and the storyline 
for each visualization. Know your audience well enough that you can anticipate 
the series of questions they will have of the data.
▸
▸Provide clarity—Present the data with the utmost accuracy, transparency, and 
clarity. Be straightforward so that each visualization properly represents the data. 
▸
▸Be efficient—Strive to create effortless experiences for your audience. The visual-
ization should work so that your audience doesn’t have to.
﻿    383

384    Chapter 11: Data Visualization Principles
These data visualization principles expand on a traditional set of best practices 
for good visual design. Such best practices provide a foundation of a good com-
position using design elements such as a point, line, shape, value, texture, and 
color. Within a composition, design elements build on our cognitive and aes-
thetic sensibilities. The visualizations need to do that, too, but go beyond basic 
design practices to deal with the complexity of data. This chapter focuses on 
data visualization principles and references good design practices as needed. We 
incorporate design practices as they relate to these three basic rules. In this way 
the principles are comprehensive and incorporate the relevant design practices. 
As we review the principles, we review a list of guidelines to achieve each prin-
ciple. Adhering to the guidelines can help you to produce quality visualizations. 
The list of guidelines is illustrated with charts sourced from the other chapters 
in the book. You can go to the original presentation of the figure to refresh and 
gather more details about the chart. Together each principle, set of guidelines, 
and design practices provides you with a more specific multi-prong approach to 
producing a successful visualization. 
Cater to Your Audience
Visualizations reveal information contained in raw data. The job of the visual-
ization is to show what otherwise might be missed if the raw data alone were 
reviewed. Visualizations should be informative and show robust views of the 
data. They should pique your audience’s curiosity and ability to learn as much 
as possible. We create data visualizations to answer questions for others and 
ourselves. An engaging presentation of the data is vital to not only answer ques-
tions, but also to drive curiosity about what else the data can reveal. You can use 
specific guidelines to ensure you spur interest and meet your audience’s needs. 
To start, you need to identify the audience and the main storyline. First, ask 
yourself what is the main purpose of the visualization and what questions 
need to be answered by the visual. You also need to identify possible follow-
up questions. Next, identify how you can direct a storyline to reach both the 
stated objective and unasked questions that might arise. Following is a list of 

Cater to Your Audience    385
guidelines that can be adopted depending on the intentions and needs of the 
audience:
▸
▸Relevance—Consider the fact that different audiences will have different 
priorities and perspectives that matter to them. Provide flexible views of 
the data to adjust and satisfy various interests. For example, incorporate 
interactive custom weights that you can set to reflect the interests or 
expectations of your audience. The closer you can come to creating a dis-
play that shows their preferences, the more your audience will relate to 
the visualization. You can create relevance using other techniques such 
as incorporating your audience’s location, similar profile, or adjacent pro-
files, or any other data points that are timely and important now or in the 
near future. (Figure 11.1; reference: Figure 3.3 Results Framework) Fig-

▸
▸Context—Provide context to compare and relate the primary data 
against. Context examples include time series, peer group or category 
average, category quartiles, benchmark, and more. Layering in the 
benchmark is a standard practice of adding a reference point. It allows 
better comparison with a variation from the benchmark to be shown. 
However, incorporating more information like the three-color bands that 
serve as ratings adds even more reference points that both the fund and 
the benchmark can be compared to. In this way your audience can gain 
a better appreciation for what is good, very good, or excellent and where 
a fund is in comparison to the benchmark. A design best practice is to 
render the context points in the background with more subdued colors. 
The fund is represented in dark blue, whereas the reference benchmark 
is shown in the background in gray. (Figure 11.2; reference: Figure 9.40

▸Focus tilts—Be flexible with different possible perspectives of the data. 
Provide the same data with multiple views and emphasize different 
aspects of the data. Showing different aspects of the same data could 
involve a tilt toward short-term, long-term, historical, rank, cumulative, 
average, or variance performance results. As the views change, highlight 
where you want to draw your audience’s attention to provide a guided 
and focused experience. A good design practice is to create focus with 
the use of a bold color or thicker line weight. Entice your audience into 
examining different aspects of the data. In one case, you can provide 
cumulative ranking, and in another you might provide period average 
returns and compare those to the benchmark. Make sure each tilt is 
important to your audience. (Figures 11.3 and 11.4; reference: Figure 4.7

▸Relative and absolute values—For example, relative and absolute value 
pairings can be used across data sets to show the actual value and a value 
based on comparable ratios. Figure 11.5 pairs relative and absolute values 
into side-by-side views to provide better comparison. Your audience can 
see that the expense ratio was stable across the years in absolute terms, 
but then contrast the observation with a relative view that shows there 
was also a significant trend heading toward the top quartile. (Figure 11.5

▸Summary/detail—Show summary and detail information so that the 
reader can make connections between cause and effect. Allow your 
audience to drill in multiple levels to investigate and understand the 
underpinnings of a total value. Provide a way to zoom into more detailed 
views and review the information up close for inspection. Summary level 
views can include aggregated totals, metadata, or averages. Detail views 
can include specific numeric values, provide historical context, or offer a 
higher resolution of detail. A good design practice is to layer the details 
so that your audience can see the specifics within the context of the sum-
mary view. (Figure 11.6; reference: Figure 7.16 Integrated Waterfall)

▸Recalculation—Review the data for opportunities to reveal a new story 
through different calculations. Consider how you might recalculate 
the data to clarify the story. The overlap of holdings typically shows 
the relationship between two funds’ underlying assets as fund A is xx% 
of fund B and vice versa. The data is typically shown as a table matrix. 
The purpose of the table is to show which fund pairings have the most 
overlap of holdings. To best answer the overlap question, the data can be 
recalculated. The new calculation we have provided is the square root of 
the multiplication of those two relationships which are then organized 
into a histogram to see the distribution of overlapping investments 
across a firm. This allows your audience to quickly assess the range and 
concentrations of overlap at the multi-fund firm level. The interactive 
layer provides information about specific fund pairs. In addition, we have 
used color to further distinguish the funds with significant overlaps and 

Cater to Your Audience    391
those with low overlaps. This example of recalculations shows how to 
point out the underlying story of the data with the use of recalculation.

▸Categories—Help make discoveries by creating categories and grouping 
similar objects. Removing details and aggregating group data allows the 
main themes to surface. This enables you to see the big picture and not 
get lost in the details. A certain level of abstraction anchors the data 
and makes it more manageable to comprehend. Grouping can help to 
see results that might otherwise be missed in large and complex data 
sets. Grouping objects can start with a simple sort to order the data in a 
logical order of sequential incremental values, time, or type. (Figure 11.8;

▸Outliers—Distinguish and point out the outliers, the points that stand 
out. Make it simple to see what is different from the rest and set up a 
visual representation that shows those exceptions. Make it easy to see 
additional details to identify those outliers. Be vigilant with averages 
and aggregate values that strip data of underlying detail and hide the 
outliers. Provide information that shows just how much of an outlier the 
data point is. Distance, color, and bold outlines are all visual design prac-

394    Chapter 11: Data Visualization Principles
Highly informative visualizations create the knowledge needed to let you see 
what is actually happening with the data. The more you can proactively provide 
and anticipate your audience needs with the right information, the more you 
can expand their understanding of the data. Using these guidelines will improve 
the richness and quality of the visualization. As you think about catering to your 
audience, consider incorporating these guidelines:
▸
▸Show relevance to your audience. 
▸
▸Introduce context for better comparison.
▸
▸Provide focus tilts for more perspectives.
▸
▸Pair relative and absolute values for contrast.
▸
▸Connect the summary and detail data views.
▸
▸Reveal and simplify with a recalculation of the data. 
▸
▸Create categories to bubble up themes.
▸
▸Highlight outliers so that they are not missed. 
The guidelines are a list of considerations that you can apply and use according 
to your situation. Each item in the list can create better insights from the data to 
help you understand what the data means.
Provide Clarity
Accuracy, transparency, and accountability are all part of what it takes to 
visually present data in a clear, straightforward way. Creating a lucid visualiza-
tion embraces accuracy and truth at all levels. From the start, how the data is 
gathered needs to be accurate. In the end, the presentation of the data needs to 
be true to the data. Many visualizations are accurate but not as many are true to 
the data and present the data with clarity. 
It can be easy to misrepresent data and inadvertently create confusion. Compli-
cated lists of labels, lack of details, and poor use of color are just a few attributes 

Provide Clarity    395
in an unclear chart. Clarity means we need to remove the struggle of trying to 
understand a chart and make it easy to get the right information from the chart. 
For example, a Pie chart is a commonly used chart that can accurately repre-
sent percentage weights. Most are comfortable with reading this type of chart 
because it is so familiar. However, it is not always easy to get the right informa-
tion from a Pie chart. As soon as the number of slices increases to more than 
five, it becomes ineffective. The list of labels becomes harder to decode, details 
like the actual percentages are harder to see, and the colors needed to differenti-
ate each slice are harder to select. Tracking percentages across slices within a 
Pie chart or as a side-by-side comparison of more than one Pie chart is difficult 
to do. It is difficult for your audience to decode labels and compare results in a 
straightforward way. Yet, it is commonly used to communicate sector alloca-
tions and their variations. This is an example of a chart that is accurate but  
not always clear. 
Introducing transparency and accountability improves confidence in the chart. 
Transparency provides full disclosure and unveils the underlying calculations, 
definitions, and breakdown of an aggregated total. The more open a data visu-
alization is to showing how a total was derived, the relationship and linking 
between data sets and such, the more your audience will rely and trust the 
communication. If there is a question, the full disclosure provides your reader 
with the source that is accountable. A clear accountable visual representation of 
the data requires you to consider various aspects of the display. How is the data 
defined and calculated? How is the data depicted? All visualizations should:
▸
▸Use standard conventions in an organized display—Strong rationale 
should be present to deviate from well-known conventions to organize 
the data display. Unconventional/unexpected layouts should be high-
lighted for the reader’s awareness. Examples include reversing the direc-
tion of the x-axis or y-axis. 
▸
▸Provide accurate and proportional scale—If there is a variation of the 
scale, make sure to explicitly point out any modifications. 
▸
▸Cite data source(s)—Include the source of the data on all visuals. It 
communicates credibility to the reader. 

396    Chapter 11: Data Visualization Principles
▸
▸Provide clear labels—Data sets and markers should have labels to orient 
the reader and identify the subject matter and all involved data dimen-
sions. However, the use of labels should reflect your readers’ needs and 
their level of knowledge. For example, a novice user may need all data 
sets to be labeled and defined, while an expert may only need and want a 
few labels to orient themselves.
▸
▸Provide definitions and formulas—Not all labels will be inherently 
known; provide definitions with formulas when applicable.
▸
▸Display details and the breakdown of calculations—Provide a mecha-
nism to show supporting details to the primary display. If aggregated 
totals are shown, show the breakdown of the totals. 
▸
▸Consistently use visual elements—Each marker and visual element in a 
data visualization has a defined meaning. The use of each marker should 
consistently indicate the same meaning across the display system.
▸
▸Ensure different elements are distinguishable—Avoid confusion 
between elements and make sure to distinguish one element from 
another. For example, consider using markers that are different enough 
so that one marker is not easily confused with another. As another 
example, differentiate data representation, such as a line in a chart, from 
objects used for grouping or as callouts. 
The guidelines provided here are a start to ensuring the data is presented in a 
forthright manner. Although the list is tactical, it focuses on a baseline set of 
items that are recommended to follow and can be checked off as compliant. 
This next list is more directional. Depending on the type of inferences and over-
all message that needs to be conveyed with the data, different visual practices 
can be used. Part of being honest with the data is aligning the data and message 
with the right visual practices. The following are a few guidelines to consider:
▸
▸Edges—Precise versus estimate, static versus dynamic, and stable versus 
unpredictable are sample connotations that straight versus curved edges 
can communicate. Straight edges are typically used to communicate pre-
cision, static, and stable data. And round edges are used to communicate 

Provide Clarity    397
estimate, dynamic, and constantly changing unpredictable data. Make 
sure to select the edge with the type of data and the main message you 
would like to communicate with the data. (Figure 11.10; reference: Fig-

▸Markers—Triangle, line, dot, and the square are commonly used mark-
ers to point and identify certain items on a chart. Selecting which marker 
and how many markers to use impacts your audience’s understanding 
of the visualization. A large number of different markers can quickly 
overwhelm the visual. Limit markers and carefully select each. The 
triangle is a great marker for literally pointing out a precise spot or loca-
tion. The line as a marker can show continuation, alignment, levels, and 
connections with exactness. The dot can be used to show an endpoint, 
and because it is inherently rounded, it brings along the associations 
of dynamic and unstable, as stated previously. Last, the square is an 

398    Chapter 11: Data Visualization Principles
endpoint that communicates static and stable. (Figure 11.11; reference:

▸Color should be used carefully and sparingly. Too many colors make 
the display confusing and hard to decode. The fewer colors, the more 
successful they are as a communication instrument. Three is better than 
five and five is better than seven, and so on. More than seven colors in a 
display makes the visual harder to understand. George Miller’s cognitive 
load theory suggests our brain’s working memory can handle seven plus 
or minus two. The rule of thumb of maintaining seven or fewer items to 
track and decode also reduces our mental effort. Within a gradient, there 
can be a significant range of transitional colors. In this case, you can 

Provide Clarity    399
limit the major color blocks to three to five. The major colors can transi-
tion from one color to the next by blending the colors. The transition 
from one color to the next can help to identify ranges with more preci-
sion and minimize how many color blocks are required. (Figure 11.12;

▸Color provides meaning. Green means go, red means stop, and yellow 
means warning are each conventional uses of color. This use of color 
has been extended into our charts and dashboards as status of green for 
good, red for bad, and yellow for warning. Maintaining conventional 
color use makes the chart more familiar and understandable. If these 
three colors are used, we recommend to adjust to blue and red (instead 
of green and red) with orange (instead of yellow) for improved readability 
and greater accessibility across populations with color deficiencies. (Fig-
ure 11.13; reference: Figure 6.8 Segmented Butterfly)
Studies have shown that 8% of the male population and 0.5% of the female 
population worldwide cannot distinguish between green and red colors. In isola-
tion green can still be used to highlight something good and red can indicate 
something bad.

▸Color attracts our attention. Saturated color can be used to highlight 
or emphasize certain points. This technique is especially successful if the 
rest of the visual is constructed of grayscale or subdued, monochromatic 
elements. In Figure 11.14, color is used to point out results that passed a 
certain threshold. (Figure 11.14; reference: Figure 9.51 Bar and Pin Chart)

▸Color Gradients—Shades of a single color can show a stepped graduated 
scale. The technique can represent a continuous scale of values in one or 
two directions. When should a monochromatic scale be used instead of 
a grayscale and how? Because color conveys meaning as discussed in the 
previous point, you should match the color to communicate a specific 
meaning. Is the graduated scale positive or negative? Assign the color that 
best represents the data accordingly. The list of options include
▸
▸Achromatic gradients are created with black, white and shades of 
gray. Grayscale gradients from black to white can be used to show 
neutral or unknown representation of the data.

402    Chapter 11: Data Visualization Principles
▸
▸Monochromatic gradients are based on a color scale that progres-
sively changes from light to dark shades of a single color. You can 
use this gradient to convey a message with color and emphasize the 
values mapped to the darker shades of the color.
▸
▸Polychromatic gradients are based on a color scale that progressively 
blends two or more colors. Heatmaps are common applications of 
polychromatic gradients because they associate values to shades of 
two colors. Multiple color values of three or more associates groups 
of values, like percentage change in a scale, with color bands.
(Figure 11.15; reference Figure 6.2: Marimekko Chart – Monochro-
matic Gradient. Figure 11.15 adjusts the orientation of the chart. This 
adjustment shows how adaptable the chart is and prominently places 
the dark color values of the gradient.)

Truthful communications start with factual data and end with presenting the 
data as clearly as possible. The craft of creating clarity in a visualization is part

art and part science. The science part of the craft is the list of guidelines that are 
tactical and can be checked off as being completed. Adding the source, includ-
ing the right label, and providing definitions are simple checklist items that are 
easy to incorporate. The art part involves judgment. Deliberate decisions define 
what and how you should apply lines/edges, markers, color, and gradients. The 
design practices listed in the chapter introduction provide guidance to each of 
these elements. Within the areas of subjectivity, the guidelines can be used to 
help direct the message that needs to be conveyed with the data. 
Be Efficient
Data visualizations should make the experience as effortless as possible. The 
chart should do the majority of the hard work so that your reader does not have 
to. At the start, the main premise to creating a visual representation of the data 
is to maximize understanding and make the data more accessible. To make this 
point clear, consider the efficiency gains of a small data set, a data set that easily 
fits on one page or one screen (without scrolling). A table with 10 columns and 
10 rows of data represents 100 data points. To compare and extract meaning 
from the possible relations between all these points can become close to impos-
sible. The calculation requires having to go through 4,950 possible permutations 
of the data pairs. Maximized outputs with minimal effort as an input are both 
qualities that point to efficiency. A visual representation may show the impor-
tant connections and comparisons between these 100 data points and relieve 
the user of the impossible cognitive task of numerical analysis of 4,950 connec-
tions. Therefore at the start, designing visual communications translates into 
less work and effort for the readers. 
Transforming text into visuals can require more than a straight translation 
from one to the other. More can and should be done to create an efficient 
experience. In this respect, you should always look to see what can be added to 
create a more complete picture of the data as well as what can be pushed to the 
background or removed completely to simplify and provide your audience with 
more focus. The following are guidelines to this additive and subtractive process 
of making the visualization more efficient. 

404    Chapter 11: Data Visualization Principles
Additive Guidelines
▸
▸Create structure and hierarchy—Make sense of the data for your reader 
by organizing the structure and hierarchy. Figure 11.16 shows a grid 
structure that organizes the chart to be read horizontally and vertically; 
the dots make the order ambivalent. A design practice to achieve hier-
archy is to use the position, order, color, line weight, and size of a mark 
to assign levels of importance. For example, provide primary informa-
tion in the foreground of the chart and secondary information in the 
background. In this way, the information is communicated and read in 
sequential order to prioritize importance of certain data sets over others.

▸Provide reusable design elements—Create core visual elements and 
use them across a set of charts to reduce the audience’s need to learn 
additional meanings for those elements. A visual element can have 

Be Efficient    405
specific meaning that requires some initial training to understand. 
When learned, the visual element can be reused and benefit from greater 
familiarity. Be consistent in how the element is applied but not neces-
sarily uniform in how it is rendered. The element should have the same 
meaning but can be rendered differently if placed within a different tool. 
The visual element can be reused and be a part of a larger family set of 
elements. In the quote example shown in Figure 11.17, the moving ball 
bounces to show value change. This element is applied in successive 
charts to show the same meaning but is not uniformly rendered. The 
element does not need to be identical to be consistent and yet eliminate 
relearning. (Figure 11.17; reference: Figure 5.25 Visual System)

▸Leverage our ability to see patterns—The way our eyes see allows us 
to recognize faces and detect patterns. You can leverage this fact to cre-
ate visualizations that connect data sets to recognizable objects. After 
you have encoded the object with a schematic diagram, the learned 
characteristics can be quickly decoded. As the Chernoff Fish example in 
Figure 11.18 shows, the legend identifies attributes of a fish with attributes 
of the data. This creates a system that makes it possible to classify a school 
of fish into categories. (Figure 11.18; reference: Figure 10.11 Chernoff Fish)

▸Make everything legible—Ensure the information is easy to read and 
legible. The font, image size, contrast, line weight, and color all contrib-
ute to ensuring readable results. Legibility can also be dependent on the 
audience and environment. For example, a white background is best in 
a well-lit  environment; a black background is best in a darker, low-light 
environment. That way, the background matches the environment, 
removing the need for your eyes to adjust. The delivery channel should 
also be considered; paper, screen, projections, and so on all have differ-
ent legibility considerations. For screen display, all marks should have 
enough contrast with a sufficient line weight and differentiating use of 

Be Efficient    407
color. The white and black background displays shown in the figure affect 
the color selection of the dots. In the white display, the middle band uses 
teal dots, whereas in the black display they are replaced with yellow dots. 
Using yellow in the white version would not provide enough contrast to 
be as legible as the other color dots. (Figure 11.18; reference Figure 4.22

▸Add supporting details—Incorporate details into the visual as an aid to 
support and help see the representation with greater ease and less confu-
sion. One example includes adding bar grid lines as units to track and tie 
back to the numeric scale. Another example includes a light gray shade 
fill where the % is present. These two details make the chart efficient 
in tracking the percentages and comparing dollar totals. A third detail 
in the chart is the notch that shows difference between gross and net 
returns. And a forth includes the dotted line for benchmark. Although 
you could use three bar charts to show the two returns and the bench-
mark, Figure 11.20 instead shows one consolidated yet detailed bar per 
year. (Figure 11.20; reference: Figure 6.6 Interlocking Blocks)

Subtractive Guidelines
▸
▸Don’t overload—Do not burden your audience with too much stimula-
tion at once; instead provide filters and/or additional data displays on 
demand. One way to minimize overload is to remove information from 

Be Efficient    409
the display. Figure 11.21 provides filters by both strategy type and year to 
help create focus. It also layers in the precise numeric values on demand 
and as supporting evidence. Progressively disclose detail views or addi-
tional views as needed. However, as comparisons are needed, ensure 
that additional detail includes the comparison data in the same view. 
Although you don’t want to overload the display, you also don’t want to 
limit the display for detail comparison. The  figure shows one layer of 
details. Also, allow your audience to compare more than one layer of 
details so that you provide the ability to see multiple fund performances 
and read the details all in one view. (Reference the display panel view of:

▸Remove mental mapping—Efforts to make connections or decode 
encoded labels should be removed or minimized. If you point to one 
data set to then compare it against another and jot those two points 
down on paper, then the visualization is not doing its job. The visualiza-
tion should be designed to bring those two points together so that the 
comparison can be done in a side-by-side mode. (Figure 11.22; reference:

▸Consolidate labels—Consolidate, concatenate, and abbreviate labels 
as much as possible without introducing confusion. Data needs to be 
labeled to orient and explain any data visualization. However, smartly 
and elegantly labeling the data sets can improve the representation. For 
example, instead of making a legend, directly label items in context of 
the display. If legends are required, place the legend in close proximity 
to the data headers so that the labels work for both the headers and the 
legend. (Figure 11.23; reference: Figure 9.48 Label Consolidation)

▸Combine related charts—This guideline minimizes the number of 
charts that need to be reviewed. Our example consolidates six charts 
into one and makes direct connections across all data sets. Instead of 
having to review multiple charts, your audience now has to review only 
one. If the data sets allow, as in Figure 11.24 and Figure 11.25, apply this 
approach to reduce the display size required. (Reference: Figure 8.26 Bar

Sometimes, displaying less information is more effective, and other times more 
in a display is helpful. Our list rationalizes the two and shows what can be done 
to display the data more efficiently. All these guidelines can be applied to make 
an efficient visualization. The set of guidelines below encompass how to add 
more to a display or how to reduce, remove, and consolidate:

There are levels to efficiency you can strive to achieve. Being efficient requires 
you to replace complex charts that are hard to comprehend with simple ones 
that require less effort. Your focus to do so will result in benefits of speed and 
accuracy: quicker action taken based on confident understanding of the data 
and better decisions based on clearer insights. 
Summary
The principles outlined in this chapter can direct the design of your visualiza-
tion to ensure it caters to your audience to anticipate and answer their ques-
tions in a clear and efficient way. The goal of these combined principles is to 
create a reliable display of the data so that your audiences feel confident in their 
understanding of it. To recap, each principle has a set of guidelines and inte-
grated visual design practices that show you how to follow each principle. (See 
the following table.)
The result of following these principles creates a solution that is reliable and 
actively sought after to present data. Beyond a solution, the visual representa-
tion starts to create a shared understanding of the data. Visually articulating a 
data set can create instant knowledge share for you and your audience. As your 
visual representations become more sophisticated, your fluency in data conver-
sations will, too.

Implementing the Visuals 12
This chapter offers a structured approach for determining how and when to implement 
the visualization ideas presented in this book. As we will show, there are many facets 
to deciding how to select an implementation method: The uniqueness, complexity, and 
interactivity of the visuals are just a few. Depending on the situation, implementation 
may entail building a custom solution with available charting packages, using an open 
source programming language, or using visualization software. Although growing rap-
idly, the methods for implementing visuals are still in the early stages. Simply knowing 
what methods are available will help you determine how to proceed. However, rather 
than advocating the use of specific tools, we provide a framework to help you assess 
what type of tools and resources will work best in your own case. 
To provide a better sense of how to apply the framework, we present three project 
examples that showcase a range of requirements and implementation possibilities. From 
a small project to a large one, this chapter clarifies what elements you must consider in 
order to implement a visualization solution. 
Job one for selecting an implementation method requires evaluating the business value 
of the visualization against your resources and capabilities. Perhaps the visualization is 
simple to implement and you do not need additional resources—or perhaps not. Regard-
less, ask yourself: Do you have the skill-set needed to implement the visualization? Which 
implementation approach best suits your needs? How do you prioritize among a list of 
projects? What new resources are required? A spectrum of business criteria, includ-
ing the importance of the visualization and the frequency of its use, and whether it’s 
﻿    417

418    Chapter 12: Implementing the Visuals 
intended internally for staff members or externally for clients, can also be taken 
into account. 
The second part of the selection process outlined in our framework focuses 
closely on assessing the effort required to implement the visualization based on 
their level of complexity. As part of that, we show that audience needs and orga-
nizational requirements are two of the most important variables to consider.
Finally, we offer a way to compare possible visualization projects and score their 
viability based on a side-by-side assessment.
Business Value Assessment 
Well-designed data visualizations can provide significant business value. 
They can improve efficiency and reduce costs by saving time, provide effective 
decision-making displays, and produce quality communications. As we assess 
the business value of each project, assume each of the visual solutions have been 
thoughtfully crafted and executed to satisfy the audience. The decision, then, 
comes down to selecting the data visualization(s) that will provide the most 
business value. 
The Business Value Assessment (BVA) outlined below calculates how impactful 
a new visualization solution will be and provides guidance about whether you 
should proceed to implement it. It also helps answer the critical follow-up ques-
tion: How should I implement the solution? A well-thought-out BVA connects 
the visualization solution to business drivers, purposes, and goals. Essentially, 
it provides a mini-business case into the value of the project. With the informa-
tion in hand, the BVA can help to assess not just one project, but many. Perhaps 
the question is not just whether you should take on this project, but which 
project(s) should you take on this year? The BVA framework can prioritize proj-
ects and provide a straightforward method for project comparison. 
The BVA is based on five core factors that each connect to a five-point scale. The 
higher the ranking, the more appropriate the effort. However, each firm needs 
to assess the relative associations of high or low efforts. A higher level of effort 

Business Value Assessment     419
for one firm may be small to another. Consider and rank the following criteria 
to assess overall business value:
▸
▸Business critical—How important or core to your business is the imple-
mentation solution? Will the solution greatly impact how your business 
runs by improving efficiency? Can it help improve communications, 
increase understanding, reduce risk, improve accuracy, raise stan-
dards, and enable you to be more competitive? Will the project enable 
you to increase your revenue? Does the solution impact downstream 
or upstream processes? Can the solution be reused across different 
applications?
▸
▸External facing—Will the solution be used for prospects, clients, and at 
private events or public conferences to display thought leadership? Will 
the solution improve how your clients perceive you? 
▸
▸Internal facing—Will the solution be used internally for staff members? 
Will the solution be used in one organizational group or across multiple 
groups/functions at the firm?
▸
▸Frequency of use—How often will the visualization be used—quarterly, 
monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly? 
▸
▸Number of users—How many people will interact in some capacity 
with the solution—dozens, hundreds, or thousands? Although you may 
release the project to hundreds of users, you may find that it applies or is 
adopted only by a few dozen. Consider how many users will benefit from 
the project and include all user types, ranging from the occasional user 
to the target user.
Criteria within the core functions, target audience, and frequency of use assess 
the overall impact. If the implementation will be used frequently and by a high 
number of users, improved visual tools can quickly show a return on the effort. 
If the BVA score is low, consideration may still be taken to implement some 
level of an improved visual that provides the user with a better communication. 

420    Chapter 12: Implementing the Visuals 
As you review each ranking, consider the overall business impact to make the 
right decision faster. 
The BVA lists each criterion with equal weights as a simple starting point. 
However, proprietary weights for each criterion can also be included. Out of 
the five individual BVA criteria, some firms may put more emphasis on cli-
ent communications and would assign the external facing criterion a higher 
percentage weight. Other firms may focus on operational improvements and 
would therefore provide higher weights to the internal facing metric. Once 
weights are assigned, they can be used as the standard for prioritizing work. 
This can create a more objective method for selecting project work. As illus-
trated in Figure 12.1, the categorical relative weights stack the BVA score into 
an aggregated value scale of high, medium, and low.

Figure 12.1  BVA Criteria

Business Value Assessment     421
A formulaic approach that assigns varying numeric values to each criterion 
provides a precise measurement as well. The BVA formula is B = ∑ (B1×W1), 
(B2×W2), (B3×W3), (B4×W4), (B5×W5), in which B represents the business 
score, B1-B5 represents the business criteria, and W1–W5 represent the weights, 
such that the sum of all the weights (W1–W5) equals to 1. 
You may have noticed that the formula does not include resources like time and 
budget. It would be a mistake to include available time and budget in the BVA 
model as inputs. Instead, time and budget need to be provided and established 
as outputs of the assessment. When the BVA is completed, the results should 
demonstrate the impact of the visual solution and how it could replace the 
legacy system, improving cost and time efficiency. As outputs, time and budget 
should be connected to the business value and complexity of the solution for 
full alignment and support of business goals. Using this orientation, the state-
ment “We don’t have the budget for that” goes away and instead becomes “We 
can’t afford not to create a better solution.” The concern that “We just don’t 
have the time to focus on that solution” is replaced with “We will save time if we 
focus on a better solution.” 
Often times, deciding between multiple projects that you believe will improve 
the business as usual model may be a challenge. If you cannot take on mul-
tiple projects at once, deciding how to select the project that will be the most 
impactful to the business can be difficult. Figure 12.2 provides a sample of 
three projects that have applied the BVA approach. The projects show different 
criteria rankings that result in different aggregate totals for the normalized 
business value.
You may have noticed that each of these projects was introduced in a previous 
chapter. Each of these projects have the same firm weights, varying criteria lev-
els that are specific to the project. Yet, two of the three produce similar results 
within the medium total business value band. But the total business value is 
not the final criteria for your project selection. There is more to the framework. 
The next part of the framework includes the implementation effort based on the 
complexity of the visual solution.

Implementation Effort
The implementation effort should take into account your audience needs, the 
firm’s requirements for the solution, as well as the complexity of the solution. 

Implementation Effort    423
With that in mind, the points listed below are sample considerations that can 
be adjusted or extended based on your situation. In addition, consideration of 
the implementation effort extends beyond the visual solution, also requiring an 
analysis of the appropriate delivery channel. The first question to ask is what 
delivery channels need to be supported by the effort. You should make sure that 
these channels are tightly aligned to where, when, and how your audience will 
access the visual solution. Delivery channels range from print to interactive 
installation. They include but are not limited to the following:
▸
▸Print—Paper presentation materials for a meeting or event
▸
▸Large screen—Screen presentation for group use
▸
▸Desktop/laptop—Screen display for individual desk use
▸
▸Mobile—Phone or tablet access 
▸
▸Wearable—Embedded displays in wearable devices, including smart-
watches, optical and projected displays, sensory and connected devices 
within the Internet of Things (IoT). 
▸
▸Interactive installation—Gesture or sound activation in a physical space
The visual solution should be 1) optimized for the selected delivery channels, 2) 
consistent across the selected channels, and 3) seamlessly integrated between 
the digital channels. If more than one delivery channel is required, you need to 
consider how the visual communication manifests itself across those channels 
and how to take advantage of the strengths of each. 
Understanding your audience’s needs also extends into assessing how simple or 
complex the solution needs to be. More features are not always better whereas 
simple solutions can leave your audience asking for more rigor. The visual solu-
tion needs to address the correct level of needs and map those back to the task 
at hand. Provided the task needs are well defined and identified, the following 
are a few considerations of complexity to help define the scope:
▸
▸Uniqueness—How conventional is the visual solution? Is it a commonly 
used bar chart or is the visual more unusual or even unique? Does it 
require creating a new chart type or can it utilize existing chart elements?

424    Chapter 12: Implementing the Visuals 
▸
▸Delivery channels—As discussed above, the delivery channels can vary 
dramatically. Does the solution need to support just physical presenta-
tions, or do more varying digital aspects of a digital experience need to 
be considered? Or, would a spatial physical experience be more effective? 
▸
▸Entitlements—How many user profiles need to be configured? One user 
may be entitled to full access while another is granted limited access. 
▸
▸Language/localization translation—Are there different language or 
localization needs based on a regional population? How many languages 
does the solution need to support? Does the solution need to support the 
metric and/or the imperial (U.S.) system of measurement?
▸
▸Integration—How many applications need to be integrated into the 
visual solution? Are these applications internal or external? Are the data 
feeds open and available?
▸
▸Interactivity—How many layers of data displays are there to navigate? 
How extensive is the data manipulation required to recalculate or filter 
sets of results? How many screens need to be designed and implemented?
▸
▸Multiple releases—Do you foresee a phased approach to the implemen-
tation with multiple releases? Will there be future implementations or 
improvements to the visual solution? Do the dependencies between each 
phase increase the number of releases?
▸
▸Data refresh—Is the data static or streaming, and what are the refresh 
rates to the display?
▸
▸Data volume—How large is your data set? How large do you expect your 
data set to be in 6 months to 1 year and beyond?
This criteria list can use the same framework as the BVA to visualize and esti-
mate a score and indicate complexity. The resulting Complexity Score, as shown 
in Figure 12.3, illustrates a scalable framework that is designed to incorporate 
additional criteria. The flexibility of the Complexity Score framework enables 
you to customize your criteria list and make it as comprehensive as you need.

Figure 12.3  Complexity Criteria
Similar to Figures 12.1 and 12.2, a basic formula can represent the same visual. 
The formula that represents Figure 12.3 is C = ∑ (C1×R1), (C2×R2), (C3×R3), 
(C4×R4)… (C9×R9), in which C represents the complexity score, C1–C9 rep-
resent the complexity criteria, and R1–R9 represent the weights, such that the 
sum of all the weights (R1–R9) is equal to 1. This formulaic approach answers 
the question “Should I use a tool with prebuilt solutions or design a custom 
solution?” The more complex the solution, the more custom changes typically 
occur. In addition, the more demand for control and flexibility to modify, the 
more likely a custom solution is required. 
Another possibility is that you may need to compare a list of projects that you 
would like to implement. Figure 12.4 displays three hypothetical projects. These 
are the same projects from the previous BVA list. The complexity assessment 
results combine the inputs and outputs into one view so that you can see how 
the influential factors add up.

The same framework produces a cumulative weighted bar chart that informs 
the level of effort required to implement projects from prebuilt to custom 
endeavors. 
After completing this assessment, and examining the bar chart, you will be 
more prepared to discuss your implementation needs and the extent of effort. 
This method is meant to guide you through the main points and provide 
guidance toward a better assessment. It is a precursor to a project plan that 
a program or project manager might create. The variable criteria within the 
complexity assessment reflect the assumptions that drive the project scope and 
ultimately the implementation plan. What it does not provide is an assessment 
of the ongoing maintenance and support of the solution.
The next section reviews various options for implementing visuals to further 
address the question of whether to use a prebuilt package/framework or to build 
a custom solution and what those options require.
Available Methods 
The current available methods for implementing interactive visualizations 
include statistical software packages, technical computing languages, visual-
ization software packages, online tools, open source programming languages, 
close-ended web-based libraries, open web-based libraries, and, of course, 
custom code in a proprietary programming language. These solutions range in 
programing skills required, design flexibility, and interoperability. Although 
they are changing and expanding continuously, they can be organized into 
three categories:
▸
▸Prebuilt solutions that require no programming—These include visual-
ization software packages and online tools. Prebuilt solutions are the least 
flexible, provide canned solutions, and require little-to-no design skills. 
There are a mix of prebuilt examples. Some, with more robust features 
and greater flexibility, require licensing, whereas the least flexible set of 
options are free to the public.

428    Chapter 12: Implementing the Visuals 
▸
▸Prebuilt solutions that require some programming—Examples 
include statistical software packages, technical computing languages, 
and close-ended web-based libraries. Adjustments to the visuals are 
minimal and, as such, required design skills are minimal. Although 
some of these are free, a few, such as the technical computing languages, 
require a license.
▸
▸Custom solutions—These solutions are open canvasses and allow for the 
most flexibility. Examples include open source programming languages 
and open web-based libraries. There is no charge to use these solutions. 
However, programming and design skills are required to create thought-
fully implemented or customized solutions. 
The options in the custom solutions bracket require a combination of skillset 
and implementation resources. For example, the right mix of analytics, design, 
and programming capabilities need to be acquired. Programming skills will 
depend on the technical stack used for implementation and will need to mirror 
the implementation language. For example, if D3 is used, then having someone 
with strong HTML5 and Java scripting skills is key. Design skill requirements 
include a user research/data analyst who understands the task and data sets, 
and analytical visual designers who can structure the visual aspects of the visu-
alization and ensure they are well composed. In more robust solutions, a mix of 
all these skills is needed to define the overall experience of the visualizations. 
Solution Score
The final comprehensive assessment considers business value and complexity 
to deliver a solid metric. Outputs from the Business Value Assessment and 
Complexity Assessment become inputs for the Solution Score grid by layering 
in the coordinates as project scores. A simple rank view across projects is pro-
duced with Figure 12.5, Solution Score. The final Solution Score is produced 
by 1) placing the project scores onto the grid; 2) mapping them back to the 
consideration line; and finally 3) delineating an exact rank within a high-to-
low consideration scale.

As illustrated in Figure 12.5, the formula for the final project solution is S = B + 
C, such that B is the business score, C is the complexity score, and S is the solu-
tion score. The culmination of assessing business value and complexity assigns 
a ranked score to each project. Each score lands within one of the nine squares. 
Rotating the grid automatically lists each project in prioritized order from top 
to bottom. As an estimation tool, the project rank listing and overall Solution 
Score formula guides the project direction to assign the right resources, effort, 
and level of review to the project.

The Solution Score combines the business value and complexity scores and 
enables multiple projects to be plotted and compared at once. Next, Figure 12.6 
plots our three projects: 1) Ticker in the Lobby 2), Statement of Cashflows, and 
3) Performance Attribution. The resulting rank shows Statement of Cashflows 
at the top rank for consideration, New Ticker as the second, and Performance 
Attribution as the third.

and benefits and can be used together or independent of each other. The for-
mula provides a simple ranked list of each project with a corresponding BVA 
and complexity score. The formulaic approach may be all you need to decide 
upon subsequent actions to take. You don’t have to create a visual to assess 
a visualization project. However, if you would like to see how the results are 
derived, then a visual is useful. Figures 12.2, 12.4, and 12.6 provide a visual 
explanation of the formula. The visuals show you how the weights for each crite-
rion impact each score and how the combined score is plotted and ranked. The 
visual highlights which criteria contribute the most to the final score. 
Similar to our weighted criteria list, you can also add weights (as shown in Fig-
ure 12.7) to the business value or complexity. This is an optional step that might 
apply if you also have to consider a department’s additional input as a final step 
in the process. Or, it can reflect a firm’s quarterly sentiment towards project 
selection. For example, the pull toward business value preference can provide 
flexibility and tugs against the pull toward complexity preference, which can 
provide immediacy. The former typically connects to longer-term solutions, 
whereas the latter is a usually connected with shorter-term solutions.

Figure 12.7  Pivot Bias

432    Chapter 12: Implementing the Visuals 
Pivoting the 3×3 grid to the right or left to change the balanced 45-degree angle 
view introduces a macro-level weighted system. A business value bias (left grid 
in Figure 12.7) reinforces and supports a longer-term (strategic placement) 
investment into the solution by ranking a project tied to a custom solution 
at a more elevated level of consideration. In contrast, a push toward a solu-
tion consideration bias (right grid in Figure 12.7) places the emphasis on the 
near-term (speed to market) solution. The solution consideration bias elevates 
and increases the rank status of a likely prebuilt solution. The 15-degree tilt in 
Figure 12.7 represents a macro weight adjustment of an additional 1/3 toward 
business value or complexity. As a comparison, a 45-degree tilt toward the 
right would represent a complete 100% business value bias. The formula that 
represents a business bias is S = 1/45(45-D) C + 1/45(45+D) B such that S is the 
Solution Score, D is the degree of bias, C is the Complexity Score, and B is the 
Business Score. The formula that represents a complexity bias is S = 1/45(45+D) 
C + 1/45(45-D) B such that S is the Solution Score, D is the degree of bias, C is 
the Complexity Score, and B is the Business Score. The pivot can significantly 
change the rank order of the listed projects.
As stated above, the bias formulas are optional but can be useful to apply under 
certain conditions. For example, in the event your firm was to license a certain 
implementation package, then you may want to apply the complexity bias for-
mula to re-evaluate the project list. If you need to differentiate yourself in the 
market place then the business bias formula directly applies to your needs.
Summary
A well-constructed data visualization capability provides significant value for 
your firm. It improves how your firm is perceived—as one with advanced meth-
ods of displaying, communicating, and analyzing data. It also enhances your 
own ability to make meaning from the data and “see” what may otherwise go 
unnoticed. All told, data visualizations can give you the extra edge you need to 
make decisions with a higher level of confidence. 
If you currently use spreadsheets and tables to evaluate and present data, you 
may likely want and need to convert those data tables into data visualizations. 

Summary    433
Therefore, if you have limited time and resources, selecting which projects to 
transform to data visualizations becomes an important step. As shown in this 
chapter, an informed assessment can be done to delineate the business value 
and project complexity. 
Using the system described herein provides a framework to determine the value 
of projects and decide which implementation method you should consider and 
why. Used as a visual and formulaic assessment tool, each part of the framework 
can derive an output. The framework removes the guesswork and creates a 
standard for project assessment and comparisons. With the mini-business case 
and directional ideas of the complexity in hand, you are now that much closer 
to implementing your data visualization projects.
