Label Statements 
●
Labels are used in  break, continue, and goto statements.  
●
It is illegal to deﬁne a label that is never used. 
●
In contrast to other identiﬁers, labels are not block scoped and do not conﬂict with 
identiﬁers that are not labels. They live in another space. 
●
The scope of a label is the body of the function in which it is declared and excludes the 
body of any nested function.
●
Most of the time labels are used to terminate outer enclosing loops.
