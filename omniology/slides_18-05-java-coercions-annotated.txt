Java Coercions

Java Coercions 
• Java allows primitive types to be coerced in certain 
contexts.   
 
• In 1 + 2.0, the int 1 is widened to a float 1.0 
 
• A coercion is really just a primitive function the compiler 
inserts for you 
– Most languages have extensive coercions between 
base numeric types

Java Coercions 
• Java distinguishes two kinds of coercions & casts: 
– Widening   always succeed   (int  float) 
– Narrowing  may fail if data can’t be converted to 
desired type (float  int, downcasts) 
 
• Narrowing casts must be explicit 
 
• Widening casts/coercions can be implicit

What is the only type in Java for which there are no 
coercions/casts defined?

• Coercions  can lead to surprising behavior 
– Consider an example from PL/I 
– Let A,B,C be strings of 3 characters 
 
B = ‘123’ 
C = ‘456’ 
A = B + C 
 
• What is A?
