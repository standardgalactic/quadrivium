To dramatize the threat posed by cyber attacks, pyrotechnics expert
Drew Jiritano attached an explosive squib to the back of a laptop 
computer; stop-motion photography captured the results. PM's digital 
imaging specialist Anthony Verducci completed the concept.

DAVID E. COLE
Chairman, Center for 
Automotive Research 
David Cole says he  
can’t predict what 2009 
has in store for the auto 
business as a whole,  
but, using his knowledge 
of the automotive 
environment, he is 
advising government  
and media groups on 
changes in the industry 
and what they imply for 
the future. One current 
project is to explain the 
turbulent times in the 
automotive sector to 
bankers making lending 
decisions.

PM Lab vs. TV Claims
I so enjoyed your article on
produs, “If You A Now ...” 
A friend gave me a set of the 
as-seen-on-TV Aqua Globes you 
teﬆed, and though they are a 
good idea, I found one of the 
ﬆems so tight I couldn’t even 
get water into the bulb.

anks for supersizing me—
I truly enjoyed your ﬆory “Mega 
Vehicles.” I only wish you 
had highlighted the Antonov 
An-225 Mriya as the world’s 
largeﬆ aircra. Getting a close 
glimpse of that colossal jet 
would have provided a titanic 
ending to the ﬆory.

Future in Space
As a 40-year space program
veteran, I was both intereﬆed 
and saddened by February’s 
ﬆory about competing pro-
posals for the next generation 
of launch vehicles, “NASA and 
Its Discontents.” It seems much 
of the cultural arrogance I expe-
rienced as a graduate ﬆudent 
in the ’60s ﬆill exiﬆs today. A 
better solution than NASA’s 
Ares proposal would be to take 
the already-proven enhanced 
expendable launch vehicles as 
the basis for a new personnel 
launch vehicle. It’s sad to see 
Dr. Griﬃn defending a badly 
ﬂawed program, and I hope 
he’s given his walking papers.
CHARLES P. KELLE Y
OKLAHOMA CITY, OK
e Jupiter Dire will never
get oﬀ the ground. Why would 
NASA throw away four years 
of work and inveﬆment on 
Ares? NASA evaluated the 
Jupiter proposal and found it 
seriously wanting on a number 
of points, including safety and 
coﬆ. Hiﬆory will catch up with 
Jupiter Dire and the plan  
will be long forgotten by the 
time Proje Conﬆellation is 
on the moon.

Inspeing high-rise conﬆruion sites is a 
dangerous job, but somebody—or some 
robot—has to do it. Engineers at Virginia Tech built 
the HyDRAS-Ascent II to climb by encircling a beam 
and twiﬆing its 90-degree joints in sequence. In 
December, the robot won the grand prize at the 
Capﬆone Design Fair in Seoul, South Korea, 
competing againﬆ experimental robots, eleronic 
gizmos and other novel hardware. Traveling with 
HyDRAS isn’t easy—co-designer and dooral 
ﬆudent Gabriel Goldman had to explain the 
contents of his carry-on suitcase at every airport-
security checkpoint. “I know to take oﬀ my  
shoes,” Goldman says. “e only thing they had  
a problem with was my robot.”

Experimental Eagle
+ NASA recently ﬁnished a program that
may aid the return of supersonic commer-
cial ﬂights. During teﬆs at NASA’s
Dryden Flight Research Center in
Edwards, Calif., two uniquely modded
F-15 Eagles ﬂew as close as 100  apart
to measure the leading aircra’s shock
waves, while the lead pilot reconﬁgured
the wings and direion of the engines’
nozzles. Shock waves cause sonic booms
that limit ﬂights over populated areas.
e NF-15B (above) is ideal for ﬆudying
airplane geometry because its canards,
borrowed from the horizontal ﬆabilizers
of an F-18, can be adjuﬆed in ﬂight.
Avatars of Exercise 
One of the trickieﬆ parts of exercise is maintaining good form to aivate 
the right muscles. A new syﬆem developed by Amﬆerdam-based Motek 
Medical displays a virtual body double showing exaly which muscles are 
being used and how much force they’re generating—in real time. Users of 
the Human Body Model wear a suit with 47 reﬂeive markers that are 
illuminated by infrared ﬆrobe lights that ﬂash several hundred times a 
second. Eight high-speed cameras and force sensors in the ﬂoor capture 
data that is used to create models of the user’s movements and the force 
that those motions generate. e syﬆem is being teﬆed in Israel to help 
patients recover movement aer a ﬆroke; it could also provide an early 
diagnosis of conditions such as muscular dyﬆrophy.
Hard as Steel, Easy as Plaﬆic 
+ A new plaﬆic that condus elericity
has been developed by German
scientiﬆs at the Fraunhofer Inﬆitute for
Manufauring Technology and Applied
Materials Research. e composite
material combines the elerical and
thermal properties of metal with the
easy manufauring of plaﬆic. Research-
ers have developed conduive polymers
suitable for wires and circuit boards, but
the new, lightweight material could ﬁnd
wider use in vehicles. For example,
aircra could use lightweight, conduc-
tive fuselage panels that dissipate the
charges from midair lightning ﬆrikes.


Because they 
heat water 
on demand, 
tankless units 
provide a 
nearly endless 
supply of 
hot water. 
Additionally, 
units provide 
ample ﬂoor 
space savings of 12-16 
square feet. Contact your 
local propane retailer and 
plumber/HVAC contractor to 
get one installed. 
Tankless water heaters cost 
up to 60% less to operate 
than a standard electric unit 
and typically last 10-15 years 
longer than a standard unit 
(this is due to corrosion of 
tank units). For units installed 
in 2009, Federal tax credits 
are available, and propane 
customers in several states can 
receive rebates for switching 
out electric water heaters.
Save Money
INNOVATIVE IDEAS FROM
THE
usepropane.com
The average American 
family can save 10-20% 
of its daily water use
with a tankless unit. With 
tankless units homeowners 
save energy, lower 
greenhouse gas emissions 
and reduce their carbon 
footprint. In fact, propane 
tankless water heaters 
release 63% less carbon emissions than electric water 
heaters. Propane tankless water heaters are Energy Star 
qualiﬁed (electric water heaters do not qualify) and its just 
another reason that the coolest new thing for your home is 
actually hot! 
Save Space & Time
Save Energy
How Propane Tankless Water 
Heaters Work
Easily installed, propane tankless water heaters efﬁciently 
heat on demand and do not store heated water for later use. 
When there is a demand for hot water, the tankless model 
senses the demand and starts the heating process. The 
water ﬂows through a heat exchanger and is heated to the 
designated temperature by the burner. A heat exchanger 
is a device that transfers heat from one source to another 
and in this case, it transfers heat generated by a propane 
burner to the water that is being called for at your faucet, 
shower or washing machine. The propane burner is 
activated by a demand for hot water anywhere in the home. 
So when you turn on your hot water tap, the incoming 
water circulates through the heat exchanger, which heats 
the cold water to your desired temperature as it passes 
through the exchanger. 
Equal throughout, 
93% less space.

e need to prote the nation’s infraﬆruure has always bred fresh thinking. In 
March 1916, as the Unites States mulled its entry into World War I, POPULAR 
MECHANICS reported on a New York inventor who proposed arming train cars with heavy 
artillery. ese mobile gun platforms would be similar to ones used by Germany and 
would be deployed to guard America’s coaﬆs and, PM wrote, defend “our inland cities, 
railway centers and induﬆrial points.” (e idea was never adopted.) Modern technology 
brings both new threats and the plans to thwart them: Today’s security pros are trying 
to prote the U.S. from cyber attacks that exploit our infraﬆruure’s deep reliance on 
information technology (see “Weapon of Mass Disruption,” page 76.)  — ALLIE HAAKE
 
No airliner that suﬀers total engine failure aer hitting a ﬂock of geese can 
be called “lucky.” e odds of ﬆriking birds large enough to deﬆroy two 
airplane engines are extremely remote. Yet, when birds knocked out both engines 
of US Airways Flight 1549 aer it took oﬀ from LaGuardia Airport on Jan. 15, a 
series of fortunate events followed that enabled the Airbus A-320 to ditch into 
the Hudson River with no loss of life. Many called it a miracle; PM believes it was 
a combination of good vehicle design, smart piloting and, yes, juﬆ plain luck.

Air emergencies 
are more 
survivable at 
higher altitudes. 
 Flight recorders 
show that the 
airplane reached a 
maximum altitude 
of 3200 . If the 
bird ﬆrike had 
happened lower, 
juﬆ aer takeoﬀ, 
the plane probably 
would have 
plunged into the 
rough and frigid 
waters of Long 
Island Sound at a 
very high speed,  
in a spot where 
rescue would have 
taken longer.

Airplanes are 
made to survive 
total engine loss.
 How can 
computer- 
controlled planes 
ﬆeer without 
power? Auxiliary 
power units and 
ram-air turbines 
that drop from the 
fuselage can power 
the hydraulics that 
control an airplane. 
Damaged engines 
can provide a 
trickle of power 
from the windmill-
ing of their blades 
as they move 
through the air.

Rivers can make 
decent runways.
 Capt. Chesley 
Sullenberger 
determined that  
he did not have 
enough control to 
return to LaGuar-
dia. Without the 
engines working  
in reverse to slow 
the plane, he might 
have overshot the 
runway. If you have 
to put a jet down, 
the Hudson River  
is a close-to-ideal 
venue. It’s wide, 
the water is 
relatively calm and 
rescuers are close 
at hand.

Ditched airplanes 
don't sink faﬆ.
 Airplane 
fuselages are 
designed to keep 
air in, and that 
design helps keep 
water out. Aviation 
designers also 
include syﬆems 
that can delay 
sinking. Airbus 
A-320 cockpits are 
equipped with a 
button that seals 
the lower openings 
on the plane's 
fuselage, like the 
avionic ventilation 
ports and inlet for 
the ram-air turbine.

Training for  
the unlikely can 
save the day.
 Ditching into 
water is a rare 
event, but 
commercial airline 
crews prepare for 
it. Likewise, NY 
Waterway ferry 
crews train to 
assiﬆ and treat 
diﬆressed boaters 
or swimmers. ey 
quickly retrieved 
142 of the Airbus’s 
155 passengers 
and crew from the 
icy water.
e safe landing of US Airways Flight 1549, shown here as the plane is hoiﬆed from
the frigid Hudson River, was aided by luck, training and engineering.

MIRACLE PROJECTOR
A scientiﬆ turns a door’s visit into 
a machine to help the visually 
impaired see. BY AMBER ANGELLE
+  During a trip to 
the optometriﬆ 20 
years ago, Elizabeth 
Goldring became 
inspired to create a 
seeing machine for 
the visually 
impaired. at’s 
when Goldring, who 
is legally blind in 
one eye and 
partially blind in the 
other, ﬁrﬆ 
encountered a 
Scanning Laser 
Ophthalmoscope. 
e SLO is a tool 
that uses an 
infrared laser to 
shine an image onto 
the retina, 
bypassing 
hemorrhages and 
other defes within 
the eye. e patient 
reports when he is 
able to see the 
image, allowing the 
examiner to identify 
areas of healthy and 
unhealthy retinal 
cells. During the 
teﬆ, her damaged 
eyes could clearly 
read words. “I had 
to have one of 
those machines,” 
says Goldring, now 
a senior fellow at 
MIT’s Center for 
Advanced Visual 
Studies. However, 
the cumbersome, 
$100,000 SLO 
wasn’t praical 
outside doors’ 
oﬃces. She has 
collaborated with 
Robert Webb, 
inventor of the SLO 
and a physiciﬆ at 
Harvard Univer-
sity’s Schepens Eye 
Research Inﬆitute, 
to create a mobile 
version called the 
Retinal Imaging 
Machine Vision 
Syﬆem. e new

Hydropower researchers at the
University of Michigan are 
borrowing ﬆrategies from ﬁsh to 
maximize the energy that can be 
harveﬆed from slow-moving water. 
For example, trout use spinning 
eddies that form on both sides of a 
ﬆationary obje, like a rock, to help 
conserve energy as they swim 
upﬆream. e vortexes that form 
alternate from one side of the rock to 
the other, so ﬁsh swimming 
upﬆream slalom between these 
whirlpools. Schools also use vortexes 
created by the ﬁsh ahead to conserve 
energy when swimming upﬆream. 
e University of Michigan team’s 
design harnesses these alternating 
vortexes: Aluminum cylinders joined 
to built-in eleromagnets form a 
ladder-shaped device. As ﬂowing 
currents swirl paﬆ a cylinder, the 
vortexes that form above and below 
push and pull the cylinders to 
generate elericity. Inventor Michael 
Bernitsas eﬆimates the bobbing 
image onto the 
retina. “It’s like a 
video projeor,” 
Webb says. eir 
lateﬆ prototype is 
a nondescript, 
5-in.-wide box with 
a digital camera 
attached. By 
manipulating the 
camera’s zoom, 
Goldring is able to 
recognize faces 
and diﬆinguish 
objes. She plans 
to begin teﬆing the 
portable Seeing 
Machine Camera  
at the Joslin 
Diabetes Center 
Eye Inﬆitute in 
Boﬆon. “With this 
device I can see 
when my daughter 
is smiling,” 
Goldring says.

Landing on the deck of an aircra carrier takes quick reﬂexes, 
sharp mental focus and cool daring. But does it require a pilot? is 
fall Northrop Grumman will ﬆart ﬂight teﬆing the ﬁrﬆ unmanned 
ﬆrike airplane created to operate from a carrier. e ﬆealth 
X-47B’s 62- bat wings fold in to reduce overall span to 31  for 
ﬆorage. And that’s no cockpit: e air intake is, almoﬆ mockingly, 
in the same place as a window in a manned aircra. e X-47B’s 
sea trials on a carrier are planned to begin in late 2011. 

aion can yield 51 watts per cubic
meter at water speeds of 3 knots, 
depending on the number and size 
of the cylinders. e device, known 
as Vortex-Induced Vibrations for 
Aquatic Clean Energy, or VIVACE, 
attraed Navy intereﬆ for its 
potential to generate power at 
ﬂow speeds slower than the 5-knot 
minimum of moﬆ turbines. To 
maximize the syﬆem’s eﬃciency, 
Bernitsas draws insight from the 
anatomy of ﬁsh. Sandpaper-like 
surface roughness on the cylinders 
mimics scales to form more 
energetic whirlpools. Flexible 
plates designed like a ﬁsh’s tail 
could speed up cylinders in very 
slow-moving water or decrease the 
cylinder movement, which would 
help to prote aquatic life. “We 
may design a tail that’s adjuﬆable 
and has sensors, but I’m not 
anywhere near that yet,” Bernitsas 
said. “Simply, we are not as smart 
as ﬁsh at this point.”

tionary X-47B

e space shuttle is due for 
retirement in 2010, and NASA’s next 
spaceship, Orion, won’t be available until at 
leaﬆ 2015. at will leave a ﬁve-year gap 
during which NASA aﬆronauts and 
space-ﬆation cargo will be grounded unless 
they ﬁnd other ways to get to orbit. In the 
paﬆ, NASA has cadged rides oﬀ its former 
arch-rival, the Russian Federal Space 
Agency, and its Soyuz (for aﬆronauts) and 
Progress (for cargo) spacecra. But 
relations between the U.S. and Russia are 
cooling, raising the very real prospe that 
Congress will forbid NASA to buy space-
ﬂights from Russia. NASA has ﬆepped up 
its support of two U.S. companies, Space 
Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) and 
Orbital Sciences Corporation, that hope to 
have unmanned cargo spaceships ready for 
launch by 2010. (See details below.) Even if 
these companies succeed, NASA will ﬆill 
have to rely on Soyuz for manned ﬂights. 
But maybe not for long. Here’s a roundup of 
seven rides to low Earth orbit besides the 
space shuttle and Soyuz that could be 
available for space-ﬆation ﬂights.

Looking Beyond Viﬆa
To be honeﬆ, I never really developed the visceral hatred for Micro-
so’s Viﬆa operating syﬆem that many users seem to feel, but the
sentiment is underﬆandable. Viﬆa is bloated and slow—and it took a
back-seat-driver approach to security that could really get under your
skin. (“Are you sure you want to launch this program?” “Are you really
sure?!”) So less than two years aer Viﬆa’s launch, Microso is pre-
paring to launch Windows 7 sometime in the next year or two. In
January, the beta of the new OS was released for all the world to try.
My initial impressions are promising. It is faster at the important
ﬆuﬀ—in my teﬆs, Win 7 booted in around 45 seconds (Viﬆa typically
takes well over a minute)—
and navigation is far more
intelligent. But hey, it’s a beta,
so there’s ﬆill much that could
go wrong. And many more
improvements are surely in
the works. — GLENN DERENE

($60) Casual day-anglers 
can ditch the traditional 
veﬆ—compa packs are 
less bulky and make caﬆing 
easier. is pack has plenty 
of places to ﬆash lures and 
tools, and was comfortable 
through days of wading. 
Super Fly Gear
ere’s something Zen-like about ﬂy ﬁshing. It’s juﬆ you, the river and whatever you 
carry with you. But novice anglers o
en make the miﬆake of overdoing the laﬆ part, loading 
up on unnecessary and expensive equipment. We teﬆed the lateﬆ gear to ﬁnd the beﬆ get-
up for the trout ﬁsherman who doesn’t want to spend a small fortune. BY BRIAN MCCLINTOCK

Telescope Torque
Nuts and hexhead faﬆeners aren’t always located in easy-to-reach places
(laundry appliances, in particular, are notorious for their poorly placed faﬆeners).
e Klenk 1⁄4-In. Adjuﬆable-Length Magnetic Nut Driver ($11) has a
telescopic sha (the tool’s total length can be set between 7.5 and 10.5 in.),
allowing users to reach moﬆ out-of-the-way nuts and faﬆeners with a single tool.
e recession has been kind to pocket 
camcorders —the gadgets’ low prices have made 
them  commercial successes in an otherwise 
bleak business year. But technology moves faﬆ, and 
these once no-frills cameras are now oﬀering 
advanced features. Take the Kodak Zx1 ($150) : 
It shoots in 720p high deﬁnition and is weather- 
resiﬆant, built to withﬆand rain and dirt. It won’t win 
any Oscars (as with any pocket camcorder, it’s 
vulnerable to shaky hands), but for beach bums 
and snow-sporters, it’s a no-brainer.
Pocket Presenter
While microprojeors have been trickling onto the market  
over the paﬆ year, their portability (and usefulness) has been 
limited—they need to be tethered to other devices to  
produce an image. e Samsung MBP-200 Pico Projeor 
doubles as a portable media player, meaning it can be used to 
display videos or PowerPoints up to 50 in. diagonal on  
its own. In other words, it’s everything you need to give a 
presentation, and it ﬁts in a pocket. Samsung is mum on a 
release date and price, but look for it later this year.

Choice
e paﬆ few years have seen a number  
of attempted iPhone killers. But without 
exception, they’ve all been hampered  
by unresponsive touchscreens, bulky 
designs or nonintuitive interfaces. So 
what makes the Palm Pre (price not 
set) diﬀerent? It takes everything the 
iPhone does well—its interface is smooth 
and intuitive, and it’s the only non-iPhone 
phone to feature a multitouch-capable  
touchscreen—and builds on it. Unlike  
the iPhone, the Pre has a slide-out 
keyboard (which, remarkably, doesn’t add 
a signiﬁcant amount of bulk), it can 
multitask, and it’s the ﬁrﬆ phone with an 
induive charging coil built in, allowing 
users to wirelessly charge the phone by 
juﬆ laying it on a charging-pad accessory.
Pre Approved

Conneed Camera
All Wi-Fi cameras allow users to 
upload ﬁles wirelessly, but the 
10.1-megapixel, 4x-optical-zooming  
Sony Cyber-shot DSC-G3 ($500) is 
the ﬁrﬆ that also has a built-in Web 
browser, allowing on-camera 
access to photo-sharing sites such 
as Picasa. In praice, uploading 
images was easy, but it took several 
minutes for larger photos—and 
there’s no way to automatically 
shrink multi-megapixel photos to a 
Web-friendly size. 
While eleric mowers are cleaner, quieter and easier to maintain than 
their gas brethren, they rarely provide enough power to mow anything 
but a small lawn. e Huﬆler Zeon ($6500) is the ﬁrﬆ eleric 
zero-turn riding mower, and it’s able to cut a bit over an acre on a single 
charge. Of course, many riding mower users deal with multiacre lawns, 
but this is a good ﬆart, and we wouldn’t be surprised to see future 
models with longer-laﬆing batteries.

One could argue that the Kia lineup—at leaﬆ in the paﬆ—has been more like back-
ground scenery than iconography. at will likely change with the Soul, a hip new box
poised to challenge Scion’s xB. e Sport is powered by a 142-hp 2.0-liter inline Four
paired to either a ﬁve-speed manual (our $17,645 teﬆer) or four-speed automatic. e
motor is blessed with a broad torque spread that makes high engine speed largely
unnecessary. You can cruise at 80-plus all day without undue fuel consumption—we
averaged juﬆ north of 30 mpg. e Sport receives a real sport-tuned suspension and fat
18-in. wheels, so it can be huﬆled along at a surprising rate. ere’s an honeﬆ mechanical
sense to the Soul, despite its somewhat inert ﬆeering and a slightly vague manual shier.
Yet, it all comes together in a car that is fun to drive—and to look at. — BARRY WINFIELD

Under the Radar
Hybrid powertrains may grab head-
lines, but sometimes eﬃciency doesn’t 
require the added expense. For 2009, 
the Highlander is available with a new 
187-hp 2.7-liter four-cylinder under the 
hood paired to a six-speed automatic. 
(e vehicle is only available in 
front-wheel-drive and base-trim levels.) 
It’s rated at 20 mpg city and 27 mpg 
highway. Aer 400 miles we can report 
that this $26,450 model doesn’t 
relegate you to gas-hog ﬆatus—or the 
slow lane. We averaged a solid 25 mpg 
during a combination of highway and 
city driving. at’s within ﬆriking 
diﬆance of the $35,445, 27-mpg-city-, 
25-mpg-highway-rated Hybrid. e 
powertrain oﬀers reasonable pep, and 
the shis are quick and nearly 
imperceptible—this is a smooth 
gearbox. Cruising along at 60 mph, we 
noticed the tach regiﬆered barely 
more than 1750 rpm.  — B.W. 
Home-Team Hybrid
ree years ago, when Ford began work 
on its $27,995 Fusion Hybrid, few 
envisioned the ensuing fuel-price roller 
coaﬆer. Luckily, Ford homed in on 
maximizing eﬃciency: e new Ford 
boaﬆs an impressive rating of 41 mpg 
city and 36 mpg highway. e 191-hp 
hybrid powertrain can deliver over 700 
miles on a tank, too. Use a gentle right 
foot and it really is possible to cruise 
close to the claimed 47-mph mark, 
gliding silently under eleric power. It’s 
a rather peaceful way to slice through 
traﬃc—until the gas engine kicks in. But 
drive more realiﬆically and spool the 
engine all the way to redline every so 
oen; economy will dip into the mid 
30s. As always, the beﬆ way to achieve 
maximum fuel economy is with a 
delicate throttle.  — BASEM WASEF 
Behind the wheel 
of the Fusion 
Hybrid, it’s all 
about watching 
that SmartGauge 
screen. We used 
“Empower” mode, 
which oﬀers info to 
assiﬆ in economi-
cal driving.
 
e 156-hp 
Atkinson-cycle 
Four requires less 
fuel on reﬆarts, 
and the ﬆop/ﬆart 
cycle occurs 1.5 
times more oen 
than on the Escape 
Hybrid —increasing 
eﬃciency.

Spine Tingler
Aprilia may barely regiﬆer a blip on the 
colleive radar of American riders. But 
for those who know, these bikes are 
the two-wheeled equivalent of a 
Lamborghini. Aprilia’s moﬆ aggressive 
attempt yet at planting a ﬆake in the 
U.S. market is its $8999 Shiver, a 
416-pound 750 cc naked bike that 
puts Ducati’s iconic Monﬆer squarely 
in its crosshairs. e Shiver’s 95-hp 
V-twin provides plenty of thruﬆ for 
enthusiaﬆic riding, as well as a 
wonderfully raspy song. Power comes 
on ﬆrong and smooth from low rpm, 
and the lightweight feel makes it easy 
to li the front wheel under moderately 
heavy throttle. We attacked the 
canyons of Southern California’s 
Angeles Creﬆ Highway and found the 
Shiver’s hardware well-suited for 
aggressive riding. At low speeds or 
high, the Shiver feels agile and willing 
to change direion eﬀortlessly.  — B.W. 
Machismo Redeﬁned
Sixteen years is a lifetime in the 
motorcycle world, but that’s how long 
it took Ducati to redesign this icon. 
Hey, you can’t aﬀord to mess around 
with a megahit like the Monﬆer. e 
air-cooled, 80-hp 696 cc L-twin engine 
is an exercise in simplicity. And the 
bike’s compa proportions and 
30.3-in. seat height make it welcoming 
to less-experienced riders. row a leg 
over the $8995 Duc, and you lean 
forward. e position is more sporty 
than ﬆandard. e clutch feels light, as 
does the ﬆeering eﬀort. But aer a 
few hours in the saddle, the ride can 
get taxing. ough it’s entertaining, the 
Monﬆer 696 wouldn’t be our ﬁrﬆ 
choice for a long-diﬆance tour. Still, for 
brisk back-road fun, the Monﬆer 696 
is the right beaﬆ for the job.  — B.W. 
HOT CHOPPER
In a shocking move,
Honda has unveiled a 
produion chopper. At 
ﬁrﬆ glance the bike 
boaﬆs the usual 
chopper cues, but 
closer inspeion 
reveals modern 
touches like liquid 
cooling and sha drive. 
e fork is raked at a 
laid-back 38 degrees 
and the seat sits at  
a low 26.7 in. e  
200 mm rear tire is juﬆ 
fat enough. And the 
Fury’s tank looks like 
ﬆretched taﬀy, leaving 
plenty of space above 
the cylinder heads, 
which cap the 
fuel- injeed 1312 cc 
52-degree V-twin. 
Honda promises an 
intoxicating exhauﬆ 
note—for a chopper, 
that’s a muﬆ.  — B.W.

2010
Toyota Prius
e all-new, third-generation Prius was
the moﬆ anticipated reveal at Detroit. 
e new car hits the road this spring 
with a larger 1.8-liter engine and an 
improved hybrid-drive syﬆem. anks 
to careful aerodynamic tuning (a low  
.25 Cd) and reduced drivetrain weight, 
the new Prius is quicker than before (0 
to 60 mph in a claimed 9.8 seconds), 
yet, according to Toyota, it will hit 50 
mpg combined. Impressive. is new 
Prius has been designed from the 
beginning to be a plug-in hybrid. In place 
of the nickel-metal-hydride battery 
packs, Toyota will at some point within 
the next two years oﬀer a plug-in 
version and inﬆall lithium-ion battery 
packs (now being developed with 
partner Panasonic). Exa timing for the 
plug-in is unknown, but Toyota will put 
150 in ﬂeet use by year’s end.

Despite a shaky economy and a rougher-than-rough 2008 for auto makers, 
the 2009 North American International Auto Show revealed sharp designs 
and innovation. But perhaps the biggeﬆ news came a week aer the 
show itself, when Chrysler and Italian auto giant Fiat proposed an alliance. 
If ﬁnalized, Fiat will get a 35 percent share in Chrysler and access to Ameri-
can manufauring. Chrysler will receive Fiat’s hip, small cars. e move 
should give Chrysler the ﬆamina to survive. Let’s hope so.  — BEN STEWART

 2010 Buick LaCrosse
Is this the beﬆ Buick sedan in
decades? Could be. e specs and 
design look impressive. It’s the ﬁrﬆ 
Buick sedan to oﬀer all-wheel drive.  
And awd versions have real-time 
damping suspension and an 
eleronic limited-slip rear 
diﬀerential. e top 280-hp 3.6-liter 
V6 model hits 26 mpg highway and 
60 mph in 6.5 seconds.
 4
 Concept Chrysler 200C EV
Here’s an elegant, rear-drive sedan
concept that uses a range-extended 
plug-in power like the Chevy Volt’s. 
Chrysler says it can hit 60 mph in 7 
seconds, drive for 40 miles on 
eleric-only power and cruise for 
400 miles without refueling. e 
200C EV points to a future where 
we can enjoy large, roomy cars that 
sip fuel like much smaller ones.
 2
 2010 Ford Taurus
Ford’s new Taurus is the moﬆ
ﬆriking since the 1986 original. e 
platform and the 3.5-liter V6 are 
shared with the Lincoln MKS. Ford 
promises exemplary handling that 
will return the Taurus to its ﬆatus as 
a driver’s car. A hot-blooded SHO 
model is also coming this summer 
with all-wheel drive and 365 hp.
 1
 Concept Cadillac Converj
ink of this concept as the upscale
version of the Chevy Volt. It uses  
the same extended-range plug-in 
technology. e Converj shows that 
GM could use the Volt’s tech across 
several brands. And by expanding 
the volume of batteries and related 
syﬆems, they’ll lower coﬆ—bringing 
the technology to more people.
 5
 2010 Lincoln MKT
In simple terms, the MKT is
Lincoln’s version of the Ford Flex. 
e MKT will be oﬀered with two 
powertrains, a 3.7-liter 265-hp V6 
and a twin-turbo version that 
should make 355 hp. Lincoln claims 
the MKT is quieter than the already 
hushed Flex. Praical three-row 
seating could make the MKT a 
cornerﬆone of the Lincoln lineup.

ﬁnally ready for its closeup? The short
answer may be that technology has
caught up with the concept. Stereo-
scopic ﬁlms of the past were plagued
by problems. “People always liked
3D,” says David Cohen, an associate
editor at Variety. “It just didn’t work
very well.” The 3D format is now much
more reliable, thanks to the introduc-
tion of digital technology and prod-
ucts developed by companies such as
RealD, based  in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
which spent 18
months com-
bining stereo-
scopic science
with digital pro-
jection. “NASA,
the military
and Fortune 500 companies use 3D
to design automobiles and aircraft,
because you need to see the way we
see in real life—with depth,” says
Michael Lewis, who before founding
RealD created content for 3D IMAX
ﬁlms. “Our goal was to come up with
a simple technology that would allow
us to get that experience to the world.
ollywood is buzzing about 3D. Dreamworks
Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has com-
pared it to the introduction of color. Director
James Cameron delayed
the release of his stereo-
scopic epic Avatar in part to
give theaters more time to
convert to 3D capability. A
dozen or more stereoscopic
films will be released in
2009, and more than 30 movies are in production.
But stereoscopic ﬁlms are not a revolutionary con-
cept; in fact, audiences have been paying for them
sinceThe Power of Love in 1922. The golden age of
3D was in the 1950s, with a brief resurgence in the
1980s. Each time experts heralded the format as
the next big thing in ﬁlmmaking, and each time,
the surge quietly subsided.
So what has convinced Hollywood that 3D is

Cinema, being at the top of the visual-
food-chain experience, is where we felt
we had to start.”
e 3D Headache
Humans naturally see in stereo
because our eyes, set about 2 in.
apart, each see a slightly different
view; our brains combine that data
into one image, which allows us to
perceive depth. The 3D format tries
to replicate this effect by shooting
with two cameras, one representing
each eye. But it’s not as simple as
setting the cameras eye-width apart
and yelling “action.” The distance
between the two cameras, or inter-
axial distance, determines the per-
ceived depth of a scene, known as
volume. “The wider you separate the
cameras, the more 3D volume there
is,” says Phil McNally, global stereo
effects supervisor at Dreamworks
Animation. Shooting for a big screen
and scaling down reduces 3D volume;
shooting small and scaling up creates
too much 3D, which is headache-
inducing for viewers.
Filmmakers also need to calculate
the zero parallax setting, or ZPS—the
point where the two digital images
converge onscreen. ZPS determines
what appears to occur in front of the
plane of the screen and what seems
to happen behind the screen.
When 3D movies were shot on
film, the potential for botched set-
tings was huge because cameras had
to be aligned by hand. But that was
just the beginning of the problems
with film. The cameras also had
to capture a scene in perfect time
with each other—which is impossible
because even the movement of ﬁlm
through a camera causes distortion.
In addition, the two rolls of ﬁlm had
to be matched precisely for color.
Projection in theaters was also
problematic, since it was impossible
to perfectly align the two projectors—
again, one for each eye. Plus, film
usually needs to be repaired during
its life cycle, which created discrepan-
cies between the two reels, resulting
in ﬁlms that were painful to watch.
As for the audience’s role, film-
makers in the 1920s (and as recently
as the 1980s) used overlapping red
and cyan images—known as an
anaglyph—to create stereoscopic
movies. Audiences wore glasses with
red and cyan lenses, which ensured
that each eye saw only one of the two
overlapping prints and allowed the
brain to create a 3D image. Anaglyphs
were originally designed for black
and white, so using them on color
ﬁlm led to poor color representation.

During 3D’s golden age, in the 1950s,
stereoscopic movies relied on linear
polarization and polarized glasses,
which funneled images to the proper
eye by restricting light. Polarization
created better colors, but if viewers
moved their heads, they disrupted
the stereoscopic image.
Digital Relief
Current 3D films, however, are sub-
tle, immersive and easier to produce,
thanks to digital technology. While
some analog-era challenges still
3D Animation 
A ﬆereoscopic movie consiﬆs of two slightly diﬀerent views of the same 
aion—one for each eye—which creates the illusion of depth. An audience wearing 
special glasses is able to see the heroine below jump into “personal space” (aion 
that appears to occur in front of the screen), while the pursuing robot remains in 
“world space” (aion that seems to take place behind the screen). Moﬆ ﬆudios 
plan to release upcoming animated ﬁlms in 3D; here’s how it’s done. 
Animation
Animators capture 
the aion with ﬆereo 
camera rigs they create 
in a computer. To ensure 
that no elements in a 
scene appear ﬂat, ﬁlm-
makers shoot with as 
many as three dual rigs. 
Commercial soware 
and proprietary tools 
allow animators to 
precisely control what 
appears in personal 
space and world space, 
and where the diﬀerent 
camera views coincide.
Projeion
A single digital projec-
tor, outﬁtted with a 
photo-optical device, 
superimposes the two 
ﬁlms—each with a dif-
ferent polarization—on 
a special silver movie 
screen that is capable 
of showing both 3D and 
2D ﬁlms. e projec-
tor triple-ﬂashes each 
frame for each eye for a 
total of 144 frames per 
second—double the rate 
of regular cinema.
e View
Audience members wear 
glasses with circular 
polarization, which allows 
only one image into each 
eye by reﬆriing light; 
the brain combines those 
images into 3D. e 
glasses also maintain 
ﬆereoscopic fusion.

high-definition for the
home is far away at all,”
the company’s North
American CEO and chair-
man Yoshi Yamada told
reporters. In fact, a home-
electronics group called
the 3D@Home consor-
tium estimates that 1.9
million 3D-ready TVs were
sold in 2008. Panasonic
is pushing an industry-
wide standard for stereo-
scopic hi-def and has
built a 3D Blu-ray disc-
authoring center that
aims to put stereoscopic
DVDs in stores by 2010.
The potential goes beyond DVDs:
The NFL and NBA have beamed ste-
reoscopic broadcasts of games into
movie theaters. “It’s not often that I
get this excited about something,” says
Glenn Adamo, vice president of NFL
Media Operations, who supervised the
3D broadcast of an Oakland Raiders–
San Diego Chargers game in Decem-
ber. “I hope we get to do it again.”
When it comes to movies, one
thing seems certain: The chances
of 3D sticking around are better this
time. “It’s not a huge bubble like in
the 1950s, when everyone scrambled
to produce 3D movies and didn’t
know what they were doing,” Hober-
man says. “The format works pretty
well; there has been investment in
various systems, and studios are
making money on it. It’s not going
away this time.”
FC
apply, filmmakers now use comput-
ers to determine interaxial distance
and ZPS and to align cameras. Digital
capture eliminates issues with incon-
sistent ﬁlm stock, and if a ﬁlmmaker
still bungles the job, new software can
be used to digitally correct errors in
postproduction.
Whereas two ﬁlm projectors were
once required to show 3D, theaters
can now use a single digital projector
outﬁtted with a photo-optical device;
theaters are in the process of replac-
ing analog projectors with digital
ones. (According to the Motion Pic-
ture Association of America, 4632 of
the more than 40,000 movie screens
in the United States had digital tech-
nology in 2007.) The ﬁlm industry will
save $1.5 billion a year in print costs
when it can send masters via satellite
or ﬁberoptics, so it is partially under-
writing the conversion: A digital pro-
jector and server cost a hefty $70,000.
The ability to show 3D movies,
says Perry Hoberman, an associate
professor at the University of South-
ern California’s ﬁlm school, is a huge
incentive for theaters. Not only does
the experience give people a reason
to leave their homes and HDTVs, but
theaters can also charge more for
tickets. (Katzenberg has proposed
adding an extra $5 to tickets for 3D
films.) “For exhibitors,” Hoberman
says, “it’s the ﬁrst thing to come along
that’s a carrot instead of a stick to get
them to convert to digital.”
Even polarized glasses have been
upgraded. Today, filmmakers use
circular polarization, which retains
3D fusion while allowing audience
members to move their heads. “After
10 minutes, 3D used to be a bad
experience,” Lewis says. “With new
technology, it’s a really good one.”
Box ofﬁce from the ﬁrst ﬁlms in
this latest stereoscopic era shows
that audiences are hungry for 3D.
Disney/Pixar’s Bolt, still in theaters at
press time, earned approximately 41
percent of its $111 million domestic
box ofﬁce from 3D, which accounted
for 27 percent of the ﬁlm’s screens.
Journey to the Center of the Earth
earned approximately 60 percent of
its $102 million gross from 3D, which
accounted for 30 percent of screens.
The home-electronics industry
also wants to tap into 3D’s popularity.
At this year’s Consumer Electronics
Show, Samsung, Sony and Panasonic
touted the format’s home potential.
“Panasonic does not think that 3D

On this chilly and slightly overcast 
November morning, faculty adviser 
Ignacio Garcia, a retired engineering 
school machinist, and a dozen bleary-
eyed team members trailered the car 
to Chrysler’s Chelsea, Mich., proving 
grounds. Most team members have 
never driven Continuum, hence their 
nervous looks: I’m the first outsider 
ever to take a spin in a streamliner that 
cost them an awful lot of late nights 
and bloody knuckles. “We have a say-
ing,” says head strategist Alex Dowl-
ing, a 20-year-old junior from Saline, 
Mich. “You can have a social life, get 
good grades or do solar car. Pick two.” 
A hardcore group of about 30 spends 
more than 30 hours per week on the 
project—designing, testing, fabricat-
ing and securing sponsorships for the 
$2.4 million two-year budget. 
I’m about 6 ft tall and weigh 180 
pounds, which is 3 in. and 20 pounds 
too much for the cockpit. After an 
unsuccessful attempt with shoes on, 
I go socks-only and clear the small 
carbon-ﬁber steering wheel. My knees 
are practically kissing my chin. Luck-
ily, the controls are on the steering 
wheel: A lever on the right works the 
“throttle,” and one on the left acti-
vates the brakes. The team designed a 
dash that displays speed, charge state 
and distance traveled. They also built 
a rearview video-camera system and 
a wireless network that links the car 
to chase vehicles. The team remotely 
monitors Continuum with a Prius-
like energy-ﬂow graphic. 
Once I’m buckled in, six students 
afﬁx the upper part of the car’s body 
in a series of moves so effortlessly 
choreographed it would make a 
Sprint Cup team jealous. The top half 
carries the solar array; the bottom 
half is the carbon-ﬁber and Nomex-
honeycomb main structure. 
As I gingerly pull back on the 
accelerator, the car inches forward 
at a turtle’s pace. It’s so pokey that a 
few team members walk alongside as 
I get underway. Weighing a lithe 480

pounds, Continuum gets all the pro-
pulsion it needs from a 16-hp elec-
tric motor that resides in the single 
front wheel. The trike design lowers 
the car’s surface area, which in turn 
reduces drag. How slippery is it? “It’s 
a strategic advantage for other teams 
not to know,” a cagey Dowling says. 
He reveals that the team believes a 
Corvette has ﬁve times as much drag 
as Continuum. But as I am about to 
learn, when it comes to handling, this 
is no Corvette. 
With a single front wheel, I fear that 
any turn at speed will tip the car onto 
its outside edge, like a tricycle turned 
too hard by a reckless 3-year-old.  
“We talked to a vehicle dynamics pro-
fessor when we designed the car,” 
says John Federspiel, a 21-year-old 
junior from Rochester, Mich. “He had 
no idea about three-wheel dynamics. 
There’s not much on the subject, so 
we had to figure it out ourselves.” I 
creep up to about 30 mph and gently 
turn. The car responds more predict-
ably and confidently than I could 
have imagined. I progressively wind 
in more steering angle until I feel the 
front end safely wash out in classic 
understeer. It’s not fun, but it’s stable 
and there is little body roll—these 
kids have done their homework. 

C A R  C U L T U R E / / / 
S O L A R  R A C E R
While crisscrossing a vast expanse
of proving-ground asphalt known as
Black Lake, I buzz by the students
at 40 mph. In 10 minutes, my hind-
quarters have gone numb, but I’m
in the groove and ready to head over
to Chrysler’s 4.7-mile banked oval
so that I can open this baby up. I
pull onto a pockmarked two-lane
road and brace for the first impact.
There’s a loud thud, but the car isn’t
bothered by bumps. It feels solid and
well-built. Because of the tight con-
ﬁnes and lack of air, beads of sweat
roll down my face despite the brisk
weather. It’s windy too, and I’m a
little nervous about how crosswinds
might affect a car shaped like a huge
Delta wing. So when I get to the oval I
stop and ask for a more experienced
driver to try it ﬁrst.
The team descends on the car.
Jeff Rogers, a 22-year-old graduate
student from Rochester Hills, Mich.,
shouts, “Waist!” and all six lift the top
half about 1 ft. Someone unhooks
two safety chains and disconnects the
wires that connect the solar array to an
electrical device called the maximum-
power point-tracking system. The
MPPT constantly changes the load
on the solar array to extract maximum
power. “Up!” Rogers barks. In another
precisely timed maneuver, the team
carries the top half away from the car
and sets it down on sawhorses.
They’re careful with the array since
any scratch could reduce the efﬁciency
of the 2726 solar cells. (Racing rules
limit the area of the array to 6 square
meters—about 7 square yards.) Each
$50 cell produces a maximum of 2.6
volts. In full sunlight, the array pro-
vides 2.4 hp, which is roughly what it
takes to hold the car at 60 mph on a
ﬂat road—less than an eighth of the
power a normal car requires.
I wiggle out, and Federspiel takes
the helm. He moves out with two
chase cars in tow. Dowling sits in the
lead chase vehicle, staring at a laptop
screen. “We monitor everything,” he
says. Obsessive Formula One engi-
neers have nothing on these guys.

adviser Ignacio Garcia. “So, these kids
really built this thing?” I ask.
“Yes. I only step in if there’s asafety
issue or if they ask,” Garcia says. “The
adults are there for support. It’s amaz-
ing what the students have done.”
In addition to engineering know-
how, these students run the program
like a Fortune 500 tech company. It’s
split into four divisions, and team
members have weekly progress
meetings, workflow charts, a Web-
based forum to catalog every move,
even custom stationery. They solicit
design advice from solar-car alumni
and invite companies to teach them
carbon-ﬁber construction.
Several students who have taken
their first spin are giddy from the
experience. Someone suggests that
6-ft 3-in., 210-pound Chris Hammond,
a 21-year-old junior from Clarkston,
Mich., give it a go. He makes it half-
way into the cockpit before he gets
stuck and yells for help. It’s the out-
come everyone knew was coming.
But they laugh and chide him in
a way only a fraternity full of broth-
ers could. They are, after all, still col-
lege students.

Federspiel drives a lap and gives
the okay. I’m strapped back in. I ﬂoor
it, the car rocks back slightly on its
haunches, and we’re off. The motor
makes a loud growl until I clear
10 mph, and then all I hear are little
pebbles zapping the bodywork. As
speed slowly increases—51 mph,
52, 53—the car feels ever so slightly
more eager.
The oval, with its perfectly smooth
surface, is the same place Chrysler
runs Chargers and Challengers flat
out at supercar speeds, so at 60 mph,
Continuum is, well, a bit underwhelm-
ing. It’s hard to maintain that speed
because the stiff winds dramatically
slow the car whenever I let out the
accelerator. Too bad I didn’t learn to
activate the car’s cruise control. The
real thrill here is, of course, knowing
this car runs as long as the sun shines
and the battery has juice—never
stopping for a drop of petroleum or a
charge from the power grid.
My legs are numb—again—so
I prepare to stop. After I climb out,
Dowling asks if other team members
would like a turn. I can sense their

Effect, after economist Sam Peltz-
man, who ﬁrst wrote about it in 1976. 
The decades-long effort to make 
highways straighter, wider and 
better- marked, with more guardrails 
and rumble strips, has eliminated 
one class of dangers only to foster 
 another: the complacent driver with 
a cellphone in one hand and a cup of 
coffee in the other, steering the vehi-
cle with a knee while occasionally 
glancing at what’s ahead.
Meanwhile, modifying roads and 
intersections so drivers are less com-
fortable—by making driv-
ing, in some ways, more 
dangerous—forces people 
to slow down and pay 
attention, producing a 
change in behavior that, 
paradoxically, results in 
more safety. This is also 
true for pedestrians, who 
Vanderbilt says are more 
cautious away from cross-
walks than within them 
because they don’t know 
if cars will actually stop.  
Likewise, trafﬁc circles 
and 
squares, 
which 
demand a driver’s full 
attention, turn out to be 
both safer and better at 
handling large volumes of 
traffic than traditional 
four-way intersections 
with traffic lights. In the 
former, people focus on 
what’s going on; in the lat-
ter, they relax and expect 
eading Tom Vanderbilt’s latest book, Trafﬁc: 
Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says 
About Us), I was struck by a recurring theme: 
Making things safer may actually make them 
more dangerous. I wonder if it’s a lesson that 
also applies off the road.
Vanderbilt describes driving along a nar-
row, twisting road in Spain, where he navigated 
hairpin turns with few guardrails or warning 
signs over steep drop-offs. The result: “I drove 
as if my life depended on it.” But when he 
reached a four-lane highway with gentle curves, 
good visibility and little trafﬁc, “I just about fell 
asleep and ran off the road ... Lulled by safety, 
I’d acted more dangerously.”
There is a fair amount of scientiﬁc evidence 
that backs up Vanderbilt’s insights. Give peo-
ple antilock brakes, airbags and other safety 
devices, and they “consume” the safety 
improvements by driving more aggressively. 
This phenomenon is called the Peltzman 
SAFETY THROUGH DANGER?

TRAFFIC CIRCLES, WHICH DEMAND A DRIVER’S FULL
ATTENTION, TURN OUT TO BE SAFER THAN FOUR-
WAY INTERSECTIONS WITH TRAFFIC LIGHTS.
the trafﬁc signals to do all the work.
Drivers in trafﬁc circles also commu-
nicate more with hand signals and
eye contact. As Vanderbilt notes,
when a traditional four-way intersec-
tion with lights was turned into a
trafﬁc square, “The responsibility for
getting through the intersection was
now up to the users, and they
responded
by
communicating
among themselves. The result was
that the system was safer, even
though the majority of users, polled
in local surveys, felt that the system
was more dangerous!”
Vanderbilt also says that change
causes people to pay more attention,
and hence drive more safely. In 1967,
when Sweden switched from driving
on the left to driving on the right,
many people predicted that acci-
dents would increase. But accident
rates dropped noticeably, and took a
year to return to the pre-changeover
level. The change, and the fear of
accidents it produced, caused people
to drive more carefully. The lesson
here is that familiarity breeds slack-
ness, and regular challenges encour-
age mindfulness and attention.
Instead of designing roads and
devices to accommodate people who
are dozing through life, we might
produce better performance by
designing things with an eye toward
engaging attention.
Famed Dutch traffic engineer
Hans Monderman once said: “When
you treat people like idiots, they’ll
behave like that.” Monderman’s phi-
losophy is, instead, to design things
so that people are called on to use
their wits—at least within limits.
When that happens, things often
wind up safer.
I’m not ready to plow up all the
interstates and replace them with
cow paths, but this approach does
ring true. In our modern world, lots
of things compete for our attention,
and where we can take things for
granted, we’re likely to do so, even if
it’s not really a good idea.
The
safety-through-danger
approach extends to cars. Modern
cars are quiet, powerful and capable
of astonishing grip in curves, even
on wet pavement. That’s swell, of
course, until you suddenly lose trac-
tion at 75 mph. The sense of conﬁ-
dence bred by all this capability
makes us feel safe, which causes us
to drive faster than we probably
should. We don’t want to make cars
with poor response, but perhaps we
could design cues—steering-wheel
vibration devices, as in video
games?—that make us feel less safe
at speed and encourage more care.
Designers could make cars feel faster
at lower speeds, instead of slower at
higher speeds. Done right, this
might even make driving more fun.
In college I drove an Austin-Healey
3000 that somehow felt faster at 45
mph than my Mazda RX-8 (or even
my Toyota Highlander Hybrid) feels
at 75 mph. That was a good thing.
This approach could be taken
beyond the world of personal trans-
portation. We’re in the current ﬁnan-
cial mess in part because things that
were actually dangerous—from
subprime mortgages to risky ﬁnan-
cial instruments that no one fully
understood—felt safe and ordinary.
Modern financial markets, with
computers, regulations, deposit
insurance and bond ratings, felt as
routine and as smooth as that four-
lane highway in Spain, causing a lot
of people who should have been pay-
ing attention to doze off. Investors
might have been more careful if it
had felt like they were driving down
a twisty mountain road with no
guardrails, especially since we really
were engaged in the ﬁnancial equiva-
lent of high-speed mountain driving,
only without the discipline of fear.
In athletics, protection some-
times leads to more risk-taking.
Research has shown that skiers who
wear helmets ski faster than those
who do not. Likewise, firearms
instructors are quick to stress that
the safety on a gun doesn’t actually
render the weapon safe, just margin-
ally safer, so that all usual precau-
tions still apply. And I noticed when
scuba diving with a spare air cylinder
that instructors were concerned
these backups would become popu-
lar with inexperienced divers and
that this reliance might breed care-
lessness with the main equipment.
The trafﬁc example demonstrates
a general phenomenon of modern
society: With the best of intentions,
we tend to replace situations that
call on the use of our wits with situa-
tions that we can sleepwalk through,
and the solutions to matters with any
serious consequences are postponed
to the indefinite future. That’s a
comfortable way to live, and there
are good reasons to be glad of it—
we’re not in a situation where one
bad harvest means starvation, after
all—but if you can postpone prob-
lems indeﬁnitely, a lot of problems
will be postponed. Yet the future
eventually arrives. As Vanderbilt
observes, “The pursuit of a kind of
absolute safety, above all other con-
siderations,” can make things less
safe. For designers, lawmakers and
the rest of us, it’s worth keeping this
in mind. Complacency and comfort
have their place, but they also have
their perils, as we are learning.

Step into any home-improvement ﬆore 
these days and you’ll confront a smorgasbord of “eco-friendly” labels craed to grab 
your attention: VOC-Free! Saves Energy! All Natural! It’s easy to take a cynical attitude 
toward this profusion of promises. As “green” has gone mainﬆream, it’s become tough 
to tell the true contenders from the impoﬆors who slap on seduive ﬆickers. 
We’ve sied through hundreds of produs to bring you the beﬆ—innovations that 
lighten your home’s impa on the planet in a measurable, meaningful way. Our favor-
ites range from modeﬆ (an under-the-drain device that conserves shower heat) to 
mammoth (an entire home built from recycled shipping containers). e engineers 
behind these produs and syﬆems consider their work’s impa from development to 
disposal—no spin can subﬆitute for design that simply makes sense.

INTEGRITY BLOCK 
Building Better Concrete 
Manufauring the cement that binds typical
concrete causes about 5 percent of global CO2
emissions. Integrity Block, which makes a
ﬆruurally sound concrete replacement, shaves
that ﬁgure by using 40 percent less cement in its rammed-
earth masonry. Up to half of each block is composed of
quarry scraps. “Quarries are typically aer a particular
mineral,” says Shawn Cunningham, the company’s vice-
president of marketing. “Everything else gets poured out.” As
for looks: “When you ﬆack them againﬆ a concrete
equivalent, there’s no comparison,” Cunningham says. Aer
using these red Sedona landscape blocks, we tend to agree.
ECODRAIN 
Shower Heat 
Exchanger
  You already 
paid to heat the 
water washing 
down your shower 
drain—why waﬆe 
it? EcoDrain’s 
heat exchanger 
transfers heat 
from water 
passing through 
the shower drain 
to fresh cold 
water headed to 
the tap (the two 
don’t mix). A 
typical shower 
consumes 12 gal 
of hot water; the 
EcoDrain reduces 
the energy your 
water heater  
uses for that 
purpose by 25 to 
40 percent. 
   Colleing rainwater for gardening conserves 
supplies and controls runoﬀ—but moﬆ people 
don’t want a hulking tank out back. Auﬆralian  
archite Sally Dominguez says manufaurers 
“basically laughed” at her search for a svelte 
ciﬆern—so she designed her own. Each 6--tall 
Rainwater Hog ﬆores up to 51 gal, yet only 
occupies 1.3 sq  of yard. Its modular shape allows 
it to slide under the deck, squeeze againﬆ a side 
wall or sit side by side for greater capacity. Use the 
Hog with the RainTube gutter ﬁlter to clean water 
of debris before it enters the receptacle.

When it comes to heating and cooling large rooms eﬃciently, bigger fans are
better. Moﬆ regular-ass fans top out at juﬆ under 5  in diameter, but the blades
on a Big Ass Fan range from 6 to 24 . e size and design let them turn slowly—
using less energy—while ﬆill achieving 25 times the airﬂow of models you might
ﬁnd in a warehouse. Also, typical fans rely on gears that buzz audibly and reduce
eﬃciency; Big Ass models operate silently and smoothly courtesy of a series of
magnetic pads, which power the blades’ friion-free rotation. Unwelcome noise
prompted this Knoxville, Tenn., homeowner to replace his induﬆrial clunker with a
Big Ass Element model, which uses only a 3/4-hp motor to spin its 12- blades.

NATUREMILL
Easy Indoor 
Compoﬆ 
  Compoﬆ keeps 
food waﬆe out of 
landﬁlls while 
enriching garden 
topsoil—but 
producing it at 
home can be a dirty 
job. NatureMill’s 
under-the-counter 
compoﬆer makes 
the whole process 
as easy as tossing 
scraps into the 
kitchen disposal.  
“I was compoﬆing 
in my own yard, 
and I liked the 
beneﬁts, but I 
couldn’t ﬆand the 
smell,” says Russ 
Cohn, NatureMill’s 
founder and CEO. 
As waﬆe is mixed, 
heated and aerated 
in NatureMill’s 
upper chamber, a 
charcoal air ﬁlter 
neutralizes odors. 
Decomposed 
waﬆe then drops 
to a lower 
chamber, providing 
fresh loads of 
compoﬆ every two 
weeks. e entire 
process consumes 
5 kilowatt-hours a 
month—about as 
much as a typical 
night light.
Former merchant oﬃcer David
Cross got plenty of exposure to
shipping containers in the four years
he spent cruising the world on
cargo vessels. Cross saw the large
corrugated-ﬆeel boxes reused as tool
sheds in China, then later, as commu-
nications shelters for the military—
but he always thought their “higheﬆ
use” would be in housing. us began
Safe, Green (SG) Blocks, where Cross
now works as business development
direor. “We take inﬆruments of
trade and turn them into inﬆruments
of conﬆruion,” Cross says. ey do it
by cutting open several of the 40-
long, 8- wide, nearly 10--tall blocks
and combining them to form frames
for anything from simple Colonials to
the chic, modern Harbinger House
(le). Converting the boxes takes 95
percent less energy than scrapping
and extraing the usable metal; Cross
calls the adaptive process recycling on
ﬆeroids. Faor in the solar panels,
rainwater recycling and suﬆainable
ﬂooring options, and SG Blocks save
much more than ﬆeel boxes.

Reinventing the Tree 
 As organizations such as the Foreﬆ Stewardship Council (FSC) set the rules for 
safe harveﬆing, engineers are hard at work redeﬁning the nature of lumber itself. 
ese three wood alternatives represent a creative approach to a classic material.
ELEMENT FOUR WATERMILL 
Water From Air   
 British Columbia–based Element
Four helps ease water shortages
by pulling moiﬆure ﬆraight out
of the air. Engineered for muggy
outdoor environments or humid
indoor rooms, the wall-mountable
WaterMill conﬆantly adjuﬆs to the
ambient dew point. Fans pull in air,
then the water vapor within
condenses as it ﬂows across metal
coils. e condensation passes
through a carbon ﬁlter, and
ultraviolet light ﬆerilizes it. Each
WaterMill can produce up to
12 liters of potable water per day.
ENGINEERED TIMBER RESOURCES FLOORING FROM SALVAGED WOOD 
When companies mill furniture and paper, they create a waﬆe ﬆream 
of seemingly unusable wood. Engineered Timber Resources presses 
these poﬆinduﬆrial byprodus into new decking, ﬂooring, furniture 
and panels. Its ﬂagship produ, Songwood, combines the scraps of 
seven types of FSC-certiﬁed hardwood from the ﬂoors of Chinese 
mills, resulting in a beautifully ﬆriated grain.
OSMOSE MICROPRO BETTER PRESSURE-TREATED LUMBER
Pressure-treated lumber resiﬆs rot, fungus and inse damage, thanks 
to copper pressed into the boards. But moﬆ manufaurers dissolve 
the copper particles, creating a liquid preservative that leaches out and 
corrodes aluminum ﬂashing. Osmose grinds the copper particles 
inﬆead, so they penetrate into the wood in solid form. is means less 
leaching, no corrosion and lumber that shows a paint or ﬆain’s true 
color rather than pressure-treated wood’s telltale green hue.
NYLOBOARD CARPET-SCRAP COMPOSITE PANELS
An eﬆimated 5 billion pounds of used carpet enters U.S. landﬁlls each
year. Nyloboard colles these unwanted scraps, then melts them 
down into panels for use as ﬆruural sheathing. e produ has 
advantages over typical oriented-ﬆrand board or plywood. “e boards

In the silence and darkness, citizens 
may panic, or they may just sit tight and 
wait for it all to reboot. Either way, much 
of the country would be blind and unre-
sponsive to outside events. And that 
might be the enemy’s objective: Divert 
America’s attention while mounting an 
offensive against another country. 
Pentagon planners have long under-
stood the danger of cyber attacks on U.S. 
military networks. Indeed, the Defense 
Department’s Global Information Grid

computer networks on Earth. But the

espionage on military networks is not 
the only digital threat that keeps 
national-security experts up at night.

that keeps the country humming—
water-treatment facilities, refineries, 
pipelines, dams, the electrical grid—is 
operated using a hodgepodge of tech-
nologies known as industrial control 
systems. Like banks and telecommuni-
cations networks, which are also gener-
ally considered critical infrastructure, 
these industrial facilities and utilities 
are owned by private companies that 
are responsible for maintaining their 
own security.
But many of the control systems in 
the industrial world were installed years 
ago with few or no cyber-security fea-
tures. That wasn’t a big problem when 
these systems were self-contained. But 
in the past two decades, many of these 
controls have been patched into com-
pany computer networks, which are 
themselves linked to the Internet. And 
when it comes to computer security, a 
good rule of thumb is that any device 
that is computer-controlled and net-
worked is vulnerable to hacking.
Bad-guy hackers pulling the plug on 
public utilities is a common theme of 
Hollywood ﬁlms, including 2007’s Live 
Free or Die Hard, but such scenarios pres-
ent more than a mere ﬁctional scare to 
U.S. intelligence ofﬁcials. According to 
Melissa Hathaway, cyber-coordination 
executive for the Ofﬁce of the Director of 
National Intelligence, the list of poten-
tial adversaries in a cyber attack is long, 
ranging from disgruntled employees to 
criminals to hostile nations.
Most experts agree that China and 
Russia routinely probe our industrial 
networks, looking for information and 
vulnerabilities to use as leverage in any 
potential dispute. James Lewis, a 
cyber-security expert for the policy 
think tank Center for Strategic and 
International Studies (CSIS), says that 
although cyber warfare couldn’t crip-
ple the U.S., it could serve as an effec-
tive military tactic. “If I were China, 
and I were going to invade Taiwan,” he 
says, “and I needed to complete the 
conquest in seven days, then it’s an 
attractive option to turn off all the elec-
tricity, screw up the banks and so on.” 
Could the entire U.S. grid be taken 
down in such an attack? “The honest
answer is that we don’t know,” Lewis 
says. “And I don’t like that answer.”

CIA analyst Tom Donahue dropped a
bombshell on a small conference of gov-
ernment ofﬁcials and power-company 
engineers from the U.S. and Europe. 
He told them that extortionists had 
managed to hack into utilities in mul-
tiple regions outside the United States 
and disrupt power equipment. “In at 
least one case,” he said, “the disrup-
tion caused a power outage affecting 
multiple cities.” The CIA has been 
highly secretive about the incident, 
and Donahue would not discuss where 
the blackouts occurred or what compa-
nies were affected. But he admitted 
that the CIA had no idea who had per-
petrated the attacks. Hackers had 
shaken down a public utility, it seems, 
and had gotten away with it.

Some security professionals think
that government officials have been 
guilty of as much drama-mongering on 
the issue as Hollywood has. “Honestly, I 
think the threat is overblown,” says 
Bruce Schneier, author of Schneier on 
Security. “The risks today are due more 
to errors than to malicious intent.” He 
sees Donahue’s story as nothing more 
than a tenebrous rumor. Nevertheless, 
Schneier thinks vulnerabilities in infra-
structure will eventually become a real 
national-security threat.
The problem is that the errors that 
Schneier refers to can cause bad things 
to happen. Much of computer hacking 
is predicated on exploiting glitches in 
commonly used systems. Such exploits 
on a Windows PC are irritating, but at a 
nuclear facility, they can be unnerving.
In August 2006, a glitch shut down 
the Browns Ferry nuclear power plant in 
northern Alabama. Plant administra-
tors lost control of recirculation pumps 
on one of the plant’s reactors because 
of excessive data trafﬁc on the control-

Nuclear plants are designed to shut 
down in the event of major malfunc-
tions to prevent a Chernobyl-style catas-
trophe. But they also generate almost 
20 percent of U.S. power. What if a 
hacker exploited a coding error in a 
cooling system to shut down a sizable 
piece of the nation’s power supply?
Incidents of digital malfunctions 
that cause danger to human life are

about digital attacks is that you can 
steal information, and you may even be 
able to shut down critical systems, but 
any damage would be temporary and 
superﬁcial. A cyber attacker could gen-
erate a lot of confusion by killing the 
lights in California, but give the state 
and utility ofﬁcials a few days to reset 
the systems, and everything would be 
back up and running. It’s a phenom-

Eric Byres, of Byres Security, refers to as 
“weapons of mass annoyance.”

In the video, a massive, 
green diesel generator 
shakes violently and belches 
smoke as it goes into total 
meltdown. Dubbed the 
Aurora experiment, it dem-
onstrated how an over-the-
Internet cyber attack could 
cripple big, essential machines.
When the video hit CNN, it alarmed 
many in the utilities industry. Most of 
the details of the Aurora vulnerability 
have not been released, but DHS state-
ments about the experimental hack 
describe it as a man-in-the-middle, or 
spooﬁng, attack, in which a malicious 
computer intercepts all traffic going 
between two other computers, essen-
tially controlling the line of communi-
cation between them. According to 
Sean McGurk, director of control sys-
tems security for the DHS, the vulnera-
bility was common to control systems 
throughout critical infrastructure. 
THE SABOTEUR’S STORY
THE MOST FREQUENTLY TOLD
anecdote in the world of infrastructure
cyber security is that of Maroochy Shire. 
The incident, which occurred in Queens-
land, Australia, is viewed by many in  
the industry as an object lesson in the 
damage that can be done when some-
one with computer skills and a grudge 
takes aim at a public system. In 2000, 
Vitek Boden, a computer expert in his 
late 40s who had been turned down for 
a job in municipal government, rigged 
up his laptop computer to a radio- 
frequency wireless transceiver to hack 
into the city’s computerized wastewater 
management system. 
Over the course of two 
months, Boden broke 
into the system 46 
times, instructing it to 
spill hundreds of thou-
sands of gallons of raw 
sewage into rivers, 
parks and public areas. 
He was ﬁnally caught 
when a police ofﬁcer pulled him over 
and found control-systems equipment 
in his car.
The reason the Maroochy Shire inci-
dent is recounted so frequently is that it 
shows how difficult it is to thwart 
 hackers who want to disrupt the infra-
structure, since attacks can come from 
almost anywhere. An insider with 
detailed knowledge could target a spe-
cific company’s system, or a hacker 
could launch an anonymous Internet 
assault from a distant country.
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity’s Computer Emergency Readiness 
Team (known as US-CERT) encourages 
industry to report cyber accidents and 
intrusions, but there are few legal 
requirements for private companies to 
do so. It is possible that many more 
incidents have occurred, and compa-
nies have simply kept them quiet.  
Infrastructure is meant to last a long 
time, so upgrades to existing systems 
tend to occur at a glacial pace. “There is 
a long life cycle associated with this,” 
says Jeff Dagle, chief electrical engineer 
at the Department of Energy’s Northwest 
National Labs. “Utilities are used to this 
equipment lasting 30 years.” Never-
theless, big utilities and industrial facili-
ties are starting to see cyber security as a 
reliability issue, and are modernizing 
their equipment, building redundant, 
multitiered networks (a tactic known  
in military circles as “defense in depth”). 
The caveat is that with big utility  
networks such as the electrical grid,  
telecommunications or pipelines, a 
clever adversary wouldn’t attack the well-
defended components of the system. 
“Why should I go after the company that 
put a lot of money into securing its  
networks when I can get into one that 
hasn’t and damage them both?” asks the 
CSIS’s James Lewis.
Ironically, the current weakness  
of the economy may provide a shot in 
the arm for the digital defenses of criti-
cal infrastructure. Much of President 
Obama’s stimulus package is aimed at 
revitalizing infrastructure, and as anti-
quated equipment gets upgraded, mod-
ern security technology can be built in. 
One example is the Smart Grid, a 
Department of Energy plan that could 
receive around $4.5 billion to modern-
ize the nation’s electricity delivery 
 system with state-of-the-art computer 
controls. Of course, more computing 
technology in the grid allows for more 
potential attacks, but it could also mean 
a more robust and nimble defense.
The result may be infrastructure net-
works that are a lot like the Internet 
itself. The redundancy and ﬂexibility of 
the Internet’s core architecture has 
allowed it to withstand two massive 
denial-of-service attacks—in 2002 and 
2007—on the 13 Domain Name System 
root servers that make up the backbone 
of the system. In each instance, the serv-
ers absorbed incredible amounts of 
traffic as parts of the system either 
failed or came close to failing. To the 
engineers who run the system, it was 
terrifying, but the rest of the world 
barely noticed. If our infrastructure 
were that robust, the cyber war of the 
future might have little more impact on 
your life than a dimming of the lights 
and a shrug of your shoulders.

I HEAR THE HELICOPTER BEFORE I SEE IT. A gentle whir at ﬁrst, the noise grows 
to chain-saw strength as the orange-and-white-striped pod hurtles into view and 
settles into a hover over a paved landing pad just a couple of hundred yards from the 
Paciﬁc Ocean. Standing in the tall grass at the edge of the clearing, I brace myself 
against the rotor wash. One foot back, knees bent, head down. Even in my bulky 
ﬂight suit and visored helmet, the wind whips through me. If I stood up straight, 
the blast would knock me down.
In seconds, the aircraft—a 65-ft-long HH-60 Jayhawk—has settled gently onto 
the blacktop. The side door slides open, and the ﬂight mechanic jumps out. At his 
thumbs up, I run toward the open cab of the helicopter. The space inside is no 
bigger than the interior of an SUV and stacked with safety equipment: A rescue

professional rescuers. Most are Coasties, though two spots in 
each class are reserved for Air Force parajumpers or Navy res-
cue swimmers, who line up for the chance to train at the coun-
try’s most intensive helicopter rescue school. In all, half of the 
students have passed the grueling physical and mental tests 
that earn them the right to jump out of aircraft for a living. The 
other half are helicopter pilots and ﬂight mechanics. They’ve 
all practiced countless airlifts before, and most have helped 
to save lives in real rescues. This training presents challenges, 
though, that many have not encountered: bigger waves, colder 
water, caves, cliffs and unpredictable ocean currents.
IT TAKES ONLY MINUTES to reach the training site. One of 
the pilots spots sea lions, and I strain to see them out the win-
dow. We’re not much more than half a mile from shore, but 
the water is shallow: Every few minutes a 15-ft wave breaks, 
spreading a wall of froth over the ocean. 
By the time the pilots pull into a hover, rescue swimmers 
Michael von Bormann and Stephen Gonzalez are geared up 
in yellow rescue helmets, fins, 
masks and snorkels. They’ll 
take turns playing victim and 
rescuer today. Gonzalez—the 
victim—goes down ﬁrst. “Swim-
mer ready,” Bowers announces 
through the ICS as Gonzalez sits 
with his legs out the open cabin 
door, his black fins pointing 
down toward the waves below. 
Over his orange dry suit, Gonza-
lez wears a harness that’s clipped 
into a hook on the end of the heli-
copter’s external hoist. “Direct 
deployment of rescue swimmer 
to surf from 50 ft,” Bowers says, 
retracting the hoist cable and 
easing Gonzalez out the door.
Below us, rotor wash creates 
a perfect white disk of foamy 
spray. Gonzalez, spinning slowly as he descends, looks like 
he’s about to hit the bull’s-eye. The swimmer circles a forearm 
to the side of his body—the sign for “down.” Now detached 
from the ICS, Gonzalez must rely on precise hand signals that 
the ﬂight mechanic can “read” from his kneeling position at 
the edge of the open aircraft door. Bowers, in turn, feeds the 
pilots a constant stream of information: “Swimmer going 
down. Swimmer halfway down. Swimmer at the water.”
Being immersed in these waves can feel like being in a 
gigantic washing machine. The 100-mph winds whipped up 
by the rotors make matters worse. And so, today the crews are 
practicing rescues using a catenary procedure. The swimmer 
remains attached to the hoist while the ﬂight mechanic pays 
out enough cable—the stretch is called the catenary—to allow 
the bird to move to the side of the rescue scene, sparing victim 
and rescuer dangerous rotor wash. 
The maneuver requires constant, precise communication 
between ﬂight mechanic and pilots—and I listen in on all of

basket and harnesses used for pulling victims from the water, 
emergency survival suits and a life raft for the crew. I hook 
my helmet into the aircraft’s internal communication system 
(ICS)—the noise inside is far too loud to hear anyone without 
it—and buckle myself into the jumpseat. I practice releasing 
the buckle a few times to be sure I’ll be able to get out quickly 
if necessary. I’ve been told that you can survive a helicopter 
crash in water if you hang on tight to something inside the air-
craft. Let go, and you become disoriented. The windows have 
pull tabs that allow you to push them out in an emergency. As 
I’m studying them, we rise from the ﬁeld with a barely notice-
able shudder and swoop out toward the open ocean.
I’ve come to the Paciﬁc Northwest in late autumn to attend 
the Coast Guard’s Advanced Helicopter Rescue School in 
Astoria, Ore. Members of the armed forces have long been 
trained to deploy from aircraft to save downed comrades, 
and occasionally those skills have been applied to civilian 
rescue. The Coast Guard, however, didn’t have a program in 
place until the mid-1980s to allow a specially trained rescuer 
to leave the helicopter. By the early 1990s, every helicopter-
equipped Coast Guard air station had rescue swimmers on 
staff, saving dozens of lives a year. A steady supply of new 
rescue situations, though, highlighted the need for more spe-
cialized training, and ultimately helped prompt the creation 
of the advanced school in 1995. 
The one-week course is held eight times a year in the 
churning swells that form where the Columbia River meets 
the Paciﬁc at the border of Oregon and Washington state—an 
area known as the Graveyard of the Paciﬁc for the 2000 ship-
wrecks strewn across the ocean ﬂoor. The course is timed to 
take advantage of the most hazardous conditions this region 
can rile up. Today the classroom will be an area known as the 
Middle Grounds, near Cape Disappointment, Washington.
In the Jayhawk with me are two Coast Guard pilots sta-
tioned on Cape Cod, two Coast Guard rescue swimmers (one 
has come from Michigan, the other from Puerto Rico), a young 
ﬂight mechanic named David Bowers and school instructor 
Brian Daniels. This week’s 16 students are already full-time

it through the ICS. The men must synchronize the catenary 
length with the position of the helicopter. Too much line, and 
the rescue swimmer and victim in the water could become 
tangled in the excess, with deadly results. Too little, and they 
could be sent “waterskiing”—pulled violently along the sur-
face like a skipping stone. 
When he reaches the water, Gonzalez detaches from the 
hoist cable, which Bowers raises back to the helo. The pro-
cess is repeated with von Bormann, who will attempt to res-
cue Gonzalez. Once the two men are in the water, though, the 
waves pick up. Soon, Gonzalez and von Bormann are buried 
under a breaking swell more than 20 ft high.
It’s only a couple of seconds until they pop up, but from my 
vantage 50 ft up in the helicopter it seems much longer. 
“Took them a long time to surface on that one, didn’t 
it?” Daniels says, just moments before another wave 
breaks over the two tiny yellow dots—all that’s visible 
of Gonzalez and von Bormann. “Yeah, I didn’t see them 
for a little bit,” Bowers replies. It’s the mechanic’s job to 
keep the people in the water in sight, but in these condi-
tions, that’s nearly impossible. Another wave pummels 
the swimmers. “Alrighty, it’s getting to be pretty sporty,” 
one of the pilots announces.
The conditions seem harrowing, but the mood in the 
aircraft is calm. It takes only a couple of minutes before 
both swimmers are safely back inside, the only casualty 
a lost snorkel. Before I ever got in the helicopter I under-
stood the intensive preparation all these men go through 
to do their jobs. On the ﬁrst day of the class, I watched 
Gonzalez, von Bormann and the other swimmers easily pass 
a timed physical-fitness test comprising sit-ups and push-
ups—50 of each—as well as chin-ups, pull-ups and underwater 
sprints in a local pool. The pilots ﬂy weekly training missions 
and regularly practice emergency procedures in a simulator. 
From the back of the helicopter, though, it becomes clear 
that pulling off the rescues these men could face at any time 
demands more than individual physical or technical skill. 
It requires the ability to make decisions quickly and collab-
oratively. It requires each member of the four-person crew to 
remain focused and calm and to communicate clearly in the 
midst of chaos.
“They’re exposed to extreme situations,” says Senior Chief 
Clay Hill, the head of the school and himself a Coast Guard 
rescue swimmer. “We’re giving them the experience—and 
the conﬁdence—to face these conditions.” Once they’ve dealt 
with harrowing scenarios in training, such as a high-seas res-
cue, dealing with the same circumstances during a real emer-
gency becomes almost automatic, Hill explains. By the end of 
a typical ﬁve-day course, the students have studied classroom 
theory and have put theory to the test. They have lifted a victim 
from rough seas using a rescue basket as well as a harness 
system. The swimmers have completed 
drills in caves. They have struggled out 
from the beach through a half-mile of 
breaking surf and dangerous riptides. 
All the students, swimmers as well as 
ﬂight crews, have been left to ﬂoat on 
the open ocean, zipped up in tiny, tent-
like, one-man life rafts, simulating the experience of people 
they may someday be sent to rescue—individuals who may be 
too sick, too cold or just too scared to help themselves.
IT’S THE LAST DAY OF CLASS, and Gonzalez is again sit-
ting at the open doorway of the helicopter, this time above 
a coastal cliff. Below the helicopter, a plastic dummy affec-
tionately known as SpongeBob hangs precariously from the 
rock. Gonzalez’s job: Rescue the mannequin without detach-
ing himself from the hoist. As Gonzalez is lowered, Bowers 
again feeds the rest of the crew critical information: “Swim-
mer going down. Swimmer halfway down.” 
Gonzalez ﬁnds his footing on the cliff. From the helicop-
ter, the training exercise looks far more dangerous—and 
impressive—than the water rescue. It’s breezy, and we’re only 
a few dozen feet from unforgiving rock, yet the hover is per-
fectly still. I’m apparently not the only one who’s impressed: 
A crowd has gathered on a beach adjacent to the cliff. 
As the swimmer maneuvers toward the mannequin, Bow-
ers feeds the pilots commands to keep the hoist line plumb. 
If there’s too much of an angle between the belly of the heli-
copter and the swimmer, he’ll swing like a pendulum when he 
loses contact with the cliff. “Right 10, right ﬁve,” Bowers says. 
“Easy right and hold, hold.” Keeping his weight on the hoist 
line, Gonzalez shuffles downslope until he’s just beneath 
SpongeBob. Within a few minutes of exiting the helicopter, 
he has the dummy in a harness that attaches to his own and 
is ready to be pulled back up. Secured in a gunner’s belt at the 
open cabin door, I’ve watched the crowd on the beach grow. 
It’s too far away to tell if anyone is clapping, but as Gonzalez 
slides into the helicopter with SpongeBob, I know I want to. 
“Swimmer and victim are in the cabin,” Bowers announces. 
And with that, the Jayhawk backs smoothly away from the cliff 
and swoops up over the rugged Paciﬁc coastline.

THE ADRENALINE RUSH that comes from piloting a sporty car or
a hot-blooded motorcycle through a series of sinuous curves is a joy
every gearhead craves. It’s not all about gunning for ﬂat-out, maximum

velocity and precision and the experience becomes more than just a
cheap thrill—it’s an accomplishment.

toy and a fuel-efﬁcient commuter. The big question is, two
wheels or four? We gathered together a pair of seemingly
dissimilar vehicles—a high-strung, Italian-bred Ducati
Hypermotard 1100 S and a sensible, versatile Honda Fit
Sport—to see how they stack up when it comes to fun, prac-
ticality and fuel efﬁciency. We brought them both to Auto
Club Raceway in Pomona, Calif., and ran them through our
usual instrumented tests. We braved many miles of Los
Angeles’ famous trafﬁc, and then, ﬁnally, we had some fun
on Glendora Mountain Road, a 15-mile roller coaster of
twisting, turning blacktop in Angeles National Forest. So
can a sexy superbike compete with a fuel-efﬁcient hatch-
back when it comes to value? Can the humble car match the
bike for driving thrills? The results may surprise you.
FOR WORK
e excitement of any PM teﬆ is tempered the moment
we leave the ofﬁce and hit the crowded freeways of Los Ange-
les. Yet the $15,660 Ducati turns the rigors of rush hour into
a real-life video game. The machine is proud to be loud.
Twist the grip and the cannonlike exhaust lets out a bark
that echoes off 18-wheelers and makes pedestrians jump.
Sometimes it’s good to be bad. The tremendous torque of
the 1078 cc L-twin rolls on instantly. And with short gearing,
we burst through holes in trafﬁc. The downside to these
thrills is comfort—we were saddle-sore in less then 100
miles. And there’s no windscreen. Once clear of trafﬁc—at
70 mph—the wind buffeting is ﬁerce and tiring.

In contrast, the $17,580 Honda Fit 
Sport, loaded down with luggage and test 
gear, made the grueling rush-hour test 
loop, well, easy. Compared to the Ducati, 
the Fit is like a Boeing Business Jet. The 
effortless five-speed automatic meant  
our feet were not fatigued by clutch work. 
And of course, the fully enclosed, climate-
controlled cabin—not to mention the 
MP3-ready 160-watt audio system—kept 
stop-and-go frustrations to a minimum. 
The Fit is no Lexus, but it’s a cocoon of 
silence compared to the bike. You arrive at 
your destination relaxed—not frazzled, 
with a bad case of helmet head. 
The Hypermotard does hold one prac-
tical commuting advantage—lane split-
ting. The California Highway Patrol says 
lane splitting is “permissible but must be 
done in a safe and prudent manner.” We 
oblige. The Hypermotard has a tall, 
upright riding position—similar to a dirt 
bike’s. So visibility and maneuverability 
are excellent. The major disadvantage is 
the lack of room for people and their stuff. 
Yes, the Hypermotard can handle one pas-
senger. But as a vessel to transport gear 
and people, the Fit claims an easy victory. 
Pipe Dreams 
e Ducati’s beautifully 
craed exhauﬆ is routed 
underneath the seat and 
oﬀers twice the number 
of pipes as the Honda 
for half the number of 
cylinders.
Strily Business
e Honda’s analog 
gauge package is 
remarkably simple—and 
we like that. e Ducati 
uses a digital readout 
that’s diﬃcult to see—
and, like moﬆ bikes, it 
has no gas gauge.
qON THE WEEKEND
e Ducati produces 95 hp and weighs just 397 pounds. 
The Fit delivers 22 more hp but has to haul more than an 
extra ton of metal, glass and rubber. Not surprisingly, the 
Ducati was the star of the dragstrip. Our hired gun, profes-
sional test rider Matthias Jezek, hustled the Hypermotard 
to 60 mph more than 6 seconds quicker than we could man-
age in the Honda. In fact, the Ducati reaches 90 mph before 
the Honda even gets to 60 mph—about two-and-a-half sec-
onds sooner. That’s staggering. So it seems like the Fit must 
be no fun at all, right? We disagree. The Honda isn’t quick—
heck, it’s downright slow. But that doesn’t mean you can’t 
have a blast on a really good slab of tarmac.  
Glendora Mountain Road rises from roughly 750 ft at 
the base to around 3500 ft near the top. It doesn’t have  
long, sweeping curves but rather tight corners that reward 
a nimble machine. The Ducati is made for this road. Its  
long-travel suspension, breathtaking engine and nearly 
race-spec Brembo brakes make short work of switchbacks. 
But on test day, Glendora was a mineﬁeld. Recent rain-
storms had loosened debris from above and caused dirt 
and softball-size rocks to roll down onto the road. It takes  
a special kind of bravado (or stupidity) to ride a motorcycle 
at 10/10ths when every corner hides a mudslide. And we 
did dial back our speed. Still, short of a full-ﬂedged enduro, 
this Hypermotard was as well-suited to the challenging  
terrain as any ride. 
One might have thought the Italian Stallion would have 
walked away from the lowly Fit on this road. But at almost 
every turn heading up the mountain, the Fit ﬁlled the bike’s 
rearview mirror. The handling balance and grip from this 
Honda is extraordinary for a car in its class. You can ﬂing the 
Fit hard into the tightest corner, ride the brakes slightly to 
take the edge off the understeer and then power out to the 
next turn. It was surprisingly quick, especially on the down-
hill, where momentum makes up for the lack of engine power. 
The Fit actually arrived at the bottom of Glendora ahead of 
the Ducati—its front brakes nearly smoking. Fun? Oh yeah.
qTHE BOTTOM LINE
So, which one oﬀers the beﬆ bang for the buck? There’s 
no easy answer. The Ducati and Honda are both fun, but 
we’d certainly crown the ﬁre-breathing Hypermotard king 
of that battle. As a commuter, we’ll give the edge to the Fit. 
The Ducati can make better time, but the stiff seat and 
cramped foot-peg position mean this bike isn’t our ﬁrst 
choice for a long-distance cruise. The Fit, on the other 
hand, would be comfortable enough for a cross-country 
Cannonball Run. The endgame comes down to fuel efﬁ-
ciency and price. Over our test route, the Honda returned a 
solid 29.8 mpg. But the high-strung, Italian-bred superbike 
delivered an incredible 48.9 mpg and cost about $1900 less. 
That’s the tipping point. Winner: .

RAISED BEDS TAKE THE  
HASSLE OUT OF HORTICULTURE.  
BY FIONA GILSENAN

Experienced gardeners use raised
beds to sideﬆep a long liﬆ of gar-
dening challenges. ese controlled
experiments in plant parenthood
are so easy, in fa, that they’re also
well-suited to novices picking up a
shovel for the ﬁrﬆ time.
Bad dirt is out, because you ﬁll a
raised bed with a cuﬆomized soil-
and-compost blend. Drainage is
built into the bed walls, which hold
the soil in place to keep erosion
in check. Greater exposure to the
sun warms the bed, which allows
more plant diversity and extends
the growing season. Plants can be

string, then dig with vertical strokes
along the outline, juﬆ deep enough to
bury about half of your ﬁrﬆ course of
lumber. Raised beds are designed so
water trickles down, eliminating moﬆ
of the problem of poor drainage. But if
your only viable location is bogged in a
marsh, you can prevent the “bathtub
eﬀe” by digging a few inches deeper
and putting a layer of coarse ﬆone or
pea gravel in the excavation. (You can
also inﬆall perforated drainage pipes
in trenches under or around the bed,
or juﬆ drill weep holes at the base of
the sides.) Likewise, if there is no turf
between your beds, put down some
landscape fabric and cover it with
pavers or a layer of gravel to improve
drainage—aer running out in the rain
for a fresh bell pepper, you’ll appreciate
the mud-free shoes.
Level the earth or gravel layer at the
bottom of the bed, then put down a
layer of weed-suppressing landscape
fabric that extends to the outer edge
of the wooden frame. Now is also the
time to think about peﬆ control. “e
rich soil in a raised bed has worms and
level. In general, a north–south orien-
tation takes full advantage of avail-
able light. Stay close to the kitchen,
but avoid sites shaded by the house
or beneath messy trees. Leave at
least 18 in. between beds for walk-
ways, or 2 ft if you need room for a
wheelbarrow or lawnmower.
Planning, Building
To prepare the site, get rid of turf
and weeds. Outline the bed dimen-
sions on the ground with chalkline or
spaced closely together, so yields
go up, water-use efficiency is maxi-
mized and weeds are crowded out.
Finally, raising the soil level by even a
foot reduces the back-bending eﬀort
needed for jobs such as planting,
weeding and harveﬆing.
Beyond the ease is the control—as
you grow your favorite foods, you feed
and soak your plants with just what
they need for optimum growth.
A raised bed is most productive
and attractive as a bottomless frame
set into a shallow trench. The sides
can be almost any durable build-
ing material, including rock, brick,
concrete and interlocking blocks.
Watering troughs or claw-foot tubs
can work, as long as they have the
capacity and drainage.
But by far the moﬆ common mate-
rial for raised beds is lumber. e major
caveat, since raised beds are often
used to grow edibles, is to ﬆeer clear
of wood preserved with toxins. Avoid
creosote-treated railroad ties; opt
inﬆead for naturally rot-resiﬆant cedar
or redwood. e EPA considers wood
infused with alkaline copper quaternary
(ACQ) to be safe for food crops, but if
you use this pressure-treated wood
you may want to line the bed interior
with landscape fabric—an air-and-
water-permeable screen—to prevent
soil conta. Whether using pressure-
treated or naturally rot-resiﬆant wood,
put the bed together with galvanized
or ﬆainless screws or bolts.
Location, Location
A 3 x 6– bed should be wide enough
to support sprawling tomatoes, but
narrow enough to reach easily from
both sides. e ideal height is 1 to 2 
tall—you can go taller, but you need
a considerable amount of soil to ﬁll a
3-ft-high bed. If possible, build more
than one bed, which makes it easier
to rotate crops and meet the watering
needs of speciﬁc plants. Aligning beds
in ﬆraight rows simpliﬁes the inﬆalla-
tion of an irrigation syﬆem.

Tom Wilhite says. “To keep out burrow-

tom layer of hardware cloth”—a mesh
grid of ﬆeel or galvanized metal.
Build each wall separately, then
fasten them together and put the

for stability, either at the inside cor-

side walls. These help hold the bed
Automate, Irrigate
Once you add an automatic water-
ing syﬆem to your raised-bed garden,
you’re free to plant, weed and harveﬆ.
A simple micro-irrigation setup ensures
that plants get water consistently—
especially important for seedlings and
leaf crops such as lettuce. “e sides of
raised beds heat up quickly in the sun,
baking the moiﬆure out of the soil,” Wil-
hite says. “Irrigation delivers the water
evenly and gently. You can set your timer
to water early in the morning—less will
evaporate, and you resiﬆ disease.”
A basic setup ﬆarts with a faucet or
hose-bib attachment that is essentially
a series of valves that prevent back ﬂow
into the plumbing, ﬁlter the water and
control the water pressure.
These valves are designed with
1-in. or ¾-in. conneions. From these,
attach supply lines of ﬂexible ½-in. poly
tubing. e tubing’s accessibility makes
it easy to check for leaks and repair
damage from punures or burﬆs. To
prote the tubing, bury it a few inches
and cover the line with mulch.
Lay the tubing along the beds in
lines 12 in. apart. Fit seions together
with compression elbow and T-ﬁttings.
Inﬆall drip emitters at 12-in. intervals
along the length of the tubing for even
delivery of moisture to plants. Low-
volume sprayers or miﬆers on risers
can also be used, but these lose more
water to evaporation. Close the ends
of each line with hose-end plugs and
caps. en sit back and let the syﬆem
water for you.

in place, but can also reduce the out-
ward pressure that a full bed exerts
on the frame, which can dislodge the
lumber after a single season. A cap
railing that runs around the top of the
bed ties everything together. Plus, it
provides a handy place to set down
gardening tools while working, or,
when you’re done, a seat to admire
the fruits of your labor.
Greenhouse Eﬀe
A simple framework of hoops and a
lightweight cover can extend your
growing season in cool areas, con-
serve moiﬆure in dry areas and pro-
te plants from birds or inses. Use
clear polyethylene film to raise soil
and air temperatures in early spring or
fall—to get an early ﬆart on heirloom
tomatoes, for inﬆance, or to try your
hand at exotic squashes. But be care-
ful not to bake your plants on warmer
days. Remove the cover or slit vents
in it to avoid excessive heat buildup.
For peﬆ control, cover the bed with
bird netting or with gauzelike fabrics
known as ﬂoating row covers, which
keep out ﬂying inses but let in both
light and air.
Drip emitters 
spaced evenly at 
12-in. intervals 
send water to 
the plants’ roots 
throughout the 
bed. Inﬆall spray 
emitters to give 
leafy greens a 
rinse above the 
soil’s surface.

Windows are complex. A new model may
consiﬆ of wood, metal, plaﬆic, glass, mineral
oxides and perhaps an inert gas. Yet even a
well- insulated unit delivers an R-value no bet-
ter than an uninsulated wood-frame wall’s 
 (roughly R-4 to R-5). And a house can lose
nearly 12,000 Btu per hour, or about 10 per-
cent of a heating syﬆem’s output, juﬆ through 
these leaky openings. at means there’s a lot 
at ﬆake when it comes to choosing, inﬆalling
and sealing windows.
Adding ﬆorm windows cuts heating losses
from drafty windows in half, and replacing
them with an insulated product pares the 
 losses ﬆill further. Finally, a modern unit holds 
in heat, reﬂeing it from you and your heating 
syﬆem back into the room. It seals out dras 
and fends oﬀ summer sun. 
Here’s what you need to know.

No Pane, No Gain e tendency of a window to 
let heat pass is described as its U-faor—lower is 
more energy-eﬃcient. It’s the inverse of R-value, which 
describes insulation’s resiﬆance to heat ﬂow; higher is 
better. Adding a second piece of glass dramatically 
improves the window’s U-faor. While a single-pane 
window is rated at 1.1, a second pane cuts the U to 
the range of 0.47 to 0.63. Filling the space between 
the panes with argon inﬆead of air drops it to 0.37. 
Argon is a better insulator than air, a diﬆin 
advantage of insulated glass compared to a ﬆorm 
window inﬆalled on the outside of the house.

REPLACING WINDOWS  SURE, WEATHERSTRIPPING 
HELPS TO REDUCE DRAFTS. BUT WHEN LARGER  
ENERGY SAVINGS ARE CALLED FOR, THERE ARE  
THREE COMMON OPTIONS.
Inﬆant Gratiﬁcation
Few window upgrades are as easy 
and useful as sealing out dras with 
peel-and-ﬆick weatherﬆrip. Firﬆ, use 
spray cleaner and remove dirt and 
grease from the jambs or sash. When 
the parts are dry, cut the weather-
ﬆrip to length, peel oﬀ its plaﬆic 
backing and press the ﬆrip’s ﬆicky 
surface into place. Use V-shaped 
ﬆrips on window jambs; use 
bulb-shaped ﬆrips (shown) on the 
window’s top or bottom edge. A $5 
roll of the material is enough to seal 
two or three typical windows.
In winter, the inner surface of 
window glass can be 5 to 20 F 
cooler than the adjacent indoor air, 
depending on the window’s 
thermal eﬃciency and how cold it 
is outside. Indoor air cools as it 
passes over the window and sinks, 
producing an uncomfortable dray 
zone. Insulated glass with a low 
U-value is warmer and improves  
comfort near windows.
Also, the larger the glass 
surface, the more it needs a low-E 
coating, a microscopically thin layer 
of metal oxide that reﬂes back 
infrared energy. Without the 
coating, the heat ﬂowing out from 
your body would ﬂow to and 
through the glass, increasing your 
discomfort. But a low-E coating 
bounces the infrared energy back, 
so you feel warmer.

It’s not really a matter of which system is better, because both can work well.
You need to decide which style meets your cost and design requirements. A
basic wire-shelf setup is less expensive than cabinet systems, but the latter option
provides a neater, more ﬁnished look. In most cases, you can install any of these
organizers using nothing more than a cordless drill and simple hand tools.
If you’re up for a challenge, though, consider building your own system.
Inexpensive hardwood and sowood lumber, or plywood with some solid-wood
edge banding, can yield a very attraive closet, especially when you combine it
with well-designed hardware. Woodworking-supply outﬁts such as rockler.com oﬀer
attraive accessories, including sliding racks and garment hooks, while sites such
as kitchensource.com sell a variety of sliding baskets. Doing it yourself can be more
satisfying, and it will ensure that you use every cubic inch the way you want—not
the way some closet-organizer company envisioned it.
While you’re upgrading the space inside the closet, don’t ignore the door.
Swinging hollow-core and solid wood doors can be pressed into service to support
Q
Our closets are packed and overﬂowing. We were thinking 
of renovating them with wire shelving and baskets, but 
we’ve also seen some wood cabinets for closets. Which is 
better? Is installing these closet systems diﬃcult?
Closet
Solutions 
Closets are oen 
framed sloppily, with 
walls that are neither 
square nor plumb. Once 
I even ﬆripped away old 
drywall and found the 
closet had been framed 
with scrap lumber—
turned sideways. Here’s 
how to cope. 
1.  
Before you ﬆart build-
ing shelves and inﬆall-
ing drawers, measure 
the walls carefully and 
check for square and 
plumb by holding  
a framing square in  
the corners and a level 
on the walls. 
2.  
If the walls are out of 
kilter, make your syﬆem 
self-contained—with 
sharp 90 degree angles 
and vertical sides. You’ll 
waﬆe a little space, but 
that’s better than trying 
to cuﬆom-ﬁt shelves 
and supports to a crazy 
quilt of angles.
3.  
Even if the walls are 
plumb and level, don’t 
count on regular ﬆud 
spacing when it’s time to 
inﬆall your new units—in 
many homes, you won’t 
ﬁnd it. Spend some time 
with a ﬆud sensor and 
mark out the ﬆud loca-
tions. is can save you 
a lot of fruitless drilling 
later on.  — R.B.

paint galvanized ﬆeel, as your peeling
paint illuﬆrates. For one thing, it may
come to have a slightly oily surface
that will cause paint to loose its grip.
Also, the zinc in the galvanized coating
reas with the paint resins in oil paints
(alkyds), forming a soapy subﬆance.
Known as saponiﬁcation, this process
will peel oil-based paint like nobody’s
business. It might be simpler to let
the reﬆ of the paint peel oﬀ and leave
the posts alone—or blast off the
remaining paint with a pressure
washer. (Don’t pull out a sander,
though: You can accidentally scour
right through the zinc layer.)
If you do want to paint the steel,
start by thoroughly washing the sur-
face to remove oily residue, oxides
and dirt. Buy some TSP, otherwise
known as trisodium phosphate, at a
hardware ﬆore, and mix this powdered
cleaner at a ratio of ½ cup to 2 gal of
hot water. (is will produce an alka-
line cleaner with a pH of 11.5.) Scrub
the surface using a plaﬆic brush or an
aggressive plastic scouring pad, and
rinse thoroughly with hot, clear water.
Let the surface dry. Some painters use
ﬆeel wool for this job, but once again
there’s a risk of cutting right through
the galvanized layer.
Next, lightly abrade the surface
with the plaﬆic pad or abrasive paper
to ensure a uniform roughness, remove
loose paint with a scraper and sand the
edge of peeled paint to feather its edge
to a smooth transition. Brush oﬀ the
dust and rinse the posts. Then, once
the surface has thoroughly dried, apply
an acrylic primer. Use a produ formu-
lated to be compatible with galvanized
metal. One example is Rust-Oleum
Stops Ruﬆ Aluminum Primer. Top-coat
that with a professional-quality gloss or
semigloss acrylic paint.
Dumping the Pump?
How long do sump pumps laﬆ?
I have one that’s 10 years old, 
and I’m wondering if I should pre-
emptively replace it.
at’s a good queﬆion with no clear
answer, at leaﬆ as far as I’m concerned.
I’ve seen heavy-duty pumps that looked
as sound aer 10 years as the day they
were lowered into the murky depths
of a basement sump. But then, some
years ago, I saw a sump pump fail
aer only a couple of years when its
stainless-steel band clamp rotted a
groove through its cast-iron body.
(Stainless ﬆeel put in conta with caﬆ
iron and submerged underwater sets
up a powerful corrosion cell.)
If the pump doesn’t run very oen,
check it a couple of times a year by
pouring a few gallons of water into
the sump. The mechanism should
run quietly and robustly. If it sounds
tie racks, belt and coat hooks, small
baskets, shoe hangers and a mirror.
Painting Galvanized Steel
I have two galvanized ﬆeel poﬆs
that hold up a sign with my house’s 
ﬆreet number. e paint is peeling 
oﬀ the poﬆs. How do I repaint them?
Firﬆ, decide if you really want to paint
the poﬆs. A galvanized ﬁnish will form
a corrosion-resistant surface that
doesn’t need paint. And it’s tough to

efficient route would be to install  
airtight retroﬁt lights designed for insu-
lation conta and then get into the attic 
and seal all air gaps and add extra insu-
lation. Unfortunately, this could involve 
signiﬁcant wiring work and expense.
Modern recessed lights are designed 
to be operated on what’s known as  
90 C (194 F) wiring, but if your house 
was built before the mid-1980s, 
chances are good that the lighting-
circuit wiring has a lower temperature 
rating. It won’t be up to the job of safely 
supplying current to the new ﬁxtures. 
You or an elerician would need either 
to inﬆall new wire all the way from the 
switch to the ﬁxtures, or at leaﬆ splice 
90 C wire into the lighting circuit and 
lead it to a junion box in the attic.
ere are simpler, low-coﬆ alterna-
tives. For example, you can improve 
the energy efficiency of the lights by 
inﬆalling gaskets under their trim, or 
you can install an airtight trim that 
retroﬁts into the exiﬆing can. (e can 
is the cylindrical metal housing that 
makes up the body of the light.) ere 
is also a compact-fluorescent-light 
retrofit kit from Technical Consumer 
Produs (tcpi.com). is kit does cut 
air loss through the ﬁxture, but its pri-
mary funion is to reduce energy use 
by providing for a compa ﬂuorescent 
bulb and compatible reﬂeor in many 
common recessed lights. 
A word of caution is in order. Not 
all retrofit components are cross- 
compatible, nor are all retrofit com-
ponents compatible with all recessed 
lights. The light’s trim, can and light 
bulb all have to work together. The 
compatibility information is listed 
inside the can—when in doubt, conta 
the manufacturer. Whatever you do, 
be sure not to inﬆall a higher-wattage 
bulb in the ﬁxtures aer you’ve inﬆalled 
airtight components. Elericians call 
the praice “overlamping.” It can lead 
to dangerous overheating, especially in 
older lights that don’t have a thermal 
switch to detect high heats and cut 
power if necessary.
Caulk for Glazing 
I have a 100-year-old 
house, and I’ve hired 
painters to paint it and 
refurbish its 40 wood 
windows. ey say they’re 
going to use caulk to 
repair the putty that the 
old window glass is set in. 
Is this a proper repair? I 
thought only window glaz-
ing would work for this. 
Please advise.
If the painters literally 
meant caulk, then they’re 
making a mistake. You 
should probably ﬁnd some-
body else to do the job. If, 
on the other hand, they 
meant gun-grade glazing 
compound, then they’re 
doing the job right. This 
ﬆuﬀ is much like traditional 
knife-grade glazing com-
pound, but it’s extruded 
out of a cartridge inserted 
in a caulk gun. The tradi-
tional knife-applied version 
is scooped out of the can, 
 suspicious, check it. To teﬆ the switch, 
Tom Schere, an engineer at North 
Dakota State University, suggests 
slowly pouring water into the sump, 
which will cause the switch to turn on 
and oﬀ a few times.
Dray Fixtures,
Tricky Elericals
When I removed a bulb from a 
recessed light in my living room, I 
felt cold air gushing from the attic 
into the room. I’m concerned about 
energy loss through these ﬁxtures. 
What should I do?
Recessed lights are notorious for leak-
ing air. In the summer, conditioned air 
ﬆreams paﬆ them and into the attic or 
a ceiling cavity. In the winter, the same 
thing happens with heated air. In the 
case of the attic, this warmed air can 
contribute to ice dams on a roof.
Although it’s a major undertaking, 
the moﬆ elerically safe and energy-
P M  D I Y  H O M E  /// H O M E O W N E R S  C L I N I C  Q + A

kneaded into a roll and then care-
fully tooled onto the sash with a 
putty knife. e skill to do it neatly 
and quickly is a disappearing art. 
  
Doorﬆop Solution
ere’s probably an easy answer 
to this. I want to replace the door-
ﬆops all over the house because 
the cheapo ones inﬆalled by the 
builder are ugly. I put a new one 
in a few weeks ago and scuﬀed it 
up by using pliers to twiﬆ it in the 
laﬆ couple of turns. ere seemed 
no other way to grip the thing. 
Obviously, my wife wasn’t pleased. 
Neither was I.
Try peeling oﬀ the ﬆop’s rubber bum-
per. Under the bumper, some ﬆops 
have a slot for a screwdriver tip cut 
into the sha end. Other ﬆops have 
a square base that allows you to slip 
an adjuﬆable wrench over it.
Home-Grown Power 
Problem 
We lose grid power a lot, and 
I’ve found that I can’t operate my 
garage-door opener on the power 
supplied by my home generator. 
e opener works ﬁne with grid 
power, but not from my generator. 
I’m ﬆumped.
We’ve been getting more of these 
reports, although most of them 
concern appliances. I suspe sensi-
tive eleronics are to blame. In one 
case, we learned from an appliance 
manufaurer that they equip their 
ranges with self-monitoring eleron-
ics that shut the appliance down if 
they dete a minor discrepancy in 
the supply voltage. It comes down 
to liability fears. Manufaurers take 
advantage of adding monitoring 
components that can prevent dam-
age to the appliance or, in the worﬆ 
case, an elerical ﬁre. I can’t blame 
them for inﬆalling this ﬆuﬀ, though 
it won’t make your life any easier in 
a power outage. 
Try this: Plug the garage-door 
opener into a power ﬆrip equipped 
with a power filter, and plug the 
power strip into the ceiling out-
let that supplies the opener. If it 
works, you’ve solved your problem. 
If not, double check that the trans-
fer switch that the generator routes 
power through is properly inﬆalled. 
e problem could be as simple as a 
slightly loose conneion. 
  
Storm-Damaged Trees 
Our trees took a beating this win-
ter from repeated ﬆorms. We’re 
about ready to begin our spring 
yard cleanup, but before we ﬆart, 
we thought we’d get some advice.
If the damage is light and the trees 
are small enough that you can make 
repair cuts while standing on the 
ground, you can probably handle the 
work. If the damaged limbs are well 
up oﬀ the ground, call in a pro.
Trees that grow in sunny yards 
have codominant stems—they 
have more than one ﬆem or large 
branch that competes with the main 
ﬆem. A tree that grows in a foreﬆ 
will be tall and straight because 
it has to push up through a shady 
and crowded environment to reach 
sunlight. It’s diﬃcult to assess and 
safely treat ﬆorm damage to a tree 
with co dominant stems. To the 
untrained eye, it can look like noth-
ing more than a tangled mass. If you 
decide to tackle the job, ﬁrﬆ do your 
homework. Learn how to identify 
and treat diﬀerent types of damage 
by looking on the Web at visual ref-
erences poﬆed by ﬆate agricultural 
extension services and universities 
with horticultural programs. If you’re 
going to hire a professional, it’s 
important to distinguish between 
a company that specializes only in 
tree removal and one that employs 
or is owned by a certiﬁed arboriﬆ— 
a specialiﬆ trained in tree care (visit 
isa-arbor.com to learn more). Only an 
arboriﬆ can assess the beﬆ way to 
deal with the damage and to ensure 
a tree’s future health.

ENGINE ASSEMBLY. HERE’S 
THE RIGHT WAY TO  
REPLACE IT. BY MIKE ALLEN
Silence  
at  
Squeal 
ere’s a squeal emanating from
underneath your hood—and it doesn’t
sound good. e noise ﬆarted a few
months ago, on a gray and rainy
morning, but it went away before
you even pulled out of the driveway.
Problem solved, right? Sorry pal.
Unfortunately, the noise was back
the very next morning, and this time
it laﬆed all the way to the corner of
your block. You lied the hood and
zoomed in on the oﬀending racket—
it was the serpentine belt. As the
is belt, obvi-
ously paﬆ its 
prime, ran for 
115,000 miles, 
and it was ﬆill 
within the ten-
sion limits speci-
ﬁed. It’s toaﬆ, 
regardless.

weeks dragged on, your morning com-
mute got noisier and noisier every day.
en you began to hear it on the way
home too. Now it’s a conﬆant reminder
to replace the belt. Soon.
Most modern cars don’t use old-
fashioned V-belts anymore. In the ’70s,
as more and more cars were optioned
with lots of power-hungry accessories
running off the crankshaft pulley, it
often became necessary to have as
many as four V-belts, each running a dif-
ferent gizmo. ere juﬆ isn’t room for
that many belts and pulleys anymore—
not to mention, this belt conﬁguration
means that it’s a service nightmare
to replace juﬆ the inner belt by itself.
You’d have to remove the other three
ﬁrﬆ—not a fun job.
There are several advantages to
long time. A fresh belt will probably
laﬆ 150,000 miles without any main-
tenance at all. Contraﬆ that with the
expeed 40,000- to 50,000-mile life
span of a heavily loaded V-belt.
Failure Modes
So when, exactly, does one of these
belts need to be replaced? Usually, you
get plenty of warning before you hear
the ﬁnal Bad Noise, to wit, that squeal-
ing. A squealing noise is indicative of a
problem, but might not require replace-
ment of the belt. Misaligned pulleys or
a seized tensioner or idler pulley can
generate some noise as well.
A belt that’s ﬆarting to disintegrate
will show damage to the ribs or cords,
which can usually be seen without dis-
mantling anything. But you might need
a ﬂashlight and a dental mirror to see
the fraying or cracking.
Fresh Belt
Start by ﬆudying the old belt’s rout-
ing, which should be easy if the belt is
ﬆill in place. But it’s probably not so
easy to spot if the belt is wadded up
like macramé next to the a/c compres-
sor’s mounting bracket. Fear not: ere
should be a belt-routing placard under
the hood. If the car has had bodywork
or been repainted, the placard might
have been covered. Look in the owner’s
manual; there’s usually a routing dia-
gram. With a half-dozen pulleys to
the new style of serpentine belts. A
single belt, winding its way through a
foreﬆ of pulleys, can now drive every
single engine accessory at the same
time. A single belt only an inch or so
wide saves 3 or 4 in. of engine room
real estate. Better still: Most of the
serpentine-belt installations use a
spring-loaded tensioner pulley that
keeps a conﬆant preload on the belt,
eliminating the need to adjuﬆ the ten-
sion. If you’ve ever needed three hands
and a tire iron to pry an alternator away
from the block while simultaneously
tightening the adjuﬆment bolt-and-nut
combo, you’ll appreciate what a giant
leap forward that is.
There’s one last, very compelling
advantage to serpentine belts: They
don’t wear out, at leaﬆ not for a really

en you can juﬆ 
unthread the belt 
from around the 
pulleys. 
Use a ﬆraight-
edge to see if all 
the pulleys are 
coplanar and 
square. If they’re 
not, the new belt 
won’t laﬆ long.

for any idler pulleys, which should spin
freely. We replaced the tensioner on our
Suburban and added a drop of thread-
locker to the bolt. e tensioner came
with a new bolt—nice.
Is the area where the belt lives oily?
Engine oil will rapidly degrade the rub-
ber in the belt. Repair any leaky engine
seals, like the cranksha or camsha
front seal, or any gaskets—leﬆ the new
belt should go south in short order.
Clean up any old oil too.
Check all the pulleys as well. Old rub-
ber or dirt can build up in the bottom
of the pulley grooves. You may need to
clean the grooves with brake cleaner or
a wire brush to remove any debris.
Buttoning Up
It’s a simple matter to inﬆall a new ten-
sioner and reinﬆall the belt, holding the
tensioner slack with one hand as you
thread the laﬆ pulley. Once the belt’s in
place, ﬆart the engine and let it idle for
a minute or two. Check the belt tension
by looking at the tensioner arm—the
mark caﬆ into the tensioner body will
fall between the high and low marks if
the belt is the corre part number and
is inﬆalled properly.
If you removed any of the radiator
shrouding to access the belt, don’t
neglect to reinstall it once you’ve
finished. You certainly don’t want
any new noises coming from under
the hood.
FC
choose from, it’s possible, sometimes,
to install the belt the wrong way. It
might look right, but spinning the a/c
compressor or water pump back-
wards isn’t good. If the belt is hard to
inﬆall or seems to ﬁt poorly, you may
have it routed incorrectly. Don’t
freak—sometimes the water pump
is driven by the ﬂat, back side of the
belt. Any pulley that has grooves on
it is intended to conta the grooved
side of the belt. If you need to, sketch
the corre routing down before you
remove the old belt. As a laﬆ resort,
check the shop manual.
Most cars provide a common
-in.-sq hole in the tensioner’s arm
to release the tensioner. Simply use a
ratchet to loosen the belt, and unthread
it from the pulleys.
Inspe the belt for damage. Cracks
across the ribs are the moﬆ common
indication of a belt that’s simply at the
end of its life span. Little rubber bands
of rib, tus of ﬁberglass reinforcing belt
or disintegrating belt edges are indica-
tions of a problem with the pulleys,
idlers or tensioners. A high-mileage belt
that’s juﬆ looking worn can simply be
replaced. If there are other indications
of damage from misalignment, get out
the straightedge and make note of
what isn’t square.
A bent accessory-mounting bracket
can make a pulley crooked, and you’ll
need to realign it. A ﬆeel bracket could
be bent back into place, but a couple of
shim washers might be a better option.
If you’re replacing a belt because of a
fried alternator or seized a/c compres-
sor, don’t assume the new accessory or
bracket will run true either.
Check the tensioner. The pulley
should freewheel smoothly. e spring
should have an appropriate amount
of tension (which you can check with
a belt tension gauge once the belt is
inﬆalled), and there should be no fric-
tion in the pivot. Tensioner assemblies
are usually not very expensive. Ditto
Torque the new 
tensioner to the 
speciﬁed degree 
of tightness. Yes, 
that means with 
a torque wrench, 
not your carefully 
calibrated elbow.

the body of the 
tensioner should 
fall between the 
high- and low-
tension marks 
when the new 
belt is inﬆalled.

Moisture isn’t supposed to be
able to inﬁltrate most underhood
electrical connections, but some-
times it does. Could be a bad seal, a
cracked connector body or a missing
O-ring. Dirt can worm its way in as
well. Examine the connector closely
for issues. Clean the contacts with
aerosol contact cleaner, then fill the
cavity with dielectric grease. Yes, I

sidewall, except in an I-have-to-get-
home emergency. Here’s why:
Ũ The ribbed inside surface of the
tubeless tire is not finished to
accept a tube. Tube-type tires have
smoother surfaces, without any
outﬆanding ribs or texture to wear
out that tube prematurely.
Ũ e tube will make the sidewall of
the tire ﬆiﬀer. Aside from the poor
ride, this will alter the handling char-
aeriﬆics of the vehicle. A rear tire
ﬆiﬀened by a tube may well cause
overﬆeer, pitching you and your fam-
ily off into the weeds. Ditto for a
front tire, which could underﬆeer oﬀ
the road.
Ũ A tubeless tire wearing a tube will
run substantially hotter when it’s
driven at high speeds, potentially hot
enough to fail—certainly hot enough
to shorten the life span of both the
tube and tire.
Also, I don’t ﬁnd the use of a tube
to be an adequate ﬁx for a lazy tire
technician not having properly cleaned
the bead-seat surface of the rim before
mounting a tire.
Idle oughts
I le the van running by miﬆake for
12 hours while it was parked. Will 
this hurt my vehicle? It drove ﬁne 
aerwards, but I didn’t know if 
letting a vehicle idle for that long 
could cause damage.
In a perfe world, cars would not idle,
ever. Idling serves no purpose. Okay,
I’ll make one exception to that: If it’s
really cold out and you need to warm

will prevent moisture from getting to
the bare metal, and keep nonconduc-
tive oxides from building up. One side
benefit is that the connector will be
less likely to stick and become diffi-
cult to open years down the road.
Nonetheless, once the corrosion is
bad enough to dissolve the conduc-
tive plating from the springy steel or
brass contacts, you’ll just have to
remove the electrical contacts
crimped onto the wires and replace
them with fresh ones.
Faulty Logic
A few months ago you described how
to repair a leaky rim. I think it’s easier 
to ﬁx porous rims by juﬆ inﬆalling a 
tube. is also helps seal rims that 
aren’t cleaned up at the bead surface 
before they’re mounted.

up the vehicle to clear the windows of
condensation so it’s safe to drive,
then ﬁne, let it idle. Extended idling is
hard on camshas and liers, harder
than running near redline. In fact,
some hybrids rarely idle. Even when
the engine is turning and the vehicle is
not moving, the engine is loaded
down by the alternator, producing cur-
rent to charge the batteries and, ulti-
mately, save gas. Moﬆ hybrids shut
the engine off at traffic lights to
reduce the proportion of time spent
at idle, saving fuel.
Ah, but about your van: It’s fine.
Modern cars don’t overheat at idle,
and the things that wear out, wear out
slowly. It’s common praice in very
cold climates to let diesel engines
(which consume very little fuel at idle)
run all night long if they’re going to be
hard to ﬆart the next day. And police
cars often spend many hours idling
when parked at roadside accident
scenes in order to power all those
ﬂashing lights.
Mind Your Manners
My 2003 Toyota Camry XLE makes
a gurgling sound under the 
dashboard when I slow down or 
accelerate. (It’s easier to hear upon 
deceleration because the engine is 
quieter.) Any ideas before I go 
ahead and dig into a possibly long 
adventure under the dashboard? 
e sound laﬆs 5 seconds, and my 
wife (it’s her car) says it goes away 
once the car is warmed up.
It’s probably air in the heater core.
Usually, this air will eventually work its
way into the overﬂow, so I’d ﬆart by
making sure there’s enough coolant
in the system. Some vehicles have
cooling syﬆems with air-bleed valves
that muﬆ be purged when the syﬆem
is ﬁlled—but your Camry doesn’t. I’d
also check the pressure cap to be
sure it’s properly venting coolant to
the overﬂow tank and allowing cool-
ant to return to the radiator as the
syﬆem cools oﬀ.
Do this by waiting for the car to
cool off and removing the radiator
power. So a 1500-watt inverter should
be able to run one with no problem,
although I’d look to use one rated for
at leaﬆ 2000 watts, to have a little
headroom. So we’ll need to draw
roughly 1500 watts from the car’s
elerical syﬆem to run the heater and
make up for losses in the inverter
(which is not 100 percent eﬃcient).
At a nominal 13.5 volts, the normal
voltage in a car elerical syﬆem, we’ll

It was a terriﬁc paint job, home 
from the spray booth so recently 
that you could ﬆill smell the 
enamel reducer in the garage. I 
always like to see vintage cars, 
in this case a ’62 Dart, well-
reﬆored by their owners, so 
when the proud father showed 
it to me, I could only hand out 
compliments on his bodywork.
He called me back to his 
house a few months later, 
complaining that the paint shop 
hadn’t properly prepped before 
spraying it, spawning a half-
dozen dime-size bliﬆers in the 
paint. I popped one with my 
thumbnail, and water trickled 
down the fender. e problem 
wasn’t the respray—it was his 
bodywork. Slapping body ﬁller 
over a ruﬆy panel can’t keep 
water from seeping into pinholes 
and liing the paint from behind.

pressure cap. If your car has a pressur-
ized overﬂow reservoir, this cap will
be on the reservoir and there will be a
smaller cap on the radiator itself.
If the reservoir is unpressurized, the
pressure cap will be on the radiator.
Remove the cap on the radiator regard-
less. e radiator should be full to the
brim. If not, check for a bad cap, a leaky
hose between the reservoir and radia-
tor, a damaged radiator ﬁller neck or a
cracked tank.
Ruﬆ Never Sleeps
Aside from Saturn, who else
among the big car manufaurers 
makes cars with polymer bodies?
Tired of watching your ﬆeel-bodied car
ruﬆ away in front of your very eyes?
ere are a few vehicles on the market
today with nonmetallic body panels,
moﬆly pickup trucks with plaﬆic beds
and the odd boutique car. GM ﬆopped
making its plaﬆic-bodied duﬆ-buﬆer
minivans a few years back. Saturn is
turning away from plaﬆic as well. at
leaves only Corvette (and Cadillac XLR,
based on the Vette frame and suspen-
sion). Sounds like a good alternative to
a ruﬆed-out Cutlass to me. Otherwise,
plaﬆic body panels are used moﬆly for
front and rear fascia and bumpers.
Power to the People
Ice and snow ﬆorms leave
thousands without elerical 
power, running around trying to 
ﬁnd 110-volt generators. I was 
wondering if a 12- to 110-volt 
inverter would be suﬃcient to  
run a heater of 12 amps at 110  
volts, or how to size one that 
won’t cause damage to a car’s 
elerical syﬆem.
Most automotive electrical systems
should be able to handle a few amps
of extra draw in an emergency. Speciﬁ-
cally, the 12 amps you mention sounds
suspiciously like the exact current
draw of a 110-volt electric space
heater, which draws way more than a
few amps. Let’s do the math.
Your heater draws 12 amps at 110
volts, for a total of 1320 watts of

need to deliver (gulp!) 111 amps to the 
input of the inverter. The alternator 
almoﬆ certainly won’t make the 10 to 
20 amps it needs to run the ignition, 
injeion and fuel pump and also  supply 
this massive amount of current, espe-
cially at idle. Many vehicles have only 
60-amp alternators. Some vehicles 
may have alternators rated at over 
100 amps, but they aren’t 
intended to operate there 
for long periods of time. I’ll 
juﬆ mention in passing that 
the wiring between the bat-
tery and the inverter will 
have to be the size of your 
little finger to carry that 
much current. Also, you’d 
need to spin the engine at 
well above idle to do this, 
and that will require some 
mechanical means of rac-
ing the engine. A casual 
nickel inserted into the 
throttle ﬆop won’t cut it. 
Bottom line: You can 
easily suck a few hundred 
watts of power off the 
car’s electrical system to 
run a couple of lights or 
maybe a small TV set, but 
running anything of sub-
stance—like a heater—is 
going to require a genera-
tor designed for the task. 
What’s at Smell
I recently replaced the 
radiator in my 1989 
Firebird Trans Am. When  
I turn on the heater or 
defroﬆer I get a faint 
smell of antifreeze. It’s a 
terrible odor, so I don’t 
even turn the heat on 
anymore. What’s the problem with 
my cooling syﬆem?
I want to know why you needed to 
replace the radiator. Aually, I don’t. 
at unmiﬆakable maple-syrup-and-
Turkish-bath smell waing out of your 
heater is almoﬆ certainly from a leaky 
heater core, corroded by the same 
negleed coolant that dissolved your 
radiator from the inside out in the ﬁrﬆ 
place. You might try to ﬆaunch the 
ﬂow by pouring some ﬆop-leak into the 
radiator—but that’s a temporary ﬁx at 
beﬆ. Sooner or later (probably sooner) 
you’ll need to replace the heater core. 
But know that this is a big job—the 
core is buried, deep inside the plenum 
under the dash.

faster and more reliably and even
unlock a few surprising features. And
you can do it all in under 30 minutes.
Picking a Router
There are dozens of routers on the
market, and telling them apart can be
diﬃcult. If you want to get the moﬆ
out of your device, look for one that
has USB jacks (not all do), is able to
handle Network-Attached Storage
(NAS) devices (which basically are hard
drives accessible to any computer on
the network) and works as an iTunes
server (so you can stream songs
throughout the house). The fastest
routers are 802.11n-compatible.
ese routers can broadcaﬆ over 100
megabytes per second—about twice
the maximum output of the older
802.11g routers. Although not every
computer can take advantage of these
high speeds, moﬆ new ones can.
And if, like me, you intend to ﬆream
high-definition movies around the
house, look for a dual-band router that
simultaneously broadcasts both
2.4-GHz and 5-GHz frequencies. e
2.4-GHz band is also used by devices
such as microwaves and Bluetooth
headsets, so it is prone to interference.
at makes the less crowded 5-GHz
band a better choice for data-intense
applications such as HD ﬆreaming.
Basic Setup
For a router to work, it muﬆ receive a
conneion from a modem. So, here’s
the ﬁrﬆ ﬆep: Plug it in. Firﬆ to a wall
outlet, and then to your modem (by
plugging an Ethernet cord into the
router’s Internet jack).
at’s dead simple, right? Unfortu-
nately, many people ﬆop right there—
leaving their network exposed to
hackers, and missing out on many of a
router’s most powerful features. So
the next ﬆep should be to log into your
router’s control panel. is is essen-
tially a Web page that is only viewable
on computers that are conneed to
your router, serving as a home base for
all of the device’s settings.
To get into the control panel, type
the router’s IP address into the
address bar in your Web browser. Out
of the box, the default IP address of
moﬆ routers is either “192.168.1.1”
Security
Whenever I run into an open wireless
network, I have a sense of accomplish-
ment—I like the feeling of getting
something for nothing. But this exu-
berance is somewhat muted by the
knowledge that whoever le the net-
work open to me also le it open to
hackers. (For a skilled hacker, it’s only
a short jump between logging onto a
network and intercepting personal
data from it.) ere are other problems
with leaving your network open, too—
ﬆrangers can log in and use up your
bandwidth, and if somebody uses the
network for anything illegal, you could
be left liable. My point: Password-
prote your network.
Sele your router’s security proto-
col. is setting can be found on a
control-panel page called Wireless
Security. Wireless networks use two
types of security protocols: Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or Wi-Fi
Proteed Access (WPA). Of the two,
WEP is older, more vulnerable to
hackers and harder to set up. So if
your router gives you the option
or “192.168.0.1.” If those don’t work,
your router’s exact address can be
found by looking in the manual or on
the manufaurer’s Web site. When
you try to access the control panel,
you will be asked for a password. By
default this is usually “admin” or
merely blank. No luck? Once again,
the right information can be found in
the router’s manual or on the manu-
facturer’s Web site. Once you’ve
logged in to the control panel, you can
ﬆart having some fun.
Changing the Network Name
e ﬁrﬆ ﬆep is to simply give your
network a unique name. is isn’t juﬆ
for fun—it can also help ward off
hackers. A network’s default name
often includes the name of the
router’s manufaurer (“linksys” may
be the single moﬆ common network
name), and if hackers know this infor-
mation, it can be easier for them to
sneak into a system. To rename it,
look for a setting called Service Set
Identifier, or SSID—and be creative
and unprediable.

a password. This can be 
done on your control pan-
el’s Wireless Settings page. 
Unlike other passwords 
(see page 120), there’s no 
real downside to saving 
this information in your 
computer, so you don’t 
need to pick one that’s 
easy to remember. This 
gives you the freedom to 
make it as long and unpre-
diable as possible. Also, 
write the password down 
and tape it to the bottom 
of your router. (If you hap-
pen to lose the password 
and get locked out of your 
network—it’s happened to 
us all—pressing the hard 
reset button on your router 
will cause it to revert to its 
faory settings and allow 
you to regain entry.)
Now you’ve secured the 
network, but someone 
could still get into the 
 router’s control panel and 
undo your security.  Routers 
typically use one of a few 
default passwords for 
control- panel access, so it’s 
important to set a new one. 
This can be done in the 
 Router Password setting in 
the control panel. Don’t pick 
the same password that 
you use to log on to your 
network —doing so will 
make it easier for  hackers 
to cause trouble. Again, 
write the password down 
and tape it to your router.
Updating Firmware 
Like most electronic gad-
gets and gizmos, a router 
relies on internal soware 
called ﬁrmware. But tech-
nology moves faﬆ, and by 
the time you take your 
router home and set it up, 
its ﬁrmware could already 
be out of date. Not only 
does upgrading to the  lateﬆ 

P M  D I Y  T E C H  /// R O U T E R S
same priorities. See that control-
panel setting called either Access 
Control or Schedule? It allows you 
to limit when people can log on—
meaning you can shut your network 
oﬀ at night if your kids are choosing 
surﬁng over sleeping and ﬆudying.
You might also want to limit 
how much bandwidth your com-
puter is sucking up. is can be use-
ful if, for example, your massive 
downloads are preventing your 
Netflix- streaming Xbox360 from 
delivering smooth  video—yes, I 
learned this the hard way. is can 
be done through a setting that is 
usually called rottling.
Changing the DNS
When you go to a Web site, you 
typically see the domain as a word 
(such as popularmechanics.com). 
But in order to access the site, your 
computer muﬆ ﬁrﬆ translate the 
words into a numerical IP address, 
such as 12.44.22.1. is task is usu-
ally done by your Internet Service 
Provider’s Domain Name Server (or 
DNS), and it doesn’t happen 
inﬆantly—the process can notice-
ably slow down your Web surﬁng. 
Switching your router from your 
provider’s DNS to another one can 
speed things up. I like OpenDNS, 
which keeps a large database of IP 
addresses that it can inﬆantly sum-
mon, allowing pages to load faﬆer.
To use OpenDNS, go to opendns 
.com and follow the setup process. 
You don’t need to download any 
soware—juﬆ enter some informa-
tion about your router. Alterna-
tively, you can perform the same 
task from your router’s control 
panel—go to the DNS Settings tab 
and enter 208.67.222.222 and 
208.67.220.220 in the two slots. 
Your Web browsing will now go 
faﬆer. As a bonus, the free service 
will automatically corre typos—it 
knows that popularmechaniccs 
.com really should read popular 
mechanics.com and will send you 
to the right place.  
FC
version ensure you have the best 
possible protection against bugs 
and security holes, but it could also  
add new features, and even increase 
the speed of your data conneion.
To update your ﬁrmware, down-
load the latest version from the 
manufaurer’s Web site. en, go 
to the  Firmware setting in the con-
trol panel and upload the ﬁle. e 
router will reboot itself with the new 
ﬁrmware inﬆalled.
Streaming Music and Printing
If you’re anything like me, your digital 
music colleion is scattered across 
multiple computers. Turning on your 
router’s iTunes server feature allows 
you to stream songs to any com-
puter hooked up to your network. 
e beﬆ way to do this is to conne 
a NAS device to one of the router’s 
USB jacks. 
Aer your device is plugged in, 
any computer logged on to your 
network can access it as if it were 
an external hard drive. Create a 
music folder on the NAS device and 
drag your entire music library into it. 
en, go into your router’s control 
 panel and look for a setting called 
iTunes Server. Switch this setting 
on. Your music library should now 
pop up in iTunes on any computer 
hooked up to the network.
Turning your router into a print 
server is an equally useful trick—it 
allows multiple computers to wire-
lessly share a single printer. Firﬆ, 
plug your printer into your router’s 
USB port. You’ll need to make sure 
the printer’s driver is inﬆalled on 
every computer on the network, so 
download the latest one off the 
manufaurer’s Web site. en, go 
into the Printer setting on each 
computer’s control panel and set 
up the router-conneed printer.

What’s your
favorite book?
Password-retrieval 
“security queﬆions” 
can serve as a hacker-
friendly back door into 
your Web mail.
e answers to these 
queﬆions can oen be 
found by searching in 
Google or looking at 
your Facebook proﬁle. 
To ward oﬀ would-be 
snoopers, give false 
answers. If given the 
option, make up your own, 
less obvious queﬆion.
Securing Web Mail
Q
I rely on Web-based e-mail, but am worried about how secure
these services are. Is there anything I can do to protect my 
mail against hackers and digital snoopers?
A
It’s easy to understand the appeal of Web-based e-mail services such as
Gmail, Windows Live Hotmail and Yahoo Mail. ey are free, oﬀer several
gigabytes of storage and are accessible from virtually any computer or smart-
phone with a link to the Web. And nearly everybody uses them. But in order to
enjoy them, users must take a leap of faith. Aer all, the services store mail on
distant servers, and the fact that you can access your account anytime and
anywhere means that somebody else potentially could as well—as headlines
reminded us last September, when vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s
Yahoo Mail account was hacked. What’s more, if your account does become
compromised or you lose your password, it can be nearly impossible to get a
tech-support agent on the phone—a shortcoming that is to be expected from any
free service that is used by millions of people. So Web-mail users need to be
especially careful when it comes to their cyber security. Here’s how.
Picking a Password
Your password is your ﬁrﬆ and only
line of defense againﬆ snoopers, so
you’d better make it a good one. at
means avoiding any words that can be
found in a diionary. One hacker tech-
nique involves using programs that
automatically try every word in the dic-
tionary as a potential password. is is
why the beﬆ passwords utilize a mix
of letters (preferably both upper and
lower case), numbers and symbols (if
your service allows them). As diﬃcult
as it is to remember a dozen diﬀerent
passwords, resiﬆ the temptation to
use the same password for e-mail that
you do for other programs—all it would
take is one hacked account to wreak
immeasurable havoc on your life. To
make remembering multiple pass-
words easier, try to ﬁnd a way to incor-
porate the name (or ﬁrﬆ few letters) of
a site or service into the password.
Juﬆ make sure it is not done in a way
that would be obvious to somebody
who might ﬆumble upon your pass-
word. For example, maybe make the
fourth letter of your password the
same as the laﬆ letter of the Web site
you are using.
Securing Your Queﬆions
Although security queﬆions aren’t as
obvious as they once were (mostly
gone are the days of “What’s your
Digital Clinic

mother’s maiden name?”), queﬆions 
such as “What is the name of your 
favorite book?” (currently oﬀered by 
Yahoo Mail) can still be cracked by 
somebody with initiative and an Inter-
net conneion. e answer may even 
be in your Facebook proﬁle. And if you 
happen to be a high-proﬁle personality, 
the answers are oen little more than 
a Google or Wikipedia search away 
(this is how the hacker broke into 
Sarah Palin’s account). at’s why you 
should never, ever, answer these ques-
tions truthfully. And if you can, write 
your own security queﬆion (moﬆ of 
the free Web-mail services give you 
this option), and make sure it’s some-
thing that can’t be found by looking at 
your high school yearbook.
Raising the Security Level
Of the three moﬆ popular Web mail 
services, Gmail has the beﬆ security —
it’s the only one that gives you the 
option to encrypt all of your mail using 
a ﬆandard called Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol Secure (or https). However, 
this encryption, which makes it diﬃcult 
for digital snoopers to intercept your 
messages from open Wi-Fi hotspots, 
is turned oﬀ by default. To switch it on, 
click Settings on the top of your Gmail 
page. On the General tab, scroll down 
to where it says “Browser conneion” 
and sele “Always use https.” Alterna-
tively, you can juﬆ type “https://www 
.gmail.com” (notice the “s”) into your 
address bar to bring up a secure ver-
sion of the site. is encryption may 
cause Gmail to load a bit slower, but it 
is worth it, especially if you are using a 
public hotspot.
Hotmail and Yahoo Mail also oﬀer 
https encryption, but only for the user 
name and password in your log-in 
page —your aual messages are ﬆill 
vulnerable. In Yahoo Mail, this setting 
is always on. For Hotmail, you can turn 
it on by clicking the button that says 
“Use enhanced security” below where 
you enter your password.
If security is a serious concern for 
you, consider using the Hushmail Web-
mail service, which uses more 
advanced encryption. The service’s 
free accounts limit you to juﬆ 2 MB of 
ﬆorage, with larger (and more useful) 
accounts coﬆing about $35 per year.
and when it regiﬆers on the screen. 
What’s going on here? 
Moﬆ high-deﬁnition TVs (with CRT TVs 
being a notable exception) have a ﬁxed 
resolution—that is, they always display 
the same number of pixels, no matter 
what source they are outputting from. 
Of course, not every DVD, video game 
and TV channel matches this so-called 
native resolution, which means TVs 
sometimes have to convert video to 
the proper resolution before it can be 
displayed. Older game 
syﬆems, such as the 
PlayStation 2, have a 
native resolution of 
480i for moﬆ games. 
Because this matches 
the native resolution 
of a standard-defini-
tion TV, it works per-
fectly. But because 
HDTVs typically have 
native resolutions of 
720p or higher, they 
muﬆ convert the out-
put before they can 
show it. is process 
is quick, but it is not 
inﬆant, and you may 
notice a lag—particu-
larly with games such 
as Guitar Hero that 
rely on split-second 
timing. 
Video-game devel-
opers have begun to recognize this 
problem and have taken ﬆeps to ﬁx it. 
Most PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 
games allow gamers to choose the out-
put resolution that matches their TV. 
ese syﬆems will also output Play-
Station 2 and original Xbox games at 
the resolution of your choice. And while 
there are some additional ﬆeps you 
can take to diminish this problem—try 
setting the TV to Game Mode (if it has 
one) to speed up the scaling— the beﬆ 
solution may be to pull the old tube TV 
out of the  closet. 
FC
One laﬆ point: Web-mail services 
can keep users logged in for a very long 
time after you quit the browser.  
Sometimes weeks. So make absolutely 
sure you log out of your e-mail when 
you are done —especially if you are 
using a public or shared computer.  
To be sure you are logged out, browse 
back to your Web-mail log-in page.  
And even though moﬆ Web browsers 
allow you to store your user name  
and password in a “keychain” that 
automatically inserts 
them when you return 
to the site, be wary of 
this. Even if you are 
the only person who 
uses your computer, 
laptops can get lost 
or ﬆolen—and if that 
happens your log-in 
info will go with it.
Broadcaﬆ 
TiVo
I recently canceled 
my cable. Can I ﬆill 
use TiVo to save 
over-the-air 
television? 
You sure can, but, 
thanks to the coun-
try’s coming conver-
sion to digital TV, 
owners of older TiVos 
will need some addi-
tional hardware. If you’ve got a newer 
Series3 TiVo, all you’ll need to record 
live broadcaﬆs— including over-the-air 
high-definition channels —is an 
 antenna. If you have an older Series2 
TiVo, you’ll also need an external digi-
tal recorder box (the same sort older 
TVs will need to receive over-the-air 
broadcaﬆs aer the digital TV transi-
tion), and you won’t be able to record 
in HD. Either way, juﬆ because you are 
living without cable doesn’t mean you 
need to live without the convenience 
of a decent DVR. 
Playing  
Catch-Up
I have a PlayStation 2. It works ﬁne 
through a ﬆandard-deﬁnition TV. 
However, when I play it through an 
HDTV, there appears to be a small 
lag between when I press a button 
(a new ﬆandard for 
wireless high-deﬁnition)
Nobody likes cables. 
at’s why TV manufac-
turers are looking to 
build TVs that can 
receive high-deﬁnition 
video from computers 
and cable boxes without 
using wires. In an 
attempt to ﬆave oﬀ a 
wireless HD format war, 
major TV makers such 
as Sony, Samsung, LG 
and Sharp have lined up 
behind one ﬆandard: 
Wireless Home Digital 
Interface, or WHDI, and 
are looking to build it 
into TVs this year. WHDI 
can ﬆream data at 3 GB 
per second—more than 
enough for 1080p video.

e happieﬆ two days of Jeﬀ White’s life were when the parts 
to build his 40- lobﬆer boat arrived at his house—and when 
they ﬁnally le as a completed cra seven months later. e independent ﬁsherman  
ﬁlls traps with lobﬆers and gillnets with ground ﬁsh such as pollock, cod or monkﬁsh. Now  
38 years old, he began ﬁshing as a child with his father and took to the water alone at 13, 
fetching lobﬆer traps during the summer. White and his one-man crew are on the water 
each day from 5 am to midaernoon, as far as 15 miles from shore. “Fundamentally, it’s a 
hunter–gatherer thing,” he says. “You can’t do this if you don’t love it.” — ALLIE TOWNSEND
1. Boat  White built the  
Jacquie Andi Nicole (named 
for his three daughters)  
in his driveway in 2004. It 
has a 40 x 15– ﬁberglass 
hull and is powered by a John 
Deere 235-hp six- cylinder 
diesel engine. 
2. Lobster Trap  In the 
spring and summer White 
uses a “pair”—two 13 x 21 x 
48–in. traps attached to one 
buoy—to colle his lobﬆer 
haul. e traps are usually set 
about 60  apart, baited with 
salted herring and checked 
once a week. To colle 
ground ﬁsh, which live on the 
ocean ﬂoor, White uses two 
6.5-in. ﬆand-up gillnets made 
of diamond-shaped mesh. 
3. Hydraulic Haulers   
Two hydraulic haulers hoiﬆ the 
lobﬆer traps and nets ﬁlled 
with ﬁsh from the water to the 
boat’s deck. Traps are lied 
from the ﬆarboard side and 
the gillnets are lied from port.
4. Plotter  White uses two 
GPS-driven plotters, a Simrad 
and a Si-Tex, as guides while 
ﬁshing. e units use elec-
tronic charts to dete rocks 
and shoals, sounding an alarm 
if the boat gets too close. 
5. Underwater Surveil-
lance (inside cabin) White 
uses radar with a 48-mile 
range and a 10-in. video screen 
to look for other boats and 
buoys. A 10-in. video sounder 
helps him predi where the 
ﬁsh will be. Still, “It only  
shows where they’ve been, 
not where they’re going,” he 
says. “It’s not an ATM card. 
You don’t get something out 
every time you use it.”
