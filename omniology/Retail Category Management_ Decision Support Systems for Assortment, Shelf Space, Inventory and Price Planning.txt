Foreword
Retail shelf management forms the part of the supply chain that interfaces between
the ultimate customer need and the rest of the supply chain. As such, it is regarded
as the part of the supply chain where the consumer demand shows up. Matching
consumer demand with supply is the core task of retailers and a key lever for
increasing efﬁciency. Consumers demand high product availability at low prices,
while retailers are ever expanding their product variety.
That is why it is not surprising that retail category management topics are gaining
increasing attention – from practice and research – especially as the introduction
of consumer goods launches increases year by year. The product proliferation is
constrained by the limited store space and requires therefore an efﬁcient decision
making by the retailers about which products to offer and how to allocate the
scare resource of shelf space. Assortment and shelf space optimization is one of
the most important and difﬁcult decisions that retailer managers have to face, as
it needs to reﬂect consumer behavior such as substitutions, product recognition,
or price sensitivity, as well as inventory, replenishment, and operational costs.
Research on category management therefore intersects with research in assortment
planning, inventory management, and consumer pricing. Integrating shelf space
management with assortment planning and coordinating price optimization with
logistics management are the core contributions of this book.
This is the ﬁrst research contribution that develops shelf space management
models that integrate comprehensively consumer behavior and logistical effects and
analyzes under which conditions these inﬂuence the decisions and allow to improve
the planning results. The book shows that not only market-related aspects but also
logistical questions are impacted, if, for example, expensive shelf reﬁll processes
are required. Speciﬁcally, the dissertation develops operational methodologies for
selecting optimal retail assortments, allocating it to the shelves and assigning
inventory and price levels. Innovative optimization models are formulated that
reﬂect operational constraints of shelf replenishment and are capable to solve
practical relevant problem sizes.

Foreword
The developed models and approaches are to be regarded as important steps
toward the improvement of planning practice. I am sure that the readers will gain
insights into category planning and discover a substantial addition to the emerging
literature on shelf space management.

Executive Summary
Retail shelf management means cost-efﬁciently matching retail operations with
consumer demand. As consumers expect high product availability and low prices,
and retailers are constantly increasing product variety and striving towards high
service levels, the complexity of managing retail business and its operations is
rocketing. Consumers demand literally meets the retailers offering at the point of
sales – at the shelf. Retailers need to match consumer demand with shelf supply
by balancing variety (number of products), service levels (number of items of a
product), and optimizing demand and proﬁt via carefully calibrated prices. As a
result the core strategic decisions a retailer must take involve assortment sizes
(listing), shelf space management (facing), replenishing and pricing. For example,
offering broader assortments may limit the appropriate service levels and vice
versa. Lower item prices result in a lower proﬁt contribution per item sold, but
increase demand, which needs to be fulﬁlled appropriately. Common practice in
retail is to make decisions about the planning problems sequentially: Retailers ﬁrst
determine the assortment size, next allocate it to the shelves, assign prices, and
then ﬁnally make arrangements for instore shelf replenishment. However, as the
problems are interrelated, managing these operations in isolation may result in
suboptimal decisions if communication ﬂows are omitted. The focus is consequently
on integrated shelf space management models reﬂecting these interrelated issues.
The contribution of this dissertation is to develop rigor and comprehensive
decision models for shelf space management and its subproblems of listing, facing
and pricing of products. The proﬁt maximization models address the assort-
ment, space allocation, replenishment and pricing decisions for a set of products.
Assortment planning deals with the listing decision to determine which products
should be included in the assortment based on substitution effects. Shelf space
management addresses the space assignment for individual products (facing) based
on space-elasticity effects and restocking frequencies and costs (replenishing).
Finally, pricing utilizes price-elasticity effects to steer consumer demand. Key
assumptions of the models include retailer perspective, mid-term planning horizons,
deterministic demand and efﬁcient replenishment systems to avoid stock outs.

Executive Summary
A comprehensive framework for retail demand and supply chain planning
is provided to put these models into a broader context. The planning matrix
structures and identiﬁes long-term to short-term planning problems in the domains
of procurement, warehousing, distribution and sales. The recent past has witnessed
exciting new research – both theoretical and applied – aimed at addressing retail
shelf space management problems. This dissertation therefore also summarizes
state-of-the-art empirical insights, quantitative models and software applications for
shelf space management.

Outline
The objective of this thesis is to analyze and develop decision support systems
for retail shelf space management. To provide the context, a comprehensive retail
operations planning framework is developed for retail demand and supply chain
planning. A review of empirical insights, quantitative decision support systems
and commercial software applications indicate the need for more advanced models
reﬂecting category managers’ actual decision problems. The focus of this research
is therefore to examine retail shelf space problems and develop decision support
systems, that support assortment planning (which products to offer?), shelf space
planning (how much space to allocate to products?), inventory planning (how to
align restocking requirements?) and price planning (which price to assign to each
product?) to maximize the proﬁtability of a retail grocery category.
This introductory chapter speciﬁes the background and motivation (1.1), derives
the research objectives (1.2) and contribution to the state of research (1.3), followed
by an overview of the individual chapters (1.4).
1.1
Background and Motivation
Matching consumer demand with retail shelf supply is a key lever for increasing
efﬁciency in the retail industry. Consumers are demanding better service levels
and prices, while retailers respond with increasing product variety, becoming more
price competitive and striving towards higher service levels. These developments
have greatly increased pressure on margins and the complexity of managing retail
shelf space, which may be one of the scarcest and most strategically valuable
operational resources. The category manager’s objective is how best to organize
product assortments and merchandizing plans to generate greater proﬁt contribution
from their existing, limited shelf space, especially as the increasing product variety
is in conﬂict with limited shelf space.

the number of facings for one product limits the space available to other products,
and may require the delisting of other products. This means also that latent consumer
demand of the delisted products cannot be directly satisﬁed, and consumers may
switch to other products or outlets. The demand side and the supply side therefore
need to be aligned. For example, marketing activities such as price adjustments
increase or lower demand, and overall supply and product availability can be
inﬂuenced by adjusting replenishment frequency.
Empirical studies demonstrate the beneﬁt of comprehensive shelf space man-
agement. McIntyre and Miller (1999), Hennessy (2001), Basuroy et al. (2001),
Dhar et al. (2001), Shugan and Desiraju (2001), ECR Europe (2003a), Levy et al.
(2004), Grocery Manufacturers Association et al. (2005), Desrochers and Nelson
(2006), Campillo-Lundbeck (2009) and Fisher and Raman (2010) empirically show
that well-executed shelf space management has positive proﬁt implications in
terms of an efﬁcient consumer response, and the subsequent emphasis on category
management. Several trends have made the issue of an efﬁcient shelf management
system to one of the most critical marketing and operational decisions (Levy et al.
2004; Hall et al. 2010). German retailers and consumer goods producers recently
rated the “optimization of product portfolio and category management” as the
most important task for achieving performance goals according to a survey of
McKinsey & Company (Breuer et al. 2009). This is not surprising as shelf space
competition in retail stores is at an all-time high, driven by the competitive need
to constantly introduce new products. Since the 1990s, there has been signiﬁcant
product proliferation. The average number of items in overall store assortments
increased by 20% between 1970 and 1980, and by 75% between 1980 and 1990
(Greenhouse July 17, 2005). In confectionery, for example, the number of brands
rose by more than 40% between 1997 and 2001, but overall volume sales by only
0.8% (Carlotti et al. 2006). Additionally, most retailers suffer from decreasing
space productivity. Gutgeld et al. (2009) concluded that 19 out of 24 European
retailers were unable to maintain their space productivity. Retailers are under
signiﬁcant pressure to improve their operational efﬁciency and offer competitive
prices. Furthermore, as shoppers increasingly take their purchase decisions instore,
retail marketers are diverting a growing proportion of their marketing budgets from
traditional out-of-store media advertising to instore marketing (Xin et al. 2009;
Chandon et al. 2009). Consequently, it is becoming extremely important for retailers
how they manage their shelf space.
A key imperative to achieving proﬁtable shelf space arrangements also depends
on category managers’ access to efﬁcient decision support systems to manage their
shelf space. The traditional shelf space management tool employed by retailers is a
planogram. Software applications generate without time-consuming computations
shelf layout recommendations based on simplistic “rules of thumb” like allocating
space proportional to sales. However, as Lim et al. (2004) point out, “due to the
problem’s complexity, only relatively simple heuristic rules have been developed
and are available for retailers to plan product-to-shelf allocation (Zufryden 1986;
Yang 2001) (...) These are not effective global optimization tools (Desmet and
Renaudin 1998) and are largely used for planogram accounting to reduce time spent
on manual manipulation of shelves (Dr`eze et al. 1994; Yang 2001)” (see also Irion

Their main purpose is the simulation of alternative item placements on-screen and
the related proﬁt analyses. Kopalle (2010) notes that “substantial” sales could be lost
by retailers who rely on such simple heuristic rule-based decision support systems.
1.2
Objectives of this Research
The objective of this thesis is to develop effective and efﬁcient decision support
systems for retail shelf space management. An efﬁcient model needs to reﬂect
merchandise variables that impact consumer demand and logistical components of
shelf replenishment of fast-moving consumer goods. Fast-moving consumer goods
are products that are sold quickly, replenished regularly and sold at relatively low
cost with higher price sensitivity.
In demand and supply chain management, analytical methods are emerging as
promising solutions to many of these planning problems (Agrawal and Smith 2009b;
Fisher and Raman 2010). An analytics orientation at many retail organizations
provides a great opportunity for modelers and is nudging retail managers towards
more quantitative decision making (Kopalle 2010). However, retail shelf space
practice and research lack a holistic planning architecture that is based on an integral
planning view on retail requirements and constraints (i.e., structuring planning tasks
hierarchically and taking into account operational constraints), integrated consumer
instore behavior (i.e., integrating decision-relevant consumer behavior based on
empirical insights into planning problems), and comprehensive quantitative decision
support (i.e., using decision support systems based on appropriate quantitative
models and proper optimization). Therefore, the research questions targeted in this
work are:
1. How should a comprehensive retail demand and supply chain planning frame-
work be conﬁgured that integrates horizontal and vertical planning interdepen-
dencies?
2. What are state-of-the art empirical insights, quantitative decision support systems
and commercial software applications for shelf space management?
3. How can efﬁcient shelf space management models be developed that reﬂect
category managers decision problems?

The category manager’s shelf space decision problem can be characterized as a
multi-perspective same-time decision problem, where a number of questions need
to be solved jointly: what to list (assortment planning), how much of the products to
put into the shelf (shelf space planning), how often to replenish (inventory planning),
and how other marketing effects such as price can impact demand (price planning).
This thesis will introduce models that integrate some of the most relevant instore
consumer choice and instore logistic effects:
This research contributes to the body of shelf space management literature
by offering a more comprehensive demand and cost analyses. Current publica-
tions solve the interdependent decision by focusing mainly on isolated issues or
abstracting from the category managers actual problems. Shelf space management
literature deals mainly with space effects for additional space, but does not integrate
substitution. One issue is that, the literature on assortment deals mainly with
substitution effects in the case of non-available items, without considering space
effects. Another is that, shelf space management models assume that replenishment
systems are efﬁcient, and do not apply decision-relevant restocking costs. However,
shelf space and restocking planning are interdependent, e.g., low space allocation
requires frequent restocking. Furthermore, demand effects of price adjustments have
not been studied in shelf space management models (Table 1.1).
Despite retail managers striving to follow the mantra “retail is detail,” most retail
managers have little time to consider the details of different category arrangements.
Consequently, the beneﬁts of using shelf space models to supplement human
decision making depend on how efﬁciently and quickly the shelf space models
can run on computers. Researchers have reduced the necessary solution time by
applying specialized heuristic or meta-heuristic search algorithms to the basic
shelf space allocation parameters (Hansen et al. 2010). These methods may be
appropriate as the shelf space allocation problem is in many cases “NP -hard”
(i.e., nondeterministic polynomial-time hard). However, these algorithms do not
guarantee globally optimal objective values.

effects, substitution effects, price effects, as well as inventory holding and
replenishment costs. The shelf space management models are studied as mixed-
integer non-linear problems.
We transfer the problems into mixed-integer knapsack problems, which then
allow the efﬁcient use of standard solvers such as CPLEX. The models are tested
with empirical consumer and retailer data to investigate the viability of the model,
provide practical decision support systems, and demonstrate their superiority over
commonly used industry applications. The numerical examples illustrate the beneﬁt
of an integrated decision model and pave the way for decision making for typical
retail categories, and the implementation of such a model in commercial software
applications.

Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
The second chapter provides the context for retail shelf space planning: It develops
a comprehensive operations planning framework, identiﬁes interdependencies, and
structures demand and supply planning problems. First results have been also
published in the working paper H¨ubner et al. (2010).
Retail demand and supply chain planning means matching cost-efﬁcient con-
sumer demand with retail operations. As consumers are demanding better service
levels and purchase prices, and retailers are increasing their channel formats,
product variants and taking over a growing number of logistics operations from
producers, the complexity of managing retail business and its operations is spiraling.
The contribution of this chapter is therefore to structure retail demand and supply
chain planning tasks holistically from the point of consumption to the point of
production in order to develop new insights for management practice and retail
research. Retail practice and research lack a holistic architecture based on an integral
planning view on the entire retail supply chain. It needs to structure planning
tasks hierarchically along the supply chain and taking into account organizational
interdependencies. Secondly, it also means using comprehensive decision support
systems based on appropriate quantitative models and proper optimization.
This chapter expands supply chain planning with retail speciﬁcs such as con-
sumer interaction and warehousing. A corresponding consumer-backed demand and
supply chain planning architecture is developed to structure the interrelated planning
issues. Planning modules are derived in the domains of procurement, warehousing,
distribution and sales, for long-term conﬁguration, mid-term master planning and
short-term fulﬁllment. The architecture consists of dedicated interrelated planning
modules that decentralize decision making for complexity-related and organiza-
tional reasons. Information ﬂows along planning modules are essential, and the
value of comprehensive quantitative planning methods will be demonstrated.

The analyses show the need to develop retail-tailored analytical models. This will
improve planning quality and generate efﬁciency gains for the entire business. The
study indicates the need for decision models with integrated hierarchical aspects
(e.g., mid-term category management and operative instore fulﬁllment), sequential
planning aspects (e.g., impact of warehouse picking on instore logistics), and the
implementation of these in commercial software packages (Fig. 1.2).
The following chapter therefore provides a more targeted review of empirical
studies, quantitative models and software applications in the ﬁeld of master category
planning.
1.4.2
Empirical Insights, Quantitative Models and Software
Applications for Master Category Planning
Chapter 3 introduces commercial software for shelf space management and reviews
scientiﬁc models of category management, mainly including retail assortment plan-
ning and retail shelf-space allocation. The primary retailer’s objective in category
management is to proﬁtably increase and satisfy consumer demand. Retailers and
researchers are increasingly addressing master category planning with quantitative
models (Kopalle 2010). Empirical studies illustrate the importance of optimizing
the assortment, shelf space allocation and replenishment (e.g, Dr`eze et al. 1994;
Boatwright and Nunes 2001; Gruen et al. 2002; Ketzenberg et al. 2002; Sloot et al.
2005; Koschat 2008; Xin et al. 2009; Chandon et al. 2009).
The rapid development of advanced scientiﬁc models and software applications,
particularly for space management, has created a wide range of decision support
systems in this ﬁeld. Retailers and producers are using software applications to
create assortment and merchandising plans. The popularity of these applications
is mainly due to their simplicity in implementing decisions for a large number
of items and visualizing shelf arrangements. The shelf recommendation is mainly
based on a proportional space allocation rule. A manual and iterative search is then
conducted by repeatedly creating planograms, which does not guarantee that the
optimal solution will be found.
The goal of this chapter is therefore to identify, structure and examine the
decision support systems for assortment planning and shelf space management.
Consistent with previous research, the two areas are deﬁned as follows:
•
Assortment planning: Listing decisions based on consumer choice behavior and
substitution effects.
•
Shelf space planning: Facing and replenishment decisions based on space- and
cross-space elasticity effects, limited shelf space and operational restocking
constraints.
These planning questions are inevitably interdependent. For example, large
assortments drive lower inventory levels of individual items, which reduce the
visibility of those items on the shelves, increase the risk of stock-outs and impose

Gijsbrechts 2005; Mantrala et al. 2009). It will be shown that these planning
problems are not yet sufﬁciently and comprehensively integrated in commercial
software systems and scientiﬁc models.
This chapter analyzes different properties of the various streams in assortment
and shelf space planning (see Table 1.2). We show that retail assortment planning
models neglect to integrate space-elastic demand and partially the constraints of
limited shelf space. Shelf space management streams also omit substitution effects
between items, when products are delisted or out of stock, which is the focus of
consumer choice models in assortment planning.
The challenge for retailers and researchers lies in taking an integrated view when
developing demand-and supply-oriented planning models. There are difﬁculties
commonly involved in the use of commercial software and the implementation
and transfer of scientiﬁc models. Addressing these issues, this chapter provides
a state-of-the-art overview and research framework for integrated assortment and
shelf space planning. A more rigorous quantitative approach to merchandising will
allow the tight alignment of retail shelf supply with consumer demand, leading to
efﬁciency gains and more productive shelf space (see also H¨ubner and Kuhn 2012).
The following three chapters develop shelf space models that contribute to more
comprehensive modeling.
1.4.3
Shelf Space and Assortment Planning
Analyses of empirical consumer behavior studies as well as the scientiﬁc decision
support systems and software applications used up to now indicate the need
for more practical solution methods for shelf space and assortment planning.
Chapter 4 develops a model for integrated shelf space and assortment planning.
This constitutes a basic model for the subsequent chapters, which is also partially
publicated in H¨ubner and Kuhn (2011d).
Additional models follow the emergence of further extensions and the integration
of additional effects and constraints. Chapter 5 extends the basic model by supply-
side considerations and integrating restocking costs, while Chap. 6 extends the
model by demand-side considerations and integrates price optimization into shelf
space management (Table 1.3).

Efﬁciently managing limited retail shelf space is critical as the increase in product
variety is in conﬂict with limited shelf space and operational costs. Chapter 4
presents a multi-product shelf space management problem, where category demand
is a composite function of shelf space allocated and consumer-driven demand
substitution under replenishment constraints. It describes an innovative approach
to solving a core retail planning question involving which products to offer and
how much shelf space to assign items. The objective function is formulated as
follows, with P as the category proﬁt, consisting of total direct proﬁt (TDP), total
substitution proﬁt (TSP) and total costs of listing (TCL).

The TDP function in (1.2) reﬂects space-elastic demand di, depending on the
number of facings ki allocated to item i and the item proﬁt pi. The demand rate
of item i is a deterministic function of its displayed front row inventory level. The
basic demand is denoted by ˛i. In accordance with prior research, the space-demand
relationship ˇi is modeled with elasticity as a power function. bi is the breadth of
an item i. The TSP function in (1.3) reﬂects substitution demand dj.zj D 0/ from
a delisted item j to item i, expressed by the latent demand of the item j and the
substitution probability ji between the items, and with zi as a binary variable set
to 1 when items are included in the assortment. The TCL function in (1.4) applies
listing costs LCi for all listed items.

Traditional shelf space models are extended in three directions. First, the
model takes into account facing-dependent restocking constraints. Second, the
model integrates substitution effects by modeling out-of-assortment substitution
and introducing a zero-space demand estimate. The mixed-integer non-linear
problem is then transformed into a knapsack structure. The model can be used to
solve hard knapsack problems and large problem instances of theoretically entire
stores. The computation tests show that integrating assortment effects into shelf
space management avoids wasting space and frequent restocking situations. This
integrated approach jointly improves product availability and proﬁt, and provides
more accurate results for the underlying consumer behavior. Hence it provides a
practical solution for category-speciﬁc problem sizes.
The model is extended by investigating further shelf-supply aspects and the
impact of inventory management on shelf space management in Chap. 5, while
further shelf-demand aspects and the impact of price management on shelf space
management are examined in Chap.6.
1.4.4
Shelf Space, Assortment and Inventory Planning
Current models for shelf space management assume unlimited shelf replenishment
and ignore restocking costs, e.g., for underfaced items. Chapter 5 therefore extends
the basic model by integrating facing-dependent replenishment and inventory
holding costs. This chapter is partially based on H¨ubner and Kuhn (2011a) and
H¨ubner and Kuhn (2011e).
In addition to the classical supply function, shelf inventory has a demand-
generating function, as more facings lead to increasing consumer demand. An
efﬁcient decision support model therefore needs to reﬂect space-elastic demand and
the logistical components of shelf replenishment. However, shelf space management
models have up to now abstracted from reality by assuming that replenishment
systems are efﬁcient, and that replenishment costs are not decision-relevant. But
shelf space and inventory management are interdependent, e.g., low space allocation
requires frequent restocking. Speciﬁcally, the models do not differentiate the
restocking strategies that retailers frequently use in practice: Scheduled basic group
ﬁlling by merchandizers of products jointly before sales begin, and concurrent
individual product replenishment by sales staff during the sales period.
An extension of shelf space management is therefore provided that additionally
takes into account total costs of overstocked inventory (TCOI) and total costs of
undersupply (TCUS).

Basic constraints are the number of facings, basic supply level and limited shelf
space. A multi-product shelf space and inventory management problem is studied
that integrates facing-dependent inventory holding and replenishment costs. The
non-linear problem is transferred into a knapsack problem that allows fast and
efﬁcient solutions using CPLEX. The numerical examples show the beneﬁts of an
integrated decision model over traditional approaches and commercial planogram
software. Integrating restocking costs aligns facing-dependent demand and cost
implications. This results in optimal assortment and shelf conﬁgurations from
a proﬁt perspective. Sensitivity analyzes are used to additionally compute error
bounds for the parameter estimates. Finally, managerial decisions and constraints
on operational fulﬁllment are analyzed as part of a comprehensive hierarchical retail
planning framework.
1.4.5
Shelf Space, Assortment and Price Planning
The impact of price on demand and overall proﬁt has so far been excluded in
literature on this topic. Chapter 6 now relaxes this assumption and integrates price
variations into the decision calculus. Early results are also in the working paper
H¨ubner and Kuhn (2011b).
Traditional shelf management models allocate shelf space to selected items.
However, they abstract from the category manager’s same-time decision problem
to decide not only about space allocation, but also about which products to list and
how to price them. Therefore an innovative model is proposed that jointly optimizes
assortment, space allocation and prices, viewing category proﬁt as a composite
function of price- and space-dependent demand, consumer-driven substitution and
price-dependent proﬁt. The innovation resides in integrating pricing decisions and
substitution effects with shelf space management.

Total proﬁt additionally comprises total cross-product proﬁt (TCPP). The inven-
tory costs from Chap.5 are excluded to allow unambiguous analyzes of demand
effects in comparison to the base model. TCPP are cross-product effects resulting
from the cross-product change-over of shoppers due to price and space adjustments.

Major constraints are the number of facings, price corridors, basic supply level,
minimum volume and limited total shelf space. The model can be implemented as
a knapsack problem in CPLEX to provide fast and practical solutions. Numerical
examples are used to illustrate insights into planning problems. Sensitivity analyses
are used to evaluate error boundaries for consumer behavior and managerial
decisions. The analyses show low inﬂuence of deviations on estimated consumer
behavior, and moderate effects of overarching strategic decisions.
1.4.6
Conclusions and Outlook
The ﬁnal Chap. 7 summarizes the results and draws conclusion for further research
opportunities and implementation in retail practice.
Four avenues emerge as important directions of future research. First, master
category planning problems need to be aligned with hierarchical and vertical plan-
ning interdependencies. Second, incorporating other consumer demand effects in
shelf space optimization models seems a valuable area of research. Third, different
modeling techniques and solution procedures may be interesting to cope with large-
scale problems that integrate other demand, stochastic or dynamic effects. Finally,
most of the existing theoretical models have not been implemented in industry
applications (meaning also their theoretical predictions have not been empirically
tested). The ﬁeld would beneﬁt from such applications and empirical tests to validate
the assumptions in the increasingly complex shelf space management planning
models being formulated in academic literature.

This research extended the existing literature that addresses the shelf space
allocation problem. It does so by capturing the critical decision trade-offs faced
by retailers in optimizing their shelf space. This dissertation structures the plan-
ning problems, devises decision support models to maximize category proﬁt, and
provides methods to test the capability of models for category-speciﬁc problems.
The planning issues are illustrated using models with differing levels of integration.
Speciﬁcally, this dissertation develops models that optimize retailers’ decisions
relating to assortment size, number of facings, replenishment frequency and product
prices in a retail category. It would be rewarding to see these models integrated into
day-to-day retail practice, with all the beneﬁts that this would imply for both the
trade and ultimately for the customer.

Introduction
Retail shelf management means matching cost-efﬁcient consumer demand with
retail operations. This takes especially place at the point-of-sales in front of the
retail shelf, where consumer demand meets retail offer. Therefore, we develop a
comprehensive planning framework for retail demand and supply chain planning
in this chapter, before we analyze and develop decision support systems for retail
shelf management. The increasingly competitive retail environment requires greater
customer orientation and operational efﬁciencies. Consumers are always demanding
higher service levels and better purchase prices. Retailers are striving towards
broader product variety, better prices and lower costs, and are growing vertically
by taking over more logistical functions. Effective structures and planning tools
for demand and supply chain planning (DSCP) are therefore the core technique
for coordinating thousands of individual decisions in supply chain and customer
management.
If consumer demand and retail supply plans are not aligned, retailers need
to either solve logistical issues with expensive ad hoc solutions or mark down
oversupplied goods (Fisher and Raman 2010). Both approaches lead to a dete-
rioration of the proﬁt base. Consequently, retailers need efﬁcient modeling and
decision-making techniques. An analytics orientation at many retail organizations
provides a great opportunity for modelers and nudging retail managers towards more
quantitative decision-making (Kopalle 2010; H¨ubner et al. 2010). A comprehensive
operations planning framework that integrates consumer behavior is required to
maintain and increase retailers’ proﬁt both directly (e.g., reduced stockouts) and
indirectly (e.g., higher customer satisfaction). While consumer integration into
supply chain management (SCM) gains further importance for retailing business
practice, only few analytical explanations with consumer integration for retail DSCP
have been put forth. Retail practice and research lack a holistic framework that is
based on an integral planning perspective at the entire retail supply chain (SC) and
comprehensive quantitative decision support systems (DSS).

Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
The goal of this chapter is therefore to derive, structure and integrate holistically
DSCP problems and provide quantitative decision support models. This will enable
practitioners and researchers to classify decisions and realize the interdependencies
of decisions that have to be taken. The framework will help to manage properly the
complexity of various planning aspects of interrelated supply chain and category
management. As a result, it will foster the transition from research to retail as a
comprehensively integrated planning framework. This is the ﬁrst contribution that
structure DSCP planning questions in one framework that matches demand and
supply from a long- to short-term perspective and from supplier to customer.
However, due to the lack of literature and since common scientiﬁc approaches
like structured interviews and questionnaires did not seem to be very promising
because a lot of conﬁdence is needed to get this sensitive information, this work
is based on experience in retail research and practice. This chapter combines the
knowledge and insights into these ﬁelds from retail grocery, retail consultancy,
science and projects with grocery retailing. Hence, the characterization of the
retail planning framework builds on various joint projects with retailers and
communications with retail planners and with responsible from consumer goods
industry and consultancies. Note that we apply a similar approach as for example
in Meyr (2004), Agrawal and Smith (2009c), and Fisher and Raman (2010).
Additionally, literature is reviewed to support the conclusions with publications on
dedicated planning problems. The research models can both explain and capture the
real-life operational processes and decision-making problems, thereby aiming to
support decision-making on design, planning, controlling, and executing operations
(Bertrand and Fransoo 2002).
The remainder is organized as follows: First, the research objective is speciﬁed
and corresponding frameworks are reviewed. Section 2.3 sets the context of the
decision problems in the retail industry, before Sect. 2.4 formulates a retail DSCP
framework and proposes an innovative way for hierarchical retail planning aspects.
The Sect. 2.5 illustrates interdependencies between planning modules. The ﬁnal
Sect. 2.6 draws conclusions and develops areas for future research.

Research Objective
DSCP is very complex. While retail managers strive to follow the industry mantra
“retail is detail”, most retail managers have little time to consider the details of
different planning aspects. Also, not every detail that has to be considered at the
actual execution can be reﬂected in the planning process. One core proposal in
DSCP is to abstract from reality and to use models as a basis for plans. Analytical
models emerge as the most promising solutions to many of the DSCP problems,
especially as the advances in computing capabilities allow solving larger problems

(Kopalle 2010). Retail research literature is rich on DSSs for single planning
problems (see for example the literature reviews of Levy et al. 2004; Levy and
Grewala 2007; Kopalle 2010 or Akkerman et al. 2010). Also Agrawal and Smith
(2009b) and Fisher and Raman (2010) describe various retail planning problems.
However, they stick to isolated planning problems and do not provide an integrated
planning framework or analyze the interdependence of them. That is why it is not
surprising, that practitioners often complain about the limited practical value or
limited scope of DSS, and challenge the possibility of integrating them into current
systems (Kuhn and Sternbeck 2011). Current publications on retail demand and
supply chain management do not provide a comprehensive planning architecture,
as they deal mainly with isolated planning problems. Fisher and Raman (2010,
p.127) note that “Retailers have three tactics at their disposal for matching supply
with demand: accurate forecasting, supply ﬂexibility, and inventory stock pilling”.
We want to broaden this perspective as retail research and practice lack a holistic
framework taken into account:
•
Integral planning perspective at the entire retail SC: A planning framework
structures intertwined planning tasks along the SC and takes into account
horizontal and vertical interdependencies.
•
Comprehensive quantitative decision support systems: A planning framework
considers proper deﬁnition of objectives, constraints, and alternatives. In addi-
tion, exact and/or heuristic optimization and evaluation methods are required in
the DSSs (Fleischmann et al. 2008).
Our contribution therefore resides in developing a comprehensive operations
planning framework that integrates all relevant planning aspects, structures them
according to the ﬂow of goods and hierarchical aspects, and is based on quantitative
DSS. Researchers and especially practitioners will gain insights as we answer our
research questions:
•
How should a comprehensive demand and supply chain planning framework be
structured?
•
How should the planning subsystems be arranged?
•
Which planning decisions (in which sequence and hierarchy) are required for a
better demand and supply matching?
•
And last, but not least: What is the state-of-the art of DSS for each planning
module?
Scientist will ﬁnd further areas of research. We see these especially in a focal
literature review for some planning modules that we develop, the development of
efﬁcient decision support systems and a uniﬁed modeling structure. Retailers and
software vendors can take the framework for tailoring, harmonizing or developing
advanced planning software systems in retail.
Before developing our DSCP framework, we want to review state-of-the art retail
planning frameworks:

2.2.2
Integral Planning Perspective at Entire
Retail Supply Chain
The “Efﬁcient Consumer Response” (ECR) concept is an example for integral
planning. The initiative aims for a better coordination between strategic partners
with the objective to improve satisfaction of consumer needs through efﬁcient
replenishment, store assortments, promotions and product introductions (ECR
Europe 2003a). This is based on the awareness, that demand-side concepts retain
a direct relation to logistical tasks (Kumar 2008). ECR objectives are to remove
inefﬁciencies in information ﬂow and data management along the SC and to
realize gains for all partners, which would otherwise not be realized in an isolated,
uncoordinated approach (Kotzab 1999). ECR aims towards a vertical cooperation
by building trustful relations and sharing data, rather than towards the application
of comprehensive analytical methods. The initiatives are “manual”-like qualitative
approaches to support the planning. Alvarado and Kotzab (2001) analyze the lack
of theoretical explanations of SCM-methods within the ECR. They hypothesize that
the complexity involved in SCM leads to difﬁculties in testing “hybrid” relationships
and concepts. A broader theoretical basis appears to be required, especially as
“optimization” is an often-used word there. But typically “optimization” conveys
there the idea of improvement and not to ﬁnd the best solution out of a huge,
sometimes not countable number of possible alternatives.
On the other side, integral planning fosters to generate total systems, which
then cannot be solved optimally because of the complex interdependencies. Varying
decision owners, time horizons, frequencies and degrees of aggregation or impor-
tance, force a decomposition of decisions (Fleischmann and Meyr 2003). Optimal
planning of an entire retail SC is neither possible in form of a monolithic system
that plans all tasks simultaneously nor by performing the various planning steps
simply successively. The fully integrated optimization could not be put into practice.
Also, the poor successive planning would miss optimality. Hierarchical planning is
a compromise between practicability, integrating interdependencies and break down
the overall planning into partial planning modules (Miller 2001; Schneeweiss 2003a;
Fleischmann and Meyr 2003; Gebhardt and Kuhn 2008; Stadtler 2008; G¨unther and
Meyr 2009). It enables coordinating a solution and considering interdependencies.
Thus, in the following a hierarchical planning concept is reviewed, which is mainly
based on quantitative decision methods.
2.2.3
Comprehensive Quantitative Decision Support Systems
The SC planning matrix from Fleischmann et al. (2008) classiﬁes planning tasks
according to the SC processes and the planning horizons (see Fig. 2.1).
They distinguish horizontally along the ﬂow of goods between procurement,
production, distribution and sales. Procurement is concerned with providing the
resources. Production covers aspects from location planning to shop ﬂoor control.
Distribution bridges the gap between production and customers. Sales consider

mainly demand forecasts. The vertical distinction of planning tasks into long-, mid-
and short-term is determined by the importance and planning horizon.
Fleischmann et al. (2008) group long-term planning tasks into one module to
illustrate the comprehensive character of strategic planning. It designs the overall
conﬁguration and requires long-term investments in the infrastructure. Mid-term
master planning coordinates daily business and typically develops plans for 6–24
months. Finally, short-term planning speciﬁes activities before the execution. The
disaggregation of data and options follows the decreasing planning horizon down
the hierarchy. The planning modules are coordinated with adjacent modules and
account for interdependencies between product and information ﬂow.
The strength of the SC planning of Fleischmann et al. (2008) lies in the
decomposition of decisions and structuring planning problems. It aligns planning
aspects according to the time-horizons and the value chain activities. However,
it has been mainly designed for a business-to-business environment and does not
explicitly integrate consumer behavior and store management, which is of major
relevance in retail. The sales domain is reduced to product program planning and
demand forecast and therefore mainly serves as data input for other planning areas.
The literature so far does not provide a hierarchical and sequential planning
concept for the retail industry. Therefore, we structure advanced DSCP tasks,
provide a framework for a consumer-driven SC and provide a state-of-the-art
overview of DSSs. First of all, we will detail the requirements for grocery retailing.
This builds the foundation and deﬁnes the requirement for a retail speciﬁc operations
framework, which follows afterwards.
2.3
Speciﬁcs of Grocery Retailing
2.3.1
Attributes of the Retail Grocery Supply Chain
The typology of Meyr and Stadtler (2008) is used to describe the grocery SC func-
tional attributes (procurement type, production type, distribution type and sales type)

20
2
Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
as well as structural types (topography and integration and coordination). Since
typologies can never be comprehensive, this focuses on planning relevant attributes.
Grocery retailers buy and sell standardized fast-moving consumer goods as
make-to-stock products. They source different products from many suppliers and
have short and reliable replenishment cycles. Demand has to be estimated and
may be unstable due to several reasons, e.g., seasonal inﬂuences or consumer
preferences. Warehouse operations are the production areas where goods are picked
for the deliveries to the stores. Distribution can occur in multiple ways from direct
store deliveries to multiple distribution centers. Some of the products have dedicated
distribution requirements, e.g., a continuous cooled transportation. The retail sales
type can be differentiated into products from the permanent assortment and pro-
motional products. Products from the permanent assortment have a stable life cycle
compared to other industries and stable prices over a mid-term period. Promotional
articles are only temporarily listed and have dynamically varying prices. Both non-
seasonal and seasonal products are in retail assortments. With regard to relevant
attributes for planning, products are heterogeneousand product sales are high. Major
constraints are in capacity like shelf space, outlet backroom, transportation and
picking. The SC is inter- and intra-organizational coordinated, as some suppliers
maintain own shelf space in retail outlets. Inter-organizational coordination gained
increasingly attention by concepts of ECR or Vendor Managed Inventories, partic-
ularly these ones that are concerning consumer demand and improving information
ﬂows between the SC-members. Quante et al. (2009) classify grocery retail supply
chains as ﬂexible, inventory-based chains with make-to-order products.
2.3.2
Reasons for Modiﬁcations in Retail Planning
The structural properties of the retail SC are challenges to design a comprehensive
DSCP framework. The reasons for modiﬁcations in grocery retailing are especially
consumer interaction, focus on sales and demand planning, distribution manage-
ment and warehousing as production.
2.3.2.1
Consumer Interaction
The key to retail success is to understand and manage the consumer behavior.
Fernie and Sparks (2009) highlight the impact of consumers on SC, as retailers
can be identiﬁed as “active designers and controllers of product supply in reaction
to known customer demand.” Grewal and Levy (2007) describe it as customer
experience management, which includes all points of contact at which the customer
interacts with the business, product or service. Blackwell and Blackwell (1999) state
that the greatest beneﬁts in SCM can be derived from demand side management.
The consumer’s behavior initiates many of the activities and processes in the SC
(Pal and Byrom 2003). The goal thereby is to satisfy consumer demand quickly,
with reasonable quality and at efﬁcient costs and prices. Instore behavior of many

2.3
Speciﬁcs of Grocery Retailing
21
consumers determines requirements for retailers DSCP (e.g., in Dr`eze et al. 1994;
B¨uschken 2009; Chandon et al. 2009; Xin et al. 2009; H¨ubner and Kuhn 2011e).
Furthermore, consumers are part of the value chain, as they execute the ﬁnal
process, taking products from the shelves to the point of consumption (Granzin
et al. 1997).
2.3.2.2
Focus on Sales and Demand Planning
The location of the decoupling point has a decisive impact on planning as it divides
the planning tasks into forecast-driven and order-driven processes. Incoming orders
have to be served at the decoupling point immediately for customer demand, i.e., the
crucial decoupling point in consumer goods industry is typically located at the store
of the retailer. That means it is at the very end of the supply chain. Thus, forecasting
and sales planning gain higher importance in comparison to other industries. Retail-
ers anticipate consumer demand downwards the SC until the “moment of truth”
when consumer ﬁnally take their instore decisions. Retailers need to proactively
manage supply and demand requirements until the consumer enters the store, as all
following processes are only reactive. For example, retailers can vary product offers
or prices based on anticipated consumer behavior. This refers, not only to demand
forecasts, but also to proper optimization methods to steer consumers’ behavior.
Hence, the sales area inﬂuences entire DSCP (Quante et al. 2009).
2.3.2.3
Distribution Management
Primary objective of retail is to bridge the gap between the point-of-production
and the point-of-sales at the retail outlet. This means to manage the collection and
commissioning of goods in multiple warehouses and the distribution to multiple
outlets for up to 50,000 items (EHI Retail Institute 2010). This requires practical
planning methods for multi-echelon inventory control (e.g., at one warehouse
for n retailers) and distribution planning for multiple nodes, delivery modes and
thousands of items with varying transport requirements (e.g., chilled, ambient, fresh)
(see e.g., Agrawal and Smith 2009a).
2.3.2.4
Warehousing as Production
Consumer goods are highly standardized products. Picking in the warehouse can
be treated as the retailer’s production equivalent as store orders are produced
in the warehouse. Planning methods are similar to the added value processes of
producing industries (e.g., lot sizing and scheduling) and depend on the product
characteristics. Nevertheless, the warehouse operations have direct impact on the
retail store operations (e.g., if incoming goods need to be re-picked or restored in
the store’s backroom).

22

Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
These examples of retail speciﬁcs will be reﬂected in the planning activities.
In the following we identify and describe the retail-speciﬁc DSCP problems. We
distinguish these along the time horizon and the ﬂow of goods, by developing a
consumer-backed DSCP framework. The interrelation of planning aspects requires
a holistic approach. Horizontally and vertically coherent modules need to communi-
cate to ensure proper material ﬂow and plan alignments. The framework integrates
retail speciﬁcs, supplier and consumer interaction, as well as hierarchical and
sequential decision aspects.

2.4.1
Overview of Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
Large grocery retailers often need to deal with planning decisions on thousands
individual items and outlets. Therefore, this section develops a hierarchical set of
planning purposes to ensure an integral planning perspective at the entire value
chain and illustrate the beneﬁt of comprehensive quantitative decision support sys-
tems. The total system is decomposed into planning modules. Figure 2.2 structures
planning problems within the retail DSCP matrix.
Along the SC the domains procurement, warehouse, distribution and sales are
distinguished. Planning tasks are classiﬁed according to the planning horizon into
long-, mid- and short-term. Long-term planning covers strategic decisions. They
typically concern conﬁguration decisions of the entire chain. Mid-term master
planning coordinates and determines ground rules of the regular operations for the
next 6–12 months. It considers also seasonal demand patterns. Retailers normally

develop business plans for this period ahead, e.g., when negotiating with suppliers.
The short-term execution planning speciﬁes all activities for immediate execution
and control within the next days or weeks to react directly on actual product
requirements. Individual planning modules are constituted within a matrix to
describe these planning problems.
The modules need to be linked by vertical and horizontal information ﬂows. That
means, planning results of an aggregated level set restrictions for the subordinate
modules, and the results of the lower module communicate back to higher levels.
In the following paragraphs, the planning modules from long- to short-term are
speciﬁed. Furthermore, available scientiﬁc models for the planning problems will
be appended. Afterwards, the interdependencies between planning modules are
illustrated.
2.4.2
Long-Term Conﬁguration Planning
Strategic network and outlet design are coherent strategic problems that cover all
conﬁguration areas and deﬁne layout structures of the entire network. Network
planning includes strategic procurement logistics, warehouse design, distribution
planning and outlet planning. As a result, network planning constitutes the form,
structure and efﬁciency of the whole retail SC (Gill and Bhatti 2007). It deﬁnes
the relations between suppliers, retailers and customers (Levy and Grewal 2000).
Figure 2.3 summarizes the strategic planning areas for the convergent and divergent
product ﬂows.
Long-term conﬁguration planning shapes the entire enterprise, needs to be
embedded in the environment and needs to be highly tailored to the retailer’s overall
philosophy and strategy.
2.4.2.1
Strategic Procurement Logistics
Retail procurement includes purchasing of consumer goods from the supplier and its
associated logistics. Consequently it links the retailers’ operations with the supplier.

suppliers and their geographical dispersion (Ganeshan et al. 2007). The following
three planning areas are distinguished:
The sourcing strategy sets the frame for procurement activities by determining
the extent of sourcing activities, minimum and maximum number of suppliers per
category and sourcing quota, e.g., branded product and private label or single and
multiple sourcing. Furthermore, it determines segment-speciﬁc sourcing modes and
degrees of external service providers in sourcing.
Supplier selection and contracting determine rules for supplier selection and
performance assessment, select suppliers based on deﬁned decision criteria and
establish contracts. Supplier selection is a multi-criteria decision problem with
criteria like price, trade terms, reliability, lead time, producer or brand image. Some
factors are hard to quantify, e.g., reliability may play an even bigger role than
payment conditions, as out-of-stock situations deteriorate customer satisfaction.
Agrawal et al. (2002) determine the optimal suppliers for multiple products with
varying demand. They quantify multiple vendor qualiﬁcations with premiums like
ﬂexibility. Lowson (2001) identiﬁes further criteria like the market power of players.
The contracting ensures basic price and quantity agreements, sets the contract
duration as well as trade and logistical terms including quantity discounts, minimum
order quantities or logistical terms as incentive to improve delivery efﬁciency. This
consists of discounts and agreements, like ex-works or free delivery. Wang and
Liu (2007) analyze supplier contracts when the retailer is the dominant partner.
Further, Lyu et al. (2010) examine the cooperation between supplier and retailer
and propose collaborative replenishment models. This entails a series of planning
requirements, such as integration of wholesalers and distributors or joint assortment
and supplier selection. These examples already show the extent and complexity of
supplier management in retail. The reader is referred to the literature above for
further details.
Inbound logistics strategy determines the degree of own inbound SC activities
and how these can be organized with suppliers, e.g., if inbound is coordinated by
retailer or producer. It covers long-term aspects of the inbound logistics and how
goods ﬂow from supplier to retailer and regulates responsibilities. Finally it creates
structures for direct store and warehouse deliveries.
2.4.2.2
Strategic Warehouse Design
Warehousing in retail consists of all activities between inbound from suppliers and
outbound logistics to outlets, especially picking outlet speciﬁc orders as “retail
production.” The strategic warehouse design rules number, location, function and
types of warehouses.
The determination of the number of warehouses and location planning requires a
trade-off decision between inbound transportation costs, ﬁxed site costs, inventory
costs and outbound transportation costs (Teo and Shu 2004; de Koster et al. 2007).
It sets the total number and size of warehouses and selects the site. Increasing
the number of warehouses reduces the outbound transportation costs, but increases

2.4
Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
25
the inbound transportation and inventory costs. The function within the network
is deciding whether to use central and/or regional warehouses, e.g., products are
stored in a central and a regional warehouse or only in a central or regional
warehouse. Retail particularly operates in various warehouse-outlet modes (e.g.,
supplier warehouse, retailer warehouse, cross-docks, direct store delivery). The type
determination means selecting the technologies for serving the warehouses and
running production processes, e.g., technologies for frozen, chilled and ambient
products or material handling technologies for order picking systems, like picker-
to-parts or parts-to-picker (Dallari et al. 2008). Furthermore, determining the layout
structure of the order picking involves a trade-off between travel distance and the
required space for the picking area (Roodbergen et al. 2008). The objective of
internal design is in the most cases the minimization of handling costs represented
by a function of travel distance (de Koster et al. 2007; Gu et al. 2007).
2.4.2.3
Strategic Distribution Planning
The strategic distribution planning means determination of the physical distribution
structures between warehouses and outlets, the ﬂexibility and the degree of own
outbound SC activities. The strategic distribution planning creates structures for
the transportation mode for direct links to stores, cross-docking or transshipment
(Jayaraman et al. 2003). It is a trade-off between infrastructure costs, inventory hold-
ing costs, transportation costs and the customer service targets. Often, retailers use
a mix of distribution structures depending on the supplier location and the product
characteristics. Many retail chains have developed logistics systems for transport
between central and regional warehouses and stores. Often, these warehouses are
used for storage and picking, but sometimes they only serve for cross-docking.
Erlebacher and Meller (2000) minimize the ﬁxed operating and inventory holding
costs incurred by warehouses, together with total transportation costs. Hence, it also
requires deﬁning global delivery strategies and aspirations for lead times. Van der
Vorst (2009) simulates the (re-)design options of a food supply chain. Finally, it
needs to regulate to which extent the retailer takes care of the outbound logistics
and how strategic partnerships with logistic service providers could be arranged.
For a dedicated literature on food distribution planning, we refer to a recent review
of Akkerman et al. (2010).
2.4.2.4
Strategic Outlet Planning
A fundamental change in retail pertains to the expansion in the number of retail
formats (Kabadayi et al. 2007). The store type and location planning includes
selecting a set of store types with typical store sizes and determining the outlet
network and locations from competitive, customer and logistical perspective (e.g.,
further geographical expansion vs. increasing network density in established mar-
kets). Location is a critical factor in the consumer selection of a store (Cachon

26
2
Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
and K¨ok 2007) and requires methods of geographical marketing. Additionally, the
outlet has to be easily accessible for supply from warehouses. As a result, outlet
planning cannot be planned separately to the distribution planning. Durvasula et al.
(1992) presented a model that incorporates managerial evaluations in combination
with consumer data. Mendes and Themido (2004) and Grewal and Levy (2007)
summarize location decision models, whereas for example Hernandez et al. (1998)
and Drezner (2009) develop frameworks for it.
Strategic layout planning determines instore infrastructure and layout at show-
and backroom. The showroom layout needs to reﬂect the retailer’s image, must
reduce consumer search costs, inﬂuences consumers’ buying decisions (Dr`eze et al.
1994; Xin et al. 2009) and impacts space productivity. Finally, the layout impedes
instore-logistics processes and sizes the capacity and infrastructure of the backroom
storage (Kotzab and Teller 2005). Research models predominately analyze layout
planning with empirical studies (Iyer 1989; Turley and Milliman 2000; Lam 2001;
Mattila and Wirtz 2008). Hui et al. (2009) developed a probability model for
consumer behavior and derived implications for the design of retail space with
simulations.
2.4.3
Mid-Term Master Planning
Mid-term master planning utilizes the conﬁguration design of the superior strategic
planning and deals with the coordination and planning of aggregated operative
units 6–12 months in advance. In the following subsections, ﬁrstly the master
coordination with product segmentation and allocation, and the subordinated
mid-term planning problems of inbound, production and distribution planning
will be described, before the planning modules for master category and instore
planning of the sales area are constituted that formate the core of retail shelf
management.
2.4.3.1
Product Segmentation and Allocation
Planning of product segmentation and allocation is the core of master planning. This
planning step coordinates comprehensively the ﬂow of goods between procurement,
warehousing and distribution. It comprises of ﬁve subproblems.
The planning of product delivery modes determines product-supplier-speciﬁc
delivery modes from inbound logistics to outlets and coordinates inbound, pro-
duction and distribution planning. These planning tasks comprise decisions about
product speciﬁc ﬂow types from producer to outlet, e.g., selection between direct
store delivery, supplier cross-dock, central and regional warehouses or combinations
of it. For example, daily fresh bakery products may be delivered via direct store
delivery whereas other non-perishable food products are delivered via warehouses.
Thonemann et al. (2005) provide retail-speciﬁc criteria for selecting different

2.4
Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
27
delivery modes and expose the comparative advantages and disadvantages. This
also shows, that it can not be solved independently from the strategic warehouse
design.
First of all, assignment product-warehouse-outlet builds and assigns products
and outlets to warehouses and secondly allocates inventories, e.g., frozen products
can be delivered to all outlets from a central warehouse, as requirements for cooled
SCs require special equipment. The allocation of inventories across warehouses
and outlets builds a liaison across master planning modules. Retailers could hold
inventories at central and/or regional warehouses and at the back- and showroom
of the outlets. Inventories along the SC are used to increase economies of scale, to
balance supply and demand at the individual stations and to hedge against uncertain
demand and shortcomings. Since distribution managers are increasingly caught
between market pressures on the one hand and the trade-off between high cost of
inventories and increased shipment frequencies on the other hand, it is important
to plan carefully how centralized a product should be stored (Whybark and Yang
1996).
Selection of dispatch units chooses standardized order units for all products and
therefore the granularity of possible order sizes. For example, it is the selection
of packaging units (e.g., full carton, full pallet) as shipping units, taking into
account handling aspects, inventory aspects, packaging density and shelf capacity.
Ketzenberg et al. (2002) explore the instore-beneﬁts of breaking bulk and delivering
single units instead of case-packs from the warehouses in the outlets. They quantify
the effects on space management and proﬁtability. By employing a simulation
model, Yan et al. (2009) consider the impact of case-pack-sizes on the performance
of a periodic review inventory system in the presence of spatially-correlated
demand.
Building product segments with related order patterns is the aggregation of
products to segments with homogeneous order characteristics, including the deter-
mination of the associated lead time from outlet perspective. Products could be
grouped according to identical order patterns, e.g., homogeneous subsets with
respect to shelf life, temperature and other logistical factors (Sternbeck and Kuhn
2010). Furthermore the order lead times for the product groups have to be
determined. The shorter the order lead time, the more limited the degree of freedom
for order capacity balancing.
Selection of transportation means determines the optimal mix of transportation
means (e.g., truck or railway) and desired ﬂexibility within the physical distribution
structure. It selects product carriers like returnable boxes, container and pallet for
frequent warehouse picking, transportation and shelf replenishment. Selection of
transportation providers determines mid-term the degree of own transportation
services and selection of external providers. That means it covers, for example,
the outsourcing of logistical activities to third parties, using own vehicle ﬂeets or
third-party carriers (Fernie 1999; Le Blanc et al. 2006; Potter et al. 2007). Hertel
et al. (2005) deﬁne service, integration, market and cost oriented criteria for logistics
outsourcing decisions.

2.4.3.2
Inbound Planning
Inbound planning covers all mid-term problems related to supplier interaction,
which concerns supplier order management and master inbound route planning.
Supplier order management determines order rules, i.e., order quantity planning
to deﬁne the economic order sizes. It plans dispatching rules for ﬁxed order periods
(r; S-policy) or ﬁxed order quantities (s; q-policy) (Tempelmeier 2008). Retailers
need to determine optimal order quantities with respect to quantity discounts, time-
varying prices (e.g., for promotions), trade terms (e.g., minimum order quantities,
delivery costs) and limited storage capacity. Hence the supplier order management
also determines the inventory levels and safety stocks. It forces a trade-off decision
between the risk of stock outs, obsolete products, high inventory holding costs
and dealing with limited storage and shelf space (Ganeshan 1999; Helnerus 2009).
Zhao et al. (2004) study a modiﬁed economic order quantity problem for a single
supplier-retailer system with production, inventory and transportation costs.
Master inbound route planning falls only into the retailers planning domain,
if the retailer coordinates the inbound logistics. This planning step aggregates
supply points to macro- and micro delivery regions. It coordinates the convergent
product ﬂows from suppliers to the retailer, e.g., organization and coordination of
producer deliveries or retailer pick ups with milk runs. The objective is the allocation
of supplier factories to pick up regions to realize bundling effects. Additionally,
master route schedules are determined by region, to realize effects of transportation
bundling under constraints like transportation capacity or lead times.
2.4.3.3
Production Planning
Mid-term capacity, personnel planning and warehouse management problems are
consolidated in production planning. Capacity and personnel planning ﬁrstly aligns
mid-term storage capacity with a master production program and its forecasted
demand requirements. Secondly, it aligns the master production schedule with
seasonal ﬂuctuations of demand and calculates a frame for necessary amounts of
overtime and additional picking capacity. Examples are the acquisition or rental
of additional storage capacity during peak seasons, two- or three-shift models
or seasonal engagement plans. Personnel planning covers the optimization of
mid-term and general personnel deployment schedules, with respect to employee
working time, e.g., sizing of the monthly headcount according to expected capacity
requirements. A review of literature for this topic is provided by de Koster et al.
(2007).
Warehouse management plans the warehouse layout, allocates storage areas and
aligns product ﬂows within the warehouse (Hwang et al. 2004; de Koster et al.
2007). That leads to arrangement decisions on the ﬂow of material and placement
within the warehouse in order to optimize storage handling processes. For example,
a retail warehouse may mirror a retail outlet, i.e., products are arranged for picking
in the warehouse as the store layout (roll cage sequencing). Objectives of storage

2.4
Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
29
assignment are high space utilization and efﬁcient material handling (Gu et al.
2007).
2.4.3.4
Distribution Planning
Distribution planning comprises outlet order management and master outbound
route planning. It prepares the decision to fulﬁll the customer service targets with
the minimum cost as a trade-off between inventory management policies for each
shop and delivery policies from the central warehouse.
Outlet order management determines order rules for outlets. It is, similar to
supplier order management, the determination of order policies, with ﬁxed order
periods or ﬁxed order quantities. For example, order rules determine delivery
frequencies for outlets and product segments with related order patterns. The
objective is to minimize delivery costs by achieving high truck utilization and still
allowing ﬂexible outlet ordering. Retailers need to optimize delivery frequency
with respect to product shelf life and processes in warehousing, transportation and
outlets by setting delivery frequency, for example weekly, twice a week or daily for
product groups. Ganeshan (1999) studies an inventory policy for a network with
multiple suppliers by replenishing a central depot, which then redistributes to a
large number of retailers. Viswanathan and Mathur (1997) empirically verify the
performance of power-of-two policies under which each retail outlet is replenished
at constant intervals. These are power-of-two multiples of a common base planning
period. Helnerus (2009) analyses inventory management models for outlets with
perishable and non-perishable goods with stochastic demand, ﬁxed capacity and
varying assortments.
Master outbound route planning describes planning problems related to trans-
portation links for the outbound-logistics. It is the aggregation of outlets to
macro- and micro delivery regions and the determination of master route schedules
by region to realize effects of transportation bundling under the constraints of
transportation and lead time requirements. The main objective is to minimize costs
with regard to high truck utilization, limit empty return transports and further
constraints to warehouse and store operations (e.g., time windows at inbound gates)
to fulﬁlling demand on an aggregated level. For example, Pamuk et al. (2004) model
the assignment of customers to weekdays and delivery frequency. Adenso-D´ıaz et al.
(1998) also determine on which week day a customer should be served.
2.4.3.5
Master Category Planning
Master category planning frames the sales planning tasks of category management,
including overall category sales planning, assortment architecture and promotion
planning. Category sales planning includes category selection, determining the
role of the category and category volume forecasting. Category selection covers
determining the set of categories, categories’ share and a master product program.

30
2
Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
For example, a relative share between adjacent categories could be deﬁned. Overall,
it assesses the overall performance of individual categories and determines the mix
for an entire store. Gruen and Shah (2000) identify factors that impact categories
performance. Category management receives input from the overarching decision
of the network and store conﬁguration and sets guidelines for the subordinated sales
planning problems.
The determination of a category role deﬁnes the role from the consumer
perspective, the depth of the category and deﬁnes price levels of categories relative
to each other. With the beverage category as an example, the retailer needs to decide
whether only soft drinks should be listed, or if alcoholic drinks should also be
included. Furthermore, the relative price differences between subcategories, such as
wine and beer, need to be deﬁned. These planning problems have a predominately
qualitative decision characteristic to reﬂect strategic goals like the price image of a
category.
Forecasting category demand generates the mid-term sales plans. It is a crucial
component of planning in the retail sector. Inaccurate demand planning affects
entire SC performance and behavior. This results in inaccurate material planning,
unreliable production schedules, high inventories and stockouts, poor customer
service and ﬁnally adjustments to sales and marketing projections. This is again
a defective input for further demand planning activities with negative consequences
for the entire SC. Hence, forecasts drive planning.
Forecasting can normally be derived from historical sales data by adjusting
a category’s past demand to make projections for the next 6–12 months based
on aspects like consumer trends and seasonal inﬂuences. Information systems
deserve special attention in accurate planning, as retail operations are becoming
more complex and forecasts are required on all SC areas. Forecasting is not a
retail-speciﬁc issue. Only a few contributions deal with retail speciﬁc problems.
Kumar and Patel (2008) improved the accuracy with clustering products, Bunn and
Vassilopoulos (1999) and Dekker et al. (2004) investigated seasonality, whereas
Aviv (2001), Yue and Liu (2006) and Aviv (2007) studied forecasts for two-
stage SCs. Joint forecasting utilizes and shares information among chain members,
i.e., retailer and producer develop forecast plans and resolve replenishment issues
together (Levy and Grewal 2000).
The planning of the assortment architecture deals with the problem of assort-
ment, shelf space and price management. It is a tactical decision as it implies
changes, e.g., for supplier selection and shelf layout (K¨ok et al. 2009; Fisher and
Raman 2010). It receives input from the overarching master category planning.
Allocating shelf space and prices is a core problem with special regard to the
increasing product variants and the demand for better service levels and prices, and
becomes increasingly difﬁcult for retailers.
Assortment management is (de-)listing products for each outlet. When optimiz-
ing assortments, it is indispensable to include consumer demand (Anupindi et al.
2009; Smith 2009b). The total demand for a product not only consists of own initial
demand, but also the substitution demand from other products (Borin et al. 1994).
Mantrala et al. (2009) developed a framework that highlights trade-off decisions,

2.4
Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
31
which retailers must make for the assortment planning of how many categories to
offer, assortment depth and establishing service levels. Chapter 3 will provide a
comprehensive literature review on assortment and shelf space planning in retail.
We reﬂect substitution models for determining the breadth and depth of assortments
and optimal inventories as in newsboy models (van Ryzin and Mahajan 1999; Smith
and Agrawal 2000; Mahajan and van Ryzin 2001; K¨ok and Fisher 2007; Y¨ucel et al.
2009).
Shelf space management assigns facing quantities to individual products with
limited shelf sizes and restocking capacity. Planning models are provided for the
quantity of inventory that should be carried out for each item (Urban 1998; Abbott
and Palekar 2008; H¨ubner and Kuhn 2011e,a), the amount of space that is assigned
to each product (Hansen and Heinsbroek 1979; Corstjens and Doyle 1981; H¨ubner
and Kuhn 2011d) and its location within the store (Yang 2001; Hariga et al. 2007).
Hansen et al. (2010) compare heuristics for decision models with facing-dependent
demand and vertical and horizontal location effects.
The price management sets prices relative to other product prices and to compe-
tition. Prices of the permanent assortment are usually set for mid-term periods. They
need to be adjusted continuously due to mid-term variances in demand, competition,
seasonality or costs of operations (Grewal and Levy 2007). However, pricing and
assortment decisions are strongly intertwined (McIntyre and Miller 1999). Murray
et al. (2010) model jointly shelf space and pricing decisions. Retailers often use
mixed calculation with loss leaders in the assortment. This results in low margins
for the discounted items, but proﬁt and demand gains for other items if consumers
shop for these together. An integrative approach treats demand planning and pricing
as part of the consumer goods SC, as decoupling takes place at the point of sales.
Consequently, retail DSCP methods need to be extended to demand fulﬁllment
and revenue management (Quante et al. 2009). For example, Hall et al. (2010)
analyze retailer pricing and ordering decisions in a dynamic category management
setting.
Promotion planning determines promotional type, assortment and prices, and
evaluates effectiveness. Promotion management focuses on promotional items and
plans, whereas assortment architecture optimizes the permanent sections in the
store. Promotions studies evaluate the success and optimize temporary promotions
(Gupta 1988; Abraham and Lodish 1993; Blattberg and Neslin 1993; Federgruen
and Heching 1999; van Heerde et al. 2004; Smith 2009b; Fisher and Raman
2010).
2.4.3.6
Instore Planning
Instore planning arranges store staff and store logistics concepts. The store person-
nel planning aligns the store personnel resources (in regular terms, e.g., quarterly),
with requirements such as expected customer frequencies, customer service and
replenishment activities. The staff acquisition in retail is similar to other industries,
however, the restrictions differ, such as assignments for entire opening hours or

32
2
Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
restocking during night shifts. Retailers face a trade-off between hiring too many
employees, facing high costs, but also assuring a minimum service level in the store
(Lam et al. 1998; Thonemann et al. 2005; Kabak et al. 2008).
Store logistics planning determines logistical instore and shelf replenishment
processes. Relevant planning questions are for example dealing with reﬁlling quan-
tities, cycles and time windows for shelf replenishment. Objectives are to reduce
stockouts and meet required outlet service levels, increase logistical efﬁciencies
and free up time for customer service. This can be achieved e.g., by outsourced
merchandisers or a scheduled reﬁlling before store opens. Further examples are
analyses of instore reﬁlling processes and the determination of a level for re-
and intermediate storage of goods in the backroom (DeHoratius and Ton 2009;
van Donselaar et al. 2010; Fisher and Raman 2010). It receives input from the
shelf space planning and the operational constraints form the subordinated instore
fulﬁllment. Kotzab and Teller (2005), Broekmeulen et al. (2006), Helnerus (2009),
van Zelst et al. (2009) and DeHoratius and Ton (2009) describe instore logistic and
replenishment models.
2.4.4
Short-Term Execution Planning
The short-term execution planning develops action plans on an hourly to weekly
basis for actual requirements and jobs.
2.4.4.1
Order Planning
Order planning includes order dispatching, route planning and ramp management
for actual material and order needs from suppliers. Supplier order dispatching
determines operative order quantities and times for actual material requirements
with respect of supplier delivery frequencies, trade and logistical terms as well as
storage capacity. It answers the short-term question when and how much to order.
Order dispatching solves the trade-off between inventory and order costs, i.e., order
costs increase with frequent orders, whereas inventory costs increase with infrequent
orders.
When the retailer coordinates the inbound logistics, operative inbound route
planning and transport scheduling allocates actual retail orders to detailed trans-
portation capacity (e.g., available trucks). Furthermore it develops a time-phased
deployment schedule and determines operational resources like staff and vehicles
for actual pick up jobs (Fleischmann and Meyr 2003). For example, it bundles pick
ups across suppliers to achieve higher truck utilization while meeting lead time
limits and determines daily route schedules.
Inbound ramp management allocates delivery slots and coordinates incoming
goods. Illustrative examples are the length of warehouse opening hours for incoming
logistics or queuing and sequencing at the inbound gate.

2.4
Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
33
2.4.4.2
Production Scheduling
Production scheduling deals with lot-sizing as well as assignment of machine and
personnel resources within the warehouse for actual orders. Personnel scheduling
determines time plans and responsibilities on a weekly or daily basis to ensure
fulﬁllment of picking activities. For example, it requires an alignment of weekly
staff employment plans with expected outlet order volume and other warehouse jobs
(Kabak et al. 2008).
Lot sizing is the core decision at warehouse operations as it (dis-)aggregates
actual outlet order to delivery units. It is the picking of multiple goods according to
outlet demand. It is necessary to build lot-sizes for balancing the costs of inventory
holding and changeovers with respect to picking and transportation capacity, as well
as lead times. Changeover costs increase with small, frequent lot sizes, inventory
costs with large, infrequent lot sizes (De Koster et al. 1999; Bozer and Kile
2008). Further planning questions are technical requirements, e.g., use of mixed
pallets.
Sequencing and job release deals with the ﬁnal assignment and scheduling of
individual orders to resources and employees. For example, it determines schedules
by reﬂecting lead times and due dates, delivery requirements, utilization rate and
available capacity, transportation and inventory holding costs. And ﬁnally, the
job release determines timing and start dates for actual jobs, e.g., time schedules
for individual picking jobs. Gu et al. (2007) discusses comprehensively operative
warehouse decisions.
2.4.4.3
Transport Planning
Transport planning plans the fulﬁllment of product ﬂows between locations for
actual outlet orders.
Outlet order dispatching determines operative order quantities and times for
actual outlet material requirements with respect to delivery frequency, distribution
and storage capacity (e.g., to meet service levels) (Le-Duc and de Koster 2007;
Bozer and Kile 2008).
The operative outbound route and transport scheduling allocates actual outlet
orders to detailed transportation capacity to develop a time-phased deployment
schedule. It also assigns operational resources like personnel and vehicles for
actual distribution jobs, i.e., it determines the operational resources necessary
for transporting products located at a central facility (e.g. a distribution center
or a warehouse) to geographically dispersed retail stores (Anily and Bramel
1999). For example, it combines transports for a single outlet across different
category orders or assigns orders to deliveries according to the master route
planning guidelines. This also includes vehicle loading, i.e., adjusting the number
of shipments with multiple items on the same transport link to full truck loads
(Fleischmann and Meyr 2003). Card´os and Garc´ıa-Sabater (2006) analyze the

34
2
Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
dependence of transport planning, inventory management and consumer response
on service levels.
The outbound ramp management allocates distribution slots and coordinates
outgoing material ﬂows. Similarities with inbound ramp management include
opening hours, queuing and sequencing.
2.4.4.4
Instore Fulﬁllment
The ﬁnal short-term planning deals with the instore fulﬁllment of operative tasks,
i.e., plans short-term sales, develops personnel schedules, and aligns operative
instore logistics and shelf replenishment processes. Instore fulﬁllment at the
“moment of truth” signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the performance of a retail store. For
example, Angerer (2006) shows that instore processes cause 72% of the out-of-
stock situations, and only 28% have their origin outside the outlet. Broekmeulen
et al. (2006) and Kuhn and Sternbeck (2011) concluded that the instore logistic
costs amount up to 48% of the total logistic costs.
Short-term sales planning forecasts individual product demand and adjusts
inventory levels and prices. The short-term sales forecasting details the category
forecast on a daily to weekly basis for individual products according to expected
short-term effects and other category planning decisions. It enables customer
demand fulﬁllment from shelf stocks (available-to-promise) for each listed product.
Moreover, the short-term alignment of inventory levels and prices for perishable
products could result in mark-down prices in order to sell them before the date of
expiry. The dynamic pricing and inventory control can be planned with revenue
management approaches (e.g., Federgruen and Heching 1999; van Donselaar et al.
2006; Smith 2009a). Gallego and van Ryzin (1994) identify it as a problem, where
the seller owns perishable goods that are sold to price sensitive consumers with
time-varying prices. Hamister and Suresh (2008) conclude that dynamic pricing
reduces sales variability, and the corresponding bullwhip effect, and increases the
proﬁt compared to static pricing in retail. Their single-item newsboy problem
optimizes stock and price levels. Federgruen and Heching (1999) developed an
inventory model with temporary price variations. They established optimum period
pricing and stock levels. Yin et al. (2009) combine dynamic pricing with shelf
space allocation, whereas Minner and Transchel (2010) determine dynamic order
quantities for perishable products with limited shelf-life.
Store personnel scheduling determines personnel schedules and responsibilities
on a weekly or daily basis to ensure fulﬁllment of operative instore logistics and
customer activities. For example, it aligns personnel availability with customer
frequency and rush hours. It needs to deﬁne the operations time windows for each
individual store employee, e.g., shift time, time allocation to shelf replenishment,
customer service or cash desk, and must be aligned with customer frequency (see
also Fisher and Raman 2010). Lam et al. (1998) studied a personnel planning
model, where they use store trafﬁc forecasts to determine the number of employees.
Kabak et al. (2008) determined the optimal headcount with a sales response model,

2.4
Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
35
and then they assigned employees to daily schedules and ﬁnally established a
revision process between the planning stages. Zolfaghari et al. (2007) developed
heuristics for shift assignment and scheduling for retailers.
Short-term instore logistics management plans the physical ﬂow of goods in
the stores to the shelves for actual delivery and reﬁlling needs. It includes short-
term planning of reﬁlling management and sequencing of shelf replenishment
jobs. The reﬁlling management determines the frequency for shelf inventory level
control and degree of re-picking and re-packaging in the backroom for example.
Shelf replenishment is a major cost driver of the entire SC (Thonemann et al.
2005), therefore reducing handling processes comes to the fore. Optimization of
instore logistics does not only start in the stores, but already at the picking at the
warehouses. Outlet-speciﬁc commissioning allows streamlining processes in the
outlets, as handling costs can be reduced. The sequencing determines how and in
which order incoming goods ﬂow from outlet ramp to shelves, e.g., how many
goods get simultaneously replenished, in which order and how priority rules for
shelf replenishment can be established. Hariga et al. (2007) and Abbott and Palekar
(2008) are modeling optimized shelf replenishment cycles.
However, the available literature on the planning for instore logistics manage-
ment is limited, as it focuses mainly on causal correlations (van Zelst et al. 2009).
Wong and McFarelane (2007) developed systematic means for describing different
shelf replenishment policies. McKinnon et al. (2007) analyzed root causes for out-
of-stock situations in forecasting, ordering and replenishment processes. Waller
et al. (2008) investigated the impact of the selected case-pack size on backroom
logistics and store-level ﬁll rates. Van Zelst et al. (2009) identiﬁed case pack
size, number of case packs replenished simultaneously, the ﬁlling system and the
employees as the most important efﬁciency drivers. All authors provide estimates
for the respective effects, but do not provide true optimization. This may be due to
the fact that short-term requirements for outlet inventory replenishment is mainly
customer-driven and thus ﬁnally exogenous, hence it requires master planning
concepts as provided above to anticipate consumer demand and replenishment
requirements.

Fig. 2.4 Retail demand and supply chain planning framework – detailed view
processes. Moreover, it highlights “white areas” where additional quantitative
models may help to improve planning processes.
Retail planning ranges from supplier to shopper. Consequently, the framework is
embedded into supplier interaction upstream the SC and needs to integrate consumer
interaction at the point of sales downstream the SC. The supplier-relationship
management and collaboration deals with long-term to short-term planning of joint
initiatives and communication channels, e.g., electronic data interchange, vendor
managed inventories or joint product development. For example, recent literature
examines the role of producers and retailers in product innovation (Ganeshan et al.
2007). Also, Groothedde et al. (2005) study the prospects to develop a collaborative
hub network, aiming to consolidate material ﬂows between manufactures and retail
distribution centers. Aydin and Porteu (2009) analyze the effects of manufacturer-
to-retailer versus manufacturer-to-consumer rebates in a supply chain. Kurtulus
and Toktay (2009) and Kurtulus and Toktay (2011) evaluate the role of category
captainship practices.
On the other hand, the presented matrix incorporates consumer behavior. The
consumer interaction at the point-of-sales affects the entire planning process.
Retailers need to integrate consumer trends, behavior and reactions into overall
operations planning. It requires an integrative approach that treats consumer demand
planning as part of the entire operations framework. Especially as decoupling is
located at the outlets, retail SC methods need to include also demand planning,
demand fulﬁllment and revenue management concepts (Quante et al. 2009). This
will be the focus in the following chapters.

Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
2.5
Aspects of Planning Interdependencies at Retail Shelf
Management
After constituting individual planning modules, now sequential and hierarchical
interdependencies along planning modules with quantitative approaches will be
illustrated for retail shelf management.
Sequential planning means that planning processes should consider the SC
from consumer to supplier as an entire system and taking into account the
interdependencies of various planning activities. Hierarchical planning describes
planning processes that consider the hierarchy of decisions and integrate them where
advantageous and feasible. Comprehensive quantitative decision support models
ensure tightly aligning retail shelf supply with consumer demand and leading to
efﬁciency gains for the entire chain. Some examples will illustrate this. The ﬁrst
ones describe a sequentially integrated retail logistics example, the second type
hierarchical interdependencies.
2.5.1
Example: Vertically Integrated Shelf Space
and Price Management
Retail outlet sizes and formats are determined on a long-term basis in the store type
and location planning. This sets the boundaries for a strategic layout planning of
how the instore infrastructure and the layout at all can be determined. The master
category planning then takes decisions on overall category selection, forecasting
individual category sales and plans assortment architecture and promotions. For
example, a retailer needs to decide how many categories should be listed in
a store, and how much space each should retain. Similarly, but on a more
granular level the decisions take place for individual products. The decisions are
arranged in an hierarchical sequence, but could potentially be solved integrated
as well. A decomposition of the decisions into subproblems and communication
ﬂows between sub-planning modules aligns the planning decision and information
ﬂows.
Examples of vertically integrated models are the following ones: Yin et al. (2009)
combine the planning problems of dynamic pricing and shelf space allocation. They
provide a game-theoretical model for a retailer with a limited inventory of a product
over a ﬁnite selling season. The authors show that the selection of a certain type of
inventory display format has an impact on the optimal markdown pricing strategy.
Another example is provided by Hariga et al. (2007). They introduce a model for the
determination of the optimal shelf space allocation and replenishment. The objective
is to decide on the optimal number of facings and replenishment time in order to
maximize the retailer’s proﬁt.
Similarly, the information ﬂows need to take place between lower modules, e.g.,
the forecasted sales need to be an instruction for store personnel planning and store
logistics planning.

Conclusions and Future Areas for Research

2.5.2
Example: Horizontally Integrated Retail Operations Form
Warehouse to Shelf
The planning modules need also be aligned along the supply chain. For example,
mid-term master planning needs to reﬂect interdependencies between warehouse,
distribution and sales for the determination of the order patterns. Often retailers
operate different ﬂow types from producers to the stores (e.g., direct store delivery
or central warehouse delivery). Products are segmented and allocated to ﬂow types
by speciﬁc logistical factors. Each segment requires the determination of an order
pattern (e.g., delivery every Monday – Wednesday – Friday). While retailers set
often segment-speciﬁc order patterns by simple rules (e.g., the higher the sales
volume of the store the higher the delivery frequency), analytical DSSs enable to
derive an outlet and segment speciﬁc cost minimum by focusing on the relevant
processes in the sequential areas of warehousing, transport and outlet (Sternbeck
and Kuhn 2010).
A further example for horizontally integrated planning is Bhattacharjee and
Ramesh (2000). They examine a multi-period retailing problem for a monopolistic
retailer dealing with a product with limited product life cycle. A model is presented
that optimizes dynamic pricing and ordering policies jointly. Tellis and Zufryden
(1995), as well, provide a model, which integrates dynamic pricing and ordering by
determining the optimal timing and depth of retail discounts.
These examples show the need for communication ﬂows and alignment between
individual planning modules. The communication ﬂows in form of instructions,
anticipations and feedback loops will be part of the further analyses in this work.
2.6
Conclusions and Future Areas for Research
The objective of the retail DSCP matrix is to give a general outline of the main
DSCP problems that are relevant for the majority of grocery retailers. This frame-
work can help to improve retailers proﬁtability with the proposed “more analytics
based thinking” (Kopalle 2010, p.118). This chapter provides a comprehensive
retail operations planning framework consisting of dedicated and coherent planning
modules. The framework structures planning problems and provides a state-of-the-
art overview of retail DSCP. The examples show the need to balance integrated
planning and true optimization with hierarchical and sequential planning aspects.
Further research opportunities are in the general application, the development of
speciﬁc DSSs and the implementation of advanced models in commercial software.
2.6.1
General Application of Retail DSCP Matrix
First of all, the list of DSCP problems in the architecture is potentially not complete.
Many retailers might be confronted with lots of other planning details depending on

40

Framework for Retail Demand and Supply Chain Planning
their individual situation. Additionally, planning problems and horizons may differ
in speciﬁc cases depending on the structural type. For example, if the marketing
strategy forces to change the store layout every few weeks, store layout planning
turns to a short-term problem. Secondly, the framework has been developed for
grocery retailing, but would need to be tailored to other consumer-facing industries,
e.g., fashion or pharmacies with speciﬁc planning requirements. Variations in the SC
networks, degree of SC control, geographical spread, relative logistics costs, level
of data and IT, as well as relative sophistication of service providers may result
in various focus areas (Fernie and Staines 2001). The concept should be generic
enough to cope with these variations.
2.6.2
Uniﬁed Modeling Structure
The architecture fosters the understanding of both horizontal and vertical planning
problems. However, it has also been shown that the implementation of hierarchical
planning structures can be difﬁcult in practice. Therefore, modeling the relationship
between hierarchical and adjacent levels is one of the main research opportunities
for implementing decision support systems (Zoryk-Schalla et al. 2004). An ana-
lytical hierarchical planning process will need to be developed and tailored to our
framework. A uniﬁed modeling structure would help to analyze the coordination
of the different levels and the interdependencies in decision-making (Schneeweiss
1998; Miller 2001; Schneeweiss 2003a,b; Stadtler and Kilger 2008; G¨unther and
Meyr 2009). Thus, Chap. 3 will provide a uniﬁed modeling structure for retail shelf
management.
2.6.3
DSSs for Dedicated Planning Problems
It has not been anticipated that the exposition of research topics is comprehen-
sively exhaustive. However, the mentioned literature indicates that the amount
and type of literature is different for each planning problem. For retail-speciﬁc
planning problems such as assortment planning, shelf space allocation or dynamic
pricing, there is a great amount of retail speciﬁc literature available. Other plan-
ning problems like demand forecasting and product ordering are deeply inves-
tigated, but since it is not only industry speciﬁc, the models are less focused
on retailing and the challenges there (e.g., non-stationary demand, seasonality,
unobservable lost sales). Future research could concentrate on developing further
DSSs for problems with currently less advanced models and by integrating retail
speciﬁcs. We will develop a capacitated assortment and shelf management model in
Chap. 4.

2.6
Conclusions and Future Areas for Research
41
2.6.4
DSSs for Interrelated Planning Problems
Future research areas concern the hierarchical and sequential planning, and the
use of comprehensive quantitative DSSs. The advances in IT and computation
technologies encourage enlargement of hierarchical planning over the entire SC
processes (Fleischmann and Meyr 2003). This requires a discussion of the pos-
sibility of decomposition and coordination of decentralized decision making and
analyzing the distribution of decision rights and information asymmetries within
the SC. The following areas illustrate ideas for developing more sophisticated
models. Considering the hierarchy of decisions would be beneﬁcial for example in
evaluating interdependencies between store layout, master category and assortment
planning, or between shelf layout and replenishment. Furthermore, considering the
SC from consumer to supplier as an entire system and taking into account the
interdependencies of various planning activities would be advantageous, e.g., for
connecting supplier selection with assortment management or joint optimization of
order patterns and shelf layout. We will analyze the effects of integrated shelf space
and inventory planning in Chap.5 and extension with pricing decisions in Chap. 6.
2.6.5
Implementation of Advanced Models in Commercial
Software Packages
The planning modules of the framework need to be transferred into software
modules for practical decision making. Practitioners favour user-friendly and
simplistic software tools. Here science and implementation show a big discrepancy.
Science focuses on the approach to integrate extensive interdependencies resulting
in complicated estimation requirements of parameters. Advances in scientiﬁc
modeling still need to demonstrate their implementation ability. The main barriers
and areas of investigation to retailers’ adoption are requirements for large item sets,
data availability, model complexity, difﬁculty of integration into existing systems or
cross-functional interfaces. We will therefore also review software applications for
retail shelf management in the following chapter.
Altogether, this shows that DSCP is very complex, but offers a lot of research
opportunities. The purpose of this chapter was to structure the problem for
researchers and retailers. By this, it will foster the development and dissemination
of DSS to retail practice. In the following chapter, we analyze empirical insights,
quantitative models and software applications for master category planning. We will
focus on the mid-term sales domain of the RDSCP-matrix.

and Software Applications for Master
Category Planning
3.1
Introduction to Master Category Planning
Several mutually reinforcing trends have made category management (CM) one of
the most critical marketing and operational decisions for retailers. German retailers
and consumer goods producers recently rated “optimization of product portfolio
and category management” the most important task for achieving performance
goals (Breuer et al. 2009). This is not surprising as shelf space competition in
retail stores is at an all-time high, driven by the competitive need to constantly
introduce new products. There has been signiﬁcant product proliferation since the
1990s (Greenhouse July 17, 2005). The average number of items in overall store
assortments increased by 30% between 2000 and 2009 (EHI Retail Institute 2010).
In confectionery,for example, the number of brands rose by more than 40% between
1997 and 2001, but overall volume by only 0.8% (Carlotti et al. 2006). Additionally,
most retailers suffer from decreasing space productivity. Gutgeld et al. (2009)
concluded that 19 out of 24 European retailers were unable to maintain their space
productivity.
The increasingly competitive environment, the growing need for operational
efﬁciencies and ever greater customer orientation are therefore forcing retailers to
develop efﬁcient decision support systems (DSS) for category planning. Retailers
are required to make a large number of mid-term CM decisions that include, above
all, which categories and products to offer, shelf space allocation, inventory levels
and replenishment cycles. Retailers need to resolve the conﬂict of ever-increasing
number of consumer goods with scarce shelf space and the high operational
costs relating to great product variety (Grocery Manufacturers Association et al.
2005; Desrochers and Nelson 2006; Gutgeld et al. 2009). Offering broader assort-
ments thus may limit the appropriate service levels and vice versa. However, the
continually increasing number of consumer goods is in conﬂict with the ﬁxed
and scarce resource of shelf space. Furthermore, as shoppers increasingly take
purchase decisions instore, retail marketers are diverting a growing proportion of

their marketing budgets from traditional out-of-store media advertising to instore
marketing (Chandon et al. 2009). Customers, additionally, have become more
exacting, demanding ever-increasing service levels, greater product choice and
lower prices (Agrawal and Smith 2009b). Despite heavy investment in point-of-sales
scanners and IT, retailers are still losing potential revenue due to their inability to get
the right goods to the right places at the right time (Zenor 1994; Basuroy et al. 2001;
Dhar et al. 2001; Friend and Walker 2001; Cannondale Associates 2003; Angerer
2006; Fisher and Raman 2010). The focus of this research is therefore to examine
retail category problems and DSSs that particularly enable retailers to identify which
products to offer, allocate shelf space, and determine restocking frequencies. These
planning questions are inevitably interdependent. For example, large assortments
drive lower inventory levels of individual items, which reduce the items’ visibility
on the shelves, increase the risk of stockouts and impose high restocking costs
due to the need for frequent replenishment (Campo and Gijsbrechts 2005; Curseu
et al. 2009; Mantrala et al. 2009). Consistent with previous research, these planning
questions are deﬁned as:
•
Assortment planning: Listing decisions based on consumer choice behavior and
substitution effects.
•
Shelf space planning: Facing and replenishment decisions based on space
elasticity effects, limited shelf space and operational restocking constraints.
It will be shown that these planning problems are not yet sufﬁciently and com-
prehensively integrated into commercial software systems and scientiﬁc models.
Substitution effects for unavailable items are investigated in assortment planning
models. Shelf space planning models deal with inventory- and facing-dependent
demand, but largely do not integrate substitution effects for items that are not in
the assortment. Most shelf models do not factor in latent consumer demand for non-
listed items. The commonly proposed method of handling delisted items is to simply
assume lost sales and no consumer substitution (see e.g., Hansen and Heinsbroek
1979; Corstjens and Doyle 1981; Abbott and Palekar 2008 and Hansen et al. 2010).
On the other hand, assortment models omit space elasticity effects and to a large
extent shelf space constraints, too (K¨ok et al. 2009).
The goal of this chapter is to identify and structure these relevant shelf planning
problems and their associated demand effects in mid-term master CM. It provides
a summary of empirical insights, commercial software systems and advances in
scientiﬁc modeling. These contributions are subsequently examined in relation to
each other, outlining discrepancies and areas of research.
The remainder is organized as follows. The second Sect. 3.2 sets the context
of CM. Section 3.3 identiﬁes the commercial software applications, while Sect. 3.4
speciﬁes research progress in assortment and shelf space planning. The concluding
Sect. 3.5, provides an outlook on further research areas and the discrepancies
between scientiﬁc modeling and retail practice.

3.2
Deﬁnition and Scope of Master Category Planning
We provide a comprehensive framework for the discussion, as most retail category
planning takes place from a functional perspective, i.e., item selection and space
allocation are made with limited regard to overarching strategies, cross-functional
implications or subordinated domains (Griswold 2007). Category planning is a
tactical decision as it leads to mid-term changes, e.g., in supplier selection and
shelf layout. It receives input from strategic planning and provides instructions to
operational instore fulﬁllment tasks (see Chap. 2). Master category planning entails
a series of hierarchical aspects:
Category sales planning includes a selection of categories, and demand fore-
casting for each. Category selection covers determining the set of categories, each
category’s share, and a master product program (see also Fisher and Raman 2010).
CM receives input from the overarching decisions of store conﬁguration, and sets
guidelines for subordinated planning problems.
Assortment planning involves (de-) listing products. When optimizing assort-
ments, it is essential to reﬂect consumer demand. The total demand for a product
consists not only of its own initial demand, but also the substitution by and
complementary demand for other products.
Shelf space planning assigns facing quantities to individual products under the
constraints of limited shelf sizes and restocking capacity.
Instore logistics planning is investigated as a dependent problem of assortment
and shelf space planning. Replenishment frequency impacts the entire shelf supply
and actual stock levels, which then inﬂuence consumer choice at the shelves.
Figure 3.1 guides the discussion, maps the supply- and demand-based inter-
dependencies, contributes to an integrated management approach, and creates
interesting opportunities for transferring insights from one domain to another.
Most retail category planning takes place from a functional perspective, i.e.,
item selection and space allocation are made with limited regard to overarching
strategies, cross-functional implications or subordinated domains (Griswold 2007).
This shows that efﬁcient DSS in CM are required to improve business perfor-
mance.

Popularity of Software Systems in Category Planning
Category planning can be a complex decision process, potentially involving thou-
sands of items requiring an integrated retailer, manufacturer and consumer per-
spective. Adequate IT systems should allow the gathering, preparing and analyzing
of category-relevant information and enable the category manager to evaluate the
category’s performance.With improving data mining and computation technologies,
software vendors are able to offer more category planning solutions, some of which

replace homegrown spreadsheet calculations with dedicated software applications
(Syring 2003; Griswold 2007; Mantrala et al. 2009; Retail Information Systems
et al. 2009). Hence, advanced analytical tools should allow higher decision quality
to be achieved.
Large enterprise software vendors provide comprehensive solutions focusing on
workﬂow and data integration, while specialized software companies concentrate on
a particular task in the planning process (Becker et al. 2000; Syring 2003; Griswold
2007). The focus in this subsection is on functional capabilities rather than workﬂow
and data management, as the most important applications can be integrated in
IT systems like SAP Retail or Oracle (Becker et al. 2000; Griswold 2007).
Furthermore, these systems do not comprise self-contained shelf and assortment
tools (Becker et al. 2000).
CM software applications offer a wide spectrum of productivity gains in handling
large data sets and deciding on multi-item problems with easy-to-understand rules.
However, the simplicity of decision making logic may not be sufﬁcient to motivate
retailers to invest in such a technology. This requires a closer look at the use of
such IT systems in practice. Historically, only a limited share of retailers have used
IT support in CM. The picture of IT support for retail CM shows large regional
differences. A.C. Nielsen (2004) reports that nearly all US retailers uses CM tools.
86% of US retailers use assortment planning tools and 81% apply shelf management
tools, whereas in Europe only a limited proportion of retailers use IT support in CM.
ECR Europe (2003a) and Schramm-Klein and Morschett (2004) found in 2004 that
64% of European retailers did not use any IT for assortment planning, and 69%

did not use any IT for shelf space management. More recently, Retail Information
Systems et al. (2009) reported a higher degree of IT use and planned investments:
For assortment planning, 45% have already up-to-date software in place or
currently upgrading, 14% have plans to invest. 57% have and currently implement
shelf space allocation tools, and also 13% will invest. 72% have and imple-
ment replenishment planning tools and 13% of the retailers will invest here
(Fig. 3.2).
This shows ﬁrstly that even through IT support for CM is more common at
retailers nowadays compared to 2004, a signiﬁcant share of retailers – 15–41% –
still do not use IT support at all. Secondly, it shows that around 1/8 of retailers plan
to invest in CM technology. It also reveals that the more operational the task, the
more likely they are to use IT support for their CM. Retailers still partially rely
on their own homegrown spreadsheet calculations for the more strategic task of
assortment planning.
3.3.2
Scope and Overview
The focus of IT support in CM lies in decision support for individual actions and
tactics. Retailers and producers use commercial DSSs to create assortment and
merchandising plans. The popularity of these applications is mainly due to their
simplicity for implementing decisions on a large number of items. The applications
of leading vendors are similar in their purpose, scope and decision logic, as they
have their origin and historical focus on shelf space planning. The applications
mainly differ in terms of support functions for data exchange, graphical interfaces
and output, and reporting functions. Table 3.1 provides an overview of available
applications based on Griswold (2007). Figure 3.3 outlines the match between
focused planning problems and featured vendor functionalities (Griswold 2007).
The strongest features of the vendors’ applications are highlighted.
In the following, the focus of our analysis will be on the leading three vendors in
assortment and shelf space planning. The functionalities of the tools of AC Nielsen,
MEMRB/ IRI, and JDA will be described.

Fig. 3.3 Retail category planning applications – vendors’ functionalities and strengths
Assortment planning tools like “Product Planer,” “Apollo Assortment Planner”
and “Efﬁcient Item Assortment” support item selection using cumulated customer
penetration, which attempts to increase assortment coverage. The tools analyze the

3.3
Software Applications for Master Category Planning
49
extent to which modiﬁcation of assortment plans impact consumer spending or
revenue increases. The tools lead the user through the decision process and structure
qualitative decisions on assortment planning.
Shelf planning applications like “Spaceman Suite,” “Apollo Professional” and
“Space Planning” visualize shelf planograms and support determination of the fac-
ing quantity and shelf position. By applying large-scale data-processing techniques
to existing sales and inventory, they serve to forecast future demand needs at a
store and item level. They turn deﬁned assortments into merchandising standards.
The main purpose is to simulate alternative item placements on-screen and the
related proﬁt analyses. The shelf arrangement can be reproduced and displayed at
the screen. The decision logic is based on key performance indicators (e.g., sales,
proﬁt) or a mixture of several of them. The tools allocate shelf space according
to simple heuristics like proportional-to-market share or proportional-to-proﬁt
share. Restrictions can be imposed such as minimum and maximum facings, shelf
availabilities in days, or service levels. The software visualizes shelf arrangements
of automatically generated planograms. The items are displayed graphically on the
screen, where either schematic or photorealistic views can be chosen. Placing an
item on the merchandise plan is effected by manual user selection. The software
systems provide various reporting functions, evaluate the outcomes, and assist in
deﬁning the actions that will produce the best expected results. Consequently, most
retailers “use them mainly for planogram accounting purposes so as to reduce the
amount of time spent on manually manipulating the shelves” (Dr`eze et al. 1994,
p.14).
All the applications are quite similar and allow the user to obtain successive solu-
tions, from simple shelf arrangements to automated shelf planograms. They create
realistic real-time pictures of the assortments without time-consuming computation
processes (Becker et al. 2000; Syring 2003; Lehnert and H¨uffner 2006; Griswold
2007).
The implementation of shelf management technology has led to signiﬁcant
beneﬁts with revenue increases of 10–20% through reallocation of space to higher
velocity items, reﬁned assortments that streamline store-stocking practices and
improve in-stock positions (Griswold 2007; Campillo-Lundbeck 2009).
3.3.3
Limitation of Commercial Software Applications
Commercial models are limited in their use of mathematical optimization and
incorporation of relevant consumer demand effects. No “real” optimization takes
place in the sense of proﬁt-maximizing shelf allocation (Zufryden 1986; Syring
2003; Irion et al. 2004; Hansen et al. 2010). The automatically generated shelf
recommendation based on a proportional rule is subsequently manually adjusted.
A heuristic approach involving a targeted, iterative search for the optimum can
only be conducted manually by repeatedly creating planograms. The concern
for simplicity and practicability in commercial applications results in suboptimal

50

Empirical Insights, Quantitative Models and Software Applications
solutions (Yang and Chen 1999). As mentioned in Levy et al. (2004), a basic
weakness of these simplistic rules is that they have nothing to do with the optimal
decision. Rather, these rules base their conclusions on what has been done in the past
(Kopalle 2010). A second drawback results from the failure to incorporate
consumer-based demand effects of shelf space on individual product sales and
substitution between products (Dr`eze et al. 1994; Irion et al. 2004). Griswold
(2007, p.1) concludes that: “While software vendors intend to build integrated
assortment and space planning functionality, progress is still needed before a
complete functional footprint can be developed to support the integrated business
process required by retailers.” Most CM vendors strive toward comprehensive
solutions with integrated planning of store type and layout, assortment, shelf space
and planograms. “However, retailers have not bought into the viability of a single
application. Because of this, the trend is best-of-breed point application selection,
with retailers accepting the burden of integration” (Griswold 2007, p.9).
Progress from research and retail is still needed to produce sufﬁciently integrated
solutions. Most shelf management vendors acknowledge the importance of various
planning concepts such as store type and layout planning, assortment planning,
space planning and planogram creation, plus maintenance. Retailers’ desire for more
capable tools could be satisﬁed by leveraging advanced mathematical modeling
techniques and the power of IT to efﬁciently and proﬁtably manage categories. We
therefore review in the following section advances in scientiﬁc assortment and shelf
management follows.
3.4
Scientiﬁc Models for Master Category Planning
Existing research addresses assortment and shelf space planning in different litera-
ture streams. Assortment planning is gaining increasing attention in the operations
research community due to recent publications on substitution models, whereas
shelf space planning has already been on the research agenda for the last three
decades (Table 3.2).
We will undertake our literature review from these two perspectives. Retail shelf
space models deal mainly with space-dependentdemand, but largely do not integrate
substitution effects for items that do not ﬁt onto the shelves. Consumer choice
effects for non-available items are investigated in substitution models. Substitution
models have a predominately stochastic nature, whereas shelf space models are
deterministic.

3.4.1
Assortment Planning Models
Assortment planning considers the question of which and how many different
products to offer (Mantrala et al. 2009). K¨ok and Fisher (2007) deﬁne retail
assortment planning as the process used to ﬁnd the optimal set of products to be
carried and set the inventory levels of each product. One main feature of assortment
planning is the integration of consumers’ willingness to accept a substitute when the
favorite product is not available.
3.4.1.1
Empirical Studies of Assortment Planning
The review of assortment optimization models is preceded by a summary of
empirical insights. Consumer reaction to assortment size remains unclear. On the
one hand, choosing among larger assortments might be demotivating for consumers.
There is empirical evidence that variety levels have become so excessive that
reducing variety signiﬁcantly increases sales (Sloot and Verhoef 2008). Iyengar
and Lepper (2000) suggest that consumers are more likely to purchase consumer
goods when offered a limited array of choices only. “When people have “too
many” options to consider, they simply strive to end the choice-making or deal
by ﬁnding a choice that is merely satisfactory, rather than optimal” (Iyengar and
Lepper 2000, p. 999). Dr`eze et al. (1994) indicate that product variance has reached
a saturation level. Dhar et al. (2001) conclude in a study with 19 categories in
106 US supermarkets that reductions in the assortment in staple categories result
in higher unit sales relative to competitors. Boatwright and Nunes (2001) found
that signiﬁcant item reductions (up to 54%) resulted in an average sales increase
of 11% across 42 categories examined, and sales growth in more than two-third of
these categories. On the other hand, Broniarczyk et al. (1998) found that consumers’
perception of assortment attractiveness increases with the expectation that the
preferred items are stocked, the more items are carried, and the more overall space
is allocated to the category.
Even if retailers could determine the optimal assortment mix for all individual
customers, it may be unproﬁtable to stock such an assortment. Therefore out-of-
shelf situations are a key reality, which needs predictions for consumer reactions.
Campo et al. (2003) point out that out-of-stock (OOS) substitution can be used as an
approximation for out-of-assortment (OOA) substitution. They report that although
the retailer losses in case of a OOA may be larger than those in case of an OOS (e.g.,
no postponement, permanent store switching), there are also signiﬁcant similarities
in consumer reactions and OOS reactions can be indicative of OOA responses.
Table 3.3 summarizes studies on substitution behavior. For example, Gruen et al.
(2002) and Corsten and Gruen (2003) examine consumer response to stock-outs in
a meta-study across eight categories at retailers worldwide. They report that 45% of
consumers substitute, i.e., buy one of the available items from that category, 15%
delay purchase, 31% switch to another store, and 9% do not buy anything.

The average potential for substitution depends on product, situation and con-
sumer characteristics (Helm and St¨olzle 2009; Helnerus 2009). Fitzsimons (2000)
concludes that substitution behavior is driven by the personal commitment to the
non-stocked item and the difﬁculties of switching initial choice. Xin et al. (2009)
deduce that sold-out products inﬂuence the consumer decision process twofold.
First, the situation creates a sense of urgency that impulses consumers to immedi-
ately purchase an alternative (“immediacy effect”). Furthermore, sold-out products
can enhance the perceived attractiveness of substitutes to the sold-out product.
However, these studies conﬁrm also that substitution behavior are immanent and
need to be reﬂected in assortment optimization.
3.4.1.2
Optimization Models for Assortment Planning
Even if retailers could determine the optimal assortment mix for all individual
customers, it may be unproﬁtable to stock such an assortment. Therefore out-of-
shelf situations are immanent. Studies show that between 22% and 84% of demand
can be substituted. These consumer reactions need to be reﬂected in assortment
optimization.
Rigorous analytical models have emerged as the most promising solutions
to many of these planning problems (Agrawal and Smith 2009b; Fisher and

3.4

Raman 2010; Kopalle 2010). The main body of literature on assortment models
based on substitution effects focuses on developing algorithms to deﬁne inventory
levels by stochastic demand. The most advocated solution procedure is based
on the Newsboy model. The most popular approaches for estimating demand
substitution in assortment planning are multinomial logit models (MNL) and
exogenous substitution models. Only these two model types have been used in
recent publications on assortment planning. The MNL is a discrete consumer
choice model that assumes that consumers are rational utility maximizers and
derives anticipations of consumer behavior. It is commonly used in economics
and marketing literature. Similarly, locational choice models are also utility-
based models. On the other hand, exogenous demand models directly specify the
consumer reaction and are mostly used in inventory models. Because of these
structural differences and different origins, the exogenous substitution models and
MNL models will be analyzed separately in the following subsections. A basic
model of each stream will be presented, followed by a review of related studies
and further developments.
A. Exogenous Substitution Models
Exogenous substitution models specify the demand directly for each product.
Consumers choose from an item set N D f1; 2; : : : ; i; : : : ; j; : : : ; Ig and if the
preferred item j is not available for any reason, an individual consumer might accept
another item i as a substitute according to a deﬁned substitution probability ji.
The probability of substituting from item j to i is speciﬁed by a substitution
probability matrix.

The parameter ji makes it possible to differentiate between items with varying
substitution rates. The exogenous demand models generally allow only one round
of substitution, and if the ﬁrst alternative is also not available, the sales are
consequently lost (Smith and Agrawal 2000; Netessine and Rudi 2003; K¨ok and
Fisher 2007; K¨ok et al. 2009; Y¨ucel et al. 2009). K¨ok (2003) shows that this is not
too restrictive.
Smith and Agrawal (2000) developed a probabilistic demand model capturing
substitution and deﬁning inventory levels with given shelf constraints. The multi-
item Newsboy inventory model sets the stocking level of each product to achieve
exogenously determined service levels for sequentially arriving consumers to
maximize total expected proﬁt. The probability function gi.Nz; C/ describes that

54
3
Empirical Insights, Quantitative Models and Software Applications
item i is demanded by the Cth arriving customer, either as an initial preference
or as a substitute, depending on the set of listed products indicated by vector
Nz D .z1; z2; : : : ; zi; : : : ; zI /. The binary variable zi denotes whether a product i
is listed (set to value 1) or delisted (value 0). The ﬁrst term in (3.2) denotes the
probability fi that an arriving customer will initially prefer item i. The second
term describes the probability that the customer will substitute their demand for
item j. The probability that item j is available when the Cth customer arrives is
expressed by aj .Nz; C/. This probability can be derived from a discrete, transient
Markov process formulation.

The model updates the inventory levels after each customer arrival. The terms
depend on the choice of previous customers and the number of substitution attempts
made by the customer. Since the determination of Gi and aj is complex, Smith
and Agrawal determine a lower bound Li.Nz/ for the demand probability. The lower
bound is achieved by considering only assortment-based substitution. That means
the lower bound is equal to the probability that an arriving customer initially
prefers item i and the substitution gains from delisted products (Li.Nz/ D fi C

ji/. They use the lower bound for the demand calculation on
the assumption that the number of arriving customers per cycle follows a negative
binomial distribution. The probability distribution  i .d/ determines the item is
demand including substitution effects, where d D 0; 1; 2 : : : denotes a random
variable of the demand.
The optimization problem is to maximize the expected category proﬁt

by determining the item stocking quantities qi, given by the vector Nq

The proﬁt consists of gross proﬁt from realized sales minus salvage costs and
lost sales. The item’s revenue is ri, the item’s unit costs are ci, and qi is the optimal
Newsboy stocking quantity to achieve the target stocking level. i.Nz/ denotes the
expected demand for item i given a certain set of listed items, denoted by Nz.

Smith and Agrawal (2000) propose an approximate solution with Lagrangian
relaxation using the space constraint. This is followed by a complete enumeration
for small item sets to deﬁne optimal stocking levels, and a linearization approxi-
mation for large item sets. Illustrative examples are used to obtain several insights,
such as that substitution effects can reduce the optimal assortment sizes, ignoring
substitution effects decreases proﬁt signiﬁcantly, and it may not be optimal to stock
the most popular item as a result of varying substitution relationships.
Rajaram and Tang (2001) analyze the impact of product substitution on retail
merchandising with a service-rate heuristic based on the basic Newsboy model.
They evaluate the impact of substitution on order quantities and expected proﬁts,
and show that substitution reduces shortages and overstocking costs. K¨ok and Fisher
(2007) also use an exogenous stochastic model and develop an estimation approach
using sales data from different stores. They propose an iterative optimization
heuristic for the joint inventory and assortment problem with out-of-assortment
(OOA) and out-of-stock (OOS) substitution assuming constraints of shelf space,
maximum inventory levels and order lead times. They integrate lost sales arising
from unmet demand into their objective function. Shelves are divided into facings,
but do not account for space elasticity. Shah and Avittathur (2007) study multi-item
inventories based on a Newsboy problem and propose a heuristic for assortment
decision and stocking levels. Y¨ucel et al. (2009) model an assortment and inventory
problem under consumer-driven demand substitution. They conclude that neglecting
consumer substitution, excluding supplier selection or ignoring space limitations all
have signiﬁcant impact on the efﬁciency of retail assortments.
B. Multinomial Logit Substitution Models (MNL)
MNL models use consumer preferences. These models have their origin in eco-
nomics and marketing literature, and have recently been applied to assortment and
inventory planning as well.
Van Ryzin and Mahajan [1999] study a static assortment planning approach,
where the demand derives from stochastic choice processes in which individual
purchase decisions are made according to a MNL random utility model. Their
objective is utility maximization in the setting of a Newsboy problem. They assume
identical costs c and identical prices r for all items. Listed items are denoted by
set N C and delisted items by set N . Thus, N C; N  2 N, N C [ N  D N and
N C \ N  D ¿. In addition, there is a no purchase option, denoted by i D 0.
Thus, N0 D N [ f0g contains all possible options. A customer chooses the variant
with the highest actual utility Ui among the set of available choices, fUi; i 2 N C
0 g.
However, the utility values are uncertain and vary from customer to customer due
to heterogeneity of preference among customers. The values are therefore random
with an expected utility value of ui, i 2 N0. Consumer preferences vi can then be
deﬁned by vi D eui =ı, 8i 2 N C
0 . The positive parameter ı reﬂects the heterogeneity
among the customers, with a higher value of ı corresponding to a higher degree of
heterogeneity.

The probability that a customer purchases item i can then be calculated as
follows: Ai

l, l 2 N , is added to N C, with N C

N C decreases. However, the overall probability (P
j 2N C
l Ai.N C
l /) that a customer
selects any item from set N C
l
increases. The authors assume that customers make
their product choice when they observe the assortment, and they are not faced with
OOS. Hence, Ai.N C/ is independent of the inventory level. The expected proﬁt ei,

where C is the mean number of customers visiting the store per period. Furthermore,
the cost function CF.:/ is assumed to be concave and increasing to reﬂect economies
of scale. The total expected category proﬁt e
….N C/ is the sum of item proﬁts. The
optimal assortment is a balance between including a new product that impacts total
category demand, but also increases the assortment cost. If the proﬁt gain of product
l is more than the sum of the proﬁt losses of the products in N C, then adding l
improves the proﬁt. The proﬁt impact (e

The ﬁrst term is the expected proﬁt from l 2 N C
l , and the term in brackets
accounts for the cannibalization losses and proﬁt gain by complementary effects
due to adding product l to the assortment. They use a quasi-convex function. Since
a quasi-convex function achieves its maximum at the end points of the interval, the
proﬁt gets maximized either by adding the product with the highest utility or by not
adding a further product to the assortment. Hence, the optimal assortment is always
in the popular assortment set (Smith and Agrawal 2000; Cachon et al. 2005; K¨ok
et al. 2009). This reduces the number of assortment combinations to be considered
from 2N to N.
The model considers OOA substitution and has been extended by OOS sub-
stitution in a dynamic model of Mahajan and van Ryzin (2001). They propose
a stochastic sample-path optimization method for multiple rounds of substitution.
The models capture the trade-off decision between larger assortments and increased
average inventory costs. Major drawbacks are that shelf capacity is not considered
and they use only identical prices and costs for all items. Hence, the theorem of
“optimal assortment D popular assortment” does not hold when products have
varying prices, costs, demand, product sizes or order quantities.
Cachon et al. (2005) extend van Ryzin and Mahajan (1999) and Mahajan and
van Ryzin (2001) with consumer research costs. Annupindi et al. (1997) describe
methods for demand estimates and substitution rates, and model consumer arrivals

in the context of vending machines. They derive maximum-likelihood estimates of
arrival and substitution rates via the expectation-maximization algorithm by treating
OOS as missing data. Hopp and Xu (2008) study dynamic demand substitution
analyzing inventory, price and assortment decisions in competitive scenarios. Gaur
and Honhon (2006) study consumer preferences based on a locational choice model.
They assume that under static, assortment-based substitution, consumers make
decisions independent of assortment availability. In contrast, in dynamic substitution
consumers purchase the highest-ranked product available at the time of their visit.

The exogenous demand model allows more degrees of freedom than the MNL
model. Since the options in the set of choices are assumed to be homogeneous, the
MNL model cannot capture the various types of adjacent, one-product, or intra-
subgroup substitution. The substitution rates in the MNL model depend on the
relative utility of the options. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage for
the MNL model. The advantage is that it allows one to easily incorporate other
marketing variables such as prices and promotions into the choice model. The
disadvantage is that it cannot differentiate between the initial choice and substitution
behavior. Unlike the MNL model, the exogenous demand model differentiates
between categories that have the same initial demand for the category but different
substitution rates. Thus, for example, the MNL model cannot treat assortment-based
and stock-out-based substitutions differently. In contrast, it is possible to use a
different j or different substitution probability matrices for assortment-based and
stock-out-based substitutions in the exogenous demand model (K¨ok et al. 2009).
The major criticism of the MNL model results from its Independence of
Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) property. “This property holds if the ratio of choice
probabilities of two alternatives is independent of the other alternatives in the choice
process (...) IIA property would not hold in cases where there are subgroups of
products in the choice set such that the products within the subgroup are more
similar with each other than across subgroups.”(K¨ok et al. 2009, p.109) If for
example the brand loyalty is high in an assortment with two products from different
brands, adding a new sub-brand to the ﬁrst brand will probably cannibalize the
sales of the ﬁrst brand more than the other second brand (K¨ok et al. 2009). The
introduction of Coke Zero as a brand supplement to the Coca Cola products is such
an example.
IIA does not allow to integrate this important aspect of consumer choice. The
example most used in the literature to explain this property is the “blue bus/red
bus paradox.” The example describes a person who has the same probability f of
using his car or of taking the bus: f fcarg D f fbusg D 1=2: We assume that
now there are two buses available that are identical except for their color, red or
blue. Further, we suppose that the person is indifferent about the color of bus it
takes: The choice set is fcar; red bus; blue busg. We would intuitively expect that
f fcarg D 1=2 and f fred busg D f fblue busg D 1=4: However, the MNL model
implies that f fcarg D f fred busg D f fblue busg D 1=3 (K¨ok et al. 2009).
The advantage of the exogenous demand models is that the substitution probabil-
ity matrix can take different forms to represent different probabilistic mechanisms.
The following examples illustrate the different forms of a four-product category
(Smith and Agrawal 2000; K¨ok et al. 2009).
A random substitution as in (3.7) allows random values for the substitution
probabilities ji for item substitution from j to i.

Retail assortment studies provide various heuristics for consumer-driven sub-
stitution. The exogenous demand and MNL models have different origins, but
allow the optimization of assortments. MNL models are more stylized from the
perspective of integrating consumer choice behavior, and allow structural properties
of the optimal solution to be obtained. The core assumption is that items can be
arranged by their popularity and the most popular items are in the assortment.
Smith and Agrawal (2000) show, however, that it is not always essential to list
the most popular item. The exogenous demand models are more ﬂexible, enabling
the depiction of more realistic inventory problems involving varying prices or
pack sizes for example. The studies have contributed to various directions, such
as supplier selection and pricing (see also Khouja 1999; K¨ok et al. 2009; Pentico
2008; Mantrala et al. 2009).
The average number of items used in the test cases of the proposed model is very
limited (29 items). However, grocery categories have an average of 60–80 items
within a category, meaning the practical relevance is limited (EHI Retail Institute
2010). Furthermore, only K¨ok and Fisher (2007) and Y¨ucel et al. (2009) include
scarce shelf space in the considerations, which is a dominant factor for assortment
considerations in the retail grocery. Y¨ucel et al. (2009) prove that space limitations
have a signiﬁcant impact on the performance of assortments. None of the studies
analyzed take into account the space elasticity effects of a higher number of facings.

Empirical Insights, Quantitative Models and Software Applications
Thus the following review will further focus on shelf space models with available
shelf space as a restriction, and with space-dependent sales effects.
3.4.2
Shelf Space Planning Models
An underlying assumption of shelf space management is that grocery shopping
behavior is susceptible to retailers manipulation. Better shelf display inﬂuences
shopper behavior, since the majority of consumers decides about their ﬁnal pur-
chases in the store (Hoch and Deighton 1989; Dr`eze et al. 1994; Xin et al. 2009;
Chandon et al. 2009). Consumers also exhibit a low level of involvement with their
instore decisions and make choices very quickly after minimal search (Hoyer 1984).
3.4.2.1
Empirical Studies of Shelf Space Allocation
A series of experimental studies quantiﬁed the relationship between demand and
facings, with a higher number of facings resulting in higher visibility, consumer
awareness and consumer demand. Shopper surveys (Inman et al. 2009) and ﬁeld
experiments (Hansen and Heinsbroek 1979; Corstjens and Doyle 1981; Zufryden
1986; Bultez et al. 1989; Dr`eze et al. 1994; Koschat 2008; Chandon et al. 2009)
conclude that a signiﬁcant relationship exists between space allocation and demand.
The degree of signiﬁcance depends on the type of items. Brown and Tucker (1961)
recognized increasing space effects from (1) the group of unresponsive, price-
inelastic products, to (2) general products for everyday purchases to (3) impulse
purchases. Curhan (1972) proved that fast-moving goods have a higher space effect
than slow-moving items.
Experiments for estimates of space elasticity deliver a “rules of thumb” of 0.2
as space factor, i.e., doubling the facing led to a 20% increase in sales (see for
example Dr`eze et al. 1994; Campo and Gijsbrechts 2005). Dr`eze et al. (1994) were
able to prove a 4% proﬁt increase through better managed shelf space, although
with diminishing returns for further increasing space. Desmet and Renaudin (1998)
calculate category space elasticity of up to 0:8. Their results show increasing space
elasticity with impulse buying rates, independent of the type of store. Koschat
(2008) shows that demand can vary with inventory, using the case of an US
magazine publisher. Chandon et al. (2009) demonstrate the effectiveness of instore
marketing efforts by varying number and position of shelf facings with brand
attention and evaluation at the point of purchase. Using an eye-tracking experiment,
they found that the number of facings has a strong impact on consumer attention.
Going from 4 to 8 facings increased the probability of noticing the item by 28% and
the probability of reexamining it by 40%. But adding additionally 4 facings only
added an extra 7% to noting and extra 19% to reexamination. They identify facing
variation as the most signiﬁcant effect among instore factors, even stronger than
vertical and horizontal positioning and pricing.

3.4
Scientiﬁc Models for Master Category Planning
61
Furthermore, shelf space allocation has a signiﬁcant impact on shelf replenish-
ment costs. Broekmeulen et al. (2006) show that instore handling costs amount
to 38% of operational logistical costs in the retail supply chain. They show that
shelf space allocation is not aligned with the replenishment regime. About 60% of
the items are temporarily underfaced, i.e., consumer demand is higher than shelf
supply, thus requiring frequent restocking. Curseu et al. (2009) derive a model for
estimating stacking time and instore handling costs. They identiﬁed case pack size
and consumer units as the key cost drivers. Van Zelst et al. (2009) conclude for
two different retailers that case pack sizes (and thus indirect facings) and the ﬁlling
regime may deliver proﬁt gains of 8–49%.
However, due to experimental complications within stores and high testing
costs, experiments to date have not been sufﬁciently extensive to provide robust
results (Abbott and Palekar 2008). Bultez et al. (1989) attribute weak results to
poor experimental design, low variation in space allocations and unreliable sales
data.
3.4.2.2
Optimization Models for Shelf Space Management
Proﬁt optimization models formulate the demand rate as a function of the shelf space
allocated to products. Space models cluster around the following three streams:
A. Space Allocation Models with Space-Elastic Demand
Common denominators of shelf space models are item is demand di as a function
of the space allocated to an item. The base demand is ˛i, ki is the number of
facings allocated to item i, bi is the item’s breadth, ˇi the (constant) space elasticity
expressed as a power function, and kmax

For the ﬁrst stream of space allocation models, a major study was published
by Hansen and Heinsbroek (1979). They formulate the total category proﬁt P as
a maximization problem, with the number of facings as a decision variable. The
vector Nk D .k1; k2; : : : ; ki; : : : ; kI/ denotes the facings values of the items. The
proﬁt depends on the demand and the item unit proﬁt pi.

algorithm is based on a generalized Lagrange multiplier technique, which is
generally only guaranteed to ﬁnd local solutions of non-convex programs. The
authors do not reﬂect cross-product relations as they predict problems in generating
data for cross-product relations and the practical implementation of solution
procedures.
Further developments in this stream are published by the following researchers:
Zufryden (1986) developed a dynamic programming formulation for a problem
with space elasticity and marketing variables. An interesting paper by Yang and
Chen (1999) assumes linear proﬁt within a constrained number of facings. They
formulate a shelf space allocation problem with vertical and horizontal space
allocation effects. Yang (2001) proposes a knapsack heuristic for the model. He
found an optimal solution only for simpliﬁed versions. Lim et al. (2004) build
on Yang’s work by optimizing with meta-heuristics. A hierarchical Bayes model
is proposed by van Nierop et al. (2006) to estimate interaction between shelf
layout, marketing activities and stochastic demand. They optimize with simulated
annealing. Murray et al. (2010) jointly model shelf space and pricing decisions
and solve the problem with an MINLP-solver. Hansen et al. (2010) investigate
meta-heuristics for decision models with facing-dependent demand and vertical and
horizontal location effects.
Major criticism arose from the fact that cross-space effects are not reﬂected
and heuristics are applied to ﬁnd near-optimal solutions. The following subsection
identiﬁes shelf space models reﬂecting cross-product relations.
B. Space Allocation Models with Space- and Cross-Space Elastic Demand
In an inﬂuential paper, Corstjens and Doyle (1981) suggest a method for allocating
shelf space to categories. They formulate a maximization problem based on individ-
ual and cross-product demand. They additionally include cross-space elasticity ji
in the demand calculation and procurement, carrying and OOS costs in the proﬁt
function. The demand function is constituted as follows:

(3.12)
The signomial geometric programming method optimizes shelf space for cate-
gories, but Borin et al. (1994) show that the solutions reported violate the constraints
in seven out of ten cases. In addition, the multiplicative model predicts zero demand
for a given category if the space of any other category is set to zero (i.e., ki D 0).
Further limitation lies in the narrow number of items, as the model is supposed to
optimize product groups rather than individual items.
Bultez et al. (1989) apply Corstjens’ model at brand level, assuming identical
cross-elasticity within product groups. Borin et al. (1994) extend the demand
function by differentiating the demand components. They describe unmodiﬁed,
modiﬁed, acquired and stockout demand. Modiﬁed demand arouses from instore
attractiveness of products. Acquired demand captures assortment decisions.

3.4
Scientiﬁc Models for Master Category Planning
63
Stockout demand arises when total demand exceeds shelf inventory and consumers
switch to other items. They assume constant market size and distribute the volume
of delisted items according to the market shares of remaining items. A simulated
annealing heuristic optimizes return on inventory. They consider substitution effects
due to temporary or permanent unavailability of products. However, besides the
exclusion of space elasticity, they also neglect operational costs. Irion et al. (2004)
further extend Corstjens’ model to a product level instead of category level. Demand
consists of space and cross-space elasticity. They consider purchasing costs, interest
rates and listing costs. The model chooses integer facings to optimize proﬁt under
shelf space and facing constraints. Using a linearization framework, they transform
the model into a mixed integer problem with linear constraints. Their approach
provides only near-optimal solutions with a posteriori error bound. They use a
ln-function for their linearization framework, which unfortunately does not allow
accounting for zero facing demand of delistings. The model requires a predeﬁned
assortment, given the latent consumer demand for delisted items. Gajjar and Adil
(2008) and Gajjar and Adil (2011) build on Irion’s study and develop a local search
heuristic.
However, none of the model presented reﬂect operational constraints of shelf
replenishment, which is part of the third stream:
C. Integration of Shelf Space with Inventory Problems by Modeling
Replenishment and Space Allocation
Most literature on retail shelf space management focuses primarily on the demand
side, and less on the cost side. However, retailers with limited space face a trade-off
of putting fewer items out for sale against keeping inventories of other prod-
ucts. Proper control of retail costs requires balancing warehousing, transportation,
inventory, shelf space and instore handling costs (Curseu et al. 2009; van Zelst
et al. 2009; Kuhn and Sternbeck 2011). Ketzenberg et al. (2002) demonstrate the
proﬁt effect of replenishment and case pack sizes on store space management
with a maximum proﬁtability point by relying on substitution to reduce space
requirements. Inventory systems are consequently included in space allocation in
a third stream of studies.
Urban (1998) provides the ﬁrst enhancement with available inventory and
replenishment systems. The deterministic, continuous-review model takes into
account inventory-elastic demand, since sales before replenishment reduce the
number of items displayed. Consequently, the effective shelf space assigned to
products diminishes until replenishment takes place. The item proﬁt i comprises
unit proﬁt pi less the ﬁxed costs of replenishment FCRi, inventory holding costs hi,
and listing costs LCi, in the case without front shelf depletion. Urban formulates
order quantity qi and facings ki as continuous decision variables.

D
PI
iD1 zi  i.Nq; Nk/. The binary variable
zi is 1 if a product is included in the assortment. The model also covers
restrictions in back room capacity, minimum order quantities and ensures that
replenished quantity meets demand. The problem is solved with a generalized
reduced gradient algorithm (GRG) and genetic algorithm (GA). He reports
that both heuristics signiﬁcantly outperform a proportional space allocation
rule, and the GRG yields solutions that are within 0.4% of the solution
obtained by the GA. The facings are continuous values and thus violate integer
requirements for the facings. They are rounded only afterwards to integer
values and may result in suboptimal proﬁt values. Further limitations are
in the restriction to individual product replenishment, but retailers normally
jointly replenish products because of joint delivery cycles from central ware-
houses.
Inventory control integration with space allocation is proposed by Hwang et al.
(2005). They optimize order quantity, facings and shelf positioning using a GRG
heuristic and a GA, but exclude assortment decisions. Swami et al. (1999) develop
an integer model for shelf space allocation in a movie shop. Hwang and Hahn
(2000) determine an optimal procurement policy for items with an inventory-
level-dependent demand rate and ﬁxed lifetime. The demand rate is assumed
to be a function of current inventory level, while each item has a ﬁxed expiry
date. Abbott and Palekar (2008) determine – exactly for a single-product case
and approximately for a multi-product case – the optimal replenishment cycles
for products given the costs of restocking and sales effects of inventory-elastic
demand. They formulate an economic order quantity problem with time-varying
demand. The optimal replenishment times have an inverse relationship to initial
space assignment and space elasticity. However, the model requires an initial space
assignment as input. It therefore does not optimize assortment and facing. A very
comprehensive study was carried out by Hariga et al. (2007). They propose an
optimization model to determine assortment, replenishment, positioning and shelf
space allocation under shelf and storage constraints. The decision variables are
display locations, order quantities, and the number of facings in each display
area. The non-linear problem could be solved exactly for a four-item case, but
requires a heuristic for a larger, practical case. They also omit integer facing
values. Ramaseshan et al. (2008, 2009) determine heuristic shelf space alloca-
tion, product assortment, and inventory quantities. Their model uses the GRG to
generate an approximate solution for up to 14 items (Ramaseshan et al. 2008).
The demand function requires k  1. H¨ubner and Kuhn (2011d) extend shelf
space management models via OOA substitution. They integrate demand estimates
for product delistings and the effect on other products. The model is capable of

3.5

dealing with large, realistic category sizes with up to 250 items using CPLEX.
Furthermore, the model reﬂects basic supply levels ensuring appropriate service
levels with limited replenishment capacity. A further development of the model
takes into account instore logistics costs and inventory holding costs (H¨ubner and
Kuhn 2011e).
Conclusions from the Review of Shelf Space Models
It has been shown that the models discussed address speciﬁc concerns of space and
inventory allocation. Furthermore, our discussion demonstrates that application of
the optimization models should lead to additional proﬁt gains over the traditional,
simplistic rules of proportional space allocation used in software applications, by
taking into account a broader perspective on relevant demand and cost effects.
Table 3.5 summarizes the major shelf space studies and structures them according
to key characteristics.
However, the models also have some limitations and drawbacks, such as only
near-optimal solutions by application of heuristics, only limited scope of products,
and the examination of product groups rather than individual products. There are
also complications in data estimates, especially with regard to cross-space elasticity
(K¨ok et al. 2009). Additionally, the different assumptions result in varying cost and
revenue integration. Not all studies take into account the operational costs of lower
facings, as fewer facings need to be restocked more frequently to serve consumer
demand. The third stream shows that some of the relevant costs are not actually
independent of shelf space allocation.
The biggest drawback of these studies is their limited applicability for assortment
decisions. The generally proposed method of handling assortment decisions and
latent demand for non-listed items (i.e., facing set to zero) is to assume no demand.
Thus, these models do not integrate latent consumer demand if a product is not
available in the shop, but in the shoppers’ mind, and the willingness to substitute
is there. Urban (1998) constitutes an exception by multiplicatively integrating
the substitution demand into the demand calculation. However, he omits integer
facing constraints and the numerical examples do not include assortment effects.
Furthermore, the publications on assortment planning calculate substitution demand
additively, rather than multiplicatively as proposed by Urban (1998). The determin-
istic models require that shelves are always stocked and OOS does not exist.
3.5
Conclusions and Future Areas for Research
This chapter structured commercial and scientiﬁc models in key CM areas and
elaborated the interrelations. In the course of the discussion it was identiﬁed that
decisions on assortment and shelf management relate closely, but are not intertwined

3.5.1
Alignment of Software Applications and Science
Practitioners tend to use simplistic software tools that can handle large-scale assort-
ments. Science and practice reveal a large discrepancy in this regard. Academic
models have greater analytic capabilities than available commercial software, yet
they still need to prove their implementation ability. Science focuses on the approach
of a large-scale integration of extensive interdependencies of demand, resulting
in complicated and expensive estimation requirements for parameters. However, a
major drawback is often the limited number of items that can be modeled. On the
contrary, retailers adhere to more strictly functional constraints in their operational
planning. Additionally, Borin and Farris (1995) show that managers tend to be
overconﬁdent in some aspects of their decision making because they underestimate
the range of possible outcomes. However, the extensive research into shelf space
management shows that the practical “rules of thumb” used in the commercial
applications can be improved.

3.5.2
Alignment of Assortment and Shelf Space Management
Research has developed advanced models in only loosely integrated research
streams of substitution and shelf space allocation. It has been shown that a wide
range of models already exists in the literature that focus on separate issues limited
to one area, treating related CM decisions as constraints, primarily modeling
demand-based interdependencies, and considering highly stylized problems with
very few items only. The literature on space elasticity deals mainly with space
effects on additional sales, but only Urban (1998) integrates substitution effects. The
substitution literature mainly covers stochastic effects in the case of stockouts, but
omits space limits or space elasticity effects. Y¨ucel et al. (2009) have already proved
that considering shelf space in assortment policies increases proﬁt and allows one
to build more realistic setups.
3.5.3
Alignment with Other Planning Objectives
Retailers are constrained in their shelf replenishment due limitations on the shelf
merchandizers available to immediately ﬁll the shelves after stockout and the
expensive handling costs within stores (Thonemann et al. 2005; van Zelst et al.
2009). Integration of replenishment constraints and non-linear shelf stacking costs
is required. Furthermore, a more comprehensive integration of consumer decision
processes and retail constraints may sharpen decisions. For example, McIntyre and
Miller (1999) evaluated the impact of joint pricing and assortment decisions. They
conclude that both pricing and assortment inﬂuence substitution and complementary
effects. Additionally, they perceive joint decisions in selection, pricing, and space
allocation as area of further research. Overall, however, none of the streams deals
with an integrated listing and facing problem that takes into account stochastic
demand, space-elastic effects and consumer-driven substitution, replenishment costs
and constraints, and reﬂects a planning hierarchy.
3.5.4
Alignment within Shelf Space Competition
A recent area of research is the analysis of effects in category captainship. For
example, Kurtulus and Toktay (2009) and Kurtulus and Toktay (2011) model
effects of retailer dominated CM vs. category captainship by manufactureres.
Mart´ın-Herr´an et al. (2006) and Mart´ınez-de Alb´eniz and Roels (2011) analyze
the competitive dynamics of pricing and shelf space assignment among competing
manufacturers at a retail outlet. A comprehensive study will need to adress all
relevant negotiation subjects between manufacturers and retailers, e.g., assortment,
prices and shelf space.

Summary
An ideal shelf space management model proposes a planning process and optimizes
assortment, space allocation and replenishment, taking into account
•
Instore demand functions based on space- and cross-space elasticity and substi-
tution effects for unavailable items.
•
Individual product proﬁtability covering price, unit costs, listing costs and
restocking costs.
•
Restocking and inventory constraints, and target service levels.
•
Actual problem sizes of a grocery category.
Considering these areas within an integrated framework and decision logic, or
even simultaneously if complexity allows, will foster: (1) discussion on solving
inventory and demand interdependencies; (2) the transfer of insights between
planning domains; (3) bridge the current gap between scientiﬁc modeling, practical
implementation and retail constraints.
The following chapter develops such a decision model for integrated assortment
and shelf space planning.

Chapter 4
Assortment and Shelf Space Planning
4.1
Introduction and Motivation
As we elaborate in Chap. 3, one of the core strategic decisions grocery retailers must
take involves determining their assortment and allocating it to the shelves. Retailers
need to match consumer demand with shelf supply by balancing variety (number of
products) and shelf service levels (number of items of a product). Offering broader
assortments thus limits the appropriate service levels and vice versa, as shelf space
is scarce. Retailers and producers try to satisfy consumers’ needs with the right
merchandise at the right store at the right time. However, the continually increasing
number of consumer goods is in conﬂict with the ﬁxed and scarce resource of
shelf space. Consequently, retailers need to make same-time decisions on which
products to offer (“listing”), and how much space to allocate for each product
(“facing”). A shelf management model needs to balance supply and demand effects,
as ﬁrstly listing decisions affect possible demand substitutions from delisted to listed
items. Secondly, facing decisions as space allocation impact the space-dependent
demand and the frequency of reﬁll operations. However, current space allocation
models mainly focus on demand modiﬁed by space effects, whereas substitution
models mainly cover out-of-assortment or out-of-stock effects, but do not consider
space effects and the additional effort required for reﬁlling depleted shelf inventory
between two basic replenishment periods.
Empirical studies demonstrate the impact of space on sales (see Sect. 3.4).
Chandon et al. (2009) reveals that facing variation is the most signiﬁcant instore fac-
tor – even stronger than positioning and pricing – using an eye-tracking experiment.
Although these studies give different estimates of space-elasticity, they all recognize
the positive impact of shelf space on demand and demonstrate that the sales increase
is subject to marginal decreasing return. Also, there is empirical evidence that
assortments have become so excessive that reducing variety signiﬁcantly increases
sales (Iyengar and Lepper 2000; Sloot and Verhoef 2008). Also, Dr`eze et al.
(1994), Iyengar and Lepper (2000) and Dhar et al. (2001) report a positive impact
of assortment size reductions and item delistings on demand. Boatwright and

Assortment and Shelf Space Planning
Nunes (2001) found that signiﬁcant item reductions (up to 54%) resulted in an
average sales increase of 11% across 42 categories examined, and sales growth
in more than two-thirds of these categories. Consequently, Grocery Manufacturers
Association et al. (2005), Griswold (2007), Christiani et al. (2009) and Campillo-
Lundbeck (2009) demonstrate the value of space management initiatives if they
reﬂect the relevant consumer demand types, instore logistics efﬁciencies and in-
stock positions. Therefore, shelf space management has received high priority from
retailers and researchers.
We propose an innovative application by integrating assortment and space
allocation simultaneously in one model. It combines the classic shelf space model
with consumer-driven substitution effects arising from delisted items. Second, a
minimum basic supply level is applied to ensure efﬁcient and feasible shelf inven-
tories, while providing an adequate consumer service level. Third, the suggested
modeling approach is able to solve problems related to real category sizes by
transferring the mixed-integer non-linear problem into a multi-choice knapsack
problem with predeﬁned demand values. These points are addressed in the context
of high velocity grocery store items. Grocery shopping has unique characteristics,
mainly arising from the product attributes of fast-moving consumer goods. The
permanent assortment is regularly re-purchased by shoppers and replenished by the
retailer.
The remainder is organized as follows. After setting the context in Sect. 4.2
and reviewing the respective literature on shelf space and substitution models in
Sect. 4.3, the model is developed in Sect. 4.4. Computational tests are presented in
Sect. 4.5. The ﬁnal Sect. 4.6 discusses the implication of the results on retail practice
and gives an outlook on further areas of research.
4.2
Problem Deﬁnition
We develop a model for determining the assortment and allocating shelf space for
a grocery category, taking into account space elasticity and substitution effects. The
optimization problem can be summarized with an objective function that maximizes
category proﬁtability using merchandising variables as the decision variables, and
incorporating shelf replenishment and various other constraints. We assume a
retailer who needs to select items from a set of i D 1; 2; : : : I items within a
category. Listed items are denoted by the set N C and delisted items by N . Thus,
N C; N  2 I, N C [ N  D I and N C \ N  D ¿. The total demand for a listed
item i (i 2 N C) depends on the number of facings k for all corresponding items and
substitution demand from the delisted items j (j 2 N ) to i. Substitution demand
is determined by the substitution intensity and the latent demand for delisted items
dj (j 2 N ). Category proﬁt depends on the demand realized, item proﬁt pi and
listing costs LCi. The decision model needs to determine the facings and listing of
each item to maximize total category proﬁt P under replenishment constraints. The
binary variable zi is set to 1, if an item is listed, otherwise to 0.

4.2.1
Properties of Demand Function
The demand of an item i is a composite function of basic demand as an estimate for
unmodiﬁed demand (˛i), space elasticity effects (ˇi), substitution effects (j, ji)
and lost sales from consumers unwilling to substitute (j). Table 4.1 summarizes
the modular demand effects.
4.2.1.1
Space-Dependent Demand
Common denominators of shelf space models are item demand rates as a function
of the space allocated to an item.
dik D ˛i  .k  bi/ˇi
k D 1; : : : ; K
i D 1; : : : ; I
(4.2)
The demand rate dik of the item i is a deterministic function of its displayed
front-row facing level k. In accordance with prior research, the space-demand
relationship ˇi is modeled with elasticity as a power function. The breadth of an
item i is given by bi. The set of facings is denoted by k D 1; : : : ; K.
The base demand ˛i is calculated as ˛i D dim= .bi  mi/ˇi to calibrate the
observed demand with the observed space effect. The observed (or forecasted)
demand dim of item i arose at observed facing level mi.
Single cycles are considered where prices and other marketing effects are
stationary. This also approximates the situation over multiple periods with aver-
age prices and constant marketing activities. Positioning, i.e., shelf layer, block
building or aisle location, has more of a qualitative character. These effects require
quantiﬁcations of shopping ways within the store, consumer search and category
roles (see for example in Dr`eze et al. 1994; Mantrala et al. 2009). Consequently,
these qualitative effects are not modeled under given demand and proﬁt assump-
tions.

4.2.1.2
Cross-Space Dependent Demand
Discussion on cross-space effects is ambiguous in the pertinent literature. On the
one hand, some shelf space models deal with the effects of cross-space elasticity as
proposed by Corstjens and Doyle (1981). This quantiﬁes the effects of neighboring
items j on the sales of an item i. On the other hand, Brown and Lee (1996)
and K¨ok et al. (2009) describe that there is no empirical evidence that product
level demand can be modeled with cross-space elasticity. Zufryden (1986) argues
that consideration of cross-elasticity at an individual level would be impossible
in practice due to the overwhelming number of cross-elasticity terms that would
need to be estimated. Also, the effects of cross-space elasticity measured appear
to have only limited inﬂuence on sales. However, we contribute to the discussion
by modeling the cross-space elasticity and analyzing the resulting effects with
respect to additional gains in objective value and the modiﬁed solution structure.
In this chapter we use an exogenous demand substitution matrix. It describes the
demand shifts between items related to the space allocation. These effects are
cannibalization and gains from other items or retailers. Using the parameter ji
reduces the data requirements from I K for all facing combinations to a matrix with
I 2 combinations.
4.2.1.3
Substitution Demand
Assortment decisions with limited space imply that potentially not all products can
be listed, or it may be more proﬁtable to list other products to force consumers to
switch to more proﬁtable substitutes. Substitution effects are hence an integrated
part of the model. We follow the general idea of the literature on inventory
management in using exogenous estimates. Every consumer chooses their favorite
item j from set I. If their favorite product j is not available for some reason,
probability ji predicts that a consumer will choose a second favorite i, i 2 N C.
The fraction of consumers who is willing to compromise their initial choice is
expressed in the probability of 1  j. Similar to the studies of Smith and Agrawal
(2000) and Y¨ucel et al. (2009), one round of substitution is allowed to listed items
(i 2 N C). If consumers want to substitute their ﬁrst choice with a product that
is not listed (i 2 N ), the sales are consequently lost. In accordance with Y¨ucel
et al. (2009, p.761), it is assumed that “if a product is not available (...), it is
substituted by another product or a lost sale occurs.” There is no attempt to model
individual consumer decisions, instead, an exogenous model is applied capable of
capturing aggregated consumer demand. This allows handling of the complexity
arising from multiple product relationships. The resulting model is cruder than some
other substitution models, but has the advantage of being much easier to analyze
and requires less data. The corresponding substitution matrix ji can be estimated
directly with market research as proposed by K¨ok et al. (2009).
A shortcoming of standard space models is the assumption of “zero” demand
when assigning “zero” facings for delisted items. Given that a latent consumer

4.2
Problem Deﬁnition
75
demand exists, i.e., consumers have products in their mind but cannot ﬁnd them
in the shop, the classic “zero-facing zero-demand” property omits substitution. It
is assumed that the demand for delisted items ranges from zero demand to the
demand for one facing. We therefore deﬁne the parameter j that gives the demand
at one facing which is still available at zero facings. The resulting demand is named
“latent demand”. This latent demand is expressed by

by 1  ˇj , i.e., the higher the space elasticity, the lower the demand for delisted
items.

The weight j is a percentage of the demand at one facing. j can be assumed
at 1  ˇj , i.e., the higher the space elasticity, the lower the demand will be assumed
at zero-facings. The following Fig. 4.1 illustrates this condition:

Instore Inventory Management and Shelf Replenishment
Broekmeulen et al. (2006) and Kuhn and Sternbeck (2011) show that instore
handling costs amount from 38% to 48% of retail logistics costs, often because
shelf space allocation is not aligned with the replenishment regime. About 60–70%
of the items are temporarily underfaced, i.e., consumer demand is higher than shelf
supply, thus requiring frequent restocking (Broekmeulen et al. 2006; H¨ubner and
Kuhn 2011e). Shelf space decision models often neglect this fact.

Assortment and Shelf Space Planning
We integrate operative replenishment requirements into the strategic model and
therefore introduce a “basic supply level” (BSL), which is a percentage of demand
that is covered by the basic ﬁlling process. The BSL allows operational ﬂexibility
at the shop ﬂoor level, but also limits reﬁll frequency and quantity. Disregarding the
reﬁll frequency (i.e., without the BSL) could theoretically result in all items having
a minimum number of facings and store merchandisers being permanently engaged
in reﬁlling shelves.
We prefer to follow actual retail practice by positing a joint replenishment
system: all items are replenished together at regular intervals using scheduled ﬁlling
with a ﬁxed quantity, e.g., before the store opens (van Ryzin and Mahajan 1999;
Smith and Agrawal 2000; K¨ok and Fisher 2007; K¨ok et al. 2009). In addition, we
assume that if the shelf inventory of a product is lower than the expected demand
between two regular reﬁll periods, the sales employees have to reﬁll the remainder
with extra efforts. It therefore seems more appropriate to apply a service level
constraint that ensures that the volume provided via the basic shelf ﬁlling processes
will satisfy a certain proportion of consumer demand. A BSL of 100% means that
total demand is fully satisﬁed by the scheduled basic stocking. A lower BSL requires
limited individual restocking. Figure 4.2 illustrates the space-dependent demand
curve, the space-dependent supply curve, and the basic supply level constraint at
a level of 80% of demand.
Common retail practice is to move items forward to the front row. This allows
modeling the demand for the front-row facings and not for the entire showroom
inventory. The replenishment system assumed avoids temporary stockouts and
partial shelf depletion. It also requires that showroom demand can be replaced
immediately with backroom stock. The showroom inventory system involves a set

of products with a display capacity S. Behind each facing are gi units of item i
that can be stored in the shelves. As fast-moving consumer goods are high-velocity
items and retailers want to have high inventory levels in the showroom, interest rates
are assumed not to be decision-relevant. Applying capital costs would need to cover
not only showroom storage, but the entire supply chain.
4.3
Literature Review of Assortment and Shelf Space
Planning
This literature review is approached from the perspective of our problem setting of
integrated assortment and shelf space management, and relates to the replenishment
system described. An extensive literature review is given in Chap. 3.
4.3.1
Assortment Planning Models
The literature on assortment planning models focuses mainly on deﬁning inventory
levels in the event of stochastic demand. Pentico (2008), K¨ok et al. (2009) and
Mantrala et al. (2009) additionally provide literature reviews. Either exogenous
demand or utility-based models are used to estimate consumer-driven demand
substitution (K¨ok et al. 2009).
Exogenous demand models: Inventory models apply mainly exogenous demand
estimates (see Netessine and Rudi 2003; K¨ok and Fisher 2007). Consumers choose
from an item set I, and if the preferred item is not available for some reason,
an individual consumer might accept another item as a substitute according to a
predeﬁned substitution probability. These models generally allow only one round
of substitution. If the alternative product is also not available, the sales are lost
(Smith and Agrawal 2000; K¨ok and Fisher 2007; Y¨ucel et al. 2009). Smith and
Agrawal (2000), Rajaram and Tang (2001) and K¨ok and Fisher (2007) analyze
product substitution with heuristics based on the newsboy model. Y¨ucel et al.
(2009) study an assortment and inventory problem under consumer-driven demand
substitution.
Utility-based models: In multinomial logit (MNL) models, consumer choices
have recently been applied to assortment and inventory planning problems as well.
Annupindi et al. (1997) model consumer arrivals in the context of vending machines.
Van Ryzin and Mahajan (1999) and Mahajan and van Ryzin (2001) maximize
consumer utilities based on a newsboy problem. Demand is independent of number
of facings. Identical prices and costs applied for all items. Cachon et al. (2005)
extend these models with consumer research costs. Identical prices are relaxed in
the paper of Bish and Maddah (2004), whereas dynamic demand substitution is
formulated in Hopp and Xu (2008).

78
4
Assortment and Shelf Space Planning
MNL models are more stylized for integrating consumer choice behavior.
Exogenous demand models are more ﬂexible and allow accounting for more realistic
inventory problems involving for example varying prices or pack sizes (K¨ok et al.
2009). However, these assortment models do not integrate space-elastic demand
and shelf space limits. Only K¨ok and Fisher (2007) and Y¨ucel et al. (2009) include
scarce shelf space in their considerations and provide evidence of the impact of
space limitations. Y¨ucel et al. (2009) prove the signiﬁcant impact of shelf space on
the performance of assortments. High substitution and the costs of lost sales result in
extended assortments, increased service levels and reduced proﬁts due to increases
in operational costs. Non of the models described, however, take into account space
elasticity effects. Furthermore, taking into account latent consumer demand for non-
available items requires a demand estimate for these items, as substitution increases
demand for the listed and faced items. We thus extend our review to shelf space
planning models.
4.3.2
Shelf Space Planning Models
Shelf space models formulate the demand rate as a function of the shelf space
allocated to products. Hansen and Heinsbroek (1979) and Yang (2001) study shelf
space allocation with demand as a function of space allocation for individual
items. Corstjens and Doyle (1981) additionally include cross-space elasticity ji
in the demand calculation (see (3.12)). However, the multiplicative model predicts
zero demand if one facing is set to zero. The model does not provide integer
solutions as requested in such problems. Borin et al. (1994) show that the solutions
reported violate the constraints in seven out of ten cases. The narrow number of
items is a further limitation, as the model is supposed to optimize categories rather
individual items. Borin et al. (1994) differentiate demand into unmodiﬁed, modiﬁed,
acquired and stockout demand. Modiﬁed demand arises from instore attractiveness
of products. Acquired demand captures assortment decisions. Stockout demand
arises when the total demand exceeds the shelf inventory and consumers switch to
other items. The authors assume a constant market size and distribute the volume
of delisted items according to the market shares of remaining items. Besides the
exclusion of space elasticity, they also neglect operational costs. Syring (2003)
ampliﬁes this with a set of logic decision rules as constraints. An interesting
paper by Irion et al. (2004) extends the modeling to product level instead of entire
categories. Using a linearization framework, they transform the model into a mixed-
integer problem. Their approach provides near-optimal solutions with a posteriori
error bound, but does not allow accounting for delistings. Gajjar and Adil (2008)
build on Irion et al. (2004) and develop a local search heuristic. Ramaseshan et al.
(2008, 2009) determine space allocation with a gradient search heuristic.
Finally, Urban (1998) and Hariga et al. (2007) integrate shelf space effects into
inventory decisions. Both formulate the order quantity and facings as continuous
decision variables, thus violating the integer constraint for the facings. Restriction to

4.4
Formulation of the Capacitated Assortment and Shelf Space Problem (CASP)
79
individual product replenishment represents a further limitation. However, retailers
normally jointly replenish products because of joint delivery cycles from the central
warehouses. The model of Hariga et al. (2007) is only capable to handle four
items. Similarly, Hwang et al. (2005) optimize with a gradient search heuristic
and a genetic algorithm for order quantity, facings and shelf positioning. The
optimal replenishment cycles are determined exactly for a single-product case and
approximately for the multi-product case by Abbott and Palekar (2008). However,
Abbott and Palekar (2008) do not consider facing allocation.
Four main limitations can be identiﬁed: (1) only near-optimal solutions by using
heuristics, (2) limited scope of products, (3) complicated data estimates, especially
for cross-space elasticities, and (4) the fact that assortment decisions are largely
disregarded. The generally proposed method for handling delisted items (i.e., facing
set to zero) is to assume no demand.
To summarize, current retail shelf space literature does not simultaneously
integrate space effects and substitution effects for the demand of delisted items,
with respect to the actual replenishment system. The shelf space planning models
deal mainly with space-dependent demand, but mostly do not integrate substitution
effects for delisted items. The assortment planning models investigate substitution
effects for unavailable items, but without space-depended demand and mostly
without regard to limited shelf space. In the following section, we will develop such
an integrated model of assortment and shelf space planning.

Objective Function
In this section we develop a MIP model that addresses the shelf space management
problem. The objective is to maximize category proﬁt P , which is comprised of total
direct proﬁt (TDP), total substitution proﬁt (TSP), total cross-space proﬁt (TCSP)
and total costs of listing (TCL):

Total Direct Proﬁt (TDP)
The demand function (4.2) is used to precalculate the demand dik for each possible
integer facing level k of each item i. The MINLP can be degenerated into a bounded
0=1 multi-choice knapsack problem by precalculating all integer demand values, as
there is a set of i D 1; : : : ; I items, and each i is associated with size bi, proﬁt
pi and a knapsack with capacity S. The decision variable yik selects the most
proﬁtable item-facing combination from the set of available items I and facings K.
The bounded knapsack model decides how many facings of each item have to be

the demand at one facing and j the percentage of this demand that is latently. The

(4.11). However, since d N 

and d N C

may take positive values even so item i is
not listed (zi D 0) it is necessary to ensure the validity of the constraint for delisted
items by adding a large number on the right side, e.g., the maximum demand of

Numerical Examples and Test Problems
Three test cases are applied to assess the performance of the shelf space model. The
ﬁrst test shows the need to integrate substitution in the space management decision
in a simpliﬁed example with three products. The second test shows the impact on
objective values, solution structure and calculation times with varying substitution
levels, number of items and facings. Then, error bounds are provided for parameter
estimates and managerial decisions using sensitivity analyses. Finally, we show test
results for a large-scale problem. The optimal objective value P was found using
CPLEX v11.1. All tests were run on an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU P8400 2.26 GHz
processor with 4 GB RAM.
4.5.1
Illustrative Example for Impact of Substitution
The following example illustrates the need for simultaneous assortment and space
optimization in retail settings. The main difference between retail and other
industries is the inability to directly control substitution behavior. Retailers can only
steer consumers to higher margin products through the assortment they choose to
stock; consumers must then at least partially transfer their demand.
In the following illustrative example, we assume a latent consumer demand for
three products with d1 D 13, d2 D 5, d3 D 4, space elasticity of 0.2, unit proﬁts
of p1 D 9, p2 D 7 and p3 D 6 and listing costs of LCi D 15. All products have
identical item sizes and only three slots in the shelf are available. Capacity per slot
is 10 units.
The pure shelf space optimization without substitution results in P D 104,
consisting of TDP D 1491 and TCL D 45. All three items are listed with one
facing (ki D 1/.
The integrated model works as follows. The cross-product substitution (ji/
like in Table 4.2 reﬂects consumer choices if products are out-of-assortment.
The probabilities reﬂect the case that the main product i D 1 receives higher
substitutions than the fringe products i D 2 and i D 3. j reﬂects the fact that
consumers are partially not willing to compromise their initial choice. j is set to
1.0 to simplify the illustrative example.

Figure 4.3 exempliﬁes the changes in shelf layout for the two models. The model
lists k1 D 2, k2 D 1 and delists item 3 with k3 D 0. The optimized proﬁt adds
up to 164 with a TDP D 169, TSP D 25 and TCL D 30. This is a 58% increase
over the model without substitution. Thus item 1 proﬁts from space effects with
additional facings and cross-product substitutions, leading to a higher demand for
the high-margin product. Including substitution integrates consumer decisions more
accurately and impacts objective value. Joint assortment and space decisions lead to
a higher shelf utilization, which increases from 63% to 76%.
4.5.2
Test Case for Hard Knapsack Problem
Five additional test examples are applied to assess the performance of the shelf space
model. The ﬁrst test shows that the integrated model improves objective values and

84

Assortment and Shelf Space Planning
that the model can be applied for practical category problems. The second analyzes
the need to integrate substitution in the space management decision by the proﬁt
and solution analyses. We then show the rationale for the BSL constraint before
analyzing the impact of cross-space effects on total proﬁt and solution structure.
Finally, error bounds are provided for parameter estimates using sensitivity analyses.
4.5.2.1
Description of Test Case
Data Applied in Test Case
We use demand data observed at a retail outlet within adjacent categories for the
test cases. Proﬁts are simulated to achieve correlated proﬁt-weight combinations to
test hard knapsack problems. The approach of applying such problem instances is
similar to that adopted by Yang (2001) and Lim et al. (2004). The space elasticity
is ˇi D 0:2. An exogenous substitution estimate is applied, representing – at an
aggregated consumer level – the share substituted for the ﬁrst favorite in the base
scenarios. The substitution intensity to the ﬁrst alternative item is 0.5, to the second
0.2 and to a third 0.1. The share of lost sales is j D 0:2 and j D 0:8. The
cannibalization volume cannot exceed the demand for the items affected. We also
apply bounds on the number of facings. The lower bound kmin
i
(upper bound kmax
i
)
is set 25% (400%) of the observed facings m. A BSL D 0:8 is applied, so that
maximum of only one reﬁlling during the period is allowed, and less than 20% of
the total demand needs to be reﬁlled during the day (Table 4.3).
The literature review shows that the scale of currently available shelf space
models is restricted to a very narrow number of items. We would like to overcome
this problem and allow the computing problem sizes faced by a retailer. For instance,
a hypermarket carries approximately 35,000–50,000 items within 600 categories,
i.e., the average number of distinct items in a category is around 60–80 (EHI
Retail Institute 2010). Direct information from retailers suggests that there are no
categories exceeding 200 items. One should note that the scale of our problem
depends on the values of two variables: number of items (I) in the category and
number of facing levels (K). Problem cases are chosen that include very high values

proﬁts than the pure shelf space models (CSP and CSPCR) due to the directly
integrated substitution. Transformation into a knapsack problem makes it possible
to calculate optimal solutions time-efﬁciently for the problem being considered. The
extended model is capable of handling even a large number of items and all relevant
category problem sizes with very fast computation time.
Impact of Integrated Assortment and Shelf Space Planning
Over Industry Practice
In the next test we compare the performance of models with BM with varying
substitution intensity. All optimization models signiﬁcantly outperform the BM by
a 5–10% higher proﬁt. The left side of Fig. 4.5 shows the changes in the total proﬁt
deriving from increasing substitution intensity in a test with 50 items and up to 10
facings. It reveals that the integrated models (CASP and CASPCR) also achieve up
to 1.7% higher proﬁts than the pure shelf space models (CSP and CSPCR). In the
case without cross-space effects, the increasing substitution intensity compensates
for suboptimally allocated facing and assortment decisions. In the case with cross-
space effects, disregarding TCSP in the BMCR decision logic erodes the proﬁt base
due to high cannibalization, leading to higher proﬁt gaps compared to CASPCR and
CSPCR.
The optimization models not only result in higher proﬁts but also signiﬁcantly
change the structure of the result, i.e., characteristics of the decision variables. The
optimization models allocate signiﬁcantly different facing levels to the items. The
right side of Fig. 4.5 shows that up to two-thirds of the items may be non-optimally
allocated by the BM. Furthermore, the integrated assortment decision results in
dependence on the substitution level in up to 40% different facing values for the
items compared to the pure space models.

Further Managerial Insights
Impact of the Basic Supply Level
The BSL ensures that total demand can be fulﬁlled with the inventory available. Not
reﬂecting the BSL constraint results in high restocking requirements. Figure 4.6
shows the trade-off decision for applying a BSL, with BSL D 100%. Disregarding
the BSL increases the proﬁt by 1–8%. However, between 67% and 87% of the items
receive to less facings. That means that without the BSL, not the entire demand
for more than two-thirds of the items can be fulﬁlled with the inventory available,
and therefore frequent restocking activities are necessary. Thus, a retailer needs to
carefully plan the replenishment frequency and BSL.
Impact of Cross-Space Effects
If there are cross-space effects, they need to be integrated into the decision calculus.
Not integrating cross-space effects (TCSP) into the objective function of the
decision models would result in up to 2% lower proﬁts. The facing allocation would
be more erroneous. In this case up to 44% of items receive inappropriate facing
levels (see Fig. 4.7).

Sensitivity Analyses of CASP
A multitude of parameters need to be estimated. Errors and deviations cannot easily
be excluded, therefore this subsection evaluates the impact of these parameters
on the results of the model using sensitivity analyses. The parameters for space
elasticity (ˇi) and substitution levels (ji) are estimated through consumer experi-
ments and thus by their nature may deviate from real consumer behavior. The basic
supply level and total shelf space are managerial decisions determined by different
overarching parameters like store sizes, marketing activities, and category plans.
Figure 4.8 shows the analyses with varying substitution levels and space elasticity. It
shows moderate impact on both the decision structure and proﬁt sensibilities. Proﬁt
sensitivities are between 1:1% and C3:0% compared to the base value. Up to 30%
of the decision variables may change. The higher accuracy in estimating consumer
behavior requires expensive consumer research. These sensitivity results provide
business with boundaries to consider investing in understanding more accurately

space has been allocated. The level of the BSL constraint has a limited effect on the
total proﬁt level, but on the space decision. It shows that a comprehensive planning
framework and hierarchy would facilitate the accuracy of decision making.
4.5.3
Applicability of CASP for Large-Scale Problems
As computation time depends on facing and items, the following numerical example
analyzes the computation time for a simulated test case with 10,000 items. The
objective of this subsection is to analyze the computation times for a larger data
sets such as an entire store. For simplicity’s sake substitution is only allowed
according to market shares, as a direct exogenous estimate of the substitution
item by item appears difﬁcult for larger data sets. Hence estimation of substitution
volume proceeds as follows:
An alternative way to estimate substitution, especially for larger item sets is to
apply probabilities with proportional market shares (see Smith and Agrawal (2000)
and Irion et al. (2004)). It redistributes additional demand in proportion to the item’s
market shares. The proportional substitution matrix has properties that are consistent
with what would happen in a utility-based framework such as the MNL model:
ji  jl, if di  dl (see proof in K¨ok and Fisher 2007). di describes the market
share of product i and the denominator is the remaining share.

Equation (4.17) represents the substitution proﬁt for the market share
logic, whereas a substitution matrix is more suited for smaller cases with
fewer items, which still allows estimating product-by-product the substitution
probabilities, (4.17) ﬁts for larger item sets. MSj is the market share of the receiving
item i, and consequently the share of of substitution from item j to i. Other data
are distributed as in previous tests. Cross-space elasticity is not taken into account.

The objective value increased with substitution by 7%. The computation times
show that the extended model is capable of handling even large number of items
like entire store settings. Times are much lower where an endogenously estimated
substitution matrix is used. Thus, fewer cross-product references accelerate the
computation time here even when optimizing for entire stores with 10,000 items.
The computation times for a category case remains within reasonable time bounds
for the strategic problem (Table 4.5).
4.6
Conclusions and Future Areas for Research
The model described extends shelf space models by substitution effects and replen-
ishment constraints. It is based on consumer decisions affected by space effects
and substitution. The operational constraints ensure that shelf space decisions are
aligned with the retailer’s replenishment policy. Additionally, this approach provides
results for retail-speciﬁc category problem sizes within reasonable computation
times. We also provide a realizable approach for the modeling of cross-space
effects.
Overall, integrating substitution in the objective function not only improves
the accuracy of the model, but also allows better objective values to be achieved.
Standard retail data have been mainly used, such as observed sales, which are
available at a store level and have been supported by experimental data. The model
has been tested with correlated proﬁt-to-weight data to test hard knapsack problems.
Numerical examples prove that the model has the ability to compute all practical
cases, as realistic grocery category sizes do not exceed 200 items.

4.6
Conclusions and Future Areas for Research
91
Limitations of the model provide input for further areas of research: (1) supply
assumptions (2) demand generating effects, and (3) certainty of demand data. (1)
The model assumes ﬁxed restocking costs. These costs could be speciﬁed in more
detail, i.e., quantiﬁed by the optimal restocking cycles that would result from an
integrated supply model. Furthermore, retailers may also distinguish between group
and individual product replenishment. Out-of-stock substitution does not occur as
efﬁcient instore logistics are assumed. However, adding restocking process costs
would lead to a situation where it might be more beneﬁcial to save on stocking,
instead allowing substitution of other products. The model assumes unlimited
transportation, warehouse and backroom capacity, as only showroom effects are
considered. Additionally, aspects of a planning hierarchy as input to managerial
constraints and enlarging the scope up the supply chain will gain additional insights.
(2) Marketing activities and demand-generating effects should be also investigated.
These particularly include positioning effects to account for different shelf layers
and “eye-level” demand, price effects with price and cross-price elasticity, and other
marketing variables that generate instore demand. (3) Finally, consumer demand is
assumed to be deterministically known, but is subject to certain volatility depending
on external factors like season, temperature or weekday. Assuming stochastic
demand would add an important and realistic modeling feature.
In the following chapter, we address additionally the inventory and replenishment
costs for assortment and shelf space planning.

Assortment, Shelf Space and Inventory
Planning
5.1
Introduction and Motivation
Retailers need to cost-efﬁciently manage the complexity of satisfying consumer
demand with shelf inventory by determining the interdependent problems of
assortment size, shelf space assignment and shelf replenishment. Retail shelf space
assignment has demand and inventory effects, as already Whitin (1957) noted: “For
retail stores (...) an increase in inventory may bring about increased sales of some
items. On the other hand, an increased inventory might lead to a decrease in sales
of other items.” Hence, the more space and inventory is assigned to products, the
higher the demand (= space-elastic demand). Furthermore, retailers need to solve
the trade-off decision of either holding too much inventory, resulting in tied capital,
or keeping an inventory that is too low, requiring frequent restocking. Retailers
are constrained in shelf replenishment due limitations on the shelf merchandizers
available to immediately ﬁll the shelves after stock out and the expensive handling
costs within stores (van Zelst et al. 2009). Proper control of retail costs requires
the balancing of inventory, shelf space and instore handling costs (Curseu et al.
2009), especially as up to 48% of total logistics costs accrue in stores (Ketzenberg
et al. 2002; Thonemann et al. 2005; Broekmeulen et al. 2006; Sternbeck and Kuhn
2010). For example, van Zelst et al. (2009) conclude that case pack sizes and the
ﬁlling regime may deliver proﬁt gains of 8 to 49%. While there is evidence of
consumer response and cost implications, “less is known about how to translate
this evidence into proﬁtable strategies” (Kopalle et al. 2009, p.62). As we will see in
the literature review, traditional shelf space management models focus on the space
assignment and assume “efﬁcient inventory management systems.” In other words,
they decouple the decision of shelf space assignment from replenishment, as most
optimization models focus primarily on the demand side and less on the cost side.
In addition, they assume that each product is restocked instantaneously and individ-
ually. Common practice in retail, however, is to conduct two types of shelf reﬁlling:

Assortment, Shelf Space and Inventory Planning
•
Scheduled basic group ﬁlling of products jointly by dedicated merchandizers,
e.g., daily before the store opens. This is limited to a ﬁxed weekly schedule.
•
Individual concurrent reﬁlling of single products by sales staff, e.g., during their
idle time. Sales staff concurrently monitor shelf inventory, and instantly reﬁll
when inventory drops below a minimum level.
These different reﬁlling processes also have cost implications. Scheduled basic
group ﬁlling is more cost efﬁcient as low-cost merchandizers jointly restock
products, whereas the individual concurrent reﬁlling is operated individually for
each product, and by the more expensive sales staff. Current shelf management
models, however, do not differentiate between these two types of shelf ﬁlling
processes.
A further complication is that most retailers mainly plan shelf space from a sales
perspective, instead from an integrated sales and logistics perspective. Retailers usu-
ally adopt commercial shelf space planning programs for creating their planograms.
These tools visualize shelf space arrangement, and report product sales and proﬁt
for example. In the past, actual decisions were made by simplistic allocation rules
like proportional-to-sales and a limited number of manual adjustments. Advances
in computing resources should now allow the development of more complex shelf
space management models that are more consistent with consumer instore behavior
and required retailer planning aspects in instore logistics. Category managers from
both retailers and consumer goods producers can use shelf space models to improve
their decision making.
The goal of this chapter is therefore to propose an extension of shelf space
management models by including restocking aspects in decision calculus. It fol-
lows the guidance of Hadley and Whitin (1963, p.21) that, “the purpose in
constructing a mathematical model of an inventory system is to use it as an
aid in developing a suitable operating doctrine for the system.” The optimization
model ensures efﬁcient and feasible shelf inventory, clariﬁes restocking require-
ments, and allows the resolution of retail-speciﬁc problem sizes. It captures
the critical decision trade-offs faced by retailers in aligning marketing-related
demand effects and instore logistics-related cost effects. The planning problem
will be structured, a decision support model will be provided to maximize cat-
egory proﬁt taking into account replenishment requirements, and the capability
of this model will be tested to solve a category-speciﬁc problem. Speciﬁcally,
this chapter extends the CASP by integrating restocking and inventory holding
costs.
The remainder is organized as follows. The ﬁrst Sect. 5.2, establishes the context
of the decision problem and Sect. 5.3 provides a literature review. Section 5.4
develops the model, including the inventory management implications, the objective
function, and alignment with hierarchical planning. Section 5.5 provides numerical
examples. The ﬁnal Sect. 5.6, concludes the chapter and the main results and
potential extensions to the model will be discussed.

5.2
Problem Deﬁnition
This section develops a model for determining the assortment and allocating shelf
space within a fast-moving retail category, taking into account replenishment cost
implications. The optimization problem can be summarized with an objective
function that maximizes category proﬁtability using merchandising variables as the
decision variables, and incorporating various constraints. Consider a retailer that
needs to select items from a set of i D 1; 2; : : : I products within a category, and
where demand di depends on number of facings ki and the substitution demand ji
from item j to i for delisted items. Furthermore, the category proﬁt depends on item
proﬁt pi, costs of reﬁlling, and overstocked inventory. q.u/
i
represents demand that
needs to be reﬁlled during the day as overall demand exceeds basic shelf supply, and
RFCi stands for the associated reﬁlling costs of item i. q.o/
i
represents overstocked
inventory, ci the unit purchase costs, and h the interest rate.
The category manager needs to decide about the facings from the demand and
replenishment perspective of each item to maximize the category proﬁt P .

Demand takes into account ˇi space elasticity and ji substitution effects for
delisted items. Other marketing effects such as shelf positioning and prices are
assumed to be constant. The basic constraints are: store shelf capacity, product
availability, lower and upper bounds on facings. Consistent with prior research,
immediate replenishment is applied to avoid temporary stock outs.
5.2.1
Inventory Management Systems and Cost Implications
This subsection completes the assumptions of the inventory management system.
The showroom inventory system involves a set of products with a display
capacity S. The usual retailer practice is to move items forward to the front row.
This results in a model with demand depending on facings. It is assumed that
retailers employ an effective logistics system that ensures that demand required in
the showroom can be replaced immediately with stock available from the backroom,
i.e., shortages are not allowed (Hansen and Heinsbroek 1979; Corstjens and Doyle
1981; Urban 1998; Hariga et al. 2007; Abbott and Palekar 2008; Hansen et al. 2010;
Murray et al. 2010).
Two types of reﬁlling are applied, the scheduled basic group ﬁlling and the
individual concurrent reﬁlling. Figure 5.1 illustrates the space-dependent demand
and supply curves for one item. Note that supply is calculated as .ki  gi/, with gi
being the capacity in units behind one facing, e.g., it can be an entire case pack.
The example below shows that for k D 1, reﬁlling is required three times, as

the maximum facing-shelf capacity is less than 50% of demand at this facing. As
only limited sales staff time can be allocated to shelf ﬁlling, the reﬁlling process
needs to be limited. The application of the basic supply level (BSL) constraint
restricts solutions to more cost-efﬁcient supply-demand relations, as supply points
are only allowed that are above a certain BSL to avoid situations, where items
are permanently underfaced (see Broekmeulen et al. 2006). The BSL needs to be
achieved by the regular shelf ﬁlling process, whereas sales staff needs to fulﬁll only
the residuum during the day. This avoids high restocking requirements between the
scheduled basic ﬁlling cycles. The entire demand can be fulﬁlled by items available
on the shelves, i.e., by basic ﬁlling (i.e., BSL) and partial reﬁlling (i.e., 1  BSL).
Furthermore, shelf space management with respect to replenishment require-
ments reﬂects the costs associated with undersupplied volume or overstocked
inventory. If supply is lower than demand, as for k D 2 in the example, additional
individual reﬁlling of single products by sales staff needs to be applied. If supply is
higher than demand, as for k D 3 in the example, then part of the inventory always
remains on the shelves, and resulting in permanently invested capital.
Figure 5.2 illustrates the development of shelf inventory levels and the associated
reﬁlling processes according to the relationship between supply and demand.
Accordingly, either demand exceeds supply or vice versa. If demand exceeds
supply then the insufﬁcient basic supply requires reﬁlling between periods, or –
if the contrary applies – overstocked items increase capital employed. The third
possibility, where demand matches the basic supply q.b/
i
exactly, is only theoretically
possible, as supply is based on entire shelf slots.
Basic restocking costs do not depend on the number of facings. They accrue for
all items during the basic group ﬁlling process. Individual reﬁlling of faster-selling

items is carried out by the sales staff during the day, i.e., when demand is higher than
basic supply. While basic group ﬁlling costs are not dependent on facings, and as
a result are not decision-relevant for the problem, individual reﬁlling requirements
are variable costs that depend on the facings.
Interest rates are not applied on products sold between restocking cycles. This
would be against retailers’ overall target of having full shelves as an image factor
to attract customers. Hence, retail showroom shelves are not designed to be “lean
warehouses.” The entire supply chain rather than only the showroom inventory
would need to be reﬂected to generate inventory holding cost reductions, i.e.,
warehouses, distribution and stores. As long as the model assumes that sufﬁcient
inventory for immediate shelf replenishment needs to be located in the backroom, it
does not matter from a capital investment perspective whether inventory is located
in the backroom or showroom. Furthermore, fast-moving consumer goods as high
velocity items have very limited storage duration in the showroom.
5.2.2
Properties of Demand Function
The demand is formulated as in Chap. 4 and (4.2). Hence, demand for an item i
is a composite function of basic demand ˛i as an estimate for unmodiﬁed sales,
ˇi for space elasticity, ji for substitutions from j to i, and j as the share of
consumers not willing to substitute. Table 4.1 summarizes the modular demand
effects. Note that here we do not model cross-space effects as we focus on the
analysis of replenishment effects.
5.3
Literature Review of Shelf Space and Inventory Planning
The planning areas considered are assortment and shelf space planning. Assortment
planning is the listing decision based on consumer-choice behavior and substitution
effects. Shelf space planning is the facing and replenishment decision based on

98
5
Assortment, Shelf Space and Inventory Planning
space elasticity effects, limited shelf space and operational restocking requirements.
This section will show that demand-side-related shelf space management models
treat supply-side-related considerations as exogenous parameters. The models
further assume predeﬁned assortments, with the exception of Urban (1998) and the
CASP-model in Chap. 4, as all the others omit substitution effects for non-available
items.
A ﬁrst major study was published by Hansen and Heinsbroek (1979). They
formulate the proﬁt P as a maximization problem, with the number of facings as
the decision variable under the constraint of limited shelf space. The proﬁt includes
facing-dependent demand and item proﬁt pi (MaxŠ P.ki/ D PI
iD1 di.ki/  pi).
The authors use a Lagrange multiplier to solve the problem, but do not reﬂect on
cross-product relations. They further apply ﬁxed replenishment costs, which are
not dependent on the facing decision. Further, Zufryden (1986) and Yang (2001)
study shelf space allocation with demand as a function of individual items’ space
allocation. In a second stream of model types, Corstjens and Doyle (1981), Borin
et al. (1994), Bultez et al. (1989), Lim et al. (2004), Irion et al. (2004), Hansen et al.
(2010) and Murray et al. (2010) develop space allocation models with demand as a
function of category and individual item space allocation.
One drawback of the existing models is that they give no explicit consideration to
inventory-related decisions. Some include an operating cost factor that assumes that
costs are proportional to the sales of the product (Urban 1998). However, these costs
are independent of inventory levels and restocking frequency. The only operational
constraints these studies take into account are limited shelf space and limits on the
number of facings.
However, retailers with limited space face a trade-off of either reducing assort-
ment size and increasing inventory levels of remaining products, or increasing
assortment size and reducing the number of facings, which may require more
frequent restocking. Consequently, in a third stream of studies, replenishment
considerations are included in space allocation models.
Urban (1998) provides the ﬁrst enhancement with inventory and replenishment
considerations. He takes into account inventory-elastic demand, since sales before
replenishment reduce the number of items displayed. Consequently, the effective
shelf space assigned to products diminishes until replenishment takes place. The
proﬁt maximization model comprises unit proﬁt less ﬁxed order cost FOCi,
inventory holding cost, with h as interest rates and ci unit costs, and reﬁlling costs
RFCi. T is the period, the order quantity qi is the decision variable, and eq is the
average inventory in the backroom and showroom, including shelf depletion with
an inverse space elasticity.

This model is extended to a multi-product assortment and shelf space allocation
problem. The model also covers restrictions in backroom capacity and minimum
order quantity. Urban solves the problem with a genetic algorithm. However,

5.3
Literature Review of Shelf Space and Inventory Planning
99
the performance of the heuristic has only been compared to proportional space
allocation rules, and the model does not allow group replenishment of items, as
only instantaneous individual restocking is assumed.
Hariga et al. (2007) determine assortment, replenishment, positioning and shelf
space allocation under shelf and storage constraints for a limited problem size,
but omit substitution effects. The decision variables are display locations, order
quantity, and the number of facings in each display area. The complex mixed-integer
non-linear problem could be solved exactly for a four-item case, but according to
the authors would require a heuristic for a larger, practical case. Furthermore, they
omit integer facing values.
Abbott and Palekar (2008) formulate an economic order quantity problem,
exactly a single-product case, and approximately for a multi-product case, deter-
mining the optimal replenishment cycles for products given the costs of restocking
and the sales effects of inventory-elastic demand. The optimal replenishment time
has an inverse relationship to initial space assignment and space elasticity. However,
it requires an initial space assignment as input. Thus, it does not optimize assortment
and facing.
Y¨ucel et al. (2009) analyze an assortment and inventory problem under
consumer-driven demand substitution. They conclude that neglecting consumer
substitution and space limitations has a signiﬁcant impact on the efﬁciency of
assortments. However, they do not include space elasticity effects.
The CASP-model in Chap. 4 complements a shelf space management model with
out-of-assortmentsubstitution. We integrate demand estimates for product delistings
and the effect on other products. It has been demonstrated that the model is capable
of dealing with large, realistic category sizes. Furthermore, the model reﬂects
basic supply levels, ensuring appropriate service levels with limited replenishment
capacity.
A detailed discussion of shelf space models can be found in Chap. 3. Also, further
literature on inventory-level-dependent demand problems is provided by Urban
(2005). He distinguishes models in which demand rate is a function of the initial
inventory level, and models in which it is dependent on the instantaneous inventory
level. The ﬁrst is closer to space allocation problems, while the second relates to
newsboy and assortment problems. Table 5.1 summarizes the main differences in
the models reviewed related to shelf space and inventory problems.
Broekmeulen et al. (2006) report that shelf space allocation is often not aligned
with the replenishment regime. About 60% of the items are temporarily under-
faced, i.e., consumer demand is higher than shelf supply, thus requiring frequent
restocking. Shelf space decision models often neglect this fact by assuming
efﬁcient replenishment systems and disregard instore logistics. Traditionally, space
allocation has more a strategic character, whereas replenishment decisions treated as
operational problems. So far, shelf space models abstract from retail requirements
in their replenishment assumptions.
Usual practice of retailers is to conduct joint replenishment of products, e.g.,
in the morning before the store opens (Smith and Agrawal 2000; K¨ok and Fisher
2007). With item-speciﬁc demand rates, joint replenishment implies stock outs

between replenishment cycles if some items are sold faster than stocked. To avoid
lost sales, sales employees also reﬁll any shelf gaps that arise between the scheduled
basic ﬁlling cycles. The above-noted models assume efﬁcient restocking and omit
restocking capacity constraints. They apply instantaneous and individual restocking,
i.e., as soon as an item runs out of stock, retailers immediately reﬁll the empty shelf.
In particular, these models do not differentiate between scheduled basic group ﬁlling
processes and individual concurrent reﬁlling during the day, although basic shelf
ﬁlling is completed by more cost-efﬁcient merchandising systems, and reﬁlling by
the sales workforce. The sales staff reﬁlling is more expensive as it (1) accrues for
individual products and not efﬁciently in product groups, and (2) it is conducted by
more expensive sales staff.
In this research, the following three important elements are integrated into
the basic shelf space decision model: (1) assortment decisions with substitution
effects for delisted items; (2) basic supply level constraint to limit number of reﬁlls
and (3) introduction of group reﬁlling processes and differentiating the associated
restocking costs of individual and group reﬁlling.

Objective Function
Objective is to maximize product category proﬁt. The total proﬁt P consists of TDP
(total direct proﬁt), TSP (total substitution proﬁt), TCL (total costs of listing), TCUS
(total costs of undersupply) and TCOI (total costs of overstocked inventory).

5.4.1.1
Total Direct Proﬁt (TDP)
The total direct proﬁt covers the proﬁt of items regardless of their relation to the
remaining assortment. The demand (4.2) is used to precalculate the demand dik for
each item i and its associated facing level k. This preprocessing enables transfer
of the non-linear demand function into a 0=1 multi-choice knapsack problem where
the binary variable yik selects the most proﬁtable item-facing combination for a
knapsack of the shelf size S, the item size bi, and pi as the item’s gross proﬁt.

Total Substitution Proﬁt (TSP)
The total substitution proﬁt integrates substitution proﬁt through demand shifts for
delisted items. The term .j dj1/ symbols the latent demand for delisted items, with
j expressing a share and dj1 the demand at one facing. The substitution matrix
ji integrates transition probabilities between items j and i. The binary variable zi
indicates whether an item is listed (set to 1) or delisted (set to 0).

The constraints are composed of hierarchical planning aspects and modeling

available space S can be distributed. (5.11) sets boundaries on the number of facings
(kmin

), and for example enforces minimum listings. (5.12) ensures that the
scheduled basic reﬁlling frequency RF is sufﬁcient to meet a deﬁned basic supply
level (BSL) and only the remaining demand needs to be reﬁlled during the cycles.

Numerical Examples and Test Problems
The following section illustrates the above-noted optimization model by solving a
test example of a grocery category. The mixed-integer model features an objective
function with linear constraints. The case examples will show that the computation
time remains within reasonable time bounds.
Subsection 5.5.1 provides an overview of the test example, followed by the
analyses of impact on total proﬁt level in 5.5.2 and inﬂuence on solution structure in
5.5.3. Subsection 5.5.4 provides error bounds for parameter estimates and impact of
hierarchical planning decisions with sensitivity analyses of the test example. In the
ﬁnal subsection 5.5.5, the model is tested with a large test case of a category with
200 items. The ﬁnal test will evaluate the solution performance with a commercial
solver and its applicability to other category sizes.
5.5.1
Description of the Test Case
5.5.1.1
Data Applied in Test Case
This section uses test problems with a wide range of parameter values for the
computational experimental set-up. To investigate the effects of the problem, data
from a single category are analyzed. The model requires retail outlet data as sales
data, items facings, and the available shelf space. Item-speciﬁc data are item prices
and costs, listing costs and item sizes. Ranges and constraints need to be determined
for facings and basic supply levels. Real data from a single category of a retailer are
used.
The experimental setting consists of 25 consumable products representing the
entire product category. We use annual demand ﬁgures. The products are located
within one shelf and regularly reﬁlled, where RF D 300. The basic supply level is
supposed to satisfy 50% of demand needs, i.e., only one additional reﬁlling during

the period is possible. Listing also needed to be included for required changes at the
shelf layout. The space elasticity is assumed to be the same as it was in prior research
(e.g., Hansen and Heinsbroek 1979; Yang 2001), i.e., ˇi D 0:2 and consequently
j of 0:8. An exogenous substitution estimate is applied. The substitution shares
are applied that the ﬁrst alternative receives 50% of the substitution volume, and
the second alternative 30%. The total substitution volume is limited to PI
j D1 ji C
nj D 1, with nj D 0:2. Up to ten facing levels are allowed in the test. The data
applied are summarized in Table 5.2.
5.5.1.2
Comparison of the CASRP Solution with Other Approaches
The objective value of the Capacitated Assortment, Shelf space and Replenishment
Problem (CASRP) as presented in subsection 5.4 is compared with (1) a Base
model (BM), and (2) a Capacitated Assortment and Shelf space Problem (CASP)
as presented in Chap. 4:
•
(1) The BM represents a lower bound of the objective value by applying the
proportional-to-sales allocation rule, as it is usual in planogram software pack-
ages like “Apollo” or “Spaceman”. Restocking-dependent costs are calculated
a posteriori based on the speciﬁcation of the decision variables. Additionally,
substitution demand for delisted items has been redistributed to other items
according to the provided rules in the test description.
•
(2) The CASP solution is a shortened form of the objective function which does
not take into account TCUS and TCOI. The replenishment and inventory costs
are calculated a posteriori.

Proﬁt Impact of Integrated Assortment, Shelf Space

The test cases with 25 items demonstrate the proﬁt impact compared to current
industry practice, and the beneﬁt of an integrated restocking and shelf space model.

Fig. 5.3 Proﬁt impact of integrated assortment, shelf space and inventory planning
The total proﬁt increases by 17.5% compared to industry practice, which could
be quite substantial in low-margin industry retailing. The CASP model optimizes
only for listing and spacing, and reﬂects restocking requirements with basic supply
level constraints, i.e., supply costs are not part of the objective function. Here, the
test case shows a posteriori calculated raising over- and undersupply costs of the
items. Disregarding reﬁlling costs in space allocation results in partially frequent
restocking requirements for some items and neglecting inventory holding costs
results in high overstocks for other items. Therefore, both TCUS and TCOI are
higher for the CASP model and the total proﬁt is 4.4% lower (Fig. 5.3).
5.5.3
Impact on Solution Structure
The numerical example also show that the solution structure (i.e., facing levels)
changes signiﬁcantly. 56% of the items receive different facing levels in the
optimized CASRP model compared to the lower bound.
The integration of restocking and inventory holding cost considerations impacts
not only the total proﬁt, but signiﬁcantly changes the structure of the result as well,
i.e., characteristics of the decision variables. Figure 5.4 summarizes the differences
of the decision variables for each item. In comparison to the lower bound, applying
a pure assortment and space optimization (CASP model), 44% of the items get
different facing values assigned compared to industry practice. That means also,
that the proportional rule assigns non-optimal facing values in around 50% of

the cases. Integrating additionally the restocking implications as in the CASRP
results in 56% of the items requiring different facing values compared to the lower
bound.
Comparing the CASP model with the CASRP model shows the following results:
Around 28% (7 of 25) of the items get different facing values. First of all, the
integration of inventory holding costs forces to avoid high overstocked inventory.
Figure 5.5 shows the four items where the facings levels decrease from ﬁve to four.
There have been at k D 5 higher overstocked inventory levels.
Reducing the space of this four items creates space for other items. The
CASRP model lists three more slow-mover items with a better supply-demand ratio.
Figure 5.6 shows the demand- and supply-curves of the additionally listed items.
Here the number of facings increase from zero (i.e., delisted) to one facing. In all
three cases the facing-dependent supply and demand points are quite close and a
limited volume need to be reﬁlled.
5.5.4
Sensitivity Analyses of CASRP
A multitude of parameters need to be estimated. Errors and deviations cannot
easily be excluded, so the impact of these parameters on the results of the model
is evaluated using sensitivity analyses. In this subsection, sensitivity analyses are

108

Assortment, Shelf Space and Inventory Planning
relative to base proﬁt, with no changes in the parameter values. The impact of
hierarchical planning decisions, inventory-related costs and consumer behavior is
investigated.
5.5.4.1
Hierarchical Planning Aspects
The determination of total shelf sizes and basic supply levels are managerial
decisions based on hierarchical planning aspects. The variation in total shelf size
signiﬁcantly impacts objective value and restocking costs, as illustrated in Fig. 5.7.
Reducing the shelf space by 25% results in a 31% lower overall proﬁt. This is based
on a lower proﬁt due to lower sales, and especially the high costs of undersupply.
The undersupply costs increase exponentially with high restocking requirements of
low shelf sizes. Changes in the basic supply level have only a moderate effect on
total proﬁt by increasing the levels. Increasing the BSL level results in situations
where a certain demand can no longer be satisﬁed, and so forces a change in shelf
layout. Lowering the levels has a very limited proﬁt effect, as a similar number of
reﬁlling processes are still required as in the test example.
Going forward, such sensitivity analyses can be used as feedback on the
overarching planning question of total shelf space, and input to the subordination
planning of basic shelf supply level for instore planning. A comprehensive planning
framework and hierarchy facilitates the accuracy of decision making in retail sales
planning as in Chap. 2.

5.5.4.2
Inventory-Related Cost Parameters
The restocking costs need to be estimated using empirical studies, such as a time and
motion observation of individual reﬁlling processes. Interest rates signal opportunity
costs. Although the replenishment costs have a signiﬁcant impact on solution
structure and overall proﬁt, the variation in inventory-related cost parameters has
a very limited impact on objective value. Higher or lower reﬁlling costs and
interest rates impact the total proﬁt relative to the base proﬁt by only C0.4% to
0.2%. Hence, the low proﬁt sensitivity would also allow the use of cruder cost
estimates.
However, variation in reﬁlling costs impacts the listing decision. At ﬁrst glance,
the results on the right-hand chart of Fig. 5.8 for absolute proﬁt impact by variation
in the reﬁlling costs are counterintuitive. Lower reﬁlling costs result in smaller
assortment sizes. Lowering the reﬁlling costs by more than 5% results in delisting
one item, and higher facings of another item. This has the following impact: (1)
higher TSP from higher substitution volume; (2) lower TCL, as fewer products are
listed; (3) no TCOI, as all items are undersupplied; (4) higher overall TCUS to serve
substitution and direct demand.
The effect on TCUS appears particularly counterintuitive, as the per unit reﬁlling
costs decrease. However, what happens is simply that a high-demand item receives
an additional facing. With lower per unit reﬁlling costs, it even becomes more
proﬁtable to reﬁlling this item via additional individual restocking than keep the
other lower volume item, which did not be reﬁlled. This example again shows
that replenishment costs need to be integrated in assortment and shelf space
management.

5.5.4.3
Consumer Behavior
The parameters for consumer behavior (ˇi, ji) are estimated using consumer
experiments and may thus by their very nature deviate from ﬁnal consumer behavior
in the stores and inﬂuence the results. The proﬁt sensitivities for varying consumer
behavior in space elasticity and substitution lie between 2.9% and C2.3% for a
potential error range of 25% and 25%, as illustrated in Fig. 5.9.
The sensitivity analyses of the space elasticity effects show that disregarding
restocking costs overestimates the proﬁt potential of higher space effects and vice
versa. Including restocking requirements in the objective functions lowers the
impact of space-elastic demand, i.e., restocking costs work as buffer for over- or
underestimates of space elasticity. Without restocking costs, as in the CASP model,
the variation in space elasticity impacts proﬁt by –2.9% to C2:3%. With restocking,
as in the CASRP model, the proﬁt impact is –1.9% to –1.8%.
Variations in substitution intensity have only a very limited effect on the total
objective value (0.1–C0.1%), but they have an impact on the solution structure
and jump in intervals whenever additional products are (de-)listed. The effects are
twofold:
1. The increasing substitution intensity shows that the overstocked volume
decreases (see TCOI curve) and the TSP increases.
2. The decreasing substitution intensity of more than –10% shows that one product
gets delisted as the substitution demand required to keep this item in the
assortment becomes too low.

Overall, the sensitivity analyses provide valuable insights for proﬁt implications
and shelf space management decisions. Even though the effect of managerial
decisions, cost estimates and expected consumer behavior might be low for the
total proﬁt, it has a signiﬁcant impact on assortment and shelf space assignment
decisions. Hence, these analyses also reveal the beneﬁt of integrating replenishment
considerations into the objective function for category planning to avoid disadvan-
tageous decisions.
5.5.5
Applicability of CASRP for Large-Scale Categories
One should note that the scale of the optimization problem depends on the values
of two variables: number of product items (I) in the category, and number of
facing levels (K). For further numerical analysis therefore “large-scale” problem
cases are chosen that include very high values for the variables, to ensure that the
model is capable to solving also harder problem sizes a retailer might potentially
face. For instance, a large supermarket retailer carries from approximately 35,000–
50,000 items within 600 categories, i.e., the average number of distinct items in
a category is around 60–80 (EHI Retail Institute 2010). The direct information
from German retailers suggests that there are no categories exceeding 200 items
(i.e., I D 200). The approach to generating random problem instances is similar
to that adopted by Yang (2001), Lim et al. (2004) and Murray et al. (2010). Data
are applied as in Chap. 4 to test a hard knapsack problem (Pisinger 2005). A proﬁt-
to-weight correlation with R2 D 0:8055, random distribution of observed demand
with average of 10,348 units and standard deviation of 10,390, and a total shelf size
is applied that the previous sales ﬁts into the shelf. The variation in facing levels
is also restricted to currently existing shelf layout. Retailers prefer to change shelf
layout incrementally so as not to confuse consumers. Therefore, facing variations
are allowed that still fulﬁll lower and upper bounds as described in Table 5.2. This
constraint is only relaxed in the test case with K D 20. ji is set to 0:5 for the
ﬁrst alternative and to 0:3 for the second alternative. The share of lost sales is
j D 0:2. A BSL of 0:5 is applied, so that only maximum one reﬁlling during

the period is allowed. The total proﬁt of the models is compared to the base model
as in commercial shelf space software.
The computation times show that the extended model is capable of handling
even large number of items and all relevant category problem sizes with very fast
computation time. The CPLEX solver already found also for larger problem sizes
the optimal solutions also after a few seconds (Table 5.3).

Conclusions and Future Areas for Research
Traditional approaches in shelf space management abstract from actual instore
replenishment processes, where merchandizers execute group replenishment and
sales staff deal with individual product replenishment.
The model differentiates the replenishment processes and integrates the
inventory-related costs. It therefore extends shelf space management models by
replenishment costs, and clariﬁes restocking requirements. It has been resolved as
a mixed-integer problem in CPLEX, and allows the computation of optimal results
for category-speciﬁc problem sizes. The numerical examples show the beneﬁts of
an integrated model over currently available software and shelf space management
models.
The numerical examples prove that demand-related facing decisions require
strong alignment with instore operations. The results show that a proportional space-
to-sales rule, as applied in standard planogram software tools, tends to delist too
many items and omits the impact on restocking costs. Neglecting restocking costs,
as in traditional shelf space management models, also results in high replenishment
frequencies. Sensitivity analyses indicate the need for hierarchical and integrated
planning, especially for determining the overall shelf size of a category. Although
the cost estimates and expected consumer behavior have a limited effect on total
proﬁt, variations in their level result in different shelf space decisions.
Areas of potential further research are the investigation of joint optimization
of space assignment, instore replenishment cycles, and order cycles for backroom
replenishment. Here, a further constraint to overall replenishment capacity related to
basic ﬁlling and related to product-speciﬁc reﬁlling processes could also be applied,
if retailers have constrained overall workforce capacity. Furthermore, backroom
capacity and inventory costs could be integrated, as only showroom effects and
costs were reﬂected. Competitive scenarios and marketing effects such as pricing
additionally inﬂuence demand, and could be part of an integrated analysis, as well
as an extension of stochastic demand models.
After extending the CASP-model with supply effects, we will analyze additional
demand effects by integrating pricing into shelf space management in the following
chapter.

Assortment, Shelf Space and Price Planning
6.1
Introduction and Motivation
Assortment, shelf space and price planning are both extremely important and
challenging for retailers. Retailers need to satisfy consumer demand with shelf
supply by balancing variety (number of products) and service levels (number
of items of a product), and offer competitive prices with respect to limited
and valuable operational resources such as shelf space and merchandizers.
For example, offering broader assortments may limit appropriate service levels
and vice versa. Lower item prices diminish the proﬁt contribution per item
sold, but increase demand and impact overall proﬁtability, depending on price
elasticity. Additionally, higher demand requires more frequent restocking or a
higher number of facings. Retailers therefore beneﬁt from comprehensive shelf
space management. Several empirical studies show that well-executed shelf
space management results in proﬁt growth because of an efﬁcient response to
consumer behavior and effective category management (McIntyre and Miller 1999);
(Hennessy 2001; Basuroy et al. 2001; Dhar et al. 2001; Shugan and Desiraju
2001; ECR Europe 2003a; Levy et al. 2004; Grocery Manufacturers Association
et al. 2005; Desrochers and Nelson 2006; Campillo-Lundbeck 2009; Gutgeld
et al. 2009; Fisher and Raman 2010). As a result, category management needs
to carefully plan assortment size, shelf space assignment of products and price of
each product.
The goal of this chapter is to addresses an integrated shelf space allocation,
assortment and pricing problem by capturing the decision trade-offs faced by
retailers in optimizing their shelf space. This chapter structures the planning
problem, provides a decision support model to maximize category proﬁt, and tests
the capability of this model for solving a category-speciﬁc problem. Speciﬁcally,
this chapter develops a model that jointly optimizes retailers’ decisions relating to
assortment size, product prices and number of facings in a product category, and
captures cross-product demand interactions through substitution.

Assortment, Shelf Space and Price Planning
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: The second section
establishes the context of the decision problem and reviews empirical insights,
while Sect. 6.3 analyzes state-of-the art optimization models that are related
to the planning problem being considered. Section 6.4 presents a novel model
that jointly optimizes retailers’ decisions relating to assortment size, product
prices and number of facings in a product category, and captures cross-product
demand interactions through substitution. Section 6.5 provides numerical examples.
The chapter concludes with Sect. 6.6, which also develops further areas for
research.
6.2
Problem Deﬁnition
The traditional retailer shelf management tool is a planogram. Planogram software
products can provide a realistic view of the shelves, and are capable of allocating
shelf space according to simple heuristics such as allocating space proportionally
to sales or proﬁt. A notable problem of all these systems is that they disregard
important demand effects such as space elasticity and product substitution. How-
ever, the major drawback of shelf space software is that it abstracts from the
category manager’s same-time decision problem to decide not only about space
allocation, but also about which products to list and how to price them. The relevant
planning problems, which have to be considered simultaneously, can be deﬁned as
follows:
•
Assortment planning: Listing decisions based on consumer choice behavior and
substitution effects.
•
Shelf space planning: Facing and replenishment decisions based on space- and
cross-space elasticity effects, limited shelf space and operational restocking
constraints.
•
Price planning: Pricing decisions based on price- and cross-price elasticity
effects.
All these planning problems could be signiﬁcantly supported by modeling and
optimization methodologies that allow an integrated perspective on all relevant
decision variables. Our purpose is therefore to develop a model for determining
the assortment as well as allocating shelf space and prices for individual products
within a fast-moving retail category. The optimization problem includes an objective
function that maximizes category proﬁtability, using merchandising variables as the
decision variables, and incorporating various constraints. Consider a retailer who
needs to select items from a set of products, N D f1; 2; : : : ; i; : : : Ig, within a
category, deﬁne the number of facings, Nk D .k1; k2; : : : ; ki; : : : ; kI /, and assign
the price levels Nr D .r1; r2; : : : ; ri; : : : ; rI/ of each item i. Listed items are denoted
by the set N C and delisted items by N . Thus, N C; N  2 N, N C [ N  D N
and N C \ N  D ¿. The basic constraints are: store shelf capacity, product
availability, and lower and upper bounds on facings and prices. Consistent with

6.2
Problem Deﬁnition
115
prior research, an efﬁcient replenishment system is applied to avoid temporary
stockouts.
To reﬂect various enterprise goals, the model receives input from the overarching
strategic decisions on store layout and master category planning. The latter forecasts
mid-term category demand and deﬁnes strategies of categories such as overall
category space S, item price corridors (rmin
i
, rmax
i
, e.g., pricing all pack sizes
of one product group similarly), and minimum and maximum facings (kmin
i
,
kmax
i
/. Requirements for operational instore shelf replenishment are anticipated as
basic supply level (BSL) constraints. In contrast to the permanent assortment, the
promotional assortment focuses on temporary items and prices. This is not however
the focus of this investigation. The analyses focus on a stable market environment
where retailers optimize proﬁt in a given competitive market situation. The disregard
of direct competitive reaction reﬂects mid-term optimization for a period where
e.g., prices and planograms of other retailers are already determined. The model
accounts for gains from/losses to competition to the extent of a speciﬁc gain/loss
sales factor.
The shelf space allocation and pricing problem are quite different depending
on whether one takes the perspective of a retailer or a consumer goods producer
(see Fig. 6.1). Producers want to maximize only the sales and proﬁts of their own
products. They always want more and better shelf space for their products, and
only care about store switching in a limited extend. In contrast, retailers want to
maximize category sales and proﬁts, regardless of producer shares. The following
model is formulated from the perspective of category management by retailers, but
could be adjusted for a producer if the relevant product and cross-product relations
were taken into account.

Assortment, Shelf Space and Price Planning
Excursus: Pricing Perspectives
Prices can usually be set from three perspectives: cost-plus pricing, value-based
pricing and competitive pricing. The ﬁrst is the most basic method, setting prices
based on the input costs and a target proﬁt margin. This is more an accounting
view. The isolated view does not integrate consumer reactions, which takes place
in the second method. In value-based-pricing consumer demand is the core of
price deﬁnition. Consumer price sensitivity, i.e., the price-demand curve, is used to
maximize consumer and producer values. Consumer demand reaction is anticipated
with alternative prices. Competitive pricing has its origin in industrial organization,
where a competitive reaction function is used to anticipate competitors’ price
changes in an oligopolistic market for example. Consequently, an integrated model
needs to fulﬁll all these three perspectives by matching input costs and proﬁt targets
with consumer and competitor reactions.
6.2.1
Properties of Demand Function
A further objective of this research is to investigate and integrate some of the most
relevant instore consumer choice effects into the optimization model. We therefore
introduce empirical research and use this to formulate the associated demand effects.
The majority of consumers make their ﬁnal purchase decisions instore, have a low
level of involvement with their instore decisions, and make choices very quickly
after a minimal search (Dr`eze et al. 1994; Xin et al. 2009; Chandon et al. 2009). The
demand model expresses these facts formally.
6.2.1.1
Space-Dependent Demand
Shelf space allocation inﬂuences consumer attention and demand. Dr`eze et al.
(1994), Campo and Gijsbrechts (2005) and Inman et al. (2009) verify that fast-
moving consumer goods have signiﬁcant space elasticity. Chandon et al. (2009)
reveal that facing variation is the most signiﬁcant instore factor.
Common denominators of shelf space models are item demand rates as a function
of the space allocated to each item. The basic demand is denoted by ˛i, ˇi describes
the space elasticity, and bi is the breadth of item i. Common retailer practice is to
move items forward to the front row. The space-dependent demand Qdik of item i
is a deterministic function of its displayed front-row inventory level at the facing
levels k (Hansen and Heinsbroek 1979).

6.2.1.2
Price-Dependent Demand
Secondly, Hoch et al. (1994) demonstrate the high impact of retail pricing practices
on proﬁts. Their experiment results in up to 32% category proﬁt impact for price
changes. Tellis (1988) and Gaur and Fisher (2005) also describe the effect of pricing
on consumer demand. Such evidence is consistent with retail shoppers’ propensity
to compare prices (Bucklin et al. 1998; Urbany et al. 2000; Bimolt et al. 2005;
Chandon et al. 2009).
The price-dependent demand function describes the relationship between price
and aggregated consumer demand: The lower the price, the higher the demand, and
vice versa. Price elasticity i for product i, where i D 1; 2; : : : ; I, represents the
demand change relative to the price change. Retail prices are rounded to a set of
discrete price points. It is therefore not over-restrictive to limit this case to a set of
discrete price points, ri 2 Ri. Further, to allow a high degree of price ﬂexibility, an
elasticity by price point il is proposed, where i D 1; 2; : : : ; I; l D 1; 2; : : : ; L, as
this elasticity may vary by price point, e.g., when a threshold is reached. The price
levels are denoted by index l, where l D 1; 2; : : : ; L. The price index n denotes
the price level observed, i.e., the base price, and ˛i deﬁnes the associated demand
for item i at base price level n. The price-dependent demand Odil of item i at price
level l is formulated as follows:
Odil D ˛i 

1 C il  ril  rin

i D 1; : : : ; II l D 1; : : : ; L
(6.2)
Combining space- and price-dependent demand effects leads to the following
demand rate of item i, dikl, which depends on the number of facings k and the
chosen price level l:

(6.3)
6.2.1.3
Assortment-Dependent Demand
Demand decisions relating to consumer goods cannot be taken without considering
the overall impact of other items, i.e., with respect to listing, spacing and pricing.
These decisions – assuming space is limited – imply that potentially not all products
can be added to the assortment, for example, or that it may be more proﬁtable to list
other products to force consumers to switch to more proﬁtable substitutes. There is
also empirical evidence that variety levels have become so excessive that reducing
variety signiﬁcantly increases sales (Sloot and Verhoef 2008). Also, Dr`eze et al.
(1994), Iyengar and Lepper (2000) and Dhar et al. (2001) report a positive impact
from reducing assortment size and delisting items on total demand. Boatwright
and Nunes (2001) found that signiﬁcant item reductions (up to 54%) resulted in

118
6
Assortment, Shelf Space and Price Planning
an average sales increase of 11% across 42 categories examined, and sales growth
in more than two-thirds of these categories. Gruen et al. (2002) report that 45% of
consumers substitute, i.e., buy one of the available items from the same category.
ECR Europe (2003b) concludes that 69% of the volume is substituted, while the
research of Xin et al. (2009) states that the relevant ﬁgure is up to 75%, and the
work of van Woensel et al. (2007) cites a ﬁgure of 84%.
Thus, we follow the general idea of classical assortment approaches in using
exogenous substitution estimates. Every consumer chooses their favorite item j
from set N. Substitution demand is determined by the substitution intensity and
latent demand for delisted items Qdj 0 (j 2 N ). If their favorite product j is
not available for some reason, probability ji approximates that a consumer will
choose a second favorite i, i 2 N C. The fraction of consumers who are willing
to compromise their initial choice for product j is expressed in the probability of

i¤j
ji; j D 1; 2; : : : I. Note that j does not depend
on the stocking level due to the assumption of an efﬁcient replenishment system.
We assume as in the CASP-model the latent demand of delisted items with Qdj 0 D
j  Qdj1
j D 1; : : : ; I and one round of substitution.
6.2.1.4
Cross-Space- and Cross-Price-Dependent Demand
Cross-product effects also need to be an integrated part of the model. Consumers
substitute, i.e., buy alternatives if the changes to price and space increase the
attractiveness of the alternative. Cross-space and cross-price elasticity quantify the
effects of facings and prices of alternative items j on the demand for an item i.
In the past, every consumer has chosen their favorite item j, j 2 N C, from all
listed items. If their favorite item now has varying shelf facings or shelf prices, the
consumer will switch to a second favorite with a probability of ji. Here we also
use an exogenous demand substitution matrix. These effects are cannibalization and
gains from other items dependent on their facings and prices. The substitution may
be different for demand substitutions away from items versus substitutions to items.
That is why the substitution matrix does not need to be symmetrical (ji ¤ ij ).
The following Fig. 6.2 illustrates the demand shifts for price-related demand on
the left hand side. The demand for an individual item is precalculated for discrete
prices, whereas shifts between items are reﬂected in the extent to which substitutions
are made. The right chart illustrates the demand shifts for changes in the facing
levels accordingly.
6.2.1.5
Other Demand Effects
The model focuses on optimizing the permanent assortment. Promotional and
other marketing activities are not part of the decision model. Effects other than
space allocation and regular shelf prices are assumed to be constant. The demand

function relates to products with clearly deﬁned qualities. An improvement of
the product quality would lead to a shift of the curve. The demand function
assumes a speciﬁc constellation of the environment, especially regarding consumer
behavior, competitive reaction and stability of the factors inﬂuencing behavior. This
premise allows the abstraction of uncertainty from pricing decisions, and the use of
deterministic models. Dynamic pricing systems such as varying prices within the
period, life cycle pricing and temporary price reductions will not be integrated in
the basic model either. This also excludes mixed calculation with loss leaders. The
demand function will refer to a clearly deﬁned period. It will thus be a static model.
This implies that time-related substitution, i.e., carry-over effects of decisions in a
period, do not impact demand in later periods. Other price differentiation systems,
such as personal, quantitative, or price bundling, will not be applied as they are
rather unusual for everyday pricing and regular store assortments.
Complementary effects can easily be integrated by adjusting the substitution
matrix to negative values.

Our approach makes it possible to calculate the total item demand d 

all demand effects related to the total demand function for a listed item i, i 2 N C.

Instore Inventory Management and Shelf Replenishment
Instore handling costs amount from 38% to 48% of operational retail logistics costs
(Broekmeulen et al. 2006; Kuhn and Sternbeck 2011), often because shelf space
allocation is not aligned with the replenishment regime (Ketzenberg et al. 2002;
Curseu et al. 2009; van Zelst et al. 2009). The analyses in Chap.5 shows that up to
70% of the items are temporarily underfaced, i.e., consumer demand is higher than
shelf supply, thus requiring frequent restocking. Traditional shelf space decision
models disregard this effect by assuming that each demand can be fulﬁlled (Hansen
and Heinsbroek 1979; Corstjens and Doyle 1981; Urban 1998; Hariga et al. 2007;
Abbott and Palekar 2008; Hansen et al. 2010; Murray et al. 2010). We prefer to
follow actual retail practice by positing a differentiated replenishment system: (1)
all items are replenished together at regular intervals using scheduled basic ﬁlling
with a ﬁxed quantity, e.g., by merchandizers before the store opens; (2) individual
replenishment of items by sales employees during the day as soon demand outstrips
shelf supply. We therefore integrate operational replenishment requirements into the
strategic model and introduce a “basic supply level” (BSL), which is a percentage
of demand that is covered by the basic ﬁlling process. This level needs to be
achieved by the regular daily basic shelf-ﬁlling process, whereas sales staff can
fulﬁll the residuum during the day. A BSL of 100% means that total demand is fully
satisﬁed by the scheduled basic stocking. A lower BSL requires limited individual
restocking. It is assumed that retailers employ an effective logistics system, ensuring
that demand required in the showroom can be replaced immediately with stock
available from the backroom. This restocking regime avoids temporary out-of-stock
situations, as the entire demand can be fulﬁlled by items available on the shelves,
i.e., by basic ﬁlling and limited reﬁlling.
6.3
Literature Review of Shelf Space and Price Planning
The following section summarizes the relevant literature on decision support models
for shelf space planning, and puts the contribution of this study in this context.
Among the existing models in the shelf space management literature, one
of the earliest studies is by Hansen and Heinsbroek (1979). In their model,
demand for each product is a function of space elasticity. Their model seeks to
maximize retailers’ proﬁts subject to a limit on total shelf space, upper and lower
bounds on individual product quantity, and integer values for facings. Further,

6.3
Literature Review of Shelf Space and Price Planning
121
Zufryden (1986) introduces a dynamic programmingformulation for a problem with
space elasticity and demand-related marketing variables, including price. Although
they have not considered cross-effects, this is the ﬁrst shelf space model to include
price-dependent demand effects. Yang and Chen (1999) assume a linear proﬁt
within a constrained number of facings within lower and upper bounds. Yang
(2001) proposes a knapsack heuristic for the model. He found an optimal solution
only for simpliﬁed versions. Also, the Yang model does not reﬂect cross-product
effects.
Corstjens and Doyle (1981) developed a space allocation model with demand
as a function of direct space and cross-space elasticity. A major criticism is that
the model requires a pre-deﬁned assortment, as delisting one product would result
in zero demand for the entire category. In addition, the models do not assume
integer facing values. Furthermore, they allow only a limited scope of items, and
also assume price as an exogenous parameter. Borin et al. (1994) differentiate
“unmodiﬁed,” “modiﬁed demand,” “acquired” and “stockout” demand. Unmodiﬁed
demand is basic demand reﬂecting consumer preference for an item, whereas
modiﬁed demand is solely a function of space allocation, such that price effects
are ignored. Acquired and stockout demand reﬂect demand for out-of-assortment
and out-of-stock substitution. Besides the exclusion of space elasticity, they also
neglect operational constraints. Irion et al. (2004) further extend Corstjens’ model
to a product level instead of category level. Using a linearization framework,
they transform the model into a mixed-integer problem with linear constraints.
Their approach provides near-optimal solutions with a posteriori error bound.
They simplify by using the identical demand for listed and delisted items ( Qdi0 D
Qdi1; i
2
N), and thus do not account for assortment decisions with latent
demand.
Most literature on retail stores focuses primarily on the demand side, and
less on the cost side. However, retailers with limited space face a trade-off of
putting fewer items out for sale against keeping inventory of other products.
Urban (1998) develop an inventory-theoretic approach to shelf space allocation
and assortment decisions. The author combines order quantity decision, shelf space
assignment and assortment decision into one model. Replenishment is assumed
instantaneously and individually for each product. It therefore does not reﬂect actual
retail policies.
Mart´ın-Herr´an et al. (2006) examine shelf space allocation and wholesale prices
with a simulation in a static game with a Stackelberg equilibrium, with two
manufacturers of two competing brands at one retailer. The manufacturers optimize
their prices by taking into account shelf space allocation and price markup decisions
of the common retailer. However, they exclude cross-space effects and adopt a
cost-based pricing approach as they apply the same markup for the two brands.
They derive optimal wholesale prices in the limited study, which features just two
products. Murray et al. (2010) develop a model that jointly optimizes prices, facings,
display orientation and shelf selection in a category. They apply a branch-and-
bound-based MINLP algorithm that is able to solve problems in a fast and practical
manner. The authors integrate space, price and cross-price effects, but disregard

122
6
Assortment, Shelf Space and Price Planning
operational constraints and cross-space effects. The assortment also needs to be
speciﬁed before.
While the above-noted models have made signiﬁcant progress in addressing shelf
space decision problems, they fall short in capturing the key aspects of the category
manager’s decision problem in their assumptions on:
•
Pricing and/or assortment as given parameters.
•
Immediate shelf replenishment and disregard of operational constraints.
A drawback of these studies is their (non-) applicability to assortment decisions.
Generally, the models handle assortment decisions and latent demand for non-listed
items (i.e., facing set to zero) by assuming no demand substitution, except for the
models by Borin et al. (1994) and Urban (1998), and the CASP-model. A further
limitation of existing models is their failure to consider a retailer’s pricing and
shelf allocation decisions jointly. Exceptions are the studies of Zufryden (1986),
Mart´ın-Herr´an et al. (2006) and Murray et al. (2010), who reﬂected price elasticity,
but without assortment effects. Additionally, all models allow immediate shelf
replenishment to avoid stockouts. This inventory assumption can result in situations
where retailers are forced to restock frequently and face substantial operational costs
of items where demand is high and shelf space low. All is all, this is too divorced
from the reality of the decision problem in retail practice, where retail category
managers deﬁne shelf space, assortment and prices interdependently.
Excursus: Review of Other Pricing and Demand
Planning Streams
A further review of streams related to the topic of integrated shelf space and price
management indicates either a qualitative character, focus on temporary mark-down
pricing, or assumes unlimited shelf capacity.
For example, ECR initiatives aim to match concepts of (supply-side) supply
chain management with (demand-side) category management using qualitative
approaches to strengthen the integrated view (Efﬁcient Consumer Response 1993;
ECR Europe 2003a; Fisher and Raman 2010).
Revenue management models study integrated price and inventory management.
These models deal with dynamic and mark-down pricing for promoted or perishable
items, i.e., time-varying prices (Gallego and van Ryzin 1994; Federgruen and
Heching 1999; Kambil and Agrawal 2001; Bitran and Caldentey 2003; Quante
et al. 2009). Furthermore, price promotion studies evaluate and optimize temporary
price promotions (Gupta 1988; Abraham and Lodish 1993; Blattberg and Neslin
1993; van Heerde et al. 2004). They focus on highly varying prices between micro-
periods (van Heerde et al. 2004), and not on mid-term shelf prices for the permanent
assortment, which is the core of this contribution. Finally, price models assume

unlimited shelf supply and omit shelf capacity and restocking costs, see e.g., Binkley
and Connor (1998).
6.4
Formulation of the Capacitated Assortment, Shelf Space
and Price Problem (CASPP)
In this section we develop an MIP model that addresses the integrated Capacitated
Assortment, Shelf space and Price planning Problem (CASPP). It is a model
for determining the assortment as well as allocating shelf space and prices for
individual products within a fast-moving retail category. The optimization problem
can be summarized with an objective function that maximizes category proﬁtability,
using merchandising variables as the decision variables, and incorporating various
constraints. Consider a retailer who needs to select items from a set of i D 1; 2; : : : I
products within a category, and where the demand di depends on number of facings
ki and price ri, and the substitution demand from item j to i, where the demand
for j depends on kj and rj. The item proﬁt pi depends on the selected price.
The category manager needs to decide about the facings and price of each item
to maximize the category proﬁt P .
The composite demand function (6.4) can be transformed to a linear function
by using the integer constraint for facing and discrete prices and precalculating
the demand for each item. The non-linear demand function can then be transferred
into a specialized knapsack problem where the binary decision variable yikl selects
the most proﬁtable item-facing-price combination for each item in the possible
assortment. Hence, it can be degenerated into a bounded 0=1 multi-choice knapsack
problem by precalculating all integer demand values, as there is a set of I items
and each item i is associated with size bi, price-level-dependent proﬁt pil, and total
shelf capacity S. Additionally, the binary variable zi denotes whether an item is

). The facing range depicts business
restrictions like presentation of certain item types, enforces minimum listings for
new products, or sets upper limits for items to only get a share of shelves. As noted
in the literature (e.g., Yang 2001; Murray et al. 2010), the lower bound kmin

captures
the retailer’s contractual obligations with producers that require that a minimum
amount of facing area is assigned to each product item. (6.15) sets price corridors,
with the maximum and minimum prices of a listed item as rmax

covers direct demand and substituted demand of item i, while the right side denotes
the supply capacity for basic shelf replenishment. The number of units supplied via
basic reﬁlls per facing is described by gi. Only listed items (zi D 1) need to achieve
the BSL and fulﬁll constraint (6.16). However, since values for substituted demand
may be positive even though item i is not listed (zi D 0), it is necessary to ensure
the validity of the constraint for delisted items by adding a large number on the right
side, e.g., the maximum demand for item i, d max
i

Numerical Examples and Test Problems
The following section illustrates the above optimization model by solving a test
example from a grocery category. This section ﬁrst provides an overview of the
test example in 6.5.1, followed by the analyses of impact on total proﬁt level in
6.5.2 and additional managerial insights in 6.5.3. Subsection 6.5.4 provides error
bounds for parameter estimates and the impact of hierarchical planning decisions
with sensitivity analyses of the test example. In a ﬁnal subsection 6.5.5, the model is
tested with a large test case from a category with 80 items. The ﬁnal test will evaluate
the solution performance with a commercial solver, and examine its applicability to
other category sizes.
6.5.1
Description of the Test Case
6.5.1.1
Data Applied in Test Case
The numerical examples use test problems with a wide range of parameter values
for the computational set-up for the experiment. To investigate the effects of the
problem, observed data from a single retail category are analyzed. The model
requires retail outlet data for item sales and their facings, and the available shelf
space. Item-speciﬁc data are item prices and costs, listing costs and item sizes.
Ranges and constraints need to be provided for facings, prices and basic supply
levels.
The experimental setting consists of up to 30 consumer products representing an
entire product category. Annual demand ﬁgures are used. The products are located
within one shelf and regularly reﬁlled. Direct shelf replenishment needs to cover
80% of the demand, i.e., BSL D 80%. Proﬁt was modeled using item gross margin,
as handling and replenishment costs are the same across the merchandize category
for the retailer. Listing costs LCi of 1.000 currency units also needed to be included
for changes required to the shelf layout and other processes.
Price elasticity was provided by previous consumer research in this particular
category of the retailer, with 1:75  il  1:45, i D 1; 2; : : : I; l D 1; 2; : : : L.
The space elasticity is assumed to be the same as it was in prior research (e.g.,
Hansen and Heinsbroek 1979; Yang 2001), i.e., ˇi D 0:2 and consequently i D
0:8. For a sake of simplicity in the numerical analyses, we apply a symmetrical
substitution matrix (ji D ij , 8j; i 2 N ). An exogenous substitution estimate
is applied, with a .1/
j
D PN
iD1 ji D 0:8, 8j 2 N, as the substitution volume
for the ﬁrst alternative of item j, and j D 0:2, 8j 2 N. We also apply bounds
on the number of facings. The lower bound kmin
i
(upper bound kmax
i
) is set at 25%

summarized in Table 6.1.

Comparison of the CASPP Solution with Other Approaches
The objective value of the “Capacitated Assortment, Shelf space and Pricing
Problem” (CASPP) with space-elastic, substitution and price-elastic effects as
presented in this chapter is compared with (1) a base model (BM), (2) a “Capacitated
Shelf space Problem” (CSP), and (3) a “Capacitated Assortment and Shelf space
Problem” (CASP):
1. The BM represents a lower bound on the objective value by applying the
proportional-to-sales allocation rule (without adjusting prices), as is usual in
commercial software packages like “Apollo” or “Spaceman.” Substitution is
calculated a posteriori.
2. The CSP solution takes into account space and cross-space effects. The objective
function is denoted by P D TDPCTCPP TCL, substitutions for delistings are
calculated a posteriori, and prices are exogenously speciﬁed (i.e., remain at base
price rin).
3. The CASP additionally integrates substitutions with P D TDPCTSPCTCPP
TCL. We speciﬁed prices exogenously (as above).
6.5.2
Proﬁt Impact of Integrated Assortment, Shelf Space
and Price Planning
The objective values of the models with varying problem sizes are compared
with the base case solution of the BM. Table 6.2 shows increases in total proﬁt
for the CSP, CASP and CASPP models. The CASPP model increases proﬁt by
6–23% over BM, and by 1–19% over the CASP solution, which could represent
substantial potential in a low-margin industry like retailing. Also the CSP and CASP
models signiﬁcantly outperform standard industry practice by allocationg space
proportionally.

Further Managerial Insights
In the following we analyze the example where I D 20; K D 10; L D 5 to
generate managerial insights. The integration of price variation impacts not only
the total proﬁt, but signiﬁcantly changes the structure of the result as well, i.e.,
characteristics of the decision variables. Figure 6.3 summarizes the differences in
the decision variables for each item. Comparing the CASP model with the CASPP
model leads to the following results: 50% of the products are assigned different
prices, 56% receive different facings. This results in up to 60% of items getting
different facings and/or prices via the integrated approach. This example shows that
the possibility of changing prices signiﬁcantly impacts solution structure and total
proﬁt.
Figure 6.4 shows that integrated optimization improves the utilization of shelf
capacity and aligns supply and demand. Overall shelf space utilization (D space
requirement of total demand/total shelf supply) increases signiﬁcantly if varying
prices are allowed in the integrated model. The shelf space utilized increases from
89% for the base case to 91% for the CASP case, and to 96% with the CASPP
model. The CASPP model better leverages the available shelf capacity. A utilization
of 100% means that all items were sold before basic restocking.

Sensitivity Analyses
A multitude of parameters need to be estimated. Errors and deviations cannot be
excluded easily, so an evaluation of the impact of these parameters on the results of
the model is carried out using sensitivity analyses. In this subsection, sensitivity
analyses are computed using four levels of parameter changes, where ﬁve have
lower parameter values (10–50%) than the default, and ﬁve have higher values
(C10–C50%). The parameters for consumer behavior (ˇi, il, ji) were estimated
in consumer experiments, and may therefore by their nature deviate from ﬁnal
consumer behavior in stores, and inﬂuence the results. The determination of total
shelf sizes and basic supply levels are managerial decisions based on hierarchical
planning aspects.
The sensitivity analyses reveal moderate to medium impact on proﬁt for all
parameters, as illustrated in Fig. 6.5. The managerial planning decisions on category
shelf space and desired BSL impact proﬁt prospects. Assigning too little shelf
space affects proﬁt signiﬁcantly. Increasing or lowering the basic supply level
impacts proﬁt, but with only limited effects. However, it shows that a comprehensive
planning framework and hierarchy would facilitate the accuracy of decision making
in retail sales planning. The proﬁt sensitivity for varying consumer behavior in terms
of elasticity and substitution lies between –2.2% and 2.3%, with a potential error
range of –50% and 50%. This would allow the use of even rougher data sets. Any
higher accuracy in estimating consumer behavior would require consumer research.
These sensitivity results provide business boundaries that can be used to consider
investing in understanding consumers more accurately, e.g., by using larger samples.
Overall, joint optimization of assortment, spacing and pricing in one objective
function not only improves the accuracy of the model, but allows the achievement
of better objective values as well. The impact of varying consumer behavior and
different hierarchical decisions remains medium to moderate.

6.5.5
Applicability for Large-Scale Categories
One should note that the scale of the optimization problem depends on the values of
three variables: number of product items (I) in the category, number of facing levels
(K), and number of price levels (L). The mixed-integer quadratic model features
an objective function with linear constraints. In general, mixed-integer quadratic
problems (MIQPs) are difﬁcult to solve. However, the case examples show that the
computation time remains within reasonable time bounds for the strategic decision
problem . 30 min/.
The number of variables is I C I  K  L, where I denotes the number of
items, K the number of discrete facings, and L the number of discrete price levels.
Furthermore, using the parameter ji reduces the data requirements from I KL for
all assortment, facing and price combinations to a matrix with I 2 combinations.
For further numerical analysis, “large-scale” problem cases are chosen that
include very high values for all the three variables consistent with the potential
reality of retailers’ decision environments. For instance, a large supermarket retailer
carries from approximately 35,000–50,000 items within 600 categories, i.e., the
average number of distinct items in a category is around 60–80. The largest test
is therefore I D 80. The variation in facing levels is also restricted to currently
existing shelf layout. Retailers prefer to change shelf layout incrementally so as not
to confuse consumers. As a result, facing variations are allowed that still fulﬁll lower
and upper bounds. Price image plays a key role in a retailer’s strategy. Retailers
therefore strategically deﬁne the price ranges of categories and products in a long-
term decision. This long-term strategy (or these mid-term adjustments) are input to
the model presented.Hence, the number of price levels L is also limited, as retailers

Table 6.3 summarizes the computation time and the results. The CPLEX solver
found a feasible solution where the MIP solution was close to the LP solution. The
LP-MIP solution gap with less than 0.5% was achieved after less than 10 minutes.
However, CPLEX then took more than 30 minutes to prove that the solution is
optimal in all the test cases.

Conclusions and Future Areas for Research
This chapter is concerned with the development and analysis of an integrated model
for assortment size, shelf space management and price optimization. The model
developed is a mixed-integer quadratic non-linear problem that was solved using
CPLEX.
The model presented extends known shelf space management models using
price effects. It is based on consumer decisions and operational constraints. The
computation results show that price and space elasticity are efﬁciently exploited, and
that the model avoids high restocking requirements as well as that space is efﬁciently
exploited. It also clariﬁes restocking requirements to satisfy basic supply levels.
This model provides results for retail-speciﬁc (sub-) category problem sizes within
reasonable computation times. Furthermore, it has been shown that the integrated
model provides more accurate and better solutions. It is possible to apply the model
to a large set of category optimization problems, as standard retail data was mainly
used such as historical sales, which are available at a store level. The sales data only
require support via experimental data.
Limitations of the model can be viewed as further areas of research. Some areas
relate to (1) hierarchical planning aspects, (2) problem size, and (3) the nature of
a deterministic model. First, the restocking costs could be further speciﬁed and
quantiﬁed. Out-of-stock substitution does not occur as efﬁcient instore logistics
have been assumed, as in other shelf space models. However, adding costs to
restocking processes would mean that it might be more beneﬁcial to save on
restocking and allow substitution of other products. The model assumes unlimited

transportation, warehouse and backroom capacity, as only showroom effects have
been integrated. Additionally, positing aspects of a planning hierarchy as input to
managerial constraints and enlarging the scope down the supply chain will provide
additional insights. This also includes joint shelf price optimization with suppliers
and game-theoretic aspects. The further impact of marketing activities and demand
effects could be studied, too, e.g., positioning. Moreover, the mixed quadratic
problem can only be solved with a limited number of items as in the test cases.
Developing and implementing heuristics may overcome this, and the effectiveness
of the heuristics can be measured against the model in this chapter. Another possible
extension is to consider stochastic demand.

Chapter 7
Conclusions and Outlook
This thesis has provided a coherent retail operations planning architecture for
retail demand and supply chain planning. The review of empirical insights, DSSs
and commercial software applications shows that category managers require more
quantitative analyses for the master planning of retail shelves. Decisions in this
area can beneﬁt from a modeling perspective. Shelf space management is one
of the most difﬁcult aspects of retailing. A signiﬁcant reason is that while retail
shelf space is ﬁxed, the number of new potential products is constantly growing
and evolving alongside consumer desire. Decision support systems (DSS) have
therefore been developed at the interface of marketing and operations that integrate
assortment planning, price management and inventory management with shelf space
management. These models require commonly available retail sales and proﬁt data,
and are supported by consumer research data. In that spirit, this thesis aims to bridge
the gap between theory and practice and nudge retail category managers towards
more quantitative analysis in their shelf space decisions.
7.1
Contribution to Research Status
The concurrence of market trends has made it all the more important for retailers
to be as efﬁcient as possible in managing the allocation of their existing shelf
space – arguably one of the scarcest and most strategically valuable resources.
While retail managers strive to follow the industry mantra “retail is detail,” most
of them have little time to consider the details of different planning aspects.
Therefore a comprehensive planning architecture is required that structures supply
and demand planning tasks and arranges them according to hierarchical and vertical
interdependencies. DSSs abstract from reality and use models as a basis for plans.
Analytical models are emerging as the most promising solutions to many of these
planning problems, especially as advances in computing capabilities allow the
solution of larger retail problems (Agrawal and Smith 2009b; Kopalle 2010).

Conclusions and Outlook
The goal has become how best to manage product assortments to generate higher
proﬁt from limited shelf space. A key imperative for retailers striving to achieve
efﬁcient retail shelves is obviously the availability of appropriate DSSs to help
with the more efﬁcient allocation of the shelf space they have available. This study
focuses on developing such DSSs.
Models are developed that jointly optimize category managers’ decisions on
assortment size, number of facings, product prices and restocking requirements in
a product category. As a result, the models better capture the realistic same-time
decision environment faced by category managers, including several key aspects
hitherto treated rudimental by the existing models. The multi-product assortment,
shelf space, price and inventory management problems integrate consumer interac-
tion and hierarchical decision aspects. Practical solutions are provided to optimize
retail category-speciﬁc problem sizes. The numerical examples show the superiority
of integrated models over pure successive planning and the rules in commercial
planogram-creation software. A fully integrated model that jointly reﬂects price
and inventory considerations has not been provided up to now, as the focus of the
model extensions was on analyses of the supply-side and demand-side impact of
such aspects.
This research effort proposes models that are accurate, easy to implement,
and ﬂexible enough to be applied to a wide range of shelf space management
models. The models contribute to the existing literature in four directions. Firstly,
unlike existing studies that consider a shelf space allocation decision independent
of assortment decisions, the models allow joint decisions on both, and capture
cross-product interactions through substitution behavior. Assortment decisions are
integrated in shelf space management as out-of-assortment substitution from latent
consumer demand. This more realistically reﬂects consumer instore behavior and
category managers’ decision problems. Secondly, existing shelf space allocation
models consider only “efﬁcient replenishment systems,” and abstract from the actual
restocking processes of retailers. In contrast, the integrated inventory and shelf
space management model considers restocking policies of a ﬁxed scheduled ﬁlling
before sales begin and concurrent restocking during the sales period. Also, price
has been previously treated as an exogenous parameter in shelf space management.
The integrated price and shelf space management model relaxes this and uses
price adjustments to increase space productivity and category proﬁt. Finally, the
models are transformed from non-linear mixed-integer problems to multi-choice
knapsack problems. This allows the use of commercial solvers such as CPLEX to
obtain a globally optimal shelf space conﬁguration with fast computation times.
The numerical examples show the beneﬁt of integrated models on total proﬁt
and solution structure. The number of facings, restocking requirements and shelf
prices all have signiﬁcant impact on category proﬁtability. Sensitivity analyses are
used to additionally compute error bounds for the parameter estimates. Finally,
managerial decisions and constraints on operational fulﬁllment are analyzed as part
of a comprehensive hierarchical retail planning framework.

Further Areas for Research
Model assumptions and limitations can be viewed as further potential research
areas. Four avenues emerge as important future research directions based on the
previous discussion in this thesis. It seems that there are signiﬁcant opportunities
in generalizing the existing theoretical work to handle the more complex problems
faced by category managers.
First, the planning problems within master category management need to be
aligned with hierarchical and vertical planning interdependencies. Second, incor-
porating other demand effects based on empirical ﬁndings on consumer behavior
in shelf space optimization models seems a valuable area of research. Third,
different modeling techniques and solution procedures may be required to cope with
large-scale problems that integrate other demand effects and planning aspects, or
that require the integration of stochastic or dynamic effects. Finally, most of the
existing theoretical models have not been incorporated into standard applications
(meaning their theoretical predictions have not been empirically tested). The ﬁeld
would beneﬁt from such applications and empirical tests as a validation of the
assumptions in the increasingly complex shelf space management planning models
being formulated in the academic literature. Below some possible research topics
from these four avenues are described, in no particular order.
7.2.1
Alignment with Other Planning Problems
7.2.1.1
Vertical Integration of Planning Problems
The model assumes unlimited transportation, warehouse and backroom capacity, as
only showroom effects are integrated. Areas of further research are the investigation
of joint optimization of space assignment, instore replenishment cycles and order
cycles for backroom replenishment. Here, a further constraint in overall replenish-
ment capacity for the scheduled basic ﬁll and product-speciﬁc reﬁll processes could
also be applied if retailers are constrained where their overall workforce capacity
is concerned. It would also be worthwhile to study the impact of case pack sizes
and alignment using direct ﬁlling of shelves with warehouse deliveries (without
backroom storage). Backroom capacity and backroom inventory costs could also be
integrated, as only showroom effects and costs have been reﬂected so far.
7.2.1.2
Hierarchical Integration of Planning Problems
The shelf space management models are capable of allocating shelf space to
products within a product category. The models use a bottom-up approach for shelf
space assignment to individual products and implicitly assume that the amount of
shelf space assigned to a product category is predetermined (Irion et al. 2004). The

138
7
Conclusions and Outlook
space allocation models, which assign shelf space to individual products, are ﬂexible
enough to be applied to allocation problems at a higher level of aggregation. Thus,
similar models can be used to allocate store shelf space to entire categories using
a top-down approach. In a hierarchical framework, the results of category space
assignment become a constraint for product space assignment within a category,
and would this need to communicate back to the overarching layout conﬁguration.
However, these two different hierarchical approaches have not yet been connected.
This research area appears very promising, as sensitivity analyses across the models
indicate the high impact of total shelf space on proﬁt. Also, further master category
planning activities like category sales planning and sales forecasting should be
included in the analyses of overarching planning requirements.
Anticipations of the subordinated instore logistics planning should also be
reﬂected in the decision model. Retailers are constrained in their shelf replenishment
due to limitations on the shelf merchandizers available to immediately ﬁll the
shelves after stock out and the expensive handling costs within stores. The further
integration of replenishment constraints and non-linear shelf stacking costs seems a
worthwhile area of research.
7.2.2
Further Demand Effects
Consumer purchase decisions across product categories may not always be inde-
pendent. Further, while in this research the objective was to optimize category
proﬁt, other performance criteria exist that need be to evaluated, such as market
basket or cross-category metrics (Cachon et al. 2005; Cachon and K¨ok 2007;
Kamakura and Wooseong 2007). Since shelf space management often interacts with
other marketing mix activities, future research is needed that investigates the effect
of cross-category effects, price promotions and advertising (Hansen et al. 2010).
Wickern (1966, p.41) explain that “the success of retailing consists not only of
selling merchandise, but also of the nature and completeness of the assortment.”
Shopping is a hedonistic event for a growing number of customers (e.g., Arnold
and Reynolds 2003). Customers are increasingly affected by store layout and
susceptible to impulse buying (e.g., Kaltcheva and Weitz 2006; Massara and Pelloso
2006; Mattila and Wirtz 2008; Liu et al. 2007). Consequently, category managers
often place products together according to brands or product sizes to create a
category image. Pure shelf space proﬁt maximization could work against such
imagery. Research is lacking that balances shelf space assignment and atmospherics.
As Hansen et al. (2010, p.102) concludes, that until the effects of visual layout
effects are not integrated, “practitioners would be wise to also keep a ‘human touch’
in the planogram design process.”
Further marketing activities and demand-generating effects should be inves-
tigated. These include, in particular, positioning effects to account for different
shelf layers and “eye-level” demand, the impact of promotional effects on per-
manent assortment, and other marketing variables that generate instore demand.

7.2
Further Areas for Research
139
Competitive scenarios that additionally inﬂuence overall store sales could also be
part of an integrated analysis.
Another shortcoming in the modeling is the implicit assumption that shelves are
always kept fully stocked. While some existing models allow partial shelf depletion
and calculate this impact on demand (Urban 1998; Hariga et al. 2007), the effect of
consumer behavior on out-of-stock substitution has not been investigated in these
models. Out-of-stock substitution does not occur as efﬁcient instore logistics has
been assumed. However, integrating out-of-stock substitution and restocking costs
in space assignment could lead to a situation where it might be more beneﬁcial to
save on stocking, instead allowing substitution of other products.
7.2.3
Empirical Validation of Model Recommendations
More empirical analyses are needed to understand the impact of merchandizing
variables on consumer choice and purchasing behavior. Only limited empirical
studies have been conducted of the relationship of assortment, shelf space and
inventory decisions with other levers such as pricing, promotions, and advertising
(e.g., McIntyre and Miller 1999; Richards and Hamilton 2006). Joint optimization
of some of these variables may lead to interesting results.
Estimating model parameters such as substitution probabilities and space elas-
ticity is another area that needs further research. There is an extensive body of
literature in marketing and econometrics that deals with estimating parameter for
a wide variety of consumer choice models (K¨ok et al. 2009). However, there is little
application of these in the shelf space planning literature. To bridge retail practice
and academic research, it is important to come up with innovative and cost-efﬁcient
techniques to estimate the parameters that form the backbone of several optimization
models.
7.2.4
Modeling Techniques
The computing power of machines and functionality of solvers have gone up
exponentially. Data storage restrictions have also declined at a similar pace. These
changes, combined with quantitatively trained retail managers with an analytics
orientation at many organizations, have provided a great opportunity for modelers
in retailing research to actually have a practical impact (Kopalle 2010). However,
even though it has been shown that the models presented are capable of providing
solutions for practical category sizes, the integration of further demand effects
and planning aspects may require the use of specialized heuristics or meta-
heuristics.
Furthermore, consumer demand is assumed to be deterministically known, but
in fact is subject to certain volatility depending on external factors like season,
temperature or weekday. An extension to stochastic and non-stationary demand
would further improve the reliability of results.

140
7
Conclusions and Outlook
Finally, scientiﬁc models take a static view of the shelf space planning problem,
whereas in practice, shelf space decisions in a category may be made several times
throughout the season. The dynamic shelf space problem provides a rich set of
research questions, such as shelf space planning with demand learning using tests
in sample stores.
7.2.5
Transfer to Commercial Software Applications
and Retail Practice
The complexity of managing shelf space will still require being able to visualize of
the planogram for ﬁnal human veriﬁcation. Any decision support model therefore
also needs to communicate with and be adjusted to shelf space software programs,
which will be used as visual templates.
Shelf space planning in multi-format, multi-store and multi-category retail chains
is a completely open research area. The pros and cons of centralized and hierarchical
planning and the execution problems associated with this have not been studied
empirically or analytically. Retailers increasingly see balancing the beneﬁts of
customizing planograms by store with the increased cost of complexity as a
signiﬁcant source of competitive advantage. A factor possibly counting against
this, however, is that strategic corporate plans may be against store managers’
“gut feeling” and experience, and result in imperfect execution. An interesting
research question here is how to manage the trade-off between “one size ﬁts
all” and “each store to its own.” The incentive conﬂict between central retail
planners, store managers and consumer goods producers is also a valuable area of
research.
Advances in computing resources have permitted the development of more
complex shelf space models that are more consistent with consumer decision
making. Category managers can use these shelf space models to improve their
decision making. However, practitioners tend to use simplistic software tools that
can handle large-scale assortments. Science and practice show a big discrepancy in
this ﬁeld. Academic models have greater analytical capabilities than the commercial
software available, yet they still need to prove implementability. Science focuses on
the approach of large-scale integration of extensive interdependencies of demand,
resulting in complicated and expensive requirements for estimating parameters. The
main barriers to retailer adoption (and thus areas of investigation) are requirements
for large item sets, dynamically changing consumer preferences, model complexity,
difﬁculty of integration into existing systems, and interfaces between marketing and
operations.
This research extended the existing literature that addresses the shelf space
allocation problem. It does so by capturing the critical decision trade-offs faced
by retailers in optimizing their shelf space. This dissertation structures the plan-
ning problems, devises decision support models to maximize category proﬁt, and

7.2
Further Areas for Research
141
provides methods to test the capability of models for category-speciﬁc problems.
The planning issues are illustrated using models with differing levels of integration.
Speciﬁcally, this dissertation develops models that optimize retailers’ decisions
relating to assortment size, number of facings, replenishment frequency and product
prices in a retail category. It would be hugely rewarding to see these models
integrated into day-to-day retail practice, with all the beneﬁts that this would imply
for both the trade and ultimately for the customer.
