Preface
TO THE STUDENT
Here is your ﬁrst quiz in ﬁnite mathematics.
What do the following have in common?
A banker.
A sociologist studying a culture.
A person planning for retirement.
A proud new parent.
A young couple buying their ﬁrst house.
A politician assessing the chances of winning an election.
A gambling casino.
The feedlot operator caught in a highly competitive cattle market.
The marketing manager of a corporation who wants to know if the company
should invest in marketing a new product.
Here is the answer. You get to grade your own quiz.
All of these persons directly or indirectly use or can use some area of ﬁnite
mathematics to help determine the best course of action. Finite Mathematics helps
to analyze problems in business and the social sciences and provides methods that
help determine the implications and consequences of various choices available.
This book gives an introduction to mathematics that is useful to a variety of dis-
ciplines. Mathematics can help you understand the underlying concepts of a disci-
pline. It can help you organize information into a more useful form. Predictions and
trends can be obtained from mathematical models. A mathematical analysis can
provide a basis for making a good decision.
How can this course beneﬁt you? First, you must understand your discipline and
second, you must understand this course. It is up to you to learn your discipline. This
book is written to help you understand the mathematics. Perhaps these suggestions
will be helpful.
1.
You must study the material on a regular basis. Do your homework.
2.
Studytounderstandtheconcepts.Readtheexplanationsandstudytheexamples.
3.
Work the exercises and relate them to the concepts presented. Selected exer-
cises refer to speciﬁc examples to help you get started.
4.
After you work an exercise, take a minute to review what you have done and
make sure you understand how you worked the problem.

Preface
Your general problem-solving skills can improve because of this course. As you
analyze problems, consider which method to use, and work through the solution, you
are experiencing a simple form of the kind of process you will use throughout your
life in your job or in daily living when you respond to the question “Hey, we have a
problem, what should we do?” And most of life’s problems are word problems, so do
those in this course.
Student Aids
Several features in the text assist you in your study of the concepts.
Boldface words indicate new terms.
Boxes emphasize deﬁnitions, theorems, procedures, and summaries.
Notes and Warnings show typical problem areas and provide reminders of con-
cepts introduced earlier.
Review exercises at the end of each chapter help you to review the concepts.
Answers to odd-numbered exercises are provided.
A Student’s Solution Manual contains worked-out solutions to the odd-
numbered exercises. It is available as a separate item.
Important Terms are summarized at the end of each chapter.
Selected exercises are cross-referenced with examples to help you get started
with homework.
TO THE INSTRUCTOR
Mathematics as we know it came into existence through an evolutionary process,
and that process continues today. Occasionally a mathematical idea will fade away
as it is replaced by a better idea. Old ideas become modiﬁed, or new and signiﬁcant
concepts are born and take their place. Some mathematical concepts have been de-
veloped in an attempt to solve problems in a particular discipline. Many disciplines
have found that mathematical concepts are useful in understanding and applying the
ideas of that discipline.
As technology affects more and more areas of the workplace and our culture,
mathematical proﬁciency increases in importance. Science and engineering tradi-
tionally rely heavily on mathematics for analyzing and solving problems. Disciplines
in business, life sciences, and the social sciences have more recently applied and de-
veloped mathematical concepts in an attempt to solve problems in those disciplines.
This book deals with topics, such as functions, linear systems, and matrices, that
serve as useful tools in expressing and analyzing problems in areas using mathemat-
ics. Other topics, such as linear programming, probability, and mathematics of
ﬁnance, have more direct applications to problems in business and industry.
Prerequisites
This book assumes at least three semesters of high-school algebra. Appendix A pro-
vides a brief review for those who may need to refresh their memory.

Preface
xiii
Audience
This book is designed for students majoring in business, the social sciences, and
some areas of the life sciences who wish to develop mathematical and quantitative
skills that will be of value in their discipline. Liberal arts students and prospective
teachers also can proﬁt from the study of several areas of mathematics that apply to
familiar areas of life.
Philosophy
Because the potential audience includes a wide range of students with different in-
terests, the author is sensitive to the needs of students and heeds the advice he re-
ceived years ago, “Write for the student.”
The purpose of Finite Mathematics is the learning of mathematical concepts and
techniques with applications of these concepts as the reason for studying them. For
this reason, the examples and exercises in the text are designed to point toward these
applications. Even so, the application of mathematical concepts requires an under-
standing of the mathematics and an expertise in the area of application. Generally,
a straightforward application of mathematics does not occur because there is a cer-
tain amount of “fuzziness” due to complications, exceptions, and variations. Thus,
an application may be more difﬁcult to accomplish than it appears on the surface. In
spite of the difﬁculties in analyzing real-world problems, we can obtain an idea of the
usefulness of ﬁnite mathematics using examples and exercises that are greatly sim-
pliﬁed versions of actual applications.
While the author assumes only a background in high-school algebra, more chal-
lenging exercises are included for students who are ready to dig deeper. Some exer-
cises involve the use of a graphing calculator or spreadsheet, but the course is de-
signed to be taught independently of them.
CHANGES IN THE SEVENTH EDITION
Some examples and exercises have been updated, replaced, or added. This now pro-
vides 450 examples and over 3500 exercises to give an abundance of homework and
practice problems.
For those who wish to use spreadsheets in the course, instructions on the use of
EXCEL are included. At the end of appropriate sections we show the use of a 
TI-83/84 calculator or an EXCEL spreadsheet as they relate to that section. In ad-
dition, Appendix C provides guidance on the use of EXCEL. 
Continuing Features
Exposition
The author has concentrated on writing that is lucid, friendly, and considerate of the
student. As a result, the text offers a clear explanation of concepts, and the compu-
tations are detailed enough that students can easily follow successive steps in the
problem-solving process.

Exercises
The text contains more than 3500 exercises, including an abundance of word prob-
lems, that provide students ample means to apply mathematical concepts to prob-
lems and give the instructor a variety of choices in assigning problems. 
Exercises are graded by level of difﬁculty: level 1 for routine problems, level 2
for elementary word problems and somewhat more challenging problems, and
level 3 for the most difﬁcult problems. 
“Explorations” exercises encourage students to think more deeply about math-
ematical concepts, often providing an opportunity to use the graphing calculator.
Many of these exercises may be used for group projects or writing assignments.
Cross-Referencing of Examples and Exercises
The exercise sets form an integral part of any mathematics textbook, but they are not
the only part. The exercises are structured to encourage students to read the body of
the text for explanations and examples. We have done this by cross-referencing some
examples with exercises. After reading a particular example, students can go directly
to the referenced exercise to test their understanding. Conversely, selected exercises
refer to an example that illustrates the concepts needed to work them.
Notice how the box plot is constructed. The ends of the box are Q1 and Q3, with the
location of the median shown in the box. Whiskers are attached to each end of the

Stem-and-Leaf Plots
To more orderly organize data into categories, a stem-and-leaf plot can be used. We
do so by breaking the scores into two parts, the stem, consisting of the ﬁrst one or
two digits, and the leaf, consisting of the other digits.
Make a stem-and-leaf plot of the following scores: 21, 13, 17, 24, 48, 7, 31, 46, 44, 39,
9, 15, 10, 41, 46, 33, 24. The second digit becomes a leaf that we list next to its stem.
This process gives a list of second digits corresponding to a stem.
Solution
We use the ﬁrst digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 for the stems, which will divide the data into inter-
vals 0 –9, 10 –19, 20 –29, 30 –39, and 40 – 49.

Notice that the digits for the leaves are not in order. They can be listed as they

(a) Use the 1980 and 2004 ﬁgures to ﬁnd birth rate
as a linear function of number of years since
1980.
(b) Use the linear function to estimate the birth
rate for 1985. Does it give a realistic rate?
(c) Use the linear function to determine when the
birth rate will reach zero. Comment on the
reasonableness of the result.
116. The U.S. Census Bureau reports a wide variety of
population information. One bit of information is
the percentage of the population that never marries.
(a) In 1980, the percentage of males in the 20 –24
age group who had never married was 68.8%.
In 2000 the percentage rose to 83.7%.
(i) Based on this information, ﬁnd the per-
centage of unmarried males as a linear
function of time in years since 1980.
(ii) Use the linear function you found to esti-
mate the percentage of males, ages 20 – 24,
who never married for the year 1998.
(iii) The actual percentage given by the
Census Bureau for 1998 was 83.4%. How
does this compare with your estimate?
Does the linear function found in part (i)
seem to be a reasonably good representa-
tion of the growth of the percentage?
(b) In 1980, 50.2% of the female population in the
20 –24 age range had never married. The per-
centage rose to 72.8% in 2000.
(i) Based on this information, ﬁnd the per-
centage of females who had never married
as a linear function of time in years since
1980.
(ii) Use the linear function just found to 
estimate the percentage of females, ages
20 –24, who had never married for the
year 1998.
(iii) The actual percentage reported by the
Census Bureau for 1998 was 70.3%. Com-
pare the estimate obtained in part (ii).
Does the linear function seem to provide
a reasonable estimate of the growth of 
the percentage of females who never 
married?
117. The manager of the Ivy Square Cinema observed
that Friday night estimated ticket sales were 185
when the admission was $5. When the admission
was increased to $6, the estimated attendance fell
to 140.
(a) Use this information to ﬁnd estimated atten-
dance as a linear function of admission price.
(b) Use the function found in part (a) to estimate
attendance if admission is increased to $7.
(c) Use the function found in part (a) to deter-
mine the admission price that will yield an esti-
mated attendance of 250.
(d) The manager had no desire to set an admission
price that would drive away all customers, but
she was curious to know when that would oc-
cur. Based on the function in part (a), ﬁnd the
admission price that would result in a zero at-
tendance. (Does this seem reasonable to you?)
(e) The manager was also curious to know what
kind of attendance would result from free 
admission to all. (Popcorn sales should zoom

Preface

More than 450 examples illustrate the useful application of the mathematics
studied.
Discussion questions provide the option of using the graphing calculator or
spreadsheet technology to solve the problem. 
Technology boxes focus on concepts and walk students through the exercises us-
ing the graphing calculator and EXCEL spreadsheets. 
Appendix B provides guidance on use of the TI-83/84 graphing calculator. The
Graphing Calculator Manual, available on the book’s website, offers more in-depth
coverage. 
Use of Technology
A graphing calculator or spreadsheet is not required to use the textbook. However,
for those who wish to incorporate a graphing calculator or spreadsheet in the course, 
some exploration exercises show a graphing calculator icon 
or a spreadsheet 
A company made a cost study and found that it cost $10,170 to produce 800 pairs of
running shoes and $13,810 to produce 1150 pairs.
(a) Determine the cost–volume function.
(b) Find the ﬁxed cost and the unit cost.
Solution
(a) Let x=the number of pairs. The information gives two points on the cost–
volume line: (800, 10170) and (1150, 13810). The slope of the line is
Using the point (800, 10170) in the point-slope equation, we have
y-10,170=10.40(x-800)
y=10.40x+1850
Therefore, C(x)=10.40x+1850.
(b) From the equation C(x)=10.40x+1850, the ﬁxed cost is $1850 per week, and
the unit cost is $10.40.

Mathematics is a powerful tool used in the design of automobiles, electronic
equipment, and buildings. It helps in solving problems of business, industry,
environment,science,and social sciences.Mathematics helps to predict sales,
population growth,the outcome of elections,and the location of black holes.
Some techniques of mathematics are straightforward;others are complicated
and difﬁcult.Nearly all practical problems involve two or more quantities that
are related in some manner. For example, the amount withheld from a pay-
check for FICA is related to an employee’s salary; the area of a rectangle is re-
lated to the length of its sides (area=length  width);the amount charged
for sales tax depends on the price of an item;and UPS shipping costs depend
on the weight of the package and the distance shipped.
One of the simplest relationships between variables can be represented
by a straight line,a basic geometric concept encountered by people of differ-
ent ages, cultures, and times in history. Few people likely contemplate the
common property held by the shaft of an arrow, the tightly stretched rope
used by a sailor, the fold of a blanket, the crease formed by folding a paper, a
string between two stakes to plant a straight row of vegetables,the stripes on
a parking lot, the boundaries of a basketball court, and the representation of
streets and highways on a map.
We realize that the “lines”mentioned are not really lines.They are at best
an approximation of a line segment.They may not be exactly straight, a bas-
ketball court boundary is really a stripe,and the most carefully drawn line has
“ragged edges”when enlarged sufﬁciently.
The ancient Greeks are credited with the generalization and abstraction of
geometric concepts such as the ideal line.We mention this because the ideal
line— the line that expresses the essence of the stretched rope, the mark in
the sand, or the artist’s ﬁnely drawn line—can be extended to certain
relationships between two variables and can be expressed mathematically

and used to give insight into the behavior of phenomena and activities in sci-
ence, business, and some daily activities. In this chapter we discuss linear
equations and their applications.
1.1
FUNCTIONS
Mathematicians formalize certain kinds of relationships between quantities and call
them functions. Nearly always in this book, the quantities involved are measured by
real numbers.
A function consists of three parts: two sets and a rule. The rule of a function de-
scribes the relationship between a number in the ﬁrst set (called the domain) and a
number in the second set (called the range). The rule is often stated in the form of
an equation like A=length2 for the relationship between the area of a square and
the length of a side.
In this case, the domain consists of the set of numbers representing lengths and
the range consists of the set of numbers representing areas.
A function is a rule that assigns to each number from the ﬁrst set (domain) exactly one
number from the second set (range).
We generally use the letter x to represent a number from the ﬁrst set and the let-
ter y to represent a number from the second set. Thus, for each value of x there is
exactly one value of y assigned to x.
Generally, a number may be arbitrarily selected from the domain, so x is called
an independent variable. Once a value of x is selected, the rule determines the cor-
responding value of y. Because y depends on the value of x, y is called a dependent
variable.
Mr. Riggs consults for a trailer manufacturing company. His fee is $300 for miscella-
neous expenses plus $50 per hour. What is the domain of this function? The number
of hours worked determines the fee, so the domain consists of the number of hours
worked and the range consists of the fees charged. It makes sense to say that hours
worked must be a positive number, and the minimum fee is $300. Thus, positive num-
bers make the domain, and numbers 300 or larger make the range. The rule that de-
termines the fee that corresponds to the number of consulting hours is given by the
formula
y=50x+300
where x represents the number of hours consulted and y represents the total fee in
dollars. Notice that the formula gives exactly one fee for each number of consulting
hours. So, the domain consists of the set of numbers representing hours worked, and
the range consists of the set of numbers representing the dollar amount of fees.

In some cases, the quantities in the domain and range of a function may be limited
to a few values, as illustrated in the next example.
Example 1

1.1
Functions

When a family goes to a concert, the amount paid depends on the number attend-
ing; that is, the total admission is a function of the number attending. The ticket
ofﬁce usually has a chart giving total admission, so for them the rule is a chart some-
thing like this:
From the chart, the domain is the set of numbers representing the number of tickets
sold. Because we never sell a fractional number of tickets, the domain is restricted
to positive integers. In this case, the domain is the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 3,pg.6 ■
Mathematicians have a standard notation for functions. For example, the equation
y=50x+300 is often written as
f(x)=50x+300
f(x) is read “f of x,” indicating “f is a function of x.” The notation f(x) is a way of
naming a function f and indicating that the variable used is x. The notation g(t) in-
dicates another function named g using the variable t. The f(x) notation is espe-
cially useful to indicate the substitution of a number for x. f(3) looks as though 3 has
been put in place of x in f(x). This is the correct interpretation. f(3) represents the
value of the function when 3 is substituted for x in
f(x)=50x+300
That is,
f(3)=50(3)+300
=150+300
=450
The next three examples illustrate some uses of the f(x) type notation.
(a) If f(x)=–7x+22, then
f(2)=–7(2)+22=8
f(–1)=–7(–1)+22
=7+22
=29
(b) If f(x)=4x-11, then
f(5)=4(5)-11
=20-11
=9

Note: Sometimes the equation that deﬁnes a function, the rule that relates numbers
in the domain to those in the range, is given, but the domain and range are not
speciﬁed. In such cases, we deﬁne the domain to be all real numbers that can be sub-
stituted for x and that yield a real number for y. The range is the set of values of y
so obtained. For example, x=9 is in the domain of 
because it yields the
real number y=3. However, x=–4 is not in the domain because 
is not a real
number.
For f(x)=
, 2 is in the domain because f(2)=
but 5 is not in
the domain because f (5)= , which is undeﬁned. In fact, the domain consists of all
real numbers except x=5.
When applying a function, the nature of the application may restrict the domain
or range. For example, the function that determines the amount of postage depends
on the weight of the letter. It makes no sense for the domain to contain negative val-
ues of weight.
We conclude this section with some applications.
From 1980 to 2000, the population of the United States can be estimated with the
function
p(t)=2.745t-5210.35
where
t=the year
p(t)=the population in millions
(a) Based on this function, ﬁnd p(1970). Find p(2010).
(b) Estimate when the population will reach 300 million. 
Solution
(a) p(1970)=2.745(1970)-5210.35=5407.65-5210.35=197.3 million.
p(2010)=2.745(2010)-5210.35=307.1 million

Andy works at Papa Rolla’s Pizza Parlor. He makes $8 per hour and time-and-a-half
for all hours over 40 in a week. Thus, his weekly salary is S(h)=12h+320, where
h is the number of hours overtime and S(h) is his weekly salary.
(a) What is S(5.25)?
(b) Find his weekly salary when he works 44.5 hours.
(c) One week Andy’s salary was $362. How many hours overtime did he work?
Solution
(a) S(5.25)=12(5.25)+320=383
(b) In this case, h=44.5-40=4.5, so S(h)=12(4.5)+320=374.
His salary was $374.
(c) S(h)=362, so
362=12h+320
12h=362-320=42
h= =3.5
Andy worked 3.5 hours overtime.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 23,pg.8 ■
Observe that we use letters other than f and x to represent functions and variables.
We might refer to the cost of producing x items as C(x)=5x+540; the price of x
pounds of steak as p(x)=5.19x; the area of a circle of radius r as A(r)=pr 2; and
the distance in feet an object falls in t seconds as d(t)=16t2.
A function requires that each number in the domain be associated with exactly
one number in the range. Sometimes a rule assigns more than one number in the
range to a number in the domain. In such a case, the relationship is not a function.
Here is an example.
A grocery store sells apples for $1.29 a pound. When Sarah buys six apples (x=6),
the checker determines the weight in order to know the cost. The six apples of the
customer behind Sarah likely will correspond to a different weight. Thus, the weight
“function” of x apples is not a function of the number of apples because a number in
the domain (number of apples) may be related to more than one number in the
range (weight of x apples).
If we let x=the weight of the apples, then the cost relation to x pounds is a
function because there is a unique cost for a given weight.

Functions and Lines
The domain of a linear function often includes all real numbers, but a function can
have a limited domain or range. The function may not even be described by an equa-
tion. For example, a weather station monitors temperatures that are plotted to yield
a graph like this.
The domain is the time from midnight through the day to 11:59 p.m. The range is the
set of temperatures from 22 degrees to 50 degrees, written as [22°, 50°] in interval
notation.

Explorations
41. The domain and range of functions can be sets
other than sets of numbers. For example, the
Fingerprint Function has the set of all people for
the domain and the set of all individual’s ﬁnger-
prints for the range. Since each person has ﬁnger-
prints unique to him or her, there is exactly one set
of ﬁngerprints in the range for each person in the
domain. Thus, this is a function assuming each per-
son has at least one ﬁnger. Would this be a function
if someone in the set of people had no hands?
If we reverse the role and use the set of all
ﬁngerprints as the domain, then each set of ﬁnger-
prints belongs to just one person, so it is a function
with the range consisting of those people who have
ﬁngerprints.
Give three examples of a function for which 
either the domain or the range is not a set of 
numbers.
42. The U.S. Department of Health conducted a survey

indicate that the linear function
y=– 0.44x+919.46
gives an estimate of the percentage of the 
18–25 age group using cigarettes. The variable 
x represents the year, and y represents the percent-
age using cigarettes.

2000, 2010, and 2020.
(b) When does y reach 20?
(c) What does your answer in part (b) mean?
43. Bivin is the ﬁtness director at Lake Air Fitness
Center. He recommends that the intensity of aero-
bic activities be measured by pulse rate. Following
generally accepted practice, he recommends that
the clients achieve a pulse rate depending on their
age and level of activity. The target pulse rate is 
determined as follows: Subtract the person’s age
from 220 to obtain a “maximum pulse rate.” Those
beginning aerobic activities should exercise at a
level so that their pulse rate (per
minute) is 40% of their maximum
rate. For burning calories, the person
should exercise at a level that
achieves 70% of his or her maximum
rate.
State what the variables repre-
sent and write the equations that give
the relationship between a person’s
age and desired pulse rate for 
(a) the beginner, and
(b) the person desiring to burn calories.
44. Here is a game to determine a person’s age and
month of birth. Take an example of an 18-year-old
who was born in November. The person does the
following computations without telling you any-
thing except the ﬁnal answer. Have the person start
with the number of the month of birth and proceed
as follows.
Number of month of birth
11
Multiply by 2
22
Add 5
27
Multiply by 50
1350
Then add the person’s age, 18
1368
Subtract 365, giving
1003
Next, add 115
1118
The person gives their result, 1118, whereupon you
announce the person’s age is 18 (from the last two
digits) and the birth month is November (from the
ﬁrst two digits).
Now you are to show how this procedure
works in general. Let M represent the number of

Deﬁnition of a Graph
“A picture is worth a thousand words” may be an overworked phrase, but it does
convey an important idea. You may even occasionally use the expression “Oh, I
see!” when you really grasp a difﬁcult concept. A graph of a function shows a picture
of a function and can help you to understand the behavior of the function.
A graph often makes it easier to notice trends and to draw conclusions. Let’s look
at an elementary example. Jason kept a record of the number of e-mail messages he
received. He told his roommate that he averaged 12 messages per day over a two-
week period. “Tell me more,” was his roommate’s response. “Were there any days
when you received none? What’s the most you got? How many times did you get 12
messages? On what days, if any, did you receive 20 messages?”
To satisfy his roommate’s curiosity and obtain the information of interest, Jason
made a graph showing the number of messages for each day. Figure 1–1 shows the
graph.
The graph shows that Jason received at least 7 messages each day. The largest
number of messages was 26 on the tenth day. The graph shows no consistent pattern
of the number of messages but indicates that there is considerable variation from day
to day. He never received exactly 12 messages, although the graph does coincide with
12 messages at about days 4.3, 7.5, 8.5, and 11.5. This doesn’t make much sense, but
it does illustrate an important point.
The daily number of messages really should be unconnected dots. However, it is
much harder to get information from a graph drawn with just dots. Remember those
drawings you made as a child by connecting the dots? The picture made a lot more
sense after you drew in the connecting lines. In Figure 1–1, we sacriﬁced some tech-
nical accuracy by “connecting the dots” but got a better picture of what happened
by doing so. Professional users of mathematics do the same thing; an accountant may
let C(x) represent the cost of manufacturing x items, or a history professor may let
P(x) represent the class attendance in American history for day x of the course. In
reality, the domains of these functions involve only positive integers. But many
methods of mathematics require the domain of the function to be an interval or in-
tervals, rather than isolated points. These methods have proven so powerful in solv-
ing problems that people set up their functions using such domains. They then use
some common sense in interpreting their answer. If the manager ﬁnds that the most
efﬁcient number of people to assign to a project is 54.87, she will probably end up us-
ing either 54 or 55 people.
Because the picture of a function might help convey the information the func-
tion represents, we might ask how the picture of a function, its graph, relates to the
rule, or equation, of the function. We obtain a point on a graph from the value of a
number in the domain, x, and the corresponding value of the function, f(x). We ob-
tain the complete graph by using all numbers in the domain. Here is the deﬁnition.

DEFINITION
Graph of a Function
1.2
Graphs and Lines
15
The graph of a function f is the set of points (x, y) in the plane that satisfy the equation
y=f(x).
Generally, it is impossible to plot all points of the graph of a function. Sometimes
we can ﬁnd several points on the graph, and that sufﬁces to give us the general shape
of the graph.
We write the function
f(x)=2x2-3
as
y=2x2-3
so that we can relate the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of points on its graph to
the equation of the function.
When x=2, we ﬁnd from y=2A22B-3
that y=5, so the ordered pair (2, 5), is a solu-
tion to y=2x2-3.
Thus, the point (2, 5) is a point on the graph
ofy=2x2-3.Othersolutionsincludetheor-
dered pairs (points on the graph) (–2, 5),
(0.5, –2.5), (3, 15), (0, –3), (–1, –1), and
(5, 47). When we plot these points and all other
points that are solutions, we have the graph of
the function y=2x2-3 (Figure 1–2). Since
the graph of y=2x2-3 extends upward
indeﬁnitely, we cannot show all points on the
graph. We can, however, show enough to con-
vey the shape and location of the graph.

Chapter 1
Functions and Lines
As we develop different mathematical techniques throughout this text, we will use
some concrete applications. This in turn will require some familiarity with the func-
tions involved and some idea of the shape of their graphs. We start with the simplest
functions and graphs.
Linear Functions and Straight Lines
A function is called a linear function if its rule—its deﬁning equation—can be written
f(x)=mx+b. Such a function is called linear because its graph is a straight line.
From geometry we learned that two points determine a line. One point and the
direction of a line also determine a line. We will learn how to ﬁnd the equation of a
line in each of these situations.
Let’s see how we can draw the graph of f(x)=2x+5.
Solution
The graph will be a straight line, and it takes just two
points to determine a straight line. If we let x=1,
then we have f(1)=7; if we let x=4, then
f(4)=13. This means that the points (1, 7) and
(4, 13) are on the graph of f(x)=2x+5. Because
we also use y for f(x), we could also say that these
points are on the line y=2x+5. By plotting the
points (1, 7) and (4, 13) and drawing the line through
them, we obtain Figure 1–3. (We can use any pair of 
x-values to get two points on the line.) It is usually a
good idea to plot a third point to help catch any error.
Because f(0)=5, the point (0, 5) is also on the graph
of f.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 1,pg.28 ■
Slope and Intercept
The equations such as y=3x+8, y=–2.5x+17, and y=12.1x-62 are equa-
tions of lines, and all are of the form y=mx+b. In that form, the constants m
and b give key information about the line. The constant b is the value of y that cor-
responds to x=0, so (0, b) is a point on the line. We call (0, b) the y-intercept of
the line, because it tells where the line intercepts the y-axis. A common practice
shortens the y-intercept notation of (0, b) to just the letter b. Thus, in the linear
equation y=mx+b, b is called the y-intercept of the line. The other constant, m,
determines the direction, or slant, of a line. We call m the slope of the line. It meas-
ures the relative steepness of a line and will be discussed in detail later.
Notice the equation of the line in Example 2 can be written y=2x+5, so it
has slope m=2, a y-intercept of 5, and passes through (0, 5).

Caution
The coefﬁcient of x in
a general linear equa-
tion does not auto-
matically give you 
the slope of the line.
When the equation of
the line is in the form
y=mx+b, the
coefﬁcient of x is the
slope of the line,and
the constant term is
the y-intercept.If the
equation is in another
form,it is a good idea
to change to this form
to determine the slope
and y-intercept.

y=mx+b
Slope Formula
For a linear function written in the form y=mx+b, b is called the y-intercept of the line
and (0, b) is on the line.
m is called the slope of the line and determines the direction and steepness of the line.
Find the slope and y-intercept of each of the following lines.
(a) y=3x-5
(b) y=–6x+15
Solution
(a) For the line y=3x-5, the slope m=3 and the y-intercept b=–5.
(b) For the line y=–6x+15, the slope is –6 and the y-intercept is 15.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 7,pg.28 ■
Some equations may represent a line even though they are not in the form
y=mx+b. The next example illustrates how we can still ﬁnd the slope and 
y-intercept of those lines.
Find the slope and y-intercept of the line 3x+2y-4=0.
Solution
We rewrite the equation 3x+2y-4=0 in the slope-intercept form, y=
mx+b, by solving the given equation for y:
3x+2y-4=0
2y=–3x+4
y=
Thus, the slope-intercept form is 
Now we can say that the slope 
is 
and the y-intercept is 2.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 11,pg.28 ■
Now let’s use the linear function y=2x+5 to illustrate the way the slope relates
to the direction of a line. Select two points on the line y=2x+5, such as (1, 7) and
(4, 13). (See Figure 1– 4.) Compute the difference in the y-coordinates of the two
points: 13-7=6. Now compute the difference in x-coordinates: 4-1=3. The
quotient 
is m, and the slope of the line y=2x+5. Following this procedure
with any other two points on the line y=2x+5 will also yield the answer 2.
Examples 3 and 4 illustrate the following general formula that shows how to
compute the slope of a line.
Choose two points P and Q on the line. Let (x1, y1) be the coordinates of P and (x2, y2)
be the coordinates of Q. The slope of the line, m, is given by the equation

The two preceding examples suggest the direction a line takes when the slope is pos-
itive and when it is negative.
Now we consider situations when the slope is neither positive nor negative.
Horizontal and Vertical Lines
Find the equation of the line through the points (3, 4) and (7, 4).
Solution
The slope of the line is
Whenever m=0, we can write the equation f(x)=0x+b more simply as
f(x)=b; f is called the constant function. The graph of a constant function is a line
parallel to the x-axis; such a line has an equation of the form y=b and is called a
horizontal line. (See Figure 1–8.) Because all points on a horizontal line have the same
y-coordinates, the value of b can be determined from the y-coordinate of any point
on the line. The equation of the line in this example is y=4.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 23,pg.28 ■
When the slope of a line is zero, the line is a horizontal line. Conversely, a horizon-

which doesn’t make sense because division by zero is not deﬁned. The slope is 
not deﬁned. When we plot the two points, however, we have no difﬁculty in drawing
the line through them. See Figure 1–9.
The line, parallel to the y-axis, is called a vertical line. A point lies on this line
when the ﬁrst coordinate of the point is 4, so the equation of the line is x=4.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 31,pg.28 ■
When the slope of a line is undeﬁned, the line is a vertical line. Conversely, a verti-
cal line has undeﬁned slope.
The slope of a vertical line is undeﬁned.
Whenever x2=x1, you get a 0 in the denominator when computing the slope,
so we say that the slope does not exist for such a line.
The slope of a line can be positive, negative, zero, or even not exist. These situ-
ations are depicted in Figure 1–10.
This ﬁgure shows the relationship between the slope and the slant of the line. If
m>0, the graph slants up as x moves to the right. If m<0, the graph slants down
as x moves to the right. If m=0, the graph remains at the same height. If m does
not exist, the line is vertical, and the line is not the graph of a linear function. The
equation of a vertical line cannot be written in the form f(x)=mx+b because
there is no m.
We conclude this section by showing how to ﬁnd equations of lines. Linear func-
tions arise in many applied settings. When an application provides the appropriate
two pieces of information, you can ﬁnd an equation of the corresponding line. This
information may be given either as:
1.
the slope and a point on the line or
2.
two points on the line.
We now show each form in a particular application and then give the general method
of solving the problem.

Determine an equation of the line with slope 3 and y-intercept 2.
Solution
This information gives m=3 and b=2 in the equation y=mx+b, so the equa-
tion is
y=3x+2
The graph of this equation is shown in Figure 1–11.

When the slope of a line and a point on the line are given, we can ﬁnd the values of
m and b in the slope-intercept form y=mx+b.
Determine an equation of the line that has slope –2 and passes through the point
(–3, 5).
Solution
The value of m=–2, so the line has an equation of form
y=–2x+b
To complete the solution, we ﬁnd the value of b. Since the point (–3, 5) lies on the
line, x=–3 and y=5 must be a solution to y=–2x+b. Just substitute those
values into y=–2x+b to obtain
5=(–2)(–3)+b
5=6+b
5-6=b
Thus, b=–1 and the equation of the line is y=–2x-1. The graph of this equa-
tion is shown in Figure 1–12.

The following table displays some values of x and the corresponding values of y for
the line y=–2x-1 from Example 10. The values of x listed increase in steps of 2
in order to point out that y also changes in equal steps (–4). Although the step size
for y differs from the step size of x, they are related. Observe that the change in y
equals the slope times the change in xA–4=–2(2)B. This relationship holds in gen-
eral for linear functions.
In general, the step size of y is m times the step size of x.

Point-Slope
Equation
22
Chapter 1
Functions and Lines
We can use another method for writing the equation of a line when the slope and
a point are given. We call this method the point-slope equation.
Point-Slope Equation
We will work with the information in Example 10, m=–2 and the point (–3, 5).
Use the slope formula with (–3, 5) as (x1, y1) and use an arbitrary point, (x, y), as
Ax2, y2B. Because m=–2, we can write
Multiply both sides by x+3 to obtain
–2(x+3)=y-5
The formula is usually written as
y-5=–2(x+3)
Check that this has the same slope-intercept form as we obtained in Example 10.
Notice what we did in this example and observe that the procedure generally
holds. When we are given the slope of a line, m, and a speciﬁc point on the line,
Ax1, y1B, then for any other point on the line, (x, y), the slope of the line can be 
obtained as 
so we write
Now multiply through by x-x1 to obtain
y-y1=mAx-x1B
an equation of a line with a given slope and point.
If a line has slope m and passes through Ax1, y1B, an equation of the line is
y-y1=mAx-x1B
Now we use the point-slope equation to ﬁnd the equation of a line.
Find an equation of the line with slope 4 that passes through (–1, 5).
Solution
x1=–1 and y1=5; m=4, so the point-slope formula gives us 
y-5=4Ax-(–1)B=4(x+1)
which can be simpliﬁed to y=4x+9.

Now let’s look at a simple application of a linear function that illustrates the role of
the slope and the y-intercept.
Carlos started a paper route and decided to add $7 each week to his savings account.
By the eighth week, he had $242 in savings. Write his total savings as a linear func-
tion of the number of weeks since he started his paper route.
Solution
This example gives the slope and one point on the line.
Let x be the number of weeks and y be the total in savings. Each time x increases
by 1 (one week), y increases by 7 ($7 deposit). Thus, the slope equals
In this case the slope gives the change of dollars per week, so it represents $7 per week.
At 8 weeks, the savings totaled $242, so the point (8, 242) lies on the line. Using
the point-slope formula, we have
y-242=7(x-8)
Solving for y, we have y=7x+186.
Notice that the y-intercept, 186, indicates that Carlos had $186 when he decided
to start his periodic savings.

Two-Point Equation
Just as we have a point-slope formula, we have a formula for ﬁnding an equation of
a line using the coordinates of two points on the line.
If a line passes through the points Ax1, y1B and Ax2, y2B, with x1 Z x2, an equation of the 
line is
y-y1=mAx-x1B
where
Notice that the two-point equation is a variation of the point-slope equation.
The two given points enable us to ﬁnd the slope. Then use the slope and one of the
given points in the point-slope equation. (It doesn’t matter which one of the two
points is used.)
m = y2 - y1

m = change in y

An electric utility computes the monthly electric bill for residential customers with
a linear function of the number of kilowatt hours (kWh) used. One month, a cus-
tomer used 1560 kWh, and the bill was $118.82. The next month, the bill was $102.26
for 1330 kWh used. Identify the variables x and y, and ﬁnd the equation relating
kWh used and the monthly bill.
Solution
Let x=the number of kWh used and y=the monthly bill. The information pro-
vided gives two points on the line, (1560, 118.82) and (1330, 102.26). The slope of the
line is
In this case m represents the cost per kWh.
The equation can now be written as
y-102.26=0.072(x-1330)
y-102.26=0.072x-95.76

The x-Intercept
The x-intercept of a line is similar to the y-intercept. It is the x-coordinate of the
point where the line crosses the x-axis. To ﬁnd the x-intercept, set y=0 in the lin-
ear equation and solve for x.

let m1 be its slope. Then,
Let L2 be the line through (3, 1) and (11, 11)

When we have the equation of a line, we can ﬁnd the equation of a parallel line, pro-
vided we know a point on the second line. We illustrate this by ﬁnding the line
through the point (8, 5) that is parallel to the line 4x-3y=12. We know a
point on the line—namely, (8, 5)—and we can ﬁnd the slope from the given line
4x-3y=12 by putting it in the slope-intercept form:
The desired slope is 
so the equation of the parallel line is found from
We can put this in another standard form by multiplying by 3
3y=4x-17
or
4x-3y=17
Notice that the coefﬁcients of x and y are the same as those in the given line. This
generally holds, giving us another way to ﬁnd the equation of the parallel line using
the knowledge that its equation is of the form
4x-3y=some constant
Since the point (8, 5) lies on the line, it must give the desired constant when the co-
ordinates are used for x and y; that is,
4(8)-3(5)=the constant
and the equation is

119. On October 14, 2002, Audrey Mestre, a French
woman, died attempting to break the world record
in free diving. In free diving, a diver, without oxy-

pull them into the ocean depths. Ms. Mestre’s goal
was a depth of 561 feet, which would have set a new
record. As a diver descends, the pressure increases
due to the weight of the water above. At 18 feet, the
water pressure is approximately 8 pounds per

Applications of Linear Inequalities
Nat Hambrick is a contractor in a competitive construction market. He needs to an-
swer such questions as, “We want to add another ﬂoor to the top of the Amico
Building for an elite restaurant. Will the present building support it?” “Will this roof
design support a 2-foot snowfall?” “Will the proposed ofﬁce tower withstand 100-
mile-per-hour winds?”
The building trade knows how to handle many problems from past experiences
of successes and failures. A builder may avoid a failure by deliberately overdesign-
ing, but that may drive up costs until the builder cannot compete. Because a trial-
and-error approach may result in costly failures or expensive successes, an approach
that uses proper mathematical analyses can provide valuable answers. Engineers
have developed mathematical equations and formulas, called mathematical models,
that can be used to answer “what if?” questions of building design.

Mathematical Models and Applications of Linear Functions
39
Mathematical models abound in numerous other disciplines. They describe sci-
entiﬁc phenomena, population growth, sociological trends, economic growth, and
product costs. Politicians depend on mathematically based opinion polls to deter-
mine campaign strategy.
One of the more famous mathematical models is the equation E=mc 2, which
was chalked on sidewalks of campuses across the nation on April 19, 1955, the day
after Albert Einstein died. Written in tribute to his profound work on the theory of
relativity, this equation relates energy, E, the mass of a body, m, and the speed of
light, c. This equation does not tell all about energy, but it describes the energy
released when matter is fully transformed into energy. It helps predict the energy
released from uranium and the energy stored in the Sun.
Although mathematical models generally only approximate the real situations,
they can be useful in making decisions and estimating the consequences of these de-
cisions: A mathematical analysis can help a hospital administrator determine the
most economical order for the quantity of X-ray ﬁlms, can give a proud new grand-
parent an estimate of the worth of an investment when the grandchild begins college,
or can help the phone company plan for the growing demand for cell phones.
Applications
In practical problems, the relationship between the variables can be quite compli-
cated. For example, the variables and their relationship that affect the stock market
still defy the best analysts. However, many times a linear relationship can be used to
provide a reasonable and useful model for solving practical problems. We now look
at several applications of the linear function.
Cost–Volume Function
The manufacturer of a home theater system conducted a study of production costs
and found that ﬁxed costs averaged $5600 per week and component costs averaged
$359 per system. This information can be stated as
C=359x+5600
where x represents the number of systems produced per week, also called the vol-
ume, and C is the total weekly cost of producing x systems. A linear function like this
is used when:
1. there are ﬁxed costs—such as rent, utilities, and salaries—that are the same
each week, independent of the number of items produced;
2. there are variable costs that depend on the number of items produced, such as
the cost of materials for the items, packaging, and shipping costs.
The home theater system  example illustrates a linear cost–volume function (of-
ten simply called the cost function). A linear function is appropriate when the gen-
eral form of the cost function C is given by
C(x)=ax+b
where
x is the number of items produced (volume),
b is the ﬁxed cost in dollars,
a is the unit cost (the cost per item) in dollars,
C(x) is the total cost in dollars of producing x items.

40
Chapter 1
Functions and Lines
Notice the form of the cost function. It is essentially the slope-intercept form of a
line, where the slope is the unit cost and the intercept is the ﬁxed cost.
If the cost of manufacturing x home theater systems per week is given by
C(x)=415x+5200
then:
(a) Determine the unit cost and the ﬁxed cost.
(b) Determine the cost of producing 700 systems per week.
(c) Determine how many systems were produced if the production cost for one
week was $230,130.
Solution
(a) The unit cost is $415, and the ﬁxed cost is $5200 per week.
(b) Substitute x=700 into the cost equation to obtain
C(700)=415(700)+5200
=290,500+5200
=295,700
So, the total cost is $295,700. (See Figure 1–16.)

Cost of producing x systems per week
C(x) = 415x + 5200
Fixed cost
$5200
(c) This information gives C(x)=230,130, so we have
230,130=415x+5200
We need to solve this for x:
So, 542 systems were produced that week.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 1,pg.50 ■
The unit cost and ﬁxed costs may not be known directly, but the cost function can be
obtained if the information gives two points on the line, as illustrated in the next
example.
 x = 224,930
415
= 542
 224,930 = 415x
 230,130 - 5200 = 415x

A company made a cost study and found that it cost $10,170 to produce 800 pairs of
running shoes and $13,810 to produce 1150 pairs.
(a) Determine the cost–volume function.
(b) Find the ﬁxed cost and the unit cost.
Solution
(a) Let x=the number of pairs. The information gives two points on the cost–
volume line: (800, 10170) and (1150, 13810). The slope of the line is
Using the point (800, 10170) in the point-slope equation, we have
y-10,170=10.40(x-800)
y=10.40x+1850

Revenue Function
T’s and More specializes in T-shirts for fraternities and sororities. They sell their
T-shirts for $13.50 each. The total income (revenue) in dollars is 13.50 times the num-
ber of shirts sold. This illustrates the general concept of a revenue function; it gives the
total revenue from the sale of x items. This example gives the revenue function as
R(x)=13.50x
where x represents the number of T-shirts sold, 13.50 is the selling price in dollars
for each item, and R(x) is the total revenue in dollars from x items.
T’s and More has a sale on T-shirts at $12.25 each.
(a) Give the revenue function.
(b) The store sold 213 T-shirts. What was the total revenue?
(c) One sorority bought $575.75 worth of T-shirts. How many did they buy?
Solution
(a) The revenue function is given by
R(x)=12.25x
(b) The revenue for 213 shirts is obtained from the revenue function when x=213:
R(213)=12.25(213)=2609.25
The total revenue was $2609.25.

Break-Even Analysis
Break-even analysis answers a common management question: At what sales vol-
ume will we break even? When do revenues equal costs? Greater sales will induce a
proﬁt, whereas lesser sales will show a loss.
The break-even point occurs when the cost equals the revenue, so the cost and
revenue functions can be used to determine the break-even point. Using function
notation, we write this as C(x)=R(x).
The point at which cost equals revenue,
C(x)=R(x)
Cox’s Department Store pays $99 each for DVD players. The store’s monthly ﬁxed

(c) The break-even point occurs when cost equals revenue,
C(x)=R(x)
Writing out the function gives
99x+1250=189.95x
The solution of this equation gives the break-even point:
Because x represents the number of DVD players, we use the next integer, 14, as the
number sold per month to break even. If 14 or more are sold, there will be a proﬁt.
If fewer than 14 are sold, there will be a loss.
The break-even point is at x=14 DVD players, with a revenue of $2659.30.
Geometrically (See Figure 1–17), the break-even point occurs where the cost
function and revenue function intersect. A proﬁt occurs for the values of x when the
graph of the revenue function is above the cost function. At a given value of x,
the proﬁt is the vertical distance between the graphs. Similarly, a loss occurs when
the graph of the revenue function is below the graph of the cost function and the
amount of the loss is represented by the vertical distance between the graphs.

A temporary secretarial service has a ﬁxed weekly cost of $896. The wages and
beneﬁts of the secretaries amount to $7.65 per hour. A ﬁrm that employs a secretary
pays Temporary Service $10.40 per hour. How many hours per week of secretarial
service must Temporary Service place to break even?
Solution
First, write the cost and revenue functions. The ﬁxed cost is $896, and the unit cost
is $7.65, so the cost function is given by
C(x)=7.65x+896
where x is the number of hours placed each
week. The revenue function is given by
R(x)=10.40x
Equating cost and revenue, we have
7.65x+896=10.40x
This equation reduces to
 2.75x = 896
 10.40x - 7.65x = 896

Straight-Line Depreciation
To prepare a tax return and report the ﬁnancial condition of a company to its stock-
holders, a company needs to estimate the value of buildings, equipment, and so on.
Part of this procedure sometimes uses a linear function to estimate the value of
equipment. For instance, when a corporation buys a ﬂeet of cars, it expects them to
decline in value because of wear and tear. For example, if the corporation purchases
new cars for $17,500 each, they may be worth only $5500 each three years later, due
to normal wear and tear. This decline in value is called depreciation. The value of an
item after deducting depreciation is called its book value. In three years, each car de-
preciated $12,000, and its book value at the end of three years was $5500. For tax and
accounting purposes, a company will report depreciation and book value each year
during the life of an item. The Internal Revenue Service allows several methods of
depreciation. The simplest is straight-line depreciation. This method assumes that
the book value is a linear function of time—that is,
B=mx+b
where B is the book value and x is the number of years. For example, each car had
a book value of $17,500 when x=0 (“brand new” occurs at zero years). When
x=3, the car’s book value declined to $5500. This information is equivalent to giv-
ing two points (0, 17500) and (3, 5500) on the straight line representing book value.
(See Figure 1–20.)
We obtain the linear equation of the book value by ﬁnding the equation of a line
through these two points. The slope of the line is
m = y2 - y1

and the y-intercept is 17,500, so the equation is 
B=–4000x+17,500
The book value at the end of two years is 
B=–4000(2)+17,500=–8000+17,500=9500 
The negative value of the slope indicates a decrease in the book value of $4000 each
year. This annual decrease is the annual depreciation.
Generally, a company will estimate the number of years of useful life of an item.
The estimated value of the item at the end of its useful life is called its scrap value.
The values of x are restricted to 0  x  n, where n is the number of years of use-
ful life.
Here is a simple example.
Acme Manufacturing Co. purchases a piece of equipment for $28,300 and estimates
its useful life as eight years. At the end of its useful life, its scrap value is estimated
at $900.
(a) Find the linear equation expressing the relationship between book value and
time.
(b) Find the annual depreciation.
(c) Find the book value at the end of the ﬁrst, ﬁfth, and seventh years.
Solution
(a) The line passes through the two points (0, 28300) and (8, 900). Therefore, the
slope is
and the y-intercept is 28,300, giving the equation
B=–3425x+28,300

(b) The annual depreciation is obtained from the slope and is $3425.
(c) For year 1, B=–3425(1)+28,300=24,875. For year 5, B=–3425(5) +
28,300=11,175. For year 7, B=–3425(7)+28,300=4325. Thus, after
seven years the book value of the equipment is $4325.

Linear Trends
Many people like to ask “what if” questions such as:
If worldwide temperatures increase two degrees, how much coastal area will be
ﬂooded?
If I don’t do my homework for tomorrow, will we have a quiz?
If our quarterback can’t play, can we win?
A variation of this question ﬁnds people observing trends and making projections
such as:
Will the price of textbooks continue to increase, and by how much?
What will the job market be like when I graduate?
The per capita federal debt increased from $21,600 in 2002 to $25,200 in 2004. If
this trend continues, what will be my share of the federal debt in 2010?
Mathematical models can help analyze some trends and make projections based
on the trends. Linear functions sometimes describe a trend quite well and sometimes
describe a trend poorly.
The AIDS epidemic has devastated sub-Saharan Africa. In Botswana, AIDS has a
signiﬁcant impact on life expectancy. In 1998, life expectancy was 39.9 years; by 2001,
it dropped to 35.3 years. Based on these data, we can model the trend with a linear
function. Here’s how.
(a) Let x denote the number of years since 1998, so x=0 for 1998. Let y=life ex-
pectancy for people in Botswana. We can represent the given information with
two points (0, 39.9) and (3, 35.3). The slope of a line through these points is
Using the y-intercept, 39.9, the linear equation is
y=–1.53x+39.9
You might ask if this gives reasonable estimates for future years. For example,
this equation estimates life expectancy for 2004 (x=6) as
y=–1.53(6)+39.9=30.72
The actual life expectancy for 2004 was 31.0, so this estimate is quite reasonable.
(b) Use the equation to estimate life expectancy for 2010 (x=12):
y=–1.53(12)+39.9=21.54
m = 35.3 - 39.9
3 - 0
= -4.6

= -1.53

This seems to be a low life expectancy, but we won’t know how accurate it is until
later.
(c) Use the equation to estimate life expectancy for 2025. For 2025, x=27 and so
y=–1.53(27)+39.9=–1.4
A negative life expectancy is impossible. Thus, as we saw in part (a), the equa-
tion works well for estimating life expectancy in the near future. The equation
is less reliable as you move away from the years upon which it is based.
Studies indicate that the number of overweight people in the United States has in-
creased, posing many health concerns. In 1960, 43% of adults in the United States
were overweight; this increased to 55% by 1994.
(a) Find a linear equation that describes this trend.
(b) Use the equation to estimate the percentage of overweight people in 2000.
(c) Use the equation to estimate when the percentage reaches 100.
Solution
(a) We let x=number of years since 1960, so x=0 for 1960 and x=34 for 1994.
The variable y represents the percentage of the population that is overweight.
We then have the points (0, 43) and (34, 55). We ﬁnd the slope
Since the y-intercept is 43, the equation becomes
y=0.35x+43
(b) For 2000, x=40 and so
y=0.35(40)+43=57.0
This estimates that 57% of U.S. adults were overweight in 2000. The National
Center for Health Statistics found the percentage to be 65%. Thus, the equation
gave a poor estimate.
(c) The proportion of overweight adults reaches 100% when y=100.
So, in the year 1960+162.9=2122.9 (i.e., by the year 2123), all adults will be
overweight.
This example illustrates two limitations of describing trends with linear equa-
tions. First, a trend may not be linear, and assuming that it is may lead to erroneous
conclusions. The result in part (b) suggests that a linear equation does not ade-
quately estimate the trend.
Second, we shouldn’t use a linear equation to estimate far into the future. Even
though our equation computed a date when everyone would be overweight, we really
don’texpecteveryonetobeoverweightahundredyearsfromnow.Weshouldn’texpect

For some applications, an interval of values—instead of one speciﬁc value—
gives an appropriate answer to the problem. These situations can often be rep-
resented by inequalities. Here are two examples using linear inequalities. (See
Appendix A.4 for a review of the properties of linear inequalities.)
A doughnut shop sells doughnuts for $3.29 per dozen. The shop has ﬁxed weekly
costs of $650 and unit costs of $1.55 per dozen. How many dozens of doughnuts must
be sold weekly for the shop to make a proﬁt?
Solution
Let x=number of dozens of doughnuts sold per week. The revenue and cost func-
tions are
R(x)=3.29x
C(x)=1.55x+650
The shop makes a proﬁt when the revenue exceeds the costs—that is, when
R(x)>C(x). Therefore,we want to solve
Therefore, at least 374 dozen doughnuts must be sold in order to make a proﬁt. The

even point (1099.4444, 13853). When x represents a number of items, we would round it to 1099.
The Goal Seek procedure we have just used seeks the value of x that makes the value of D2, R(x)-C(x), equal to
the value placed in To value, namely zero. If you use the same procedure and enter 1000 in To value, Goal Seek will seek

In Chapter 1,you learned that a linear equation may represent or model a sit-
uation reasonably well.You also learned that an important business concept,
the break-even point, is determined from two equations, a cost function and
a revenue function. The intersection of the two lines determines the break-
even point.
Other,more complex situations may require two or more linear equations
to describe. As with the break-even problem, the goal is to ﬁnd a point com-
mon to all equations, their intersection. We illustrate with a simple example.
The Bluebonnet Campﬁre Kids sold cookies and candy to raise money for
summer camp.They sold a total of 325 boxes of candy and cookies.The candy
sold for $4 per box,and the cookies sold for $3 per box.They made a proﬁt of
$2.10 for each box of candy and $1.80 for each box of cookies.Their sales to-
taled $1165, with a proﬁt of $642.This information can be represented math-
ematically in the following way. Let x=the number of boxes of candy sold
and let y=the number of boxes of cookies sold.Then, x+y=325 repre-
sents the total number of boxes sold. Because each box of candy sells for $4
and each box of cookies sells for $3, 4x+3y=1165 represents total sales.
The proﬁt from sales is
2.10x+1.80y=642
To answer the question of the number of boxes of candy and the number
of boxes of cookies sold,we want the solution to the system
2.10x+1.80y=1325
2.14x+1.83y=1165
2.10x+1.80y=1642
To ﬁnd a solution to the system, we want to ﬁnd a value of x and a value of y
that makes all three equations true. We can easily ﬁnd a solution to the ﬁrst
equation,such as x=100 and y=225,but these values make neither of the 

66
Chapter 2
Linear Systems
last two equations true. The values x=265 and y=35 make the second
equation true but not the other two.Thus, the point (265, 35) lies on the sec-
ond line but not on the other two.We have not found the solution of the sys-
tem until we ﬁnd a point common to all three lines,their point of intersection.
We do not solve this system here. The purpose of this chapter is to demon-
strate some methods of ﬁnding a solution to a system of equations;then you
will be able to solve this system.Some of the methods used can be applied to
systems with a large number of variables and equations.

Applications
We call the equations used in the introduction a system of equations. A pair of num-
bers, one a value of x and the other a value of y, that makes all equations true is
called a solution of the system of equations.
We now look at some methods used to ﬁnd the solution to a system of equations.
Solution by Graphing
We use the following simple system to illustrate the geometric meaning of solving a
system of linear equations.
Solve the system
2x- y=3
x+2y=4
Solution
Geometrically, each of these equations represents a line.
When the lines are graphed with the same coordinate
axes, they intersect at the point (2, 1). (Figure 2–1) The
values x=2 and y=1 satisfy both equations (check to
be sure). Thus, they form a solution to the system.
■
We can estimate the solution to a system by graphing the lines and noting the inter-
section of the lines. However, the graph must be accurate, and even so the precision
of the solution may be in doubt.
Example 1
Note
Remember that the
pair of numbers x=2
and y=1 forms one
solution.
FIGURE 2–1
2x-y=3 and
x+2y=4 intersect
at the point (2, 1).
The solution: 
(2, 1)
x
y
2x – y = 3
x + 2y = 4

The precision of a graphical solution depends on the accuracy of the graph.
Generally, a pencil-and-paper graph may lack the desired precision. A graphing cal-
culator with a zoom feature can often yield quite an accurate solution. Algebraic
techniques can be used to obtain precise solutions. One algebraic method is the sub-
stitution method.
Substitution Method
To solve a system of two linear equations in two variables by the substitution
method:
1.
Solve for a variable in one of the equations (say x in terms of y).
2.
Substitute for x in the other equation.
3.
You now have an equation in one variable (say y). Solve for that variable.
4.
Substitute the value of the variable (y) just obtained into the ﬁrst equation and
solve for the other variable (x).
Solve the system
2x- y=3
x+2y=4
by substitution.
Solution
In this case, it is easy to solve for x in the second equation because its coefﬁcient is 1.
We obtain
x=4-2y
Substitute this expression for x in the ﬁrst equation, 2x-y=3:
2(4-2y)-y=3+5y
8-4y-y=3+5y
8-5y=3+5y
8=3+5y
5=5y+5
y=1+5y
Now substitute 1 for y in x=4-2y to obtain x=4-2=2. You could also
substitute in 2x-y=3. Thus, the solution to the system is (2, 1). You may also solve
for y in the ﬁrst equation and substitute it in the second equation. This will yield the
same solution. (Try it.) To be sure you have made no error, you should check your so-
lution in both equations. Figure 2–1 shows the graph of the solution.

The Substitution

Chapter 2
Linear Systems
Solve the system
5x-3y=18
4x+2y=10
Solution
In this case, it is a little easier to solve for y in the second equation.
2y=10-4x
y= 5-2x
Substitute the expression for y in the ﬁrst equation:
5x-3(5-2x)=18
5x-15+6x=18
11x=33
11x= 3
Now substitute x=3 into one of the equations. We use y=5-2x.
y=5-2(3)=–1
The pair x=3, y=–1 gives the solution to the system. Check it in both equations.
Figure 2–2 shows the graph of the solution.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 13,pg.77 ■
The methods of graphing and substitution to solve systems of equations have limited
usefulness. They may work quite well for systems with two variables, but they do not
extend well to systems with more than two variables. We now introduce a method
that can be extended to systems with a larger number of variables.
Elimination Method
The elimination method ﬁnds the solution by systematically modifying the system to
simpler systems. It does so in a manner that algebraically modiﬁes the system without
disturbing the solution. The goal is to modify the system until one of the equations
containsjustoneunknown.Thesimplersystemsoobtainediscalledanequivalentsys-
tem because it has exactly the same solution as the original system. The elimination
method is especially useful because it can be used with systems with several variables
and equations. The elimination method produces a series of systems of equations by
eliminating a variable from an equation or equations, to obtain a simpler system. As
you study the examples, observe that the operations used to transform the system
(eliminate a variable) into a simpler yet equivalent system are the following:
To transform one system of linear equations into an equivalent linear system, use
one or more of the following:
1.
Interchange two equations.
2.
Multiply or divide one or more equations by a nonzero constant.
3.
Multiply one equation by a constant and add the result to or subtract it from
another equation.
The procedure of converting a linear system to an equivalent linear system will be
usedagainlaterinthischapterandinChapter4,sobesureyouunderstandtheprocess.

We illustrate this method with the system
3x- y=3
x+2y=8
The arithmetic is a little easier if we eliminate a variable that has 1 as a coefﬁcient.
It is usually more convenient to use the ﬁrst equation to eliminate x, so we inter-
change the two equations to get
x+2y=8
3x- y=3
Now eliminate x from the second equation as follows:
(multiply the ﬁrst equation by –3 because it gives –3x, the
negative of the x-term in the second equation)
(now add it to the second equation)
(the new second equation)
Since the new equation came from equations in the system, it is true whenever the
system is true. It replaces the equation 3x-y=3 to give the system
x+2y=
8
–7y=–21
Notice that the second equation has been modiﬁed so that the variable x has been
eliminated from it. Simplify the second equation further by dividing by –7:
x+2y=8
y=3
This system has the same solution as the original system, but it has the advantage of
giving the value of y at the common solution, namely, 3. Now substitute 3 for y in the
ﬁrst equation to obtain
x+2(3)=8
(Actually, you can substitute y into either of the original equations.) This simpliﬁes
to x=2, so the solution to the system is (2, 3).
When a system has no coefﬁcient equal to 1, you can still solve such a system by
elimination, as illustrated in the next example.
Solve this system by elimination:
2x-3y=–19
5x+7y= 25
Solution
We want to eliminate x from the second equation and ﬁnd the value of y for the com-
mon solution. We modify the system of equations as follows:
–10x+15y= 95
(multiply the ﬁrst equation by –5)
10x+14y= 50
(multiply the second equation by 2)
29y=145
(now add)
y=

(divide by 29 to ﬁnd y)

y=

Now substitute this value of y into one of the equations. We use the ﬁrst to obtain
2x-3(5)=–19
2x= –4
x= –2
The solution to the original system is (–2, 5). Figure 2–3 shows the graph of the
solution.

Observe that the elimination method follows this general procedure.
To solve a system of two linear equations in two unknowns by the elimination
method:
1.
Multiply one or both equations by appropriate constants so that a variable in
one equation has a coefﬁcient c and the same variable in the other equation
has a coefﬁcient –c.
2.
Add the equations to eliminate this variable.
3.
The resulting equation replaces one of the two equations.
Applications
Before mathematics can be used to solve an application, the information given must
be converted to a mathematical form. Depending on the application, one of many
forms may be appropriate. For our purposes in this chapter, we look at some applica-
tions that can be represented with a system of equations and solved by elimination.
A woman must control her diet. She selects milk and bagels for breakfast. How much
of each should she serve in order to consume 700 calories and 28 grams of protein?
Each cup of milk contains 170 calories and 8 grams of protein. Each bagel contains
138 calories and 4 grams of protein.
Example 5
Note
Each of the original
equations was multi-
plied by a number so
that the resulting
equations have the
same coefﬁcients of x,
except for the sign.
Then it was easy to
eliminate x from the
second equation by
adding.
It is a good prac-
tice to check your solu-
tions because errors in
arithmetic sometimes
occur.To check,substi-
tute your solution into
all equations in the
original system.If your
solution fails to satisfy
one or more of the
equations,an error has
occurred.

Solution
Let m be the number of cups of milk and b the number of bagels. Then the total num-
ber of calories is
170m+138b
and the total protein is
8m+4b
So, we need to solve the system

Divide the top equation by 4 and the bottom equation by 2 to simplify somewhat:

85m+69b=350
Next, multiply the top equation by –69 and add it to the bottom equation in order
to eliminate b from the second equation:
(rounded)
Now substitute and solve for b:
2(2.509)+b=7
5.018+b=7
b=1.982
It is reasonable to round these answers to 2.5 cups of milk and 2 bagels.

A health food company has two nutritional drinks prepared. One contains 6.25
grams of carbohydrates per ounce, and the second contains 5.125 grams of carbo-
hydrate per ounce. A customer wants 400 ounces of a nutritional drink containing
5.625 grams of carbohydrate per ounce. The company dietitian will mix the two
drinks on hand to provide the requested drink. How much of each should be used?
Solution
Let x=number of ounces of the ﬁrst drink and let y=number of ounces of the
second drink. Then,
x+y=400
(number of ounces of the mixture)
6.25x=grams of carbohydrate from the ﬁrst drink
5.125y=grams of carbohydrate from the second drink
5.625(400)=2250=grams of carbohydrate in the mixture
We summarize this information with the system
 6.25x + 5.125y = 2250
 
x +
y =
400
Example 6
 m = 133
53 = 2.509

= -133
 
85m + 69b =

 -138m - 69b = -483

72
Chapter 2
Linear Systems
We can use the substitution method to solve the system. Substitute x=400-y
into the second equation:
6.25(400-y)+5.125y=2250
2500-6.25y+5.125y=2250
–1.125y=–250
1.125y=250
y=222.22
Rounded to the nearest ounce, the dietitian uses 222 ounces of the second drink and
400-222=178 ounces of the ﬁrst drink.

Inconsistent Systems
Each system in the preceding examples has exactly one solution. Do not expect this
always to be the case. If the equations represent two parallel lines, they have no
points in common, and a solution to the system does not exist. We say that this is an
inconsistent system. Figure 2– 4 shows the graph of the two lines
–2x+ y=3
–4x+2y=2
Each line has slope 2, and they do not intersect, so no solution exists for the system.
Notice that the equations in this system have the slope-intercept forms
y=2x+3
and
y=2x+1
In an inconsistent system of two equations, the lines have the same slope but differ-
ent y-intercepts.
The equations of two parallel lines give a system of equations. Let’s see what hap-
pens when we try to solve such a system:
3x-2y= 5
6x-4y=–6
We can eliminate x from an equation by multiplying the ﬁrst equation by –2 and
adding the two equations:
The process of solving the system leads to an inconsistency, 0=–16, so the system
has no solution. You may expect such an inconsistency when attempting to solve a
system that represents two different parallel lines.

you will ﬁnd that the graphs coincide, so they represent the same line. When you put
both equations in the slope-intercept form, you ﬁnd that both have slopes 
and 
y-intercept 
so the lines and their graphs are identical. Because the lines coincide,
every point on this line is a solution to the given system (see Figure 2–5). Let’s look
at an example that illustrates what happens when we try to solve such a system.
Solve the system
12x+9y=24
8x+6y=16
First, eliminate x from an equation:
(multiply the ﬁrst equation by 2)
(multiply the second equation by –3)
(add the equations)
This transforms the system into
12x+9y=24
0 = 0
Any solution to the equation 12x+9y=24 is a solution to the system. Since an
inﬁnite number of points lie on this line, the system has an inﬁnite number of solu-
tions that may be represented as
where x may be any number. For example, when x=1, 5, and –2, we have the
solutions
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 31,pg.77 ■
In this example, the variable y can be expressed in terms of x. When this occurs, we
call x a parameter. In practice, we often use another letter—say, k—to represent an
arbitrary value of x. We obtain the corresponding value of y when x=k (k=any
real number) is substituted into the equation. When doing so, we can express the
inﬁnity of solutions as
We call this the parametric form of the solution, which we can also write as

demand (the amount consumers buy). They also know that there may be more than
one relationship between price and demand, depending on circumstances. In times
of shortages, a different psychology takes effect, and prices tend to increase when de-
mand increases.
In the competitive situation, a decrease in price can cause an increase in demand
(when a store has a sale). This suggests that demand is a function of price. On other oc-
casions, a store may lower prices because an item is in great demand and it expects to
increase proﬁts by a greater volume. This suggests that price is a function of demand.
Because the cause and effect relationship between price and demand can go either
way—a change in price causes a change in demand or a change in demand can cause a
change in price—we need to decide how to write the demand equation. The analysis is
easier if we write the demand equation (and the supply equation in the next paragraph)
so that the price is a function of demand (or supply).
The Bike Shop held an annual sale. The consumer price and demand relationship for
the Ten-Speed Special was
p=–2x+179
where x is the number of bikes in demand at the price p. The negative slope, –2,
indicates that when an increase occurs in one of the variables, price or demand, a
decrease occurs in the other. This relationship between price and demand is a linear
function. Its graph illustrates the decrease in price with an increase in demand (see
Figure 2–6). When demand increases from 10 to 40, prices drop from $159 to $99.
The Bike Shop cannot lower prices indeﬁnitely because the supplier wants to
make a proﬁt also. In a competitive situation, a price increase gives the supplier in-
centive to produce more. When prices fall, the supplier tends to produce less. The
quantity produced by the supplier is called supply. Suppose Bike Manufacturing
produces the Ten-Speed Special, and the relationship between supply and price is
given by the linear function
p=1.5x+53

The graph of this equation illustrates that an increase in price leads to a higher sup-
ply (see Figure 2–7). When the price increases from $83 to $128, the supply in-
creases from 20 to 50 units.
Supply and demand are two sides of a perfect competitive market. They interact
to determine the price of a commodity. The price of a commodity settles down in the
market to one at which the amount willingly supplied and the amount willingly de-
manded are equal. This price is called the equilibrium price. The equilibrium price
may be determined by solving a system of equations. In our example, the system is
p=–2x+179
p=1.5x+53
Solve the system to obtain the equilibrium solution by either the substitution
method or the elimination method. The solution is x=36 and p=107. (Be sure
you can ﬁnd this solution.) The equilibrium price is $107 when the supply and de-
mand are 36 bikes (see Figure 2–8).
Figure 2–8 also helps us see when there is a surplus or shortage of bikes. For ex-
ample, draw a horizontal line at p=150. Notice that it intersects the demand equa-
tion at about x=15 and it intersects the supply equation at about x=65. Thus,
when the price is $150, there is a demand for 15 bikes, but there are 65 supplied, so

a surplus exists. Similarly, when p=75, the demand is about 50, and the supply is
about 10, so a shortage exists.
Observe that the p-intercept for the demand equation is $179. This indicates that
the price must be less than $179 if the shop expects to sell any bikes. Similarly, the 
p-intercept for the supply equation is 53, so the price must be more than $53 for 
the supplier to manufacture bikes.

The tuition–fee cost of courses at Mountainview Community College is determined
by a general fee of $250 and tuition of $38 per semester hour and can be represented
by a linear equation in two variables:
y=38x+250
where x is the number of semester hours and y is the total tuition–fee cost.
At Valley Junior College, the tuition–fee cost is determined by a general fee of
$225, a building use fee of $25 per course, and tuition of $41 per semester hour. The
tuition–fee cost can be represented by a linear equation
y=41h+25x+225
where h is the number of semester hours, x is the number of courses, and y is the to-
tal tuition–fee cost.
In the ﬁrst case, the tuition–fee cost can be represented with a linear equation
with two variables. For Valley Junior College, the tuition–fee function is also linear,
but it requires the use of three variables.
This illustrates that, as in Section 2.1, many applications can be modeled using a
linear equation with two variables, but some linear models require more than two
variables.
Elimination Method
Some applications require the solution of two or more linear equations in three vari-
ables (or more), so we will use some examples with “nice” numbers to illustrate the
procedure for solving such a system.
Cutter’s mother opened Amy’s Online Store so he could purchase some books from
the Bargain Baskets for his cousin Andrew’s birthday. He was allowed to select from
the $1 basket, the $2 basket, and the $3 basket. Based on the following information,
determine how many books Cutter selected from each basket:
(a) He selected ﬁve books at a total cost of $10.
(b) Shipping costs were $2.00 for each $1 book and $1.00 for each $2 and $3 book.
(c) The total shipping cost was $6.00
Solution
Let’s state this information in mathematical form and determine the number of
books chosen from each table. Let
x=number of books from the $1 basket
y=number of books from the $2 basket
z=number of books from the $3 basket
Example 1

2.2
Systems with Three Variables:An Introduction to a Matrix Representation of a Linear System of Equations
83
The given information may be written as follows:
x+ y+ z= 5
(total number of books)
x+2y+3z=10
(total cost of books)
2x+ y+ z= 6
(total shipping costs)
The solution to this system of three equations in three variables gives the number of
books chosen from each basket. Before we solve this system, let’s look at some basic
ideas.
A set of values for x, y, z that satisﬁes all three equations is called a solution to
the system. Be sure you understand that a solution consists of three numbers, one
each for x, y, and z.
You know that a linear equation in two variables represents a line in two-
dimensional space. However, a linear equation in three variables does not represent a
line, it represents a plane in three-dimensional space. A solution to a system of three
equations in three variables corresponds to a point that lies in all three planes.
Figure 2–9 illustrates some possible ways in which the planes might intersect. If the
three planes have just one point in common, the solution will be unique. If the planes
have no points in common, there will be no solution to the system. If the planes have
many points in common, the system will have many solutions.
Notice that two planes can have points in common, such as plane A and B in
Figure 2–9(c) and (d), but if those points do not also lie in plane C, then they do not
represent a solution.
We need not stop with a system of three variables. Applications exist that re-
quire larger systems with more variables. Larger systems are more difﬁcult to inter-
pret geometrically and are more tedious to solve, but they also can have a unique so-
lution, no solution, or many solutions.
The method of elimination used to solve systems of two equations can be
adapted to larger systems. We now solve the system in Example 1. First, we make a
change in notation. Replace the variables x, y, and z with x1, x2, and x3. We do this
to emphasize that we can run out of letters when more variables are needed. (Some
applications use dozens of variables.) The use of x1, x2, x3, x4, p for variables is an-
other way to identify different variables, and it has the advantage of providing a no-
tation for any number of variables. So, here is the system of Example 1 using x1, x2,
and x3:
x1+ x2+ x3= 5
x1+2x2+3x3=10
2x1+ x2+ x3= 6
Now let’s proceed with the solution. First, eliminate x1 from the second equation
by subtracting the ﬁrst equation from the second equation to obtain a new second
equation:
(Equation 2)
(Equation 1)
(this will replace the second equation in the system)
As we work through the example, notice that we usually multiply one equation
by a constant before adding it to another. The choice of the multiple is determined
by the coefﬁcients of the variable we want to eliminate.
 x2 + 2x3 =
5
 x1 +  x2 +  x3 =  5

Now eliminate x1 from the third equation by multiplying the ﬁrst equation by –2
and adding it to the third:
(Equation 3)
(–2*Equation 1)
(this will replace the third equation in the system)
This gives the new and simpler equivalent system
x1+x2+ x3= 5
x2+2x3= 5
–x2- x3=–4
Observe that the variable x1 has been eliminated from both the second and third
equations. This system of three equations becomes the current system from which
we eliminate another variable.
To describe the operations performed in a concise manner, we will use the nota-
tion Eq. 2-Eq. 1 to mean the ﬁrst equation is subtracted from the second.
–2(Eq. 1)+Eq. 3 means to multiply the ﬁrst equation by –2 and add it to the third.
We continue the process by eliminating more variables from the new system.
Now we can eliminate the variable x2 from the ﬁrst and third equations of the
current system by using the second equation:
The system on the right is equivalent to the original system and is now the cur-
rent system. We can complete the solution by eliminating x3 from the ﬁrst and sec-
ond equations of this latest system:
The solution to this system and, thus, the solution to the original system is
x1=1, x2=3, x3=1, which is also written (1, 3, 1). This solution tells us that
Cutter chose 1 book from the $1 basket, 3 books from the $2 basket, and 1 book from
the $3 basket. (Check the solution in the original system.)

efﬁcient of x1 that was

Matrices
The method of elimination may be used to solve larger systems, but it is tedious, with
errors easily made. To make the elimination method more efﬁcient, we convert it to
an equivalent procedure that can still be tedious, but less so. The good news is that
it can be used to obtain computer solutions of a system. We will learn the Gauss-
Jordan Method, which uses matrices, a notation that keeps track of the variables in
the system but does not write them.
When you worked some solution by elimination exercises, you likely noticed
that the coefﬁcients of the variables determined the multipliers used in the opera-
tions. Thus, some labor can be saved if we can avoid writing the variables and con-
centrate on the coefﬁcients. The matrix notation allows that.
Before we show you the Gauss-Jordan Method, we introduce you to matrices.
The formal deﬁnition of a matrix is the following:
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. The numbers in the array are called the
elements of the matrix. The array is enclosed with brackets.
An array composed of a single row of numbers is called a row matrix.
An array composed of a single column of numbers is called a column matrix.
Some examples of matrices are
The location of each element in a matrix is described by the row and column in
which it lies. Count the rows from the top of the matrix and the columns from the
left.
Col. 1
Col. 2
Col. 3
Col. 4
The element 9 is in row 2 and column 3 of the matrix. We call this location the
(2, 3) location; the row is indicated ﬁrst and the column second. A standard notation
for the number in that location is a23 (read as “a sub two-three”), so a23=9. The
element 7, designated a31=7, is in the (3, 1) location; and –3, designated a13=–3,
is in the (1, 3) location.

Let’s pause to point out that you encounter matrices more often than you might real-
ize. When you go to a fast-food restaurant, the cashier may record your order on a de-
vice that resembles Figure 2–10. When you order three Big Burgers, the cashier
presses the Big Burger location, the (1, 2) location, to record the number ordered.
Your completed order forms a matrix, with some entries zero, which the computer
uses to compute your bill. Both the cashier and the company computer understand
that a number in a location counts the number of the item represented by the location.

Linear Systems
The rows and columns of a matrix often represent categories. A grade book
shows a rectangular array of numbers. Each column represents a test, and each row
represents a student.
Matrices and Systems of Equations
Let’s use the following system to see how matrices relate to systems of equations.
We form one matrix by using only the coefﬁcients of the system. This gives the
coefﬁcient matrix:
Column 1 lists the coefﬁcients of x1, column 2 lists the coefﬁcients of x2, and column
3 lists the coefﬁcients of x3. Notice that the entries in each column are listed in the
order ﬁrst, second, and third equations, so the ﬁrst row represents the left-hand side
of the ﬁrst equation, and so on.
A matrix that also includes the numbers on the right-hand side of the equation
is called the augmented matrix of the system:
The augmented matrix gives complete information, in a compact form, about
a system of equations, provided that we agree that each row represents an equa-
tion and each column, except the last, consists of the coefﬁcients of a variable.
Generally, we place a vertical line between the coefﬁcients and the column of
constant terms. This gives a visual reminder of the location of the equal sign in the
equations.

Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 19,pg.99 ■
We can solve a system of linear equations by using its augmented matrix. Since each
row in the matrix represents an equation, we perform the same kinds of operations
on rows of the matrix as we do on the equations in the system. These row operations
are as follows:
1.
Interchange two rows.
2.
Multiply or divide a row by a nonzero constant.
3.
Multiply a row by a constant and add it to or subtract it from another row.
Two augmented matrices are equivalent if one is obtained from the other by 
using row operations.
These row operations are the same kind of operations that we used on the equa-
tions in Section 2.1 to convert a system of equations to an equivalent system.
Gauss-Jordan Method
To illustrate the matrix technique, we solve a system of linear equations using the
augmented matrix and row operations. This technique is basically a simpliﬁcation of
the elimination method. You will soon ﬁnd that even this “simpliﬁed” method can be
tedious and subject to arithmetic errors. However, a method such as this is widely
used on computers to solve systems of equations. Whereas the examples and exer-
cises use equations that yield relatively simple answers, actual applications don’t al-
ways have nice, neat, unique solutions.
We cannot give you a manual method for solving systems of equations that is
quick, simple, and foolproof. We want you to understand and apply systems of equa-
tions. When a “messy” system needs to be solved, you need to be aware that solu-
tions are available using computers or a TI graphing calculator.

This technique of using row operations to reduce an augmented matrix to a simple
matrix is called the Gauss-Jordan Method. The form of the ﬁnal matrix is such that
the solution to the original system can easily be read from the matrix. Notice that the
ﬁnal matrix in the example preceding was
For the moment, ignore the last column of the matrix. The remaining columns have
zeros everywhere except in the (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3) locations. These are called
the diagonal locations. The Gauss-Jordan Method attempts to reduce the aug-
mented matrix until there are 1’s in the diagonal locations and 0’s elsewhere (except
in the last column). This procedure of obtaining a 1 in one position of a column and
making all other entries in that column equal to 0 is called pivoting.
When a matrix is reduced to this diagonal form, each row easily shows the value
of a variable in the solution. In the matrix above, the rows represent
x1=1
x2=3
x3=1
which gives the solution.
We now look at another example and focus attention on the procedure for ar-
riving at this desired diagonal form. In this section, we focus our attention on aug-
mented matrices that can be reduced to this diagonal form. The cases in which the
diagonal form is not possible are studied in the next section.
We introduce a new notation in the next example to reduce the writing involved.
When we are reducing a matrix and you see
R1
gives
[1
2
–3
11] S R1
this means that row 1 of the current matrix is divided by 4 and gives the new 
row [1
2
–3
11], which is placed in row 1 of the next matrix. The notation
–2R2+R3 S R3 means that row 2 of the current matrix is multiplied by –2 and
added to row 3. The result becomes row 3 of the next matrix.
Solve the following system by reducing the augmented matrix to the diagonal form.
2x1-4x2+6x3= 20
3x1-6x2+ x3= 22

From the last row of this matrix, we have
–8x3=–8
or
x3=1
From the second row, we have
x2+4x3=2
Since x3=1, we have
x2+4= 2
x1 x2=–2
From the ﬁrst row, we have
x1-2x2+3x3=10
Substituting x2=–2 and x3=1, we have
x1+4+3=10
x1+4+x1= 3
Thus, the solution is (3, –2, 1).
Generally, you can reduce the matrix to a form with zeros below the diagonal
and then work from the bottom row up substituting the values of the variables.

is a contradiction. Thus, the system has no solution.
Application
The Midway High School band sold citrus fruit for a fund-raiser. They sold grape-
fruit for $16 per box, oranges for $13 per box, and a grapefruit–orange combination
for $15 per box. Rhonda, a French horn player, was pleased with her sales. “I sold 57
boxes, and here is the money, $845.” The band director insisted he needed to know
the number of boxes of each kind of fruit to process the order. “I don’t remember the
number of each, but I did notice that if we increased the price of a box of grapefruit
by $2 and the price of a box of oranges by $1, I would have an even $900.”
“That’s odd information to notice, but perhaps we can use it to determine the
number of each box.”
Help Rhonda and the band director determine the number of boxes of each kind
of fruit sold.
Solution
Let x1=number of boxes of grapefruit
x2=number of boxes of oranges
x3=number of boxes of grapefruit–orange
We can state the given information as follows:
x¡+
x™+
x£= 57
(number of boxes sold)
16x¡+13x™+15x£=845
(amount Rhonda received)
18x¡+14x™+15x£=900
(amount if prices were increased)
The solution to this system gives the desired number of boxes for each kind of
fruit. Find the solution by using augmented matrices. The following sequence of ma-
trix reductions leads to the solution:

x1+4x2-3x3=–29
We enter the augmented matrix on the worksheet in cells A2:D4.
We will use row operations to obtain a sequence of matrices that eventually give the solution to the system.
First Pivot
Obtain the ﬁrst matrix by pivoting on the (1, 1) entry, 2. We place the matrix obtained by this pivot in cells A7:D9. The
ﬁrst step of the pivot divides the ﬁrst row by 2 to get a 1 in the (1, 1) position, then we use row operations to get zeros in
the rest of the ﬁrst column.
To obtain a 1 in the (1, 1) position, enter =A2/2 in cell A7 (then press the return key). Then copy A7 in cells 
B7 through D7 by selecting A7 and placing the cursor on the little square at the lower right corner of A7. See the next
ﬁgure.
Drag across to D7. The next ﬁgure shows that this creates the formulas =B2/2, =C2/2, and =D2/2 in B7 through D7.
Here we see the results of these formulas.
Place cursor here

Chapter 2
Linear Systems
To complete the pivot, now use the following row operations:
In cell A8 enter: =-6*A7+A3 and copy it in cells B8 through D8.
In cell A9 enter: =-1*A7+A4 and copy it in cells B9 through D9.
The ﬁgure below shows the matrix in A7:D9.
Second Pivot
We pivot on the (2, 2) entry, 10, in the matrix in A7:D9 to obtain the next matrix, which we place in A12:D14. 
Observe that the row operations will operate on rows in the matrix A7:D9 and place the results in the matrix located in
A12:D14.
Pivot on the (2, 2) entry with the following formulas (Note: I usually enter the pivot row formula ﬁrst, row A13 
here):

Copy each formula across the row to the D column. The resulting matrix is shown in A12:D14 in the ﬁgure below.
Third Pivot
Pivot on the (3, 3) entry in the A12:D14 matrix and place the result in A17:D19 using the formulas:
In A19: =A14/-4.6
In A17: =-.8*A19+A12
In A18: =-.2*A19+A13
The resulting matrix is the last matrix shown in the sequence of matrices in the following ﬁgure, which gives the so-
lution x1=3, x2=–5, x3=4.
The preceding process can be used in general after we observe the way the row operations are constructed. Let’s look
at the row operations used to pivot on the (2, 2) entry.
First, we point out that the pivot was made on the matrix in A7:D9 (let’s call it the Current Matrix). The matrix 
formed by pivoting (let’s call it the Next Matrix) was located in A12:D14. The following ﬁgure identiﬁes the row opera-
tions in terms of the Current Matrix and the Next Matrix. Study the ﬁgure and then describe the row operations used to
pivot on the (1, 1) and the (3, 3) entries in terms of Current Matrix and Next Matrix. Then work the exercises using row
operations.

Systems with No Solution
In this section, we expand on the Gauss-Jordan Method presented in Section 2.2. In
that section, the systems had the same number of equations as variables, dealt
mainly with three variables, and had a unique solution. In general, a system may
have many variables, it may have more, or fewer, equations than variables, and it
may have many solutions or no solution at all. In any case, the Gauss-Jordan Method
can be used to solve the system by starting with an augmented matrix as before.
Using a sequence of row operations eventually gives a simpler form of the matrix,
which yields the solutions. In Section 2.2, the simpliﬁed matrices reduced to a diag-
onal form that gave a unique solution. Some augmented matrices will not reduce
to˙a diagonal form, but they can always be reduced to another standard form called
the reduced echelon form.
Row 2 of the Current Matrix is the pivot row. Column 2 of the Current Matrix is the pivot column.

Chapter 2
Linear Systems
Reduced Echelon Form
We give the general deﬁnition of a reduced echelon form. The diagonal forms of the
preceding section also conform to this deﬁnition.
A matrix is in reduced echelon form if all the following are true:
1.
All rows consisting entirely of zeros are grouped at the bottom of the matrix.
2.
The leftmost nonzero number in each row is 1. This element is called the leading 1 of
the row.
3.
The leading 1 of a row is to the right of the leading 1 of the rows above.
4.
All entries above and below a leading 1 are zeros.
The following matrices are all in reduced echelon form. Check the conditions in
the deﬁnition to make sure you understand why.
The following matrices are not in reduced echelon form.
The row of zeros is not at the bottom
The leftmost nonzero entry in row 3
of the matrix.
(4) is not 1.
The leading 1 in row 4 is not to the
The entry in row 2 above the leading
right of the leading 1 in row 3.
1 in row 3 is not zero.
We now work through the details of modifying a matrix until we obtain the re-
duced echelon form. As we work through it, notice how we use row operations to ob-
tain the leading 1 in row 1, row 2, and so on, and then get zeros in the rest of a col-
umn with a leading 1.
We use the same row operations that are used in reducing an augmented matrix
to obtain a solution to a linear system. Generally, we want to obtain a reduced ma-
trix with 1’s on the diagonal.

2.3
Gauss-Jordan Method for General Systems of Equations
111
Solution
We start with the augmented matrix and convert it to reduced echelon form:
This matrix is the reduced echelon form of the augmented matrix. It represents the
system of equations
x1
+28x3=60
x2+11x3=25
When the reduced echelon form gives equations containing more than one variable,
such as x1+28x3=60, the system has many solutions. Many sets of x1, x2, and x3
satisfy these equations. Usually, we solve the ﬁrst equation for x1 and the second for
x2 to get
x1=60-28x3
x2=25-11x3
This represents the general solution with x1 and x2 expressed in terms of x3. When
some variables are expressed in terms of another variable, x3 in this case, we call
x3 a parameter. We ﬁnd speciﬁc solutions to the system by substituting values
for x3. For example, one speciﬁc solution is found by assigning x3=1. Then
x1=60-28=32, and x2=25-11=14. In general, we assign the arbitrary
value k to x3 and solve for x1 and x2. The arbitrary solution can then be expressed as
x1=60-28k, x2=25-11k, and x3=k. As k ranges over the real numbers, we
get all solutions. In such a case, k is called a parameter. For example, when k=2, we
get x1=4, x2=3, and x3=2. When k=–1, we get the solution x1=88, x2=36,
and x3=–1. In summary, the solutions to this example may be written in two ways:
x1=60-28x3+
x2=25-11x3
or
x1=60-28k
x2=25-11k
x3=k+ +
The latter is sometimes written as (60-28k, 25-11k, k).

Linear Systems
The reduction of an augmented matrix can be tedious. However, this method re-
duces the solution of a system of equations to a routine. This routine can be car-
ried out by a computer or a graphing calculator. When dozens of variables are in-
volved, a computer is the only practical way to solve such a system. We want you
to be able to perform this routine, so we have two more examples to help you.
Solve the system by reducing the augmented matrix.
x1+3x2-5x3+2x4
=–10
–2x1+ x2+3x3-4x4+7x5=–22
3x1-7x2-3x3-2x4+4x5=–18
We write the augmented matrix and start the process of reducing to echelon
form:
Simplify rows 2 and 3:
We now have the reduced echelon form of the augmented matrix. This matrix rep-
resents the system:
x1
+6x4-13x5=50
x2
+2x4- 4x5=15
x3+2x4- 5x5=21
Solving for x1, x2, and x3 in terms of x4 and x5, we get
x1=50-6x4+13x5
x2=15-2x4+ 4x5
x3=21-2x4+ 5x5
Here, x1, x2, and x3 are solved in terms of x4 and x5, so this solution has two param-
eters, x4 and x5. We can select arbitrary values for x4 and x5 and use them to obtain
values for x1, x2, and x3. We denote this by assigning the arbitrary value k to x4 and
m to x5. We use them to obtain solutions

which we can also write as (50-6k+13m, 15-2k+4m, 21-2k+5m, k, m).
Speciﬁc solutions are obtained when speciﬁc values for k and m are selected, such as
k=5, m=1, which yields the solution (33, 9, 16, 5, 1). Because we can choose any
real numbers for k and m, this system has an inﬁnite number of solutions.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 33,pg.121 ■
It is possible for a system to have no solution. We illustrate this in the following
example.
Systems with No Solution
The following system has no solution. Let’s see what happens when we try to solve it.
x1+3x2-2x3=5
4x1- x2+3x3=7
2x1-7x2+7x3=4
Solution
The last matrix is not yet in reduced echelon form. However, we need proceed no
further because the last row represents the equation 0=7. When we reach an in-
consistency like this, we know that the system has no solution.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 37,pg.121 ■
Usually, you cannot look at a system of equations and tell whether there is no solu-
tion, just one solution, or many solutions. When a system has fewer equations than
variables, we generally expect many solutions. Here is such an example.

Since x3 can be chosen arbitrarily, this system has many solutions. Letting x3=k,
the parametric form of this solution is
x1=7-k
x2=–5+k
x3=k
which may be written (7-k, –5+k, k).

You should not conclude from the preceding example that a system with fewer equa-
tions than variables will always yield many solutions. In some cases, the system con-
tains an inconsistency and therefore has no solution. Here is such an example.

Gauss-Jordan Method for General Systems of Equations
117
Solution
The augmented matrix of the system is
We now use row operations to reduce the matrix.
The last matrix is not quite in the reduced echelon form because the last column
has not been reduced to a 1 in the last row and zeros elsewhere. However, we need not
proceed any further because the matrix in the present form represents the system
x1
= 1
x2
= 3
x3
= 1
0=11
Because the system includes a false equation, 0=11, the system cannot be
satisﬁed by any values of x1, x2, and x3. Thus, we must conclude that the original sys-
tem has no solution.

Linear Systems
system reduces to fewer equations than variables, not enough rows in the matrix ex-
ist to give a row for each variable. This means that you can solve only for some of the
variables, and they will be expressed in terms of the remaining variables (parame-
ters). Examples 3, 4, and 6 illustrate the relationship between the number of vari-
ables solved in terms of parameters. Notice the following:
Example 3 reduces to two equations and three variables. Two of the variables, x1
and x2, were solved in terms of one variable, x3. We call x3 a parameter.
In Example 4, which reduces to three equations and ﬁve variables, three of the
variables, x1, x2, and x3, were solved in terms of two variables, x4 and x5. We
have two parameters in this case, x4 and x5.
In Example 6, which has two equations and three variables, two variables, x1
and x2, were solved in terms of one variable, x3. This solution has one pa-
rameter, x3.
The relationship between the number of equations and variables is as follows: If
there are k equations with n variables in the reduced echelon matrix, and n>k,
then k of the variables can be solved in terms of n-k parameters. The system has
many solutions.
Whenever a row in a reduced matrix becomes all zeros, then an equation is elim-
inated from the system, and the number of equations is reduced by one. In the re-
duced echelon matrix, count the nonzero rows to count the number of equations in
the solution.
Application
A brokerage ﬁrm packaged blocks of common stocks, bonds, and preferred stocks
into three different portfolios. The portfolios contained the following:
A customer wants to buy 135 blocks of common stock, 140 blocks of bonds, and 275
blocks of preferred stock. How many of each portfolio should be purchased to ac-
complish this?
Solution
Let x, y, and z represent (respectively) the number of portfolios I, II, and III used.
This information can be stated as a system of equations.
Common stock:
3x+3y+ 6z=135
Bonds:
2x+4y+10z=140
Preferred stock:
5x+7y+16z=275

Gauss-Jordan Method for General Systems of Equations

This matrix reduces to the following. (Show that it does.)
This represents the system
x-z=20
y+3z=25
which has an inﬁnite number of solutions of the form
x=20+z
y=25-3z
Common sense tells us that x, y, and z must be integers and cannot be negative, so
3z  25 or else y would be negative. Thus, z can be a number from 0 through 8.
To ﬁll the customer’s order, the brokerage ﬁrm can use the following numbers of
each portfolio.
Portfolio III: from 0 through 8
Portfolio II:
25 reduced by 3 times the number of III used
Portfolio I:
20 plus the number of III used
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 65,pg.122 ■
The nonzero rows of the reduced echelon matrix give the needed information
about the solutions to a system of equations. Three situations are possible.
1.
No solution.
At least one row has all zeros in the coefﬁcient portion of the
matrix (the portion to the left of the vertical line) and a nonzero entry to the
right of the vertical line.
(No solution)
Two more possibilities arise when a solution exists.
2.
The solution is unique.
The number of nonzero rows equals the number of
variables in the system.
(Unique solution)
3.
Inﬁnite number of solutions.
The number of nonzero rows is less than the
number of variables in the system.
(Inﬁnite number of solutions)
Notice that we solve for the variable in each row where a leading 1 occurs, and we
write that variable in terms of the other variables in that row.

Summary
Note
In the Gauss-Jordan
Method,we start by
obtaining a 1 in the 
(1,1) position of the
augmented matrix.
Actually,this is not
essential.We do not
need to conform
exactly to this
sequence,and we 
could begin with
another column 
or row.

Center and sold championship sweatshirts, T-shirts,
and caps. The sweatshirts sold for $22, the T-shirts
for $14,andthe caps for $8. The total number of these
items was 184,and if all were sold then the Student
Congresswould receive $2784. At the end of the ﬁrst
day, they were pleased to learn they had sold three
fourths of the sweatshirts, half of the T-shirts, and a
fourthof the caps for a total of 96 items. Determine
how many of each item they started with.

66. Professor Ratner taught a large calculus class of
124 students. To determine if SAT mathematics
scores predicted success in calculus, he kept records
by three groups of SAT scores: Group I, over 600;
Group II, 500 –600; and Group III, below 500.
After the ﬁrst exam, 14 students dropped the
course: 5% of Group I, 12.5% of Group II, and
25% of Group III. After the second exam, more
students dropped the course. The number of students
remaining was 99: being 90% of the original GroupI,
82.5% of the original Group II, and 50% of the
original Group III. Find the number in each group
at the beginning of the course.

Using Your TI-83/84
Obtaining the Reduced Echelon Form of a Matrix
The process of solving a system of equations by using row operations on the augmented matrix seeks to reduce the
columns to a single entry of 1 and 0’s in the rest of the column. The same process is used to obtain the reduced echelon
form of a matrix.
This process of modifying a matrix so a column contains a single entry with 1 and 0’s in the rest of the column is called
pivoting. A system of three equations can require up to nine row operations to solve the system. These row operations can
be accomplished by the TI-83/84 program called PIVOT, which can be used to pivot on speciﬁed entries of the matrix
stored in [A]. The pivot row and column determine where the pivot, the 1 entry, is located.

Using Excel
General Procedure for Pivoting
Using EXCEL in Section 2.2 showed how to pivot on a matrix entry. For different matrices, you need to change the for-
mulas in the template using the entries in the new matrix. In this section, we show a template for pivoting on the diagonal
entries of a 3*4 matrix. In this template, the original matrix is placed in cells A2:D4 and the sequence of matrices ob-
tained by pivoting are located in cells A7:D9, A12:D14, and A17:D19. As in Section 2.2, it sufﬁces to enter the formulas
in the A column. The rest of the formulas are obtained by dragging the A column formula across the row to column D.
For our example, we again use the matrix
Below, we show the formulas as entered in the A column of each matrix. The spreadsheet with the completed calcu-
lations is shown on the right.
Warning: This will work only on 3*4 matrices. If a pivot element is zero, this will not work.
Enter this template on your spreadsheet and use it to work some of the exercises. Notice that the formulas include
cell addresses like $A$2, $A$3, $B$8, and $C$14. Let’s explain the reason for this.
When you drag the formula in A7, =A2/$A$2, across to the D7 cell, the A2 address changes to B2, C2, and D2. The
$A$2 cell address does not change. This is correct, because you want every entry in the matrix row to be divided by the
pivot element in A2. All cell addresses in the template with a $ sign before the column and row number do not change
when the formula is dragged across to the D column.
Study the formulas here and then make a template to solve a system with four equations and four variables.

Additional Uses of Matrices
You have used augmented matrices to represent a system of linear equations (Sec-
tion 2.3) and then used row operations to solve the system of equations. This method
reduces the procedure to a more straightforward sequence of steps. The procedure
can also be performed on a computer that handles the computational drudgery and
reduces errors.
A casual observer might view an augmented matrix as simply a table of num-
bers. In one sense that is correct. The interpretation of the table and an understand-
ing of the row operations gives signiﬁcant meaning to “just a table of numbers.”
Matrices are mathematically interesting because they can be used to represent more
than a system of equations. Many applications in business, social, and biological sci-
ences represent information in tables or rectangular arrays of numbers. The analy-
ses of such data can often be done using matrices and matrix operations. We add,
multiply, and perform other operations with matrices. We will study these opera-
tions and suggest ways in which they are useful.
We begin with a simple application using a matrix to summarize information in
tabular forms. For example, a mathematics professor records grade information for
two sections of a mathematics course in the following matrix:
Section
1
2
Each row represents a different type of grade, and each column represents a section.
Because an endless variety of ways exist in which someone might want to break
information into categories and summarize it, matrices come in various shapes and
sizes. Independent of the source of the information summarized in a matrix, we can
classify matrices by the number of rows and columns they have. For example,
is a 2*3 matrix because it has two rows and three columns.
is a 4*3 matrix, having four rows and three columns. The convention used in de-
scribing the size of a matrix states the number of rows ﬁrst, followed by the number
of columns.

Two matrices are the same size if they have the same dimensions; that is, the
number of rows is the same for both matrices, and the number of columns is also the
same. For example,
are matrices of the same size; they are both 2*3 matrices.
Here is another example of using a matrix to summarize information.
The Campus Bookstore carries spirit shirts in white, green, and gold. In September
it sold 238 white, 317 green, and 176 gold shirts. In October it sold 149 white, 342
green, and 369 gold shirts. In November it sold 184 white, 164 green, and 201 gold
shirts. Summarize this information in a matrix.
Solution
Let each of three columns represent a month and each of three rows represent a
color of shirts. Label the columns and rows.

2 sold 7 giant sizes and 12 regular on day 1, and so on.
The total sales, by store and package size, can be obtained by adding the sales in
each individual category to get the total in that category—that is, by adding corre-
sponding entries of the two matrices. We indicate this procedure with the notation
This procedure applies generally to the addition of matrices.
The sum of two matrices of the same size is obtained by adding corresponding elements. If
two matrices are not of the same size, they cannot be added; we say that their sum does not
exist. Subtraction is performed on matrices of the same size by subtracting corresponding
elements.
Now we apply the deﬁnition of matrix addition in the next two examples.
For the following matrices:
determine the sums A+B and B+C if possible.

Let’s extend our deﬁnition to enable us to add more than just two matrices. For ex-
ample, deﬁne the sum of three matrices as
We add a string of matrices that are the same size by adding corresponding elements.

Although this analysis and others like it can be carried out without the use of matri-
ces, the handling of large quantities of data is often most efﬁciently done on com-
puters using matrix techniques.
Scalar Multiplication
Another matrix operation multiplies a matrix by a number like
This product is deﬁned to be
Notice that this operation multiplies each entry in the matrix by 4. This illustrates
the procedure for scalar multiplication, so called because mathematicians often use
the term scalar to refer to a number.
Scalar multiplication is the operation of multiplying a matrix by a number (scalar). Each
entry in the matrix is multiplied by the scalar.

and 13 microwave ovens in March. She sold 12 
washers, 11 dryers, and 6 microwave ovens in April.
3. Citizen’s Bank awards prizes to the employees who
sign up the largest number of new customers. In
October, Joe signed up 12 new checking accounts,
15 savings accounts, and 8 safe deposit boxes. Jane
signed up 11 new checking accounts, 18 savings ac-
counts, and 9 safe deposit boxes. Judy signed up 5
new checking accounts, 8 savings accounts, and 21
safe deposit boxes.
4. Tom scored 78, 82, and 72 on the ﬁrst three biology
exams. Dick scored 62, 71, and 76. Harriet scored
98, 70, and 81.
5. Bill, Brett, and Jason took a golf weekend vacation.
On the way home they compared their scores. Bill
had a birdie on 8 holes, a par on 15 holes, and was
over par on 13 holes. Brett had a birdie on 6 holes,
a par on 23 holes, and was over par on 7 holes.
Jason had one birdie, a par on 17 holes, and was
over par on 18 holes. Represent this summary of
their scores with a matrix.
6. A media commentator was speculating on how
newspapers of the future would differ from today’s
newspapers. Two characteristics mentioned were:
(a) Identifying their top advertisers and putting
their ads in the newspaper and online.
(b) Increasing local news coverage and reducing
national and international coverage.
A survey of news media veterans found the 
following:
(a) Place ads in both newspapers and online: 10
thought it was a great idea, 8 thought it had
possibilities, 5 didn’t know, and 7 considered it
a bad idea.
(b) Increase local coverage and reduce national
and international coverage: 3 thought it 
was a great idea, 9 thought it had possibilities,
12 didn’t know, and 6 considered it a bad 
idea.
Represent this information with a matrix.
7. In 2003, UNAIDS reported an estimated
37,800,000 current cases of HIV/AIDS worldwide
with 4,800,000 new cases and 2,900,000 deaths. Of
these, sub-Saharan Africa had 25,000,000 current
cases, 3,000,000 new cases, and 2,200,000 deaths.
South/Southeast Asia accounted for 6,500,000 cur-
rent cases, 850,000 new cases, and 460,000 deaths.
North America reported 1,000,000 current cases,
44,000 new cases, and 16,000 deaths. Represent this
information as a matrix.
8. The Recording Industry of America reports that
the number of music CDs, cassettes, and music
videos sold in 1995 was 723 million CDs, 273 mil-
lion cassettes, and 13 million music videos. In 2003,
the numbers were 746 million CDs, 17 million cas-
settes, and 20 million music videos. Use a matrix to
represent this information.
9. The U.S. Department of Commerce reports that 
total personal income was $6152 billion in 1995,
$8430 billion in 2000, and $9162 billion in 2003. For

the same years, personal savings amounted to 
$251 billion in 1995, $169 billion in 2000, and 
$111 billion in 2003. Summarize this information 
in matrix form.
10. One statistic that the U.S. Census Bureau main-
tains is the percentage of the U.S. population that
has never married. For the 20 –24 age group, their
records show that in 1970 54.7% of males had never
married while 35.8% of females never had. In 2000,
the ﬁgures increased to 83.7% for males and 72.8%
for females. In 2003, 86.0% of the males and 75.4%
of the females had never married. Show this infor-

Row Operations Using Matrix Multiplication
You have learned to add matrices and multiply a matrix by a number. You may nat-
urally ask whether one can multiply two matrices together and whether this helps to
solve problems. Mathematicians have devised a way of multiplying two matrices. It

might seem rather complicated, but it has many useful applications. For example,
you will learn how to use matrix multiplication to solve a problem like the following.
A manufacturer makes tables and chairs. The time, in hours, required to as-
semble and ﬁnish the items is given by the matrix
Chair
Table
The total assembly and ﬁnishing time required to produce 950 chairs and 635 tables
can be obtained by an appropriate matrix multiplication. The procedure of multi-
plying matrices may appear strange. Following a description of how to multiply two
matrices are some examples of the uses of matrix multiplication. But ﬁrst, here’s an
overview of the process:
1.
For two matrices A and B, we will ﬁnd their product AB. Their product is a ma-
trix called C, that is, AB=C.
2.
C is a matrix. The problem is to ﬁnd the entries of C.
3.
Each entry in C will depend on a row from matrix A and a column from ma-
trix B.
We call the entry in row i and column j the (i, j) entry of a matrix. The (i, j) en-
try in C is a number obtained using all entries of row i in A and using all entries of
column j in B. For example, the (2, 3) entry in C depends on row 2 of A and column
3 of B. We show you how to ﬁnd an entry in C by using the dot product of a row in A
and a column in B.
Dot Product
We use the two matrices
to illustrate matrix multiplication AB. We use the ﬁrst row of A, R1=[1
3], and
the ﬁrst column of B,
to ﬁnd the (1, 1) entry of the product. To do so, we need to ﬁnd what is called the dot
product, R1  C1, of the row and column. It is
R1  C1=[1
3] 
=1(4)+3(1)=7
Notice the following:
1.
The dot product of a row and a column gives a single number.
2.
Obtain the dot product by multiplying the ﬁrst numbers from both the row and
column, then the second numbers from both, and so on, and then adding the
results.

There are three other dot products possible using a row from A and a column from

R2  C1=[2
–1] 
=2(4)+(–1)(1)=7
R2  C2=[2
–1] 
=2(–5)+(–1)(6)=–16
The general form of the dot product of a row and column is
[a1
a2 p an] 
=a1b1+a2b2+p+anbn
The total cost of a purchase at the grocery store can be determined by using 
the dot product of a price matrix and a quantity matrix as illustrated in the next
example.
Let the row matrix [0.95
1.75
2.15] represent the prices of a loaf of bread, a six-
pack of soft drinks, and a package of granola bars, in that order. Let
represent the quantity of bread (5), soft drinks (3), and granola bars (4) purchased
in that order. Then the dot product
[0.95
1.75
2.15] 
=0.95(5)+1.75(3)+2.15(4)
=4.75+5.25+8.60=18.60
gives the total cost of the purchase.

Multiplication of Matrices
145
As you work with the product of two matrices, AB, notice how the size of AB
relates to the size of A and the size of B. You will ﬁnd that
• The number of rows of A equals the number of rows of AB.
• The number of columns of B equals the number of columns of AB.
• The number of columns of A must equal the number of rows of B.
Given matrices A and B, to ﬁnd AB=C (matrix multiplication):
1.
Check the number of columns of A and the number of rows of B. If they are
equal, the product is possible. If they are not equal, no product is possible.
2.
Form all possible dot products using a row from A and a column from B. The
dot product of row i with column j gives the entry for the (i, j) position in C.
3.
The number of rows in C is the same as the number of rows in A. The num-
ber of columns in C is the same as the number of columns in B.
We now return to the problem at the beginning of the section and show a
simple use of matrix multiplication.
The time, in hours, required to assemble and ﬁnish a table and a chair is given by the
matrix
Chair
Table
How long will it take to assemble and ﬁnish 950 chairs and 635 tables?
Solution
Matrix multiplication gives the answer when we let
be the column matrix that speciﬁes the number of chairs and tables produced. Mul-
tiply the matrices:
The rows of the result correspond to the rows in the ﬁrst matrix; the ﬁrst row in each
represents assembly time, and the second represents ﬁnishing time. In the ﬁnal ma-
trix, 3805 is the total number of hours of assembly, and 5391.25 is the total number of
hours for ﬁnishing required for 950 chairs and 635 tables.

This example shows that AB and BA are not always equal. In fact, sometimes one of
them may exist and the other not. The following example illustrates this.
Find AB and BA, if possible.
Solution
When we attempt to use row 1 from B and column 1 from A to ﬁnd the (1, 1) entry
of BA, we ﬁnd no entry in row 1 of matrix B to multiply by the bottom entry, 1, of
column 1 of A. Therefore, we, cannot complete the computation. BA does not exist.

Set up the matrix of closing prices by letting each column represent a stock and each
row a day:
High

We point out that using rows to represent stocks and columns to represent days is
also acceptable. The matrix showing the number of shares of each company could be
either a row matrix or a column matrix. Which of the matrices giving the number of

is possible. Does it give the desired result? Notice that the ﬁrst entry in the answer,
26,160, is obtained by
56(150)+132(100)+19(240)
which is
(price of Acme)*(no. shares of Acme)
+(price of High Tech)*(no. shares of High Tech)
+(price of ABC)*(no. shares of ABC)
This is exactly what is needed to ﬁnd the total value of the portfolio on Monday. The
other entries are correct for the other days.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 69,pg.154 ■
When you use a matrix product in an application, check to see which order of mul-
tiplication makes sense.
If you ask a person to set up the stock data in matrix form, they might well let
the columns represent days of the week and the rows the stocks. The matrix then
takes the form
Mon
Tue Wed
Thu
Fri
In this case, the matrix representing the number of shares must assume a form that
makes sense when the matrices are multiplied to obtain the portfolio value. Use the
form [150
100
240], and the product
=[26,160
26,110
26,150
26,380
25,790]
gives daily portfolio values.
Thus, a matrix may be written in different ways as long as it is understood what
the rows and columns represent, and the rows and columns of each matrix are ar-
ranged so the multiplication makes sense.
Identity Matrix
You are familiar with the number fact
1*a=a*1=a
where a is any real number. We call 1 the identity for multiplication.
In general, we have no similar property for multiplication of matrices; there is
no one matrix I such that AI=IA=A for all matrices A. However, there is such
a matrix for square matrices of a given size. For example, if
A = B4

then
and
Furthermore, for any 2*2 matrix A, the matrix I has the property that AI=A
and IA=A. This can be justiﬁed by using a 2*2 matrix with arbitrary entries
Now
You should now multiply IA to verify that it is indeed A. Thus,
is the identity matrix for all 2*2 matrices. If we try to multiply the 3*3 matrix
we ﬁnd we are unable to multiply at all because A has 3 columns and I has only two
rows. So,

In general, if we let I be the n*n matrix with ones on the main diagonal and
zeros elsewhere, it is the identity matrix for the class of all n*n matrices. (The
main diagonal runs from the upper left to the lower right corner.)
Row Operations Using Matrix Multiplication
We can perform row operations on a matrix by multiplying by a modiﬁed identity
matrix. Let’s illustrate.
Let A=
and
We know that IA=A. Now interchange rows 1 and 2 of I and multiply times A.
Notice that this multiplication interchanges rows 1 and 2 of A. This illustrates a
general property.
If a matrix A has n rows and I is the n*n identity matrix, then modify I by in-
terchanging two rows, giving matrix IM. The product IMA interchanges the corre-
sponding rows of A.
Next, modify I by adding row 3 to row 1 giving 
.
Notice that rows 2 and 3 are unchanged, but row 1 is now the sum of rows 1 and
3. In the notation we have used for row operations, this product gives R1+R3 →
R1. Next we add row 1 to row 3 (R1+R3 →R3) and multiply.
Row 1 has been added to row 3 and the result stored in row 3.
Let’s give one more example. Modify I by the row operation 2R2+R1 →R1,
giving
.

The result is the row operation 2R2+R1 →R1 on A.
We summarize these examples with a general property they represent.
If a matrix A has n rows and I is the n*n identity matrix, then modify I by a row
operation like 5R2+R4 →R4, giving matrix IM. The product IMA performs the
same row operation on A.

The Inverse of a Matrix
159
USING EXCEL
EXCEL has a command, MMULT, that performs the multiplication of two matrices. To illustrate, let’s use the matrices
Because A has 2 rows and B has 4 columns, the product AB has 2 rows and 4 columns.
Enter matrix A in cells A2:C3 and matrix B in E2:H4. We will put AB in cells A6:D7.
To calculate AB, select the cells A6:D7 and type =MMULT(A2:C3,E2:H4). Notice that this has the form
=MMULT(Location of matrix A, Location of matrix B). The next step differs from the usual press RETURN. To activate
matrix multiplication, simultaneously press the CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER keys. Then the product shows in cells
A6:D7.

have a common property. Each of the numbers 2, 
and 1.25 can be multiplied by
another number to obtain 1. In general, for any real number a, except zero, there is
a number b such that a*b=1. We call b the inverse of a. The standard notation
for the inverse of a is a–⁄.
A similar property exists in terms of matrix multiplication. For example,
We can restate this equation as A
=I, where
We call 
the inverse of the matrix A.

If A and B are square matrices such that AB=BA=I, then B is the inverse matrix of
A. The inverse of A is denoted 
. If B is found so that AB=I, then a theorem from lin-
ear algebra states that BA=I, so it is sufﬁcient to just check AB=I.
Only square matrices have inverses.

In general, a matrix A has an inverse if there is a matrix 
that fulﬁlls the condi-
tions that A
=
A=I. Not all matrices have inverses. In fact, a matrix must
be square in order to have an inverse, and some square matrices have no inverse. We
now come to the problem of deciding if a square matrix has an inverse. If it does, how
do we ﬁnd it? Let’s approach this problem with a simple 2*2 example.
If we have the square matrix
ﬁnd its inverse, if possible.
Solution
We want to ﬁnd a 2*2 matrix 
such that A
=I. Because we don’t know the

Recall that two matrices are equal only when they have equal entries in correspond-

Notice that we have one system of two equations with variables x1 and x2 :

The solution to system 1 gives x1=2, x2=–3. The solution to system 2 gives

Look at the two systems we just solved. The two systems have precisely the same
coefﬁcients; they differ only in the constant terms. The left-hand portions of the aug-
mented matrices are exactly the same. In fact, each is the matrix A.
This means that when we solve each of the two systems using the Gauss-
Jordan Method, we use precisely the same row operations. Thus, we can solve both
systems using one matrix. Here’s how: Combine the two augmented matrices into
one using the common coefﬁcient portion on the left, and list both columns from the
right sides. This gives the matrix
Notice that the left portion of the matrix is A and the right portion is the identity
matrix.
Now proceed in the same way you do to solve a system of equations with an aug-
mented matrix; that is, use row operations to reduce the left-hand portion to the
identity matrix. This gives the following sequence:

The Inverse of a Matrix

The ﬁnal matrix has the identity matrix formed by the ﬁrst two columns. The third
column gives the solution to the ﬁrst system, and the fourth column gives the solu-
tion to the second system. Notice that the last two columns form 
. This is no ac-
cident; one may ﬁnd the inverse of a square matrix in this manner.
1.
To ﬁnd the inverse of a matrix A, form an augmented matrix [A | I ] by writ-
ing down the matrix A and then writing the identity matrix to the right of A.
2.
Perform a sequence of row operations that reduces the A portion of this ma-
trix to reduced echelon form.
3.
If the A portion of the reduced echelon form is the identity matrix, then the
matrix found in the I portion is 
.
4.
If the reduced echelon form produces a row in the A portion that is all zeros,
then A has no inverse.
Now use this method to ﬁnd the inverse of a matrix.

The Inverse of a Matrix
165
Whenever we reach an inconsistency in trying to solve a system of equations, we con-
clude that there is no solution. Therefore, in this case A has no inverse.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 17,pg.170 ■
In general, when we use an augmented matrix [A | I] to ﬁnd the inverse of A and
reach a step where a row of the A portion is all zeros, then A has no inverse.
Matrix Equations
We can write systems of equations using matrices and solve some systems using ma-
trix inverses.
The matrix equation
becomes the following when the multiplication on the left is performed:
These matrices are equal only when corresponding components are equal; that is,
5x1+ 3x2- 4x3+12x4=
7
8x1-21x2+ 7x3-19x4= 16
2x1+
x2-15x3+
x4=–22
In general, we can write a system of equations in the compact matrix form
AX=B
where A is a matrix formed from the coefﬁcients of the variables
X is a column matrix formed by listing the variables
and B is the column matrix formed from the constants in the system

Using A1 to Solve a System
Now we can illustrate the use of the inverse in solving a system of equations when
the matrix of coefﬁcients has an inverse. Sometimes it helps to be able to solve a sys-
tem by using the inverse matrix. One such situation occurs when a number of sys-
tems need to be solved, and all have the same coefﬁcients; that is, the constant terms
change, but the coefﬁcients don’t. Here is a simple example.
A doctor treats patients who need adequate calcium and iron in their diet. The
doctor has found that two foods, A and B, provide these. Each unit of food A has
0.5 milligram (mg) iron and 25 mg calcium. Each unit of food B has 0.3 mg iron and
7 mg calcium. Let x=number of units of food A eaten by the patient; let y=num-
ber of units of food B eaten by the patient. Then 0.5x+0.3y gives the total mil-
ligrams of iron consumed by the patient and 25x+7y gives the total milligrams of
calcium. Suppose the doctor wants patient Jones to get 6 mg iron and 60 mg calcium.
The amount of each food to be consumed is the solution to
0.5x+0.3y= 6
25x+ 7y=60
If patient Smith requires 7 mg iron and 80 mg calcium, the amount of food required
is found in the solution of the system
0.5x+0.3y= 7
25x+ 7y=80
These two systems have the same coefﬁcients; they differ only in the constant terms.

The Inverse of a Matrix
167
The inverse of the coefﬁcient matrix
may be used to avoid going through the Gauss-Jordan elimination process with each
patient.
Here’s how 
may be used to solve a system. Let AX=B be a system for
which A actually has an inverse. When both sides of AX=B are multiplied by 
, the equation reduces to
AX=
B
IX=
B
X=
B
The product 
B gives the solution. The solution to such a system exists, and it is
unique.
Use an inverse matrix to solve the system of equations:
x1+3x2+2x3= 3
2x1+4x2+2x3= 8
x1+2x2- x3=10
Solution
First, write the system in matrix form, AX=B:
In matrix form the solution is
The inverse was found in Example 4. Substitute it and obtain
The system has the unique solution x1=3, x2=2, x3=–3. (Check this solution
in each of the original equations.)

Note
Using the inverse of
the coefﬁcient matrix
may not be the most
efﬁcient way to solve 
a single system of
equations.However,
some applications
require the solution of
several systems of
equations in which all
the systems have the
same coefﬁcient matrix.
Using the inverse of
the coefﬁcient matrix
can be more efﬁcient
in this situation.
Using the inverse of
the coefﬁcient matrix
to solve a single sys-
tem of equations may
be the most efﬁcient
way when solving
using a computer or
graphing calculator.

The Inverse of a Matrix
169
Let’s return to the earlier example where a doctor prescribed foods containing cal-
cium and iron. Let
x=the number of units of food A
y=the number of units of food B
where A contains 0.5 mg iron and 25 mg calcium and B contains 0.3 mg iron and 7 mg
calcium per unit.
(a) Find the amount of each food for patient Jones, who needs 1.3 mg iron and
49 mg calcium.
(b) Find the amount of each food for patient Smith, who needs 2.6 mg iron and
106 mg calcium.
Solution
(a) We need the solution to
0.5x+0.3y=1.3 (amount of iron)
25x+7y=49 (amount of calcium)
In matrix form this is
The inverse of
The solution to the system is
so 1.4 units of food A and 2.0 units of food B are required.

48. Carol Riggs is the plant manager of Health Fare
Cereal Company, which makes three cereals using
wheat, oats, and raisins. She receives a daily report
on the amount of wheat, oats, and raisins used in
production and the number of boxes of each kind of
cereal produced. To determine the loss, if any, due
to waste and other causes, she likes to compare the
ingredients used to the amounts of cereals possible

LEONTIEF INPUT–OUTPUT MODEL IN ECONOMICS
•
The Leontief Economic Model
The economic health of our country affects each of us in some way. You want a good
job upon graduation. The availability of a good job depends on the ability of an eco-
nomic system to deal with problems that arise. Some problems are challenging in-
deed. How do we control inﬂation? How do we avoid a depression? How will a
change in interest rates affect my options in buying a house or a car?
A better understanding of the interrelationships between prices, production, in-
terest rates, consumer demand, and the like could improve our ability to deal with
economic problems. Matrix theory has been successful in describing mathematical
models used to analyze how industries depend on one another in an economic sys-
tem. Wassily Leontief of Harvard University pioneered work in this area with a mas-
sive analysis of the U.S. economic system. As a result of the mathematical models he
developed, he received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1973. Since that time, we
have seen the applications of the Leontief input–output model mushroom. The
model is widely used to study the economic structure of businesses, corporations,
and political units like cities, states, and countries. In practice, a large number 
of variables are required to describe an economic situation. Thus, the problems 
are quite complicated, so they can best be handled with computers using matrix
techniques.
This section introduces the concept of the Leontief economic model, using rel-
atively simple examples to suggest its use in more realistic situations.
The Leontief Economic Model
In the input–output model, we have an economic system consisting of a number of
industries that both produce goods and use goods. Some of the goods produced are
used in the industrial processes themselves, and some goods are available to out-
siders, the consumers.
To illustrate the input–output model, imagine a simple economy with just two
industries: electricity and steel. These industries exist to produce electricity and steel
for the consumers. However, both production processes themselves use electricity

2.7
Leontief Input–Output Model in Economics
177
and steel. The electricity industry uses steel in the generating equipment and uses
electricity to light the plant and to heat and cool the buildings. The steel industry
uses electricity to run some of its equipment, and that equipment in turn contains
steel components.
In the economic model, the quantities in the input–output matrix can be ap-
proximate measures of the goods, such as weight, volume, or value. We will describe
the quantities in terms of dollar values. We are interested in the quantities of each
product needed to provide for the consumers (their demand) and to provide for that
consumed internally.
The amount of electricity and steel consumed by the electric company and the steel
company in producing their own products depends on the amount they produce. For
example, an electric company may ﬁnd that whatever the value of electricity pro-
duced, 15% of that goes to pay for the electricity used internally and 5% goes to pay
for the steel used in production. Thus, if the electric company produces $200,000
worth of electricity, then $30,000 worth (15%) of electricity and $10,000 worth (5%)
of steel are consumed by the electric company. Now let’s state this concept in a more
general form and bring in the cost of producing steel as well.
Let x be the value of electricity produced and y the value of steel produced. The
cost of producing electricity includes the following: Of the value of the electricity
produced, x, 15% of it, 0.15x, pays for the electricity, and 5%, 0.05x, pays for the steel
consumed internally. Similarly, the cost of producing steel includes the following: 
Of the value of the steel produced, y, 40% of it, 0.40y, pays for the electricity, and
10% of it, 0.10y, pays for the steel consumed internally. We can express this infor-
mation as
Total electricity consumed internally=0.15x+0.40y
Total steel consumed internally=0.05x+0.10y
Now note that this can also be expressed as
The coefﬁcient matrix used here is called the input–output matrix of the pro-
duction model. The column headings identify the output, the amount produced, by
each industry. The row headings identify the input, the amount used in production,
by each industry.
Output
(Amount produced by)
Electricity

Input
There is one row for each industry. The row labeled electricity gives the value of
the electricity ($0.15) needed to produce $1 worth of electricity and the value of the
electricity ($0.40) needed to produce $1 worth of steel. The second row shows the
value of the steel ($0.05) needed to produce $1 worth of electricity and the value of
the steel ($0.10) needed to produce $1 worth of steel.

We have shown how the internal consumption of two industries can be represented
with matrices. The input–output matrix is the central element of the Leontief eco-
nomic model. We proceed to show how we can use matrices to answer other ques-
tions about an economy. But ﬁrst, be sure you understand the makeup of the input–
output matrix. The entries give the fraction of goods produced by one industry that
are used in producing 1 unit of goods in another industry. The row heading of the
input–output matrix identiﬁes the industry that provides goods to the industry iden-
tiﬁed by the column heading.
The Electricity–Steel input–output matrix

should be interpreted in the following way.
You might be wondering why this information is presented in matrix form. It
makes it easier to answer questions such as these:
1.
The production capacity of industry is $9 million worth of electricity and 
$7 million worth of steel. How much of each is consumed internally by the pro-
duction processes?
2.
The consumers want $6 million worth of electricity and $8 million worth of steel
for their use. How much of each should be produced to satisfy their demands
and also to provide for the amounts consumed internally?
Before we learn how to answer these two questions, let’s make some observa-
tions that will help set up the problems.
First, let x=the dollar value of electricity produced and y=the dollar value of
steel produced. These values include that used internally for production and that
available to the consumers. Then the total amounts consumed internally are
Electricity consumed internally=0.15x+0.40y
Steel consumed internally=0.05x+0.10y
which we expressed in matrix form as
If production capacities are $9 million worth of electricity (x=9) and $7 million
worth of steel (y=7), the amount consumed internally is

$4.15 million worth of electricity and $1.15 million worth of steel.
Another fact relates the amount of electricity and steel produced to that avail-
able to the consumer:
[amount produced]=
We call these matrices output, internal demand, and consumer demand matrices, re-
spectively.
In the case in which $9 million worth of electricity and $7 million worth of steel
were produced with $4.15 and $1.15 million consumed internally, we have
Internal
Output
Demand
Consumer Demand
–
=
We get $4.85 million and $5.85 million worth of electricity and steel available to the
consumers.
If we call the output matrix X, the consumer demand matrix D, and the 
input–output matrix A, then the internal demand matrix is AX and X-AX is the
quantity of goods available for consumers, and so X-AX=D expresses the re-
lation between output, internal demand, and consumer demand. 
We can look at the production problem from another perspective, the problem
of determining the production needed to provide a known consumer demand. For
example, the question, “What total output is necessary to supply consumers with
$6 million worth of electricity and $8 million worth of steel?” asks for the output X
when consumer demand D is given. Using the same input–output matrix, we want
to ﬁnd x and y (output) so that
X-AX=D
Notice that the variables x and y appear in two matrices.
Let’s use the equation X-AX=D to apply some matrix algebra to ﬁnd the
matrix X.
You need to solve for the matrix X in
X-AX=D
This is equivalent to solving for X in the following:
X-AX=D

The last equation is the most helpful. To ﬁnd the total production X that meets the
ﬁnal demand D and also provides the quantities needed to carry out the internal pro-
duction processes, ﬁnd the inverse of the matrix I-A (as you did in Section 2.6)
and multiply it by the matrix D. For example, using
and
where the entries in (I-A)–1 are rounded. For the demand matrix,
So, $11.544 million worth of electricity and $9.531 million worth of steel must be pro-
duced to provide $6 million worth of electricity and $8 million worth of steel to the
consumers and to provide for the electricity and steel used internally in production.
The matrix equation for the Leontief input–output model that relates total pro-
duction to the internal demands of the industries and to consumer demand is
given by
X-AX=D
or the equivalent,
(I-A)X=D
where A is the input–output matrix giving information on internal demands, D
represents consumer demands, and X represents the total goods produced.
The solution to (I-A)X=D is
X=(I-A)–1D
[provided (I-A)–1 exists]
An input–output matrix for electricity and steel is
(a) If the production capacity of electricity is $15 million and the production capac-
ity for steel is $20 million, how much of each is consumed internally for capacity
production?

Solution
(a) Since $0.40 worth of energy is required to produce $1.00 worth of lumber,
$0.40(750,000)=$300,000 worth of energy is required.
(b) The largest amount of energy per unit is $0.50 worth of energy used to produce
$1.00 worth of grain. The least amount of energy per unit is $0.15 worth of en-
ergy used to produce $1.00 worth of energy.
(c) Let
x1=total value of grain produced
x2=total value of lumber produced
x3=total value of energy produced
The value of grain used internally is
0.10x1+0.10x2+0.05x3
The value of lumber used internally is
0.20x1+0.15x2+0.35x3
The value of energy used internally is
0.50x1+0.40x2+0.15x3
so the input–output matrix is
User
G
L
E
Supplier
(d) The total cost of producing $1.00 worth of lumber is found by totaling the 
entries in column 2 of the input–output matrix, because those entries represent
the value of G, L, and E to produce $1.00 worth of lumber. Total cost=$0.65.
(e) The internal demand is given by
The internal consumption of the system is $193,000 worth of grain, $591,000
worth of lumber, and $787,000 worth of energy to produce a total of $640,000
worth of grain, $800,000 worth of lumber, and $980,000 worth of energy.
(f) In this case,
so we need to solve X=(I-A)–1D.

Today the concept of a world economy has become a reality. In 1973, the UnitedNa-
tions commissioned an input–output model of the world economy. The aim of the
model was to transform the vast collection of economic facts that describe the world
economy into an organized system from which economic projections could and have
been made. In the model, the world is divided into 15 distinct geographic regions,
each one described by an individual input–output matrix. The regions are then
linked by a larger matrix that is used in an input–output model. Overall, more than
200 variables enter into the model, and the computations are of course done on a
computer. By feeding in projected values for certain variables, researchers use the
model to create scenarios of future world economic possibilities.
We need to understand that this model is not a crystal ball that shows exactly
what the future holds. It gives an indication of situations that can develop if trends
continue unchanged. We can change the trends and thereby alter future conditions.
For example, the model predicted energy problems of major negative consequences
by 2025. Conservation, more efﬁcient automobile design, and recycling have helped
change the energy use patterns that were in place in 1973. Although energy prob-
lems have not vanished, they are different.
Mathematical models can provide an “early warning” of what might be and al-
low policymakers to make adjustments to avoid or soften potential problems.

Using EXCEL
Let’s illustrate how to use EXCEL in input–output calculations. We use the input-output matrix 
.
Internal Demand
To ﬁnd the internal demand for the output matrix 
, do the following: Enter A in the cells A2:C4 and X in
cells E2:E4. Since AX will be a column matrix with three rows, select cells G2:G4 and type MMULT(A2:C4,E2:E4);
then press control-shift-enter, which gives the internal demand matrix 
.
Find Output Given Demand
When given the demand matrix 
, we ﬁnd the output matrix 
as follows.
•
Enter A in cells A2:C4.
•
Enter 
in cells A6:C8.
•
Enter D in cells E6:F8.
•
Next compute I-A and place the result in A10:C12. Type A6-A2 in A10 and drag A10 to the rest of the cells in
A10:C12, which gives
•
Find (I-A)1 and store it in cells A14:C16 by selecting the cells A14:C16 and then typing 
MINVERSE(A10:C12), which gives 
•
Multiply (I-A)1 D with the result in A18:B20 by selecting the cells A18:B20 and typing 
MMULT(A14:C16,E6:F8); then press control-shift-enter. This gives the result

LINEAR REGRESSION
Business, industry, and governments are interested in answers to such questions as,
“How many cell phones will be needed in the next three years?” “What will be the
population growth of Boulder, Colorado, over the next ﬁve years?” “Will the Mid-
way School District need to build an additional elementary school within three
years?” “How much will the number of 18-wheelers on I-35 increase over the next
decade?”
Answers to these kinds of questions are important because it may take years 
to build the manufacturing plants, schools, or highways. In some cases, information
from past years can indicate a trend from which reasonable estimates of future
growth can be obtained. For example, the problem of air quality has been addressed
by cities in recent years. The cities of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California have
made signiﬁcant progress, as shown by the following table, which gives the number
of days during the year that the Air Quality Index exceeded 100. As the index ex-
ceeds 100, the environment becomes unhealthy for sensitive groups.
When we plot this information using the year (1 for 1994, 2 for 1995, and so on) for
the x-value and the number of days for the y-value, we get the graph of Figure 2–11.
We call a graph of points such as this a scatter plot. Notice that the points have
a general, approximate linear downward trend, even though the points do not lie on
a line. Even when the pattern of data points is not exactly linear, it may be useful to
approximate their trend with a line so that we can estimate future behavior.
There may be cases when we believe the variables are related in a linear man-
ner, but the data deviate from a line because (1) the data collected may not be accu-

rate or (2) the assumption of a linear relationship is not valid. In either case, it may
be useful to ﬁnd the line that best approximates the trend and use it to obtain addi-
tional information and make predictions.
Figure 2–12 shows a line that approximates the trend of the points in Fig-
ure 2–11.
Although the line seems to be a reasonable representation of the general
trend, we would like to know if this is the best approximation of the trend. Math-
ematicians use the least squares line, also called the regression line, for the line
that best ﬁts the data. In Figure 2–12, the line shown is the least squares, or re-
gression, line y=–21.9x+158. You have not been told how to ﬁnd that equa-
tion. Before doing so, let’s look at the idea behind the least squares procedure.
In Figure 2–13, we look at a simple case where we have drawn a line in the gen-
eral direction of the trend of the scatter plot of the four points 
and 
For each of the points, we have indicated the vertical distance from 
each point to the line and labeled the distances d1, d2, d3, and d4. The distances 
to points above the line will be positive, and the distances to the points below the line
will be negative. The basic idea of the least squares procedure is to ﬁnd a 
line that somehow minimizes the entirety of these distances. To do so, ﬁnd the line

that gives the smallest possible sum of the squares of the d’s—that is, the line
y=mx+b that makes
the least value possible.
We ﬁnd the values of m and b of the regression line y=mx+b from a sys-
tem of two equations in the variables m and b. Let’s illustrate the procedure us-
ing the points (2, 5), (3, 7), (5, 9), and (6, 11). The scatter plot is shown in Fig-
ure 2–14.
The system takes the form
Am+Bb=C
Dm+Eb=F
where
A=the sum of the squares of the x-coordinates; in this case,
22+32+52+62=74.
B=the sum of the x-coordinates of the given points; in this case,
2+3+5+6=16.
C=the sum of the products of the x- and y-coordinates of the given points; in
this case, (2*5)+(3*7)+(5*9)+(6*11)=142.
D=B, the sum of the x-coordinates, 16.
E=the number of given points, in this case, four points.
F=the sum of the y-coordinates; in this case, 5+7+9+11=32.
Thus, the solution to the system
74m+16b=142
16m+ 4b= 32

gives the coefﬁcients of the regression line that best ﬁts the four given points. The so-
lution is m=1.4 and b=2.4 (be sure you can ﬁnd the solution), and the linear re-
gression line is y=1.4x+2.4 (see Figure 2–15).
The linear function y=mx+b is the least squares line for the points (x1, y1),
(x2, y2), p , (xn, yn) when m and b are solutions of the system of equations.
We now show you two ways to organize the data that makes it easier to keep
track of the computations needed to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients of the system.
Method I.
Form a table like the following.
This gives the system
74m+16b=142
16m+ 4b= 32
Method II.
We ﬁnd the augmented matrix A of the system of equations, with
a matrix product. For this example, it is
We state the general case as follows: Given the points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), p , (xn, yn),
the augmented matrix M of the system
Am+Bb=C
Dm+Eb=F
whose solution gives the least squares line of best ﬁt for the given points is the
product
This method is useful when using a calculator with matrix operations.

Let’s use the data on the number of cell phones in use in the United States and work
an example.
A wireless industry survey estimates the number of cell-phone subscribers in the
United States for 1998–2003 as follows.
Find the scatter plot and the least squares line y=mx+b, where x is the year
(x=1 for 1998, x =2 for 1999, etc.) and y is the number of subscribers.
We will ﬁnd the coefﬁcients of the system of equations using both methods. Fig-
ure 2–16 shows the scatter plot.
Method I.
The system of equations is
Multiplying the ﬁrst equation by 2 and the second equation by 7, we obtain the

Linear Programming
The claim “We’re number one!”is proclaimed in many ways and places,some-
times with good reason and sometimes not.We have the World Series in base-
ball, the Super Bowl in football, the Miss America Pageant for talented and
beautiful women,the Olympic Games,and numerous championship compe-
titions that attempt to determine the best,the fastest,and the strongest.
Corporations spend millions of dollars in TV advertising to convince the
public that their drink,snack,automobile,or toothpaste is the best.Spectators
don’t hesitate to debate, often with great emotion, which team or athlete is
number one.
You may ask what this has to do with a mathematics course. It has to do
with using mathematics to help corporations and businesses compete in the
marketplace.To compete successfully,a company would like to be the best in
performance and in its products. Answers should be sought to important
questions such as the following:“How can we achieve the most efﬁcient pro-
duction?”“How can we obtain maximum proﬁt?”“What personnel and equip-
ment are needed to complete the project on time and hold costs to a mini-
mum?”Although not the same as the question of who is number one, these
are questions of determining the best strategy or procedure that should be
achieved.Individuals and corporations look for ways to improve performance
to gain a competitive edge. A small reduction in cost per item can mean big
savings for a large corporation. The workers who give that little extra often
move ahead of their fellow workers.Thus,optimizing performance interests in-
dividuals and corporations. We call the solutions to such problems optimal
solutions. Some of these problems can be solved with a mathematical pro-
cedure known as linear programming.
One of those receiving a great deal of credit for the development of linear
programming is George B. Dantzig, a mathematician who worked on logistic
planning problems for the U.S. Air Force during World War II. He noticed that

many problems that he and his colleagues worked on had similar characteris-
tics and could be put in a form that we now call linear programming.Dantzig
realized that problems in game theory and economic models might have an
important underlying mathematical structure. Since that time, linear pro-
gramming has evolved,and applications abound in industry,government,and
business.
Today, linear programming helps determine the best diets, the most
efﬁcient production scheduling,the least waste of materials used in manufac-
turing, and the most economical transportation of goods. The term linear
programming refers to a precise procedure that will solve certain types of
optimization problems that involve linear conditions.
3.1
LINEAR INEQUALITIES IN TWO VARIABLES
A linear programming problem uses linear inequalities to help deﬁne the problem,
so let’s do a brief study of linear inequalities, their solutions, and their graphs. Such
a study will aid us in setting up and solving linear programming problems. Let’s look
at an example that is subject to restrictions expressed by linear inequalities.
The recommended minimum daily requirement of vitamin B6 for adults is
2.0 mg (milligram). A deﬁciency of vitamin B6 in men may increase their cholesterol
level and lead to a thickening and degeneration in the walls of their arteries. Many
meats, breads, and vegetables contain no vitamin B6. Fruits usually contain this vi-
tamin. For example, one small banana contains 0.45 mg of vitamin B6, and 1 ounce
of grapes contains 0.02 mg of vitamin B6. What quantities of bananas and grapes
should an adult consume in order to meet or exceed the minimum requirements?
Mathematically, this question is equivalent to asking for solutions of the linear
inequality
0.45x+0.02y  2.0
where x=the number of bananas eaten, and y=the number of ounces of grapes
eaten.
Let’s see how we solve inequalities like this. If a point is selected—say, (3, 5)—
and its coordinates are substituted into the inequality for x and y, we obtain
0.45(3)+0.02(5)=1.35+0.10
=1.45
which is not greater than 2.0
Because (3, 5) makes 0.45x+0.02y>2.0 false, (3, 5) is not a solution. However,
the point (4, 12) is a solution because
0.45(4)+0.02(12)=1.80+0.24
=2.04
Thus, x=4 and y=12 make the inequality true. Actually, an inﬁnite number of
points make the statement true, as we shall see.

3.1
Linear Inequalities in Two Variables
207
If an arbitrary point is selected and its coordinates substituted for x and y in
0.45x+0.02y
then we can expect one of three different outcomes:
0.45x+0.02y=2.0
0.45x+0.02y<2.0
or
0.45x+0.02y>2.0
You should recognize the ﬁrst of these, 0.45x+0.02y=2.0, as the equation of a
straight line. Any point that makes this statement true lies on that line. This line
holds the key to ﬁnding the solution to the original inequality. A line divides the
plane into two parts. The areas on either side of the line are called half planes. (See
Figure 3–1.)
One useful fact is that all the points that satisfy
0.45x+0.02y<2.0
lie on one side of the line 0.45x+0.02y=2.0 and all the points that satisfy
0.45x+0.02y 7 2.0
lie on the other side. We ﬁnd the solution when we determine which half plane
satisﬁes 0.45x+0.02y 7 2.0.
There is a simple way to decide. Just pick a point and substitute its coordi-
nates for x and y. For example, the point (10, 10) lies in the half plane above the 
line. As 0.45(10)+0.02(10)=4.5+0.2, the point (10, 10) satisﬁes the inequality
0.45x+0.02y 7 2.0. Consequently, all points above the line satisfy the same in-
equality. The graph of a linear inequality is the half plane above the line. Indicate this
by shading that half plane. (See Figure 3–2.) The line itself is not a part of the solu-
tion, so the line is shown dotted.
The next two examples illustrate the kinds of inequalities that might be encoun-
tered in a linear programming problem.

Linear Programming
(a) Solve 2x+3y  12.
(b) Solve 2x+3y 7 12.
Solution
First, replace the inequality by equals and obtain
2x+3y=12
This line divides the plane into two half planes (see Figure 3–3), the part where
2x+3y>12
and the part where
2x+3y<12
(a) To decide which part satisﬁes
2x+3y<12
select a point and substitute its coordinates for x and y. For example, the point
(0, 0) lies in the half plane below the line. Since 2(0)+3(0)=0<12, the
point (0, 0) satisﬁes the inequality 2x+3y<12. Consequently, all points be-
low the line satisfy the same inequality. The original graph of the inequality con-
sists of the points on the line and the points in the half plane below the line. In-
dicate this by shading that half plane. (See Figure 3– 4.) The line 2x+3y=12
is drawn as a solid line, indicating that it is a part of the solution.
If you select the point (5, 6), a point above the line, you ﬁnd that
2(5)+3(6)=28>12
so the half plane above the line is not the correct one. This is another way to con-
clude that the correct part is the half plane below the line.
(b) In part (a), we found that (0, 0) satisﬁes 2x+3y<12. Thus, all points in the
other half plane, the one opposite (0, 0), satisfy 2x+3y>12. The points on
the line are not a part of the solution because the “=” is not a part of the in-

You should not assume that the solution to an inequality 
will always lie above the line. For example, the line 3x-2y=12 divides the plane
in two parts. (See Figure 3–6.) The point (0, 0) satisﬁes 3x-2y<12, so the half
plane above the line represents 3x-2y<12 and the half plane below the line rep-
resents 3x-2y>12.
Graph the inequality x  5.
Solution
We use the line x=5 as a boundary and determine the correct half plane by check-
ing the point (0, 0). Because its coordinates satisfy x  5, it lies in the half plane
forming the solution. (See Figure 3–7.)

Chapter 3
Linear Programming
Use this procedure to graph the inequality deﬁned in the next example.
An automobile assembly plant has an assembly line that produces the Hatchback
Special and the Sportster. Each Hatchback requires 2.5 hours of assembly line time,
and each Sportster requires 3.5 hours. The assembly line has a maximum operating
time of 140 hours per week. Graph the number of cars of each type that can be pro-
duced in one week.
Solution
Let x be the number of Hatchback Specials and y be the number of Sportsters pro-
duced per week. The total amount of assembly line time required is
2.5x+3.5y
Because the total assembly line time is restricted to 140 hours, we need to graph the
solution of the inequality
2.5x+3.5y  140
Graph the line 2.5x+3.5y=140. Use a solid line. Because the point (0, 0) is a so-
lution to the system, it is in the half plane of the graph. Figure 3–8 shows the graph
of the inequality.
Notice that the points (20, 20), (10, 30), and (40, 10) all lie in the region of so-
lutions. This tells us that the combination 20 Hatchbacks and 20 Sportsters could be
produced, or 10 Hatchbacks and 30 Sportsters, or 40 Hatchbacks and 10 Sportsters.
The point (–10, 20) also lies in the region of solutions, but it makes no sense to say
that negative 10 Hatchbacks and 20 Sportsters could be produced. Thus, the nature
of the problem requires that neither x nor y can be negative. We can state this re-
striction with x  0 and y  0. Therefore, the inequalities that describe the prob-
lem are
2.5x+3.5y  140
x  0, y  0
These conditions restrict the graph to the ﬁrst quadrant, as shown in Figure 3–9.
When you set up a problem, you should be careful to include restrictions like this,
even though they may not be stated explicitly.

This example illustrates how methods of graphing an inequality are used to ﬁnd
the region that satisﬁes an inequality, but the context dictates that common sense be
used in interpreting the answer. For example, the point (10.3, 5.2) is in the region of
solutions, but it doesn’t make sense to talk about producing 10.3 Hatchbacks and 5.2
Sportsters. Once the region of solutions is found, in this instance only points with
whole number coordinates are reasonable.

Feasible Region
Linear programming problems are described by systems of linear inequalities rather
than systems of linear equations. The solution to a linear programming problem de-
pends on the ability to solve and graph such systems.

214
Chapter 3
Linear Programming
Because a linear inequality determines a region, we ﬁnd it helpful to identify
such a region; that is, we want to graph the solution set of a system of inequalities.
Let’s look at an example to illustrate.
Graph the region determined by the following system of inequalities.
2x+ y  10
x+3y  12
Solution
We want to ﬁnd and graph all points that make both inequalities true. We do so in
the following manner.
1.
We ﬁnd the graph of 2x+y  10.
(a) Graph the line 2x+y=10 (Figure 3–10a). Recall that this line divides 
the plane into two half planes, one of which is included in the solution of the
inequality.
(b) Select a test point not on the line, say (0, 0). If the test point satisﬁes
2x+y=10, it lies on the line, and you need to select another one.
(c) Substitute x=0 and y=0 into 2x+y  10, that is 2(0)+0  10. As
this is true, the point (0, 0) lies in the half plane of the solution. The arrows
attached to the graph of 2x+y=10 indicate the solution half plane (Fig-
ure 3–10b).
2.
Next, graph x+3y  12.
(a) Graph the line x+3y=12.
(b) Select a test point, say, (3, 4).
(c) Substitute x=3, y=4 into x+3y  12; that is, 3+3(4)  12. As this
makes x+3y  12 false, the point (3, 4) is not in the solution half plane.
The other half plane is the correct one. The arrows attached to x+3y=12
indicate the correct half plane (Figure 3–10c).
3.
The region determined by the system of inequalities is the region of points that
satisfy both inequalities. These points lie in the region where the two half planes
overlap and is indicated by the shaded region in Figure 3–10d. This region of
intersection is the solution set of the system of linear inequalities, and we call it
the feasible region.

Solutions of Systems of Inequalities:A Geometric Picture
215
Linear programming problems generally have a nonnegative condition on the vari-
ables, which states that some or all of the variables can never be negative because the
quantities they measure (number of items, weight of materials) can never be nega-
tive. This restriction is used in determining a feasible region.
Boundaries and Corners
Graph the solutions (feasible region) to the following system
x+ y  4
–3x+2y  3
x  0
Solution
The lines x+y=4, –3x+2y=3, and x=0 determine boundaries of the solu-
tion set. The half plane of the solution to each inequality is indicated with arrows
(Figure 3–11a). The intersection of these half planes forms the feasible region (Fig-
ure 3–11b). We call points A and B in Figure 3–11b corners of the feasible region
because they are points in the feasible region where boundaries intersect. Even
though C is a point of intersection of boundaries x=0 and x+y=4, it is not a
corner because it is not in the feasible region.
You will learn that the corners of the feasible region determine the optimal so-
lution to a linear programming problem. Thus, ﬁnding the corners becomes a criti-
cal step. We ﬁnd corners by solving pairs of simultaneous equations, using equations
of lines forming the boundary.
To ﬁnd corner A, the point of intersection of lines x=0 and –3x+2y=3, we
solve the system
x=0
–3x+2y=3
and obtain 
for corner A.

Chapter 3
Linear Programming
We ﬁnd the point of intersection of x+y=4 and –3x+2y=3 to obtain
corner B. The solution of the system
x+ y=4
–3x+2y=3
gives (1, 3) for corner B.
The point C (0, 4) is the solution of the system
x=0
x+y=4
and so it is the intersection of two boundary lines. However, the point (0, 4) does not
satisfy the inequality –3x+2y  3, so (0, 4) lies outside the feasible region.
This illustrates that you cannot pick two boundary lines arbitrarily and expect
their intersection to determine a corner point. You need to determine if the point lies
in the feasible region.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 5,pg.219 ■
Example 2 contained the nonnegative restriction, x  0. Both conditions x  0
and y  0 generally enter into linear programming problems because the variables
usually represent quantities such as the number of CD players. The other inequali-
ties represent restrictions associated with these quantities that are imposed by
equipment capacity, safety regulations, cost constraints, availability of materials, and
so on.
The next example shows how the feasible region of Example 2 changes when
both of the nonnegative conditions are included.
Sketch the feasible region (solution set) determined by the system
x+ y  4
–3x+2y  3
x  0, y  0
Solution
The feasible region of this system is bounded by the lines
x+ y=4
–3x+2y=3
x=0, y=0
Notice that the nonnegative conditions restrict the feasible region to the ﬁrst
quadrant of the plane. As in Example 2, the points (0, 3–2) and (1, 3) are corners, but
the condition y  0 introduces the corners (0, 0) and (4, 0) (see Figure 3–12).

Some systems of inequalities have no solution set, as the following example

Find the solution set (feasible region) of the system
5x+7y  35
3x+4y  12
x  0
y  0
Solution
The inequalities x  0 and y  0 force the solutions to be in the ﬁrst quadrant. The
test point (0, 0) shows that the points that satisfy 5x+7y>35 lie above the line
5x+7y=35 and the points that satisfy 3x+4y<12 lie below the line
3x+4y=12. As shown in Figure 3–13, these two regions do not intersect in the
ﬁrst quadrant. The system then has no solution. We sometimes say that there is no
feasible solution.

Chapter 3
Linear Programming
determines a feasible region, as shown in Figure 3–14. We say the system of in-
equalities has bounded feasible solutions, because the feasible region can be en-
closed in a region where all the points are a ﬁnite distance apart.
On the other hand, a system of inequalities such as
x+3y  9
5x+2y  10
x  0, y  0
with a feasible region as shown in Figure 3–15, has unbounded feasible solutions, be-
cause some of the points in the feasible region are inﬁnitely far apart.
A theater wishes to book a musical group that requires a guarantee of $7000. Ticket
prices are $10 for students and $15 for adults, and the theater’s maximum capacity is
550 seats. State the inequalities that represent this information.
Solution
Let x equal the number of student tickets and let y equal the number of adult tick-
ets. Then the total receipts is represented by 10x+15y, and the inequality
10x+15y  7000 states that total receipts must meet or exceed $7000. The in-
equality x+y  550 states that seating is limited to 550 people. Because a negative
number of tickets makes no sense, the restrictions x  0 and y  0 are also needed.

Graphing a System of Inequalities
1.
Replace each inequality symbol with an equals sign to obtain a linear equation.
2.
Graph each line. Use a solid line if it is a part of the solution. Use a dotted line
if it is not a part of the solution. The line is a part of the solution when  or 
is used. The line is not a part of the solution when 6 or 7 is used.
3.
Select a test point not on the line.
4.
If the test point satisﬁes the original inequality, it is in the correct half plane. If
it does not satisfy the inequality, the other half plane is the correct one.
5.
Shade the correct half plane.

To graph the boundary lines, we write the constraints as equations and put them in the form

y=-x+15
To Set Up the Spreadsheet
We use line 1 of the spreadsheet to identify the contents of the columns. In columns A through D, enter x, y=–3x+30,
y=–7x/4+20, and y=–0.5x+15 to identify the contents of those columns.
In cells A2 through A7, enter the numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. These values of x will be used to plot points on the graph
of each line. When you use zero for a value of x, the graph will show the y-intercept of the boundary lines. Next enter the
formulas:
In B2, enter =-3*A2+30
In C2, enter =-7*A2/4+20
In D2, enter =-.5*A2+15
Then drag each formula down to line 7. The values of y corresponding to each value of x appear for each function.
This gives points used in plotting the graph.

Click on Finish to obtain the graphs of the boundary lines.
The Series 1, 2, and 3 legends shown refer to the three functions in the order they were entered in columns B, C, and D,
respectively.
From the graph we see that the corners of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 15), (10, 0), as well as the point where Se-
ries 2 and 3 intersect and the point where Series 1 and 2 intersect. Here’s how we ﬁnd those points of intersection.
Points of Intersection
The point of intersection of Series 1 and Series 2 is the point where –3x+30=– x+20, or equivalently,
(–3x+30)-(– x+20)=0. We use the second form and Goal Seek to ﬁnd the point of intersection.
•
In cell E2, enter =C2-D2, and in F2, enter =B2-C2. We will use E2 to ﬁnd the intersection of Series 2 and 3, and we
will use F2 to ﬁnd the intersection of Series 1 and 2.
•
Select cell E2.
•
Under Tools in the Tool Bar, select Goal Seek. In the menu that appears, ﬁll the blanks with E2, 0, A2 as shown. The
zero indicates the desired difference in y-values of the two lines, and A2 tells the location of the variable x.
•
Click OK.
You will see that A2 is 4, and C2 and D2 are both 13. Thus, the point of intersection of the two lines is (4, 13).
•
Select cell F2.
•
Under Tools, select Goal Seek. As you did for E2, ﬁll the blanks in the menu that appears with F2, 0, A2.
•
Click OK. Cell A2 shows x=8 and cells B2 and C2 show y=6. Thus, the two lines intersect at the point (8, 6).
We have found the other two corners of the feasible region, so we can list all corners: (0, 0), (0, 15), (4, 13), (8, 6),
and (10, 0). You can use Goal Seek to ﬁnd the x-intercept of a line, say y=– x+20, by entering C2, 0, A2 in the blanks
of the Goal Seek menu that appears. The value of x in A2 is the x-intercept.

Situations 
Constraints and Objective Function
Managers in business and industry often make decisions in an effort to maximize or
minimize some quantity. For example, a plant manager wants to minimize overtime
pay for production workers, a store manager makes an effort to maximize revenue,
and a stockbroker tries to maximize the return on investments. Most of these deci-
sions are complicated by restrictions that limit choices. The plant manager might not
be able to eliminate all overtime and still meet the contract deadline. A store might
be swamped by customers because of its low prices, but the prices might be so low
that the store is losing money.
A successful manager tries to make the right decision or to choose the best de-
cision from several possible decisions. We will look at some simple examples where
linear programming helps a manager make those decisions. First, an example that il-
lustrates the form of a linear programming problem.
An appliance store manager plans to offer a special on washers and dryers. The
storeroom capacity is limited to 50 items. Each washer requires 2 hours to unpack
and set up, and each dryer requires 1 hour. The manager has 80 hours of employee
time available for unpacking and setup. Washers sell for $300 each, and dryers sell
for $200 each. How many of each should the manager order to obtain the maximum
revenue?
Example 1

226
Chapter 3
Linear Programming
Solution
Convert the given information to mathematical statements:
Let
x=the number of washers
y=the number of dryers
The total number to be placed in the storeroom is
x+y
and the total setup time is
2x+1y
Because the manager has space for only 50 items and setup time of 80 hours, we have
the restrictions
x+y  50
2x+y  80
As x and y cannot be negative, we also have
x  0
and
y  0
Because washers sell for $300 and dryers sell for $200, we want to ﬁnd values of x and
y that maximize the total revenue
z=300x+200y
Here is the problem stated in concise form:
Maximize z, where
z=300x+200y
is subject to
x+y  50
2x+y  80
x  0
y  0
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 1,pg.240 ■
We now discuss how you can solve a linear programming problem. In the preceding
example, the inequalities
x+y  50
and
2x+y  80
impose restrictions on the problem, and we call them constraints. The restrictions
x  0, y  0 are nonnegative conditions. We call the function z=300x+200y the
objective function. Find the values of x and y that satisfy the system of constraints
(inequalities) by the methods from the last section. You should obtain the feasible
region as shown in Figure 3–16a. Corner A is (30, 20).
Each point in the feasible region determines a value for the objective function.
We want to ﬁnd the point in the feasible region that maximizes the objective func-
tion. The point (10, 10) gives z=300x+200y the value z=5000, whereas the
point (20, 20) gives the value z=10,000. Because the feasible region contains an
inﬁnite number of points, we will not easily ﬁnd the maximum value of z by a hap-
hazard trial-and-error process.

THEOREM
Optimal Values
Graphical Solution to
Linear Programming
Problem
Geometric Solution
We now state a basic theorem that makes it easier to ﬁnd a maximum or minimum
value of an objective function. The term optimal refers to either maximum or
minimum.
Given a linear objective function subject to linear inequality constraints, if the objective
function has an optimal value (maximum or minimum), it must occur at a corner of the fea-
sible region.
The feasible region in Example 1 has corners (0, 0), (0, 50), (30, 20), and (40, 0).
The value of the objective function in each case is z=0 at (0, 0), z=10,000
at (0, 50), z=13,000 at (30, 20), and z=12,000 at (40, 0). Therefore, by the theo-
rem, the maximum value of z within the feasible region is 13,000, and the minimum
value is 0.
1.
Use each constraint (linear inequality) in turn to sketch the boundary of the
feasible region.
2.
Determine the corners of the feasible region by solving pairs of linear equa-
tions (equations obtained from the constraints).
3.
Evaluate the objective function at each corner.
4.
The largest (smallest) value of the objective function at corners yields the de-
sired maximum (minimum).
Why Optimal Values Occur at Corners
Let’s look at Example 1 in order to understand why optimal values of the objective
function occur at corners. The point (10, 15) lies in the feasible region. (See Fig-
ure 3–16a.) The value of the objective function z=300x+200y at that point is
z=300(10)+200(15)=6000
This value of z can be obtained at other points in the feasible region; in fact,
z=6000 will occur at any point in the feasible region that lies on the line
300x+200y=6000. (See Figure 3–16b.) Furthermore, for any point (x, y) in the
feasible region, one of the following will occur:
300x+200y=6000
300x+200y<6000
or
300x+200y>6000
We have already observed that equality holds for points on the line
300x+200y=6000. The point (0, 0) satisﬁes 300x+200y<6000, so all points
below the line do also. From graphing inequalities we then know that the points in
the half plane above the line 300x+200y=6000 must satisfy
300x+200y>6000
From Figure 3–16b, we observe that the point (20, 20) lies in the feasible region and
lies above 300x+200y=6000, so that point will yield a larger value of the objec-
tive function. It yields z=300(20)+200(20)=10,000. Again, points above the
line 300x+200y=10,000 exist in the feasible region, so there are points in the fea-
sible region that make the objective function greater than 10,000 (See Figure 3–16c).

3.3
Linear Programming:A Geometric Approach
229
When, if ever, will we reach the maximum value of the objective function
z=300x+200y? As we move the line representing the objective function farther
away from the origin, we obtain larger values of the objective function.
As shown in Figure 3–16e, we can move the line completely out of the feasible
region, where points on the line cannot be considered. So, where do we stop moving
the line away from the origin so that it still intersects the feasible region and gives the
largest possible value of the objective function?
Look at Figures 3–16b and 3–16c. As we moved the line through (10, 15) away
from the origin to the point (20, 20), the value of the objective function increased
from 6000 to 10,000. If we continue to move it farther away, we will get larger val-
ues of the objective function. Observe in Figure 3–16d that the farthest we can move 
it and still intersect the feasible region is at the point (30, 20). At (30, 20),
z=300(30)+200(20)=13,000. Thus, the line 300x+200y=13,000 divides
the plane into half planes with all points on the line, giving
300x+200y=13,000
all points above the line, giving
300x+200y>13,000
and all points below the line, giving
300x+200y<13,000
Because all points above the line are outside the feasible region, we cannot consider
them. The only point in the feasible region lying on the line is (30, 20). Thus, (30, 20)
gives the value 13,000 to the objective function, and all other points in the feasible
region give smaller values. The maximum value of the objective function indeed oc-
curs at the corner point (30, 20).
In this example, the feasible region is bounded, because it can be enclosed in a
ﬁnite rectangle. For a bounded feasible region, the objective function will have both
a maximum and a minimum.
In some cases the constraints lead to an inconsistency, so there are no points in
the feasible region—it is empty (see Example 4 of Section 3.2).
When the feasible region is not empty and is bounded, the objective function has both a
maximum and a minimum value, which must occur at corners.
Example 1 and the discussion that follows show a setup of the problem, how it is
solved, and why an optimal solution occurs at a corner. With an understanding of
those ideas, we can solve a problem like Example 1 in a more concise manner, as
shown in the next example.

Unbounded Feasible Region
In applications of linear programming, we generally expect that all coefﬁcients in the
objective function will be positive. In such cases, when we seek optimal values of an
objective function, the value of the objective function tends to increase for points far-
ther from the origin and tends to decrease at points closer to the origin. We observe
that the maximum value of the objective function occurs at the corner point last
touched as we move away from the origin. In an unbounded feasible region similar
to the one shown in Figure 3–18, you can ﬁnd points in the feasible region that are
inﬁnitely far from the origin. Thus, the objective function keeps getting larger for
points farther and farther away, so we say that no maximum value exists. The bound-
aries of this region limit how close a point can be to the origin, so the objective func-
tion takes on its minimum value at a corner point.
In case the objective function has some negative coefﬁcients, the objective func-
tion may or may not have a maximum or minimum in an unbounded region. For ex-

THEOREM
Unbounded
Feasible Region
ample, Figure 3–18 shows that, for z=x-y, any objective function parallel to
(say) x-y=35 will intersect the feasible region and can be made arbitrarily large
for a ﬁxed value of y (such as 4) and for arbitrarily large x. Likewise, the objective
function can be made arbitrarily small for ﬁxed x (such as 5) and arbitrarily large y.
Thus, z=x-y has no maximum or minimum in the feasible region.
When a feasible region with nonnegative conditions is unbounded, an objective funcion 
assumes a minimum at a corner of the feasible region. However, the objective function 
can be arbitrarily large for points in the feasible region, so no optimal maximum solution
exists.
Here is an example of an unbounded feasible region with a minimum solution.
Find the minimum value of z=5x+10y subject to the constraints
3x+2y  60

Solution
The corner points of the feasible region are (0, 30), (16, 6), and (40, 0). (See Fig-
ure 3–18.) The value of z at each of these points is z=300 at (0, 30); z=140 at
(16, 6); and z=200 at (40, 0). Thus, the minimum value of z is 140 and occurs at
(16, 6).

Solution
Two restrictions apply to this problem: the amount of fat intake and the amount of
sodium intake. At the same time, the amount of protein is to be maximized. The so-
lution to the problem involves the following steps:
1.
Identify the variables to be used.
2.
State the restrictions and the quantity to be maximized with mathematical state-
ments
3.
Sketch the graph of given conditions.
4.
Use the graph to ﬁnd the solution.
The quantities that can be varied are the number of servings of soup and
sandwiches.
Let
x=number of servings of sandwiches
y=number of servings of soup
The fat in x servings of sandwiches is 11x and the fat in y servings of soup is 2y,
so the total fat intake is
11x+2y
The inequality
11x+2y  15
states that the fat intake should not exceed 15 g.
The total sodium intake is
275x+875y
and the inequality
275x+875y  700
states that the sodium intake is limited to 700 mg.
The total protein intake is
17x+4y
We call this quantity to be maximized or minimized the objective function, in
this case, z=17x+4y. Because x and y represent numbers of servings, they can
never be negative, so x  0 and y  0.
We can now state this linear programming problem as:
Maximize z=17x+4y, subject to the constraints
11x+
2y  15
275x+875y  700
x  0, y  0
We want to ﬁnd the solutions of this system of inequalities that maximize
z=17x+4y. A graph of the system and its feasible region is shown in Figure 3–20.
We ﬁnd the corner points of the feasible region at the points where pairs of lines
intersect. We ﬁnd them from the following system.

A: (0, 0.800)
B: (1.292, 0.394)
C: (1.364, 0)
D: (0, 0)
The maximum value of z=17x+4y is attained at one of these corners. Examine
each one:
At (0, 0.800):
z=17(0)+4(0.800)=3.200
At (1.292, 0.394):
z=17(1.292)+4(0.394)=23.540
At (1.364, 0):
z=17(1.364)+4(0)=23.188
At (0, 0):
z=0
The maximum value of z=17x+4y occurs when x=1.292 and y=0.394.
This indicates that approximately 1.3 servings of sandwiches and 0.4 serving of soup
will yield the greatest quantity of protein while keeping the fat and sodium intake at
acceptable levels.

Mom’s Old-Fashioned Casseroles produces a luncheon casserole that consists of
50% carbohydrates, 30% protein, and 20% fat. The dinner casserole consists of 75%
carbohydrates, 20% protein, and 5% fat. The luncheon casserole costs $2.00 per
pound and the dinner casserole costs $2.50 per pound. How much of each type of
casserole should be used to provide at least 3 pounds of carbohydrates, 1.50 pounds
of protein, and 0.50 pound of fat at a minimum cost?
Solution
Let x=the number of pounds of the luncheon casserole and y=the number of

A common optimization problem is called the transportation problem. It seeks the
minimum cost of shipping goods from several sources to several destinations. The
next example shows a simple case.
The Garden Center has two stores, one in Clifton and one in Marlin. They sell a pop-
ular garden tractor that is supplied to them from Supplier A and Supplier B. The
shipping costs (in dollars) per tractor from suppliers A and B to the Clifton and Mar-
lin stores are the following:
One spring, the Garden Center ordered 40 tractors for Clifton and 50 for Marlin.
Supplier A had 45 tractors in stock, and Supplier B had 70 tractors in stock. Find the
number of tractors that should be shipped from each supplier to each store to mini-
mize shipping costs.
Solution
Let
x=number of tractors shipped from Supplier A to Clifton
y=number of tractors shipped from Supplier A to Marlin
The balance of the tractors to each store must come from Supplier B, so

Unusual Linear Programming Situations
Multiple Optimal Solutions.
In the preceding example, just one corner point gave
an optimal solution. It is possible for more than one optimal solution to exist. In
other cases, there may be no solution at all. First, look at an example with multiple
solutions.
Find the maximum value of
z=12x+9y
subject to the constraints
4x+3y  36
8x+3y  48

Figure 3–23 shows the feasible region with corners (0, 0), (6, 0), (3, 8), and (0, 12).
The value of z at each corner point is
At (0, 0):
z=0
At (6, 0):
z=72
At (3, 8):
z=108
At (0, 12):
z=108
In this case, the maximum value of z=12x+9y occurs at two corners, (3, 8)
and (0, 12).

Actually, the value of z=12x+9y is 108 for every point on the line segment
between the points (3, 8) and (0, 12). For example, the points (1.5, 10) and (0.75, 11)
lie on the line and
For (1.5, 10):
z=12(1.5)+9(10)=108
For (0.75, 11):
z=12(0.75)+9(11)=108
Generally, when two different points yield a maximum for the objective function, we
say the problem has multiple solutions. (See Figure 3–23.)
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 27,pg.242 ■
When two corners of a feasible region yield maximum solutions to a linear pro-
gramming problem, then all points on the line segment joining those corners also
yield maximum values. Note that the two corners are adjacent.
Multiple solutions allow a number of choices of x and y that yield the same op-
timal value for the objective functions. For example, if x and y represent production
quantities, then management can achieve optimal production with a variety of pro-
duction levels. If problems should occur with one production line, management
might adjust production on the other line and still achieve optimal production.
When just one optimal solution exists, management has no ﬂexibility; there is one
choice of x and y by which management can achieve its objective.
You might wonder how to tell whether there are multiple solutions. It turns out
that this happens when a boundary line has the same slope as the objective function.
(See Exercise 66.)
Unbounded Feasible Region.
The constraints of a linear programming problem
might deﬁne an unbounded feasible region for which the objective function has no
maximum value. In such a case, the problem has no solution. Here is an illustration.

x  0, y  0
Solution
Figure 3–24 shows the feasible region of this system. Observe that the feasible re-
gion extends upward indeﬁnitely. Suppose someone claims that the maximum value
of the objective function is 50. This is equivalent to stating that
2x+5y=50
for points in the feasible region that lie on that line and that no other values of x and
y in the feasible region give larger values. You recognize this as the equation of a
straight line. Figure 3–24 shows that this line crosses the feasible region. Next, ob-
serve that the test point (0, 0) does not satisfy the inequality 2x+5y  50, so the
points in the half plane above the line must satisfy it. Thus, every point in the feasi-
ble region that lies above the line 2x+5y=50 will give a larger value of
the objective function. If we substitute larger values—say, 100, 5000, and so on—in-
stead of 50 in the equation, we essentially determine lines that are parallel to
2x+5y=50 but are farther away from the origin. In each case, points in the feasi-
ble region that lie above the line give an even larger value of 2x+5y. Because the
feasible region extends upward indeﬁnitely, we can never ﬁnd a largest value.
We point out that the objective function z=2x+5y does have a minimum
value at (0, 0). So, an unbounded feasible region does not rule out an optimal solu-
tion. It depends on the region and the kind of optimal solution sought.

programming problem with two constraints that 
are to maximize proﬁt. The proﬁt line shown indi-
cates the slope of the objective function. The cor-

Evaluate the Objective Function
An objective function can be evaluated for a series of corners using TI-83/84 LISTs. You may use up to six lists with names
L1, L2, . . . , L6 and these names appear on the keyboard above the keys for 1, 2, . . . , 6.
You may need to clear lists for use. For example, you can clear lists L1 and L2 with
STAT <EDIT> < 4:CLRLST > ENTER L1 , L2 ENTER
To illustrate the use of lists to evaluate an objective function, we set

Evaluate an Objective Function
We will show how to evaluate an objective function at a series of corner points of a feasible region. We illustrate by using
z=3x1+7x2+ 4x3 for the objective function and the corner points (0, 0, 0), (3, 8, 2), (5, 4, 7), (6, 3, 5), and (10, 6, 4).
Enter the corner points in A2:C6 with the values of x1 in A, the values of x2 in B, and the values of x3 in C. In D2 en-
ter =3A2+7B2+4C2.
Next, drag D2 down to D6 to obtain the values of the objective function listed in D2:D6.

APPLICATIONS
The geometric method of solving linear programming problems works reasonably
well when there are only two variables and a few constraints. In general, linear pro-
gramming problems will likely require dozens of variables, not just two. In those
cases, the geometric method is not practical. We address the method of solving prob-
lems with more than two variables in Chapter 4. The method applies to problems

with a few or a very large number of variables and constraints. The procedure has
the advantage of being a well-deﬁned routine, so problems can be solved with pen-
cil and paper or with computer programs.
Do not be misled by the fact that a solution can be obtained by a routine. A cor-
rect analysis and description of the problem must occur before applying the method.
You may expect an erroneous constraint to yield an erroneous solution. Deﬁning the
problem and identifying the constraints requires the work of a human mind.
In this section, you will concentrate on analyzing and setting up linear program-
ming problems with more than two variables. When you have learned to correctly set
up a problem, the methods of Chapter 4 can be used in a meaningful way.
To prepare you for solving larger systems, we now look at some examples of lin-
ear programming problems with more than two variables. We remind you that we do
not yet have procedures to solve these problems.
Cox Department Store plans a major advertising campaign for its going out of busi-
ness sale. They plan to advertise in the newspaper and on radio and TV. To provide
a balance among the three types of media, they will place no more than 10 ads in
newspaper, at least 15% of the ads will be on TV, and no more than 40% will be on
radio. The budget for this campaign is $30,000. These are the costs and expected au-
dience exposure for the three types of media:
How many ads should be run in each type of media to maximize audience ex-
posure? Find the constraints and objective function that describe this problem.
Solution
The ﬁrst task in setting up a problem is to identify the variables. The term variable
suggests something that can vary. In this case, which items are ﬁxed, and which can
assume different values? The cost per ad is ﬁxed, as well as the audience per each
type of ad. The number of ads, and consequently the total audience exposure, can
vary. In fact, the question “How many ads . . . ?” suggests that we want variables to
represent the number of ads. Because total audience exposure can also vary, we
would expect that to be a variable. However, the number of ads determines total au-
dience exposure. Because exposure depends on ads, we call total audience exposure
a dependent variable. We call the number of ads in this case independent variables.
The ﬁrst step in setting up a problem is to determine the independent vari-
ables—in this case, three variables:
x1=number of ads on the radio
x2=number of ads on TV
x3=number of ads in the newspaper
The dependent variable, audience exposure, is to be maximized, so we let
z=total audience exposure and write it in terms of the number of ads to obtain the
objective function:
z=15,000x1+95,000x2+45,000x3

Chapter 3
Linear Programming
The constraints are inequalities that describe the restrictions imposed. One 
restriction requires that total cost must not exceed $30,000, so we have the cost
constraint
250x1+2200x2+700x3  30,000
Other constraints are
x3  10
(no more than 10 ads are in the paper)
x2  0.15(x1+x2+x3 )
(at least 15% of the ads are on TV)
x1  0.40 (x1+x2+x3 )
(no more than 40% of the ads are on radio)
No variables are negative because we could not place a negative number of ads.
The last two constraints can be written
0.15x1-0.85x2+0.15x3  0
–0.60x1+0.40x2+0.40x3  0
As a linear programming problem, we can state it in the following way:
Maximize z=15,000x1+95,000x2+45,000x3, subject to
0.15x1-0.85x2+0.15x3  0
–0.60x1+0.40x2+0.40x3  0

The next example illustrates how some scheduling problems can be modeled as a lin-
ear programming problem.
Adventure Time offers one-week summer vacations in the Rocky Mountains during
the month of August. The package includes round-trip transportation and a week’s
accommodations at Rocky Mountain Lodge. The Lodge gives a discount to Adven-
ture Time if they rent two- or three-week blocks of condos, giving a rent of $1000 per
condo for a two-week period and $1300 per condo for a three-week period.
Adventure Time expects to need the following number of condos:
How many condos should Adventure Time rent for two weeks, and how many
should be rented for three weeks, to meet the needed number and to minimize Ad-
venture Time’s rental costs? Set this up as a linear programming problem.
Solution
First, we need to determine the possible ways to schedule two- and three-week
blocks in August.

and two possible three-week periods.
We label them x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5 as shown. The xi will also represent the num-
ber of condos rented during that period.
Notice that the 30 condos needed for the ﬁrst week will come from the x1 and x4
groups, and the 42 needed for the second week will come from the x1, x2, x4, and x5
groups. We want to minimize rent, that is,
Minimize
z=1000x1+1000x2+1000x3+1300x4+1300x5
We can summarize the relationship between the number of condos needed and
the ﬁve time periods as follows.

x2=number shipped from Supplier A to Hico
x3=number shipped from Supplier B to Calvert

Notice that we cannot use 80-x1 for the number shipped from supplier B to
Calvert (as we did in Example 7 of Section 3.3) because the exact number shipped
to Calvert is not speciﬁed; it is 80 or more.

Linear Programming:
The Simplex Method
Chapter 3 introduced you to the basic ideas of linear programming. Perhaps
you noticed that most of the examples and problems involved two variables.
In practice, linear programming problems involve dozens of variables. The
graphical method is not practical in problems having more than two variables.
Fortunately,we have a procedure for solving linear programming problems in-
volving several variables, thanks to the mathematician George B. Dantzig.
Dantzig and his colleagues observed and deﬁned the class of linear program-
ming problems and originally had no efﬁcient method for solving them.This
changed in the mid-1940s when Dantzig invented a procedure that became
the workhorse in solving linear programming problems.He called it the sim-
plex method, a procedure for examining corners of a feasible region in an in-
telligent manner that speeds the process of ﬁnding the optimal solution.
Basically,the simplex method moves along a boundary from one vertex to
another,seeking the vertex that gives the optimal solution.When the problem
involves many variables,many boundaries may leave from the current vertex,
and the best route may be difﬁcult to ascertain.Many mathematicians,includ-
ing Dantzig, thought there should be a better search technique. A great 
deal of research focused on developing a better algorithm. Then, in 1984,
a breakthrough came when 28-year-old Narendra Karmarkar announced an
improved method for large-scale problems (those involving thousands of 
variables). His method is considerably more complicated than the simplex
method,so we study only the simplex method.

We now study an algebraic technique that applies to any number of variables and en-
ables us to solve larger linear programming problems. It has the added advantage
of being well suited to a computer, thereby making it possible to avoid tedious 
pencil-and-paper solutions. This technique is called the simplex method.
In practice, a linear programming application of any consequence does not lend
itself to a pencil-and-paper solution. Thus, you will use a computer if you are asked
to solve a real-world problem. You may wonder why the exercises in this chapter are
mainly pencil-and-paper exercises. The reason is that a correct solution to an appli-
cation requires an understanding of the procedure used so that you can set up the
analysis correctly. It helps if you understand the purpose and the restrictions of the
procedure. Consequently, this chapter contains relatively simple linear programming
exercises to give you experience in working through the details of the procedure, as
well as exercises in which you will learn to analyze and set up linear programming
problems.
In Chapter 3 you learned that optimal solutions of a linear programming prob-
lem occur at corners of a feasible region. It may be prohibitively time consuming to
ﬁnd and check every corner of a problem that has dozens of constraints. The simplex
method restricts the search to a relatively small number of corners and provides a se-
quence of corners that yield a more efﬁcient way to reach an optimal solution.
Basically, the linear programming method involves modifying the constraints so
that one has a system of linear equations and then ﬁnding selected solutions of the
system. Remember how we solved a system of linear equations using an augmented
matrix and reducing it with row operations? The simplex method follows a similar
procedure. We introduce the simplex method in several steps, and we refer to the
graphical method to illustrate the steps involved.
Standard Maximum
The following linear programming problem will be referred to several times as we
develop the concepts.
Maximize the objective function
z=4x1+12x2
subject to the constraints
(1)
and the nonnegative conditions
x1  0, x2  0
Notice that we now use the notation x1 and x2 for the variables instead of x and y.
This notation allows us to use several variables without running out of letters for
variables.

Setting Up the Simplex  Method

In this section, we deal only with standard maximum linear programming problems.
They are problems like the illustrative example that have the following properties.
1.
The objective function is to be maximized.
2.
Each constraint is written using the  inequality (excluding the nonnegative
conditions).
3.
The constants in the constraints to the right of  are never negative (180, 100,
and 40 in the example).
4.
The variables are restricted to nonnegative values (nonnegative conditions).
The Geometric Form of the Problem
We now show the graph of the feasible region of the illustrative example to help us
follow the steps of the simplex method. The problem is as follows:
Maximize z=4x1+12x2, subject to
Recall that the boundary to the feasible region is formed by the lines
3x1+ x2=180
x1+2x2=100
–2x1+2x2= 40
x1=0, x2=0
The feasible region is shown in Figure 4 –1.
In the geometric approach, we look at the corners of the feasible region for opti-
mal values. A corner point occurs at the intersection of a pair of boundary lines such as
(52, 24) and (60, 0). Not all pairs of boundary lines intersect at a corner point. Notice
the point (40, 60) is not a corner point; it lies outside the feasible region.
The equation of the boundary lines can give us only points on the boundaries.
To represent points in the interior of the feasible region, we must introduce some
new variables called slack variables. Slack variables allow us to view the problem as
a system of equations.

Linear Programming:The Simplex Method
Slack Variables
The ﬁrst step in the simplex method converts the constraints to linear equations. To
do this, we must introduce additional variables called slack variables. One slack
variable is introduced for each constraint. The ﬁrst constraint, 3x1+x2  180, is
true for pairs of numbers such as x1=10 and x2=20 because 3(10)+20  180.
Observe that 3x1+x2+130=180 when x1=10 and x2=20. When x1=30
and
x2=50,
the
constraint
3x1+x2  180
is
true,
as
is
the
equation
3x1+x2+40=180. In general, when a pair of values for x1 and x2 make the state-
ment 3x1+x2  180 true, there will also be a value of s1 (s1 depends on the values
of x1 and x2) that makes the statement 3x1+x2+s1 = 180 true. In each case, s1 is
not negative. We call s1 a slack variable because it takes up the slack between
3x1+x2 and 180. Whenever s1=0, then x1 and x2 must be coordinates of a point
on the boundary line 3x1+x2=180.
The values x1=10 and x2=20 also make the constraint x1+2x2  100 true,
and also make the equation x1+2x2+50=100 true. When we used these same
values for x1 and x2 in the constraint 3x1+x2  180, we used the value 130 to take
up the slack. We point this out to illustrate that whenever values of x1 and x2 make
two constraints true, then different values of the slack variable may be required to
take up the slack. Thus, one nonnegative slack variable is needed for each constraint.
Let’s look at Figure 4 –2 to illustrate the slack variables’ relationship to the fea-
sible region determined by
that is,
when the constraints are written with slack variables.
Notice that points that lie on the boundary 3x1+x2+s1=180 yield s1=0
[like (40, 60) and (52, 24)], and points that lie on x1+2x2+s2=100 yield s2=0
[like (10, 45) and (52, 24)]. A point that lies in the interior of the feasible region,such
as (10, 20), yields positive values for both s1 and s2. The point (40, 60), which lies

outside the feasible region, yields a negative value for s2. In general, a point outside
the feasible region will yield one or more negative slack variables.
A point (x1, x2, . . . , xn) is in the feasible region of a linear programming problem
if and only if all variables x1, x2, . . . , xn and all slack variables s1, s2, . . . , sk are
nonnegative.
With the addition of slack variables, the constraints (1) in the illustrative example
become
(2)
The last line gives the nonnegative conditions that apply to the variables.
■
You might wonder how this system of equations will help. Here’s how. When non-
negative values of x1, x2, and s1 are chosen to satisfy 3x1+x2+s1=180, then the
point obtained from the values of x1 and x2 will satisfy the constraint 3x1+x2  180.
Furthermore, when x1 and x2 come from an interior point such as (20, 30), for ex-
ample, then the nonnegative values of the slack variables (s1=90, s2=20, and
s3=20, in this case) satisfy the system of equations (2).
In general, the points in the feasible region are determined from the solutions to
a system of equations like (2), provided that we use only those solutions in which all
the variables (x1, x2, s1, s2, s3 in this case) are nonnegative.
Write the following constraints as a system of equations using slack variables:
5x1+ 3x2+17x3  140
7x1+ 2x2+ 4x3  256
3x1+ 9x2+11x3  540
2x1+16x2+ 8x3  99
Solution
Introduce a slack variable for each equation:
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 2,pg.269 ■
The objective function needs to be included in the system of equations because we
want to ﬁnd the value of z that comes from the solution of the above system. Its form
needs to be modiﬁed by writing all terms on the left-hand side. For example,
z=3x1+5x2
5x1 +  3x2 + 17x3 + s1

Let’s pause to make some observations about the systems of equations that we obtain.
1.
One slack variable is introduced for each constraint (four in Example 3 and
three in Example 4).

(number of x’s) plus the number of constraints (number of slack variables) plus

one for z. (The total is 3+4+1=8 in Example 3 and 2+3+1=6 in
Example 4.)
3.
The introduction of slack variables always results in fewer equations than vari-
ables. Recall from the summary in Chapter 2 that this situation generally yields
an inﬁnite number of solutions. In fact, one variable for each equation can be
written in terms of some other variables.
Look back at the system of equations in Example 4. One general form of the so-
lution occurs when we solve for s1, s2, s3, and z in terms of x1 and x2.

The preceding discussion enables us to make the ﬁrst step in solving a linear pro-
gramming problem with the simplex method, setting up the simplex tableau.
Simplex Tableau
The simplex method uses matrices and row operations on matrices to determine an
optimal solution. Let’s use the problem from Example 4 to set up the matrix that we
call the simplex tableau.
Set up the simplex tableau that represents the following problem.

Chapter 4
Linear Programming:The Simplex Method
The line drawn above the bottom row emphasizes that the bottom row is the objec-
tive function.
Set up the initial simplex tableau for the following problem:
Garden Tools, Inc., manufactures three items: hoes, rakes, and shovels. It takes
3 minutes of labor to produce each hoe, 5 minutes of labor to produce each rake, and
4 minutes of labor to produce each shovel. Each hoe costs $2.50 to produce, each
rake costs $3.15, and each shovel costs $3.35. The proﬁt is $3.20 per hoe, $3.35 per
rake, and $4.10 per shovel. If the company has 108,000 minutes of labor and $6800 in
operating funds available per week, how many of each item should it produce to
maximize proﬁt?
Solution
If you are puzzled about which quantities to call variables, ask yourself what quan-
tities are mentioned, which quantities are given and therefore ﬁxed, which quanti-
ties are mentioned and no values given, and, ﬁnally, how are the quantities related?
The problem gives information about three items: hoes, rakes, and shovels. The
minutes of labor and the cost to produce each item are given. The proﬁt for each item
is also given. The available minutes of labor and operating funds are known. These
last two quantities are related to the number of items produced, but those numbers
are not given. In fact, you are asked to ﬁnd the number of each item. Generally, 
the statement of a problem identiﬁes variables by asking something like “How 
many . . .”; in this example, you are asked to ﬁnd how many of each item should be
produced. Thus, the variables represent the number of hoes, rakes, and shovels.
Those are the quantities that can vary, so we let
x1=number of hoes
x2=number of rakes
x3=number of shovels
It often helps to summarize the given information in a chart before writing the
constraints. In this problem, there are three variables and three types of informa-
tion: labor time, cost, and proﬁt. Look at the information and observe that it can be
summarized as follows:
The information on labor requirements, operating costs, and proﬁt can be written as
follows:
(Labor)
(Operating cost)
(Proﬁt)
We introduce slack variables into the constraints to form equations and rewrite
the objective function (proﬁt) as follows:

System of Equations: Many Solutions
In Section 4.1, you learned how to convert a linear programming problem to a sys-
tem of equations using slack variables and then putting the system into a matrix form
called a simplex tableau. The simplex method uses the simplex tableau to ﬁnd the
optimal solution. By the nature of a linear programming problem, the simplex
method involves a system of equations in which the number of variables exceeds the
number of equations. Such a system generally has an inﬁnite number of solutions
where some of the variables can be chosen arbitrarily. We will see that the simplex
method chooses the variables in a way that gives corner points of the feasible region.

274
Chapter 4
Linear Programming:The Simplex Method
Recall that when the solutions of a system are represented by an augmented matrix
such as
x1 x2 x3
x4
then the solutions can be written as
x1=3-2x4
x2=5+ x4
x3=7-4x4
where any value may be assigned to x4, thereby determining values of x1, x2, and
x3. We solve for x1, x2, and x3 in terms of x4 because x1 occurs in only one row. (All
entries in the x1 column are zero except for one entry.) Similarly, x2 and x3 occur only
once. The variable x4 occurs in all rows, so it appears in each equation of the solu-
tion. Observe that the entries in the x1, x2, and x3 columns form a column from an
identity matrix (call these unit columns). The x4 column is not like a column from an
identity matrix. In general, we solve for variables corresponding to unit columns in
terms of variables whose columns are not unit columns. For example, in the aug-
mented matrix
x1 x2
x3
x4 x5
the unit columns are the x2, x4, and x5 columns, so we solve for x2, x4, and x5 in terms
of x1 and x3, giving
x2=–6- x1
(from row 2)
x4= 10-2x1-5x3
(from row 3)
x5= 4-3x1+ x3
(from row 1)
Obtain speciﬁc solutions by assigning arbitrary values to x1 and x3.
We will see how the simplex method selects certain solutions to a system by
assigning zeros to the arbitrary variables.
Basic Solution
The simplex method ﬁnds a sequence of selected solutions to a system of equations.
We make the selections so that we ﬁnd the optimal solution in a relatively small
number of steps.
Let’s look at the illustrative example in Section 4.1 again. It is the following:
Maximize the objective function z=4x1+12x2, subject to the constraints

We introduce slack variables to obtain the following. Maximize z = 4x1+12x2,
subject to
(2)
where x1, x2, s1, s2, and s3 are all nonnegative.
The simplex tableau is
x1
x2
s1 s2
s3 z
Notice that unit columns occur in the s1, s2, and s3 columns. Because the feasi-
ble region is determined by the constraints, for now we will ignore the bottom row
(objective function) and the z column. Thus we can solve for s1, s2, and s3 as
s1=180-3x1- x2
s2=100- x1-2x2
s3= 40+2x1-2x2
We can substitute any values whatever for x1 and x2 to obtain s1, s2, and s3. Those
ﬁve numbers will form a solution to the system of equations. However, only those
nonnegative values of x1 and x2 that also yield nonnegative values for s1, s2, and s3 give
feasible solutions. The simplest choices are x1=0 and x2=0. This gives s1=180,
s2=100, and s3=40. Solutions like this, where the arbitrary variables are set to
zero, are called basic solutions. The number of variables set to zero in this case was
two, which happens to be the number of x’s involved. In general, the number of x’s
determines the number of arbitrary variables set to zero.
We chose zero for the values of x1 and x2, not just for simplicity, but also because
that gives a corner point (0, 0) of the feasible region.
If a linear programming problem has k x’s in the constraints, then a basic solution is ob-
tained by setting k variables (except z) to zero and solving for the others.
Actually, we can ﬁnd a basic solution by setting any two variables to zero and
solving for the others.
If we set s1=0 and s3=0, we can obtain another basic solution by solving for
the other variables from the simplex tableau. If s1=0 and s3=0, the system (2)
reduces to
We have four equations in four unknowns, x1, x2, s2, and z, to solve. This system has
the solution (we omit the details)

Chapter 4
Linear Programming:The Simplex Method
Notice that s2 is negative. This violates the nonnegative conditions on the x’s and
slack variables. Although the solution
x1=40,
x2=60,
s1=0,
s2=–60,
s3=0,
z=880
is a basic solution, it is not feasible.
If you look at Figure 4 –1, you will see that (40, 60) is a point where two bound-
ary lines intersect, but it lies outside the feasible region. Properly carried out, the
simplex method ﬁnds only basic feasible solutions that are corner points of the fea-
sible region.
Call the number of x variables in a linear programming problem k. A basic feasible
solution of the system of equations is a solution with k variables (except z) set to zero and
with none of the slack variables or x’s negative.
The variables set to zero are called nonbasic variables. The others are called basic
variables.
With this background, let’s proceed to solve this example by ﬁnding the appro-
priate basic feasible solution.
Solve by the simplex method:
Maximize z=4x1+12x2, subject to
Step 1.
Begin with the initial tableau:

We ﬁnd the ﬁrst basic feasible solutions. Notice that the unit columns are for
s1, s2, and s3, so we can solve for them in terms of the x’s. Now we can set the x’s to
zero to obtain s1=180, s2=100, and s3=40. (You can read these from the
tableau.) Because this basic feasible solution is the ﬁrst found, we call it the initial
basic feasible solution. It always occurs at the origin of the feasible region.
In this case, the unit columns give s1, s2, and s3 as the basic variables. The non-
basic variables are x1 and x2.

Summary

The Simplex Method

• There is a basic variable for each equation, giving n basic variables. The other k
variables are nonbasic. A unit column determines a basic variable.
• The values of the basic variables are found by setting all nonbasic variables
to zero in each of the equations and then solving for the basic variables.
Pivot Column,Row,and Element
Step 2.
Next we want to modify the tableau so that the new tableau has a basic fea-
sible solution that increases the value of z. This step requires the selection of a pivot
element from the tableau as follows:
(a) To select the column containing the pivot element, do the following. Select the
most negative entry from the bottom row:
x1
x2
s1
s2 s3
z
Most negative entry gives pivot column.
This selects the pivot column containing the pivot element. The pivot element it-
self is an entry in this column above the line. We must now determine which row
contains the pivot element.
(b) To select the row, called the pivot row, containing the pivot element, do the
following. Divide each constant above the line in the last column by the cor-
responding entries in the pivot column. The ratios are written to the right of the
tableau. In this example, all ratios are positive. However, negative or zero ratios
can occur.
(i) If a negative ratio occurs, do not use that row for the pivot row.
(ii) If all ratios are positive (they will be in most cases), select the smallest pos-
itive ratio (20 in this case). The row containing this ratio is the pivot row.
Now look at the ratios on the right of the tableau.

Pivot element
Because all ratios are positive, the smallest, 20, determines the pivot row. The entry
2 in the pivot row and pivot column is the pivot element.

Step 3.
Move to the next basic feasible solution. We call this process pivoting on
the pivot element. In this case we pivot on 2 in row 3, column 2.

Chapter 4
Linear Programming:The Simplex Method
To pivot on 2, use row operations to modify the tableau so that the pivot element
becomes a 1 and the rest of the pivot column contains zeros. (You recognize that this
is part of the Gauss-Jordan Method for solving systems.)
Multiply each entry in the third row (pivot row) by so that the pivot entry be-
comes 1. The third row becomes
[ –1
1
0
0
0
20 ]
giving the tableau

s2 s3

We now need zeros in the circled locations of the pivot column.
We replace each row where a zero is needed by multiplying row 3 by a constant
and adding it to the row to be replaced. Each time, use the constant that gives a zero
in the pivot column. This is accomplished as follows:
Replace row 1 with (row 1-row 3): i.e., 
= [ 4
0

0

Replace row 2 with (row 2+(–2)row 3): i.e., 
= [ 3

Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 17,pg.289 ■
To determine the basic feasible solution from this tableau, observe that the columns
under x2, s1, and s2 are unit columns. These variables are the basic variables, the ones
we solve for. The other two variables, x1 and s3, are nonbasic variables, the ones we
set to zero.
The basic feasible solution from this tableau is
x1=0,
x2=20,
s1=160,
s2=60,
s3=0,
z=240
The initial solution gave z=0, and this solution gives z=240, so we do indeed
have a larger value of the objective function.

Weneedtoknowwhenwehavereachedtheoptimalsolution,themaximumvalue
of z. We can tell when the maximum has been achieved from the simplex tableau.
Step 4.
Is z maximum?
If the last row contains any negative coefﬁcients, z is not maximum. Because 
–16 is a coefﬁcient from the last row, 240 is not the maximum value of z, so we
proceed to move to another basic feasible solution.

Step 5.
Find another basic feasible solution.
Proceed as in Steps 2 and 3 with the most recent tableau:

z
Most negative element—
it is in the pivot column.
The smallest positive ratio determines the pivot row, row 2 in this case, and 3 is the
pivot element.
We now use row operations to obtain a 1 in the pivot element position and zeros
in the rest of the pivot column. We do so by dividing each entry in row 2 by 3 to ob-
tain a new row 2 as shown in the tableau below. We complete the pivot with the in-
dicated row operations.

others. The solution is

Linear Programming:The Simplex Method
The value of z can be increased by going to another tableau only when there is
a negative number in the bottom row. The last tableau, the ﬁnal tableau, has no neg-
ative numbers in the last row, so z=560 is the maximum value of z and occurs at the
point (20, 40).
Ifyoureviewthestepsoftheexamplejustcompleted(andobservethestepsinthe
examples that follow), you will see that the basic variables of the initial tableau con-
sist of the slack variables. Each pivot replaces one of the basic variables with another,
nonbasic, variable. The ultimate goal of the simplex method is to determine the non-
negative x’s that yield the maximum value of the objective function. The sequence of
pivotsbeginswithonlyslackvariablesasbasic,anditbringsinanonbasicvariablewith
each pivot to replace a basic variable until an optimal solution is reached.
Use the simplex method to maximize z=2x1+3x2+2x3, subject to

We ﬁrst write the problem as a system of equations:
The initial simplex tableau is

Because we have three x’s, all basic solutions will have three variables set to zero.
From the initial tableau, the initial basic feasible solution is
x1=0,
x2=0,
x3=0,
s1=13,
s2=8,
z=0
As there are negative entries in the last row, the solution is not optimal.

erations to convert column 2 to a unit column.

Standard Maximization Problem
1.
Convert the problem to a system of equations:
(a) Convert each inequality to an equation by adding a slack variable.
(b) Write the objective function
z=ax1+bx2+. . .+kxn
as
–ax1-bx2-. . .-kxn+z=0
2.
Form the initial simplex tableau from the equations.
3.
Locate the pivot element of the tableau:
(a) Locate the most negative entry in the bottom row. It is in the pivot col-
umn. If there is a tie for most negative, choose either.
(b) Divide each entry in the last column (above the line) by the corre-
sponding entry in the pivot column. Choose the smallest positive ratio. It
is in the pivot row. In case of a tie for pivot row, choose either.
(c) The element where the pivot column and pivot row intersect is the pivot
element.
4.
Modify the simplex tableau by using row operations to obtain a new basic fea-
sible solution.
(a) Divide each entry in the pivot row by the pivot element to obtain a 1 in
the pivot position.
(b) Use the pivot row and row operations to obtain zeros in the other entries
of the pivot column.
5.
Determine whether z has reached its maximum.
(a) If there is a negative entry in the last row of the tableau, z is not maxi-
mum. Repeat the process in steps 3 and 4.
(b) If the bottom row contains no negative entries, z is maximum and the so-
lution is available from the ﬁnal tableau.
6.
Determine the solution from the ﬁnal tableau.
(a) Set k variables to zero, where k is the number of x’s used in the con-
straints. These are the nonbasic variables. They correspond to the col-
umns that contain more than one nonzero entry.
(b) Determine the values of the basic variables. These basic variables corre-
spond to unit columns.
(c) State the maximum value and the values of the original variables that give
the maximum value.
7.
Perhaps you have noticed that the z-column in the simplex tableau never
changes in the pivoting operations. Thus, you may omit that column. If you
do, remember that the number in the last row of the last column is the current
value of z.
The next example illustrates a case where you have a tie for the choice of pivot
column.

same answer. However, one might lead to the answer in fewer steps. You have no way

to the summary of the simplex method. It is possible for a situation to arise where a
ratio used to determine the pivot row is zero. Here is an example where that occurs.
Maximize z=6x+5y, subject to
Solution
The initial tableau is
Ratio
The pivot column is column 1, and the pivot row is either row 1 or row 3 because
the smallest ratio, 10, occurs twice. Let’s use row 1 as the pivot row and see what
happens.
First, we divide each element in row 1 by 3 and then use the row operations
indicated below:
This yields the tableau

Linear Programming:The Simplex Method
The solution is not optimal, so we use column 2 as the next pivot column. We
check the ratios and obtain
The smallest of these is zero, and it came from a ratio with a negative divisor.
According to the summary, we should use the smallest positive ratio, 6, to determine
the pivot row. So we pivot on 3 in row 2, column 2. To do so, we replace row 2 by ﬁrst
dividing each element in row 2 by 3 and then using the indicated row operations,
to obtain the tableau
This solution is optimal with maximum z=78 at (8, 6).
Now let’s go back to the initial tableau and observe what happens if we choose
the other of two possible pivot rows. The initial tableau is
The ﬁrst time we used row 1 as the pivot row. Now we use row 3 as the pivot row. To
pivot on 4 in row 3, column 1, we ﬁrst divide each element in row 3 by 4 and then use
the row operations indicated below:
We obtain
For the next pivot, use column 2 as the pivot column. From it, we have the ratios

To review: When we had two choices for a pivot row, either one led to the same so-
lution. However, one sequence required more steps.
Now we want to show you what happens had we not used the row with a zero for
the pivot row. Look back at the step where the tableau was

with ratios
If we use the smallest positive ratio, 5.54, and pivot on 
in row 2 column 2, we would
obtain the tableau
The negative entry in the last column, 
is not a valid entry; it indicates we
are not in the feasible region. The pivot on 
took us outside the feasible region.
Thus, if a zero ratio ever occurs, you must be careful to pivot correctly, or an invalid
situation may arise.

items: screwdrivers, chisels, and putty knives. It
takes 3 hours of labor per carton to produce screw-
drivers, 4 hours of labor per carton to produce 
chisels, and 5 hours of labor per carton to produce
putty knives. Each carton of screwdrivers costs $15
to produce, each carton of chisels costs $12, and
each carton of putty knives costs $11. The proﬁt per
carton is $5 for screwdrivers, $6 for chisels, and $5
for putty knives. If the company has 2200 hours of
labor and $8500 in operating funds available per
week, how many cartons of each item should it pro-

The ﬁrst pivot column is the second column. The ratios used to determine the pivot row are shown in H2:H4. The for-
mula =F2/B2 is entered in H2 and dragged down to H4 to obtain the ratios.
For reference purposes, we will call a tableau obtained in the sequence the current tableau and the tableau we obtain
by pivoting we call the next tableau. At any stage in the sequence, the formulas used to obtain the next tableau are con-
structed in a similar way.
•
We need only to enter formulas in the ﬁrst column of the next tableau (column A in the example). Drag each for-
mula across the row to column F.
•
Using the initial tableau as the current tableau, we observe the pivot element is in cell B4. The next tableau obtained
by pivoting on B4 is located in A9:F12.
•
The formulas in A9 through A12 are
A9: =A2-$B$2*A11
A10: =A3-$B$3*A11
A11: =A4/$B$4
A12: =A5-$B$5*A11
Now let us look at the pattern.
Note: The $ signs are used to create absolute cell references. Normally, when a formula is dragged from column A to col-
umn F, the cell addresses in the formula change so the formulas correctly refer to the data needed for each cell. In some
cases, cell addresses should remain ﬁxed. In the above, $B$2 means that cell B2 is the multiplier for all cells in the row. In
pivoting, these multipliers always come from the pivot column, so they remain ﬁxed across a row.
As you go through the sequence of tableaux in the simplex method, the next tableau becomes the current tableau,
and a new next tableau is created. The formulas for the new next tableau follow the format above as long as you use the
cells from the new current and next tableaux. The pivot row and column will change, so use the cells from the new pivot
row and column.
Study the sequence of formulas above to make sure you understand their format.

Using the Dual Problem
Standard Minimum Problem
We have used the simplex method to solve standard maximum problems. However,
a variety of optimization problems that are not standard maximum need to be
solved. One form that we consider in this section is the standard minimum, which
can be solved by a procedure called the dual method.
The standard minimum problem can be solved with other techniques, to be dis-
cussed in Section 4.4. Those techniques also provide a means of solving other prob-
lems that are not standard. We include the dual method because it is a commonly
used method.
The dual method converts a standard minimum problem to a standard maximum
problem. Before we show you this method, we deﬁne a standard minimum problem.
A linear programming problem is standard minimum if
1.
The objective function is to be minimized.
2.
All the inequalities are .
3.
The constants to the right of the inequalities are nonnegative.
4.
The variables are restricted to nonnegative values (nonnegative conditions).
Dual Problem
We can solve the standard minimum problem by converting it to a dual maximum
problem. Let’s look at an example to describe how to set up the dual problem.
A doctor speciﬁes that a patient’s diet contain certain minimum amounts of iron and
calcium, but calories are to be held to a minimum.
Two foods, A and B, are used in a meal, and the amounts of iron, calcium, and
calories are given in the following table:
We convert this information into a linear programming form as follows:
Let
x1=the number of units of A
x2=the number of units of B
The iron requirement is
4x1+x2  12

The calcium requirement is
2x1+3x2  10
and the calorie count is
90x1+120x2
where x1  0 and x2  0.
The problem is
Minimize z=90x1+120x2, subject to
Solution
To form the dual problem, we ﬁrst write the minimum problem in a matrix form, us-
ing an augmented matrix of the constraints and objective function. For this example,
the matrix takes the following form. Notice its similarity to the augmented matrix of
a system of equations.
Next, we obtain a new matrix by taking each row of
and making it the column of the new matrix. (The new matrix is called the transpose
of the matrix.) The new matrix is
From the new matrix, B, we set up a standard maximum problem. To do so, we in-
troduce new variables, y1 and y2, because they play a different role from the original
ones. We use the rows above the line to form constraints for the maximum problem.
The row below the line forms the new objective function. Because we want this ma-
trix to give a standard maximum problem, all inequalities are . We write the new
constraints and objective functions next to their rows:
y1
y2
New constraint: 4y1 + 2y2  90
New constraint:  y1 + 3y2  120
New objective function: w = 12y1 + 10y2

Solve the Minimization Problem Using the Dual Problem
The theory relating a standard minimum problem to its dual problem is beyond the
level of this course. The relationship between the solution of a minimum problem
and its dual problem is a fundamental theorem, which we will use.
A standard minimum problem has a solution if and only if its dual problem has a solution.
If a solution exists, the standard minimum problem and its dual problem have the same op-
timal value.
This theorem states that the maximum value of the dual problem objective func-
tion is the minimum value of the objective function for the minimum problem. To
help see this, let’s work through the diet example at the beginning of the section. The
problem and its dual are as follows:
Standard Minimum Problem
Dual Problem
Minimize z=90x1+120x2, subject to
Maximize w=12y1+10y2, subject to
The procedure is straightforward: Solve the dual problem by the simplex
method. We ﬁrst write the dual problem as a system of equations using slack vari-
ables and obtain
Notice that x1 and x2 are used for slack variables. These are intended to be the same
as the variables in the original minimum problem, because it turns out that certain
values of the slack variables of the dual problem give the desired values of the orig-
inal variables in the minimum problem. Let’s set up the simplex tableau and work
through the solution.
The initial tableau is
y1

usual manner. You should ﬁll in details that are omitted.

As no entries of the last row are negative, the solution is optimal, and the maximum
value is 426. The maximum value occurs when
y1=3
and
y2=39
By the fundamental theory of duality, the minimum value of the original objec-
tive function, z=90x1+120x2, is also 426. The values of x1 and x2 that yield this
minimum value are found in the bottom row of the ﬁnal tableau of the dual problem.
That bottom row is

The numbers under x1 and x2 are the values of x1 and x2 that give the optimal value
of the original minimization problem. So the objective function z=90x1+120x2
has the minimum value of 426 at x1=2.6, x2=1.6.
Solve the following minimization problem by the dual problem method:

Examples and Applications
The simplex method has been used to solve standard maximum and standard mini-
mum problems. Although these are important problems, other types of optimization
problems arise.
In this section, we study more general problems. The constraints may be a mix-
ture of , , or=, and we may wish to either maximize or minimize the objective
function. Because such problems contain a mixture of , , or =, they are referred
to as having mixed constraints.
Minimizing a Function
A minimization problem may or may not be standard. In either case, we can make
an adjustment that converts a minimization problem to a maximization problem
whose solution enables us to ﬁnd the solution to the minimization problem.
The adjustment is simple. If z is the objective function to be minimized, then
solve the maximization problem using w=–z as the objective function. This works
because if k is the maximum value of w, then –k is the minimum value of z. For ex-
ample, when you multiply a set of numbers by –1, you reverse the order. The set of
numbers {1, 5, 7, 16} has 1 as the smallest number and 16 as the largest number. The
set made of the negatives of these numbers is {–1, –5, –7, –16}. It has –1 as the
largest number and –16 as the smallest.
Here is an example that illustrates the simplex solution of a minimization
problem.
Minimize z=2x1-3x2, subject to
Solution
Convert the objective function to w=–2x1+3x2. We now seek to maximize
w=–2x1+3x2, subject to the original constraints.

Problems with  or  Constraints
The simplex method assumes all constraints are of the form
a1 x1+a2 x2+. . .+an xn  b
Realistically, some of the constraints can be of the form
a1 x1+a2 x2+. . .+an xn  b
or
a1 x1+a2 x2+. . .+an xn=b
We can use the simplex method by modifying any constraints of these types in
the following way.
We modify a  constraint by multiplying through by –1, which reverses the sign,
giving a  constraint. This may introduce a negative constant in the new con-
straint, but we will describe how to handle that situation later.
We modify an = constraint by replacing it with two constraints, a  and a  con-
straint. We can do this because the statement c=d is equivalent to c  d and
c  d.
For the simplex method:

In the last two examples, the last column contains negative constants. The standard
simplex method assumes nonnegative entries in the last column, so we need to know
how to proceed in such a situation.

Linear Programming:The Simplex Method
Negative Constant in  Constraints
Let’s use a simple example to illustrate the adjustments that enable us to deal with a
negative constant.
Maximize z=20x+50y, subject to
Solution
The graph of the feasible region is shown in Figure 4 –3. Notice that the corners of
the feasible region are 
(24, 0), and (8, 12).
If we set up the initial tableau for this problem in the usual way, we obtain
Generally, the initial basic solution in the simplex method is the origin. That is true
in this case with x1=0, x2=0, s1=72, and s2=–16. However, this solution is not
feasible because s2 is negative. Figure 4 –3 shows that the origin is outside the feasi-
ble region. Because the basic solution is not feasible, we need to adjust the tableau
so that the simplex procedure can be used. We do so by a sequence of pivots that
move us from the origin to a corner point of the feasible region. Here’s how.
In the initial tableau, select the row with a negative constant in the last column
(row 2 because of –16). Next, select another negative entry in that row (–5 in the
ﬁrst column). This entry becomes a pivot element. Divide the entries in the second
row by 5 to obtain the following tableau. Then pivot on the 1 in row 2, column 1,
using the indicated row operations.
After pivoting on 1 in row 2, column 1, we have the following tableau:
This tableau yields the basic feasible solution 
y=0,
and s2=0.
This solution takes us to the point 
which is a corner point of the feasible re-
gion. Because the basic solution is feasible, we can apply the simplex method to this
tableau in the usual manner. The next pivot element is 
in row 1. We multiply the
ﬁrst row by 
to obtain the following matrix. Then perform the indicated row
operations.

We get the tableau
This tableau gives the optimal solution of z=760 at x=8, y=12.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 9,pg.324 ■
Look back over the solution to the problem and observe two phases that generally
apply to problems of this type.
Phase I.
Set up the initial tableau. When a negative constant appears in the right-
most column of the tableau and the basic solution is not feasible, the tableau must
be modiﬁed so that the basic solution is feasible. Do this by selecting a row with a
negative entry in the last column and using another negative entry in that row as a
pivot element. It might be necessary to pivot more than once in Phase I in order to
remove all negative entries in the last column.
Phase II.
When the modiﬁcations in Phase I produce a tableau with feasible basic
solutions, then proceed with the usual simplex method.
Now look back at Figure 4 –3 to see what happened in Phase I. The initial tableau
gives the basic solution with x=0, y=0. In this case, this point (0, 0) lies outside the
feasible region. (That’s why we got an infeasible solution.) When we pivot on –5, the
next basic solution has
y=0 with both slack variables nonnegative. This so-
lution is feasible and represents the corner
of the feasible region. Thus, Phase I
moved from the origin to a corner of the feasible region.
When a feasible solution is reached in Phase I, we enter Phase II and follow the
simplex procedure. In this example, the optimal solution is reached in one more
pivot. Notice that the pivot takes us from the corner 
to the corner (8, 12), the
optimal solution.
Look at another example to be sure that you understand the procedure followed
in Phase I and Phase II.

An investment ﬁrm offers three types of investments to its clients. To help a client
make a better-informed decision, each investment is assigned a risk factor. The risk
factor and expected return of each investment are the following:
Investment A:
12% return per year, risk factor=0.50
Investment B:
15% return per year, risk factor=0.75
Investment C:
9% return per year, risk factor=0.40
A client wishes to invest up to $50,000. He wants an annual return of at least $6300
and at least $10,000 invested in type C investments. How much should be invested in
each type to minimize his total risk? (Note: If $20,000 is invested in A, that risk to-
tals 0.50*20,000=10,000.)
Solution
Let x1=amount invested in A, x2=amount invested in B, and x3=amount in-
vested in C. The total risk is to be minimized, so the objective function is
Minimize z=0.50x1+0.75x2+0.40x3.
The constraints are
(total investment)
(total annual return)
(at least $10,000 in C)
Modify the objective function to a maximum and the  constraints to  and
obtain
Maximize w=–0.50x1-0.75x2-0.40x3, subject to
The sequence of tableaux that lead to the optimal solution follows:

Now pivot on 0.15 in row 2, column 2, by dividing each entry in row 2 by 0.15 to
obtain the tableau below. Then perform the row operations indicated to complete
the pivot.
This gives the tableau
Phase II.
Pivot on in row 1, column 1, by multiplying row 1 by 5 to obtain the fol-
lowing tableau. Then perform the indicated row operations to complete the pivot.
The result is
This tableau gives the optimal solution maximum w=–29,000 when x1=20,000,
x2=20,000, x3=10,000. Therefore, the original problem has the optimal solution
minimum z=29,000 when x1=20,000, x2=20,000, x3=10,000. The minimum
risk occurs when $20,000 is invested in A, $20,000 in B, and $10,000 in C.

The purchasing agent must abide by the following guidelines:
The order must provide at least 3700 items.
The total cost of the order must not exceed $36,000.
The total storage space available is 1420 cubic feet.
The total weight must not exceed 11,400 pounds.
How many of each item should be ordered to maximize proﬁt?
Solution
Let x1=number of items A, x2=number of items B, and x3=number of items
C. The objective function and constraints described by the given information are the
following:
Maximize z=9x1+10x2+5x3 (proﬁt=selling price-cost), subject to
(total number of items)
(total cost)
(storage space)
(total weight)
(nonnegative conditions)
The initial tableau and subsequent tableaux that lead to the optimal solution are as
follows.
The initial tableau is
Phase I.
Because a negative number occurs in the last column, pivot on a 1 in that
row (we use column 3, row 1) by using the operations indicated above. After those
are completed, multiply row 1 by 1 to obtain the following tableau:
Pivot on 2 in row 4 by dividing each entry in row 4 by 2 to obtain the tableau be-
low. Then perform the operations indicated.

We obtain
Phase II.
Column 4 is the pivot column. The ratio 0/1 determines the pivot row, so
the 1 in row 3, column 4, is the pivot element. The row operations indicated by the
preceding tableau perform the pivot and give us the following tableau:
The next pivot element is the 3 in column 2, so we ﬁrst divide row 2 by 3 to obtain the
tableau below. Completing the pivot with the operations indicated,
we obtain the following tableau:
Finally, pivot on 0.2 in column 7 by ﬁrst dividing row 3 by 0.2, which gives the fol-
lowing tableau. Then perform the indicated row operations to complete the pivot.

Form the initial simplex tableau.
5.
If no negative entry appears in the last column of the initial tableau, proceed
to Phase II; otherwise, proceed to Phase I.
6.
(Phase I) If there is a negative entry in the last column, change it to a positive
entry by pivoting in the following manner. (Ignore a negative entry in the ob-
jective function [last row] for this step.)
(a) The pivot row is the row containing the negative entry in the last 
column.
(b) Select a negative entry in the pivot row that is to the left of the last col-
umn. The most negative entry is often a good choice. This entry is the
pivot element.
(c) Reduce the pivot element to 1 and the other entries of the pivot column
to 0 using row operations.
7.
Repeat the parts of step 6 as long as a negative entry occurs in the last col-
umn. When no negative entries remain in the last column (except possibly in
the last row), proceed to Phase II.
8.
(Phase II) The basic solution to the tableau is now feasible. Use the standard
simplex procedure to obtain the optimal solution.
9.
For a minimum problem, be sure to change the sign of the optimal value
obtained.

32. A bricklayers’ union agrees to furnish 50 bricklay-
ers to a shopping mall builder. The bricklayers are
classiﬁed in three categories according to skill: low,
medium, and high. The union requires that the to-
tal number of medium- and high-skilled bricklayers
be at least four times the number of low skilled.
The average number of bricks laid per hour for
each skill level is: low, 40 per hour; medium, 60 per
hour; high, 75 per hour. The builder knows that the
bricklayer crew must lay at least 3100 bricks per
hour to stay on schedule. If the wages per hour are
$10, $15, and $18 for low, medium, and high skills,
respectively, how many of each type should be
hired to minimize total hourly wages?

Generally, a mathematics textbook introduces a new concept or method with exam-
ples and exercises that have nice, neat solutions.
Although well-behaved problems form a valid starting point, texts sometimes
avoid problems that stray from these nice forms. In this chapter on the simplex
method, we have studied the basic method and some variations, but the examples
and problems generally have had unique solutions. That is not always the case.
Reﬂect a moment on the fact that the simplex method converts a linear program-
ming problem to a system of equations. We know that a system of equations can have
a unique solution, no solution, or an inﬁnity of solutions. Thus, with good reason, we
should expect situations to arise when a linear program has no solutions or many so-
lutions. Fortunately, the simplex method can signal when no solutions are possible
or when multiple solutions exist.
Multiple Solutions
We look at a problem with multiple optimal solutions.

This is not optimal, so we pivot on 1 in row 1, column 1, using the operations indi-
cated with the preceding tableau.
x
y
s1
s2
s3
z
This tableau gives an optimal solution z=288 when x=4, y=9. Recall that we
say that x, y, and s3 are basic variables and s1 and s2 are nonbasic variables. Notice
that there is a zero in the bottom row of the s2 column. This zero is the clue that there
might be a different optimal solution.
To determine whether there is another optimal solution, use the s2 column as the
pivot column. The ratios of the entries in the last column are –2, 6, and 4. Because 4
is the smallest nonnegative ratio, row 3 is the pivot row, and 3 in row 3, column 4 is
the pivot element. We pivot by ﬁrst dividing each entry in row 3 by 3 to obtain the
next tableau:
x
y
s1
s2
s3 z
We complete the pivot using the row operations above to give the following tableau:
x
y
s1
s2
s3
z
This tableau gives an optimal solution z=288 when x=12, y=3. Thus, the same
maximum value of z, 288, occurs at another point. The optimal solution occurs at the
corners (4, 9) and (12, 3) of the feasible region. Actually, all points on the line seg-
ment between (4, 9) and (12, 3) also yield the maximum value of z=288.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 5,pg.336 ■
To determine whether a problem has more than one optimal solution:
1.
Find an optimal solution by the usual simplex method.
2.
Look at zeros in the bottom row of the ﬁnal tableau. If a zero appears in the
bottom row of a column for a nonbasic variable, there might be other opti-
mal solutions.
3.
To ﬁnd another optimal solution, if any, use the column of a nonbasic vari-
able with a zero at the bottom as the pivot column. Find the pivot row in the
usual manner, and then pivot on the pivot element.

If this new tableau gives the same optimal value of z at another point, then mul-
tiple solutions exist.
5.
Given the two optimal solutions, all points on the line segment joining 
them are also optimal solutions.
No Solutions
Two conditions give rise to no solution in a linear programming problem. In one
case, an unbounded feasible region exists, so the objective function can be made ar-
bitrarily large by selecting points farther away in the feasible region. In another case,
some constraints are inconsistent, so no feasible region exists. We now ﬁnd out how
to recognize these situations from the simplex tableau.
Unbounded Solutions
The following example illustrates a problem with an unbounded feasible region. In
such a case, the objective function has no maximum value because it can be arbi-
trarily large.
Maximize z=x1+4x2, subject to
Solution
The graph of the feasible region is shown in Figure 4 –7. This problem converts to

Pivot element
Except for the pivot element, convert all entries in the pivot column to 0 to ob-
tain the next tableau:
Because of the –17 in the last row, we know that z is not maximal. When we check
for the pivot row, we get the ratios –7/3 and –1. We cannot proceed with the simplex

Because the feasible region is unbounded (Figure 4 –7), a maximum value of the ob-
jective function does not exist.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 9,pg.337 ■
When you arrive at a simplex tableau that has no positive entries in the pivot col-
umn, the feasible region is unbounded, and the objective function is unbounded.
There is no maximum value.
No Feasible Solution
The following example illustrates what happens in a simplex tableau when the prob-
lem has no feasible solution.
Maximize z=8x1+24x2, subject to
Solution
The graph of the constraints (Figure 4 –8) shows that the half plane below
x1+x2=10 and the half plane above 2x1+3x2=60 do not intersect in the ﬁrst
quadrant, so no feasible solution exists. Let’s attempt to solve the problem with the
simplex method and see what happens.

To remove the negative entry in the last column, we pivot on –3 in row 2, column 2
and obtain the next tableau:
x1 x2 s1

The ﬁrst row indicates no feasible solution. Here’s why. The ﬁrst row represents the
equation x1+s1+
Because x1, s1, and s2 cannot be negative, there are
no values that can be used on the left-hand side that will give a negative number.
Therefore, there is no feasible solution.

When a simplex tableau has a negative entry in the last column and no other en-
tries in that row are negative, then there is no feasible solution to the problem.
A machine shop makes standard and heavy-duty gears. The process requires two
steps. Step 1 takes 8 minutes for the standard gear and 10 minutes for the heavy-duty
gear. Step 2 takes 6 minutes for the standard gear and 10 minutes for the heavy-duty
gear. The company’s labor contract requires that it use at least 200 labor-hours
(12,000 minutes) per week on the step 1 equipment. The maintenance required on
the step 2 machine restricts it to 140 hours per week or less (8400 minutes). The ma-
terials cost $15 for each standard gear and $22 for each heavy-duty gear. How many
of each type of gear should be made each week to minimize material costs?
Show that this problem has no solution.

Because the basic solution is not feasible, we must apply Phase I and pivot on –10
in row 1:
Now pivot on –2 in row 2:
Row 1 has a negative number in the constant column, and all coefﬁcients to the left
of the line are nonnegative. This indicates that there is no feasible region and there-
fore no solution.

WHAT’S HAPPENING IN THE SIMPLEX 
METHOD? (OPTIONAL)
The simplex method can be performed in a rather mechanical manner, thereby mak-
ing it a procedure that can run on a computer. This makes it possible to solve linear
programming problems with hundreds of constraints and variables. As much as we
appreciate a machine handling the routine, tedious computation, the human mind
sometimes becomes curious about what lies behind the computations. In this sec-
tion, we look at the simplex process to better understand why the steps are per-
formed. We outline the steps of the simplex method and explain why we perform
these steps. We use Example 5 from Section 4.1 again.
Maximize z=4x1+12x2, subject to
The graph of the feasible region and the lines forming its boundary is shown in
Figure 4 –9.

We convert the problem to a system of equations by adding a nonnegative slack
variable to each inequality
where x1, x2, s1, s2, and s3 are all nonnegative.

34. Andrea is ordering supplies for summer camp and
notices the supplier has a special offer on four
items on her list: caps, T-shirts, socks, and shoes.
The supplier packaged these items for some special
orders, and a number were returned that the sup-
plier would like to move. There are three types of
packages, I, II, III.
I contains 5 caps, 10 pairs of socks, 2 T-shirts, and 
4 pairs of shoes.
II contains 5 caps, 6 pairs of socks, 3 T-shirts, and 
3 pairs of shoes.
III contains 4 caps, 5 pairs of socks, 6 T-shirts,
and no shoes.
Andrea estimates they will need up to 200
caps, up to 300 pairs of socks, up to 210 T-shirts,
and up to 60 pairs of shoes.
Based on the special price and their published 
camp fees, the camp can make a proﬁt of $6 on 
each package I, $5 on each package II, and $2 on
each package III. How many of each type of pack-
age should Andrea order to achieve maximum
proﬁt?

2.
The simplex method searches for solutions to this system of equations. Each
simplex tableau gives a basic feasible solution. Recall that we set a variable to
zero for each x in the system to obtain a basic solution. The points so obtained
are points where two of the boundary lines of the feasible region intersect.
Look at Figure 4 –9, which illustrates this. Setting a slack variable to zero gives
a boundary line. The boundary lines are
(where s1=0)
(where s2=0)
(where s3=0)
x1-axis:
x2=0
x2-axis:
x1=0
The corner points of the feasible region occur at intersections of boundary lines
and are (0, 0), (0, 20), (20, 40), (52, 24), and (60, 0). Some boundary lines inter-
sect outside the feasible region, such as (40, 60), and give no corner point (see
Figure 4 –9).
We have already seen that all slack variables are nonnegative for points in the
feasible region and that the optimal solution occurs at a corner point.
The simplex method ﬁnds the corner at which the objective function is maxi-
mum in the following manner:
1.
Begin at the origin, (0, 0).
2.
Select a pivot column that tends to increase the value of z the most.
3.
At each step, move along a boundary line to an adjacent corner of the feasible
region.
4.
When z can no longer be increased, the procedure stops.
Now let’s see how these relate to the simplex tableaux. We refer to the tableaux
in Section 4.2 that were obtained in ﬁnding the optimal solution.

which has the basic solution x1=0, x2=0, s1=180, s2=100, s3=40, z=0.
This gives the point (0, 0), the origin.
2.
The choice of the pivot element determines the solution in the next step, and it
increases z as much as possible.
Let’s look at the initial tableau to illustrate this:
x1
x2
s1 s2 s3
z
Let’s see how the choice of the pivot column increases z as much as possible. The
objective function in this problem is
z=4x1+12x2
If values of x1 and x2 are given and if you are allowed to increase either one
of them by a speciﬁed amount—say, 1—which one would you change to in-
crease z the most? The coefﬁcients of x1 and x2 hold the key to your response. If
x1 is increased by 1, then the coefﬁcient 4 causes z to increase by 4. Similarly, an
increase of 1 in x2 causes z to increase by 12. The greatest increase in z is gained
by increasing the variable with the largest positive coefﬁcient, 12 in this case.
In the tableau, z=4x1+12x2 is written as –4x1-12x2+z=0. In this
form, the choice of the most negative coefﬁcient is equivalent to choosing the
variable that will increase z the most. So in the simplex method, the pivot col-
umn is chosen by the most negative entry in the bottom row because this gives
the variable that will tend to increase z the most.
3.
Let’s see how the choice of the pivot row restricts basic solutions to corner
points.
In the initial tableau, the basic solution assumes that both x1 and x2 are zero.
Then the x2 column becomes the pivot column to obtain the next tableau be-
cause that column contains the most negative entry of the last row. Because this
means that we want to increase x2, x1 remains zero. Using x1=0, let’s write
each row of the initial tableau in equation form:
[3
1
1
0
0
0
180]
becomes
x2+s1=180
[1
2
0
1
0
0
100]
becomes
2x2+s2=100
and
[–2
2
0
0
1
0
40]
becomes
2x2+s3=40
(The ﬁrst number in each row doesn’t appear in the equation because it is the
coefﬁcient of x1, which we are using as 0.)
We can write these three equations in the following form:
s1=180- x2
s2=100-2x2
s3= 40-2x2

Chapter 4
Linear Programming:The Simplex Method
Keep in mind that we want to increase x2 to achieve the largest increase in z. The
larger the increase in x2, the more z increases, but be careful: We must remain
in the feasible region. Because s1, s2, and s3 must not be negative, x2 must be cho-
sen to avoid making any one of them negative.
The equations
s1=180- x2
s2=100-2x2
s3= 40-2x2
and the nonnegative condition s1  0, s2  0, and s3  0 indicate that
180- x2  0
100-2x2  0
40-2x2  0
must all be true. Solving each of these inequalities for x2 gives
In order for all three of the ratios to be larger than x2, the smallest ratio must be
larger. Thus, for all three of s1, s2, and s3 to be nonnegative, the smallest value of
x2, 20, must be used. The ratios
are exactly the ratios that are used in the simplex method to determine the pivot
row. These ratios are also the x2-coordinates where the boundary lines cross the
x2-axis. By the nature of the feasible region, the lowest point is the one in the fea-
sible region. The selection of the smallest nonnegative ratio makes a basic solu-
tion a feasible basic solution; that is, a corner point is chosen.
4.
Recall that the maximum value of z occurs when the last row of the simplex
tableau contains no negative entries. The ﬁnal tableau of this problem was
x1 x2 s1
s2
s3
z
This tableau tells us that s2 and s3 are set to zero (their columns are not unit
columns) in the optimal solution; and as the last row contains no negative en-
tries, we know that we cannot increase z further. Here’s why: Write the last row
of this tableau in equation form. It is

which can be written as
This form tells us that if we use any positive number for s2 or s3, we will subtract
something from 560, thereby making z smaller. So we stop because another
tableau will move us to another corner point, and s2 or s3 will become positive
and therefore reduce z.
Let’s compare this situation with the next to last tableau. Its last row was
[–16
0
0
0
6
1
240]
This row represents the equation
–16x1+6s3+z=240
which may be written
z=240+16x1-6s3
If x1 is increased from 0 to a positive number, then a positive quantity will
be added to z, thereby increasing it. If you look back at this step in the solution,
you will ﬁnd that x1 was increased from 0 to 10.
The value of z can be increased as long as there is a negative entry in the last
row. It can be increased no further when no entry is negative.
5.
Reviewing the steps of this example, we observe that the sequence of simplex
tableaux and the corner points determined are the following:
Initial tableau:
Corner (0, 0) z=0, slack (180, 100, 40).
Tableau 1:
Corner (0, 20) z=240, slack (160, 60, 0).
Tableau 2:
Corner (20, 40) z=560, slack (80, 0, 0).
Notice that the initial corner point is the origin, (0, 0). The ﬁrst pivot moves
to (0, 20), which is a corner adjacent to (0, 0). The second pivot moves to
(20, 40), which is a corner adjacent to (0, 20). A pivot in the simplex method
moves from the current corner to an adjacent corner (see Figure 4 –10).

Chapter 4
Linear Programming:The Simplex Method
On the basis of the preceding discussion, the simplex method can be summa-
rized this way:
The simplex method maximizes the objective function by computing the objective
function at selected corner points of the feasible region until the optimal solution
is reached. The method begins at the origin and moves at each stage to an adja-
cent corner point determined by the variable that yields the largest increase in z.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
•
Changes in the Objective Function
•
Resource Changes
In the linear programming examples and exercises we have used throughout this
chapter, we have tacitly assumed the quantities, costs, and other data are accurately
known. In practice, those quantities and costs are often estimates or subject to
change. Thus, this question arises: “If some of the data change, how will that affect
the optimal solution?” A study of the consequences of changes in data is called 
sensitivity analysis. Such an analysis can become complicated, but we look at two
simpler situations: (a) when changes occur in the objective function, and (b) when
changes occur in the resources available.
We use the following elementary example to illustrate the analysis.
Electronic Design makes two electronic control devices for an equipment manufac-
turer, the Primary Control and the Auxiliary Control. These controls require two
types of circuit boards, the C-8 board and the H-2 board. The Primary Control re-
quires 5 C-8 boards and 1 H-2 board. The Auxiliary Control requires 4 C-8 boards
and 2 H-2 boards. The company expects to make a $16 proﬁt on the Primary Control
devices and a $24 proﬁt on the Auxiliary Control devices. The company has 88 C-8
and 32 H-2 boards. How many of each control boards should be made to maximize
proﬁt?
Solution
Let’s set up the constraints and objective function.
Let x=number of Primary Control devices
y=number of Auxiliary Control devices
Maximize z=16x+24y, subject to
(number of C-8 boards)
(number of H-2 boards)
 x  0, y  0
 x + 2y  32
 5x + 4y  88
Example 1
Notice that this nonstandard procedure increased 
z by 340 the ﬁrst pivot and found the optimal 
solution with the second pivot, whereas the stan-
dard procedure increased z by 100 the ﬁrst pivot
and required four pivots to ﬁnd the optimal 
solution.
Recall that the standard simplex procedure 
is designed to give the maximum increase in z at
each pivot. Explain why that is not the case in this
example.
21. In Exercises 49 through 51 of Section 4.2, you
solved problems that had two choices for the pivot
row at some step. These gave a zero ratio for the
pivot row. Review those exercises with attention to
the feasible region and the sequence of corner
points followed. Recall that where a slack variable
is zero, it indicates that corner point lies on the line
that corresponds to that slack variable. Recall that
a pivot of a tableau moves along a boundary line

Figure 4 –11 shows the corners of the feasible region.
The corners and the corresponding values of the objective function are the following:
The maximum proﬁt is $416, with 8 Primary Control and 12 Auxiliary Control de-
vices made.
At its maximum, the objective function gives 16x+24y=416, a line through
(8, 12) as shown in Figure 4 –12.
The fact that the line 16x+24y=416 lies between the lines 5x+4y=88
and x+2y=32 is signiﬁcant. In fact, for the objective function to attain its maxi-
mum value at (8, 12), it must lie between the boundary lines that intersect at (8, 12).
■
Changes in the Objective Function
In Figure 4 –13, we show three other lines, L1, L2, and L3, that pass through (8, 12)
but have different slopes from the objective function.
Because the maximum value of the objective function must occur at a corner
point, for our example, it must be at (8, 12), (0, 16), or (17.6, 0).

Sensitivity Analysis

In the case where the proﬁt on a device changes, we could get a line with a slope
similar to L1, L2, or L3. Recall that the objective function increases in value as it moves
away from the origin. It reaches its maximum value at the last corner point it touches
as it moves out. Notice that the point (8, 12) is the last corner L1 touches as it moves
away from the origin, so (8, 12) is the point of maximum value for any line that lies be-
tween 5x+4y=88 and x+2y=32. Also observe that L2 can move farther away
from the origin and still cross the feasible region. The corner (0, 16) is the last corner
touched by L2, so the maximum value of the L2 objective function occurs at (0, 16).
Likewise, L3 can move farther out until it touches the corner (17.6, 0), which is
the point that makes the L3 objective function maximum.
The discussion of Figure 4 –13 can help to answer questions such as “What proﬁt
values can we have for each device so the point (8, 12) remains the point of
maximum proﬁt?” and “What proﬁt values for each device will cause the point of
maximum proﬁt to move to (0, 16) or to (17.6, 0)?” The next three examples show
how to answer these questions.
The problem
Maximize z=16x+24y, subject to
(number of C-8 boards)
(number of H-2 boards)
has the solution
Maximum z=416 at (8, 12)
How much change can occur in a device proﬁt, such that the point (8, 12) still yields
the maximum proﬁt?
Solution
We use the slopes of the boundary lines 5x+4y=88 and x+2y=32 and the
slope of an arbitrary objective function, z=Ax+By, to ﬁnd the answer. Because
the objective function with slope –A/B through (8, 12) must lie between the lines
5x+4y=88 (slope
) and x+2y=32 (slope
), the slope of the
objective function must lie between the slopes of the boundary lines; that is,
which we can write as
Thus, the proﬁts of the devices whose ratio lies between 0.5 and 1.25 will yield a max-
imum total proﬁt at (8, 12). For example, device proﬁts of A=18 and B=24 give
, giving a total maximum proﬁt at (8, 12).

For the problem of Example 2, determine the device proﬁts that will cause the max-
imum total proﬁt to move to (0, 16).

Chapter 4
Linear Programming:The Simplex Method
Solution
For the objective function z=Ax+By to be maximum at the point (0, 16), it must
pass through (0, 16) and lie above x+2y=32, like the dotted line labeled L1 in
Figure 4 –14.
Because the slopes are negative and line L1 is more nearly horizontal than
x+2y=32, the slope of line L1 is nearer to zero than the slope – . We indicate
this by
and conclude that z=Ax+By has its maximum value at (0, 16) when
One such example is z=10x+24y.

For the problem of Example 2, determine the device proﬁts that will cause the max-
imum total proﬁt to move to (17.6, 0).
Solution
For the objective function z=Ax+By to be maximum at the point (17.6, 0), it
must pass through (17.6, 0) and lie above 5x+4y=88, like the dotted line labeled
L2 in Figure 4 –14. Because the slopes are negative and line L2 is more nearly verti-
cal than 5x+4y=88, the slope of line L2 is farther from zero than the slope 
.
We indicate this by
and conclude that z=Ax+By has its maximum value at (17.6, 0) when
which is equivalent to A  1.25B. One such example is z=25x+14y.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 7,pg.355 ■
Let’s continue the analysis of Example 2 to see the effect a change in the objective
function has on the point of maximum proﬁt. Recall that the proﬁt on each Primary
Control is $16 and the proﬁt on each Auxiliary Control is $24, so the objective func-
tion is z=16x+24y, and it attains its maximum value at (8, 12).

Suppose the manager of Electronic Design is conﬁdent that the proﬁt of each
Auxiliary Control is $24, but the proﬁt of each Primary Control may differ from $16.
How much can it differ and (8, 12) remain the optimal point? We use the objective
function z=Ax+24y and ﬁnd the value of A for which (8, 12) gives the maximum
value of z. As B=24, we have
Multiply each term by 24 to obtain
12  A  30
The proﬁt on each Primary Control device can vary from $12 to $30, and (8, 12) re-
mains the optimal point.

Let’s look at the situation when the proﬁt for each Primary Control, $16, is consid-
ered accurate, but the proﬁt for each Auxiliary Control might differ from $24. As
A=16, we have
We can take the reciprocal of each term and reverse the inequality signs to obtain

Linear Programming:The Simplex Method
Solution
Figure 4 –15 shows the feasible region and corner points resulting from the change
in available H-2 boards.
The corners are (0, 0), (0, 19), (4, 17), and (17.6, 0). The corresponding values
of z are the following:
The maximum proﬁt is $472 and occurs when 4 Primary Control and 17 Auxiliary
Control devices are made. When 6 H-2 boards were added, proﬁts increased by $56.
We observe that the maximum value of z still occurs at the corner formed by the in-
tersection of the two constraints. This will not always happen. If the number of avail-
able H-2 boards increases enough—say, to 48—we have the situation shown by
Figure 4 –16. The constraint lines intersect outside the ﬁrst quadrant, so the con-
straint x+2y=48 can be ignored because the constraint 5x+4y=88 com-
pletely determines the feasible region.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 15,pg.357 ■
So we ask, “How does a change in the available number of H-2 boards affect maxi-
mum proﬁt when the constraint lines still intersect in the ﬁrst quadrant?”
We answer the question by looking at a more general form of the H-2 constraint
in the next example.

Our modern economy depends on borrowed money.If you have a credit card
or a student loan,you have ﬁrsthand experience with a loan.Borrowed money
enables students to obtain an education or to own an automobile.Few fami-
lies can own a home without borrowing money. Business depends on bor-
rowed money for day-to-day operations and major expansions.Governments
at all levels,schools,churches,and other institutions borrow money.Banks de-
pend on loans for a major source of their income. Our economy would col-
lapse if ﬁnancial institutions quit making loans.
Here are some trivia questions for you:“What is the current national debt?”
“When was the last time the federal government balanced its budget?”“When
was the last time there was no national debt?”
“Rented money”describes “borrowed money”because a fee is paid for the
use of money for a period of time.Just as you pay a rental fee for the use of an
apartment for a semester,you pay a rental fee,or interest as it is called,for the
use of money.
Even those few who may not borrow money may place money in a sav-
ings account or a certiﬁcate of deposit. In doing so, that person loans money
to the bank, and the bank pays interest. In turn, the bank loans the money to
an individual or business (at a higher rate,of course).
Some day in the distant future,you hope to retire with adequate funds to
enjoy a reasonable quality of life.To do so,you,your employer,or both need to
invest in a retirement plan that will pay you an annuity in your retirement
years. An analysis of investments and annuities shows that the earlier you in-
vest for retirement,the more likely you will have adequate retirement income.
We now look at some methods used to determine the fee charged for the
use of money.

Simple Interest
Simple interest is most often used for loans of shorter duration, in situations like 
a construction company that may be expecting payment in a week for work done, 
but it is payday and the workers are due their checks so the company borrows 
money for a week, or a store may obtain a 30-day loan to purchase an inventory for 
a sale.
How does a simple interest loan work? First, let’s mention some standard terms
used when discussing simple interest. The money borrowed in a loan is called the
principal. The number of dollars received by the borrower is the present value. In a
simple interest loan, the principal and the present value are the same. The fee for 
a simple interest loan is usually expressed as a percentage of the principal and is
called the interest rate. If the interest rate is 10% per year, then each year the bor-
rower pays 10% of the principal, the amount borrowed. If the interest rate is 1.5%
per month, then the borrower pays 1.5% of the principal for each month the money
is borrowed. You should be aware that the formulas in this chapter require that the
interest rate be written in decimal form, not in percent. For example, 7.5% must be
written as 0.075.
We denote the amount of the principal by P. If the interest rate is 10% per year,
then the interest paid is 0.10P for each year of the loan. Thus, if the money is bor-
rowed for three years, the total interest paid is 3(0.10P).
This suggests the general formula that gives the total fee, interest, which is paid
for a simple interest loan.
I=Prt
where
P=principal (amount borrowed)
r=interest rate per year (expressed in decimal form)
t=time in years
I=interest paid
An interest rate may be stated as 10% per year, 1% per month, or in terms of
other time units. Sometimes no time units are speciﬁed. In such cases it is under-
stood that the time unit is years. A statement that the interest rate is 12% should
be interpreted as 12% per year. The time period will be stated when it is not an-
nual. Simple interest is paid on the principal borrowed and is not paid on interest
already earned.

Compute the interest paid on a loan of $1400 at a 9% interest rate for 18 months.
Solution
P=$1400
r=9%= 0.09 in decimal form
t=18 months
years=1.5 years
I=1400*0.09*1.5=189
So, the interest paid is $189.

An individual borrows $300 for 6 months at 1% simple interest per month. How
much interest is paid?
Solution
Notice that the interest rate is given as 1% per month. We can still use the I=Prt
formula, provided that r and t are consistent in time units—in this case, months.
I=300*0.01*6=$18
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 11,pg.369 ■
Jose borrows money at 8% for 2 years. He paid $124 interest. How much did he
borrow?
Solution
In this case, I=124, r=0.08, and t=2, so
124=P(0.08)(2)=0.16P
P=
=775
The loan was $775.

Jane borrowed $950 for 15 months. The interest was $83.13. Find the interest rate.

So, the interest rate was 7% per year.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 18,pg.369 ■

Future Value
A loan made at simple interest requires that the borrower pay back the sum borrowed
(principal) plus the interest. This total, P+I, is called the future value, or amount, of
the loan. Because I=Prt, we can write the future value as A=P+Prt.
A=P+I
=P+Prt
=P(1+rt)
where
P=principal, or present value
r=annual interest rate
t=time in years
A=amount, or future value
Find the amount (future value) of a $2400 loan for 9 months at 11% interest rate.
Solution
We want to ﬁnd A in A=P+I=P+Prt. We know that P=2400, r=0.11,
and 
years, so
I=2400(0.11)(0.75)=198
and
A=2400+198=2598
We can also use the formula A=P(1+rt) and compute A as
A=2400(1+0.11(0.75))
=2400(1+0.0825)
=2400(1.0825)
=2598
The total of principal and interest is $2598.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 22,pg.369 ■
Up to this point, the examples have dealt with the cost (interest) of a loan. In order
for a person to obtain a loan, another party must provide the money to be borrowed.
That party invests money and is interested in the income received from the loan. The
same formulas apply to the investor as to the borrower.
How much should you invest at 12% for 21 months to have $3000 at the end of the
21 months?
Solution
In this example, you are given the future value, $3000, and are asked to ﬁnd the present
value, P. We know that r=0.12, t= =1.75 years, and A=3000. Then,
3000=P(1+0.12(1.75))
=P(1+0.21)
=1.21P
So,
=$2479.34 (rounded to nearest cent).

4 months. (The future value is $550.) Your friend needs the money now, so you agree
to pay him $525 for the note, and the debtor will pay you $550 in 4 months. What an-
nual interest rate will you earn?
Solution
For the purposes of this problem, A=550, P=525, and t=4 months= year.
Using the formula A=P+Prt, we have
You will earn about 14.3% annual interest.

Treasury Bills—Simple Discount
Treasury bills are short-term securities issued by the federal government. The bills
do not specify a rate of interest. They are sold at weekly public auctions with ﬁnan-
cial institutions making competitive bids. For example, a bank may bid $978,300 for
a 90-day $1 million treasury bill. At the end of 90 days, the bank receives $1 million,
which covers the cost of the bill and interest earned on the bill. This is basically what
we call a simple discount transaction.
The simple discount loan differs from the simple interest loan in that the inter-
est is deducted from the principal and the borrower receives less than the principal.
For example, if a person borrows $1000 at 6% for 1 year, the interest is $60, which is
deducted from the $1000, and the borrower receives $940. When the loan is repaid,
the borrower pays $1000. We use the terminology simple discount note for this type
of loan. The interest deducted is the discount, the amount received by the borrower
is the proceeds, the discount rate is the percentage used, and the amount repaid is
the maturity value. Here’s how they are related.
D=Mdt
PR=M-D
=M-Mdt
=M(1-dt)
where
M=maturity value (principal)
d=annual discount rate, written in decimal form
t=time in years
D=discount
PR=proceeds, the amount the borrower receives

Find the discount and the amount a borrower receives (proceeds) on a $1500 simple
discount loan at 8% discount rate for 1.5 years.
Solution
In this case, M=1500, d=0.08, and t=1.5 years. Then,
D=1500(0.08)(1.5)
=180
PR=1500-180
=1320
So, the bank keeps the discount, $180, and the borrower receives $1320.

A bank wants to earn 7.5% simple discount interest on a 90-day $1 million treasury
bill. How much should it bid?
Solution
We are given the maturity value, M=1,000,000, the discount rate, d=0.075,
and the time, 
(Banks often use 360 days per year when computing daily 
interest.)
Note: The practice of using 360 days for a year began before computers and cal-
culators: dividing by 360 is easier than dividing by 365. It is also consistent with using
30 days for a month.
We want to ﬁnd the proceeds, PR. Putting our given values into the simple dis-
count formula, we get
So, the bank should bid $981,250.

Compound Interest
When you deposit money into a savings account, the bank will pay for the use of your
money. Normally, the bank pays interest at speciﬁed periods of time, such as every
three months. Unless instructed otherwise, the bank credits your account with the
interest, and for the next time period, the bank pays interest on the new total. This
is called compound interest. Let’s look at a simple example.
You put $1000 into an account that pays 8% annual interest. The bank will compute
interest and add it to your account at the end of each year. This is called compound-
ing interest annually. Here’s how your account builds up. We use the formula
A=P(1+rt), where r=0.08 and t=1.
So, at the end of 5 years, the account has grown to $1469.33.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 8,pg.380 ■
Notice how the pattern of growth involves powers of 1.08. The amount at the end of
1 year is just 1.08 times the amount at the end of the preceding year. Thus, the amount
at the end of 4 years is 1.08 times the amount at the end of 3 years, the amount at the
end of 5 years is 1.08 times the amount at the end of 4 years; or for longer periods of
time, the amount at the end of 17 years is 1.08 times the amount at the end of 16 years,
and so on. A more helpful form gives the amount after, say, 5 years in terms of the
original investment and 1.08. Notice the amount after 5 years is 1000(1.08)5.
This follows because multiplying 1000 by 1.08 to obtain the amount for the ﬁrst
year, multiplying the ﬁrst year total by 1.08 to obtain the amount for the second year,
and so on for 5 years is equivalent to multiplying the original investment by 1.08 ﬁve
times. You may expect, quite correctly, that the amount after 10 years is equal to
1000(1.08)10.
In general, we have the following formula for interest compounded annually.
When P dollars are invested at an annual interest rate r and the interest is com-
pounded annually, the amount A at the end of t years is
A=P(1+r)t

Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 10,pg.380 ■
In the preceding examples, interest was compounded annually. Interest is often cal-
culated and added to the principal at other regular intervals. The most common in-
tervals are semiannually, quarterly, monthly, and daily.
What do we mean by compounding semiannually, quarterly, and so on? It means
that at the end of a ﬁxed time period, interest is calculated and added to the account.
Here is a summary of common compound interest intervals.
Note: In Section 5.1, 360 days were used for a year. With the availability of cal-
culators, 365 days is more accurate and just as easy to use.
We use the quarterly interest rate when interest is compounded quarterly, the
monthly interest rate for monthly compounding, and so on.
Because interest rates are usually stated as an annual rate, we need to convert to
the appropriate periodic interest rate. We do this by dividing the annual rate by the
number of interest periods in a year. An 8% annual rate becomes 8%/4=2% quar-
terly rate and a 6% annual rate becomes 6%/12=0.5% monthly rate.
Generally, we will use the letter r to represent the annual rate and the letter i to
represent the periodic rate.
Given the annual interest rate, r, with interest compounded m times a year, the pe-
riodic interest rate, i, is
Let’s repeat Example 1 but compound the interest quarterly.
$1000 is invested at 8% annual rate. The interest is compounded quarterly. Find the
amount in the account at the end of 5 years.
Solution
Because interest is compounded quarterly, it must be computed every three months
and added to the principal. The quarterly interest rate is 2%, so the computations are
the following:

At this stage we have the amount at the end of 1 year. We will not continue for an-
other 16 computations, but observe the pattern. At the end of ten quarters, we cor-
rectly expect the amount to be A=1000(1.02)10. At the end of 5 years, 20 quarters,
the amount is
A=1000(1.02)20=1000(1.48595)=1485.95
Notice that compounding quarterly gives an amount of $1485.95, a larger amount
than the amount $1469.33 obtained from compounding annually.

The general formula for ﬁnding the amount after a speciﬁed number of compound
periods is the following.
A=P(1+i)n

A department store charges 1% per month on the unpaid balance of a charge ac-
count. This means that 1% of the bill is added to the account each month it is unpaid.
This makes it compound interest. A customer owes $135.00, and the bill is unpaid for
4 months. What is the amount of the bill at the end of 4 months?
Solution
The interest rate is 1% per month and is compounded monthly. The value of i is then
0.01, and the number of periods is 4. The amount of the bill is
A=135(1.01)4
=135(1.04060)
=140.48
Notice that i and n were given in this example, so they can be substituted directly
into the formula.

Money invested at compound interest grows faster for shorter compound periods.
Table 5–2 shows how $1000 grows over 10 years at 7.2% interest with different com-
pounding periods. Notice that the future value increases with more frequent
compounding.
Although the future value increases with more frequent compounding, it in-
creases more slowly. In fact, even with more frequent compounding such as each
hour, minute, or second, the future value will never exceed $2054.44.
Present Value
We use the term present value to designate the principal that must be invested now
to accumulate an amount at a speciﬁed time in the future.

How much should Josh invest at 8%, compounded quarterly, so that he will have
$5000 at the end of 7 years?
Solution
In this case, we are given A=5000, r=0.08, m=4, and t=7. Then, 
and n=4(7)=28. Using the compound interest formula, we have
5000=P(1.02)28
=1.74102P
Solve the equation for P:
Josh should invest $2871.87 to have $5000 in 7 years. In other words, the present
value of $5000 due in 7 years is $2871.87.

Doubling an Investment
An investor wishes to know how fast an investment will grow. One measure is the
time it takes for an investment to double in value.
An investor has visions of doubling her money in 6 years. What interest rate is re-
quired for her to do so if the investment draws interest compounded quarterly?
Solution
P dollars are invested in order to have 2P dollars in 6 years. The future value for-
mula for interest compounded quarterly becomes
2P=P(1+i)24
where we wish to ﬁnd i. We do not need to know the value of P because we can di-
vide both sides by P and have 2=(1+i)24.
You can solve this by taking the 24th root of both sides of the equation
2=(1+i)24
to get
21/24=1+i
to four decimal places, 21/24=1.0293, or i=2.93% per quarter or 11.72%
annual rate.

Effective Rate
For a given annual rate, a more frequent compounding of interest gives a larger value
of an investment at the end of the year. A 10% annual rate, compounded monthly,
gives a larger amount at the end of the year than does 10%, compounded semiannu-
ally. However, a lower rate, compounded more frequently, may or may not give a

larger return. For example, which yields the better return, 9% compounded semian-
nually or 8.8% compounded quarterly? To answer this, let’s assume that $1000 is in-
vested in each case and compute the amount at the end of 1 year.
1.
r=9% is compounded semiannually. Let P=1000, t=1 year, m=2, and 
Then,
A=1000(1.045)2=1000(1.09203)
=1092.03
2.
r=8.8% is compounded quarterly. Let P=1000, t=1 year, m=4, and 
Then,
A=1000(1.022)4
=1000(1.090947)=1090.95
Thus, 9% compounded semiannually is a slightly better investment.
Another way to put different rates and frequency of compounding on a compa-
rable basis is to ﬁnd the effective rate. The effective rate is the percentage increase
of an investment in 1 year—that is, the simple interest rate that gives the same an-
nual increase as the compound rate. If an investment increases by 5.9%, for example,
the effective rate is 5.9%.
The effective rate of an annual interest rate r compounded m times per year is the simple
interest rate that produces the same total value of investment per year as the compound 
interest.
Here’s how we ﬁnd the effective rate.
Find the effective rate of 8% compounded quarterly.
Solution
If we invest P dollars, the amount of the investment at the end of the year is
A=P(1.02)4
If we invest the same amount, P, at a simple interest rate, r, the amount of the
investment at the end of the year is A=P+Pr(1).
Now r is the unknown simple interest rate that gives the same amount A as does
compound interest, so
P+Pr=P(1.02)4
We can divide throughout by P to get
1+r=(1.02)4
and so
r=(1.02)4-1
=1.08243-1
(rounded)
=0.08243
In percentage form, r=8.243% is the effective rate of 8% compounded quarterly.

Zero-Coupon Bonds
An investor can purchase a zero-coupon bond for an amount less than the maturity
value, paying (say) $9,000 for a bond that has a maturity value of $10,000. At matu-
rity, the investor receives $10,000. The bond pays no interest, but the difference,
$10,000-$9,000=$1,000, can be considered interest that accumulates and is paid
at maturity.
Erwin plans to buy a 10-year zero-coupon bond with a maturity value of $10,000.
How much should he pay to get a return of 5.6% compounded quarterly?
Solution
We use the compound interest formula A=P(1+I)n, where A=10,000,
I=0.056/4=0.014, and n=40.
10,000=P(1.014)

(ii) Every 5 years, at ages 25, 30, 35, . . . 65,
this person invests $5000. How many times
must these investments be made in order
to have $1 million at age 70?
(iii) How much should be invested at age 25 to
have $1 million at age 70?
(b) The results of part (a) suggest it is not easy to
accumulate $1 million with ﬁxed-income in-
vestments. Over a long period of time, an in-
vestment in stocks will generally yield greater
returns than a ﬁxed-income investment even
though the value of stocks will ﬂuctuate. Let’s
look at investments of $5000 into a stock mu-
tual fund that averages 10% growth per year.
(i) At age 25, a person invests $5000 into a
mutual fund that averages 10% growth
compounded annually. Find the estimated
value at age 65. At age 70.
(ii) Every 5 years, at ages 25, 30, 35, . . . 65,
this person invests $5000. How many times
must these investments be made to have 
$1 million at age 70?
(iii) Beginning at age 25, this person invests
$5000 each year into a mutual fund that
averages 10% growth compounded annu-
ally. How many such investments must be
made to accumulate $1 million by age 70?
(iv) How much should be invested at age 25 at
10% compounded annually to have $1 mil-
lion at age 70?
(c) In part (b), the growth was compounded annu-
ally. Let’s compare the results of part (b) with
the case in which the 10% annual growth is
compounded quarterly.
(i) At age 25, a person invests $5000 into a
mutual fund that averages 10% annual
growth compounded quarterly. Find the
estimated value at age 65. At age 70.
(ii) Every 5 years, at ages 25, 30, 35, p 60, this
person invests $5000. How many times
must these investments be made to accu-
mulate $1 million by age 70?
(iii) Beginning at age 25, this person invests
$5000 each year into a mutual fund that
averages 10% annual growth compounded
quarterly. How many such investments
must be made to accumulate $1 million by

(iv) How much should be invested at age 25 to
have $1 million by age 70?
(d) Based on this exercise, write a paragraph on
the effect of increased interest rates, early in-
vestments, and more frequent compounding
on the growth of an investment.

Based on the graph, which is the better invest-
ment, 8.5% compounded annually or 8% com-

83. In 1790, Benjamin Franklin left $4600 to the city of

88. If you invest $1000 at 8% compounded quarterly,
how long will it take to double your investment?
This question is equivalent to: Find n where

The doubling time can be found by using

Making a Table
In Section 1.1, we illustrated how to make a table of values of a function for several values of x. We can make tables of a
period-by-period amounts of an investment in a similar way. A built-in table has a column for a list of values of the variable
x, and columns for y1, y2, . . . that contain the values of y calculated from the corresponding formulas in the 
menu.
We illustrate by making a year-by-year table for two investments, both investing $1000 at 5% interest for 10 years.
For the ﬁrst investment, the interest is compounded annually, and the second draws simple interest.
Brieﬂy, here’s how.
•
Press 
to display the TABLE SETUP screen.
•
Enter 0 for TblStart and press 
.
•
Enter 1 for Tbl and press 
.
•
Select the Auto option for Indpnt and press 
.
(This sequence will enter 0, 1, 2, . . . in x. To enter 0, 2, 4, . . . use 2 for Tbl)
•
Select Auto for Depend and press 
.
To calculate the values of compound interest in y1 and simple interest in y2:
•
Select 
and enter 1000(1.05)^x as the y1 function,
•
To calculate the simple interest amounts, enter 1000(1+.05x) for the y2 function.
•
Press 
to view the tables.
•
You may also graph the two functions by setting the Window to 0 –20 for the x-range and 0 –2000 for the y-range and
press 
.
Using Intersect
We can use the intersect command (see Section 1.3) to determine, for example, when an investment of $700 doubles in
value if it is invested at 4.4% compounded quarterly. Do so by plotting the two functions y1=700(1.011)x and y2=1400,
and then selecting the intersect command.

Using EXCEL
We will show how to graph functions using EXCEL. Let’s illustrate by graphing the amount of compound interest and the
amount of simple interest. We use an initial investment of $1000, interest of 7%, for a period of 20 years. The compound
interest investment is compounded annually. Thus, we graph the equations
Compound interest: A=1000(1.07)x where x ranges from 0 to 20.
Simple interest: A=1000(1+0.07x) where x ranges from 0 to 20.
Excel makes a graph by plotting points on the graph and connecting them with a smooth curve. This means we com-
pute a list of points to be used by Excel. Here’s how:
•
In column A, list values of x to be used. We use 0, 2, 4, . . . , 20, listed in A2:A12.
•
Note: We could use 0, 1, 2 . . . , 20 or some other spacing for x.
•
In column B, calculate the amount of compound interest corresponding to the number of periods, x. We use
=1000*(1.07)^A2 in B2 and drag the formula down to B12.
•
In column C, we calculate the amounts of simple interest using =1000*(1+.07*A2) in C2 and dragging the formula
down to C12.
We now use these points to graph both functions on the same graph.
•
Select the Wizard icon from the Menu Bar.
•
Select XY(Scatter) for Chart type:
•
Click on the ﬁrst option of the second column (Two curves) under Chart sub-type:
•
Click Next
•
Select the cells A2:C12 for Data range.
•
Click Finish
In case you want to adjust the x-scale or y-scale, double-click on the scale to be adjusted, make the changes in the dialog
box that appears, and click on OK. The Series 1 and Series 2 legends that appear with the graph refer to the function
deﬁned in column B (for Series 1), and to the function deﬁned in Column C (for Series 2).
We can use Goal Seek to determine when an investment reaches a certain value, doubles in value, increases 60%, and so
forth. Let’s illustrate with the following. $1500 is invested at 4.8% compounded quarterly. How long will it take for it to
reach $2000 in value? We let x=the required number of quarters, i=0.012, and A=1500(1.012)x. We enter zero for
x in A2, and =1500*(1.012)^A2, in B2.

ANNUITIES AND SINKING FUNDS

Ordinary Annuity
Most of us have encountered or will encounter debt several times. You may now have a
student loan or owe some credit card charges. You may be looking forward to life after
graduation when you can begin a good job or upgrade your present job. Early in your
career, you may experience a struggle to pay off a student loan, to make payments on a
car, and to keep up the monthly payments on your dream house. Then there might be a
time when you decide to invest money periodically into a fund to provide a college ed-
ucation for your children. Later in your career, you will focus more on your retirement
and the income you might expect during that time.
These ﬁnancial activities have a common characteristic, that of periodic pay-
ments. Car and house loans have periodic payments, usually monthly, of a speciﬁed
amount that is to be paid until the loan is paid off. A college fund receives periodic
payments to accumulate an amount for use at a future date. A retiree receives
monthly payments from a retirement fund.
A series of equal periodic payments like these is an example of what we call an
annuity. Whether the payments are used to pay off a loan, build a college fund, or
provide retirement income, equal payments paid at equal time intervals form an
annuity.
We use some standard terminology when discussing annuities. We call the time
between successive payments the payment period and the amount of each payment
the periodic payment. The interest on an annuity is compound interest. The pay-
ments may be made annually, semiannually, quarterly, or at any speciﬁed time inter-
val. Monthly payments are common. The annuity may take on different forms, but
we will study just one form, the ordinary annuity. Furthermore, we assume the pay-
ment period and the interest compounding period are the same.

5.3
Annuities and Sinking Funds
389
An ordinary annuity is an annuity with periodic payments made at the end of each
payment period.
We ﬁrst look at annuities in which payments are invested to build up a fund
for future use.
A family enters a savings plan whereby they will invest $1000 at the end of each year
for 5 years. The annuity will pay 7% interest, compounded annually. Find the value
of the annuity at the end of the 5 years.
Solution
Because $1000 is deposited each year, the ﬁrst deposit will draw interest longer than
subsequent deposits. The value of each deposit at the end of 5 years is the original
$1000 plus the compound interest for the time it draws interest. Use the formula for
the amount at compound interest. Here is a summary of how payments of $1000 de-
posited at the end of each year grow over a 5-year period. The interest rate, r=0.07,
is compounded annually.
You obtain the ﬁnal value by adding the ﬁve payments and the interest accumulated
on each one. The ﬁnal value is called the amount, or future value, of the annuity.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 1,pg.393 ■
Let’s use this simple example to observe some general relationships. In the example,
ﬁve payments are made, and the accumulated value is obtained by adding ﬁve
amounts, the ﬁrst of which is 1000(1.07)4 and the last is 1000, the annual payment. If
$1000 were deposited for 10 years, a similar pattern holds with ten amounts, the ﬁrst
being 1000(1.07)9 and the last 1000. In general, the ﬁrst amount has an exponent on
1.07 that is one less than the number of payments. The total accumulated value of
ﬁve payments is
1000+1000(1.07)+1000(1.07)2+1000(1.07)3+1000(1.07)4
In a like manner, the total of ten payments is
1000+1000(1.07)+1000(1.07)2+. . .+1000(1.07)9
where the terms are written in reverse order. In general, the sum of the values of n
payments is
A=1000+1000(1.07)+1000(0.07)2+. . .+1000(1.07)n – 1

Ordinary Annuity
Note
Payments could be
made at times other
than the end of a 
payment period.This
would result in a dif-
ferent analysis and a
different formula.If a
person wishes to make
ﬁve periodic payments
beginning now,the
formulas for ordinary
annuities hold by de-
claring that the end 
of the ﬁrst year has
arrived when the ﬁrst
payment is made,and
the last payment is
then at the end of the 
ﬁfth year.
Note
For other interest 
rates and amounts of
periodic payments,
use that interest rate
instead of 0.07 and 
the amount invested
instead of 1000.You
will obtain a similar
expression for the
total,A.

Chapter 5
Mathematics of Finance
Clearly, computing the total value (future value) of an annuity can be tedious
for a number of payments. Let’s examine a way to avoid a period-by-period compu-
tation by using the 5-year future value in Example 1. The sum of the ﬁve terms is
A=1000+1000(1.07)+1000(1.07)2+1000(1.07)3+1000(1.07)4
Now multiply both sides of this equation by 1.07 to obtain
A(1.07)=1000(1.07)+1000(1.07)2+1000(1.07)3+1000(1.07)4+1000(1.07)5
We subtract the ﬁrst equation from this to obtain
A(1.07)-A=1000(1.07)+1000(1.07)2+1000(1.07)3+1000(1.07)4
± 1000(1.07)5-1000-1000(1.07)-1000(1.07)2
– 1000(1.07)3-1000(1.07)4
and obtain the form
A(1.07)-A=–1000+1000(1.07)5
From this we get
Check this computation to verify that it gives the same total as in Example 1,
$5750.74. Notice in the ﬁnal result that 1000 represents the periodic payment, 1.07 is
1 plus the periodic interest rate, the exponent 5 is the number of time periods, and
the denominator 0.07 is the periodic interest rate.
We would like a formula that computes the future value for any amount for 
the periodic payment—say, R—for any periodic interest rate—say, i—and any
number of periods—say, n. If we follow the steps above using R, i, and n instead
of 1000, 0.7, and 5, we will end up with a similar formula giving the value of the
amount accumulated, or future value. The general form of the formula is the
following.
(Payments are made at the end of each period)
where
i=interest rate per period
n=number of periods
R=amount of each periodic payment
A=future value or amount
The next example gives you an idea how an annuity grows over time.
Tiffany invests $1000 at the end of each year into an ordinary annuity that pays 6%
compounded annually. Figure 5–2 and Table 5–3 show how the annuity grows year
by year for 15 years.

Using Table 5–3, notice the growth over 5-year periods. In the ﬁrst 5 years, a to-
tal of $5000 was invested and grew to a value of $5637, a gain of $637 over the amount
invested. During the sixth through tenth year, a total of $5000 was invested, and 
the value of the investment grew to $13,181—a gain of $7544, of which $2544 was 
interest earned. The last 5 years a total of $5000 was invested, and the value of the
investment increased to $23,276—a gain of $10,095, of which $5095 was interest
earned. This acceleration in the increase in value occurs because more money be-
comes available to earn interest. The compounding effect of interest contributes
greatly to the growth. This illustrates that regular investment over a long period of
time is a smart way to invest.
Figure 5–2 shows how the total value of the investment increases with time rel-
ative to the amount invested.
We need not compute a period-by-period table like Table 5–3 to ﬁnd the value
at some future date. We use the future value formula as illustrated in the next
example.
How much money will you have when you retire if you save $20 each month from
graduation until retirement? We need some deﬁnite numbers to answer this ques-
tion, so let’s assume you start saving at age 22 until age 65, 43 years, and the interest
rate averages 6.6% annual rate compounded monthly.
Solution
Because the payments are made monthly, the periodic rate=0.066/12=0.0055,
the number of periods is n=12(43)=516, and the periodic payments are R=20.
We substitute these values into the future value formula

Sinking Funds
There are times when a company or an individual expects to need a speciﬁed amount
at a time in the future. For example, a company may expect to replace a machine
costing $150,000 in 6 years, a family expects to need a new car in 4 years, or new par-
ents wish to accumulate $150,000 for their child’s college expenses in 18 years. In
cases like this when an amount of money will be needed at some future date, the
company or person can systematically accumulate a fund that will build to the de-
sired amount at the time needed. We call such a fund a sinking fund.
Susie wants to deposit her savings at the end of every three months so that she will
have $7500 available in four years. The account will pay 8% interest per annum, com-
pounded quarterly. How much should she deposit every quarter?
Solution
Susie is accumulating a sinking fund with a future value of $7500, periodic rate
i=0.08/4=0.02, and n=16 periods. Use the formula for the future value of an
annuity,
to ﬁnd the periodic payments, R:
Susie should deposit $402.38 every quarter to accumulate the desired $7500.

A=65,000, i=0.07, and n=10, so
The annual payment is $4704.54.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 18,pg.394 ■
A sinking fund problem is a variation of an annuity problem. The growth of an an-
nuity can generally be described as “I can save $25 a month. How much will I have
after 5 years?” The sinking fund problem is like “I will need $15,000 in ﬁve years to
buy a new car. How much should I save each month to have the amount I need?” In
the growth of an annuity, the amount of the periodic payment is known, and the fu-
ture value is sought. In the sinking fund problem, the future value is known, and the
periodic payments that will accrue to that value are sought.

Present Value
Let’s look at some variations of the ordinary annuity. We have studied the result of ac-
cumulatingequalpaymentsmadeatregularintervalswiththeobjecttoprovideafund
at a future date. Now we want to look at two variations of this problem.
1.
How much should be put into a savings account in one lump sum at compound in-
terest so that the amount accumulated at the end of 5 years equals the amount ac-
cumulated by an annuity, say investing $25 each month for 5 years?
The lump sum payment that yields the same total amount as that obtained
through equal periodic payments made over the same period of time is called
the present value of the annuity.
2.
An example of a second variation is the problem of ﬁnding the monthly pay-
ments that will pay off a 4-year car loan.
A similar problem seeks to ﬁnd the amount that grandparents should place in
a college fund to provide, say $5000 each year, to help with a grandchild’s college
expenses. We note that $20,000 is not required to provide $5000 each year for
four years, because a part of the $5000 annual payment is the interest earned on
the balance of the fund available.
Solve the ﬁrst problem, ﬁnding the present value of an annuity, as follows. Recall
that the amount of an annuity is
and the amount of compound interest is
A=P(1+i)n
where i is the periodic interest rate, n is the number of periods, R is the periodic pay-
ment for the annuity, and P is the lump sum invested at compound interest. We want
to ﬁnd P so that the amount of compound interest equals the amount of the annuity;
that is
P(1 + i)n = Rc
(1 + i)n - 1

A = Rc

Solving for P gives
When we divide the numerator and denominator by (1+i)n, we obtain the equiva-
lent form
We have obtained two equivalent formulas for present value of an annuity.
where
i=periodic rate
n=number of periods
R=periodic payments
P=present value of the annuity
You might ask which form should be used to ﬁnd present value
Either form is acceptable. The second form has the advantage that it uses fewer steps
to evaluate it, but be sure you use a negative n for the exponent. You will see both
forms used in examples.

Another form of periodic equal payments occurs when an established fund pays out
money periodically. For example, a college student’s grandparents established a fund
to pay $5000 each semester to help pay the student’s education expenses. This “an-
nuity in reverse” does not require a fund that is 8 times $5000 for eight semesters of
payments, because the money in the fund draws interest. Let’s see how much money
is needed to make equal periodic payments for a speciﬁed number of times with no
money left when the last payment is made.
To analyze this kind of problem, we use a simpler example from which we draw
a general formula: What amount of money is required to make payments of $100
each month for 4 months? The fund draws 12% annual interest and is compounded
monthly.
Let’s think of the money needed as divided into four parts that we label A1 for
the investment that will grow to the amount needed to make the ﬁrst payment, A2
for the investment that will grow to the amount needed for the second payment, and
A3 and A4 likewise for the third and fourth payments. These investments are not
equal because A4, for example, draws interest longer than the other investments, so
it can be smaller. The total A1+A2+A3+A4 is the amount needed initially.
At the beginning of the plan, the amount A1 is needed to enable a payment of
$100 at the end of one month. Because the monthly interest rate is 1%, A1 will draw
interest for one month and will be worth 1.01A1 when the payment is made. Thus,
The amount A2 in the original investment will draw interest for two months be-
fore it makes the second payment, so
Likewise,

Thus, this type of problem does not require a new formula. We can call the
amount needed in the fund at the beginning the present value of an annuity.
Find the present value of an annuity (lump sum investment) that will pay $1000 per
quarter for 4 years. The annual interest rate is 10%, compounded quarterly.
Solution
R=1000, 
and n=16 quarters.
A lump sum investment of $13,055 will provide $1000 per quarter for 4 years.

Amortization
We now analyze the problem of paying a debt with equal periodic payments. A stan-
dard method of paying off a car or house loan requires that the borrower pay equal
monthly payments until the debt is paid. This is called amortization. Each monthly
payment pays all of the interest charged for that month and repays a part of the loan.
Because the loan is reduced each month, the interest decreases a little each month,
and the amount repaid increases by the same amount.
To illustrate the process, we use a simpliﬁed example of a $10,000 car loan with
equal payments at the end of each year for 4 years. The interest rate is 8%. We let R
represent the annual payments.
To ﬁnd the annual payments, we will ﬁnd the amount still owed, the balance, at
the end of each year. The following observations are helpful.
Observation 1.
The original amount of the loan is $10,000.
Observation 2.
As the end of the ﬁrst year approaches, the amount owed in-
creases from $10,000 to $10,800, because 8% interest, 0.08($10,000)=$800, is now
to be paid.
Observation 3.
The balance owed, $10,800, is reduced by the payment R. Clearly,
R must be greater than $800 so that all of the interest and some of the loan are paid.
Observation 4.
First year:
We can summarize the ﬁrst year balance as
Balance=10,000+800-R
which can also be written as
Balance=10,000+0.08(10,000)-R
and as
Balance=10,000(1.08)-R

Balance=10,000(1.08)-R+0.08 [ 10,000(1.08)-R ] -R
= [ 10,000(1.08)-R ] (1.08)-R

Observation 6.
The balances for the third and fourth year are
Third year:
Balance=second year’s balance+interest-R
=10,000(1.08)2-1.08R-R+[10,000(1.08)2-1.08R-R] (0.08)-R
=[10,000(1.08)2-1.08R-R](1.08)-R
=10,000(1.08)3-(1.08)2R-1.08R-R
Fourth year:
Balance=[10,000(1.08)3-(1.08)2R-1.08R-R](1.08)-R
=10,000(1.08)4-(1.08)3R-(1.08)2R-1.08R-R
=10,000(1.08)4-R[(1.08)3+(1.08)2+1.08+1 ]
We now ﬁnd the sum in the second term above:
S=(1.08)3+(1.08)2+(1.08)+1
It will help in more general cases if we ﬁnd this sum in the following way. First, write
1.08S as follows:
1.08S=(1.08)4+(1.08)3+(1.08)2+1.08
Then,
We can now write the fourth year’s balance as
This is an example of the general formula for the balance of a loan. The general
form is

ods, and R=periodic payments.

Now we are ready to ﬁnd R, the annual payment. Because the loan is to be re-

The annual payments are $3019.21.

This relationship between the amount of a loan and the periodic payments holds
when payments are made monthly, quarterly, or any other time period provided that
the interest rate and number of periods are also monthly rates and number of
months, and so on.
We have gone to some effort to show the following:
The amortization of a debt (repayment of a debt) requires no new formula be-
cause the amount borrowed is just the present value of an annuity.

Amortization of a Loan
The amount borrowed, P, is related to the periodic payments, R, by the formula
where
i=periodic interest rate
and
n=number of payments
(Note: This is the present value formula for an ordinary annuity.)
An employee borrows $8000 from the company credit union to purchase a car. The
interest rate is 12%, compounded monthly, with payments every month. The em-
ployee wants to pay off the loan in 3 years. (The loan is amortized over 3 years.) How
much are the monthly payments?
Solution
Here we have P=$8000,
n=36 months. Substituting into the
present value formula, we have
Solving for R, we have
The monthly payments are $265.71 each.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 13,pg.411 ■
In general, when we solve for R in the present value formula, we have the amortiza-
tion payment formula.
You should be aware that the amount of the periodic payment may involve a
fraction of a cent. In that case the bank rounds up to the next cent. Consequently,
the ﬁnal payment may be a little less than the other payments.
A student obtained a 24-month loan on a car. The monthly payments are $395.42 and
are based on a 12% interest rate. What was the amount borrowed?
Solution
The amount borrowed is just the present value of the annuity. We then have

We can gain other information related to amortization as illustrated in following
examples.
A family borrowed $60,000 to buy a house. The loan was for 30 years at 12% inter-
est rate. The monthly payments were $617.17.
(a) How much of the ﬁrst month’s payment was interest and how much was
principal?
(b) What total amount did the family pay over the 30 years?
Solution
(a) The monthly interest rate was 1%=0.01, so the ﬁrst month’s interest was
60,000(0.01)=600.00. The family paid $600 interest the ﬁrst month. The rest of
the payment, $17.17, went to repay part of the principal.
(b) The family paid $617.17 each month for 360 months, so the total amount paid
was 617.17(360)=$222,181.20. You may be surprised at this ﬁgure, but it is
true. Notice that the total amount paid for interest was
$222,181.20-60,000=$162,181.20

rounded to the nearest penny.

ments. Actually, we found a formula for the balance early in the discussion of amor-
tization. It is
Notice that the balance after n periods is
(amount of compound interest)-(amount of an annuity)
where
P=the amount borrowed
i=periodic interest rate
n=number of time periods elapsed
R=monthly payments
What is the balance of the loan in Example 6 after two years?
Solution
In Example 6,
P=60,000
i=1%=0.01 per month
R=617.17
n=24 months
(The balance after 24 months is desired)
To ﬁnd the balance after two years, substitute these values in the Balance of an
Amortization formula above.
So the balance owed after two years is $59,536.87. The part of the loan repaid is the
equity:
Equity=loan-balance
In this case, the equity after two years is
Equity=60,000-59,536.87=$463.13
The results of these computations might seem wrong. Hardly any principal is re-
paid each month. In two years, the 24 payments total $14,812.08, but only $463.41 of
the $60,000 loan has been repaid. However, the amount repaid increases a little each
month (about 18¢; see the amortization table for this loan on p. 408). Although an
18¢ per month increase hardly seems worthwhile, it eventually becomes a signiﬁcant

Now let’s look at a situation that combines the future value and present value of an
annuity.
The parents of a baby want to provide for the child’s college education. How much
should be deposited on each of the child’s ﬁrst 17 birthdays to be able to withdraw
$10,000 on each of the next four birthdays? Assume an interest rate of 8%.
Solution
First, compute the amount that must be in the account on the child’s 17th birthday
to withdraw $10,000 per year for 4 years. This is the present value of an annuity,
where
P is to be found
i=0.08
n=4
R=10,000
So, substituting in the present value formula
we have
the total necessary on the 17th birthday.
Next, ﬁnd the annual payments that will yield a future value of $33,121.27 in 17
years at 8% using the formula for the future value of an annuity
Given this formula, we have:

Annual Percentage Rate, APR
We have discussed the amortization of a loan where the
monthly interest is based on the unpaid balance of the
loan. A lender might give a simple interest loan where
the interest is calculated on the original principal and
spread evenly over the life of the loan, as illustrated in
the following example.
Harlan borrows $2000 for 2 years and the
lender gives him a “good deal,” 4% interest.
Because 4% simple interest for 2 years is $160,
Harlan is to repay a total of $2160 in 24 equal pay-
ments, which he repays at $90 per month.

Harlan pays 4% on the $2000 for the entire 2
years, though he repays some of the principal each
month. So he pays the same dollar amount for in-
terest the second year as he does the ﬁrst year, but
he owes less for the second year. Thus, he really
pays more than 4% on what he owes.
What interest rate does Harlan pay if it is com-
puted as interest on the unpaid balance?
Here’s how we solve the problem. We want to
ﬁnd the interest rate that will amortize a loan of
$2000 in 24 monthly payments of $90. We use the
amortization formula
with P=2000, R=90, and n=24:
We cannot solve for i directly using algebra, but we
can solve by using the intersection of two graphs.
Find the intersection of the graphs
and y=2000
This occurs at x=0.0062507 for the monthly rate.
The annual interest rate is 12(0.0062507)=
0.0750084, which we can round to 7.5%.
In EXCEL, use Goal Seek to ﬁnd the value of
x for which
reaches 2000.
Federal law now requires that lenders quote
APR (annual percentage rate) interest rates—the
interest rate used to amortize a loan, with interest
paid on the unpaid balance. In the example above,
the APR rate is 7.5%.
Use the method in the above example to solve Exercises
81 through 87.
81. Vicki borrows $2500 for 18 months and repays the
loan with $150 monthly payments. Find the APR.
82. Elsie borrows $1200 for 1 year and repays the loan
with monthly payments of $103. Find the APR.
83. The Maxey family purchases dining room furniture
for $1800. The store allows them to pay for it in 12
monthly payments of $161.25, for a total cost of
$1935. The clerk stated they were paying 7.5% inter-
est. Mrs. Maxey disagreed, stating that would be cor-
rect if they made a single payment of $1935 at the

Using Your TI-83/84
Monthly Loan Payments
To see how much of a monthly loan payment goes to interest and how much goes to reduce the loan, we have a TI-83/84 pro-
gram that shows this and the balance of the loan as well. It requires that you enter the amount of the loan, the annual inter-
est rate, and the number of years. It assumes monthly payments. The program is named AMLN.

Sets and 
Counting
An understanding of set theory is basic to understanding logic, enumeration
problems, and probability. Through the centuries, set theory evolved slowly
as an area of logic and mathematics. Although a number of mathematicians
contributed to the development of set theory, an Englishman, George Boole,
extended and formalized the area into an algebra that developed a well-
deﬁned structure of set theory and logic. His book Investigation of the Laws of
Thought, published in 1854, was signiﬁcant in the evolution of mathematics.
The theory of enumeration,permutation,and combinatorics evolved over
wide geographical areas and for a long period of time.There are traces of the
theory in China during the twelfth century. About the same time, the Hindus
found rules to determine the number of “changes upon apertures of a build-
ing,”“the scheme of musical permutations,”and “the combination of different
savors”in medicine (Bhäskara in Lilavati).The early Hebrews and Arabs studied
permutations because of their belief in the mysticism of arrangements and
the combinations of planets.
The ﬁrst major publication on the theory of enumeration was the work of
a Swiss mathematician,Jacques Bernoulli (1654–1705).His Ars Conjectandi was
published in 1713 after his death.
Today, permutations and combinations have moved out of the realm of
mysticism and ﬁnd applications in the sciences, engineering, social science,
statistics,and computer science.
The process of counting the number of objects in a set seems elemen-
tary, and it is in many cases. However, in some instances, a correct count is
obtained with much difﬁculty, if at all. For example, a law required a census
be taken in the year 2000 to count all U.S. residents. Problems occurred be-
cause some people refused to return the census form,census workers did not
ﬁnd some people at home, and people moved to new locations. Another

Subset
One of the basic concepts in mathematics is that of a set. Even in everyday life, we
talk about sets. We talk about a set of dishes, a set of spark plugs, a reading list (a set
of books), the people invited to a party (a set of people), the vegetables served at
the cafeteria (a set of vegetables), and the teams in the NFL play-offs (a set of foot-
ball teams).
The concept of a set is so basic that proposed deﬁnitions of it tend to go in circles,
using words that mean essentially the same thing. We may speak of a set as a collec-
tion of objects. If we attempt to deﬁne a collection, we tend to think of the same words
as we use in deﬁning a set. Rather than go in circles trying to deﬁne a set, we will
not give a deﬁnition. However, you should have an intuitive feeling of the meaning
of a set.
Although we do not deﬁne the concept of a set, any particular set should be well
deﬁned.
A set is well deﬁned when there is no ambiguity as to the objects that make up
the set.
For example, the collection of all letters of the English alphabet forms a set of
26 elements. No ambiguity arises as to which elements are in the set and which are
not, so the set is well deﬁned. However, the collection of the ten greatest American
authors is not well deﬁned; it depends on who makes the selection and what they
mean by “great.”
Let’s look at some of the traditional terminology used in speaking about sets.
The objects that form a set may be varied. We can have a set of people, a set of num-
bers, a set of ideas, or a set of raindrops. In mathematics, the general term for an ob-
ject in a set is element. A set may have people, numbers, ideas, or raindrops as ele-
ments. So that the contents of a set will be clearly understood, we need to be rather
precise in describing a set of elements. One way to describe a set is to explicitly list
all its elements. We usually enclose the list with braces. When we write
A={Tom, Dick, Harry}
Set

we are stating that we have named the set “A,” and its elements are Tom, Dick, and
Harry. Customarily, capital letters designate sets, and lowercase letters represent
elements in a set. The notation
x H A
is read “x is an element of A.” We may also say that “x is a member of the set A.”
The statement “x is not an element of the set A” is written
x x A
For the set B={2, 4, 6, 8}, we may write 4 H B to specify that 4 is one of the ele-
ments of the set B, and 5 x B to specify that 5 is not one of the elements of B. Here
are some examples of other sets.
The set of positive integers less than 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
■
The vowels of the English alphabet form the set {a, e, i, o, u}.
■
The countries of North America form the set {Canada, USA, Mexico}.
■
The set of all natural numbers is {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}. Notice that we use three dots to in-
dicate that the natural numbers continue, without ending, beyond 4. This is an
inﬁnite set. The three dots are commonly used to indicate that the preceding pattern
continues. This notation is the mathematical equivalent of et cetera. The context in
which the three dots are used determines which elements are missing from the list.
The notation {20, 22, 24, . . . , 32} indicates that 26, 28, and 30 are missing from the
list. This set is ﬁnite because it contains a ﬁnite number of elements. When “. . .” is
used in representing a ﬁnite set, the last element of the set is usually given. An
inﬁnite set gives no indication of a last element, as in the set of positive even num-
bers {2, 4, 6, . . .}.
■
Set-Builder Notation
Another way of describing a set uses the implicit or set-builder notation. The set of
the vowels of the English alphabet may be described by
{x | x is a vowel of the English alphabet}
Read this as “The set of all x such that x is a vowel of the English alphabet.” Note
that the vertical line | is read “such that.” The symbol preceding the vertical line, x
in this instance, designates a typical element of the set. The statement to the right of
the vertical line describes a typical element of the set; it tells how to ﬁnd a speciﬁc
instance of x.

Empty Set
Sometimes a set is described but it has no elements. For example, the set of golfers
who made nine consecutive holes-in-one at the Richland Golf Course has no ele-
ments. Such a set, consisting of no elements, plays an important role in set theory. It
is called the empty set and is denoted by . A set is called nonempty if it contains
one or more elements. The set of people who are 10 feet tall is empty. The set of
blue-eyed people is not empty. The set of numbers that belong to both {1, 3, 5} and
{2, 4, 6} is empty.
Venn Diagrams
It usually helps to use a diagram to represent an idea. For sets, it is customary to use
a rectangular area to represent the universe to which a set belongs. We have not used
the term universe before. The universe is not some all-inclusive set that contains
everything. When I talk about a set of students, I am generally thinking of college
students, so the elements of my set of students are restricted to college students. In
that context, the universe is the set of college students. When a student at Midway
High speaks of a set of students, she restricts the elements of her set to students at
her school, so the set of all students at Midway High School forms her universe. In
a given context, the sets under discussion have elements that come from some re-
stricted set. We call the set from which the elements come the universe or the uni-
versal set. We usually represent the universe by a rectangle. A circular area within
the rectangle represents a set of elements in the universe. The diagram in Figure 6 –1
represents a set A in a universe U. It is called a Venn diagram.
Equal Sets
Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they consist of exactly the same elements;
this is denoted by A=B. The sets A={2, 4, 6, 8} and B={6, 6, 2, 8, 4} are equal
because they consist of the same elements. Listing the elements in a different order or
with repetition does not create a different set.
We use the symbol Z to indicate that two sets are not equal:
{1, 2, 3, 4} Z {2, 5, 6}
Subset
The set B is said to be a subset of A if every element of B is also an element of A.
This is written B 8 A.

When B is not a subset of A, we write B h A:
{3, 5, 9} h {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
The subsets of {1, 2, 3} are
, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}
Notice that a set is a subset of itself; {1, 2, 3} is a subset of {1, 2, 3}. Because  con-
tains no elements, it is true that every element of  is in {1, 2, 3}, so  8 {1, 2, 3}.
In the same sense,  is a subset of every set. The set {1, 2} is a proper subset of
{1, 2, 3} because it is a subset of and not equal to {1, 2, 3}. We point out that if A 8 B
and B 8 A, then A=B.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 21,pg.430 ■
We use ( to denote a proper subset:
{1, 2, 3} ( {1, 2, 3, 4}.
The Union of Two Sets
Sometimes, we wish to construct a set using elements from two given sets. One way
to obtain a new set is to combine the two given sets into one.
The union of two sets, A and B, is the set whose elements are from A or from B, or from
both. Denote this set by A ´ B.
In set-builder notation,
A ´ B={x | x H A or x H B or x is in both}
In ordinary use, the word or is ambiguous, and its meaning may be confusing. The
statement “To be admitted to an R-rated movie, a person must be at least 17 years old
or accompanied by a parent” allows a 20-year-old to attend an R-rated movie alone.
It also allows a 20-year-old to attend with a parent. This is an example of the inclusive
or; it allows one or both options to occur. We interpret the statement “I will take his-
tory or language at 10:00 MWF” to allow only one course at 10:00 MWF. This is called
the exclusive or; it does not allow both options. The word or in mathematics is inter-
preted as the inclusive or.
In standard mathematical terminology, the phrase “x H A or x H B” includes the
possibility of x existing in both. Therefore, the phrase “or x is in both” is mathe-
matically redundant.
Figure 6 –3 shows a Venn diagram that represents the union of two sets. The
shaded area represents A ´ B.

The Intersection of Two Sets
Another way to construct a set from two sets is by performing the operation called
the intersection of two sets.
The intersection of two sets, A and B, is the set of all elements contained in both sets
A and B—that is, those elements that A and B have in common. The intersection of A and
B is denoted by
A ¨ B={x | x H A and x H B}

of two sets. The shaded area is A ¨ B.

Given the sets
A=set of all positive even integers
B=set of all positive multiples of 3
describe and list the elements of A ¨ B and A ´ B.
Solution
Because an element of A ¨ B must be even (a multiple of 2) and a multiple of 3, each
such element must be a multiple of 6. Thus A ¨ B is the set of all positive multiples
of 6, that is, {6, 12, 18, 24, . . .}. As this is an inﬁnite set, only the pattern of numbers
can be listed. A ´ B is the set of positive integers that are multiples of 2 or multi-
ples of 3.

Note that the sets A and B are related to A ´ B and A ¨ B in the following way.
A 8 A ´ B
B 8 A ´ B
A ¨ B 8 A
A ¨ B 8 B
In a ﬁnite set, you can count the elements and ﬁnish at a deﬁnite number. You
can never count all the elements in an inﬁnite set. No matter how high you count,
there will be some left uncounted. The set of whole numbers between 10 and 20 is
ﬁnite; there are 9 of them. The set of fractions between 10 and 20 is inﬁnite; there is
no end to them.
Let
U=set of letters of the English alphabet
A=set of vowels
B=set of the ﬁrst nine letters of the alphabet
Place each of the letters a, c, d, e, i, u, x, y in the appropriate region in a Venn
diagram.
Solution
The letters a, e, i, and u are elements of A; a, c, d, e, and i are elements of B; and x and
y are in neither set. Notice that a, e, and i are in both A and B, so they are in their
intersection. We may indicate this as shown in Figure 6 –5.

Complement
The elements in the universe U that lie outside A form a set called the complement
of A, denoted by A¿. (See Figure 6 –6.)

From the deﬁnition of complement, it follows that for any set A in a universe U,
A ¨ A=

A ´ A=U
A set and its complement have no elements in common. The union of a set and its
complement is the universal set.

A ¨ B=. The sets A={2, 4, 6, 8} and B={1, 3, 5, 7} are disjoint.

union is not, and it is shown by the shaded area.

Number of Elements in a Subset
We now turn our attention to counting the elements in a set. Sometimes we want to
be able to use information about a set and determine the number of elements in it
but avoid actually counting the elements one by one.
We use the notation n(A), read “n of A,” to indicate the number of elements in
set A. If A contains 23 elements, we write n(A)=23.
Suppose you count 10 people in a group that like brand X cola and 15 that like
brand Y. We denote this by n(brand X)=10 and n(brand Y)=15. How many
people are involved in the count? The answer depends on the number who like both
brands. In set terminology, the people who like brand X form one set, and those who
like brand Y form another set. The totality of all people involved in the count form

the union of the two sets, and those who like both brands form the intersection of
the two sets. If we attempt to determine the total count by adding the number who
like brand X and the number who like brand Y, then we count those who like both
X and Y twice. We need to subtract the number who like both from the sum of those
who like X and those who like Y to obtain the total number involved. If there are
4 people who like both brands, then the total count is 10+15-4=21.
In general, the number of elements in the union of two sets is given by the fol-
lowing theorem called the Inclusion–Exclusion Principle.
n(A ´ B)=n(A)+n(B)-n(A ¨ B)
where n(A) represents the number of elements in set A, n(B) represents the number of
elements in set B, and n(A ¨ B) represents the number of elements of A ¨ B.
A={a, b, c, d, e, f}, B={a, e, i, o, u, w, y}. Compute n(A), n(B), n(A ¨ B), and
n(A ´ B).
Solution
n(A)=6 and n(B)=7. In this case, A ¨ B={a, e}, so n(A ¨ B)=2.
A ´ B={a, b, c, d, e, f, i, o, u, w, y}, so n(A ´ B)=11. This checks with the for-
mula, n(A ´ B)=6+7-2=11.

Set A is the 9 o’clock English class of 15 students, so A contains 15 elements. Set B
is the 11 o’clock history class of 20 students, so B contains 20 elements. A ¨ B is the
set of students in both classes (there are 7), so A ¨ B contains 7 elements. The num-
ber of elements in A ´ B (a joint meeting of the classes) is
n(A ´ B)=n(A)+n(B)-n(A ¨ B)
so
n(A ´ B)=15+20-7=28
The sets A and B divide their union into three regions. The number in each 
region is shown in the Venn diagram in Figure 6 –8.
We ﬁnd the number of elements that are in A only by taking the number in A,
n(A)=15, and then subtracting the number that are in both A and B,
n(A ¨ B)=7; thus 15-7=8, the number in A only.

The union of two sets, A ´ B, has 48 elements. Set A contains 27 elements, and set B

48-27-30=–n(A ¨ B)

One hundred students were asked whether they were taking psychology (P) or
biology (B). The responses showed that
61 were taking psychology; that is, n(P)=61.
18 were taking both; that is, n(P ¨ B)=18.
12 were taking neither.
(a) How many were taking biology? [Find n(B).]
(b) How many were taking psychology but not biology? [Find n(P ¨ B¿).]
(c) How many were not taking biology? [Find n(B¿).]
(d) Find n[(B ¨ P)¿].
Solution
(a) Because 12 were taking neither, the rest, 88, were taking at least one of the
courses, so n(P ´ B)=88. We can ﬁnd n(B) from
n(P ´ B)=n(P)+n(B)-n(P ¨ B)
88=61+n(B)-18
n(B)=45
(b) Because 18 students were taking both psychology and biology, the remainder of
the 61 psychology students were taking only psychology. So, 61-18=43 stu-
dents were taking psychology but not biology.
(c) The students not taking biology were those 12 taking neither and the 43 taking
only psychology, a total of 55 not taking biology. (See Figure 6 –9.)
(d) Figure 6 –9 shows that the number outside B ¨ P; that is, n(B ¨ P)¿, is
43+27+12=82.

Venn Diagrams Using Three Sets
A general Venn diagram of three sets divides a universe into as many as eight
nonoverlapping regions. (See Figure 6 –10.) We can use information about the num-
ber of elements in some of the regions (subsets) to obtain the number of elements
in other subsets.
The sets A, B, and C intersect as shown in Figure 6 –11. The numbers in each region
indicate the number of elements in that subset.

A survey yields the following information about the musical preferences of students:
30 like classical.
24 like country.
31 like jazz.
9 like country and classical.
12 like country and jazz.
10 like classical and jazz.
4 like all three.
6 like none of the three.
Draw a diagram that shows this breakdown of musical tastes. Determine the total
number of students interviewed.
Solution
Begin by drawing a Venn diagram as shown in Figure 6 –12a.
The universe is the set of college students interviewed. We want to determine
the number of students in each region of the diagram. Because some students may
like more than one kind of music, these sets may overlap. We begin where the three
sets intersect, and because we know that 4 students like all three types of music, we
place a 4 in the region where all three sets intersect. Of the 9 students who like
both country and classical, we have already recorded 4 (those who like all three).

The other 5 are in the intersection of classical and country that lies outside jazz
(Figure 6 –12b). In a similar fashion, the number who like both jazz and country
breaks down into the 4 who like all three and the 8 who like jazz and country but
are outside the region of all three. Because these three regions account for 17 of
those who like country, the other 7 who like country are in the region where coun-
try does not intersect the jazz and classical. Fill in the rest of the regions; the re-
sults are shown in the diagram in Figure 6 –12c.
Obtain the total number of students interviewed by adding the number in each
region of the Venn diagram. The total is 64.

Note: We ﬁrst determined the number in the innermost region, where all three sets
intersect, and then determined the number in the regions as we moved out. This pro-
cedure works well for problems like this.

Elizabeth Barrett Browning answered her own question “How do I love thee? Let
me count the ways” in a poem that seems to be immortal. Few “how many?” ques-
tions are answered poetically, but such questions often need answers.
For example:
• The telephone company, for planning purposes, may ask “How many telephone
exchanges will Memphis need in ten years?”
• The state highway department may ask “How many vehicles can I-70 carry
safely?”
• A person interested in his or her chances of winning might ask “How many com-
binations of numbers are possible in a lottery drawing?”
• On most college campuses, someone asks “How many parking places are
needed on campus?”
• A professor making out quizzes might ask “How many ways can I select ﬁve
problems from a review sheet?”
In many “How many?” questions, it may not be possible, or practical, to list all
possible ways and count them one by one. If possible, we would like to have a way to
arrive at a total count without a tedious one-by-one listing.
Methods do exist; for example, we learned how to count the number of elements
in the union of two sets (Section 6.2). We learn about some other methods in this
section.
We illustrate one method by ﬁrst making a list in a systematic manner and draw-
ing conclusions from the list.
A teenager asked how many different outﬁts she could form if she had two skirts and
three blouses. Let’s list the different ways.
1.
First skirt with ﬁrst blouse
2.
First skirt with second blouse
3.
First skirt with third blouse

41. Use a Venn diagram to simplify A ´ B when A 8 B.
42. Draw the Venn diagram of A ´ B when
A ¨ B=.
For the 3 sets shown in the following ﬁgure, n(A)+
n(B)+n(C) counts some of the elements more than
once. The elements in the regions labeled “1” are
counted once, the elements in the regions labeled “2”
are counted twice, and the elements in the regions la-
beled “3” are counted three times. Consequently, the
Inclusion–Exclusion Principle for three sets is
n(A  B  C)=n(A)+n(B)+n(C)-n(A 	 B)
-n(A 	 C)-n(B 	 C)+n(A 	 B 	 C)

Notice the pattern of the list. For each skirt, she can obtain three outﬁts by selecting
each of the different blouses, so the total number of outﬁts is simply three times the
number of skirts.
■
If you are to select one book from a list of ﬁve books and a second book from a list
of seven books, you can determine the number of possible selections of the two
books by writing the ﬁrst book from list one with each of the seven books from list
two. You will list the seven books ﬁve times, one with each of the books from list one,
so you will have a list that is 5*7=35 long.
We can list all possible selections in another way, using what are called tree
diagrams.
Tree Diagrams
We illustrate the construction and use of tree diagrams in the next two examples.
Let’s look at another problem. Suppose there are two highways from Speegleville to
Crawford and three highways from Crawford to McGregor. How many different
routes can we choose to go from Speegleville to McGregor through Crawford? A
tree diagram provides a visual means to list all possible routes (Figure 6 –17).
Reading from left to right, starting at 0, draw two branches representing the two
highways from Speegleville to Crawford (use 1 and 2 to designate the highways). At
the end of each of these two branches, draw three branches representing the three
highways from Crawford to McGregor. (Use A, B, and C to designate the highways.)
A choice of a ﬁrst-level branch and a second-level branch determines a route from
Speegleville to McGregor. Notice that the total number of possible routes (branches
that end at McGregor) is six because each ﬁrst-level branch is followed by three
second-level branches.

Cox’s Department Store has two positions to ﬁll, those of a department manager and
an assistant manager. Three people are eligible for the manager position, and four
people are eligible for the assistant manager position. Use a tree diagram to show
the different ways in which the two positions can be ﬁlled.
Solution
Label the candidates for department manager as A, B, and C. Label the candidates
for assistant manager as D, E, F, and G.
The tree diagram in Figure 6 –18 illustrates the 12 possible ways in which the po-
sitions can be ﬁlled. Reading from left to right, starting at 0, you ﬁnd three possible
“branches” (managers). A branch for each possible assistant manager is attached to
the end of each branch representing a manager. In all, 12 paths begin at 0 and go to
the end of a branch. For example, the path 0BD represents the selection of B as the
manager and D as the assistant manager.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 1,pg.447 ■
A tree diagram shows all possible ways to make a sequence of selections, and it
shows the number of different ways the selections can be made.
The total number of selections is the number of end points of branches and is
the product of the number of ﬁrst-level branches and the number of second-level
branches; that is, the number of ways in which the ﬁrst selection can be made times
the number of ways in which the second selection can be made.
These three examples are fundamentally the same kind of problem. Let’s make
a general statement that includes each one.
Multiplication Rule
Suppose that there are two activities, A1 and A2. Each activity can be carried out in
several ways. We want to determine in how many different ways the ﬁrst activity fol-
lowed by the second activity can be performed.
In the three preceding examples, A1 and A2 are the following:
Selections of an outﬁt: A1 is the activity of selecting a skirt, and A2 is the activity
of selecting a blouse.
Routes from Speegleville to McGregor: A1 is the selection of a highway from
Speegleville to Crawford, and A2 is the selection of a highway from
Crawford to McGregor.
Filling two positions: A1 is the selection of a manager, and A2 is the selection of
an assistant manager.
In many cases, we do not need a list of all possible selections, but we need their
number. In such a case, the problem reduces to a question of the number of ways in
which we can carry out the activity A1 followed by the activity A2. The solution is
simple: Multiply the number of ways in which activity A1 can be performed by the
number of ways in which activity A2 can be performed. This is often called the
Multiplication Rule.

Note
Two slates of ofﬁcers
differ if one or more
ofﬁcers is replaced by
another person or if
two or more ofﬁcers
exchange positions.
Two activities A1 and A2 can be performed in n1 and n2 different ways, respectively. The
total number of ways in which A1 followed by A2 can be performed is
n1*n2
Now let’s apply the Multiplication Rule to some examples.
A taxpayers’ association is to elect a chairman and a secretary. There are four can-
didates for chairman and ﬁve candidates for secretary. In how many different ways
can a slate of ofﬁcers be elected?
Solution
This problem can be analyzed using a tree diagram. (See Figure 6 –19.) The ﬁrst ac-
tivity, selecting a chairman, is represented by the four ﬁrst-stage branches, C1, C2, C3,
and C4. To each of these branches we attach the ﬁve possible selections of the sec-
ond activity, selecting a secretary. This results in 4*5=20 branches representing

The analysis of a problem using a tree diagram can quickly become unwieldy. You
quickly see that you don’t want to use a tree diagram to analyze the next example,
even though it is theoretically possible to do so.
Moody Library wishes to display two rare books, one from the history collection and
one from the literature collection. If the library has 50 history and 125 literature
books to select from, how many different ways can the books be selected for display?
Solution
A tree diagram of this problem would have 50 branches at the ﬁrst stage represent-
ing the 50 history books. Attached to the end of each of the history branches are
125 branches representing the literature books. The number of branches ﬁnally is
the number of choices of the ﬁrst-stage branch times the number of choices of the
second-stage branch. In this case, there are 50*125=6250 possible displays.
It is not practical to draw a tree with 6250 branches, so use the Multiplication
Rule to analyze the problem. The ﬁrst activity is a selection of a history book, and
the second activity is the selection of a literature book. This sequence can be per-
formed in 50*125=6250 ways.

Jane selects one card from a deck of 52 different cards. The ﬁrst card is not replaced
before Joe selects the second one. In how many different ways can they select the two
cards?
Solution
Jane selects from a set of 52 cards, so n1=52. Joe selects from the remaining cards,
so n2=51. Two cards can be drawn in 52*51=2652 ways.

Sets and Counting
Some problems ask for the number of ways a sequence of more than two activities
can be performed. The Multiplication Rule can be applied to sequences of more
than two activities.
Activities A1, A2, . . . , Ak can be performed in n1, n2, . . . , nk different ways, re-
spectively. The number of ways in which one can perform A1 followed by A2 . . .
followed by Ak is
n1*n2*. . .*nk
A quiz consists of four multiple-choice questions with ﬁve possible responses to each
question. In how many different ways can the quiz be answered?
Solution
In this case, there are four activities—that is, answering each of four questions. Each
activity (answering a question) can be performed (choosing a response) in ﬁve dif-
ferent ways. The answers can be given in
5*5*5*5=625
different ways.

Three couples attend a movie and are seated in a row of six seats. How many differ-
ent seating arrangements are possible if couples are seated together?
Solution
Think of this as a sequence of six activities, that of assigning a person to sit in each
of seats 1 through 6. The Multiplication Rule states that the number of ways in which
this can be done is the product of the numbers of ways in which each selection can
be made.
First seat: Any one of the six people may be chosen, so there are six choices.
Second seat: Only the partner of the person in the ﬁrst seat may be chosen, so
there is one choice.
Third seat: One couple is seated, so any one of the remaining four people may
be chosen. Thus there are four choices.
Fourth seat: There is one choice only because it must be the partner of the per-
son in the third seat.

Fifth seat: There are two choices because either of the two remaining people
may be seated.
Sixth seat: The one remaining person is the only choice.
By the multiplication rule, the number of possible arrangements is the product of the
number of choices for each seat:
6*1*4*1*2*1=48

The Cameron Art Gallery has several paintings by each of ﬁve artists. A wall has
space to hang four paintings in a row. How many different arrangements by artists
are possible if
(a) The paintings are by different artists?
(b) More than one painting by an artist may be displayed, but they may not be hung
next to each other?
Solution
These problems may be viewed as a sequence of four activities, choosing an artist for
each of the four spaces. The total number of ways is the product of the number of
choices for each space.
(a) Because all artists must be different, there are ﬁve choices for the artist in the
ﬁrst space, four for the second, three for the third, and two for the fourth. The
number of arrangements is 5*4*3*2=120.
(b) The ﬁrst painting to be hung can be selected from any one of the ﬁve artists. A
painting by that artist may not be used in the second space, but a painting by any
of the remaining four artists may be used. The artist chosen for the second space
may not be chosen for the third space, but the artist chosen for the ﬁrst space
may be used. (The ﬁrst and third paintings are not hung next to each other.)
Thus, there are four choices, for the third space. Likewise, there are four choices
for the fourth space. The total number of arrangements is
5*4*4*4=320

Addition Rule for Counting Elements in Disjoint Sets
In Section 6.2, we have the Inclusion–Exclusion Principle,
n(A ´ B)=n(A)+n(B)-n(A ¨ B)
which gives the number of elements in the union of two sets. When the sets are dis-
joint, n(A ¨ B)=0, so the rule reduces to
n(A ´ B)=n(A)+n(B)
We can apply this counting principle to a situation in which you wish to deter-
mine the number of ways to perform one activity or another, but not both. For ex-
ample, there are six movies and four talk shows on cable TV at the same time. You

plan to watch either a movie or a talk show. How many choices do you have? Think
of listing your choices. List the six movies and then the talk shows (or vice versa) and
you have a list of 6+4=10 choices.
This illustrates a basic principle, the Addition Rule.
If an activity A1 can be performed in n1 ways and activity A2 can be performed in
n2 ways, then either A1 or A2, but not both simultaneously, can be performed in
n1+n2 ways.
Rhonda plans to buy a Saturn car. The Temple dealer has 15 Saturns in stock, and
the Austin dealer has 23 in stock. How many choices does Rhonda have if she buys
a Saturn from one of these dealers?
Solution
Because Rhonda will buy from one dealer or the other (and not both), the Addition
Rule applies. She has 15+23=38 choices.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 19,pg.448 ■
The next example illustrates a problem where both the Addition Rule and the
Multiplication Rule apply.
In how many different ways can 3 science and 2 history books be arranged on a shelf
if books on each subject are kept together?
Solution
First, observe that the subjects can be arranged in two ways, science on the left and
history on the right or vice versa.
Next, count the number of ways in which the books can be arranged within the
subject arrangements:
Science-history: There are ﬁve positions to be ﬁlled, science ﬁrst and history
second. The number of possible arrangements is 3*2*1*2*1=12.
History-science: Again there are ﬁve positions to be ﬁlled, but history books are
placed ﬁrst and science books second. The number of possible arrange-
ments is 2*1*3*2*1=12.
Because the arrangements can be either science-history or history-science, the
Addition Rule states there are 12+12=24 arrangements.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 57,pg.451 ■
We point out that this can also be solved using the Multiplication Rule exclusively
with six arrangements of the science books within the science group, two arrange-
ments of the history books within the history group, and two arrangements of the
subject groups, giving 6*2*2=24 arrangements.

The Multiplication Rule counts the number of ways a sequence of activities can be
performed. A common application counts the ways a selection can be made from
two or more sets such as the number of ways a person can select a salad, an entrée,
and a dessert from a menu. The Multiplication Rule can also apply to counting the
number of ways a sequence of objects can be selected from one set. We next focus on
such an application that occurs frequently enough to be given a name, a permutation.
The next example provides an illustration from which we will form a general
conclusion.

Activity 1: Select a painting from the set of seven for the ﬁrst location. This can
be done in seven ways because any of the seven paintings can be selected.
Activity 2: Select one of the remaining paintings for the second location. This can
bedoneinsixwaysbecauseanyofthesixremainingpaintingscanbeselected.
Activity 3: This can be done in ﬁve ways because any of the ﬁve remaining paint-
ings can be selected.
Therefore, there are 7*6*5=210 possible arrangements.

for exhibition when just the collection, not the order of arrangement, form the activi-
ties. This example has properties that we identify with a permutation.
A permutation problem can be viewed in two ways:
1.
Count the number of sequences in which elements can be selected from a set, re-
moving an element at each step and making the next selection from the elements
that remain. This ﬁts the Multiplication Rule directly, with the number of
choices decreasing by one at each step.
2.
Select all subsets of elements with the designated number of elements from a set
and count the number of ways the elements can be arranged.
Many problems are presented from the second viewpoint.
In either case, the number of sequences or arrangements of, say, four selections
from a set of n elements is
n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) ways

Permutations
453
A subset of distinct elements selected from a given set and arranged in a speciﬁc order is
called a permutation.
Because a problem may not be identiﬁed as a permutation problem, you need
to be able to recognize it as such. Here are three keys that can help in recognizing a
permutation.
1.
A permutation is an arrangement or sequence of selections of elements from
a single set.
2.
Repetitions are not allowed, which means that once an element is selected it
is not available for a subsequent selection. The same element may not appear
more than once in a particular arrangement.
3.
The order in which the elements are selected or arranged is signiﬁcant.
Studentssometimesaskhowtotellwhenorderissigniﬁcant.Adifferentorderoc-
curs when two items exchange positions or the order of two selections is exchanged.
If such an exchange makes a difference in the selection, then order is signiﬁcant. If the
exchange makes no difference, then order is not signiﬁcant.
Ten students each submit one essay for competition. In how many ways can ﬁrst, sec-
ond, and third prizes be awarded?
Solution
This is a permutation problem because
1.
Each essay selected is from the same set.
2.
No essay can be submitted more than once; that is, an essay cannot be awarded
two prizes (no repetition).
3.
The order (prize given) of the essays is important.
Any of the ten essays may be chosen for ﬁrst prize. Then any of the remaining nine
may be chosen for the second prize, and any of the other eight may be chosen for third
prize. According to the Multiplication Rule, the three prizes may be awarded in
10*9*8=720 different ways

In how many different ways can a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter be given to
four children if one coin is given to each child?
Solution
Each child may be considered a “position” that receives a coin. The number of ways
a coin may be given to each child is
First child: four possibilities of a coin
Second child: three possibilities of a coin
Third child: two possibilities of a coin
Fourth child: one possibility of a coin

At the Cumberland River Festival, four young women (called “belles” in the South)
are stationed at historic Fort House; one stands at the entrance, one in the living
room, one in the dining room, and one on the back veranda. If there are ten belles,
in how many different ways can four be selected for the stations?
Solution
This is a permutation, because a woman can be selected for, at most, one station, and
the order (place stationed) is signiﬁcant. The permutation can be made in
10*9*8*7=5040 different ways
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 29,pg.459 ■
If the problem in Example 4 had been to select four belles to be present in the living
room with no particular station for each one, then Example 4 would not have been
a permutation problem, because the belles would not be arranged in any particular
order. (The number of selections in this case uses a technique that we discuss later.)
Notations for Number of Permutations
The notation commonly used to represent the number of permutations for a set is
written P(8, 3), which is read “permutation of eight things taken three at a time.”
This notation represents the number of permutations of three elements from a set of
eight elements. P(10, 4) represents the number of permutations of four elements se-
lected from a set of ten elements. [P(7, 3) is the answer to Example 1, and P(10, 4)
is the answer to Example 4.]
We want you to understand the pattern for calculating numbers like P(10, 4) so
that you can do it routinely. Let’s look at some examples.
P(10, 4)=10*9*8*7 permutations of four elements 
taken from a set of ten elements.
P(5, 3)=5*4*3
P(7, 2)=7*6 permutations of two elements
selected from a set of seven elements.
P(21, 3)=21*20*19
In each case, the calculation begins with the ﬁrst number in the parentheses, 21
in P(21, 3) and 7 in P(7, 2). The second number in P(21, 3), P(7, 2), and so on de-
termines the number of terms in the product. Because the terms decrease by one to
the next term, you need to know only the ﬁrst term and how many are needed to cal-
culate the answer.
This reasoning lets us know that P(30, 5) is a product of ﬁve terms beginning
with 30, each term thereafter decreasing by one, so
P(30, 5)=30*29*28*27*26
P(105, 4)=105*104*103*1022

Can you give the last term in P(52, 14) without writing out all the terms? The 
preceding examples give a pattern that helps. To give a general description of the last
term in the calculation of P(n, r), we write the last terms of the examples in a way
that seems unnecessarily complicated. However, it will help us obtain the general
form.
Example
Last term
May be written as
P(5, 3)=5*4*3
3=5-2
5-3+1
P(10, 4)=10*9*8*7
7=10-3
10-4+1
P(105, 4)=105*104*103*102
102=105-3
105-4+1
so we expect the last term of
P(52, 14)
to be
52-13=39
(also written 52-14+1)
In general, P(n, k) indicates the number of arrangements that can be formed by
selecting k elements from a set of n elements. Following the observed pattern, it may
be written
P(n, k)=n(n-1)(n-2) . . . (n-k+1)
P(n, k)=n(n-1)(n-2) . . . (n-k+1)
We use a special notation for the case when a permutation uses all elements of
a set. Notice that P(4, 4) is just the product of the integers 4 through 1, that is,
4*3*2*1. In general, P(n, n) is the product of the integers n through 1. The
following notation is used.
The product of the integers n through 1 is denoted by n! (called n factorial).
1!=1
n!=n(n-1)(n-2)*. . .*2*1
(for n>1)
0!=1
Notice that n! is not deﬁned for negative values of n.
7!=7*6*5*4*3*2*1=5040
2!=2*1=2
6!=6*5*4*3*2*1=720
Notice that 6!=6*5! and 4!=4*3!, and so on.
1!=1
0! is deﬁned to be 1

How many different ways can six people be seated in a row of six chairs?
Solution
This is a permutation because
1.
The people are all selected from the same set.
2.
Repetitions are not allowed, a person may not occupy two different seats at the
same time.
3.
Order is signiﬁcant, because a different seating arrangement occurs when two
people exchange seats.
Because six positions are to be ﬁlled from a set of six people, the number of
arrangements is

Many auto license plates have three letters followed by three digits. How many dif-
ferent license plates are possible if
(a) Letters and digits are not repeated on a license plate?
(b) Repetitions of letters and digits are allowed?
Solution
(a) First of all, this may be viewed as a Multiplication Rule problem with two activ-
ities. The ﬁrst activity is the selection and arrangement of letters; the second ac-
tivity is the selection and arrangement of digits. The number of license plates is
found by multiplying the number of selections of letters and the number of se-
lections of digits. The selection of letters is a permutation, P(26, 3) in number,
and the selection of digits is a permutation, P(10, 3) in number. The number of
license plates is then P(26, 3)*P(10, 3)=15,600*720=11,232,000.
(b) This is an ordered arrangement that is not a permutation, because a letter or
digit may appear more than once on a license plate. This is a Multiplication
Rule problem with six activities, the selection of three letters followed by
the selection of three digits. This can be done in 26*26*26*10*
10*10=17,576,000 ways.

Permutations of Objects with Some Alike (Optional)
So far the permutation problems have involved objects that are all different.
Sometimes we arrange objects when some are alike. For example, we may ask for all
arrangements of the letters of the word AGREE. Generally, we have said that we can
arrange ﬁve objects in P(5, 5)=5!=120 ways. However, when we interchange the
two E’s in a word, we obtain the same word. Each time we “spell” a word, the E’s are
placed in certain positions. We can arrange the E’s in those positions in 2! ways and
still have the same “word.” Therefore, the number of different “words” (arrange-
ments) is 120/2!.
For example, in the word EAGER we can think of the two E’s as E1 and E2
to distinguish them momentarily. One spelling is E1 AGE2 R, and another is
E2 AGE1 R. The number of “different” spellings that give the same words depends
on the number of arrangements of the identical letters. In this case the two E’s can
be arranged in 2! ways. In general, k identical objects can be arranged in k! ways that
leave the overall arrangement unchanged.
The number of distinguishable arrangements is the total number of arrange-
ments (distinguishable and undistinguishable) divided by k!.

P(n, k) =
n!
(n - k)!

tical objects in the second subset, and so on.
Part (b) of the theorem tells how to compute the number of permutations when
there are two or more categories of identical objects.

Basketball teams X and Y are in a playoff. The team that wins three out of a possible
ﬁve games is the winner. Denote the sequence of winners by a sequence of letters
such as XXYYY. This indicates that X won the ﬁrst two games and Y won the last
three. How many different sequences are possible if X wins the playoff?
Solution
In cases where a team wins the playoff in fewer than ﬁve games, such as XXYX, only
one Y appears, so we can let Y “win” the unplayed game and have 3 X’s and 2 Y’s,
XXYXY. This way we can represent all possible sequences of playoff games with
3 X’s and 2 Y’s. The number of games is
Similarly, there are ten different sequences possible for Y to win, giving
10+10=20 possible sequences for the playoff to occur.

DEFINITION
Combination
A subset of elements chosen from a given set without regard to their arrangement is called
a combination.
The notation C(n, k), read “combinations of n things taken k at a time,” repre-
sents the number of subsets consisting of k elements taken from a set of n elements.
C(8, 3) denotes the number of ways in which three elements can be selected
from a set of eight. C(52, 6) denotes the number of ways in which six elements can
be selected from a set of 52.
The keys to recognizing a combination are the following.
1.
A combination selects elements from a single set.
2.
Repetitions are not allowed.
3.
The order in which the elements are arranged is not signiﬁcant.
Notice that a combination differs from a permutation only in that order is not
signiﬁcant in a combination, whereas it is important in a permutation.
Given the set A={a, b, c, d, e, f}, the subset {b, d, f} is a combination of three
elements taken from a set of six elements.
Because the elements of the subset {b, d, f} can be arranged in several ways, we
expect there to be several permutations for each subset. This indicates that you
should expect more permutations than combinations in a given set.
■
List all combinations of two elements taken from the set {a, b, c}.
Solution
Because of the small number of elements involved, it is rather easy to list all sub-
sets consisting of two elements. They are {a, b}, {a, c}, and {b, c}. Therefore,
C(3, 2)=3.

If we are interested in lists like all 5-letter subsets of our 26-letter alphabet, the list-
ing rapidly increases in difﬁculty. If we want only the number of such subsets, not the
list, then the problem becomes easier. Let’s look at two examples that illustrate how
to determine the number of combinations.
We will see there is a deﬁnite relationship between the number of permutations
and the number of combinations.
Select all two-letter combinations of letters from the set of four letters {A, B, C, D}.
Solution
We use a tree diagram to show all the ways we can select a pair of letters. (See
Figure 6 –20.)

Chapter 6
Sets and Counting
Because we are interested only in the pair of objects, not their order of selection,
notice that (A, B) and (B, A) both appear and are equal sets, so (A, B) occurs twice.
The list of all possible pairs then is
(A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (B, C), (B, D), (C, D)
each appearing twice in the tree diagram. It is no accident that the number of
pairs, 6, is
where 12=P(4, 2) is the number of permutations, P(4, 2), and 2! is the number of
arrangements of each pair. Thus, 
This shows 6 ways a subset of two letters can be chosen; that is, there are 6 combi-
nations of two letters selected from a set of four.
■
Let’s look at the relationship between permutations and combinations again by
making a list of combinations and corresponding permutations using subsets with
more than two elements.
We use a set of four letters, {a, b, c, d}, and form all three-element subsets.
There are four, each of which may be obtained by removing one letter from the set
of four letters. Here is the list of combinations and all permutations that can be
formed from the letters in the combination.

Combinations

Notice there are six permutations for each combination. This is expected because
three letters can be arranged in 3!=6 ways. We can get the total number of per-
mutations with
(Number of combinations)*(Number of permutations per combination)
In the above that is
C(4, 3)*6=P(4, 3)
which we write as
C(4, 3)*3!=P(4, 3)
Dividing by 3! we have
This gives us what we need to compute C(4, 3):

numbers in the subset, so

Notice the pattern used in computing combinations. To compute C(10, 4), begin
with 10 and write four integers in decreasing order. Then divide by 4!. This is true in
general. To compute C(15, 5), form the numerator using the ﬁve integers beginning
with 15 and decreasing by 1. The denominator is 5!. In general, we can write C(n, r)
by forming the numerator from the product of r integers that begin with n and de-
crease by 1. The denominator is r!.
Special Cases
The form for the number of combinations,
is a useful form. Let’s use it to look at some special cases.
1.
In how many ways can one element be selected from a set? C(6, 1) is the num-
ber of ways one element can be selected from a set of six. It is
In general,
So one item can be selected from a set of n items in n ways.
2.
In how many ways can zero items be selected from a set? We write C(6, 0) to
represent the number of ways in which no elements can be selected from a set
of six. The formula gives
Because 0!=1, this reduces to C(6, 0)=1. In general,
Does your intuition tell you that there is just one way to select zero elements
from a set? The one way is to take none.

For positive integers, n, P(n, 1)=n, so when one element is selected from a set,
the number of permutations equals the number of combinations, n.
Problems Involving More Than One Counting Technique
The solution to a problem may involve more than one counting technique. Often the
ﬁrst level is the Multiplication Rule with two or more activities involved. To count
the number of ways in which each of these activities can occur may require permu-
tations, combinations, or the Multiplication Rule again. The examples that follow
involve more than one counting technique.
A cafeteria offers a selection of four meats, six vegetables, and ﬁve desserts. In how
many ways can you select a meal consisting of two different meats, three different
vegetables, and two different desserts?
Solution
Basically, this is a problem whose solution ﬁrst uses the Multiplication Rule. We ob-
tain the possible number of meals by multiplying the number of ways in which you
can select two meats, the number of ways in which you can select three vegetables,
and the number of ways in which you can select two desserts.
Each of the numbers of ways in which you can select meats, vegetables, and
desserts forms a combination problem. Therefore, we obtain the number of meals as
(Number of meat selections)*(number of vegetable selections)

The Beta Club has 14 male and 16 female members. A committee composed of
3 men and 3 women is formed. In how many ways can this be done?
Solution
Because we are trying to determine the number of ways a ﬁrst event (selecting
3 males) and a second event (selecting 3 females) can occur, we need to compute the
number of ways each can occur and then multiply these values.
Example 9
 = 6 * 20 * 10 = 1200

2 * 1 * 6 * 5 * 4
3 * 2 * 1 * 5 * 4

Instead of counting the number of outcomes for a sequence of activities, some count-
ing problems seek the number of possible outcomes when the outcome selected is
from one activity or another. We can also state this as a selection from one of two dis-
joint sets. This type of problem requires that we ﬁnd the number of ways each activ-
ity can occur and add them.
How many different committees can be selected from eight men and ten women if a
committee is composed of three men or three women?
Solution
For a moment, think of listing all possible selections of a committee. The list has two
parts, a list of committees composed of three women and a list of committees com-
posed of three men. The total number of possible committees can be obtained by
adding the number of all-female to the number of all-male committees. We get each
of these by the following:
Do not confuse this problem with the number of ways in which a committee of
three men and a committee of three women can be chosen. That calls for the selec-
tion of a pair of committees, one from each of two disjoint sets.
This example calls for the selection of one committee from one of two disjoint
sets. So, this example uses the Addition Rule.

The Huck Manufacturing ﬁrm forms a six-person advisory committee. The commit-
tee is composed of a chair, vice-chair, and secretary from the administrative staff and
three members from the plant workers. Seven members from the administrative staff
and eight plant workers are eligible for the committee positions. In how many dif-
ferent ways can the committee be formed?
Solution
At the ﬁrst level, this is a Multiplication Rule problem because two activities are in-
volved: selecting ofﬁcers from the administrative staff and selecting committee mem-
bers from the plant workers. We compute the number of ways in which each can occur
and then we multiply. The selection of ofﬁcers is a permutation because repetitions
are not allowed (a person may not hold two ofﬁces) and the different ofﬁces impose
an order. The number of slates of ofﬁcers is P(7, 3). The selection of committee mem-
bers from the plant workers is a combination because no distinction is made between
those positions, and repetitions are not allowed. The number of selections is C(8, 3).
The total number of ways in which the administrative committee can be selected
is P(7, 3)*C(8, 3)=11,760.

Binomial Theorem
Perhaps you remember from your high school algebra that
(x+y)2=x2+2xy+y2
You are less likely to remember that
(x+y)3=x3+3x2y+3xy2+y3
and few remember that
(x+y)4=x4+4x3y+6x2y2+4xy3+y4
At this point, you may be asking why we discuss the expansion of (x+y)n in a
section on counting combinations. We do so because we can use combinations to
ﬁnd the expansion of, say, (x+y)5 without memorizing the coefﬁcients and without
multiplying
Example 12

471
Binomial Theorem
Note
We refer to this as the
BinomialTheorem
because an expression
of two terms,x+y,is
called a binomial.
(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)
To see how this is done, let’s make some helpful observations. In any term of
(x+y)4, the exponents on x and y add to 4. In any term of (x+y)3, the exponents
on x and y add to 3. In general, in any term of (x+y)n, the exponents on x and y
add to n.
In the expansion (x+y)4=x4+4x3y+6x2y2+4xy3+y4, the coefﬁci-
ents 1, 4, 6, 4, and 1 are equal, respectively, to
1=C(4, 0)
4=C(4, 1)
6=C(4, 2)
4=C(4, 3)
1=C(4, 4)
In another example, (x+y)3=x3+3x2y+3xy2+y3, the coefﬁcient of x2y
is C(3, 1), the coefﬁcient of x8y5 in (x+y)13 is C(13, 5), and in general, the
coefﬁcient of x n – 4y4 in (x+y)n is C(n, 4). Even more general, the coefﬁcient of
x n – kyk in (x+y)n is C(n, k). This enables us to write (x+y)n in the following way
using what is called the Binomial Theorem.
Expansion of (x+y)n:
(x+y)n=C(n, 0)xn+C(n, 1)xn – 1y+C(n, 2)xn – 2y2+. . .
+C(n, k)xn – kyk+. . .+C(n, n-1)xyn – 1+C(n, n)yn
■
Application to Subsets
We can apply the Binomial Theorem to the counting of all
subsets of a set. First, we observe that we can write 2n=(1+1)n, so we then can
write, for example,
Because 1=12=13=. . . ,
24=(1+1)4=C(4, 0)+C(4, 1)+C(4, 2)+C(4, 3)+C(4, 4)
We recognize the terms in the sum above as
A set of four elements has C(4, 0) subsets with 0 elements.
A set of four elements has C(4, 1) subsets with 1 element.
A set of four elements has C(4, 2) subsets with 2 elements.
 
+ C(4, 2)(1)2(1)2 + C(4, 3)(1)(1)3 + C(4, 4)(1)4
 24 = (1 + 1)4 = C(4, 0)(1)4 + C(4, 1)(1)3(1)
 = x6 + 6x5y + 15x4y2 + 20x3y3 + 15x2y4 + 6xy5 + y6
 
+ C(6, 4)x2y4 + C(6, 5)xy5 + C(6, 6)y6
 (x + y)6 = C(6, 0)x6 + C(6, 1)x5y + C(6, 2)x4y2 + C(6, 3)x3y3
Example 13

A set of four elements has C(4, 3) subsets with 3 elements.
A set of four elements has C(4, 4) subsets with 4 elements.
Thus, the sum of (1+1)4 gives the number of all subsets of a four-element set,
namely, 24=16.
The example of the number of subsets of a four-element set illustrates a more
general principle.
The number of all subsets of a set with n elements is 2n.
In how many ways can Suzie invite two or more of her ﬁve friends to her birthday
party?
Solution
This problem essentially asks for the number of subsets with two or more elements
that can be formed from a ﬁve-element set. The number of subsets with two or more
elements is the number of all subsets minus the number of subsets with zero or one
element, which is:
Number with two or more elements=25-C(5, 0)-C(5, 1)
=25-1-5=32-6=26
Two or more friends can be selected in 26 ways.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 33,pg.474 ■
We conclude this section with an explanation of why, for example, C(6, 4)
is the correct coefﬁcient of x2y4 in the expansion of (x+y)6. First, we write
(x+y)6 as
(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)
Now, for the moment, think of each factor, x+y, as a pair of two elements, (x, y).
We have six such pairs from the product.
When you obtain (x+y)6 by multiplying the factors of
(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)
different people may vary some in the way they ﬁnd the product, but all will essen-
tially take either an x or a y from each of the six factors and multiply. This is done in
all possible ways and the terms added. If a y is taken from four of the factors and an
x from the other two, then x2y4 is obtained. In the process, this term is obtained sev-
eral times. We want to determine exactly what is meant by “several times.” We have
six pairs (x, y), and we select four of them from which to take a y; then an x is auto-
matically taken from the other two. We can select the four pairs from the six pairs in
C(6, 4) ways. Thus, when we add all the x2y4 terms, we will have C(6, 4)x2y4. If we
use an integer n instead of 6 and an integer k instead of 4, a similar argument implies
that the coefﬁcient of x n – kyk in (x+y)n is C(n, k).

A MIXTURE OF COUNTING PROBLEMS
We have studied four kinds of counting techniques: the Multiplication Rule, the
Addition Rule, permutations (a special case of the Multiplication Rule), and com-
binations. One of the more difﬁcult steps of counting problems is the determination
of the appropriate counting technique to be used.
Usually, you expect to solve the exercises in the permutation section using the
permutation counting technique. Because we want you to be able to analyze a prob-
lem and determine the counting technique, or techniques, to be used, this section has
a mixture of problems for which you determine the technique to be used.
We offer a sequence of questions that should help you determine the appropri-
ate counting technique. The basic questions to ask are
“How many sets are selections made from?”
“Is repetition of elements allowed?”
“Is the order of selection or arrangement signiﬁcant?”
“Are elements selected from each set or is the selection made from one of
several sets?”
Figure 6 –21 shows how the answers to these questions lead to the appropriate
counting technique. Let’s apply it to some examples.
In some problems you will need to apply the procedure more than once, as in
Examples 3 through 6.
Billy’s mother allows him to select three Dr. Seuss books from eight such books in
the Children’s Library. How many ways can Billy make the selection?
Solution
To determine the counting technique, start at the top of the diagram and take the
path indicated by your answer. At each junction, continue according to your answer.
The end of a path indicates the appropriate counting technique.
Here are the questions to ask, and the answers that lead us through the diagram:
1.
How many sets are involved? One set of eight books.
2.
Are repetitions allowed? No, we expect Billy to select three different books.
3.
Is order signiﬁcant? No, the order of selection is irrelevant.

■
Billy is allowed to select one book from eight Dr. Seuss books and one book from six
“What If . . . ?” books. How many ways can he make the selection?
Solution
We ask the questions:
“How many sets are involved?” Two, the Dr. Seuss books and the “What 
If . . . ?” books.
“Is a selection made from each set?” Yes, so this is a Multiplication Rule
problem.
Billy can make the selection in 8*6=48 ways.
■
Some problems are multilevel problems, where a determination of the appropriate
counting technique must be made at each level, so you may need to use the tree di-
agram in Figure 6 –21 more than once.

juniors. How many different ways can the executive group be formed?

Chapter 6
Sets and Counting
Solution
The answer to the question “How many sets are involved?” is two because, for the
purposes of this problem, one kind of selection is made from the group of juniors and
another kind from the seniors so the set of juniors and the set of seniors are the only
relevant sets.
Because selections are made from each of the two sets, this is a Multiplication
Rule problem with
Number of ways the executive group can be selected
=(number of ways the ofﬁcers can be selected)
* (number of ways the committee of juniors can be selected)
This is a multilevel problem, because we still must determine the number of
ways the committee and the ofﬁcers can be selected.
For the ofﬁcers there is one set, the seniors. There are no repetitions, because
one person does not hold two ofﬁces, and order is signiﬁcant because when two
people exchange ofﬁces, a different slate is formed. The number of slates equals
P(12, 3)=1320.
For the committee, the selections are from one set, the juniors. There are no
repetitions because one person cannot hold two committee positions, and order is
not signiﬁcant because no distinction is made in committee positions. This is a com-
bination problem with the number of possible committee formations equaling
C(22, 3)=1540.
Finally, the executive group can be formed in 1320*1540=2,032,800 differ-
ent ways.

The Mathematics Department is hosting a high school mathematics contest. Pro-
fessors Tidmore, Johns, and Cannon have volunteered students in their classes to
help with the contest. The coordinator of the contest asks Prof. Tidmore to enlist
four students, two female and two male, to serve as a welcoming committee. Prof.
Johns is asked to enlist ﬁve students to host the lounge where visiting teachers and
parents will wait, and Prof. Cannon is asked to provide three students who will help
grade: one to grade algebra, one to grade geometry, and one to grade calculator
problems. The composition of the classes is
Tidmore’s class: 13 males and 15 females
Johns’s class: 7 males and 5 females
Cannon’s class: 9 females and 9 males
In how many ways can the requested students be selected?
Solution
This is a multilevel selection process, so you may use the decision tree in Figure 6 –21
at each level.
Students are selected from each of three sets—Tidmore’s class, Johns’s class,
and Cannon’s class—so at the ﬁrst level, this is a Multiplication Rule problem.
We now need to determine the number of ways each selection can be made.
Tidmore’s class: Two males are selected from the 13 males, and 2 females are se-
lected from the 15 females, so the Multiplication Rule applies. The selection
Example 4

A Mixture of Counting Problems
481
of 2 males is a combination, C(13, 2)=78. The selection of 2 females is a
combination, C(15, 2)=105. The 4 students can be selected in 78*
105=8190 ways.
Johns’s class: The 5 students are selected from the 12 students in the class,
and there is no assignment of position or order, so this is a combination,
C(12, 5)=792 ways.
Cannon’s class: The 3 students are selected from the 18 students in the class,
and they are assigned a position, or activity, so this is a permutation,
P(18, 3)=4896 ways.
Finally, the 12 students can be selected in
8190*792*4896=31,757,806,080 ways
■
Some problems can be correctly worked in more than one way. Sometimes we are
interested in just some of all possible outcomes. The outcomes can be classiﬁed as
those we want and those we don’t want. Sometimes it is easier to determine the num-
ber we don’t want. We use that number to determine the number we do want, as il-
lustrated in the following example.
The PIN number used at an ATM machine is a sequence of six digits, using the dig-
its 0 through 9 with repetitions allowed.
(a) How many PIN numbers are possible?
(b) How many PIN numbers are possible with no repetition of digits?
(c) How many PIN numbers are possible with at least one digit repeated?
Solution
(a) Each digit can be selected in ten ways, so the number of PIN numbers is
10*10*10*10*10*10=1,000,000.
(b) Since digits are not repeated and the sequence of digits is signiﬁcant, this is a per-
mutation with P(10, 6)=151,200.
(c) The PIN numbers with at least one digit repeated are all possible PIN numbers
except those with no repetition. Thus, we subtract the number with no repetition
from the number of all possible to obtain the number with at least one repeated
digit:
Number with at least one repeat=1,000,000-151,200
=848,800

Recall the Addition Rule that states when making selections from one of two or
more disjoint sets, the number of possible selections is the sum of the number of
selections from each set.
The PTA program committee decides to ask for 4 students to participate in the next
PTA program. They want the students from either Mr. Dudley’s class of 14 students,
from Miss DeWeese’s class of 17 students, or from Mrs. Bowden’s class of 15 stu-
dents. How many selections are possible?

Solution
One group of 4 students is selected from one of the three classes, so the Addition
Rule applies. The number of selections is C(14, 4)+C(17, 4)+C(15, 4) =
1001+2380+1365=4746.

Special Case:Partition into 
Two Subsets
In this section we discuss an idea called the partitioning of a set. We want to deter-
mine the number of ways a set can be partitioned. We will look at two kinds of par-
titions, ordered and unordered partitions. Let’s begin with an example to lead us into
the ideas.
A group of 15 students is to be divided into three groups to be transported to a game.
The three vehicles will carry four, ﬁve, and six students, respectively. In how many
different ways can the three groups be formed?
Solution
Select the four students that ride in the ﬁrst vehicle. This can be done in 
different ways. (Notice the form we use for C(15, 4). It is more useful in this case.)
After this selection, ﬁve students may be selected for the second vehicle in 
C(11, 5) = 11!

Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 9,pg.489 ■
This partition problem has the following properties that make it a partition.
1.
The set is divided into disjoint subsets (no two subsets intersect).
2.
Each member of the set is in one of the subsets.
The following is a more formal deﬁnition of a partition.
A set S is partitioned into k nonempty subsets A1, A2, . . . , Ak if:
1.
Every pair of subsets is disjoint: that is, Ai 	 Aj= when i  j.
2.
A1  A2  . . .  Ak=S.
Ordered Partitions 
We ﬁrst discuss ordered partitions.
A partition is ordered if different subsets of the partition have characteristics that distin-
guishes one from the other.
The characteristics that distinguish subsets may vary widely. For example, one
subset may be males, another females; one subset may be A students, another C stu-
dents; one subset is awarded a million dollar contract, another a $1000 contract; one
subset is the ﬁrst team, another the second team, another the third team; one subset
contains ten elements, another eight elements.
A partition is ordered if an exchange of two subsets gives a different partition.
For example, let 15 basketball players be divided into three teams of ﬁve players
each, and let the teams be designated as ﬁrst, second, and third teams. If the division
of players is left unchanged, but the ﬁrst team is now designated as the second team
and the second team becomes the ﬁrst team, then a different partition is obtained.
Thus, we have an ordered partition.
Number of Ordered Partitions
We now determine the number of ways in which a set can be partitioned.

From Example 1, we see that the number of ways in which a set of 15 elements
can be partitioned into subsets of four, ﬁve, and six elements may be expressed as

This is generalized in the following theorem.
A set with n elements can be partitioned into k ordered subsets of r1, r2, . . . , rk elements
(r1+r2+. . .+rk=n) in the following number of ways:
A set of 12 people (n=12) can be divided into three groups of three, four, and ﬁve

The United Way Allocations Committee has 14 members. In how many ways can
they be divided into the following subcommittees so that no member serves on two
subcommittees?
Scouting subcommittee: two members
Salvation Army subcommittee: four members
Health Services subcommittee: ﬁve members
Summer Recreational Program subcommittee: three members.
Solution
The subcommittees form a partition, because no one is on two subcommittees and
all 14 members are used. The partitions are ordered for two reasons: The subcom-
mittees are of different sizes, and they have different functions. The number of par-
titions is

Special Case: Partition into Two Subsets
Let’s look at a special case of partitions. Suppose a set of 8 objects is partitioned into
two subsets of three and ﬁve objects. The formula for partitions gives
Notice that the formulas for C(8, 3) and C(8, 5) both give
so the number of partitions into two subsets is just the number of ways in which a
subset of one size can be selected. This result occurs because when one subset of
three objects is selected, the remaining ﬁve objects automatically form the other sub-
set in the partition. 
In general the following is true:
The number of partitions of a set into two ordered subsets is the number of ways
in which one of the subsets can be formed.
Unordered Partitions
We now look at partitions that are not ordered.
A partition is unordered when no distinction is made between subsets.
For a partition to be unordered, all subsets must be the same size, otherwise, the
different sizes would distinguish between subsets. When a teacher partitions a class
into four equal groups, all groups working on the same problem, an unordered par-
tition has been formed. If the four equal groups work on different problems, the par-
tition is ordered. If eight members of a traveling squad are paired to room together
on the trip, an unordered partition is formed. If the pairs are assigned to rooms 516,
517, 518, and 519, an ordered partition is formed.
Number of Unordered Partitions
A basketball squad of 15 members can be divided into ﬁrst, second, and third teams

lating the number of ordered and unordered partitions.
First, divide the 15 players into three teams of ﬁve each, with no distinction made
between teams. Call these teams A, B, and C. These teams can be ordered into ﬁrst,
second, and third teams in six ways: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, and CBA. You
recognize this as the 3! permutations of the three groups. In general, the ordered
partitionscanbeobtainedbyformingthreegroups(anunorderedpartition)andthen

Here is an example of partitioning a set when no distinction is made between some
subsets and a distinction is made between others.
Find the number of partitions of a set of 12 elements into subsets of three, three,
four, and two elements. No distinction is to be made between subsets except for
their size.
Solution

tween them. Because they are of different sizes, a distinction is made between 
subsets of size 2 and 4 (or 2 and 3). The number of ordered partitions is

The number of unordered partitions is found by dividing by 2! because two sets 
(of size 3) are indistinct. Thus there are

When a weather forecaster predicts the weather,when a coach evaluates the
team’s chances of winning,or when a businessperson projects the success of
the big clearance sale,an element of uncertainty exists.The weather forecaster
knows he is often wrong,the coach knows there is no such thing as a sure win,
and the businessperson knows the best advertised sale sometimes ﬂops.
Often in our daily lives we would like to measure the likelihood of an outcome
of an event or activity.We ask such questions as “Which topics are more likely
to be on the test?”“What are my chances of ﬁnding a parking place in time to
get to my 9 o’clock class?”“Will we have a quiz today?”

Properties of Probability
An area of mathematics known as probability theory provides a measure of the like-
lihood of the outcome of phenomena and events. The government uses it to deter-
mine ﬁscal and economic policies; theoretical physicists use it to understand the na-
ture of atomic-sized systems in quantum mechanics; and public-opinion polls, such
as the Harris Poll, have their theoretical acceptability based on probability theory.
The theory of probability is said to have originated from the following gambling
question: Two gamblers are playing for a stake that goes to the player who ﬁrst wins
a speciﬁed number of points. The game is interrupted before either player has won
enough points to win the stake. (We don’t know whether the game was raided.) The
question is to determine a fair division of the stakes based on the number of points
won by each player at the time of the interruption.
This problem was mentioned from time to time in the mathematical literature
for a period of 150 years but received no widespread attention until it was proposed
to the French mathematician Blaise Pascal about 1654. Pascal communicated the
problem to another French mathematician, Pierre Fermat, who also became quite
interested in it. The two mathematicians arrived at the same answer by different
methods. Their discussions aroused quite a bit of interest in that type of problem.
Pascal and Fermat are generally considered the founders of probability theory.
Probability turned out to have applications far beyond interrupted gambling
games. J. C. Maxwell used probability theory to derive his famous gas laws in 1860.
Edmund Halley, the ﬁrst astronomer to predict the return of a comet, applied prob-
ability to actuarial science in 1693. Today, insurance companies depend on proba-
bility to determine competitive and proﬁtable rates for their policies. Quality control
in manufacturing and product development decisions are based on probability. The
military uses it in the theory of search for enemy submarines. We will learn some el-
ementary applications in this chapter.
Terminology
We use the terms probability, experiment, outcome, and trial in our discussions.
When we ask the likelihood that a tossed coin will turn up heads, we call the activity
of tossing the coin an experiment, the result of tossing the coin an outcome. For this
experiment, two outcomes are possible, “heads” and “tails.” Each time the coin is
tossed we have a trial. We measure the likelihood of “heads” with a number, which
we call the probability of heads, and we use the notation P(heads) to denote that
number. 
An activity or phenomenon that is under consideration is called an experiment. The ex-
periment can produce a variety of observable results, called outcomes. We study activities
that can be repeated or phenomena that can be observed a number of times. We call each
observation or repetition of the experiment a trial.

7.1
Introduction to Probability
497
We can apply the terms experiment, outcome, and trial in a wide variety of ways,
as illustrated in the next example.
(a) Drawing a number out of a hat is an experiment with the number drawn as an
outcome. Each draw of a number is a trial.
(b) A test to determine the germination of ﬂower seeds is an experiment with “ger-
minated” and “not germinated” as possible outcomes. Each test conducted is a
trial.
(c) A drawing of lottery numbers is an experiment with the numbers drawn as an
outcome. Each draw is a trial.
■
In general, experiments involve chance or random results. This means that the out-
comes do not occur in a set pattern but vary depending on impartial chance, and the
outcome cannot be determined in advance. The order in which leaves fall off a tree,
the number of cars that pass a checkpoint on the freeway, and the selection of a card
from a well-shufﬂed deck are examples of experiments that have random outcomes.
Probability deals with random outcomes that have some long-term pattern for
which it is not possible to predict what happens next, but a prediction can be made
of what will happen in the long term.
Life insurance companies know quite accurately how many people will die by a
certain age. They cannot tell when a certain individual will die, but they can predict
general, long-term numbers of deaths.
The determination of probabilities can be a difﬁcult and expensive process, but
we can’t escape the desire to measure the likelihood, or probability, that a certain
outcome occurs. What is the probability of getting a ticket if I exceed the speed
limit? What are the chances of my book being stolen if I leave it on a shelf in the cafe-
teria? What is the probability of a walk in history class today?
The losing basketball team may intentionally foul a member of the winning team
in the closing minutes of a game in hopes that the player will miss the free throw. This
gives the losing team a chance of getting the ball. The winning team wants Mike to
have the ball, because he has made 80% of his free throws for the season. The los-
ing team wants to foul Art, because he has made 55% of his free throws. Based on
this past history, each team assumes that Mike is more likely to make the free throw
than Art.
In order to compare the likelihood of two different outcomes, a number is as-
signed to each outcome. We consider the outcome that is assigned the larger num-
ber to be more likely. In the basketball game, it seems natural to use the numbers
80% and 55% as a measure of the probability of making free throws. 
Let’s look at one way to measure probability, called empirical probability.
Empirical Probability
Probabilities may be assigned by observing a number of trials and using the fre-
quency of outcomes to estimate probability. For example, the operator of a conces-
sion stand at a park keeps a record of the kinds of drinks children buy. Her records
show the following:
Example 1

498
Chapter 7 Probability
To estimate the probability that a child will buy a certain kind of drink, we com-
pute the relative frequency of each drink. We do this by dividing the frequency of
each drink by the total number of drinks.
This experiment has three outcomes, S={cola, lemonade, fruit juice}. We use rel-
ative frequency to estimate probability. The probability a child will buy lemonade is
0.55, which we write symbolically as P(lemonade)=0.55; also, P(cola)=0.30 and
P(fruit juice)=0.15.
The determination of empirical probability requires gathering data from which
relative frequencies are obtained. In practice, this may be a highly sophisticated op-
eration such as a national political poll.
A college has an enrollment of 1210 students. The number in each class is as shown
in the following table:
A student is selected at random. Determine the empirical probability that the stu-
dent is
(a) a freshman.
(b) a sophomore.
(c) a junior.
(d) a senior.
(e) a freshman or sophomore.
(A random selection means that each student has a chance of being selected and any
two students have equal chances of being selected. To select people in a random manner
usually requires careful planning and methodology, often a difﬁcult process.)

Our intuition suggests that a tossed coin will turn up heads one half of the time.
However, if you toss a coin 10 times, you should not expect 5 heads and 5 tails. (Try
it.) Should you repeat the experiment several times, you should expect more than one
value for the relative frequency. Thus, observations of past outcomes can only pro-
vide estimates of the probability. We can get better estimates by repeating the trials
more times. As the number of trials increases, we expect to obtain better estimates of
the probability. This idea is known as the Law of Large Numbers.
As an experiment is repeated more and more times, the relative frequency obtained ap-
proaches the actual probability.
The Law of Large Numbers has been tested for the coin tossing problem. The
Comte de Buffon (1701–1788), Karl Pearson (1857–1936), and John Kerrich, a pris-
oner of war during World War II, each tossed a coin many times. The results of their
efforts were as follows:
Although these results fail to exactly give our intuitive value of 0.5000 for the prob-
ability of heads, they do suggest that 0.5000 is a reasonable probability.

Chapter 7 Probability
Properties of Probability
Let’s observe the properties of relative frequency that correspond to properties
needed for probability assignments in general. First, let’s discuss the terminology
we use. 
An experiment need not classify outcomes in a unique way. It depends on how
the results are interpreted. When a multiple-choice test of 100 questions is given, the
instructor wants to know the number of correct answers given by each student. 
For this purpose, an outcome can be any of the numbers 0 through 100. When the
tests are returned to the students, they tend to ask, “What is an A?” They are inter-
ested in the outcomes A, B, C, D, and F. Then there might be the student who only
asks, “What is passing?” To that student there are just two outcomes of interest, pass
and fail.
When asked “What is today?” a person may respond in several ways, such as 
“It is April 1,” “It is Friday,” “It is payday,” or any one of numerous responses. De-
pending on the focus of the individual, the set of possible responses may be all the
days in a year, all the days of the week, or the two outcomes payday and not payday.
Because the outcomes of an experiment can be classiﬁed in a variety of ways, 
it is important that the appropriate set of outcomes be selected and that everyone
understand which set of outcomes is used. We call the set of outcomes used a sam-
ple space.
A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. Each element of the
sample space is called a sample point or simple outcome.
The next example illustrates some sample spaces. Notice that the sample space
can be deﬁned in more than one way for the same experiment.
(a) If the experiment is tossing a coin, the sample space is {heads, tails}.
(b) If the experiment is drawing a card from a bridge deck, one sample space is the
set of 52 cards.
(c) If the experiment is drawing a number from the numbers 1 through 10, the sam-
ple space can be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Sometimes people are assigned a
number and those assigned an odd number are placed in one group and those
assigned an even number are placed in another group. In this case, the sample
space of interest is {even, odd}.
(d) If the experiment is tossing a coin twice, a sample space is {HH, HT, TH, TT}.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 1,pg.506 ■
We do not insist on just one correct sample space for an experiment because the sit-
uation dictates how to interpret the results. However, we do insist that a sample
space conform to two properties.
Let S be the sample space of an experiment.
1.
Each element in the set S is an outcome of the experiment.
2.
Each outcome of the experiment corresponds to exactly one element in S.

DEFINITION
Event
If a student is selected from a group of university students and the class standing
of the student is the outcome of interest, then {freshman, sophomore, junior, senior}
is a valid sample space. If the gender of the student is the outcome of interest, then
{male, female} is a valid sample space. You can form other sample spaces using age,
GPA, and so on as the outcomes of interest.
In deﬁning the outcomes of an experiment, care must be taken that the proper-
ties of a sample space hold. In an experiment involving the GPA of students, the sec-
ond property of a sample space is violated if we deﬁne the outcomes of interest as
Outcome
GPA
Unacceptable
0.0 –0.9
Marginal
1.0 –1.9
Acceptable
2.0 –2.9
Superior
3.0 – 4.0
This deﬁnition provides no outcome for a GPA such as 1.95 or 2.97, so property 2
does not hold.
Property 2 is violated if we deﬁne the outcomes so that a GPA belongs to two
outcomes:
Outcome
GPA
Unacceptable
0.0 –1.0
Marginal
1.0 –2.0
Acceptable
2.0 –3.0
Superior
3.0 – 4.0
In this case, the GPA scores of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 are indicated to be in two different
outcomes, so property 2 does not hold.
Property 1 would be violated if we deﬁned the unacceptable outcome as –1.0
through – 0.9, because there are no negative values of GPA.
In some instances our interest lies in a collection of outcomes in the sample
space, not just one outcome. If I toss a coin twice, I may be interested in the likeli-
hood that the coin will land with the same face up both times. I am interested in the
subset of outcomes {HH, TT}, not just one of the possible outcomes. We call such a
collection of simple outcomes an event. In Example 2, we might be interested in the
event that a freshman or sophomore is selected.
An event is a subset of a sample space.
An event can be a subset consisting of a single outcome. Such an event is called a simple
event. An event also can be as much as the entire sample space.
We focus primarily on the probability of events that includes the probability of
a simple event. An event often can be formed in more than one way from a set of
simple outcomes. The next example shows some variations in events.
(a) In the experiment of drawing a number from the numbers 1 through 10, the sam-
ple space is
S={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Example 4

502
Chapter 7 Probability
The event of drawing an odd number is the subset {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. The event of
drawing an even number is the subset {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. The event of drawing a
prime number is the subset {2, 3, 5, 7}.
(b) A teacher selects one student from a group of six students. The sample space is
{Scott, Jane, Mary, Kaye, Ray, Randy}. The event of selecting a student with ﬁrst
initial R is {Ray, Randy}. The event of selecting a student with ﬁrst initial J is
{Jane}. The event of selecting a student with ﬁrst initial A is the empty set.
■
We say that an event occurs if the trial yields an outcome that is in the event set.
Probability Assignments
To help understand the properties of a probability assignment, we look again at
Examples 1 and 2 to observe some properties that hold for probability assignments
generally.
We want to accomplish two goals when a probability assignment is made:
1.
Assign a probability, a number, to each simple outcome in the sample space that
will indicate the relative frequency with which the simple outcome occurs.
2.
Assign a probability to each set of outcomes, that is, to each event, that also in-
dicates the relative frequency with which the event occurs.
In Examples 1 and 2, notice the following:
• Each relative frequency can be as small as 0 or as large as 1. In general, a prob-
ability is in the interval 0 through 1.
• For a sample space, the relative frequencies add to 1. In general, the probabili-
ties of all simple outcomes add to 1.
• The relative frequency of an event is the sum of the relative frequencies of the
simple outcomes making up the event.
Although a general probability assignment need not be formed using relative
frequencies, the assignment cannot be arbitrary. It must satisfy some standard con-
ditions similar to those seen in relative frequency.
Let S=Ee1, e2, p , enF be a sample space with simple outcomes e1, e2, p , en.
1.
Each simple outcome in a sample space, ei, is assigned a probability denoted
by PAeiB.
2.
The probability of an event E is determined by the simple outcomes making
up E. P(E) is the sum of the probabilities of all simple outcomes making up
E. For example, if E=Ee1, e2, e3F, then P(E)=PAe1B+PAe2B+PAe3B.
3.
Each probability is a number that is not negative and is no larger than 1; for
simple events ei, 0  PAeiB  1 and for each event E, 0  P(E)  1.
4.
P(S)=1, that is, P(S)=the sum of probabilities of all simple events in a
sample space
P(S)=PAe1B+PAe2B+p+PAenB=1
The next three examples help to understand the properties of probability.

As part of a class assignment, Annette, Ben, and Casie are sent to different class-
room buildings to poll students on the number of siblings they have. They are to clas-
sify them into ﬁve categories: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more. They are to report their ﬁnd-
ings as empirical probability. Here are their reports.
Annette reported:
P(0)=0.20,
P(1)=0.10,
P(2)=0.15
P(3)=0.30,
P(4 or more)=0.25
Is this a valid probability assignment? It is, because
1.
Each outcome is assigned a probability.
2.
Each probability is nonnegative and not larger than 1.
3.
The sum of the probabilities of all simple events is 1.
Possibly, Annette made errors in counting so her report may not be an accurate em-
pirical probability, but it is valid because it satisﬁes the properties of probability.
Ben reported:
P(0)=0.2,
P(1)=0.2,
P(2)=0.3
P(3)=0.25,
P(4 or more)=0.4
Is this a valid probability assignment? It is not valid, because the sum of all prob-
abilities is 1.35.
Casie reported:
P(0)=0.3,
P(1)=–0.1,
P(2)=0.2
P(3)=0.3,
P(4 or more)=0.3
Is this a valid probability assignment? The sum of all probabilities is 1.00, but the
assignment is not valid because one of the probabilities, P(1), is negative.

(a) What is the probability of drawing a Coke? In this example, the event is the sub-
set {regular Coke, diet Coke}. We ask for the probability that the drink selected
is in that subset. According to the second condition in the properties of proba-
bility, the probability of selecting a Coke is 0.15+0.17=0.32, the sum of the
probabilities of the simple outcomes making up the event.
In a similar manner, we obtain the probability of the following event:
(b) The probability of drawing a diet drink is 0.10  0.17  0.30  0.57
[P(diet drink)  0.57].
(c) The probability of selecting a regular Pepsi or a diet Dr Pepper is 0.05 
0.30=0.35.
(d) The probability of selecting a drink that is not a Dr Pepper is 0.05  0.15 
0.10  0.17  0.47 [P(not Dr Pepper)=0.47].

A new student asks about the chances of ﬁnding a parking place on campus. His
roommate, who is taking ﬁnite mathematics, responds with the following statement:
“The probability of ﬁnding a parking place at remote parking is twice the probabil-
ity of ﬁnding a place in the parking garage, and the probability of ﬁnding a place near
your classroom building is one half the probability of ﬁnding a place in the parking
garage.” Assuming that the roommate was correct, ﬁnd the probability of each out-
come: nearby, parking garage, or remote parking.
Solution
Let P(G)=the probability of ﬁnding a place in the parking garage. Then, for re-
mote parking, P(R)=2P(G), and for nearby, P(N)=0.5P(G). Because these
probabilities must add to 1, we have
2P(G)+P(G)+0.5P(G)=1
3.5P(G)=1
P(G)=
(rounded)
From this we have P(R)=0.572, P(G)=0.286, and P(N)=0.143. (Because we
rounded to three decimal places, these add to 1.001.)

come from the empty set because the empty set has no elements. Thus, the proba-
bility of the empty set is zero. The probability of the sample space, P(S), is the prob-
ability that the outcome will come from the sample space. Because the selection is
made from the sample space, the outcome must be in the sample space, so that
makes P(S)=1. We highlight these special cases.
1.
If an event is the empty set, the probability that an outcome is in the event is
zero; that is, 
2.
If an event is the entire sample space, then E=S and P(E)=P(S)=1.
A Visual Model of Probability
We can use area in a Venn diagram to visualize the probability of an event. We let a
rectangle, the universe, represent the sample space and a circle represent an event
(Figure 7–1). We let the probability of an event be represented by the area of the
ﬁgure representing it. Thus, we let the rectangle representing the sample space have
area 1. If the probability of an event is 0.20, then we think of the area of circle E as
20% of the sample space.
Intuitively, a Venn diagram suggests that when an event A is a subset of an event
B (Figure 7–2), then the probability of A cannot be larger than the probability of B.
Likewise, the probability that an outcome is in the intersection of events cannot
be larger than the probability of either of the events (Figure 7–3) and the probabil-
ity of an event A and the probability of an event B must not exceed the probability
of their union (Figure 7– 4).

EQUALLY LIKELY EVENTS
In general, no unique method exists for assigning probabilities to the outcomes 
of an experiment. The conditions, processes, and interactions involved vary de-
pending on the experiment. The skill of the players largely determines the outcome
of a baseball game, but other factors such as the weather or a decision by a coach can
alter the outcome. The type of soil, the amount and the timing of rainfall, tempera-
ture, and insects affect the probability that a new hybrid of corn will be productive.
One important class of experiments that have well-deﬁned probability assignments
are called equally likely models.
Such experiments have the characteristic that the individual outcomes are
equally likely; that is, each outcome has the same chance, or probability, of occurring
as any other outcome. Generally, we say that a tossed coin is just as likely to turn up
a head as a tail, so heads and tails are equally likely to happen. If a coin is altered so
that it comes up heads two-thirds of the time, then heads and tails are not equally

likely. Unless stated otherwise, we assume that a tossed coin is fair; that is, heads and
tails are equally likely.
For one card randomly selected from a well-shufﬂed deck, each card has the
same chance of being the one selected. We say that the outcomes are equally likely.
When a person draws  a coin from a purse with coins of different denominations,
it doesn’t seem reasonable to say that the outcomes are equally likely because of the
variations of size. The small size of a dime makes it less likely to be drawn than a half
dollar, for example.
For experiments with a ﬁnite number of equally likely outcomes, the probability
of each simple outcome is 
where n is the number of outcomes in the sample
space.
If we toss a coin, the sample space is {H, T}. We intuitively agree that heads and
tails are equally likely, so
because the sample space has two elements. If we select a name at random from 25
different names, then each name has 
probability of being drawn.
Because the probability of an event is the sum of probabilities of all simple out-
comes in the event, we can compute probabilities of events like the following:
Select a number at random from the set
S={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Determine the probability that it is even, that is, the number is in the event
E={2, 4, 6, 8}
We assume equally likely outcomes, so the probability of each number is 
Then,
It is no accident that
For an experiment with equally likely outcomes, compute the probability of an event
by counting the number of elements in the event and then dividing by the number of
elements in the sample space. We sometimes call the outcomes in the event successes
and outcomes not in the event failures.

(a) E contains s simple outcomes (successes),

Chapter 7 Probability
Solution
The blue die can turn up in six ways and the white die can turn up in six ways so, by
the Multiplication Rule, there are 6*6=36 ways the two dice can turn up, so
n=36.
Each outcome in the sample space may be thought of as a pair of dice with a pair
of numbers showing. We will identify each pair of dice with a pair of numbers like
(3, 2) where the ﬁrst number, 3, is the number showing on the blue die and the sec-
ond number, 2, is the number showing on the white die. The pairs of dice and num-
bers shown in Figure 7–5 compose the sample space.
We say an 8 is rolled when the two numbers showing add to 8. An 8 may be ob-
tained in ﬁve different ways:
blue die 2, white die 6; that is, (2, 6)
blue die 6, white die 2; that is, (6, 2)
blue die 3, white die 5; that is, (3, 5)
blue die 5, white die 3; that is, (5, 3)

The event is also shown in Figure 7–6.

Random selection or random outcomes imply that individual outcomes in the
sample space are equally likely.
When outcomes are equally likely, the counting methods we encountered in
Chapter 6 can be used to determine the probability of an event.

Solution
The total number of outcomes, n, is C(20, 3), because there is a total of 20 tomatoes.
A success occurs when two tomatoes grown with pesticides and one grown organi-
cally are selected. These can be selected in C(9, 2)*C(11, 1) ways. The probabil-

Here is an example using permutations.
A corporation has eight men and six women on its board of directors. At a stock-
holders’ meeting, seven directors are seated in a row on the platform. The directors
are chosen and assigned a seat in a random manner.
(a) What is the probability that the directors are arranged in a sequence so that
there are men in seats 1 through 3 and women in seats 4 through 7?
(b) What is the probability that the directors are arranged in a sequence so that men
and women alternate seats with a man in seat 1, a woman in seat 2, and so on?
(c) Find the probability that three men are seated together and four women are
seated together in the sequence.
Solution
Because the directors are arranged in a sequence, the order of arrangement is
signiﬁcant.
(a) The number of possible ways to arrange any seven directors in a row is P(14, 7).
(This is the total number of outcomes possible.) The number of successes is the
number of arrangements with three men ﬁrst and four women next in the row.
This can be done P(8, 3)*P(6, 4) ways. Thus, the probability of men in seats
1 through 3 and women in seats 4 through 7 is
=0.007
(b) Again the total number of outcomes is P(14, 7). To ﬁnd the number of successes,
we need to ﬁnd the number of ways in which seven people can be arranged with
P(8, 3) * P(6, 4)
P(14, 7)

lationships often helps to analyze a complex problem by breaking it down into sim-
pler problems. An event that can be described in terms of the union, intersection, or
complement of some events is called a compound event.

THEOREM
Complement
Theorem
E ´ F.
An outcome is in E ´ F if it is in E or in F or in both. The key word for de-
scribing and recognizing E ´ F is or. When the word or is used in mathematics, it
means E or F or both unless stated otherwise. Another way to state that an event is
in E or F is to state that the event is in at least one of them.
The statements
“Find the probability of E ´ F”
“Find the probability that an outcome is in E or F”
“Find the probability that an outcome is in at least one of E and F”
are equivalent statements.
E ¨ F.
An outcome is in E ¨ F if it is in both E and F. A key word for recognizing
and describing E ¨ F is and.
The statements
“Find P(E ¨ F)”
“Find the probability that an outcome is in E and F”
“Find the probability of E and F”
are equivalent statements.
E¿.
An outcome is in E¿ if it is not in E. A key word for recognizing and describing
E¿ is not.
The statements
“Find P(E¿)”
“Find the probability that an outcome is not in E”
“Find the probability that E fails”
are equivalent statements.
Probability of Compound Events
We can sometimes determine the probability of a compound event by using the
probabilities of the individual events making up the compound event.
Probability of E¿
You recognize that if 10% of a class receives an A grade, then 100%-10% = 90%
do not receive an A grade. If of a store’s customers prefer brand A, then 
of the customers do not prefer brand A. These statements are similar to the proba-
bility statement in the following theorem:
For an event E,
P(E¿)=1-P(E)
P(E)=1-P(E¿)
P(E)+P(E¿)=1
where E¿ is the complement of E in the sample space S.

Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 5,pg.528 ■
The area model of probability illustrates the Complement Theorem. In Figure 7–9,
the sample space has area=1, and the event E has area=P(E). If we take E out
of the sample space, we have the complement of E left. We subtract the area of
E, P(E), from the area of the sample space, 1, to obtain the area that remains, P(E¿).
This illustrates that P(E¿)=1-P(E).
You will encounter problems in which it may be difﬁcult to ﬁnd the probability
of an event, but rather easy to ﬁnd the probability of the complement of the event.
If so, the Complement Theorem enables us to more easily ﬁnd the probability of the
event. The following example illustrates this idea.
A branch ofﬁce of a corporation employs six women and ﬁve men. If four employ-
ees are selected at random to help open a new branch ofﬁce, ﬁnd the probability that
at least one is a woman.
Solution
Selection of at least one woman occurs when one woman or two women or three
women or four women are selected.
We count the number of successes by counting the number of ways in which we
can select
one woman and three men.
two women and two men.
three women and one man.
four women.
Because we want the probability that one of these four events occurs, the Addition
Rule applies. We add the number of ways each event can occur and ﬁnd that the
number of successes is
C(6, 1)C(5, 3)+C(6, 2)C(5, 2)+C(6, 3)C(5, 1)+C(6, 4)
We divide this quantity by C(11, 4) to obtain the probability of at least one woman
being selected. You can carry out the above computation if you like, but let’s look at
an easier way.
The only way the company can fail to select at least one woman is to select all
men. That probability is
By the Complement Theorem, the probability of success is 1 minus the probability
of failure. So the probability of at least one woman being selected is

Probability of E ´ F
We use the following example to illustrate a useful theorem to determine P(E ´ F).
In a group of 200 students, 40 take English, 50 take math, and 10 take both. If a stu-
dent is selected at random, the following probabilities hold:
The number 80 in the last equation was obtained by using the Inclusion–
Exclusion Principle from Section 6.2 on sets:
n(E ´ F)=n(E)+n(F)-n(E ¨ F)
If we let S be the group of 200 students, let E be those taking English, and let F be
those taking math, then the preceding equations may be written as
(See Figure 7–10.)
You might wonder why we seem to have complicated the last equation. We want
to illustrate a basic property of probability, so we need to carry the last equation a
little further. We may write
as
The right-hand side of the last equation is
P(E)+P(F)-P(E ¨ F)

THEOREM
P(E ´ F)
This holds even when the outcomes are not equally likely.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 25,pg.529 ■
(a) P(E or F)=P(E ´ F)=P(E)+P(F)-P(E ¨ F)
(b) If the outcomes are equally likely, then
We point out that the preceding example, Example 5, assumes equally likely
outcomes. However, part (a) of the theorem holds in other cases as well.
Let’s look at the area model of probability to illustrate the P(E ´ F) Theorem.
In Figure 7–11a, P(E) is represented by the area of E; in Figure 7–11b, P(F) is
represented by the area of F. When we form E ´ F (Figure 7–11c), the region E ¨ F
occurs in both E and F. So if we add the area of E to the area of F, then the area of
E ¨ F is used twice. To ﬁnd the area of E ´ F, that is, P(E ´ F), we need to subtract
the area in E ¨ F from the sum of areas of E and F. Thus,
Area of E ´ F=area of E+area of F-area of E ¨ F
In terms of the probabilities represented by the areas, we have the P(E ´ F)
Theorem:
P(E ´ F)=P(E)+P(F)-P(E ¨ F)
In a remote jungle village, the probability of a child contracting malaria is 0.45, the
probability of contracting measles is 0.65, and the probability of contracting both is
0.20. What is the probability of a child contracting malaria or measles?
Solution
Notice the information given: P(malaria)=0.45,
P(measles)=0.65,
and
P(malaria and measles)=P(malaria ¨ measles)=0.20. You are asked to ﬁnd
P(malaria or measles)=P(malaria ´ measles).
By the P(E ´ F) Theorem,
P(malaria or measles)=P(malaria)+P(measles)-P(malaria and
measles)
=0.45+0.65-0.20=0.90

DEFINITION
Mutually Exclusive
(Disjoint)
A survey of couples in a certain country found the following:
The probability that the husband has a college degree is 0.65.
The probability that the wife has a college degree is 0.70.
The probability that both have a college degree is 0.50.
A couple is selected at random.
(a) Find the probability that at least one has a college degree.
(b) Find the probability that neither has a college degree.
(c) Find the probability the wife has a college degree and the husband doesn’t.
Solution
Let M represent the event that the husband has a college degree and F the event that
the wife has a college degree.
(a) Then, M ´ F represents the event that at least one of them has a college degree,
and P(M ´ F)=0.65+0.70-0.50=0.85.
(b) The event that “neither has a college degree” is the complement of “at least one
has a college degree,” so
P(neither has a degree)=1-P(at least one has a degree)
=1-0.85=0.15
(c) From the information given, we can draw a Venn diagram (Figure 7–12) with
probabilities entered in the appropriate region. The region that represents the
wife with a degree and the husband without a degree is the region with 0.20
probability.

Mutually Exclusive Events
The P(E ´ F) Theorem might not be helpful in some problems because we might
not know how to compute P(E ¨ F). That will come in the next section. However,
the special situation in which E and F have no outcomes in common can be solved.
Two events E and F are said to be mutually exclusive if they have no outcomes in common.
When two events are mutually exclusive, an outcome in one is excluded from the
other. As sets, E and F are disjoint.
See Figure 7–13.
In case the events E and F are mutually exclusive, the area model of probability
illustrates that P(E ´ F)=P(E)+P(F) (Figure 7–14).

THEOREM
P(E ´ F)
When a coin is tossed, heads and tails are mutually exclusive because each one ex-
cludes the other.
Rolling a 7 with a pair of dice is mutually exclusive with rolling a 9 because they
cannot occur at the same time.
Taking English and taking art are not mutually exclusive because both courses
can be taken if the classes meet at different times.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 11,pg.528 ■
For two mutually exclusive events, the computation of the probability of E or F sim-
pliﬁes because E ¨ F=. Recall that P()=0, so when E and F are mutually
exclusive,
P(E ´ F)=P(E)+P(F)-P(E ¨ F)
becomes P(E ´ F)=P(E)+P(F).
We now restate the P(E ´ F) Theorem, to emphasize this special case of mutu-
ally exclusive events.
For any events E and F,
P(E or F)=P(E ´ F)=P(E)+P(F)-P(E ¨ F)
If E and F are mutually exclusive events, the above reduces to
P(E or F)=P(E ´ F)=P(E)+P(F)
Two people are selected at random from a group of seven men and ﬁve women.
(a) Find the probability that both are men or both are women.
(b) Find the probability that at least one is a man.
Solution
(a) The events “both men” and “both women” are mutually exclusive because the
existence of one excludes the other. Thus,
Example 9
“Four sides” and “rectangle” are not mutually exclusive.
“Triangle” and “square” are mutually exclusive.

(b) The complement of “at least one man” is “two women.” Thus,

If the outcomes are equally likely, P(E or F) can also be stated as

CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY

Multiplication Rule
We have computed the probability of events involving equally likely outcomes by de-
termining the number of outcomes in the event and in the sample space. We have
learned to compute the probability when events are used to form a compound event.
We now turn our attention to some instances when these computations are affected
by a related event or by additional conditions imposed. These may modify the sam-
ple space and thereby change the probability.
Conditional Probability
A simple example in which the probability is adjusted based on additional informa-
tion is the following. Suppose you are taking a test with multiple-choice questions.
A question has four possible answers listed, and you have no idea of the correct an-
swer. If you make a wild guess, the probability of selecting the correct answer is 
However, if you know one of the answers cannot be correct, then your chance of
guessing the correct answer improves because the sample space has been reduced to
three elements. You now choose from three answers, increasing the probability of
guessing correctly to 
We denote this situation by conditional probability. In general terms we describe
conditional probability as follows. We seek the probability of an event E. A related
event F occurs, giving reason to change the sample space and thereby potentially
changing the probability of E.
We say that we want to determine the probability of E given that F occurred and
use the notation P(E |F), which we read “the probability of E given F.”
We can state the multiple-choice question example as “The probability of guess-
ing the correct answer given that one answer is known to be incorrect is ” Or, we
can write P(correct |one answer known incorrect)
If a student guesses wildly at the correct answer from the four given ones, the
sample space consists of the four possible answers. When one answer is ruled out,
the sample space reduces to three possible answers. Sometimes it helps to look at a
conditional probability problem as one in which the sample space changes when cer-
tain conditions exist or related information is given. Let’s look at the following from
that viewpoint.
A student has a job testing microcomputer chips. The chips are produced by two ma-
chines, I and II. It is known that 5% of the chips produced by machine I are defec-
tive and 15% of the chips produced by machine II are defective. The student has a
batch of chips that she assumes is a mixture from both machines. If she selects one
at random, what is the probability that it is defective? You cannot give a precise an-
swer to this question unless you know the proportion of chips from each machine. It
does seem reasonable to say that the probability lies in the interval from 0.05
through 0.15.

Now suppose that the student obtains more information: The chips are all from
machine II. This certainly changes her estimate of the probability of a defective chip;
she knows that the probability is 0.15. The sample space changes from a set of chips
from both machines to a set of chips from machine II. This illustrates the point that
when you gain information about the state of the experiment, you may need to
change the probabilities assigned to the outcomes.
■
Here’s how we write some of the information from the preceding examples.
(a) Machines I and II produce microchips, with 5% of those from machine I be-
ing defective and 15% of those from machine II being defective. This can be
stated as
P(defective chip | machine I)=0.05
P(defective chip | machine II)=0.15
(b) There are four possible answers to a multiple-choice question, one of which is
correct. The probability of guessing the right answer is 
However, if one incor-
rect answer can be eliminated, the sample space is reduced from four to three
answers, and the probability of guessing correctly becomes 
This is stated as

Let’s look at an example of how to compute P(E |F).
Professor Baird teaches two sections of philosophy. The regular section has 35 stu-
dents, and the honors section has 25 students. The professor gives both sections the
same test, and 14 students make an A, 5 in the regular section and 9 in the honors
section.
(a) If a test paper is selected at random from all papers, what is the probability that
it is an A paper?
(b) A test paper is selected at random. If it is known that the paper is from the hon-
ors section, what is the probability that it is an A paper?
Solution
We will refer to Venn diagrams as we work this problem to visualize the solution and
to illustrate some general principles of conditional probability.
In this example, the sample space is the collection of all 60 papers, the event E
is the set of all A papers, and F is the set of papers from the honors class
(Figure 7–15a).

to F (Figure 7–15c), so F becomes the reduced sample space. If the paper se-

from E ¨ F. Because the honors section contains 9 A papers and 25 papers total,
We can express this as

Let’s use a tree diagram to illustrate conditional probability using the honors

We have 60 students divided into two categories, 25 in an honors class
(n(H)=25) and 35 in a regular class (n(R)=35). Each class is divided into two
categories, A and not A papers. The tree diagram in Figure 7–17 shows the number
in each category. We summarize the numbers shown:
n(Honors)=n(H)=25
n(Honors and A)=n(H º A)=9
n(Honors and not A)=n(H º NA)=16

Properties of P(E|F)
THEOREM
Multiplication Rule 
for Conditional
Probability
In Section 7.3 we studied some useful properties of probability. These properties
hold for conditional probability if the conditions are applied consistently. The fol-
lowing are properties that follow from the three theorems of Section 7.3.
P(E |F)+P(E¿ |F)=1
PA[A ´ B]|FB=P(A |F)+P(B |F)-PA(A ¨ B) |FB
If A and B are mutually exclusive events, then
PA(A ´ B) |FB=P(A |F)+P(B |F)
We now can ﬁnd how to compute the probability of E and F, using the Multipli-
cation Rule.
Multiplication Rule
We obtain a useful formula for the probability of E and F by multiplying the equa-
tion (a) in the deﬁnition of conditional probability throughout by P(F):
Multiply by P(F) to obtain
P(F)P(E |F)=P(E ¨ F)
Because
we also have
P(E)P(F |E)=P(E ¨ F)
Thus, we have two forms by which to compute P(E ¨ F).
E and F are events in a sample space S.
P(E and F)=P(E ¨ F)=P(F)P(E | F)
or
P(E and F)=P(E ¨ F)=P(E)P(F | E)
This theorem states that we can ﬁnd the probability of E and F by multiplying
the probability of E by the conditional probability of F given E. Let’s use the area
model of probability again to visualize the Multiplication Rule.
First, look at P(E ¨ F) as the fraction of S occupied by E ¨ F. We would like to
ﬁnd that fraction from information given about E and F.
If we know P(F), we know the fraction of S occupied by F. (If P(F)=0.40,
then F occupies 40% of S in Figure 7–19a). If we know the fraction of F occupied by
E ¨ F, then we know P(E |F). (If E ¨ F occupies 35% of F, P(E |F)=0.35 in
Figure 7–19b). Then, F occupies 40% of S and E ¨ F occupies 35% of F (35% of the
40% occupied by F). So, E ¨ F occupies (0.35)(0.40)=0.14 of S, or E ¨ F occupies
14% of S.
P(F|E) = P(F ¨ E)
P(E)
= P(E ¨ F)
P(E)
P(E|F) = P(E ¨ F)
P(F)

Looking back over these computations, we have computed
P(E ¨ F)=(0.35)(0.40)=P(E |F)P(F)
which is our Multiplication Rule.
Two cards are drawn from a bridge deck, without replacement. What is the proba-
bility that the ﬁrst is an Ace and the second is a King?
Solution
According to the Multiplication Rule for conditional probability, we want to ﬁnd
P(Ace ﬁrst and King second)=P(Ace ﬁrst)*P(King second | Ace ﬁrst)
Because the ﬁrst card is drawn from the full deck of 52 cards,
This ﬁrst card is not replaced, so the sample space for the second card is reduced to
51 cards. As we are assuming that the ﬁrst card was an Ace, there are still four Kings
in the deck. Then,
It then follows that

Here are two examples in which selections are made with replacement. 
Two cards are drawn from a bridge deck. The ﬁrst card is drawn, the outcome is ob-
served, and the card is replaced and the deck shufﬂed before the second card is
drawn. Find the probability that the ﬁrst is an Ace and the second is a King.
Solution
The fact that the ﬁrst card is replaced before the second card is drawn makes this ex-
ample different from Example 5. We still use the Multiplication Rule, but notice the
difference when we compute
P(Ace ﬁrst and King second)
=P(Ace ﬁrst)*P(King second | Ace ﬁrst)
When we compute P(Ace ﬁrst), we get 
just as we did in Example 5.
When the second card is drawn, the deck still contains 52 cards, because the ﬁrst
card drawn was replaced. This gives
We now have
P(Ace ﬁrst and King second)
Be sure you understand how this example differs from Example 5. They both use
the basic property that
P(E ´ F)=P(E)P(F |E)
but replacing the ﬁrst card in this example makes the sample space for the second
draw different from the sample space in Example 5. In Example 5, the sample space
for the second draw contains 51 cards, an Ace having been removed. In this exam-
ple, the sample space for the second draw contains 52 cards because the Ace drawn
ﬁrst was replaced before the second draw occurred.

58. Poker is a card game that is sometimes played for
fun and is sometimes played for thousands of dol-
lars by professional gamblers. Each player is dealt
ﬁve cards (called a hand) and certain combinations
of cards rank higher than others. Here are combi-
nations in the order of rank with the ﬁrst listed be-
ing the hand of highest rank.
Straight ﬂush: Five cards in sequence all in the
same suit.
Example: 3 through 7 in clubs
Ace through 5 in diamonds
10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace in
spades
Notice that the Ace can be used as either the
lowest or highest card of the 13.
Four of a kind: Four cards of the same kind and
one other card.
Example: All four 6’s and a 10
Full house: Three cards of the same kind and
two cards of another kind.
Example: Three 8’s and two Queens
Flush: Five cards of the same suit but not in
sequence.
Example: 2, 3, 6, 9, and King of hearts
Straight: Five cards in sequence but not all in the
same suit.
Example: 2 of hearts, 3 of clubs, 4 of clubs,
5 of spades, and 6 of hearts
Three of a kind: Three cards of the same kind
and two cards of two other kinds.
Example: Three 7’s, a 5, and a Jack
Two pairs: Two cards of the same kind, two 
more cards of a second kind, and one card of a
third kind.
Example: Two 5’s, two 9’s, and an Ace
One pair: Two cards of the same kind and three
cards of three other kinds.
(a) Compute the probability of each of the above
ﬁve-card hands dealt from a well-shufﬂed deck.
(b) If the above hands are ranked properly, they
should be in order of increasing probability,

One evening, Andy tosses a coin to determine which subject he will study. At the
same time across campus, Bill tosses a coin to determine which movie he will see.
Does the outcome of Andy’s toss have any inﬂuence on how Bill’s coin turns up? We

548
Chapter 7 Probability
DEFINITION
Independent Events
have no difﬁculty in stating that whether Andy’s coin comes up heads or tails is ir-
relevant to how Bill’s coin turns up. We say that Andy’s toss and Bill’s toss are inde-
pendent, because the outcome of one toss has no effect on the outcome of the other.
In a similar situation when Andy tosses a coin twice, the fact that it turns up heads
on the ﬁrst toss has no effect on whether the second toss turns up heads. The out-
come of the ﬁrst toss is independent of the outcome of the second toss.
Generally speaking, sometimes the occurrence of an event E affects whether or
not an event F will occur. In other cases, the occurrence of an event E has no effect
whatever on the occurrence of event F. If one person selects a card from one deck
and another person selects one from another deck, then an Ace (or any other card)
drawn from the ﬁrst deck has no effect on whether or not a King is drawn from the
second deck. If two people select one card each from the same deck, then the out-
come of the ﬁrst selection affects the outcome of the second person’s selection be-
cause the ﬁrst card drawn is excluded as a possible outcome of the second selection.
In this case, the outcome of the second person’s draw is not independent of the ﬁrst
draw, so we call the two draws dependent.
People often confuse independent with mutually exclusive. They are not the
same. Mutually exclusive indicates that two events have no outcomes in common.
Events are independent when their probabilities relate in a deﬁnite way. In fact, mu-
tually exclusive events with nonzero probabilities are always dependent, whereas
events having outcomes in common may or may not be independent.
Two events are independent when knowledge of one event provides no infor-
mation on the other event. More precisely, we determine the independence of two
events by how their probabilities relate.
Situations arise in which our intuition may not be able to decide if two events are
independent or not. We have a means to help in those situations. Again, we appeal
to our intuition to make a general deﬁnition.
If two events E and F have no effect on the occurrence of each other, we intuitively
expect that the occurrence of F has no effect on the probability that E occurs, and 
vice versa. In terms of probability, this means that P(E |F)=P(E). Similarly,
P(F |E)=P(F). This leads to the following deﬁnition of independence.
The events E and F are independent if
P(E | F)=P(E)
or
P(F | E)=P(F)
Otherwise, E and F are dependent. (Note: If P(E | F)=P(E), then P(F | E) = P(F)
also holds, and vice versa.)
In the next example, we check P(E|F) and P(E) for two situations, one in
which intuition suggests that the events are independent and one in which intuition
suggests that the events are dependent.
Two children play with three toys, a red, a green, and a blue one. We denote the toys
by the set {R, G, B}. We consider two situations.
(a) Each child selects a toy with the ﬁrst toy replaced before the second one is
selected.
(b) Each child selects a toy with the ﬁrst toy not replaced before the second one is
selected.
Example 1

7.5
Independent Events
549
In each situation, determine if the events “ﬁrst toy is red” and “second toy is
green” are independent or not. Do so by comparing P(second is green) with P(sec-
ond is green |ﬁrst is red).
Solution
We will use tree diagrams to help analyze this problem. The ﬁrst stage of the tree di-
agram represents the possible selections by the ﬁrst child and the second stage rep-
resents the possible selections by the second child.
(a) In this case, three outcomes are possible for the ﬁrst selection, and for each of
these selections, three possible outcomes exist for the second selection (Fig-
ure 7–20a). This gives a total of nine possible sequences of selection. To check
the independence of selecting R ﬁrst and G second, compare P(G second) and
P(G second |R ﬁrst).
From the tree diagram, we see that three of the nine branches have G as the
second selection. Thus,
To ﬁnd P(G second | R ﬁrst), we focus only on the part of the tree where the ﬁrst
branch is red (Figure 7–20b). We see that one of the three branches has green as
the second selection, so
Intuitively, we expected that “R ﬁrst” and “G second” would be independent.
We have further veriﬁed our intuition by ﬁnding P(G second)=P(G sec-
ond |R ﬁrst). We point out that we can also verify independence by comparing
P(R ﬁrst) and P(R ﬁrst | G second).
(b) Intuitively, we expect that “R ﬁrst” and “G second” will be dependent. Again,
we compare P(G second) with P(G second | R ﬁrst).
Figure 7–21a shows the possible sequence of selections, six in all. Observe
that two of the six branches have G as the second selection, so
To determine P(G second | R ﬁrst), we focus on the part of the tree where the
ﬁrst branch is R (Figure 7–21b). One of the two possible sequences has G as the
second selection, so
P(G second)
is not equal to P(G second | R ﬁrst)
so we conclude that
“G second” and “R ﬁrst” are dependent.
■
In Example 1, our intuition and the probabilities behaved in a way that was consis-
tent with the deﬁnition of independent events. Now we go to an extreme and look at
an example in which our intuition gives no indication of whether or not two events
are independent.

A survey of 100 psychology majors revealed that 25 had taken an economics course
(E), 35 had taken a French course (F), and 5 had taken both economics and French
(E ¨ F). Are the events “had taken economics” and “had taken French” independ-
ent or dependent?
Solution
It is helpful to draw a Venn diagram of this information (see Figure 7–22). The sam-
ple space contains 100 elements, E contains 25, F contains 35, and E ¨ F contains 5.
From the Venn diagram, we get the following probabilities:
As P(E) Z P(E |F), E and F are dependent. We could reach the same conclusion
by the observation that P(F) Z P(F |E).

Next we look at an example in which two events are independent, but our intuition
provides no help in making that determination. We must ﬁnd P(E) and P(E |F) and
see whether they are equal or not.
A survey of 165 students revealed that 60 had read John Grisham’s latest book, 22 had
read Tom Clancy’s latest book, and 8 had read both. Determine if the events “read
Grisham’s book” (G) and “read Clancy’s book” (C) are independent or not.
Solution
We visualize this information with a Venn diagram (Figure 7–23) and compareP(G)
with P(G |C). We could use P(C) and P(C |G) just as well. As an area, P(G) is the
fraction of S that is occupied by G. Because n(G)=60 and n(S)=165,
(Figure 23b).
For P(G |C), C becomes the sample space and G ¨ C the event, so
(Figure 23c).
Because 
the events “read Grisham” and “read Clancy” are
independent.
■
These examples illustrate that sometimes our intuition correctly tells us whether or
not two events are independent, and sometimes it does not tell us. The best way to
tell is to compute P(E) and P(E |F) and see whether they are equal or not.
Now, let’s use the area model of probability to make a general statement of what
we did in Examples 2 and 3.
To determine the independence of events E and F, we compare P(E) and
P(E |F). We use the area of E in Figure 7–24a to determine P(E). P(E) is the frac-
tion of S occupied by E. For P(E |F), we determine the area of F occupied by E. As
only those elements of E that are also in F can occupy space in F, you recognize this
as the area of F occupied by E ¨ F (Figure 7–24b).
The events E and F are independent when the fraction of S occupied by E is
equal to the fraction of F occupied by E ¨ F.

Chapter 7 Probability
Multiplication Rule for Independent Events
When E and F are independent events, the Multiplication Rule P(E ¨ F) =
P(E)P(F |E) simpliﬁes to the following.
If E and F are independent events, then
P(E and F)=P(E ¨ F)=P(E)P(F)
We can also use this theorem to determine whether two events are independent.
For the events in Example 2,
As P(E ¨ F) Z P(E)P(F), E and F are not independent—the same conclusion we
reached by using the deﬁnition of independent events.
Although it may be intuitively clear that two tosses of a coin are independent, in
other situations independence may be determined only by using the deﬁnition of 
independent events or the Multiplication Rule for independent events (as in Exam-
ple 2). Actually, any one of the three conditions provides a test for independence.
If any one of the following holds, then events E and F are independent.
1.
P(E |F)=P(E)
2.
P(F |E)=P(F)
3.
P(E ¨ F)=P(E)P(F)
Now let’s look at the relation between independent events and mutually exclu-
sive events.
A card is selected at random from the following four cards: 10 of diamonds, 10 of
spades, 8 of hearts, and 6 of clubs. Let E be the event “select a red card” and let F
be the event “select a 10.”

Note: Diamonds and hearts are red cards; spades and clubs are black cards.
Solution
(a) E and F are not mutually exclusive because selecting a red card and selecting a

(b) From the information given,

E and F are independent.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 11,pg.560 ■
This example illustrates two points:
1.
Two independent events need not be mutually exclusive. In fact, mutually
exclusive events with nonzero probabilities are always dependent. (See Exer-
cise 46.)
2.
Sometimes the only way to determine whether events are independent is to
perform the computation in the tests for independence.
We can now compute the compound probability, P(E ¨ F), by using the prop-
erties of P(E |F) for independent events and the Multiplication Rule for indepen-
dent events.
Ms. Bowden brought two bags of cookies to her second-grade class. The ﬁrst bag
contained 10 chocolate chip cookies and 14 oatmeal cookies. The second bag con-
tained 8 peanut butter cookies and 12 sugar cookies. A student took one cookie from
the ﬁrst bag, and another student took one cookie from the second bag. Find the
probability that the ﬁrst was a chocolate chip cookie and the second was a sugar
cookie.
Solution
Because the cookies were taken from different bags, the events are independent, so
P(ﬁrst chocolate chip and second sugar)=

THEOREM
Union of
Independent Events
Recall that P(E ´ F)=P(E)+P(F)-P(E ¨ F). When E and F are inde-
pendent, P(E ¨ F)=P(E)P(F), so we can substitute for P(E ¨ F) to obtain the
following theorem:
When E and F are independent,
P(E ´ F)=P(E)+P(F)-P(E)P(F)
In some problems, you have the choice of more than one approach to solving the
problem. We illustrate with the following example.
Jack and Jill work on a problem independently. The probability that Jack solves it is
and the probability that Jill solves it is 
What is the probability that at least one
of them solves it?
Solution
We will show you three ways to work this problem:
Case I:
Using the Union of Independent Events 
Case II:
Using the Complement Theorem (Section 7.3)
Case III:
Using mutually exclusive events
Case I: If we let A=the event that Jack solves the problem and B=the event
that Jill solves the problem, then A ´ B is one or both (at least one) solves the prob-
lem. From the Union of Independent Events Theorem in this section,
Case II: The complement of “at least one solves the problem” is “neither solves
the problem,” so
P(at least one solves)=1-P(neither solves)
by the Complement Theorem (Section 7.3). This is
Case III: At least one of them solving the problem is equivalent to exactly one
of them solving the problem (E) or both of them solving the problem (F). These
events, E and F, are mutually exclusive, so

Let’s illustrate some of these concepts using a tree diagram.
The city council has money for one public service project: a recreation–sports com-
plex, a performing arts center, or a branch library. The council polled 200 citizens for
their preference, 120 men and 80 women. The men responded as follows: 45% pre-
ferred the recreation–sports complex, 20% the performing arts center, and 35% the
branch library. The women responded as follows: 15% favored the recreation–sports
complex, 40% the performing arts center, and 45% the branch library.
(a) Represent this information on a tree diagram.
(b) What is the probability that a person selected at random prefers the performing
arts center?
(c) What is the probability that a person selected at random is a woman who prefers
the performing arts center or the branch library?
(d) Are the events “male” and “prefers the recreation–sports complex” inde-
pendent?
Solution
Use the following abbreviations: M for male and F for female; RS, AR, and BL for
recreation–sports complex, performing arts center, and branch library, respectively.
The information provided gives the following probabilities:
P(M)=0.6,
P(F)=0.4
P(RS |M)=0.45,
P(AR |M)=0.20,
P(BL |M)=0.35
P(RS |F)=0.15,
P(AR |F)=0.40,
P(BL |F)=0.45
(a) Figure 7–25 shows the tree diagram with this information.
(b) The two branches that terminate at AR are M ¨ AR and F ¨ AR, so
P(AR)=0.6*0.20+0.4*0.40=0.12+0.16=0.28

dent, then P(RS |M) must equal P(RS). As P(RS |M)=0.45 and P(RS) 
0.27+0.06=0.33, the events are not independent.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 33,pg.561 ■
Mutually Exclusive and Independent Events
Sometimes students ﬁnd it difﬁcult to understand the concepts of independent, de-
pendent, and mutually exclusive events. If you determine two events to be depen-
dent, you still might not know whether they are mutually exclusive or not because
two dependent events may or may not be mutually exclusive. Let’s look at some ex-
amples to get a feeling of the concepts.
Nikki and Alice are two students at the university who do not know each other and
have no contact with each other. In such a case, it seems reasonable that Nikki’s de-
cision to take art history or not has no inﬂuence on whether or not Alice takes art
history. We say the events “Nikki takes art history” and “Alice takes art history” are
independent because the probability that one of them takes the course has no
inﬂuence on the probability that the other takes it. On the other hand, both could
take the course, so the events are not mutually exclusive. To be mutually exclusive,
the occurrence of one event must exclude the possibility of the other occurring.
Under different circumstances, as when Nikki and Alice are roommates, it
seems reasonable to think that whether Nikki takes art history or not might
inﬂuence whether or not Alice takes it; that is, the events “Nikki takes art history”
and “Alice takes art history” might be dependent. Even if they are roommates, their
decisions might still be independent, so we need information on the probability of
each person’s decision before we can say.
Even if their decisions are dependent, the events are not mutually exclusive be-
cause both could take art history.
■
Keep in mind that the test for mutually exclusive events is to determine whether or
not the two events can occur at the same time. The test for the independence or de-
pendence of two events depends on how their probabilities are related.
Some people’s eyes become irritated and water when the pollen count rises above a
certain threshold value. A similar reaction occurs when the ozone pollution rises
above a threshold value. The city’s Air Quality Board monitors the pollution levels
and knows that 30% of the days the ozone will be above threshold value, 20% of the
days pollen will be above threshold, and 6% of the days both will be above threshold.
(a) Are the events “ozone above threshold” and “pollen above threshold” mutually
exclusive?
(b) Are the events “ozone above threshold” and “pollen above threshold”
independent?
Example 10
Example 9

558
Chapter 7 Probability
Solution
(a) Both events can occur at the same time. In fact, they occur at the same time 6%
of the time, so the occurrence of one does not exclude the possibility of the
other. They are not mutually exclusive.
(b) To determine independence or dependence, we need to check the probabilities
of the events. One test given earlier in this section is to determine whether
P(ozone pollution)*P(pollen pollution)
is equal to P(both ozone and pollen pollution).
From the given information, we have
P(ozone pollution)*P(pollen pollution)=0.30*0.20=0.06
and
P(both ozone and pollen pollution)=0.06
As these computations are equal, the events are independent.
■
Look at the three situations in Figure 7–26 and determine whether the events are
mutually exclusive and whether they are independent or dependent.
(a) Because E and F overlap, they have outcomes in common, which tells us that
they are not mutually exclusive.
To check for independence, we must compute the probabilities
and
E and F are independent because P(E)*P(F)=P(E ¨ F).
(b) The events E and F are not mutually exclusive, because they have events in
common.

New York City has a population of more than 8 mil-

Thus, we make each person in New York City a “pigeon”
and provide one “pigeonhole” for each number 0, 1, 2, 
. . . up to the maximum number of hairs on a head. Each
person is assigned to the pigeonhole corresponding to
the number of hairs on his or her head. There are more
pigeons than pigeonholes, so at least one pigeonhole
must be shared by two or more people having the same

BAYES’RULE
•
An Application Using a Tree Diagram
Conditional probability typically deals with the probability of an event when you
have information about something that happened earlier. Let’s look at a situation
that reverses the information. Imagine the following:
A club separates a stack of bills for a drawing and places some in box A and the
rest in box B. Each box contains some $50 bills and other bills. At the drawing, a per-
son selects one box and draws a bill from that box. Conditional probability answers
questions such as “If box A is selected, what is the probability that a $50 bill is
drawn?” Symbolically, this is “What is P($50 bill, given that box A is selected)?”
This question assumes that the ﬁrst event (selecting a box) is known and asks for the
probability of the second event.
Bayes’ Rule deals with a reverse situation. It answers a question such as “If the
person ends up with a $50 bill, what is the probability that it came from box A?” This
assumes that the second event is known and asks for the probability of the ﬁrst event.
Bayes’ Rule determines the probability of an earlier event based on information
about an event that happened later.
Let’s look at an example with some probabilities given to see when and how to
use Bayes’ Rule. We will then make a formal statement of the rule.
The student body at a college is 60% male and 40% female. The registrar’s
records show that 30% of the men attended private high schools and 70% attended
public high schools. Furthermore, 75% of the women attended private high schools,
and 25% attended public schools.
Before we go further, let’s summarize this information in probability notation.
We use M and F for male and female, and we abbreviate private and public with PRI
and PUB. Then, for a student selected at random,
P(M)=0.6,
P(F)=0.4
P(PRI |M)=0.3,
P(PUB |M)=0.7
P(PRI |F)=0.75,
P(PUB |F)=0.25

7.6
Bayes’ Rule
565
Figure 7–28 is a tree diagram of this information, with its four branches termi-
nating at M ¨ PRI, M ¨ PUB, F ¨ PRI, and F ¨ PUB. Their respective probabili-
ties are
P(M ¨ PRI)=P(M)P(PRI |M)=0.6*0.3=0.18
P(M ¨ PUB)=P(M)P(PUB |M)=0.6*0.7=0.42
P(F ¨ PRI)=P(F)P(PRI |F)=0.4*0.75=0.30
P(F ¨ PUB)=P(F)P(PUB |F)=0.4*0.25=0.10
We can ﬁnd the probability that a randomly selected student attended a private
school by locating all branches that terminate in PRI and adding the probabilities.
Thus,
P(PRI)=0.18+0.30=0.48
P(PUB)=0.42+0.10=0.52
Notice that in symbolic notation,
P(PRI)=P(M ¨ PRI)+P(F ¨ PRI)
and
P(PUB)=P(M ¨ PUB)+P(F ¨ PUB)
All the above information was developed for reference throughout the example.
Now let’s look at a problem in which Bayes’ Rule is helpful.
Suppose a student selected at random is known to have attended a private
school. What is the probability that the student selected is female; that is, what is
P(F |PRI)? Notice that this information is missing from the above. The deﬁnition
of conditional probability gives
You will ﬁnd both P(F ¨ PRI) and P(PRI) listed above. They were computed, not
given originally. We obtained P(PRI) from the two branches ending in PRI, so
P(PRI)=P(M ¨ PRI)+P(F ¨ PRI)
Thus, we can write
P(F|PRI) =
P(F ¨ PRI)
P(M ¨ PRI) + P(F ¨ PRI)
P(F|PRI) = P(F ¨ PRI)

Chapter 7 Probability
This is one form of Bayes’ Rule. We get a more complicated-looking form, but one
that uses the given information more directly, when we substitute
P(M ¨ PRI)=P(M)P(PRI |M)
and
P(F ¨ PRI)=P(F)P(PRI |F)
to get
This last form has the advantage of using the information that was given directly in
the problem.
We need to observe one more fact before making a general statement. We used
P(PRI)=P(M ¨ PRI)+P(F ¨ PRI). The events M and F make up all the
branches in the ﬁrst stage of the tree diagram, so M ´ F gives all of the sample space
(M ´ F=S). Furthermore, M and F are mutually exclusive. These two conditions
on M and F are needed for Bayes’ Rule.
Now we are ready for the general statement.
Let E1 and E2 be mutually exclusive events whose union is the sample space
(E1 ´ E2=S). Let F be an event in S, P(F) Z 0. Then,

(b)
(c)
Let’s look at some Venn diagrams to help clarify these rules. The events E1 and
E2 divide S into two disjoint parts, and except when F lies completely within E1 or
E2, they divide F into two parts (Figure 7–29).

The conditional probability PAE1| FB can be viewed as the fraction of F that is
covered by E1 ¨ F. Rule (a) states this as
We can also view F as the part of F that is in E1 plus the part in E2, symbolically
stated as
F=AE1 ¨ FB ´ AE2 ¨ FB
Because these two parts are disjoint,
P(F)=PAE1 ¨ FB +PAE2 ¨ FB
Making this substitution in the denominator of rule (a) gives rule (b). Rule (c) then
follows by replacing each term with its equivalent using the Multiplication Rule.
A microchip company has two machines that produce the chips. Machine I produces
65% of the chips, but 5% of its chips are defective. Machine II produces 35% of the
chips, and 15% of its chips are defective.
A chip is selected at random and found to be defective. What is the probability
that it came from machine I?
Solution
Let I be the set of chips produced by machine I and II be those produced by ma-
chine II. We want to ﬁnd P(I | defective). We are given P(I)=0.65, P(II)=0.35,
P(defective |I)=0.05, and P(defective | II)=0.15. We may use the second form of
Bayes’ Rule directly:
Locate all of these computations on the tree diagram in Figure 7–30.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 11,pg.575 ■
Bayes’ Rule is not restricted to the situation in which just two mutually exclusive
events form all of S. There can be any ﬁnite number of mutually exclusive events, as
long as their union is the sample space. A more general form of Bayes’ Rule is the
following:
Let E1, E2, p , En be mutually exclusive events whose union is the sample space S
(they partition S), and let F be any event where P(F) Z 0. Then,

(c)
As with the Bayes’ Rule given earlier, we can represent the general Bayes’ Rule
with a diagram. We do so with E1, E2, and E3.
If we seek PAE2|FB for example, we want the ratio
This ratio can be obtained by using the area of all of F, or by ﬁnding the area of
pieces of F and putting them together (Figure 7–31) as the sum of the parts of F that
are in E1, E2, and E3, symbolically stated as
F=AE1 ¨ FB ´ AE2 ¨ FB ´ AE3 ¨ FB
As these three parts are disjoint,
PAF)=PAE1 ¨ FB+PAE2 ¨ FB+PAE3 ¨ FB
Making this substitution in the denominator of rule (a) gives rule (b). Rule (c) then
follows by replacing each term with its equivalent using the Multiplication Rule.
We ﬁnd it helpful to also represent Bayes’ Rule with a tree diagram. Again we
look at the case of a sequence of two events. The ﬁrst event has three outcomes E1,
E2, and E3 with respective probabilities P(E1), P(E2), and P(E3). The second event
has two outcomes, F and G. The probability of F occurring depends on which ﬁrst
event it follows. We designate this by P(F | E1) if F follows E1, by P(F | E2) if F fol-
lows E2, and by P(F | E3) if F follows E3. We show all of this with the tree diagram

in Figure 7–32. The probability of terminating at an end point (F or G) is shown for
each end point. Now recall that the conditional probability is 
Now look at Figure 7–32 to see how these probabilities are related to the tree
diagram.
Observe that E1 º F follows the branches E1 and then F; E2 º F follows the
branches E2 and then F; and E3 º F follows the branches E3 and then F. We ﬁnd
P(F) by adding the probabilities of terminating at each of these end points.
We summarize the probabilities as follows:
Since F=(E1 º F) ª (E2 º F) ª (E3 º F), it follows that
P(F)=P(E1 º F)+P(E2 º F)+P(E3 º F)
=P(E1) P(F | E1)+P(E2) P(F | E2)+P(E3) P(F | E3)
and so we have Bayes’ Rule:
Visually, P(E1 | F) is the probability of ending at the branch through E1 and F di-
vided by the sum of the probabilities of all branches ending at F.
The next two exercises illustrate some applications of Bayes’ Rule.

the disease, the probability that her child will have the defect is 0.1. If a pregnant
woman does not contract German measles, the probability that her child will have
the defect is 0.01. A child is born with this defect. What is the probability that the
child’s mother contracted German measles while pregnant? Restrict the analysis to
pregnant women.

An Application Using a Tree Diagram
For practicing physicians, much of their work involves diagnosis and treatment of
diseases. For some diseases a diagnosis may be quite elusive. For other diseases, tests
have been developed that greatly assist in diagnosis. However, such tests usually are
not perfect. They may miss when a person actually has a disease and may wrongly in-
dicate the disease when it is not present. Let’s look at some probabilities of a hypo-
thetical disease, the Bad Crud disease.
It is known that the Bad Crud disease affects 1 in 100,000 people. That is, for a 
randomly selected person, the probability the person has Bad Crud is P(BC)  
100,000
1
 0.00001. Likewise, the probability a person does not have Bad Crud is
P(NBC)  1-0.00001  0.99999.
Experience has shown that the test’s accuracy can be characterized by the fol-
lowing probabilities. If a person has Bad Crud, the test so indicates 99% of the time

Chapter 7 Probability
(the test is positive 99% of the time). We can state this as the probability of a posi-
tive test for a person who has Bad Crud is P(P | BC)=0.99. The other 1% of the
time, the test is (falsely) negative, P(N | BC)=0.01. Further, if the person does not
have Bad Crud then the test so indicates (the test is negative) 99.5% of the time; that
is, P(N | NBC)=0.995. Then the other 0.5% of the time the test is (falsely) posi-
tive, so P(P | NBC)=0.005.
We represent these probabilities with a tree diagram in Figure 7–36.
Now let’s calculate some probabilities for a randomly selected person tested.
(a) Find the probability it is a person with Bad Crud and tests positive, P(BC º P).
(b) Find the probability it is a person without Bad Crud and tests negative, 
P(NBC º N).
(c) A person tests positive. Find the probability it is a person with Bad Crud, 
P(BC | P).
(d) A person tests negative. Find the probability it is a person without Bad Crud,
P(NBC | N).
Solution
(a) In the tree diagram, this is the path BC followed by P.
P(BC º P)=P(BC)P(P | BC)=0.00001(0.99)=0.0000099
A small probability indeed.
(b) In the tree diagram this is the path NBC followed by N.
P(NBC º N)=P(NBC)P(N | NBC)=0.99999(0.995)=0.99499005
(c) In this case we want to ﬁnd P(BC | P), so we use Bayes’ Rule:
We found P(BC º P) in part (a), P(BC º P)=0.0000099. We ﬁnd P(P) by
adding the probabilities for those paths that end at P in the tree diagram. That
is, the path through BC and P and the path through NBC and P. From the tree
diagram we get
0.00001(0.99)+0.99999(0.005)=0.00500985
so 
. This indicates that the chances the person
selected has BC is less than two tenths of a percent.
(d) We want to ﬁnd P(NBC | N), so we use Bayes’ Rule:
We use P(NBC º N) from part (b) and ﬁnd P(N) from the tree diagram by
adding the probabilities of those paths that end at N; that is,
which is close to 1. This indicates that the person selected almost certainly does
not have Bad Crud.

Looking at the probabilities obtained in parts (b) and (c), doesn’t it seem reasonable
to conclude that the test for Bad Crud is meaningless? It doesn’t matter if the tests
are positive or negative, the probability of having Bad Crud is pretty small.
We remind you that the probabilities we obtained were for a randomly selected
person. For a randomly selected person, the probability of having Bad Crud is 1 in
100,000 regardless of the test’s outcome. We would expect a low probability that we
found a person with the disease and a high probability we found a person without it.
Thus, there seems little merit in giving this test on a random or routine basis.
Generally, a physician will test for Bad Crud (or other diseases) when symptoms
suggest the patient might actually have Bad Crud, or possibly another disease or two.
We note that sometimes a test is given on a random or routine basis. Some com-
panies and organizations will conduct tests for illegal drug use on a random or rou-
tine basis. When the use of illegal drugs was rare, no one performed random drug
tests; only when illegal drug use became prevalent did random testing take place,
since the probability of illegal drug use had become higher.
Let’s summarize this by using the Bad Crud example. When the probability of
Bad Crud is low, there is little merit in random or routine testing. If the probability
of Bad Crud is relatively high, the merit of random or routine testing increases.
A test is appropriate when a patient demonstrates symptoms that indicate the
presence of Bad Crud—say, 60% of the time. This information indicates the person
is no longer a random selection from the general population. The person becomes a
random selection from the group of people with those symptoms. This changes
P(BC) and P(NBC) to P(BC)=0.60 and P(NBC)=0.40, so the tree diagram
would show 0.60 for the BC branch and 0.40 for the NBC branch. In this case, the
probability that the patient actually has Bad Crud when the test is positive is
This probability indicates a high possibility of BC.
Now, the patient may be in denial and argues the test isn’t perfect so no Bad
Crud exists. Let’s ﬁnd the probability of no Bad Crud when the test is positive, that
is ﬁnd P(NBC | P). We have
which is a low probability that the patient does not have the Bad Crud. Both proba-
bilities support the presence of the Bad Crud.
This example illustrates that the process of random selection is a fundamental
requirement of probability. It also illustrates that, by representing the given infor-
mation in a tree diagram, Bayes’ Rule can be calculated using the key ideas

38. In the practice of medicine, a number of medical
tests are used to detect diseases. For example, tests
are available to test for prostate cancer, AIDS, tu-
berculosis, and so on. These tests are not perfect. A
probability exists that the test will give a false posi-
tive; it will indicate the presence of a disease when
none exists. It may also give a false negative, an in-
dication that the disease is not present when it is in
fact present.
Suppose medical research ﬁnds a test for the
AIDS virus (HIV) that is considered quite accu-
rate. The probability of the test indicating the pres-
ence of HIV virus (positive test) when the virus is
actually present is 0.993. Thus, the probability of a
false negative is 0.007. The test indicates no virus
(negative test) when no virus is actually present
with probability 0.995. Thus, the probability of a
false positive test is 0.005. It is estimated (in 2001)
that a randomly selected person in North America
has a probability of about 0.001 of having the HIV
virus.
(a) Find the probability that a person who tests
positive actually has the HIV virus.
(b) Find the probability that a person who 
tests negative actually does not have the
HIV virus.
(c) A routine physical exam includes this test 
for the HIV virus. If the test is positive, 
indicating the presence of the HIV virus, 
would you suggest further testing or would 
you be convinced that the HIV virus is actu-
ally present?
(d) If the test in a routine exam were negative, 
indicating no HIV virus, would you be con-
vinced no HIV virus was present?

Transition Matrix
We now study a type of problem that uses probability, matrix operations, and sys-
tems of linear equations (you may wish to review those topics). We introduce you to
this type of problem with the following simpliﬁed example.
Sedco Inc. has developed a Quit Smoking program. They ﬁnd that 75% who
complete the program quit smoking and 25% continue to smoke. They realize that
the success of the program depends on the number of long-term nonsmokers, so they
annually follow the participants of the program. They ﬁnd that each year 90% of
smokers continue to smoke while 10% become nonsmokers. Of the nonsmokers,
80% remain nonsmokers and 20% become smokers again. Sedco wants to know the
expected number of nonsmokers after one year, after ﬁve years, and after ten years.
To solve a problem like this, we need to deﬁne some terminology and some ba-
sic concepts. First, the participants can be placed in one of exactly two categories:
they either smoke or do not smoke. We call these categories states.
A state is a category, situation, outcome, or position that a process can occupy at any given
time. The states are disjoint and cover all possibilities. 
For example, the participants are either in the state of being a smoker or in the
state of being a nonsmoker. A patient is ill or well. A person resides in an urban, sub-
urban, or rural location. An employee works part time or full time. In a Markov
process, the system may move from one state to another at any given time. When the
process moves from one state to the next, we say that a transition is made from the
present state to the next state. A participant can make a transition from the smoker
state to the nonsmoker state or vice versa.
A transition matrix can represent the information on the proportion of partici-
pants who smoke and who do not smoke. Let S represent those who smoke and N
represent those who do not:
The entries in the transition matrix are probabilities that a person will move
from one state (present state) to another state (next state) the following year. For
example, the probability that a person who smokes will smoke next year is 0.90. We
get this from the statement “90% of smokers continue to smoke.”
The headings to the left of the matrix identify the present state, and the head-
ings above the matrix identify the state at the next stage. Interpret each entry in the
matrix as follows:
0.90 is the probability that person passes from present state S to state S next; that
is, a smoker remains a smoker.

DEFINITION
Transition Matrix
0.10 is the probability that a person passes from present state S to state N next;
that is, a smoker becomes a nonsmoker.
0.20 is the probability that a person passes from present state N to state S next;
that is, a nonsmoker becomes a smoker.
0.80 is the probability that a person passes from present state N to state N next;
that is, a nonsmoker remains a nonsmoker.
Because each row lists the probabilities of going from that state to each of all possi-
ble states, the entries in a row always add to 1.
A transition matrix is a square matrix with each entry a number from the interval 0 through
1. The entries in each row add to 1.
In the Quit Smoking example, a row matrix may be used to represent the pro-
portion of people in each state. For the example, the matrix [0.25
0.75] indicates
that 25% are in state S and 75% are in state N. The same row matrix may also be in-
terpreted as indicating that the probability of a person being in state S is 0.25 and the
probability of being in state N is 0.75.
We call these row matrices state matrices or probability-state matrices. For each
state, they show the probability of a person being in that state.
Why do we put the information in this form? We do so because we can use ma-
trix operations to provide useful information. Here’s how.
Multiply the state matrix and the transition matrix:
S
N
and the result is
[0.25(0.90)+0.75(0.20)
0.25(0.10)+0.75(0.80)]
S
N
(the state matrix at the next stage)
You should interpret this as follows: In one year, the participants moved from 25%
in S to 37.5% in S and from 75% in N to 62.5% in N.
Let’s look at the tree diagram in Figure 7–39 to help justify these claims.
The ﬁrst stage shows the two possible states, S and N, with the probability of
each. The second stage shows the states and the probability of entering those states.
At the end of each branch is the probability of terminating there.
Notice that two branches terminate in S. We simply add the two probabilities
there to obtain the probability of ending in state S. That probability is
0.25(0.90)+0.75(0.20)=0.225+0.150=0.375
Notice that this is exactly the computation used in the matrix product that gave the
ﬁrst entry in the state matrix for the next stage. The second entry in the state matrix
for the next stage is
0.25(0.10)+0.75(0.80)=0.625

which gives the probability for entering state N as obtained from the tree diagram.
This illustrates how the present state matrix and transition matrix can be used
to obtain the next state matrix.

We apply the same process when there are more than two states.
At the end of each ﬁscal year, the Student Loan Program gathers information on the
payment status of the loans. The loans are divided into three categories: payments
up to date, with payments made within 15 days of the due date considered current
(labeled 0 –15); payments that are 16 to 90 days late (labeled 16 –90); and payments
over 90 days late (labeled 90±). Each year, some of the students change categories
because they get behind in payments or catch up. A study of past years gives the fol-
lowing transition matrix showing the fraction of students that change from one cat-
egory to another or stay in the same category:

(b) Find the percentage in each category three years later.
Solution
At the end of each ﬁscal year, each student loan is in one of three states: paid up
(0 –15), in arrears 90 days or less (16 –90), or over 90 days in arrears (90±). The pres-
ent state matrix is [0.80

Markov Chain
Let’s summarize the ideas of a Markov chain.
A Markov chain, or Markov process, is a sequence of experiments with the fol-
lowing properties:
1.
An experiment has a ﬁnite number of discrete outcomes, called states. The
process, or experiment, is always in one of these states.
2.
With each additional trial, the experiment can move from its present state to
any other state or remain in the same state.
3.
The probability of going from one state to another on the next trial depends
only on the present state and not on past states.
4.
The probability of moving from any one state to another in one step is repre-
sented in a transition matrix.
(a) The transition matrix is square, because all possible states are used for
rows and columns.
(b) Each entry is between 0 and 1, inclusive.
(c) The entries in each row add to 1.
5.
The state matrix times the transition matrix gives the state matrix for the next
stage.
Steady State
A study of Markov processes enables us to determine the probability-state matrix
for a sequence of trials. Sometimes it helps to know the long-term trends of a popu-
lation, of the market of a product, or of political processes. A Markov chain may pro-
vide some useful long-term information because some Markov processes will tend
toward a steady state, or equilibrium. Here is a simple example.
The transition matrix of a Markov process is

It appears that the state matrix is approaching [0.20
0.80] as the sequence of trials
progresses. In fact, that is the case. Furthermore, the state matrix [0.20
0.80] has an
interesting property, which we can observe when we ﬁnd the state matrix for the next
stage:

There is no change in the next state matrix. The process has reached a steady, or
equilibrium, state.
A state matrix X=[p1
p2 p pn] is a steady-state, or equilibrium, matrix for a transition
matrix T if XT=X.
The steady-state matrix for the Quit Smoking problem is 
because an initial
state matrix will eventually approach 
and
This indicates that, as long as the transition matrix represents the smoking practices
of the participants, those practices will stabilize at two thirds smokers and one third
nonsmokers.

Finding the Steady-State Matrix
Let’s show how to ﬁnd the steady-state matrix of the Quit Smoking problem. Let
X=[x y] be the desired, but unknown, steady-state matrix. We want to ﬁnd x and
y such that
The matrix product on the left gives
[0.90x+0.20y
0.10x+0.80y]
so
0.90x+0.20y=x
0.10x+0.80y=y
which is equivalent to
0.10x+0.20y=0
0.10x-0.20y=0
Since these two equations are equivalent, we can drop one of them.
Because [x
y] is a probability matrix, we must have x+y=1. This, together
with the previous equation, gives the system
x+
y=1
0.10x+0.20y=0
If we use an augmented matrix to solve this system, we have
which reduces to
so x= , y= gives 

general.

DEFINITION
Regular Matrix
Let’s look at the steady-state situation with two states, and thus a 2*2 transition
matrix, to see how the steady-state solution can be reduced to a linear equation. We
use the transition matrix
from Example 6.
The steady-state solution is found by solving the system
In a steady-state problem with two states, the ﬁrst equation always appears,
and the other equations (like the last two equations here) are always equivalent.
Thus, x and y are related with y=1-x. The steady-state solution can be 
found by substituting x=t and y=1-t into one of the last two equations.
Using the middle equation, we have 0.76t+0.08(1-t)=t, which reduces to
0.32t-0.08=0, which gives t=0.25 and 1-t=0.75. The steady-state solution
then is [0.25
0.75]. This procedure can be used when solving a two-state problem
with a 2*2 transition matrix.
It is sometimes important to know whether a Markov process will eventually
reach equilibrium. In Examples 5 and 6 we found the steady-state matrix. It happens
to be true in those cases that we will eventually reach the steady-state matrix after a
sequence of trials, regardless of the initial state matrix. Although this is not true for
all transition matrices, there is a rather reasonable property that ensures that a
Markov process will reach equilibrium. We call transition matrices with this prop-
erty regular. A regular Markov process will eventually reach a steady state, and its
transition matrix has the following property:
A transition matrix T of a Markov process is called regular if some power of T has only pos-
itive entries.
A regular transition matrix is useful because it deﬁnes a Markov process that
eventually reaches a steady state.
is regular because its ﬁrst power contains all positive entries.
is regular because

Statistics
When the president of the United States submits an annual budget to
Congress in the trillion-dollar range, many taxpayers ask, “Where is all that
money going?”But few of them wish to be handed a detailed budget a foot
thick.They want the information summarized in a few broad categories such
as defense, Social Security, education, agriculture, interest on the debt, and so
on. Meanwhile, the president might want to know how the voters react to
speciﬁc budget items such as defense and Social Security budgets.To poll all
voters regarding their opinion of,for instance,the defense budget is impracti-
cal. However, the president can obtain valuable, although incomplete, infor-
mation on voter opinion by a sample opinion poll.
“How did your class do on the ﬁnite exam?”and “How were the grades on
the test?”are questions often asked by faculty and students after an exam.No
one expects a response that includes a list of all the students’ grades. Faculty
want a response that indicates how well the class understood the material,
and the students want to compare their performance with others in the class.
On other occasions, a faculty member may wish to know if the students un-
derstood the concepts appropriate to a speciﬁc problem.
In these cases, the relevant information from all of the tests needs to be
summarized in a form that conveys the desired information without going
into great detail.
The exam summary and the president’s budget summary are examples of
applying descriptive statistics.Descriptive statistics summarize data and de-
scribe their more relevant features.
The sample poll,on the other hand,falls into the category of inferential sta-
tistics. Inferential statistics make generalizations or draw conclusions from
representativeinformation.Thischapterpresentssomeofthemethodsusedin

The discipline of statistics provides methods to collect data, organize
them in a meaningful way, and interpret and report conclusions.Because nu-
merous disciplines and organizations depend on statistical analyses, a variety
of statistical methods exist. We ﬁnd statistical specialists in economics, social
sciences, sciences, business, medicine, engineering, governmental agencies,
and education. To collect, interpret, and report statistical data often requires
massive efforts. For example, accurate estimates of unemployment or inci-
dence of crime may be rather easy to determine in a remote county in North
Dakota but difﬁcult to determine for the whole country.This chapter is a study
of some useful statistical methods, mostly dealing with much simpler situa-
tions than those that occur routinely in the larger scheme of things.

Opinion polls and population studies use random samples to obtain information.
Quite often it helps to organize the information in a tabular or visual form. One tab-
ular form may be obtained by grouping similar observations into categories (or
classes).
For example, the Mathematics Department gives a departmental ﬁnal exam in
calculus. The highest possible score on the exam is 160 points. A complete listing of
all exam scores helps the faculty to decide on a grading curve, but a summary like
the following table may give a better picture of the students’ overall performance on
the exam:
We call this kind of summary a frequency table or frequency distribution. We
call the number of observations in a category the frequency of that category. This

frequency table gives the number of students for each 20-point interval of grades. A
range, or interval, of numbers like 101 to 120 or 61 to 80, determines each category.
The frequency table of grades on the calculus exam does not give complete in-
formation. It does not tell us the highest or lowest score made. In fact, it does not tell
the number of students who made any score. It does give general information about
overall performance on the exam.
In some summaries, the categories might not be numerical. For example, we
may summarize the students’ majors by subject at a university with a frequency table
like the following:
This is an example of qualitative data where the data are identiﬁed by nonnu-
meric categories. The cases where data are represented by numerical values are
quantitative data.
A mathematics quiz consists of ﬁve questions. The professor summarizes the per-
formance of the class of 75 students with the following frequency distribution. Each
quiz question determines a different category.

Note
The choice of the
number of categories
and the dollar range
for each category
could be made in
several different ways.
Solution
As the smallest amount is $78 and the largest amount is $191, the numbers cover a
range of 191-78=113. Let’s form ﬁve categories of intervals of equal length. Our
ﬁrst estimate of the interval length is 
We round this to 25 and start the ﬁrst
interval at 75, giving the intervals 75–99, 100 –124, 125–149, 150 –174, and 175–199.
Next, we can make a table that places each number in the appropriate category:
From this table we have the count of each category and obtain the following fre-
quency table:
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 1,pg.609 ■
Stem-and-Leaf Plots
To more orderly organize data into categories, a stem-and-leaf plot can be used. We
do so by breaking the scores into two parts, the stem, consisting of the ﬁrst one or
two digits, and the leaf, consisting of the other digits.
Make a stem-and-leaf plot of the following scores: 21, 13, 17, 24, 48, 7, 31, 46, 44, 39,
9, 15, 10, 41, 46, 33, 24. The second digit becomes a leaf that we list next to its stem.
This process gives a list of second digits corresponding to a stem.
Solution
We use the ﬁrst digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 for the stems, which will divide the data into inter-
vals 0 –9, 10 –19, 20 –29, 30 –39, and 40 – 49.

We can now easily count the frequency of each category. 
Notice that the digits for the leaves are not in order. They can be listed as they
occur in the list.

For the categories, use the intervals 0 – 4, 5–9, and 10 –14.
Solution
Notice that the stem 0 occurs twice, the ﬁrst time for leaves 0 through 4 and the
second time for leaves 5 through 9.
■
Make a stem-and-leaf plot of the following data: 10.1, 9.3, 9.7, 11.4, 12.3, 10.8, 10.7,
10.3, 11.7, and 11.9.
Solution
We can use the ﬁrst two digits for a stem.
The stem-and-leaf plot has the advantage that the original data can be recon-
structed from the plot.

Construction of a Frequency Table
Here are some suggestions for setting up a frequency table.
Construct a frequency table in three steps, as follows:
Step 1.
Choose the categories by which the data will be grouped, for example,
the calculus grades in the 81–100 range. Generally, the categories are determined
by intervals of equal length.

Example 4

Step 2.
Place each piece of data in the appropriate category; for example, sort
the calculus grades and place them in the appropriate category.
Step 3.
Count the data in each category. This gives the frequency of the cate-
gory; for example, perhaps 73 students scored in the 121–140 range.
The classiﬁcation decisions in step 1 make the other two steps mechanical. The
determination of categories can be a two-step decision. First, determine the number
of categories (e.g., eight) and then the range of values that each category covers
(e.g., 61–80, 81–100). No magic formula exists to make these decisions. They
depend on the nature of the data and the message you wish to convey. However,
some generally accepted rules of thumb might help. Just remember, exceptions are
appropriate at times.
1.
Number of categories.
Usually from ﬁve to ﬁfteen. More categories might
be unwieldy, and fewer categories might not distinguish between important
features. Be sensible: Don’t use ﬁve categories to summarize a two-category
situation, such as the male–female breakdown in enrollment. Generally use
a larger number of categories for larger amounts of data and fewer categories
for smaller amounts of data.
2.
Range of each category.
A good guideline for choosing interval length and
bounds is the following:
(a) Find the difference between the largest and smallest observation and di-
vide it by the number of intervals.
(b) Adjust the length obtained to a relatively simple number.
(c) Select a number less than, or equal to, the smallest observation for the
lower bound of the ﬁrst category. Drop down to, say, the ﬁrst multiple of
5 or 10, or whatever number is appropriate for the data.
In summarizing calculus grades on a 160-point test, the interval
80 –99 range might be used as the range of one classiﬁcation. However, a
range of 81–100 could be used just as well.
(d) Be sure to leave no gaps between categories when they might include
some data. Don’t use intervals like $2.00 to $4.00 and $5.00 to $7.00 when
$4.75 is a valid data point.
(e) Place each piece of data in only one category. The category designa-
tions 300 – 400 and 400 –500 leave it unclear where to place 400. Cate-
gory designations like 300 –399 and 400 – 499 clearly indicate where to
place 400.
(f) Use category intervals that make sense for the situation. To summarize
trafﬁc speeds for a trafﬁc study, use intervals like 31–35 and 36 – 40 rather
than 33–38 and 39– 42. Although intervals of equal length are generally
preferred, sometimes different lengths make sense. For example, we
might summarize performance on a test with intervals like 0 –59, 60 –69,
70 –79, 80 –89, and 90 –100 because they represent letter grades.

Visual Representations of Frequency Distributions
Because a picture conveys a more forceful message than a column of numbers, a
visual presentation of a frequency table sometimes provides a better understanding
of the data. We will study two common visual methods: the histogram and the 
pie chart. In each case, the graph shows information obtained from a frequency
table.
Histogram
A histogram is a bar chart in which each bar represents a category and its height rep-
resents the frequency of that category. Figure 8–1 is the histogram of Example 1.
Mark the categories on a horizontal scale and the frequencies on a vertical scale.
The bars are of equal width and are centered above the point that designates the cat-
egory. In this case, a single number forms the category interval. The bars should be
of equal width because two bars with the same height and different widths have dif-
ferent areas. This gives an impression of different frequencies. Thus, the area, not
just the height of the bar, customarily represents the frequency when different bar
widths are used. Sometimes a space is left between bars when using a discrete vari-
able. If the category is deﬁned by an interval (such as 1–5, 6 –10), the bar is located
between the end points of the interval.
The categories in the ﬁrst two examples are discrete; that is, the values in one
category are separated from those in another category by a “gap.” A summary of the
number of correct answers on a quiz uses the possible values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as cat-
egories. There is a jump from 3 to 4; a value of 2.65 is not valid. On the other hand,
GPA scores are not discrete. Any GPA from 0 through 4.0 is valid. There is no jump
from one category to another. In such a case, the data are said to be continuous. For
two different values of continuous data, all values between them are permissible val-
ues of the data. For example, 3.1 and 3.2 are valid values of GPA, as well as any num-
ber between, such as 3.135 and 3.1999.
When continuous data are represented by a histogram, the categories are de-
termined by a range of values like 0 –0.49, 0.50 –1.0, and so on. The next example il-
lustrates the use of a histogram with continuous data.

The university registrar selects 100 transcripts at random and records the GPA 
for each, where all GPAs are rounded to two decimals. The frequency distribution
follows:
The histogram representing this information appears in Figure 8–2. Notice that we
have rotated the histogram so that the bars are horizontal. We did this because the
category labels were too long to ﬁt under a bar.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 12,pg.610 ■
Sometimes a frequency table is summarized with a histogram that uses relative fre-
quency instead of frequency for the vertical scale. Relative frequency counts the
fractional part of the data that belong to a category. Compute relative frequency by
dividing a frequency by the total number in the distribution. For example, the rela-
tive frequency of the 1.00 –1.49 category of Example 6 is 
, because 17 is the fre-
quency of the category and 100 is the total of all frequencies. Relative frequency can
also be stated as a percentage. If the relative frequency of a category is 0.17, then
17% of the scores are in the category.

A histogram sometimes conveys the erroneous impression that there is a nat-
ural break between categories. When continuous data are represented (such as the
heights of 18-year-old males) it may be difﬁcult to tell in which category a measure-
ment should be placed. For example, if 5¿9– divides two categories, a smooth curve
avoids the impression that a person slightly under 5¿9– is distinctly shorter than a per-
son who is 5¿9–. A smooth curve conveys the impression of continuous data better
than a histogram. You can sketch a smooth curve based on a histogram by drawing
it through the midpoints at the top of the bars. (See Figure 8– 4.)

Statistics
A frequency table of the heights of male high school seniors in Ponca City is the
following:
Draw a histogram and a smooth curve representing the data. (See Figure 8–5.)
■
Notice that Figure 8–5 identiﬁes the boundaries of the bars with 61, 63, 65, 67, 69,
and so on. Although this is a simple way to designate category boundaries, you can-
not tell, just by looking at the graph, if the score 69, for example, is in the 67–69 or
the 69–71 category. We use the convention that a boundary point lies in the bar to
its right. Thus, 69 is in the 69–71 category, which is consistent with the frequency
table information.
If one category has boundaries a and b, and the next category has boundaries b
and c, a<b<c, then point b is placed in the category to the right with bound-
aries b and c.
Pie Chart
The second visual representation of data, the pie chart, emphasizes the proportion
of data that falls into each category. You sometimes see a pie chart in the newspaper
that represents the division of a budget into parts. The parts are frequently reported

Jim Dandy has $200 for spending money this month. He carefully prepares the fol-
lowing budget:
Construct a pie chart that represents this budget.
Solution
First, compute the amount in each category as a percentage of the total by dividing
the amount in the category by the total, $200.
We “cut the pie” into pieces that have areas in the same proportion as the per-
centages representing the categories. (See Figure 8–6.) A glance at this pie chart
tells us the relative share of each category. The angle at the center of each slice de-
termines the size of the slice.
For the purpose of this book, you can sketch a pie chart by estimating the size
of slices. If a more accurate drawing is desired, multiply each percentage by 360° to

You might wonder why we have two ways to represent a frequency distribution. The
histogram and pie chart give visual representations of the same information. The his-
togram shows the size of each category in reports on monthly sales, annual gross na-
tional product growth for several years, or enrollment in accounting courses. Use the
pie chart when you wish to show the proportion of data that falls in each category in
cases such as a breakdown of students by home state, a summary of family incomes,
and a percentage breakdown of letter grades in a course.

Histograms
The graph of a histogram may be obtained by the following steps:
1.
Enter data. Enter the scores in the list L1 and their frequencies in L2.
2.
Set the horizontal and vertical scales. Set Xmin, Xmax, Xscl, Ymin, Ymax, and Yscl using 
in the same
way it is used to set the screen for graphing functions.
WINDOW

614
Chapter 8
Statistics
Set Xmin and Xmax so that all scores will be in the interval (Xmin, Xmax). This interval will be the x-axis of the
graph. Xscl is the width of a bar on the histogram and determines the interval length of each category. Ymin and
Ymax determine the range of the frequencies.
3.
Deﬁne the histogram. Press 
<1:PLOT1> 
You will see a screen similar to the following:
On that screen select, as shown in the ﬁgure, <ON>, histogram for Type, L1 for Xlist (the scores), and L2 for fre-
quencies. When you are ﬁnding the histogram for a list of scores, enter the number 1 instead of L2 for Freq. Press
after each selection.

Display the histogram. Press 
Example
Draw a histogram with three categories for the data summarized in the frequency table.
We set the range of the scores as 0 through 15 and the 
length of each category as 5. The frequency range is 0

Using Excel
Histograms and Pie Charts
Both the histogram and the pie chart give a visual representation of data collected in categories. The histogram gives a pic-
ture of the number in each category, and the pie chart gives a picture of the percentage in each category. In EXCEL, both
use the spreadsheet cells listing the number in each category.
Example
Draw the histogram and the pie chart for data with four categories where the numbers in each category are 3, 4, 7, and 2.
Solution
Let’s call the categories A, B, C, and D and enter their frequencies in cells A2:A5. Because the procedure to draw the his-
togram and the pie chart have steps in common, we make just one list while showing which steps differ.
•
Enter the frequencies in A2:A5.
•
Select the cells A2:A5.
•
Select the Wizard icon from the menu bar.
•
Under Chart type select Columns for a histogram and select Pie for a pie chart.
•
Under Chart sub-type, click on the ﬁrst one in the top row.
•
Click Next.
•
Click Next.
•
Select the Data Labels tab from the Chart Option.
For a histogram select the Show label option.
For a pie chart select the Show label and percent option.
•
Click Finish.
Notice that EXCEL labels the categories 1, 2, 3, and 4 with the labels above the bars in the histogram. The labels can be
changed as follows:
For a histogram:
To change the label 1 to A, click on 1 and you will see
. Then click on the 1 and hold until you see
.
Now type A and click somewhere off the histogram. Go to the next label and repeat.

Chapter 8
Statistics
Note
The symbol <= is used for .A2:A12 is the range of the list.
Note
COUNTIF only counts scores less than (or less than or equal) a number,6 in this case,so we count scores  6 and subtract the
number  3.
For the pie chart:
To change the label 1 to A, click on 1 and you will see
. Then click on 1 and hold until you see
.
Now select the 1, 
and type A. Go to the next label and repeat.
Counting Frequencies in a Category
When you have a list of scores or a frequency table, you may need to count the number of scores for each category to use
EXCEL. We illustrate how to do it.
Given a List,Count the Number of Scores in Each Category
Example
For the scores 1, 8, 6, 3, 4, 9, 5, 5, 3, 2, and 5, ﬁnd the number in each of three categories 1–3, 4 –6, and 7–9
Solution
Enter these data in A2:A12. We will place the count for category 1–3 in B2, the count for category 4 –6 in B3, and the
count for 7–9 in B4 using the COUNTIF function to ﬁrst count the scores less than or equal () to 3.
In cell B2, enter =COUNTIF(A2:A12,“<=3”).
For the frequency of category 4 –6, enter into cell B3: =COUNTIF(A2:A12,“<=6”)-B2
For the frequency of category 7–9, enter into cell B4: =COUNTIF(A2:A12,“<=9”)-B3-B2.
Now you can use cells B2:B4 to create the pie chart or histogram.
Given a Frequency Table,Count the Number in Each Category

Which Measure of Central Tendency Is Best?
We have used histograms and pie charts to summarize a set of data. These devices
sometimes make it easier to understand the data.
At times, however, we want to be more concise in reporting information, so that
comparisons can be easily made or so that some important aspect can be described.
You often hear questions like:
“What was the class average on the exam?”
“What kind of gas mileage do you get on your car?”
“What happened to the price of homes from 1977 to 1984?”
Note
The function in C3 counts the scores  12 and subtracts the number  6.
Solution
Enter the scores in cells A2:A9 and the corresponding frequencies in B2:B9. The category counts will be in cells C2:C5.
To count the scores in the 1–6 category, we use the SUMIF function which searches A2:A9 for scores in the 1–6 category
and adds their frequencies from B2:B9.
In C2, enter =SUMIF(A2:A9,“<=6”,B2:B9).
In C3, enter =SUMIF(A2:A9,“<=12”,B2:B9)-C2.
In C4, enter =SUMIF(A2:A9,“<=18”,B2:B9)-C3-C2
In C5, enter =SUMIF(A2:A9,“<=24”,B2:B9)-C4-C3-C2
Now you can use cells C2:C5 to create the pie chart or histogram.

You generally expect a response to questions like these to be a single number
that is somehow “typical” or at the “center” of the exam grades, distance a car is
driven on a certain amount of gas, or price of homes. We will study three ways to ob-
tain such a “central number,” which is called a measure of central tendency.
A measure of central tendency is associated with a population, a collection of
objects, such as a collection of exams, a collection of cars, or a collection of homes.
Each member of the population has a number associated with it, like a grade on an
exam, gas mileage of a car, or the price of a home. We call these numbers data, and
we ﬁnd the measure of central tendency of those numbers. We often use subscripted
variables to enumerate a list of numbers. Thus, x1, denotes the ﬁrst value, x2 denotes
the second value, and xn denotes the nth value.
A sample is a subcollection of a population. Five exam papers form a sample
from the population of 37 students in my ﬁnite mathematics class. A study of obesity
among teenagers could not ﬁnd data on the weight and height of all teenagers. So, es-
timates of teenagers’ weight and height are obtained from representative samples of
teenagers. There are times when it is appropriate to ﬁnd a measure of central ten-
dency of a population, and other times when a sample is used. The measures dis-
cussed in this chapter can be applied to both populations and samples.
The Mean
When we talk about “averages” like test averages, the average price of gasoline, or
a basketball player’s scoring average, we usually refer to one particular measure of
central tendency, the arithmetic mean. To compute the mean of a set of numbers,
simply add the numbers and divide by how many numbers were used.
The population mean of n numbers x1, x2, . . . , xn is denoted by m (the Greek letter mu) and
is computed as follows:
The sample mean, denoted by , (x bar) is
Notice that you calculate the population mean and the sample mean exactly the same. 
The notation m and indicate whether the data came from a population or from a sample.
Common terms for the mean are the average or the arithmetic average.
The Convenience Chain wants to compare sales in its 56 stores during July with
sales a year ago, when it had 49 stores. A comparison of total sales for each July may
be misleading because the number of stores differs. Sales can be down from a year
ago in each of the 49 stores, but total sales can still be up because there are seven ad-
ditional stores. The mean sales of all stores in each year should better indicate
whether sales are improving.

Formula for the

Distribution
Formula for the
Estimated Mean of
Grouped Data
The general formula for the mean of a frequency distribution is as follows:
Given the scores x1, x2, . . . , xk, which occur with frequency f1, f2, . . . , fk, respectively,
the mean is
where n=f1+f2+. . .+fk, the sum of frequencies.
The next example deals with grouped data. Scores are combined into categories,
and the frequency of that category is given.
Professor Tuff gave a 20-question quiz. She summarized the class performance with
the following frequency table:
Estimate the class mean for these grouped data.
Solution
We do not have speciﬁc values of the data, only the number in the indicated category.
To obtain an estimate of the mean, we use the midpoint of each category as the rep-
resentative value and compute the mean by
where 55 is the sum of the frequencies. (Note: The midpoint of an interval is half-
way between the left end point and the right end point of the interval. It can be found
by taking the mean of the left end point and the right end point.)
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 32,pg.625 ■
If data are grouped in intervals with m1, m 2, p , mk, the midpoints of each cate-
gory interval, and f1, f2, p , fk the frequency of each interval, respectively, then, an
estimate of the mean is
where n=f1+f2+. . .+fk, the sum of frequencies.
Notice that the formula for the mean of grouped data looks much like the for-
mula for the mean of a frequency distribution. Why is it repeated? Be sure to notice
the difference. First, we can only estimate the mean of grouped data. Second, the m’s
used in the formula for grouped data are midpoints of the categories. Thus, one
Mean = f1 m1 + f2 m2 +    + fk mk

number is selected to represent a range of numbers in the category. In a frequency
distribution, the x’s represent the actual scores.
The mean is a useful measure of central tendency because
1.
It is familiar to most people.
2.
It is easy to compute.
3.
It can be computed for any set of numerical data.
4.
Each set has just one mean.
The salaries of the Acme Manufacturing Company are
The company has 15 production workers. They complain to the president that com-
pany salaries are too low. Mr. President responds that the average company salary is
about $42,060. He maintains that this is a good salary. The production workers and
the vice-president remain unimpressed with this information, because not a single
one of them makes this much money. Although the president computed the mean
correctly, he failed to mention that a single salary—his—was so large that the mean
was in no way typical of all the salaries. This illustrates one of the disadvantages of
the mean as a number that summarizes data. One or two extreme values can shift the
mean, making it a poor representative of the data.
■
When you summarize a set of data with a histogram, you can visualize the mean in the
following way. Think of the histogram as being constructed from material of uniform
weight, a thickness of plastic or cardboard. If you try to balance the histogram on a
point, you will need to position it at the mean. (See Figure 8–8.)
The Median
Another measure of central tendency, this one not so easily affected by a few ex-
treme values, is the median. When listing data from an experiment according to size,
people tend to focus on the middle of the list. Thus, the median is a useful measure
of central tendency.
The median is the middle number after the data have been arranged in order. When there
is an even number of data items, the median is the mean of the two middle data items.
Basically, the median divides the data into two equal parts. One part contains
the lower half of the data, and the other part contains the upper half of the data.
The median of the numbers 3, 5, 8, 13, 19, 22, and 37 is the middle number, 13. Three
terms lie below 13, and three lie above.

Find the median of the set of numbers 8, 5, 2, 17, 28, 4, 3, and 2.
Solution
First, the numbers must be placed in either ascending or descending order: 2, 2, 3, 4,
5, 8, 17, 28. As there are eight numbers, an even number, there is no middle number.
We ﬁnd the mean of the two middle numbers, 4 and 5, to obtain 4.5 as the median.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 17,pg.624 ■
The set of numbers 2, 5, 9, 10, and 15 has a mean of 8.2 and a median of 9. If 15 is 
replaced by 140, the mean changes to 33.2, but the median remains 9. A change in
one score of a set may make a signiﬁcant change in the mean and yet leave the me-
dian unchanged.
■
The median is often used to report income, price of homes, and SAT scores.
The Mode
The mode is used less often as a measure of central tendency. It is used to indicate
which observation or observations dominate the data because of the frequency of
their occurrence.
The mode of a set of data is the value that occurs the largest number of times. If more than
one value occurs this largest number of times, those values are also modes. When no value
occurs more than once, we say that there is no mode. Thus, a distribution may have one
mode, several modes, or no mode.
The mode of the numbers 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 3, 2, 6, 8, 2, and 9 is 2 because 2 appears more
often than any other value.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 21,pg.624 ■
The set of numbers 2, 4, 8, 3, 2, 5, 3, 6, 4, 3, and 2 has two modes, 2 and 3, because
they both appear three times, more than any other value. The set of numbers 2, 5,
17, 3, and 4 has no mode because each number appears just once.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 23,pg.624 ■
The mode provides useful information about the most frequently occurring cate-
gories. The clothing store does not want to know that the mean size of men’s shirts is

15.289. However, the store likes to know that it sells more size 
shirts than any
other size. The mode best represents summaries where the most frequent response
is desired, such as the most popular brand of coffee.
Which Measure of Central Tendency Is Best?
With three different measures of central tendency, you probably are curious about
which is best. The answer is, “It all depends.” It all depends on the nature of the data
and the information you wish to summarize.
The mean is a good summary for values that represent magnitudes, like exam
scores and price of shoes, if extreme values do not distort the mean. The mean is
the best measure when equal distances between scores represent equal differences
between the things being measured. For example, the difference between $15 and
$20 is $5; the same amount of money is the difference between $85 and $90.
The median is a positional average. It is best used when ranking people or
things. In a ranking, an increase or decrease by a ﬁxed amount might not represent
the same amount of change at one end of the scale as it does at the other. The dif-
ference between the number-one ranked tennis player and the number-two ranked
player at Wimbledon may be small indeed. The difference between the tenth- and
eleventh-ranked players may be signiﬁcantly greater. In contests, in student stand-
ings in class, and in taste tests, numbers are assigned for ranking purposes. However,
this does not imply that the people or things ranked all differ by equal amounts. In
such cases, the median better measures central tendency.
The mode is best when summarizing dress sizes or the brands of bread preferred
by families. The information desired is the most typical category, the one that occurs
most frequently.
In Example 5, we used the following data on salaries:
We saw that the mean of these salaries, $42,060, was a poor representation of
salaries because 16 of the 17 people had lower salaries than the mean. This is an in-
stance of skewed data, in which relatively few values of the data distort the location
of the central tendency. In cases like this, the median, $25,000, is a better measure of
central tendency.

Measurements of Position
A score often has little meaning unless it is compared with other scores. We have used
themeanasonecomparison.Ifyouknowyourtestscoreandtheclassaverage,youcan
comparehowfaryouareaboveorbelowtheclassaverage.However,theaveragealone
doesnottellyouhowmanyintheclasshadgradesclosertotheaveragethanyou.
If two bowlers have the same average, do they have the same ability? If two stu-
dents have the same average in a course, did they learn the same amount? Although
the mean gives a rather simple representation of a set of data, sometimes more in-
formation is needed about how the scores are clustered about the mean in order to
make valid comparisons. Let’s use students’ class averages to illustrate measures of
dispersion.
Each student’s mean is 85. However, student A is more consistent. Student B’s
scores vary more widely. The mean does not distinguish between these two sets of
data. As this example shows, two data sets may have the same mean, but in one set
the values may be clustered close to the mean, and in the other set the values may be
widely scattered. To say something about the amount of clustering as well as the av-
erage, we need more information.
Range
One way to measure the dispersion of a set of scores is to ﬁnd the range, the distance
between the largest and smallest scores. The range is 12 for student A and 33 for stu-
dentB, so the range suggests thatA’s scores are clustered closer to the mean; the mean
is thereby a better representation of A’s scores than of B’s scores. For grouped data,
like a frequency table or histogram, the range is the difference between the smaller
boundary of the lowest category and the larger boundary of the highest category.
Here are two frequency tables:

Measures of Dispersion:Range,Variance,and Standard Deviation
631
Theestimatedmeanforeachis6.15(usingthegroupeddatamean),andtherange
for each is 9. Clearly, the scores in Table II are clustered near the mean, whereas they
tend to be more extreme in Table I. The range gives information only about the ex-
treme scores and gives no information on their cluster near the mean.
The range, the difference between the largest and smallest scores, is a simple
measure of dispersion, but sometimes it helps to know whether the numbers are
scattered rather uniformly throughout the range or whether most of them are
clustered close together and a few are near the extremes of the range. For example,
suppose a company manufactures ball bearings for an automobile company. The
automobile company speciﬁes that the bearings should be 0.35 inch in diameter.
However, the automobile company and the bearing manufacturer both know that it
is impossible to consistently make bearings that are exactly 0.35 inch in diameter.
Slight variations in the material, limitations on the precision of equipment, and
human error will create deviations from the desired diameter. So, the automobile
company speciﬁes that the bearings must be 0.35 ; 0.001 inch in diameter. The di-
ameter may deviate as much as 0.001 inch from the desired diameter; that is, the ac-
ceptable range of diameters is 0.349 to 0.351. If the manufacturer produces a batch
of bearings with all diameters in the range 0.3495 to 0.3508 inch, then there is no
problem, because all of them are acceptable. However, if the diameters range from
0.347 to 0.353, there may or may not be a problem. Generally, they expect a few un-
acceptable bearings. If 90% of the bearings are unacceptable, then major problems
exist in the manufacturing process. If fewer than one half of 1% are unacceptable,
then the process may be considered satisfactory.
In this situation, a measure of how a batch of bearings varies from the desired
diameter, 0.35 inch, provides more useful information than the largest and smallest
diameters. With this situation in mind, we now look at two other useful indicators of
variation.
Variance and Standard Deviation
A widely used measure of dispersion is the standard deviation. A related indicator,
the variance, is another. These indicators measure the degree to which the scores
tend to cluster about a central value, in this case the mean. The variance and stan-
dard deviation give measures of the distance of observations from the mean. They
are large if the observations tend to be far from the mean and small if they tend to
be near the mean. Even when all scores remain within a certain range, the variance
and standard deviation will increase or decrease as a score moves away from or
closer to the mean.
Because the computation of the standard deviation is more complicated than
that of  the mean and the range, we will use the example of student A and student B
to go through the steps to compute the variance and standard deviation.
Step 1.
Determine the deviation of each score from the mean. Compute these de-
viations by subtracting the mean from each score. The following computations show
the deviations for student A and student B using the mean of 85 in each case. Notice
that the deviations give the distance of the score from the mean a positive value for
scores greater than the mean and a negative value for those less than the mean. You
should also notice that the deviations add to zero for both students. This always
holds. The deviations will always add to zero. For this reason, we cannot accumulate
the deviations to measure the overall deviation from the mean.

Step 2.
Square each of the deviations. These are shown under the heading
“squared deviation.”
This process of squaring the deviations allows us to accumulate a sum that is
large when the scores tend to be far away from the mean. To adjust for cases in which
two sets of data have different numbers of scores, we ﬁnd a mean as in the next step.
Step 3.
Find the mean of the squared deviations. For student A, the sum of 
the squared deviations is 88, and their mean is , which equals 17.6. For student 
B, the sum of the squared deviations is 818, and their mean is 
, which equals 163.6.
The number 17.6 is the variance for student A, and 163.6 is the variance for
student B.
Step 4.
Find the square root of the means just obtained. For student A, we have
For student B, we have 
These numbers are standard
deviations. By tradition, the symbol s (sigma) denotes standard deviation, and s2
denotes variance. Thus, for student A, s=4.20, and for student B, s=12.79. The
standard deviation measures the spread of the values about their mean. Student B
has the larger standard deviation, so her grades are more widely scattered. The
grades of student A cluster closer to the mean.
A formal statement of the formula for variance and standard deviation is the
following:
Given the n numbers x1, x2, p , xn whose mean is m, the population variance, de-
noted S2, and population standard deviation, S, of these numbers is given by:
Both the variance and the standard deviation measure the dispersion of data.
The variance is measured in the square of the units of the original data. The standard
deviation is measured in the units of the data, so it is usually preferred as a measure
of dispersion.

No practical way exists to enable Congress to survey the total population of
the United States regarding proposed legislation on the death penalty. However,
valuable information can be obtained from a well-planned, representative sample of
the population. From the sample, reasonable estimates can be made regarding the
population as a whole. We have already seen that the population mean (when possi-
ble) and the sample mean, as an estimate of the population mean, use the same for-
mula. Statisticians have found that variance and standard deviation calculated using
n-1 as the divisor for the sample variance and standard deviation gives a better es-
timate than using n. Consequently, the sample variance and standard deviation use
the following formulas:
Given the n numbers x1, x2, . . . , xn whose mean is x–, the sample variance, denoted by s 2,
and sample standard deviation, s, of these numbers is given by 
Unless otherwise stated, variance and standard deviation refer to population

Note: When asked to ﬁnd a standard deviation, ﬁnd the population standard devia-
tion unless instructed to ﬁnd the sample standard deviation.
You do not expect to compute a standard deviation during your daily activities.
Yet on an intuitive level, all of us are interested in standard deviation. For example,
you can recall a trip to the grocery store when you selected the shortest checkout line,
only to ﬁnd that it took longer than someone who got in a longer line at the same time.
Let’s look at the situation from the store’s viewpoint. The store’s managers are inter-
ested in customer satisfaction, so they work to reduce waiting time. They proudly an-
nounce that, on the average, they check out a customer in 3.5 minutes. The customer
might agree that 3.5 minutes is good service, but an occasional long wait might make
thecustomerquestionthestore’sclaim.Basically,thecustomerwantsthewaitingtime
to have a small standard deviation. A small standard deviation indicates that you ex-
pect the waiting time to be near 3.5 minutes per customer.
A restaurant uses a different system of waiting lines. Customers do not choose a
tableandlineupbesideit. Allcustomerswaitinasinglelineandaredirectedtoatable
as it becomes available—and for a good reason. Diners do not want someone stand-
ing over them waiting for them to ﬁnish eating.
If we ignore the psychology of lining up at someone’s table, which of these two sys-
tems is better? Is it better to let the customer choose one of several lines or to have a
singlelineandallowacustomertogotoastationasitbecomesavailable?Bothsystems
are reasonable in a bank. One bank may use a system where the customer chooses the
teller, and a line forms at each teller. Another bank may use a system where the cus-
tomers wait in a single line, and the customer at the head of the line goes to the next
available teller. It turns out that the average waiting time is the same under both

systems. Thus, from the bank’s viewpoint, both systems allow it to be equally efﬁcient.
But it also turns out that the single-line concept tends to decrease the standard devia-
tion and thereby reduce the extremes in waiting times. More customers will be served
near the average waiting time than under the multiple-line system. Thus, from the cus-
tomer’s viewpoint, the single-line concept is better because it helps reduce an occa-
sionallongdelay.As thebank’sefﬁciencyisthesameinbothcases,managementwould
do well to adopt the single-line concept.
Measurements of Position
Scores are generally meaningless by themselves. “We scored ten runs in our softball
game” gives no information about the outcome of the game unless the score of the
opponent is known. A grade of 85 is not very impressive if everyone else scored 100.
Themean,median,andmodegiveacentralpointofreferenceforascore.You can
compare your score to the mean or median and determine on which side of the cen-
tral point your score lies.
We now look at other measures of position that prove useful.
One familiar measurement of position is the rank. A student ranks 15th in a class
of 119; a runner places 38th in a ﬁeld of 420 in the 10-kilometer run; a girl is the
fourth runner-up in a beauty contest. Your rank simply gives the position of your
score relative to all other scores. It gives no information on the location of the cen-
tral point or on how closely scores are clustered around it.
If you took the SAT test, you received a numerical score and a percentile score,
another positional score. A score at the 84th percentile states that 84% of people tak-
ing the test scored the same or lower and 16% scored higher. A score at the 50th per-
centile is a median score: 50% scored higher and 50% scored the same or lower. The
percentile score is used as a positional score when a large number of scores is in-
volved. In addition to the 50th percentile (the median), the 25th and 75th percentiles
are often used to give information on the dispersion of data.
(a) A golfer is ranked 22nd in a ﬁeld of 114 players. What is his percentile?
(b) A golfer is at the 75th percentile in a ﬁeld of 68. What is her rank?
Solution
(a) As the golfer is ranked 22nd, there are 114-22=92 players ranked lower.
Counting the golfer himself, there are 93 ranked the same or lower. The per-
centile is 
which we round down to 81st percentile.
(b) As 75% are ranked the same or lower, there are 0.75*68=51 players ranked
the same or lower and 17 ranked higher. We say that she is ranked 18th.

Another standard score is the z-score. It is more sophisticated than rank or per-
centile because it uses a central point of the scores (the mean) and a measure of dis-
persion (the standard deviation). It is useful in comparing scores when two different
reference groups are involved. The z-score is
z =
score - mean

For a score of 70,
A negative z-score indicates that the score is below the mean. z=1.4 indicates that
the score is 1.4 standard deviations above the mean. A z-score of 0 corresponds to
the mean.

Application
A student took both the SAT and ACT tests and made a 480 on the SAT verbal por-
tion and a 22 on the ACT verbal. Which was the better score? (Note: You need to
know that for the SAT verbal test, m=431 and s=111; and for the ACT verbal,
m=17.8 and s=5.5.)
Solution
The z-score for each test is
The higher z-score, 0.76, indicates that the student performed better on the ACT, be-
cause the ACT score was more standard units above the mean.

Five-Point Summary and Box Plot
We have used range and standard deviation to help understand the dispersion of
data. Sometimes, we may want more detail about the dispersion. One method that
provides such detail is the ﬁve-point summary and its visual representation, the box
plot, also called the box-and-whisker plot.
We have already discussed three of the ﬁve points used to describe data:
Minimum: The smallest value in the data.
Median: The value in the middle of the data (when they are arranged in order).
Maximum: The largest value in the data.
Two other points that give information on the dispersion of data are the ﬁrst
quartile, Q1, and the third quartile, Q3.

data.
The ﬁrst quartile, denoted Q1, is the median of the values less than the median of the data
(median itself excluded). It separates the lower 25% of the data from the upper 75%.
The third quartile, denoted Q3, is the median of the values greater than the median of the
data (median itself excluded). It separates the upper 25% of the data from the lower 75%.
The second quartile, denoted Q2, is the median of all the data.

A general, and conservative, estimate of how data are
clustered about the mean is given by Chebyshev’s
Theorem:
Chebyshev’s Theorem
The fraction of scores of any set of data lying within
k standard deviations of the mean is always at least 
1-
, where k is greater than 1. For example, for 
k=2, at least 1-1/4=3/4 of the scores must
lie from 2 standard deviations below the mean to 2
standard deviations above the mean.
63. Use Chebyshev’s Theorem to ﬁnd the fraction of

The mean for this sample of earnings is $739 and
the standard deviation is $290.
(a) Chebyshev’s Theorem states that at least 
75% of the earnings listed will fall between
739-2(290)=159 and 739+2(290)=
1319. Count the number in the list that fall in
that interval. Is your answer consistent with
Chebyshev’s Theorem?
(b) Chebyshev’s Theorem states that at least 
56% of the earnings listed will fall between
739-1.5(290)=304 and 739+1.5(290)=
1174. Count the number in the list that fall in
that interval. Is your answer consistent with
Chebyshev’s Theorem?
Another rule that relates the standard deviation to the
clustering about the mean is the empirical rule. This rule
often applies to data that arise from natural causes, such
as weights of 10-year-old children, waist sizes of adult
men, and IQ scores. The empirical rule applies to these
and other data that fall into a bell shaped pattern.

Empirical Rule
For data that are approximately bell shaped:
•
About 68% of all scores fall within 1 standard
deviation of the mean.
•
About 95% of all scores fall within 2 standard
deviations of the mean.
•
About 99.7% of all scores fall within 3 stan-
dard deviations of the mean.
66. A set of scores is reasonably bell shaped. The mean
is 124, and the standard deviation is 8.
(a) What percentage of the scores should fall be-
tween 116 and 132?
(b) What percentage of the scores should fall be-
tween 108 and 140?
67. In the table of earnings in Exercise 65, count the
scores that fall within one standard deviation of the
mean. Compare this with the 68% from the empiri-
cal rule. Does this suggest that the earnings data
are bell shaped?
68. For a given set of data, which would you expect to
be larger: the sample variance or the population
variance?
Using Your TI-83/84
In Section 8.2, we used functions from the LIST menu to ﬁnd the mean and median of data. The STAT menu has func-
tions that calculate the measures of dispersion in this section. The mean and median are also calculated, so you have two
routines that calculate mean and median.
Calculating the Range
The range of a list of scores in L1 can be found using the max and min functions in the LIST menu. Here’s how. 
<MATH> <2:max(> L1-<1:min(> L1 
.
Calculating the Mean and Standard Deviation
The TI-83/84 has a routine in the STAT menu for calculating the mean and standard deviation for a list of numbers or for
numbers summarized in a frequency table. The TI-83/84 has six lists in the memory—L1, L2, p , L6—that are used.
Use with 
<4:Clrlist> L1, L2 
to clear lists L1 and L2.
Use one list—say L1—to enter the list of numbers and use a second list—
say L2—to list the corresponding frequencies if you have a frequency table.
<EDIT> will show a screen of the lists.

Probability Distribution of a Discrete Random Variable
Random Variables
We routinely use numbers to convey information, to help express an opinion or an
emotion, to help evaluate a situation, and to clarify our thoughts. Think how many
times you have used phrases such as, “On a scale from 1 to 10, what do you think 
of . . . ?”; “What is your GPA?”; “The chance of rain this weekend is 40%”; “Which
team is ﬁrst in the American League?”; “How many A’s did Professor X give?”; and
“What did you make on your math test?”
All of these statements use numbers in some form. Notice that the numbers
are not the heart of the statement, they represent a key facet of the message. When he
sayssheisan8andshesaysheisa3,thenumbersarenottheemotionsthatareevoked,
the numbers indicate something about the strength of the emotions. The product of an
examination is an exam paper, but a grade is assigned to the paper to indicate some-
thing about the quality of the paper. A trip to the grocery store results in bags of
grocery items, but a number—the cost—is usually associated with the purchase.
We associate numbers with outcomes of activities and phenomena because it is
easier to compare and analyze numbers. To summarize grades with a GPA is easier
than averaging letter grades. The auto driver and the highway patrolman can more
nearly agree on the meaning of “drive at 65 mph or less” than they can on “drive at
a safe and reasonable speed.”
This idea of assigning a number to outcomes of an experiment (activity or
process) is an important and useful statistical concept. We call this assignment of
numbers a random variable.
A random variable is a rule that assigns a number to each outcome of an experiment.
It is customary to denote the random variable by a capital letter such as X or Y.
Let’s look at some examples of random variables.
If a coin is tossed twice, there are four possible outcomes: HH, HT, TH, and TT. We
can assign a number to each outcome by simply giving the number of heads that ap-
pear in each case. The values of the random variable X are assigned as follows:

A true–false quiz consists of 15 questions. A random variable may be deﬁned by as-
signing the total number of correct answers to each quiz. In this case, the random
variable ranges from 0 through 15.

The Hardware Store has a box of Super-Special items. Selecting an item from the
box deﬁnes experiment with each of the items as an outcome. Two possible ways to
deﬁne a random variable are to
(a) assign the original price to each item (outcome) or
(b) assign the sale price to each item.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 7,pg.654 ■
(a) Each judge of an Olympic diving contest assigns a number from 1 to 10 to each
outcome (dive). We can think of each judge’s assignment as a way of deﬁning a
random variable.
(b) The housing ofﬁce gives a congeniality test to incoming students to better assign
dormitory roommates. The tests are scored 1 through 5, with a higher number
indicating more congeniality. The scores are values of a random variable as-
signed to levels of congeniality.
(c) An airline baggage claim ofﬁce records the number of bags claimed by each
passenger. The number of bags is a random variable associated with each
passenger.

Three people are selected from a group of ﬁve men and four women. A random vari-
able X is the number of women selected. List the possible values of X and the num-
ber of different outcomes that can be associated with each value.
Solution
X can assume the value 0, 1, 2, or 3. The number of different outcomes associated
with each value is the following:

In one sense, you may be quite arbitrary in the way you deﬁne a random variable for
an experiment. It depends on what is most useful for the problem at hand. Here are
several examples:

The ﬁrst four random variables are discrete variables, because the values as-
signed come from a set of distinct numbers and the values between are not permit-
ted as outcomes. For example, the number of auto passengers can take on only the
values 1, 2, 3, and so on. The number 2.63 is not a valid assignment for the number
of passengers. On the other hand, the last four examples are continuous variables.
Assuming an accurate measuring device, 5 feet 4.274 inches is a valid height. There
are no distinct gaps that must be excluded as a valid height. Similarly, even though
one might expect a car to travel about 23 miles on a gallon of gas, 22.64 miles cannot
be excluded as a valid distance. Any distance in a reasonable interval is a valid
possibility.
Probability Distribution of a Discrete Random Variable
We now merge two concepts that we studied earlier. We have used the concept of
probability to give a measure of the likelihood of a certain outcome or outcomes oc-
curring in an experiment (Section 7.1). At the beginning of this section, we intro-
duced the concept of a random variable, the assigning of a number to each outcome
of an experiment. The value assigned to the random variable depends on the out-
come that actually occurs. Some outcomes may have a small likelihood of occurring,
whereas others may be quite likely to occur. Thus, the associated values of the ran-
dom variable usually have different levels of likelihood.
We sometimes ask about the chance of observing a certain value of a random
variable X (that is, ﬁnd the probability that a certain value occurs). It is no surprise
that such a probability closely relates to the probabilities of the outcomes. Rather
than look at the probability of just one value of X, we now focus on the probability
of each of the possible values of X. We call this assignment of a probability to each
value of a discrete random variable a probability distribution. Let’s look at a simple
example.
A children’s game has 15 cards with 5 colored red, 3 colored black, and 7 colored
green. The cards are shufﬂed, and a child selects 2 cards. If the cards are different col-
ors, no points are given. Five points are given if both cards are green, 10 points are
given if both cards are red, and 15 points are given if both cards are black. Because a
number (the points) is assigned to each outcome (cards drawn), this determines a
random variable X with outcomes and numbers related as follows:

All other outcomes will be different colors, so the probability of different colors is
1-0.200-0.095-0.029=0.676. Now we can give the probability of each value
of X as follows.

The width of a bar of a
probability distribution
is one unit;therefore,

We can represent a probability distribution graphi-
cally using a histogram. (See Figure 8–9.)
Form a category for each value of the random
variable and center the rectangle over the category
mark. The probability, P(x), of a value, x, of the ran-
dom variable is typically represented by the area of
the rectangle. When x has only integral values, as in
this case, the width of the rectangle is 1, and the
height of the rectangle equals the probability, P(x).

Solution
The possible values of X are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, because at least two cards must be drawn
in order to have a match. There are ﬁve cards that are different from the ﬁrst color, so
the sixth card is the last time a card that is different from the ﬁrst can be drawn. The sev-
enth card must then be a match. To compute probabilities, designate the color of the
ﬁrst card by C and the different color by D. Then the possible outcomes of the sequence
of colors are the following:
X = 2: CC
X = 3: CDC
X = 4: CDDC
X = 5: CDDDC
X = 6: CDDDDC
X = 7: CDDDDDC
We now compute the probability of each sequence.
Note that it doesn’t matter which color is drawn ﬁrst, so the probability the ﬁrst
card is some color equals 1.

Variance and Standard Deviation of a Random Variable
If we are honest, most of us will admit to having fantasized about getting rich quick.
Some will act on the fantasy by buying lottery tickets, by gambling, or by purchasing
merchandise so that we can win a magazine’s sweepstakes award. Do you ever ask
yourself how much you are willing to pay for the chance to become rich quick? Would
you pay $1 for the chance to win $1 million? Millions of people would and do by
purchasing lottery tickets. Would you pay $5000 for a chance to win $1 million? Far
fewer will. In this section, we study one way to judge the worth of a chance to win
money, in large or small amounts, and to determine the expected long-term per-
formance of an activity. The measure we study is called expected value. We analyze a
hypothetical activity to develop the concept of expected value.
Expected Value
Each day a student puts 50¢ in a candy machine to buy a 35¢ candy bar. She observes
three possible outcomes:
1.
She gets a candy bar and 15¢ change. This happens 80% of the time.
2.
She gets a candy bar and no change. This happens 16% of the time.
3.
She gets a candy bar and the machine returns her 50¢. This happens 4% of the
time.
Over a period of time, what is the average cost of a candy bar?
The three possible costs, 35¢, 50¢, and 0¢, have a mean of 28.3¢. This is not the
average cost, because it assumes that 35¢, 50¢, and 0¢ occur equally often, whereas,
in fact, 35¢ occurs more often than the other two. If the machine behaved this way
for 500 purchases, we would expect the following:
This presents the information as a frequency table, so we can compute the mean
as we have before with a frequency table (Section 8.3). The mean is
so the average cost is 36¢.
Let’s write the mean in another way:
 = 0.80 * 35 + 0.16 * 50 + 0.04 * 0
 400 * 35 + 80 * 50 + 20 * 0
500
= 400
500 * 35 + 80
500 * 50 + 20
500 * 0
400 * 35 + 80 * 50 + 20 * 0
500
= 14,000 + 4,000 + 0

Expected Value of a Random Variable
659
This last expression is simply the sum obtained by adding each cost of a candy
bar times the probability that cost occurred; that is,
P(35)*35+P(50)*50+P(0)*0
This illustrates the procedure used to compute the mean when each value occurs
with a speciﬁed probability. This mean is called the expected value; it represents the
long-term mean of numerous trials. Although a few trials likely would not average
to the expected value, a larger and larger number of trials will tend to give a mean
closer to the expected value.
We emphasize that the term expected value does not mean the value we expect
in an everyday sense. In the candy bar example, the amount paid for a candy bar 
is either 0¢, 35¢, or 50¢, whereas the expected value is 36¢. As 36¢ is never the
amount paid, you never expect to pay that. However, 36¢ is the average amount 
paid over a large number of purchases. This long-term average is called the expected
value.
We now make a formal deﬁnition of expected value in terms of a random vari-
able and probability distribution.
If X is a random variable with values x1, x2, . . . , xn and corresponding probabilities p1, 
p2, . . . , pn, then the expected value of X, E(X), is
E(X)=p1 x1+. . .+pn xn
Find the expected value of X, where the values of X and their corresponding prob-
abilities are given by the following table:

E(X)=0.4*2+0.2*5+0.3*9+0.1*24

An IRS study shows that 60% of all income tax returns audited have no errors; 6%
have errors that cause overpayments averaging $25; 20% have minor errors that
cause underpayments averaging $35; 13% have more serious errors averaging $500
underpayments; and 1% have ﬂagrant errors averaging $7000 underpayment. If the
IRS selects returns at random:
(a) What is the average amount per return that is owed to the IRS, that is, what is
the expected value of a return selected at random?
(b) How much should the IRS expect to collect if one million returns are audited at
random?
(c) If the budget for the Audit Department is $15 million, how many returns must
they examine to collect enough to cover their budget expenses?
Solution
(a) Because an underpayment error eventually results in additional money paid to
the IRS and a taxpayer overpayment is money paid back by the IRS, we use pos-
itive values for underpayment and negative for overpayment. The probability in
each case is the fraction of returns with that type of error.
E(X)=0.60(0)+0.06(–25)+0.20(35)+0.13(500)+0.01(7000)
=140.5
Thus, the IRS expects to collect $140.50 for each return selected.
(b) If one million returns are selected at random, they may expect to collect
140.50*1 million=$140.5 million.
(c) As the average amount they expect to collect is $140.50 per return audited, they
must examine
15,000,000/140.50=106,762 returns

Expected Value of a Random Variable

The next example illustrates that the expected value need not be an amount of
money. It can be any “payoff” associated with each outcome.
A tray of electronic components contains nine good components and three defective
components. If two components are selected at random, what is the expected num-
ber of defective components?
Solution
Let the random variable X be the number of defective components selected. X can
have the value 0, 1, or 2. We need the probability of each of those numbers:
The expected value is
so the expected number of components is . Clearly, you don’t expect to get half of
a component. The value simply says that if a large number of selections are made,
you will average one half each time. You expect to get no defectives a little less
than half the time and either one or two the rest of the time, but the average will be
one half.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 15,pg.665 ■
Variance and Standard Deviation of a Random Variable
The expected value is a “central tendency.” As illustrated by the vending machine
example at the beginning of this section, the expected value is a long-term average,
or mean, of the values of a random variable, taking the probability of their occur-
rence into consideration. Think back on the mean and median; we shouldn’t be sur-
prised that sometimes the dispersion, or spread, of a random variable is needed to
give more information. We can ﬁnd the variance of a random variable, and it too
measures the dispersion, or spread, of a random variable from the mean (expected
value). The greater dispersion gives a greater variance. The histogram of the proba-
bility distribution shown in Figure 8–11a has a smaller variance than that shown in
Figure 8–11b.

We compute the standard deviation using the method shown in Example 3 of

 = 0.80(35 - 36)2 + 0.16(50 - 36)2 + 0.04(0 - 36)2
 = 400

35. A roulette wheel has 38 spaces of which 18 are red,
18 are black, and 2 are green. Most commonly, a
player bets on the red or on the black. A player 
who makes such a bet pays the “house” $1.00 and
upon winning gets the $1.00 back plus another
$1.00 from the house. The house keeps the losing
player’s dollar. So, the net result is that a player
who loses a bet pays $1.00 and a player who wins 
a bet receives $1.00.
(a) Find the expected value of a bet on red or on
black.
(b) Does this game favor the house or the player?
(c) Find the amount a winning player should 
receive for the game to be fair (an expected
value of zero).

same order, the player receives the “pot” or shares
it equally with other players who also selected the
winning numbers.

Bernoulli Trials
We have studied the probability of an event occurring in an experiment. We now look
at a sequence of experiments to determine probabilities related to the sequence. The
experiments involved are not arbitrary; they have speciﬁc characteristics like those
found in the problems “What is the probability that heads appears seven times in ten
tosses of a coin?” or “If you guess at the answers of 15 multiple-choice questions, what
are your chances of a passing grade?”
These problems are examples of a certain type of probability problem, Bernoulli
trials. Such problems involve repeated trials of an experiment with only two possible
outcomes: heads or tails, right or wrong, yes or no, and so on. We classify the two out-
comes as success or failure.
To classify an experiment as a Bernoulli trial experiment, several properties
must hold.

Bernoulli Experiment with n Trials
1.
The experiment is repeated a ﬁxed number of times (n times).
2.
Eachtrialhasonlytwopossibleoutcomes:successandfailure.Thepossibleout-
comes are exactly the same for each trial.
3.
The probability of success remains the same for each trial. (We use p for the
probability of success and q=1-p for the probability of failure.)
4.
The trials are independent. (The outcome of one trial has no inﬂuence on later
trials.)
5.
We are interested in the total number of successes, not the order in which they
occur.
There may be 0, 1, 2, 3, p , or n successes in n trials.
(a) We are interested in the number of times heads occurs when a coin is tossed
eight times. Each toss of the coin is a trial, so there are eight repeated trials
(n=8). We consider the outcome heads a success and tails a failure. The prob-
ability of success (heads) on each trial is 
, and the probability of failure
(tails) is 
This is an example of a Bernoulli trial.
(b) A student guesses at all the answers on a ten-question multiple-choice quiz (four
choices of an answer on each question). This fulﬁlls the properties of a Bernoulli
trial because:
1.
Each guess is a trial (n=10).
2.
There are two possible outcomes: correct and incorrect.
3.
The probability of a correct answer is 
and the probability of an in-
correct answer is 
on each trial.
4.
The guesses are independent because guessing an answer on one question
gives no information on other questions.
(c) Suppose eight cards are drawn from a deck and none are replaced. We are in-
terested in the number of spades drawn. This is not a Bernoulli trial because the
trials (selecting a card) are not independent (the ﬁrst card drawn affects the pos-
sible choices of the second card; consequently, the conditional probability of
drawing a spade changes each time a card is removed).
(d) Suppose a card is drawn from a deck, the card is noted and placed back in the
deck, and the deck is shufﬂed. This is repeated eight times. We are interested in
the number of times a spade is drawn.
This experiment is a Bernoulli trial because each trial is the same, the trials
are independent, and the probability of obtaining a spade remains the same for
each trial.
Technically, each trial has 52 outcomes, each card in the deck. However, we
reduce the outcomes to the two possible outcomes “success” or “failure” when
we collect all spades into the event deﬁned as success and all other cards into the
event deﬁned as failure. Then,

Solution
Look at the paths of Figure 8–12 that begin at 0 and terminate at the end of a branch.
There are a total of eight paths, and three of them contain exactly two heads. The
probability of terminating at the end of those branches is for each one. (Because the
probability of each branch is ,the probability of taking a sequence of three paths is
) So, the probability of exactly two heads in three tosses of a coin is

Probability of a Bernoulli Experiment
The tree diagram of a Bernoulli trial problem can become unwieldy with a large
number of trials, so an algebraic formula is useful for computing the probability of a
speciﬁed number of successes. Let’s start with a simple example.

dent wildly guesses the answers. What is the probability that he guesses exactly three

Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 28,pg.677 ■
Let’s make some observations about the computation, because they will hold for the
general formula.
1.
In C(5, 3), 5 is the number of trials, and 3 is the number of successes. (In gen-
eral, in C(n, x), n is the number of trials, and x is the number of successes.)
2.
In 
is the probability of success in a single trial, and 3 is the number of suc-
cesses in the ﬁve trials. (In general, in px, p is the probability of success in a sin-
gle trial, and x is the number of successes in n trials.)
3.
In 
is the probability of failure in a single trial, and 2 is the number of fail-
ures in ﬁve trials. It may seem trivial, but note that 2=5-3; the number of
failures equals the number of trials minus the number of successes. (In general,
in (1-p)n – x, 1-p is the probability of failure in a single trial, and n-x is
the number of failures in n trials.)
We now give you the general formula.
Given a Bernoulli experiment and
n independent repeated trials,
p is the probability of success in a single trial,
q=1-p is the probability of failure in a single trial,
x is the number of successes (0  x  n).
Then, the probability of x successes in n trials is
P(x successes in n trials)=C(n, x)p xqn – x
P(k successes in n trials) may be written P(X=k).

Justiﬁcation of the Bernoulli Experiment Formula
Now let’s go back to Example 3 and explain how to obtain the expression used to
compute the probability of a Bernoulli trial.
Recall the problem: A multiple-choice quiz has ﬁve questions with four possible
answers to each, one of which is correct. A student guesses the answers. What is the
probability that three of the ﬁve are correct?
Let’s look at how the student succeeds in answering three of the ﬁve questions.
There are several ways, and the exact number plays a key role in the solution. First,
let’s list some ways. We will list the sequence of successes (correct answers) and fail-
ures (incorrect answers). One sequence is
SSSFF
which indicates that the ﬁrst three were correct and the last two were incorrect.
Some other sequences of three correct and two incorrect are
SSFSF
FSSSF
and so on. Rather than list all the ways in which three correct and two incorrect an-
swers can be given, let’s compute the number.
The basic procedure for forming a sequence of three S’s and two F’s amounts to
selecting the three questions with correct answers. The other two answers are auto-
matically incorrect.
In how many different ways can three questions be selected from the ﬁve ques-
tions? You should recognize this as C(5, 3). As C(5, 3)=10, there are ten possible
sequences of three S’s and two F’s. The student succeeds in passing if his sequence of
guesses is any one of the ten sequences.
It helps that the probabilities of all ten sequences are exactly the same. Notice
that the probability of SSSFF is
by the Multiplication Rule. Also, the probability of SSFSF is
Both of these are simply
each written in different order. In fact, the probability of any sequence of three S’s
and two F’s will contain three times and twice, which gives 
When we add up the probabilities of the ten sequences, we are adding 
ten
times, which is
We obtained this probability in Example 3. A similar situation holds in general for
other values of n, x, p, and q.

Binomial Distribution
We can use Bernoulli trials to form an important probability distribution. This dis-
tribution is called a binomial distribution. Deﬁne it in the following way.
For a sequence of Bernoulli experiments of n repeated trials, deﬁne a random variable X
as the number of successes in n trials. For each value of x, 0  x  n, ﬁnd the probability
of x successes in n trials. The probability distribution obtained is the binomial distribution.

The binomial distribution got its name from the binomial (p+q)n. Each term of
the expansion of the binomial gives one of the probabilities in the binomial distri-
bution. Notice that
(p+q)3=p3+3p2q+3pq2+q3
which can be written
C(3, 3)p3q0+C(3, 2)p2q+C(3, 1)pq2+C(3, 0)p0q3
where each term represents the probability of 3, 2, 1, or 0 successes, respectively, in
a binomial experiment with three trials.
Find the binomial distribution for n=4 and p=0.3.
Solution
The random variable X may take on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The probability

space between that contained no data values. Counting the number of heads in ﬁve
tosses of a coin gives discrete data because two different values must be at least one
unit apart. When we deal with continuous data, the values can be arbitrarily close to-
gether and for two different values, all numbers between are permissible values of
the data. For example, where we measure the heights of male college freshmen, two
men could be of different but nearly the same height. Thus, assuming a precise meas-
uring device, any height between 5¿9– and 5¿10– is a possible height for some male.
Normal Curve
One of the most important probability distributions of data is the normal distribu-
tion. The normal distribution is a valid representation of the distribution of many
populations, such as IQ of 18-year-olds, heights and weights of 12-year-old girls, and
scores on standardized tests such as SAT scores. Just as we used histograms in
Section 8.4 to graph discrete probability distributions, we use a normal curve to
graph a normal distribution. Although normal curves vary in size and shape, they all
have “bell shapes” similar to that shown in Figure 8–15. The horizontal baseline

represents the values of the data, and the height of the curve tells something about
the probability of the value.
A histogram can be used to represent continuous data, and in many cases a
smooth curve drawn through the tops of the bars gives a normal curve. It is known
that the height of 18-year-old males has a mean of 68 inches and a standard devia-
tion of 3 inches, and the normal curve gives a good representation of the heights.
Figure 8–16 shows a histogram of heights and a bell-shaped curve obtained by
smoothing the histogram.
The normal curve is a smooth curve that peaks at the mean and is perfectly sym-
metric about the mean. This symmetry means that one half of the area under the
curve lies to the left of the mean and the other half lies to the right of the mean. We
will use areas under the normal curve to represent probabilities, so the total area is
taken as 1, representing the probability of the sample space. The normal curve has
the property that the mean and standard deviation of the data determine the shape
of the normal curve. Figure 8–17 shows three normal distributions with mean=0
and three different standard deviations.
Notice that the curves approach the baseline but never touch it. This indicates
that fewer and fewer observations are found as you move away from the mean. The

normal curve with the smaller standard deviation has a sharper peak, and a larger
standard deviation gives a ﬂatter curve.
Figure 8–18 illustrates that two normal distributions with the same standard
deviation but different means give normal curves that are the same size and shape.
However, the curves are located in different positions.
When dealing with continuous data, like heights of 18-year-old males, remem-
ber that few if any males are exactly 70 inches tall. When we say a fellow is 70 inches
tall, we usually mean that he is “close to” 70 inches. Depending on how accurately
we attempt to measure his height, we may mean he is within 
inch or 
inch of
70 inches. When we ask for the probability of a randomly chosen 18-year-old male
who is approximately 70 inches tall, we can be more speciﬁc and ask for the proba-
bility that his height is between 69.5 and 70.5 inches.
Area Under a Normal Curve
The ability to ﬁnd the area under a portion of the normal curve is important because
it gives the probability that an observation is in a speciﬁed category or interval. For
example, suppose that a normal distribution has a mean of 85. (See Figure 8–19.)
The area under the curve between 90 and 95 represents the probability that the ob-
servation lies between 90 and 95.
Notice that the area under the curve between 85 and 90 is larger than the area
between 90 and 95. This indicates a proportionally larger probability of values be-
tween 85 and 90.
The probability that a value of X lies between two values, x1 and x2, is determined
by and equals the fraction of the area under the normal curve that lies between x1
and x2.
We use the notation P(x1  X  x2) to denote the probability that X lies
between x1 and x2.

The normal curve has the unusual property of being completely determined by
the mean and standard deviation. This suggests that we need to deal with a different
normal curve for each value of the mean and standard deviation. Fortunately, that is
not the case. The normal curve can be standardized in a way that allows us to ﬁnd
the area under a portion of a normal curve from one table of values. The distance
from the mean, measured in standard deviations, determines the area under the
curve in that interval. For example, for all normal curves, about 68% of the scores
will lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 34% on one side and 34% on the
other. Approximately 95% of the scores will lie within 2 standard deviations, and
more than 99% will lie within 3 standard deviations. (See Figure 8–20.) Let’s apply
this idea to the following example.
One year, the ACT English test had a mean m=17.8 and a standard deviation
s=5.5, and the scores formed a normal distribution.
(a) The scores 12.3 and 23.3 are both 1 standard deviation from the mean, so 34% of
the area under the normal curve lies between 12.3 and 17.8, and 34% of the area
lies between 17.8 and 23.3. Thus, the probability that an ACT English score lies
between 12.3 and 17.8 is 0.34. Similarly, the probability that the score lies be-
tween 17.8 and 23.3 is 0.34. (See Figure 8–20.)
(b) About 95% of the area lies between 6.8 and 28.8, that is, within 2 standard devi-
ations of the mean, so the probability that an ACT English score lies between
6.8 and 28.8 is 0.95.
(c) Because more than 99% of the area lies within 3 standard deviations of the mean
(a distance of 16.5 or less from the mean), you expect less than 1% of the area to
lie more than 3 standard deviations away. So, the probability is less than 0.01 that
an ACT English score is greater than 34.3 or less than 1.3.

It happens that we can answer questions about normal curves in general by referring
to a speciﬁc normal curve, the standard normal curve. The standard normal curve
has mean m=0 and s=1.
In the standard normal curve, the letter z is used for the variable, and because
m=0 and s=1, z also represents the number of standard deviations between the
observation and the mean. Thus, z=1.6 indicates 1.6 standard deviations between
z and the mean, 0.
Example 1

8.7
Normal Distribution

Based on the properties of a normal curve that we have already discussed, we
can draw some conclusions about the probabilities associated with a standard nor-
mal distribution.
A standard normal distribution has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1.
(a) The probability that a value of z lies between 0 and 1 is about 0.34, and the prob-
ability that a value of z lies between –1 and 1 (within 1 standard deviation of the
mean) is about 0.68.
(b) The probability that a value of z lies between z=–2 and z=2 (within 2s of
the mean) is about 0.95.
(c) The probability that a value of z lies between z=–3 and z=3 (within 3 stan-
dard deviations of the mean) is about 0.99.
■
The z-Score
We have already discussed the probability that an observation lies within 1, 2, or 3
standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution. How do we determine the
number of observations that lie within 1.25, 0.63, or 2.50 standard deviations of
the mean? Tables such as the standard normal table found inside the back cover of
the book enable you to ﬁnd the area between the mean and an observation. The key
is to locate the observation according to the number of standard deviations it lies
from the mean. Traditionally, the z-score represents the number of standard devia-
tions between an observation and the mean.
Whatever scale is used for x on a normal curve, we can associate a value of z with
each value of x.
Here’s how we determine a value of z that corresponds to a given value of x. As
z represents the number of standard deviations between the mean and the score x,
ﬁnd z by
We use z to ﬁnd the area under the normal curve between two scores. To do so, we
use the standard normal table found inside the back cover of the book. The table does
not give area between any two scores; that would require a prohibitively lengthy, cum-
bersome table. You must understand that the table gives area between the mean and
a z-score for selected z-scores.
Compute z for each of the following values of the mean, the standard deviation, and
a given value of x:
(a) Mean=25, standard deviation=2, x=31
(b) Mean=25, standard deviation=2, x=19
(c) Mean=7.5, standard deviation=1.2, x=10.5

(a) The value for A that corresponds to z=0.75 is 0.2734, the fraction of the area
between the mean and z=0.75. (See Figure 8–21.)
(b) Because the curve is symmetric about the mean, the area between the mean and
z=–0.75 equals the area between the mean and z=0.75, which is 0.2734. (See

Estimate the fraction of scores between z=1.15 and z=–1.15 under the normal
curve. (We may also say that we ﬁnd the area within 1.15 standard deviations of the
mean.)
Solution
We obtain this area by combining the area between the mean and z=1.15 with
the area between the mean and z=–1.15, because the table gives only the area
between the mean and a score, not between two scores. For the area between the
mean and z=1.15, look for the area corresponding to z=1.15. It is 0.3749. The
area between the mean and z=–1.15 is the same, 0.3749, so the total area is
0.3749+0.3749=0.7498. (See Figure 8–23.)

Find the probability that a score lies to the right of z=0.80.
Solution
Figure 8–25 shows the desired area. The standard normal table gives A=0.2881
for z=0.80. However, this is the area below z=0.80 and above the mean, and
we want to know the area above z. Remember that all the area above the mean is
0.5000 of the area under the curve. Therefore, the area above z=0.80 is
0.5000-0.2881=0.2119 of the total area. Thus, P(Z>0.80)=0.2119.

and a score where z=1.40 is 0.4192, so the area to the right of the score is 
0.5000-0.4192=0.0808. By symmetry, the area to the left of the score where

to 42. It is

Example 10 illustrates the fundamental concept used to ﬁnd the probability that a
value of x lies in a speciﬁed interval of a normal distribution—say, x lies between x1
and x2 (x1  x  x2).
For the interval x1  X  x2,
P(x1  X  x2)=P(z1  Z  z2)
where z1, Z, and z2 are the z-values corresponding to x1, X, and x2, respectively.
P(z1  Z  z2) is found using the standard normal table.
Sometimes, we want to ﬁnd an area between two values of x that lie on the same
side of the mean.
The Welding Program Department at Paul’s Valley Technical School gives an exit
test to evaluate the students’ skills and knowledge of procedures.

tion with a mean of m=100 and a standard deviation s=8. A student is selected at
random. Find the probability that the student will score between 110 and 120.
Solution
Because we always measure areas from the mean to a score, we can ﬁnd the area
between 100 and 110 and the area between 100 and 120. To ﬁnd the area between 110
and 120, subtract the area between 100 and 110 from the area between 100 and 120.

Solution
(a) The value of z corresponding to 28 hours is
From the standard normal table, we have A=0.4959 when z=2.64. The value
A=0.4959 represents the area from the mean, 24.3, to 28 (z=2.64). All of the
area under the curve to the right of the mean is one half of the total area. The
area to the right of z=2.64 is 0.5000-0.4959=0.0041. Therefore, about
0.41% of the students study more than 28 hours.

These examples ask for the probability that a score lies in a certain interval (such as
P(50  X  60)) or greater than a certain score (such as P(X  75)). A natural
question is “How do you ﬁnd the probability of a certain score, such as P(X=65)?”
The answer is “The probability is zero.” In general, P(X=c)=0 for any value c in
a normal distribution. (See Exercise 135.) For example, this states that the prob-
ability of randomly selecting an 18-year-old male who is exactly 5 feet 10 inches tall
is zero.
Because the normal curve is symmetric, the standard normal table gives A only
for positive values of z. For negative values of z, when the score is to the left of the
mean, simply use the value of A for the corresponding positive z. Keep in mind that
each z-value determines an area from the mean to the z position.
We can ﬁnd a variety of areas by adding or subtracting areas given from the
table. (See Figure 8–32.)

A standardized test is given to several hundred thousand junior high students. The
mean is 100, and the standard deviation is 10. If a student is selected at random, what
is the probability that the student scores in the 114 to 120 interval?
Solution
This question may be answered by using the properties of the normal curve, as it rep-
resents standardized test scores well.
The values of z corresponding to 114 and 120 are z=1.4 and z=2.0, respec-
tively. For z=1.4, A=0.4192; for z=2.0, A=0.4773. So, the area between 114
and 120 is 0.4773-0.4192=0.0581. The probability that the student’s score is in
the 114 to 120 interval is 0.0581.

The Quality Cola Bottling Company sells its Quality Cola in the standard size
can, 355 milliliters (ml). The manager does not expect every can to contain exactly
355 ml of cola but would like to be consistently close. Working with the quality-
control manager, she agrees that the quantity can be expected to vary as a normal
distribution, but the cans should have a mean of 355 ml, and at least 95% should vary
from 355 ml by no more than 5 ml. What value of the standard deviation does this
require?
Solution
The company wants 95% of the values to lie between 350 and 360 ml (355 ; 5); that
is, z=–1.96 at 350 and z=1.96 at 360.

1.
All normal curves have the same general bell shape.
2.
The curve is symmetric with respect to a vertical line that passes through the
peak of the curve.
3.
The vertical line through the peak occurs where the mean, median, and mode
coincide.
4.
The area under any normal curve is always 1.
5.
The mean and standard deviation completely determine a normal curve. For
the  same mean, a smaller standard deviation gives a taller and narrower
peak. A larger standard deviation gives a ﬂatter curve.
6.
The area to the right of the mean is 0.5; the area to the left of the mean is 0.5.
7.
About 68.26% of the area under a normal curve is enclosed in the interval
formed by the score 1 standard deviation to the left of the mean and the score
1 standard deviation to the right of the mean.

If a random variable X has a normal probability distribution, the probability
that a score lies between x1 and x2 is the area under the normal curve between

Approximating the Binomial Distribution
The probability that a new drug will cure a certain blood disease is 0.7. If it is ad-
ministered to 100 patients with the disease, what is the probability that 60 of them
will be cured?
Solution
You should set up
P(X=60)=C(100, 60)(0.7)60(0.3)40
with little difﬁculty. You then may ﬁnd it tedious to compute the probability and even
more tedious to form the binomial distribution of the experiment. Some calculators
have functions that make these computations relatively easy.
■
We usually use the normal distribution for continuous data and the binomial distri-
bution for discrete data, but the normal distribution can sometimes be used to esti-
mate binomial probabilities. 
We do not calculate P(X=60) in the preceding example because the normal
distribution provides a means to avoid this wearisome computation. It can be used
to estimate the binomial distribution for large values of n. We will soon show how to
do this. First, we need to ﬁnd the mean and standard deviation of a binomial
distribution.
Mean and Standard Deviation of a Binomial Distribution
Recall from Section 8.5 that the computation of the mean (or expected value), the
variance, and the standard deviation of a probability distribution can be time-
consuming for a random variable with many values.
In Example 9 of Section 8.6, we used the binomial distribution with n=4 and
p=0.3. The expected value of the random variable X is
E(X)=0.2401(0)+0.4116(1)+0.2646(2)+0.0756(3)+0.0081(4)
=0+0.4116+0.5292+0.2268+0.0324
=1.20
The signiﬁcance of this result is that 1.20=4(0.3), which is np for this example.
This result holds for all binomial distributions, E(X)=np. Likewise, the variance
and standard deviation of a binomial distribution can be expressed in rather simple
terms of n, p, and q, as follows.

Using the Normal Curve to Approximate a Binomial Distribution
To compute some binomial probabilities, such as the probability of 40 to 65 successes
in 200 trials, can be tedious and subject to mistakes. Fortunately, the normal curve can
often be used to obtain a satisfactory estimate of a binomial probability.
To illustrate how to use the normal curve to estimate binomial probabilities, we
use the following simple example.
Use the normal curve to estimate the probability of
(a) three heads in six tosses of a coin.
(b) three or four heads in six tosses of a coin.
Solution
(a) We ﬁrst point out that the binomial distribution of this problem, and its his-
togram, are given in Example 10 of Section 8.6. From it, for example, we see that
P(X=3)=0.3125.
For the binomial distribution with n=6 and p=0.5, the mean and stan-
dard deviation are
Figure 8–33 shows a normal curve with m=3 and s=1.225 superimposed on
the binomial distribution for n=6 and p=0.5. Notice that a portion of the
histogram lies above the curve and that some space under the curve is not ﬁlled
 s = 26(0.5)(0.5) = 11.5 = 1.225
 m = 6(0.5) = 3
Example 18
 s(X) = 126.544 = 5.152
 s2(X) = 160(0.21)(0.79) = 26.544
 m = 160(0.21) = 33.6
 s(X) = 14.55 = 2.133
 s2(X) = 20(0.35)(0.65) = 4.55
 Mean = m = 20(0.35) = 7
Example 17
s(X) = 2np(1 - p) = 1npq

by the rectangles. It appears that if the portions of the rectangle outside were
moved into the empty spaces below the curve, then the area under the curve
would pretty well be ﬁlled. This states that the total area enclosed by the his-
togram is “close” to the area under the normal curve.
Let’s make another observation. Each bar in the histogram is of width 1, and
its height is equal to the probability it represents.
The bar representing P(X=3) is centered at 3 and is therefore located be-
tween 2.5 and 3.5. The area of the bar (1*0.3125) can also be used to repre-
sent the probability that X=3. We mention this because it holds the key to us-
ing the normal distribution. To ﬁnd P(X=3), ﬁnd the area under the normal
curve between 2.5 and 3.5. (See Figure 8–34.)
Here’s how we use the normal curve to estimate P(X=3). Use m=3,
s=1.225, x1=2.5, and x2=3.5. Then,
The standard normal table shows that the area under the normal curve be-
tweenthemeanandz=0.41isA=0.1591.Then,theareabetweenz1=–0.41 and
z2=0.41 is 0.1591+0.1591=0.3182. This estimates P(X=3) as 0.3182. This
compares to the actual probability of 0.3125 AC(6, 3)(0.5)3(0.5)3B. Notice that we
approximated the binomial probability P(X=3) by the normal probability
P(2.5  X  3.5).
(b) To ﬁnd the probability of three or four heads in six tosses of a coin, P(3  X  4),
we ﬁnd the total area of the bars for three and four. This amounts to ﬁnding the

The corresponding areas are

probability, from Example 10, Section 8.6, is 0.3125+0.2344=0.5469. Notice
that we approximated the binomial probability P(3  X  4) by the normal
probability P(2.5  X  4.5).
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 89,pg.708 ■
At this point, we must confess that the normal approximation worked rather well in
the preceding example because p and q were both . Had we used 
and 
,
the normal approximation would not have worked very well. However, if n is 50 in-
stead of 6, the normal approximation gives reasonable results. So when is it reason-
able to use the normal distribution to approximate the binomial distribution? The
answer is, “It depends.” It depends on the values of n and p. Several rules of thumb
are used by statisticians to judge when the normal approximation is reasonable. We
use the following:
The normal distribution provides a good estimate of the binomial distribution
when both np and nq are greater than or equal to 5.
Figures 8–35, 8–36, and 8–37 show the binomial distribution for p=0.60 and
n=3, 7, and 15. Notice that the distribution for n=15 more closely resembles a
normal distribution than those for n=3 or n=7. We observe that, for n=3,
np=1.8 and nq=1.2, both smaller than the desired value of 5 for a good normal
approximation. Also, for n=7, np=4.2 and nq=2.8, but for n=15, np=9.0
and nq=6.0. Thus, by our rule, the normal approximation is a reasonable approxi-
mation of the binomial distribution for n=15 and p=0.6.

For np  5,
For nq  5,
Thus, n  12.5, so the smallest integer value of n is 13.

In the next three examples, we estimate some binomial probabilities, using the nor-

q=0.6
On the basis of these values, we have
These values will be used in the three examples.
The probability that a gasoline additive increases gasoline mileage in a car is 0.4. In a
test conducted by an automotive class at the Rocky Mountain Technical Institute, the
additive was used on 14 cars selected at random. Use the normal curve to estimate
(a) the probability that gasoline mileage improves in 3 to 7 cars (P(3  X  7)).
(b) the probability that gasoline mileage improves in more than 3 cars and fewer
than 7 cars (P(3<X<7)).
Solution
(a) Figure 8–38 shows the graph of the binomial probability with the bars repre-
senting 3  X  7 shaded and a normal curve superimposed. It shows that the
area under the normal curve between X=2.5 and 7.5 approximates the desired
probability. To ﬁnd the area, we need the corresponding z-scores.
Using m=5.6 and s=1.83 we have

Using Your TI-83/84
Area Under the Normal Curve
The standard normal table enables you to ﬁnd the area under a normal curve for limited values of z. We have a program
for the TI-83/84 that ﬁnds the area for other z-values. This program calculates the area under the normal curve between
two scores.

Note: fnInt is found in the

Input: The mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution, the scores that deﬁne the lower and upper lim-
its of the area. If the area above a speciﬁed score is desired, use a score that is 3.5 standard deviations above the mean for
the upper limit. Similarly, a score 3.5 standard deviations below the mean is used as the lower limit when the area below
a speciﬁed score is desired.
Output: The area under the normal curve bounded by the given upper and lower limit scores.
We give two illustrations.
(a) A data set has a mean of 26 and a standard deviation of 1.5. Find the area under the normal curve between 23 and 30.
The ﬁrst screen shows the mean, standard deviation, and limits entered. The second screen shows the area between
limits, A=.9734.
(b) For the data set in (a), ﬁnd the area above 24. Notice in the ﬁrst screen that the upper limit is 32 because it is more
than 3.5 standard deviations above the mean, 26. (3.5*1.5=5.25, and 32 is 6 above the mean.) The second screen
shows the area under the normal curve above 24, A=0.9087.
Note: This program may give slightly different answers than those obtained using the standard normal table because
z in the table is rounded to two decimals and A is rounded to four decimals. The program carries more decimal places in
its calculations.

4.
A data set has a mean of 76 and a standard deviation of 5. Find the area under the normal curve below 73.5.
Using Excel
EXCEL has a function that ﬁnds the area under the normal curve that is below a score x. This differs from the standard
normal table we have used, that ﬁnds the area between the mean and the score. Here’s how to use it.
Store the value of x in A2, the mean in C2, and the standard deviation in D2. Let’s put the area under the normal
curve below x in cell A3 by entering the formula =NORMDIST(A2,C2,D2,1) in A3. For example, if we enter x=35 in
A2, mean=30 in C2, and standard deviation=5 in D2, then the formula returns 0.84134474 in A3.
To ﬁnd the area between two scores, we enter the smaller score, say 23, in A2, the larger score, say 35, in B2, the mean,
30, in C2, and the standard deviation, 5, in D2. We obtain the area between the two scores in A4 by subtracting the area
below the smaller score from the area below the larger score. In A4, enter the formula =NORMDIST(B2,C2,D2,1)-
NORMDIST(A2,C2,D2,1). In this case, it returns the area 0.76058803.
To ﬁnd the area above the score in A2, use the formula =1-NORMDIST(A2,C2,D2,1).

manager hesitated to put a new product on the market unless she was conﬁdent that
it would succeed.
Mr. Quality, an astute executive, agreed that his managers had valid points, so
he instructed them to develop a new formula, ﬁnd out if the public liked it, and if so,
pour money into advertising it. After weeks of work, the research division developed
a formula that both they and Mr. Quality liked. Now the marketing manager wanted
to know if the public liked it. She quickly determined that it was quite unrealistic and
prohibitive in cost to give everyone in the country a taste test. So, she asked the com-
pany statistician to help her. She told the statistician that she was conﬁdent that the
new cola would be successful if 40% or more of the population liked it. The statisti-
cian outlined the following plan:
1.
Select, by a random means, 500 people throughout the country.
2.
Give each one a taste test.
3.
Find the proportion of the sample that like the new cola.
4.
Use the sample proportion as an estimate of the proportion of the total popula-
tion that like the new cola.
It took the statistician several weeks to select and survey the sample. When the
information was in and tabulated, it showed that 43% of the people in the sample
test liked the new cola. At ﬁrst the marketing manager was elated. Enough people
liked the new product to make it successful. Then, she had second thoughts. What
about the millions of people who did not participate in the taste test? They were the
ones who would determine the success of the new cola, so she called the statistician.
“Can I depend on 43% of everyone liking the new cola? Perhaps you just hap-
pened to pick the few people who like it.”
“I cannot guarantee that precisely 43% of the general public will like it. I told
you this was an estimate.”
“How good is the estimate? If the estimate is off 2 or 3 percentage points, we are
O.K. If the proportion for the entire population is actually only 20%, we are in real
trouble. Can you put some bounds on how much the estimate might be in error?”
We interrupt this saga to give some background of how this analysis works. The
market analysis in this story involves a population and a sample. The population
consists of all the people who are potential customers, millions of them, perhaps.
The sample consists of the 500 people selected for the taste test. The results of the
taste test showed that the proportion of the sample who liked Quality Cola was 43%.
We denote the sample proportion by 
and 
(In this case, we use the deci-
mal form rather than the percentages.)
For the entire population, some proportion will like Quality Cola, and we de-
note that population proportion with p. For all practical purposes, the population
proportion, p, is impossible to determine even though the marketing manager would
dearly love to know it.
Let’s use the Quality Cola story to describe an important relationship between
the proportion, p, of an arbitrary population and the proportion, 
of a sample
taken from the population.
The proportion of the population who like Quality Cola is unknown, but let’s
suppose that somehow we know it is p=0.45 (45% like Quality Cola). In such a
case, the sample proportion 
yields a reasonably good estimate.
However, if we took other random samples of 500 people, we would not expect
to ﬁnd the same proportion who like Quality Cola. We might ﬁnd
in one
sample, 39% in another, 41% in another, or maybe even as much as 65% in a sample.

Now here is the interesting, and useful, relationship. If a large number of ran-
dom samples are taken, and the percentage who like Quality Cola is recorded in
each case, then a data set of sample proportions is obtained. As a set of numbers they
have a mean and a standard deviation.
If the sample size is large enough, then the proportions obtained from a large
number of samples form what is reasonably close to a normal distribution. An amaz-
ing result occurs when the mean of all possible sample proportions is computed. This
mean equals the population proportion, p.
Let’s illustrate this with a simple example.
A deck of cards contains a large number of cards (thousands or maybe even millions
of cards). Each card in the deck is numbered with a 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each of the numbers
appears on one fourth of the cards.
The population in this example is the deck of cards. The proportion of cards that
contain a 1 is 
Now suppose someone who doesn’t know the makeup of the
deck wants to ﬁnd the proportion of cards that contain a 1. They proceed by ran-
domly selecting two cards from the deck and noting the proportion of 1’s, that is,
they select a sample of two cards and note 
for the sample. The cards are replaced
and other random samples are taken. For each sample taken, three kinds of out-
comes are possible:
(a) Neither card is a 1 
.
(b) One card is a 1 and the other card is not 
(c) Both cards are 1’s 
After a number of samples, a list of numbers consisting of 0’s, ’s, and 1’s is obtained.
The mean of these numbers estimates the population proportion. If we did the im-
practical and took all possible samples of two cards, the theory indicates that the
mean of the sample proportions would equal the population proportion. Rather
than trying the impractical, let’s ﬁnd the mean of the proportions by ﬁnding the ex-
pected value. We need the probability of the three possible values of 
(a)
when neither card is a 1. The probability that a single card drawn is not a
1 is . Thus, the probability the ﬁrst card is not a 1, and the second card is not a
1 is 
.
(b)
when one card is a 1 and the other isn’t. This occurs when the ﬁrst card is
a 1 and the second isn’t, or the ﬁrst card isn’t a 1 and the second is. The proba-
bility of this occurring is 
.
(c)
when both cards are 1’s. The probability of this occurring is 
.
We have 
and 
So, the expected
value of 
is
Thus, the mean of all sample proportions is equal to the population proportion
.
Notice that none of the sample proportions could possibly equal the population
proportion, but the mean of the sample proportions does.

Chapter 8
Statistics
It is unrealistic to take all possible samples of a large population, so one possible
strategy is similar to that taken at a nearby university. Here’s the situation.
The dean of students received a student petition requesting a change in the date of
spring break. The dean had no desire to consider a change unless there was strong
student support beyond the relatively small number who signed the petition.
The dean approached Professor Turner, a statistics professor, for help. Pro-
fessor Turner had just taught the chapter on sampling to the class, so it seemed like
a good project to assign to the students. Each of the 15 students was to make a ran-
dom sample of 60 students and determine the proportion of the sample that favored
a change in spring break.
The dean was somewhat dismayed when the sample proportions were all differ-
ent. Which one should be used?
Because the mean of all sample proportions equals the population proportion,
it seems reasonable that the mean of the 15 samples should provide a better estimate
of the population proportion than any sample alone. So, Professor Turner recom-
mended that the dean use the mean of the 15 sample proportions as the estimate of
the population proportion.
■
The procedure of taking several samples and averaging the ’s is not the method gen-
erally used because it is often a major effort to ﬁnd just one random sample. So, we
go to the other extreme and take just one sample. The proportion obtained is used
as the estimate for the population proportion. When only one sample is used, we
cannot take a small sample like Example 1 where it was impossible to obtain a sam-
ple proportion near the population proportion. The sample size must be large
enough to allow a sample proportion close to the population proportion. Realizing
the sample proportion is likely to be different from the population proportion, it is
important to know how close the sample proportion is to the population proportion.
The fact that the sample proportions form a normal distribution helps answer that.
We remind ourselves that we are dealing with
1.
A population of which a proportion, p, have a characteristic of interest (such as
liking Quality Cola).
2.
Random samples of the population are taken and the proportion, 
of the sam-
ple that have the characteristic of interest is obtained. The set of possible ’s has
a mean equal to the population proportion p.
3.
If the sample size is large, the distribution of the ’s is approximately normal.
Because the ’s form a normal distribution, they tend to be clustered fairly close
to the population proportion, p.
Conﬁdence Intervals
In the Quality Cola example, the marketing manager would feel comfortable if she
knew the sample proportion was within 3% of the actual, but unknown, population
proportion. (See Figure 8– 42a.)
Because the population proportion, p, is unknown and unattainable, we use a
sample proportion, 
as an estimate of the population proportion, even though 
rarely turns out to be p. Still, we expect the sample proportion 
to be close to p in

the sense that 
is in some interval centered at p, say in the interval from p-E to
p+E. We call E the maximum error of the proportion. (In the Quality Cola ex-
ample, E=3%.) The longer this interval, the more conﬁdent we are that it contains
p. (See Figure 8– 43.)
When we state how close p is to 
we consider the interval 
to 
and
discuss the probability that p lies in this interval.
It is reasonable to expect a larger value of E, and thus a longer interval, to be
more likely to contain p than a shorter interval. We say we are more conﬁdent the
longer interval contains the population proportion p. We would like to do more than
say we are more or less conﬁdent. We want to measure the conﬁdence. This leads
to the idea of a conﬁdence interval and conﬁdence level. We call the degree of
conﬁdence a conﬁdence level, and we express it as a percentage. When we say that
we are 100% conﬁdent that p lies in the interval from 
to 
we are say-
ing we are certain. When we say that we are 90% conﬁdent p lies in the interval
to 
we are saying that if we take a sample, the
probability that p for the population lies in the conﬁdence interval is 0.90.
Let 
be the proportion of any random sample from a population and let E be a positive
number.
The numbers between 
and 
form an interval called the conﬁdence
interval for the population proportion.
The conﬁdence level associated with this interval is the probability P(
 p 
+E) expressed as a percentage.
We now proceed to discuss how we determine E.
Standard Error of a Proportion
We introduce the term standard error, abbreviated S.E. The standard error is the
term used when referring to the standard deviation of the ’s, and it is rather simple
to compute:
where n is the sample size and p is the mean of the ’s and is also the population
proportion.
Unfortunately, we don’t know the value of p, which is the very thing we are at-
tempting to ﬁnd. Because we are going to need S.E. to estimate a conﬁdence inter-
val, we use
which is considered a reasonable estimate.

Chapter 8
Statistics
The properties of a normal distribution tell us, for example, that about 68% of
the ’s lie within 1 S.E. of the p. (See Figure 8– 44.)
We also say that the probability that 
lies within 1 S.E. of p is 0.68, and
consequently, the probability that p lies within 1 S.E. of 
is 0.68. The interval 
S.E. to 
S.E. is a 68% conﬁdence interval.
We are primarily interested in three conﬁdence levels: 90%, 95%, and 99%, with
the 95% conﬁdence level being the one most used in practice.
Computing Error Bounds for a Proportion
Let’s look at how we ﬁnd a 95% conﬁdence interval. We want to ﬁnd the interval
so that the probability that p is in that interval is 0.95; that is,
As 
forms a normal distribution, we are seeking
the area under the normal curve such that 95% of the area is between 
and
47.5% to the left of 
and 47.5% to the right of 
From the standard normal table, z=1.96 for A=0.475, so we conclude that E
lies 1.96 S.E. from the mean; that is, E =1.96(S.E.). (See Figure 8– 45.) To move
to the right of p by 1.96 S.E. gives the boundary point p+1.96 S.E. Similarly, the
left boundary point is p-1.96 S.E.
The procedure for estimating p by using the proportion of a random sample, 
is justiﬁed by a fundamental theorem in statistics known as the Central Limit
Theorem.

The Central Limit Theorem allows us to use the properties of a normal distri-
bution in the study of a distribution that is not normal. Even if a population does not
have normal distribution properties, the sample proportions, 
are normally dis-
tributed. When we use sufﬁciently large samples, generally over 50, we can make in-
ferences about the population based on the properties of a normal distribution.
Now let’s go back to the Quality Cola story and ﬁnd the 95% conﬁdence inter-
val for the sample of 500 that gave 
Find the 95% conﬁdence interval.
Solution
Then the maximum error E=1.96(0.0221)=0.043. The 95% conﬁdence interval
is from 0.43-0.043=0.387 to 0.43+0.043=0.473.
Thus, we say 0.387  p  0.473 with 95% conﬁdence. The Quality Cola market-
ing manager should be pleased because the lower end of the conﬁdence interval is
very nearly the 40% favorable response she desired.
■
In general, we use E=z*S.E., where z depends on the conﬁdence level desired.
For a 90% conﬁdence level, ﬁnd z in the standard normal table that corresponds to
A=0.45 (one-half of 0.90). You will ﬁnd z=1.65. For a 99% conﬁdence level, use
z=2.58 because it corresponds to A=0.495 (one-half of 0.99).

Notice that this conﬁdence interval is smaller, so the sample proportion is a better
estimate of the total population. This is generally true; a larger sample size reduces
the maximum error. The sample size that will keep the maximum error to a speciﬁed
level can be determined. (See Example 9.)

Then, the interval that contains the proportion of the general population is
from 0.23-0.0693=0.1607 to 0.23+0.0693=0.2993. We conclude, with 98%
conﬁdence, that about 16% to 30% of the population use No-Plaque toothpaste.

Quality Control
Manufacturing companies are concerned with maintaining the quality of their prod-
ucts. Defective items can occur because of a random glitch or because a machine may
become worn or out of adjustment or a new employee may not understand the pro-
cedures. A manufacturer usually recognizes that some defective items caused by ran-
dom glitches will occur, but if the defective items become excessive, production is
halted and corrective measures are taken.
A quality-control manager monitors the production process for defective items
by taking random samples and using the proportion of defective items in the sample
to estimate the proportion of defective items overall. As with opinion polls, the sam-
ple proportion is only an estimate, and error bounds can be quite useful. Let’s look
at a simple example.
The quality-control policy of Arita China Company speciﬁes that production must
continue as long as the quality-control manager is 95% conﬁdent that defects occur
in less than 1% of the pieces produced. Otherwise, production is halted, and the
equipment is adjusted and calibrated. The quality-control manager periodically
takes a random sample of 450 pieces of china and carefully examines them for de-
fects. On February 15, she found two defective pieces in the sample of 450. Should
she allow production to continue?

giving the error bounds
0.0044+1.96(.00312)=0.0105
and
0.0044-1.96(.00312)=–0.00172
So, with 95% conﬁdence the population proportion of defective items is in the inter-
val 0<x<0.0105. (0 was used because the proportion is never negative.)
The accepted interval for proportion of defective items is 0<x<0.01.
As the computed interval 0<x<0.0105 is so close to the desired interval, the
quality-control manager should not halt production.
Had the computed interval been 0<x<0.0195, the quality-control manager
would have been justiﬁed in requesting that production be halted to calibrate the
equipment.

Game Theory
People of all ages like to play games.The games may range from simple chil-
dren’s games (hide and seek), to games of luck (roulette), to games requiring
special skills (baseball) or strategies (chess). In some games, each opponent
tries to anticipate the other’s actions and act accordingly.For example,the de-
fense in a football game may anticipate a pass and set up a blitz while the of-
fense,in turn,tries to anticipate the defense’s strategy.The study of game the-
ory is not restricted to our usual concept of a game.It analyzes strategies used

TWO-PERSON GAMES
•
Strictly Determined Games
This chapter focuses on a simple situation with exactly two sides, or players, in-
volved. These two players compete for a payoff that one player pays to the other.
Let’s begin with a simple example using a coin-matching game.
Two friends, Rob and Chad, play the following game. Each one has a coin, and
each decides which side to turn up. They show the coins simultaneously and make
payments according to the following.
If both show heads, Rob pays Chad 50¢. If both show tails, Rob pays Chad 25¢.
If a head and a tail show, Chad pays Rob 35¢. The following ﬁgure shows these pay-
offs for each possible outcome:
This game is called a two-person game because exactly two people participate.
Notice that the amount won by a player is exactly the same as the amount lost by the
opponent. Whenever this is the case, we call the game a zero-sum game. We can rep-
resent the payoffs in a two-person zero-sum game by a payoff matrix. The payoffs in-
dicated by the ﬁgure can be simpliﬁed to the following matrix:
Chad
Heads
Tails
Rob
The matrix shows all possible payoffs for the way heads and tails are paired. An en-
try represents the amount Rob receives for that pair. Consequently, a negative entry
indicates that Rob pays Chad.
A player’s plan of action against the opponent is called a strategy. Game theory
attempts to determine the best strategy so that each player will maximize his payoff.
It is assumed that each player knows all strategies available to himself and to his op-
ponent, but each player selects a strategy without the opponent knowing which strat-
egy is selected. In this coin-matching game, the choice of a strategy simply amounts
to selecting heads or tails. Notice that when Rob selects the strategy heads, he has
selected the ﬁrst row of the payoff matrix. Chad’s selection of a strategy is equivalent
to selecting a column of the matrix.
Rob and Chad match quarters. When the coins match, Rob receives 25¢. When the
coins differ, Chad receives 25¢. The payoff matrix is

Strictly Determined Games
We begin our analyses of the best strategy with some simple games that have ﬁxed
strategies.
In a competitive situation, we might ask if a strategy exists that will improve our
chances of winning or that will increase our payoff. Some simple games have a ﬁxed
strategy or strategies that result in the best payoff possible when the competitors
both have knowledge of the payoff associated with each strategy. Other games have
no ﬁxed best strategy. We ﬁrst analyze the best strategy for games that have ﬁxed
strategies. We call them strictly determined games.
Two players, R and C, play a game in which R can take two alternative actions
(strategies), called r1 and r2, and C can take two actions, c1 and c2. Assume that each
player chooses a strategy with no foreknowledge of the other’s likely strategy.
Because there are two possible strategies for R and two for C, a 2*2 payoff matrix
represents the outcome, or payoff, corresponding to each pair of strategies selected.
Here is an example of a payoff matrix:
C
c1
c2
R
Following the convention that the entries represent the payoff to the row player,
R, we interpret the matrix as follows: If R chooses strategy r1 and C chooses c1, then

Game Theory
C pays 4 to R. If R chooses strategy r1 and C chooses c2, then R pays 9 to C, and so
on. Notice that the sum of the amounts won by R and C is zero whatever strategies
are selected. For example, if R selects r2, and C selects c1, then R wins 6 and C loses
6 (or wins –6), so the total is zero. Therefore, this is called a zero-sum game.
We emphasize that a matrix entry represents an amount paid by player C to
player R. To indicate the situation where C receives payment from R, enter a nega-
tive amount.
R and C each wish to gain as much as they can (or lose as little as possible).
Which strategies should they select? Let’s analyze the situation. First, observe that
for R to gain as much as possible, R’s strategy attempts to select the maximum entry.
As a gain for C is represented by a negative number, C attempts to select the mini-
mum entry.
R should select r2, because R then stands to gain the most, 6 or 8, regardless of
C’s strategy.
At ﬁrst glance, it appears that C’s strategy should be c2, because that is C’s only
chance of winning. However, we assume that both parties know all possible strate-
gies, so C knows that R’s best strategy is r2. Thus, C expects R to choose r2, so C can
choose only between losing 8 or losing 6. C should select strategy c1, because C then
risks giving the least away. With the strategies r2 and c1, C pays 6 to R. This entry of
the matrix is called the value of the game; its location in the matrix is called a saddle
point; and the pair of strategies leading to the value is called a solution. This game
has a value of 6; the (2, 1) location is the saddle point; and the solution is the pair of
strategies r2 and c1.
Let’s use this example and analyze the general approach that determines
whether a solution exists in a two-person game and how we can ﬁnd a solution, if a
solution exists.
Several courses of action may be available to both players, and there need not
be the same number for each.
The strategies available to R and C in a two-person game can be represented by
a payoff matrix A:
C
c1
c2
p
cn
R
Note that the number of strategies available to R is m and the number of strategies
available to C is n. The entry aij represents the payoff that R receives when R adopts
strategy ri and C adopts cj. The following are the conditions of the game:
1.
Each player aims to choose the strategy that will enable the player to obtain
as large a payoff as possible (or to lose as little as possible).
2.
It is assumed that neither player has any prior knowledge of what strategy the
other will adopt.
3.
Each player makes a choice of strategy under the assumption that the oppo-
nent is an intelligent person adopting an equally rational approach to the
game.

Two-Person Games
735
Let’s ﬁrst approach the game from the viewpoint of R who is trying to maximize
winnings. R scans the rows of A trying to decide which strategy, r1, r2, . . . , rm, to
adopt. For any given strategy (row), what is the least possible payoff R can expect?
It is the minimum entry of that row. In the example with
C
c1
c2
R
as the payoff matrix, the minimum row entries are –9 for row 1 and 6 for row 2.
R is aware of playing an intelligent opponent who aims to hold R to a small pay-
off. When R chooses a row, R is guaranteed at least the minimum entry of that row.
R then selects the row containing the largest of these minima. R is then guaranteed
that payoff, and it is the largest payoff that R can hope for against C’s best counter-
strategy.
We now look at the situation from the viewpoint of C, who wants the minimum
payoff because a gain for C is represented by a negative number. C scans the columns
of A trying to decide which strategy, c1, c2, . . . , cn, to adopt. C marks the maximum
element in each column, C’s least possible gain (or largest possible loss) for that
strategy. In the example given, this is 6 in column 1 and 8 in column 2. C then selects
the strategy that has the smallest of those maxima. The smallest of the maxima rep-
resents C’s greatest gain if it is negative and C’s smallest loss if it is positive. This is
the least payoff that C need make against R’s strategy.
Thus, the approaches that R and C should adopt are the following:
R marks off the minimum element in each row, and selects the row that has
the largest of these minima.
C marks off the maximum element in each column, and selects the column
that has the smallest of these maxima.
If the largest of the row minima occurs in the same location as the smallest of
the column maxima, that payoff is the value of the game.
The two strategies leading to the value, the solution, will be the ones that
should be adopted.
When the largest row minimum and the smallest column maximum are the
same, the game is said to be strictly determined. The location of this element is
the saddle point of the game. (There are games that are not strictly determined.
We discuss strategies for such games in the following section.)
In the example, R selects the largest of the row minima, 6. C selects the smallest
of the column maxima, 6. Because these are the same, the game is strictly deter-
mined, and the (2, 1) location is the saddle point of the game. This game is strictly
determined because each player should always play the same strategy. If R wants
to maximize average earnings, R should always play r2. If C wants to minimize aver-
age payoff, C should always play c1. It is in this sense that the game is strictly
determined.

The following payoff matrix shows the strategies of a game played by players R and
C, with R having three strategies and C having two strategies:
C
c1 c2
R
Determine the value of the game, if it exists.
Solution
First, analyze R’s strategies by selecting the minimum entry from each row and write
it on the right of the matrix. Next, analyze C’s strategies by ﬁnding the maximum en-
try in each column and write it below the column. Then select the largest of the min-
ima and the smallest of the maxima.
Row
5
Smallest of Maxima
Observe that the smallest of the column maxima and the largest of the row minima
are the same and both occur in the (3, 2) location. Thus, the game is strictly deter-
mined with value 5. The saddle point is (3, 2) and the strategies r3 for R and c2 for C
form the solution.
When the players adopt these strategies, as they should, player R will receive 5
from player C.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 6,pg.739 ■
Perhaps this game seems unfair because C has no chance of winning. The best C can
do is to lose 5 each time the game is played. Unfortunately, a game like this may cor-
respond to a real situation. Sometimes a business manager may have several options
for the business, but economic conditions are such that each option results in a ﬁnan-
cial loss. The best strategy is then to minimize losses.
What happens when one player chooses another strategy? Suppose C adopts c1
in the hope of reducing losses to 1. If R keeps to strategy r3, then C loses 7, rather
than the loss of 5 by choosing c2.
The following example illustrates that it is possible for a two-person game to
have more than one saddle point.

Each 6 in this matrix occurs at a saddle point, (3, 1) and (3, 2). (Verify this.) The
best strategy for R is r3, whereas C has the option of either strategy c1 or c2. In either
case, the payoff is 6. When more than one saddle point occurs, the entries in the ma-
trix at the saddle points are the same, being the value of the game.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 12,pg.739 ■
A game may have no saddle point, and thereby is not strictly determined. Here is an
example to illustrate this type of situation.
Here is the payoff matrix of a two-person game:
C
Row
c1
c2
R
For a game to be strictly determined, the largest of the row minima and the
smallest of the column maxima must be the same and occur in the same location in
the matrix. That does not occur in this game because the largest of the row minima
is –2 and the smallest of the column maxima is 3, and they appear in different loca-
tions. Thus, there is no saddle point.

The next section discusses strategies each player should take in such a game.
Two major discount stores, A-Mart and B-Mart, compete for the business of the
same customer base. A-Mart has 55% of the business and B-Mart 45%. Both com-
panies are considering building new superstores to increase their market share. If
both build, or neither builds, they expect their market share to remain the same. If
A-Mart builds and B-Mart doesn’t, A-Mart’s share increases to 65%. If B-Mart
builds and A-Mart doesn’t, then A-Mart’s share drops to 50%. Determine which
strategy, to build or not build, each company should take.

Games That Are Not Strictly Determined
In the preceding section, we analyzed strictly determined two-person games in
which each person had one strategy that was best under the conditions of the game.
We also saw that some games are not strictly determined.
The following game is not strictly determined because the largest of the row
minima is 10 and the smallest column maxima is 16.
C
Row
c1
c2
R

Thus, the game has no saddle point. Notice that C’s best strategy is c1 if R plays r1
and is c2 if R plays r2. The best strategy for R is r1 when C plays c2 and is r2 when C
plays c1. Which strategy should each player adopt?
Games are often played a number of times, not just once. For example, a foot-
ball team has a variety of offensive strategies (plays) available and the opposing
team has several defensive strategies. Although the offensive team may have a play
that is successful more consistently than others, they do not choose it every time be-
cause the opponents would then use the defensive strategy that works best against
that play. The best offensive strategy uses a variety of plays in a way that maximizes

overall efforts. Similarly, the defensive team uses a variety of strategies that they
hope will keep the offensive gains to a minimum. In the simple example
C
c1
c2
R
players must conceal their choice of strategy or else the other players can select the
strategy that is most beneﬁcial to them. If R realizes that C selects strategy c2, then
R will select r1 to maximize payoff. If C selects c1, then R knows to select r2.
If each player keeps the strategy secret, with a mixture of strategies, then the
best strategy for each is to select a strategy in a random manner but with a frequency
that provides the greatest beneﬁt. Thus, R should select r1 part of the time in a ran-
dom manner and select r2 the rest of the time. In a similar manner, C selects c1 part
of the time and c2 the rest of the time.
Player R would like to adopt a sequence of strategies that would maximize R’s
long-term average payoff from C, and C would like to minimize the long-term aver-
age payoff to R. How often should R adopt r1 and how often should C adopt c1 for
the most beneﬁcial payoff to each? We use probability theory to control the random-
ness of each player’s strategy.
We use the following payoff matrix for a general two-person game:
C
c1
c2
R
We use the notation p1 for the probability that R will adopt strategy r1 and p2 for
the probability that R will adopt strategy r2. For player C, we use q1 for the probabil-
ity that C will adopt strategy c1, and q2 represents the probability that c2 will be
adopted. In practice, over a sequence of a number of games, player R uses the strat-
egy r1 the fraction p1 of the time and uses r2 the fraction p2 of the time. Similarly,
C adopts c1 the fraction q1 of the time and adopts c2 the fraction q2 of the time.
Whenever the players adopt strategies in a random manner with the fraction of times
indicated, then the probability of the payoff a1 1 is p1 q1—that is, the probability that
R selects r1 and C selects c1. Similarly, the probability of payoff a1 2 is p1 q2, the prob-
ability of a2 1 is p2 q1, and the probability of a2 2 is p2 q2.
With each possible pair of strategies the following probabilities and pay-
offs hold:
When each player randomly selects a strategy according to these probabilities,
the average long-term payoff is the expected value of the payoff. (Note that this is
the expected value as deﬁned in Section 8.5.) We call this the expected payoff of the
game, and it is
Expected payoff=p1 q1 a1 1+p1 q2 a1 2+p2 q1 a2 1+p2 q2 a2 2

The expected payoff denotes the average payoff to R when the game is played a large
number of times.
We can represent the strategy probability with the matrices
P=[p1
p2]
and
and denote the payoff matrix by A and the expected payoff associated with these
probabilities by E(P, Q). Then, in matrix form E(P, Q) becomes
E(P, Q)=PAQ
We call the matrices P and Q the strategies adopted by R and C, respectively.
We verify this by performing the matrix multiplication
which is the expected payoff.
Here is the payoff matrix of a mixed strategy game:
C
c1
c2
R
Let’s compute the expected payoff using the strategy
for R and the strategy
for C. This means that of the time R will adopt strategy r1 and of the time will
adopt strategy r2, whereas of the time C will adopt strategy c1 and of the time C will
adopt strategy c2
R can expect an average payoff of 34 if the game is played a large number of
times provided that the players select strategies in a random manner with the rela-
tive frequency given by P and Q. If the players choose to vary the relative frequency
of their strategies, then the expected payoff will change.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 1,pg.748 ■
We have seen that a strictly determined game has a solution that provides an opti-
mal strategy for both players. In the case of a mixed-strategy game, no such single
strategy exists. However, player R would like a strategy P that gives the best payoff
against player C’s best strategy. We call such a strategy the optimal strategy for
player R.
Likewise, C wants to adopt a strategy Q that yields the least payoff to R against
R’s best strategy. We call it the optimal strategy for player C.

DEFINITION
Optimal Strategy
Both players in a mixed-strategy game have the option of selecting their strat-
egy probabilities. Because different strategies generally yield different expected pay-
offs, a player would like to know how to determine the optimal strategy. Mathe-
maticians have determined how to ﬁnd optimal strategies from the 2*2 payoff
matrix of a two-person game.
For the payoff matrix
C
R
the optimal strategy for player R is P=[p1
p2] where
The optimal strategy for player C is Q=[q1
q2] where
The expected payoff for the optimal strategies is
The values of p1, p2, q1, and q2 are meaningless when a1 1+a2 2-a1 2-
a2 1=0. However, this never occurs when the game is not strictly determined.
Now let’s ﬁnd the optimal strategies, and the value associated with the strategies, for
the game with payoff matrix
C
R
Solution
The optimal strategy for R is 
and the optimal strategy for C is 
These
strategies yield the expected payoff
For a large number of games, R can expect, on the average, to receive about 28.3
from C provided that both players adopt their optimal strategies.

Caution
If a game is strictly
determined,the pre-
ceding method of
computing the value
is not correct.
A two-person game with payoff matrix
C
R
is strictly determined with value 4. R’s strategy is r1, and C’s strategy is c1, which we
can represent in matrix form as P=[1
0] for R and Q=[1
0] for C.
If we use the formulas for optimal strategies and expected payoff, we obtain for
R the strategy 
and for C the strategy 
with 
This result is erroneous because neither 
nor 
is a valid probability and be-
cause E=4 is the optimal value, not 
■
This example emphasizes that a mixed-strategy analysis does not apply to a strictly
determined game.
In some instances, a payoff matrix can be simpliﬁed to a smaller matrix. Here is
an example.
Here is a payoff matrix in which each player has the option of three strategies. The
game is not strictly determined.
C
c1
c2
c3
R
Notice that each entry in row 2 is greater than the corresponding entry in row 3.
Thus, R should never adopt strategy r3 because, regardless of the strategy adopted
by C, the strategy r2 yields a better value for R. As C wants to minimize the payoff
to R, C should never select strategy c2 because strategy c3 yields a smaller payoff to
R regardless of the strategy R adopts. In a game like this, we say that strategy r2 dom-
inates strategy r3, strategy c3 dominates strategy c2, and strategies r3 and c2 can be re-
moved from consideration.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 9,pg.748 ■
Row i of a payoff matrix dominates row j if every entry of row i is greater than or equal
to the corresponding entry of row j.
Column i of a payoff matrix dominates column j if every entry of column i is less than
or equal to the corresponding entry of column j.
Whenever row i dominates row j, then row j may be removed from the payoff  matrix
without affecting the analysis.
Whenever column i dominates column j, then column j may be removed from the pay-
off matrix without affecting the analysis.
Because row 2 dominates row 3 and column 3 dominates column 2 of the payoff
matrix of the example, we can remove row 3 and column 2 to obtain the payoff matrix

From this 2*2 matrix, we can now ﬁnd the optimal strategy for R, P=[p1 p2 0].
The zero occurs because r3 will never be used.
Thus,
For C, the optimal strategy is 
q2=0 because c2 is never used.
Thus,
The expected payoff is
Thus, in the long term, R will receive an average value of 3.85 from C.
Fair Games
If a game is not strictly determined, it is called a fair game when its value is zero. This
means that the long-term average gain of each player is zero; that is, the losses of
each player equal his gains, so his net gain is zero.
The game
is not strictly determined, and its value is
so it is not a fair game.

Should I Have the Operation?
Medical diagnoses have an element of uncertainty. For two people with the same
symptoms, one may have the disease, and the other may not. Because of the uncer-
tainty involved, further tests or a second opinion is often recommended. Some med-
ical procedures involve nontrivial risks. Should a patient undergo surgery when, his-
torically, there is a relatively small probability a tumor is malignant?
Let’s look at the decision to have surgery or not as a game between the patient
and nature. To illustrate, we use the example in which the expected years of life re-
maining for the patient are
1.
3 years if the disease is present and no surgery is performed.
2.
15 years if the disease is present and surgery is performed.
3.
30 years if no disease is present and no surgery is performed.
4.
25 years if no disease is present and surgery is performed.
Thinking of this as a two-person game, nature has the options of disease (D) and
no disease (ND), whereas the patient has the options of surgery (S) or no surgery
(NS).
The matrix representing these options is
Nature
D ND
Patient
where the patient’s strategy is P=[p1
p2] and nature’s strategy is Q=[q1
q2]. If
nature’s strategy is [1
0], the disease is present; then the patient’s strategy is
clearly [1
0], have surgery. However, because the patient knows only the probability
of nature’s options, we ask how the probability should inﬂuence the patient’s decis-
ion. Suppose the probability that the disease is present is 0.20. Then, Q=
[0.20
0.80]. If the patient opts for surgery, then P=[1
0] and the expected num-
ber of years remaining is
If the patient opts for no surgery, then the expected survival time is
In this case, no surgery appears to be a slightly better option.
The following example, using the preceding payoff matrix, illustrates how we
can estimate when surgery is a better option and when it is not.
The payoff matrix for nature’s options of disease or no disease and a patient’s options
of surgery or no surgery is
Nature
D ND

For what values of Q, the probability of disease, is surgery a better option?

Solution
We determine if surgery is the better option by considering the expected survival
time for both the surgery and no surgery options and using Q=[q1

For surgery:
For no surgery:
Surgery is the better option when
Thus, surgery is the better option when the probability that the disease is present is
greater than 0.294.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 17,pg.749 ■
You might question the use of game theory to help make decisions about medical
treatment because of these reasons:
1.
Game theory assumes both players are intelligent people who know all strate-
gies available to both players and who will adopt a rational approach to the
game.
2.
Data on life expectancies and the probability that a treatment is successful give
information that may be reliable for large groups of people but doesn’t predict
the outcome for a particular individual very well. When we are at risk, we tend
to want to be treated and treated aggressively.
Although nature is not an intelligent person, nature tends to “behave” in a ran-
dom manner, often with known probability. We can play a mixed-strategy game with
nature as if nature were an intelligent person who decided to choose options ran-
domly with a known probability. The medical researcher might ﬁnd such a game use-
ful in determining research actions.

difﬁcult. We sometimes have difﬁculty expressing our thoughts. We make
statements that another person interprets in a way we did not intend.To be
sure that no question arises about the meaning,we sometimes ask lawyers to
draw up a document to convey the precise intention of the information in the
document. Even so, a lawsuit may arise when two parties disagree on the
meaning and intent of the document.
Because problems in clear and precise communication do exist, mathe-
maticians have sought to study these problems in order to clarify them and
make some areas of communication more precise. In this chapter, we intro-
duce you to this area of mathematics,logic.

In logic, we study sentences and relationships between certain kinds of sentences.
In fact, we limit the study to just a portion of sentences used in our daily speech. If
we examine the sentences that we use in daily life, we ﬁnd they can be classiﬁed into
several categories, which include the following:
1.
Open your book to page 93.
(a command)
2.
Did you enjoy the concert?
(a question)
3.
What an exciting game!
(an exclamation)
4.
The sun rises in the east.
(a true declarative statement)
5.
Three plus two is nine.
(a false declarative statement)
6.
That was a good movie.
(an ambiguous sentence)
The last sentence is ambiguous because there may be no agreement on what makes
a movie good.
We restrict our study of logic to declarative sentences that are unambiguous and
that can be classiﬁed as true or false but not both. We call such sentences statements.
Only sentences 4 and 5 above are statements.
Classify each of the following sentences as a statement or not a statement.
(a) When is your next class?
(b) George Washington was the ﬁrst president of the United States.
(c) Andrew Jackson was a great president.
(d) In 2010, February will have 29 days.
(e) That was a hard test!
(f) Three plus ﬁve is eight.
Solution
(a) This is a question, not a declarative sentence, so it is not a statement.
(b) This is a true declarative sentence, so it is a statement.
(c) This is an ambiguous sentence, because there is no uniform understanding of the
meaning of a “great” president. Therefore, it is not a statement.
(d) This is a false declarative sentence, so it is a statement.
(e) This is not a statement because it is an exclamation, not a declarative sentence.
It is also ambiguous.
(f) This is a true declarative sentence, so it is a statement.

Notation
We use the letters p, q, r, . . . to denote statements. Thus, we might use p to repre-
sent a speciﬁc statement such as “Mathematics is required for my degree.” In many
cases, p or q is used to represent a general or unspeciﬁed statement, just as John Doe
Example 1

10.1
Statements
755
or Jane Doe is used to represent a general or unspeciﬁed person. For example, we
might let p represent an arbitrary statement taken from The Story of My Life by
Helen Keller.
Because we deal only with statements that can be classiﬁed as “true” or “false,”
we can assign a truth value to a statement p. We use T to represent the value “true”
and F to represent the value “false” (as you do on a true–false quiz).
Compound Statements
We all frequently use statements in daily conversation that can be constructed by
combining two or more simple statements. We call these compound statements.
Compound statements can be long, complicated, and difﬁcult to understand. Their
meaning depends on the meaning of the component statements and how these com-
ponents are put together into a single statement. We will look at some compound
statements and how to analyze them.
Conjunction
The ﬁrst type of compound statement that we study is a statement like “Ted is tak-
ing art, and Susan is taking history” that can be formed by connecting the statement
“Ted is taking art” to the statement “Susan is taking history” using the word “and.”
If we use the p, q notation, this becomes:
Let p be the statement “Ted is taking art.”
Let q be the statement “Susan is taking history.”
Then “p and q” represents the statement “Ted is taking art, and Susan is taking
history.”
We use the notation “p ¿ q” to denote “p and q.” A statement of the form p ¿ q is
called a conjunction.
When we form a statement by combining statements that we know to be true or
false, can we decide on the truth of the compound statement? The answer is yes.
In particular, the truth value of a conjunction is determined by the truth value of
the statements making up the conjunction. The conjunction “Ted is taking art, and
Susan is taking history” is true when both statements “Ted is taking art” and “Susan
is taking history” are true. If either one or both statements are false, then the con-
junction is false. In general, we can summarize such a situation with a truth table.
When we form a compound statement from two statements, the two statements
could be both true, both false, or one true and one false. The truth table below gives
the truth value of p ¿ q using the four possible combinations of truth values for p
and for q:

The statement “1992 was a leap year, and the Fourth of July is a national holiday in
the United States” is true because both statements “1992 was a leap year” and “The
Fourth of July is a national holiday in the United States” are true. The statement
“1992 was a leap year, and February has 30 days” is false because the statement
“February has 30 days” is false.
■
Disjunction
Two statements can be connected with the word “or” to form a disjunction. The
statement “We advertise in the Sunday paper, or we buy time on TV” is the disjunc-
tion of the statement “We advertise in the Sunday paper” and the statement “We
buy time on TV.” The notation p ¡ q represents the disjunction of statement p with
statement q. We may read p ¡ q as “p or q.”
Identify each of the following statements as conjunction, disjunction, or neither:
(a) The toast is burned, and the eggs are cold.
(b) The cafeteria opens for lunch at 11:00 A.M.
(c) Students in English 102 are required to analyze two poems, or they are required
to analyze two short stories.
Solution
(a) Conjunction
(b) Neither
(c) Disjunction

Again, the truth value of p ¡ q is determined by the truth values of p and of q. The
statement p ¡ q is true when one or both of p and q are true; otherwise, it is false.
The following truth table summarizes the truth value of p ¡ q:
One common use of the connective p or q is interpreted as “either p or q but not
both.” We call this exclusive or. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, mathematicians use p or
q to mean “either p or q or both.” This is called the inclusive or.
Determine the truth value of each of the following statements:
(a) June has 30 days, or September has 31 days.
(b) There are 24 hours in a day, or there are seven days in a week.
(c) Thomas Jefferson was the ﬁrst U.S. president, or there are 65 states in the United
States.
Solution
(a) This is true because the statement “June has 30 days” is true.
(b) This is true because both statements forming the disjunction are true.

Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 10,pg.759 ■
Negation
Sometimes we want to make a statement that means the opposite of a given state-
ment. We call such a statement the negation of the given statement. We can write the
negation of statement p by writing “It is not true that p” (denoted by ~p, which is
read “not p”). The negation of “March is a summer month” is “It is not true that
March is a summer month.” You would probably express this rather awkward sen-
tence as “March is not a summer month.” We deﬁne the negation of a true statement
as false and the negation of a false statement as true. The following table summarizes
the truth values of p and ~p for the possible truth values of p:
Write the negation of the following statements:
(a) Thanksgiving is in November.
(b) 2+2=7
(c) My car won’t start.

(a) This statement is of the form p ¡ (~q), where p is false and q is false (so ~q is
true). Therefore, the statement is true.
(b) This statement is of the form (~p) ¿ (~q), where p is false (~p is true)
and q is false (~q is true). As both ~p and ~q are true, the statement is true.

In the next example, you are to ﬁnd truth values of a statement with variables p, q,

2.
Again list all possible values of p and q under the part of the table just formed
and for each case enter F in the r column. Going from a table with two variables
(four rows) to one with three variables (eight rows), double the number of rows
in the table. Each time you add another variable, double the number of rows
needed to list all possible values of the variables.

Conditional Statements
761
DEFINITION
Conditional
(Implication)
Statement
A conditional (implication) statement is a statement of the form
“If p, then q.”
We denote it by p S q.
In an implication, p S q, we call p the hypothesis and q the conclusion.
Let p be the statement “I study four hours” and q the statement “I can make an A
on the exam.”
(a) Write the statement p S q.
(b) Write the statement q S p.
(c) Write the statement with p as the hypothesis and q as the conclusion.
Solution
(a) If I study four hours, then I can make an A on the exam.
(b) If I can make an A on the exam, then I study four hours.
(c) If I study four hours, then I can make an A on the exam.
As the statements (a) and (c) in the solution are the same statements, this illustrates
that the notation in part (a) describes the same statement as does part (c).
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 1,pg.765 ■
We usually think that the truth value of the hypothesis of a conditional has some ef-
fect on the conclusion. For example, the amount of time spent studying has some
effect on the exam grade. However, we can construct implications where the hypoth-
esis and conclusion have no relationship. The sentence “If June has 30 days, then
Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall” is a true conditional even though the number of
days in June has nothing to do with Humpty Dumpty. Although such a conditional
might appear to be somewhat nonsensical, and you might not use this form in con-
versation, we still want to assign it a truth value. The following table shows how the
truth values of p and q determine the truth value of p S q:
To assign T as the truth value of p S q in the last two lines may not seem natural.
You might prefer a value of F, or you may think it doesn’t make much sense to put
either T or F. Granted, we most often use a conditional statement in situations
where the ﬁrst two lines apply. However, in logic we insist that statements be either
true or false, so we must assign values to the last two cases. The truth table given is
the deﬁnition accepted by mathematicians.
Even so, we do not arbitrarily assign true values. The following examples help
us to understand this.
Your professor tells you, “If you make an A on the ﬁnal exam, I will give you an
A in the course.” You make an A on the ﬁnal exam, and the professor gives you a B
in the course. Isn’t your conclusion that the professor made a false statement? (Or in
less nice terms, the professor lied.) Thus, assigning the value F to p S q when p is
T and q is F is consistent with our usual interpretation.

Chapter 10
Logic
Dick has just received a driver’s license, and his parents impose some rules to
help him become a responsible driver. One of the rules is “If you speed, you will be
grounded.” This rule is of the form p S q, a conditional. When Dick returns one
evening, he is asked, “Did you speed?” He had not sped and truthfully answered,
“No.” His parents do not ground Dick. Thus, p and q both have the truth value F.
Even though both parts of the rule are false, the rule has not been violated, so we
should assign the value T to the conditional in this case.
Another evening Dick returns quite late and he again is asked “Did you speed?”
His truthful answer was. “No.” Dick was grounded because he stayed out past the
time to be home. Here p has the value F and q the value T. Has the rule been vio-
lated? The rule does not state that speeding is the only reason for grounding. Thus,
the rule has not been violated, and we should assign the value T to the rule.
Determine the truth of the following conditionals:
(a) If 2*3=6, then 15-4=11.
(b) If 3+3=6, then 2=1.
(c) If there are 8 days in a week, then June has 30 days.
(d) If there are 8 days in a week, then August has 79 days.
Solution
(a) True because the hypothesis and conclusion are true
(b) False because the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false
(c) True because the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true
(d) True because the hypothesis and conclusion are false
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 3,pg.765 ■
Notice that a conditional is always true when the hypothesis is false, regardless of
whether or not the conclusion is true. A true conclusion always makes a conditional
true.
Converse,Inverse,and Contrapositive of a Conditional
We have just discussed how to form a conditional statement from two given state-
ments. Actually, more than one conditional can be formed. For example, the state-
ments “My car has a ﬂat tire” and “I want to ride to the game with you” can be used
to form the conditional “If my car has a ﬂat tire, then I want to ride to the game with
you.” They can also be combined to form the conditional “If I want to ride to the
game with you, then my car has a ﬂat tire.” Two other conditionals, which are com-
monly formed by using the negation of the given statements, are “If my car does not
have a ﬂat tire, then I do not want to ride to the game with you” and “If I do not want
to ride to the game with you, then my car does not have a ﬂat tire.” Because the four
conditionals of these forms occur frequently in mathematics, we give them names:
the original conditional, the converse, the inverse, and the contrapositive.
From a given conditional “If p then q” we can form the following conditionals:
Converse: “If q, then p.” (q S p)
Inverse: “If not p, then not q.” (~p S ~q)
Contrapositive: “If not q, then not p.” (~q S ~p)

Write the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of “If it does not rain, then we want
to go on a picnic.”
Solution
Converse: “If we want to go on a picnic, then it does not rain.”
Inverse: “If it does rain, then we do not want to go on a picnic.”
Contrapositive: “If we do not want to go on a picnic, then it does rain.”
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 5,pg.765 ■
Now let’s compare the truth tables of a conditional and its converse, inverse, and
contrapositive. We can summarize them in one table as follows:
Notice that p S q and q S p have different truth values when p is true and q is
false or vice versa. This indicates that a conditional and its converse cannot be in-
terchanged because a converse might not be true even though the conditional is. It
is a common error for some people to think that a conditional and its converse have
exactly the same meaning. You certainly would not accept that the statement “If I
live in Chicago, then I live in Illinois” has the same meaning as the statement “If I
live in Illinois, then I live in Chicago.”
Also notice that p S q (a statement) and ~q S ~p (its contrapositive) have
exactly the same truth values in all cases. This means that one statement can be sub-
stituted for the other. Similarly, q S p (the converse of p S q) and ~p S ~q (the
inverse of p S q) also have the same truth values. For example, the statements “If
I go home, I will have some home cooking” and “If I do not have some home cook-
ing, then I do not go home” have the same meaning. Also the statements “If I have
home cooking, then I go home” and “If I do not go home, then I do not have home
cooking” have the same meaning.
Biconditional
Another fundamental compound statement is the biconditional statement, denoted
p 4 q, and read “p if and only if q.” You can also think of the biconditional, p 4 q,
as (p S q) ¿ (q S p). We develop the truth table for the biconditional as follows:

(a) The biconditional is true because both 2+2=4 and 5*2=10 are true.
(b) This is true because the component statements have the same truth value, false.
(c) This is false because the statements x+x=2x and 2=1 have different truth
values, true and false, respectively.

EQUIVALENT STATEMENTS
Two compound statements are logically equivalent, or equivalent, if they have ex-
actly the same truth values. This means that a statement can be substituted for its
equivalent because when one is true, the other is also true, and when one is false, the
other is false. Two equivalent statements will have the same truth values for any
choice of truth values of the component parts of the compound statements.
Show that p S q and ~p ¡ q are logically equivalent statements.
Solution
We form the truth table for each statement and see whether they are the same. We
can form the table as follows:
Note that for each choice of p and q (each row), the truth values of p S q and
~p ¡ q are the same. Therefore, the statements are equivalent.

Let p represent the statement “You check the box” and let q represent the statement
“You can take the standard deduction.”
Then statement (a) is p S ~q and statement (b) is q S ~p. We form a truth
table and compare the truth values of p S ~q and q S ~p.
As p S ~q and q S ~p have identical truth values, they are equivalent.

VALID ARGUMENTS
We all like to win an argument or prove a point. Unfortunately, false information or
intimidation, not logic, sometimes wins arguments. Although we like to win argu-
ments, it is more important that we draw a valid conclusion from information given.
We would like a jury to reach a verdict that is supported by evidence. We do not like
to see a person’s reputation ruined because an invalid conclusion was drawn from in-
formation given. A business executive can harm the corporation if a decision is not
supported by the facts relevant to the decision.
Some arguments are generally recognized as invalid. For example, those who ac-
cept the premise “If you live in Omaha, then you live in Nebraska” will not accept
the conclusion “If you live in Nebraska, then you live in Omaha.” However, it ap-
pears that a signiﬁcant number of people who accept the premise “If you are homo-
sexual, then you will acquire AIDS” will accept the conclusion “If you acquire
AIDS, then you are homosexual.” Actually, this AIDS argument and the Omaha ar-
gument are of the same form. Each one has a premise of the form p S q and a con-
clusion of the form q S p. We would like an argument to be valid or invalid based
on whether or not the premises support the conclusion, not on which statements are
used. We are interested in arguments or proofs that are logically sound; we call them
valid arguments.
An argument consists of a statement, called the conclusion, that follows from
one or more statements, called the premises. If the conclusion follows logically from
the premises, we say the argument is valid. You might ask what we mean by “the con-
clusion follows logically from the premises.” Here is what we mean. Suppose an ar-
gument has two statements for its premises: call them p and q. Call the conclusion r.
The conclusion, r, follows logically from the premises, p and q, if whenever all the
premises, p and q, are true, then the conclusion, r, is also true. An argument may
have any number (one or more) premises.
An argument with premises p1, p2, p3, . . . , pn and a conclusion r is valid if r is true when
all of p1, p2, p3, . . . , pn are true.
Here is a simple example of a valid argument.
Let’s put this in symbolic form. Write
p:
q: Jenny has a job.
Jenny saves money.
Premises:
Conclusion: 
If Jenny has a job, she saves money.
Jenny has a job.
Jenny saves money.
Example 1

DEFINITION
Law of Detachment
10.4
Valid Arguments
769
Now the argument can be written in the notation
where the premises are written above the line and the conclusion below. The argu-
ment is valid if q is true whenever both p S q and p are true. Check the following
truth table:
Notice that when p S q and p are both true (ﬁrst line only), q is also true, so the ar-
gument is valid.
The entries in the truth table would be the same if statements other than “Jenny
has a job” and “Jenny saves money” are used for p and q. Therefore, for any state-
ments p and q the argument
is a valid argument. This is sometimes called the Law of Detachment.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 1,pg.773 ■
For any pair of statements p and q, the argument
is a valid argument.
By the Law of Detachment, the following arguments are valid:
(a) Premises:
If my car has a ﬂat tire, I will ride to the game with Sam.
My car has a ﬂat tire.
Conclusion:
I will ride to the game with Sam.
(b) Premises:
If I make an A on the ﬁnal, I will make an A in the course.

THEOREM
Valid Argument
770
Chapter 10
Logic
We can determine the validity of an argument in a way a little different from the
deﬁnition by observing that if all the premises p1, p2, p3 , . . . , pn are true, then 
p1 ¿ p2 ¿ . . . ¿ pn S r
is true only when r is also true. If any one of p1, p2, . . . , pn is false, then
p1 ¿ p2 ¿ . . . ¿ pn is false. In this case, the conditional p1 ¿ p2 ¿ . . . ¿ pn S r is true.
All of this makes for a situation where an argument with premises p1, p2, . . . , pn
and conclusion r is valid provided the conditional p1 ¿ p2 ¿ . . . ¿ pn S r is
true for all possible values of the premises and conclusion. (A statement that is
always true is called a tautology.) This approach will be used to test the validity of
arguments.
An argument with premises p1, p2, p3, . . . , pn and a conclusion r is valid, if
p1 ¿ p2 ¿ . . . ¿ pn S r
is true for all possible truth values of p1, p2, p3, . . . , pn and r.
Show that the following argument is valid:
Solution
By the theorem above we can prove the argument valid by showing (p ¿ q) ¿ q S p
is true for all possible values of p and q. We check the truth table for

The Real Number Line
The most basic numbers in our study of mathematics are the natural numbers,
1, 2, 3, 4, . . .
These are in fact the numbers that we use to count. They can be represented graph-
ically as points on a line, as in Figure A–1.

FIGURE A–2
Begin with a starting point on the line, which we label 0, and a convenient unit
scale. Starting at 0, mark off equal lengths to the right. These marks represent 
1, 2, 3, . . . .
We can mark off lengths in the opposite direction from 0 and let them represent
numbers, the negatives of the natural numbers (Figure A–2). This collection of
numbers represented by the marks on the line is written
. . . , –5, – 4, –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .
and is called the set of integers. We call the number represented by the symbol 0
zero. It is neither positive nor negative.
Other numbers, the fractions, can be represented with points between the inte-
gers. In Figure A–3, point A, halfway between 1 and 2, represents 
point B, one-
quarter of the way from 3 to 4, represents 
Point C is three-quarters of the way
from –4 to –5, so it represents 
These numbers together with the integers are
called rational numbers.

All these points can be expressed in terms of ﬁnite or inﬁnite decimals. Point A
is the point 1.5, B the point 3.25, and C the point –4.75. Every rational number can
be expressed either as a ﬁnite decimal that terminates, such as A, B, and C above, or
as a decimal that repeats inﬁnitely. For example, 
is a rational number that can be
written in decimal form as 5.333 . . . ; the 3 repeats endlessly.
There are, however, certain numbers called irrational numbers that do not have
any pattern of repetition in their decimal form. One such number is 
Its decimal
form is 1.414213 . . . .
The set of all rational and irrational numbers is called the set of real numbers.
One way to visualize the set of real numbers is to think of each point on the line as
representing a real number.
The Arithmetic of Real Numbers
There are four useful operations on the set of real numbers: addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. The following tables summarize some rules that govern
these operations:

A.2 SOLVING LINEAR EQUATIONS
Numerous disciplines including science, technology, the social sciences, business,
manufacturing, and government ﬁnd mathematical techniques essential in day-to-
day operations. They depend heavily on mathematical equations that describe con-
ditions or relationships between quantities.
In an equation such as
4x-5=7
the symbol x, called a variable, represents an arbitrary, an unspeciﬁed, or an un-
known number just as John Doe and Jane Doe often denote an arbitrary, un-
speciﬁed, or unknown person.
The equation 4x-5=7 may be true or false depending on the choice of the
number x. If we substitute the number 3 for x in
4x-5=7
both sides become equal and we say that x=3 is a solution of the equation. If 5 is
substituted for x, then both sides are not equal, so x=5 is not a solution.
It may help a sales representative to know that the expression 0.20x+11 de-
scribes the daily rental of a car, where x represents mileage. Furthermore, the solu-
tion of the equation 0.20x+11=40 answers the question “You paid $40 for car
rental, how many miles did you drive?” Solutions of equations can sometimes help
one to make a decision or gain needed information.
One basic procedure for solving an equation is to obtain a sequence of equiva-
lent equations with the goal of isolating the variable on one side of the equation and
the appropriate number on the other side.

A.2
Solving Linear Equations
781
The following two operations help to isolate the variable and ﬁnd the solution.
1.
The same number may be added to or subtracted from both sides of an equation.
2.
Both sides of an equation may be multiplied or divided by a nonzero number.
Either of these operations yields another equation that is equivalent to the ﬁrst,
in other words, a second equation that has the same solution as the ﬁrst.
Solve the equation 3x+4=19.
Solution
We begin to isolate x by subtracting 4 from both sides:
3x+4-4=19-4
3x=15
Next, divide both sides by 3:
is the solution. We can check our answer by substituting x=5 into the original
equation,
3(5)+4=15+4=19
so the solution checks.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 3,pg.783 ■
Solve 4x-2=2x+12.
Solution
(First, add 2 to both sides.)
(Next, subtract 2x from both sides.)
(Now divide both sides by 2.)
Check: 4(7)-2=28-2=26(left-handside)and2(7)+12=14+12=26
(right-hand side), so it checks.
Now You Are Ready to Work Exercise 7,pg.783 ■

Solution
We show two ways to solve this. First, use rules of fractions to combine the terms on
the left-hand side:
(Convert fractions to the same denominator.)
(Now add the fractions.)
(Now multiply both sides by 6.)
An alternative, and simpler, method is the following:
Multiply through by 6 (the product of the denominators):

A.3 COORDINATE SYSTEMS
We have all seen a map, a house plan, or a wiring diagram that shows information
recorded on a ﬂat surface. Each of these uses some notation unique to the subject to
convey the desired information. In mathematics, we often use a ﬂat surface called a
plane to draw ﬁgures and locate points. We place a reference system in the plane to
record and communicate information accurately. The standard mathematical refer-
ence system consists of a horizontal and a vertical line (called axes). These two per-
pendicular axes form a Cartesian, or rectangular, coordinate system. They intersect
at a point called the origin.
We name the horizontal axis the x-axis, and we name the vertical axis the y-axis.
The origin is labeled O.
Two numbers are used to describe the location of a point in the plane, and they
are recorded in the form (x, y). For example, x=3 and y=2 for the point (3, 2).
The ﬁrst number, 3, called the x-coordinate, or abscissa, represents the horizontal
distance from the y-axis to the point. The second number, 2, called the y-coordinate
or ordinate, represents the vertical distance measured from the x-axis to the point.
The point (3, 2) is shown as point P in Figure A– 4. Points located to the right of the
y-axis have positive x-coordinates; those to the left have negative x-coordinates. The
y-coordinate is positive for points located above the x-axis and negative for those
located below.
Figure A– 4 shows other examples of points in this coordinate system: Q is the
point (–4, 3), and R is the point (–3, –2.5). The origin O has coordinates (0, 0).

113 pounds?

collection. What was the reading on the scale?

Coordinate Systems

Figure A–5 shows the points (–3, 2), (–4, –2), (1, 1), and (1, –2) plotted on the
Cartesian coordinate system.
The coordinate axes divide the plane into four parts called quadrants. The quad-
rants are labeled I, II, III, and IV as shown in Figure A–6. Point A is located in the
ﬁrst quadrant, where x and y are both positive; B, in the second quadrant, where x
is negative and y is positive; C in the third quadrant, where both x and y are nega-
tive; and D is in the fourth quadrant, where x is positive and y is negative. Points A
and E lie in the same quadrant.
René Descartes (1596 –1650), a French philosopher–mathematician, invented
the Cartesian coordinate system. His invention of the coordinate system is one of the
outstanding ideas in the history of mathematics because it combined algebra and
geometry in a way that enables us to use algebra to solve geometry problems and to
use geometry to clarify algebraic concepts.

A.4 LINEAR INEQUALITIES AND INTERVAL NOTATION
•
Solving Inequalities
•
Interval Notation
We frequently use inequalities in our daily conversation. They may take the form
“Which store has the lower price?” “Did you make a higher grade?” “Our team
scored more points.” “My expenses are greater than my income.” Statements such
as these basically state that one quantity is greater than another. Statements using
the terms “greater than” or “less than” are called inequalities. Our goal is to solve in-
equalities. First, we give some terminology and notation.
The symbol 6 means “less than,” and 7 means “greater than.” Just remember
that each of these symbols points to the smaller quantity. The notations a>b and
b<a have exactly the same meaning. We may interpret the deﬁnition of a>b in
three equivalent ways. At times, one may be more useful than the other, so choose
the most appropriate one.
If a and b are real numbers, the following statements have the same meaning.
(a) a>b means that a lies to the right of b on a number line.
(b) a>b means that there is a positive number p such that a=b+p.
(c) a>b means that a-b is a positive number p.
The positive numbers lie to the right of zero on a number line, and the negative
numbers lie to the left.
We will also use the symbols 6 (less than),  (greater than or equal to), and
 (less than or equal to).
a<b means b>a.
a  b means a=b or a>b.
a  b means a=b or a<b.
The numbers 5, 8, 17, –2, –3, and –15 are plotted on a number line in Figure A–10.

Notice the following:
1.
(a) 17 lies to the right of 5.
(b) 17=5+12
(c) 17-5=12
Each of these three statements is equivalent to saying that 17>5.
2.
8>–3 because 8-(–3)=8+3=11 (by part (c) of the above deﬁnition).
3.
–2>–15 because –2=–15+13 (by part (b) of the above deﬁnition, where
p=13).

Solving Inequalities
By the solution of an inequality like
3x+5>23
we mean the value or values of x that make the statement true. The method for solv-
ing inequalities is similar to that for solving equations. We want to operate on an in-
equality in a way that gives an equivalent inequality but that enables us to determine
the solution.
Here are some simple examples of useful properties of inequalities.
1.
Because 18>4, 18+6>4+6; that is, 24>10 (6 added to both sides).
2.
Because 23>–1, 23-7>–1-7; that is, 16>–8 (7 subtracted from both
sides).
3.
Because 6>2, 4(6)>4(2); that is, 24>8 (both sides multiplied by 4).
4.
Because 10>3, –2(10)<–2(3); that is, –20<–6 (both sides multiplied
by –2).
5.
Because
that is, –5>–7. (Divide both sides by 3.)
6.
Because 
that is, –10<–3. (Divide both sides by –2.)
■
These examples illustrate basic properties that are useful in solving inequalities.
For real numbers a, b, and c, the following are true:
1.
Adding a number to both sides of an inequality leaves the direction of the in-
equality unchanged.
If a>b, then a+c>b+c.
2.
Subtraction of a number from both sides of an inequality leaves the direction
of the inequality unchanged.
If a>b, then a-c>b-c.
3.
Multiply both sides of an inequality by a nonzero number:
(a) If a>b and c is positive, then ac>bc.
(b) If a>b and c is negative, then ac<bc. (Notice the change from 7 to 6.)
4.
Divide both sides of an inequality by a nonzero number:
(a) If a>b and c is positive, then 
(b) If a>b and c is negative, then 
(Notice the change from 7 to 6.)
(Note: All these properties hold if 7 is replaced by 6 and vice versa; and if 7 is replaced by
 and 6 is replaced by .)
We use these properties to solve an inequality—that is, to ﬁnd the values of x
that make the inequality true. In general, we proceed by ﬁnding equivalent inequal-
ities that will eventually isolate x on one side of the inequality and the appropriate
number on the other side.

Solve the inequality 3x+5>14.
Solution
Begin with the given inequality:
(Next, subtract 5 from each side (Property 2))
(Now divide each side by 3 (Property 4))
Thus, all x greater than 3 make the inequality true. This solution can be graphed on
a number line as shown in Figure A–11. The empty circle indicates that x=3 is
omitted from the solution, and the heavy line indicates the values of x included in
the solution.

The next example illustrates a problem that involves two inequalities.
Solve and graph 3<2x+5  13.
Solution
This inequality means both 3<2x+5 and 2x+5  13. Solve it in a manner sim-
ilar to the preceding examples except that you try to isolate the x in the middle.
Begin with the given inequality:
(Subtract 5 from all parts of the inequality.)
(Divide each part by 2.)
The solution consists of all numbers between –1 and 4, including 4 but not including
–1. The graph of the solution (see Figure A–14) shows an empty circle at –1 be-
cause –1 is not a part of the solution. It shows a solid circle at 4 because 4 is a part
of the solution. The solid line between –1 and 4 indicates that all numbers between
–1 and 4 are included in the solution.

Interval Notation
The solution of an inequality can be represented by yet another notation, the interval
notation. Identify the portion of the number line that represents the solution of an in-
equality by its end points; brackets or parentheses indicate whether or not the end
point is included in the solution. A parenthesis indicates that the end point is not in-
cluded, and a bracket indicates that the end point is included. For example, the nota-
tion (–1, 4] means –1<x  4 and indicates the set of all numbers between –1 and 4
with –1 excluded and 4 included in the set. The notation (–1, 4) means –1<x<4
and indicates that both –1 and 4 are excluded from the set. The notation (–1, q) de-
notes the set of all numbers greater than –1, x>–1. The symbol q denotes inﬁnity
and indicates that there is no upper bound to the interval.
Table A–1 shows the variations of the interval notation.

GRAPHING
The TI-83/84 graphing calculator will graph functions written in the form y=f(x).
It will not graph functions written as 3x+2y=27 or x2+y2=5. To graph
3x+2y=27, you must solve for y and graph 
or y = –1.5x+13.5
or y=(27-3x)/2.
To enter the equation to be graphed, display the <y=> screen. It is obtained by
pressing 
.
To enter an equation like y=–2x+3, key the numbers and symbols of the
equation. The “x” in the equation is entered with the key 
. To initiate
graphing press the 
key.
The Range
From time to time, you will want to change the portion of the x-y plane that shows
on the screen. Here’s how. Press 
and you will obtain a menu that in-
cludes something like
WINDOW
Xmin=10
Xmax=10
Xscl=1
Ymin=–10
Ymax=10
Yscl=1
Yres=1
xMin and xMax specify the range of x-values that will show on the screen, xScl
speciﬁes the spacing of the tick marks on the x-axis. yMin, yMax, and yScl do the
same for y.
The Standard Screen
The screen that shows x from –10 to 10 and y from –10 to 10 is called the standard
screen. For the standard screen, xMin and the rest of the range settings can be set
automatically with 
<6:ZStandard>.
The Square Window
The screen on the graphing calculator is 1.5 times as wide as high. Therefore, the stan-
dard window with ranges of –10 to 10 for both x and y results in a different scale for
the two axes. A graph is actually distorted somewhat. To obtain a graph with no dis-
tortion, the axes must be scaled the same. This is done by selecting the square win-
dow option. Here’s how to do it: 
<5:ZSquare>.

Finding the Intersection of Two Graphs
797
The TRACE Function
The TRACE function has the useful feature that it moves the cursor along a curve
and gives the coordinates of the point where the cursor is located.
1.
To initiate the TRACE function press 
.
2.
To trace, move the cursor toward the left with the 
key and to the right with
the
key. As you do so, the x- and y-coordinates show at the bottom of the
screen.
EVALUATING A FUNCTION
1.
You can evaluate a function for a given value of x by tracing the graph until the
x-coordinate reaches the desired value. The corresponding function value shows
as the y-coordinate.
The TRACE function is useful in locating a value of x that corresponds
to a given y-value. Trace the graph until the given value of y shows as the 
y-coordinate and read the value of the x-coordinate.
Because the cursor moves in discrete steps when using TRACE, it may skip
over a value of x that you want to use in evaluating the function. By zooming in,
you reduce the step size and thus can obtain values of x closer to, if not actually
equal to, the desired value.
2.
Using value you can evaluate a function more accurately for a given value of x.
To illustrate how, suppose you have entered y1=2x2+3 in the <y> window.
For a value of x—say, x=4.2—you obtain y1=2(4.2)2+3 with the se-
quence
<1:value> 
. When <x=> shows on the screen, enter
4.2
. The value y=38.28 will show on the screen.
ZOOM
The ZOOM feature zooms in or out at the location of the cursor and gives a magniﬁed
or reduced view. The location of the cursor determines the center of the new area. The
ranges of x and y are reduced by one fourth or enlarged by a factor of 4.
To zoom in and magnify a part of the area:
1.
On the graph, move the cursor near the point you want to be the center of the
new area and press 
.
2.
Now zoom in by 
<2:Zoom In> 
.
FINDING THE INTERSECTION OF TWO GRAPHS
The TRACE command can be used to estimate the point of intersection of two
graphs. Locate the cursor on one of the graphs and trace toward the point of inter-
section. You may zoom in to obtain a more accurate estimate.
Press the 
or 
key to move the cursor from one graph to the other. As you
move from one graph to the other, compare the y-coordinates of points on the graph
to help determine the accuracy of the estimates.

point of intersection.
CONSTRUCTING A TABLE
(See also Section 1.1.) The Table function allows you to specify a list of values of x
and then compute the corresponding values of a function, or functions, as deﬁned in
the 
menu. You may let the calculator generate a list of equally spaced values of
x or you may list them one by one. 
Setting Up the x-List
(a) Let the calculator generate the list.
•
Select 
and on the screen that appears enter the starting value of
x, say 5, at TblStart.
•
Enter the amount by which you want to increment the values of x, say 3, at
∆Tbl.
•
Select Auto for Indpnt.
The calculator will generate a list for x beginning with 5 and increasing by 3
throughout the list.
(b) The user enters the x values.
•
Select 
and on the screen that appears you can ignore TblStart
and ∆Tbl.
•
Select Ask for Indpnt.
Calculating the Formulas for y
Open the 
screen and enter the desired formula for Y1. If other formulas are
needed, enter them in Y2, Y3, . . . .
To view the table, press 
and the screen will show the table of x and y
values. Only two columns of y values show. If you have entered three or more for-
mulas for y, scroll to the right to view those columns. If you have entered the for-
mulas for y before entering the values of x, the calculated values of y will apear as
you enter the values of x.
The table shows as many as six digits of the numbers. If a value of y is more than
six digits, select the number and the 12-digit form shows at the bottom of the screen.

Using a TI-83/84 Graphing Calculator
Multiplying All Entries in a Row by a Constant.
To multiply row 1 of a matrix
named [B] by 5:
<MATH> <E:*row(>
Complete the command with <*row(5, [B], 1)>
Adding Two Rows of a Matrix.
This adds two rows and places the result in the sec-
ond row named.
To add row 2 to row 3 of a matrix named [B] and to place the result in row 3:
<MATH> <D:row+(>
Complete the command as <row+([B], 2, 3)>.
Multiplying a Row by a Constant and Adding to Another Row.
To multiply row 2
by –5 and add the result to row 4 and then replace row 4 with the result:
<MATH> <F:*row+(>
When <*row+(> appears, complete the command with <row+(–5, [B], 2, 4)>.
A Sequence of Row Operations on a Matrix.
If you perform a sequence of row op-
erations on matrix [B] then, at any stage, the answer is the last operation performed
on the original matrix. For example, the following sequence
*row(2, [B], 1)
row+([B], 1, 3)
*row+(– 4, [B], 2, 3)
will give the same ﬁnal answer as
*row+(– 4, [B], 2, 3)
gives. Each operation in the sequence operates on the original matrix B and saves
the result in a temporary location, ANS, not in B.
On the other hand, the sequence
*row(2, [B], 1)
row+(ANS, 1, 3)
*row+(– 4, ANS, 2, 3)
will give the answer that carries through each operation in the sequence with the
ﬁnal result stored in ANS.
A row operation on a matrix—say, [B]—does not modify [B] itself unless other
action is taken. You can record the effect of a row operation on [B] by a store
command.
The row operations can be carried through the sequence with the following
commands:
*row(2, [B], 1)
[B]
row+([B], 1, 3)
[B]
*row+(– 4, [B], 2, 3)

Row Echelon Form of a Matrix.
A system of equations can be solved by reducing
the augmented matrix to the reduced echelon form through a sequence of row op-
erations. This can be quite tedious for larger systems of equations.

The basic procedure of reducing a matrix to solve a system uses a series of row
operations in an attempt to reduce the columns (except for the last one) to columns
containing a single entry of 1 and all other entries 0.
rref.
The command <rref> reduces a matrix to its reduced echelon form. Here is
the procedure for using <rref>: 
Display <rref(> on the screen by: 
<MATH> <B:rref(>. Then ﬁll in the
matrix name, say [A], giving <rref([A])>. Press 
and the reduced ech-
elon matrix will appear on the screen.
STATISTICS
The data for statistical analyses are entered in a list, or lists, and the analysis is done
on the lists.
Entering Data Into a List
You may use up to six lists with names L1, L 2, . . . , L6 and the names appear on the
keyboard above the keys for 1, 2, . . . , 6.
Clearing Lists
To clear the lists L1 and L2:
<EDIT> <4:CLRLST> 
.
Entering Data
To enter data in L1 (scores) and L 2 (frequency): 
<EDIT> 
. Enter a
score in L1 and press 
. Repeat until all scores are entered. Press 
to move
to L2. Enter frequencies in a similar manner; then press 
.
Statistical Calculations
The TI-83/84 has two menus, the STAT and LIST menus, for calculating some of the
measures of central tendency and dispersion. In both cases, the data are entered in
list L1 for a single list of scores. For a frequency table, list the scores in L1 and the
corresponding frequencies in L2.
STAT Menu
To obtain the statistical calculations for a single list in L1 use
<CALC><1:1-Var stats>

These values give you the ﬁve-point summary and both forms of the standard devia-
tion. For a frequency table with scores in L1 and frequencies in L2 use
<CALC><1:1-Var stats> L1,L2 
to obtain the same list of values.
LIST Menu
Using the
<MATH> menu, you can obtain the mean, maximum, minimum, me-
dian,samplevariance,andstandarddeviationfromasinglelistinL1orafrequency table
in L1 and L2. Unlike the STAT menu, these values do not appear all at the same time.
They must be obtained separately. For example, the mean is obtained with
<MATH><3:mean(L1)
for a single list and with
<MATH><3:mean(L1,L2)
for a frequency table. Although this is less convenient than using STAT, it has the ad-
vantage that the calculations can be used in other formulas. One example is the cal-
culation of the range.

scores are in the interval (XMIN, XMAX). This interval will be the x-axis on the
graph. XSCL is the width of a bar on the histogram and determines the interval
length of each category. YMIN and YMAX determine the range of frequencies
(the y-scale).
6.
Deﬁne the histogram.
Three plots are allowed. This example will use PLOT 1.
Press

The federal tax is $19,200, the state tax is $7200, and the city tax is $3200
73.
Inﬁnite number of solutions
75.
(a) Let
(b) x5=5, x6=5 yields x1=0, x2=15, x3=25,
x1=number supplied by Sweats-Plus to Spirit Shop 1
x4=15. x5=10, x6=5 yields x1=5, x2=10, x3=25,
x2=number supplied by Sweats-Plus to Spirit Shop 2
x4=10. x5=0, x6=15 yields x1=5, x2=20, x3=15,
x3=number supplied by Sweats-Plus to Spirit Shop 3
x4=10. Other ways are possible.
x4=number supplied by Imprint-Sweats to Spirit Shop 1
(c) x5 represents the number of sweatshirts supplied by
x5=number supplied by Imprint-Sweats to Spirit Shop 2
Imprint-Sweats to Spirit Shop 2. Because x2=20-x5,
x6=number supplied by Imprint-Sweats to Spirit Shop 3
x5 must be no greater than 20, or else x2 would be a
negative number. Thus, x5  20.
The system of equations is
The solution is
(d) If Imprint-Sweats supplies no sweatshirts to Spirit
x1+x4=15
x1=–10+x5+x6
Shop 2 and Spirit Shop 3, then x5=0 and x6=0 so
x2+x5=20
x2=20-x5
x1=–10. Thus, the order cannot be ﬁlled.
x3+x6=30
x3=30-x6
(e) Because x1=–10+x5+x6, in order for x1  0,
x1+x2+x3=40
x4=25-x5-x6
then x5+x6  10. Imprint-Sweats must supply a total of 
x4+x5+x6=25
10 or more to Spirit Shops 2 and 3.
(f) Because x2=20-x5, and 0  x5  20, then x2  20. Thus, Sweats-Plus supplies 20 or less to Spirit Shop 2.

(a) Label the trafﬁc ﬂow on each block by x1, x2, p , x7 as shown. Then the condition that in-

(b) The solution to the above system is
x1=700-x7
x2=x7
x3=100+x6
x4=200+x6
x5=700+x6-x7
(c) x3 represents the trafﬁc ﬂow on 10th St. between Colcord
and Blair. Because x3=100+x6, x3  100. The minimum
trafﬁc ﬂow is 100 vehicles per hour when x6=0. The other
trafﬁc ﬂows then become
x1=700-x7

(a) x1=0.5+3.5x4
(b) x2=0.5-1.83x4 implies 0.5-1.83x4>0, so 
Thus, 
x2=0.5-1.83x4
0<x4<0.273. x3=2.33x4 implies 0<x3<0.636. x1=0.5+3.5x4 implies
x3=2.33x4
x1>0.5 and the maximum value of x1 occurs when x4 is maximum. Thus, 
x1<0.5+3.5(0.273)=1.456 so 0.50<x1<1.456. x2=0.5-1.83x4
implies x2<0.5 and x2 is minimum, 0, when x4 reaches 0.273 so 0<x2<0.5.

In a maximization problem, the proﬁt line is 
moved away from the origin until a corner point is 
the only point it touches in the feasible region. 
To ﬁnd the optimal integer solution move the 
proﬁt line outward until it touches the last point 
in the feasible region with integer coordinates. 
In this case that is the point (7, 0); so the optimal 
proﬁt occurs when x=7 and y=0. If neither x
nor y can be zero, the last point is (6, 1).

(a) 12x+10y+s1=120
3x+10y+s2= 60
7x+12y+s3= 84
(b) The point(x, y, s1, s2, s3,)may not lie in the feasible region.
The point(x, y)satisﬁes the constraint12x+10y 120, 
so it lies in the half plane that is the solution to this
constraint.
(c) The point (x, y) lies on the boundary line
12x+10y=120. It may or may not be in the feasible region
depending on where it is on the line.
(d) The point (x, y) is
not in the feasible region when s1 is negative.
(e) The point
(x, y, 0, s2, 0) satisﬁes the ﬁrst equation and s1=0, so the
point is on the “line” 12x+10y+s1=120. Similarly, 
(x, y, 0, s2, 0) satisﬁes the third line and s3=0, so the point
lies on the “line” 7x+12y+s3=84. Thus, the point 
(x, y) is the intersection of the lines 12x+10y=120 and
7x+12y=84.

316.7 cartons of screwdrivers,
312.5 of chisels, and no putty knives, for proﬁt of $3458.33. It is reasonable to round this to 317 cartons of screwdrivers,
312 cartons of chisels, and no putty knives.
39.
The maximum proﬁt is $568.60 using 116 of Pack I, 63 of Pack II,
and 186 of Pack III.

(a) They should prepare 45 packages of Breakfast Time and 10 packages of Break Time
for maximum receipts of $730.
(b) All the packets of regular coffee and hot chocolate were used. For the decaf coffee,
280 of the 410 available packets were used, so 130 were left.

The sequence of corner points used was (0, 0), (0, 50),
and (30, 20).

53.
(a) A negative appears in the last column, indicating that you are outside the feasible region.
(b) It goes to the
corner (6.58, 0, 0) instead of (0, 0, 5). If the pivoting continues, it will eventually reach the optimal solution.
55.
57.
59.
The solution is (0, 6.81, 17.96, 12.02) with a proﬁt of $2075.71. However, the solution must be an integer number 
of patterns, so we might round the solution to (0, 7, 18, 12), which gives a maximum proﬁt of $2085. Unfortunately, 
this scheme requires 1255 tulips, 1610 daffodils, and 196 boxwood, while there are only 1250 tulips, 1600 daffodils 
and 195 boxwood available. We can round down to (0, 6, 18, 12) with a proﬁt of $2040 and remain within the
constraints.

Answers to Selected Odd-Numbered Exercises
(a) The constraints are
x1+x2+x3  4200
(quantity shipped from Cleveland)
x4+x5+x6  4800
(quantity shipped from St. Louis)
x7+x8+x9  3700
(quantity shipped from Pittsburgh)
x1+x4+x7=5400
(quantity shipped to Chicago)
x2+x5+x8=3800
(quantity shipped to Dallas)
x3+x6+x9=2700
(quantity shipped to Atlanta)
with all variables nonnegative.
Because we are to minimize shipping costs, the objective function is
Minimize z=35x1+64x2+60x3+37x4+59x5+51x6+49x7+68x8+57x9
(b) The initial simplex tableau is
57.
Maximum z=308 at the corner (14, 30, 0)
59.
The maximum value of z is 616 and it occurs at (8, 7, 5, 10).
61.
Minimum z=17 at (4.4, 2.8)
63.
Minimum z=21 at (12, 9, 0)
Using EXCEL
1.
Maximum z=308 at (14, 30, 0)
3.
Maximum z=13 at (1, 2.5)
Section 4.5
1.
The –20 in the last column with nonnegative entries in the rest of the ﬁrst row indicates no feasible solution.
3.
There is an unbounded feasible region, so no solution, because all entries in column 4 are negative.
5.
Maximum of 210 at (5, 9) and (10, 4) and points between.
7.
Maximum=40 at (5, 5, 2.5), 
and
points between.
9.
Unbounded feasible region because all entries in column 1 become negative after a pivot.
11.
Unbounded feasible region because all entries in column 2 become negative after a pivot.
13.
Pivoting leads
to a row with a negative entry in the last column and all other entries in the row are not negative. Thus, there is no
feasible solution.
15.
Pivoting leads to a row with a negative entry in the last column and all other entries in the
row are not negative. Thus, there is no feasible solution.
17.
Unbounded feasible region because all entries in
column 1 become negative after a pivot.
19.
Pivoting leads to a row with a negative entry in the last column and all
other entries in the row are not negative. Thus, there is no feasible solution.
21.
Pivoting leads to a row with a
negative entry in the last column and all other entries in the row are not negative. Thus, there is no feasible solution.
23.
Pivoting leads to a row with a negative entry in the last column and all other entries in the row are not negative.
Thus, there is no feasible solution.
25.
Multiple solutions, minimum z=51 at 
and (24, 0, 3) and points
between.
27.
Unbounded feasible region because all entries in column 1 become negative after a pivot.
29.
Pivoting leads to a row with a negative entry in the last column and all other entries in the row are not negative.
Thus, there is no feasible solution.
31.
Column 3 contains all negative entries that indicate an unbounded feasible
region, so there is no maximum expected return.
33.
In row 3 the last entry is negative and all other entries are
nonnegative. This indicates no feasible solution.

This represents the present value of a $1 periodic payment for x time periods at 1.5% per period.
As x approaches 250, the value of y tends to level off and approaches 65. If x continues beyond 250, the value of 
y will approach, but never exceed, 66.67. Thus an investment of $66.67 at 1.5% per payment period will provide $1 per
period forever.

(a) Welsh was at the 71st percentile.
(b) The rank of Peruvian was 65.
41.
For the score of 86, z=1.75; for the score of 82, z=1.67, so the score of 86 is better.
43. The z-score for the
runner was 1; the z-score for the cyclist was 1.67. The runner’s time was one z-score higher (slower) than the mean, and
the cyclist’s time was 1.67 z-scores above the mean (slower). So, the runner had the better performance.

(a) About 89%
(b) About
56%
(c) About 84%
65. (a) 23 of the 24, about 96%, fall in the
interval. This is consistent because it is more than 75%.
(b) 22 of
the 24, about 92%, fall in the interval. This is consistent because it is
more than 56%.
67.
16 scores, 67%, fall in the 449–1029 interval. This is right at the 68% of the Empirical Rule, so
this suggests the data might be bell shaped.

No, the mean
should be at the midpoint of a normal distribution.
139.
Yes, the mean and median are approximately equal and
near the midpoint.
141.
As a whole, the curve does not have the symmetry needed for a normal distribution. The
portion obtained by deleting the 7 rightmost bars is somewhat normal in shape, so the data in that region might be
considered approximately normal.

percentile=82.
(b) s=17.37
(c) The interval 69.91 —s (52.54, 87.28) contains 72% of the scores, which is fairly
consistent with 68% in a normal distribution. The interval 69.91 —2s (35.17, 104.65) contains 94% of the scores, which is
consistent with 95.4% in a normal distribution. The interval 69.91 —3s (17.8, 122.02) contains 98.9% of the scores,
which is consistent with 99.7% in a normal distribution.
