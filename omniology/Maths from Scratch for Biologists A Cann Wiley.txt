This book arose from my own need for a text that I would be happy to
recommend to my students. Although there is no particular shortage of
volumes claiming to help biologists with mathematics, all those I am
familiar with have one of two flaws. Either they are written by well-
meaning mathematicians and pay scant attention to biology, or they are
not appropriate for the level at which most of the problems lie - new
college students who do not have much confidence in approaching math-
ematical problems, in spite of extensive prior exposure to mathematics in
school.
I make no claim to be a mathematical genius. Indeed, I believe my
struggle to explain the material in an easily accessible form is one of the
strengths of this book, bringing me closer to the students I am trying to
communicate with. I reject any charges of 'dumbing down' - anyone
who has ever tried to help a panic-stricken student in the grip of maths
phobia will know that a calming but not patronizing voice is an essential
attribute in these circumstances. Throughout, my intention is to provide
a highly accessible text for students who, with or without formal mathe-
matics qualifications, are frightened by the perceived 'difficulty' of
mathematics and unwilling, inept or inexperienced in applying mathe-
matical skills. To accommodate these students, many of whom opt to
undertake studies in biology in the belief (conscious or unconscious) that
this is a way of pursuing a scientific career while avoiding mathematics,
the ethos of the book is consciously informal and intended to be
confidence-building.
The maths in this volume has been checked vigorously, but I cannot
guarantee that the text is entirely free of numerical errors. In addition

Maths in Biology
Mathematics, from the Greek, manthano, 'to learn'
Some people opt to undertake studies in biology in the belief (conscious or
unconscious) that this is a way of pursuing a scientific career while avoid-
ing maths. This book is designed to be accessible to students who, with or
without formal mathematical qualifications, are frightened by the per-
ceived 'difficulty' of maths and hence are unwilling to apply what math-
ematical skills they might have. Have you ever noticed when you have
been taught how to solve a mathematical problem, that you still don't
know why you need to do a particular step? This is the root of many
problems with maths, so this book will try explain the why of maths, in
addition to the how. Sometimes, these explanations may seem unneces-
sary, but I urge you not to skip them - understanding why you need to do
something is the key to remembering how to do it. The intention is to be
informal and confidence-building to ensure that all readers will gain a
general appreciation of basic mathematical, statistical and data handling
techniques appropriate to biology. I will try to explain the jargon which
confuses the non-numerically minded.
In subsequent chapters, we will look at manipulating numbers, units
and conversions, molarities and dilutions, areas and volumes, exponents
and logs and statistics. However, the basic advice in this chapter is really
the most important part of the book, so please keep reading.
1.1. What can go wrong?
It is easy to make mistakes with maths. One answer looks much like
another, so how can you tell if it is right or not? Look at some examples

L 
MATHS IN BIOLOGY
of the sort of mistakes it is all too easy to make. Everyone knows that
numbers are meaningless without the units which define what they mean
(more of this in Chapter 3). Even if we avoid the elementary mistake of
forgetting this and giving an answer of '33.6' (33.6 what? volts? metres?
frogs?), things are not always simple. Consider the following questions:
An aquarium has internal dimensions of 100* 45* 45 cm. What is its
volume in litres?
This is fairly simple. Calculate the volume in cubic centimetres then con-
vert to litres. 1 litre = 1000cm3 so divide by 1000:
100 * 45 * 45 = 202500cm3 -=- 1000 = 202.5 litres
However, life is not always that simple. If the same calculation is given
in a different way, it is not as easy to answer:
An aquarium has internal dimensions of 39*18*18 inches. What is its
volume in litres?
This is harder because the units in which the data is given and those in
which the answer is required are from different systems of measurement.
In real life, this happens all too frequently.
To avoid mistakes we need to convert the units so that they are con-
sistent throughout. However, this means there are two ways to do the
calculation:
1. Convert inches to centimetres (1 inch = 2.54 cm), then perform the
calculation as above,
(39 * 2.54) * (18 * 2.54) * (18 * 2.54)
= 99.06 * 45.72 * 45.72
= 207066.94cm3 
1000 = 207.067 litres

WHAT CAN GO WRONG? 
J
2. Calculate the volume in cubic inches, then convert to litres (1 cubic
inch = 0.0164 litres, so conversion factor = 0.0164):
39 * 18 * 18 = 12636 * 0.0164 = 207.23 litres
In general, the best method is the one which requires fewer conversions
and fewer steps (b). However, this depends on what conversion factors
you have to hand - if you have to calculate a conversion factor from cubic
inches to litres, it may be better to use (a). Note that the accuracy of
conversions from one unit to another depends on the number of signifi-
cant figures used. Significant figures are: 'the minimum number of digits
needed to write a given value (in scientific notation) without loss of ac-
curacy'. The most significant figure is the left-most digit, the digit which is
known most precisely. The least significant figure is the right-most digit,
the digit which is known least precisely.
Significant figures are important when reporting scientific data because
they give the reader an idea of how accurately data has been measured.
Here are the rules:
1. All non-zero numbers (1,2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) are always significant, e.g.
12 345 has five significant figures; 1.2345 also has five significant figures.
2. All zeroes between non-zero numbers are always significant, e.g. 10 002
has five significant figures; 1.0002 also has five significant figures.
3. All zeroes which are to the right of the decimal point and at the end of
the number are always significant. This rule sometimes confuses people
since they cannot understand why. The reason is because these zeros
determine the accuracy to which the number has been calculated, e.g.
1.2001 has five significant figures; 12000 has two significant figures;
1.0200 has five significant figures (here the 'placeholder' zero to the
right of the decimal point is significant because it is between non-zero
numbers).
4. All other zeroes are not significant numbers, e.g. 1 000 000 has one
significant figure (the zeros are just 'placeholders'); 1000 000.00 has
three significant figures (the 1 and the two zeros at the end of the
number); 0.0200 has three significant figures (the 'placeholder' zero to
the right of the decimal point is not significant since it is not between
non-zero numbers); 1000 000.01 has nine significant figures (zeros
between non-zero numbers).

MATHS IN BIOLOGY
Using the appropriate number of significant figures in calculations is
important, since it prevents loss of accuracy. However, computers and
calculators frequently give ridiculously large numbers of significant
figures - way beyond the accuracy with which a measurement could be
made. For this reason, and for ease of performing calculations (particu-
larly when estimating, see below), it is often necessary to 'round off
the number of significant figures in a number. Note that this is 'rounding
off, not 'rounding up', which leads to inaccuracy and errors. 'Rounding
up' a digit which is followed by a 5 (e.g. 5.45 becomes 5.5) introduces
errors in calculations because the digits one, two, three and four are
'rounded down' (four possibilities) but the digits five, six, seven, eight
and nine are all 'rounded up' (five possibilities). 'Rounding off avoids
this error:
1. If the digit following the figure that is to be the last digit is less than 5,
drop it and all the figures to the right of it.
2. If the digit following the figure that is to be the last digit is more than 5,
increase by 1 the digit to be rounded, i.e. the preceding figure.
3. If the digit following the figure that is to be the last digit is 5, round the
preceding figure so that it is even.
Examples
Round 123.456789 to three significant figures = 123 (rule a: round the
number off)
Round 123.456789 to five significant figures = 123.46 (rule b: round
the last digit up)
Round 123.456789 to four significant figures = 123.4 (rule c: make the
last digit even)
Round 123.356789 to four significant figures = 123.4 (rule c: make the
last digit even)
Round 123.456799 to eight significant figures = 123.45680 (note that 9
rounds up to 10, not down to 0).

ESTIMATING
1.2. Estimating
Calculators and computers spit out numbers at the press of a key, but are
the answers right? Estimating is a vital skill if you wish to become con-
fident and proficient with numbers. However, estimating and calculating
are not the same thing and it is important to understand the difference.
Where calculation attempts to produce the most accurate answer possible
(within limits of experimental error), estimation deliberately avoids accu-
racy in order to simplify working out the answer.
1. If the question is 6*5 and your calculated answer is 4, could this
possibly be correct? Could the answer be less than the numbers
multiplied together?
2. If you are asked to solve an equation for x (Chapter 2) and your
answer is 7x, something is wrong.
3. When you calculate the answer to 6.42213 -f 2.36199 to six significant
figures (2.71895), make an estimate to one or two significant figures
to check: 6 -=- 2 = 3, so 2.71895 looks right, whereas 27.1895 looks
wrong.
If you have used a computer or calculator to calculate an answer, it is best
to work out the estimate in your head or on a scrap of paper in order to
check for any errors you may have introduced by using the machine. This
is why estimation involves simplifying the calculation - an estimate is not
meant to be accurate, but it should be easy to calculate and a reliable
check. Aside from performing the calculation, estimating is the most im-
portant part of ensuring that answers to problems are correct. Some cal-
culations in biology are complex and involve many steps (Chapter 5).
Estimating is particularly important here to ensure the answer looks sen-
sible. Manipulation of numbers and equations may not give a numerical
answer but a mathematical term (e.g. 3y — 2). Here, the trick is to check

MATHS IN BIOLOGY
your answer by substituting back into the original equation to see if it
works (Chapter 2).
1.3. How to use this book
If you have been told to use this book as part of a particular course, you
had better follow the instructions given by whoever is running the course.
Other than that, you can use this book however you want. Some people
may want to read though all (or most) of the chapters in order. Others
may skip sections and dip into chapters that they feel they need. Either
way is fine, as long as you can solve problems consistently and accurately
and, most importantly, that you gain the knowledge and confidence to
start to try to work out possible answers.
1.4. Mathematical conventions used
in this book
To make them easier to read, numbers with more than four digits are split
into groups of three digits separated by spaces (not commas), e.g.
9 999 999 is nine million, nine hundred and ninety nine thousand, nine
hundred and ninety nine. I have also chosen to use the asterisk (*) as a
multiplication sign rather than ' x ' or a dot, since these are sometimes
confusing when written.

Manipulating Numbers
Algebra (from the Arabic, al-jabr, 'the reduction') - a form of maths
where symbols are used to represent numbers
LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
On completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• understand the basic rules of algebra;
• perform simple algebraic manipulations;
• identify and manipulate fractions.
Arithmetic is concerned with the effect of operations (e.g. addition, multi-
plication, etc.) on specified numbers. In algebra, operations are applied to
variables rather than specific numbers. Why? Here is a classic example:
John is 10 years old. His father is 35 years old. After how many years
will the father be twice as old as the son?
You could try to find the answer by experimenting with different num-
bers, but this is laborious. The better way is to treat this an algebra prob-
lem and write the problem as an equation which we can then solve.
Let the father be twice as old as the son in x years time. The son will
then be (10 + x) years old and the father will be (35 + x) year old:
2(10 +x) = 35+x

8 
MANIPULATING NUMBERS
Therefore,
20 + 2x = 35 + x
Simplify this by subtracting x from each side to keep the equation balanced:
Simplify by subtracting 20 from each side to keep the equation balanced:
x = 15 years (son is 25 and father is 50)
2.1. Manipulating numbers
To manipulate numbers, you need to know the rules. In mathematics, this
is known as the 'Order of Operations' - an internationally agreed set of
arbitrary rules which allows mathematicians the world over to arrive at
the same answers to problems:
In algebra, there are two sorts of statement which you need to be able to
recognize:
1. A mathematical expression is a string of symbols which describes
('expresses') a (potential) calculation using operators (symbols indicat-
ing an operation to be performed, e.g. plus, minus, divide, etc.) and
operands (symbols which the operators act on), e.g.
Expressions do not contain an equal sign, but can often be simplified,
that is converted to a simpler form containing fewer terms.

SOLVING EQUATIONS
2. A mathematical equation contains an equal sign. The terms (groups
of numbers or symbols) on both sides of the equal sign are equivalent,
2x = y
You can do anything you want to an equation, as long as you treat
both sides equally. To solve an equation, you must find the values(s) of
the variable(s) which make the equation true, that is both terms equal.
A mathematical formula also represents a relationship between two
or more variables (symbols or terms whose values may vary) and/or
constants (numbers or terms whose value is fixed), e.g.
e = me
A formula is simply an equation which expresses a rule or principle as
symbols, i.e. the recipe which allow you to calculate the value of the
terms.
2.2. Solving equations
To 'solve' an equation, you must find the value(s) of the variable(s) which
make the equation 'true', i.e. makes the terms on either side of the equal
sign equal. There are seven steps to follow in order to solve an equation
('BICORS'):
1. Brackets - if an equation contains brackets ('B'; also known as
parentheses, which group symbols together), solve these first. Multiply-
each item inside the bracket by the symbol just outside the bracket.
2. Isolate - move all the terms containing a variable to the same side of
the equal sign ('isolate' the variable; T).
3. Combine - combine like terms, that is if an equation contains more
than one term containing the same variable (e.g. z), combine them
CO).
4. Opposite - for each operator in an equation, perform the opposite
process ('O'), for example, if the equation contains a minus sign, add,
or if it contains a multiplication sign, divide.

10 
MANIPULATING NUMBERS
5. Reduce - reduce ('R') fractions to their lowest terms (e.g. 33/11 =
6. Substitute - finally, always check your answer by putting this value
back into the original equation ('substitute' for the variable; 'S').
You will not always have to perform all of these steps, depending on the
equation. For example, if an equation does not contain any brackets, just
move on to the next step, but do go through all the steps in order. Solving
equations often involves simplifying the expressions they contain, which
means getting all similar terms (e.g. x) on the same side of the equal sign.
All of this sounds more complicated than it actually is and is best illustrated
by some examples.
Examples
Solve for x (i.e. find the value of x that makes the equation true):
4x = 2(6x) - 4
Expand Brackets (Bicors):
4x= l2x–4
Simplify to Isolate (bIcors) the variable:
4x - \2x = -4
Combine (biCors) like terms:
-8* = -4
Carry out the Opposite (bicOrs) process:
8x = 4
Divide by the coefficient of the variable (variable = x, coefficient = 8):
8x/8 = 4/8
Simplify the equation by Reducing (bicoRs) fractions to their lowest terms:
x= 1/2

SOLVING EQUATIONS 
1 1
Check the answer by Substituting (bicorS) it back into the original
equation:
4(1/2) = 2[6(1/2)] - 4
2 = 2(3) - 4
2 = 6-4
Solve for x (find the value of x):
B (*5): 
5x - 20 = 20
(I,C)O ( + 20): 
5x = 40
O(R) (/5): 
x 
= 40/5 = 8
S: 
5(8-4) = 20
5(4) = 20
20 = 20
Solve for z (find the value of z):
(B,I,C)O (- 4): 
z/4 
= 12
O(R) (*4): 
z = 48
S: 
48/4 + 4 = 16
12 + 4 = 16
16 = 16
Note that equations do not always have a numerical answer - some-
times the value of the variable can only be expressed in terms of its re-
lationship with another variable:
Solve for x (find the true value of x):
2x + 4 = 2y + 4
(B,I,C)O (- 4):
x = y
2y + 4 = 2y + 4
2y = 2y

12 
MANIPULATING NUMBERS
Solve for t (find the true value of t):
-5): 
t = x-5
(R)S: 
x-5 + 5 = x
x = x
There are two main sorts of equation:
1. Linear equations - equations where the exponents of all the variables
(powers of the variable, see Chapter 6) are equal to 1 and there is no
multiplication between variables. Graphs of linear equations plot as
straight lines, e.g. y = 2x + 3.
2. Non-linear equations - equations where the exponent (power, see
Chapter 6) of one or more of the variables is not equal to 1 or there is
any multiplication between variables. Graphs of non-linear equations
plot as curves. This includes all polynomial functions [e.g. f(x) =
4x3 + 3x2 + 2x + 1], such as:
• quadratic equations, e.g. x2 + 5x + 6 = 0;
• cubic equations, e.g. x3 + bx2 + cx + d — 0, etc.
Although non-linear equations are common in biology, this chapter is
primarily concerned with linear equations. Many people find the idea of
solving equations difficult. The answer to this is to practise. For this, you
can use the problems at the end of this chapter. When you become more
confident, you can move on to non-linear equations. Word problems
are particularly useful to help you think through what you are being
asked, but can be surprisingly difficult for some people. In real life, in-
formation is frequently presented in this form rather than as an equation.
The trick is to start by converting words into numbers. Again, this is a
skill that you can acquire by practice - use the problems at the end of this
chapter.
2.3. Why do you need to know all this?
You need to know all this because you cannot go very far in biology
without encountering topics like enzyme kinetics.

WHY DO YOU NEED TO KNOW ALL THIS? 
13
Example
In an enzyme-catalysed reaction, the reactant (S) combines reversibly with
a catalyst (E) to form a complex (ES) with forward and reverse rate con-
stants of k1 and k-1, respectively. The complex then dissociates into pro-
duct (P) with a reaction rate constant of k2 and the catalyst is regenerated:
k-1
From this can be derived the Michaelis-Menten equation:
VW^MS]
v 
i rci
Am ~r [oj
where v = reaction rate (velocity), [S] = substrate concentration, Vmax =
maximum rate, Km = Michaelis-Menten constant = substrate concentra-
tion at half the maximal velocity (V), i.e. Km = [S] when V= Vmax/2.
Km measures enzyme/substrate affinity - a low Km indicates a strong
enzyme - substrate affinity and vice versa. However, Km is not just a
binding constant that measures the strength of binding between the en-
zyme and substrate. Its value includes the affinity of substrate for enzyme,
but also the rate at which the substrate bound to the enzyme is converted
to product (see Table 2.1).
For ribonuclease, if [S] = Km = 7.9 * 10-3 M, then substituting into the
Michaelis-Menten equation:
Vmax * 7.9 * 
1(T3
7.9* 10-3+7.9*10-3

2.4. Fractions
When you perform algebraic manipulations, you soon encounter frac-
tions, which means parts of numbers. We all learned to manipulate frac-
tions in school, but in these days of computers and calculators, many
people have forgotten how to do this. Remembering how to multiply
and divide fractions causes particular problems.
All fractions have three components - a numerator, a denominator and
a division symbol:
Numerator
Denominator
The division symbol in a simple fraction indicates that the entire expres-
sion above the division symbol is the numerator and must be treated as
if it were one number, and the entire expression below the division symbol
is the denominator and must be treated as if it were one number. The
same order of operations (BEDMAS) applies to fractions as to other
mathematical terms. Brackets instruct you to simplify the expression with-
in the bracket before doing anything else. The division symbol in a frac-
tion has the same role as a bracket. It instructs you to treat the quantity
above (the numerator) as if it were enclosed in a bracket, and to treat
the quantity below (the denominator) as if it were enclosed in another
bracket:
(Numerator)
(Denominator)

THE NUMBER 1 
15
In a simple fraction, the numerator and the denominator are both integers
(whole numbers), e.g.
I
2
A complex fraction is a fraction where the numerator, denominator or
both contain a fraction, e.g.
1/2
To manipulate (e.g. add, subtract, divide or multiply) complex fractions,
you must first convert them to simple fractions.
A compound fraction, also called a mixed number, contains integers
and fractions, e.g.
4 - 1/2
3
As with complex fractions, to manipulate compound fractions, you must
first convert them to simple fractions.
No fraction (simple, complex or compound) can have a denominator
with an overall value of zero. This is because, if the denominator of a
fraction is zero, the overall value of the fraction is not defined, since you
cannot divide by zero. A numerator is allowed to take on the value of zero
in a fraction, although any legitimate fraction (denominator not equal to
zero) with a numerator equal to zero has an overall value of zero. If there
is a single minus sign in a simple fraction, the overall value of the fraction
will be negative. If there is an even number of minus signs in a simple
fraction, the value of the fraction is positive. If there is an odd number of
minus signs in a simple fraction, the value of the fraction is negative, e.g.

2.5. The number 1
Although it may seem obvious, the number 1 has several properties which
can easily be overlooked. This becomes important when working with
fractions:

16 
MANIPULATING NUMBERS
1. Multiplying any number by 1 does not change the value of the num-
ber. Dividing any number by 1 does not change the value of the
number.
2. The number 1 can take many forms, e.g. 4 — 3 = 1 or 10 — 9 = 1. These
can be substituted for 1 because they have the same value.
3. When the numerator of a fraction is equivalent to the denominator of a
fraction, the value of the fraction is 1. This only works for legitimate
fractions, i.e. where the denominator does not equal zero. You can
substitute such a fraction with the number 1.
4. You can express any integer as a fraction by dividing by 1, or by
choosing a numerator and denominator so that the overall value is
equal to the integer.
5. To factor an integer, break the integer down into a group of numbers
whose product equals the original number. Factors are separated by
multiplication signs. Note that the number 1 is the factor of every
number. All factors of a number can be divided exactly into that
number.
2.6. Lowest common multiple and
greatest common factor
When manipulating fractions you frequently need to find these two terms -
you will see examples of this below. To find the lowest common multi-
ple (LCM) of two numbers, make a table of multiples (e.g. 2 and 3; see
Table 2.2). To find the greatest common factor (GCF), meaning numbers
or expressions by which a larger number can be divided exactly ('factor-
ing'), make a table of factors (e.g. 8 and 12; see Table 2.3).

2.7. Adding and subtracting fractions
To be able to add or subtract fractions to or from fractions, the denomi-
nators must be the same ('common'): i +1 cannot be added, but § + f can.
JL 
o 
o 
o
To find a common denominator so you can add or subtract fractions,
find the LCM of all the denominators involved. Then, make the denomi-
nators equal the LCM by multiplying both the denominator and numera-
tor by the corresponding factor of the LCM. Whenever you manipulate
fractions, the final step is to reduce the answer to the lowest terms:
1. Factor the numerator.
2. Factor the denominator.
3. Find the fraction mix that equals 1.
Example
Add
I +1 
The LCM of 3 and 5 (the denominators) is 15.
and 5 by 3. Now both denominators are the same ('common').
-f ~ 
Both denominators must equal the LCM, so multiply 3 by 5,
T^ + if To avoid altering the problem, multiply the numerators by the
same factor as their respective denominators. This is the same
as multiplying each fraction by 15/15, i.e. by 1.
f§ + jl 
Now the denominators the same, add the fractions together.
|| 
You cannot reduce this fraction further, i.e. reduce numerator
and denominator to their LCFs, so this is the final answer.

18 
MANIPULATING NUMBERS
To build a fraction is the reverse of reducing the fraction. Instead of
searching for one in a fraction and reducing, insert a 1 (or equivalent) and
'build' the fraction:
2
2 
2
4
8
— = — * i = — * — = —
2 3 
3 4 1 2
You might do this to find a common denominator so that you can add or
subtract fractions.
2.8. Multiplying fractions
1. To multiply fractions, multiply the numerator(s) by the numerator(s)
and the denominator(s) by the denominator(s).
2. Do not cross-multiply [i.e. do not multiply the numerator(s) by the
denominator( s)].
3. After finding the product of the fractions, reduce the product to its
simplest form.
4. You can multiply more than one fraction in a single step - simply
multiply all the numerators, then all the denominators and then reduce
the result to the lowest common terms.
5. To multiply a whole number and a fraction, convert the whole number
to a fraction, multiply the numerators, multiply the denominators and
reduce the results.
Example
3 6 _ 18 _ 18/2 _ 9
4 * 7 ~ 28 ~ 28/2 ~ 14
2.9. Dividing fractions
'Cross-multiplication' is involved in dividing fractions (i.e. multiplying
the numerator by the denominator). If you wish, you can do this by taking
the reciprocal of the second fraction (i.e. flip the numerator and the

FRACTIONS, DECIMALS AND PERCENTAGES 
17
denominator) and multiplying numerator with numerator and denomina-
tor with denominator.
You cannot divide more than one fraction in a single step. If multiple
fractions are involved, break the problem down in separate parts.
To divide a fraction by a whole number, or a whole number by a frac-
tion, first convert the whole number to a fraction.
Example
_6__6/a_6 3 _ 1 8 _ 9
2 7 3 ~ 2 7 3 ~ T * 2 ~ T ~ T ~
2.10. Fractions, decimals and percentages
It is easy to convert a fraction to a decimal - just type the fraction into a
calculator, divide the numerator by the denominator and read the result as
a decimal. Example:
60/150(= 6/15 = 2/5) -0.4
However, it is not always easy to use this method to calculate the exact
value of fractions, for example try using your calculator to find the exact
value of 22/7. It is not possible to use a calculator to convert a decimal
into a fraction, so this is done by dividing the fraction by 1, then multi-
plying the result by 1 in a form that will remove the decimal.
Example
_33_3.3 10_33
' ~T~T*To~To
Most people are able to calculate percentages properly, but as mistakes
are sometimes made, it is perhaps worth covering this briefly. 'Per cent'
means 'for each 100', e.g. 25% means 25 out of 100. To calculate a
percentage you need to know the number in the entire (total) group and
the number in the part of the group you are interested in ('subgroup').
% = subgroup
total

The mistake which is sometimes made is to divide the number in the
subgroup by the remainder rather than by the total. To convert a percen-
tage to a fraction, place the number over a denominator of 100, then
reduce to lowest terms.
Example
The conversions in Table 2.4 are very common and should probably be
memorized.
2.11. Ratios and proportions
Like percentages, ratios (pronounced 'ray-sho' or 'ray-she-oh', from the
Latin for 'calculation') are often to used make comparisons between si-
milar things, that is things measured in the same units. Ratios tell you how
one item is related to another and can be written in several different ways,
for example, in a population consisting of seven white mice and nine
brown mice, the ratio of white to brown animals can be written as:
1. A fraction - 7/9.
2. In words, using 'to' - seven white mice to nine brown mice.
3. With a colon - 7:9.

RATIOS AND PROPORTIONS 
2.1
As with fractions, for clarity ratios should always be reduced to their
lowest terms. For example, the ratio 24:48 is equal to 12:24, etc., i.e. 1:2.
A ratio can express the relationship between more than two items, for
example, in a cake recipe containing three spoons of treacle, four spoons
of sugar and nine spoons of flour, the ratio of treacle to sugar to flour is
3:4:9. Note that the numbers in this ratio do not tell you how big the cake
is going to be, just the relative amounts of ingredients.
To tell if two ratios are equal, use a calculator and divide. If division
gives the same answer (called the 'quotient' - the number obtained by
dividing one number by another) for both ratios, then they are equal. A
quotient is therefore a single number, whereas a ratio is a pair of numbers
used to make a comparison. A proportion is a statement of equality be-
tween two ratios, e.g.
1/2 = 3/6
When one of the four numbers in a proportion is unknown, cross-
multiplication may be used to find the unknown number ('solve the
proportion').
Example
Solve for x:
By cross-multiplying (as when dividing fractions, Section 2.9):
so
Dividing both sides by 2,
x = 4 / 2 = 2
A common difficulty with ratios is knowing which way round to write
them. This depends on what question is being asked, for example, in our

22 
MANIPULATING NUMBERS
group of seven white mice and nine brown mice, the proportion of brown
mice is 7:9 and the proportion of white mice is 9:7. The convention is to
write the group which is being referred to first, so the molar ratio of
hydrogen to oxygen in water (H2O) is 2:1 and the molar ratio of oxygen
to hydrogen in water is 1:2. Ratios crop up in everyday calculations all the
time and are common in biology, but perhaps are most frequently encoun-
tered in calculations involving molarities and dilutions (Chapter 4). You
can use the problems at the end of this chapter to practise calculations
involving ratios.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
On completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• describe the seven principal SI units;
• understand how other SI units are derived from the principal units;
• be able to apply SI units in calculations.
Measurement is fundamental to science. Observations or calculations
without accompanying units of measurement are meaningless. In the
course of history many different systems of measurement have arisen.
While it is possible to convert between different measurements, this is
inconvenient and results in inaccuracies, and frequently mistakes. Conse-
quently, it was recognized that there was a need for a universal system of
measurement.
3.1. The SI system of units
The metric system was invented by the French Academy of Science in
1799 as a 'rational' system of measurement - part of the 'Age of Enligh-
tenment' which followed the French Revolution. Originally, it consisted
of three units and was known as the 'MKS' system:
1. The metre - 1/10000000 the distance between the pole and the
equator.

UNITS AND CONVERSIONS
2. The kilogram - the mass of a standard platinum cylinder kept at the
International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris.
3. The second - l/(24 * 60 * 60) of a day.
This was gradually extended and rationalized and in 1960, the so-called SI
system ('Systeme International d'Unites') was adopted internationally.
Other systems of measurement persist to some extent, notably the 'foot,
pound, second' (FPS) system, also known in the United States as the
English Engineering System (EES), but the SI system is now the indispu-
table language of science.
A dimension is an abstract quality of measurement without scale (e.g.
length, mass, time, etc.). A unit is a number which specifies a previously
agreed scale (e.g. metres, kilograms, seconds). In the SI system, there are
seven fundamental dimensions, measured by seven principal units, as
shown in Table 3.1. Many other measurements are derived by combining
the seven principal units, as shown in Table 3.2.

The litre (L, the volume of 1 kilogram of pure water at 4°C and a pressure
of 760 mm of mercury) is a metric unit but not an SI unit, since all SI units
are derived from the principal units, hence the SI unit of volume is the m3.
Other commonly used abbreviations include h (hour, but not H, Hr or hr)
and g (gram - do not confuse with g, the acceleration due to gravity).
3.2. SI prefixes
One of the most frequent criticisms of SI units is that many are either too
large or too small for convenient use. In some cases this may be true. For
this reason, SI (and metric) units can be made larger or smaller by the use
of appropriate prefixes (Table 3.3). Some of these will already be familiar,
such as the kilometre and the millilitre, others less so. Other than the 101,
102, 103 and l0 – 1l – 2,10 – 3 prefixes, which represent 10-fold changes,
all the other SI prefixes involve 1000-fold increases or decreases in scale -
an adjustment of three decimal places. This makes it much easier to
remember the absolute magnitude of the largest and smallest SI prefixes,
e.g. giga = 109, femto = 10–15 , etc.
The main advantage of the interlocking SI units is that they make it easy
to convert from one scale to another, e.g. for a cube with sides of length x:

If x = 1 m, the volume of the cube = 1*1*1 = 1 m3. Since 1 m =
100cm, the volume of the cube in centimetres = 100cm* 100cm*
100cm = 1 * 106cm3. Since 1 m = 1 * 106 um, the volume of the cube
inum = l*106*l*106*l*106 = l*1018um3. Therefore, 1cm3 = l*
1012um3, etc. Note that 1 m = 100cm, but 1 m3 does not equal 100cm3.
You need to become familiar and comfortable with this sort of SI unit
conversion - use the problems at the end of this chapter to practice. It is
quite easy to get confused when performing this sort of calculation. One
way to avoid this is to work completely in SI units, e.g. metres rather than
millimetres, kilograms rather than grams, etc. Calculations involving the
fundamental SI units often lead to very small or very big numbers, so you
need to be comfortable with using scientific notation, as described in
Chapter 6. You also need to be aware that you may need to convert your
answer back into the units asked for or customarily used, e.g. millilitres
rather than litres, or minutes instead of seconds.

3.3. SI usage
The SI system is precise not only about the units themselves, but also as to
how they are written. There is a good reason for this, to avoid ambiguity,
but unfortunately many people either ignore or are ignorant of these
rules.
1. Many SI units are eponymous, i.e. named after famous people who
were prominent in early work done within the field in which the unit is
used. A unit which is named after a person is written in lower case
(newton, volt, pascal etc.) when written in full, but should start with a
capital letter (N, V, Pa, etc.) when abbreviated.
2. Units written in abbreviated form are never pluralized. This is because
'kms' does not mean 'kilometres', but 'km*s'.
3. Unit abbreviations (such as J, N, g, Pa) are never followed by a full-
stop unless at the end of a sentence.
4. The unit or abbreviation (plus prefix if present) should be separated
from the number to which it refers by a space.
5. Prefixes are not separated from the unit to which they refer by spaces.
6. When units are combined they are separated by spaces, e.g. the
acceleration due to gravity is 9.8ms – 2.
7. 
–1 is shorthand for 'per', e.g. 6mgL – 1 means 6 milligrams per litre,
and 9.8ms – 2 means 9.8 metres per second per second. Never use 'p'
for per, e.g. 'kph' should be written as kmh – 1 = kilometres per hour.
Neither should you use a slash '/' to mean per, since this could be
misinterpreted as a division symbol.
8. Any unit may take only one prefix. For example, 'millimillimetre'
should be written as 'micrometre' (urn).

them. As such, it is fundamental to life, and plays a major role in areas

such as biomaterials and bioengineering, imaging, bioelectronics and
nanobiology. However, in this book it is only appropriate to provide a
brief explanation of basic physical principles.
Energy is the capacity of a system for work (the transfer of energy from
one system to another) or power (the rate at which work is done, i.e. the
amount of work per unit time). Force is an action which maintains or
alters the position of a body, or distorts it (Table 3.4). Because force has
both magnitude and direction, it is a vector quantity (not simply scalar,
like mass, which has no direction). The mass of an object is a measure of
an object's resistance to changes in either the speed or direction. Weight
and mass are not the same thing. The weight of an object is the force
it exerts under a given gravitational force. Thus the weight of an astro-
naut is different on the moon than on the Earth, but the mass is constant.
Weight is therefore properly measured in newtons and mass in kilograms.
However, we usually write about 'a weight of so-many kg'. This is not so
much an error, but a shorthand. What is being referred to is the force
with which the earth attracts a body. The phrase '10kg weight' refers
to an object on which the earth's gravity exerts a force of
10kg*9.8ms–2 = 98N. In practice, we refer to weight in kilograms,
which assumes that the measurement is made under the acceleration
due to gravity at sea level.

MEASURING ENERGY 
3 1
There are five main forms of energy:
1. Mechanical energy is associated with motion. Energy stored in an object
due to its position is called potential energy. Gravitational potential
energy is dependent on an object's height above the surface of the Earth.
Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because of its motion.
2. Heat is caused by the motion of the particles which make up matter.
When particles collide or when surfaces are rubbed together,
mechanical energy is converted into heat. This is known as friction
(a force which resists the relative motion or tendency to relative motion
of two bodies in contact).
3. Electromagnetic energy is the energy given off by moving electric
charges. Examples include light and other forms of electromagnetic
radiation, such as radiowaves and microwaves.
4. Chemical energy is the energy released or absorbed when bonds
between atoms are formed or broken. An example of this is the stored
chemical energy in the fuel which powers an engine. When the fuel is
burned, stored chemical energy is converted to heat and mechanical
energy, which in turn is converted to motion. Photosynthetic organ-
isms such as green plants and some bacteria convert the electro-
magnetic energy of light into stored chemical energy by combining
carbon dioxide with water to produce carbohydrates. All other
organisms (and photosynthetic organisms in the dark) utilize this
stored energy to provide the power for life.
5. Nuclear energy is the energy stored in the nuclei of atoms. When the
nucleus of an atom splits (fission), or when nuclei collide at high speeds
and fuse together (fusion), nuclear energy is released. Nuclear energy
from the sun reaches the Earth in the form of electromagnetic radiation
and is the ultimate source of energy for all forms of life.
While it is possible to change matter into energy and energy into matter,
the sum of the two is always constant. Therefore, matter and energy are
different forms of the same thing which can be converted from one to the
other. Conversion of one form of energy to another is quite common, e.g.
potential energy changing into kinetic energy; kinetic energy changing
into potential energy; chemical energy into heat energy; heat energy into
mechanical energy; nuclear energy into heat energy; and mechanical en-
ergy into electromagnetic energy.

3.5. Temperature
The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (1/273.16 of the thermodynamic
temperature of the triple point of water). The triple point of water is the
temperature at which water exists in its three possible phases, solid, liquid
and vapour (0.01°C); OK represents absolute zero, the temperature at
which all molecular motion stops. Water freezes at a temperature of
273.16K 
( = 0.01°C) and boils at 373.16K (= 100°C). 
Note
that we do not write 'degrees kelvin' ('°K') as with °C, simply 'K'.
K = 273 + °C and °C = K - 273

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
On completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• understand the concepts of molarity and concentrations;
• be able to calculate the molarity of solutions;
• be able to calculate dilutions of solutions and suspensions.
4.1. Avogadro's number
In the last chapter, we learned that the mole (from 'molecule') is the SI
unit used to measure the amount of a substance (abbreviation — 'mol').
Technically, one mole is 'the amount of a substance which contains as
many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012kg of carbon-12'.
This is a complicated definition, but in 1811 Amedeo Avogadro was the
first person to clearly make the distinction between molecules and atoms.
Avogadro suggested that equal volumes of all gases at the same tempera-
ture and pressure contain the same number of molecules, which is now
known as Avogadro's Principle. However, it was not until long after
Avogadro's death that the idea of the mole was introduced. The molecular
weight in grams (1mol) of any substance contains the same number of
molecules. The number of molecules in 1 mol is now called Avogadro's
number. Avogadro had no knowledge of moles, or of the number that was
to bear his name, since this was never determined by Avogadro himself.

MOLARITIES AND DILUTIONS
Avogadro's number is:
602213670000000000000000 (6.02* 1023)
How big is Avogadro's number?
1. An Avogadro's number of soft drink cans would cover the entire
surface of the earth to a depth of over 200 miles.
2. If we were able to count atoms at the rate of 10 million per second, it
would take about 2 billion years to count the atoms in 1 mol.
3. An Avogadro's number of carbon-12 atoms (1 mol) weighs 12 g.
An Avogadro's number of moles of carbon-12 weighs the same as the
Earth.
4.2. Molecular weight
To have to consider the masses of individual molecules measured in grams
would be very inconvenient, since this would involve extremely small
numbers. Unfortunately, the only clearly defined unit in this area is the
SI standard, the mole, and the derived unit of concentration, molarity.
Molecular weight is the mass of 1 mol of a substance (in grams per mole).
However, the term 'molecular mass' is used by some people to mean
molecular weight (i.e. grams per mole) and by others to mean mass of a
single molecule (in daltons, Da - the mass of a molecule relative to one-
twelfth the mass of carbon-12 atom). Although numerically equal,
molecular weight/mass (in grams per mole) and mass-of-a-molecule type
molecular mass (in daltons) have different units. These problems are
avoided by using 'molecular mass' only for the mass of individual mole-
cules (in daltons) and 'molecular weight' or 'molar mass' for the mass of a
mole of molecules (grams per mole). Relative molecular mass (Mr) is an
attempt to avoid these problems by defining the apparent molecular
weight of proteins etc. with reference to a set of standards. However, if
Mr is defined as molecular mass relative to one-twelfth the mass of
carbon-12 atom ( = daltons), then Mr is really in daltons - a measure-
ment which refers to individual molecules, not moles. Mr is thus an illu-
sion since it has no properly defined units, e.g. 'Mr 53 000' (53 000
what?). Therefore, since there is no consensus in this area, in this book
the term 'molecular weight' is used to refer to any or all of these
quantities.

SOLUTIONS
4.3. Solutions
A solution is a homogeneous mixture where all the particles (the 'solute')
exist as individual molecules or ions dissolved in a liquid (the 'solvent').
The molarity of a solution is calculated by dividing the moles of solute by
the volume of the solution (in litres):
moles of solute
Molanty = - 
- — - — : —
litres of solution
You may possibly encounter another term, the molality (abbreviated as
m) of a solution. Molality is the concentration of a solute measured as
moles per kilogram of solvent, cf. molarity, which is measured as moles of
solute per litre of solvent. For example, aim 
NaCl solution contains
1 mol of NaCl per kilogram of water whereas a 1 M NaCl solution con-
tains 1 rnol of NaCl per litre of water. This is a small difference, but
molalities are preferred over molarities in experiments that involve tem-
perature changes of solutions, e.g. calorimetry and freezing point depres-
sion experiments, where the volume of the solution changes. Molality is
almost never used in biology, but you should be aware that it exists and is
distinct from molarity, and is not just a typing mistake.
Examples
1. What is the molarity of 1 L of a solution containing 2 mol of solute?

If you are still not confident about molarity calculations, an alternative
approach is to use a formula triangle:
Examples
1. What is the concentration of 2L of a solution containing 4mol of
solute?
4mol / 2 L = 2 M
2. How many moles of solute are contained in 2 L of a 0.5M solution?

3. What volume of 0.5M solution can you make with 4mol of solute?

MOLARITIES AND DILUTIONS
4.4. Spectroscopy
Spectroscopy is a useful way of experimentally determining the concen-
tration of biological molecules. Molecules in solution absorb light maxi-
mally at particular wavelengths. The absorption spectrum of a substance
can be determined by measuring the optical density of a solution of the
molecule over a range of wavelengths and finding the peak absorbance.
A = cl
where A = the light absorbance of the solution at a defined wavelength;
e = the molar extinction coefficient of the molecule, i.e. the ability of the
molecule to absorb light of a specified frequency (sometimes known as the
absorption coefficient); c = the concentration of the molecule in the solu-
tion; l = the length of the light path, i.e. how far the light travels through
the solution - the width of the spectrophotometer cell (cuvette).
If we know three of these parameters it is easy to do some simple
algebra to find the fourth, for example, if we measure the absorbance
of a solution of known concentration in a cuvette with a known width
(i.e. light path), we can calculate the extinction coefficient:
£ = A/(C 
* l)
More importantly, for a molecule with a known extinction coefficient, by
measuring the light absorbance we can determine the concentration:
This is the basis of many biological experiments, in particular enzyme
assays where the appearance or disappearance of a particular reactant can
be measured. One particularly useful aspect of this technology is that if the
absorption spectra of different molecules in solution do not overlap signifi-
cantly [e.g. enzyme, substrate and product(s)], we can accurately measure
the concentration of one molecule without interference from the others.
Example
The enzyme lactate dehydrogenase catalyses the following reaction:
Pyruvate + NADH + H+ -> lactate + NAD+
NADH [the reduced (electron-energy rich) coenzyme nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide] absorbs light with a wavelength of 340 nm with an

SPECTROSCOPY 
41
extinction coefficient of 6.22 * 103 M–1 cm –1, whereas the oxidized form
of the coenzyme, NAD, does not. By determining the rate at which
NADH disappears, you can measure the rate of the reaction as lactate
dehydrogenase converts NADH to NAD. Measuring the absorbance of
the reaction mixture at 340 nm as a function of time will allow the reac-
tion rate to be calculated. On adding the enzyme to a 3mL reaction
mixture in a cuvette with a 1 cm light path, the following measurements
were made.
initial A340: 0.78
A340 after 1 min: 0.38
Initial concentration of NADH:
c=A/(e*l)
c = 0.78/6.22 * 103 * 1 = 0.000125 M = 125 uM
125uM = 125 umol L–1
Therefore the amount of NADH:
= 0.000125 M * (3mL/1000mL)
= 3.75 * 10–7 mol = 0.375 umol
Concentration after 1 min:
c = 0.38/6.22 * 103 * 1 = 0.000061 M = 61 uM
61 uM = 61 umol L–1
Amount = 0.000061 M * (3 mL/l000mL)
= 1.8* 10–7 mol = 0.1 8
The amount of NADH used up in the reaction in 1 min is:
0.375 umol (initial amount) — 0.18 umol (amount remaining) = 0.195 umol
Some molecules do not absorb visible light efficiently but do absorb
shorter wavelengths such as ultraviolet (UV) light. The heterocyclic ring
structures in DNA and RNA absorb light with a maximum absorbance at
260 nm. This can be measured by UV spectroscopy, using quartz cuvettes
which transmit UV light. The extinction coefficient of DNA at 260 nm is
approximately 10000M–1cm–1, which means that a solution of DNA
with a concentration of 50 ug rnL–1 has an A26o of 1.0, while RNA has an

42 
MOLARITIES AND DILUTIONS
extinction coefficient at 260 nm of approximately 12 500 M–1 cm–1 and
a solution of RNA with a concentration of 40 ug mL–1 has an A260 of 1.0.
4.5. Dilutions
In the laboratory, dilutions of concentrated stock solutions are frequently
used to make solutions of any desired molarity. To 'dilute' a solution means
to add more solvent without the addition of more solute. (The resulting
solution must be thoroughly mixed to ensure homogeneity.) The fact that
the amount of solute remains constant allows calculations to be made:
moles of solute before dilution = moles of solute after dilution
From the definition of molarity (above):
moles of solute = molarity * volume
so we can substitute M * V (molarity * volume) into the above equation:
Volumes need not be converted to litres - any volume measurement is
fine, so long as the same measurement is used on each side.
Examples
1. You have 53 mL of a 1.5M solution of NaCl, but need a 0.8M
solution. How many mL of 0.8 M NaCl can you make?
M1 * V1 = M2 * V2
1.5*53 = 0.8*V2
V2 = 79.5/0.8 = 99.38 mL

DILUTIONS 
43
2. You need 225 mL of 0.6 M NaOH solution and you have a 2.5M
stock solution. How would you make up the solution?
M1, * V1 = M2 * V2
2.5 * V1 = 0.6 * 225
V1 = 135/2.5 = 54 mL
If you are still not confident about dilutions an alternative approach is to
use the ratio method to work them out:
Examples
1. Fifty millilitres of a solution are diluted to a volume of l00 mL. The
concentration of the diluted solution is 2 M. What was the concentra-
tion of the original solution?
50 mL -> l00mL = 2-fold dilution
Concentration of original solution (what you are trying to calculate) is
greater than concentration of diluted solution, so multiply by the ratio
of the volumes:
2 M * 2 = 4 M
2. What volume of a 5M solution is required to make l00mL of a 2M
solution?
5M -> 2M = 2.5-fold dilution
The volume of the original solution (what you are trying to calculate) is
less than the volume of the diluted solution, so divide by the ratio of
the concentrations:
100/2.5 = 40 mL

44 
MOLARITIES AND DILUTIONS
3. Five-hundred millilitres of a 5M solution are diluted to 2L. What is
the concentration of the resulting solution?
0.5 L -> 2 L = 4-fold dilution
The concentration of resulting solution (what you are trying to
calculate) is less than the concentration of the original solution, so
divide by the ratio of the volumes:
5M/4 = 1.25 M
4. Two-hundred millilitres of a 1M solution are diluted to make a 0.4 M
solution. What is the volume of the resulting solution?
1 M -> 0.4 M = 2.5-fold dilution
The volume of the resulting solution (what you are trying to calculate)
is greater than the volume of the original solution, so multiply by the
ratio of the volumes:
200 * 2.5 = 500 mL
Frequently, the concentrations of solutions or suspensions are quoted not
in molarities but in other terms such as weight per volume (e.g. 10gL–1
or 5 mg mL–1), or as percentages. Weight percentage ('w/w' – the weight
of solute multiplied by 100 divided by the weight of the solution) and
weight-volume percentage ('w/v' - the weight of the solute in grams
multiplied by 100 divided by the volume of solution in millilitres) express
concentrations as percentages (parts per hundred). Aqueous reagents such
as acids are often labelled in concentrations of weight percentage.
Weight-volume percentage is often used for solutions made from solid
reagents, e.g. a 15% sodium chloride solution contains 15 g of NaCl per
100 mL of solution, that is 150gL–1. Solutions of aqueous reagents are
often described in terms of volume percentage ('v/v' — the volume of the
solute in millilitres multiplied by 100 divided by the volume of solution in
millilitres), e.g. 40% v/v ethanol contains 40 mL of ethanol per 100 mL of
solution, that is 400 mL per litre.
Dilutions are frequently used not only with dissolved chemicals, but
also with homogeneous suspensions of particles. Bacterial cultures grow
to high densities of cells (up to 1010 cells per mL) and viruses multiply to
high titres (up to 1012 infectious particles per mL). Bacterial densities are
determined by counting colonies and virus titres determined by counting

DILUTIONS 
45
plaques in a biological assay. In order to obtain a countable number of
plaques or colonies from a densely populated culture, it is usually neces-
sary to dilute a sample of the culture.
A 1:1000 (1/1000) dilution could be prepared by adding 0.001 mL of
culture (or solution) to 0.999mL of diluent (solvent). However, these
quantities are difficult to measure with precision and attempting to per-
form a large dilution such as this in a single step will result in inaccuracy.
Even small inaccuracies in measuring the volumes involved in dilutions
results in substantial error due to the fact that the multiplication involved
in calculating the original concentration of the solution magnifies the
inaccuracy.
Accuracy is achieved by performing a serial dilution - a series of small,
accurate dilutions rather than a single large dilution.
Example
To perform a 1:1000 (1/1000) dilution:
1. Prepare three tubes containing 0.9 mL of solvent/diluent.
2. Label the tubes: 10–1, 10–2 and 10–3.
3. Add 0.1 mL of the solution/culture to the 10–1 tube and mix
thoroughly.
4. Transfer 0.1 mL from the 10–1 tube to the 10–2 tube and mix
thoroughly.
5. Transfer 0.1 mL from the 10–2 tube to the 10–3 tube and mix
thoroughly.
6. Perform the relevant assay, e.g. bacterial colony count, virus plaque
assay, determine the optical density, etc., on the dilutions.
7. Calculate the results and remember to multiply the answer obtained by
the reciprocal of the dilution to determine the concentration of the
original culture or solution:
V

46 
MOLARITIES AND DILUTIONS
where N = concentration of the original culture/solution; R = result
obtained from the assay; D = reciprocal of the dilution tested; and
V= volume tested.
We could make this more accurate by making 10-fold dilutions by
adding 1 mL culture or solution to 9 mL, since larger volumes can be
measured with greater accuracy, although it is also more wasteful and
you need to have enough of the original culture (1mL). Alternatively,
performing the dilution and assay in duplicate or triplicate and taking
the average of the results obtained would also be more accurate, but
possibly costly and certainly more laborious.
Note that adding 1 mL culture/solution to l0mL solvent/diluent gives
an 11-fold dilution, not a 10-fold dilution (since 1 + 9 = 10 but 1 + 10=11).
If you attempted to perform a 1:1000 serial dilution like this, you would
actually perform a 11*11*11 = 1:1331 dilution.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
On completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• write the formulae for calculating the areas and volumes of two-
and three-dimensional objects.
• calculate the areas and volumes of complex shapes.
• apply this knowledge to biological problems.
5.1. Geometry
Geometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with the properties of
space and objects. It is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, named
from Greek for 'Earth measurement'. Trigonometry is the branch of
mathematics concerned with specific functions of angles and their appli-
cation to calculations in geometry. Classically, geometry deals with sim-
ple, regular shapes (Tables 5.1 and 5.2).
5.2. Calculating areas and volumes
Calculations involving simple geometric shapes are usually straightforward
(except for ellipsoids) - use the formulae in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. However, it
is sometimes said that 'There are no straight lines in biology'. Most biolog-
ical shapes are complex, but are either approximations of simple shapes or

combinations of simple shapes. Therefore, to determine shapes and volumes
in biology, it is necessary to devise a strategy by which to approach the prob-
lem. This is a complex area which is impossible to define absolutely in sim-
ple terms, but the following examples illustrate some possible approaches.
Examples
1. A tissue is composed of cells which are roughly spherical in shape and
about 45 um in diameter. Calculate the total number of cells present in
1 cm3 of this tissue.

• Calculate the number of um3 in 1 cm3 of tissue:

2. Fibroblast cells like the one illustrated above are cultured on circular
glass coverslips 10 mm in diameter, and have a doubling time of 24 h.
If you start with a coverslip with 10 000 cells on it, how long will it
take for these cells to completely cover the coverslip?
• Convert everything into standard units, in this case um.
• Calculate the area of the coverslip in um2.
Trr2 = 78.5 mm2 = 7.85 * 107 um2
• Calculate the area of a single cell, assuming the cells are approxi-
mately triangular.
0.5(x * y) = 0.5 * 45 * 15 = 338 um2
• Calculate how many cells would cover the whole of the coverslip.
Area of coverslip/area of a single cell = number of cells required
7.85 * 107/338 = 2.32 * 105 cells required to cover the coverslip
• Calculate how long it will take for 1000 cells to multiply to give the
required number.
By repeatedly multiplying 1000 by 2, it would take about 9 days for
the original 10000 cells to cover the coverslip.

CALCULATING AREAS AND VOLUMES 
53
Are all the assumptions made valid? What practical aspects might
cause inaccuracy in this situation?
• The calculation of the area of the coverslip is accurate.
• The cells are not exactly triangular and will be variable in shape, but
in order to perform the calculation this is the best approximation
that can be made.
• Calculating how many cells would cover the whole of the coverslip is
quite accurate since the area of the coverslip is 'tessellated' into a
mosaic of very small triangles.
• The last part of the calculation is probably the least accurate, since
the rate at which the cells double is quite variable, and the growth
rate will slow down as the coverslip becomes more crowded and the
culture ages.
3. An Arabidopsis seedling has a root system which weighs 1.5g. The
average diameter of the roots is 0.2 mm. Calculate the total length and
surface area of the root system.
Assume:
• the roots have the same density as water, i.e. 1 g mL – 1;
• each root is a cylinder with a constant radius;
• the root tips have a negligible volume.
Calculate the volume of the root system:
density = weight/volume
therefore
volume = weight/density
so
1.5 g/l g mL–1 = 1.5 mL

54 
AREAS AND VOLUMES
Calculate the total root length:
Volume of a cylinder = V = Ttr2h
Therefore length of a cylinder = h = V/irr2
h = 1.5/7r * 0.01cm2
= 47.8 cm = 0.0478m
Calculate the surface area:
Surface area of a cylinder = 2-nrh (ignoring the ends)
2 * TT * 0.01 cm * 47.8 cm
= 3 cm2
These are just a few examples of how the areas and volumes of complex
biological shapes can be estimated. The art is to make the most valid
assumptions which allow biological structures to be handled as if they
were regular geometric shapes. There is usually more than one way of
approaching such problems, and practising by completing the problems at
the end of this chapter will allow you to improve your skills.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
On completing this chapter, you should be able to:
• understand and be able to manipulate exponents;
• understand and be able to manipulate logarithms;
• be able to use logarithms to perform calculations;
6.1. Exponents
An exponent (also called the 'power' or 'index') of a number indicates
how many times a number or term (the 'base') should be multiplied by
itself. Just as multiplication is a shortcut for addition:
3 * 5 = 5 + 5 + 5
So exponents are a shortcut for multiplication:
53 = 5 * 5 * 5
Similarly,
59 = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5
and
(–5)*(–5)*(–5) = (–5)3
Exponents and Logs

58 
EXPONENTS AND LOGS
and
(x + y) * (x + y) * (x + y) * (x + y) * (x + y) = (x + y)5
As you will see later, logarithms are a shortcut for exponents, since the log
function is the inverse of the exponential. How to manipulate and use
exponents can be summarized in three rules.
1. Rule 1 - to multiply identical bases, add the exponents, e.g.
37 * 39 = (3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3) * (3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3)
= 316
2. Rule 2 - to divide identical bases, subtract the exponents, e.g.
49 
4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4
43 = 
4 * 4 * 4
4 4 4
= - * - * - * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4
4 4 4
3. Rule 3 - when there are two or more exponents and only one base,
multiply the exponents, e.g.
(34)5 can be written as 34 * 34 * 34 * 34 * 34
= 34+4+4+4+4 = 320
=34*5 = 320
And, simplify [(99)9]9:
Remember, these rules apply to identical bases only - you cannot apply
them to different bases.
Note that zero raised to any power always equals zero (0n = 0) and that
any number raised to the power zero equals one (n0 = 1). Negative
exponents are the inverse of numbers raised to a positive integer:
a–n = 1/an
e.g. 6–3 = 1/63 = 1/216 = 0.0046

EXPONENTS 
59
Whenever you see a negative exponent, this should immediately suggest
that the expression has a value of less than 1, e.g.
2–3 = l/(2*2*2) = 1/8 = 0.125
Working in powers of 10:
103 = 1/10–3 = 1000
102 = 1/10–2 = 100
101 = 1/10–1 = 10
100 = 1/100 = 1
10–1 = 1/1.01 = 0.1
10–2 = 1/102 = 0.01
10–3 = 1/103 = 0.001
Fractional exponents can be dealt with in exactly the same way as integer
exponents:
The square root of any number = n0.5, e.g.
90.5 = 3
and the cube root of any number = n1/3 , e.g.
o0.33 
o
o 
= Z
Using the rules of exponents:
(25)0.2 = 2(5*0.2) = 21 = 2
In real life no one expects you to work out complex exponents by
hand - use a scientific calculator. To calculate the value of 100.65 type
this expression into your calculator and you will see that it equals 4.47.
However, the reason for the explanations in this chapter is that, even with
a calculator, you still need to understand how exponents work. So what
has all this got to do with the real world? Here is a practical example you
may be interested in. If you invested £1200 in a bank account which pays
6% interest compounded annually, how much money would be in your
account after 5 years?

60
EXPONENTS AND LOGS
If the annual interest rate is 6 per cent, this can be written as 0.06.
If you started with £1, at the end of one year, you would have
1 + 0.06 = £1.06.
At the end of the second year, you would have £1.06 + 0.06*
(1 + 0.06) = (1.06) * (1.06) = (1.06)2.
At the end of 5 years, you would have (1.06)5 = £1.33 for each pound
invested, so:
1.33 * 1200 = £1596
6.2. Exponential functions
The expression y = zx solved for y in terms of x does not graph as a
straight line on normal graph paper (Figure 6.1). Any quantity which
increases by being multiplied by the same value at regular intervals is said
to grow 'exponentially', i.e. each subsequent value is equal to the previous
value multiplied by a constant, z:
z = z*z = z*z etc.
Exponential functions occur frequently in biology because they describe
processes of growth and decay, for example in radioactive decay or bac-
terial growth.

EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS 
61
Radioactive decay
Radioisotopes are unstable forms of elements, atoms of which decay
spontaneously at random. Radioactive decay is described by the function:
where N is the amount of radioactivity remaining at time t, N0 the origi-
nal amount of radioactivity and A the decay constant for the particular
radionuclide. Since the speed at which the element decays is constant, this
is an exponential function. The term 'half-life' is used to describe the time
taken for 50 per cent of the atoms in a sample to decay. The half-life of
different radionuclides varies widely, from 300000 years in the case of
Cl to a few seconds in other cases. Living organisms contain a mixture
of radioactive 14C (half-life 5730 years) and the stable isotope of carbon,
12C. Once an organism dies the 14C is no longer replaced and slowly
decays according to the exponential decay law:
where N is the amount of radioactivity remaining after time t; N0 is the
original amount of radioactivity; A is the decay rate (as a decimal); and t the
elapsed time.
Thus the age of any object which once contained living tissue can be
estimated from the amount of 14C remaining.
Bacterial growth
During the early phase of growth in a bacterial culture, before nutrients
are exhausted or toxins build up, the number of cells doubles at regular
intervals as the cells divide:
This phase of 'exponential growth' can be described by an exponential
function:
N(t) =

62 
EXPONENTS AND LOGS
where N — the number of cells at time t and NO = the number of cells at time
zero (t0). The growth of populations is discussed in further detail below.
6.3. Logarithms
The term 'logarithm' comes from the Greek words logos, meaning 'to
calculate', and arithmos, 'a number'. Just as exponents are a shortcut
for multiplication, logarithms are a shortcut for exponents. A logarithm
is the exponent or power to which a base must be raised to yield a given
number (Table 6.1).
Logarithms are written as the sum of an integer (the 'characteristic') and
a decimal (the 'mantissa', e.g. log10 150 = 2.176: characteristic = 2, man-
tissa =0.176). Logarithms were invented by John Napier in 1614. Loga-
rithms make it possible to do multiplication and division simply by adding
and subtracting:
1. To multiply two numbers, add their logs, then determine the antilog of
the result from tables or using a calculator.
2. To divide two numbers, subtract their logs, then determine the antilog
of the result from tables or using a calculator.
Logs are also useful for many other calculations, for example to work out
the fifth root of a number, divide the logarithm of the number by 5:
The fifth root of 10 000 000 000 = log10 10 000 000 000 = 10
Divide by 5:
10/5 = 2
antilog 2 = 100

LOGARITHMS 
63
Logarithms can be converted back to real numbers by looking up tables of
antilogarithms, the inverse of the logarithm function (e.g. log x = 2.176,
.x^antilog 2.176), or on a calculator as follows:
• either the 10x key with x = logarithm value, e.g. 2.176;
• or the INV key then the log key;
• or the yx key with y = 10 and x = logarithm value.
The most commonly encountered logarithms are in base 10, written as
'logio'. Logarithms to the base 'e' (2.71828...) are known as natural
logarithms and are written as 'In' (e is Euler's number, named after a
Swiss mathematician who described e in 1728). As with exponents, there
are some simple rules which can help you work with logarithms. Since
logarithms are nothing more than exponents, these rules come from the
rules of exponents (above):
There are three rules that apply under conditions where: a is a positive
number not equal to 1; n is a real number (i.e. all numbers representable
by an infinite decimal expansion, that is the ratio a/b, where a and b
are integers and b does not equal zero); and x and y are positive real
numbers.
1. Rule 1 - log a(x*y) = loga (x) + loga(y), i.e. you can multiply two
numbers by adding their logarithms.
2. Rule 2 - loga (x/y) = loga (x) — loga (y), i.e. you can divide two numbers
by subtracting their logarithms.
3. Rule 3 - loga (x)n = nloga (x), i.e. the logarithm of an exponent gives
the original number.
Remember the exponential function y = zx described in Section 6.2?
When this function is plotted on semi-log graph paper (also called log-
linear graph paper, where the y axis has a log rather than a linear scale),
or if the log values of y are plotted, the log transformation of the expo-
nential function results in the exponential curve being transformed into a
straight line (Figure 6.2).
Logarithms can be used to solve exponential equations which occur
commonly in biology, e.g. pH:
pH=-log[H +]

Human blood plasma has a typical H + concentration (written as '[H "*" ]')
of 10~ 7'4M. Therefore:
-7.4
pH of blood = - log 10-4 = 7.4
Another example is the exponential growth of populations. The growth
of a population is described by the equation:
N(t) =
where N is the size of the population at time £; NO is the size of the original
population; e is Euler's number; and A is the growth rate (as a decimal).
During the growth phase of a bacterial culture, the rate of increase of
cells is proportional to the number of bacteria present. The constant of
proportionality, //, is an index of the growth rate and is called the growth
rate constant:
Rate of increase of cells = n * number of cells
The value of /i can be determined from the following equation:
In W,-
The natural logarithm of the number of cells at time t minus the natural
logarithm of the number of cells at time zero (to) equals the growth rate
constant multiplied by the time interval. For most purposes, it is easier to
use Iog10 values rather than natural logarithms. Since natural logarithms

LOGARITHMS 
65
are to the base e, the above equation can be converted to log10 by dividing
by 2.303 (note: In x = 2. 303 log #, so the natural log of any number
divided by 2.303 gives the logio of that number):
Iog10 JV - logio Afo = (/V2.303)(t - t0)
or alternatively
By measuring the increase in the number of cells during a certain time
period, the growth rate constant (a.) can be calculated, e.g. if:
t0 = 1.5h, 
No = 8.4 * 101, 
then log10N0 = 1.92
t = 8.5h, 
W = 3.39*108, 
and log10N = 8.53
fi = [(loglo tf - loglo tf0)2.303]/(f - to)
Therefore in this case:
fj, = [(8.53 - 1.92)2.303]/(8.5 - 1.5)
A further example is the decibel scale of sound intensity:
dB=101og10///o
where / is the intensity of the sound and /o is the intensity of a reference
sound (1 * 10~12Wm~2, the lowest sound intensity detectable by the
human ear). We use decibels because the ear is capable of hearing a very
large range of sound - more than a billion-fold difference in intensity. To
deal with such a range, logarithmic units are most useful.
If the sound intensity at a heavy metal concert is recorded as
0.5 * lO^1 Wm~2, what is the intensity of the sound in decibels?
dB = 101og10(I / I0)
= 10 * log10(0.5 * 10-1 * 10-12)
= 10* 10.7
= 107 dB

66 
EXPONENTS AND LOGS
The engine of a Ferrari makes a noise of 105 dB and a Ford engine makes
a noise of 99 dB. How many times more intense is the Ferrari engine noise?
difference in noise = 105 - 99 = 6dB
Remember that a difference of 10 dB represents a 10-fold difference in
sound intensity, so the Ferrari is six times louder than the Ford.

Introduction to Statistics
LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
On completing this chapter, you should understand:
• statistical variables;
• how to construct a frequency distribution;
• how to calculate percentiles.
7.1. What is statistics?
Statistics is the systematic collection and display of numerical data.
Unfortunately, statistics is also the most abused area of numeracy. The
reason for this is that, although it is easy to generate a single number to
represent a complex dataset, unless appropriate statistical techniques are
used the results are meaningless - garbage in, garbage out!
Statistical analysis should ideally follow a defined procedure:
1. Research question.
2. Statistical question.
3. Data collection.
4. Statistical conclusion.
5. Research conclusion.

INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS
Frequently this is not the case, and you will be presented with data you
have not been involved with collecting and asked to draw conclusions.
Such a process contains many possible pitfalls and to avoid them it is
necessary to have a firm understanding of different statistical methods
and their limitations. Before we can do this, however, it may be a good
idea to try to explain some of the jargon which surrounds statistics.
7.2. Statistical variables
Different classes of information are known as the variables of a dataset,
e.g. age, weight, height, gender, marital status, annual income, etc. Vari-
ables which are experimentally manipulated by an investigator in an ex-
periment are called independent variables. Variables which are measured
are called dependent variables, since they depend on the way in which the
independent variables have been set up. All other factors which may affect
the dependent variable(s) are called confounding, extraneous or secondary
variables. These are important, since unless they are the same for each
group being tested, comparisons between groups and statistical conclu-
sions will be unreliable. Variables may be classified as either quantitative
or qualitative (Figure 7.1).
Qualitative data provide labels, or names, for categories of like items,
i.e. a set of observations where any single observation is a word or code
that represents a class or category. Examples of qualitative variables are
age (see below), gender and marital status. Qualitative data can be further
divided into:
1. Nominal variables - variables with no inherent order or ranking
sequence, e.g. numbers used as names (group 1, group 2 ...), gender,
etc.

2. Ordinal variables - variables with an ordered series, e.g. 'greatly
dislike, moderately dislike, indifferent, moderately like, greatly like'. If
numbers are assigned to such variables they indicate rank order only -
the 'distance' between the numbers has no inherent value.
3. Interval variables - equally spaced variables, e.g. temperature. The
difference between a temperature of 66° and 67° is the same as the
difference between 76° and 77°. Interval variables do not have a true
zero, e.g. 88° is not necessarily 'double' the temperature of 44° this all
depends on the scale (e.g. Celsius or kelvin).
4. Ratio variables - variables spaced at equal intervals with a true zero
point, e.g. age.
Quantitative data measures either how much or how many of something,
that is, a set of observations where any single observation is a number that
represents an amount or a count. Examples of quantitative variables
are weight, height and annual income. Quantitative data can be divided
into:
1. Discrete variables - the set of all possible values which consists only of
isolated points, e.g. counting variables (1, 2, 3 ...). An example of such
data might be the number of students in a class, which will always be
an integer, and never '53.7'.
2. Continuous variables - within the limits of the variable range,
continuous variables can take on any possible value. Examples of such
data might be the length or weight of a group of animals, e.g. 52.1,
52.8 and 52.9 g.
7.3. Statistical methods
Statistics is the science of collecting and displaying numerical data. Sta-
tistics are used to summarize or describe the basic features of datasets and
present quantitative descriptions in a manageable form, for example, how
do the marks on this year's course compare with last year's marks? De-
scriptive statistics (Chapter 8) are used to analyse the basic features of
data under consideration. They do not draw conclusions from the data,
but merely illustrate patterns or trends. There are many different descrip-
tive methods which can be used for this purpose.

Numerical measures of data sets are diverse, including (but not limited
to): proportion, percentage, mean (average), median, mode, percentiles,
range, variance and standard deviation. These are described in detail in
the next chapter.
Graphical methods comprise all visual methods which summarize
data, e.g.
1. Bar charts/histograms.
2. Pie charts.
3. Scatter diagrams.
Graphs make it particularly easy to see features in numerical data. Un-
fortunately, as with other statistical methods, graphs are frequently
abused. Some things you may have forgotten about graphs include:

FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS 
73
1. Graphs generally have two axes (plural of axis), a horizontal x-axis (or
abscissa) and a vertical y-axis (or ordinate), which should be clearly
labelled.
2. The intersection between the axes represents the zero point - if it does
not, the graph should make this clear, e.g. by axis labels or breaks.
3. The axes should be long enough so that values and labels can be easily
read, but not hugely dissimilar in length.
4. A graph should be sufficiently clear that it does not need an
accompanying explanation other than a brief title or legend. If any
graph is not this clear, the data has been presented in the wrong format.
Chapter 8 contains a further explanation of descriptive statistics.
7.4. Frequency distributions
The basis of most statistical investigations is construction of a frequency
distribution, the number of observations for each of the possible cate-
gories in a dataset. For nominal variables, the order in which the cate-
gories are listed makes no difference. For ordinal, interval, ratio variables
and all quantitative data, the categories should be listed in rank order (e.g.
Table 7.1).
Grouped frequency distributions
Remember that the aim of descriptive statistics is to analyse the basic
features of a dataset. Complex data can be simplified by combining
individual scores to form a smaller number of groups, referred to
as class intervals. These intervals should be: mutually exclusive, i.e.

non-overlapping; all of the same width; and continuous throughout the
distribution (e.g. Table 7.2).
Cumulative frequency distributions
Cumulative frequency distributions are useful to show what proportion of
a dataset lies above or below certain limits (e.g. Table 7.3).
What percentage of this class scored the required pass mark of 41%? By
looking at the cumulative percentage column, it is easy to see that 10% of
the class scored 40% or less, so 90% achieved the pass mark.
Percentiles are points on a frequency distribution below which a specified
percentage of cases in the distribution falls, for example a person scoring at
the 75th percentile did better than 75% of those in the distribution:
Percentile = ———
1UU
where n = number of cases and P = desired percentile.

The 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles are also referred to as quartiles (Q1,
Q2, Q3), since they divide the dataset into quarters (e.g. Table 7.4). In this
example, the range (from the highest datapoint to the lowest datapoint) is
88 (highest mark —lowest mark, i.e. 99 — 11 = 88). Therefore, in this
example, each quarter of the dataset is 22, so:
P25 =11+22=33
P50 = 33 + 22=55
P75 =55 + 22=77
Calculating percentiles from grouped data is slightly more complicated.
An interpolation method is required:
1. Find the group within which the percentile lies.
2. Determine the percentage between the bottom of the distribution and
the group containing the percentile.
3. Determine the number of additional datapoints required to make up
the percentile.

4. Assume that the scores in the group are evenly distributed. (This as-
sumption is necessary since there is no way to know the exact dis-
tribution within each group.)
5. Find the additional number of datapoints in the group required to
make up the percentile.
6. Add this to the number of datapoints between the bottom of the
distribution and the group containing the percentile.
Percentile = LCB + {[(k* n/100) - CFB]//} * i
where LCB = the lower class boundary of the interval containing the per-
centile; k = percentile; n = total number of scores in the distribution;
CFB = cumulative frequency of all the intervals below the interval con-
taining the percentile; f=the frequency (i.e. number of scores) in the
interval containing the percentile; and /" = interval size (i.e. range of scores
in the interval containing the percentile).
To find a percentile, (k*n/100) must be calculated first in order to
identify the interval in which the percentile is located (e.g. Table 7.5).
7.5. Frequency distribution graphs
Graphs can make it particularly easy to see features in numerical data. For
example, a cumulative frequency curve reveals the shape of a frequency
distribution (Figure 7.2).

INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS
Histograms
A frequency histogram is a series of rectangles representing the frequen-
cies of the class intervals (Figure 7.3). The same data can also be drawn as
a frequency polygon (Figure 7.4).
Which format is best? To some extent, the choice of graph formats is a
matter of personal preference, but in general a histogram is best used for
ungrouped data and discrete variables, and a polygon is best for grouped
data and continuous variables. However, other graph formats can also be
used. A bar diagram has gaps between the categories (groups) and there-
fore should only be used to represent discrete variables or categories

(Figure 7.5). Pie diagrams represent relative frequencies, so can be used
for grouped data and continuous variables (Figure 7.6).
Graphical methods are an important part of statistics, being perhaps the
most powerful way of revealing the shape of data distributions (Figure 7.7).
Different-shaped frequency distributions are described by their degree of
skew (lack of symmetry about the mean - see next chapter) and kurtosis
(the size of the 'tails', extremities, of the curve). This can also affect the cal-
culation of some (but not all) statistics, as you will see in the next chapter.

Descriptive Statistics
LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
On completing this chapter, you should understand the significance
of and how to calculate measures of the central tendency and varia-
bility of a dataset:
• mode, median and mean;
• range, variance and standard deviation;
• standard error and confidence intervals.
8.1. Populations and samples
In statistics, the population is the entire group from which data may be
collected and conclusions drawn. However, since populations may be very
large and inconvenient to work with, statistical analysis is frequently per-
formed on a sample, a smaller group drawn from the population. Assuming
the sample is representative of the population, e.g. selected at random and
sufficiently large, conclusions made about the sample should be valid for
the population as a whole. For example, if we wanted to know whether
children born in China in the 1950s were shorter than children born in
China in the 1970s, it would be impossible to study the populations, i.e. all
children born in China in the 1950s and 1970s, since these are far too large.
However, statistical conclusions drawn about samples taken from these

84 
DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
two populations should be valid for the whole population, assuming that
the samples are unbiased and truly representative of the populations. So far
so good. However, depending on the sample size, a statistic calculated for a
sample based on the formula for a population may tend to produce a biased
result, that is, an overestimate or an underestimate of the true value. For
this reason, formulae for calculation statistics from samples often contain a
small correction (e.g. n — 1 in place of w, the number of datapoints) to
provide a more accurate answer. For this reason, you always need to be
clear whether you are calculating a statistic for a population or a sample,
and to use the correct formula (if appropriate).
8.2. The central tendency
Different frequency distributions can be described mathematically by
measuring the central tendency and variability of the dataset. The central
tendency is a summary measure of the middle of a dataset, which is
commonly measured by any of three common descriptive statistics, the
'3 Ms': mode, median and mean.
Mode
The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It is easy to
determine, but is subject to great variation and consequently is of limited
value.
Median
The median is the middle value in a dataset, i.e. half the variables have
values greater than the median and the other half values which are less.
The median is less sensitive to outliers (extreme scores) than the mean and
is thus a better measure than the mean for highly skewed distributions,
such as family income. Note that the median equals the 50th percentile
(P50), i.e. the second quartile (Q2).
Mean
The mean is the average value of a dataset, i.e. the sum of all the data
divided by the number of variables. The arithmetic mean is commonly
called the 'average'. When the word 'mean' is used without a modifier, it

VARIABILITY 
85
usually refers to the arithmetic mean. The mean is a good measure of
central tendency for symmetrical (e.g. normal) distributions, but can be
misleading in skewed distributions since it is influenced by outliers. There-
fore, other statistics such as the median may be more informative for
distributions which are highly skewed. The mean, median and mode are
equal in symmetrical frequency distributions. The mean is higher than the
median in positively (right) skewed distributions and lower than the med-
ian in negatively (left) skewed distributions.
The formula for the arithmetic mean is:
mean =
N
where ]T means 'sum'; X are the raw datapoints; and N is the number of
scores (datapoints).
The geometric mean is the nth root of the product of the scores, for
example, the geometric mean of the scores 1, 2, 3 and 4 is the 4th root of
1 * 2 * 3 * 4, which is the 4th root of 24 = 2.21 . The geometric mean is less
affected by extreme values than the arithmetic mean and is useful for
some positively skewed distributions. However, the arithmetic mean is
far more commonly encountered than the geometric mean.
8.3. Variability
Measurements in biology are frequently quite variable. There are many
different sources for this variation, such as biological differences between
individuals, resolution of measurement techniques and simple experimen-
tal error. It is important to be able to measure and describe the variability
in datasets. While the central tendency is a summary measure of the mid-
dle of a dataset, variability (or dispersion) measures the amount of scatter
in the dataset (e.g. Figure 8.1). Variability is commonly measured by three
criteria: range, variance and standard deviation.
Range
Range is the difference between the largest and the smallest value in the
dataset. Although it is a crude measure of variability, it is easy to calculate
and useful as an outline description of a dataset, for example in box and
whisker plots (Section 8.8). However, since the range only takes into
account two values from the entire dataset, it may be heavily influenced

different distribution (skew)
by outliers in the data. Therefore, another criterion is commonly used -
the interquartile range, the interval between the 25th and 75th percentiles.
In a normally distributed population, the interquartile range contains
50% of the datapoints making up the dataset: Q3 — Q1. A further mea-
sure which is even less subject to extreme scores is the semi-interquartile
range, which is half of the interquartile range: (Q3 — Q1)/2.
Since the semi-interquartile range is little affected by extreme scores, it is
a good measure of spread-out or skewed distributions. However, it is more
subject to sampling fluctuation (i.e. how much a statistic varies from one
sample to another) in normal distributions than the standard deviation (see
below), so it not often used for data which are normally distributed.
Variance
The variance of a dataset is more complicated to understand than the
range, but is a measure of how 'spread-out' a distribution is. A deviation
score is a measure of by how much each point in a frequency distribution
lies above or below the mean for the entire dataset:
Deviation score = X — m
where X is the raw score and m is the mean for the dataset.
The variance is the mean of the squares of all the deviation scores for a
dataset. This represents the amount of deviation of the entire dataset from
the mean:
Variance of a population = cr2 =

VARIABILITY 
87
where ^ is the sum, X is the raw score, //x is the mean of the population,
and N is the number of datapoints.
\^
Variance of a sample = s = == 
-
where ]T is the sum, X is the raw score, m is the mean of the sample, and
n is the number of datapoints in the sample.
Note that the variance is expressed in squared units, for example, if the
raw scores are weight in kg, the variance is kg2. For this reason, it is more
useful to consider the square root of the variance, which is the standard
deviation.
Standard deviation
The standard deviation (SD) is the square root of the variance and
is the most commonly used measure of how 'spread-out' a distribution
Standard deviation of a population: ax =
Standard deviation of a sample: Sx = y =^ 
—
As with the other measures of data variability, the standard deviation
determined from a sample (subset) of a dataset will be biased - since
outliers are excluded, it will tend to underestimate the population stan-
dard deviation. Hence the formula needs to be modified for samples rather
than whole populations. The standard deviation is probably the most
useful measure of data spread. As you will see, many formulas in infer-
ential statistics (Chapters 10 and 11) use the standard deviation. Although
the standard deviation is less sensitive to extreme scores than the range, it
is more sensitive than the semi-interquartile range. For this reason, the
standard deviation should at least be supplemented by if not replaced by
the semi-interquartile range when the possibility of extreme scores is pres-
ent or for highly skewed datasets.

88 
DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
8.4. Standard error
Any statistic can have a standard error, which is the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution of that statistic. Inferential statistics and signifi-
cance testing (Chapters 10 and 11), and confidence intervals (below) are all
based on standard errors. The standard deviation is an index of how closely
individual data points cluster around the mean, thus each standard devia-
tion refers to an individual datapoint. In contrast, standard errors indicate
how much sampling fluctuation a summary statistic shows, that is, how
good an estimate of the population the statistic is (e.g. the standard error of
the mean, am). The standard error of any statistic depends in part on the
sample size - in general, the larger the sample size the smaller the standard
error.
How good an estimate is the mean of a population? One way to determine
this is to repeat an experiment many times and to determine the mean of
the means. However, this is at best tedious and frequently impossible.
Fortunately, the standard error of the mean can be calculated from a
single experiment and indicate the variability of the statistic:
SD
We will come back to the use of standard errors again later.
8.5. Confidence intervals
In a normal distribution 68% of datapoints fall within ±1 standard
deviations from the mean; 95% of datapoints fall within ±2 standard
deviations from the mean (actually ±1.96 standard deviations); and
99.7% of datapoints fall within ±3 standard deviations from the mean
(Figure 8.2).
A confidence interval gives an estimated range of values which is likely
to include an unknown datapoint. The width of the confidence interval
gives us some idea about how uncertain we are about the parameter, for
example, a very wide interval may indicate that more data should be
collected before anything very definite can be said about the parameter.
Confidence intervals are more informative than the results of inferential
tests (Chapters 10 and 11), which only help you decide whether to reject a

hypothesis, since they provide a probable range of numerical values for
statistical parameters.
In a normal distribution, since there is less than a 1 in 20 chance of any
datapoint falling outside ±2 standard deviations from the mean, we say
that this range represents the 95% confidence interval, and the probability
(P) of this range containing a particular datapoint is P = 0.95 (Chapter 9
contains a more detailed explanation of probability). Similarly, since there
is less than a 1 in 99.7 chance of any sample in the population falling
outside ±3 standard deviations; this represents a 99% confidence interval
for the population, and P = 0.99. Confidence intervals can be constructed
for any statistical parameter, not just the mean.
So when do you use standard deviations, standard errors or confidence
intervals?
1. Use standard deviations when you are referring to individual data
points. This tells you about the spread of the data.
2. Use standard errors when you are referring to differences between
sample statistics, e.g. the mean. This tells you about the accuracy of
your estimate.
3. Use confidence intervals when you want to convey the significance of
differences between groups.

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
8.6. Parametric and non-parametric
statistics
Statistical methods which depend on estimates of the parameters of popu-
lations or probability distributions are referred to as parametric methods,
and include: Student's £-test; ANOVA (analysis of variance); regression
analysis; and correlation analysis. These tests are only meaningful for con-
tinuous data which is sampled from a population with an underlying
normal distribution, or whose distribution can be rendered normal by
mathematical transformation. Non-parametric methods require fewer as-
sumptions about a population or probability distribution and are applic-
able in a wider range of situations. For example, they can be used with
qualitative data, and with quantitative data when no assumption can be
made about the population probability distribution.
Non-parametric methods are useful in situations where the assumptions
required by parametric methods are questionable. A few of the more
commonly used non-parametric methods include: x2 test; Wilcoxon
signed-rank test; Mann—Whitney—Wilcoxon test; and Spearman rank cor-
relation coefficient. These tests are 'distribution free', i.e. the population
from which the sample was drawn does not need to have a normal dis-
tribution. Unlike parametric tests which can give erroneous results if ap-
plied to the 'wrong sort of data', these methods can be safely used in a
wider range of circumstances. Unfortunately, they are less flexible in prac-
tice and less powerful than parametric tests.
In statistical jargon, accuracy is a measurement of how close the average
of a set of measurements is to the true or target value. Precision is a
measure of the closeness of repeated observations to each other with-
out reference to the true or target value, i.e. the reproducibility of the
result.

CHOOSING AN APPROPRIATE STATISTICAL TEST

8.7. Choosing an appropriate statistical test
In order to choose an appropriate statistical test, you must answer two
questions:
1. What are the features of the dataset being analysed?
2. What is the goal of the analysis?
Table 8.1 summarizes some of the statistical tests which can be used to
analyse different datasets. Not all of these tests are described in this book,

but they have been included in the table for reference purposes. In
subsequent chapters we will explore the most frequently employed statisti-
cal methods and how they can be used.
8.8. Exploratory data analysis
Hopefully, it will now be clear that one of the most important aspect of
statistics is to use the appropriate method rather than a test which may
generate a meaningless and misleading answer. Choosing a test largely
depends on the nature of the data being analysed, and critically whether
this has a normal distribution (so a parametric test can be used) or not
(meaning a non-parametric method must be used). This crucial informa-
tion can be obtained through a process known as exploratory data anal-
ysis, which includes many tools designed to reveal possible errors in the
data (calculation or experimental errors, typing mistakes, etc.), data out-
liers, which should be investigated, and the underlying nature of the dataset
(e.g. frequency distribution).
Exploratory data analysis comprises many different methods, including
descriptive statistics, but the most powerful are graphical methods which
literally paint a picture of the dataset. As an example, we will look at
some of the most frequently used methods, all of which are easily per-
formed by hand or with commonly available software.
Scatter plots
Consider the three datasets in Table 8.2. At first sight, all three look very
similar, with identical means and standard deviations. However, a scatter
plot of the data quickly reveals considerable differences between the three
datasets (see Figures 8.3 - 8.5).
Frequency distribution histograms
A frequency distribution is a series of rectangles representing the frequen-
cies of the class intervals. Since this was described in the previous chapter
(Section 7.5), we will not repeat the description here.

The numbers to the left are the 'stem' of the plot - the tens digits in the
frequency distribution of the dataset. The numbers to the right are the
'leaves' - the units digits in the frequency distribution, e.g. 5 6 represents
a score of 56. Scores greater than 99 can be represented as follows: 25 6
for 256, 67 9 for 679, etc. The effect produced is that of a histogram, but
each individual datapoint can be seen. No graphical software is necessary
to produce the pattern, which can easily be reproduced in text form. In
this example, the data approximates to a normal distribution (with a
slight left-skew).
Box and whisker plots
This alternative method of examining data makes use of common calcu-
lated numerical measures (median, interquartile range), but displays the
data in a visual form (Figure 8.6). In the top plot in Figure 8.6, the median
value is symmetrically placed in the middle of the box (interquartile range,
which by definition covers 50% of the points in the dataset), so this
dataset is normally distributed. In the middle plot, the interquartile range
(box) is the same, but here the median value is at the right-hand end of the
box, meaning that this dataset does not have a normal distribution, but
has what is known as a right or positive skew. This dataset would provide
inaccurate answers if subjected to parametric tests (unless transformed to
a normal distribution first). In the lower plot, the median value is again in

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
Figure 8.6 Box and whisker plots
the middle of the interquartile range, but this (i.e. the box) covers less of
the dataset, meaning that there are more outliers in the data which could
reduce the accuracy of any statistical analysis.
Examining the data in question using the above methods before apply-
ing any statistical tests is vital to any meaningful analysis, ensuring that
any numerical summaries of the data or predictions made from the data
are valid. Unfortunately, it is frequently overlooked. Always carry out
some form of exploratory data analysis before proceeding further. Pref-
erably draw at least one picture or graph. Much of statistics is about
detecting patterns - something which the human eye and brain are very
good at.

Probability
LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
On completing this chapter, you should understand the basic
principles of probability theory, including:
• how to calculate probability in simple scenarios;
• the difference between selection with and without replacement;
• how to calculate the probability of multiple events.
9.1. Probability theory
Although most people find probability an interesting and enjoyable area
of mathematics, why should a biologist need to understand and know
how to calculate probabilities? This is because statistical methods depend
upon probability theory.
Examples include important activities such as sampling from popula-
tions and hypothesis testing (Chapter 10), and probability distributions
(Chapter 8).

number of specific outcomes of a trial
Probability, P= 
F
total number of possible outcomes of a trial
The simplest way to understand probabilities is through proportional
frequency.

100 
PROBABILITY
Example
In a group of mice there are 200 white mice and 50 brown mice:
1. Probability, P, is normally written as a decimal, e.g. P = 0.5. All
probabilities lie between 0 and 1.
2. The proportional frequency of brown mice is 50/250 = 1/5 = 0.2.
3. If we randomly take one mouse there is a 1/5 chance of it being brown
(0.2).
4. The probability of picking a brown mouse as a single random sample is
equivalent to the proportional frequency of brown mice in the group
(population).
5. If there were 250 white mice, the probability of selecting a brown
mouse would be 0/250 = 0. The probability of selecting a white mouse
would be 250/250-1.
9.2. Replacing or not replacing selections
If we replace the first selection from a population before making a
second selection, then the probability of making any given selection is
unaltered. Thus, in the above example the probability of picking a
brown mouse is still 50/250 = 1/5 = 0.2. However, if we do not replace
our first selection the probability when making the second selection
changes.
Example
In a group of mice there are 200 white mice and 50 brown mice:
1. Selection one — a brown mouse.
2. If this is not replaced there are now 249 mice (not 250) and only 49
brown mice (not 50). The probability of picking a brown mouse in the
second sample is now 49/249, not 50/250. The chance of randomly
selecting a brown mouse has decreased (slightly).

CALCULATING THE PROBABILITY OF MULTIPLE EVENTS 
101
3. Similarly, the probability of randomly picking a white mouse in the
second sample is now 200/249 rather than 200/250 as it would have
been in the first selection, i.e. the chance of picking a white mouse in
the subsequent selection increases as the chance of picking a brown
mouse decreases.
Studying repeated samples (selections) from natural populations is easier
if we assume that replacement occurs. This is usually true if the popula-
tion is large, for example, taking one locust from a swarm of millions will
not significantly change the overall population. When the result of the first
sample does not affect the probability of the result of subsequent samples,
the samples are said to be independent (an important requirement of
many of statistical tests).
9.3. Calculating the probability
of multiple events
There are two rules of probability:
1. The SUM or OR rule - the probability of any one of several distinct
events is the sum of their individual probabilities, provided that the
events are mutually exclusive (occurrence of one event precludes the
others, e.g. selection without replacement).
2. The PRODUCT or AND rule - the probability of several distinct
events occurring successively or jointly is the product of their
individual probabilities, provided that the events are independent
(the outcome of one event must have no influence on the others, e.g.
tossing a coin).
The number of possible combinations of events is given by the factorial
product of the number of events (written as 'n') - the product of an
integer and all the lower integers, for example, for three events (X, Y,
Z), the number of possible combinations = 3! — 3*2*1 = 6:

PROBABILITY
Note that these are all different combinations, for example, crossing the
road then looking for cars is not the same as looking for cars then crossing
the road.
Example
A population of 50 brown mice, 200 white mice, selections with
replacement:
1. The probability of three brown mice in three selections:
(50/250) * (50/250) * (50/250)
-(1/5)* (1/5)* (1/5)-0.008
2. The probability of selecting, in order, brown, brown and then white:
(50/250) * (50/250) * (200/250)
-(1/5)* (1/5)* (4/5) =0.032
3. If, however, we are not interested in the order (i.e. brown, brown, white)
but just the overall outcome (i.e. two brown, one white), the probability
is different. The possible outcome of three selections with replacement is
shown in Table 9.1. Thus, the sum of probabilities of a set of mutually
exclusive, exhaustive outcomes is 1, but the probability of two brown
mice and one white mouse, irrespective of the order of selection is as
shown in Table 9.2. Note the difference in outcome between an ordered
selection (probability = 0.032) and selection irrespective of order
(probability — 0.096) — the sum of all the possible ordered selections.

9.4. The binomial distribution
The binomial probability distribution describes what will happen when
there are only two possible outcomes of an event, e.g. tossing a coin
(heads or tails) or selections from a population consisting of two types
of member (e.g. brown and white mice).
Such binary variables turn out to occur quite frequently in biology. In its
simplest form, the binomial expansion summarizes the possible outcomes
for any number of samples when there are only two possible outcomes
(e.g. brown and white mice). For independent events, the binomial dis-
tribution is given by:
where P is the probability of one of the possible events, Q is the prob-
ability of the second event (Q = 1 — P), and n is the number of trials in the
series.
For samples of 1 (« = 1): (P + Q)1 = (P + Q),
For samples of 2 (n = 2): (P + Q)2 = P2 + 2PQ + Q2,
For samples of 3 (n = 3): (P + Q)3 - P3 + 3P2Q + 3PQ2 + Q3, etc.
To return to the mice, these expansions of the binomial equation de-
scribe all the possible outcomes from the experiment above. If P = brown
mice and Q = white mice, for three samples from the population (n = 3)
there is: one way of obtaining three brown mice (BBB) = P3; three ways of
obtaining two brown mice and one white mouse (BBW:BWB:WBB) =
3P2Q; three ways of obtaining one brown mouse and 2 white mice
(BWW:WBW:WWB) = 3PQ2; and one way of obtaining three white mice
(WWW) = Q3.

104 
PROBABILITY
These are all the possible outcomes. In the population from which the
samples were drawn:
50 brown mice, P = 50/250 = 0.2
200 white mice, Q = 200/250 = 0.8
and we can therefore calculate the distribution of outcomes from the
binomial equation. In this example we can calculate the probability of
two brown mice and one white mouse being selected as:
3P2Q = 3(0.2)2(0.8) = 0.096
This method is acceptable when there is a small number of samples and a
small number of outcomes, but gets progressively more difficult as the
sample size increases. For example, try using this method to calculate
how many different ways there are to select seven brown mice and six
white mice in 13 selections. To perform such calculations as this, we can
use the following equation:
n\
Number of outcomes = r!(n - r)!
where n is the number of selections and r is the number of one of the
outcomes (remember '!' = factorial).
Example
For two brown mice and one white mouse (i.e. BBW, BWB, WBB), the
number of outcomes is:
3! 
3 * 2 * 1 _ 6
— "~ — J
2!(3-2)! 
2*1(1) 
2
So for seven brown mice and six white mice, the number of possible out-
comes is given by:
13! 
13! 
13*12*11*10*9*8
7!(13-7)! 
7!* 6! 
6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

THE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION 
105
If we know the probability of the outcome for a single selection (e.g.
probability of selecting a brown or a white mouse), we can calculate
the total probability for the outcome using:
where P is the total probability of the outcome (e.g. two brown mice and
one white mouse), p is the probability of the event that occurs r times, and
(1 — p) is the probability of the event that occurs n — r times.
In our example of two brown mice and one white mouse:
3!
2!(3-2)! \250J 
\250J
= 3 * (0.2)2 * (0.8)1 = 3 * 0.04 * 0.8 = 0.096
In practice, rather than actually performing such calculations, it is more
usual to look up the probability of an event from a pre-calculated table of
binomial probabilities (Appendix 3).
A particular importance of probability theory in statistics is that it
controls sampling of populations and can be used to determine how large
a sample needs to be taken from a population in order for an experiment
to be successful, i.e. to have a statistically meaningful outcome.
Example
Suppose that 4% of students carry an inherited defect in the (mythical)
statz gene which restricts the ability of carriers to understand statistics.
The only way to determine if someone is a carrier is to select individuals
from the population at random and test them. If the number of students
tested is too small there is a risk of not finding any carriers, but if it is too
large, it will not be possible to mark all the tests. What sample size is
required to give a good likelihood of sampling affected individuals? The
binomial distribution can be used in a case such as this because the vari-
able is binary, that is, each individual will or will not carry the defective
gene. If 4% of students are carriers of the gene, then F = 0.04 (statz~)
and Q = 0.96 (statz + ). To find the probability of finding some (i.e. one or
more) carriers of the gene, the most common method is to calculate is the
probability of no cases [i.e. P(0)] for a given sample size, e.g. 10. Using the
binomial equation, if the number of carriers, r, is 0, and the number of

106 
PROBABILITY
trials, «, is 10, we can calculate the probability of testing 10 individuals
and finding no carriers:
(NB. Any number raised to the power 0 is 1 and any number raised to the
power 1 is itself, e.g. 20° = 1 and 20 * = 20, so 1! = 0! = 1.)
p(0) = 1*1* 0.9610
P(0) = 0.67
Thus, if 4% of students are carriers, there is a 67% chance that a sample
of 10 students will fail to find any carriers. This tells us a sample size of 10
is too small to give a reasonable chance of finding at least one carrier, so
we need to test a larger sample of the population:
1. If the number of students tested is 20, P(0) = 0.9620 = 0.44, i.e. there is
now a 56% chance of finding an affected carrier (1 – 0.44 = 0.56).
2. If the number of students tested is 40, P(0) = 0.9640 = 0.20, i.e. a 80%
chance of finding an affected carrier (1 — 0.2 = 0.8), etc.
Of course, the lower the frequency of any characteristic in a population,
the higher the probability of not finding any positive results in a small
sample. For example, if only 1% of students are statz+ there is only a
10% chance of finding a carrier in a sample of size 10, i.e. P(0) = 0.9910 =
0.9. This method is useful to determine the minimum sample number
needed to obtain at least one positive result from a sample for any binary
variable, for example to find at least one affected carrier in a random
sample. For other types of variable which may be continuous and nor-
mally distributed, the usual method of determining sample sizes to use the
standard deviation (Chapter 8).
9.5. Coincidences
When working with large numbers (populations), probability theory has
some unexpected results. Many apparently unexpected coincidences are

PROBLEMS (ANSWERS IN APPENDIX 1) 
107
merely the result of probability theory operating on very large popula-
tions, for example:
1. The chances of winning the UK National Lottery jackpot with a single
ticket are about 14 million to one. What are the chances of someone
who buys one Lotto ticket every week winning the jackpot twice within
a year? Astronomical? Not necessarily. The chance of any single person
(e.g. you) winning the jackpot twice within a year are approximately
1014 to one, but if 25 million people each buy one ticket every week, the
chance of anyone winning the jackpot twice within a year are much
greater - less than 100 to one.
2. What are the chances that someone else in a group of people has the
same birthday as you?
P=1 – (364/365 * 363/365 * 362/365 ...)
In a group of 22 people, there is a 50% chance that two people have
the same birthday (P = 0.5). In a group of 120 people it is likely that
someone else has the same birthday as you (work it out yourself).
3. In a large grassy field, the chances of putting your finger on a particular
blade of grass are millions to one, but if you reach down and touch the
ground, the chance of touching any blade of grass is nearly 100% (P = 1).
Why do 'coincidences' matter? They matter because, when you are trying
to determine if an event is statistically significant or not, the seemingly
logical 'expected' answer can be very misleading - events which might
seem very unlikely to occur by chance can do precisely that if enough
cases are involved. Consider a statistical analysis of whether banging your
head against a hard surface can cure the common cold. Many studies of
this problem are conducted, each with 95% confidence limit (P = 0.05).
As soon as 20 studies have been performed, there will be, on average, at
least one scientific paper published which proves that banging your head
against a wall cures colds. Yet if you had a cold, what would you do?

Inferential Statistics
LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
On completing this chapter, you should understand:
• how to draw reliable conclusions about samples taken from
larger populations;
• how to compare different populations;
• when to use various inferential statistical methods;
• when not to use particular inferential statistical methods.
10.1. Statistical inference
To infer means to conclude from evidence. Statistical inference allows the
formation of conclusions about almost any parameter of a sample taken
from a larger population, for example, are conclusions based on a sample
valid for the whole population? It also allows the formation of conclu-
sions about the difference between populations with regard to any given
parameter. There are two methods of reaching these sorts of statistical
inference, estimation and hypothesis testing.
Estimation
In estimation, a sample from a population is studied and an inference is
made about the population based on the sample. The key to estimation is

112 
INFERENTIAL STATISTICS
the probability with which particular values will occur during sampling;
this allows the inference about the population to be made. The values
which occur are inevitably based on the sampling distribution of the po-
pulation. The key to making an accurate inference about a population
therefore depends on random sampling, i.e. where each possible sample
of the same size has the same probability of being selected from the po-
pulation. In real life, it is often surprisingly difficult to take truly random
samples from a population. Shortcuts are frequently taken, e.g. every third
item on a list, 'expert' opinion, or simply taking the first n results obtained.
Estimation is a relatively crude method of making population inferences.
A much better method and the one which is normally used in statistical
analysis is hypothesis testing.
Hypothesis testing
To answer a statistical question, the question is translated into a hypoth-
esis - a statement which can be subjected to test. Depending on the result
of the test, the hypothesis is accepted or rejected. The hypothesis tested is
known as the null hypothesis (H0). This must be in the form of a
true/false statement. For every null hypothesis, there is an alternative
hypothesis (HA). Constructing and testing hypotheses is an important
skill, but the best way to construct a hypothesis is not necessarily obvious:
1. If one of the two hypotheses is 'simpler' it is given priority so that a
more 'complicated' theory is not adopted unless there is sufficient
evidence against the simpler one (Occam's Razor: 'If there are two
possible explanations always accept the simplest').
2. In general, it is 'simpler' to propose that there is no difference between
two sets of results than to say that there is a difference.
3. The null hypothesis has priority and is not rejected unless there is
strong statistical evidence against it.
The outcome of hypothesis testing is to 'reject H0' or 'do not reject H0'. If
we conclude 'do not reject H0', this does not necessarily mean that the null
hypothesis is true, only that there is insufficient evidence against H0 and in
favour of HA. Hypothesis testing never proves that the null hypothesis is
true, just as rejecting the null hypothesis suggests but does not prove that
the alternative hypothesis may be true.

PROCEDURE FOR HYPOTHESIS TESTING
In order to decide whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis, the
level of significance (a) required of the result must be decided. In general
terms:
a = 0.05 - significant (confidence interval 95%, P = 1 -0.95 = 0.05),
most commonly used;
Q = 0.01 - highly significant (confidence interval 99%, P = 1 - 0.99 =
0.01), strong statistical evidence;
a =0.001 - very highly significant (confidence interval 99.9%, P =
1 - 0.999 = 0.001), rarely used.
The level of significance allows us to state whether or not there is a
'significant difference' (note that this is a technical term which should
only be used in the correct context) between populations, that is, whether
any difference between populations is a matter of chance, due to experi-
mental error, or so small as to be unimportant.
10.2. Procedure for hypothesis testing
1. Define HO and HA, based on the guidelines given above.
2. Choose a value for a. Note that this should be done before performing
the test, not when looking at the result.
3. Calculate the value of the test statistic.
4. Compare the calculated value with a table of the critical values of the
test statistic.
5. If the calculated value of the test statistic is less than the critical value
from the table, accept the null hypothesis (Ho). Note that this does not
mean that the null hypothesis has been conclusively proved, only that it
has not been rejected.
6. If the calculated value of the test statistic is greater than or equal to the
critical value from the table, reject the null hypothesis (Ho) and accept
the alternative hypothesis (HA).

114 
INFERENTIAL STATISTICS
Note that very small P-values (e.g. 0.001) do not signify large statistical
differences, only that the observed differences are highly improbable given
the null hypothesis tested. P-values indicate how sure you can be that
there is a real difference, not the size of the difference. For example, a
very small P-value can arise when any difference is tiny but the sample
sizes very large. Conversely, a large P-value can arise when the effect is
large but the sample size is small.
10.3. Standard scores (z-scores)
z-scores define the position of a score in relation to the mean using the
standard deviation as a unit of measurement. They are therefore useful for
comparing datapoints in different distributions.
z = (score — mean)/standard deviation
The z-score is the number of standard deviations by which the score
departs from the sample mean. Since this technique normalizes distribu-
tions, z-scores can be used to compare data from different sets, e.g. a
student's performance on two different exams (e.g. did Joe Blogg's per-
formance on test 1 and test 2 improve or decline?):
1. Joe B scored 71.2% on exam 1 (mean = 65.4%, SD = 3.55) z =
(71.2–65.4)/3.55 = 1.63.
2. Joe B scored 66.8% on exam 2 (mean = 61.1%, SD = 2.54) z —
(66.8–61.l)/2.54 = 2.24.
3. Conclusion - Joe B did better, compared with the rest of his
classmates, on exam 2 than on exam 1, even though his mark was
lower in the second exam.
Note that the z-score is a parametric statistic (Chapter 8), and is only
meaningful when it refers to a normal distribution - calculating a z-score
from a skewed dataset may not produce a meaningful number. Compar-
ing z-scores for different distributions is also meaningless unless: the da-
tasets being compared are as similar as possible (e.g. response to different
doses of a drug under the same physiological conditions); and the shapes
of the distributions being compared are as similar as possible.

STUDENT'S t-TEST (t-TEST) 
115
10.4. Student's t-test (t-test)
Biological systems are complex, with many different interacting factors.
To compensate for this, the most common experimental design in biol-
ogy involves comparing experimental results with those obtained under
control conditions. To interpret this type of experiment, we must be able
to make objective decisions about the nature of any differences between
the experimental and control results - is there a statistically significant
difference or are the results due to experimental error or random chance
(e.g. sampling error)? A frequently used test of statistical significance
is Student's t-test (or simply t-test), devised by William Gosset ('Stu-
dent') in 1908. The t-test is used to compare two groups and has two
variants:
1 . Paired t-test — used when each data point in one group corresponds to
a matching data point in the other group.
2. Unpaired /-test - used whether or not the groups contain matching
datapoints.
The t-test is a parametric test which assumes that the data analysed:
• Is continuous, interval data comprising a whole population or is
sampled randomly from a larger population.
• Has a normal distribution (Chapter 8).
• If the sample size (n) is < 30, the variances (Chapter 8) of the two
groups should be similar (t -tests can be used to compare groups with
different variances if n > 30).
• The sample size should not differ hugely between the groups (e.g.
If you use the f-test under other circumstances, the results may be mis-
leading. In other situations, non-parametric tests should be used to com-
pare the groups, for example, the Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired
data and the Wilcoxon rank sum test or Mann—Whitney test for unpaired
data (not covered in this book). The t-test can only be used to compare
two groups. To compare three or more groups, other tests must be used,
for example, analysis of variance between groups (ANOVA; see Section

116 
INFERENTIAL STATISTICS
10.5). In general though, the t-test is quite robust and produces approxi-
mately correct results in many circumstances.
The paired t-test is used to investigate the relationship between two
groups where there is a meaningful one-to-one correspondence between
the data points in one group and those in the other, for example a variable
measured at the same time points under experimental and control condi-
tions. It is not sufficient that the two groups simply have the same number
of datapoints. The advantage of the paired t-test is that the formula pro-
cedure involved is fairly simple.
Procedure
1. Start with the hypothesis (H0) that the mean of each group is equal,
that is, there is no significant difference between the means of the
two groups, e.g. control and experimental data. The alternative
hypothesis (HA) is therefore that the means of the groups are not equal.
We test this by considering the variance (standard deviation) of each
group.
2. Set a value for a (significance level, e.g. 0.05).
3. Calculate the difference for each pair (i.e. the variable measured at the
same time point under experimental and controlled conditions).
4. Plot a histogram of the differences between data pairs to confirm that
they are normally distributed - if not, stop.
5. Calculate the mean of all the differences between pairs (dav) and the
standard deviation of the differences (SD).
6. The value of t can then be calculated from the following formula:
t =
where dav is the mean difference, i.e. the sum of the differences of all
the datapoints (set 1 point 1 — set 2 point 1, etc.) divided by the
number of pairs; SD is the standard deviation of the differences
between all the pairs; and N is the number of pairs. NB. The sign of t
( +1 — ) does not matter; assume that t is positive.

STUDENT'S t-TEST (t-TEST) 
117
7. The calculated value of t can then be looked up in a table of the t
distribution (Appendix 3, or obtained from appropriate software). To
do this, you need to know the 'degrees of freedom' (df) for the test. The
result of any statistical test is influenced by the population size, for
example it is more accurate to make 200 measurements than 20 mea-
surements. Since the number of observations (population size) affects
the value of statistics such as t, when we calculate or look up t, we need
to take the population size into account - this is what degrees of
freedom does. For a paired t-test:
df — n — 1 (number of pairs — 1)
To look up t, you also need to determine whether you are performing a
one-tailed or two-tailed test. In any statistical test we can never be 100%
sure that we have to reject (or accept) the null hypothesis. There is there-
fore the possibility of making an error as shown in Table 10.1.
Table 10.1 
The possibility of making an error
Null hypothesis

False
Decision

Type I error

Type II error
Falsely rejecting a true null hypothesis is called a type I error. The prob-
ability of committing a type I error is always equal to the significance level
of the test, a. Failure to reject a false null hypothesis is called a type II error.
The 'power' of a statistical test refers to the probability of correctly claim-
ing a significant result. As scientists are generally cautious, it is considered
'worse' to make a type I error than a type II error; we thus reduce the
possibility of making a type I error by having a stringent rejection limit,
5% (a = 0.05). However, as we reduce the possibility of making one type
of error, we increase the possibility of making the other type. Whether you
use a one- or two-tailed test depends on your testing hypothesis.
1. One-tailed test - used where there is some basis (e.g. previous exper-
imental observation) to predict the direction of the difference, such as
expectation of a significant difference between the groups. In some
circumstances, one-tailed tests can be valuable, for example if it is
proposed that a new drug is more effective in the treatment of a disease
than an existing drug. The new drug should only be adopted if there is a
significant improvement in treatment outcome.

118
INFERENTIAL STATISTICS
2. Two-tailed test - used where there is no basis to assume that there may
be a significant difference between the groups; this is the test most
frequently used. The result of a two-tailed test does not tell you if any
difference between groups is 'greater than' or 'less than', only that
there is a significant difference.
They are called 'tails' because of the region of retention and regions of
rejection on a graph of the distribution of the test statistic (Figure 10.1).
Note that the alternative hypothesis states 'there is a difference'; it does
not state why there is a difference or whether the difference between the
two groups is 'greater than' or 'less than'. If the alternative hypothesis had
specified the nature of the difference, this would have been a one-tailed
hypothesis. However, if the alternative hypothesis does not specify the
nature of the difference, we can accept either a reduction or an increase
and it is therefore a two-tailed hypothesis. For a variety of reasons two-
tailed hypotheses are safer than one-tailed. Statistical tables are sometimes
tabulated only for one-tailed hypotheses. To convert them to two-tailed,
double the value of a. A table of critical values of t for Student's t dis-
tribution is given in Appendix 3.
If the calculated value of t is greater than or equal to the critical value of
the test statistic, the null hypothesis is rejected, that is, there is evidence of
a statistically significant difference between the groups. If the calculated
value of t is less than the critical value, the null hypothesis is accepted -
there is no evidence of a statistically significant difference between the two
groups.
The unpaired t-test does not require that the two groups be paired in
any way, or even of equal sizes. A typical example might be comparing a
variable in two experimental groups of patients, one treated with drug A
or Region of retention

'Tails'

119
and one treated with drug B. Such situations are common in medicine
where an accepted treatment already exists and it would not be ethical
to withhold this from a control group. Here, we wish to know if the
differences between the groups are 'real' (statistically significant) or could
have arisen by chance. The calculations involved in an unpaired t-test are
slightly more complicated than for the paired test. Note that the unpaired
t-test is equivalent to one-way ANOVA (Section 10.5), used to test for a
difference in means between two groups.
_
(SEB)2
where X is the mean of groups A and B, respectively, and SE = SD/^/N.
For an unpaired t-test:
df = (nA + nB) - 2
where n is the number of values in the two groups being compared. Note
that this is different from the calculation of the number of degrees of
freedom for a paired t-test. Compare the calculated value of t with the
critical value in a table of the t distribution (Appendix 3). Remember that
the sign of t ( + / — ) does not matter, and assume that t is positive. If the
calculated value of t is greater than or equal to the critical value, the null
hypothesis is rejected - there is evidence of a statistically significant dif-
ference between the groups. If the calculated value of t is less than the
critical value, the null hypothesis is accepted - there is no evidence of a
statistically significant difference between the groups.
Example
Consider the data from the following experiment. A total of 12 readings
were taken, six under control and six under experimental conditions
(Table 10.2). Before starting to do a t-test, several questions must be
answered:
1. Are the datapoints for the control and experimental groups paired?
No, they are just replicate observations, so we need to perform an
unpaired t-test.
2. Are the data normally distributed?

Two-tailed, since we have no firm basis to assume the nature of any
difference between the groups.

ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) 
121
8. How many degrees of freedom are there?
df = («A-1) + (nB-1) = 10
9. From the table of critical values of t (Appendix 3), we can see that for
a two-tailed test with df = 10 and a = 0.05, t would have to be 2.228
or greater for > 5% (0.05) of pairs of samples to differ by the
observed amount.
10. Since tcalc = 0.62 and tcrit = 2.228, the null hypothesis is accepted.
The conclusion is that there is no evidence of a statistically significant
difference (at the 95% confidence level) between the experimental
and the control groups in this experiment.
10.5. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
Student's t-test can only be used for comparison of two groups. Although it
is possible to perform many pair-wise comparisons to analyse all
the possible combinations involving more than two groups, this is undesir-
able because it is tedious, but more importantly because it increases
the possibility of type I errors (Section 10.4). However, ANOVA can com-
pare two or more groups. ANOVA is a parametric test which assumes that:
1. The data analysed is continuous, interval data comprising a whole
population or sampled randomly from a population.
2. The data has a normal distribution. Moderate departure from the
normal distribution does not unduly disturb the outcome of ANOVA,
especially as sample sizes increase, but highly skewed datasets result in
inaccurate conclusions.
3. The groups are independent of each other.
4. The variances in the groups should be similar. For ANOVA, this is
more important to accuracy that normal distribution of the data.
5. For two-way ANOVA, the sample size the groups is equal (for one-
way ANOVA, sample sizes need not be equal, but should not differ
hugely between the groups). This is because the results of ANOVA

122 
INFERENTIAL STATISTICS
tests can be upset by different variances in the groups, but this effect is
minimized if the groups are of the same or similar sizes.
ANOVA tests come in various forms:
1. One-way (or one-factor) ANOVA - tests the hypothesis that means
from two or more samples are equal (drawn from populations with
the same mean). Student's t-test is actually a particular application
of one-way ANOVA (two groups compared) and results in the same
conclusions.
2. Two-way (or two-factor) ANOVA - simultaneously tests the
hypothesis that the means of two variables ('factors') from two or
more groups are equal (drawn from populations with the same mean),
for example the difference between a control and an experimental
variable, or whether there is a difference between alcohol consumption
and liver disease in several different countries. It does not include more
than one sampling per group. This test allows comments to be made
about the interaction between factors as well as between groups.
3. Repeated measures ANOVA - used when members of a random sample
are measured under different conditions. As the sample is exposed to
each condition, the measurement of the dependent variable is repeated.
Using standard ANOVA is not appropriate because it fails to take into
account correlation between the repeated measures, violating the
assumption of independence. This approach can be used for several
reasons, such as where research requires repeated measures, for
example, longitudinal research which measures each sample member
at each of several ages - age is a repeated factor.
The F-ratio ('Fisher ratio') compares the variance within sample groups
('inherent variance') with the variance between groups ('treatment effect')
and is the basis for ANOVA:
F = variance between groups/variance within sample groups
ANOVA works by comparing the relationship between the variability
within groups, across groups and the total. The actual ANOVA calculation
itself is quite laborious and best performed using statistical software
(Appendix 2). If you insist on knowing the equations involved, they can
be looked up in a statistics textbook or software manual. This chapter will
concentrate on how to use ANOVA. The basic procedure is similar to that

ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA)

for performing a t-test:
1. Formulate the null hypothesis, i.e. that the means of the groups are equal.
2. Choose a confidence interval and set the significance level accordingly,
e.g. CI = 95%, a-0.05.
3. Calculate the test statistic (F) (best done using software).
4. Compare the calculated value of F with a table of critical values of F.
5. If the calculated value of the F is less than the critical value from the
table, accept the null hypothesis (Ho). If the calculated value of F is
greater than or equal to the critical value from the table, reject the null
hypothesis (Ho) and accept the alternative hypothesis (HA).
Examples
Tables 10.3-10.5 show an example of one-way ANOVA. The null
hypothesis is that there is no difference between the four groups being

compared. In this example, with a significance level of 95% (a —0.05),
since the calculated value of F (3.23) is greater than Fcrit (3.01), we reject
the null hypothesis that the three drugs perform equally. The null hypoth-
esis would have been rejected if even one of the groups differed signifi-
cantly from the other three. A post-hoc comparison or series of individual
pair-wise comparisons would have to be performed to determine which
pair or pairs of means caused rejection of the null hypothesis, but since
this was not part of the original question, we cannot address this directly
here. If ANOVA is performed on three or more groups and it finds a
significant difference, then a post-hoc test (also called pair-wise compar-
isons, multiple comparison tests, and multiple range tests) needs to be
performed in order to make multiple comparisons between the groups.
By comparing pairs of groups in every possible combination, the differ-
ences among them are revealed. There are various post-hoc tests which
can be used, such as the 'Bonferonni', 'Scheffe', 'Tukey' and 'LSD' (least

post-hoc tests, so you will need to consult other sources or software man-
uals if you are ever in a position to need such tests.
Tables 10.6-10.8 show an example of two-way ANOVA. As always,
the null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the groups being
compared. In this example, with a significance level of 95% (a = 0.05),
the calculated value of F (10.57) for the table rows (orchard 1 vs orchard
2) is greater than Pcrit (2.82), so the hypothesis that there is no difference
between the orchards is rejected. However, the calculated value of P
(0.48) for the table columns (bait 1 vs bait 2) is less than Fcrit (4.84), so
the hypothesis that there is no difference between the pheromone baits is
accepted. This example only compares two groups, so it is relatively easy
to interpret the outcome.

INFERENTIAL STATISTICS
10.6. x2-test
This is an example of a non-parametric test which, unlike Student's t-test
and ANOVA, makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data.
X2 (pronounced 'kye-squared') is used when data consists of nominal
or ordinal variables rather than quantitative variables, when we are
interested in how many members fall into given descriptive categories
(not for quantitative measurements, such as weight, etc.).
The x2-test of independence asks 'Are two variables of interest indepen-
dent (not related) or related (dependent)?' and deals with nominal and
ordinal variable expressed as integers, that is, variables which fall into
different, mutually exclusive categories. This is distinct from the t-test,
which deals with interval variables, although the ANOVA test can also
be performed on nominal data (Chapter 7). The x2-test investigates
whether the proportions of certain categories are different in different
groups. When the variables are independent, knowledge of one variable
gives no information about the other variable. When they are dependent,
knowledge of one variable is predictive of the value of the other variable,
for example:
1. Is level of education related to level of income?
2. Is membership of a political party related to a person's preferred
television station?
3. Is there a relationship between gender and examination performance?
The x2-test has two main uses: comparing the distribution of one category
variable (nominal or ordinal) with another; and comparing an observed
distribution with a theoretically expected one.
The expectation might be that the data would be normally distributed,
or that particular attributes (e.g. treatment and disease) are independent,
meaning there is no closer association than might be expected by chance.
In the first case, a table of values for a normal distribution would be the
source of the expected values. In the second, the expected values would be
calculated assuming independence (random distribution). The x2-test is a
non-parametric test which assumes that the data analysed:
1. Consist of nominal or ordinal variables.
2. Consist of entire populations or are randomly sampled from the
population.

X2-TEST 
127
3. No single data point should be zero (if so, use Fisher's exact test;
Section 10.7).
4. All the objects counted should be independent of one another.
5. Eighty per cent of the expected frequencies should be 5 or more (if not,
try aggregating groups or use Fisher's exact test for small sample sizes;
Section 10.7).
If you use the x2-test under other circumstances, the results may be
misleading. The X2 -test is by default one-tailed and can only be carried
out on raw data (not percentages, proportions or other derived data). The
basis of the x2-test is:
'-y
2 
^-\ (observed frequency — expected frequency)
expected frequency
Note that acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis can only be inter-
preted strictly in terms of the question asked, for example 'There is a
difference between the observed and expected frequencies' or 'There is
no difference between the groups' and not extrapolated to 'There is a
difference between the observed and expected frequencies because . . .' .
Example A: comparing the distribution of one
category variable with another
Of 120 male and 100 female applicants to a university, 90 male and 40
female had work experience. Does the gender of an applicant to university
correspond to whether or not they have prior work experience?
The starting point for most x2 analyses of this type is to construct a
contingency table, a table showing how the values of one variable are
related to ('contingent on') the values of one or more other variables:
Work experience
Gender of applicant
Male
Female
Total
Yes

40
130
No
30
60

128 
INFERENTIAL STATISTICS
Next, formulate the null hypothesis (Ho): male and female applicants have
equivalent work experience (HA, male and female applicants have
different work experience). Set a confidence interval, e.g. CI = 95%, so
a = 0.05. Calculate x2:

X2 = 27.64
As explained earlier, the distribution of x2 depends upon the number of
degrees of freedom (df) in the test:
df = (number of columns — 1) * (number of rows — 1)
For the above test, df = (2 — 1) * (2 — 1) = 1. Look up the calculated value
of x2 in a table of critical values of the x2 distribution (Appendix 3). If the
calculated value of x2 is greater than the critical value of x2 (from the
table), reject H0. If the calculated value of x2 is less than the critical value
of x2 (from the table), accept H0.
In this example, x2 = 27.64, greater than the critical value for 1 df, so
the null hypothesis is rejected - male and female applicants do not have

2-TEST 
129
equivalent work experience. Note that, from the test result alone, we
cannot say whether males or females have greater work experience, only
that the two groups are not equal. In this example, it is fairly easy to work
out which group has greater work experience by simply scrutinizing the
table. The x2-test has simply proved that the difference between the two
groups is statistically significant (at a 95% confidence level). Of course, the
differences between groups are not always as clear-cut as in this example.
Alternative method: x2 calculation
using observed and expected values
An alternative method of calculating x2 for the above example is to cal-
culate the expected distributions assuming the null hypothesis to be true:
130 students out of a total of 220 had work experience. If the proportion
of males and females with work experience were equivalent we would
expect: males with experience = (130/200) * 120 = 71. Table 10.9 shows
the contingency table.

X2 = 11.2 + 16.2 = 27.4. From the table of critical values of x2, the
calculated value is greater than the critical value, so the null hypothesis
is rejected. The advantage of this method is that it can be applied to
problems where there are more than two groups, for example:
1. Each of a group of 1350 students were immunized with one of five
influenza vaccines under test. Is there any evidence that any one influenza
vaccine is better than the others based on the numbers of students who
developed influenza and those who did not?
2. We can produce a table with observed and expected values (not shown
here). The overall x2 value will inform us whether there are differences
between the vaccines.

130 
INFERENTIAL STATISTICS
3. The sums of the (O — E)2/E for each vaccine will provide information
about the contribution of each vaccine to the overall x2 - the vaccine
contributing the most to the overall difference will have the largest
(O - E)2/E.
Example B: comparing an observed distribution
with a theoretically expected one
Using the method of observed and expected values we can use the x
to compare an observed distribution with a theoretically expected one
For example, in a population of mice:

Expected from genetic theory
White

51%
Brown

40.8%
Black

Do the proportions observed differ from those expected? Formulate the
null hypothesis (H0): the observed distribution does not differ from the
expected distribution (HA, the observed distribution differs from the ex-
pected distribution). Set a confidence interval, e.g. CI = 95%, so a = 0.05.

FISHER'S EXACT TEST 
131
Calculate x2 = 2.875. Calculate df:
df = (number of columns — 1) * (number of rows — 1)
(columns = observed, expected = 2; rows = white, brown, black = 3)
= (2- 1)*(3- 1) = 1 *2 = 2
From the table of critical values of x2 (Appendix 3), the calculated value
of x2 is less than the critical value, so the null hypothesis is accepted.
Although the x2-test is, strictly speaking, non-parametric, it still has
limitations. All the objects counted should be independent of one another,
so the outcome of counting one should not influence the outcome of
counting any of the others. Eighty per cent of the expected frequencies
should be 5 or more. If this is not the case, it is sometimes possible to get
around this difficulty by aggregating (combining) groups. Also, no single
data point should be zero. This can present an insuperable problem. For
datasets where many of the values are less than 5 or any are equal to 0, it
is necessary to substitute Fisher's exact test for the x2-test (Section 10.7).
10.7. Fisher's exact test
Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890–1962) 'the father of modern statistics',
developed the concept of likelihood:
The likelihood of a parameter is proportional to the probability of
the data and it gives a function which usually has a single maximum
value, called the maximum likelihood.
He also contributed to the development of methods suitable for small
samples and studied hypothesis testing. Fisher's exact test is an alternative
to x2 for testing the hypothesis that there is a statistically significant
difference between two groups. It has the advantage that it does not make
any approximations (Fisher's exact test), and so is suitable for small sam-
ple sizes. Fisher's exact test is a non-parametric test which assumes that:
1. The data analysed consist of nominal or ordinal variables.
2. The data consist of entire populations or be randomly sampled from
the population, as in all significance tests.
3. The value of the first unit sampled has no effect on the value of
the second unit - independent observations. Pooling data from

assumption.
4. A given case may fall in only one class - mutual exclusivity.
The formula for calculating Fisher's exact test is not complex, but can be
tedious. Where:

As long as the criteria for test have been met, you can perform Fisher's test
using statistics software or one of the many online calculators (search the
internet for 'Fisher's' 'exact' and 'calculator').

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
On completing this chapter, you should understand:
• the differences between correlation and regression;
• when to use each;
• the limitations of these tests.
11.1. Regression or correlation?
The correlation between two or more variables demonstrates the degree to
which the variables are related. Linear regression demonstrates the rela-
tionship between selected values of X and observed values of Y, from which
the most probable value of Y can be predicted for any value of X. Both
correlation and regression are based on geometry and graphs and plots.
Linear regression and correlation are similar and easily confused. In some
situations it makes sense to perform both calculations. Calculate linear
correlation if:
• You measured both X and Y in each subject and wish to quantify how
well they are associated.
• Do not calculate a correlation coefficient if you manipulated both
variables, for example salt intake (in diet) and blood pressure (by drug
Correlation and Regression

136 
CORRELATION AND REGRESSION
treatment). There is no point in measuring correlation unless one
variable is independent (manipulated by experimentation) and the other
dependent (on the first variable), or both variables are independent
(from observation rather than experimentation).
Calculate linear regressions only if:
• One of the variables (X) is likely to precede or cause the other variable
Choose linear regression if you manipulated the X variable. It makes a
big difference which variable is called X and which is called Y, as linear
regression calculations are not symmetrical with respect to X and Y. If
you swap the two variables, you will obtain a different regression line.
In contrast, correlation calculations are symmetrical with respect to X
and Y. If you swap the labels X and Y, you will still get the same
correlation coefficient.
11.2. Correlation
Correlation, the relationship between two variables, is closely related to
prediction. The greater the association between variables, the more accu-
rately we can predict the outcome of events which have not yet happened.
In biology, of all subjects, there is rarely an exact correlation of observed
results with a mathematical function - the points never fit exactly on the
line. The question is therefore whether an association between two vari-
ables could have occurred by chance. There are numerous methods for
calculating correlation, for example:
1. The Pearson, or 'r-value', correlation (parametric). Calculate the
Pearson correlation coefficient if you know or can assume that both X
and Y are interval data sampled from normally distributed popula-
tions. However, with large samples, the frequency distribution of the
population is less important. Correlation is greatly affected by sample
size. With very large samples small correlation coefficients will be
statistically significant, but with small samples only very high
correlations will reach statistical significance.
2. The Spearman (rank-order) correlation (non-parametric). Calculate
the Spearman correlation coefficient if X or Y are ordinal or ranked

CORRELATION 
137
data. The Spearman correlation is based on ranking the two variables,
and so makes no assumption about the distribution of the values and
is usually calculated on occasions when it is not convenient, economic
or even possible to give actual values to variables, but only to assign
a rank order to instances of each variable. It may also be a better
indicator that a relationship exists between two variables when the
relationship between them is non-linear.
3. Many other methods (not described in this chapter), such as biserial
correlation, tetrachoric correlation, etc.
A correlation coefficient is called r, for relationship, r-Values are dimen-
sionless, that is they have no units. The r-value is a measure of the linear
association between two variables which have been measured on interval
or ratio scales, such as the relationship between height in metres and
weight in kilograms. The correlation coefficient tells us the degree of
linear association between the two variables, that is, how straight a line
they form when plotted as a graph. However, r-values can be misleadingly
small when there is a non-linear relationship between the variables. There
are advanced correlation procedures not based on linear relationships but
these are not covered in this chapter. Correlation analysis is performed in
the same as any other statistical test of significance (Chapter 10):
1. Formulate the null hypothesis ('There is no proof of an association
between the variables') and set the significance level (a) before
performing the test (e.g. 0.05).
2. Calculate the correlation coefficient (r) for the test data. The Pearson
formula is fairly straightforward but rather cumbersome:
It is usually more convenient to use statistical software to perform the
calculation (Appendix 2).
Determine whether the value of r is equal to or greater than the critical
value required to reject the null hypothesis. To do this you need to
calculate the number of degrees of freedom for the test, i.e. take into
account the number of independent observations used in the
calculation of the test statistic. For a one-tailed test df = n — l and
for a two-tailed test (most usual) df — n — 2.

CORRELATION AND REGRESSION
4. Look up the calculated value of r in a table of critical values of the
correlation coefficient.
5. If the calculated value of r is less than the critical value of r, accept the
null hypothesis - there is no proof of an association between
the variables. If the calculated value of r is greater than or equal to
the critical value of r, reject the null hypothesis - there is a significant
association between the variables.
Calculation of the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (rs) is used
when the data consists of ordinal variables (i.e. variables with an ordered
series where numbers indicate rank order only). This is a non-parametric
statistic but may be a better indicator than the Spearman coefficient that a
relationship exists between two variables when the relationship between
them is non-linear. If the data has not already been ranked, it must be
converted into rank order before performing the Spearman calculation.
When converting to ranks, the smallest value on X becomes a rank of 1,
the second smallest becomes a rank of 2 and so on, for example:
X 
Y 
X
7
4 
2

convert to ranks:

The equation for the Spearman calculation is:
r, = l- N(N2-
where N is the number of pairs (XY) and D is the difference between each
pair(X–Y).
After calculating the value of rs, this is compared with the critical value
of r as above in deciding whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.
Values of r range from + 1 (perfect correlation), through 0 (no correla-
tion), to - 1 (perfect negative correlation); see Figure 11.1.
In general terms, correlation coefficients up to 0.33 are considered to
indicate weak relationships, between 0.34 and 0.66 indicate medium
strength relationships and over 0.67 indicate strong relationships.

Warning
Correlation tests are in some ways the most misused of all statistical
procedures:
1. They are able to show whether two variables are connected. However,
they are not able to prove that the variables are not connected, so do
not overinterpret your results.
2. If one variable depends on another, i.e. there is a causal relationship so
they are not independent, then it is always possible to find some kind of
correlation between the two variables. However, if both variables
depend on a third, they can show a strong correlation without any
causal dependency between them, so take care. For example, there is a
strong positive correlation between heart surgery and death rates, but
does heart surgery cause the deaths? The missing third factor here is
heart disease, which causes both heart surgery and deaths.
Scatter plots are useful in showing pictorially what the data to be analysed
looks like. In particular, they suggest immediately whether there is a linear
relationship between the datasets or not. They also reveal the degree of
positive or negativeness of the association and show any extreme values
which might be forcing linearity. Any coordinate which is far away from

CORRELATION AND REGRESSION
the others will be connected to the bulk of the datapoints by a straight line
which might make the correlation appear significant. If the data are not
linear (e.g. they form a curve or are bimodal), then the Pearson and
Spearman methods cannot be used. Alternative non-linear regression meth-
ods such as polynomial regression should be used in these circumstances
(but are not described in this chapter).
Example
In patients undergoing renal (kidney) dialysis, is there a significant asso-
ciation between heart rate and blood pressure (see Table 11.1)? The scat-
ter plot is shown in Figure 11.2. H0 is that there is no association between

the variables, a —0.05; Pearson r-value = 0.903; df=10 —2 —8 (two-
tailed); critical value of r = 0.632; rcalc is greater than rcrit, so H0 is re-
jected - there is evidence of a significant association between the heart
rate and blood pressure in these patients. This can be seen visually by
plotting a scatter graph of this data and drawing a trendline through it.
Warning: you cannot accurately assess whether a significant correlation
between variables exists by visual examination alone.
11.3. Regression
Regression and correlation are related but distinct statistical tests. Where
correlation quantifies how closely two variables are connected, regression
finds the line that best predicts Y from values of X. Simple linear
regression aims to find a linear relationship between a response variable
and a possible predictor variable by the method of least squares. Multiple
linear regression aims to find a linear relationship between a response
variable and several possible predictor variables. Non-linear regression
aims to describe the relationship between a response variable and one or
more explanatory variables in a non-linear fashion. Simple linear regres-
sion works by minimizing the sum of the square of the vertical distances of
the points from the regression line, and hence is known as the 'least
squares' method. The calculation effectively minimizes the sizes of squares
drawn between the data points and the regression line (Figure 11.3).
The calculations involved in this process involve determining the
'residuals' between the actual and predicted values of Y. This is not

CORRELATION AND REGRESSION
complex, but it is tedious and is almost always done using statistics soft-
ware (Appendix 2). Plotting the residuals is a useful check of the regres-
sion model and can be done easily using software. A pattern in the
residual plot can reveal flaws in the regression model, i.e. the data you
are trying to fit do not plot as a straight line. Performing a regression
analysis is similar to performing a correlation test:
1. Formulate the null hypothesis - 'Y is independent of X, therefore the
slope of the regression line is 0'.
2. Calculate the test statistic. As with the correlation test, it is much more
convenient to use statistical software to perform the calculation
(Appendix 2).
3. Interpret the test statistic. The output of a linear regression analysis is
an revalue. This is equivalent to the r-value from a correlation test,
and shows how closely X and Y are related. By taking the square of the
r-value, all values of r2 become positive (remember that values of r can
range from - 1 to +1), and fall between 0 (no correlation) and 1
(perfect correlation). The revalue tells you how much your ability to
predict is improved by using the regression line, compared with not
using it. The least possible improvement is 0, i.e. the regression line
does not help at all. The greatest possible improvement is 1, i.e. the
regression line fits the data perfectly. The value of r2 is always between
0 and 1 since the regression line is never worse than worthless (r2 = 0),
and cannot be better than perfect (r2 = 1). Unfortunately, r- and r2-
values only give a guide to the 'goodness-of-fit' and do not indicate
whether an association between the variables is statistically significant.
In order to do this, it is necessary to perform a statistical test of
significance such as ANOVA or a t-test (Chapter 10). This is usually
done automatically when performing linear regression with a statistics
software and is another reason why it is much easier to use software
for these calculations rather than performing them manually.
Example
Using the data from the renal dialysis example in Section 11.2, we obtain
an revalue of 0.815 (cf. a Pearson r-value of 0.903 in Section 11.2).
Clearly this dataset shows a high degree of correlation between the two
measurements, but what do the numbers mean exactly? An r2 - value is the

PROBLEMS (ANSWERS IN APPENDIX 1) 
143
square of the correlation coefficient. Multiplying r2 by 100 gives the per-
centage of the variance of the two variables that is shared, e.g. an r2 - value
of 0.5 means that 0.5 * 100 = 50% of the variance of y is 'explained' or
predicted by the x variable. However, it is important to remember that a
very high value of r2 can arise even though the relationship between the
two variables is non-linear. The fit of a model should never simply be
judged from the r2 -value alone - it is also necessary to formally test the
statistical significance of the result, for example by comparing the calcu-
lated value of the statistic with the critical value.

Chapter 3
True or false?
3.1. The litre (L) is the SI unit of volume.
False. The cubic metre (m3) is SI unit of volume. The litre is a metric unit but
not an SI unit.
3.2. The hertz (Hz) is the SI unit of frequency.
True. 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second (1 s-1).
3.3. The kilogram (kg) is the SI unit of weight.
False. The kilogram is the SI unit of mass.

CHAPTER 3

3.4. The Celsius is the SI unit of temperature.
False. The kelvin (K) is the SI unit of temperature.
3.5. The newton (N) is the SI unit of power.
False. The newton is the SI unit of force. The SI unit of power is the watt (W).
Are the following units written correctly
or wrongly?
3.6. 3 Kg
Wrong - the kilo (1 * 103) prefix is written as a lower case k, so 3 kg is correct.
3.7. The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8ms-2.
Wrong - there should be a space between the number and the units, so
9.8ms-2 is correct.
3.8. The power output of the human heart is about 5 Watts.
Wrong - it should be 5 watts (5 W if written as an abbreviation).
3.9. A virus particle is 25 umm in diameter.
Wrong - this is a good example of how writing SI units wrongly can be
ambiguous. 25 umm could be interpreted in several ways, but if it is read as
'25 micro-milli-metres' it should be written as 25 nanometres (25 nm =
25*10-9m).
3.10. The output of a nuclear power station is 23 GW.
Correct (23 gigawatts).
Converting SI units
3.11. Write 15mm as nm.
15 mm = 15 * 10~3 m. 1 nm = 10~9 m, so 15 mm = 15 * 106 nm.

°C = K - 273 = 274 - 273 = 1°C.
3.18. Write 0.005 kg cm"3 gm-3.
0.005 kg cm-3 = 5 g cm-3. 1 m3 = 1 * 106 cm3, so 5 g cm"3 = 5 * 106 g m"3.
3.19. Convert 15ms*-1 into kmh-1.
There are 60 seconds in one minute and 60 minutes in one hour, so 60 * 60 =
3600 s * 15 = 54 000 inn-1 = 54 km h-1.
3.20. Convert 29 m3 into L.
Im3 = l*106cm3 (see question 3.14). 1L=l*103cm3, so lm3 = l*103L.

4.1. One-hundred and twenty grams of NaOH are dissolved in water to make
5440 mL of solution. The molecular weight of NaOH is 40. What is the
molarity of the resulting solution?
Amount of NaOH:
120/40 = 3 mol
Concentration (mol/L = molarity):
3/5.44 = 0.55 M
4.2. How many grams of NaCl are needed to make 120 mL of a 0.75 M
solution? The molecular weight of NaCl is 58.44.
Concentration of NaOH:
58.44* 0.75 = 43.83 gL – 1
Amount:
43.83* 0.12 = 5.26g
4.3. Sea water contains roughly 28.0 g of NaCl per litre. The molecular weight
of NaCl is 58.44. What is the molarity of NaCl in sea water?
Moles/volume (L) = Molarity:
28.0/58.44 = 0.48 mol L–1 = 0.48 M
4.4. One-hundred and twenty-seven grams of NaCl and 19.9g of sodium azide
(NaN3) are dissolved in water to make a 55 mL solution. The molecular
weight of NaCl is 58.44 and that of NaN3 is 65.01. What is the molarity of
NaN3 in the solution?
Does the presence of NaCl influence the molarity of NaN3? No, so,
amount of NaN3:
19.9/65.01 = 0.306 mol
Concentration:
0.306/0.055 = 5.57 M
4.5. Undiluted sulphuric acid (H2SO4, molecular weight 98.07) is a 98% (w/v)
solution. What is the molarity of the undiluted solution?

CHAPTER 4 
163
1 L of 98% (w/v) solution contain 980 g of solute.
grams/Mw = mol
980/98.07 = 9.99 mol in 1 L = 9.99 M.
4.6. The molecular weight of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is 66200. How
many moles of BSA are present in 15mL of 50mgmL–1 BSA solution?
15 mL of solution contains 15 * (5 * 10–2) g BSA, = 0.75 g.
0.75/66200= 1.13* 10–5 mol in l5 mL
so:
1000/15 * 1.13 * 10–5 mol = 7.53 * 10–4 mol in l L, = 7.53 * 10–4M
4.7. What volume of 0.9M KCI is needed to make 225 mL of 0.11 M solution?
The molecular weight of KCI is 74.55.
This is a dilution question - the molecular weight of KCI is irrelevant.
M1VI = M2V2
0.9 * V1 = 0.11 * 225. V1 = (0.11 * 225)/0.9 = 27.5 mL
An easier way? Work out the ratio of the molarities:
0.11/0.9=1.22. 1.22*225 = 27.5 mL.
4.8. 'TE' is a frequently used buffer solution for DNA and contains 10 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.5,1 mM EDTA. You have a 1 M stock solution of Tris-HCl
pH 7.5 and a 0.5 M stock solution of EDTA. What volume of each stock
solution do you need to make 333 mL of TE buffer?
(a) Tris:
M1V1=M2V2. 1.0* V1 =0.01*333. V, = (0.01 * 333)/1.0 = 3.33 mL
(b) EDTA - use the ratio method for this one:
0.001/0.5 = 0.002 * 333 = 0.66 mL
4.9. Chloramphenicol is soluble in ethanol at 0.1 gmL–1 but much less soluble
in water. What volume of 0.1 gmL–1 solution must be added to l00 mL of
a bacterial culture to give a final concentration of IS0 ug mL–1?
To avoid confusion, standardize the units. For this calculation, work in
gmL–1:
0.1 gmL–1 /1.5 * 10–4gmL–1 = 666.67

164 
APPENDIX 1: ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS
i.e. the stock solution is 666.67 times more concentrated than the desired
end result, so:
100/666.67 = 0.15 mL.

2.5 mL 0.2 M EDTA stock solution/100 mL
15 mL 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 stock solution/100 mL
What are the final molar concentrations of EACH of the components of
this buffer?
(a) Urea concentration:
9.9/60.06 = 0.165mol in 100 mL, therefore 1.65 mol in 1000 mL = 1.65M.
(b) SDS concentration:
22/288.4 = 0.076 mol in 100 mL, therefore 0.76 mol in 1000 mL = 0.76 M.
(c) Amount of NaCl:
5(mol L–1) * 0.077 (L) = 0.385 mol
Concentration:
0.385 mol in 100mL, therefore 3.85 mol in 1000mL = 3.85 M.
(d) Amount of EDTA:
0.2(mol L–1) * 0.0025 (L) = 0.0005 mol
Concentration:
0.0005mol in 100 mL, therefore 0.005 mol in 1000 mL = 0.005M (= 5mM).
(e) Amount of Tris:
1 (mol L – 1)* 0.015 (L) = 0.015 mol
Concentration:
0.015 mol in 100 mL, therefore O.l5 mol in 1000mL = 0.15M (= 150mM).

6.4. Simplify: logio (5* 4)
logic (5*4) = logio 5 + Iog10 4 = 0.699 + 0.602 = 1.301 (add the logs).
6.5. Simplify: logio (5/4)
log10 (5/4) = Iog105 + Iog104 = 0.699-0.602 = 0.097 (subtract the logs).
6.6. Simplify: logio (3. 3)3
3 log10(3.3) = 3*0.519= 1.56
6.7. What is the pH of a 0.011 M solution of HC1?
PH = -log[H+]
-log 0.011 = -(-1.959) = 1.959
6.8. What is the pH of 100 mL of a solution containing 9 mg of HC1? The
molecular weight of HC1 is 36.46.
(a) Molarity of HC1 = 0.009/36.46 * 10 = 0.0025 M.
(b) pH = - log 0.0025 = - ( - 2.61) = 2.61.
6.9. What is the H + concentration in a solution of HC1 with a pH of 3?
pH = -log [H+]
So concentration = antilog - [H + ] = - antilog - 3 = 0.001 M.

Number of cells mL–1 (N0) at 3 p.m. (t0) = 5.5 * 103
Number of cells mL–1 (N) at 5 p.m. (t) = 2.5 * 106
Calculate:
(a) log10 N0
log105.5*103 = 3.74
(b) log10N
log10 2.5 *106 = 6.40

6.11. A skeleton recovered from a peat bog is examined by police forensic
scientists to determine whether a crime has been committed. Based on the
decay of 14C (half-life 5730 years), they estimate that 49% of the original
14C in the skeleton has decayed. Calculate the probable age of the skeleton.
N = N0e—1
For 14C:
eA(5730) = 0.5
ln(eA(5730))=ln (0.5
(5730) A = In 0.5
A = In 0.5/5730 = -0.000121
Since 49% of the 14C has decayed, 51% remains, so:
eAt = 0.51
ln(eAt) = In 0.51
At = In 0.51
t = In 0.51/ - 0.000121 = 5566 years

6.12. The population of a wild mink on a river system increases from 2300 to
3245 in 7 years.
(a) What was the population at the end of the first year?
NO = 2300, N = 3245, t = 7 years, so:
3245 = 2300 et
3245/2300 = eAt
In (3245/2300) = In (e*)
In (3245/2300) = A * 7
A = [In 3245/2300)]/7 = 0.049
After one year:
2300 e0.049*1 =2415.
(b) How long will it take for the original population to double?
4600 = 2300 et
4600/2300 = et
2 = 6t
In 2 = In et
In2 = t
t = In 2/0.049 = 14.2 years.

7.1. Identify which type of variable each of the following parameters
corresponds to:
(a) Blood type (A, B, AB, O)
Nominal - blood groups are names with no inherent order.
(b) Number of eggs in a nest
Discrete - birds do not lay half an egg.
(c) Temperature - Celcius
Interval - no true zero point.

(d) Temperature — kelvin
Ratio - unlike Celsius, the kelvin scale does have a true zero point.
(e) Age
Ratio - equally spaced intervals with a true zero point.
(f) Questionnaire (e.g. terrible, poor, average, good, very good)
Ordinal - these categories have rank order but no inherent value.
(g) Gender
Nominal.
(h) Height
Continuous - the height of a population varies continuously between
different individuals.
(i) Apple variety (e.g. Cox, Discovery, etc.)
Nominal.
(j) Number of blood cells per mL
Discrete or continuous - depends on how the measurement is done.

8.3. How would you describe this dataset (normal, negative skew or positive
skew)?
This dataset is non-symmetrical and has a strong positive skew (right skew),
indicating that in this population there is a high frequency of samples
containing a high bacterial count.
8.4. Calculate (a) the 95th and (b) the 25th percentiles for this dataset:
Percentile = LCB + {[(k * n/100) - CFB]//} * / 
(Chapter 7)
From the table (answer 8.1):
(a) For P95 k*n/100 = 95* 120/100 =114
P95 = 9000 + [(114 - 108)/12] * 1000 = 9500
(b) For P25 k * n/100 = 25 * 120/100 = 30
/>25 = 6000 + [(30 – 18) /16] * 1000 = 6750
8.5. Calculate (a) the mean, (b) the median and (c) the mode for this dataset:
(a) Mean = u,x = ( X ) / N = 889 866/120 = 7416.
(b) Median = P50 (Q2) k * n/100 = 50 * 120/100 = 60, so:
7000 + [(60 – 34)/30] * 1000 = 7867
(c) Mode = 8259 (two occurrences).
8.6. Calculate (a) the range, (b) the semi-interquartile range, (c) the variance and
(d) the standard deviation for this dataset:
(a) Range: 9726 - 383 = 9343.
(b) Semi-interquartile range (Q2 — Q1): 7867 (answer 8.5b) – 6750
(answer 8.4b) = 1117.
(c) Variance: a2 = £(X — px)2/ N = 3 260 002.

9.1. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common recessive genetic disorder in
Caucasians - approximately one person in 2500 carries one copy of the CF
gene, which occurs with equal frequency in males and females. If a couple
are both carriers of the CF gene and have a child, the following probabilities
apply: normal child, non-carrier P = 0.25; normal child, carrier, P = 0.50;
child with cystic fibrosis, P = 0.25. What is the probability that the couple
will have:
(a) Two children (either sex) who do not carry the CF gene?
P (non-carrier) and P(non-carrier) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625

180 
APPENDIX 1: ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS
(b) One son who is a carrier?
P(boy) and P(carrier) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25
(c) Two daughters, one who is a carrier and one who has cystic fibrosis?
P(girl and carrier) and P(girl and CF)
= (0.5 * 0.25) * (0.5 * 0.25)
= (0.25* 0.125)
= 0.03125
(d) Two daughters with cystic fibrosis?
P(girl and CF) and P(girl and CF)
= (0.5 * 0.25) * (0.5 * 0.25)
= (0.125 * 0.125)
= 0.015625
These probabilities are controlled by the 'product/and' rule: the probability
of several distinct events occurring successively or jointly is the product of
their individual probabilities, provided that the events are independent.
9.2. In order to study great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) populations, 150
newts are harmlessly marked with a temporary non-toxic dye. Fifteen newts
are then returned to each of 10 ponds known to contain this species. One
week later, the ponds are fished again and, of 351 newts caught, 54 are
marked.
(a) Estimate the total population of great crested newts in these 10 ponds.
This problem can be solved using proportional frequency: 54/150 =
0.36, i.e. 36% of the marked newts were recovered.
Total population = 351 * (1 / 0.36) = 975
(b) If one pond has a population of 107 newts (15 marked), what is the
probability of catching marked (M) and unmarked (U) newts in this
order: UUMUUUMU?
P(M) = 15/107 = 0.14
P(U) = (107– 15)/107 = 0.86
[N.B. P(U) also = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.14 = 0.86]
Since this involves selection without replacement, use the AND rule:
P(UUMUUUMU) = 0.86 * 0.86 * 0.14 * 0.86 * 0.86 * 0.86 * 0.14 * 0.86
= 0.0079

9.3. In a health survey, 19 of 60 men and 12 of 40 women are found to smoke
cigarettes.
(a) What is the probability of a randomly selected individual being a male
who smokes?
This is a joint probability. The number of male smokers divided by
the total = 19/100 = 0.19.
(b) What is the probability of a randomly selected individual smoking?
This is the total number of smokers divided by the total = 31/100 =
0.31.
(c) What is the probability of a randomly selected male smoking?
This is the number of male smokers divided by the number of
males =19/60 = 0.317.
(d) What is the probability that a randomly selected smoker is male?
There are 19 males out of 31 smokers, so 19/31 =0.613.
9.4. The probability of being infected with HIV from each single exposure to one
of the following events is approximately: unprotected sexual intercourse with
an HIV carrier - 0.005; sharing an infected needle for intravenous drug use -
0.007; needlestick injuries in healthcare workers - 0.003. The cumulative
probability of being infected P(i) after n occurrences is given by the formula:
where k — the probability of being infected with HIV from each single
exposure and n = the number of occurrences. What is the probability of
being infected with HIV after:
(a) Five occurrences of unprotected sexual intercourse with an HIV carrier:
P(i) = 1 - (1 – 0.005)5
= 1 – (0.995)5
= 1 – 0.975
= 0.025
(b) Nine occurrences of sharing an infected needle for intravenous drug use:
P(i) = l – (l – 0.007)9
= 1 – (0.993)9
= 1 – 0.939
= 0.061

182 
APPENDIX 1: ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS
(c) One needlestick injury in a healthcare worker who subsequently has
unprotected sexual intercourse with an HIV carrier three times:
Here the probabilities are additive
Pneedle = 0.003
P s e x = l – ( l – 0 . 0 0 5 ) 3
=1 – (0.995)3
= 1 - 0.985
= 0.015
Overall probability of infection
0.003 + 0.015=0.018
9.5. In a practical class, you are given three tubes of an enzyme (A B C) needed to
perform an experiment you only have time to do once. A kind demonstrator
has told you that only one of the tubes contains active enzyme and the other
two are inactive. You choose tube A. To help you further, the demonstrator
tells you that tube B contains inactive enzyme. Should you stick with tube A
or switch to tube C for the experiment? (Explain why.)
Answer: switch to tube C. Why?
Originally, the probability of picking the tube containing active enzyme
was 1/3 = 0.033. The demonstrator has told you that tube B is inactive. If
you do not switch tubes, the probability remains at 0.033. However, since
one inactive tube has been eliminated, if you switch tubes, the probability of
using the active enzyme is now 1/2 = 0.5. This is a version of the famous
'Monty Hall problem' named after an American quiz show host. If you don't
think this is the right answer don't worry - lots of people have difficulty with
this. This simple problem is one of the most conceptually difficult in
probability theory and the answer seems to be counterintuitive. Find a friend
and try the experiment for yourself.

10.1. The heights of a group of girls and a group of boys was measured. The
frequency of measurements in both groups was found to have a normal
distribution:

CHAPTER 10 
183
(a) Susan's height is 1.31 m. What is her z-score?
z = (score — mean)/standard deviation
= (1.31 - 1.25)/0.06 = 1
(b) Michael's height is 1.31 m. What is his z-score?
(1.31 - 1.29)/0.05 = 0.4
(c) Sally's z-score is — 1.2. Is she taller or shorter than the average for her
group
Since her z-score is negative, she must be shorter than the average.
(d) True or false: the boys' z-scores are higher than the girls' z-scores
(explain your answer).
False. The z-scores for both groups are they same since they are stan-
dardized by the mean and standard deviation of a normal population.
(e) What percentage of boys are taller than 1.39m?
z-score = (1.39 – 1.29)/0.05 = 2 standard deviations
Since 95% of a normally distributed population is covered by ±2
standard deviations (chapter 8), 2.5% of boys will be taller than
1.39m (z-score = 2).
10.2. A group of 12 patients with high blood pressure is treated with drug A for 3

APPENDIX 1: ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS
(a) What sort of t-test should you perform to analyse these data?
Since the two sets of measurements refer to the same patients, there is
a direct one-to-one correspondence between the groups and a paired
t-test should be used.
(b) Should you use a one tailed or two-tailed test?
Since we have no means of predicting the outcome of the trial, a two-
tailed test should be used.
(c) How many degrees of freedom are there in this test?
df = n – 1 = 12 – 1 = 11
(d) Is there a statistically significant difference at the 95% confidence
level in the blood pressure of the patients after treatment with the two
drugs?
Before starting the test, are the data normally distributed?

Since the calculated value of t (tcalc) is less than the critical value of t
(tcrit) for this situation, there is no evidence of a statistically significant
difference between the two drugs.

(a) What sort of t-test should you perform to analyse these data?
Since there is no direct correspondence between the groups, an
unpaired t-test should be used.
(b) Should you use a one-tailed or two-tailed test?
Since we have no means of predicting the outcome of the trial, a two-
tailed test should be used.
(c) How many degrees of freedom are there in this test?
df = (nA +nB}- 2 = (20 + 20) - 2 = 38
(d) Is there a statistically significant difference at the 95% confidence
level in the pH readings of the lakes draining into the two rivers?
Before starting the test, are the data normally distributed?

APPENDIX 1: ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS
Since the calculated value of t (tcalc) is greater than the critical value of t
(tcrit) for this test, there is evidence of a statistically significant dif-
ference between in the pH readings of the lakes draining into the two
rivers.
10.4. The number of eggs in robins' nests in three different areas of woodland
were counted and found to be:
A: 2,0,1,1,1,3,1,3,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,3,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,1,0
B: 2,1,2,0,1,5,1,2,3,2,1,2,2,2,0,3,2,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1
C: 2,0,2,0,2,5,1,2,2,1,0,1,3,2,3,2,1,1,0,1,2,1,1,4,2
Can you perform an ANOVA test to demonstrate whether or not there a
statistically significant difference at the 95% confidence level between the
three woodlands?
Since ANOVA is a parametric test, before starting we need to ensure the
data is normally distributed:

Each of these datasets has a strong positive skew. If we were to perform an
ANOVA test on this data, the results would be meaningless (unless the
data were transformed to a normal distribution first).
10.5. A biologist measures the preference of three-spined sticklebacks
(Gasterosteus aculeatus) for various food items. In a 3h period, fish
of length less than 4cm consumed 14 Daphnia galeata, 14 Daphnia
magna and 36 Daphnia pulex, while fish longer than 4cm consumed 6
Daphnia galeata, 24 Daphnia magna and 31 Daphnia pulex. Use the x2-
test to compare the distribution of these variables and decide whether
there is a statistically significant difference at the 95% confidence level
between the feeding behaviour of the larger and the smaller stickle-
backs.

APPENDIX 1: ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS
Since the calculated value of x2 (6.14) is greater than the critical
value (5.99), the null hypothesis is rejected, i.e. there is a statistically
significant difference at the 95% confidence level between the
feeding behaviour of the larger and the smaller sticklebacks.
10.6. A group of 353 cancer patients are treated with a new drug, of the patients
who receive this treatment, 229 survive for more than 5 years after the
commencement of treatment. Compare this result with a control group of
529 similar patients treated with the previously accepted drug therapy, 310
of whom survive for more than 5 years after the commencement of
treatment. Is there a statistically significant difference at the 95% con-
fidence level between the survival rates of the patients who received the
new drug and those who received the previously accepted therapy?

Critical value of x2 (Appendix 3) = 3.84. Since the calculated value of x2
(3.51) is less than the critical value (3.84), the null hypothesis is accepted,
i.e. there is no statistically significant difference at the 95% confidence
level in survival rate between the two drug treatments.

From this, can already see that there appears to be a positive correlation
between length and weight.

= 27.4/29.9
r = 0.916
There is a very strong positive correlation between length and weight in
these earthworms, and, since the calculated value of r (0.916), is greater
than the critical value of r (0.63) for this experiment (df = n — 2 = 8,
a = 0.05; Appendix 3), this is a statistically significant result.
11.3. The lengths of the femur and humerus were measured and compared in 12
human skeletons. The data are presented here in rank order only, where
1= shortest, 12 = longest (Table 11.4). Is there a statistically significant
correlation between the length of the two bones?
Since the data are presented in rank order rather than in raw form, the
Spearman rank order correlation will be used to examine the relationship
between them. Construct a scatter plot:

rs = 0.832
Critical value of r (df = 12 – 2 = 10, a = 0.05) = 0.576 (Appendix 3), so
the null hypothesis, i.e. there is no proof of an association between the
lengths of the two bones, is rejected.
11.4. The reaction rate of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase was measured at
different concentrations of the substrate, pyruvate (Table 11.5). Using
statistics software (Appendix 2) the r2 value for this experiment was
determined as 0.939. How would you describe the accuracy of the results
of the experiment?
While an r2 value of 0.939 represents a strong correlation, this is certainly
no higher than a skilled biochemist would expect to obtain for such an
experiment:

11.5. What does an r2-value of 0.59 mean? Explain.
Fifty-nine per cent of the variance in X can be explained by variation in Y.
Likewise, 59% of the variance in Y can be explained by variation in X, and
59% of the variance is shared between X and Y. Forty-one per cent of the
variation is therefore not explained by the regression model (100 – 59 =
41). This result would therefore normally be classed as a medium-strength
correlation.

Computers are now an inescapable part of everyday life, from your med-
ical details to your bank account. Although for a while biology lagged
behind other sciences such as physics in the application of computers, this
has now changed and 'computational biology' or 'bioinformatics' is now
at the forefront of the digital information revolution. What use do com-
puters have in biology? Almost anything to do with the digital storage,
classification and analysis of biological data uses computers. In addition,
computers are increasingly about communications, through email, mobile
phones and digital radio and television.
Although they have become integrated into the fabric of life and work,
at the most basic level, computers are merely a tool. Like any other tool,
it pays to know how to use them properly. Although many of the gen-
eral aspects of the computer revolution are beyond the scope of this
book, others are highly relevant. However, to begin, we will look at
the more general uses of computers then move on to the more specific
aspects.
E-mail
Electronic mail (e-mail) is a powerful and rapid means of sending and
receiving information, including not only text files but also complete com-
puter files such as pictures, sounds or videos as 'attachments' to messages.
What email software you use is likely to be determined by local circum-
stances, but many programs are available, and some of the best are free,
e.g. Microsoft® Outlook Express® (available from www.microsoft.com).
Appendix 2 Software
for Biologists

196 
APPENDIX 2: SOFTWARE FOR BIOLOGISTS
Email seems easy, but there is more to it than meets the eye:
• DO NOT SHOUT. THAT MEANS, DON'T WRITE IN CAPITALS.
Turn the caps lock off. You can use uppercase to stress a point, but not
the whole message.
• Do not send formatted email (i.e. HTML format) unless you know the
person you are sending it to wants to receive it. Set your email
preferences to plain text.
• Remember to fill in the subject line of the message with a relevant
subject or at best you will look like a beginner, and at worse your
messages will simply be ignored.
• Spelling and grammar - Text messaging is regarded as cool by some,
but if you use text messaging-style abbreviations will the person you are
writing to be impressed by your coolness? Write in full sentences, use
the in-built spellchecker and put a little thought into composing your
message. Email lets the recipient build a mental picture of you as a
person very quickly.
• Familiarity - email should be fun, but remember who you are talking
to. First names are fine for friends and personal messages, but
'professional' messages to your bank manager or tutors should follow
the usual formalities. The best guide is to address someone by email in
the same way to would talk to them face to face.
• Getting the message - 97% of human communication is said to be non-
verbal (smiles, body posture, tone of voice, etc.). With email, you lose
all that, and it is easy to be misunderstood. What you intended as a joke
can easily be misinterpreted as offensive. A whole range of 'emoticons'
(©) and acronyms have evolved to help with this. Use them to avoid
misunderstandings, but when sending formal email, it is best to play on
the safe side.
• Recipients - check you are sending the message to the person(s) it is
intended for. Make sure you understand the difference between the
Reply (reply to only the sender of the message) and Reply to all (reply to
all recipients of the To and Cc. boxes of the message). If an email
requires acknowledgement, then you should reply promptly, but do not
automatically respond to all messages if a reply is not needed. With
email, less is more.

WORD PROCESSORS
Privacy - there is no such thing as a private email. Everything you write
can potentially be seen by many others, from email administrators to
anyone who reads your email after it has been forwarded. Always be
prepared to stand by everything you write, so read and think before
clicking Send, especially if you are feeling angry at the time.
Flames and spam - to be flamed means that you have sent an email to a
person(s) that has caused that person(s) to respond with a verbal attack
in electronic form. If you respond in the same tone, you could start a
'flame war'. There are only two smart ways to respond to flames. If you
made a mistake or regret your original message, apologize unreserv-
edly. If not, delete the flame and do not reply. Spam is any form of
unwanted and unsolicited email, including virus hoaxes. Only fools
reply to spam - just delete it. If you receive email with seriously
offensive content (e.g. racial, religious, sexual or threatening), forward
it to the administrator of your email system ('postmaster') with an
explanation and ask for action to be taken.
Word processors
Although there are many different word processing applications available,
with about a 93% share of the global market, Microsoft® Word® is by
far the single most popular word processing software package. It is im-
possible to cover all of the features of MSWord here, since the program
contains around 1 * 105 distinct editing, formatting and other commands -
just reading the complete list aloud would take several days. However,
several features of MSWord are worthy of special note:
• Spellchecker — no spellchecker is perfect, but the MSWord built-in
spellchecker is a valuable part of the program. There is no excuse to
EVER submit written work containing elementary spelling and typig
(sic) errors, so use it. The value of MSWord's built-in grammar checker
is more debatable. If you want to turn the grammar check off, go to
Tools: Options: Spelling and Grammar.
• Graphics - there are two basic types of graphics that you can include in
MSWord documents: drawing objects and pictures. Drawing objects
include AutoShapes®, curves, lines and 'WordArt'. These objects are
part of your Word document. Use the Drawing toolbar to change and
enhance these objects with colours, patterns, borders and other effects.
Pictures are graphics that were created as another file. They include

198 
APPENDIX 2: SOFTWARE FOR BIOLOGISTS
bitmaps, scanned pictures and photographs, and clip art. You can
change and enhance pictures using the options on the Picture toolbar
and a limited number of options on the Drawing toolbar.
• Macro viruses - always check documents for macros that might
contain viruses. A macro virus is a type of computer virus stored in the
macros (sequences of MSWord actions which can be recorded and
played back to repeat the actions) within a document or template.
When you open the document, the virus is activated, transmitted to
your computer and stored in your document template. From that point
on, every document you save is infected with the virus, and if other
users open these infected documents, the virus is transmitted to their
computers as well. It is strongly recommend that you turn the macro
virus protection on.
Presentation and graphics
A common complaint is that many essays and reports could be greatly
improved by the addition of relevant figures and diagrams. Although
limited graphics tools are available in MSWord, Microsoft PowerPoints
is a more sophisticated presentation graphics program. This program is
useful for creating presentations which can be projected onscreen or
printed as notes, handouts and overheads. With an increasing emphasis
on oral presentation skills, it is useful for students to become familiar with
the use of such software.
Internet resources
It used to be said that the internet is a global telephone network without a
directory. This is becoming increasingly untrue as ever more sophisticated
search engines make the task of finding online information easier. Internet
information is accessed using a web browser such as Netscapes or Micro-
soft Internet Explorer®. Both are available free of charge at www.netscape.
com and www.microsoft.com, respectively. Not using any of the informa-
tion available on the internet is a huge mistake, but of course not all the
information online is reliable. Being able to tell the difference has been
called 'information literacy', i.e. the ability to: access information effi-
ciently and effectively; evaluate information critically and competently;
use information accurately and creatively.

INTERNET RESOURCES 
199
Points to consider are:
1. Authority — who is the author and what are their qualifications? Does
the site reveal the author's education, training and background and
explain whether they are a trained expert, experienced enthusiast or an
uninformed observer?
2. Bias - is the language emotional, inflammatory, profane or confusing?
Does the information represent a single opinion or a range of opinions?
Is it likely to have been provided to support a particular agenda or
bias?
3. Clarity and order - is the information clearly stated? Does the author
define important terms? Is the format is clear, logical and easily
navigable? Does the information contain spelling, grammatical or
typographical errors?
4. Publisher - who is the publisher and what is the purpose of the site?
Does the page include the author's name, title and/or position,
organization and contact information, such as an email or postal
address? Does the address (URL) of the page include a .gov
(government), .edu/.ac (educational/academic), .com (commercial),
.org (non-profit organization) address?
5. Timeliness - is the information current? When was it posted and/or
last updated?
6. Validity - do the facts presented support the conclusions?
7. Verifiability — does the material contain unsubstantiated general-
izations? Are sources provided?
It is pointless to list here the addresses of web pages which are likely to be
out of date by this time this book is published. What is needed is for
internet users to develop an information search strategy. To a large extent,
this is the same for the internet as for interrogating any database:
1. Formulate a question.
2. Write down key search terms or phrases.
3. What is the general subject and what are some related subjects?

Although there are many internet search engines available, without doubt
the best is Google™ (www.google.com). Google is not only fast, reliable
and huge (over three billion documents indexed), but uses a unique
'PageRank™' system which delivers unbiased information. If you are
unfamiliar with the internet, you may wish to register for one of the free
online courses available. Among the best of these are Netskills (www.
netskills.ac.uk) and the Internet Detective Tutorial (www.sosig.ac.uk/
desire/internet-detective.html). The internet is not just about popstars
and pornography. Some of the best resources for biologists are given in

decade we have moved from reliance on pocket calculators to statistics
software running on personal computers and the internet. There is a vast

you use will depend largely on your local circumstances. A lot of useful
statistics software is now freely available via the internet. For example, try
searching on Google (www.google.com) for 'chi AND calculator',
'ANOVA AND calculator' or whatever you are interested in. In spite of
this, there are still limitations of free online software and a free-standing
statistical package will probably be needed. Far too many statistics
packages are available to name them all, but three of the most popular
are MINITAB®, SPSS® and Microsoft Excel® (Table A2).

Table of binomial probabilities
The following table lists the probability of attaining s successes out of n
trials, where the probability of success in any one trial is P.
To find the probability of obtaining s or more successes in n trials, add
the probabilities corresponding to s, s + 1, s + 2,... together. For example,
the probability of obtaining one or more heads in two coin flips is
0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75.
If P is greater than 0.5, then use 1 - P as the probability and n - s as the
desired number of successes (i.e. look up the probability of obtaining n-s
failures rather than s successes}.
