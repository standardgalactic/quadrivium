Author’s Acknowledgments
I am extremely grateful to the team of talented professionals at John Wiley 
and Sons for all their efforts in putting together this book. Special thanks 
go to my awesome project editor, Kim Darosett, who is the type of editor 
that all authors hope for but rarely experience: supportive, skilled, and amaz-
ingly calm in the face of any storm, including my not infrequent freakouts. 
I also owe much to the rest of the folks in both the editorial and art depart-
ments, especially Heidi Unger, Rashell Smith, Shelley Lea, Steve Hayes, 
Andy Cummings, and Mary Bednarek.
Thanks, too, to Jonathan Conrad for providing the awesome nighttime shot 
for Chapter 7, and to agent extraordinaire, Margot Maley Hutchison, for 
her continuing help and encouragement. And last but not least, I am also 
indebted to technical editor Dave Hall, without whose insights and expertise 
this book would not have been the same.

Introduction
N
ikon. The name has been associated with top-flight photography 
equipment for generations. And the introduction of the D90 has only 
enriched Nikon’s well-deserved reputation, offering all the control a die-hard 
photography enthusiast could want while at the same time providing easy-to-
use, point-and-shoot features for the beginner.
In fact, the D90 offers so many features that sorting them all out can be more 
than a little confusing, especially if you’re new to digital photography, SLR 
photography, or both. For starters, you may not even be sure what SLR means 
or how it affects your picture taking, let alone have a clue as to all the other 
techie terms you encounter in your camera manual — resolution, aperture, white 
balance, and so on. And if you’re like many people, you may be so overwhelmed 
by all the controls on your camera that you haven’t yet ventured beyond fully 
automatic picture-taking mode. Which is a shame because it’s sort of like buying 
a Porsche and never actually taking it on the road.
Therein lies the point of Nikon D90 For Dummies: Through this book, you can 
discover not just what each bell and whistle on your camera does, but also 
when, where, why, and how to put it to best use. Unlike many photography 
books, this one doesn’t require any previous knowledge of photography or 
digital imaging to make sense of things, either. In classic For Dummies style, 
everything is explained in easy-to-understand language, with lots of illustra-
tions to help clear up any confusion.
In short, what you have in your hands is the paperback version of an in-depth 
photography workshop tailored specifically to your Nikon picture-taking 
powerhouse.
A Quick Look at What’s Ahead
This book is organized into four parts, each devoted to a different aspect of 
using your camera. Although chapters flow in a sequence that’s designed to 
take you from absolute beginner to experienced user, I’ve also tried to make 
each chapter as self-standing as possible so that you can explore the topics 
that interest you in any order you please.
The following sections offer brief previews of each part. If you’re eager to find 
details on a specific topic, the index shows you exactly where to look.

2
Nikon D90 For Dummies 
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps
Part I contains four chapters that help you get up and running with your D90.
 
✓ Chapter 1, “Getting the Lay of the Land,” offers a tour of the external 
controls on your camera, shows you how to navigate camera menus to 
access internal options, and walks you through initial camera setup and 
customization steps.
 
✓ Chapter 2, “Taking Great Pictures, Automatically,” shows you how to 
get the best results when using the camera’s fully automatic exposure 
modes, including the Digital Vari-Program scene modes such as Sports 
mode, Portrait mode, and Landscape mode.
 
✓ Chapter 3, “Controlling Picture Quality and Size,” introduces you to 
two camera settings that are critical whether you shoot in automatic or 
manual mode: the Image Size and Image Quality settings, which control 
resolution (pixel count), file format, file size, and picture quality.
 
✓ Chapter 4, “Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting” 
offers just what its title implies. Look here to find out how to review your 
photos and how to take pictures using your monitor to compose the 
scene — that is, how to use the D90’s Live View mode to shoot both still 
photos and record short digital movies. This chapter also discusses how to 
delete unwanted images and protect your favorites from accidental erasure.
Part II: Taking Creative Control
Chapters in this part help you unleash the full creative power of your D90 by 
moving into semiautomatic or manual photography modes.
 
✓ Chapter 5, “Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting,” covers the 
all-important topic of exposure, starting with an explanation of three 
critical exposure controls: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. This chap-
ter also discusses your camera’s advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, 
and M); explains exposure options such as Active D-Lighting, automatic 
exposure bracketing, metering modes, and exposure compensation; and 
offers tips for using the flash.
 
✓ Chapter 6, “Manipulating Focus and Color,” provides help with control-
ling those aspects of your pictures. Head here for information about 
your camera’s many autofocusing options, for tips on how to manipulate 
depth of field (the zone of sharp focus in a picture), and for details about 
color controls such as white balance.
 
✓ Chapter 7, “Putting It All Together,” summarizes all the techniques 
explained in earlier chapters, providing a quick-reference guide to the 
camera settings and shooting strategies that produce the best results 
for specific types of pictures: portraits, action shots, landscape scenes, 
close-ups, and more.

3
 Introduction
Part III: Working with Picture Files
This part of the book, as its title implies, discusses the often-confusing aspect 
of moving your pictures from camera to computer and beyond.
 
✓ Chapter 8, “Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files,” 
guides you through the process of transferring pictures from your camera 
memory card to your computer’s hard drive or other storage device. Look 
here, too, for details about using the D90’s built-in tool for processing 
files that you shoot in the Nikon Raw format (NEF). Just as important, this 
chapter explains how to organize and safeguard your photo files. 
 
✓ Chapter 9, “Printing and Sharing Your Pictures,” helps you turn your digital 
files into “hard copies” that look as good as those you see on the camera 
monitor. This chapter also explains how to prepare your pictures for 
online sharing, create digital slide shows, and, for times when you have the 
neighbors over, display your pictures and movies on a television screen.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
In famous For Dummies tradition, the book concludes with two “top ten” lists 
containing additional bits of information and advice.
 
✓ Chapter 10, “Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features,” 
shows you how to fix less-than-perfect images using features found 
on your camera’s Retouch menu, such as automated red-eye removal. 
You also find out how to apply color effects and perform a few other 
photo-enhancement tricks.
 
✓ Chapter 11, “Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day,” 
presents information about some camera features that, while not found 
on most “Top Ten Reasons I Bought My D90” lists, are nonetheless 
interesting, useful on occasion, or a bit of both.
Icons and Other Stuff to Note
If this isn’t your first For Dummies book, you may be familiar with the large, 
round icons that decorate its margins. If not, here’s your very own icon-
decoder ring: 
 
✓ A Tip icon flags information that will save you time, effort, money, or 
some other valuable resource, including your sanity.
 
✓ Lots of information in this book is of a technical nature — digital photog-
raphy is a technical animal, after all. But if I present a detail that is useful 
mainly for impressing your technology-geek friends, I mark it with this icon.

4
Nikon D90 For Dummies 
 
✓ I apply this icon either to introduce information that is especially worth 
storing in your brain’s long-term memory or to remind you of a fact that 
may have been displaced from that memory by some other pressing fact.
 
✓ When you see this icon, look alive. It indicates a potential danger zone 
that can result in much wailing and teeth-gnashing if ignored.
Additionally, I need to point out three additional details that will help you use 
this book:
 
✓ Other margin art: Replicas of some of your camera’s buttons also 
appear in the margins of some paragraphs. I include these to provide 
a quick reminder of the appearance of the button being discussed. 
 
✓ Software menu commands: In sections that cover software, a series 
of words connected by an arrow indicates commands that you choose 
from the program menus. For example, if a step tells you to “Choose 
File➪Convert Files,” click the File menu to unfurl it and then click the 
Convert Files command on the menu.
 
✓ Camera firmware: Firmware is the internal software that controls many of 
your camera’s operations. This book was written using version 1.0.0 of the 
firmware, which was the most current version at the time of publication. 
 
 Occasionally, Nikon releases firmware updates, and it’s a good idea to 
check out the Nikon Web site (www.nikon.com) periodically to find out 
whether any updates are available. (Chapter 1 tells you how to deter-
mine which firmware version your camera is running.) Firmware updates 
typically don’t carry major feature changes — they’re mostly used to 
solve technical glitches in existing features — but if you do download an 
update, be sure to read the accompanying description of what it accom-
plishes so that you can adapt my instructions as necessary. 
About the Software Shown in This Book
Providing specific instructions for performing photo organizing and edit-
ing tasks requires that I feature specific software. In sections that cover file 
downloading, archiving, printing, and e-mail sharing, I selected Nikon ViewNX 
and Nikon Transfer, both of which ship free with your camera and work on 
both the Windows and Mac operating systems.
Rest assured, though, that the tools used in ViewNX and Nikon Transfer work 
very similarly in other programs, so you should be able to easily adapt the 
steps to whatever software you use. (I recommend that you read your soft-
ware manual for details, of course.)

 Introduction
Practice, Be Patient, and Have Fun!
To wrap up this preamble, I want to stress that if you initially think that 
digital photography is too confusing or too technical for you, you’re in very 
good company. Everyone finds this stuff a little mind-boggling at first. So take 
it slowly, experimenting with just one or two new camera settings or tech-
niques at first. Then, each time you go on a photo outing, make it a point to 
add one or two more shooting skills to your repertoire. 
I know that it’s hard to believe when you’re just starting out, but it really 
won’t be long before everything starts to come together. With some time, 
patience, and practice, you’ll soon wield your camera like a pro, dialing in the 
necessary settings to capture your creative vision almost instinctively.
So without further ado, I invite you to grab your camera, a cup of whatever it 
is you prefer to sip while you read, and start exploring the rest of this book. 
Your D90 is the perfect partner for your photographic journey, and I thank 
you for allowing me, through this book, to serve as your tour guide.

Fast Track to 
Super Snaps

In this part . . .
M
aking sense of all the controls on your 
D90 isn’t something you can do in an 
afternoon — heck, in a week, or maybe even a 
month. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t take 
great pictures today. By using your camera’s 
point-and-shoot automatic modes, you can cap-
ture terriﬁ c images with very little effort. All you 
do is compose the scene, and the camera takes 
care of almost everything else.
This part shows you how to take best advantage 
of your camera’s automatic features and also 
addresses some basic setup steps, such as adjust-
ing the viewﬁ nder to your eyesight and getting 
familiar with the camera menus, buttons, and 
dials. In addition, chapters in this part explain 
how to obtain the very best picture quality, 
whether you shoot in an automatic or manual 
mode, and how to use your camera’s picture-
playback and Live View features.

Getting the Lay of the Land
In This Chapter
▶ Attaching and using an SLR lens
▶ Adjusting the viewfinder to your eyesight
▶ Working with memory cards
▶ Getting acquainted with your camera
▶ Selecting from menus
▶ Displaying onscreen help
▶ Customizing basic operations
I
 still remember the day that I bought my first SLR film camera. I was 
excited to finally move up from my one-button point-and-shoot 
camera, but I was a little anxious, too. My new pride and joy 
sported several unfamiliar buttons and dials, and the expla-
nations in the camera manual clearly were written for 
someone with an engineering degree. And then there 
was the whole business of attaching the lens to the 
camera, an entirely new task for me. I saved up my 
pennies a long time for that camera — what if my 
inexperience caused me to damage the thing before 
I even shot my first pictures?
You may be feeling similarly insecure if your Nikon 
D90 is your first SLR, although some of the buttons 
on the camera back may look familiar if you’ve previ-
ously used a digital point-and-shoot camera. If your 
D90 is both your first SLR and first digital camera, you 
may be doubly intimidated.
Trust me, though, that your camera isn’t nearly as complicated as 
its exterior makes it appear. With a little practice and the help of this chap-
ter, which introduces you to each external control, you’ll quickly become as 

10
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
comfortable with your camera’s buttons and dials as you are with the ones 
on your car’s dashboard. This chapter also guides you through the process 
of mounting and using an SLR lens, working with digital memory cards, navi-
gating your camera’s menus, and customizing basic camera operations.
Getting Comfortable with Your Lens
One of the biggest differences between a point-and-shoot camera and an SLR 
(single-lens reflex) camera is the lens. With an SLR, you can swap out lenses 
to suit different photographic needs, going from an extreme close-up lens to 
a super-long telephoto, for example. In addition, an SLR lens has a movable 
focusing ring that gives you the option of focusing manually instead of relying 
on the camera’s autofocus mechanism. 
Of course, those added capabilities mean that you need a little background 
information to take full advantage of your lens. To that end, the next four sec-
tions explain the process of attaching, removing, and using this critical part 
of your camera.
Attaching a lens
Whatever lens you choose, follow these steps to attach it to the camera body:
 
1. Remove the cap that covers the lens mount on the front of the camera.
 
2. Remove the cap that covers the back of the lens.
 
3. Hold the lens in front of the camera so that the little white dot on the 
lens aligns with the matching dot on the camera body.
 
 Official photography lingo uses the term mounting index instead of 
little white dot. Either way, you can see the markings in question in 
Figure 1-1.
 
 Note that the figure (and others in this chapter) shows you the D90 
with its so-called “kit lens” — the 18–105mm Vibration Reduction (VR) 
zoom lens that Nikon sells as a unit with the body. If you buy a lens from 
a manufacturer other than Nikon, your dot may be red or some other 
color, so check the lens instruction manual.
 
4. Keeping the dots aligned, position the lens on the camera’s lens 
mount as shown in Figure 1-1.
 
 When you do so, grip the lens by its back collar, not the movable, 
forward end of the lens barrel.

11
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Mounting index dots
Figure 1-1: When attaching the lens, align the index markers 
as shown here.
 
5. Turn the lens in a counter-clockwise direction until the lens clicks into 
place.
 
 To put it another way, turn the lens toward the side of the camera that 
sports the shutter button, as indicated by the red arrow in the figure. 
 
6. On a lens that has an aperture ring, set and lock the ring so the aper-
ture is set at the highest f-stop number.
 
 Check your lens manual to find out whether your lens sports an aperture 
ring and how to adjust it. (The D90 kit lens doesn’t.) To find out more 
about apertures and f-stops, see Chapter 5.
 
Always attach (or switch) lenses in a clean environment to reduce the risk of 
getting dust, dirt, and other contaminants inside the camera or lens. Changing 
lenses on a sandy beach, for example, isn’t a good idea. For added safety, point 
the camera body slightly down when performing this maneuver; doing so helps 
prevent any flotsam in the air from being drawn into the camera by gravity.

12
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Removing a lens
To detach a lens from the camera body, take these steps:
 
1. Locate the lens-release button, 
labeled in Figure 1-2.
 
2. Grip the rear collar of the lens.
 
 In other words, hold on to the 
stationary part of the lens that’s 
closest to the camera body and 
not the movable focusing ring or 
zoom ring, if your lens has one.
 
3. Press the lens-release button 
while turning the lens clock-
wise until the mounting index 
on the lens is aligned with the 
index on the camera body.
 
 The mounting indexes are 
the little guide dots labeled in 
Figure 1-1. When the dots line 
up, the lens should detach from 
the mount. 
 
4. Place the rear protective cap 
onto the back of the lens.
 
 If you aren’t putting another lens on the camera, cover the lens mount 
with the protective cap that came with your camera, too.
Using a VR (vibration reduction) lens
If you purchased the D90 camera kit — that is, the body-and-lens combination 
put together by Nikon — your lens offers a feature called vibration reduction. 
On Nikon lenses, this feature is indicated by the initials VR in the lens name.
Vibration reduction attempts to compensate for small amounts of camera 
shake that are common when photographers handhold their cameras and 
use a slow shutter speed, a lens with a long focal length, or both. That 
camera movement during the exposure can produce blurry images. Although 
vibration reduction can’t work miracles, it does enable most people to cap-
ture sharper handheld shots in many situations than they otherwise could.
 
However, when you use a tripod, vibration reduction can have detrimental 
effects because the system may try to adjust for movement that isn’t actually 
occurring. That’s why your kit lens — and all Nikon VR lenses — have an On/Off 
switch, which is located on the side of the lens, as shown in Figure 1-2. Whether 
you should turn off the VR feature, though, depends on the specific lens, so 
Vibration Reduction switch

13
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
check the manual. For the 18–105 kit lens, Nikon does recommend setting 
the switch to the Off position for tripod shooting, assuming that the tripod is 
“locked down” so the camera is immovable.
If you use a non-Nikon lens, the vibration reduction feature may go by 
another name: image stabilization, optical stabilization, anti-shake, vibration 
compensation, and so on. In some cases, the manufacturers may recommend 
that you leave the system turned on or select a special setting when you use 
a tripod, so be sure to check the lens manual for information.
Chapter 6 offers more tips on achieving blur-free photos, and it also explains 
focal length and its impact on your pictures. See Chapter 5 for an explanation 
of shutter speed.
Setting the focus mode (auto or manual)
Your camera can accept a variety of lenses, but only two types of lenses 
permit you to take advantage of autofocusing: AF lenses and AF-S lenses. 
(The 18–105mm kit lens falls into the AF-S category.)
 
The AF stands for autofocus, as you may have guessed. The S stands for silent 
wave, a Nikon autofocus technology.
For times when you attach a lens that doesn’t support autofocusing or the 
autofocus system has trouble locking on your subject, you can focus manu-
ally by simply twisting a focusing ring on the lens barrel. The placement and 
appearance of the focusing ring depends on the lens; Figure 1-3 shows you 
the one on the kit lens.
Take these steps to try out manual focusing: 
 
1. Set the camera to manual focus mode.
 
 The procedure depends on the type of lens, as follows:
 
• AF-S lenses: Set the switch on the lens itself to M, as shown in 
Figure 1-3. Note that the figure shows the switch as it appears on 
the D90’s kit lens; if you use a different lens, check the lens instruc-
tion manual if you have trouble finding the switch. (It may carry 
the label AF/MF instead of A/M.)
 
• AF lenses: For this type of lens, two switches are involved. First, set 
the lens switch to M, as just described. Then look for the AF-M switch 
on the camera body — it’s located just below the lens-release button, 
as labeled in Figure 1-3. Flip the switch to M for manual focusing.
 
• All other lenses: Set the switch on the camera body to M.
 
2. While looking through the viewfinder, twist the focusing ring to 
adjust focus.

14
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 If you have trouble focusing, you may be too close to your subject; every 
lens has a minimum focusing distance. You may also need to adjust the 
viewfinder to accommodate your eyesight; see the next section for details.
 
Some lenses, including the D90 kit lens, enable you to use autofocusing to 
set the initial focusing point and then fine-tune focus manually. Check your 
lens manual for information on how to use this option, if available. With the 
kit lens, you set the lens switch to the A position and then press the shutter 
button halfway to autofocus. Then you simply twist the foscuing ring to adjust 
focus further, if needed.
Zooming in and out
If you bought a zoom lens, it has a movable zoom barrel. The location of the 
soom barrel on the D90 kit lens is show in Figure 1-3. To zoom in or out, just 
move that zoom barrel forward and backward.
The numbers on the zoom ring, by the way, represent focal lengths. I explain 
focal lengths in Chapter 6. In the meantime, just note that when the lens is 
mounted on the camera, the number that’s aligned with the lens mounting 
index (the white dot) represents the current focal length. In Figure 1-3, for 
example, the focal length is 35mm.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Adjusting the Viewfinder Focus
Tucked behind the right side of the rubber eyepiece that surrounds the 
viewfinder is a tiny dial called a diopter adjustment control. With this control, 
labeled in Figure 1-4, you can adjust the focus of your viewfinder to accom-
modate your eyesight.
 
Diopter adjustment control
Focus point
 
Figure 1-4: Use the diopter adjustment control to set the viewfinder focus for your eyesight.
 
If you don’t take this step, scenes that appear out of focus through the view-
finder may actually be sharply focused through the lens, and vice versa. 
Here’s how to make the necessary adjustment:
 
1. Remove the lens cap from the front of the lens.
 
2. Look through the viewfinder and concentrate on the little black mark-
ings shown on the right side of Figure 1-4.
 
 The little rectangles represent the camera’s autofocusing points, which 
you can read more about in Chapters 2 and 6. The four curved lines rep-
resent the center-weighted metering area, which relates to an exposure 
option you can explore in Chapter 5.
 
3. Rotate the diopter adjustment dial until the viewfinder markings 
appear to be in focus.
 
 The Nikon manual warns you not to poke yourself in the eye as you per-
form this maneuver. This warning seems so obvious that I laugh every 
time I read it — which makes me feel doubly stupid the next time I poke 
myself in the eye as I perform this maneuver.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Working with Memory Cards
Instead of recording images on film, 
digital cameras store pictures on 
memory cards. Your D90 uses a 
specific type of memory card 
called an SD card (for Secure Digital), 
shown in Figures 1-5 and 1-7. You 
can also use the new, high-capacity 
Secure Digital cards, which are 
labeled SDHC, as well as Eye-Fi SD 
cards, which enable you to send 
pictures to your computer over 
a wireless network. (Because of 
space limitations, I don’t cover 
Eye-Fi connectivity in this book; if 
you want more information about 
these cards, you can find it online 
at www.eye.fi.)
Memory card access light
Figure 1-5: Insert the card with the label facing 
the camera back.
Do you need high-speed memory cards?
Memory cards are categorized not just by 
their storage capacity, but also by their data-
transfer speed. SD cards (the type used by 
your D90) fall into one of three speed classes, 
Class 2, Class 4, and Class 6, with the number 
indicating the minimum number of megabytes 
(units of computer data) that can be transferred 
per second. A Class 2 card, for example, has a 
minimum transfer speed of 2 megabytes, or MB, 
per second. Of course, with the speed increase 
comes a price increase. 
Photographers who shoot action benefit most 
from high-speed cards — the faster data-
transfer rate helps the camera record shots at its 
maximum speed. Users who shoot at the high-
est resolution or prefer the NEF (Raw) file format 
also gain from high-speed cards; both options 
increase file size and, thus, the time needed to 
store the picture on the card. (See Chapter 3 for 
details.) As for picture downloading, how long it 
takes for files to shuffle from card to computer 
depends not just on card speed, but also on the 
capabilities of your computer and, if you use a 
memory card reader to download files, on the 
speed of that device. (Chapter 8 covers the file-
downloading process.)
Long story short, if you want to push your camera 
to its performance limits, a high-speed card is 
worth considering, assuming budget is no issue. 
Otherwise, even a Class 2 card should be more 
than adequate for most photographers.

17
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Safeguarding your memory cards — and the images you store on them — 
requires just a few precautions:
 
✓ Inserting a card: First, be sure that the camera is turned off. Then put 
the card in the card slot with the label facing the back of the camera, as 
shown in Figure 1-5. Push the card into the slot until it clicks into place; 
the memory card access light (circled in Figure 1-5) blinks for a second 
to let you know the card is inserted properly.
 
✓ Formatting a card: The first time you use a new memory card or insert 
a card that has been used in other devices (such as an MP3 player), you 
should format it. Formatting ensures that the card is properly prepared 
to record your pictures.
 
 Formatting erases everything on your memory card. So before format-
ting, be sure that you have copied any pictures or other data to your 
computer.
 
 You can format a card in two ways:
 
 
 
• Simultaneously press and 
hold the Delete and Metering 
Mode buttons. See the little 
red Format labels next to the 
buttons? They’re reminders 
that you use these buttons 
to quickly format a memory 
card. Hold the buttons down 
for about two seconds, until 
you see the letters For blink 
in the Control panel on top 
of the camera, as shown in 
Figure 1-6. The other data 
visible is the Shots 
Remaining value, which indi-
cates how many pictures 
you can fit on the memory 
card at the current Image Quality and Image Size settings — 290, in 
the figure.
 
 While the display is blinking, press and release both buttons again. 
When formatting is complete, the For message disappears, and the 
Control panel display returns to normal. (See the upcoming section 
“Monitoring Shooting Settings” for more about the Control panel.)
 
• Choose the Format command from the Setup menu. The upcoming 
section “Ordering from Camera Menus” explains how to work with 
menus. When you select the command, you’re asked to confirm 
your decision to format the card. Highlight Yes and press the OK 
button to go forward.

Figure 1-6: To format a memory card, press 
the Delete and Metering Mode buttons until 
you see this message in the Control panel; 
then press both buttons again.

18
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 If you insert a memory card and see the letters For in the Shots 
Remaining area of the Control panel, you must format the card before 
you can do anything else.
 
✓ Removing a card: After making sure that the memory card access light 
is off, indicating that the camera has finished recording your most 
recent photo, turn the camera off. Open the memory card door, as 
shown in Figure 1-5. Depress the memory card slightly until you hear a 
little click and then let go. The card should pop halfway out of the slot, 
enabling you to grab it by the tail and remove it.
 
 When no card is installed in the camera, the symbol [-E-] appears in the 
Control panel and viewfinder.
 
✓ Handling cards: Don’t touch 
the gold contacts on the back 
of the card. (See the left card in 
Figure 1-7.) When cards aren’t 
in use, store them in the protec-
tive cases they came in or in a 
memory card wallet. Keep cards 
away from extreme heat and 
cold as well.
 
✓ Locking cards: The tiny switch 
on the left side of the card, 
labeled lock switch in Figure 1-7, 
enables you to lock your card, 
which prevents any data from 
being erased or recorded to the 
card. Press the switch toward the 
bottom of the card to lock the 
card contents; press it toward 
the top of the card to unlock 
the data.
 
 You can protect individual images from accidental erasure by using the 
camera’s Protect feature, which is covered in Chapter 4.
Exploring External Camera Controls
Scattered across your camera’s exterior are a number of buttons, dials, and 
switches that you use to change picture-taking settings, review and edit your 
photos, and perform various other operations. In later chapters, I discuss 
all your camera’s functions in detail and provide the exact steps to follow to 
access them. This section provides just a basic road map to the external 
controls plus a quick introduction to each.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
One note before you move on: Many of the buttons perform multiple functions 
and so have multiple “official” names. The WB (white balance) button, for exam-
ple, is also known as the Help button and the Protect button. In the camera 
manual, Nikon’s instructions refer to these multi-tasking buttons by the name 
that’s relevant for the current function. I think that’s a little confusing, so I 
always refer to each button by the first moniker you see in the lists here.
Topside controls
Your virtual tour begins with the bird’s-eye view shown in Figure 1-8. There 
are a number of controls of note here:

✓ Control panel: On the D90, you can view basic camera settings on this 
topside LCD panel or on the main monitor. See the upcoming section 
“Monitoring Shooting Settings” for more info.
 
✓ On/Off/Illuminate switch and shutter button: Okay, I’m pretty sure 
you already figured this combo button out. But check out Chapter 2 to 
discover the proper shutter-button-pressing technique — you’d be sur-
prised how many people mess up their pictures because they press that 
button incorrectly. And note that if you want to illuminate the Control 
panel, you just rotate the On/Off switch past the On position to the little 
light-bulb icon. Release the switch to return to shooting; the Control 
panel will dim to its normal state after a few seconds.

20
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 
✓ Metering Mode button: Press this button to select an exposure metering 
mode, which determines what part of the frame the camera considers 
when calculating exposure. Chapter 5 has details. 
 
 The little red Format label above the button reminds you that you can 
press this button together with the Delete button — which also sports 
the label — to quickly format a memory card. See the earlier section 
“Working with Memory Cards” for details.
 
 
✓ Exposure Compensation button: This button activates a feature that 
enables you to tweak exposure when working in three of your camera’s 
autoexposure modes: programmed autoexposure, aperture-priority 
autoexposure, and shutter-priority autoexposure, represented by the 
letters P, S, and A on the camera Mode dial. Chapter 5 explains.
 
 
✓ Release Mode button: With this button, you can switch from normal 
shooting, where you take one picture with each press of the shutter 
button, to one of the camera’s other modes, including Self-Timer mode. 
See the end of Chapter 2 for a look at all your options. 
 
 
✓ AF Mode/Reset button: Press this button to access the Autofocus mode 
setting, which affects your camera’s autofocus performance. Check out 
Chapter 6 for an explanation of the available modes.
 
 See the little green dot above this button and the Exposure 
Compensation button? The dots are a reminder that pressing these two 
buttons simultaneously for more than two seconds restores the most 
critical picture-taking options to their default settings. See “Restoring 
default settings,” at the end of this chapter, for more on this topic.
 
✓ Mode dial: With this dial, labeled in Figure 1-8, you set the camera to 
fully automatic, semi-automatic, or manual photography mode. The little 
pictographs, or icons, represent the Nikon Digital Vari-Program modes, 
which are automatic settings geared to specific types of photos: action 
shots, portraits, landscapes, and so on. Chapter 2 details the Digital 
Vari-Program and Auto modes; Chapter 5 explains the four others (P, S, 
A, and M).
Back-of-the-body controls
Traveling over the top of the camera to its back side, shown in Figure 1-9, you 
encounter the following controls:
 
✓ Main command dial: After you activate certain camera features, you 
rotate this dial, labeled in Figure 1-9, to select a specific setting. For exam-
ple, to choose a White Balance setting, you press the WB button as you 
rotate the main command dial. (Chapter 6 explains white balancing.)

21

AE-L
AF-L
 
✓ AE-L/AF-L button: When you’re taking pictures in some automatic 
modes, you can lock in your focus and exposure settings by pressing 
and holding this button. Chapter 5 explains why you may want to do so.
 
 You can adjust the performance of the button as it relates to locking focus 
and exposure, too. Instructions in this book assume that you stick with the 
default setting, but if you want to explore your options, see Chapter 11.
 
 
✓ Lv (Live View) button: You press this button as the first step in record-
ing a movie or taking advantage of Live View shooting, in which you can 
use the monitor to compose your shots. Chapter 4 introduces you to 
both Live View features.
 
✓ Multi Selector/OK button: This dual-natured control, labeled in Figure 
1-9, plays a role in many camera functions. You press the outer edges 
of the Multi Selector left, right, up, or down to navigate camera menus 
and access certain other options. At the center of the control is the OK 
button, which you press to finalize a menu selection or other camera 
adjustment. See the next section for help with using the camera menus.

✓ Focus Selector Lock switch: Just beneath the Multi Selector, this switch 
relates to the camera’s autofocusing system. When the switch is set to 
the position shown in Figure 1-9, you can use the Multi Selector to tell 
the camera to base focus on a specific focusing point. Setting the switch 
to the L position locks in the selected point. See Chapter 6 for details on 
all this focusing stuff.
 
 
✓ Info button: In addition to viewing current camera settings on the 
Control panel, you can press this button to display the Shooting 
Information screen on the camera monitor. The screen not only gives 
you an easier-on-the-eyes view of the camera settings but also enables 
you to adjust some settings more quickly than by using the camera 
menus. See the upcoming section “Monitoring Shooting Settings” for 
details. 
 
 
✓ Delete button: Sporting a trash can icon, the universal symbol for 
delete, this button enables you to erase pictures from your memory 
card. Chapter 4 has specifics.
 
 
✓ Playback button: Press this button to switch the camera into picture 
review mode. Chapter 4 details the features available to you in this 
mode.
 
MENU
 
✓ Menu button: Press this button to access menus of camera options. See 
the next section for details on navigating menus.
 
 
✓ WB/Help/Protect button: This button serves several purposes:
 
• White balance control: For picture-taking purposes, the button’s 
main function is to access white balance options, a topic you can 
explore in Chapter 6.
 
• Help: You also can press this button to display helpful information 
about certain menu options. See “Asking Your Camera for Help,” 
later in this chapter, for details.
 
• Protect: In playback mode, pressing the button locks the picture 
file — hence the little key symbol that appears on the button face — 
so that it isn’t erased if you use the picture-delete functions. (The pic-
ture is erased if you format the memory card, however.) See Chapter 
4 for details.
 
 
✓ ISO/Playback Zoom Out/Thumbnail button: In picture-taking mode, 
pressing this button accesses the ISO setting, which controls the cam-
era’s sensitivity to light. Chapter 5 has details. 

23
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
 In playback mode, pressing the button enables you display multiple 
image thumbnails on the screen and to reduce the magnification of the 
currently displayed photo. See Chapter 4 for a complete rundown of 
picture playback options.
 
 
✓ Qual (Quality)/Playback Zoom In button: In playback mode, pressing 
this button magnifies the currently displayed image and also reduces 
the number of thumbnails displayed at a time. Note the plus sign in the 
middle of the magnifying glass — plus for zoom in.
 
 In picture-taking mode, pressing the button gives you fast access to the 
Image Quality and Image Size options, both of which you can explore in 
Chapter 3.
 
As for the monitor, I show it in this book without its protective plastic cover. 
But when the camera isn’t in use, it’s a good idea to keep the cover on to 
protect the screen from scratches and other damage. 
Front-left buttons
On the front-left side of the camera 
body, shown in Figure 1-10, you find 
the following controls:
 
 
✓ Flash/Flash compensation: 
Pressing this button pops up 
the camera’s built-in flash 
(except in automatic shooting 
modes, in which the camera 
decides whether the flash is 
needed). By holding the button 
down and rotating the main 
command dial, you can adjust 
the flash mode (normal, red-eye 
reduction, and so on). In 
advanced exposure modes (P, S, 
A, and M), you also can adjust 
the flash power by pressing the 
button and rotating the sub-
command dial. (That’s the dial 
just below the shutter button.) 
See Chapter 5 for all things flash 
related.

✓ BKT (Bracket) button: This button is key to enabling automatic bracket-
ing, a feature that simplifies the job of recording the same subject at var-
ious exposure, flash, and white balance settings. Chapter 5 details flash 
and exposure bracketing; Chapter 6 discusses white balancing.
 
✓ Lens-release button: You press this button before removing the lens 
from your camera. See the first part of this chapter for help with mount-
ing and removing lenses.
 
✓ AF/M (autofocus/manual) switch: This switch comes into play if you use 
certain types of lenses. See the earlier section “Setting the focus mode (auto 
or manual)” for the short story; see Chapter 6 for help with autofocus.
Make note, too, of the tiny microphone perched just above the D90 label. Be 
careful not to obscure the microphone with your finger when you’re record-
ing a movie, a subject you can explore in Chapter 4.
Front-right controls
Wrapping up the list of external controls, the front-right side of the camera 
offers the following features. Figure 1-11 shows this part of the camera with-
out a lens attached to make this foursome easier to see.
 
✓ Sub-command dial: This dial is the counterpart to the main command 
dial on the back of the camera. As with the main dial, you rotate this one 
to select certain settings, usually in conjunction with pressing another 
button.
 
✓ AF-assist lamp: In dim lighting, a beam of light shoots out from this little 
lamp to help the camera’s autofocus system find its target. In general, 
leaving the AF-assist option enabled is a good idea, but if you’re doing a 
lot of shooting at a party, wedding, or some event where the light from 
the lamp may be distracting, you can disable it through an option on 
the Custom Setting menu. Chapter 6 explains this and other autofocus 
features.
 
✓ Function button: By default, this button locks the flash exposure value 
when pressed. (See Chapter 5 for details on this flash feature.) But if you 
don’t use that feature often, you can use the button to perform one of 
nine other operations. Chapter 11 provides the details on changing the 
button’s purpose. (Note: All instructions in this book assume that you 
haven’t changed the function, however.)
 
✓ Depth-of-Field Preview button: By pressing this button, you can see 
how different aperture settings affect depth of field, or the zone of sharp 
focus in your image. Chapter 5 explains aperture settings and Chapter 6 
delves into depth of field.

 You access many of your camera’s features via internal menus, which, conve-
niently enough, appear when you press the Menu button. Features are 
grouped into six main menus, described briefly in Table 1-1.

After you press the Menu button, 
you see on the camera monitor a 
screen similar to the one shown in 
Figure 1-12. Along the left side of the 
screen, you see the icons shown in 
Table 1-1, each representing one of 
the available menus. The icon that 
is highlighted or appears in color 
is the active menu; options on that 
menu automatically appear to the 
right of the column of icons. In the 
figure, the Shooting menu is active, 
for example.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
I explain all the important menu options elsewhere in the book; for now, 
just familiarize yourself with the process of navigating menus and selecting 
options therein. The Multi Selector, shown in Figure 1-9, is the key to the 
game. You press the edges of the Multi Selector to navigate up, down, left, 
and right through the menus.
 
In this book, the instruction “Press the Multi Selector left” simply means to 
press the left edge of the control. “Press the Multi Selector right” means to 
press the right edge, and so on.
Here’s a bit more detail about the process of navigating menus:
 
✓ To select a different menu: Press the Multi Selector left to jump to the 
column containing the menu icons. Then press up or down to highlight 
the menu you want to display. Finally, press right to jump over to the 
options on the menu. 
 
✓ To select and adjust a function on the current menu: Again, use the Multi 
Selector to scroll up or down the list of options to highlight the feature 
you want to adjust and then press OK. Settings available for the selected 
item then appear. For example, if you select the Image Quality item from 
the Shooting menu, as shown on the left in Figure 1-13, and press OK, 
the available Image Quality options appear, as shown on the right in the 
figure. Repeat the old up-and-down scroll routine until the choice you 
prefer is highlighted. Then press OK to return to the previous screen.
 
 In some cases, you may see a right-pointing arrowhead instead of the 
OK symbol next to an option. That’s your cue to press the Multi Selector 
right to display a submenu or other list of options.

✓ To quickly access your 20 most 
recent menu items or create a 
custom menu: The sixth menu is 
actually two menus bundled into 
one. The Recent Settings menu, 
shown in Figure 1-14, provides a 
list of the 20 menu items you 
ordered most recently. So if you 
want to adjust those settings, you 
don’t have to wade through all the 
other menus looking for them — 
just head to this menu instead.
 
 Through the Choose Tab option 
at the bottom of the menu, you 
can switch to the My Menu 
screen. From there, you can 
create your own custom menu that contains your favorite options. 
Chapter 11 details the steps involved in making and using your menu. 
The My Menu screen also contains a Choose Tab option so that you can 
switch back to the Recent Settings menu at any time.
 
 The menu icon changes depending on which of these two functions is 
active; Table 1-1 shows both icons.
Monitoring Shooting Settings 
Your D90 gives you the following three ways to monitor the most critical 
picture-taking settings.
 
✓ Control panel: The LCD panel on top of the camera offers an array of 
shooting data, as shown on the left in Figure 1-15. Remember that you 
can illuminate the panel temporarily by rotating the On/Off switch past 
the On position to the little light bulb marker, shown on the right in the 
figure, and then releasing the switch. (You also can turn on the illumina-
tion for a longer period of time; see the upcoming section “Customizing 
shooting and display options” for details.)
 
 
✓ Shooting Info display: If your eyesight is like mine, making out the tiny 
type on the Control panel can be difficult. Fortunately, you can press the 
Info button to display the Shooting Information screen on the monitor. 
Figure 1-14: The Recent Settings menu offers 
quick access to the last 20 menu options you 
selected.

29
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
As shown in Figure 1-16, this screen displays the current shooting set-
tings at a size that’s a little easier on the eyes. Depending on the ambient 
light, the display either shows black text on a light background, as 
shown here, or white on black. See the section “Customizing shooting 
and display options” for information on how to adjust the display if you 
prefer one color scheme over the other.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 By pressing the Info button again, 
you switch the display to Quick 
Settings mode. In this mode, you 
can access additional camera set-
tings, represented by the icons at 
the bottom of the screen. Press 
the Multi Selector left or right to 
highlight the icon for the setting 
you want to adjust — a little 
label appears to tell you what 
each icon means, as shown in 
Figure 1-17. Press OK to jump 
directly to the menu where 
you can change the setting. 
 
✓ Viewfinder: You can view 
some camera settings in the 
viewfinder as well. For example, 
the data in Figure 1-18 shows 
the current shutter speed, 
f-stop, ISO setting, and number 
of shots remaining. The exact 
viewfinder information that 
appears depends on what action 
you’re currently undertaking. 
If what you see in Figures 1-15 through 
1-18 looks like a big confusing mess, 
don’t worry. Many of the settings 
relate to options that won’t mean any-
thing to you until you make your way 
through later chapters and explore the 
advanced exposure modes. But do make note of the following two key points of 
data that are helpful even when you shoot in the fully automatic modes:
 
✓ Battery status indicator: A full battery icon like the one in Figures 1-15 
and 1-16 shows that the battery is fully charged; if the icon appears 
empty, go look for your battery charger.
 
✓ Pictures remaining: Labeled in Figures 1-15 and 1-16 and also visible in 
the viewfinder in Figure 1-18, this value (276, in the figures) indicates 
how many additional pictures you can store on the current memory 
card. If the number exceeds 999, the value is presented a little differ-
ently. The initial K appears above the value to indicate that the first 
value represents the picture count in thousands. For example, 1.0 K 
means that you can store 1,000 more pictures (K being a universally 
accepted symbol indicating 1,000 units). The number is then rounded 
down to the nearest hundred. So if the card has room for, say, 1,230 
more pictures, the value reads as 1.2K. 
Figure 1-17: Press the Info button twice to 
access more options via the Quick Settings 
display.
Figure 1-18: You also can view some camera 
information at the bottom of the viewfinder.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Asking Your Camera for Help
 
Programmed into your camera’s internal software is a handy information 
help line — a great tool for times when you forget the purpose of a particular 
feature or would like a little picture-taking guidance. This digital 411 offers 
assistance in several ways: 
 
 
✓ If you see a small question mark 
in the lower-left corner of a menu, 
press and hold the WB button to 
display information about the 
current shooting mode or 
selected menu option. For exam-
ple, Figure 1-19 shows the Help 
screen associated with the 
Picture Control setting. If you 
need to scroll the screen to view 
all the Help text, keep the button 
depressed and scroll by using the 
Multi Selector. Release the button 
to close the information screen.
 
✓ Little tip flags appear on the 
Shooting Information display 
when you access certain options. (Refer to Figure 1-17.) If you don’t 
want to see the tips, you can turn them off via the Custom Setting menu, 
as explained later in this chapter.
Reviewing Basic Setup Options
Your camera offers scads of options for customizing its performance. Later 
chapters explain settings related to actual picture taking, such as those 
that affect flash behavior and autofocusing. The rest of this chapter details 
options related to initial camera setup, such as setting the date and time, 
adjusting monitor brightness, and the like.
Cruising the Setup menu
Start your camera customization by opening the Setup menu. It’s the menu 
marked with the little wrench icon, as shown on the left in Figure 1-20. Scroll 
down the menu using the Multi Selector to display the second screen of the 
menu, shown on the right.
Figure 1-19: Press and hold the WB button to 
display onscreen help.

32
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 
Figure 1-20: Visit the Setup menu to start customizing your camera.
Here’s a quick rundown of each menu item:
 
✓ Format Memory Card: You can use this command to format your 
memory card, which wipes all data off the card and ensures that it’s 
properly set up to record pictures. Or, for quicker results, you can 
use the two-button formatting process outlined in the earlier section, 
“Working with Memory Cards.” 
 
✓ LCD Brightness: This option enables you to make the camera monitor 
brighter or darker. If you take this step, keep in mind that what you see 
on the display may not be an accurate rendition of the actual exposure 
of your image. Crank up the monitor brightness, for example, and an 
underexposed photo may look just fine. So I recommend that you keep 
the brightness at the default setting (0). As an alternative, you can dis-
play the histogram, an exposure guide that I explain in Chapter 4, when 
reviewing your images.
 
✓ Clean Image Sensor: Your D90 is set up at the factory to perform an 
internal cleaning routine each time you turn the camera on or off. This 
cleaning system is designed to keep the image sensor — that’s the part 
of the camera that actually captures the image — free of dust and dirt.
 
 By choosing the Clean Image Sensor command, you can perform a cleaning 
at any time, however. Just choose the command, press OK, select Clean 
Now, and press OK again. You also can tell the camera to perform auto-
matic cleaning only at startup, only at shutdown, or never; to do so, select 
Clean At Startup/Shutdown instead of Clean Now. Then press the Multi 
Selector right, highlight the cleaning option you prefer, and press OK.
 
✓ Lock Mirror Up for Cleaning: This feature is necessary when cleaning 
the camera interior — an operation that I don’t recommend that you 
tackle yourself because you can easily damage the camera if you don’t 
know what you’re doing. And if you’ve used mirror lock-up on a film 

33
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
camera to avoid camera shake when shooting long-exposure images, 
note that in this case, the lock-up feature is provided for cleaning pur-
poses only. You can’t take pictures on the D90 while the mirror lock-up 
is engaged.
 
✓ Video Mode: This option is related to viewing your images on a tele-
vision, a topic I cover in Chapter 9. Select NTSC if you live in North 
America or other countries that adhere to the NTSC video standard; 
select PAL for playback in areas that follow that code of video conduct.
 
✓ HDMI: See Chapter 9 for information about this setting, which relates to 
options involved with connecting your camera to an HDMI device.
 
✓ World Time: When you turn on your camera for the very first time, it 
automatically displays this option and asks you to set the current date 
and time. Keeping the date/time accurate is important because that 
information is recorded as part of the image file. In your photo browser, 
you can then see when you shot an image and, equally handy, search for 
images by the date they were taken.
 
 Also, if you see the message “Clock” blinking in the Control panel, the 
internal battery that keeps the clock running is depleted. Simply charg-
ing the main camera battery and then putting that battery back in the 
camera sets the clock ticking again, but you need to reset the camera 
time and date.
 
✓ Language: You’re asked to specify a language along with the date and 
time when you fire up your camera for the first time. Your choice deter-
mines the language of text on the camera monitor. Screens in this book 
display the English language, but I find it entertaining on occasion to 
hand my camera to a friend after changing the language to, say, Swedish. 
I’m a real yokester, yah?
 
✓ Image Comment: See Chapter 11 to find out how to use this feature, 
which enables you to add text comments into a picture file. You then 
can read that information in Nikon ViewNX, the software that shipped 
with your camera. (The text doesn’t actually appear on the image itself.)
 
✓ Auto Image Rotation: Keep this option set at the default setting (On) so 
that the image is automatically rotated to the correct orientation (hori-
zontal or vertical) in playback mode. The orientation is recorded as part 
of the image file, too, so the auto-rotating also occurs when you browse 
your image thumbnails in ViewNX. Note: The rotation data may not be 
accurate for pictures that you take with the camera pointing directly up 
or down. See Chapter 4 for more about picture playback.
 
✓ Image Dust Off Ref Photo: This specialty feature enables you to record 
an image that serves as a point of reference for the automatic dust-
removal filter available in Nikon Capture NX 2. I don’t cover this acces-
sory software, which must be purchased separately, in this book.

34
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Battery Info: Select this option 
to view detailed information 
about your battery, as shown in 
Figure 1-21. The Bat Meter data 
shows you the current power 
remaining as a percentage value, 
and the Pic Meter value tells you 
how many times you’ve pressed 
and released the shutter button 
since the last time you charged 
the battery. The final readout, 
Battery Age, lets you know how 
much more life you can expect 
out of the battery before it can no 
longer be recharged. When the 
display gets toward the right end 
of the little meter, marked with the number 4, it’s time to buy a new 
battery.
 
✓ GPS: If you purchase the optional Nikon GPS tracking unit for your 
camera, this menu item holds settings related to its operation. This book 
doesn’t cover this accessory, but the manual that comes with the unit 
explains everything you need to know about using it.
 
✓ Eye-Fi upload: Your camera can work with some Eye-Fi memory cards, 
which enable you to send your pictures over a wireless network to your 
computer. If you do put one of the cards in the camera, this menu option 
contains settings for making the transfer.
 
 Unfortunately, Eye-Fi cards are significantly more expensive than regu-
lar cards — about $80 for a 2MB card. But if you do use the cards and 
you find yourself in a situation where wireless devices are not allowed, 
choose Disable from the Eye-Fi upload menu to shut off the signal. For 
the whole story on Eye-Fi, including help with setting up your wireless 
transfers, visit the company’s Web site at www.eye.fi.
 
✓ Firmware Version: Select this option and press OK to view what version 
of the camera firmware, or internal software, your camera is running. 
You see three separate firmware items, A, B, and L. At the time this book 
was written, all three items were in version 1.0.0.
 
 Keeping your camera firmware up-to-date is important, so visit the 
Nikon Web site (www.nikon.com) regularly to find out whether your 
camera sports the latest version. You can find detailed instructions on 
how to download and install any firmware updates on the site.
Figure 1-21: You can check the health of your 
battery via the Battery Info menu item.

Browsing the Custom 
Setting menu
Displaying the Custom Setting menu, 
whose icon is a little pencil, takes you 
to the screen shown in Figure 1-22. 
Here you can access six submenus 
that carry the labels A through F. 
Each of the submenus holds clusters 
of options related to a specific 
aspect of the camera’s operation. 
Highlight a submenu and press OK 
to get to those actions, as shown in 
Figure 1-23.
 
 
Figure 1-23: Highlight a submenu and press OK again to access the available settings.
In the Nikon manual, instructions sometimes reference these settings by a 
menu letter and number. For example, “Custom Setting a1” refers to the first 
option on the Autofocus submenu. I try to be more specific in this book, how-
ever, so I use the actual setting names. (Really, we’ve all got enough numbers 
to remember, don’t you think?)
With that clarification out of the way, the following sections describe only the 
customization options related to basic camera operations. Turn to the index 
for help locating information about other Custom Setting options.
Figure 1-22: The Custom Setting menu 
contains six submenus (A through F).

36
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Adjusting automatic monitor shutdown
To help save battery power, your camera automatically shuts off the monitor 
after a period of inactivity. You can specify how long you want the camera 
to wait before taking that step. Open the Custom Setting menu, choose 
Timers/AE Lock, and press OK. Then highlight Monitor Off Delay, as shown 
on the left in Figure 1-24, and press OK to display the second screen in the 
figure, where you can specify the auto-off timing for picture playback, menu 
displays, and the Shooting Information display. Additionally, you can adjust 
the length of time the camera displays a picture immediately after you press 
the shutter button, known as the Image Review period. Chapter 4 talks more 
about viewing your photos.
 
 
Figure 1-24: Visit the Timers/AE Lock submenu to adjust the timing of automatic monitor 
 
shut-off.
Customizing shooting and display options
Visit the Shooting/Display submenu (refer to Figure 1-23) to tweak various 
aspects of how the camera communicates with you, as well as to control a 
couple of basic shooting functions. Check out the following options: 
 
✓ Beep: By default, your camera beeps at you after certain operations, 
such as after it sets focus when you shoot in autofocus mode. If you’re 
doing top-secret surveillance work and need the camera to hush up, set 
this option to Off. On the Shooting Info and Control panel displays, a 
little musical note icon appears when the beep is enabled. Turn the beep 
off, and the icon appears in a circle with a slash through it.
 
✓ Viewfinder grid display: You can display tiny gridlines in the viewfinder 
by setting this option to On. The gridlines are a great help when you 
need to ensure the alignment of objects in your photo — for example, to 
make sure that the horizon is level in a landscape.

37
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ ISO Display and Adjustment: Normally, the frame count area of the 
Control panel and viewfinder indicate how many shots will fit in the 
remaining space on your memory card. But if you prefer, you can use 
this display space to instead show the current ISO setting. See Chapter 5 
for the complete story on this option.
 
✓ Viewfinder warning 
display: You can ask the 
camera to display the 
following extra symbols 
in the viewfinder, as illus-
trated in Figure 1-25:
 
• Black-and-white: Turn 
this option on to dis-
play a B/W symbol 
when you enable the 
Monochrome (black-
and-white) Picture 
Control. You can 
read about Picture 
Controls and other 
color options in Chapter 6.
 
• Low battery: If you turn on 
this option, a picture of a 
nearly empty battery appears when your camera battery is about 
to poop out.
 
• No memory card: This warning, when enabled, lets you know that 
you forgot to put a memory card in the camera. (You can also 
simply take a quick look at frames-remaining area of the viewfinder 
or Control panel; it displays the symbol [-E-] when the memory 
card slot is empty.)
 
✓ Screen Tips: If you don’t want to see the little help labels that appear 
when you select certain options in the Shooting Information display, turn 
this option off. For a look at what I’m talking about, revisit Figure 1-17.
 
✓ File Number Sequence: This option controls how the camera names your 
picture files. When the option is set to Off, as it is by default, the camera 
restarts file numbering at 0001 every time you format your memory card 
or insert a new memory card. Numbering is also restarted if you create 
custom folders (an advanced option covered in Chapter 11). 
 
 Needless to say, this setup can cause problems over time, creating a 
scenario where you wind up with multiple images that have the same 
filename — not on the current memory card, but when you download 
images to your computer. So I strongly encourage you to set the option 
to On. Note that when you get to picture number 9999, file numbering 
is still reset to 0001, however. The camera automatically creates a new 
folder to hold for your next 9999 images.
Black-and-white No memory card
Low battery
Figure 1-25: You can display a low-battery 
warning in the viewfinder.

38
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 As for the Reset option, it enables you to assign the first file number 
(which ends in 0001) to the next picture you shoot. Then the camera 
behaves as if you selected the On setting.
 
 Should you be a really, really prolific shooter and snap enough pictures 
to reach image 9999 in folder 999, the camera will refuse to take another 
photo until you choose that Reset option and either format the memory 
card or insert a brand new one.
 
✓ Shooting Information Display: Normally, the camera tries to make the 
data on the display easier to read by automatically shifting from black text 
on a light background to light text on a black background, depending on 
the ambient light. If you prefer one display style over the other, visit this 
menu item and highlight Manual, as shown on the left in Figure 1-26. Press 
OK to display the screen shown on the right, and then select either Dark 
on Light (for dark lettering on a light background) or Light on Dark (for 
light lettering on a dark background). Press OK again to make the change. 
If you want to go back to the default setting, select Auto from the first 
screen (shown on the left in the figure).
 
 In this book, I show the Shooting Information screen using the Dark on 
Light display because it reproduces better in print.
 
✓ LCD Illumination: This setting affects a backlight that can be turned 
on to illuminate the Control panel. When the option is set to Off, as it is 
by default, you can illuminate the panel briefly by rotating the On/Off 
switch past the On setting, to the little light bulb marking. The backlight 
turns off automatically a few seconds after you release the switch.
 
 If you instead set the LCD Illumination option to On, the backlight comes 
on automatically anytime the exposure meters are activated (which 
happens when you press the shutter button halfway). See Chapter 5 for 
more about the exposure meters. Be aware that this option consumes 
more battery power than simply using the On/Off switch to light up the 
panel when you really need it.
 
 
Figure 1-26: This book uses the Dark on Light option when showing the Shooting Information 
 
display.

39
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ Exposure Delay Mode: If you turn this option on, the camera waits to 
record your picture until about one second after you press and release 
the shutter button. What’s the point? Well, a tiny mirror inside the 
camera moves every time you press the shutter button to take a picture. 
For shots that require a long exposure time, there is a slight chance that 
the vibration caused by that mirror movement will blur the picture. So 
by delaying the actual image capture a little, the odds of that mirror-
related blur are lessened. For normal shooting, leave this one at its 
default setting, Off. And check out Chapter 2 for information on using 
the camera’s self-timer function as an alternative option when you want 
to delay the shutter release.
 
✓ Flash warning: When you shoot in the advanced exposure modes (P, S, 
A, and M), the camera displays a blinking flash symbol (a little lightning 
bolt) in the viewfinder if it thinks you need to use the flash. If this warn-
ing annoys you, set this option to Off.
 
✓ MB-D80 Battery Type: You don’t need to worry about this control 
unless you buy the optional MB-D80 battery adapter that enables you 
to power your camera with AA batteries. If you go that route, select this 
option to specify which type of AAs you’re using. And be sure to read 
the manual for a list of what AA batteries are acceptable, as well as some 
other details about using them.
Preventing shooting without a memory card
If you explore the Controls submenu of the Custom Setting menu, you find 
an option called No Memory Card. Keep this one set at the default (Release 
Locked), which disables the shutter button when no memory card is in the 
camera. If you set it to Enable Release, you can take a temporary picture, 
which appears in the monitor with the word “Demo” but isn’t recorded any-
where. (The feature is provided mainly for use in camera stores, enabling 
salespeople to demonstrate the camera without having to keep a memory 
card installed.)
The other options on this menu enable you to change the function of various 
buttons as well as the command and sub-command dials. Chapter 11 pro-
vides details, but while you’re working with this book, leave all these options 
at their default settings so that things operate as I describe.
Restoring default settings
You can quickly reset all the Custom Setting menu options to their original, 
factory default settings by choosing the Reset command at the top of the 
menu. (Refer to Figure 1-22). Press OK to display a confirmation screen that 
asks whether you really want to go forward with the reset; highlight Yes and 
press OK again.

40
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 
 To restore critical picture-taking settings without affecting options on the 
Custom Setting menu, you can instead use the so-called two-button reset 
method: Press and hold the Exposure Compensation button and the AF 
button simultaneously for longer than two seconds. (The little green dots 
near the buttons are a reminder of this function.)
 
One fly in the ointment to remember — and it’s a pretty big, ugly, hairy fly: 
After you restore the camera defaults, be sure that you also revisit the File 
Number Sequence option on the Shooting/Display submenu of the Custom 
Settings menu. The default setting, Off, is Not a Good Thing; turn the option 
On to avoid file-number confusion. See the earlier section “Customizing 
shooting and display options” for details. (You don’t have to take this step if 
you use the two-button reset method of restoring defaults.)

▶ Exploring self-timer and remote-control photography
A
re you old enough to remember the Certs television com-
mercials from the 1960s and ’70s? “It’s a candy mint!” 
declared one actor. “It’s a breath mint!” argued another. 
Then a narrator declared the debate a tie and spoke the 
famous catchphrase: “It’s two, two, two mints in one!”
Well, that’s sort of how I see the Nikon D90. On 
one hand, it provides a full range of powerful con-
trols, offering just about every feature a serious 
photographer could want. On the other, it offers 
automated photography modes that enable people 
with absolutely no experience to capture beautiful 
images. “It’s a sophisticated photographic tool!” “It’s 
as easy as ‘point and shoot’!” “It’s two, two, two cam-
eras in one!”
Now, my guess is that you bought this book for help with your 
camera’s advanced side, so that’s what other chapters cover. This 
chapter, however, is devoted to your camera’s simpler side. Because even 
when you shoot in automatic exposure and focus modes, following a few basic 
guidelines can help you get better results. For example, your camera offers a 
variety of automatic exposure modes, some of which may be new to you. The 
mode affects the look of your pictures, so this chapter explains those options. 

42
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
In addition, this chapter reviews flash options available to you in automatic 
modes and covers techniques that enable you to get the best performance 
from your camera’s autofocus and autoexposure systems.
Note that this chapter covers normal, through-the-viewfinder still photogra-
phy. For help with shooting in Live View mode, where you compose pictures 
using the monitor instead of the viewfinder, or shooting movies, visit the end 
of Chapter 4. 
Getting Good Point-and-Shoot Results
Your D90 offers several automatic photography modes, all of which I explain 
later in this chapter. But in any of those modes, the key to good photos is to 
follow a specific picture-taking technique.
 
 To try it out, set the Mode dial on top of the camera to Auto, as shown in the 
left image in Figure 2-1. Then set the focusing switch on the lens to the A 
(autofocus) position, as shown in the right image in Figure 2-1. The figure 
and these instructions assume that you’re using the kit lens — the Nikkor 
18–105mm AF-S lens bundled with the D90. For an AF lens, also set the body 
switch to the AF position, as shown in the figure. If you use some other lens, 
see Chapter 1 for information about autofocusing and manual focusing.

 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
Unless you are using a tripod, also set the VR (vibration reduction) switch to 
the On setting, as shown in Figure 2-1. This feature is designed to produce 
sharper images by compensating for camera movement that can occur when 
you handhold the camera. Again, Figure 2-1 features a Nikon VR lens; for 
other lenses, check your lens manual for details about using its vibration 
reduction feature, if provided.
Your camera is now set up to work in the most automatic of automatic 
modes. Follow these steps to take the picture: 
 
1. Looking through the viewfinder, 
frame the image so that your 
subject appears under one of the 
11 focusing points, as shown in 
Figure 2-2.
 
 The focusing points are those 
tiny rectangles you see clustered 
near the center of viewfinder. I 
labeled one of the little guys in 
the figure.
 
2. Press and hold the shutter 
button halfway down.
 
 The camera’s autofocus system 
begins to do its thing. In dim light, 
a little lamp located on the front 
of the camera, just to the left of 
the shutter button, may shoot out 
a beam of light. That lamp, called the autofocus-assist illuminator, helps the 
camera measure the distance between your subject and the lens so that it 
can better establish focus. 
 
 At the same time, the autoexposure meter analyzes the light and selects 
initial aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed settings, which are two criti-
cal exposure controls. These two settings appear in the viewfinder; 
in Figure 2-2, the shutter speed is 1/320 second, and the f-stop is f/5.6. 
(Chapter 5 explains these two options in detail.) The built-in flash may 
pop up if the camera thinks additional light is needed.
 
 When the camera has established focus, all the focus points briefly blink 
red, and one or more of the points appears red and surrounded by red 
brackets, as shown in Figure 2-3. The focusing points that are hugged by 
those rectangles represent the areas of the frame that are now in focus.

viewfinder indicate autofocus points.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
In the display at the bottom of 
the viewfinder, the green focus 
lamp, labeled in the figure, lights 
to give you further notice that 
focus has been achieved.
 
 The autoexposure meter contin-
ues monitoring the light up to the 
time you take the picture, so the 
f-stop and shutter speed values in 
the viewfinder may change if the 
light shifts.
 
3. Press the shutter button the rest 
of the way down to record the 
image.
 
 While the camera sends the image 
data to the camera memory card, 
the memory card access lamp 
lights, as shown in Figure 2-4. Don’t 
turn off the camera or remove the 
memory card while the lamp is lit, or you 
may damage both camera and card.
 
 When the recording process is finished, 
the picture appears briefly on the camera 
monitor. If the picture doesn’t appear 
or you want to take a longer look at the 
image, see Chapter 4 for help.
 
I need to add a few important points about 
working in the Auto mode and the other point-
and-shoot modes covered in this chapter: 
 
✓ Release mode options: The steps here 
assume that you are using the default 
Release mode, in which the camera 
records a single image with each press 
of the shutter button. For a look at other 
options — continuous (burst mode) 
shooting, self-timer shooting, and remote-
control shooting — see the section, 
“Changing the (Shutter Button) Release 
Mode,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Flash options: Whether you can use flash 
and which flash modes are available 
depends on the automatic exposure mode you use. See the next section 
for details.

45
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
✓ Autofocus options: You can choose to focus manually or take advan-
tage of autofocusing in any exposure mode. If you go the autofocus 
route, you can customize the behavior of the autofocus system through 
options discussed in Chapter 6. Instructions in this chapter assume that 
you stick with the default autofocus options. 
 
 But understand that in some cases, no amount of fiddling with the auto-
focus settings will help your camera lock focus where you intend. Some 
subjects just give autofocusing systems fits: Highly reflective objects, 
subjects behind fence bars, and scenes in which little contrast exists 
between the subject and the background are just a few potential prob-
lem areas.
 
 My advice? If the autofocus mechanism can’t lock on to your subject 
after a few seconds, just switch to manual focusing and be done with it. 
See Chapter 1 for a primer in manual focusing.
More focus factors to consider
When you focus the lens, either in autofocus or 
manual focus mode, you determine only the point 
of sharpest focus. The distance to which that 
sharp-focus zone extends from that point — what 
photographers call the depth of field — depends 
in part on the aperture setting, or f-stop, which 
is an exposure control. Some of the D90’s Digital 
Vari-Program autoexposure modes are designed 
to choose aperture settings that deliver a certain 
depth of field. 
The Portrait setting, for example, uses an aper-
ture setting that shortens the depth of field so 
that background objects are softly focused — an 
artistic choice that most people prefer for por-
traits. On the flip side of the coin, the Landscape 
setting selects an aperture that produces a large 
depth of field so that both foreground and back-
ground objects appear sharp.
Another exposure-related control, shutter 
speed, plays a focus role when you photograph 
moving objects. Moving objects appear blurry 
at slow shutter speeds; at fast shutter speeds, 
they appear sharply focused. On your D90, the 
camera chooses a fast shutter speed in Sports 
shooting mode. 
A fast shutter speed can also help safeguard 
against allover blurring that results when the 
camera is moved during the exposure. The faster 
the shutter speed, the shorter the exposure 
time, which reduces the time that you need to 
keep the camera absolutely still. If you’re using 
the Nikon D90 kit lens, you can also improve 
your odds of shake-free shots by enabling the 
vibration reduction (VR) feature. (Set the switch 
on the lens to the On position.) For a very slow 
shutter speed, using a tripod is the best way to 
avoid camera shake; be sure to turn the VR off 
when you do so. 
Keep in mind, too, that the range of f-stops and 
shutter speeds the camera can select in any of 
the automatic exposure modes depends on the 
lighting conditions. When you’re shooting at 
night, for example, the camera may not be able 
to select a shutter speed fast enough to stop 
action even in Sports mode.
If you want to manipulate focus and depth of 
field to a greater extent than the automated 
exposure modes allow, visit Chapter 6. For an 
explanation of the role of shutter speed and 
aperture in exposure, check out Chapter 5.

Using Flash in Automatic Exposure Modes
The built-in flash on your D90 offers a variety of different modes. Table 2-1 
offers a quick-reference guide to the six basic modes. In addition to these 
basic modes, the camera also offers some combo modes, such as Auto with 
Red-Eye Reduction, Slow Sync with Red-Eye Reduction, and the like.

You can check the current flash mode in the control panel and the Shooting 
Information display, as shown in Figure 2-5. (To display the Shooting 
Information screen, press the Info button.) The viewfinder display doesn’t 
advise you of the specific flash mode but instead just shows the universal 
lightning bolt icon when the flash is enabled, as shown in the figure, and 
turns off the icon when the flash is disabled.
 
The letters TTL that appear with the flash mode icon in the Shooting Information 
display stand for Through the Lens, which relates to the fact that at the default 
flash settings, the camera determines how much flash power is needed by meter-
ing the light coming through the lens. Nikon’s version of this flash-metering 
system is officially named i-TTL, with the I standing for intelligent.
 
 To change the flash mode, press and hold the Flash button on the side of the 
camera as you rotate the main command dial. (That’s the one on the back of 
the camera.)

 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
 
Figure 2-5: Look in these spots to check flash status.
 
Now for the bad news: When you do try to change the flash mode, you’ll 
quickly discover that you have access to only a couple of flash modes 
when you shoot in the automatic exposure modes covered in this chapter. 
Additionally, you don’t have access to flash compensation, which enables you 
to diminish or strengthen the burst of light the flash produces, as well as a few 
other flash features your camera offers. Bummer, as the youngsters say.
The upcoming sections tell you which flash modes are available in each of 
the fully automatic exposure modes. For more details about flash photogra-
phy, see Chapter 5.
Exploring Your Automatic Exposure Options
You can choose from seven 
fully automatic exposure 
modes, all of which you 
access via the Mode dial 
on the top of the camera, 
shown in Figure 2-6.
The next sections provide 
details on each of these 
options. For information 
about the four other set-
tings on the Mode dial — P 
(programmed autoexpo-
sure), S (shutter-priority 
autoexposure), A (aperture-
priority autoexposure), and 
M (manual exposure) — 
see Chapter 5.

automatic, point-and-shoot photography modes.

48
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
Remember that in any of these exposure modes, you have the option to focus 
manually or take advantage of autofocusing.
Auto mode
 
 In Auto mode, represented on the Mode dial by the icon you see in the 
margin here, the camera selects all settings based on the scene that it detects 
in front of the lens. Your only job is to lock in focus, either by using the auto-
focus technique that I outline at the beginning of the chapter or by using the 
manual-focusing method explained in Chapter 1.
Auto mode is great for casual, quick snapshooting. But keep these details in 
mind:
 
✓ Autofocusing: At the default settings, autofocusing works like so:
 
• The camera analyzes the scene and then selects which of the 11 
autofocus points to use when establishing focus.
 
• If the subject isn’t moving, focus remains locked as long as you 
hold the shutter button halfway down. But if the camera detects 
motion, it continually adjusts focus up to the time you press the 
button fully to record the picture. To ensure that focus is correct, 
you must keep your subject within the area of the viewfinder cov-
ered by the focusing points.
 
 Chapter 6 explains how to modify these autofocusing characteristics. 
(Look for the sections related to the AF-area mode and Autofocus mode 
options.) But you may find it easier to simply switch to manual focusing 
if you have trouble getting the camera to autofocus on your subject.
 
✓ Flash: You have only three flash mode choices: Auto, Auto with Red-Eye 
Reduction, and Off. (See Table 2-1 for a reminder of what these modes 
do.) You can’t enable the flash if the camera’s autoexposure meter 
doesn’t sense that additional light is needed.
 
✓ Color: You can’t adjust color. If the image displays a color cast, you 
must switch to a mode that enables you to adjust the White Balance set-
ting, covered in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Exposure: You have access to only one exposure-adjustment option, ISO 
Sensitivity. This setting determines the light sensitivity of the camera — 
or, to put it another way, how much light is needed to properly expose 
the image. By default, this option is set to Auto, and the camera adjusts 
the ISO Sensitivity as needed. For more information about how ISO 
affects your pictures — and why you may want to select a specific ISO 
setting — visit Chapter 5. 

49
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
I purposely didn’t include an example of a photo taken in Auto mode 
because, frankly, the results that this setting creates vary widely depending 
on how well the camera detects whether you’re trying to shoot a portrait, 
landscape, action shot, or whatever, as well as on lighting conditions. But the 
bottom line is that full auto is a one-size-fits-all approach that may or may not 
take best advantage of your camera’s capabilities. So if you want to more 
consistently take great pictures instead of merely good ones, I encourage you 
to explore the exposure, focus, and color information found in Part II so that 
you can abandon this mode in favor of modes that put more photographic 
decisions in your hands.
What does [r 12] in the viewfinder mean?
When you look in your viewfinder to frame a 
shot, the initial value shown in brackets at the 
right end of the viewfinder display indicates 
the number of additional pictures that can fit 
on your memory card at the currently selected 
Image Size and Image Quality settings. (Chapter 
3 explains those settings.) For example, in the 
left viewfinder image below, the value shows 
that the card can hold 612 more images.
As soon as you press the shutter button half-
way, which kicks the autofocus and exposure 
mechanisms into action, that value changes to 
instead show you how many pictures can fit in 
the camera’s memory buffer. In the right image 
here, for example, the r 12 value tells you that 
12 pictures can fit in the buffer. This number 
also varies depending on the size and quality 
settings you use. (The dot at the left end of the 
display is the focus lamp, which lights when 
focus is achieved.)
So what’s the buffer? It’s a temporary storage 
tank where the camera stores picture data 
until it has time to fully record that data onto 
the camera memory card. This system exists 
so that you can take a continuous series of pic-
tures without having to wait between shots until 
each image is fully written to the memory card. 
When the buffer is full, the camera automati-
cally disables the shutter button until it catches 
up on its recording work. Chances are, though, 
that you’ll very rarely, if ever, encounter this sit-
uation; the camera is usually more than capable 
of keeping up with your shooting rate. 
For more information about rapid-fire photogra-
phy, see the section on action photography in 
Chapter 7. And for help translating all the other 
viewfinder information, check out Chapters 5 
and 6.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Digital Vari-Program modes
In Auto mode, the camera tries to figure out what type of picture you want to 
take by assessing what it sees through the lens. If you don’t want to rely on 
the camera to make that judgment, your D90 offers six Digital Vari-Program 
modes, which are designed to automatically capture specific scenes in ways 
that are traditionally considered best from a creative standpoint. For exam-
ple, most people prefer portraits that have softly focused backgrounds. So 
in Portrait mode, the camera selects settings that can produce that type of 
background. 
 
All the Digital Vari-Program modes share a few limitations: 
 
✓ Exposure: As with Auto mode, the camera takes complete control of 
exposure, with the exception of the ISO Sensitivity setting, introduced in 
the preceding section and detailed in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Color: You can’t tweak color, either. Some modes manipulate colors in 
ways that you may or may not appreciate, and you’re stuck if you have a 
color cast problem.
 
✓ Flash: Available flash options vary depending on the Digital Vari-Program 
mode you select, but none of the modes offers complete flash flexibility.
In the next sections, you can read about the unique features of each of 
the Digital Vari-Program modes. To see whether you approve of how your 
camera approaches the different scenes, take some test shots. If you aren’t 
happy with the results, you can switch to one of the advanced exposure 
modes (P, S, A, or M) and then check out Chapters 5–7 to find out how to 
manipulate whatever aspect of the picture isn’t to your liking.
Auto Flash Off mode
 
 The Auto Flash Off mode delivers the same results as Auto mode but ensures 
that the flash doesn’t fire. In other words, think of this mode as a faster alter-
native to selecting Auto mode and then changing the flash setting to Off. 
From a practical standpoint, this mode provides an easy way to ensure that 
you don’t break the rules when shooting in locations that don’t permit flash: 
museums, churches, and so on.
Portrait mode
 
 As its name suggests, this mode is designed for shooting portraits. It affects 
your photos in a couple of ways:

51
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
✓ Depth of field: This mode is 
designed to produce a short depth 
of field (zone of sharp focus) so 
that your subject is sharp but the 
background is blurry, as illustrated 
in Figure 2-7. However, the camera 
achieves the shorter depth of field 
by opening the aperture to a wide 
setting (low f-stop number). In very 
bright lighting, the camera may be 
forced to “stop down” the aperture 
to a higher f-stop number, which 
reduces the amount of background 
blurring. (Chapter 5 explains aper-
ture and f-stops, if those terms are 
new to you.)
 
 You can maximize the blurring by 
moving your subject as far as pos-
sible from the background and by 
using a lens with a long focal 
length, better known as a telephoto 
lens. For example, if you own the 
18–105mm kit lens, zoom all the 
way to the 105mm focal length to 
maximize background blurring. See Chapter 6 for an explanation of focal 
length and the complete scoop on how to manipulate depth of field.
 
✓ Skin tones: In this mode, the camera tweaks color, sharpness, contrast, 
and a few other picture characteristics in a way designed to produce 
natural skin tones. If you don’t like the results, you must switch to P, 
S, A, or M exposure mode, all of which enable you to fine-tune these 
aspects of your picture. See Chapters 5 and 6 for details.
 
✓ Autofocusing: Autofocusing works as in Auto mode, described earlier in 
this chapter. 
 
✓ Flash: You can choose from Auto, Auto with Red-Eye Reduction flash, 
or Off. You can’t access Fill Flash mode, which means that you can’t 
add flash if the camera doesn’t think extra lighting is needed. This 
restriction can be problematic when shooting outdoor portraits, which 
often benefit from a small pop of flash light even in bright sunlight. See 
Chapter 7 for an example as well as some other tips on shooting por-
traits by flash light. 
Portrait mode
Figure 2-7: Portrait mode produces a softly 
focused background.

52
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Landscape mode
 
 Whereas Portrait mode aims for a 
very shallow depth of field (small 
zone of sharp focus), Landscape 
mode, which is designed for cap-
turing scenic vistas, city skylines, 
and other large-scale subjects, 
goes the other route, selecting an 
aperture setting (f-stop) that pro-
duces a large depth of field. As a 
result, objects both close to the 
camera and at a distance appear 
sharply focused. Figure 2-8 offers 
an example. For this picture, I set 
focus on the tree on the far right 
side of the frame. Notice that the 
tree on the far left appears nearly 
as sharp, despite its distance 
from my established focus point.
Note these other factoids about 
Landscape mode:
 
✓ Depth of field: As with 
Portrait mode, the camera 
manipulates depth of field 
by adjusting the aperture 
setting (f-stop). To produce 
the larger depth of field, the 
camera tries to use a high 
f-stop value, which means 
a very small aperture. But in dim lighting, the camera may be forced 
to open the aperture to allow enough light into the camera to properly 
expose the photo, so the depth of field may not be enough to keep the 
entire landscape in sharp focus. (Again, Chapter 5 offers a primer on 
aperture; Chapter 6 fully explains depth of field.)
 
✓ Color and contrast: This mode boosts color saturation and contrast 
slightly to produce the kind of bold, rich hues that most people prefer in 
landscape pictures. In addition, greens and blues are empahsized. If you 
want more control, switch to an advanced exposure mode (P, S, A, or M) 
and see Chapter 6 for details.
 
✓ Autofocusing: Autofocusing works just as for Auto mode, described ear-
lier in this chapter.
 
✓ Flash: The built-in flash is disabled, which is typically no big deal: 
Because of its limited range, a built-in flash is of little use when shooting 
most landscapes anyway. However, if you attach an external flash unit, 
you can use it in this mode. (Chapter 5 discusses external flash units.)
Landscape mode
Figure 2-8: Landscape mode produces a large 
zone of sharp focus and also boosts color intensity 
slightly.

 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Sports mode
 
 Sports mode activates a 
number of settings that can 
help you photograph a moving 
object, whether it’s an athlete, 
a race car, or a romping dog 
like the one in Figure 2-9. Here’s 
what you need to know: 
 
✓ Shutter speed: In order 
to catch a moving subject 
without blur, you need a 
fast shutter speed. So in 
Sports mode, the camera 
automatically chooses 
that fast shutter speed 
for you.
 
 Understand, though, that 
in dim lighting, the camera 
may not be able to select 
a very fast shutter speed 
and still deliver a good 
exposure. And because 
getting a good exposure 
trumps all, the shutter 
speed the camera uses 
may not be fast enough to 
“freeze” action, especially 
if your subject is moving 
very quickly.
 
 In Figure 2-9, the camera selected a shutter speed that did, in fact, catch 
my furkid in mid-romp, although if you look very closely, you can see some 
slight blurring of his beard. Because of the very bright light, the camera 
also selected a small aperture setting, which produces a large depth of 
field — so the grass in the background is as sharply focused as that in the 
foreground. To fully understand these issues, explore Chapters 5 and 6.
 
✓ Autofocusing: In Sports mode, the autofocus system works as it does 
when you shoot in Auto mode and the camera detects motion: That 
is, it automatically selects the focus point, but focus isn’t locked when 
you press the shutter button halfway, as it is in Portrait and Landscape 
mode. Instead, the camera continually adjusts focus up to the time you 
fully depress the shutter button and take the shot. 
 
 If your subject moves after you press the shutter button halfway, be 
sure that you adjust the framing so that the subject remains under one 
of the focus points. Otherwise, the camera may not lock focus on the 
subject correctly.
Sports mode
Figure 2-9: To capture moving subjects without blur, 
try Sports mode.

54
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Flash: The built-in flash is disabled. That can be a problem in low-light sit-
uations, but it also enables you to shoot successive images more quickly 
because the flash needs a brief period to recycle between shots. If you 
own an external flash unit, however, you can use it in Sports mode if you 
like; just be aware that you may sacrifice in the speed-shooting depart-
ment because of the necessary flash-recycle time. Additionally, you may 
be limited to a maximum shutter speed of 1/200 second, depending on the 
flash; Chapter 5 has tips on this subject.
 
Sometimes, allowing a moving object to blur can actually create a heightened 
sense of motion — an artistic choice that you can’t make in Sports mode. For 
more control over shutter speed, try out S mode (shutter-priority autoexpo-
sure), explained in Chapter 5.
Close Up mode
 
 Switching to Close Up mode doesn’t enable you to focus at a closer distance 
to your subject than normal as it does on some non-SLR cameras. The close-
focusing capabilities of your camera depend entirely on the lens you bought, 
so check your lens manual for details.
Close Up mode does affect your pictures in a couple of ways, however:
 
✓ Depth of field: Close Up mode, like Portrait mode, selects an aperture 
setting designed to produce short depth of field, which helps keep back-
ground objects from competing for attention with your main subject. 
As with Portrait mode, though, how much the background blurs varies 
depending on the available light (which determines the aperture setting 
the camera can use), the distance between your subject and the back-
ground, as well as the lens focal length, explained in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Autofocusing: At the default autofocusing settings, focus is automati-
cally locked on the object at the center of the frame when you press the 
shutter button halfway.
 
✓ Flash: You can set the Flash mode to Auto, Auto with Red-Eye Reduction, 
and Off. (I urge you, though, to be very careful about using the built-in 
flash when you’re shooting a person or animal at close range — that 
strong burst of light isn’t healthy for the eyes.)
Chapter 7 offers additional tips on close-up photography.
Night Portrait mode
 
 This mode is designed to deliver a better-looking flash portrait at night (or in 
any dimly lit environment). It does so by constraining you to using Auto Slow 
Sync, Auto Slow Sync with Red-Eye Reduction, or Off flash modes. In all three 
flash modes, the camera selects a shutter speed that results in a long exposure 
time. That slow shutter speed enables the camera to rely more on ambient 
light and less on the flash to expose the picture, which produces softer, more 
even lighting.

55
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
I cover the issue of long-exposure and slow-sync flash photography in detail 
in Chapter 5. For now, the critical thing to know is that the slower shutter 
speed means that you probably need a tripod. If you try to handhold the 
camera, you run the risk of moving the camera during the long exposure, 
resulting in a blurry image. Enabling the vibration reduction (VR) feature of 
your lens, if available, can help, but for nighttime shooting, even that may not 
permit successful handheld shooting. Your subjects also must stay perfectly 
still during the exposure, which can add to the challenge.
Autofocusing in this mode works the same way as in Auto mode, described 
earlier in this chapter.
Changing the (Shutter Button) Release Mode
 
In addition to all its other mode settings — exposure modes, focus modes, 
flash modes, and the like — your D90 offers a generically named but critical 
setting called Release mode. This setting determines how you trigger the 
actual image capture and what happens after you take that step. You have 
the following options:
 
 
✓ Single Frame: This setting, which is the default, records a single image 
each time you press the shutter button completely. In other words, this 
is normal-photography mode.
 
 
✓ Continuous Low: Sometimes known as burst mode, this mode records a 
continuous series of images as long as you hold down the shutter 
button. At the default setting, Continuous Low mode can capture a maxi-
mum of three frames per second. But you can change the maximum cap-
ture number to 1, 2, or 4 frames per second. Just open the Custom 
Setting menu, select the Shooting Display submenu, and then select item 
d6, CL Mode Shooting Speed, as shown in Figure 2-10. 
 
 
Figure 2-10: You can specify the maximum frames-per-second rate for Continuous Low 
 
Release mode.

56
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 
✓ Continuous High: This mode works just like Continuous Low except that 
it has a maximum frames-per-second rate of four to five frames. You 
can’t adjust the maximum rate for this mode.
 
 Both of the Continuous modes are designed to make it easier for you to 
capture action. But keep in mind that the actual number of frames you 
can record per second depends in part on your shutter speed. At a slow 
shutter speed, the camera may not be able to reach the maximum frame 
rate. (See Chapter 5 for an explanation of shutter speed.)
 
 
✓ Self-Timer: Want to put yourself in the picture? Select this mode, press 
the shutter button, and run into the frame. As soon as you press the 
shutter button, the autofocus-assist illuminator on the front of the 
camera starts to blink, and the camera emits a series of beeps (assuming 
that you didn’t disable its voice, a setting I cover in Chapter 1). A few 
seconds later, the camera captures the image.
 
 At the default settings, the capture-delay time is 10 seconds, and the 
camera records one shot for each press of the shutter button. But you 
can adjust both the delay time and the number of images recorded by 
visiting the Custom Setting menu. After you pull up the menu, choose 
the Timers/AE Lock submenu and then select the Self Timer option, as 
shown on the left in Figure 2-11. Press OK to access the options, shown 
on the right in the figure. 
 
 You can select a capture-delay time of 2, 5, 10, or 20 seconds and set the 
number of images recorded between 1 and 9.
 
   ✓ Delayed Remote and Quick Response Remote: The final two Release 
mode settings relate to the optional Nikon wireless remote-control unit. 
If you select Delayed Remote, the camera snaps the picture two seconds 
after you press the shutter-release button on the remote unit. If you 
select Quick Response Remote, the image is captured immediately.

 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
When you use Self-Timer or the remote control modes, you should remove 
the little rubber cup that surrounds the viewfinder and then insert the view-
finder cover that shipped with your camera. (Dig around in the accessories 
box — the cover is a tiny black piece of plastic, about the size of the view-
finder.) Otherwise, light may seep into the camera through the viewfinder 
and affect exposure. You can also simply use the camera strap or something 
else to cover the viewfinder in a pinch.
You can see which Release mode is currently selected by inspecting the 
Control panel or Shooting Information display; look for the Release mode 
symbol in the areas highlighted in Figure 2-12. (Remember that pressing the 
Info button brings up the Shooting Information display.)
 
 
Figure 2-12: You can check the current Release mode in the Control panel and Shooting 
 
Information display.
 
 To change the mode, press and hold the Release Mode button on top of the 
camera (shown in the margin here). As soon as you press the button, all set-
tings except the Release mode disappear from the Control panel and are 
dimmed in the Shooting Information display. While continuing to press the 
button, rotate the main command dial (on the back of the camera) to cycle 
through the available Release mode settings. 
 
Your selected Release mode stays in force until you change it. However, the 
camera cancels out of the remote control modes if it doesn’t receive a signal 
from the remote after about one minute. You can adjust this timing through 
an option on the Timers/AE Lock submenu of the Custom Setting menu. 
Select the Remote On Duration option and press OK to reveal the available 
options. The maximum delay time is 15 minutes; keep in mind that a shorter 
delay time saves battery life. After the delay time expires, the camera resets 
itself to either Single or one of the continuous modes, depending on which 
mode you last used.

A
lmost every review of the D90 contains glowing reports 
about the camera’s top-notch picture quality. As you’ve 
no doubt discovered for yourself, those claims are true, 
too: This baby can create large, beautiful images.
What you may not have discovered is that Nikon’s 
default Image Quality setting isn’t the highest that 
the D90 offers. Why, you ask, would Nikon do such 
a thing? Why not set up the camera to produce the 
best images right out of the box? The answer is that 
using the top setting has some downsides. Nikon’s 
default choice represents a compromise between 
avoiding those disadvantages while still producing 
images that will please most photographers.
Whether that compromise is right for you, however, 
depends on your photographic needs. To help you decide, 
this chapter explains the Image Quality setting, along with the 
Image Size setting, which is also critical to the quality of images that you 
print. Just in case you’re having quality problems related to other issues, 
though, the first section of the chapter provides a handy quality-defect 
diagnosis guide.

60
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
A word of warning before you dive in: This stuff may be a little confusing at 
first. In fact, I pretty much guarantee it. Some math is even involved, which is 
usually against my principles. On top of that, discussions of picture quality 
and size involve lots of technical terms, such as pixels, resolution, JPEG com-
pression, and the like.
So take it slowly, and if your eyes start to glaze over, put the book down and 
come back later for another go-round. It may require a few reads of this chap-
ter, but before long, you’ll feel confident about controlling these important 
aspects of your pictures.
Diagnosing Quality Problems
When I use the term picture quality, I’m not talking about the composition, 
exposure, or other traditional characteristics of a photograph. Instead, I’m 
referring to how finely the image is rendered in the digital sense.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the concept: The first example is a high-quality image, 
with clear details and smooth color transitions. The other examples show 
five common digital-image defects.
 
High quality
Pixelation
JPEG artifacts
Noise
Color cast
Lens/sensor dirt
 
Figure 3-1: Refer to this symptom guide to determine the cause of poor image quality.

61
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
Each of these defects is related to a different issue, and only one is affected 
by the Image Quality setting on your D90. So if you aren’t happy with your 
image quality, first compare your photos to those in the figure to properly 
diagnose the problem. Then try these remedies: 
 
✓ Pixelation: When an image doesn’t have enough pixels (the colored tiles 
used to create digital images), details aren’t clear, and curved and diago-
nal lines appear jagged. The fix is to increase image resolution, which 
you do via the Image Size control. See the next section, “Considering 
Resolution (Image Size),” for details.
 
✓ JPEG artifacts: The “parquet tile” texture and random color defects that 
mar the third image in Figure 3-1 can occur in photos captured in the 
JPEG (jay-peg) file format, which is why these flaws are referred to as 
JPEG artifacts. This is the defect related to the Image Quality setting; see 
“Understanding the Image Quality Options” to find out more.
 
✓ Noise: This defect gives your image a speckled look, as shown in the 
lower-left example in Figure 3-1. Noise can occur with very long expo-
sure times or when you choose a high ISO Sensitivity setting on your 
camera. You can explore both issues in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Color cast: If your colors are seriously out of whack, as shown in the 
lower-middle example in the figure, try adjusting the camera’s White 
Balance setting. Chapter 6 covers this control and other color issues. 
Note, though, that you can control white balance only when you shoot 
in the advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, and M).
 
✓ Lens/sensor dirt: A dirty lens is the first possible cause of the kind 
of defects you see in the last example in the figure. If cleaning your 
lens doesn’t solve the problem, dust or dirt may have made its way 
onto the camera’s image sensor. See the sidebar “Maintaining a 
pristine view,” elsewhere in this chapter, for information on safe 
lens and sensor cleaning. 
 
When diagnosing image problems, you may want to open the photos in 
ViewNX or some other photo software and zoom in for a close-up inspection. 
Some defects, especially pixelation and JPEG artifacts, have a similar appear-
ance until you see them at a magnified view. (See Part III for information 
about using ViewNX.)
I should also tell you that I used a little digital enhancement to exaggerate the 
flaws in my example images to make the symptoms easier to see. With the 
exception of an unwanted color cast or a big blob of lens or sensor dirt, these 
defects may not even be noticeable unless you print or view your image at a 
very large size. And the subject matter of your image may camouflage some 
flaws; most people probably wouldn’t detect a little JPEG artifacting in a 
photograph of a densely wooded forest, for example.

62
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
In other words, don’t consider Figure 3-1 as an indication that your D90 is 
suspect in the image quality department. First, any digital camera can pro-
duce these defects under the right circumstances. Second, by following the 
guidelines in this chapter and the others mentioned in the preceding list, you 
can resolve any quality issues that you may encounter.
Considering Resolution (Image Size)
Like other digital devices, your D90 creates pictures out of pixels, which 
is short for picture elements. You can see some pixels close up in the right 
example of Figure 3-2, which shows a greatly magnified view of the eye area 
in the left image.
 
 
Figure 3-2: Pixels are the building blocks of digital photos.
You specify the pixel count of your images, also known as the resolution, 
via the Image Size control. The D90 offers three Image Size settings: Large, 
Medium, and Small; Table 3-1 lists the resulting resolution values for each 
setting.
Table 3-1 
Image Size (Resolution) Options
Setting
Resolution
Large
4288 x 2848 pixels (12.2 MP)
Medium
3216 x 2136 pixels (6.9 MP)
Small
2144 x 1424 pixels (3 MP)

63
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
In the table, the first pair of numbers shown for each setting represents the 
image pixel dimensions — that is, the number of horizontal pixels and the 
number of vertical pixels. The values in parentheses indicate the total resolu-
tion, which you get by multiplying the horizontal and vertical pixel values. 
This number is usually stated in megapixels, abbreviated MP for short. One 
megapixel equals 1 million pixels. (I rounded off the MP values in the table.)
 
Note, however, that if you select Raw (NEF) as your file format, all images are 
captured at the Large setting. You can vary the resolution only if you select 
JPEG as the file format. The upcoming section “Understanding the Image 
Quality Options” explains file formats. 
So how many pixels are enough? To make the call, you need to understand 
how resolution affects print quality, display size, and file size. The next sec-
tions explain these issues, as well as a few other resolution factoids.
If you’re already schooled on the subject and just want to know how to select 
a resolution setting on your D90, skip to “Setting Image Size and Quality,” 
near the end of this chapter, for specifics.
Pixels and print quality
 
When mulling over resolution options, your first consideration is how large 
you want to print your photos, because pixel count determines the size at 
which you can produce a high-quality print. If you don’t have enough pixels, 
your prints may exhibit the defects you see in the pixelation example in 
Figure 3-1, or worse, you may be able to see the individual pixels, as in the 
right example in Figure 3-2.
Depending on your photo printer, you typically need anywhere from 200 to 
300 pixels per linear inch, or ppi, of the print. To produce an 8-x-10-inch print 
at 200 ppi, for example, you need 1600 horizontal pixels and 2000 vertical 
pixels (or vice versa, depending on the orientation of your print).
Table 3-2 lists the pixel counts needed to produce traditional print sizes at 
200 ppi and 300 ppi. But again, the optimum ppi varies depending on the 
printer — some printers prefer even more than 300 ppi — so check your 
manual or ask the photo technician at the lab that makes your prints. (And 
note that ppi is not the same thing as dpi, which is a measurement of printer 
resolution. Dpi refers to how many dots of color the printer can lay down per 
inch; most printers use multiple dots to reproduce one pixel.)

Even though many photo-editing programs enable you to add pixels to an 
existing image, doing so isn’t a good idea. For reasons I won’t bore you with, 
adding pixels — known as resampling — doesn’t enable you to successfully 
enlarge your photo. In fact, resampling typically makes matters worse. The 
printing discussion at the start of Chapter 9 includes some example images 
that illustrate this issue.
Pixels and screen display size
 
Resolution doesn’t affect the quality of images viewed on a monitor, televi-
sion, or other screen device as it does printed photos. What resolution does 
determine is the size at which the image appears.
This issue is one of the most misunderstood aspects of digital photography, 
so I explain it thoroughly in Chapter 9. For now, just know that you need 
way fewer pixels for onscreen photos than you do for printed photos. For 
example, Figure 3-3 shows a 450-x-300-pixel image that I attached to an e-mail 
message.
 
For e-mail images, I recommend a maximum of 640 pixels for the picture’s 
longest dimension. If your image is much larger, the recipient can’t view the 
entire picture without scrolling the display.
In short, even if you use the smallest Image Size setting on your D90, you’ll 
have more than enough pixels for onscreen use, whether you display the pic-
ture on a computer monitor, a digital projector, or television set — even one 
of the new, supersized high-definition TVs. Again, Chapter 9 details this issue 
and also shows you how to prepare your pictures for online sharing.
Pixels and file size
Every additional pixel increases the amount of data required to create a digi-
tal picture file. So a higher-resolution image has a larger file size than a low-
resolution image.

65
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
 
 Figure 3-3: The low resolution of this image (450 x 300 pixels) ensures that it can be viewed 
without scrolling when shared via e-mail.
 
Large files present several problems:
 
✓ You can store fewer images on your memory card, on your computer’s 
hard drive, and on removable storage media such as a CD-ROM.
 
✓ The camera needs more time to process and store the image data on 
the memory card after you press the shutter button. This extra time can 
hamper fast-action shooting.
 
✓ When you share photos online, larger files take longer to upload and 
download.
 
✓ When you edit your photos in your photo software, your computer 
needs more resources and time to process large files.
To sum up, the tradeoff for a high-resolution image is a large file size. But 
note that the Image Quality setting also affects file size. See the upcoming 
section “Understanding the Image Quality Options” for more on that topic. 
The upcoming sidebar “How many pictures fit on my memory card?” pro-
vides additional thoughts about the whole file-storage issue.

66
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Resolution recommendations
As you can see, resolution is a bit of a sticky wicket. What if you aren’t sure 
how large you want to print your images? What if you want to print your 
photos and share them online? 
Personally, I take the “better safe than sorry” route, which leads to the fol-
lowing recommendations about the Image Size setting: 
 
✓ Always shoot at a resolution suitable for print. You then can create 
a low-resolution copy of the image in your photo editor for use online. 
Chapter 9 shows you how.
How many pictures fit on my memory card?
That question is one of the first asked by new 
camera owners — and it’s an important one 
because you don’t want to run out of space on 
your memory card just as the perfect photo-
graphic subject presents itself.
As explained in the Image Size and Image 
Quality discussions in this chapter, image reso-
lution (pixel count) and file format (JPEG or Raw) 
together help determine the size of the picture 
file which, in turn, determines how many photos 
fit in a given amount of camera memory. (The 
actual file size of any image also depends on a 
few other factors, including the level of detail 
and color in the subject.)
On the D90, file sizes range anywhere from 
16.9MB (megabytes) to 0.4MB, depending on the 
combination of Image Size and Image Quality 
settings you select. That means the capacity 
of a 2GB (gigabyte) memory card ranges from 
89 pictures to a whopping 3800 pictures, again, 
depending on your Size/Quality settings.
The table here shows the file sizes for just some 
Size/Quality combinations; you can find a table 
that lists all the possibilities in your camera 
manual if you’re curious.

 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
 Again, you can’t go in the opposite direction, adding pixels to a low-
resolution original in your photo editor to create a good, large print. 
Even with the very best software, adding pixels doesn’t improve the 
print quality of a low-resolution image.
 
✓ For everyday images, Medium (6.9 MP) is a good choice. I find 12.2 MP, 
which you get at the Large setting, to be overkill for most casual shoot-
ing, which means that you’re creating huge files for no good reason. 
Keep in mind that even at the Medium setting, your pixel count (3216 x 
2136) exceeds what you need to produce an 8-x-10-inch print at 200 ppi.
 
✓ Choose Large (12.2 MP) for an image that you plan to crop, print very 
large, or both. The benefit of maxing out resolution is that you have 
the flexibility to crop your photo and still generate a decent-sized print 
of the remaining image. For example, I shot the left photo in Figure 3-4 
at the zoo. (What, you think I can afford an arctic safari or something?) 
Even with a powerful zoom lens, I couldn’t get close enough to fill the 
frame with the bear’s head, which was my compositional goal. Shooting 
at the highest resolution enabled me to crop the photo and still have 
enough pixels left to produce a great print, as you see in the right image.
 
✓ Reduce resolution if shooting speed is paramount. If you’re shooting 
action and the shot-to-shot capture time is slower than you’d like — that 
is, the camera takes too long after you take one shot before it lets you take 
another — dialing down the resolution may help. Also see Chapter 7 for 
other tips on action photography.
After you decide which resolution setting is right for your picture, visit the 
section “Setting Image Size and Quality,” later in this chapter.

Understanding the Image Quality Options
If I had my druthers, the Image Quality option on the D90 would instead be 
called File Type, because that’s what the setting controls.
Here’s the deal: The file type, more commonly known as a file format, deter-
mines how your picture data is recorded and stored. Your choice does 
impact picture quality, but so do other factors, as outlined at the beginning 
of this chapter. In addition, your choice of file type has ramifications beyond 
picture quality.
At any rate, your D90 offers the two file types common on most of today’s 
digital cameras: JPEG and Camera Raw, or just Raw for short, which goes by 
the specific moniker NEF on Nikon cameras. The next sections explain the 
pros and cons of each format. If your mind is already made up, skip ahead to 
“Setting Image Size and Quality,” near the end of this chapter, to find out how 
to make your selection.
 
Don’t confuse file format with the Format Memory Card option on the Setup 
menu. That option erases all data on your memory card; see Chapter 1 for 
details.
JPEG: The imaging (and Web) standard 
Pronounced jay-peg, this format is the default setting on your D90, as it is for 
most digital cameras. JPEG is popular for two main reasons:
 
✓ Immediate usability: All Web browsers and e-mail programs can display 
JPEG files, so you can share them online immediately after you shoot 
them. The same can’t be said for NEF (Raw) files, which must be con-
verted to JPEG files before you can share them online. And although you 
can view and print Raw files in Nikon ViewNX without converting them, 
many third-party photo programs don’t enable you to do that. You can 
read more about the conversion process in the upcoming section “NEF 
(Raw): The purist’s choice.”
 
✓ Small files: JPEG files are smaller than NEF (Raw) files. And smaller files 
consume less room on your camera memory card and in your computer’s 
storage tank.
The downside — you knew there had to be one — is that JPEG creates 
smaller files by applying lossy compression. This process actually throws 
away some image data. Too much compression leads to the defects you see 
in the JPEG Artifacts example in Figure 3-1.
Fortunately, your camera enables you to specify how much compression 
you’re willing to accept. The Image Quality menu offers three JPEG settings, 
which produce the following results: 

69
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
✓ JPEG Fine: At this setting, the compression ratio is 1:4 — that is, the file 
is four times smaller than it would otherwise be. In plain English, that 
means that very little compression is applied, so you shouldn’t see many 
compression artifacts, if any.
 
✓ JPEG Norm: Switch to Norm (for Normal), and the compression ratio 
rises to 1:8. The chance of seeing some artifacting increases as well.
 
✓ JPEG Basic: Shift to this setting, and the compression ratio jumps to 
1:16. That’s a substantial amount of compression and brings with it a lot 
more risk of artifacting.
Note, though, that even the JPEG Basic setting on your D90 doesn’t result in 
anywhere near the level of artifacting that you see in my example in Figure 3-1. 
Again, that example is exaggerated to help you to be able to recognize artifact-
ing defects and understand how they differ from other image-quality issues.
In fact, if you keep your image print or display size small, you aren’t likely to 
notice a great deal of quality difference between the Fine, Normal, and Basic 
compression levels, although details in the Fine version may appear slightly 
crisper than the Normal and Basic options. It’s only when you greatly enlarge 
a photo that the differences become apparent.
Take a look at Figures 3-5 and 3-6, for 
example. I captured the scene in Figure 
3-5 four times, keeping the resolution 
the same for each shot but varying the 
Image Quality setting. For the photo you 
see in Figure 3-5, I used the JPEG Fine 
setting. I thought about printing the 
three other shots along with the JPEG 
Fine example, but frankly, you wouldn’t 
be able to detect a nickel’s worth of 
difference between the examples at the 
size that I could print them on this page. 
So Figure 3-6 shows just a portion of 
each shot at a greatly enlarged size. The 
first three images show the JPEG Fine, 
Normal, and Basic shots; for the fourth 
image, I used the NEF (Raw) setting, 
which applies no compression. (Note 
that during the process of converting the 
Raw image to a print-ready file, I tried 
to use settings that kept the Raw image 
as close as possible to its JPEG cousins 
in all aspects but quality. But any varia-
tions in exposure, color, and contrast 
are a result of the conversion process, 
not of the format per se.)
Figure 3-5: This subject offered a good test 
for comparing the Image Quality settings.

JPEG Basic
Raw (NEF)
JPEG Fine
JPEG Normal
 
Figure 3-6: Here you see a portion of the tower at greatly enlarged views.
Even at the greatly magnified size, it takes a sharp eye to detect the quality 
differences between the Raw and Fine images. When you carefully inspect 
the Normal version, you can see some artifacting start to appear; jump to the 
Basic example, and compression artifacting becomes fairly obvious.
 
Nikon chose to use the Normal setting as the default on the D90. I suppose 
that’s okay for everyday images that you don’t plan to print or display very 
large. And because file size shrinks as you apply more compression, Normal 
enables you to fit more photos on your memory card than Fine or NEF (Raw).
For my money, though, the file-size benefit you gain when going from Fine 
to Normal isn’t worth even a little quality loss, especially with the price of 
camera memory cards getting lower every day. You never know when a 

71
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
casual snapshot is going to turn out to be so great that you want to print or 
display it large enough that even minor quality loss becomes a concern. And 
of all the defects that you can correct in a photo editor, artifacting is one of 
the hardest to remove. So if I shoot in the JPEG format, I stick with Fine.
I suggest that you do your own test shots, however, carefully inspect the 
results in your photo editor, and make your own judgment about what level 
of artifacting you can accept. Artifacting is often much easier to spot when 
you view images onscreen. It’s difficult to reproduce artifacting here in print 
because the print process obscures some of the tiny defects caused by 
compression.
If you don’t want any risk of artifacting, bypass JPEG altogether and change 
the file type to NEF (Raw). Or consider your other option, which is to record 
two versions of each file, one Raw and one JPEG. The next section offers 
details.
 
Whichever format you select, be aware of one more important rule for pre-
serving the original image quality: If you retouch pictures in your photo 
software, don’t save the altered images in the JPEG format. Every time you 
alter and save an image in the JPEG format, you apply another round of lossy 
compression. And with enough editing, saving, and compressing, you can 
eventually get to the level of image degradation shown in the JPEG example 
in Figure 3-1, at the start of this chapter. (Simply opening and closing the file 
does no harm.)
Always save your edited photos in a nondestructive format. TIFF, pro-
nounced tiff, is a good choice and is a file-saving option available in most 
photo editing programs. Should you want to share the edited image online, 
create a JPEG copy of the TIFF file when you’re finished making all your 
changes. That way, you always retain one copy of the photo at the original 
quality captured by the camera. You can read more about TIFF in Chapter 8, 
in the section related to processing Raw images. Chapter 9 explains how to 
create a JPEG copy of a photo for online sharing.
NEF (Raw): The purist’s choice
The other picture file type you can create on your D90 is called Camera Raw, 
or just Raw (as in uncooked) for short.
 
Each manufacturer has its own flavor of Raw. Nikon’s is called NEF, so you 
see the three-letter extension NEF at the end of Raw filenames.

72
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Raw is popular with advanced, very demanding photographers, for these 
reasons:
 
✓ Greater creative control: With JPEG, internal camera software tweaks 
your images, making adjustments to color, exposure, and sharpness as 
needed to produce the results that Nikon believes its customers prefer. 
With Raw, the camera simply records the original, unprocessed image 
data. The photographer then copies the image file to the computer and 
uses special software known as a raw converter to produce the actual 
image, making decisions about color, exposure, and so on at that point. 
The upshot is that “shooting Raw” enables you, and not the camera, to 
have the final say on the visual characteristics of your image.
 
✓ Higher bit depth: Bit depth is a measure of how many distinct color 
values an image file can contain. JPEG files restrict you to 8 bits each for 
the red, blue, and green color components, or channels, that make up a 
digital image, for a total of 24 bits. That translates to roughly 16.7 million 
possible colors. On the D90, a Raw file delivers a higher bit count, col-
lecting 12 bits per channel.
 
 Although jumping from 8 to 12 bits sounds like a huge difference, you 
may not really ever notice any difference in your photos — that 8-bit 
palette of 16.7 million values is more than enough for superb images. 
Where having the extra bits can come in handy is if you really need to 
adjust exposure, contrast, or color after the shot in your photo editing 
program. In cases where you apply extreme adjustments, having the 
extra original bits sometimes helps avoid a problem known as banding 
or posterization, which creates abrupt color breaks where you should 
see smooth, seamless transitions. (A higher bit depth doesn’t always 
prevent the problem, however, so don’t expect miracles.)
 
✓ Best picture quality: Because Raw doesn’t apply the destructive com-
pression associated with JPEG, you don’t run the risk of the artifacting 
that can occur with JPEG. 
But of course, as with most things in life, Raw isn’t without its disadvantages. 
To wit:
 
✓ You can’t do much with your pictures until you process them in a Raw 
converter. You can’t share them online, for example, or put them into a 
text document or multimedia presentation. You can print them immedi-
ately if you use Nikon ViewNX, but most other photo programs require 
you to convert the Raw files to a standard format first. So when you 
shoot Raw, you add to the time you must spend in front of the computer 
instead of behind the camera lens.

73
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
✓ To get the full benefit of Raw, you need software other than Nikon 
ViewNX. The ViewNX software that ships free with your camera does 
have a command that enables you to convert Raw files to JPEG or to 
TIFF, introduced in the preceding section. However, this free tool gives 
you limited control over how your original data is translated in terms of 
color, exposure, and other characteristics — which defeats one of the 
primary purposes of shooting Raw.
 
 Nikon Capture NX 2 offers a sophisticated Raw converter, but it costs 
about $180. (Sadly, if you already own Capture NX, you need to upgrade 
to version 2 to open the Raw files from your D90.) If you own Adobe 
Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, however, you’re set; both include 
the converter that most people consider one of the best in the industry. 
Watch the sale ads, and you can pick up Elements for well under $100. 
You may need to download an update from the Adobe Web site (www.
adobe.com) to get the converter to work with your D90 files.
 
 Of course, the D90 also offers an in-camera Raw converter, found on 
the Retouch menu. But although it’s convenient, this tool isn’t the easi-
est to use because you must rely on the small camera monitor when 
making judgments about color, exposure, sharpness, and so on. The in-
camera tool also doesn’t offer the complete cadre of features available 
in Capture NX 2 and other converter software utilities.
 
 Chapter 8 offers more information on the in-camera conversion process 
and also offers a look at the converter found in ViewNX. 
 
✓ Raw files are larger than JPEGs. The type of file compression that Raw 
applies doesn’t degrade image quality, but the tradeoff is a larger file. 
In addition, Nikon Raw files are always captured at the maximum reso-
lution available on the camera, even if you don’t really need all those 
pixels. For both reasons, Raw files are significantly larger than JPEGs, so 
they take up more room on your memory card and on your computer’s 
hard drive or other picture-storage device. 
Are the disadvantages worth the gain? Only you can decide. But before you 
make up your mind, refer to Figure 3-6 and compare the JPEG Fine example 
with its NEF (Raw) counterpart. You may be able to detect some subtle 
quality differences when you really study the two, but a casual viewer likely 
would not, especially if shown the entire example images at normal print 
sizes rather than the greatly magnified views shown in the figure. I took 
Figure 3-5, for example, using JPEG Fine.
 
That said, I do shoot in the Raw format when I’m dealing with tricky lighting 
because doing so gives me more control over the final image exposure. For 
example, if you use a capable Raw converter, you can specify how bright you 
want the brightest areas of your photo to appear and how dark you prefer 

74
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
your deepest shadows. With JPEG, the camera makes those decisions, which 
can potentially limit your flexibility if you try to adjust exposure in your 
photo editor later. And the extra bits in a Raw file offer an additional safety 
net because I usually can push the exposure adjustments a little further in my 
photo editor if necessary without introducing banding.
I also go Raw if I know that I’m going to want huge prints of a subject. But keep 
in mind: I’m a photography geek, I have all the requisite software, and I don’t 
really have much else to do with my time than process scads of Raw images. 
Oh, and I’m a bit of a perfectionist, too. (Although I’m more bothered by imper-
fections than I am motivated to remove them. A lazy perfectionist, if you will.)
If you do decide to try Raw shooting, you can select from four options on 
your D90’s Image Quality menu: 
 
✓ NEF (RAW): This setting produces a single Raw file. Again, you don’t 
have a choice of Image Size settings; the camera always captures the file 
at the maximum resolution (12.2 MP).
 
✓ NEF (RAW)+JPEG Fine, Normal, or Basic: You also can choose to cap-
ture the image as both a NEF file and a JPEG file, and you can specify 
whether you want the JPEG version recorded at the Fine, Normal, or 
Basic setting. (You can also set the resolution of the JPEG file at Large, 
Medium, or Small.) Of course, with two files, you consume more space 
on your camera memory card.
 
I often choose the Raw+JPEG Fine option when I’m shooting pictures I want to 
share right away with people who don’t have software for viewing Raw files. I 
upload the JPEGs to a photo-sharing site where everyone can view them, and 
then I process the Raw versions of my favorite images for my own use when I 
have time. Having the JPEG version also enables you to display your photos 
on a DVD player or TV that has a slot for an SD memory card — most can’t 
display Raw files but can handle JPEGs. Ditto for portable media players and 
digital photo frames. 
If you choose to create both files, note a couple of things:
 
✓ When you view your pictures on the camera, you see only the JPEG 
version.
 
✓ If you delete the JPEG version using the camera’s Delete function, the 
NEF file is erased as well. (After you transfer the two files to your 
computer, deleting one doesn’t affect the other.) 
Chapter 4 explains more about viewing and deleting photos; see the upcom-
ing section “Setting Image Size and Quality” to find out how to specify the 
size for your JPEG files.

75
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
My take: Choose JPEG Fine or NEF (Raw)
At this point, you may be finding all this technical goop a bit much — I 
recognize that panicked look in your eyes — so allow me to simplify things 
for you. Until you have time or energy to completely digest all the ramifica-
tions of JPEG versus Raw, here’s a quick summary of my thoughts on the 
matter:
 
✓ If you require the absolute best image quality and have the time and 
interest to do the Raw conversion, shoot Raw. See Chapter 8 for more 
information on the conversion process.
 
✓ If great photo quality is good enough for you, you don’t have wads of 
spare time, or you aren’t that comfortable with the computer, stick with 
JPEG Fine. 
 
✓ If you don’t mind the added file-storage space requirement and want the 
flexibility of both formats, choose Raw+JPEG. If you need your JPEGs to 
exhibit the best quality, go with Raw+JPEG Fine. 
 
✓ If you go with JPEG only, stay away from JPEG Normal and Basic. The 
tradeoff for smaller files isn’t, in my opinion, worth the risk of compres-
sion artifacts. As with my recommendations on image size, this fits 
the “better safe than sorry” formula: You never know when you may 
capture a spectacular, enlargement-worthy subject, and it would be a 
shame to have the photo spoiled by compression defects. If you select 
Raw+JPEG, of course, this isn’t as much of an issue because you always 
have the Raw version as backup if you aren’t happy with the JPEG 
quality. 
Setting Image Size and Quality
 
To sum up this chapter: The Image Size and Image Quality options together 
determine the quality of your pictures and also play a large role in image file 
size. Choose a high Image Quality setting (NEF or JPEG Fine) and the maxi-
mum Image Size setting (Large), and you get top-quality pictures and large 
file sizes. Combining the lowest Quality setting (JPEG Basic) with the lowest 
Size setting (Small) greatly shrinks files, enabling you to fit lots more pictures 
on your memory card, but it also increases the chances that you’ll be disap-
pointed with the quality of those pictures, especially if you make large prints.
You can monitor the Image Size and Image Quality settings in the Control 
panel and Shooting Information display (which you bring up by pressing the 
Info button). Figure 3-7 shows you where to look.

76
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 
 Figure 3-7: The current Image Size and Quality settings appear on the Control panel and 
Shooting Information display.
 
 The quickest way to adjust the settings is to press the Qual button, shown in 
the margin here. As soon as you press the button, all other settings disap-
pear from the Control panel and are dimmed in the Shooting Information dis-
play. While continuing to press the button, rotate the main command dial (on 
the back of the camera) to cycle through the available combinations of Image 
Size and Image Quality settings — Raw, Large/Fine, Large/Normal, Raw+JPEG 
Fine, and so on.
As an alternative, you can adjust the 
settings via the Shooting menu, shown 
in Figure 3-8. Here, you set the Image 
Size and Image Quality options inde-
pendently of each other. Remember 
that when you choose the Raw (NEF) 
format, you don’t need to worry about 
the Image Size setting — the camera 
captures all Raw images at the Large 
resolution. If you go with one of the 
Raw+JPEG options, the Image Size 
setting affects the JPEG version only.
 
Again, adjusting the Image Size or 
Image Quality setting changes the 
picture file size, which changes the 
number of new shots you can fit on the current memory card. You can moni-
tor the remaining card capacity in the Shots Remaining area of the Control 
panel and Shooting Information display. (It reads 276 in Figure 3-7.)
Figure 3-8: You also can set Image Size and 
Image Quality via the Shooting menu.

 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
Maintaining a pristine view
Often lost in discussions of digital photo 
defects — compression artifacts, pixelation, 
and the like — is the impact of plain-old dust 
and dirt on picture quality. But no matter what 
camera settings you use, you aren’t going to 
achieve great picture quality with a dirty lens. 
So make it a practice to clean your lens on a 
regular basis, using one of the specialized 
cloths and cleaning solutions made expressly 
for that purpose.
If you continue to notice random blobs or hair-
like defects in your images (refer to the last 
example in Figure 3-1), you probably have a dirty 
image sensor. That’s the part of your camera 
that does the actual image capture — the digi-
tal equivalent of a film negative, if you will.
Your D90 offers an automated, internal sensor-
cleaning mechanism. By default, this automatic 
cleaning happens every time you turn the camera 
on or off. You also can request a cleaning session 
at any time via the Clean Image Sensor command 
on the Setup menu. (Chapter 1 has details on this 
menu option.)
But if you frequently change lenses in a dirty 
environment, the internal cleaning mechanism 
may not be adequate, in which case a manual 
sensor cleaning is necessary. You can do this 
job yourself, but . . . I don’t recommend it. Image 
sensors are pretty delicate beings, and you 
can easily damage them or other parts of your 
camera if you aren’t careful. Instead, find a local 
camera store that offers this service. In my area 
(central Indiana), sensor cleaning costs from 
$30–$50. 
One more cleaning tip: Never — and I mean 
never — try to clean any part of your camera 
using a can of compressed air. Doing so can 
not only damage the interior of your camera, 
blowing dust or dirt into areas where it can’t be 
removed, but also crack the external monitor.

Monitor Matters: Picture Playback 
and Live View Shooting
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring picture playback functions
▶ Deciphering the picture information displays
▶ Understanding the exposure histogram
▶ Deleting bad pictures and protecting great ones
▶ Using the monitor as viewfinder in Live View mode
▶ Recording digital movies
W
ithout question, my favorite thing about digital photogra-
phy is being able to view my pictures on the camera 
monitor the instant after I shoot them. No more guessing 
whether I captured the image I wanted or I need to try 
again, as in the film era. And no more wasting money 
on developing and printing pictures that stink.
Of course, with the D90, you can use the monitor 
not only to review your photos, but also to preview 
them. That is, if you turn on Live View shooting, 
you can use the monitor instead of the viewfinder 
to compose your shots. And once in Live View 
mode, you also can record short digital movies — an 
exciting new option that the D90 brings to digital SLR 
photography.
Because all these functions involve some of the same but-
tons, bells, and whistles, I cover them together in this chapter. In 
addition, this chapter explains how to delete pictures that you don’t like 
and protect the ones you love from accidental erasure. (Be sure to also visit 
Chapter 9, which covers some additional ways to view your images, including 
how to create slide shows and display your photos and movies on a televi-
sion screen.)

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Enabling Automatic Picture Rotation
When you take a picture, the camera can record the image orientation — 
whether you held the camera normally, creating a horizontally oriented 
image, or turned the camera on its side to shoot a vertically oriented photo. 
This bit of data is simply added into the picture file.
During playback, the camera reads the data and automatically rotates the 
image so that it appears in the upright position, as shown on the left in 
Figure 4-1. The image is also automatically rotated when you view it in Nikon 
ViewNX, Capture NX 2, and some other photo programs that can interpret 
the data.
 
 
Figure 4-1: You can display vertically oriented pictures in their upright position (left) or 
 
sideways (right).
 
Official photo lingo uses the term portrait orientation to refer to vertically 
oriented pictures and landscape orientation to refer to horizontally oriented 
pictures.
Automatic rotation is turned on by default with the D90. But if you prefer to 
turn the feature off, you can. Your vertically oriented pictures then appear 
sideways, as shown on the right in Figure 4-1.
To check or adjust the status of automatic rotation, you need to visit two 
menus:
 
1. On the Setup menu, select Auto Image Rotation, as shown in the left 
image in Figure 4-2.
 
 You need to scroll to the second screen of the menu to get to the Auto 
Image Rotation option. If you select On, the rotation data is added to the 
picture file. Select Off to leave the data out.

81
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
 
Figure 4-2: Visit the Setup and Playback menus to enable image rotation.
 
2. Display the Playback menu and select the Rotate Tall option, as shown 
on the right in Figure 4-2.
 
 Select On if you want the camera to read the orientation data and rotate 
vertical pictures. Select Off if you prefer not to rotate the photos during 
playback. The images are still rotated automatically in photo programs 
that can read the orientation data in the file.
 
Shooting with the lens pointing directly up or down sometimes confuses the 
camera, causing it to record the wrong data in the file. If that issue bothers 
you, turn off Auto Image Rotation on the Setup menu before you shoot the 
pictures. The camera then won’t record the orientation information as part of 
the picture file.
Disabling and Adjusting Instant Review
After you take a picture, it automatically appears briefly on the camera moni-
tor. By default, this instant-review period lasts four seconds. But you can cus-
tomize this behavior in two ways:
 
✓ Adjust the length of the instant-review period: Display the Custom 
Setting menu, highlight the Timers/AE Lock submenu, and then press OK 
to display the screen shown on the left in Figure 4-3. Highlight Monitor 
Off Delay and press OK again to get to the second screen in the figure. 
Highlight Playback and then press the Multi Selector right to access the 
timing options (not shown in the figure). You have six choices, ranging 
from four seconds to 10 minutes. Highlight the timing option you want to 
use and then press OK to lock in your choice.

82
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 
Figure 4-3: To adjust the length of the instant-review period, visit the Custom Setting menu.
 
✓ Disable instant review: Because 
any monitor use is a strain on 
battery power, consider turning 
off instant review altogether 
if your battery is running low. 
You turn off the feature via the 
Image Review option on the 
Playback menu, shown in 
Figure 4-4. To turn off the feature, 
first display the Playback menu. 
Then highlight Image Review, as 
shown in Figure 4-4. Press OK, 
highlight Off, and press OK once 
more. You can still view your 
pictures by pressing the Playback 
button at any time.
Viewing Images in Playback Mode
To take a look at the pictures on your camera memory card, take these 
steps:
 
1. If you created custom image folders, specify which ones you want to 
view. Otherwise, skip to Step 2.
 
 Your D90 normally organizes pictures automatically into folders that are 
assigned generic names: 100NCD90, 101NCD90, and so on. You can see 
the name of the current folder by looking at the Active Folder option on 
the Shooting menu. (The default folder name appears as just NCD90 on 
the menu.)
Figure 4-4: Head for the Playback menu to 
disable instant review altogether.

83
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
 You also can create custom folders through that same menu option. 
(See Chapter 11 for specifics.) If you do, you need to tell the camera 
whether you want to view only pictures in the current folder or in all 
folders. To do so, display the Playback menu and highlight Playback 
Folder, as shown on the left in Figure 4-5. Press OK to display the 
screen shown on the right in the figure. Select All to view all folders; 
select Current to view only the active folder. Press OK to exit the 
screen.
 
 
Figure 4-5: If you create custom folders, specify which folder you want to view.
 
 Again, this step applies only if you create custom folders. If you let the 
camera handle all folder-creation duties, you can view all pictures on the 
card regardless of the Playback Folder setting.
 
 
2. Press the Playback button, labeled in Figure 4-6.
 
 The monitor displays the last picture you took, along with some picture 
data, such as the frame number of the photo. To find out how to inter-
pret the picture information and specify what data you want to see, see 
the upcoming section “Viewing Picture Data.” 
 
3. To scroll through your pictures, rotate the main command dial or 
press the Multi Selector right or left.
 
 I highlighted the dial and Multi Selector in Figure 4-6.
 
4. To return to picture-taking mode, press the shutter button halfway 
and then release it.
 
These steps assume that the camera is currently set to display a single photo 
at a time, as shown in Figure 4-6. You can also display multiple images at a 
time, as explained next.

Viewing multiple images at a time
 
 Along with viewing images one at a time, you can choose to display 4, 9, or 72 
thumbnails, as shown in Figure 4-7. Just press the ISO button, shown in the 
margin here and labeled Zoom out/Thumbnail display in Figure 4-6. Press 
once to cycle from single-picture view to 4-thumbnail view, press again to 
shift to 9-picture view, and press once more to bring up those itty-bitty 
thumbnails featured in 72-image view. Press yet again, and you shift to 
Calendar view, a nifty feature explained in the next section.
 
 To reduce the number of thumbnails, press the Qual button, shown clinging 
to the margin here and labeled Zoom In in Figure 4-6. Or to jump immediately 
to single-frame view without having to cycle back through all the display 
modes, just press the OK button.

Selected photo
 
Figure 4-7: You can view 4, 9, or 72 thumbnails at once.
In any of the thumbnail display modes, use these techniques to navigate your 
photo collection:
 
✓ Scroll through your pictures. Rotate the main command dial or press 
the Multi Selector right or left.
 
✓ Select an image. As you scroll through your pictures, a yellow highlight 
box indicates the currently selected image. For example, in Figure 4-7, 
Image 52 is selected. To select a different image, use the main command 
dial or Multi Selector to scroll the display until the highlight box sur-
rounds the image.
 
✓ View the selected image at the full-frame size. Press the OK button. 
 
 After you return to full-frame view, pressing OK displays the Retouch 
menu over your photo. See Chapter 10 for a look at some of the picture 
fixes you can apply to your photo from the Retouch menu.

Displaying photos in Calendar view
In Calendar display mode, you see a little calendar on the monitor, as shown 
on the left in Figure 4-8. By selecting a date on the calendar, you can quickly 
navigate to all pictures you shot on that day. (An empty date indicates that 
your memory card doesn’t contain any photos from that day.)
 
 
Figure 4-8: Calendar view makes it easy to view all photos shot on a particular day.
 
 The key to navigating Calendar view is the ISO button:
 
 
1. Press the ISO button as needed to cycle through the thumbnail display 
modes until you reach Calendar view.
 
 If you’re currently viewing images in full-frame view, for example, you 
need to press the button four times to get to Calendar view.
 
2. Using the Multi Selector or main command dial, move the yellow high-
light box over a date that contains an image.
 
 In Figure 4-8, for example, the 25th day of October is selected. (The 
number of the month appears in the top-left corner of the screen.) After 
you select a date, the right side of the monitor displays a vertical strip of 
thumbnails of pictures taken on that date.
 
3. To view all thumbnails from the selected date, press the ISO button 
again.
 
 Now the vertical thumbnail strip becomes active, and you can scroll 
through the thumbnails by pressing the Multi Selector up and down. A 
second highlight box appears in the thumbnail strip to indicate the cur-
rently selected image.

87
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
 
4. To temporarily display a larger 
view of the selected thumbnail, 
hold down the Qual button.
 
 The image filename appears 
under the larger preview, as 
shown in Figure 4-9. When you 
release the button, the large pre-
view disappears, and the calen-
dar comes back into view.
 
5. To jump back to the calendar 
and select a different date, press 
the ISO button again.
 
 You can just keep pressing the 
button to jump between the cal-
endar and the thumbnail strip as 
much as you want.
 
6. To exit Calendar view and return to single-image view, press OK.
 
 If you press OK while a date is selected, the camera displays the first 
picture taken on that day in single-image view. Pressing OK while the 
thumbnail strip is active displays the currently selected photo instead. 
Either way, if you want to return to Calendar view, you have to press the 
ISO button four times to cycle from full-frame view through the different 
thumbnail display modes.
Zooming in for a closer view
After displaying a photo in single-frame view, you can magnify it so that you 
can get a close-up look at important details, such as whether someone’s eyes 
are closed in a portrait. Here’s the scoop:
 
 
✓ Zoom in. Press the Qual button, shown in the margin here. You can mag-
nify the image to a maximum of 13 to 27 times its original display size, 
depending on the resolution (pixel count) of the photo. Just keep press-
ing the button until you reach the magnification you want.
 
 Note the magnifying glass icon on the button face — the plus sign in the 
middle is your reminder that this button enlarges the image in playback 
mode. (In shooting mode, the button accesses the Image Quality and 
Size settings, thus its official text label.)
 
✓ View another part of the magnified picture. When an image is magni-
fied, a little navigation thumbnail showing the entire image appears 
briefly in the lower-right corner of the monitor, as shown in Figure 4-10. 
Figure 4-9: Press and hold the Qual button 
to temporarily view the selected image at a 
larger size.

88
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
The yellow outline in this picture-
in-picture image indicates the 
area that’s currently consuming 
the rest of the monitor space. Use 
the Multi Selector to scroll the 
yellow box and display a different 
portion of the image. After a few 
seconds, the navigation thumb-
nail disappears; just press the 
Multi Selector in any direction to 
redisplay it.
 
✓ Inspect faces. See that little black 
rectangle labeled Face Detection 
symbol in Figure 4-10? It indicates 
that the camera thinks that the 
picture is a portrait and thus 
placed little white boxes over 
what it perceives to be faces in 
the picture-in-picture thumbnail. 
If you see this symbol, you can 
rotate the subcommand dial (on 
the front of the camera, under-
neath the shutter button) to 
automatically zoom the display 
to one of those faces, as shown in 
Figure 4-11. Keep rotating the dial 
to view other faces in the picture. 
Understand, though, that the 
camera isn’t always successful in 
detecting faces, so on occasion 
you may need to zoom and scroll 
the display manually.
 
✓ View more images at the same 
magnification. Here’s another 
neat trick: While the display is 
zoomed, you can rotate the main command dial to display the same area 
of the next photo at the same magnification. So if you shot the same sub-
ject several times, you can easily check how the same details appear in 
each one.
 
 
✓ Zoom out. To zoom out to a reduced magnification, press the ISO 
button, shown in the margin here. This button also sports the magnify-
ing glass symbol, but this time with a minus sign to indicate that it 
reduces the display size. That little grid-like thingy next to the magnify-
ing glass reminds you that the button also comes into play when you

Sensitivity control, an exposure feature covered in Chapter 5.)
 
✓ Return to full-frame view. When you’re ready to return to the normal 
magnification level, you don’t need to keep pressing the ISO button until 
you’re all the way zoomed out. Instead, just press the OK button, which 
quickly returns you to the standard, full-frame view.
Viewing Picture Data
In single-image picture view, you can choose from five Photo Information 
modes, each of which presents a different set of shooting data along with the 
image. To cycle between the different modes, press the Multi Selector up or 
down.
 
Note, though, that three of the five modes are disabled by default. To enable 
them, display the Playback menu and highlight Display Mode, as shown on 
the left in Figure 4-12. Press OK to display the second screen you see in the 
figure. To toggle a display mode on, highlight it and then press the Multi 
Selector right. A check mark then appears in the box for the selected option. 
After turning on the options you want to use, highlight Done and press OK 
again to return to the Playback menu. If you decide that you don’t care for 
one of these three modes, just reverse the process.
 
 
Figure 4-12: You must enable some of the information display modes via the Playback menu.
The next sections explain exactly what details you can glean from each dis-
play mode. I present them here in the order they appear if you cycle through 
the modes by pressing the Multi Selector down. You can spin through the 
modes in the other direction by pressing the Multi Selector up.

discussed in Chapter 1, does erase even protected pictures.) This area 
appears empty if you didn’t apply protection.
 
✓ Retouch Indicator: This icon appears if you used any of the Retouch 
menu options to alter the image. (I cover most Retouch features in 
Chapter 10.) Again, no icon means that you didn’t retouch the photo.

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
Underneath the image, you can view these details:
 
✓ Folder Name: Folders are named automatically by the camera unless you 
create custom folders, an advanced trick you can explore in Chapter 11. 
The first camera-created folder is named 100NCD90. Each folder can con-
tain up to 9999 images; when you exceed that limit, the camera creates 
a new folder and assigns the next folder number: 101NCD90, 102NCD90, 
and so on.
 
✓ Filename: The camera also automatically names your files. Filenames end 
with a three-letter code that represents the file format, which is either JPG 
(for JPEG) or NEF (for Camera Raw) for still photos. Chapter 3 discusses 
these two formats. If you record a movie (a project you can explore near 
the end of this chapter), the file extension is AVI, which represents a 
digital-movie file format. If you create a dust-off reference image file, an 
advanced feature designed for use with Nikon Capture NX 2, the camera 
instead uses the extension NDF. (Because this software must be pur-
chased separately, I don’t cover it or the dust-off function in this book.)
 
 The first three letters of filenames also vary. Here’s what the possible 
three-letter codes indicate:
 
• DSC: This code means normal, plain-old picture file. 
 
• SSC: This trio appears at the beginning of files that you create with 
the Small Picture option on the Retouch menu. Chapter 9 discusses 
this feature.
 
• CSC: This code is used for images that you alter using other 
Retouch menu features. For example, I applied the D-Lighting cor-
rection feature to the image in Figure 4-13, so the filename begins 
with CSC, and the Retouch Indicator appears in the top-left corner 
of the monitor.
 
• _ (underscore): If you change the Color Space setting on the Shooting 
menu to the Adobe RGB color profile, a topic you can investigate 
in Chapter 6, an underscore character precedes the filename. (The 
exception is for dust-off reference photos, which don’t use the under-
score.) For photos taken in the default color profiles (sRGB), the 
underscore appears after the three-letter code, as in DSC_.
 
 Each image is also assigned a four-digit file number, starting with 0001. 
When you reach image 9999, the file numbering restarts at 0001, and the 
new images go into a new folder to prevent any possibility of overwriting 
the existing image files. For more information about file numbering, see 
the Chapter 1 section that discusses the File Number Sequence option.
 
✓ Date and Time: Just below the folder and filename info, you see the 
date and time that you took the picture. Of course, the accuracy of this 
data depends on whether you set the camera’s date and time values cor-
rectly, which you do via the Setup menu. Chapter 1 has details.

92
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Image Quality: Here you can see which Image Quality setting you used 
when taking the picture. Again, Chapter 3 has details, but the short story 
is this: Fine, Normal, and Basic are the three JPEG recording options, 
with Fine representing the highest JPEG quality. The word Raw indicates 
that the picture was recorded in the Nikon Camera Raw format, NEF.
 
✓ Image Size: This value tells you the image resolution, or pixel count. See 
Chapter 3 to find out about resolution.
RGB Histogram mode
Press the Multi Selector down to shift from File Information mode to this 
mode, which displays your image in the manner shown in Figure 4-14. 
(Remember: You can view your picture in this mode only if you enable it via 
the Display Mode option on the Playback menu. See “Viewing Picture Data,” 
earlier in this chapter, for help.) 
 
Brightness histogram
RGB histogram
 
Figure 4-14: Histogram mode presents exposure 
 
and color information in chart-like fashion.
Underneath the image thumbnail, you see just a few pieces of data. As with 
File Information mode, you see the Protect Status and Retouch Indicator 
icons if you used those features. Beneath that, you see the White Balance 
settings used for the shot. (White balance is a color feature you can explore 
in Chapter 6.) Along the bottom row of the display, you see the camera name 
along with the Frame Number/Total Pictures data, also part of the standard 
File Information display data. 

93
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
The core of this display mode, though, are those chart-like thingies, officially 
called histograms. You actually get two types of histograms: The top one 
is a Brightness histogram; the three others are collectively called an RGB 
histogram.
 
 The next two sections explain what you can discern from the histograms. 
But first, here’s a cool trick to remember: If you press the Qual button while 
in this display mode, you can zoom the thumbnail to a magnified view. The 
histograms then update to reflect only the magnified area of the photo. To 
return to the regular view and once again see the whole-image histogram, 
press OK.
Reading a Brightness histogram
You can get an idea of image exposure by viewing your photo on the camera 
monitor. But if you adjust the brightness of the monitor or the ambient light 
affects the display brightness, you may not get the real story. The Brightness 
histogram provides a way to gauge exposure that’s a little more reliable.
Labeled in Figure 4-14 and shown enlarged in Figure 4-15, the Brightness 
histogram indicates the distribution of shadows, highlights, and midtones 
(areas of medium brightness) in your image. 
The horizontal axis of the histogram 
represents the possible picture bright-
ness values — the maximum tonal range, 
in photography-speak — from the dark-
est shadows on the left to the brightest 
highlights on the right. And the vertical 
axis shows you how many pixels fall at 
a particular brightness value. A spike 
indicates a heavy concentration of pixels. 
For example, in Figure 4-15, the histogram 
shows a large supply of pixels clustered in 
the range just above medium brightness, 
but very few in the deepest shadows. 
 
Keep in mind that there is no one “per-
fect” histogram that you should try to 
achieve. Instead, interpret the histogram with respect to the distribution of 
shadows, highlights, and midtones that comprise your subject. You wouldn’t 
expect to see lots of shadows, for example, in a photo of a polar bear walking 
on a snowy landscape. Pay attention, however, if you see a very high concen-
tration of pixels at the far right or left end of the histogram, which can indi-
cate a seriously overexposed or underexposed image, respectively. To find 
out how to resolve exposure problems, visit Chapter 5.

Highlights

Understanding RGB histograms
When you view your images in RGB 
Histogram display mode, you see two 
histograms: the Brightness histogram, 
covered in the preceding section, and an 
RGB histogram, shown in close-up view in 
Figure 4-16.
 
To make sense of the RGB histogram, you 
first need to know that digital images are 
called RGB images because they are cre-
ated out of three primary colors of light: 
red, green, and blue. The RGB histogram 
shows you the brightness values for each 
of those primary colors.
By checking the brightness levels of the 
individual color components, sometimes 
referred to as color channels, you can 
assess the picture’s color saturation 
levels. If most of the pixels for one or more 
channels are clustered toward the right 
end of the histogram, colors may be over-
saturated, which destroys detail. On the 
flip side, a heavy concentration of pixels at 
the left end of the histogram indicates an 
image that may be undersaturated.
A savvy RGB histogram reader also can spot color-balance issues by look-
ing at the pixel values. But frankly, color-balance problems are fairly easy to 
notice just by looking at the image itself on the camera monitor. And under-
standing how to translate the histogram data for this purpose requires more 
knowledge about RGB color theory than I have room to present in this book.
For information about manipulating color, see Chapter 6.
Highlight display mode
One of the most difficult photo problems to correct in a photo editing pro-
gram is known as blown highlights in some circles and clipped highlights in 
others. In plain English, both terms mean that highlights — the brightest 
areas of the image — are so overexposed that areas that should include 
Less saturated
More saturated
Figure 4-16: The RGB histogram can 
indicate problems with color saturation.

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
a variety of light shades are instead totally white. For example, in a cloud 
image, pixels that should be light to very light gray become white due to 
overexposure, resulting in a loss of detail in those clouds.
In Highlight display mode, areas that are totally white blink in the camera 
monitor. Like RGB Histogram mode, the Highlight mode is provided because 
simply viewing the image isn’t always a reliable way to gauge exposure. To 
use it, however, you must follow the instructions laid out in the earlier sec-
tion “Viewing Picture Data” to enable the mode.
Along with the blinking highlight 
warning, Highlight display mode 
presents the standard bits of informa-
tion in this mode: the Protect Status, 
Retouch Indicator, and File Number/
Total Pictures values, all explained in 
the earlier section “File Information 
mode.” The label Highlights also 
appears to let you know the current 
display mode, as shown in Figure 4-17.
 
I suggest that you check both the 
Brightness histogram offered in RGB 
Histogram display mode and the 
Highlight display, though, when you’re 
concerned about overexposure. If an 
image contains only a small area of blown highlights, the histogram may indi-
cate a very small pixel population at the brightest end of the spectrum, lead-
ing you to assume that you’re okay in the exposure department. But if those 
blown highlights happen to fall in an important part of your image — some-
one’s face, for example — they can wreck your picture.
Shooting Data display mode
 
Before you can access this mode, you must enable it via the Display Mode 
option on the Playback menu. See the earlier section, “Viewing Picture Data,” 
for details. After turning on the option, press the Multi Selector down to shift 
from Highlights mode to Shooting Data mode.
In this mode, you can view three screens of information, which you toggle 
between by pressing the Multi Selector up and down. Figure 4-18 shows you the 
three screens, referred to in the Nikon manual as Shooting Data Page 1, 2, and 3. 
Figure 4-17: In Highlight mode, blinking areas 
indicate blown highlights.

Figure 4-18: You can view the camera settings used to capture the image in Shooting Data 
 
display mode.
Most of the data here won’t make any sense to you until you explore 
Chapters 5 and 6, which explain the exposure, color, and other advanced 
settings available on your camera. But I do want to call your attention to a 
couple of factoids now:
 
✓ The top-left corner of the monitor shows the Protect Status and Retouch 
Indicator icons, if you used the protect or retouch features. Otherwise, 
the area is empty. (See the earlier section “File Information Mode” for 
details about these particular features.)
 
✓ The current frame number, followed by the total number of images on 
the memory card, appears in the lower-right corner of the display.
 
✓ The Comment item, which is the final item on the third screen, contains 
a value if you use the Image Comment feature on the Setup menu. I cover 
this option in Chapter 11.
 
✓ If the ISO value on Shooting Data Page 1 (the first screen in Figure 4-17) 
appears in red, the camera is letting you know that it overrode the ISO 
Sensitivity setting that you selected in order to produce a good expo-
sure. This shift occurs only if you enable automatic ISO adjustment. See 
Chapter 5 for details.

97
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
GPS Data mode
This display mode is available only if the image you’re viewing was shot with 
the optional Nikon GPS (Global Positioning System) attached.
If you use the GPS unit, this display mode shows you the latitude, longitude, 
and altitude information recorded with the image file. You also see the date 
and time of the shot along with the standard Frame Number/Total Pictures 
numbers, the Protect Status icon, and the Retouch Indicator icon, all explained 
in the earlier section “File Information mode.” The data screen appears in the 
same fashion as in Shooting Data mode, superimposed over your image.
Overview Data mode
This mode is the second of the two default photo-information modes. (Meaning, 
you don’t have to enable it via the Display Mode option on the Playback menu to 
use it.) In this mode, the playback screen contains a small image thumbnail along 
with scads of shooting data — although not quite as much as Shooting Data 
mode — plus a Brightness histogram. Figure 4-19 offers a look.

Figure 4-19: In Overview Data mode, you can view your 
 
picture along with the major camera settings you used 
 
to take the picture.
The earlier section “Reading a Brightness histogram” tells you what to make 
of that part of the screen. Just above the histogram, you see the Protect 
Status and Retouch Indicator, while the Frame Number/Total Pictures data 
appears in the upper right-corner of the image thumbnail. For details on that

data, see the earlier section “File Information mode.” (As always, the Protect 
status and Retouch Indicator icons appear only if you used those two fea-
tures; otherwise, the area is empty.)
To sort out the maze of other information, the following list breaks things 
down into the five rows that appear under the image thumbnail and histo-
gram. In the accompanying figures, I include all possible data simply for the 
purposes of illustration; if any of the items don’t appear on your screen, it 
simply means that the relevant feature wasn’t enabled when you captured 
the shot.
 
✓ Row 1: This row shows the exposure-related settings labeled in 
Figure 4-20, along with the focal length of the lens you used to take 
the shot. Chapter 5 details the exposure settings; Chapter 6 introduces 
you to focal length.
 
✓ Row 2: This row contains a few additional exposure settings, labeled in 
Figure 4-21. On the right end of the row, the Comment and GPS labels 
appear if you took advantage of those options when recording the shot. 
(You must switch to the Shooting Data mode or GPS mode, respectively, 
to view the actual comment and GPS data.)
 
✓ Row 3: The first three items on this row, labeled in Figure 4-22, relate to 
color options explored in Chapter 6. The last item indicates the Active 
D-Lighting setting, another exposure option discussed in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Rows 4 and 5: The final two rows of data (refer to Figure 4-19) show 
the same information you get in File Information mode, explained in the 
preceding section.

Hiding Photos during Playback
Let’s say that your memory card contains 100 pictures. You shot about 50 
at a meeting held during a business convention, and another 50 at the wild 
after-meeting party. You want to show your boss the ones where you and your 
co-workers look like responsible adults, but you’d rather not share the photos 
documenting your less-than-businesslike side. You could always delete the 
party photos; the next section shows you how. But if you want to keep them — 
you never know when a good blackmail picture will come in handy — you can 
simply hide those images during playback.
The key to this trick is the Hide Image option on the Playback menu. After 
highlighting the option, as shown on the left in Figure 4-23, press OK to dis-
play the right screen in the figure.
 
 
Figure 4-23: The Hide Image function lets you prevent photos from appearing during normal 
 
picture playback. 

100
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Now you have three choices — the first two let you select which photos to 
hide, and the third one brings them back from hiding:
 
✓ Select individual images to hide. 
Highlight Select/Set and press 
the Multi Selector right to dis-
play thumbnails of your photos, 
as shown in Figure 4-24. Use the 
Multi Selector to move the yellow 
box over the photo you want to 
hide.
 
 
 Next, press the ISO button, shown 
in the margin here, to tag the 
thumbnail with a little Hide Image 
icon, as shown in the figure. To 
remove the tag, just press the 
button again. 
 
 
 While you’re inspecting thumb-
nails, you can press and hold the 
Qual button to temporarily dis-
play the selected image in full-frame view. When you release the button, 
the display returns to normal thumbnail view.
 
 After you tag all the images you want to hide, press OK to return to the 
Playback menu.
 
✓ Hide all photos shot on a spe-
cific date. If all the embarrassing 
images were taken on the same 
day, you can save time by using 
the Select Date option. (Refer to 
the right screen in Figure 4-23.) 
After you choose the option, you 
see a list of dates, as shown in 
Figure 4-25. Highlight a date and 
press the Multi Selector right 
to put a checkmark in the box 
next to the date. Now all images 
from that day are hidden. To 
remove the checkmark and 
redisplay the photos, press the 
Multi Selector right again.
 
 You can view thumbnails of all the pictures taken on a date by highlight-
ing the date and pressing the ISO button. You can then temporarily dis-
play a single image at full-size view by moving the yellow highlight box 
over the image thumbnail and pressing the Qual button. To return to the 
date list view, press OK. Press OK again to return to the Playback menu.

Hide Image tag to the selected photo.
Figure 4-25: You can quickly hide all photos

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
✓ Redisplay all hidden images. To redisplay all hidden pictures quickly, 
choose Deselect All from the Hide Image screen. Press the Multi Selector 
right to display a screen that asks you to confirm your decision. 
Highlight Yes and press OK to make it so.
 
A couple of fine points about this feature: First, your hidden images remain 
viewable from within the Hide Image screens. (So make sure your boss 
doesn’t have time alone with your camera.) Second, if you want to delete 
hidden photos by using the Delete feature, explained next, you first need 
to remove the Hide Image tags. Or you can format your memory card, 
which wipes out all photos, hidden or not. See Chapter 1 for details on 
card formatting.
Deleting Photos
You can erase pictures from a memory card when it’s in your camera in three 
ways. The next sections give you the lowdown. (Or is it the down low? I can’t 
seem to keep up.)
 
If you hid an image by using the Hide Image feature or locked the file by using 
the Protect feature, you must remove the Hide Image or Protect tag from the 
file before you can delete the image. Details about hiding and protecting files 
are lurking elsewhere in this chapter. 
Deleting images one at a time
 
 The Delete button is key to erasing single images. But the process varies a 
little depending on which Playback display mode you’re using, as follows:
 
✓ In single-image view, you can erase the current image by pressing the 
Delete button.
 
✓ In thumbnail view (displaying 4, 9, or 72 thumbnails), use the Multi 
Selector to highlight the picture you want to erase and then press the 
Delete button.
 
✓ In Calendar view, first highlight the date that contains the image. Then 
press the ISO button to jump to the scrolling list of thumbnails, highlight 
a specific image, and press Delete.
After you press Delete, you see a message asking whether you really want to 
erase the picture. If you do, press the Delete button again. Or, to cancel out 
of the process, press the Playback button.
See the earlier section, “Viewing Images in Playback Mode,” for more details 
about the display modes.

102
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
If you accidentally erase a picture, don’t panic — you may be able to restore 
it by using data-restoration software such as MediaRecover ($30, www.
mediarecover.com) or Lexar Image Rescue (also about $30, www.lexar.com). 
But in order to have a chance, you must not take any more pictures or per-
form any other operations on your camera while the current memory card is 
in it. If you do, you may overwrite the erased picture data for good and elimi-
nate the possibility of recovering the image.
Deleting all photos
To erase all pictures, display the Playback menu and highlight Delete, as 
shown in the first image in Figure 4-26. Press OK to display the options shown 
in the second image. Highlight All and press the Multi Selector right. You 
then see a screen that asks you to verify that you want to delete all of your 
images. Select Yes and press OK.
 
 
Figure 4-26: To delete all photos, use the Delete option on the Playback menu.
 
If you create custom image folders, a feature I cover in Chapter 11, be aware 
that this step deletes only pictures in the folder that is currently selected via 
the Playback Folder option on the Playback menu. See the section “Viewing 
Images in Playback Mode,” earlier in this chapter, for information.
Deleting a batch of selected photos
To erase multiple photos — but not all of them — display the Playback 
menu, highlight Delete, and press OK. You see the Delete screen shown in the 
second image in Figure 4-26.

103
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
You then have two options for specifying which photos to erase:
 
 
✓ Select photos one-by-one. To go 
this route, highlight Selected and 
press the Multi Selector right to 
display a screen of thumbnails, as 
shown in Figure 4-27. Use the 
Multi Selector to place the yellow 
highlight box over the first photo 
you want to delete and then 
press the ISO button, shown in 
the margin here. A little trash can 
icon, the universal symbol for 
delete, appears on the thumbnail, 
as shown in the figure. If you 
change your mind, press the ISO 
button again to remove the 
Delete tag from the image.
 
 
 For a closer look at the selected 
image, press and hold the Qual button. When you release the button, the 
display returns to normal thumbnail view.
 
✓ Erase all photos taken on a specific date. This time, choose Select Date 
from the main Delete screen. Press the Multi Selector right to display 
a list of dates on which you took the pictures on the memory card. 
Highlight a date and press the Multi Selector right. A little checkmark 
appears in the box next to the date, tagging all images taken on that day 
for deletion. To remove the check mark and save the photos from the 
digital dumpster, press the Multi Selector right again.
 
 Can’t remember what photos are associated with the selected date? 
Press the ISO button to display thumbnails of all the images. You can 
then press the Qual button to temporarily view a selected thumbnail at 
full-size view. To return to the date list, press the ISO button again.
After selecting the photos or a shooting date, press OK to start the Delete 
process. You see a confirmation screen asking permission to destroy the 
images; select Yes and press OK. The camera trashes the photos and returns 
you to the Playback menu.
 
You have one alternative way to quickly erase all images taken on a specific 
date: In the Calendar display mode, you can highlight the date in question 
and then press the Delete button instead of going through the Playback 
menu. You get the standard confirmation screen asking you whether you 
want to go forward. Press the Delete button again to dump the files.
Delete icon
Figure 4-27: Use the ISO button to tag 
pictures you want to delete.

104
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Protecting Photos
You can safeguard pictures from accidental erasure by giving them protected 
status. After you take this step, the camera doesn’t allow you to erase a picture 
by using either the Delete button or the Delete option on the Playback menu.
 
Formatting your memory card, however, does erase even protected pictures. 
See the nearby sidebar for more about formatting.
The picture protection feature comes in especially handy if you share a camera 
with other people. You can protect pictures so that those other people know 
that they shouldn’t delete your super-great images to make room on the memory 
card for their stupid, badly photographed ones. (This step isn’t foolproof, 
though, because anyone can remove the protected status from an image.)
 
Perhaps more importantly, when you protect a picture, it shows up as a read-
only file when you transfer it to your computer. Files that have that read-only 
status can’t be altered. Again, anyone with some computer savvy can remove 
the status, but this feature can keep casual users from messing around with your 
images after you’ve downloaded them to your system. Of course, you have to 
know how to remove the read-only status yourself if you plan on editing your 
photo in your photo software. (Hint: In Nikon ViewNX, you can do this by click-
ing the image thumbnail and then choosing File➪Protect Files➪Unprotect.)
Deleting versus formatting: What’s the diff?
In Chapter 1, I introduce you to the Format 
Memory Card command, which lives on the 
Setup menu and erases everything on your 
memory card. What’s the difference between 
erasing photos by formatting and by choosing 
Delete from the Playback menu and then select-
ing the All option?
Well, first, if you happen to have stored other 
data on the card, such as, say, a music file or 
a picture taken on another type of camera, you 
need to format the card to erase everything on 
it. You can’t view those files on the monitor, so 
you can’t use Delete to get rid of them.
Also keep in mind that the Delete function 
affects only the currently selected folder of 
camera images. As long as you use the default 
folder system that the camera creates for you, 
however, “currently selected folder” is the same 
as “all images.” The section “Viewing Images 
in Playback Mode,” earlier in this chapter, talks 
more about this issue; Chapter 11 explains how 
to create custom folders.
One final — and important — note: Although 
using the Protect feature (explained elsewhere 
in this chapter) prevents the Delete function 
from erasing a picture, formatting erases all 
pictures, protected or not. Formatting also 
wipes out any photos you hid by using the Hide 
Image feature.

105
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
Anyway, protecting a picture is easy: 
 
1. Display or select the picture you want to protect.
 
• In single-image view, just display the photo.
 
• In 4/9/72 thumbnail mode, use the Multi Selector as needed to 
place the yellow highlight box over the photo.
 
• In Calendar view, highlight the date that contains the image and 
then press the ISO button to jump to the scrolling list of thumb-
nails. Then move the highlight box over the image.
 
 
2. Press the WB button.
 
 See the tiny key symbol that 
appears on the button? That’s 
your reminder that you use the 
button to lock a picture. After 
you press the button, the same 
symbol appears on the image 
display, as shown in Figure 4-28.
 
3. To remove protection, display or 
select the image and press the 
WB button again.
 
One word of caution: If you apply the 
Hide Image tag to a photo as well 
as the Protect tag and you then 
remove the Hide Image tag, you 
also remove the Protect tag. See the earlier section “Hiding Photos during 
Playback” for an explanation of the Hide Image feature.
Exploring Live View Shooting
If you’ve used a compact, point-and-shoot digital camera, you may be used 
to composing your pictures on the camera monitor rather than by looking 
through the viewfinder. In fact, many compact cameras no longer even offer 
a viewfinder, which is a real shame, in my opinion. Why? Because when you 
use the monitor to frame the image, you must hold the camera away from 
your body, a posture that increases the likelihood of blurry images caused 
by camera shake. When you use the viewfinder, you can brace the camera 
against your face, creating a steadier shooting stance.
Due to some design complexities that I won’t bore you with, most digital SLR 
cameras do not enable you to preview shots on the monitor. Your D90, how-
ever, does offer that feature, known as Live View in dSLR nomenclature. The 
D90 also uses Live View when you record movies.
Protect icon

accidental deletion of the selected image.

106
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
You need to know a few points about Live View as it’s provided on your camera:
 
✓ Manual focusing is recommended. You can autofocus, but manual focusing 
usually offers faster, more precise results. And if you don’t use a Nikon AF-S 
lens, the camera may have difficulty autofocusing at all in Live View mode. 
See Chapter 1 for an explanation of AF-S and other lens types.
 
✓ Continuous autofocusing isn’t possible. In normal shooting, you can set 
the camera to continually adjust focus automatically up to the moment 
you fully depress the shutter button to record your picture. (See 
Chapter 6 for details.) This autofocus feature helps ensure that moving 
subjects remain sharply focused even after you initially establish focus 
by pressing the shutter button halfway.
 
 When you use autofocus in Live View mode, focus is always locked when 
you press the shutter button halfway. For still photography, you can 
always release the button and reset focus if needed, assuming that your 
subject isn’t moving so quickly that you don’t have time to do so. But 
when you use autofocusing in movie mode, you can’t adjust the focus 
point after recording begins. (Some lenses, however, do enable you to 
twist the manual focusing ring after setting focus initially with autofocus; 
check your lens manual to find out if you have that option.) 
 
✓ You can’t access the Shooting Information display. You can still view 
camera settings on the control panel, however, and a few settings are 
displayed with the image on the monitor.
 
✓ You must establish the exposure metering mode before switching to 
Live View mode. You can’t change this exposure control, explained in 
Chapter 5, without shifting out of Live View mode.
 
✓ You must be extra careful to keep the camera steady. Just as with a point-
and-shoot camera, holding the camera out in front of you to capture the 
image can cause camera shake that can blur your image. But with an SLR, 
the risk is greater because of the added weight of the camera and lens. And 
if you use a so-called long lens — a telephoto or zoom lens that extends to 
a long focal length — the potential for camera shake is compounded. So for 
best results, mount the camera on a tripod when you use Live View.
 
✓ Using Live View for an extended period can harm your pictures and 
the camera. When you work in Live View mode, the camera’s innards 
heat up more than usual, and that extra heat can create the right elec-
tronic conditions for noise, a defect that gives your pictures a speckled 
look. (Chapter 5 offers more information.)
 
 Perhaps more critically, the increased temperatures can damage the 
camera itself. For that reason, Live View is automatically disabled after 
one hour of shooting — or earlier, if a critical heat level is detected. In 
extremely warm environments, you may not be able to use Live View 
mode for very long before the system shuts down. 

107
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
✓ Aiming the lens at the sun or other bright lights also can damage the 
camera. Of course, you can cause problems doing this even during normal 
shooting, but the possibilities increase when you use Live View. You not 
only can harm the camera’s internal components but also the monitor.
 
Live View also presents the two additional disadvantages which, in this case, 
are the same as for a point-and-shoot camera. First, any time you use the moni-
tor, you put extra strain on the battery. So keep an eye on the battery status 
icon to avoid running out of juice at a critical moment. Second, the monitor can 
wash out in bright sunlight, making it difficult to compose outdoor shots.
This list of caveats doesn’t mean that I’m telling you not to use Live View. 
But for normal photography — that is, still shooting rather than movie 
recording — you shouldn’t envision Live View as a full-time alternative to 
using the viewfinder. Rather, think of it as a special-purpose tool that can 
help in situations where framing with the viewfinder is cumbersome.
 
I find Live View most helpful for still-life, tabletop photography, especially in 
cases that require a lot of careful arrangement of the scene. For example, I 
have a shooting table that’s about waist high. Normally, I put my camera on a 
tripod, come up with an initial layout of the objects I want to photograph, set 
up my lights, and then check the scene through the viewfinder. Then there’s 
a period of refining the object placement, the lighting, and so on. If I’m shoot-
ing from a high angle, requiring the camera to be positioned above the table 
and pointing downward, I have to stand on my tiptoes or get a stepladder to 
check things out through the viewfinder between each compositional or light-
ing change. At lower angles, where the camera is tabletop height or below, I 
have to either bend over or kneel to look through the viewfinder, causing no 
end of later aches and pains to back and knees. With Live View, I can alleviate 
much of that bothersome routine (and pain) because I can usually see how 
things look in the monitor no matter what the camera position.
With that lengthy preamble out of the way, the following section provides a 
primer in standard Live View shooting. Following that, you can find details about 
movie recording and discover a few ways to customize the Live View display.
Taking pictures in Live View mode
The following steps walk you through the process of Live View photography. 
For reasons explained in the preceding introduction to Live View shooting, 
manual focusing is recommended, so the steps assume that you stick with 
that focusing choice. 
 
1. Open the Custom Setting menu, select the Autofocus submenu, and set 
the Live View Autofocus option to Normal Area or Wide Area.
 
 Okay, I know I just said that these steps assume that you’re going to 
focus manually. But for reasons I won’t get into, setting the Live View 
Autofocus option to the third available choice, Face Priority, limits your 

108
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
control when you check your focus later, in Step 7. So select either of 
the other two options.
 
2. Set the camera to manual focusing mode.
 
 Chapter 1 details the process, which varies depending on the type of 
lens you use. For Nikkor AF-S lenses like the 18–105mm kit lens bundled 
with the D90, set the A/M switch on the lens to M.
 
3. If you’re not using a tripod, turn on Vibration Reduction.
 
 For the kit lens, set the VR switch on the lens to On.
 
 
4. Press the Lv button on the camera back.
 
 You hear a clicking sound as the camera shifts to Live View. The scene 
in front of the lens appears on the monitor, as shown in Figure 4-29, and 
you no longer can see anything through the viewfinder.

Figure 4-29: In Live View mode, you can compose your image on the monitor.
 
 Along with your image, you see a bunch of shooting data. You can con-
trol what data is displayed by adjusting the settings explained in the last 
section of this chapter. But in the default view, shown in the figure, you 
see the following information:

109
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
• The bottom of the screen displays the metering mode, shutter 
speed, aperture, and ISO Sensitivity settings. (Chapter 5 details 
these settings.) The Shots Remaining value tells you how many 
more pictures will fit on the memory card.
 
• One row up, a few symbols appear to remind you what buttons to 
push to activate certain functions. For example, the first symbol 
indicates that you can adjust monitor brightness by pressing the 
Playback button, as described at the end of this chapter.
 
• The icon in the upper-left corner represents the exposure mode 
(Auto, P, A, Portrait, and so on).
 
• The upper-right corner displays the current Image Size, Image 
Quality, and White Balance settings. (Chapter 3 explains the 
first two; Chapter 6 explains White Balance.) The remaining two 
symbols, not labeled in Figure 4-29, relate to movie recording, 
explained in the next section.
 
• The red rectangle, labeled Autofocus frame in the figure appears as 
a result of choosing the Wide Area autofocusing option in Step 1. If 
you instead select Normal Area, you see a smaller rectangle. More 
on what you actually do with that rectangle in Step 7.
 
 The figure shows the default monitor setup; you can adjust what data is 
displayed by using the options explained at the end of this chapter. 
 
5. Frame the shot.
 
6. Turn the lens focusing ring to set initial focus.
 
 
7. Press the Qual button to magnify the view and refine focus, if needed.
 
 Pressing the button zooms the display, with each press giving you a 
closer look at the shot. As when you magnify an image when you’re view-
ing photos in Playback mode, a small thumbnail in the corner of the 
monitor appears, with the yellow highlight box indicating the area that’s 
currently being magnified. To scroll the display and check another part of 
the image, press the Multi Selector to move the red focusing frame over 
the area you want to inspect. (Here’s where that Live View Autofocus set-
ting selected in Step 1 becomes important: If it’s set to Face Priority, you 
can’t scroll the display to view specific parts of the picture.) 
 
 To reduce the magnification, press the ISO button. When you’re happy 
with the focus, press OK to return to full-frame view.
 
8. Press the shutter button halfway to initiate exposure metering.
 
 If needed, you can adjust exposure in P, S, and A modes by using 
Exposure Compensation. In Manual (M) exposure mode, you can adjust 
shutter speed and f-stop as usual. (Chapter 5 spells out exposure details.) 
In the fully automatic exposure modes, you can’t adjust exposure.
 
9. Depress the shutter button fully to take the shot.

110
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 You see your just-captured picture on the monitor for a few seconds, as 
usual. Then the Live View preview returns, and you’re ready to take the 
next shot.
 
 10. To exit the Live View preview, press the Lv button.
 
 You can then return to framing your images through the viewfinder.
Recording movies
Your D90 offers a first-ever feature for digital SLR cameras: the ability to 
record digital movies. Although recording live action with a D90 involves a 
few limitations and difficulties that you don’t experience with a real video 
camera, it’s a fun option to have onboard nonetheless. 
Before I give you the specifics, here’s the broad overview of D90 movie making:
 
✓ Movie quality: Select this option from the Movie Setting option on 
the Shooting menu, as shown in Figure 4-30. The settings determine 
the frame size and aspect ratio of the movie: 320 x 216 pixels, for a 3:2 
aspect ratio (the same aspect ratio as your D90 still images); 640 x 424, 
also a 3:2 aspect ratio; and 1280 x 720, which gives you a 16:9 aspect 
ratio, which is found on many new TV sets and computer monitors.
 
 The higher the pixel count, the larger you can display the movie on a 
TV or monitor before you see the quality of the playback deteriorate. 
But a higher Quality setting also produces a larger file, eating up more 
of your memory card, and reduces the maximum length of the movie 
you can record, as outlined next.
 
✓ Maximum movie length/file size: If you select the highest movie resolu-
tion (1280 x 720 pixels), your movie can have a maximum length of five 
minutes and a maximum file size of 2GB. At the two lower-resolution set-
tings, you’re still restricted to 2GB file sizes, but the movies can run as 
long as 20 minutes. Of course, you must have 2GB of empty memory 
card space to store the movie.
 
 
Figure 4-30: Specify movie quality and sound recording options via the Shooting menu.

111
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
✓ Frame rate: The frame rate determines the smoothness of the playback. 
At all three Quality settings, the frame rate is 24 frames per second, or 
fps. By contrast, the standard frame rate for television-quality video 
is 30 frames per second, so expect your movies to play a little less 
smoothly than your favorite sitcoms.
 
✓ Sound recording: You can record sound or shoot a silent movie; make 
the call via the Movie Settings option on the Shooting menu (shown in 
Figure 4-30).
 
 If you enable sound, note the position of the microphone: It’s the little 
three-holed area just beneath the Mode dial, on the front of the camera. 
Make sure that you don’t inadvertently cover up the microphone with 
your finger. And keep in mind that anything you say will be picked up by 
the mike along with any other audio present in the scene.
 
✓ Video format: Movies are created in the AVI format, which means you can 
play them on your computer using most movie-playback programs. If you 
want to view your movies on a TV, you can connect the camera to the TV, 
as explained in Chapter 9. Or if you have the necessary computer soft-
ware, you can convert the AVI file to a format that a standard DVD player 
can recognize and then burn the converted file to a DVD disk. You also 
can edit your movie in a program that can work with AVI files.
So far, so good. None of the aforementioned details is terribly unusual or 
complicated. Where things get a little tricky for the would-be filmmaker are in 
the areas of focus and exposure:
 
✓ Focusing: As with regular Live View photography, you can use autofo-
cusing to establish initial focus on your subject before you begin record-
ing. But after recording begins, the autofocus system lays down and 
plays dead. So unless you’re recording a static subject — say, a guitar 
player sitting on a stool or a speaker at a lectern — opt for manual focus-
ing. You can then adjust focus manually any time during the recording. 
 
 If you plan to also zoom in and out, give yourself some time to practice 
before the big event. It’s a bit of a challenge to zoom and focus at the 
same time, especially while holding the camera in front of you so that 
you can see the monitor. (A tripod makes the maneuver slightly easier.)
 
✓ Exposure: The camera automatically sets exposure based on the light 
throughout the entire scene. You can’t adjust exposure in any way, and 
any exposure options currently selected for regular photography don’t 
apply. On a more positive note, the exposure settings used by the camera 
in movie mode tend to deliver a fairly large depth of field, or zone of sharp 
focus, which means that your subject can probably move at least a short 
distance from your original focusing point and not fall too badly out of 
focus. (Chapter 5 explains how exposure settings affect depth of field.)

112
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
To try out movie recording, first set your camera to manual focusing and, if 
you’re not using a tripod, turn on Vibration Reduction (or whatever form of 
image stabilization your lens offers). Then take these steps:
 
1. Set your movie preferences through the Movie Settings option on the 
Shooting menu.
 
 The first part of this section explains your options.
 
 
2. Press the Lv button to switch to Live View mode.
 
3. Compose your shot.
 
4. Set focus.
 
 You can use the techniques outlined in the preceding section to magnify 
the display to check focus if needed.
 
5. Press OK to begin recording.
 
 A red Rec symbol begins flashing at the top of the monitor, as shown in 
Figure 4-31. As recording progresses, the area labeled Time Remaining in 
the figure shows you how many more seconds of video you will be able 
to record. (The length is dependent on the movie-quality settings you 
choose and the amount of space on your memory card.) If you enabled 
sound, you also see the microphone symbol, as shown in the figure.

6. To stop recording, press OK.
 
 
7. Press the Lv button to exit Live 
View mode and return to normal 
shooting.
To play your movie, press the Playback 
button. In single-image playback mode, 
you can spot a movie file by looking 
for the little movie-camera icon in the 
top-left corner of the screen, as shown 
in Figure 4-32. You also can view the 
length of the movie in the area indi-
cated in the figure. Press OK to start 
playback.
In the thumbnail and Calendar play-
back modes, you see little filmstrip 
dots along the edges of movie files, 
as shown in Figure 4-33. This time, 
press OK twice: once to shift to single-
image view and again to start movie 
playback.
Chapter 9 explains how to connect 
your camera to a television so you 
can play your movies “on the big 
screen.”
Customizing the Live 
View display
 
 Whether you are shooting movies or 
still photos, you can choose the fol-
lowing three Live View display styles. 
Press the Info button to cycle between the different displays. 
 
✓ Display Shooting Information: In this mode, which is the default, your 
monitor displays the data shown earlier, in Figure 4-29. (Some data 
disappears if you start recording a movie; refer to Figure 4-31.) 
 
✓ Hide Shooting Information: Select this mode to hide everything that 
normally appears atop your image except the icon that represents your 
chosen exposure mode, as shown on the left in Figure 4-34. You also 
may see the red rectangle that represents the autofocusing frame; see 
the section “Taking pictures in Live View mode” for details.

✓ Display Framing Guides: This mode displays a grid over the image, as 
shown on the right in the figure. The grid is helpful when you need to 
precisely align objects in your photo. But note that in this mode, you 
cannot zoom the display to check focusing. 
 
 
Figure 4-34: Press the Info button to change the Live View display mode.
 
 You also can adjust the brightness of 
the monitor. To do so, press and hold 
the Playback button to display a little 
brightness scale on the right side of 
the monitor, as shown in Figure 4-35. 
Press the Multi Selector up or down to 
move the brightness indicator on the 
scale. Release the Playback button to 
exit the monitor-adjustment mode and 
hide the brightness scale.
 
If you connect your camera to an HDMI 
(High-Definition Multimedia Interface) 
device, you no longer see the live scene 
on your camera monitor. Instead, the 
view is displayed on your video device. 
In that scenario, the arrangement of 
the shooting information on the screen 
is slightly different but contains the 
same basic data.

button and then press the Multi Selector up 
or down to adjust the monitor brightness in

Taking Creative 
Control

In this part . . .
A
s nice as it is to be able to set your D90 to 
automatic mode and let the camera handle 
most of the photographic decisions, I encourage 
you to also explore the advanced exposure modes 
(P, S, A, and M). In these modes, you can make 
your own decisions about the exposure, focus, 
and color characteristics of your photo, which are 
key to capturing an image as you see it in your 
mind’s eye. And don’t think that you have to be a 
genius or spend years to be successful — adding 
just a few simple techniques to your photographic 
repertoire can make a huge difference in how 
happy you are with the pictures you take.
The ﬁ rst two chapters in this part explain every-
thing you need to know to do just that, providing 
both some necessary photography fundamentals 
as well as details about using the advanced expo-
sure modes. Following that, Chapter 7 helps you 
draw together all the information presented ear-
lier in the book, summarizing the best camera set-
tings and other tactics to use when capturing 
portraits, action shots, landscapes, and close-up 
shots.

nderstanding exposure is one of the most intimi-
dating challenges for the new photographer. 
Discussions of the topic are loaded with unfamiliar, 
techy-sounding terms — aperture, metering, shutter 
speed, ISO, and the like. Add the fact that your D90 
offers oodles of exposure controls, all sporting 
equally foreign names, and it’s no wonder that 
most people throw up their hands and decide that 
their best option is to simply stick with the Auto 
exposure mode and let the camera take care of all 
exposure decisions.
You can, of course, turn out super shots in Auto mode. 
And I fully relate to the exposure confusion you may be 
feeling — I’ve been there. But from years of working with 
beginning photographers, I can promise that when you take 
things nice and slow, digesting just a piece of the exposure pie at 
a time, the topic is not nearly as complicated as it seems on the surface. And 
I guarantee that the payoff will be well worth your time and brain energy. 

118
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
You’ll not only gain the power to resolve just about any exposure problem, 
but also discover ways to use exposure to put your own creative stamp on 
a scene.
To that end, this chapter provides everything you need to know to really exploit 
your D90’s exposure options, from a primer in exposure science (it’s not as bad 
as it sounds) to explanations of all the camera’s exposure controls. In addition, 
because some controls aren’t accessible in the fully automatic exposure modes, 
this chapter also introduces you to the four advanced modes, P, S, A, and M.
Introducing the Exposure Trio: Aperture, 
Shutter Speed, and ISO
Any photograph, whether taken with a film or digital camera, is created by 
focusing light through a lens onto a light-sensitive recording medium. In a 
film camera, the film negative serves as that medium; in a digital camera, it’s 
the image sensor, which is an array of light-responsive computer chips.
Between the lens and the sensor are 
two barriers, known as the aperture 
and shutter, which together control 
how much light makes its way to 
the sensor. The actual design and 
arrangement of the aperture, shut-
ter, and sensor vary depending on 
the camera, but Figure 5-1 offers an 
illustration of the basic concept.
The aperture and shutter, along 
with a third feature known as ISO, 
determine exposure — what most of 
us would describe as the picture’s 
overall brightness and contrast. 
This three-part exposure formula 
works as follows:
 
✓ Aperture (controls amount 
of light): The aperture is an 
adjustable hole in a diaphragm set just behind the lens. By changing the 
size of the aperture, you control the size of the light beam that can enter 
the camera. Aperture settings are stated as f-stop numbers, or simply 
Image sensor

sensor.

119
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
f-stops, and are expressed with the letter f followed by a number: f/2, f5.6, 
f/16, and so on. The lower the f-stop number, the larger the aperture, and 
the more light is permitted into the camera, as illustrated by Figure 5-2.
 
 The range of possible f-stops depends on your lens and, if you use a zoom 
lens, on the zoom position (focal length) of the lens. When you use the 
18–105mm lens that Nikon bundles in the D90 kit, you can select apertures 
from f/3.5–f/22 when zoomed all the way out to the shortest focal length, 
18mm. When you zoom in to the maximum focal length, 105mm, the aper-
ture range is f/5.6–f/36. (See Chapter 6 for a discussion of focal lengths.)
 
✓ Shutter speed (controls duration of light): Set behind the aperture, the 
shutter works something like, er, the shutters on a window. When you 
aren’t taking pictures, the camera’s shutter stays closed, preventing 
light from striking the image sensor, just as closed window shutters pre-
vent sunlight from entering a room. When you press the shutter button, 
the shutter opens briefly to allow light that passes through the aperture 
to hit the image sensor.
 
 The length of time that the shutter is open is called the shutter speed and 
is measured in seconds: 1/60 second, 1/250 second, 2 seconds, and so 
on. Shutter speeds on the D90 range from 30 seconds to 1/4000 second 
when you shoot without the built-in flash. If you do use the built-in flash, 
the range is more limited; some external flash heads permit a faster 
shutter speed, however. See the sidebar “In sync: Flash timing and shut-
ter speed,” later in this chapter, for information. 
 
 Should you want a shutter speed longer than 30 seconds, manual (M) 
exposure mode also provides a feature called bulb exposure. At this set-
ting, the shutter stays open indefinitely as long as you press the shutter 
button down.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ ISO (controls light sensitivity): ISO, which is a digital function rather 
than a mechanical structure on the camera, enables you to adjust how 
responsive the image sensor is to light. The term ISO is a holdover from 
film days, when an international standards organization rated each film 
stock according to light sensitivity: ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 800, and so on. 
Film or digital, a higher ISO rating means greater light sensitivity, which 
means that less light is needed to produce the image, enabling you to 
use a smaller aperture, faster shutter speed, or both.
 
 On the D90, you can select ISO settings ranging from 100 to a whop-
ping 6400. (The high and low ends of the scale are named Lo 1 and Hi 1, 
respectively.)
 
Distilled down to its essence, the image-exposure formula is just this simple: 
 
✓ Aperture and shutter speed together determine the quantity of light that 
strikes the image sensor.
 
✓ ISO determines how much the sensor reacts to that light.
The tricky part of the equation is that aperture, shutter speed, and ISO set-
tings affect your pictures in ways that go beyond exposure. You need to be 
aware of these side effects, explained in the next section, to determine which 
combination of the three exposure settings will work best for your picture.
Understanding exposure-setting side effects
You can create the same exposure with many combinations of aperture, shut-
ter speed, and ISO. You’re limited only by the aperture range allowed by the 
lens and the shutter speeds and ISO range offered by the camera.
But as I hinted in the preceding section, the settings you select impact your 
image beyond mere exposure, as follows:
 
✓ Aperture affects depth of field. The aperture setting, or f-stop, affects 
depth of field, which is the range of sharp focus in your image. I introduce 
this concept in Chapter 2, but here’s a quick recap: With a shallow depth 
of field, your subject appears more sharply focused than faraway objects; 
with a large depth of field, the sharp-focus zone spreads over a greater 
distance.
 
 As you reduce the aperture size — or stop down the aperture, in photo 
lingo — by choosing a higher f-stop number, you increase depth of field. 
As an example, take a look at the two images in Figure 5-3. For both 
shots, I established focus on the foreground grass. Notice that the 

121
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
background in the first image, taken at an aperture setting of f/5.6, 
appears noticeably softer than in the right example, taken at f/13. 
Aperture is just one contributor to depth of field, however; see 
Chapter 6 for the complete story.
 
✓ Shutter speed affects motion blur. At a slow shutter speed, moving 
objects appear blurry, whereas a fast shutter speed captures motion 
cleanly. Compare the tall foreground grass in the images in Figure 5-3, 
for example. A brisk wind was blowing when I took these pictures, and 
as a result, the foreground grass is captured without blur only at the 
1/160 second shutter speed used for the left image. How fast a shutter 
speed you need to freeze action depends on the speed of the subject, 
of course.

 Figure 5-3: Stopping down the aperture (by choosing a higher f-stop number) increases depth 
of field, or the zone of sharp focus.

122
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 If your picture suffers from over-
all image blur, as in Figure 5-4, 
where even stationary objects 
appear out of focus, the camera 
itself moved during the exposure. 
As you increase the exposure 
time (by selecting a slower shut-
ter speed), you increase the risk 
of this problem because you have 
to keep the camera still for a 
longer period of time. Most 
people enter the camera-shake 
zone at speeds slower than about 
1/50 second, although some 
people have steadier hands than 
others. I’m not one of them, as 
my 1/20 second handheld exam-
ple in Figure 5-4 shows.
 
 Some Nikon lenses, including the 
18–105mm kit lens, offer vibra-
tion reduction, which is designed 
to help compensate for small 
amounts of camera shake. If 
you’re using a lens from another 
manufacturer, the feature may go 
by the name image stabilization 
or something similar. Whatever 
you call it, this option can enable 
you to capture sharp images at slightly slower shutter speeds than 
normal when handholding the camera. On the D90 kit lens, just set the 
VR switch on the side of the lens to the On position to enable vibration 
reduction.
 
 See Chapter 6 for tips on solving other focus problems and Chapter 7 for 
more help with action photography.
 
✓ ISO affects image noise. As ISO increases, making the image sensor 
more reactive to light, you increase the risk of producing a defect called 
noise. This defect looks like sprinkles of sand and is similar in appear-
ance to film grain, a defect that often mars pictures taken with high ISO 
film. Noise can also be caused by very long exposure times.
 
 Ideally, then, you should always use the lowest ISO setting on your 
camera to ensure top image quality. But sometimes, the lighting condi-
tions simply don’t permit you to do so and still use the aperture and 
shutter speeds you need. Take the rose images in Figure 5-5, for exam-
ple. Here again, a mild breeze was blowing, so I knew I needed a fast 
f/13, 1/20 second, ISO 200
Figure 5-4: Slow shutter speeds increase the 
risk of all-over blur caused by camera shake.

123
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
shutter to capture the flower without blur. I opened the aperture to f/6.3, 
which was the maximum on the lens I was using, to allow as much light 
as possible into the camera. Even so, I needed a shutter speed of 1/40 
second to expose the picture at ISO 200 — and that shutter speed wasn’t 
fast enough to catch the swaying flower without blur, as shown on the 
left in the figure. Using the lowest ISO (ISO 100) would have made the 
situation that much worse. By raising the ISO to 400, I was able to use a 
shutter speed of 1/80 second, which captured the flower cleanly.
 
 Fortunately, you don’t encounter serious noise on the D90 until you 
really crank up the ISO. In fact, you may even be able to get away with 
ISO 3200 if you keep your print or display size small. But as with other 
image defects, noise becomes more apparent as you enlarge the photo. 
To prove the point, Figure 5-6 shows you magnified views of a bit of the 
rose scene captured at ISO 200 through 3200. Noise also is easier to spot 
in areas of flat color than in areas of busy detail or rough texture, where 
it can hide a little more. 
Long story short, understanding how aperture, shutter speed, and ISO affect 
your image enables you to have much more creative input over the look of 
your photographs — and, in the case of ISO, to also control the quality of your 
images. (Chapter 3 discusses other factors that affect image quality.)

Doing the exposure balancing act
 
As you change any of the three exposure settings — aperture, shutter speed, 
and ISO — one or both of the others must also shift in order to maintain the 
same image brightness. Say that you’re shooting a soccer game, for example, 
and you notice that although the overall exposure looks great, the players 
are appearing slightly blurry at your current shutter speed. If you raise the 
shutter speed, you have to compensate with either a larger aperture, to allow 
in more light during the shorter exposure, or a higher ISO setting, to make 
the camera more sensitive to the light — or both.
As the preceding section explains, changing these settings impacts your 
image in ways beyond exposure. As a quick reminder:
 
✓ Aperture affects depth of field, with a higher f-stop number producing a 
greater zone of sharp focus.
 
✓ Shutter speed affects whether motion of the subject or camera results in 
a blurry photo. A faster shutter “freezes” action and also helps safeguard 

125
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
against allover blur that can result from camera shake when you’re hand-
holding the camera.
 
✓ ISO affects the camera’s sensitivity to light. A higher ISO makes the camera 
more responsive to light but also increases the chance of image noise.
So when you boost that shutter speed to capture your soccer subjects, you 
have to decide whether you prefer the shorter depth of field that comes with a 
larger aperture or the increased risk of noise that accompanies a higher ISO.
Everyone has their own approach to finding the right combination of aper-
ture, shutter speed, and ISO, and you’ll no doubt develop your own system 
as you become more practiced at using the advanced exposure modes. In the 
meantime, here’s how I handle things:
 
✓ I always use the lowest possible ISO setting unless the lighting condi-
tions are so poor that I can’t use the aperture and shutter speed I want 
without raising the ISO.
 
✓ If my subject is moving (or might move, as with a squiggly toddler or 
antsy pet), I give shutter speed the next highest priority in my exposure 
decision. I might choose a fast shutter speed to ensure a blur-free photo 
or, on the flip side, select a slow shutter to intentionally blur that moving 
object, an effect that can create a heightened sense of motion. (The water-
fall photo in Chapter 7 offers an example of the latter technique.)
 
✓ For images of non-moving subjects, I make aperture a priority over shutter 
speed, setting the aperture according to the depth of field I have in mind. 
For portraits, for example, I use a wide-open aperture (low f-stop number) 
so that I get a short depth of field, creating a nice, soft background for my 
subject. For landscapes, I go the opposite direction, stopping down the 
aperture as much as possible to capture the subject at the greatest depth 
of field.
Putting the f (stop) in focus
One way to remember the relationship between 
f-stop and depth of field, or the range of distance 
over which objects remain in sharp focus, is 
simply to think of the f as standing for focus. A 
higher f-stop number produces a larger depth of 
field, so if you want to extend the zone of sharp 
focus to cover a greater distance from your sub-
ject, you set the aperture to a higher f-stop. Higher 
f-stop number, greater zone of sharp focus.
Please don’t share this tip with photography 
elites, who will roll their eyes and inform you 
that the f in f-stop most certainly does not stand 
for focus but for the ratio between the aperture 
size and lens focal length — as if that’s helpful to 
know if you’re not an optical engineer. (Chapter 6 
explains focal length, which is helpful to know.)
As for the fact that you increase the f-stop 
number when you want a smaller aperture, 
well, I’m still working on the ideal mnemonic tip 
for that one. But try this in the meantime: Lower 
f-stop, larger aperture. Or maybe the opposite: 
Raise the f-stop to reduce the aperture size and 
restrict the light. (As I said, I’m working on it.)

126
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
I know that keeping all this straight is a little overwhelming at first, but the 
more you work with your camera, the more the whole exposure equation 
will make sense to you. You can find tips for choosing exposure settings for 
specific types of pictures in Chapter 7; keep moving through this chapter for 
details on how to actually monitor and adjust aperture, shutter speed, and 
ISO settings on the D90.
Exploring the Advanced Exposure Modes
 
You can control some aspects of exposure, including ISO, in the fully automatic 
exposure modes. But if you want access to all options, you need to set the 
Mode dial to one of the advanced modes highlighted in Figure 5-7: P, S, A, or M. 
You also need to shoot in these modes to use certain other features, such as 
manual white balancing, a color control that you can explore in Chapter 6.
 
Advanced exposure modes
 
Figure 5-7: You can control exposure and certain other picture properties 
 
fully only in P, S, A, or M mode.
Each of the four modes offers a different way to control aperture and shutter 
speed:
 
✓ P (programmed autoexposure): In this mode, the camera selects both 
aperture and shutter speed. But you can choose from different combina-
tions of the two, which gives you creative flexibility not possible in the 
fully automatic exposure modes discussed in Chapter 2. 
 
✓ S (shutter-priority autoexposure): In this mode, you select a shutter 
speed, and the camera chooses the aperture setting that produces a 
good exposure at your selected ISO setting.

127
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ A (aperture-priority autoexposure): The opposite of shutter-priority auto-
exposure, this mode asks you to select the aperture setting. The camera 
then selects the appropriate shutter speed to properly expose the picture.
 
✓ M (manual exposure): In this mode, you specify both shutter speed and 
aperture. 
 
To sum up, the first three modes are semi-automatic exposure modes that 
are designed to help you get a good exposure while still providing you with 
some photographic flexibility. Note one important difference between P and 
the other two semi-auto modes, however: Although you can select from dif-
ferent combinations of aperture and shutter speed in P mode, the choices 
presented to you are limited to those that will properly expose the picture. 
In A and S modes, you can dial in settings that will result in an under- or 
overexposed image. (The camera will warn you about the potential problem, 
however.) Manual mode puts all exposure control in your hands. But even in 
Manual mode, you’re never really flying without a net — the camera assists 
you by displaying the exposure meter, explained next.
Reading the Meter
To help you determine whether your exposure settings are on cue in M 
(manual) exposure mode, the camera displays an exposure meter in the view-
finder and Shooting Information screen. The meter is a little linear graphic 
that indicates whether your current settings will properly expose the image. 
Figure 5-8 gives you three examples.
The minus-sign end of the meter represents underexposure; the plus sign, 
overexposure. So if the little notches on the meter fall to the right of 0, the 
image will be underexposed. If the indicator moves to the left of 0, the image 
will be overexposed. The farther the indicator moves toward the plus or 
minus sign, the greater the potential problem. When the meter shows a bal-
anced exposure, as in the third example in the figure, you’re good to go.
 
Underexposure
Overexposure
Good exposure
 
Figure 5-8: The exposure meter indicates whether your exposure settings are on target.

128
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
In the S and A exposure modes, the meter appears when the camera thinks 
you’re heading for an exposure problem. If your exposure settings are so far 
off that the exposure indicator bumps up against the limits of the meter, you 
get an extra warning: In S mode, the words Hi or Lo take the place of the 
f-stop value to warn you about overexposure and underexposure, respec-
tively. In A mode, the warning message instead occupies the space normally 
reserved for the shutter speed.
If you’re so inclined, you can customize the meter in the following ways:
 
✓ Adjust the meter shutoff timing. The meter turns off automatically if 
you don’t press the shutter button for a period of time — 6 seconds, 
by default. You can adjust the shut-off timing through the Auto Meter-
Off Delay option, found on the Timers/AE Lock submenu of the Custom 
Setting menu, as shown on the left in Figure 5-9. Keep in mind that 
shorter delay times conserve battery power.
 
✓ Reverse the meter orientation. You can flip the meter so that the posi-
tive (overexposure) side appears on the right and the negative (underex-
posure) side falls on the left. This option also lies on the Custom Setting 
menu, but on the Controls submenu. Look for the Reverse Indicators 
option, as shown on the right in the figure.
 
Keep in mind that the meter’s suggestion on exposure may not always be the 
one you want to follow. For example, you may want to shoot a backlit subject 
in silhouette, in which case you want that subject to be underexposed. In 
other words, the meter is a guide, not a dictator. In addition, remember that 
the exposure information the meter reports is based on the exposure meter-
ing mode, which determines which part of the frame the camera considers 
when calculating exposure. At the default setting, exposure is based on the 
entire frame, but you can select two other metering modes. See the upcoming 
section “Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode” for details.
 
 
Figure 5-9: You can customize the behavior of the exposure meter.

 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Setting ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed
The next sections detail how to view and adjust these three critical exposure 
settings. Remember, you can adjust ISO in any exposure mode, but to con-
trol aperture (f-stop) or shutter speed, you must switch to one of the four 
advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, or M).
Adjusting aperture and shutter speed
You can view the current aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed in the Control 
panel, viewfinder, and Shooting Information display, as shown in Figure 5-10. 
(Press the Info button to display the Shooting Information screen.) 
 
Shutter speed
Aperture
 
Figure 5-10: Look for the current f-stop, shutter speed, and ISO settings here.
 
Shutter speeds are presented as whole numbers, even if the shutter speed is 
set to a fraction of a second. For example, the number 125 indicates a shutter 
speed of 1/125 second. When the shutter speed slows to 1 second or more, 
quote marks appear after the number — 1" indicates a shutter speed of 1 
second, 4" means 4 seconds, and so on.
To select aperture and shutter speed, start by pressing the shutter button 
halfway to kick the exposure system into gear. You can then release the 
button if you want. The next step depends on the exposure mode, as follows: 
 
✓ P (programmed auto): In this mode, the camera shows you its recom-
mended f-stop and shutter speed when you press the shutter button 
halfway. But you can rotate the main command dial to select a different 
combination of settings. The number of possible combinations depends 
upon the aperture settings the camera can select, which in turn depend 
on the lighting conditions and your lens.

130
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 An asterisk (*) appears next to the P exposure mode symbol in the upper-
left corner of the Shooting Information display after you rotate the main 
command dial to indicate that you adjusted the aperture/shutter speed 
settings from those the camera initially suggested. In the Control panel, a P* 
symbol appears right under the shutter speed to provide the same alert. To 
get back to the initial combo of shutter speed and aperture, rotate the main 
command dial until the asterisk disappears from the Shooting Information 
display and the P* disappears from the Control panel.
 
✓ S (shutter-priority autoexposure): In this mode, you select the shutter 
speed. Just rotate the main command dial to get the job done.
 
 As you change the shutter speed, the camera automatically adjusts the 
aperture as needed to maintain what it considers the proper exposure. 
Remember that as the aperture shifts, so does depth of field — so even 
though you’re working in shutter-priority mode, keep an eye on the f-stop, 
too, if depth of field is important to your photo. Also note that in extreme 
lighting conditions, the camera may not be able to adjust the aperture 
enough to produce a good exposure at your current shutter speed — 
again, possible aperture settings depend on your lens. So you may need 
to compromise on shutter speed (or in dim lighting, raise the ISO).
 
✓ A (aperture-priority autoexposure): In this mode, you control aperture, 
and the camera adjusts shutter speed automatically. To set the aperture 
(f-stop), rotate the sub-command dial.
 
 When you stop down the aperture (raise the f-stop value), be careful that 
the shutter speed doesn’t drop so low that you run the risk of camera shake 
if you handhold the camera — unless you have a tripod handy, of course. 
And if your scene contains moving objects, make sure that when you dial 
in your preferred f-stop, the shutter speed that the camera selects is fast 
enough to stop action (or slow enough to blur it, if that’s your creative 
goal). These same warnings apply when you use P mode, by the way.
 
✓ M (manual exposure): In this mode, you select both aperture and shut-
ter speed, like so:
 
• To adjust shutter speed: Rotate the main command dial. 
 
• To adjust aperture: Rotate the sub-command dial.
 
Keep in mind that when you use P, S, or A modes, the settings that the camera 
selects are based on what it thinks is the proper exposure. If you don’t agree 
with the camera, you have two options: You can switch to manual exposure 
mode and simply dial in the aperture and shutter speed that deliver the expo-
sure you want; or if you want to stay in P, S, or A mode, you can tweak expo-
sure using the Exposure Compensation feature, explained later in this chapter.
Controlling ISO
The ISO setting, introduced at the start of this chapter, adjusts the camera’s 
sensitivity to light. At a higher ISO, you can use a faster shutter speed or 

131
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
a smaller aperture (higher f-stop number) because less light is needed to 
expose the image.
You can adjust ISO in any exposure mode. Moreover, you can specify how 
you want to display and adjust the ISO value. To make that call, open the 
Custom Setting menu, navigate to the Shooting/Display submenu, highlight 
ISO Display and Adjustment, and press OK to display the three options 
shown in Figure 5-11.
 
 
Figure 5-11: You can choose from three options for displaying and adjusting ISO. 
Here are your choices:
 
✓ Off (Show Frame Count): In this mode, which is the default setting, the 
ISO value always appears in the Shooting Information display, as shown 
on the right in Figure 5-12. (Press the Info button to bring up the dis-
play.) If you set the ISO value to the Auto setting, an option discussed 
fully in the next section, you also see an Auto ISO label next to the 
frames-remaining value in the viewfinder and Control panel. (Refer to 
Figure 5-10, in the preceding section.) 
 
 
 Figure 5-12: At the default ISO display/adjustment setting, you press the ISO button and rotate 
the main command dial to change the ISO setting.

132
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 
 If you instead select a specific ISO setting, you must press the ISO button 
to see the setting in the viewfinder or Control panel. When you press the 
button, the ISO value temporarily replaces the frames-remaining value. 
In the Control panel, all other information disappears, but in the view-
finder, the f-stop and shutter speed remain visible, as shown on the left 
in Figure 5-12.
 
 Not to complicate matters — well, okay, I guess I’m about to do just 
that — but if you’re working in the P, S, A, or M exposure modes, you have 
the option of selecting a specific ISO value and enabling Auto ISO override 
as a backup. If you go this route, the Auto ISO label appears as usual, but 
pressing the ISO button shows the specific value you selected. Clear as 
mud? See the next bulleted list for information that may help.
 
 Regardless, you adjust the setting by rotating the main command dial 
while pressing the ISO button.
 
✓ Show ISO Sensitivity: If you choose this option, the ISO value perma-
nently replaces the frames-remaining value in the Control panel and 
viewfinder. Again, rotate the main command dial while pressing the ISO 
button to adjust the ISO value. You must visit the Shooting Information 
screen to see the frames-remaining value.
 
✓ Show ISO/Easy ISO: This setting also displays the ISO value instead of 
the frames-remaining number in the Control panel and viewfinder. But 
instead of pressing the ISO button to adjust the setting, you can just 
rotate the main command dial in the A exposure mode or the sub-com-
mand dial in the P and S modes. In all the other exposure modes, you 
press the ISO button and rotate the main command dial. I find all that a 
little complicated, but you be the judge.
Whichever display option you select, 
you also can adjust ISO via the ISO 
Sensitivity Settings option on the 
Shooting menu, as shown in Figure 
5-13. I find that sticking with the default 
ISO display option — Off (Show Frame 
Count) — and then using the ISO 
button/main dial maneuver is faster, 
however.
Keep the following factoids in mind 
about the ISO settings themselves: 
 
✓ Auto ISO in Auto and Digital 
Vari-Program modes: In these 
exposure modes, the list of ISO settings includes Auto ISO. Select this 
option if you want the camera to take the ISO reins entirely.
Figure 5-13: You also can adjust ISO via the 
Shooting menu. 

133
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ Auto ISO in advanced exposure 
modes. In the advanced exposure 
modes (P, S, A, and M), Auto ISO 
doesn’t appear on the ISO settings 
list. However, you still can enable 
Auto ISO as sort of a safety net. 
Here’s how it works: You dial in a 
specific ISO setting — say, ISO 
200. If the camera decides that it 
can’t properly expose the image at 
that ISO given your current aper-
ture and shutter speed, it auto-
matically adjusts ISO as 
necessary.
 
 To get to this option, first select 
the ISO Sensitivity Settings on 
the Shooting menu. (Refer to Figure 5-13.) Then press OK to display the 
screen shown in Figure 5-14, and set ISO Sensitivity Auto Control to On.
 
 Next, use the Maximum Sensitivity and Minimum Shutter Speed options, 
also shown in Figure 5-14, to tell the camera exactly when it should step in 
and offer ISO assistance. With the first option, you specify the highest ISO 
setting the camera may select when it does override your ISO decision. The 
second option sets the minimum shutter speed at which the ISO override 
engages. For example, you can specify that you want the camera to amp up 
ISO if the shutter speed drops to 1/40 second or below. This second option 
only affects shots you take in the P and A exposure modes, however.
 
 If the camera is about to override your ISO setting, it alerts you by 
blinking the ISO Auto label in the viewfinder and Control panel. And in 
Playback mode, the ISO value appears in red if you view your photos in 
the Shooting Information display mode. (Chapter 4 has details.)
 
 To disable Auto ISO override, just reset the ISO Sensitivity Auto Control 
to Off.
 
✓ Hi/Lo settings: The specific ISO values presented to you range from 200 
to 3200. But if you scroll past those settings, you discover three more 
settings in each direction: Hi 0.3, Hi 0.7, and Hi 1.0; and Lo 0.3, Lo 0.7, 
and Lo 1.0. These settings, in order, translate to ISO values of about 160, 
125, and 100 at the low end and 4000, 5000, and 6400 at the high end. 
 
Choosing ISO 3200 pretty much ensures a noisy image (refer to Figure 5-6), 
and shifting into the Hi settings just makes things worse. If cranking up ISO 
is the only way to capture the image, and you’d rather have a noisy picture 
than no picture, go for it. Otherwise, adjust shutter speed and aperture to get 
the exposure you want instead.
Also check out the upcoming sidebar “Dampening Noise” for features that 
may help calm noise somewhat.
Figure 5-14: In advanced exposure modes, 
you can set limits for Auto ISO override.

134
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode
 
To fully interpret what your exposure meter tells you, you need to know 
which metering mode is active. The metering mode determines which part 
of the frame the camera analyzes to calculate the proper exposure. The 
metering mode affects the exposure-meter reading as well as the exposure 
Dampening noise
Noise, the digital defect that gives your pictures 
a speckled look (refer to Figure 5-6), can occur 
for two reasons: a high ISO speed and a long 
exposure time.
The D90 offers two noise-removal filters, one 
designed to help eradicate ISO-related noise and 
another to dampen the type of noise that occurs 
during long exposures. You can enable both fil-
ters through the Shooting menu, shown in the left 
image here. Or you can access the controls from 
the Shooting Information display. Press the Info 
button twice to shift the display into Quick Settings 
mode. The Long Exposure Noise Reduction option 
is the first setting on the left, as shown on the right 
in the figure here, the High ISO Noise Reduction 
option lives right next door. After highlighting the 
option, press OK; you’re then taken to the menu 
screen that contains the relevant settings.
If you turn on Long Exposure Noise Reduction, 
the camera applies the filter to any pictures 
taken at shutter speeds of longer than 8 sec-
onds. For High ISO Noise Reduction, choosing 
High, Normal, or Low applies the filter at ISO 
settings of 800 or higher; the setting you choose 
determines the strength of the filter. If you 
choose Off, the camera actually still applies a 
tiny amount of noise removal, but only when you 
shift into the Hi ISO settings (Hi 0.3 or greater).
Before you enable noise reduction, be aware 
that doing so has a few disadvantages. First, the 
filters are applied after you take the picture, as 
the camera processes the image data. (While 
the filter is being applied, the message “Job nr” 
appears in the viewfinder and Control panel, 
in the area normally reserved for the shutter 
speed and aperture.) The time needed to apply 
the filter can slow down your shooting speed.
Second, noise-reduction filters work primarily by 
applying a slight blur to the image. Don’t expect 
this process to totally eliminate noise, and do 
expect some resulting image softness. You may 
be able to get better results by using the blur tools 
or noise-removal filters found in many photo edi-
tors, because you can blur just the parts of the 
image where noise is most noticeable — usually 
in areas of flat color or little detail, such as skies.

135
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
settings that the camera chooses in the fully automatic shooting modes 
(Auto, Portrait, and so on) as well as in the semi-auto modes (P, S, and A).
Your D90 offers three metering modes, described in the following list and 
represented in the Control panel and Shooting Information display by the 
icons you see in the margins:
 
 
✓ Matrix: The camera analyzes the entire frame and then selects an expo-
sure that’s designed to produce a balanced exposure.
 
 Your camera manual refers to this mode as 3D Color Matrix II, which is 
simply the label that Nikon created to describe the specific technology 
used in this mode.
 
 
✓ Center-Weighted: The camera bases exposure on the entire frame but 
puts extra emphasis — or weight — on the center of the frame. 
 
 Normally, the area that’s given 
priority in this mode is about 
8mm in diameter, which is rep-
resented by the circle in the 
viewfinder, labeled in Figure 5-15. 
However, in the P, S, A, and M 
exposure modes, you can alter 
the critical metering area to 6mm 
or 10mm. The option to do so is 
called Center-Weighted Area and 
lives on the Metering/Exposure 
street of the Custom Setting 
menu, as shown in Figure 5-16. 
Note that the size of the meter-
ing circle in the viewfinder does 
not change; it always reflects the 
default, 8mm area.
 
 
✓ Spot: In this mode, the camera 
bases exposure entirely on a circu-
lar area that’s about 3.5mm in 
diameter. The exact location used 
for this pin-point metering depends 
on an autofocusing option called 
the AF-area mode. Detailed in 
Chapter 6, this option determines 
which of the camera’s 11 focus 
points the autofocusing system 
uses to establish focus. Here’s how 
the setting affects exposure:
Center-Weighted metering circle
Figure 5-15: In center-weighted metering, 
the camera gives priority to objects that fall 
under the circle.
Figure 5-16: You can adjust the size of the 
area that’s given extra weight when you use 
center-weighted metering.

136
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
• If you choose the Auto-area mode, in which the camera chooses 
the focus point for you, exposure is based on the center focus 
point. 
 
• If you use any of the other AF-area modes, which enable you to 
select a specific focus point, the camera bases exposure on that 
point.
 
 Because of this autofocus/autoexposure relationship, it’s best to switch 
to one of the AF-area modes that allow focus-point selection when you 
want to use spot metering. In the Auto-area mode, exposure may be 
incorrect if you compose your shot so that the subject isn’t at the center 
of the frame.
As an example of how metering mode affects exposure, Figure 5-17 shows the 
same image captured at each mode. In the Matrix example, the bright back-
ground caused the camera to select an exposure that left the statue quite 
dark. Switching to center-weighted metering helped somewhat, but didn’t 
quite bring the statue out of the shadows. Spot metering produced the best 
result as far as the statue goes, although the resulting increase in exposure 
left the sky and background monument a little washed out.
 
Matrix metering
Center-Weighted metering
Spot metering
 
Figure 5-17: The metering mode determines which area of the frame the camera considers 
 
when calculating exposure.
 
 You don’t have a choice of metering modes in Auto mode or any of the Digital 
Vari-Program scene modes; the camera automatically uses matrix mode for all 
shots. But in P, A, S, or M modes, you can specify which metering mode you 
prefer. Just press and hold the Metering mode button as you rotate the main 
dial to cycle through the three options. The icon for the selected mode appears 
in the Control panel and Shooting Information display, as shown in Figure 5-18.

137
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 
Figure 5-18: The metering mode icon appears in the Control panel and Shooting Information 
 
display.
 
In theory, the best practice is to check the metering mode before you shoot 
and choose the one that best matches your exposure goals. But in practice, 
that’s a bit of a pain, not just in terms of having to adjust yet one more cap-
ture setting but in terms of having to remember to adjust one more capture 
setting. So here’s my advice: Until you’re really comfortable with all the other 
controls on your camera, just stick with the default setting, which is matrix 
metering. That mode produces good results in most situations, and, after 
all, you can see in the monitor whether you disagree with how the camera 
metered or exposed the image and simply reshoot after adjusting the expo-
sure settings to your liking. This option, in my mind, makes the whole meter-
ing mode issue a lot less critical than it is when you shoot with film.
The one exception to this advice might be when you’re shooting a series of 
images in which a significant contrast in lighting exists between subject and 
background, as in my examples here. Then, switching to center-weighted 
metering or spot metering may save you the time of having to adjust the 
exposure for each image. You may also want to investigate the section 
“Expanding Tonal Range with Active D-Lighting,” which tells you about a 
camera feature that can help you record brighter shadows without losing 
highlights.
 
One final — and important — point about metering: An option called Fine-
Tune Optimal Exposure, found on the Exposure/Metering submenu of the 
Custom Setting menu, enables you to fiddle with the metering system beyond 
just specifying the size of the center-weighted metering area. For each meter-
ing mode, you can specify that you always want a brighter or darker expo-
sure than what Nikon’s engineers determined to be optimal when developing 
the camera. In essence, you’re recalibrating the meter. Although it’s nice to 
have this level of control, making this change affects all shots you take in 
automatic exposure modes and semi-automatic modes (P, S, and A). In M 

138
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
(manual) exposure mode, the change affects the reading that the exposure 
meter reports. I really discourage you from making this adjustment — it’s 
too easy to forget that the shift is in place. You still can tweak the exposure 
results you get in the autoexposure modes; just use Exposure Compensation, 
explained next. In manual mode, just adjust the shutter speed, f-stop, or ISO 
to fine-tune exposure.
Applying Exposure Compensation
When you set your camera to the P, S, or A modes, you can enjoy autoexpo-
sure support but still retain some control over the final exposure. If you think 
that the image the camera produced is too dark or too light, you can use a 
feature known as Exposure Compensation.
This feature enables you to tell the camera to produce a darker or lighter 
exposure than what its autoexposure mechanism thinks is appropriate. Best 
of all, this feature is probably one of the easiest on the whole camera to 
understand. Here’s all there is to it:
 
✓ Exposure compensation settings are stated in terms of EV values, as in 
+2.0 EV. Possible values range from +5.0 EV to –5.0 EV. (The EV stands 
for exposure value.)
 
 Each full number on the EV scale represents an exposure shift of one 
stop. In plain English, that means that if you change the exposure com-
pensation setting from EV 0.0 to EV –1.0, the resulting exposure is equiv-
alent to adjusting the aperture or shutter speed to allow half as much 
light into the camera as at the current setting. If you instead raise the 
value to EV +1.0, the exposure is equivalent to adjusting the settings to 
allow twice the light.
 
✓ A setting of EV 0.0 results in no exposure adjustment.
 
✓ For a brighter image, raise the EV value. The higher you go, the brighter 
the image becomes.
 
✓ For a darker image, lower the EV value.
As an example, take a look at the first image in Figure 5-19. The initial expo-
sure selected by the camera left the balloon a tad too dark for my taste. So I 
just amped the Exposure Compensation setting to EV +1.0, which produced 
the brighter exposure on the right.

139
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
EV +1.0
EV 0.0
 
Figure 5-19: For a brighter exposure, raise the EV value.
 
 To apply Exposure Compensation, hold down the Exposure Compensation 
button, found near the shutter button. All data except the Exposure 
Compensation value then disappears from the Control panel and is dimmed 
in the Shooting Information display. In the viewfinder, the frames-remaining 
value is replaced by the Exposure Compensation value. While holding the 
button, rotate the main command dial to adjust the EV value. Note that the 
exposure meter in the viewfinder and Shooting Information display will 
appear to indicate that you’re shifting away from the exposure the system 
thinks is optimal; ignore it. If you liked what the camera thought about the 
exposure, you wouldn’t be using Exposure Compensation.
After you release the button, a little plus/minus symbol (the same one 
that decorates the button itself) appears in the Control panel, Shooting 
Information display, and viewfinder, as shown in Figure 5-20, to remind you 
that Exposure Compensation is in force. At any time, you can redisplay the 
selected value by pressing the Exposure Compensation button.

140
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 
Figure 5-20: The plus/minus symbol tells you that Exposure Compensation is being applied.
 
Your Exposure Compensation setting remains in force until you change it, 
even if you power off the camera. So you may want to make a habit of check-
ing the setting before each shoot or always setting the value back to EV 0.0 
after taking the last shot for which you want to apply compensation.
Here are a few other tips about Exposure Compensation:
 
✓ How the camera arrives at the brighter or darker image you request 
through your Exposure Compensation setting depends on the exposure 
mode:
 
• In A (aperture-priority autoexposure) mode, the camera adjusts 
the shutter speed but leaves your selected f-stop in force. Be 
sure to check the resulting shutter speed to make sure that it 
isn’t so slow that camera shake or blur from moving objects is 
problematic.
 
• In S (shutter-priority autoexposure) mode, the opposite occurs: 
The camera opens or stops down the aperture, leaving your 
selected shutter speed alone. 
 
• In P (programmed autoexposure) mode, the camera decides 
whether to adjust aperture, shutter speed, or both.
 
• In all three modes, the camera may also adjust ISO if you have 
Auto ISO enabled.
 
 Keep in mind that the camera can adjust f-stop only so much, according 
to the aperture range of your lens. And the range of shutter speeds, 
too, is limited by the camera itself. So if you reach the ends of those 
ranges, you either have to compromise on shutter speed or aperture 
or adjust ISO.

141
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ By default, Exposure 
Compensation settings are 
provided in increments of one-
third of a stop. For example, 
you can shift from EV 0.0 to 0.3, 
0.7. 1.0, and so on. If you want 
a more pronounced result from 
each step up or down the EV 
ladder, you can set the mecha-
nism to increments of one-half 
stop instead. Then the settings 
become EV 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and so 
on. Make the adjustment via the 
EV Steps for Exposure Control 
option on the Metering/Exposure 
submenu of the Custom Settings 
menu, shown in Figure 5-21.
 
✓ Right below that menu option, you see one called Easy Exposure 
Compensation. If you enable this feature, you can adjust the Exposure 
Compensation setting simply by rotating the subcommand dial. In aper-
ture-priority exposure mode, you then use the main dial instead of the 
subcommand dial to change the f-stop. I advise against enabling this fea-
ture: You can easily rotate the dial by mistake and not realize that you 
adjusted the setting.
 
✓ Finally, if you don’t want to fiddle with Exposure Compensation, just 
switch to Manual exposure mode — M, on the Mode dial — and select 
whatever aperture and shutter speed settings produce the exposure 
you’re after. Exposure Compensation has no effect on manual expo-
sures; again, that adjustment is made only in the P, S, and A modes.
Using Autoexposure Lock
To help ensure a proper exposure, your camera continually meters the light 
in a scene until the moment you depress the shutter button fully and capture 
the image. In autoexposure modes — that is, any mode but M — it also keeps 
adjusting exposure settings as needed to maintain a good exposure.
For example, say that you set your camera to shutter-priority autoexposure 
(S) mode and set the shutter speed to 1/125 second. The camera immediately 
reports the f-stop that it considers appropriate to expose the scene at that 
shutter speed. But if the light in the scene changes or you reframe your shot 
before snapping the picture, the camera may shift the f-stop automatically to 
make sure that the exposure remains correct.
Figure 5-21: You can set the Exposure 
Compensation option to adjust exposure in 
one-half stops rather than one-third stops if 
you prefer. 

142
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
For most situations, this approach works great, resulting in the right set-
tings for the light that’s striking your subject at the moment you capture 
the image. But on occasion, you may want to lock in a certain combination 
of exposure settings. Here’s one such scenario: Suppose that you’re shoot-
ing several images of a large landscape that you want to join together into a 
panorama in your photo editor. Unless the lighting is even across the entire 
landscape, the camera’s autoexposure brain will select different exposure 
settings for each shot, depending on which part of the scene is currently 
in the frame. That can lead to weird breaks in the brightness and contrast 
of the image when you seam the image together. And if it’s the f-stop that’s 
adjusted, you may notice shifts in depth of field as well.
The easiest way to lock in exposure settings is to switch to M (manual) expo-
sure mode and use the same f-stop, shutter speed, and ISO settings for each 
shot. But if you prefer to stay in P, S, or A mode, you can press the AE-L/AF-L 
button to lock exposure and focus simultaneously. Here’s the technique I 
recommend:
 
 
1. Set the metering mode to center-weighted or spot metering.
 
 Just press the button shown in the margin here while rotating the main 
command dial to select the metering mode. You can read more about 
metering modes earlier in this chapter.
 
2. Set the AF-area mode option to the Single Point setting and then use 
the Multi Selector to select your desired focus point.
 
 This step tells the camera which part of the frame you want to use for 
establishing focus and, if you use spot metering, also determines which 
part of the frame the camera uses to calculate exposure.
 
 The AF-area mode option is found on the Autofocus submenu of the 
Custom Setting menu; after choosing Single Point, you can use the Multi 
Selector to choose a focusing point. See Chapter 6 for more details. 
 
AE-L
AF-L
 
3. Frame your shot so that the subject appears under the selected focus 
point and then press and hold the AE-L/AF-L button.
 
 The button’s just to the right of the viewfinder.
 
 While the button is pressed, the letters AE-L appear at the left end of the 
viewfinder to remind you that exposure lock is applied. 
 
4. Reframe the shot if desired and take the photo.
 
 Be sure to keep holding the AE-L/AF-L button until you release the shut-
ter button! 

143
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
By default, this step locks both exposure and focus for as long as you press 
the button, even if you release the shutter button. (AE-L stands for autoex-
posure lock; AF-L, for autofocus lock.) But if you dig into the Custom Setting 
menu, you can change the button’s function. You can set the button to lock 
only exposure, for example, or only focus, instead of locking both as it does 
by default. Chapter 11 offers details.
Expanding Tonal Range with Active D-Lighting
A scene like the one in Figure 5-22 presents the classic photographer’s chal-
lenge: Choosing exposure settings that capture the darkest parts of the sub-
ject appropriately causes the brightest areas to be overexposed. And if you 
instead “expose for the highlights” — that is, set the exposure settings to 
capture the brightest regions properly — the darker areas are underexposed.
 
Active D-Lighting Off
Automatic Active D-Lighting On
 
Figure 5-22: Active D-Lighting enabled me to capture the shadows without blowing out the 
 
highlights.

144
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
In the past, you had to choose between favoring the highlights or the shad-
ows. But thanks to a feature than Nikon calls Active D-Lighting, you have a 
better chance of keeping your highlights intact while better exposing the 
darkest areas. In my seal scene, turning on Active D-Lighting produced a 
brighter rendition of the darkest parts of the rocks and the seals, for exam-
ple, and yet the color in the sky didn’t get blown out as it did when I captured 
the image with Active D-Lighting turned off. The highlights in the seal and in 
the rocks on the lower-right corner of the image also are toned down a tad in 
the Active D-Lighting version.
 
Active D-Lighting actually does its thing in two stages. First, it selects expo-
sure settings that result in a slightly darker exposure than normal. This half 
of the equation guarantees that you retain details in your highlights. Without 
that adjustment, the brightest areas of the image might be overexposed, leav-
ing you with a batch of all-white pixels that really should contain a range of 
tones from light to lighter to white. So a cloud, for example, would appear as 
a big white blob, with no subtle tonal details to give it form. After you snap 
the photo, the second part of the process occurs. During this phase, the 
camera applies an internal software filter to brighten only the darkest areas 
of the image. This adjustment rescues shadow detail, so that you wind up 
with a range of dark tones instead of a big black blob.
You can turn Active D-Lighting on and off in two ways: 
 
✓ Select Active D-Lighting from the Shooting menu, as shown on the left in 
Figure 5-23. Press OK to display the second screen in the figure, where 
you can specify the amount of D-Lighting adjustment. At the Auto set-
ting, the camera determines how much adjustment is needed. If you 
prefer to take control, you can select from one of the other four settings 
(Extra High, High, Normal, and Low). Press OK to enable the adjustment 
for your next shot.
 
 
Figure 5-23: At the Auto setting, the camera automatically applies the amount of Active 
 
D-Lighting adjustment as it sees fit.

145
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ Press the Info button to bring up 
the Shooting Information display 
on the monitor. Then press the 
Info button again to activate the 
Quick Settings strip of options 
at the bottom of the screen, as 
shown in Figure 5-24. Use the 
Multi Selector to highlight the 
Active D-Lighting option, as 
shown in the figure, and then 
press OK. You’re then taken to 
the menu screen that contains 
the Active D-Lighting settings 
(the right screen in Figure 5-23).
 
If you’re not sure how much adjust-
ment to apply, try out the Active 
D-Lighting bracketing feature. With this option, you take multiple shots of the 
subject, and the camera automatically selects a different Active D-Lighting 
adjustment for each shot. You then can decide which image you prefer. See 
the last section in this chapter for details about bracketing with the D90.
As helpful as it is, Active D-Lighting does have one drawback: The camera 
needs a few seconds to do its shadow-recovery work. And during that time, 
you can’t take another shot. Unfortunately, that makes Active D-Lighting a 
hindrance when you’re capturing action or otherwise need to fire off shots in 
rapid succession. If you decide you’re better off not using the feature, just set 
the option to Off via the Shooting menu or Shooting Information display.
Remember, too, that the camera’s Retouch menu offers a D-Lighting filter 
that applies a similar adjustment to existing pictures. (See Chapter 10 for 
help.) Some photo editing programs, such as Adobe Photoshop Elements and 
Photoshop, also have good shadow and highlight recovery filters. In either 
case, when you shoot with Active D-Lighting disabled, you’re better off setting 
the initial exposure settings to record the highlights as you want them. It’s very 
difficult to bring back lost highlight detail after the fact, but you typically can 
unearth at least a little bit of detail from the darkest areas of the image.
Using Flash in P, S, A, and M modes
Sometimes, no amount of fiddling with aperture, shutter speed, and ISO pro-
duces a bright enough exposure — in which case, you simply have to add 
more light. The built-in flash on your D90 offers the most convenient solution.
Figure 5-24: Press the Info button twice 
to access the D-Lighting option from the 
Shooting Information display.

146
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
When you shoot in the advanced exposure modes, you have much more con-
trol over your flash than when you use the fully automatic modes covered in 
Chapter 2. First, you gain access to flash modes not available in the full-auto 
modes. Even better, you can adjust the strength of the flash by using a fea-
ture called Flash Compensation.
The rest of this chapter explains how to use these flash functions and also 
offers some tips on getting better results in your flash pictures. Be sure to 
also visit Chapter 7, where you can find additional flash and lighting tips 
related to specific types of photographs.
Setting the flash mode
 
 To raise the built-in flash in P, S, A, and M exposure modes, press the Flash 
button on the front-left side of the camera. You then can view the current 
flash mode in the Control panel and Shooting Information display, as labeled 
in Figure 5-25. In the viewfinder, you see a simple lightning-bolt icon when 
flash is enabled, as shown in the figure. To change the flash mode, hold the 
Flash button down as you rotate the main command dial. Again, you can 
see the specific modes only in the Control panel and Shooting Information 
display.
 
The TTL label you see in the flash area of the Shooting Information display 
stands for through the lens and reflects the default flash-control behavior, 
in which the camera sets the proper flash power for you. For a look at your 
other options, see the section “Changing to manual, repeating, or commander 
flash mode,” later in this chapter.
 
 
Figure 5-25: You can verify the flash mode in the Control panel and Shooting Information display.
Your flash mode choices break down into three basic categories, described 
in the next sections: fill flash; red-eye reduction flash; and the sync modes, 
slow-sync and rear-sync, which are special-purpose flash options. Note that 

147
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
the list of available flash modes doesn’t include two options available in the 
fully automatic exposure modes: Auto, in which the camera makes the deci-
sions about when to fire the flash, and Off. Instead, if you don’t want the flash 
to fire, simply keep the flash unit closed.
The camera does give you a little auto-flash input though: By default, the 
flash symbol in the viewfinder blinks in the P, S, and A modes if the camera 
thinks you need to use flash. If you prefer not to have that input, you can turn 
off the warning. Just visit the Custom Setting menu, navigate to the Shooting/
Display submenu, and set the Flash Warning option to Off.
Fill flash
 
 The fill flash setting is represented by plain-old lightning bolt symbol you see 
in the margin here. (Figure 5-25 shows you the symbol as it appears in the 
Control panel and Shooting Information display.) You can think of this setting 
as “normal flash” — at least in the way that most of us think of using a flash.
You may also hear this mode called force flash because the flash fires no 
matter what the available light, unlike in the auto flash mode provided for 
the fully automatic exposure modes, in which the camera decides when flash 
is needed. In fill flash mode, the flash fires even in the brightest daylight — 
which, by the way, is often an excellent idea.
 
Yep, you read me correctly: Adding a flash can really improve outdoor 
photos, even when the sun is at its sunniest. Just as an example, Figure 5-26 
shows a floral image taken both with and without a flash. The small pop of 
light provided by the built-in flash is also extremely beneficial when shooting 
subjects that happen to be slightly shaded, such as the carousel horses 
featured in the next section. For outdoor portraits, a flash is even more 
important; Chapter 7 discusses that subject.
Using a flash in bright sunlight also produces a slight warming effect, as 
illustrated in Figure 5-26. This color shift occurs because when you enable 
the flash, the camera’s white balancing mechanism warms color slightly to 
compensate for the bluish light of a flash. But because your scene is actually 
lit primarily by sunlight, which is not as cool as flash light, the white balance 
adjustment takes the image colors a step warmer than neutral. If you don’t 
want this warming effect, see Chapter 6 to find out how to make a manual 
white balance adjustment.
 
Do note, however, that when you use the built-in flash, you’re restricted to a 
top shutter speed of 1/200 second. That means that in very bright sun, you 
may need to stop down the aperture significantly or lower ISO, if possible, 
to avoid overexposing the image. See the sidebar “In Sync: Flash timing and 
shutter speed,” later in this chapter, for details on shutter-speed ranges avail-
able for flash photography.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 
Figure 5-26: Adding flash resulted in better illumination and a slight warming effect.
Red-eye reduction flash 
Red-eye is caused when flash light bounces off a subject’s retinas and is 
reflected back to the camera lens. Red-eye is a human phenomena, though; 
with animals, the reflected light usually glows yellow, white, or green.
Man or beast, this issue isn’t nearly the problem with the type of pop-up flash 
found on your D90 as it is on non-SLR cameras. The D90’s flash is positioned 
in such a way that the flash light usually doesn’t hit a subject’s eyes straight 
on, which lessens the chances of red-eye. However, red-eye may still be an 
issue when you use a lens with a long focal length (a telephoto lens) or you 
shoot subjects from a distance.
 
 If you do notice red-eye, you can try the red-eye reduction mode, represented 
by the icon shown in the margin here. In this mode, the AF-assist lamp on 
the front of the camera lights up briefly before the flash fires. The subject’s 
pupils constrict in response to the light, allowing less flash light to enter the 
eye and cause that glowing red reflection. Be sure to warn your subjects to 
wait for the flash, or they may step out of the frame or stop posing after they 
see the light from the AF-assist lamp.
For an even better solution, try the flash-free portrait tips covered in Chapter 7. 
If you do a lot of portrait work that requires flash, you may also want to consider 
an external flash unit, which enables you to aim the flash light in ways that virtu-
ally eliminate red-eye.

149
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
If all else fails, check out Chapter 10, which shows you how to use the built-in 
red-eye removal tool on your camera’s Retouch menu. Sadly, though, this fea-
ture removes only red-eye, not the yellow/green/white eye that you get with 
animal portraits.
Slow-sync and rear-sync flash
In fill flash and red-eye reduction flash modes, the flash and shutter are syn-
chronized so that the flash fires at the exact moment the shutter opens.
 
Technical types refer to this flash arrangement as front-curtain sync.
Your D90 also offers four special-sync modes, which work as follows:
 
✓ Slow-sync flash: This mode, available only in the P and A exposure 
modes, also uses front-curtain sync but allows a shutter speed slower 
than the 1/60 second minimum that is in force when you use fill flash 
and red-eye reduction flash.
In sync: Flash timing and shutter speed
In order to properly expose flash pictures, the 
camera has to synchronize the timing of the 
flash output with the opening and closing of 
the shutter. For this reason, the range of shut-
ter speeds available to you is more limited when 
you use flash than when you go flash-free.
When you use the built-in flash, the maximum 
shutter speed is 1/200 second. The minimum 
shutter speed varies depending on your expo-
sure mode, as follows:
 ✓ P, A, Auto, Portrait, Child modes: 1/60 
second
 ✓ Close Up mode: 1/125 second
 ✓ Nighttime Portrait mode: 1 second
 ✓ S mode: 30 seconds
 ✓ M mode: 30 seconds (unless you use bulb 
mode, in which the shutter stays open as 
long as you hold the shutter button down)
In P and A exposure modes, you have the option 
of specifying the minimum shutter speed that 
the camera can select in the red-eye reduction 
mode and the special sync modes described in 
the section “Slow-sync and rear-sync flash.” 
The default setting is 1/60 second, but you can 
go as low as 30 seconds. To change the set-
ting, go to the Custom Setting menu and look 
for the Flash Shutter Speed option, found on the 
Bracketing/Flash submenu.
If you use an external flash, you can increase 
the maximum shutter speed to as high as 1/4000 
second. However, this option is available only 
with certain Nikon flash units; for details, see 
“Using an external flash,” later in this chapter.

150
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 The benefit of this longer exposure is that the camera has time to 
absorb more ambient light, which in turn has two effects: Background 
areas that are beyond the reach of the flash appear brighter; and less 
flash power is needed, resulting in softer lighting.
 
 The downside of the slow shutter speed is, well, the slow shutter speed. 
As discussed earlier in this chapter, the longer the exposure time, the 
more you have to worry about blur caused by movement of your subject 
or your camera. A tripod is essential to a good outcome, as are subjects 
that can hold very, very still. I find that the best practical use for this 
mode is shooting nighttime still-life subjects such as the one you see in 
Figure 5-27.
 
 Some photographers, though, turn the downside of slow-sync flash to an 
upside, using it to purposely blur their subjects, thereby emphasizing 
motion.
 
Slow-sync flash
Normal flash
 
 Figure 5-27: Slow-sync flash produces softer, more even lighting than normal flash in nighttime 
pictures.

151
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ Rear-curtain sync: In this mode, 
available only in shutter-priority 
(S) and manual (M) exposure 
modes, the flash fires at the very 
end of the exposure, just before 
the shutter closes. The classic 
use of this mode is to combine 
the flash with a slow shutter 
speed to create trailing-light 
effects like the one you see in 
Figure 5-28. With rear-curtain 
sync, the light trails extend 
behind the moving object (my 
hand, and the match, in this 
case), which makes visual sense. 
If instead you use slow-sync flash, 
the light trails appear in front of 
the moving object.
 
✓ Slow-sync with rear-curtain 
sync: Hey, not confusing enough 
for you yet? This mode enables 
you to produce the same motion 
trail effects as with rear-curtain 
sync, but in the P and A exposure 
modes.
 
✓ Slow-sync with red-eye reduction: In P and A exposure modes, you can 
also combine a slow-sync flash with the red-eye reduction feature. Given 
the potential for blur that comes with a slow shutter, plus the potential for 
subjects to mistake the prelight from the AF-assist lamp for the real flash 
and walk out of the frame before the image is actually recorded, I vote this 
flash mode as the most difficult to pull off successfully.
Note that all of these modes are somewhat tricky to use successfully, how-
ever. So have fun playing around, but at the same time, don’t feel too badly 
if you don’t have time right now to master these modes plus all the other 
exposure options presented to you in this chapter. In the meantime, do a 
Web search for slow-sync and rear-sync image examples if you want to get 
a better idea of the effects that other photographers create with these flash 
modes.
Adjusting flash output
 
When you shoot with your built-in flash, the camera attempts to adjust the 
flash output as needed to produce a good exposure. But if shoot in the P, S, 
A, or M exposure modes and you want a little more or less flash light than the 
camera thinks is appropriate, you can adjust the flash output by using a fea-
ture called Flash Compensation.
Figure 5-28: I used rear-curtain flash to 
create this candle-lighting image.

152
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
This feature works just like Exposure Compensation, discussed earlier in the 
chapter, except that it enables you to override the camera’s flash-power deci-
sion instead of its autoexposure decision. As with Exposure Compensation, 
the Flash Compensation settings are stated in terms of EV (exposure value) 
numbers. A setting of 0.0 indicates no flash adjustment; you can increase the 
flash power to EV +1.0 or decrease it to EV –3.0.
As an example of the benefit of this feature, look at the carousel images in 
Figure 5-29. The first image shows you a flash-free shot. Clearly, I needed a 
flash to compensate for the fact that the horses were shadowed by the roof 
of the carousel. But at normal flash power, as shown in the same image, the 
flash was too strong, creating glare in some spots and blowing out the high-
lights in the white mane, as shown in the middle image. By dialing the flash 
power down to EV –0.7, I got a softer flash that straddled the line perfectly 
between no flash and too much flash.
 
No flash
Flash EV 0.0
Flash EV −0.7
 
Figure 5-29: When normal flash output is too strong, dial in a lower 
 
Flash Compensation setting.

153
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
As for boosting the flash output, well, you may find it necessary on some 
occasions, but don’t expect the built-in flash to work miracles even at a Flash 
Compensation of +1.0. Any built-in flash has a limited range, and you simply 
can’t expect the flash light to reach faraway objects. In other words, don’t 
even try taking flash pictures of a darkened recital hall from your seat in the 
balcony — all you’ll wind up doing is annoying everyone.
 
 With that preface in mind, you can enable Flash Compensation by first press-
ing the Flash button to pop up the built-in flash. Then press and hold the 
button as you rotate the subcommand dial. As long as you hold the button, 
the Flash Compensation setting appears in the Control panel and Shooting 
Information display, as shown in Figure 5-30. In the viewfinder, the current 
setting takes the place of the usual frames-remaining value, and a plus or 
minus sign also appears to indicate whether you’re dialing in a positive or 
negative value.

Figure 5-30: Rotate the sub-command dial while pressing the Flash button to adjust flash 
 
power.
After you release the Flash button, you see just the Flash Compensation icon 
in all three displays. To check the specific compensation value, press and 
hold the Flash button. 
 
As with Exposure Compensation, any flash-power adjustment you make 
remains in force, even if you turn off the camera, until you reset the control. 
So be sure to check the setting before you next use your flash.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Locking flash exposure on your subject
At times, the composition of a scene can cause the camera’s flash meter to 
set the flash power incorrectly for your subject. For example, if you’re photo-
graphing someone with pale skin who’s dressed in all black, the camera may 
“see” all that black and deliver a flash power that’s too strong to properly 
light the face. Flash power can also be miscalculated if your main subject 
occupies a very small part of the frame, is off-center, or both.
To address this problem, you can use a feature called flash value lock, or Fv 
Lock in Nikon terminology. When you take advantage of this option, you can 
ensure that the flash power is set for the most important part of the scene.
By default, the Fn (function) button, located on the front-right side of the 
camera just under the AF-assist lamp, is assigned the task of locking the 
flash value. As spelled out in Chapter 11, however, you can assign a different 
operation to the button; if you’ve taken that step, revisit the chapter to find 
out how to reset the button to the flash-exposure lock setting. You alterna-
tively can program the AE-L/AF-L button to perform this task if you want to 
use the Fn button for some other purpose; again, see Chapter 11 for details. 
Assuming that one of the buttons is geared to the flash locking function, take 
these steps to use it: 
 
1. Frame the shot so that your subject is in the center of the viewfinder. 
 
 You can adjust composition after locking the flash power if you want.
 
 
2. In P, S, A, or M mode, press the Flash button to pop up the built-in 
flash.
 
 In the Auto, Portrait, Close Up, and Night Portrait modes, the flash will 
pop up automatically when you take the next step, assuming that the 
ambient light is sufficiently dim. If it’s not, the camera won’t let you use 
flash. (Flash is never available in the other fully automatic modes.
 
3. Press and hold the shutter button halfway to engage the exposure 
meter and, in autofocus mode, to set focus.
 
4. Press the button that was assigned the Fv Lock function.
 
 The flash fires a little preflash to determine the correct flash power. 
When flash power is locked, the letter L appears next to the flash symbol 
in the viewfinder.
 
5. Recompose the picture if desired and then take the shot.
To release the flash value lock, just press the assigned button again.

155
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Exploring a few additional flash options
For most people, the flash options covered to this point in the chapter are 
the most useful on a regular basis. But your D90 does offer a few other flash 
options that some photographers may appreciate on occasion, so the next 
three sections provide a quick look-see. 
Changing to manual, repeating, or commander flash mode
If you dig into the Bracketing/Flash submenu of the Custom Setting menu, 
you come across a setting called Flash Cntrl (Control) for Built-In Flash, as 
shown in Figure 5-31. Normally, your flash operates in the TTL, or Through 
the Lens, mode, in which the camera automatically determines the right flash 
output for you.
 
 
Figure 5-31: You can set flash power manually through this menu.
However, if you’re an advanced flash user, you may want to explore the other 
options:
 
✓ Manual: In this mode, you can select a specific flash power, with set-
tings ranging from full power to 1/128 power. (If you’re hip to rating 
flash power by Guide Numbers, the manual spells out the ratings for the 
built-in flash.)
 
✓ Repeating Flash: If you select this mode, the camera fires the flash 
repeatedly as long as the shutter is open. The resulting picture looks as 
though it was shot with a strobe light. In other words, this is a special-
effects function.
 
✓ Commander Mode: This mode is relevant only if you own external flash 
heads that you want to use as off-camera light sources. If you do, you 
can use the built-in flash to trigger (command) the firing of the external 
heads. The external heads must be designed to work in this way, of 
course.

156
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Because these are advanced, special-purpose functions, I’ll limit myself to 
making you aware of them here and referring you to the manual for specifics 
on the settings available in each mode.
Using the Fn button to disable flash for the next shot
In Chapter 11, you can find out how to assign different functions to the Fn 
(function) button, which it tucked away on the right-front side of the camera. 
One of your options is to set the button to temporarily prevent the flash from 
firing. You have to hold down the button while pressing the shutter button to 
make it work, though, and I find that maneuver difficult. So instead, I either 
select the Off flash setting when working in the fully automatic exposure 
modes or simply close the flash unit when working in P, S, A, or M modes. 
That leaves the Fn button free to handle some other operation, such as Flash 
Exposure lock, explained earlier.
Firing a modeling flash
Chapter 6 introduces you to your D90’s Depth-of-Field Preview button, which 
enables you to preview through the viewfinder how your selected aperture 
setting will affect depth of field. You can set up the button to also emit a mod-
eling flash when you check depth of field.
When you enable this feature, the flash emits a repeating, strobe-like series 
of flash light while you press the button. The idea is to enable you to preview 
how the light will fall on your subject. However, living subjects aren’t likely to 
appreciate the feature — it’s a bit blinding to have the flash going off repeat-
edly in your face. So I personally leave the feature off.
If you do want to enable it, you can do so through the Modeling Flash option, 
found on the Bracketing/Flash submenu of the Custom Setting menu. 
Using an external flash head
In addition to its built-in flash, your camera has a hot shoe, which is photo-
geek terminology for a connection that enables you to add an external 
flash head like the one shown in Figure 5-32. The figure features the Nikon 
Speedlight SB-600, which currently retails for about $200. (The hot shoe is 
covered by a little cap when you first get the camera; you have to remove it 
to add your flash.)
Although not the cheapest of accessories, an external flash may be a worth-
while investment if you do a lot of flash photography. For one thing, an exter-
nal flash offers greater power, enabling you to illuminate a larger area than you 

157
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
can with a built-in flash. And with flash units like 
the one in Figure 5-32, you can rotate the flash head 
so that the flash light bounces off a wall or ceiling 
instead of hitting your subject directly. This results 
in softer lighting and can eliminate the harsh shad-
ows often caused by the strong, narrowly focused 
light of a built-in flash. (Chapter 7 offers an example 
of the difference this lighting technique can make 
in portraits.)
 
You gain yet another benefit with Nikon flash 
heads that support the company’s Creative 
Lighting System (CLS) features: By enabling 
an option called Auto FP, found on the Flash/
Bracketing submenu of the Custom Setting menu 
(see Figure 5-33), you can use a shutter speed 
faster than the 1/200-second limit of the built-in 
flash. In fact, you can use shutter speeds as high 
as 1/4000 second! That flexibility gives you a great 
advantage when you want to use flash outside 
during bright sunshine. Say you’re shooting a 
portrait, for example, and you want 
to use a low f-stop value to achieve a 
short depth of field and blur the back-
ground. At the 1/200-second limit, the 
open aperture is likely going to over-
expose the photo, even if you select 
the lowest possible ISO. But with a top 
shutter speed of 1/4000 second, you 
should be able to open the aperture to 
a nice, wide, portrait-friendly setting. 
(Do note that if you want to use this 
feature, however, you must shoot in 
the P, S, A, or M exposure modes.)
If you do purchase an external flash, 
I highly recommend that you visit a 
good camera store, where the per-
sonnel can help you select the right 
unit for the kind of flash work you want to do. You may also want to dig into 
some of the many books that concentrate on flash photography and the Nikon 
Creative Lighting System. There’s a lot more to that game than you may imag-
ine, and you’ll no doubt discover some great ideas about lighting your pictures 
with flash. You can start with Chapter 7, which provides some specific exam-
ples of how to get better flash results when you shoot portraits, whether you 
go with the built-in flash, an external flash, or, my favorite, no flash.
Figure 5-32: You can mount a 
flash head via the hot shoe on 
top of the camera.
Figure 5-33: For some Nikon flash units, 
enabling this option allows you to use shutter 
speeds faster than the standard 1/200-second 
maximum.

158
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Bracketing Exposures
Many professional photographers use a strategy called bracketing to ensure 
that at least one shot of a subject is properly exposed. They shoot the same 
subject multiple times, slightly varying the exposure settings for each image.
To make bracketing easy, your D90 offers automatic bracketing. When you 
enable this feature, your only job is to press the shutter button to record the 
shots; the camera automatically adjusts the exposure settings between each 
image.
The D90, however, takes things one step further than most cameras that offer 
automatic bracketing. In addition to bracketing exposure, you can bracket 
flash power or the amount of Active D-Lighting that’s applied. And when 
you’re concerned about color, you can instead choose to bracket white bal-
ancing, an adjustment that you can explore fully in Chapter 6.
 
To try out bracketing, take these steps:
 
1. Set your camera to the P, S, A, or M exposure mode.
 
 You can’t take advantage of the feature in the Auto or Digital Vari-
Program modes.
 
2. Specify the Auto Bracketing Set option.
 
 This option tells the camera which exposure or color feature you want 
to adjust between shots. Display the Custom Setting menu, select 
Bracketing/Flash, and press OK. Then highlight Auto Bracketing Set, 
as shown on the left in Figure 5-34, and press OK again to display your 
choices, shown on the right in the figure. 
 
 
 Figure 5-34: Before enabling auto bracketing, select the exposure or color feature you want 
the camera to adjust between shots.

159
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 You can adjust exposure (AE), flash, white balance (WB), or Active 
D-Lighting (ADL). Or you can bracket exposure and flash together by 
choosing the AE & Flash option. 
 
 Even though the exposure-related option is called AE (for autoexpo-
sure), it works in M (manual exposure) mode.
 
 
3. To turn on bracketing, press and hold the BKT button as you rotate 
the main command dial.
 
 The BKT button’s just below the Flash button, on the left-front side of 
the camera. The current bracketing settings appear in the Control panel 
and Shooting Information screen, as shown in Figure 5-35. After you 
rotate the main command dial, the little bracketing symbol shown in the 
figure appears to let you know that bracketing is enabled. The bracket-
ing symbol also appears in the viewfinder, but the exact settings do not.

 Figure 5-35: Rotate the main command dial while pressing the BKT button to turn auto 
bracketing on and off.
 
 That little meter-like thing under the BKT symbol in the Control panel 
and the larger meter in the Shooting Information are the bracketing prog-
ress indicators. They’re there to let you know which shot in your brack-
eted series you’re about to take next. More on this issue in Step 7.
 
4. To change the number and type of frames recorded in each series of 
bracketed shots, keep pressing the BKT button and rotate the main 
command dial.

160
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 For exposure and flash bracketing, the options that appear when you 
rotate the dial are as follows: 
 
• 3F: Choose this option to take three frames: one without any 
adjustment, one at a slightly reduced setting, and one at an 
increased setting. For example, if you choose the AE bracketing 
option to adjust exposure between frames, the camera records the 
first shot at whatever aperture, shutter speed, and so on that you 
set before taking the shot. Then it creates a second image that’s 
slightly brighter, and a third that’s slightly darker.
 
• +2F: This option records just two frames per bracketed series: One 
uses your original settings, and one adjusts the selected option 
to the positive side of the scale. For the AE bracketing option, for 
example, the second frame produces a brighter exposure than the 
first.
 
• –2F: This one gives you the same thing as the +2F option, but the 
setting that’s being bracketed is reduced for the second frame. So 
this time, bracketing exposure produces a darker photo for the 
second frame.
 
 For Active D-Lighting bracketing, press the BKT button and rotate the 
command dial to display the letters ADL in the Control panel. For this 
type of bracketing, the camera always records two frames: One with 
the filter turned off and one with the filter applied at the current Active 
D-Lighting setting (which you control through the Shooting menu). For 
white balance bracketing, you can shift colors toward blue or toward 
amber; see the white-balance section of Chapter 6 for details. 
 
 The bracketing progress indicator changes depending on which of 
the frame options you choose. In the Control panel, the scale looks 
as shown in Figure 5-35 when you enable the three-frame bracketing 
option for exposure bracketing, for example. For the +2 option, the nega-
tive side of the scale disappears; for the –2 option, the positive side 
is hidden. In the Shooting Information display, the notches under the 
meter show you how many frames are enabled. For three frames, you 
see three notches, as shown in the figure. The notch at the zero point 
represents the neutral shot — the one that will be recorded with no 
adjustment.
 
 All this assumes that you use the default setting for the Bracketing 
Order option on the Bracketing/Flash submenu, however. If you prefer, 
you can reverse the order in which the positive- and negative-value 
shots are recorded by choosing the second of the two Bracketing Order 
settings.

161
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
5. To adjust the amount of shift between each frame, rotate the 
subcommand dial while pressing the BKT button.
 
 This step doesn’t apply to Active D-Lighting bracketing; you can only 
record the shots with or without the filter enabled.
 
 For exposure and flash bracketing, the adjustment increments are based 
on the current setting of the EV Steps for Exposure Control option, 
located on the Custom Setting menu. The earlier section, “Applying 
Exposure Compensation,” introduces you to this menu. By default, the 
option is set to increments of one-third stop, but if you want a larger 
variation between each bracketed shot, you can change the menu set-
ting to 1/2 stop (0.5). Just remember that the selected setting affects the 
amount of adjustment when you apply Exposure Compensation as well 
as Flash Compensation, also covered earlier in this chapter.
 
 For white balance (WB) bracketing, you can shift the white balance in 
increments of 1, 2, or 3, with each step making the picture either pro-
gressively more amber or more blue. Again, see Chapter 6 for the details 
that will make that feature clear.
 
6. Release the BKT button to return to shooting mode. 
 
 The bracketing frame and increment settings then disappear from the 
Control panel and Shooting Information display; the bracketing indicator 
remains, along with the BKT icon.
 
7. Take your first shot.
 
 After you take the picture, the bracketing progress indicator updates 
to show you how many more shots are left in the series. For example, if 
you are bracketing three frames, the notch at the 0 position disappears. 
 
8. Take the remaining shots in the series.
 
 When the series is done, the indicator scale returns to its original 
appearance, and you can then begin shooting the next series of brack-
eted shots.
 
9. To disable bracketing, press the BTK button and rotate the main com-
mand dial until the number of frames returns to 0.
 
Don’t be put off by the length of these steps, by the way. Although describing 
the feature takes quite a few words, using bracketing really isn’t all that com-
plicated. It’s just a matter of remembering to select which feature you want 
to bracket — and then keeping an eye on that bracketing progress indicator 
to see where you are in any particular bracketed series.

Manipulating Focus and Color
In This Chapter
▶ Controlling the camera’s autofocusing performance
▶ Using autofocus in Live View mode
▶ Understanding focal lengths, depth of field, and other focus factors
▶ Exploring white balance and its affect on color
▶ Investigating other advanced color options
T
o many people, the word focus has just one interpretation when applied to 
a photograph: Either the subject is in focus or it’s blurry. And it’s true — 
this characteristic of your photographs is an important one. There’s not much 
to appreciate about an image that’s so blurry that you can’t make out whether 
you’re looking at Peru or Peoria.
But an artful photographer knows that there’s more to focus 
than simply getting a sharp image of a subject. You also 
need to consider depth of field, or the distance over 
which objects remain sharply focused. This chapter 
explains all the ways to control depth of field, how 
to use your D90’s advanced autofocus options, and 
how to take advantage of autofocus in Live View 
mode.
In addition, this chapter dives into the topic of 
color, explaining your camera’s white balance con-
trol, which compensates for the varying color casts 
created by different light sources. You also can get my 
take on the other advanced color options on your D90, 
including the Color Space option and Picture Controls, in 
this chapter.

164
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Reviewing Focus Basics
I touch on various focus issues in Chapters 1, 2, and 5. But just in case you’re 
not reading this book from front to back, here’s a recap of the basic process 
of focusing with your D90.
 
These steps assume that Live View, introduced in Chapter 4, is not enabled. 
Focusing works a little differently in Live View mode; see the upcoming sec-
tion “Autofocusing in Live View mode” for details.
 
1. If you haven’t already done so, adjust the viewfinder focus to accom-
modate your eyesight.
 
 You accomplish this by using the diopter adjustment dial, located on the 
top-right edge of the little rubber eyepiece that covers the viewfinder. 
Chapter 1 details this step.
 
2. Set the focusing switch(es) to manual or automatic focusing.
 
 Depending on the type of lens 
you’re using, you need to set a 
switch on the lens, on the camera 
body, or both. (Figure 6-1 high-
lights the body switch and the 
lens switch as it appears on some 
Nikon lenses, including the 18–105 
AF-S lens sold in the D90 kit.)
 
• AF-S lenses: AF-S refers to a 
specific type of autofocus 
lens sold by Nikon (the 
18–105mm kit lens falls 
into this category). To 
focus manually, set the lens 
switch to the M position. 
For autofocusing, set the 
lens switch to A.
 
• AF lenses: Set both the lens 
and body switches to your 
desired focus mode.
 
• Manual-focus lenses: Set the switch on the camera body to M. (You 
can’t autofocus with these lenses.)
 
3. For handheld shooting, turn on Vibration Reduction.
 
 For sharper handheld shots, set the VR switch on the kit lens to On, as 
shown in Figure 6-1. If you use another lens that offers image stabiliza-
tion (it may go by a name other than Vibration Reduction), check the 
lens manual to find out how to turn the feature on.
Figure 6-1: Depending on your lens, you set 
the focus mode (manual or auto) on the lens, 
the camera body, or both.

165
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
4. Frame the picture so that your subject falls under one of the 11 auto-
focus points.
 
 The autofocus points are represented by the little black rectangles in 
the viewfinder.
 
5. To set focus in autofocus mode, press and hold the shutter button half-
way down.
 
 Depending on the lighting con-
ditions, the camera’s AF-assist 
illuminator on the front of the 
camera may emit a beam to 
help the autofocus system find 
its target. (If the light becomes 
a distraction, you can disable 
it through the Built-in AF-assist 
illuminator option, found on 
the Autofocus submenu of the 
Custom Setting menu. But the 
camera may have trouble locking 
focus, so you may need to focus 
manually.)
 
 When focus is established, the 
focus lamp in the viewfinder 
lights. The viewfinder indicators 
briefly turn red, and one or more 
of the focus points appears sur-
rounded by brackets, as shown in Figure 6-2. Those brackets indicate 
the active focusing points; any objects that fall under those points are 
in focus.
 
 The part of the frame the camera uses to establish focus depends on 
the current AF-area mode. To find out more about this issue, including 
how to select the focus point you want to use, check out the next 
section.
 
6. To set focus manually, twist the focusing ring on the lens.
 
 Even in manual mode, you can get some focusing help from the camera. 
When turning the focusing ring, press the shutter button halfway. If the 
object in an active autofocus point comes into focus, the viewfinder’s 
focus lamp lights up. For this feature to work, however, your lens must 
offer a maximum aperture of at least f/5.6.
 
7. Depress the shutter button fully to take the picture.

Figure 6-2: The brackets indicate the active 
focus points.

166
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
If for some reason you don’t want the active focus points to turn red when 
you press the shutter button halfway, you can disable the feature. Display the 
Custom Setting menu, display the Autofocus submenu, and set the AF Point 
Illumination option to Off. To return to the original setup, set the option to 
Auto. (The third setting, On, also produces the red highlights, but they aren’t 
adjusted to provide contrast with the background, as they are in Auto mode.)
Adjusting Autofocus Performance
 
You can adjust a number of aspects of your camera’s autofocusing system, 
but the two most important autofocusing decisions you need to make are:
 
✓ How the active focus point is selected (AF-area mode): You can select 
a single focus point or tell the camera to consider all 11 focusing points 
and then automatically choose the one it thinks is appropriate. You 
make this call through the AF-area mode option, which is tucked away 
on the Autofocus submenu of the Custom Setting menu.
 
✓ Whether focus is locked when you press the shutter button halfway 
(Autofocus mode): You can tell the camera to lock focus at that moment 
or continuously adjust focus as needed up to the time you actually take 
the picture. You control this option through the Autofocus mode setting.
The following sections fill in the details of these two options and also explain 
a few less critical autofocusing settings.
Understanding the AF-area mode setting
 
The AF-area mode option determines which of the 11 focusing points the 
camera uses to establish focus. (The AF in AF-area mode stands for auto-
focus). You can view the current setting in the Control panel and Shooting 
Information display, as shown in Figure 6-3. 
Shutter speed and blurry photos
A poorly focused photo isn’t always related to 
the issues discussed in this chapter. Any move-
ment of the camera or subject can also cause 
blur. Both of these problems are related to 
shutter speed, an exposure control that I cover 
in Chapter 5. Be sure to also visit Chapter 7, 
which provides some additional tips for cap-
turing moving objects without blur.

167
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 
Figure 6-3: The symbol for the current AF-area mode appears here.
You can choose from four settings, which work as described in the following 
list and are represented in the displays by the accompanying icons. (Note 
that the icons look slightly different depending on where you view them. 
The ones in the margins here are shown as they appear in the Shooting 
Information display.) 
 
 
✓ Single Point: This mode is designed for shooting still subjects. You 
select one of the 11 focus points, and the camera sets focus on the 
object that falls within that point. (See the upcoming section “Selecting a 
single focus point” for specifics on how to designate your chosen point.) 
The camera uses this mode by default when you shoot in the Close Up 
exposure mode.
 
 In the Control panel and Shooting Information display, the little brackets 
in the AF-area mode icon show you which point is selected. For example, 
an icon like the one you see in the margin here tells you that the center 
point is selected.
 
 
✓ Dynamic Area: In this mode, designed for shooting moving subjects, 
you select an initial focus point, just as in Single Point mode. But if the 
subject within that focus point moves after you press the shutter button 
halfway to set focus, the camera looks for focus information from the 
other focus points. The idea is that the subject is likely to wind up 
within one of the 11 focus areas. It’s the default setting when you shoot 
in the Sports exposure mode.
 
 However — and this is a biggie — in order for the automatic focus 
adjustment to occur, you also must set the Autofocus mode option 
(explained next) to either AF-A or AF-C. (AF-A is the default.) If you 
instead set that option to AF-S, which is designed for shooting still sub-
jects, the camera sticks with the initial focus point you select, even if the 
subject moves before you take the picture.
 
 In the displays, the icon for this mode looks similar to the one in the 
margin here. Your selected focus point is surrounded by brackets, 
but you also see little plus signs marking the other points. Note that 

168
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
the brackets surrounding your selected focus point don’t move if the 
camera shifts to a different point to focus, but the focus shift is happen-
ing just the same.
 
 
✓ Auto Area: The camera analyzes the objects under all 11 autofocus points 
and selects the one it deems most appropriate. This mode is the default set-
ting for all exposure modes except the Close Up mode and Sports mode.
 
 Note that in the Control panel, the icon for this mode shows all focus 
points surrounded by brackets, as shown on the left in Figure 6-3, remind-
ing you that the camera may select any of the 11 points. In the Shooting 
Info display, you don’t see the brackets, but the word Auto appears with 
the icon, as shown in the margin here and on the right in the figure.
 
 
✓ 3D Tracking: This one is a variation of Dynamic Area autofocusing — 
well, sort of. As with Dynamic Area mode, you start by selecting a single 
focus point (surrounded by brackets in the displays) and then press the 
shutter button halfway to set focus. But the goal of this mode is to main-
tain focus on your subject if you recompose the shot after you press the 
shutter button halfway to lock focus. Again, you have to set the 
Autofocus mode to AF-A or AF-C for this focus adjustment to occur.
 
 The only problem is that the way the camera detects your subject is by 
analyzing the colors of the object under your selected focus point. So if 
not much difference exists between the subject and other objects in the 
frame, the camera can get fooled. And if your subject moves out of the 
frame, you must release the shutter button and reset focus by pressing 
it halfway again.
 
 The 3D Tracking display icon looks identical to the Dynamic Area icon 
in the Control panel. In the Shooting Information display, a 3D label 
appears, as shown in the margin here.
 
If you’re feeling overwhelmed by all of your autofocus options (not to men-
tion all the other D90 features), Auto-area produces good results for most 
subjects. Personally, however, I rely on the first two modes because if the 
Auto mode makes the wrong focus assumptions, there’s no way to select a 
different focus point. So for still subjects, I stick with Single Point focus; for 
moving subjects, I go with Dynamic Area.
Whatever your conclusions on the subject, the next two sections show you 
how to adjust the AF-area mode and select a specific focus point. 
Changing the AF-area mode setting
To set the AF-area mode, open the Custom Setting menu and then select the 
Autofocus submenu. Press OK, highlight AF-area mode, as shown on the left 
in Figure 6-4, and then press OK again to display the available options, as

Figure 6-4: The AF-area mode setting lives on the Autofocus submenu of the Custom Setting 
 
menu.
 
If you find yourself changing the AF-area mode regularly, you can make it 
easier to access by setting the Fn (Function) button on the front of the camera 
to bring up the menu options. Or you can create a custom menu and put the 
option on the menu. Chapter 11 provides information about both features.
Selecting a single focus point
In any AF-area mode except Auto-area, take these steps to select a focus point:
 
1. Be sure that the Focus Selector Lock is set to the position shown on 
the left in Figure 6-5.
 
 That is, align the switch with the white circle and not the L.

a specific focus point.

2. Press the shutter button halfway and release it to engage the exposure 
meters.
 
3. Use the Multi Selector to select a focus point.
 
 The currently selected point is surrounded by brackets, as shown on the 
right in Figure 6-5.
A couple of tips about this process:
 
✓ To lock the selected focus point: If you want to ensure that an errant 
press of the Multi Selector doesn’t select a different point, set the Focus 
Selector Lock to the L position. Just remember to return the switch to 
its other position if you want to select a different focus point.
 
✓ To quickly select the center focus point: Press OK. No need to cycle 
your way through all the other focus points to get to the center.
 
✓ To change the focus-point wrapping style: Okay, so here’s an obscure 
customization option for you: Normally, when you select one of the 
outermost focus points, pressing the Multi Selector one more notch in 
the direction of that point has no effect. For example, if the top center 
point is selected, pressing the Multi Selector up accomplishes nothing. 
However, you can adjust this behavior so that the point selection “wraps 
around” the screen — so pressing the Multi Selector when that top 
center focus point is selected jumps you to bottom center focus point, 
and vice versa.
 
 If you’re into this level of control, you adjust the setting via the Custom 
Setting menu. Open the Autofocus submenu and then look for the Focus 
Point Wrap-Around option. Again, the default setting is No Wrap.
Changing the size of the center focus point
When you base autofocus on the 
center focus point, you can request 
that the camera does its thing based 
on a wider-than-normal area of the 
frame. Figure 6-6 shows you the dif-
ference between the normal and wide 
settings.
To make the adjustment, navigate to 
the Custom Setting menu and then to 
the Autofocus submenu. Press OK, 
highlight Center Focus point, and 
press OK again to access the two set-
tings. The Normal Zone option is the 
default (smaller zone) setting.
Wide zone

center focus point.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
When should you use the wide area? Well, it’s designed for subjects that don’t 
fit under the normal area marks or for subjects that are moving just slightly, 
and so might slip out of that normal area boundary. Think of a two-person 
portrait shot, for example, or perhaps a photo of someone delivering a speech 
from a lectern. Frankly, I don’t dig this far into the autofocusing weeds, though. 
If the camera can’t lock focus using the Normal Zone setting, I just switch to 
manual focusing — it’s a much faster, and easier, solution. And if you forget 
that wide-area focusing is enabled, you may have trouble focusing on smaller, 
nonmoving subjects the next time you use center-point autofocus.
Changing the Autofocus mode setting
 
The Autofocus mode setting determines what happens after you press the 
shutter button halfway to establish initial focus. There are three mode set-
tings, which work as follows:
 
✓ AF-S (single-servo autofocus): In this autofocus mode, which is geared 
to shooting stationary subjects, the camera locks focus when you 
depress the shutter button halfway.
 
 Use this mode if you want to frame your subject so that it doesn’t fall 
under an autofocus point: Compose the scene initially to put the subject 
under a focus point, press the shutter button halfway to lock focus, and 
then reframe to the composition you have in mind. As long as you keep 
the button pressed halfway, focus remains set on your subject.
 
✓ AF-C (continuous-servo autofocus): In this mode, which is designed for 
moving subjects, the camera focuses continuously for the entire time 
you hold the shutter button halfway down. Focus is adjusted as neces-
sary up to the time you take the shot. If you want to lock focus at a cer-
tain distance, you must press the AE-L/AF-L button, as described in the 
section, “Using autofocus lock,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ AF-A (auto-servo autofocus): This mode is the default setting. The 
camera analyzes the scene and, if it detects motion, automatically selects 
continuous-servo mode (AF-C). If the camera instead believes you’re 
shooting a stationary object, it selects single-servo mode (AF-S). This 
mode works pretty well, but it can get confused sometimes. For example, 
if your subject is motionless but other people are moving in the back-
ground, the camera may mistakenly switch to continuous autofocus. By 
the same token, if the subject is moving only slightly, the camera may not 
make the switch.
 
 In the Auto and Digital Vari-Program exposure modes, the Autofocus mode 
is reset to AF-A whenever you rotate the Mode dial to a different setting.

172
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 The current Autofocus mode setting appears in the Control panel and 
Shooting Information display, as shown in Figure 6-7. To adjust the setting, 
press and hold the AF button (on top of the camera) as you rotate the main 
command dial. While the button is pressed, all other setting data disappears 
from the Control panel and Shooting Information display. Release the AF 
button after you select the setting you want to use.
 
 
Figure 6-7: The Autofocus mode determines whether focus is locked when you press 
 
the shutter button halfway.
Choosing the right autofocus combo
 
You’ll get the best autofocus results if you pair your chosen Autofocus mode 
with the most appropriate AF-area mode, because the two settings work in 
tandem. Here are the combinations that I suggest for the maximum autofocus 
control:
 
✓ For still subjects, use Single Point as the AF-area mode and AF-S as the 
Autofocus mode. You then select a specific focus point, and the camera 
locks focus on that point at the time you press the shutter button half-
way. Focus remains locked on your subject even if you reframe the shot 
after you press the button halfway. (It helps to remember the s factor: 
For still subjects, Single Point and AF-S.)
 
✓ For moving subjects, set the AF-area mode to Dynamic Area and the 
Autofocus mode to AF-C. You still begin by selecting a focus point, but 
the camera adjusts focus as needed if your subject moves within the 
frame after you press the shutter button halfway to establish focus. 
(Think motion, dynamic, continuous.)
Again, though, if you’re not ready to delve into the whole issue, the default 
settings work pretty well for most shooting situations. For Autofocus mode, 
the default is AF-A; for AF-area mode, the default settings are Single Point for 
Close Up mode; Dynamic Area for Sports mode; and Auto-area for all other 
modes. 

173
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Using autofocus lock
When you set your camera’s Autofocus mode to AF-C (continuous-servo auto-
focus), pressing and holding the shutter button halfway initiates autofocus. 
But focusing is continually adjusted while you hold the shutter button halfway, 
so the focusing distance may change if the subject moves before you press 
the shutter button the rest of the way to take the picture. The same is true if 
you use AF-A mode (auto-servo autofocus) and the camera senses movement 
in front of the lens, in which case it shifts to AF-C mode and operates as I just 
described. Either way, the upshot is that you can’t control the exact focusing 
distance the camera ultimately uses.
Should you want to lock focus at a specific distance, you have a couple of 
options:
 
✓ Focus manually. 
 
✓ Change the Autofocus mode to AF-S (single-servo autofocus). In this mode, 
focus is locked when you press and hold the shutter button halfway.
 
AE-L
AF-L
 
✓ Use autofocus lock. First set focus by pressing the shutter button half-
way. When the focus is established at the distance you want, press and 
hold the AE-L/AF-L button, located near the viewfinder. Focus remains 
set as long as you hold the button down, even if you release the shutter 
button.
 
 Keep in mind, though, that by default, pressing the AE-L/AF-L button 
also locks in autoexposure if you’re shooting in the P, S, or A autoex-
posure modes. (Chapter 5 explains.) You can change this behavior, 
however, setting the button to lock just one or the other. Chapter 11 
explains this option as well as a couple other ways to customize the but-
ton’s function.
 
For my money, manual focusing is by far the easiest solution. Yes, it may take 
you a little while to get comfortable with manual focusing, but in the long 
run, you really save yourself a lot of time fiddling with the various autofocus 
settings, remembering which button initiates the focus lock, and so on. Just 
be sure that you have adjusted the viewfinder diopter to your eyesight, as 
explained in Chapter 1, so that there’s not a disconnect between what you 
see in the viewfinder and where the camera is actually focusing. After a little 
practice, focusing manually will become second nature to you. 
Autofocusing in Live View mode
Chapter 4 covers the basics of shooting in Live View mode, which enables 
you to compose your shots by using the camera monitor instead of the view-
finder. You can opt for Live View shooting for taking still pictures, and you’re 
required to use it to record movies.

174
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
As I mention in the Chapter 4 discussion, the simplest and most reliable 
focusing choice is to focus manually. That said, you can use autofocus in Live 
View mode if you prefer. 
 
If you do try Live View autofocusing, first set aside all the autofocusing infor-
mation presented heretofore in this chapter. All the settings related to normal 
autofocusing — AF-area mode, Autofocus mode, and the like — are irrelevant. 
Instead, you can choose from the following three autofocusing methods:
 
 
✓ Face Priority: Designed for portrait shooting, this mode attempts to 
hunt down and lock focus on faces when you press the shutter button 
halfway. This setting is chosen by default if you set the exposure Mode 
dial to the Portrait or Night Portrait setting.
 
 
✓ Wide Area: In this mode, you use the Multi Selector to move a little 
rectangular focusing frame around the screen to specify your desired 
focusing spot. When you press the shutter button halfway, the camera 
tries to lock focus on objects within the focusing frame. This mode is 
the default for all exposure modes except Portrait, Night Portrait, and 
Close Up modes.
 
 
✓ Normal Area: This mode works the same way as Wide Area autofocus-
ing but uses a smaller focusing frame. The idea is to enable you to base 
focus on a very specific area. It’s the default mode for pictures you take 
in the Close Up exposure mode.
 
 With such a small focusing frame, however, you can easily miss your 
focus target when handholding the camera. If you move the camera 
slightly just as you’re locking focus, and the focusing frame shifts off 
your subject as a result, focus will be incorrect. So for best results, use a 
tripod in this mode.
To use Live View autofocusing, first set the switch on your lens, the camera 
body, or both to the autofocus position. Remember, which switches you need 
to set depends on your lens; see the first section of this chapter for details. 
Then take these steps:
 
 
1. Press the Lv button (on the back of the camera, above the Multi 
Selector) to switch to Live View shooting.
 
 The viewfinder turns off, and your subject appears on the monitor, as 
shown in Figure 6-8. Note the following focus-related doodads:
 
• In the upper-right corner, you see an icon representing your 
selected autofocus mode.
 
• For Wide Area and Normal Area autofocus, you see the rectangular 
focusing frame, labeled in the figure. (The figure shows the frame 
at the size it appears in Wide Area mode.)
 
• In Face Priority mode, a yellow highlight appears around the sub-
ject’s face. (For scenes containing more than one person, focus is 

175
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
set on the closest one.) If you don’t see the highlight, the camera 
can’t detect your subject’s face, and it will set focus on the center 
of the frame.
 
Focusing frame
Autofocus mode
Figure 6-8: You see the Live View focusing frame only 
in the Wide Area and Normal Area autofocusing modes.
 
 
2. Adjust the autofocus mode if necessary.
 
 Just press the AF button while rotating the main command dial to cycle 
through your options. (You also can set the mode via the Live View 
Autofocus option, found on the Autofocus section of the Custom Setting 
menu. But that method requires exiting Live View mode.)
 
3. For Wide Area and Normal Area focusing, move the focusing frame 
over your subject.
 
 First, make sure that the Focus Selector Lock (refer to Figure 6-5) is set 
to the unlock position — the white circle, rather than the L. Then press 
the Multi Selector to move the focusing frame. 
 
4. Press the shutter button halfway to focus.
 
 When focus is set, the focusing frame or face-highlight box turns green. 
If the camera can’t establish focus, the focusing frame or face-highlight 
box blinks red.
 
5.  (Optional) Magnify the display to check focus.
 
 
 Press the Qual button to zoom in and get a close-up look at your subject. 
In Normal Area and Wide Area mode, you can press the Multi Selector to 
scroll the display if needed. In Face Priority mode, the camera automati-
cally keeps the face in the highlight box centered on the monitor.

176
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 
 To zoom out, press the ISO button. Or press OK to return to normal 
magnification.
 
 If focus is incorrect, release the shutter button and try again.
 
6. To record the picture, press the shutter button the rest of the way.
You can use these same steps to establish your initial focusing point when 
recording movies. Release the shutter button after focus is established and 
then press OK to start recording.
 
For both still and movie photography, though, be aware that there is no 
such thing as continuous autofocusing in Live View mode. After you press 
the shutter button halfway to set focus, focus is locked. In still photography 
mode, you must release the shutter button and then press it halfway again to 
adjust the focus point. In movie mode, you must stop recording, reset focus, 
and start the recording anew. For moving subjects, then, manual focusing 
makes life a lot easier.
Manipulating Depth of Field
Getting familiar with the concept of 
depth of field is one of the biggest 
steps you can take to becoming a 
more artful photographer. I introduce 
you to depth of field in Chapters 2 
and 5, but here’s a quick recap just to 
hammer home the lesson:
 
✓ Depth of field refers to the 
distance over which objects in 
a photograph appear sharply 
focused.
 
✓ With a shallow, or small, depth 
of field, distant objects appear 
more softly focused than the 
main subject (assuming that 
you set focus on the main sub-
ject, of course).
 
✓ With a large depth of field, the 
zone of sharp focus extends to 
include objects at a distance 
from your subject.
Which arrangement works best 
depends entirely on your creative 
vision and your subject. In portraits, 
Aperture, f/5.6; Focal length, 300mm
Figure 6-9: A shallow depth of field blurs the 
background and draws added attention to the 
subject.

177
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
for example, a classic technique 
is to use a short depth of field, as 
I did for the photo in Figure 6-9. 
This approach increases empha-
sis on the subject while diminish-
ing the impact of the background. 
But for the photo shown in Figure 
6-10, I wanted to emphasize that 
the foreground figures were in St. 
Peter’s Square, at the Vatican, so I 
used a large depth of field, which 
kept the background buildings 
sharply focused and gave them 
equal weight in the scene.
So exactly how do you adjust 
depth of field? You have three 
points of control: aperture, focal 
length, and camera-to-subject 
distance, as spelled out in the 
following list:
 
✓ Aperture setting (f-stop): 
The aperture is one of 
three exposure settings, all 
explained fully in Chapter 5. 
Depth of field increases as 
you stop down the aperture 
(by choosing a higher f-stop 
number). For shallow depth 
of field, open the aperture 
(by choosing a lower f-stop number). Figure 6-11 offers an example; in 
the f/22 version, focus is sharp all the way through the frame; in the f/13 
version, focus softens as the distance from the center lure increases. I 
snapped both images using the same focal length and camera-to-subject 
distance, setting focus on the center lure.
 
✓ Lens focal length: In lay terms, focal length determines what the lens 
“sees.” As you increase focal length, measured in millimeters, the angle 
of view narrows, objects appear larger in the frame, and — the important 
point for this discussion — depth of field decreases. Additionally, the 
spatial relationship of objects changes as you adjust focal length. As an 
example, Figure 6-12 compares the same scene shot at a focal length of 
127mm and 183mm. I used the same aperture, f/5.6, for both examples.
 
 Whether you have any focal length flexibility depends on your lens: If 
you have a zoom lens, you can adjust the focal length — just zoom in or 
out. (The D90 kit lens, for example, offers a focal range of 18–105mm.) 
If you don’t have a zoom lens, the focal length is fixed, so scratch this 
means of manipulating depth of field.

foreground and background subjects in focus.

 For more technical details about focal length and your D90, see the side-
bar “Fun facts about focal length.”
 
✓ Camera-to-subject distance: As you move the lens closer to your sub-
ject, depth of field decreases. This assumes that you don’t zoom in or 
out to reframe the picture, thereby changing the focal length. If you do, 
depth of field is affected by both the camera position and focal length.

Figure 6-12: Zooming to a longer focal length also reduces depth of field.
 
Together, these three factors determine the maximum and minimum depth of 
field that you can achieve, as illustrated by my clever artwork in Figure 6-13 
and summed up in the following list:
 
✓ To produce the shallowest depth of field: Open the aperture as wide 
as possible (the lowest f-stop number), zoom in to the maximum focal 
length of your lens, and get as close as possible to your subject.
 
✓ To produce maximum depth of field: Stop down the aperture to the 
highest possible f-stop number, zoom out to the shortest focal length 
your lens offers, and move farther from your subject.

180
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Fun facts about focal length
Every lens can be characterized by its focal 
length, or in the case of a zoom lens, the range of 
focal lengths it offers. Measured in millimeters, 
focal length determines the camera’s angle of 
view, the apparent size and distance of objects 
in the scene, and depth of field. According to 
photography tradition, a focal length of 50mm is 
described as a “normal” lens. Most point-and-
shoot cameras feature this focal length, which 
is a medium-range lens that works well for the 
type of snapshots that users of those kinds of 
cameras are likely to shoot.
A lens with a focal length under 35mm is charac-
terized as a wide-angle lens because at that focal 
length, the camera has a wide angle of view and 
produces a large depth of field, making it good for 
landscape photography. A short focal length also 
has the effect of making objects seem smaller 
and farther away. At the other end of the spec-
trum, a lens with a focal length longer than 80mm 
is considered a telephoto lens and often referred 
to as a long lens. With a long lens, angle of view 
narrows, depth of field decreases, and faraway 
subjects appear closer and larger, which is ideal 
for wildlife and sports photographers.
Note, however, that the focal lengths stated here 
and elsewhere in the book are so-called 35mm 
equivalent focal lengths. Here’s the deal: For rea-
sons that aren’t really important, when you put a 
standard lens on most digital cameras, including 
your D90, the available frame area is reduced, as 
if you took a picture on a camera that uses 35mm 
film negatives (the kind you’ve probably been 
using for years) and then cropped it.
This so-called crop factor, sometimes also 
called the magnification factor, varies depend-
ing on the digital camera, which is why the photo 
industry adopted the 35mm-equivalent measur-
ing stick as a standard. With the D90, the crop-
ping factor is roughly 1.5. So the 18–105mm kit 
lens, for example, actually captures the approx-
imate area you would get from a 27–160mm lens 
on a 35mm film camera. In the figure here, for 
example, the red outline indicates the image 
area that results from the 1.5 crop factor.
Note that although the area the lens can capture 
changes when you move a lens from a 35mm 
film camera to a digital body, depth of field isn’t 
affected, nor are the spatial relationships between 
objects in the frame. So when lens shopping, you 
gauge those two characteristics of the lens by 
looking at the stated focal length — no digital-to-
film conversion math is required.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Just to avoid a possible point of confusion that has arisen in some of the 
classes I teach: When I say zoom in, some students think that I mean to twist 
the zoom barrel in toward the camera body. But in fact, the phrase zoom in 
means to zoom to a longer focal length, which produces the visual effect of 
bringing your subject closer. This requires twisting the zoom barrel of the 
lens so that it extends further out from the camera. And the phrase zoom out 
refers to the opposite maneuver: I’m talking about widening your view of the 
subject by zooming to a shorter focal length, which requires moving the lens 
barrel in toward the camera body.
 
Greater depth of field:
Select higher f-stop
Decrease focal length (zoom out)
Move farther from subject
Shorter depth of field:
Select lower f-stop
Increase focal length (zoom in)
Move closer to subject
 
Figure 6-13: Your f-stop, focal length, and shooting distance determine depth of field.
Here are a few additional tips and tricks related to depth of field:
 
✓ Aperture-priority autoexposure mode (A) enables you to easily con-
trol depth of field. In this mode, detailed fully in Chapter 5, you set the 
f-stop, and the camera selects the appropriate shutter speed to produce 
a good exposure. The range of aperture settings you can access depends 
on your lens.
 
 Even in aperture-priority mode, keep an eye on shutter speed as well. To 
maintain the same exposure, shutter speed must change in tandem with 
aperture, and you may encounter a situation where the shutter speed 
is too slow to permit hand-holding of the camera. Lenses that offer opti-
cal image stabilization, or vibration reduction (VR lenses, in the Nikon 
world), do enable most people to use a slower shutter speed than normal, 
but double-check your results just to be sure. Or use a tripod for extra 
security. Of course, all this assumes that you have dialed in a specific 

182
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
ISO Sensitivity setting; if you instead are using Auto ISO adjustment, the 
camera may adjust the ISO setting instead of shutter speed. (Chapter 5 
explores the whole aperture/shutter speed/ ISO relationship.)
 
✓ Press the Depth-of-Field Preview button to get an idea of how your 
f-stop will affect depth of field. When you look through your viewfinder 
and press the shutter button halfway, you can get only a partial indication 
of the depth of field that your current camera settings will produce. You 
can see the effect of focal 
length and the camera-
to-subject distance, but 
because the aperture is 
always fully open until 
you actually take the 
picture, the viewfinder 
doesn’t show you how 
your selected f-stop will 
affect depth of field.
 
 By using the Depth-of-
Field Preview button on 
your camera, however, 
you can preview the 
f-stop’s impact. Almost 
hidden away on the 
front of your camera, 
the button is labeled in 
Figure 6-14. (I removed 
the lens for the picture to 
make the button easier to 
see.) When you press the 
button, the camera tem-
porarily sets the aperture 
to your selected f-stop 
so that you can preview 
depth of field. At small 
apertures (high f-stop settings), the viewfinder display may become 
quite dark, but this doesn’t indicate a problem with exposure — it’s just 
a function of how the preview works.
 
 In P, S, A, and M exposure modes, you can tell the camera to emit a so-
called modeling flash when you preview depth-of-field and have flash 
enabled. By default, the modeling flash is turned off; if you want to experi-
ment with this feature, visit the flash discussion in Chapter 5 for details. 
 
✓ Portrait and Close Up modes are designed to produce shallow depth 
of field; Landscape mode is designed for large depth of field. You can’t 
adjust aperture in these modes, however, so you’re limited to the set-
ting the camera chooses. In addition, the extent to which the camera can

183
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
select an appropriate f-stop depends on the lighting conditions. If you’re 
shooting in Landscape mode at dusk, for example, the camera may have 
to open the aperture to a wide setting to produce a good exposure.
 
✓ For greater background blurring, move the subject farther from the 
background. The extent to which background focus shifts as you adjust 
depth of field also is affected by the distance between the subject and 
the background. For increased background blurring, move the subject 
farther in front of the background.
Controlling Color
Compared with understanding some aspects of digital photography — reso-
lution, aperture and shutter speed, depth of field, and so on — making sense 
of your camera’s color options is easy-breezy. First, color problems aren’t 
all that common, and when they are, they’re usually simple to fix with a 
quick shift of your D90’s white balance control. And getting a grip on color 
requires learning only a couple of new terms, an unusual state of affairs for 
an endeavor that often seems more like high-tech science than art.
The rest of this chapter explains the aforementioned white balance control, 
plus a couple of menu options that enable you to fine-tune the way your 
camera renders colors. For information on how to use the Retouch menu’s 
color options to alter colors of existing pictures, see Chapter 10.
Correcting colors with white balance
Every light source emits a particular color 
cast. The old-fashioned fluorescent lights 
found in most public restrooms, for example, 
put out a bluish-greenish light, which is why 
our reflections in the mirrors in those rest-
rooms always look so sickly. And if you think 
that your beloved looks especially attractive 
by candlelight, you aren’t imagining things: 
Candlelight casts a warm, yellow-red glow that 
is flattering to the skin.
 
Science-y types measure the color of light, 
officially known as color temperature, on the 
Kelvin scale, which is named after its creator. 
You can see the Kelvin scale in Figure 6-15.
When photographers talk about “warm light” 
and “cool light,” though, they aren’t referring 
to the position on the Kelvin scale — or at least 
not in the way we usually think of temperatures,

with a higher number meaning hotter. Instead, the terms describe the visual 
appearance of the light. Warm light, produced by candles and incandescent 
lights, falls in the red-yellow spectrum you see at the bottom of the Kelvin scale 
in Figure 6-15; cool light, in the blue-green spectrum, appears at the top of the 
Kelvin scale. 
At any rate, most of us don’t notice these fluctuating colors of light because 
our eyes automatically compensate for them. Except in very extreme light-
ing conditions, a white tablecloth appears white to us no matter whether we 
view it by candlelight, fluorescent light, or regular houselights.
Similarly, a digital camera compensates for different colors of light through 
a feature known as white balancing. Simply put, white balancing neutralizes 
light so that whites are always white, which in turn ensures that other colors 
are rendered accurately. If the camera senses warm light, it shifts colors 
slightly to the cool side of the color spectrum; in cool light, the camera shifts 
colors the opposite direction.
The good news is that, as with your eyes, your camera’s Auto white balance 
setting tackles this process remarkably well in most situations, which means 
that you can usually ignore it and concentrate on other aspects of your pic-
ture. But if your scene is lit by two or more light sources that cast different 
colors, the white balance sensor can get confused, producing an unwanted 
color cast like the one you see in the left image in Figure 6-16.
I shot this product image in my home studio, which I light primarily with a 
couple of high-powered photo lights that use tungsten bulbs, which produce 
light with a color temperature similar to regular household incandescent 
bulbs. The problem is that the windows in that room also permit some pretty 
strong daylight to filter through. In Auto white balance mode, the camera 
reacted to that daylight — which has a cool color cast — and applied too 
much warming, giving my original image a yellow tint. No problem: I just 
switched the white balance mode from Auto to the Incandescent setting. The 
right image in Figure 6-16 shows the corrected colors.
 
There’s one little problem with white balancing as it’s implemented on your 
D90, though. You can’t make this kind of manual white balance selection if 
you shoot in the Auto mode or the Digital Vari-Program scene modes. So if 
you spy color problems in your camera monitor, you need to switch to either 
P, S, A, or M exposure mode. (Chapter 5 details all four modes.)
The next section explains precisely how to make a simple white balance 
correction; following that, you can explore some advanced white balance 
options.

mode (left); switching to the Incandescent setting solved the problem (right).
Changing the white balance setting
The current white balance setting appears in the Control panel and Shooting 
Information display, as shown in Figure 6-17. The settings are represented by 
the icons you see in Table 6-1.

 The quickest way to change the setting is to press and hold the WB button as 
you rotate the main command dial. But note these factoids:
 
✓ Adjusting white balance through the Shooting menu: You also can 
change the white balance setting from the Shooting menu. After high-
lighting the White Balance setting, press OK to display the list of 
options. Highlight the one you want to use and press OK. For all settings 
except PRE (Preset Manual), K, and Fluorescent, you’re taken to a screen 
where you can fine-tune the amount of adjustment the camera applies 
to colors. See the next section for details. If you don’t want to make any 
adjustment, just press OK.
 
✓ Specifying a color temperature through the K white-balance setting: If 
you know the exact color temperature of your light source — perhaps 
you’re using some special studio bulbs, for example — you can tell the 
camera to balance colors for that precise temperature. (Well, techni-
cally, you have to choose from a preset list of temperatures, but you 
should be able to get close to the temperature you have in mind.) First, 
select the K white balance setting. (K for Kelvin, get it?) Then, while 
pressing the WB button, rotate the subcommand dial to set the color 
temperature, which appears at the top of the Control panel and Shooting 
Information display, as shown in Figure 6-18.

187
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 
Figure 6-18: You can set white balance to a specific Kelvin temperature by using the K setting. 
 
 You also can set the temperature through the White Balance option on 
the Shooting menu. If you do, you see the fine-tuning screen after you 
select the temperature and press OK. Again, just press OK to exit the 
screen without making any adjustment. 
 
✓ Specifying a fluorescent bulb type: For the Fluorescent setting, you 
can select from seven types of bulbs. To do so, you must go through the 
Shooting menu. Select Fluorescent as the White Balance setting and then 
press OK to display the list of bulbs, as shown in Figure 6-19. Select the 
option that most closely matches your bulbs and then press OK. Press 
OK again, and you’re taken to the fine-tuning screen. If you don’t want to 
make any further adjustment, just press OK once more to return to the 
Shooting menu. 
 
 After you select a fluorescent bulb type, that option is always used when 
you use the WB button to select the Fluorescent white balance setting. 
Again, you can change the bulb type only through the Shooting menu.
 
 
Figure 6-19: You can select a specific type of fluorescent bulb.

188
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Creating a custom white balance preset: The PRE (Preset Manual) 
option enables you to create and store a precise, customized white bal-
ance setting, as explained in the upcoming “Creating white balance pre-
sets” section. This setting is the fastest way to achieve accurate colors 
when your scene is lit by multiple light sources that have differing color 
temperatures. 
 
Your selected white balance setting remains in force for the P, S, A, and M 
exposure modes until you change it. So you may want to get in the habit of 
resetting the option to the Auto setting after you finish shooting whatever 
subject it was that caused you to switch to manual white balance mode.
Fine-tuning white balance settings
You can fine-tune any white balance setting (Daylight, Cloudy, and so on). For 
the greatest amount of control, make the adjustment as spelled out in these 
steps: 
 
1. Display the Shooting menu, highlight White Balance, and press OK.
 
2. Highlight the white balance setting you want to adjust, as shown on 
the left in Figure 6-20, and press OK.
 
 Now you’re taken to a screen where you can do your fine-tuning, as 
shown on the right in Figure 6-20.
 
 If you select Fluorescent or K (Choose Color Temperature), you first go 
to a screen where you select a specific type of bulb or Kelvin color tem-
perature, as covered in the preceding section. After you highlight your 
choice, press OK to get to the fine-tuning screen. For custom presets 
that you create, you must select the preset you want to use and press 
OK. (See the next section for an explanation of presets.)
 
White balance shift marker
 
Figure 6-20: You can fine-tune the white balance settings via the Shooting menu.

189
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
3. Fine-tune the setting by using the Multi Selector to move the white bal-
ance shift marker in the color grid.
 
 The grid is set up around two color pairs: Green and Magenta, rep-
resented by G and M; and Blue and Amber, represented by B and A. 
By pressing the Multi Selector, you can move the adjustment marker 
around the grid. 
 
 As you move the marker, the A–B and G–M boxes on the right side of 
the screen show you the current amount of color shift. A value of 0 indi-
cates the default amount of color compensation applied by the selected 
white balance setting. In Figure 6-20, for example, I moved the marker 
two levels toward amber and two levels toward magenta to specify that I 
wanted colors to be a tad warmer.
 
 If you’re familiar with traditional colored lens filters, you may know that 
the density of a filter, which determines the degree of color correction it 
provides, is measured in mireds (pronounced my-redds). The white bal-
ance grid is designed around this system: Moving the marker one level is 
the equivalent of adding a filter with a density of 5 mireds.
 
4. Press OK to complete the adjustment.
After you adjust a white balance setting, an asterisk appears next to that set-
ting in the White Balance menu. In the Control panel and Shooting Information 
display, you instead see a pair of triangles to indicate the adjustment.
 
If you want to apply a white balance shift on only the blue-to-amber axis, 
you don’t have to go through the Shooting menu. Instead, press and hold 
the WB button and then rotate the subcommand dial. You see the amount 
of adjustment in the Control panel and Shooting Information display, as 
shown in Figure 6-21, while the button is pressed. An a value indicates a 
shift toward the amber direction; a b value, towards blue. For example, 
in the figure, the b5 value shows that I shifted the setting five steps toward 
blue (b). The two-triangle symbol reminding you of the adjustment also 
appears.
 
Here’s one other tip specifically related to shifting white balance along 
the blue-to-amber axis: By using a feature called white balance bracketing, 
you can automatically record your picture with and without that shift. You 
can even record one picture with no shift, one with an amber shift, and 
one with a blue shift. See the later section “Bracketing white balance” for 
details.

Creating white balance presets
 
If none of the standard white balance settings do the trick and you don’t want 
to fool with fine-tuning them, take advantage of the PRE (Preset Manual) fea-
ture. This option enables you to do two things:
 
✓ Base white balance on a direct measurement of the actual lighting 
conditions.
 
✓ Match white balance to an existing photo. 
You can create and store up to five custom white balance presets, which are 
assigned the names d-0 through d-4. The next two sections provide you with 
the step-by-step instructions; following that, you can find out how to select 
and manage your presets.
Setting white balance with direct measurement
To use this technique, you need a piece of card stock that’s either neutral 
gray or absolute white — not eggshell white, sand white, or any other close-
but-not-perfect white. (You can buy reference cards made just for this pur-
pose in many camera stores for under $20.)
Position the reference card so that it receives the same lighting you’ll use for 
your photo. Then take these steps:

191
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
1. Set the camera to the P, S, A, or M exposure mode.
 
 If the exposure meter reports that your image will be under- or overex-
posed at the current exposure settings, make the necessary adjustments 
now. (Chapter 5 tells you how.) Otherwise, the camera won’t be able to 
create your custom white balance preset.
 
2. Frame your shot so that the reference card completely fills the 
viewfinder.
 
 
3. Press the WB button while rotating the main command dial to choose 
the PRE (Preset Manual) white balance setting.
 
 
 You see the letters PRE in the white balance area of the Control panel, as 
shown in Figure 6-22, as well as in the Shooting Information display.
 
4. Release the button and then immediately press and hold it again until 
the letters PRE begin flashing in the Control panel.
 
 You can also see the flashing letters in the viewfinder.
 
5. Release the WB button and take a picture of the gray card before the 
PRE warning stops flashing.
 
 You’ve got about six seconds to snap the picture.
 
 If the camera is successful at recording the white balance data, the 
letters Gd flash in the viewfinder. In the Control panel, the word Good 
flashes. If you instead see the message No Gd, try adjusting your lighting 
and then try again.
 
When you create a preset this way, the camera automatically stores your 
setting as Preset d-0. (The other presets are named d-1 through d-4.) So any 
time you want to select and use 
the preset, press the WB button 
and rotate the main command dial 
to select PRE, as in Step 3. Then 
rotate the subcommand dial while 
pressing the button to select d-0, as 
shown in Figure 6-22. (The Shooting 
Information display shows the 
same data when you press the WB 
button.) You also can select the 
preset through the White Balance 
option on the Shooting menu; see 
the upcoming section “Selecting a 
preset” for a few critical details on 
that method.
Preset number
Figure 6-22: Preset d-0 is always used for the 
most recent direct-measurement preset.

192
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Each time you go through these steps, your d-0 preset is replaced by the new 
white balance data you record. However, you can preserve your original 
preset by copying it to one of the other preset slots. See the upcoming sec-
tion “Managing presets” for details on how to copy your preset as well as 
how to select it when you’re ready to shoot.
Matching white balance to an existing photo
Suppose that you’re the marketing manager for a small business, and one of 
your jobs is to shoot portraits of the company big-wigs for the annual report. 
You build a small studio just for that purpose, complete with a couple of pho-
tography lights and a nice, conservative beige backdrop.
Of course, the big-wigs can’t all come to get their pictures taken in the same 
month, let alone on the same day. But you have to make sure that the colors 
in that beige backdrop remain consistent for each shot, no matter how much 
time passes between photo sessions. This scenario is one possible use for an 
advanced white balance feature that enables you to base white balance on an 
existing photo.
 
Basing white balance on an existing photo works well only in strictly con-
trolled lighting situations, where the color temperature of your lights is con-
sistent from day to day. Otherwise, the white balance setting that produces 
color accuracy when you shoot Big Boss Number One may add an ugly color 
cast to the one you snap of Big Boss Number Two.
To give this option a try, follow these steps:
 
1. Copy the picture that you want to use as the reference photo to your 
camera memory card, if it isn’t already stored there.
 
 You can copy the picture to the card using a card reader and whatever 
method you usually use to transfer files from one drive to another. 
Copy the file to the folder named DCIM, inside the main folder, named 
100NCD90 by default. (See Chapter 8 for help with working with files and 
folders.)
 
2. Open the Shooting menu, highlight White Balance, and press OK.
 
3. Select PRE (Preset Manual) and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You must scroll to the second page of White Balance settings to uncover 
the PRE setting. After you press the Multi Selector right, the screen 
shown on the left in Figure 6-23 appears. The five thumbnails represent 
the five preset slots, d-0 through d-4.
 
4.  Use the Multi Selector to highlight any preset except d-0.
 
 The d-0 preset is always used for white balance settings you create by 
taking a picture of a reference card, as described in the preceding section.

193
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 
Figure 6-23: Select Preset d-1 through d-4; d-0 is reserved for direct-measurement presets.
 
 
5. Press the ISO button.
 
 Now you see the menu shown on the right in Figure 6-23.
 
6. Highlight Select Image and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You see thumbnails of your photos. 
 
7. Use the Multi Selector to move the yellow highlight box over the 
picture you want to use as your white balance photo.
 
8. Press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the screen showing your white balance preset 
thumbnails. The thumbnail for the photo you selected in Step 7 appears 
as the thumbnail for the preset slot you chose in Step 4. 
 
9. Press Menu to return to the Shooting menu.
 
 The white balance setting you just created is now selected.
 
 If you press OK instead of the Menu button in Step 8, you can access the 
fine-tuning color grid, described in the earlier section “Fine-tuning white 
balance settings.”
Selecting a preset
After creating white balance presets, select the one you want to use in two 
ways:
 
 
✓ Use the WB button together with the command dials. First, select PRE as 
the white balance setting by pressing the WB button as you rotate the 
main command dial. Keep holding the button and rotate the subcommand 
dial to cycle through the available presets (d-0 through d-4). The number 
of the selected preset appears in the Control panel and Shooting 
Information display while the button is pressed.

194
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Use the White Balance option on the Shooting menu. Open the 
Shooting menu, select White Balance, press OK, highlight PRE (Preset 
Manual) and press the Multi Selector right. You then see the screen 
that contains thumbnails for all your presets. (Refer to the left screen 
in Figure 6-23.) Use the Multi Selector to place the yellow highlight box 
over the preset you want to use and then press OK. You’re taken to the 
fine-tuning screen that appears any time you select a white balance set-
ting from the menu; press OK to exit the screen without adjusting the 
setting.
Managing presets
Just to recap this whole white balance preset deal:
 
✓ You can create up to five presets, which take the names d-0 through d-4.
 
✓ Preset d-0 is always used for the most recent preset you created through 
the direct measurement method (where you take a photo of a reference 
card).
 
✓ Presets d-1 through d-4 can be assigned to presets based on photos.
 
✓ If you want to create more than one preset through direct measurement, 
you can copy the existing d-0 setting to one of the other four preset slots 
before doing another direct measurement. This feature is very handy if 
you regularly use different studio or lighting setups, by the way. You can 
create one direct-measurement preset for a home studio, for example, 
and another for a work studio.
To copy Preset d-0 to another slot, take these steps:
 
1. Select the White Balance option on the Shooting menu and press OK.
 
2. Select PRE (Preset Manual), and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You see the thumbnails representing the five presets. For example, 
the left image in Figure 6-24 shows the d-0 position held by an existing 
direct-measurement preset and d-1 held by a preset based on a photo. 
 
3. Highlight the slot where you want to copy your d-0 preset.
 
 Use the Multi Selector to place the yellow highlight box around the slot. 
In the figure, I selected an empty slot (d-2), but you can also copy over 
an existing preset. (The preset that has the yellow label — d-1 in the 
figure — represents your current white balance setting; it doesn’t relate 
to this operation.)

195
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 
Figure 6-24: To create an additional direct-measurement preset, first copy the existing one 
 
from d-0 to another slot (d1–d4).
 
4. Press the ISO button to display the menu shown on the right in the 
figure.
 
5. Highlight Copy d-0 and press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the preset thumbnails screen, and your original d-0 
preset now occupies both d-0 and the slot you selected in Step 3. You 
can now create your second direct-measurement preset, which will take 
over the d-0 position.
 
Finally, you also can add a brief text 
comment to describe each preset. 
For example, you might add the label 
“home studio” to one preset and 
“work studio” to another to help you 
remember which is which. The label 
then appears with the preset thumb-
nail, as shown in Figure 6-25. 
To enter a comment, take the exact 
same steps as you do to copy a preset, 
but instead of choosing Copy d-0 in 
Step 5, select Edit Comment and press 
the Multi Selector right. You then see a 
screen where you can enter your text. 
The specific text-entry steps are the 
same as you use for entering image comments, which I detail in Chapter 11, so I 
won’t repeat them here.

each preset.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Bracketing white balance
Chapter 5 introduces you to your camera’s automatic bracketing feature, 
which enables you to easily record the same image at several different 
exposure settings. In addition to being able to bracket autoexposure, flash, and 
Active D-Lighting settings, you can use the feature to bracket white balance. 
 
Note a couple of things about this feature:
 
✓ You can bracket JPEG shots only. You can’t use white balance bracket-
ing if you set the camera’s Image Quality setting to either Raw (NEF) or 
Raw+Fine. And frankly, there isn’t any need to do so because you can 
precisely tune colors of Raw files when you process them in your Raw 
converter. Chapter 8 has details on Raw processing.
 
✓ You can apply white balance bracketing only along the blue-to-amber 
axis of the fine-tuning color grid. You can’t shift colors along the green-
to-magenta axis, as you can when tweaking a specific white balance 
setting. (For a reminder of this feature, refer to the earlier section “Fine-
Tuning white balance settings”.)
 
✓ You can shift colors a maximum of three steps in either direction. This 
gives you half the level of adjustment as when you fine-tune white bal-
ance. (For those familiar with traditional lens filters, each step on the 
axis is equivalent to a filter density of five mireds.)
When you use white-balance bracketing, you can request that the camera 
record the bracketed images so that they are progressively more blue or more 
amber. Or you can record one image that’s pushed toward blue and another 
that leans toward amber. Regardless, you also get one shot that’s “neutral” — 
that is, recorded at the current white balance setting, without any adjustment.
I used white balance bracketing to record the three candle photos in Figure 
6-26. For the blue and amber versions, I set the bracketing to shift colors the 
maximum three steps. As you can see, even at that maximum setting, the 
color differences between the shots are subtle. In this photo, I find the differ-
ences most noticeable in the color of the backdrop.
To apply white balance bracketing, you first need to take these steps:
 
1. Set your camera to the P, S, A, or M exposure mode.
 
 White balance options are available only in these modes.
 
2. Set the Image Quality setting to one of the JPEG options (Fine, 
Normal, or Basic).
 
 You can adjust the setting through the Shooting menu. (See Chapter 3 
for a full explanation of the JPEG options.)
 
3. Display the Custom Setting menu, select the Bracketing/Flash sub-
menu, and press OK.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
4. Select Auto Bracketing Set, as shown on the left in Figure 6-27, and 
press OK.
 
 You see the screen shown on the right in the figure.
 
5. Select WB Bracketing and press OK.
 
 The bracketing feature is now set up to adjust white balance between 
your bracketed shots. (Exposure, flash, and Active D-Lighting are not 
bracketed.)

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
From here on, bracketing works as detailed in the steps at the end of Chapter 5. 
Rather than repeating everything here, I’ll save some page space and provide 
just a quick summary of how to establish the bracketing settings.
 
✓ To set the number of frames and direction of the bracketing adjust-
ment: Press and hold the BKT button (left-front side of the camera) 
while rotating the main command dial. For white balance bracketing, the 
options are as follows: 
 
• b2F: This setting records two frames, one without any adjustment 
and one shifted toward blue.
 
• a2F: Again, you get two frames, but the second is shifted toward 
amber.
 
• 3F: This setting records three frames, with one neutral, one pushed 
toward amber, and one shifted toward blue. I used this option to 
create the candle variations in Figure 6-27.
 
• 0F: Select this setting to turn off bracketing.
 
✓ To set the amount of white-balance adjustment: Press the BKT button 
and rotate the subcommand dial. Again, you can set the bracketing 
amount to 1, 2, or 3.
While the BKT button is pressed, you can view both settings in the Control 
panel and Shooting Info display. When you release the button, you see the 
same BKT symbol and progress indicator that appears when you bracket 
exposure settings. (Again, check out Chapter 5 for details.) 
After establishing the bracketing parameters, just shoot your bracketed 
frames. Bracketing remains in force until you disable it (by setting the frame 
number to 0F). 
Choosing a Color Space: sRGB vs. Adobe RGB
By default, your camera captures images using the sRGB color mode, which 
simply refers to an industry-standard spectrum of colors. (The s is for stan-
dard, and the RGB is for red-green-blue, which are the primary colors in the 
digital color world.) The sRGB color mode was created to help ensure color 
consistency as an image moves from camera (or scanner) to monitor and 
printer; the idea was to create a spectrum of colors that all of these devices 
can reproduce.
However, the sRGB color spectrum leaves out some colors that can be repro-
duced in print and onscreen, at least by some devices. So as an alternative, 
your camera also enables you to shoot in the Adobe RGB color mode, which 
includes a larger spectrum (or gamut) of colors. Figure 6-28 offers an illustra-
tion of the two spectrums.

199
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
Visible Spectrum
Adobe RGB
sRGB
 
Figure 6-28: Adobe RGB includes some colors not found in the 
 
sRGB spectrum.
Some colors in the Adobe RGB spectrum cannot be reproduced in print. (The 
printer just substitutes the closest printable color, if necessary.) Still, I usu-
ally shoot in Adobe RGB mode because I see no reason to limit myself to a 
smaller spectrum from the get-go.
However, just because I use Adobe RGB doesn’t mean that it’s right for you. 
First, if you plan to print and share your photos without making any adjust-
ments in your photo editor, you’re usually better off sticking with sRGB, 
because most printers and Web browsers are designed around that color 
space. Second, know that in order to retain all your original Adobe RGB 
colors when you work with your photos, your editing software must support 
that color space — not all programs do. You also must be willing to study the 
whole topic of digital color a little bit because you need to use some specific 
settings to avoid really mucking up the color works.
If you want to go with Adobe RGB instead of sRGB, visit the Shooting menu 
and highlight the Color Space option, as shown on the left in Figure 6-29. 
Press OK to display the screen shown on the right in the figure. Select Adobe 
RGB and press OK again.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 
Figure 6-29: Choose Adobe RGB for a broader color spectrum.
 
You can tell whether you captured an image in the Adobe RGB format by 
looking at its filename: Adobe RGB images start with an underscore, as in 
_DSC0627.jpg. For pictures captured in the sRGB color space, the underscore 
appears in the middle of the filename, as in DSC_0627.jpg. See Chapter 4 for 
more tips on decoding picture filenames.
Taking a Quick Look at Picture Controls
Perched at the top of the Shooting menu, an option called Set Picture 
Control, shown in Figure 6-30, offers one more way to tweak image sharpen-
ing, color, and contrast when you shoot in the P, S, A, and M exposure modes 
and choose one of the JPEG options or the Image Quality setting, also found 
on the Shooting Menu.
 
 
Figure 6-30: Picture Controls apply preset adjustments to color, sharpening, and other 
 
photo characteristics to images you shoot in the JPEG file format. 

201
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
Sharpening, in case you’re new to the digital meaning of the term, refers to a 
software process that adjusts contrast in a way that creates the illusion of 
slightly sharper focus. I emphasize, “slightly sharper focus.” Sharpening pro-
duces a subtle tweak, and it’s not a fix for poor focus.
You can select a Picture Control from the Shooting menu, as shown in 
Figure 6-30, or through the Shooting Information display. To go the second 
route, press the Info button twice: once to bring up the display and once to 
activate the Quick Settings strip at the bottom of the screen. Use the Multi 
Selector to scroll over to the Picture Control option, as shown in Figure 6-31. 
Press OK to get to the same menu options you see on the right in Figure 6-30.
Either way, you can choose from six Picture Controls, which produce the 
following results:
 
✓ Standard: The default setting for the P, S, A, and M exposure modes, this 
option captures the image normally — that is, using the characteristics 
that Nikon offers up as suitable for the majority of subjects. You also are 
assigned this mode if you shoot in the Auto, No Flash, Sports, and Close 
Up exposure modes.
 
✓ Neutral: At this setting, the camera doesn’t enhance color, contrast, and 
sharpening as much as in the other modes. The setting is designed for 
people who want to precisely manipulate these picture characteristics 
in a photo editor. By not overworking colors, sharpening, and so on 
when producing your original file, the camera delivers an original that 
gives you more latitude in the digital darkroom.
 
✓ Vivid: In this mode, the camera 
amps up color saturation, con-
trast, and sharpening. 
 
✓ Monochrome: This setting pro-
duces black-and-white photos. 
Only in the digital world, they’re 
called grayscale images because 
a true black-and-white image con-
tains only black and white, with 
no shades of gray.
 
 I’m not keen on creating gray-
scale images this way. I prefer to 
shoot in full color and then do my 
own grayscale conversion in my 
photo editor. That technique just 
gives you more control over the 
look of your black-and-white 
photos. Assuming that you work with a decent photo editor, you can 
control what original tones are emphasized in your grayscale version, 
Figure 6-31: You can access the Picture 
Control options through the Quick Settings 
display, too.

202
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
for example. Additionally, keep in mind that you can always convert a 
color image to grayscale, but you can’t go the other direction. You can 
create a black-and-white copy of your color image right in the camera, in 
fact; Chapter 10 shows you how.
 
✓ Portrait: This mode tweaks colors and sharpening in a way that is 
designed to produce nice skin texture and pleasing skin tones. (If you 
shoot in the Portrait or Night Portrait automatic exposure modes, the 
camera selects this Picture Control for you.)
 
✓ Landscape: This mode emphasizes blues and greens. As you might 
expect, it’s the mode used by the Landscape Digital Vari-Program mode.
The extent to which Picture Controls affect your image depends on the sub-
ject as well as the exposure settings you choose and the lighting conditions. 
But Figure 6-32 gives you a general idea of what to expect. As you can see, the 
differences between the various Picture Controls are pretty subtle, with the 
exception of the Monochrome option, of course.
Personally, I think that the Standard Picture Control is just ducky, and I rarely 
use the others. And frankly, I suggest that you do the same. First off, you’ve 
got way more important camera settings to worry about — aperture, shut-
ter speed, autofocus, and all the rest. Why add one more setting to your list, 
especially when the impact of changing it is minimal?
Second, if you really want to mess with the characteristics that the Picture 
Control options affect, you’re much better off shooting in the Raw (NEF) 
format and then making those adjustments on a picture-by-picture basis in 
your Raw converter. In Nikon ViewNX, you can even assign any of the existing 
Picture Controls to your Raw files and then compare how each one affects 
the image. The camera does tag your Raw file with whatever Picture Control 
is active at the time you take the shot, but the image adjustments are in no 
way set in stone, or even in sand — you can tweak your photo at will. (The 
selected Picture Control does affect the JPEG preview that’s used to display 
the Raw image thumbnails in ViewNX and other browsers.) 
For these reasons, I’m opting in this book to present you with just this brief 
introduction to Picture Controls so that I can go into more detail about func-
tions that I see as more useful (such as the white balance customization 
options presented earlier). But if you’re intrigued, know that you also can 
create your very own, customized Picture Controls. The camera manual 
walks you step by step through the process.

In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing the best all-around picture-taking settings
▶ Adjusting the camera for portrait photography
▶ Discovering the keys to super action shots
▶ Dialing in the right settings to capture landscapes and other scenic vistas
▶ Capturing close-up views of your subject
▶ Shooting through glass, capturing fireworks, and conquering other special challenges
E
arlier chapters of this book break down each and every picture-taking 
feature on your D90, describing in detail how the various controls affect 
exposure, picture quality, focus, color, and the like. This chapter pulls all that 
information together to help you set up your camera for specific 
types of photography.
The first section offers a quick summary of critical 
picture-taking settings that should serve you well no 
matter what your subject. Following that, I offer my 
advice on which settings to use for portraits, action 
shots, landscapes, and close-ups. To wrap things 
up, the end of the chapter includes some miscel-
laneous tips for dealing with special shooting situa-
tions and subjects.
Keep in mind that although I present specific recom-
mendations here, there are no hard and fast rules as 
to the “right way” to shoot a portrait, a landscape, or 
whatever. So don’t be afraid to wander off on your own, 
tweaking this exposure setting or adjusting that focus con-
trol, to discover your own creative vision. Experimentation is 
part of the fun of photography, after all — and thanks to your camera 
monitor and the Delete button, it’s an easy, completely free proposition.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Recapping Basic Picture Settings
Your subject, creative goals, and lighting conditions determine which set-
tings you should use for some picture-taking options, such as aperture and 
shutter speed. I offer my take on those options throughout this chapter. But 
for many basic options, I recommend the same settings for almost every 
shooting scenario. Table 7-1 shows you those recommendations and also 
lists the chapter where you can find details about each setting.

Setting Up for Specific Scenes
For the most part, the settings detailed in the preceding section fall into the 
“set ’em and forget ’em” category. That leaves you free to concentrate on a 
handful of other camera options, such as aperture and shutter speed, that 
you can manipulate to achieve a specific photographic goal.
The next four sections explain which of these additional options typically pro-
duce the best results when you’re shooting portraits, action shots, landscapes, 
and close-ups. I offer a few compositional and creative tips along the way — 
but again, remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and for every so-
called rule, there are plenty of great images that prove the exception.
Shooting still portraits
By still portrait, I mean that your subject isn’t moving. For subjects who aren’t 
keen on sitting still long enough to have their picture taken — children, pets, 

207
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
and even some teenagers I know — skip ahead to the next section and use 
the techniques given for action photography instead.
Assuming that you do have a subject willing to pose, the classic portraiture 
approach is to keep the subject sharply focused while throwing the background 
into soft focus. This artistic choice emphasizes the subject and helps diminish 
the impact of any distracting background objects in cases where you can’t con-
trol the setting. The following steps show you how to achieve this look: 
 
1. Set the Mode dial to A (aperture-priority autoexposure) and select the 
lowest f-stop value possible.
 
 As Chapter 5 explains, a low f-stop setting opens the aperture, which not 
only allows more light to enter the camera but also shortens depth of 
field, or the range of sharp focus. So dialing in a low f-stop value is the 
first step in softening your portrait background. (The f-stop range avail-
able to you depends on your lens.) Also keep in mind that the farther 
your subject is from the background, the more blurring you can achieve.
 
 I recommend aperture-priority mode when depth of field is a primary 
concern because you can control the f-stop while relying on the camera to 
select the shutter speed that will properly expose the image. Just rotate 
the subcommand dial to select your desired f-stop. (You do need to pay 
attention to shutter speed also, however, to make sure that it’s not so 
slow that any movement of the subject or camera will blur the image.)
 
 If you aren’t comfortable with this advanced exposure mode, Portrait 
mode also results in a more open aperture, although the exact f-stop 
setting is out of your control. Chapter 2 details this mode.
 
 Whichever mode you choose, you can monitor the current f-stop and 
shutter speed in the Control panel, viewfinder, and Shooting Information 
display, as shown in Figure 7-1. 
 
2. To further soften the background, zoom in, get closer, or both. 
 
 As covered in Chapter 6, zooming in to a longer focal length also reduces 
depth of field, as does moving physically closer to your subject.
 
 Avoid using a lens with a short focal length (a wide-angle lens) for por-
traits. They can cause features to appear distorted — sort of like how 
people look when you view them through a security peephole in a door.
 
3. For indoor portraits, shoot flash-free if possible.
 
 Shooting by available light rather than flash produces softer illumina-
tion and avoids the problem of red-eye. To get enough light to go flash-
free, turn on room lights or, during daylight, pose your subject next to a 
sunny window, as I did for the image in Figure 7-2.
 
 In the A exposure mode, simply keeping the built-in flash unit closed dis-
ables the flash. In Portrait mode, the camera automatically pops up the 

208
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
flash unit in dim lighting. To disable the flash, hold the Flash button down 
as you rotate the main command dial to select the Off setting.
 
 If flash is unavoidable, see my list of flash tips at the end of the steps to 
get better results.
 
Shutter speed
Aperture
 
Figure 7-1: You can monitor aperture and shutter speed settings in three places. 
 
4. For outdoor portraits, use a flash if possible.
 
 Even in daylight, a flash adds a 
beneficial pop of light to sub-
jects’ faces, as illustrated in 
Figure 7-3.
 
 In the A exposure mode, you can 
just press the Flash button on 
the side of the camera to enable 
the flash. For daytime portraits, 
use the fill flash setting. (That’s 
the regular, basic flash mode.) 
For nighttime images, try red-eye 
reduction or slow-sync mode; 
again, see the flash tips at the 
end of these steps to use either 
mode most effectively.
 
 Unfortunately, Portrait mode 
uses Auto flash, and if the 
ambient light is very bright, the 
flash may not fire. Switch to an 
advanced exposure mode (P, S, 
A, or M) to regain flash control. 
But do note that whatever 
exposure mode you use, the top 
Figure 7-2: For more pleasing indoor portraits, 
shoot by available light instead of using flash.

209
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
shutter speed available when you use the built-in flash is 1/200 second, 
so in extremely bright light, you may need to stop down the aperture to 
avoid overexposing the photo. Doing so, of course, brings the background 
into sharper focus. So try to move the subject into a shaded area instead.
 
No flash
Fill flash
 
Figure 7-3: To properly illuminate the face in outdoor portraits, use fill flash.
 
5. Press and hold the shutter button halfway to initiate exposure meter-
ing and autofocusing. 
 
 Make sure that an active autofocus point falls over your subject. 
Chapter 6 explains more about autofocus, but if you have trouble, 
simply set your lens to manual focus mode and then twist the focusing 
ring to set focus. See Chapter 1 for help with manual focusing.
 
6. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to capture the image.
Again, these steps just give you a starting point for taking better portraits. A 
few other tips can also improve your people pics: 
 
✓ Pay attention to the background. Scan the entire frame looking for 
intrusive objects that may distract the eye from the subject. If neces-
sary, reposition the subject against a more flattering backdrop. Inside, a 
softly textured wall works well; outdoors, trees and shrubs can provide 
nice backdrops as long as they aren’t so ornate or colorful that they 
diminish the subject (for example, a magnolia tree laden with blooms).

210
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Pay attention to white balance if your subject is lit by both flash and 
ambient light. If you set the white balance setting to Auto, as I recom-
mend in Table 7-1, enabling flash tells the camera to warm colors to 
compensate for the cool light of a flash. If your subject is also lit by room 
lights or sunlight, the result may be colors that are slightly warmer than 
neutral. This warming effect typically looks nice in portraits, giving the 
skin a subtle glow. But if you aren’t happy with the result or want even 
more warming, see Chapter 6 to find out how to fine-tune white balance. 
Again, you can make this adjustment only in P, S, A, or M exposure modes.
 
✓ When flash is unavoidable, try these tricks to produce better results. 
The following techniques can help solve flash-related issues:
 
• Indoors, turn on as many room lights as possible. With more ambi-
ent light, you reduce the flash power that’s needed to expose the 
picture. This step also causes the pupils to constrict, further reduc-
ing the chances of red-eye. (Pay heed to my white balance warning, 
however.) As an added benefit, the smaller pupil allows more of the 
subject’s iris to be visible in the portrait, so you see more eye color.
 
• Try setting the flash to red-eye reduction or slow-sync mode. If you 
choose the first option, warn your subject to expect both a prelimi-
nary pop of light from the AF-assist lamp, which constricts pupils, 
and the actual flash. And remember that Slow-Sync flash uses a 
slower-than-normal shutter speed, which produces softer lighting 
and brighter backgrounds than normal flash. (Chapter 5 has an 
example.) This mode is available in P and A exposure modes and is 
also the default setting in Night Portrait mode.
 
 Remember that the slow shutter speed of slow-sync mode means 
that you should use a tripod and ask your subject to stay very still 
to avoid blurring.
 
• For professional results, use an external flash with a rotating flash 
head. Then aim the flash head upward so that the flash light 
bounces off the ceiling and falls softly down onto the subject. An 
external flash isn’t cheap, but the results make the purchase worth-
while if you shoot lots of portraits. Compare the two portraits in 
Figure 7-4 for an illustration. In the first example, the built-in flash 
resulted in strong shadowing behind the subject and harsh, con-
centrated light. To produce the better result on the right, I used the 
Nikon Speedlight SB-600 and bounced the light off the ceiling. 
 
• To reduce shadowing from the flash, move your subject farther from the 
background. I took this extra step for the right image in Figure 7-4. The 
increased distance not only reduced shadowing but also softened 
the focus of the wall a bit (because of the short depth of field resulting 
from my f-stop and focal length).

211
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 A good general rule is to position your subjects far enough from 
the background that they can’t touch it. If that isn’t possible, 
though, try going the other direction: If the person’s head is smack 
up against the background, any shadow will be smaller and less 
noticeable. For example, you get less shadowing when a subject’s 
head is resting against a sofa cushion than if that person is sitting 
upright, with the head a foot or so away from the cushion.
 
✓ Frame the subject loosely to allow for later cropping to a variety of 
frame sizes. Your D90 produces images that have an aspect ratio of 3:2. 
That means that your portrait perfectly fits a 4-x-6-inch print size but will 
require cropping to print at any other proportions, such as 5 x 7 or 8 x 10. 
Chapter 9 talks more about this issue.
 
 
 Figure 7-4: To eliminate harsh lighting and strong shadows (left), I used bounce flash 
and moved the subject farther from the background (right).
Capturing action
A fast shutter speed is the key to capturing a blur-free shot of any moving 
subject, whether it’s your tennis-playing teen, a spinning Ferris wheel, or, as 
in the case of Figure 7-5, a butterfly dancing from flower to flower. In the left 
image, a shutter speed of 1/125 second was too slow, resulting in some slight 
blurring of the butterfly. For the right image, I bumped the shutter speed up 
to 1/320 second, which “froze” the butterfly.

212
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
1/125 second
1/320 second
Figure 7-5: Raising the shutter speed produced the blur-free image on the right.
Along with the basic capture settings outlined in Table 7-1, try the techniques 
in the following steps to photograph a subject in motion:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to S (shutter-priority autoexposure).
 
 In this mode, you control the shutter speed, and the camera takes care 
of choosing an aperture setting that will produce a good exposure. 
 
 If you aren’t ready to step up to this advanced exposure mode, 
explained in Chapter 5, try using Sports mode, detailed in Chapter 2. But 
be aware that you have no control over many other aspects of your pic-
ture (such as white balance, flash, and so on) in that mode.
 
2. Rotate the main command dial to select the shutter speed.
 
 (Refer to Figure 7-1 to locate shutter speed in the Control panel, view-
finder, and Shooting Information display.) After you select the shutter 
speed, the camera selects an aperture (f-stop) to match.
 
 What shutter speed do you need exactly? Well, it depends on the speed 
at which your subject is moving, so some experimentation is needed. 
But generally speaking, 1/500 second should be plenty for all but the 
fastest subjects (race cars, boats, and so on). For very slow subjects, 
you can even go as low as 1/250 or 1/125 second. 
 
3. Raise the ISO setting or add flash to produce a brighter exposure, if 
needed.
 
 In dim lighting, you may not be able to get a good exposure without 
taking this step; the camera simply may not be able to open the aper-
ture wide enough to accommodate a fast shutter speed. Raising the ISO 
does increase the possibility of noise, but a noisy shot is better than a 
blurry shot. 

213
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 Adding flash is a bit tricky for action shots, unfortunately. First, the flash 
needs time to recycle between shots, so try to go without if you want to 
capture images at a fast pace. Second, the built-in flash has limited range — 
so don’t waste your time if your subject isn’t close by. And third, remember 
that the fastest shutter speed you can use with the built-in flash is 1/200 
second, which may not be high enough to capture a quickly moving subject 
without blur. If you want additional shutter-speed flexibility, you need to 
use an external flash head that supports the Nikon Creative Lighting System 
options. (See Chapter 5 for details.)
 
 If you do decide to use flash, you must bail out of Sports mode; it 
doesn’t permit you to use flash.
 
4. For rapid-fire shooting, set the Release mode to one of the Continuous 
settings.
 
 In both modes — Continuous High and Continuous Low — you can cap-
ture multiple images with a single press of the shutter button. As long as 
you hold down the button, the camera continues to record images. The 
exact number of frames per second depends on settings you can read 
about at the end of Chapter 2.
 
5. For fastest shooting, switch to manual focusing.
 
 Manual focusing eliminates the time the camera needs to lock focus in auto-
focus mode. Chapter 1 shows you how to focus manually, if you need help.
 
 If you do use autofocus, try these two autofocus settings for best 
performance:
 
• Set the AF-area mode to Dynamic Area. 
 
• Set the Autofocus mode to AF-C (continuous-servo autofocus).
 
 Chapter 6 details these autofocus options.
 
6. Turn off Image Review and Active D-Lighting to speed up the camera 
even more.
 
 You turn off Image Review via the Playback menu. Turning the option 
off can help speed up the time your camera needs to recover between 
shots. Active D-Lighting, introduced in Chapter 5, also increases the time 
the camera needs to record the image; you can turn off this feature via 
the Shooting menu or through the Quick Settings display. (To get to the 
Quick Settings display, press the Info button twice.)
 
7. Compose the subject to allow for movement across the frame.
 
 In my example images, for instance, I zoomed out to a wide view so that 
my subject wouldn’t fly out of the frame.
 
Using these techniques should give you a better chance of capturing any fast-
moving subject. But action-shooting strategies also are helpful for shooting 
candid portraits of kids and pets. Even if they aren’t currently running, leaping, 

214
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
or otherwise cavorting, snapping a shot before they do move or change posi-
tions is often tough. So if an interaction or scene catches your eye, set your 
camera into action mode and then just fire off a series of shots as fast as you can.
For example, one recent afternoon, I spotted my furball and his equally fluffy 
new neighbor introducing themselves to each other through the fence that 
separates their yards. I ran and grabbed my camera, flipped it into shutter-
priority mode, and just started shooting. Most of the images were throw-
aways; you can see some of them in Figure 7-6. But somewhere around the 
tenth frame, I captured the moment you see in Figure 7-7, which puts a whole 
new twist on the phrase “gossiping over the backyard fence.” Two seconds 
later, the dogs got bored with each other and scampered away into their 
respective yards, but thanks to a fast shutter, I got the shot that I wanted.
Capturing scenic vistas
Providing specific capture settings for landscape photography is tricky 
because there’s no single best approach to capturing a beautiful stretch of 
countryside, a city skyline, or other vast subject. Take depth of field, for 
example: One person’s idea of a super cityscape might be to keep all build-
ings in the scene sharply focused. But another photographer might prefer to 
shoot the same scene so that a foreground building is sharply focused while 
the others are less so, thus drawing the eye to that first building.
 
 
Figure 7-6: I used speed-shooting techniques to capture this interaction between a pair of pups.

215
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 
Figure 7-7: Although most of the shots were deletable, this one was a keeper.
That said, I can offer a few tips to help 
you photograph a landscape the way you 
see it:
 
✓ Shoot in aperture-priority autoex-
posure mode (A) so that you can 
control depth of field. If you want 
extreme depth of field, so that both 
near and distant objects are sharply 
focused, as in Figure 7-8, select a 
high f-stop value. For short depth of 
field, use a low value.
 
 You can also use Landscape mode 
to achieve the first objective. In this 
mode, the camera automatically 
selects a high f-stop number, but 
you have no control over the exact 
value (or certain other picture-
taking settings). And in dim lighting, 
the camera may be forced to select 
a low f-stop setting.
 
✓ If the exposure requires a slow 
shutter, use a tripod to avoid blur-
ring. The downside to a high f-stop 
Figure 7-8: Use a high f-stop value (or 
Landscape mode) to keep foreground and 
background sharply focused.

216
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
is that you need a slower shutter 
speed to produce a good expo-
sure. If the shutter speed drops 
below what you can comfortably 
hand-hold — for me, that’s about 
1/50 second — use a tripod to 
avoid picture-blurring camera 
shake. 
 
 No tripod handy? Look for any 
solid surface on which you can 
steady the camera. Of course, 
you can always increase the 
ISO Sensitivity setting to allow 
a faster shutter, too, but that 
option brings with it the chances 
of increased image noise. See 
Chapter 5 for details.
 
✓ For dramatic waterfall shots, 
consider using a slow shutter 
to create that “misty” look. The 
slow shutter blurs the water, 
giving it a soft, romantic appear-
ance. Figure 7-9 shows you a 
close-up of this effect. Again, use 
a tripod to ensure that the rest of 
the scene doesn’t also blur due to 
camera shake.
 
 In very bright light, you may overexpose the image at a very slow shut-
ter, even if you stop the aperture all the way down and select the cam-
era’s lowest ISO setting. As a solution, consider investing in a neutral 
density filter for your lens. This type of filter works something like sun-
glasses for your camera: It simply reduces the amount of light that 
passes through the lens so that you can use a slower shutter than would 
otherwise be possible.
 
✓ At sunrise or sunset, base exposure on the sky. The foreground will 
be dark, but you can usually brighten it in a photo editor if needed. If 
you base exposure on the foreground, on the other hand, the sky will 
become so bright that all the color will be washed out — a problem 
you usually can’t fix after the fact.
 
 Also experiment with different levels of Active D-Lighting adjustment. 
Chapter 5 explains this feature, which brightens dark areas but doesn’t 
alter highlights, leaving your sky colors intact. You can adjust the set-
ting only in the P, S, A, and M exposure modes, however. 
 
✓ For cool nighttime city pics, experiment with slow shutter. Assuming 
that cars or other vehicles are moving through the scene, the result is 
neon trails of light like those you see in the foreground of the image in 
Figure 7-9: For misty waterfalls, use a slow 
shutter speed (and tripod).

217
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
Figure 7-10, taken by my friend 
Jonathan Conrad. Shutter speed 
for this image was 5 seconds.
 
 Instead of changing the shutter 
speed manually between each 
shot, try bulb mode. Available 
only in M (manual) exposure 
mode, this option records an 
image for as long as you hold 
down the shutter button. So just 
take a series of images, holding 
the button down for different 
lengths of time for each shot. In 
bulb mode, you also can exceed 
the standard maximum shutter 
speed of 30 seconds.
 
✓ For the best lighting, shoot 
during the “magic hours.” That’s 
the term photographers use for 
early morning and late afternoon, 
when the light cast by the sun is 
soft and warm, giving everything 
that beautiful, gently warmed look.
 
 Can’t wait for the perfect light? 
Tweak your camera’s white bal-
ance setting, using the instruc-
tions laid out in Chapter 6, to simulate magic-hour light.
 
✓ In tricky light, bracket exposures. Bracketing simply means to take the 
same picture at several different exposures to increase the odds that at 
least one of them will capture the scene the way you envision. Bracketing 
is especially a good idea in difficult lighting situations such as sunrise and 
sunset.
 
 In P, S, A, and M modes, you can take advantage of automatic bracketing. 
See the end of Chapter 5 for details. 
 
 Unfortunately, you really can’t bracket exposures in the fully automatic 
exposure modes because you have no way to adjust exposure in those 
modes. 
Capturing dynamic close-ups
For great close-up shots, try these techniques:
 
✓ Check your owner’s manual to find out the minimum close-focusing 
distance of your lens. How “up close and personal” you can get to your 
subject depends on your lens, not the camera body itself. 
Jonathan Conrad
Figure 7-10: A slow shutter also creates neon 
light trails in city-street scenes.

218
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Take control over depth of 
field by setting the camera 
mode to A (aperture-priority 
autoexposure) mode. Whether 
you want a shallow, medium, or 
extreme depth of field depends 
on the point of your photo. In 
classic nature photography, for 
example, the artistic tradition 
is a very shallow depth of field, 
as shown in Figure 7-11, and 
requires an open aperture (low 
f-stop value). For this image, 
the f-stop was f/5.6. But if you 
want the viewer to be able to 
clearly see all details through-
out the frame — for example, if 
you’re shooting a product shot 
for your company’s sales cata-
log — you need to go the other 
direction, stopping down the 
aperture as far as possible.
 
 Not ready for the advanced 
exposure modes yet? Try Close 
Up mode instead. (It’s the one 
marked with the little flower on 
your Mode dial.) In this mode, 
the camera automatically opens the aperture to achieve a short depth of 
field and bases focus on the center of the frame. As with all the other auto-
matic exposure modes, though, the range of apertures available to the 
camera depends on the lighting conditions.
 
✓ Remember that zooming in and getting close to your subject both 
decrease depth of field. So back to that product shot: If you need depth 
of field beyond what you can achieve with the aperture setting, you may 
need to back away, zoom out, or both. (You can always crop your image 
to show just the parts of the subject that you want to feature.)
 
✓ When shooting flowers and other nature scenes outdoors, pay atten-
tion to shutter speed, too. Even a slight breeze may cause your subject 
to move, causing blurring at slow shutter speeds. 
 
✓ Use flash for better outdoor lighting. Just as with portraits, a tiny bit 
of flash typically improves close-ups when the sun is your primary light 
source. Again, though, keep in mind that the maximum shutter speed 
possible when you use the built-in flash is 1/200 second. So in very 
bright light, you may need to use a high f-stop setting to avoid overex-
posing the picture. If you shoot in an advanced exposure mode (P, S, A, 
or M), you can also adjust the flash output via the Flash Compensation 
control. Chapter 5 offers details.

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
✓ When shooting indoors, try not to use flash as your primary light 
source. Because you’ll be shooting at close range, the light from your 
flash may be too harsh even at a low Flash Compensation setting. If flash 
is inevitable, turn on as many room lights as possible to reduce the 
flash power that’s needed — even a hardware-store shop light can do in 
a pinch as a lighting source. (Remember that if you have multiple light 
sources, though, you may need to tweak the white balance setting.)
 
✓ To really get close to your subject, invest in a macro lens or a set of 
diopters. A true macro lens, 
which enables you to get really, 
really close to your subjects, 
is an expensive proposition; 
expect to pay around $200 or 
more. But if you enjoy capturing 
the tiny details in life, it’s worth 
the investment. 
 
 For a less expensive way to 
go, you can spend about $40 
for a set of diopters, which are 
sort of like reading glasses that 
you screw onto your existing 
lens. Diopters come in several 
strengths — +1, +2, + 4, and so 
on — with a higher number 
indicating a greater magnifying 
power. I took this approach to 
capture the extreme close-up 
in Figure 7-12, attaching a +2 
diopter to my lens. The downfall 
of diopters, sadly, is that they 
typically produce images that 
are very soft around the edges, 
as in Figure 7-13 — a problem 
that doesn’t occur with a good 
macro lens.
Coping with Special Situations
A few subjects and shooting situations pose some additional challenges not 
already covered in earlier sections. So to wrap up this chapter, here’s a quick 
list of ideas for tackling a variety of common “tough-shot” photos:
 
✓ Shooting through glass: To capture subjects that are behind glass, try 
putting your lens right flat against the glass. Then switch to manual 
focusing; the glass barrier can give the autofocus mechanism fits. Disable 
your flash to avoid creating any unwanted reflections, too. I used this 
Figure 7-12: To extend your lens’ close-focus 
ability, you can add magnifying diopters.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
technique at the zoo to capture the 
snake image you see in Figure 7-13.
 
✓ Shooting out a car window: Set the 
camera to shutter-priority autoexpo-
sure or manual mode and dial in a fast 
shutter speed to compensate for the 
movement of the car. Oh, and keep a 
tight grip on your camera. 
 
✓ Shooting fireworks: First off, use a 
tripod; fireworks require a long expo-
sure, and trying to handhold your 
camera simply isn’t going to work. 
If using a zoom lens, zoom out to 
the shortest focal length. Switch to 
manual focusing and set focus at infin-
ity (the farthest focus point possible 
on your lens). Set the exposure mode 
to manual, choose a relatively high 
f-stop setting — say, f/16 or so — and 
start a shutter speed of 1 to 3 sec-
onds. From there, it’s simply a matter 
of experimenting with different shut-
ter speeds.
  
 Be especially gentle when you press the shutter button — with a very 
slow shutter, you can easily create enough camera movement to blur 
the image. If you purchased the accessory remote control for your 
camera, this is a good situation in which to use it.
 
 You also may want to enable your camera’s Long Exposure Noise 
Reduction feature because a long exposure also increases the chances 
of noise defects. See Chapter 5 for details. (Keep the ISO Sensitivity set-
ting low to further dampen noise.)
 
✓ Shooting reflective surfaces: In outdoor shots taken in bright sun, 
you can reduce glare from reflective surfaces such as glass and metal 
by using a circular polarizing filter, which you can buy for about $40. A 
polarizing filter can also help out when you’re shooting through glass.
 
 But know that in order for the filter to work, the sun, your subject, and 
your camera lens must be precisely positioned. Your lens must be at 
a 90-degree angle from the sun, for example, and the light source must 
also be reflecting off the surface at a certain angle and direction. In 
addition, a polarizing filter also intensifies blue skies in some scenarios, 
which may or may not be to your liking. In other words, a polarizing 
filter isn’t a surefire cure-all.

221
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 A more reliable option for shooting small reflective objects is to invest 
in a light cube or light tent such as the ones shown in Figure 7-14, from 
Cloud Dome (www.clouddome.com) and Lastolite (www.lastolite.com), 
respectively. You place the reflective object inside the tent or cube 
and then position your lights around the outside. The cube or tent acts 
as a light diffuser, reducing reflections. Prices range from about $50 to 
$200, depending on size and features.

Working with 
Picture Files

In this part . . .
You’ve got a memory card full of pictures. 
Now what? Now you turn to the ﬁ rst chapter 
in this part, which explains how to get those pic-
tures out of your camera and onto your computer 
and, just as important, how to safeguard them 
from future digital destruction. After downloading 
your ﬁ les, head for Chapter 9, which offers step-
by-step guidance on printing your pictures, shar-
ing them online, and even viewing them on your 
television.

Downloading, Organizing, and 
Archiving Your Picture Files
In This Chapter
▶ Transferring pictures to your computer
▶ Using Nikon Transfer and ViewNX to download and organize photos
▶ Processing NEF (Raw) files
▶ Keeping your picture files safe from harm
F
or many novice digital photographers (and even some experienced 
ones), the task of moving pictures to the computer and then keeping 
track of all of those image files is one of the more confusing aspects of 
the art form. And frankly, writing about the download and orga-
nizing process isn’t all that easy, either. (I know, poor me!) 
The problem is that providing you with detailed instruc-
tions is pretty much impossible because the steps you 
need to take vary widely depending on what software 
you have installed on your computer and whether 
you use the Windows or Macintosh operating 
system.
To give you as much help as I can, however, this 
chapter shows you how to transfer and organize 
pictures using the free Nikon software that came 
in your camera box. After exploring these discus-
sions, you should be able to adapt the steps to any 
other photo program you may prefer. This chapter also 
covers a few other aspects of handling your picture files, 
including converting pictures taken in the NEF (Raw) format 
to a standard image format.

226
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
One note before you dig in: Most figures in this chapter and elsewhere fea-
ture the Windows Vista operating system. If you use some other version of 
Windows or own a Mac, what you see on your screen may look slightly 
different but should contain the same basic options unless I specify 
otherwise.
Sending Pictures to the Computer
You can take two approaches to moving pictures from your camera memory 
card to your computer:
 
✓ Connect the camera directly to 
the computer. For this option, you 
need to dig out the USB cable that 
came in your camera box. Your 
computer must also have a free 
USB slot, or port, in techie talk. If 
you’re not sure what these gad-
gets look like, Figure 8-1 gives you 
a look. The little three-pronged 
icon, labeled in Figure 8-1, is the 
universal symbol for USB. 
 
✓ Transfer images using a memory 
card reader. Many computers 
now also have slots that accept 
common types of memory cards. 
If so, you can simply pop the 
card out of your camera and into 
the card slot instead of hooking 
the camera up to the computer.
 
 As another option, you can buy 
stand-alone card readers such 
as the SanDisk model shown in 
Figure 8-2. This particular model 
accepts a variety of memory 
cards, including the SD card 
used by your D90. Check your 
printer, too; many printers now 
have card slots that serve the 
purpose of a card reader.

227
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
I prefer to use a card reader because when you transfer via the camera, 
the camera must be turned on during the process, wasting battery power. 
If you want to transfer directly from the camera, however, the next section 
explains some important steps you need to take to make that option work. 
For help using a card reader, skip ahead to “Starting the transfer process” 
to get an overview of what happens after you insert the card into the 
reader.
Connecting the camera and computer
 
You need to follow a specific set of steps when connecting the camera to 
your computer. Otherwise, you can damage the camera or the memory 
card.
Also note that in order for your camera to communicate with the computer, 
Nikon suggests that your computer be running one of the following operating 
systems:
 
✓ Windows Vista 32-bit Home Basic, Home Premium, Business, Enterprise, 
or Ultimate edition
 
✓ Windows XP with Service Pack 3, Home or Professional edition
 
✓ Mac OS X 10.3.9, 10.4.11, or 10.5.3
If you use another OS (operating system, for the non-geeks in the crowd), 
check the support pages on the Nikon Web site (www.nikon.com) for the 
latest news about any updates to system compatibility. You can always 
simply transfer images with a card reader, too.
With that preamble out of the way, here are the steps to link your computer 
and camera:
 
1. Check the level of the camera battery.
 
 If the battery is low, charge it before continuing. Running out of battery 
power during the transfer process can cause problems, including lost 
picture data. Alternatively, if you purchased the optional AC adapter, 
use that to power the camera during picture transfers.
 
2. Turn on the computer and give it time to finish its normal startup 
routine.
 
3. Turn the camera off.

228
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
4. Insert the smaller of the two plugs on 
the USB cable into the USB port on the 
side of the camera.
 
 The slot is hidden under a little rubber 
door on the left side of the camera, as 
shown in Figure 8-3.
 
5. Plug the other end of the cable into 
the computer’s USB port.
 
 If possible, plug the cable into a port 
that’s built into the computer, as 
opposed to one that’s on your key-
board or part of an external USB hub. 
Those accessory-type connections 
can sometimes foul up the transfer 
process.
 
6. Turn the camera on.
 
 What happens now depends on 
whether you connected the camera 
to a Windows-based or Mac computer 
and what photo software you have 
installed on that system. The next 
section explains the possibilities and 
how to proceed with the image transfer 
process.
 
7. When the download is complete, turn off the camera and then discon-
nect it from the computer.
 
 I repeat: Turn off the camera before severing its ties with the computer. 
Otherwise, you can damage the camera.
Starting the transfer process
After you connect the camera to the computer (be sure to carefully follow 
the steps in the preceding section) or insert a memory card into your card 
reader, your next step depends, again, on the software installed on your com-
puter and the computer operating system.
Figure 8-3: The USB slot is hidden 
under the rubber door on the left side 
of the camera.

229
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
Here are the most common possibilities and how to move forward:
 
✓ On a Windows-based computer, 
a Windows message box similar 
to the one in Figure 8-4 appears. 
Again, the figure shows the dialog 
box as it appears on a computer 
running Windows Vista. Whatever 
its design, the dialog box suggests 
different programs that you can 
use to download your picture files. 
Which programs appear depend 
on what you have installed on 
your system; if you installed Nikon 
Transfer, for example, it should 
appear in the program list, as in 
the figure. In Windows Vista, just 
click the transfer program that 
you want to use. In other versions 
of Windows, the dialog box may 
sport an OK button; if so, click that 
button to proceed.
 
 If you want to use the same pro-
gram for all of your transfers, 
select the Always Do This for This Device check box, as shown in the 
figure. The next time you connect your camera or insert a memory card, 
Windows will automatically launch your program of choice instead of 
displaying the message box.
 
✓ An installed photo program automatically displays a photo-download 
wizard. For example, the Nikon Transfer downloader or a downloader 
associated with Adobe Photoshop Elements, Picasa, or some other 
photo software may leap to the forefront. On a Mac, the built-in iPhoto 
software may display its auto downloader. (Apple’s Web site, www.
apple.com, offers excellent video tutorials on using iPhoto, by the way.)
 
 Usually, the downloader that appears is associated with the software 
that you most recently installed. Each new program that you add to your 
system tries to wrestle control over your image downloads away from 
the previous program.
 
 If you don’t want a program’s auto downloader to launch whenever you 
insert a memory card or connect your camera, you should be able to 
turn that feature off. Check the software manual to find out how to dis-
able the auto launch.
Figure 8-4: Windows may display this initial 
boxful of transfer options.

230
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
✓ Nothing happens. Don’t panic; assuming that your card reader or 
camera is properly connected, all is probably well. Someone simply 
may have disabled all the automatic downloaders on your system. Just 
launch your photo software and then transfer your pictures using what-
ever command starts that process. (I show you how to do it with Nikon 
Transfer later in the chapter; for other programs, consult the software 
manual.)
 
 As another option, you can use Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder to 
drag and drop files from your memory card to your computer’s hard 
drive. Whether you connect the card through a card reader or attach 
the camera directly, the computer sees the card or camera as just 
another drive on the system. So the process of transferring files is 
exactly the same as when you move any other file from a CD, DVD, or 
other storage device onto your hard drive.
In the next sections, I provide details on using Nikon Transfer to download 
your files and Nikon ViewNX to view and organize your pictures. Remember, 
if you use some other software, the concepts are the same, but check your 
program manual to get the small details. In most programs, you also can find 
lots of information by simply clicking open the Help menu.
Safeguarding your digital photo files
To make sure that your digital photos enjoy a long, 
healthy life, follow these storage guidelines:
 ✓ Don’t rely on your computer’s hard drive 
for long-term, archival storage. Hard drives 
occasionally fail, wiping out all files in the 
process. This warning applies to both inter-
nal and external hard drives.
 ✓ Camera memory cards, flash memory 
keys, and other portable storage devices 
are similarly risky. All are easily damaged 
if dropped or otherwise mishandled. And 
being of diminutive stature, these portable 
storage options also are easily lost.
 ✓ The best way to store important files is to 
copy them to nonrewritable CDs. (The label 
should say CD-R, not CD-RW.) Look for qual-
ity, brand-name CDs that have a gold coat-
ing, which offer a higher level of security 
than other coatings.
 ✓ Recordable DVDs offer the advantage of hold-
ing lots more data than a CD. However, be 
aware that the DVDs you create on one com-
puter may not be playable on another because 
multiple recording formats and disc types exist: 
DVD minus, DVD plus, dual-layer DVD, and so 
on. If you do opt for DVD, look for the archival, 
gold-coated variety, just as for CDs.
 ✓ Online photo-sharing sites such as 
Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and the like 
aren’t designed to be long-term storage 
tanks for your images. Consider them only 
a backup to your backup, and read the site 
terms carefully so that you understand how 
long the site will hold onto your files if you 
stop buying prints and other products. Also 
investigate whether the terms of member-
ship give the site permission to use and dis-
tribute your photos without your say-so. In 
other words, the fine print is important.

231
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
Downloading and Organizing Photos 
with the Nikon Software
Remember unpacking your camera box when you first brought home your 
D90? Did you notice a CD-ROM called Nikon Software Suite? If you haven’t 
already done so, dig out that CD and pop it into your computer’s CD drive. 
Then install the following two programs:
 
✓ Nikon Transfer: This program assists you with the process of transfer-
ring pictures from your camera or memory card to the computer.
 
✓ Nikon ViewNX: After downloading your files, you can view and organize 
your picture files using this program. You also can print and e-mail your 
photos from ViewNX.
 
Note that this book features Nikon Transfer version 1.2 and Nikon ViewNX 
version 1.2, which were the most current at the time of publication. If you 
own an earlier version of these programs, visit the Nikon Web site to install 
the updates. (To find out what version you have installed, open the program. 
Then, in Windows, choose Help➪About. On a Mac, choose the About com-
mand from the Nikon Transfer or Nikon ViewNX menu.)
The next several sections give you the most basic of introductions to using 
Nikon Transfer and ViewNX. If you want more details, just look in the Help 
system built into the programs. (Click the Help menu to access the system.)
 
Before you move on, though, I want to clear up one common point of confu-
sion: You can use the Nikon software to download and organize your photos 
and still use any photo-editing software you prefer. And to do your editing, 
you don’t need to re-download photos — after you transfer photos to your 
computer, you can access them from any program, just as you can any file 
that you put on your system. In fact, you can set things up so that you can 
select a photo in ViewNX and then open that picture in your chosen photo 
editor with a click or two. You can find details in the ViewNX Help system 
(open the program and then choose Help➪ViewNX Help); look for the section 
called “Setting Up ViewNX.”
Downloading with Nikon Transfer
The following steps explain how to download new pictures to your computer 
using Nikon Transfer:
 
1. Attach your camera or insert a memory card into your card reader, as 
outlined in the first part of this chapter.
 
 Depending on what software you have installed on your system, you 
may see the initial Nikon Transfer window, as shown in Figure 8-5. 

232
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Or, in Windows, you may see a dialog box similar to the one shown in 
Figure 8-4. In that case, click the item that has the Nikon Transfer logo, 
as shown in Figure 8-4.
 
 If nothing happens, start Nikon Transfer by using the same process you 
use to launch any program on your computer. (If some other photo soft-
ware pops up, close it first.)
 
2. Display the Source tab to view thumbnails of your pictures, as shown 
in the figure.

Select All
Figure 8-5: Select the check boxes of the images that you want to download.

233
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
 Don’t see any tabs? Click the little Options triangle, located near the top-left 
corner of the window, to display them. Then click the Source tab. The icon 
representing your camera or memory card should be selected, as shown 
in the figure. If not, click the icon. The dialog box then displays thumbnails 
of your images. (If you don’t see the thumbnails, click the arrow labeled in 
Figure 8-5 to expand the dialog box and open the thumbnails area.)
 
3. Select the images that you want to download.
 
 A check mark in the little box under a thumbnail tells the program that 
you want to download the image. Click the box to toggle the check mark 
on and off.
 
 You also can select images quickly by using these tricks:
 
• Select all images. Click the little icon labeled Select All in Figure 8-5. 
 
• Select protected images. If you used the in-camera functions to pro-
tect pictures (see Chapter 4), you can select just those images by 
clicking the Select Protected icon, also labeled in Figure 8-5. 
 
• Deselect all images. Click the Select None icon, labeled in Figure 8-5.
 
4. Click the Primary Destination tab at the top of the window.
 
 When you click the tab, the top of the transfer window offers options 
that enable you to specify where and how you want the images to be 
stored on your computer. Figure 8-6 offers a close-up look. 
 
5. Choose the folder where you want to store the images from the 
Primary Destination Folder drop-down list.
 
 If the folder you want to use isn’t in the list, choose Browse from the 
bottom of the list and then track down the folder and select it.
 
 By default, the program puts images in a folder titled Nikon Transfer, 
which is housed inside a folder named My Pictures in Windows XP and 
Pictures in Windows Vista and on a Mac. That My Pictures or Pictures 
folder is housed inside a folder that your system creates automatically 
for each registered user of the computer.
 
 
Figure 8-6: Specify the folder where you want to put the downloaded images.

234
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 You don’t have to stick with this default location — you can put your 
pictures anywhere you please. But because most photo programs auto-
matically look for pictures in these standard folders, putting your pic-
tures there just simplifies things a little down the road. Note: You can 
always move your pictures into other folders after you download them if 
needed, too. The upcoming section “Organizing pictures” explains how 
to do so in Nikon ViewNX.
 
6. Specify whether you want the pictures to be placed inside a new 
subfolder.
 
 If you select the Create Subfolder for Each Transfer option, the program 
creates a new folder inside the storage folder you selected in Step 5. 
Then it puts all the pictures from the current download session into that 
new subfolder. You can either use the numerical subfolder name the 
program suggests or click the Edit button to set up your own naming 
system. If you created custom folders on the camera memory card, an 
option you can explore in Chapter 11, select the Copy Folder Names 
from Camera check box to use those folder names instead.
 
7. Tell the program whether you want to rename the picture files during 
the download process.
 
 If you do, select the Rename Photos During Transfer check box. Then 
click the Edit button to display a dialog box where you can set up your 
new filenaming scheme. Click OK after you do so to close the dialog box.
 
8. Click the Preferences tab to set the rest of the transfer options.
 
 Now the tab shown in Figure 8-7 takes over the top of the program 
window. Here you find a number of options that enable you to control 
how the program operates. Most of the options are self-explanatory, but 
a couple warrant a few words of advice:
 
• Launch automatically when device is attached. Deselect this check 
box if you don’t want Nikon Transfer to start every time you con-
nect your camera to your computer or insert a memory card into 
your card reader.
 
• Transfer new photos only. This option, when selected, ensures that 
you don’t waste time downloading images that you’ve already 
transferred but are still on the memory card.
 
• Delete original files after transfer. Turn this option off, as shown 
in Figure 8-7. Otherwise, your pictures are automatically erased 
from your memory card when the transfer is complete. You should 
always check to make sure the pictures really made it to the com-
puter before you delete them from your memory card. (See Chapter 
4 to find out how to use the Delete function on your camera.)
 
• Open destination folder with other application after transfer. By 
default, Nikon Transfer shuts itself down when the file download 
is complete, and Nikon ViewNX then starts automatically so that 

235
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
you can view and organize your images. (That’s assuming that you 
installed ViewNX, of course.) If you want to use a program other 
than ViewNX for that task, open the drop-down list, click Browse, 
and select the program from the dialog box that appears. Click OK 
after doing so. And if you don’t want Nikon Transfer to close after 
downloading, uncheck the Quit Nikon Transfer Automatically After 
Transfer option.
 
 
Figure 8-7: Control other aspects of the program’s behavior via the Preferences tab.
 
 Your choices remain in force for any subsequent download sessions, so 
you don’t have to revisit this tab unless you want the program to behave 
differently.
 
9. When you’re ready to start the download, click the Start Transfer 
button.
 
 It’s located in the lower-right corner of the program window. After you 
click the button, the Process bar in the lower-left corner indicates how 
the transfer is progressing. Again, what happens when the transfer com-
pletely depends on the choices you made in Step 8; by default, Nikon 
Transfer closes, and ViewNX opens, automatically displaying the folder 
that contains your just-downloaded images.
Browsing images in Nikon ViewNX
Nikon ViewNX is designed to do exactly what its name suggests: enable you 
to view and organize the pictures that you shoot with your D90. You also can 
view other photos — pictures you scanned, received from friends via e-mail, 
or took with a different camera, for example. The only requirement is that 
the file format is one that ViewNX can read; for still photos, that means JPEG, 
TIFF, or NEF, which is the Nikon flavor of Camera Raw. (Chapter 3 explains 
file formats.) The program also can play the AVI movie files that you create 
with your D90. For a complete rundown of supported file formats, check the 
Appendix section of the built-in program Help system.

236
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 8-8 offers a look at the ViewNX window as it appears by default in 
Windows Vista. The Mac version is nearly identical, although it features the 
usual Mac look and feel instead of the Microsoft Windows design.
 
On either type of system, you can customize a variety of aspects of the 
window layout by using the options on the View and Window menus.
To start viewing your pictures, first display the Folders panel along the left side 
of the program window, as shown in Figure 8-8. (Just click the tab, labeled in the 
figure.) Now open the folder that holds the photos you want to view. If you came 
to ViewNX directly after downloading pictures via Nikon Transfer, the folder that 
holds the new images should already be selected for you. Thumbnails of those 
images then appear on the right side of the program window. For a movie, you 
see a thumbnail representing the first shot in the recording.

By opening the View menu, you can choose from three different viewing 
options, which work as follows:
 
✓ Thumbnail Grid: This is the default layout, shown in Figure 8-8. You can 
adjust the size of the thumbnails by dragging the Zoom slider, labeled in 
the figure.

237
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
✓ Image Viewer: This option displays your files as shown in Figure 8-9. 
Small thumbnails appear along the top of the pane; the selected thumb-
nail appears in the larger preview area underneath. Use these maneu-
vers to inspect your images:
 
• To select an image or movie file, just click its thumbnail.
 
• Magnify or reduce the size of photo thumbnails and the preview by 
using the Zoom sliders labeled in Figure 8-10. For a movie file, the 
size of the preview automatically changes to fill the preview area 
as you adjust the thumbnail size.
 
• Drag in the large preview to scroll the display as needed to view 
hidden parts of a photo.
 
• To scroll through your files, click the little arrows under the large 
preview, labeled Previous and Next in the figure.

✓ Full Screen: Want to see a photo at full-screen size, as shown in Figure 
8-10? If you’re working in Thumbnail Grid view, just double-click the pic-
ture thumbnail. In Image Viewer view, first click the thumbnail to display 
it in the large preview. Then double-click the large preview. Or, in either 

238
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
view, click the thumbnail and then press the letter F. For movies, con-
trols for starting the movie playback appear under the preview. (Click the 
little triangle to begin playback; click the neighboring square to stop it.)
 
 In Full Screen view, as in the other views, you can magnify still photos 
by dragging the Zoom slider. To view additional photos at full-screen 
size, click the Previous and Next arrows under the image display. To

Viewing picture metadata
When you snap a still photo with your D90, the camera includes in the pic-
ture file some extra data that records all the critical camera settings that 
were in force. This data, known by nerds as metadata, also includes the cap-
ture date and time. And, if you take advantage of the Image Comment feature 
that I cover in Chapter 11, you can even store a brief bit of custom text, such 
as the shooting location or subject.

Reviewing this data is a great way to better understand what settings work 
best for different types of pictures, especially when you’re just getting up to 
speed with aperture, shutter speed, white balance, and all the other digital 
photography basics. To get the full story on how each setting affects your 
pictures, see Chapters 5 and 6.
To view the metadata in ViewNX, first select an image by clicking its thumb-
nail in the ViewNX browser window. Then click the Metadata tab on the left 
side of the window or choose Window➪Metadata. The metadata information 
then comes to the forefront, as shown in Figure 8-11.
The metadata is divided into several sections of related capture settings: File 
Info 1, File Info 2, Camera Info, Exposure, Flash, and so on. To hide or display 
a section, click the triangle next to it. You may need to use the scroll bar 
along the right side of the panel to view all the available information. Note 
that Nikon supplies ViewNX with cameras other than the D90, and some cat-
egories of data apply only to those other models.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
The XMP/IPTC Information part of the Metadata panel gives you access to the 
ViewNX keywords, tags, and rating functions. These functions, along with the 
program’s search feature, provide you with various tools that make locating 
specific pictures easier, including the option to search for pictures based on 
the shooting date.
 
In case you’re curious, IPTC refers to text data that press photographers are 
often required to tag onto their picture files, such as captions and copyright 
information. XMP refers to a data format developed by Adobe to enable 
that kind of data to be added to the file. IPTC stands for International Press 
Telecommunication Council; XMP stands for Extensible Metadata Platform.
Organizing pictures
When you download files from your camera using Nikon Transfer, you can 
specify where on your computer’s hard drive you want to store them. After 
you get the files on your system, you can further organize them in ViewNX. 
You can create new folders and subfolders, move images from one folder to 
another, rename and delete files, and more.
To begin organizing your files, first display the Folders panel by clicking its 
tab on the left side of the program window. In this panel, you can see and 
manage the contents of all the drives and folders on your computer. From 
here, you can set up and rearrange your storage closet as follows:
 
✓ Hide/display the contents of a drive or folder. See a little plus sign 
(Windows) or right-pointing triangle (Mac) next to a drive or folder? Click 
it to display the contents of that storage bin. A minus sign (Windows) or a 
down-pointing triangle (Mac) means that the drive or folder is open; click 
that minus sign or triangle to close the drive or folder.
 
✓ Create a new folder. First, click the drive or folder where you want to 
house the new folder. For example, if you want to create it inside your 
Pictures or My Pictures folder, click it. Icons representing all the folders and 
files currently found within that folder then appear in the thumbnail area.
 
 Next, choose File➪New Folder. An icon representing the new folder 
should then appear, with the name box activated, as shown in Figure 8-12. 
Type the folder name and press Enter.
 
 You can create as many new folders and subfolders as you like. I prefer 
to organize my images according to subject matter — for example, in 
Figure 8-12, I created a folder called Indianapolis and then created sev-
eral folders inside, each dedicated to different locations in the city. 
 
✓ Move a file from one folder to another. First, display that file’s thumb-
nail in the browser. Then drag the thumbnail to the destination folder in 
the Folder pane.

241

Figure 8-12: I prefer to sort my images into folders based on subject.
 
✓ Delete a file. In Windows, click the thumbnail and then choose 
Edit➪Delete or press the Delete key. On a Mac, choose Edit➪Move to 
Trash or press Ô+Delete. You then see a message asking you to confirm 
that you really want to trash the file. Click Yes to move forward.
 
✓ Protect or unlock photos. If you used the Protect feature on your 
camera’s Playback menu to “lock” a file, a process you can explore 
in Chapter 4, you need to remove the protection if you want to edit 
the image in your photo software. To do so, choose File➪Protect 
Files➪Unprotect.
 
 You also can protect files in ViewNX; just choose Protect from the 
File➪Protect Files submenu. A little key icon then appears on the thumb-
nail to remind you that the file is now protected from editing or erasing. 
If you later want to delete the file, you must first unprotect it.
 
✓ Select multiple files for moving, deleting, or other actions. Click the 
thumbnail of the first image and then Ctrl+click (Windows) or Ô+click 
(Mac) the rest. To select all images in the current folder, press Ctrl+A 
(Windows) or Ô+A (Mac.)

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Processing Raw (NEF) Files
Chapter 3 introduces you to the Camera Raw file format, which enables you 
to capture images as raw data. The advantage of capturing Raw files, which 
are called NEF files on Nikon cameras, is that you make the decisions about 
how to translate the raw data into an actual photograph. You can specify 
attributes such as color intensity, image sharpening, contrast, and so on — 
all of which are handled automatically by the camera if you use its other file 
format, JPEG. You take these steps by using a software tool known as a Raw 
converter.
 
The bad news: Until you convert your NEF files into a standard file format, 
you can’t share them online or print them from most programs other than 
Nikon ViewNX. You also can’t get prints from most retail outlets or open 
them in many photo-editing programs.
To process your D90 NEF files, you have a couple of options:
 
✓ Use the in-camera processing feature. Through the Retouch menu, you 
can process your Raw images right in the camera. You can specify only 
limited image attributes (color, sharpness, and so on), and you can save 
the processed files only in the JPEG format, but still, having this option 
is a nice feature. See the next section for details.
 
✓ Process and convert in ViewNX. ViewNX also offers a Raw processing 
feature. Again, the controls for setting picture characteristics are a little 
limited, but you can save the adjusted files in either the JPEG or TIFF 
format. The last section of this chapter walks you through this option.
Using your mouse as a shutter button
Nikon offers a piece of specialty software 
known as Nikon Camera Control Pro 2, which 
sells for about $180. With this program, you can 
use your computer to operate your camera.
While your camera is connected to your com-
puter, the software displays a window that 
contains clickable controls for adjusting all 
the standard camera settings, from aperture 
to white balance. When you get those options 
established, you click another button to record 
whatever scene is in front of your camera lens.
What’s the point? Well, Camera Control Pro is 
great in scenarios that make having a live pho-
tographer close to the subject either difficult or 
dangerous — for example, trying to get a shot 
of a chemical reaction in a science lab or cap-
ture an image of an animal that’s shy around 
humans. Additionally, the software enables 
easy time-lapse photography, enabling you to 
set the camera to take pictures automatically 
at specified intervals over a period of minutes, 
hours, or even days.

243
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
✓ Use Nikon Capture NX 2 or a third-party Raw conversion tool. For the 
most control over your Raw images, you need to open up your wallet and 
invest in a program that offers a truly capable converter. Nikon offers 
such a program, called Nikon Capture NX 2, which sells for about $180. 
Figure 8-13 gives you a look at the Capture NX 2 Raw converter window.
 
 Another (and less costly option) that I frequently recommend is Adobe 
Photoshop Elements, which sells for about $90 (www.adobe.com). It 
includes the Adobe Camera Raw converter, known in the industry as 
ACR, which is widely considered one of the best available. (Note: The 
converter in Elements doesn’t offer all the bells and whistles of the ver-
sion of ACR provided with Photoshop, however.) In addition, Elements 
is designed for the novice photo editing enthusiast, so it includes lots 
of helpful onscreen guides, whereas Capture NX 2 is geared more to the 
advanced digital photographer.
 
 
Figure 8-13: Nikon Capture NX 2 is one option for gaining more control over your Raw 
 
conversions.
If you do opt for a third-party conversion tool, check the program’s Help 
system for details on how to use the various controls, which vary from pro-
gram to program. The following general tips apply no matter what converter 
you use, however:
 
✓ Whenever possible, save your processed files in a nondestructive format 
such as TIFF. For top quality, don’t save originals in the JPEG format, 
which applies lossy compression. You can read about the potential 
damage to image quality that lossy compression creates in Chapter 3. 
If you need a JPEG image to share online, Chapter 9 shows you how to 
create a duplicate of your original, converted image in that format.

244
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
✓ Some Raw converters give you the option of creating a 16-bit image file. 
(A bit is a unit of computer data; the more bits you have, the more colors 
your image can contain.) Although you can create 16-bit TIFF files, many 
photo editing programs either can’t open them or limit you to a few edit-
ing tools, so I suggest you stick with the standard, 8-bit image option. 
Your image will contain more than enough colors, and you’ll avoid 
potential conflicts caused by so-called high-bit images.
 
✓ Resist the temptation to crank up color saturation too much. Doing so 
can actually destroy image detail. Likewise, be careful about overdoing 
sharpening, or you can create noticeable image defects. Chapter 6 offers 
some additional information about sharpening and saturation to help 
you find the right amounts of each.
Processing Raw images in the camera
Scroll past the initial screen of options on the Retouch menu, and you come 
to a menu item called NEF (Raw) Processing. With this feature, you can pro-
cess Raw files right in the camera — no computer or other software required.
I want to share two reservations about this option:
 
✓ First, you can save your processed files only in the JPEG format. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 3, that format results in some quality loss because 
of the file compression that JPEG applies. You can choose the level of 
JPEG compression you want to apply during Raw processing; you can 
create a JPEG Fine, Normal, or Basic file. Each of those settings produces 
the same quality that you get when you shoot new photos in the JPEG 
format and select Fine, Normal, or Basic from the Image Quality menu.
 
 Chapter 3 details the JPEG options, but, long story short, choose Fine 
for the best JPEG quality. And if you want to produce the absolute best 
quality from your Raw images, use a software solution and save your 
processed file in the TIFF format instead.
 
✓ You can make adjustments to exposure, color, and a few other options as 
part of the in-camera Raw conversion process. Evaluating the effects of 
your adjustments on the camera monitor can be difficult because of the 
size of the display, so for really tricky images, you may want to forgo in-
camera conversion and do the job on your computer, where you can get a 
better view of things. If you do go the in-camera route, make sure that the 
monitor brightness is set to its default position so that you aren’t misled 
by the display. (Chapter 1 shows you how to adjust monitor brightness.)
That said, in-camera Raw processing offers a quick and convenient solution 
when you need JPEG copies of your NEF images for immediate online sharing. 
(JPEG is the standard format for online use.) Follow these steps to get the
 job done:

245
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
1. Press the Playback button to 
switch to playback mode.
 
2. Display the picture you want to 
process in the single-image (full 
frame) view.
 
 If necessary, you can shift from 
thumbnails view to single-image 
view by just pressing the OK 
button. Chapter 4 has more play-
back details.
 
3. Press the OK button.
 
 The Retouch menu then appears 
atop your photo, as shown in 
Figure 8-14.
 
4. Use the Multi Selector to scroll to the NEF (RAW) Processing option, as 
shown in Figure 8-14.
 
 The option is on the second screen of the Retouch menu.
 
5. Press OK to display your processing options, as shown in Figure 8-15.
 
 This screen is command central for specifying what settings you want 
the camera to use when 
creating the JPEG version of your Raw image.
 
6. Set the conversion options.
 
 Along the right side of the screen, you see a vertical column offering five 
conversion options, which I labeled in Figure 8-15. To establish the set-
ting for an option, use the Multi Selector to highlight it and then press 
OK. You then see the available settings for the option. For example, if 
you highlight the first option, Image Quality, and press OK, you see the 
Figure 8-14: In single-image playback mode, 
press OK to display the Retouch menu over

 Rather than detailing all the 
options here, the following list 
points you to the chapter where 
you can explore the settings 
available for each:
 
• Image Quality: See the 
Chapter 3 section related to 
the JPEG quality settings for 
details on this option.
 
• Image Size: The first part of 
Chapter 3 explains this one.
 
• White Balance: Check out Chapter 6 for details about White 
Balance options.
 
• Exposure Compensation: With this option, you can adjust image 
brightness by applying exposure compensation, a feature that I 
cover in Chapter 5.
 
• Picture Control: This option enables you to adjust color, contrast, 
and image sharpness. For a review of the available settings, see the 
last part of Chapter 6.
 
7. When you finish setting all the conversion options, highlight EXE on 
the main conversion screen. (Refer to Figure 8-15.) Then press OK.
 
 The camera records a JPEG copy 
of your Raw file and displays the 
copy in the monitor. To remind 
you that the image was created 
with the help of the Retouch 
menu, the top-left corner of the 
display sports the little Retouch 
icon, and the filename of the 
image begins with CSC rather 
than the usual DSC, as shown 
in Figure 8-17. See Chapter 4 for 
details about filenaming conven-
tions used by the D90.

 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
Processing Raw files in ViewNX
In ViewNX, you can convert your Raw files to either the JPEG format or, for 
top picture quality, to the TIFF format. (See Chapter 3 if you’re unsure about 
the whole concept of file format and how it relates to picture quality.)
Although the ViewNX converter isn’t as full-featured as the ones in Nikon 
Capture NX 2, Adobe Photoshop Elements, and some other photo editing 
programs, it does enable you to make some adjustments to your Raw images. 
Follow these steps to try it out.
 
1. Click the thumbnail of the NEF (Raw) image to select it.
 
 You may want to set the program to Image Viewer mode, as shown in 
Figure 8-18, so that you can see a larger preview of your image. Just 
choose View➪Image Viewer to switch to this display mode.
 
2. Display the Quick Adjustment tab by clicking its tab on the left side of 
the program window.
 
 I labeled the tab in Figure 8-18. The tab provides access to a few con-
trols for fine-tuning your image. You can adjust exposure compensa-
tion, white balance, and assign a Picture Control, such as Landscape or 
Monochrome. Each time you adjust a setting, the preview updates to 
show you the results.
 
 A couple of options may require some explanation:
 
• Launch Utility button: This button, located under the Picture 
Control option, opens the Picture Control Utility, where you can 
define your own Picture Controls. I don’t get into this advanced 
function in this book, but if you’re curious, open the utility and 
then click the Help button at the bottom of the window.
 
• Highlight Protection/Shadow Protection/D-Lighting HS: Try using 
these options to recover hidden shadow and highlight detail.
 
• Color Booster: This slider (at the bottom of the panel, not vis-
ible in Figure 8-18) enables you to increase saturation. But if you 
select the People button under the slider, skin tones are left alone. 
Choose Nature to adjust the saturation of all colors in the photo.
 
 If you want more details about these or any other of the options, choose 
Help➪ViewNX Help to open the Help system, and then display the Help 
pages related to the Quick Adjustment tab.
 
3. Click the Apply button at the bottom of the Quick Adjustment area.

Figure 8-18: Display the Quick Adjustment panel to tweak Raw images before conversion.
 
4. To save the processed file, choose File➪Convert Files.
 
 Or just click the Convert Files button on the toolbar at the top of the 
program window. Either way, you see the Convert Files dialog box, 
shown in Figure 8-19.
 
5. Select TIFF (8 Bit) from the File Format drop-down list.
 
 You also can opt for TIFF (16 Bit) or JPEG, but I don’t recommend it. 
TIFF (16 Bit) can cause problems when you try to open the file in certain 
photo editing and organizing programs. And saving in the JPEG format 
applies lossy compression, thereby sacrificing some image quality. If you 
need a JPEG copy of your processed Raw image for online sharing, you 
can easily create one from your TIFF version by following the steps laid 
out in Chapter 9.

249
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
Figure 8-19: To retain the best image quality, save processed 
Raw files in the TIFF format.
 
6. Deselect the Use LZW Compression option, as shown in the figure.
 
 Although LZW Compression reduces the file size somewhat and does 
not cause any quality loss, some programs can’t open files that were 
saved with this option enabled. So turn it off.
 
7. Deselect the Change the Image Size check box.
 
 This step ensures that you retain all the original pixels in your image, 
which gives you the most flexibility in terms of generating quality prints 
at large sizes. For details on this issue, check out Chapter 3.
 
8. Deselect each of the three Remove check boxes.
 
 If you select the check boxes, you strip image metadata — the extra text 
data that’s stored by the camera — from the file. Unless you have some 
specific reason to do so, clear all three check boxes so that you can con-
tinue to access the metadata when you view your processed image in 
programs that know how to display metadata.

250
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 The first two check boxes relate to data that you can view on the 
Metadata tab in ViewNX; earlier sections of this chapter give you the low-
down. The ICC profile item refers to the image color space, which is either 
sRGB or Adobe RGB on your D90. Chapter 6 explains the difference.
 
9. Select a storage location for the processed TIFF file.
 
 In Windows, the current drive and folder location appears in the area 
highlighted in Figure 8-19. On a Mac, the location is displayed inside a 
white box in the same general area of the dialog box. On either type of 
system, you can change the storage destination by clicking the Browse 
button and then selecting the drive and folder where you want to put 
the file.
 
 By selecting the Create a New Subfolder for Each File Conversion check 
box, you can put your TIFF file into a separate folder within the destina-
tion folder. If you select the box, click the Naming Options button and 
then specify how you want to name the subfolder.
 
10. Specify whether you want to give the processed TIFF a different file-
name from the original Raw image.
 
 To do so, select the Change File Names check box and then click the 
Naming Options button and enter the name you want to use.
 
 If you don’t change the filename, ViewNX gives the file the same name as 
the original Raw file. But you don’t overwrite that Raw file because you 
are storing the copy in a different file format (TIFF). In Windows, the file-
name of the processed TIFF image has the three-letter extension TIF.
 
11. Click the Convert button.
 
 A window appears to show you the progress of the conversion process. 
When the window disappears, your TIFF image appears in the storage 
location you selected in Step 10.

▶ Viewing images on a TV
W
hen my first digital photography book was published, way back in the 
1990s, consumer digital cameras didn’t offer the resolution needed to 
produce good prints at anything more than postage-stamp size — and even 
then, the operative word was “good,” not “great.” And if you did want a print, 
it was a pretty much a do-it-yourself proposition unless you paid sky-
high prices at a professional imaging lab. In those days, retail 
photo labs didn’t offer digital printing, and online printing 
services hadn’t arrived yet, either.
Well, time and technology march on, and, at least in 
the case of digital photo printing, to a very good out-
come. Your D90 can produce dynamic prints even 
at large sizes, and getting those prints made is easy 
and economical, thanks to an abundance of digital 
printing services now in stores and online.
That said, getting the best output from your camera 
still requires a little bit of knowledge and prep work 
on your part. To that end, this chapter tells you 
exactly how to ensure that your picture files will look as 
good on paper as they do in your camera monitor.
In addition, this chapter explores ways to share your pictures 
electronically. First, I show you how to prepare your picture for e-mail — an 
important step if you don’t want to annoy friends and family by cluttering 
their inboxes with ginormous, too-large-to-view photos. Following that, you 
can find out how to create digital slide shows and view your pictures and 
Live View movies on a television.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Printing Possibilities: Retail or Do-It-Yourself?
Normally, I’m a do-it-yourself type of gal. I mow my own lawn, check my own 
tire pressure, hang my own screen doors. I am woman; hear me roar. Unless, 
that is, I discover that I can have someone else do the job in less time and for 
less money than I can — which just happens to be the case for digital photo 
printing. Although I occasionally make my own prints for fine-art images that 
I plan to sell or exhibit, I have everyday snapshots made at my local retail 
photo lab.
 
Unless you’re already very comfortable with computers and photo printing, I 
suggest that you do the same. Compare the cost of retail digital printing with 
the cost of using a home or office photo printer — remember to factor in the 
required ink, paper, and your precious time — and you’ll no doubt come out 
ahead if you delegate the job.
You can choose from a variety of retail printing options, as follows:
 
✓ Drop-off printing services: Just as you used to leave a roll of film at the 
photo lab in your corner drug store or camera store, you can drop off 
your memory card, order prints, and then pick up your prints in as little 
as an hour.
 
✓ Self-serve print kiosks: Many photo labs, big-box stores, and other retail 
outlets also offer self-serve print kiosks. You insert your memory card 
into the appropriate slot, follow the onscreen directions, and wait for 
your prints to slide out of the print chute.
 
✓ Online with mail-order delivery: You can upload your photo files to 
online printing sites and have prints mailed directly to your house. 
Photo-sharing sites such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Snapfish are 
well-known players in this market. But many national retail chains, such 
as Ritz Cameras, Wal-Mart, and others also offer this service.
 
✓ Online with local pickup: Here’s my favorite option. Many national 
chains enable you to upload your picture files for easy ordering but pick 
up your prints at a local store. This service is a great way to share prints 
with faraway friends and family, by the way. I can upload and order 
prints from my desk in Indianapolis, for example, and have them printed 
at a store located a few miles from my parents’ home in Texas.
 
For times when you do want to print your photos on your own printer, 
you can do so through Nikon ViewNX. However, I find the ViewNX printing 
options both more complex and more limited than those in other programs, 
which is why I opted not to cover them in this book. I suggest that you 
instead print from whatever photo editing program you use or from the soft-
ware provided by your printer manufacturer.

253
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Preventing Potential Printing Problems
Boy, I love a good alliteration, don’t you? Oh, just me, then. Anyway, as I say 
in the introduction to this chapter, a few issues can cause hiccups in the 
printing process. So before you print your photos, whether you want to do it 
on your own printer or send them to a lab, read through the next three sec-
tions, which show you how to avoid the most common trouble spots.
Match resolution to print size
Resolution, or the number of pixels in your digital image, plays a huge role in 
how large you can print your photos and still maintain good picture quality. 
You can get the complete story on resolution in Chapter 3, but here’s a quick 
recap as it relates to printing:
 
✓ On the D90, you set picture resolution via the Image Size option, which 
you can adjust either via the Shooting menu or by pressing the Qual 
button and rotating the main command dial. (Again, see Chapter 3 for 
specifics.) You must select this option before you capture an image, 
which means that you need some idea of your ultimate print size before 
you shoot. And if you crop your image, you eliminate some pixels, so 
take that factor into account when you do the resolution math. 
 
✓ For good print quality, the minimum pixel count (in my experience, 
anyway) is 200 pixels per linear inch, or 200 ppi. That means that if you 
want a 4-x-6-inch print, you need at least 800 x 1200 pixels.
 
✓ Depending on your printer, you may get even better results at 200+ ppi. 
Some printers do their best work when fed 300 ppi, and a few (notably, 
some from Epson) request 360 ppi as the optimum resolution. However, 
going higher than that typically doesn’t produce any better prints.
 
 Unfortunately, because most printer manuals don’t bother to tell you 
what image resolution produces the best results, finding the right reso-
lution is a matter of experimentation. (Don’t confuse the manual’s state-
ments related to the printer’s dpi with ppi. DPI refers to how many dots 
of color the printer can lay down per inch; many printers use multiple 
dots to reproduce one image pixel.)
 
✓ If you’re printing your photos at a retail kiosk or at an online site, the 
printing software that you use to order your prints should determine the 
resolution of your file and then guide you as to the suggested print size. 
But if you’re printing on a home printer, you need to be the resolution 
cop. (Some programs, however, do alert you in the Print dialog box if 
the resolution is dangerously low.)
So what do you do if you find that you don’t have enough pixels for the print 
size you have in mind? You just have to decide what’s more important, print 
size or print quality.

254
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
If your print size does exceed your pixel supply, one of two things must 
happen:
 
✓ The pixel count remains constant, and pixels simply grow in size 
to fill the requested print size. And if pixels get too large, you get a 
defect known as pixelation. The picture starts to appear jagged, or 
stairstepped, along curved or digital lines. Or at worst, your eye can 
actually make out the individual pixels, and your photo begins to look 
more like a mosaic than, well, a photograph.
 
✓ The pixel size remains constant, and the printer software adds pixels 
to fill in the gaps. You can also add pixels, or resample the image, in 
your photo software. Wherever it’s done, resampling doesn’t solve the 
low resolution problem. You’re asking the software to make up photo 
information out of thin air, and the result is usually an image that looks 
worse than it did before resampling. You don’t get pixelation, but details 
turn muddy, giving the image a blurry, poorly rendered appearance.
Just to hammer home the point and remind you one more time of the impact 
of resolution picture quality, Figures 9-1 through 9-3 show you the same 
image as it appears at 300 ppi (the resolution required by the publisher of 
this book), at 50 ppi, and resampled from 50 ppi to 300 ppi. As you can see, 
there’s just no way around the rule: If you want the best quality prints, you 
need the right pixel count.

Allow for different print proportions
Unlike many digital cameras, your D90 produces photos that have an aspect 
ratio of 3:2. That is, pictures are 3 units wide by 2 units tall — just like a 
35mm film negative — which means that they translate perfectly to the stan-
dard 4-x-6-inch print size. (Most digital cameras produce 4:3 images, which 
must be cropped to fit a 4-x-6-inch piece of paper.)
 
If you want to print your digital original at other standard sizes — 5 x 7, 8 x 10, 
11 x 14, and so on — you need to crop the photo to match those proportions. 
Alternatively, you can reduce the photo size slightly and leave an empty margin 
along the edges of the print as needed.
As a point of reference, Figure 9-4 shows you a 3:2 original image. The red 
outlines indicate how much of the original can fit within a 5-x-7-inch frame 
and an 8-x-10-inch frame.

8 x 10 frame area
 
Figure 9-4: Composing your shots with a little head room enables you to crop to different 
 
frame sizes.

257
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Your camera’s Trim feature, found on the Retouch menu, enables you to crop 
your photo, but only to proportions of 3:2, 4:3, and 5:4. See Chapter 10 for infor-
mation. For other proportions, most photo-editing programs offer very simple 
cropping tools. You also can usually crop your photo using the software pro-
vided at online printing sites and at retail print kiosks. But if you plan to drop 
off your memory card of original pictures at a lab, be aware that your pictures 
will be cropped if you select a print size other than 4 x 6.
DPOF, PictBridge, and computerless printing
Your D90 offers two technologies, called DPOF 
(dee-poff) and PictBridge, that enable you 
to print images directly from your camera or 
memory card, without using the computer as 
middle-machine. In order to take advantage of 
direct printing, your printer must also support 
one of the two technologies, and you must cap-
ture the images in the JPEG file format, which I 
explain in Chapter 3. (You can also capture the 
photo in the Raw format and then use your D90’s 
in-camera conversion tool to make a JPEG copy 
suitable for direct printing.)
DPOF stands for Digital Print Order Format. 
With this option, accessed via your camera’s 
Playback menu, you select the pictures on 
your memory card that you want to print, and 
you specify how many copies you want of 
each image. Then, if your photo printer has 
an SD Card slot and supports DPOF, you just 
pop the memory card into that slot. The printer 
reads your “print order” and outputs just the 
requested copies of your selected images. (You 
use the printer’s own controls to set paper size, 
print orientation, and other print settings.)
PictBridge works a little differently. If you have 
a PictBridge-enabled photo printer, you can 
connect the camera to the printer using the USB 
cable supplied with your camera. A PictBridge 
interface appears on the camera monitor, and 
you use the camera controls to select the pic-
tures you want to print. With PictBridge, you 
specify additional print options, such as page 
size and whether you want to print a border 
around the photo, from the camera as well.
Both DPOF and PictBridge are especially useful 
in scenarios where you need fast printing. For 
example, if you shoot pictures at a party and 
want to deliver prints to guests before they go 
home, DPOF offers a quicker option than firing up 
your computer, downloading pictures, and so on. 
And if you invest in one of the tiny portable photo 
printers on the market today, you can easily make 
prints away from your home or office — you can 
take both your portable printer and camera along 
to your regional sales meeting, for example. 
For the record, I prefer DPOF to PictBridge 
because with PictBridge, you have to deal with 
cabling the printer and camera together. Also, the 
camera must be turned on for the whole printing 
process, wasting battery power. But if you’re 
interested in exploring either printing feature, 
your camera manual provides complete details.

258
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
To allow yourself printing flexibility, leave at least a little margin of back-
ground around your subject when you shoot, as I did for the example in 
Figure 9-4. Then you don’t clip off the edges of the subject no matter what 
print size you choose. (Some people refer to this margin padding as head 
room, especially when describing portrait composition.)
Get print and monitor colors in synch
Your photo colors look perfect on your computer monitor. But when you 
print the picture, the image is too red, or too green, or has some other nasty 
color tint. This problem, which is probably the most prevalent printing issue, 
can occur because of any or all of the following factors:
 
✓ Your monitor needs to be calibrated. When print colors don’t match 
what you see on your computer monitor, the most likely culprit is actually 
the monitor, not the printer. If the monitor isn’t accurately calibrated, the 
colors it displays aren’t a true reflection of your image colors.
 
 To ensure that your monitor is displaying photos on a neutral canvas, you 
can start with a software-based calibration utility, which is just a small 
program that guides you through the process of adjusting your monitor. 
The program displays various color swatches and other graphics and 
then asks you to provide feedback about what you see on the screen.
 
 If you use a Mac, the operating system offers a built-in calibration util-
ity, called the Display Calibrator Assistant; Figure 9-5 shows the welcome 
screen that appears when you run the program. (Access it by opening 
the System Preferences dialog box, clicking the Displays icon, clicking the 
Color button, and then clicking the Calibrate button.) You also can find free 
calibration software for both Mac and Windows systems online; just enter 
the term free monitor calibration software into your favorite search engine.
 
 Software-based calibration isn’t ideal, however, because our eyes aren’t 
that reliable in judging color accuracy. For a more accurate calibration, 
you may want to invest in a device known as a colorimeter, which you 
attach to or hang on your monitor, to accurately measure and calibrate 
your display. Companies such as Datacolor (www.datacolor.com), 
Pantone (www.pantone.com), and X-Rite (www.xrite.com) sell this type 
of product along with other tools for ensuring better color matching.
 
 Whichever route you go, the calibration process produces a monitor 
profile, which is simply a data file that tells your computer how to adjust 
the display to compensate for any monitor color casts. Your Windows or 
Mac operating system loads this file automatically when you start your 
computer. Your only responsibility is to perform the calibration every 
month or so, because monitor colors drift over time.

259
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
 Figure 9-5: Mac users can take advantage of the operating system’s built-in 
calibration tool.
 
✓ One of your printer cartridges is empty or clogged. If your prints 
look great one day but are way off the next, the number-one suspect is 
an empty ink cartridge or a clogged print nozzle or head. Check your 
manual to find out how to perform the necessary maintenance to keep 
the nozzles or print heads in good shape.
 
 If black-and-white prints have a color tint, a logical assumption is that 
your black ink cartridge is to blame, if your printer has one. But the 
problem is usually a color cartridge instead. Most printers use both 
color and black inks even for black-and-white prints, and if one color is 
missing, a tint results.
 
 When you buy replacement ink, by the way, keep in mind that third-
party brands, while they may save you money, may not deliver the 
performance you get from the cartridges made by your printer manu-
facturer. A lot of science goes into getting ink formulas to mesh with the 
printer’s ink-delivery system, and the printer manufacturer obviously 
knows most about that delivery system.
 
✓ You chose the wrong paper setting in your printer software. When you 
set up your print job, be sure to select the right setting from the paper-
type option — glossy, matte, and so on. This setting affects how the 
printer lays down ink on the paper.

260
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
✓ Your photo paper is low quality. Sad but true: The cheap, store-brand 
photo papers usually don’t render colors as well as the higher-priced, 
name-brand papers. For best results, try papers from your printer manu-
facturer; again, those papers are engineered to provide top performance 
with the printer’s specific inks and ink-delivery system.
 
✓ Your printer and photo software are fighting over color-management 
duties. Some photo programs offer features that enable the user to con-
trol how colors are handled as an image passes from camera to monitor 
to printer. Most printer software also offers color-management features. 
The problem is, if you enable color-management controls both in your 
photo software and your printer software, you can create conflicts that 
lead to wacky colors. So check your photo software and printer manuals 
to find out what color-management options are available to you and how 
to turn them on and off.
 
Even if all the aforementioned issues are resolved, however, don’t expect per-
fect color matching between printer and monitor. Printers simply can’t repro-
duce the entire spectrum of colors that a monitor can display. In addition, 
monitor colors always appear brighter because they are, after all, generated 
with light.
Finally, be sure to evaluate your print colors and monitor colors in the same 
ambient light — daylight, office light, whatever — because that light source 
has its own influence on the colors you see.
Preparing Pictures for E-Mail
How many times have you received an e-mail message that looks like the 
one in Figure 9-6? Some well-meaning friend or relative has sent you a digital 
photo that is so large that it’s impossible to view the whole thing on your 
monitor.
The problem is that computer monitors can display only a limited number 
of pixels. The exact number depends on the monitor’s resolution setting and 
the capabilities of the computer’s video card, but suffice it to say that the 
average photo from one of today’s digital cameras has a pixel count in excess 
of what the monitor can handle. Figure 9-6, for example, shows you how 
much of a 6-megapixel image is viewable when displayed in a typical e-mail 
program window.

261
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
 
 
Figure 9-6: The attached image has too many pixels to be viewed without scrolling.
In general, a good rule is to limit a photo to no more than 640 pixels at its 
longest dimension. That ensures that people can view your entire picture 
without scrolling, as in Figure 9-7. This image measures 640 x 428 pixels. As 
you can see, it’s plenty large enough to provide a decent photo-viewing expe-
rience. On a small monitor, it may even be too large.
This size recommendation means that even if you shoot at your D90’s lowest 
Image Size setting (2144 x 1424 pixels), you need to dump pixels from your 
images before sending them to the cyber post office. You have a couple of 
options for creating an e-mail-sized image:
 
✓ Use the Small Picture feature on your camera’s Retouch menu. This fea-
ture enables you to create your e-mail copy right in the camera.
 
✓ Downsample the image in your photo editor. Downsampling is geekspeak 
for dumping pixels. Most photo editors offer a feature that handles this 
process for you. Use this option if you want to crop or otherwise edit 
the photo before sharing it.

262
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 
Figure 9-7: Keep e-mail pictures to no larger than 640 pixels wide or tall.
The next two sections walk you through the steps for both ways of creating your 
e-mail images. You can use the same steps, by the way, for sizing images for 
any onscreen use, whether it’s for a Web page or multimedia presentation. 
You may want your copies to be larger or smaller than the recommended 
e-mail size for those uses, however. 
 
One last point about onscreen images: Remember that pixel count has abso-
lutely no effect on the quality of pictures displayed onscreen. Pixel count 
determines only the size at which your images are displayed.
Creating small copies using the camera
To create small, e-mailable copies of your images without using a computer, 
use your camera’s Small Picture feature. Here’s how:
 
 
1. Press the Playback button to set your camera to playback mode.
 
2. Display the picture in single-image view.
 
 If the monitor currently displays multiple thumbnails, just press the OK 
button to switch to single-image view.

263
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
 
3. Press OK to display the Retouch menu over your image, as shown on 
the left in Figure 9-8.
 
 
Figure 9-8: The Small Picture feature creates a low-resolution, e-mail-friendly copy of a photo.
 
4. Highlight Small Picture and press OK or press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You see the screen shown on the right in the figure. You can choose 
from three size options (stated in pixels) for your small copy. 
 
5. Highlight the size you want to use for your copy.
 
 For pictures that you plan to send via e-mail, choose either 640 x 480 or 
320 x 240 pixels unless the recipient is connected to the Internet via a 
very slow, dial-up modem connection. In that case, you may want to go 
one step down, to 160 x 120 pixels. (The display size of the picture may 
be quite small at that setting however, depending on the resolution of 
the monitor on which the picture is viewed.)
 
 If you’re a math lover, you may have noticed that all the size options 
create pictures that have an aspect ratio of 4:3, while your original 
images have an aspect ratio of 3:2. The camera trims the small-copy 
image as needed to fit the 4:3 proportions. Unfortunately, you don’t have 
any input over what portion of the image is cropped away.
 
6. Press OK or press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You see a screen asking you to confirm that you want to create a small 
copy.
 
7. Highlight Yes and press OK.
 
 The camera duplicates the selected image and downsamples the copy 
(eliminates pixels) to achieve the size you specified in Step 5. Your origi-
nal picture file remains untouched.

264
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
If you want to create small copies of several photos on your memory card, 
you can go another route: Take the camera out of Playback mode and then 
display the Retouch menu. Select the Small Copy option and press OK. You’re 
then presented with a Choose Size option; choose that option to specify the 
pixel count for your small copies. After doing so, press OK, choose the Select 
Image option, and press OK again to display thumbnails of all your pictures. 
Move the yellow highlight box over a thumbnail and press the ISO button to 
“tag” the photo for copying. (You see a little icon in the top-right corner of the 
thumbnail; press the button again to remove the tag if you change your mind.) 
After selecting all your pictures, press OK to display the copy-confirmation 
screen; highlight Yes and press OK once more to wrap things up.
When you view your small-size copies 
on the camera monitor, they appear 
surrounded by a gray border, as 
shown in Figure 9-9. A tiny Retouch 
icon appears on the display as well, 
as labeled in the figure. Note that you 
can’t zoom in to magnify the view 
of small-size copies as you can your 
original images.
Pictures that you create using the 
Small Picture feature are given file-
names that start with the letters SSC. 
The camera automatically assigns a 
filenumber (the number is different 
from that of your original file, 
unfortunately).

size copy.
Online photo sharing: Read the fine print
If you want to share more than a couple of 
photos, consider posting your images at an 
online photo-album site instead of attaching 
them to e-mail messages. Photo-sharing sites 
such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Picasa all 
enable you to create digital photo albums and 
then invite friends and family to view your pic-
tures and order prints of their favorites.
At most sites, picture-sharing is free, but your 
albums and images are deleted if you don’t 
order prints or make some other purchase 
from the site within a specified amount of time. 
Additionally, many free sites enable you to 
upload high-resolution files for printing but then 
don’t let you retrieve those files from the site. (In 
other words, don’t think of album sites as archi-
val storage solutions.) And here’s another little 
bit of fine print to investigate: The membership 
agreement at some sites states that you agree 
to let the site use your photos, for free, for any 
purpose that it sees fit.

 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Downsizing images in Nikon ViewNX
You can also create a low-resolution, JPEG copy of your image in ViewNX. 
However, be aware that the program restricts you to a minimum size of 320 
pixels along the photo’s longest side. If you need a smaller version, use the 
in-camera Small Picture option to create the copy instead. Or, if you own a 
photo editing program, investigate its image-resizing capabilities; you likely 
can create the small copy at any dimensions you like.
Assuming that the 320-pixel restriction isn’t a problem, the following steps 
show you how to create your small-size copy in ViewNX. You can use this 
process to create a small JPEG copy of both JPEG and NEF (Raw) originals.
 
1. Select the image thumbnail in the main ViewNX window.
 
 Chapter 8 explains how to view your image thumbnails, if you need help. 
Just click a thumbnail to select it.
 
2.  Choose File➪Convert Files.
 
 You see the dialog box shown in Figure 9-10. (As with other figures, this 
one shows the box as it appears in Windows Vista; it may appear slightly 
different on a Mac or in other versions of Windows, but the essentials 
are the same.)
Figure 9-10: You also can use ViewNX to create a small-sized 
JPEG copy for e-mail sharing.

266
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
3. Select JPEG from the File Format drop-down list, as shown in the figure.
 
 The other format option, TIFF, is a print format. Web browsers and 
e-mail programs can’t display TIFF images, so be sure to use JPEG.
 
4. Select the Change the Image Size check box.
 
 Now the Short Edge and Long Edge text boxes become available. 
 
5. Type the desired pixel count of the longest side of your picture into 
the Long Edge box.
 
 The program automatically adjusts the Short Edge value to keep the 
resized image proportional. (The image is not cropped to a 4:3 per-
spective as it is when you use the Small Copy feature on the camera’s 
Retouch menu.)
 
 Again, to ensure that the picture is viewable without scrolling when 
opened in the recipient’s e-mail program, I suggest that you keep the 
Long Edge value at 640 pixels or less.
 
6. Adjust the Compression Ratio slider to set the amount of JPEG file 
compression.
 
 As Chapter 3 explains, a greater degree of compression results in a 
smaller file, which takes less time to download over the Web, but it 
reduces image quality. Notice that as you move the slider to the right, 
the resulting quality level appears above the slider. For example, in 
Figure 9-10, the level is Excellent Quality.
 
 Because the resolution of your image already results in a very small file, 
you can probably use the highest quality setting without worrying too 
much about download times. The exception is if you plan to attach mul-
tiple pictures to the same e-mail message, in which case you may want 
to set the slider a notch or two down from the highest quality setting.
 
7. Select the next three check boxes (Remove Camera Setting 
Information, Remove XMP/IPTC Information, and Remove ICC Color 
Profile), as shown in Figure 9-10. 
 
 When selected, the three options save the resized picture without the 
original image metadata, the extra text data that your camera stores 
with the image. (Chapter 8 explains.) Including this metadata adds to 
the file size, so for normal e-mail sharing, strip it out. The exception, of 
course, is when you want the recipient to be able to view the metadata 
in a photo program that can do so.
 
8. Set the file destination.
 
 In layman’s terms, that just means to tell the program the location of 
the folder or drive where you want to store your downsized image file. 
The current destination appears just to the left of the Browse button. To 
choose a different folder, click that Browse button.
 
 By selecting the Create a New Subfolder for Each File Conversion check 
box, you can create a new subfolder within your selected storage folder. 

267
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
If you do, the resized file goes into that subfolder, which you can name 
by clicking the Naming Options button.
 
9. (Optional) Specify a filename for the resized copy.
 
 If you want to put the small copy in the same folder as the original, the 
program protects you from overwriting the original by automatically assign-
ing a slightly different name to the copy. By default, the program uses the 
original filename plus a two-number sequential tag: If the original filename is 
DSC_0186.jpg, for example, the small-copy filename is DSC_0186_01.jpg. You 
can change a couple of aspects of this filenaming routine by selecting the 
Change File Names check box and then clicking the Naming Options button 
and adjusting the settings in the resulting dialog box. After making your 
wishes known, click OK to return to the Convert Files dialog box.
 
 If you don’t store the copy in the same folder as the original, the pro-
gram doesn’t alter the filename of the copy automatically. That can lead 
to problems down the road because you will end up with two files, both 
with the same name but with different pixel counts, on your computer. 
In this scenario, be sure to input your own filenames for your copies.
 
10. Click the Convert button to finish the process.
 
ViewNX also offers an e-mail wizard that enables you to resize and send 
photos by e-mail in one step. If you use this feature, however, you don’t 
create an actual small-size copy of your file; the program simply reduces the 
size of the file temporarily for e-mail transmission. Also, the wizard works 
only with certain e-mail programs. On the plus side, the wizard permits you 
to send a photo at a much smaller size than you can create with the Convert 
Files feature. For more details, check out the ViewNX Help system.
Creating a Digital Slide Show
Many photo editing and cataloging programs offer a tool for creating digital 
slide shows that can be viewed on a computer or, if copied to a DVD, on a 
DVD player. You can even add music, captions, graphics, special effects, and 
the like to jazz up your presentations.
But if you want to create a basic slide show in a hurry, your D90 actually 
offers you two different ways to create one. The first, called Pictmotion, 
enables you to add music and transition effects. You can also select specific 
photos on the memory card to include in the show. The other option simply 
displays all photos on the card, with no sound or transition effects. Either 
way, you can create and run the slide show right on your camera. And by 
connecting your camera to a television, as outlined in the last section of this 
chapter, you can present your show to a whole roomful of people.
The next two sections explain how to create and play both types of slide shows.

268
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Setting up a simple slide show
Follow these steps to create a basic slide show that automatically displays all 
photos on the memory card, one by one, on your camera monitor.
 
One caveat before you start: If you hid any pictures using the Hide Image fea-
ture, they are not displayed during the show. See Chapter 4 for details on this 
feature and how to “unhide” any hidden photos.
 
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Slide Show, as shown on the 
left in Figure 9-11.
 
 
Figure 9-11: Choose Slide Show to set up automatic playback of all pictures on your memory 
 
card.
 
2. Press OK to display the Slide Show screen shown on the right in 
Figure 9-11.
 
3. Highlight Frame Interval and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 On the next screen, you can specify how long you want each image to be 
displayed. You can set the interval to 2, 3, 5, or 10 seconds.
 
4. Highlight the frame interval you want to use and press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the Slide Show screen.
 
5. To start the show, highlight Start and press OK.
 
 The camera begins displaying your pictures on the camera monitor.
When the show ends, you see a screen offering three options: You can 
choose to restart the show, adjust the frame interval, or exit to the Playback 
menu. Highlight your choice and press OK.

269
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
During the show, you can control playback as follows:
 
✓ Pause the show. Press OK. Select Restart and press OK to begin display-
ing pictures again.
 
✓ Exit the show. You’ve got three options: 
 
• To return to full-frame, regular playback, press the Playback 
button.
 
• To return to the Playback menu, press the Menu button.
 
• To return to picture-taking mode, press the shutter button halfway.
 
✓ Skip to the next/previous image manually. Press the Multi Selector or 
rotate the main command dial.
 
✓ Change the information displayed with the image. Press the Multi 
Selector up or down to cycle through the info-display modes. (See 
Chapter 4 for details on what information is provided in each mode.)
Creating Pictmotion slide shows
Also found on the Playback menu, the Pictmotion option enables you to create 
a slide show that’s a little fancier than the Slide Show option discussed in the 
preceding section. You can select specific photos to include, choose from a 
handful of instrumental songs to use as a musical background, and also select 
from a couple of different transition effects, which control how one photo dis-
appears from the screen and the next one appears.
Take these steps to try it out:
 
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Pictmotion, as shown on the 
left in Figure 9-12.
 
 
Figure 9-12: A Pictmotion slide show includes music and transition effects.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
2. Press OK to display the second 
screen shown in the figure.
 
3. Highlight Select Pictures and 
press the Multi Selector right or 
press OK.
 
 You then see the screen shown in 
Figure 9-13.
 
4. Select the photos you want to 
include.
 
 You can go one of three ways 
here:
 
 
• Selected: Use this option to 
pick individual photos that 
you want to include in the 
show. Press the Multi Selector right to display thumbnails of your 
images, move the yellow highlight box over an image, and press 
the ISO button to tag it as slide-show worthy. A checkmark appears 
in the corner of the thumbnail of selected photos.
 
 
 To temporarily view the selected photo at a larger size, press and 
hold the Qual button. Release the button to return to the normal 
display.
 
• Select Date: Use this option if you want to include all pictures that 
were taken on a specific date. After highlighting the option, press 
the Multi Selector right to display a list of dates. Highlight a date 
and press the Multi Selector right again to put a checkmark in the 
box next to the date.
 
• All: To include all photos, highlight the All option.
 
 Whichever option you select, any pictures that you hid using the Hide 
Image feature aren’t included in the show. And if you created custom 
image folders, only those in the currently active folder are available. For 
more on both issues, check out Chapter 4.
 
5.  After selecting photos, press OK to return to the main Pictmotion 
options screen. (Refer to the right image in Figure 9-12.)
 
6. Choose your background music.
 
 To do so, highlight the Background Music option and press the Multi 
Selector right or press OK. You can choose from five soundtrack 
options; highlight the one you want to use and press OK.
 
 Unfortunately, there’s no “sound off” option, but you can shut off the 
music during playback. (See the list following these steps.)
Figure 9-13: You can select which pictures 
you want to include in the show.

271
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
 
7. Highlight Effects and press the Multi Selector right or press OK to dis-
play the transition options.
 
 As with the soundtrack feature, you have five choices. There’s no way to 
preview the effects, so just highlight the one that sounds the coolest to 
you and press OK. 
 
8. To play the show, highlight Start and press OK.
After you show is rolling, use these techniques to control it:
 
✓ Adjust music volume. Press the Qual button to raise the volume, press 
the ISO button to lower it. At the lowest volume setting, sound is dis-
abled altogether.
 
✓ Pause/resume playback. Press OK. The screen then gives you two 
options: Restart and Exit. Highlight Restart and press OK.
 
✓ Exit playback. You’ve got these options: 
 
• To return to full-frame, still-photo playback mode, press the 
Playback button.
 
• To return to the Playback menu, press the Menu button. Or press 
OK, highlight Exit, and press OK again.
 
• To return to picture-taking mode, press the shutter button halfway.
Viewing Your Photos 
on a Television
Tired of passing your camera around to 
show people your pictures or Live View 
movies on the monitor? Why not display 
them on a television instead? Your D90 
is equipped with both an HDMI outlet, or 
port, for connecting the camera to a high-
definition TV (or other video device), and 
an AV (audio/visual) port, for connecting 
the camera to a regular TV or video device. 
Both ports are tucked under the little rubber 
cover on the left-rear side of the camera 
and highlighted in Figure 9-14. A cable 
for making a regular video connection is 
included in the camera box. (It’s the cable 
that has two plugs at one end, one white 
and one yellow.) For HDMI connections, you 
need to purchase a cable. You need some-
thing called a Type C cable.
Figure 9-14: You can connect your camera to 
a television for big-screen playback.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Before connecting your camera, 
double-check the following menu 
options, both on the Setup 
menu and shown in Figure 9-15:
 
✓ Video Mode: You get just two 
options here: NTSC and PAL. 
Select the video mode that is 
used by your part of the world. 
(In the United States, Canada, and 
Mexico, NTSC is the standard.)
 
✓ HDMI: Unless you have trouble, 
stick with the Auto setting; 
the camera then automatically 
selects the right format for the 
HD device you’re using. You also 
can select from four different for-
mats, if you feel comfortable doing so.
 
Whether you go high def or regular def — what the industry now wants us to 
call standard definition — turn the camera off before connecting the devices. 
For a regular video connection, note that the white plug carries the audio 
signal and the yellow one carries the video signal. With HDMI, everything 
goes through a single connector, and as soon as the two are linked, you can 
view your photos only on the HDMI screen.
When the two devices are connected, turn the camera and TV or video 
device on. At this point, you need to consult your TV manual to find out what 
channel to select for playback of signals from auxiliary input devices like 
your camera. After you sort that issue out, you can control playback using 
the same camera controls as you normally do to view pictures and movies 
on your camera monitor. You can also run slide shows by following the steps 
outlined in the two preceding sections in this book.

playback live on the Setup menu.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
n time-honored For Dummies tradition, this 
part of the book contains additional tidbits of 
information presented in the always popular “Top 
Ten” list format. Chapter 10 shows you how to do 
some minor picture touchups, such as cropping 
and adjusting exposure, by using tools on your 
camera’s Retouch menu. Following that, Chapter 
11 introduces you to ten camera functions that I 
consider specialty tools — bonus options that, 
while not at the top of the list of the features I sug-
gest you study, are nonetheless interesting to 
explore when you have a free moment or two.

When it happens to you, don’t be too quick to reach for 
the Delete button, because many common problems are 
surprisingly easy to fix. In fact, you often can repair 
your photos right in the camera, thanks to tools found 
on the Retouch menu. You can even create some 
special effects with a couple of the menu options.
This chapter offers step-by-step recipes for using 
ten of these photo-repair and enhancement fea-
tures. Additionally, I received special dispensation 
from the For Dummies folks to start things off with 
an additional section that summarizes tips that 
relate to all the Retouch menu options. In the words 
of Nigel Tufnel from the legendary rock band Spinal 
Tap, “This one goes to 11!”

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Applying the Retouch Menu Filters
 
When you apply a correction or enhancement from the Retouch menu, the 
camera creates a copy of your original photo and then makes the changes to 
the copy only. Your original is preserved untouched.
You can take advantage of most Retouch menu features in two ways:
 
✓ Display the menu, select the tool you want to use, and press OK. You’re 
then presented with thumbnails of your photos. Use the Multi Selector 
to move the yellow highlight box over the photo you want to adjust and 
press OK. You next see options related to the selected tool.
 
 
✓ Switch the camera to Playback mode, display your photo in single-frame 
view, and press OK. (Remember, you can shift from thumbnail display to 
single-frame view simply by pressing the OK button.) The Retouch menu 
then appears superimposed over your photo. Select the tool you want 
to use and press OK again to access the tool options. I prefer the second 
method, so that’s how I approach things in this chapter, but it’s entirely 
a personal choice.
 
The one Retouch menu feature you can’t access by using the first technique 
is the Side-by-side comparison option. This feature enables you to compare 
the original image and the retouched version side by side on the monitor. 
Here’s how it works:
 
1. Display either the original or edited picture in single-image view, as 
shown on the left in Figure 10-1.
 
 See Chapter 4 if you need help with picture playback.
 
 
Figure 10-1: In single-image playback mode, press OK to superimpose the Retouch menu 
 
over the photo.

277
 Chapter 10: Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
 
2. Press OK.
 
 A variation of the Retouch menu appears superimposed on the image, as 
shown on the right in Figure 10-1.
 
3. Highlight Side-by-side and press 
OK.
 
 Now you see the original image in 
the left half of the frame, with the 
retouched version on the right, as 
shown in Figure 10-2. At the top 
of the screen, you see labels that 
indicate the Retouch tools you 
applied to the photo (D-Lighting, 
in the figure).
 
 If you created multiple retouched 
versions of the same original, you 
can compare all the versions. 
First, press the Multi Selector 
right or left to surround the After 
image with the yellow highlight box. Now press the Multi Selector up 
and down to scroll through all the retouched versions.
 
 
4. To temporarily view the original or retouched image at full-frame 
view, use the Multi Selector to highlight its thumbnail and then press 
and hold the Qual button.
 
 Release the button to return to Side-by-side view.
 
5. To exit Side-by-side view and return to single-image playback, press OK.
All retouched copies are saved in the JPEG file format and assigned a 
filename that begins with one of the following three-letter codes:
 
✓ SSC: Used for photos that you crop using the Trim function.
 
✓ CSC: Indicates that you applied one of the other Retouch menu 
corrections.
As a reminder, original photos have filenames that begin either with DSC or
_DSC. (The underscore at the front of the filename tells you that you 
recorded the photo using the Adobe RGB color mode, an option you can 
explore in Chapter 6.) 
 
The specific file numbers of retouched copies don’t match those of the origi-
nal, however, which can be a little confusing. Instead, the first retouched 
copy is assigned the file number 0001, the second, 0002, and so on. 
Figure 10-2: The original appears on the left; 
the retouched version, on the right.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Removing Red-Eye
From my experience, red-eye is not a major problem with the D90. Typically, 
the problem occurs only in very dark lighting, which makes sense: When little 
ambient light is available, the pupils of the subjects’ eyes widen, creating 
more potential for the flash light to cause red-eye reflection.
If you spot a red-eye problem, however, give the Red-Eye Correction filter a try: 
 
1. Display your photo in single-image view and press OK.
 
 The Retouch menu appears over your photo.
 
2. Highlight Red-Eye Correction, as shown on the left in Figure 10-3, and 
press OK.
 
 If the camera detects red-eye, it applies the removal filter and displays 
the results in the monitor. If the camera can’t find any red-eye, it dis-
plays a message telling you so.
 
 Note that the Red-Eye Correction option appears dimmed in the menu 
for photos taken without flash.
 
3. Carefully inspect the repair.
 
 
 Press the Qual button to magnify the display so that you can check the 
camera’s work, as shown on the right in Figure 10-3. To scroll the dis-
play, press the Multi Selector up, down, right, or left. The yellow box in 
the tiny navigation window in the lower-right corner of the screen indi-
cates the area of the picture that you’re currently viewing.
 
4. If you approve of the correction, press OK twice.
 
 The first OK returns the display to normal magnification; the second cre-
ates the retouched copy.
 
5. If you’re not happy with the results, press OK to return to normal mag-
nification. Then press the Playback button to cancel the repair.

 Chapter 10: Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
 
If the in-camera red-eye repair fails you, most photo editing programs have red-
eye removal tools that should enable you to get the job done. Unfortunately, 
no red-eye remover works on animal eyes. Red-eye removal tools know how to 
detect and replace only red-eye pixels, and animal eyes typically turn yellow, 
white, or green in response to a flash. The easiest solution is to use the paint-
brush tool found in most photo editors to paint in the proper eye colors.
Straightening Tilting Horizon Lines
I seem to have a knack for shooting with the camera slightly misaligned with 
respect to the horizon line, which means that photos like the one on the left 
in Figure 10-4 often wind up crooked — in this case, everything tilts down 
toward the right corner of the frame. Perhaps those who say I have a cock-
eyed view of life are right? At any rate, my inability to “shoot straight” makes 
me especially fond of the Straighten tool on the Retouch menu. With this 
filter, you can rotate tilting horizons back to the proper angle, as shown in 
the right image in the figure.
 
Original
Straightened
 
Figure 10-4: You can rotate crooked photos back to a level orientation 
 
with the Straighten tool.

280
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
In order to achieve this rotation magic, the camera must crop your image and 
then enlarge the remaining area — that’s why the after photo in Figure 10-4 
appears to contain slightly less subject matter than the original. (The same 
cropping occurs if you make this kind of change in a photo editor.) The 
camera updates the display as you rotate the photo so that you can get an 
idea of how much of the original scene may be lost.
Here’s how to put the tool to work:
 
1. Display the photo in single-image playback mode and then press OK 
to get to the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight Straighten, as shown on the left in Figure 10-5, and press OK.
 
 Now you see a screen similar to the one on the right in the figure, with a 
grid superimposed on your photo to serve as an alignment aid.
 
 
Figure 10-5: Press the Multi Selector right or left to rotate the image in increments 
 
of .25 degrees.
 
3. To rotate the picture clockwise, press the Multi Selector right.
 
 Each press spins the picture by about .25 degrees. You can achieve a 
maximum rotation of five degrees. The yellow pointer on the little scale 
under the photo shows you the current amount of rotation.
 
4. To rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, press the Multi Selector left.
 
5. When things are no longer off-kilter, press OK to create your 
retouched copy.

281
 Chapter 10: Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
Shadow Recovery with D-Lighting
In Chapter 5, I introduce you to a feature called Active D-Lighting. If you turn 
on this option when you shoot a picture, the camera captures the image in 
a way that brightens the darkest parts of the image, bringing shadow detail 
into the light, while leaving highlight details intact. It’s a great trick for deal-
ing with high-contrast scenes or subjects that are backlit.
You also can apply a similar adjustment after you take a picture by choosing 
the D-Lighting option on the Retouch menu. I did just that for the photo in 
Figure 10-6, where strong backlighting left the balloon underexposed in the 
original image.

D-Lighting, High
Figure 10-6: An underexposed photo (left) gets help from the D-Lighting filter (right).
Here’s how to apply the filter:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image mode and then press OK to display 
the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight D-Lighting, as shown on the left in Figure 10-7, and press OK.
 
 You see a thumbnail of your original image along with an after thumb-
nail, as shown in the second image in Figure 10-7.

Figure 10-7: Apply the D-Lighting filter via the Retouch menu.
 
3. Select the level of adjustment by pressing the Multi Selector up or 
down.
 
 You get three levels: Low, Normal, and High. I used High for the repair to 
my balloon image.
 
 
 To get a closer view of the adjusted photo, press and hold the Qual 
button. Release the button to return to the two-thumbnail display.
 
4. To go forward with the correction, press OK.
 
 The camera creates your retouched copy.
 
Note that you can’t apply D-Lighting to an image if you captured the photo 
with the Picture Control feature set to Monochrome. (See Chapter 6 for 
details on Picture Controls.) Nor does D-Lighting work on any pictures 
to which you’ve applied the Quick Retouch filter, covered next, or the 
Monochrome filter, detailed a little later in this chapter. 
Boosting Shadows, Contrast, 
and Saturation Together
The Quick Retouch filter increases contrast and saturation and, if your sub-
ject is backlit, also applies a D-Lighting adjustment to restore some shadow 
detail that otherwise might be lost. In other words, Quick Retouch is sort of 
like D-Lighting Plus. Well, kind of, anyway.
Figure 10-8 illustrates the difference between the two filters. The first 
example shows my original, a close-up shot of a tree bud about to emerge. I 
applied the D-Lighting filter to the second example, which brightened 
the darkest areas of the image. In the final example, I applied the Quick 

283
 Chapter 10: Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
Retouch filter. Again, shadows got a 
slight bump up the brightness scale. 
But the filter also increased color 
saturation and adjusted the overall 
image to expand the tonal range 
across the entire brightness spectrum, 
from very dark to very bright. In this 
photo, the saturation change is most 
noticeable in the yellows and reds 
of the tree bud. (The sky color may 
initially appear to be less saturated, 
but in fact, it’s just a lighter hue than 
the original, thanks to the contrast 
adjustment.) 
To try the filter out, display your 
photo in single-image playback mode 
and press OK to bring up the Retouch 
menu. Highlight Quick Retouch, as 
shown on the left in Figure 10-9, and 
press OK to display the second screen 
in the figure.
As with the D-Lighting filter, you can 
set the level of adjustment to Low, 
Normal, or High. Just press the Multi 
Selector up or down to change the 
setting. (For my example photos, I 
applied both the D-Lighting and Quick 
Retouch filters at the Normal level.) 
Press OK to finalize the job and create 
your retouched copy.
 
Note that the same issues related to 
D-Lighting, spelled out in the preced-
ing section, apply here as well: You 
can’t apply the Quick Retouch filter 
to monochrome images. Additionally, 
you can’t apply the Quick Retouch 
filter to a retouched copy that you cre-
ated by applying the D-Lighting filter, 
and vice versa. However, you can 
create two retouched copies of your 
original image, applying D-Lighting to 
one and Quick Retouch to the other. 
You then can use the Side-by-side 
comparison feature to compare the 
retouched versions to see which one you prefer.

Two Ways to Tweak Color
Chapter 6 explains how to use your camera’s White Balance and Picture 
Control features to manipulate photo colors. But even if you play with those 
settings all day, you may wind up with colors that you’d like to tweak just a tad.
You can boost color saturation with the Quick Retouch filter, explained in the 
preceding section. But that tool also adjusts contrast and, depending on the 
photo, also applies a D-Lighting correction. With the Filter Effects and Color 
Balance tools, however, you can manipulate color only. The next two sec-
tions tell all.
Applying digital lens filters
Shown in Figure 10-10, the Filter Effects option offers five color-manipulation 
filters that are designed to mimic the results produced by traditional lens 
filters. (The sixth filter on the menu, Cross Screen, is a special-effects filter 
that you can explore later in this chapter, in the section “Adding a Starburst 
Effect.”) These color-shifting filters work like so:
 
✓ Skylight filter: This filter reduces the amount of blue in an image. The 
result is a very subtle warming effect. That is, colors take on a bit of a 
reddish cast.
 
✓ Warm filter: This one produces a warming effect that’s just a bit stron-
ger than the Skylight filter.
 
✓ Color intensifiers: You can boost the intensity of reds, greens, or blues 
individually by applying these filters. 

285
 Chapter 10: Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
 
 
Figure 10-10: You can choose from six effects that mimic traditional lens filters.
As an example, Figure 10-11 shows you an original image and three adjusted 
versions. As you can see, the Skylight and Warm filters are both very subtle; 
in this image, the effects are most noticeable in the sky. The fourth example 
shows a variation that I created by using the Color Balance filter, explained 
in the next section. For that example, I shifted colors toward the cool (bluish) 
side of the color spectrum.
Follow these steps to apply the Filter Effects color tools:
 
1. Display your photo in single-frame playback mode and press OK to 
display the Retouch menu. 
 
2. Highlight Filter Effects and press OK.
 
 You see the list of available filters. (Refer to Figure 10-10.)
 
3. Highlight the filter you want to use and press OK.
 
 The camera displays a preview of how your photo will look if you apply 
the filter.
 
4. To apply the Skylight or Warm filter, press OK.
 
 Or press the Playback button if you want to cancel the filter application. 
You can’t adjust the intensity of these two filters.
 
5. For the color-intensifier filters, press the Multi Selector up or down to 
specify the amount of color shift. Then press OK.
Manipulating color balance
The Color Balance tool enables you to adjust colors with more finesse than 
the Filter Effects options. With this filter, you can shift colors toward any part 
of the color spectrum. For example, you can make colors a little greener or 
a lot greener, a lot more yellow or less yellow, and so on. I used the filter to 
create the fourth image in Figure 10-11, creating a version of the scene that 
contains cooler — bluer — hues.

 Up pops the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight Color Balance, as shown on the left in Figure 10-12.
 
3. Press OK to display the screen shown on the right in the figure.
 
 The important control here is the color grid in the lower-left corner. 
When the little black box is in the center of the grid, as in the figure, no 
color-balance adjustment has been applied.

 Press up to make the image more green, press right to make it more red, 
and so on. The histograms on the right side of the display show you the 
resulting impact on overall image brightness, as well as on the individual 
red, green, and blue brightness values — a bit of information that’s help-
ful if you’re an experienced student in the science of reading histograms. 
(Chapter 4 gives you an introduction.) If not, just check the image pre-
view to monitor your results.
 
5. Press OK to create the color-adjusted copy of your photo.
Creating Monochrome Photos
With the Monochrome Picture Control feature covered in Chapter 6, you 
can shoot black-and-white photos. Technically, the camera takes a full-color 
picture and then strips it of color as it’s recording the image to the memory 
card, but the end result is the same.
As an alternative, you can create a black-and-white copy of an existing color 
photo by applying the Monochrome option on the Retouch menu. You can 
also create sepia and cyanotype (blue and white) images via the Monochrome 
option. Figure 10-13 shows you examples of all three effects.

I prefer to convert my color photos to monochrome images in my photo 
editor; going that route simply offers more control, not to mention the fact 
that it’s easier to preview your results on a large computer monitor than on 
the camera monitor. Still, I know that not everyone’s as much of a photo edit-
ing geek as I am, so I present to you here the steps involved in applying the 
Monochrome effects to a color original in your camera:

2. Highlight Monochrome and press OK to display the three effect 
options, as shown on the right in the figure.
 
3. Highlight the effect that you want to apply and press OK.
 
 You then see a preview of the image with your selected photo filter applied.
 
4. To adjust the intensity of the sepia or cyanotype effect, press the Multi 
Selector up or down.
 
 No adjustment is available for the black-and-white filter.
 
5. Press OK to create the monochrome copy.
Removing (or Creating) Lens Distortion
Certain types of lenses can produce a type of distortion that causes straight 
lines in a scene to appear curved. Wide-angle lenses, for example, often 
create barrel distortion, in which objects at the center appear to be magnified 
and pushed forward — as if you wrapped the photo around the outside of a 
sphere. The effect is perhaps easiest to spot in a rectangular subject like the 
oil painting in Figure 10-15. Notice that in the original image, on the left, the 
edges of the painting appear to bow slightly outward. Pincushion distortion 
affects the photo in the opposite way, making center objects appear smaller 
and farther away, as if you wrapped the photo around the inside of a sphere.
 
You can minimize the chances of distortion by researching your lens pur-
chases carefully. Photography magazines and online photography sites regu-
larly measure and report distortion performance in their lens reviews.

290
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
Slight barrel distortion
After Distortion Correction filter
 
Figure 10-15: Barrel distortion makes straight lines appear to bow outward.
If you do notice a small amount of distortion, the Retouch menu offers a 
Distortion Control option that can help remove it. I applied the filter to create 
the second version of the subject in Figure 10-15, for example. Less helpful, in 
my opinion, is a related filter, the Fisheye filter, that actually creates distor-
tion in an attempt to replicate the look of a photo taken with a fisheye lens.
 
The extent of the in-camera adjustment you can apply is fairly minimal. 
Additionally, I find it a little difficult to gauge my results on the camera moni-
tor because you can’t display any sort of alignment grid over the image to 
help you find the right degree of correction. For those reasons, I prefer to 
do this kind of work in my photo editor. Wherever you make the correction, 
understand that distortion correction filters crop away part of your existing 
scene as part of the alteration, just like the Straighten tool, covered earlier in 
this chapter.
All that said, the first step in applying either filter is to display your photo in 
single-image playback mode and then press OK to display the Retouch menu. 
Highlight the filter you want to use and press OK again. From that point, the 
process depends on which of the two filters you’re using:
 
✓ Distortion Control: After you press OK to select the filter, you see the 
screen shown on the left in Figure 10-16. For some lenses, an Auto option 
is available; as its name implies, this option attempts to automatically 
apply the right degree of correction. If the Auto option is dimmed or you 
prefer to do the correction on your own, choose Manual and press OK 
to display the right screen in the figure. The little scale under the image 
represents the degree and direction of shift that you’re applying. Press 
the Multi Selector right to reduce barrel distortion; press left to reduce 
pincushioning. Press OK when you’re ready to make your corrected 
copy of the photo.

Figure 10-16: Use the Distortion Control filter to reduce barrel or pincushion distortion.
 
✓ Fisheye: After you highlight the filter name and press OK, you see a 
screen similar to the right one in Figure 10-16. This time, the scale at the 
bottom of the image indicates the strength of the distortion effect, how-
ever. Press the Multi Selector right or left to adjust the amount. Then 
press OK to create the fisheye copy.
Adding a Starburst Effect
Want to give your photo a little extra sparkle? Experiment with your D90’s 
Cross Screen filter. This filter adds a starburst-like effect to the brightest 
areas of your image, as illustrated in Figure 10-17.
 
 
Figure 10-17: The Cross Screen filter adds a starburst effect.

292
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Traditional photographers create this effect by placing a special filter over 
the camera lens; the filter is sometimes known as a Star filter instead of a 
Cross Screen filter. With your D90, you can apply a digital version of the filter 
via the Retouch menu, as follows:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image playback mode and press OK to 
call up the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight Filter Effects and press OK.
 
3. Highlight Cross Screen and press OK. 
 
 You see the screen shown in Figure 10-18. The preview shows you the 
results of the Cross Screen filter at the current filter settings.

5. Highlight Save and press OK to create your star-crossed image.
Keep in mind that the number of starbursts the filter applies depends on 
your image. You can’t change that number; the camera automatically adds 
the twinkle effect wherever it finds very bright objects. If you want to control 
the exact placement of the starbursts, you may want to forgo the in-camera 
filter and find out whether your photo software offers a more flexible star-
filter effect. (You can also create the effect manually by painting the cross 
strokes onto the image in your photo editor.) 
Cropping Your Photo
To crop a photo simply means to trim away some of its perimeter. Cropping 
away excess background can often improve an image, as illustrated by my 
original butterfly scene, shown in Figure 10-19, and its cropped cousin, shown 
in Figure 10-20. When shooting this photo, I couldn’t get close enough to the 
butterfly to fill the frame with it, and as a result, the original composition suf-
fers. Not only is there too much extraneous background, you can see the foot 
of another photographer in the upper-right corner. So I simply cropped the 
image to the composition you see in Figure 10-20.
 
 
Figure 10-19: The original contains too much extraneous background.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 
Figure 10-20: Cropping creates a better composition and 
 
eliminates background clutter.
With the Trim function on the Retouch menu, you can crop a photo right in 
the camera. Note a few things about this feature:
 
✓ You can crop your photo to three different aspect ratios: 3:2, which 
maintains the original proportions and matches that of a 4 x 6-inch print; 
4:3, the proportions of a standard computer monitor or television (that 
is, not a wide-screen model); and 5:4, which gives you the same propor-
tions as an 8 x 10-inch print. If your purpose for cropping is to prepare 
your image for a frame size that doesn’t match any of these aspect 
ratios, crop in your photo software instead.
 
✓ For each aspect ratio, you can choose from six crop sizes. The sizes are 
stated in pixel terms — for example, if you select the 3:2 aspect ratio, 
you can crop the photo to measurements of 3424 x 2280 pixels, 2560 x 
1704 pixels, 1920 x 1280 pixels, 1280 x 856 pixels, 960 x 640 pixels, and 
640 x 424 pixels. 
 
✓ After you apply the Trim function, you can’t apply any other fixes from 
the Retouch menu. So make cropping the last of your retouching steps.
Keeping those caveats in mind, trim your image as follows:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image view and press OK to launch the 
Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight Trim and press OK.

295
 Chapter 10: Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
 
 Now you see a screen similar to the one in Figure 10-21. The yellow high-
light box indicates the current cropping frame. Anything outside the 
frame is set to be trimmed away.

screen, as shown in Figure 10-21.
 
4. Adjust the cropping frame size and placement as needed.
 
 The current crop size appears in the upper-left corner of the screen. 
(Refer to Figure 10-21.) You can adjust the size and placement of the 
cropping frame like so:
 
 
• Reduce the size of the cropping frame. Press and release the 
ISO button. Each press of the button further reduces the crop 
size.
 
 
• Enlarge the cropping frame. Press the Qual button to expand the 
crop boundary and leave more of your image intact.
 
• Reposition the cropping frame. Press the Multi Selector up, down, 
right, and left to shift the frame position.
 
5. Press OK to trim the image.

Ten Special-Purpose Features 
to Explore on a Rainy Day
In This Chapter
▶ Adding text comments to images
▶ Creating a custom menu and image-storage folder
▶ Changing the function of some controls
▶ Combining two (or three) photos into one
C
onsider this chapter the literary equivalent of the end of one of those 
late-night infomercial offers — the part where the host exclaims, “But 
wait! There’s more!”
The ten features covered in these pages fit the category of 
“interesting bonus.” They aren’t the sort of features that 
drive people to choose one camera over another, and 
they may come in handy only for certain users, on 
certain occasions. Still, they’re included at no extra 
charge with your camera purchase, so check ’em 
out when you have a few spare moments. Who 
knows; you may discover that one of these bonus 
features is actually a hidden gem that provides just 
the solution you need for one of your photography 
problems.
Annotate Your Images
Through the Image Comment feature on the Setup menu, you 
can add text comments to your picture files. Suppose, for example, that 
you’re traveling on vacation and visiting a different destination every day. 
You can annotate all the pictures you take on a particular outing with the 
name of the location or attraction. You can then view the comments either 

298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
in Nikon ViewNX, which ships free with your camera, or Capture NX 2, which 
you must buy separately. The comments also appear in some other photo 
programs that enable you to view metadata.
Here’s how the Image Comment feature works:
 
1. Display the Setup menu and highlight Image Comment, as shown on 
the left in Figure 11-1.
 
 
Figure 11-1: You can tag pictures with text comments that you can view in Nikon ViewNX.
 
2. Press OK to display the right screen in the figure.
 
3. Highlight Input Comment and 
press the Multi Selector right.
 
 Now you see a keyboard-type 
screen like the one shown in 
Figure 11-2.
 
4. Use the Multi Selector to high-
light the first letter of the text 
you want to add.
 
 
5. Press the Qual button to enter 
that letter into the display box at 
the bottom of the screen.
 
6. Keep highlighting letters and 
pressing the Qual button to con-
tinue entering your comment.
 
 Your comment can be up to 36 characters long.
 
 
 To move the text cursor, press and hold the ISO button as you press the 
Multi Selector in the direction you want to shift the cursor.
Figure 11-2: Highlight a letter and press the 
Qual button to enter it into the comment box.

299
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
 
 
 To delete a letter, move the cursor under the offending letter and then 
press the Delete button.
 
7. To save the comment, press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the Image Comment menu.
 
8. Highlight Attach Comment and press the Multi Selector right to put a 
check mark in the box.
 
 The check mark turns the Image Comment feature on.
 
9. Highlight Done and press OK to wrap things up.
 
 You’re returned to the Setup menu. The Image Comment menu item 
should now be set to On.
 
The camera applies your comment to all pictures you take after turning on Image 
Comment. To disable the feature, revisit the Image Comment menu, highlight 
Attach Comment, and press the Multi Selector right to toggle the check mark off.
To view comments in Nikon ViewNX, display the Metadata tab. (Click the 
tab on the left side of the program window.) Select an image by clicking its 
thumbnail. The Image Comment text appears in the File Info 2 section of the 
tab, as shown in Figure 11-3. (If the panel is closed, click the little triangle 
next to File Info 2.) See Chapter 8 for more details about using ViewNX.

Creating Your Own Menu
Keeping track of how to access all of the D90’s options can be a challenge, 
especially when it comes to those that you adjust through menus. To make 
things a little easier, you can build a custom menu that holds up to 20 of the 
options you use most frequently. Check it out:
 
1. Display the Recent Settings/My Menu menu, as shown on the left in 
Figure 11-4.
 
 
Figure 11-4: You can create a custom menu to hold up to 20 of the settings you access most often.
 
2. Scroll to the bottom of the menu, highlight Choose Tab, and press OK.
 
 You see the second screen shown in Figure 11-4.
 
3. Highlight My Menu and press OK.
 
 The main My Menu screen appears, as shown on the left in Figure 11-5.
 
 
Figure 11-5: Select Add Items to add options to your custom menu.

301
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
 
4. Highlight Add Items and press OK.
 
 Now you see a list of the five main camera menus, as shown on the right 
in Figure 11-5. 
 
5. Highlight a menu that contains an option you want to add to your 
custom menu and then press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You see a list of all available options on that menu, as shown in Figure 
11-6. (If you select the Custom Setting menu, you have to first select the 
submenu that contains the option you want to put on your menu.)
 
 
Figure 11-6: Highlight a menu item and press OK to add it to your custom menu.
 
 A few items can’t be added to a custom menu. A little box with a slash 
through it appears next to those items.
 
6. To add an item to your custom menu, highlight it and press OK.
 
 Now you see the Choose Position screen, where you can change the 
order of your menu items. For now, just press OK to return to the My 
Menu screen; you can set up the order of your menu items later. (See 
the list following these steps.) The menu item you just added appears at 
the top of the My Menu screen.
 
7. Repeat Steps 4–6 to add more items to your menu.
 
 When you get to Step 5, a check mark appears next to any item that’s 
already on your menu.
After creating your custom menu, you can access it by pressing the Menu 
button and choosing the Recent Settings/My Menu screen. (If you want to 
switch to the Recent Settings menu, select Choose Tab to display the right 
screen shown in Figure 11-4 and then select Recent Settings.)

302
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
You can reorder the menu items and remove items as follows:
 
✓ Change the order of menu options. Display your custom menu and 
highlight Rank Items, as shown on the left in Figure 11-7. You then see a 
screen that lists all your menu items in their current order. Highlight a 
menu item, as shown on the right in the figure, press OK, and then use 
the Multi Selector to move it up or down the list. Press OK to lock in the 
new position of the menu item. When you’re happy with the order of 
the menu items, press the Multi Selector left to return to the My Menu 
screen.
 
✓ Remove menu items. Again, head for the My Menu screen. Select 
Remove Items and press the Multi Selector right. You see a list of all the 
current menu items, with an empty box next to each item. To remove 
an item, highlight it and press the Multi Selector right. A checkmark 
then appears in that item’s box. After tagging all the items you want to 
remove, highlight Done and press OK.
 
 
Figure 11-7: Choose Rank Items to change the order of menu items.
Creating Custom Image Folders
By default, your camera initially stores all your images in one folder, which 
it names 100NCD90. Folders have a storage limit of 999 images; when you 
exceed that number, the camera creates a new folder, assigning a name that 
indicates the folder number — 101NCD90, 102NCD90, and so on.
If you choose, however, you can create your own, custom-named folders. 
For example, perhaps you sometimes use your camera for business and 
sometimes for personal use. To keep your images separate, you can set up 
one folder named DULL and one named FUN — or perhaps something less 
incriminating, such as WORK and HOME.

303
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
Whatever your folder-naming idea, you create custom folders like so:
 
1. Display the Shooting menu and highlight Active Folder, as shown on 
the left in Figure 11-8.
 
 
Figure 11-8: You can create custom folders to organize your images right on the camera.
 
2. Press OK to display the screen shown on the right in Figure 11-8.
 
3. Highlight New and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You see a keyboard-style screen similar to the one used to create image 
comments, as described at the start of the chapter. The folder-naming 
version appears on the left in Figure 11-9.
 
 
Figure 11-9: Folder names can contain up to five characters.
 
4. Enter a folder name up to five characters long.

304
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 Use these techniques:
 
 
• To enter a letter, highlight it by using the Multi Selector. Then 
press the Qual button.
 
 
• To move the text cursor, press and hold the ISO button and then 
press the Multi Selector in the direction you want to move the 
cursor.
 
 
• To delete a letter, place the cursor under it and press the Delete 
button.
 
5. After creating your folder name, press OK to complete the process and 
return to the Shooting menu.
 
 The folder you just created is automatically selected as the active folder, 
as shown on the right in Figure 11-9.
 
If you take advantage of this option, remember to specify where you want your 
pictures stored each time you shoot: Select Active Folder from the Shooting 
menu and press OK to display the screen shown on the left in Figure 11-10. 
Highlight Select Folder and press the Multi Selector right to display a list of all 
your folders, as shown on the right. Highlight the folder that you want to use 
and press OK. Your choice also affects which images you can view in Playback 
mode; see Chapter 4 to find out how to select the folder 
you want to view.
 
 
Figure 11-10: Remember to specify where you want to store new images.
If necessary, you can rename a custom folder by using the Rename option on 
the Active Folder screen. (Refer to the left screen in Figure 11-10.) The Delete 
option on the same screen enables you to get rid of all empty folders on the 
memory card.

305
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
Customizing External Controls
When your camera ships from the Nikon factory, the buttons and command 
dials are set up to work as described throughout this book. You can, how-
ever, assign different functions to three buttons, as well as to the two com-
mand dials. You can even alter the performance of the little switch on the 
On/Off button that lights up the control panel. 
The next sections explore your options.
Adjusting the On/Off switch
Normally, rotating the power switch past On to the position marked by the 
little light bulb icon temporarily illuminates the control panel. But you also 
can use the switch to light up the control panel and bring up the Shooting 
Information display at the same time.
I personally don’t see much benefit in making this change, seeing as how you 
can simply press the Info button to display the Shooting Information screen. 
But if you disagree, visit the Custom Setting menu, choose the Controls 
submenu, and press OK. Highlight the Switch option, as shown on the left 
in Figure 11-11, and press OK to display the second screen in the figure. 
Highlight the second option and press OK again.
 
 
Figure 11-11: You can light up both the Control panel and Shooting Information screen 
 
with the On/Off switch.
Changing the function of the OK button
By default, pressing the OK button when you’re in picture-taking mode auto-
matically selects the center focus point. I think that’s a fairly handy feature, 
but if you prefer, you can tell the camera that you instead want it to highlight 
the active focus point when you press the button. Or you can disable the 
button during shooting altogether. (It retains its normal function during pic-
ture playback and for choosing items from menus.)

306
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Once again, you make the call via the Controls submenu of the Custom 
Setting menu. Highlight OK Button (Shooting Mode), as shown on the left in 
Figure 11-12, and press OK to display the three options shown on the right. 
Highlight your choice and press OK to wrap things up.
 
 
Figure 11-12: These options affect the result of pressing the OK button in shooting mode.
Assigning a duty to the Function button
Tucked away on the right-front side of the camera, just under the autofocus-
assist lamp, the Function (Fn) button is set by default to activate the Fv Lock 
function (Flash Value Lock, detailed in Chapter 5). But if you don’t use that 
function often, you may want to assign some other purpose to the button. 
 
 
Figure 11-13: You can assign any number of jobs to the Function button.
You establish the button’s behavior via the Assign Func. Button option, 
found on the Controls submenu of the Custom Setting menu and shown on 
the left in Figure 11-13. After highlighting the option, press OK to display the 

307
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
screen shown on the right in the figure. Here’s a quick description of the pos-
sible settings. (Scroll the display to uncover the options at the end of the list, 
not shown in the figure.) 
 
✓ Framing Grid: If you select this option, pressing the Fn button while 
rotating the main command dial toggles the viewfinder grid on and off. 
See Chapter 1 for more about the grid.
 
✓ AF-Area Mode: At this setting, you can press the button and rotate the 
main dial to change the AF-Area mode. Chapter 6 explains that option, 
which is related to autofocusing.
 
✓ Center Focus Point: Pressing the button while rotating the main com-
mand dial switches the center focus point option from the normal to wide 
area setting. Again, see Chapter 6 to find out more about that setting.
 
✓ FV Lock: This is the default setting; you press the button to lock the cur-
rent flash exposure value. See Chapter 5 for more about flash. 
 
✓ Flash Off: At this setting, you can temporarily disable the flash by press-
ing the Fn button as you press the shutter button. See Chapter 5 for 
more information about flash photography.
 
✓ Matrix Metering/Center-Weighted Metering/Spot Metering: These 
three options set the camera to the selected metering mode while the 
button is pressed. You can adjust the metering mode only in the P, S, A, 
and M exposure modes, so, naturally, the button relates only to those 
modes if you choose one of these settings. And the options are dimmed 
on the Assign Function Button list in any other modes. See Chapter 5 for 
an explanation of metering modes.
 
✓ Access Top Item in My Menu: If you create a custom menu, as explained 
earlier in this chapter, you can set the Fn button to display the menu 
and immediately highlight the first item on the menu.
 
✓ + NEF (RAW): This setting relates to the Image Quality option, introduced 
in Chapter 3. If you set that option to JPEG Basic, Fine, or Normal and then 
press the Fn button, the camera records two copies of the next pictures 
you shoot: a JPEG version plus a second image in the NEF format. Press 
the button again or turn off the camera to stop recording the NEF version.
After selecting the function you want to assign, press OK to lock in your choice.
Changing the function of the AE-L/AF-L button
Set just to the right of the viewfinder, the AE-L/AF-L button enables you to 
lock focus and exposure settings when you shoot in autoexposure and auto-
focus modes, as explored in Chapters 5 and 6. 

308
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Normally, autofocus and autoexposure are locked when you press the button, 
and they remain locked as long as you keep your finger on the button. But you 
can change the button’s behavior. To access the available options, open the 
Custom Setting menu, navigate to the Controls submenu, press OK, and then 
highlight Assign AE-L/AF-L Button, as shown on the left in Figure 11-14. Press 
OK to display the options shown on the right in the figure.
 
 
Figure 11-14: You can set the AE-L/AF-L button to lock autoexposure only if you prefer.
The options produce these results:
 
✓ AE/AF Lock: This is the default setting. Focus and exposure remain 
locked as long as you press the button.
 
✓ AE Lock Only: Autoexposure is locked as long as you press the button; 
autofocus isn’t affected. (You can still lock focus by pressing the shutter 
button halfway.)
 
✓ AF Lock Only: Focus remains locked as long as you press the button. 
Exposure isn’t affected.
 
✓ AE Lock (Hold): This one locks exposure only with a single press of the 
button. The exposure lock remains in force until you press the button 
again or the exposure meters turn off.
 
✓ AF-ON: Pressing the button activates the camera’s autofocus mecha-
nism. If you choose this option, you can’t lock autofocus by pressing the 
shutter button halfway.
 
✓ Fv Lock: If you don’t have any use for the autofocus/autoexposure lock-
ing options, this choice may come in handy. You can set the button to 
instead lock the flash value, a feature explored in Chapter 5. You then 
can set the Fn button, which normally handles that Fv Lock, to some 
other operation. See the preceding section for details.

309
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
After highlighting the option you want to use, press OK.
 
The information that I give in this book with regard to using autofocus and 
autoexposure assumes that you stick with the default setting. So if you change 
the button’s function, remember to amend my instructions accordingly.
On a related note, my instructions also assume that the Shutter Release 
Button AE-L option, found on the Timers/AE Lock submenu of the Custom 
Setting menu, is set to its default, which is Off. At that setting, pressing the 
shutter button halfway locks focus but not exposure. If you turn the feature 
on, your half-press of the shutter button locks both focus and exposure. 
Customizing the command dials
Okay, let me say up front that I present this option to you only in the interest 
of complete coverage of all your customization choices. But I really suggest 
that you do not take advantage of this particular feature, which enables you 
to change the function of the main command dial (on the back of the camera) 
and the subcommand dial (front of the camera). If you do, not only will the 
instructions in this book be off base, but so will all the instructions in the 
camera manual.
Not convinced? Well, you can explore the options by opening the Custom 
Setting menu, opening the Controls submenu, and then selecting the Customize 
Command Dials option. There, you find three settings, each of which controls 
a different aspect of how the command dials behave. Be sure to read about the 
many ramifications of each choice in the camera manual before you change 
any from their default settings, which are shown in Figure 11-15.
 
 
Figure 11-15: Just because you can customize the command dials doesn’t mean you should.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Two Roads to a Multi-Image Exposure
The D90 offers two features that enable you to merge two photographs into one:
 
✓ Multiple Exposure (Shooting menu): With this option, you can combine 
your next two or three shots. After you enable the option and take your 
shots, the camera merges them into one NEF (Raw) file. The three shots 
used to create the composite aren’t recorded and saved separately.
 
✓ Image Overlay (Retouch menu): This option enables you to accom-
plish the same thing, but with two Raw images that already exist on 
the memory card. I used this option to combine a photo of a werewolf 
friend, shown on the top left in Figure 11-16, with a nighttime garden 
scene, shown on the top right. The result is the ghostly image shown 
beneath the two originals. Oooh, scary!
Figure 11-16: Image Overlay merges two Raw (NEF) photos into one.

311
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
On the surface, both options sound kind of cool. The problem is that you 
can’t control the opacity or positioning of the individual images in the com-
bined photo. For example, you might assume that you could use this feature 
to create one of those old-fashioned “two views” portrait composites, with 
one area of the picture showing a frontal view of the subject and another 
showing a profile shot. But this really works well only if the background in 
both images is a solid color (black works well), and you compose your two 
shots so that the subjects don’t overlap in the combined photo. Otherwise, 
you get the ghostly portrait effect like what you see in my example.
In the interest of reserving space in this book for features that I think you will 
find much more useful, I leave you to explore these two on your own. (The 
manual explains the steps involved in using each of them.) I think, however, 
that you’ll find photo compositing much easier and much more flexible if you 
do the job in your photo editing software.
