CHAPTER 1
Understanding 
the SEO Process
When you have a website or a blog, most of your visitors find you using 
a search engine. The search engine user types his keywords or questions 
and the search engine displays the results from the indexed web pages 
that are relevant to the user search. Optimizing your website for search 
engines can help bring more traffic to your website and help it achieve 
better rankings in different search engines.

earch Engine Optimization (SEO) refers to methods and techniques that you can apply to a 
website to increase its traffic, rank, and visibility in a search engine’s results page. When you 
optimize your website, it has a greater chance of appearing in the search engine top results, 
which subsequently increases the traffic to your website. The optimization process includes many 
techniques and methods that are applied to the website itself or other sites that are related to the 
website content. Understanding the SEO process requires learning about how the search process 
works, the search page layout, and the different search engines that you target in the process.
Introducing Search Engine Optimization
Discover What SEO Is
Search Engine Optimization, SEO, is a 
process that you apply to a website to 
increase its rank and traffic from 
organic search engine searches. The 
process targets the free search, where 
users use any of the existing search 
engines, such as Google, Yahoo, and 
Bing, to search for a product, service, 
or information. It is different from a 
paid search, where the webmaster pays 
to appear at the top of the search 
pages, as discussed in Chapter 11.
Explore a Brief History of SEO
The process of optimizing web content 
first occurred in 1990, when search 
engines began indexing websites’ content. 
It was much simpler than today, where 
website owners submit their sites to 
search engines. The search engines started 
and continue to use computer programs 
called web spiders or crawlers to crawl a 
website’s pages and index them based on 
the site’s niche and keywords. Early SEO 
was as simple as adding meta tags, which 
are HTML codes that include information 
about a website. Meta tags help search engines determine how the website content will be indexed using 
data such as the site’s title, description, and keywords.

5
CHAPTER1
Understanding the SEO Process
Look at the Google and SEO Relationship
With the launch of the Google search engine, the 
SEO process became more complex. It was 
developed to ensure better and more accurate 
indexing as well as identify the misuse of search 
engine optimization tactics such as keyword 
stuffing, which refers to including irrelative 
keywords in a web page to mislead the search 
engine crawlers. Then, Google started to refine the 
search technology by adding more factors for 
indexing and ranking websites. For example, 
Off-page optimization factors include external links 
to the website, and On-page optimization factors 
pertain to the website structure and content.
Apply SEO to a Website
The correct and standard use of search engine 
optimization techniques, which is known as White 
Hat SEO, helps put your site link at the top of the 
search engine results. Subsequently, this drives 
more traffic to your website and produces higher 
rankings. On the other hand, misusing search 
engine optimization techniques may negatively 
impact the site’s indexing and ban it from 
appearing in the search engine results, which is 
known as Black Hat SEO.
Compete Using SEO
With the ever increasing amount of content on the 
web, gaining visibility has become very competitive 
and it is harder to reach the top of the search 
engine pages and be easily identified by search 
engine users. Thus, this heavy competition makes 
optimizing your web content for the search engine 
a necessary process to ensure good indexing and a 
high ranking. SEO is an essential step after building 
a website, and as important as the website design 
and development.
Explore SEO Resources
You can find many articles and resources on the 
web that cover the search engine optimization 
process. However, these articles alone will not give 
you a full understanding of the SEO process. While 
the articles provide tips and points of view, it is a 
good idea to use a structured guide such as this 
book along with hands-on practice and experience. 
This combination can help you gain a better 
understanding of the process and learn how to 
apply its different aspects to reach your search 
engine optimization goals.

S
earch engine traffic is one of the greatest factors for success for your website, because you can 
turn this traffic into potential clients or website followers. The SEO process includes a number of 
techniques that you need to apply in parallel to move your website to the top of the search engine 
rankings and drive traffic to your website.
Search engine optimization techniques include different on-site and off-site strategies, which are 
known as On-page and Off-page optimization methods. Each type of method is very important and 
required to achieve successful SEO.
Consider SEO Techniques
Apply On-page SEO
The On-page SEO techniques applied to the website itself make it search engine friendly. On-page simply 
refers to the optimization methods applied to the website or blog pages that will appear in the search 
engine results when the user types specific search terms. These methods are the first step in the 
optimization process when you are creating your website. Designing your website starts as early as when 
you are choosing your business or website name and identity. On-page SEO techniques include choosing a 
suitable domain name for the website, which is what users will type in their browsers to reach your website. 
It also includes creating the meta tags added to the HTML code that contain information about the website, 
such as its title, description, and related keywords, as well as optimizing the content heading, site content 
loading speed, keywords, site navigation, and site design structure. Although the On-page SEO techniques 
do not drive direct traffic to your website like the off-page SEO techniques, it makes the site content easier 
to reach by the search engine crawlers. It helps to categorize and index the site pages easier and faster 
than websites that do not apply these techniques.
Apply Off-page SEO
Unlike the On-page optimization techniques, the Off-page optimization techniques refer to the methods you 
apply outside the website to increase its rank, traffic, and visibility in the search engine. The methods are 
implemented and have either a direct or indirect impact on the website’s traffic and its ranking in the 
search results. These methods may use third-party tools or websites such as directories and social 
networking websites to help build links to the website and improve traffic. The Off-page optimization 
includes link building, which refers to increasing the number of links that point to the website content. 
Off-page optimization also includes submitting your website to search engines and directories; and 
promoting it through press releases, articles, and more. You address Off-page methods after you apply 
On-page SEO and add content to your website. Both the On-page SEO techniques and the Off-page 
techniques are important to consider when you are optimizing your website. For example, you can use the 
website social network page on Facebook to drive traffic to a website, while at the same time, the website 
loads quickly, or the incoming user will leave the website without reading the content.

CHAPTER1
Discover Search Engine Optimization
T
he search engine optimization (SEO) process is an important part of your website business. Many 
website owners and webmasters wrongly believe that only the SEO process can do the magic and 
put their sites directly at the top of search results. However, the secret behind successful website 
SEO lies in your complete website management. Search engine optimization is much easier with 
high-quality websites than lower quality websites. Before I start talking about the SEO techniques, 
however, you should consider the following tips for getting better SEO results.
Target Your User, Not the 
Search Engine
When a visitor has a good experience 
on your website, he or she will return 
to the website because of its useful 
content. The number of returning 
visitors indicates the ratio of repeat 
visitors compared to new visitors. 
Even if you use good SEO, if the website content is poor, the results can be very disappointing; visitors who 
come to your website via search engines will not return again, which results in useless SEO efforts.
Practice, Practice, Practice
The final tip to keep in mind when 
you are learning about SEO is that 
most of the methods covered in this 
book call for practice and analyzing 
the results. For example, some 
techniques are more suitable for 
specific website audiences than 
others. So, you need to practice these SEO techniques, apply them to your website, analyze the results, and 
determine which ones help increase your website traffic and rank.
Assign Time Dedication
Optimizing your website is a long-term 
and ongoing process which takes a 
great deal of time and effort to see 
a significant impact on your website. 
Many website owners fail to achieve 
their SEO goals because they seek fast 
results. Planning for the SEO process 
is covered in Chapter 13. However, before you start to learn about SEO techniques, remember that it takes 
time for search engines’ crawlers to index your website content, which may take weeks.

8
M
any users depend on search engines, especially Google, to find what they are looking for. 
When they do a specific search, they follow general steps beginning with the need to know 
information or about a service and ending with clicking the results. While having users complete the 
last step is the ultimate goal, it is important to understand how humans behave on the search page. 
This knowledge helps you figure out what users search for and how they search for it, and tailor your 
SEO process appropriately.
Understanding How People Use Search
Search for Information
You can go to many places to search for 
information, such as search engines, the 
Yellow Pages, and newspapers. The statistics 
show that many people go to search engines 
to find information compared with other 
methods. This fact indicates the increasing 
importance of targeting search engines and optimizing websites for it. Actually, many businesses have 
already started to focus on search engines to improve their websites’ traffic and rank.
Begin Your Search
Users usually go through common steps 
while searching for information on the web. 
The SEO process starts when the user needs 
to search for specific information; for 
example, a user can be searching for local 
services or businesses. When you do a search 
on a search engine, you usually provide a specific search query or a number of keywords, and the search 
engine provides results that you can choose from to obtain relative content.
Using the Most Common Search 
Engines
Search engines use various methods and 
algorithms to index web content and display 
it in the search results page. This is one of 
the reasons users prefer a specific search 
engine. According to comScore, the market 
share for search engines in 2011 places Google at the top of the search engines with more than 65% of the 
market share, and Yahoo is in second position with around 15%.

9
CHAPTER1
Understanding the SEO Process
Turn Your Need into a Search Query
When you do a search, you need to submit your 
request, or search query, as a word or group of 
keywords, known as search strings. The search 
engine uses these keywords to determine the 
results that best match your query and displays 
them in the search results page. In the SEO process, 
you focus on commonly used keywords when 
creating your On-page and Off-page optimization 
plan.
Enter the Search Query into the Search 
Engine
The user types a request for information or a service 
as a search query, and then submits it to the search 
engine using the form that appears at the top of 
the search engine’s web page. In this step, the user 
chooses between commonly used search engines. 
Most users use Google as their primary search 
engine because it loads easily, provides accurate 
results, and uses sophisticated methods to display 
the results that match the search query keywords.
View Search Results
The search results that appear on the search engine 
page are based on the keywords used in the search. 
These results depend on the crawlers that crawl the 
websites and index its keywords. The search results 
consist of two types, the free search results and the 
paid search, or sponsored search, results. Search 
engine page layout is covered later in this chapter 
in the section on understanding search page 
layouts.
Click a Specific Search Result
The user typically scans the search results that 
appear in the search engine page and reviews the 
titles and descriptions. If a result meets the user’s 
needs and appears to be the best result, the user 
clicks it. Otherwise, the user reviews other results. 
The user can also use the search engine’s advanced 
search options, such as filtering the results based 
on the date, the type of content, or specific search 
criteria.

10
W
hile there are different types of search engines, there are also different types of searches that 
users do when searching for information. The type of search a user does depends on the type 
of information he seeks from the search process and the query or the keywords he has submitted to 
the search engine. The three types are information queries, navigational queries, and transactional 
queries. Understanding the difference between them helps you determine the best combination of 
keywords to use to optimize your website content for your focused users and website visitors.
Using Different Types of Searches
Using Informational Queries
The informational search query is used by 
users who seek specific information, such 
as the history of a specific country or 
scientific facts. An informational search 
usually returns a large number of results, 
especially when it is common information. 
In this case, it returns results from large 
information websites, such as Wikipedia, 
About.com, and Yahoo Answers. The 
results of this form of search can be links 
to websites, encyclopedias, forums, 
question and answers websites, discussion 
boards, or academic research PDFs.
Using Navigational Queries
The navigational search query usually 
provides fewer, but more focused, results 
because the user does the search based on 
a company’s name or a specific person’s 
name. For example, the user can search a 
company name such as Samsung or Apple, 
or a historical figure such as George 
Washington. The results that appear for 
these types of queries usually show 
websites and profiles related to a company 
or person specifically or websites that 
have articles or news about them.

11
CHAPTER1
Understanding the SEO Process
Using Transactional Queries
The transactional search query is an action-based 
search. When users do a search to buy a product, 
download a resource, or subscribe to a specific 
service, they are doing what is called a 
transactional search. Users who do this type of 
search are usually searching for products to buy, or 
services to use. For example, a user can search for 
website templates to buy or download. Or a user 
can search for travel or car rental services.
Search a Specific String
Many different types of users search for information 
on the Internet. The experienced user who has a 
full understanding of the search subject knows the 
best search term to use to find relative results. For 
example, the user may use a specific string query 
such as “How to create a High Dynamic Range

Search the Best Term
Sometimes the user knows what to search for, but 
cannot find the best term or the best keyword to 
use for obtaining optimal results from the search 
process. Therefore, the user navigates among the 
various results and tries to find the best link to 
click. For example, if the user is searching for 
information about High Dynamic Range (HDR) 
photography and does not know the best search 
query, the user can use the search term “How to 
create HDR photo effects.”
Narrow Search Results
In this case, this user does not know what to 
search for or how to choose the search terms. So, 
the user simply types keywords to try to narrow the 
search results and gives clues about the information 
desired. For example, if the user does not know the 
best keyword to use when searching for HDR 
photos, the search term would be “How to create 
photos with color depth effect.”

M
ost of the search engines results pages have similar layouts on a desktop and laptop. At the 
top of the page is the query search box, where you submit or modify your search terms. At the 
bottom of the page is the results information that displays the number of results. In the center of the 
page, the organic search results display related content. In the upper-right of the page are the paid 
search results and advertisements. Vertical search navigation results focus on a specific topic, or filter 
results based on the search type. Horizontal search navigation filters search results based on criteria 
such as time.

TIPS
What are the different vertical search options?
The search for a specific type of media or 
information is an essential part of the search 
process. For example, you may need to search for 
only image results or video results. Thus, the search 
engine provides multiple vertical search options, 
such as image, video, maps, shopping, news, books, 
places, discussions, applications, and more.
Is the search layout different on mobile devices?
Yes, search page layout will appear different 
depending on the type of device the reader is 
using. If the reader is using a tablet or smartphone, 
the vertical search navigation will appear 
horizontally across the top of the screen in Google.

n addition to the vertical search, the search engine results page provides other tools and options 
you can use to narrow the results, such as the horizontal search. The horizontal search enables 
you to narrow your search results based on the properties of the search results. For example, you 
can filter your image search results based on publish date, size, and color. You can also filter video 
results based on duration, publish date, and quality. You can use these options to increase the 
quality of the results and reach better results by showing only the ones that meet with your search 
criteria.

TIPS
What are the related searches?
When you do not know the accurate search keywords, 
the search engine suggests more focused keywords, 
which are known as related searches. These keywords 
help you narrow the search results and allow you to 
reach results that better meet with your needs. The 
related searches depend on your search query 
keywords and common searches by other users.
Why should I use the horizontal search options?
The horizontal search allows you to filter results to 
display a specific image size or video length. For 
example, you may need to display videos that are 
short in length, or display only high-quality 
videos. When you optimize your media, you should 
consider how videos will display in your content in 
the search results.

16
T
here are many search engines on the Internet, some of which share the same algorithm and 
techniques and others which have unique algorithms. In order to determine the search engines 
you need to target in your SEO plan, you have to understand how each search engine works and the 
potential traffic that you can receive from it. The major search engines include Google, Yahoo, and 
Bing. While Google is the most targeted engine in SEO, other search engines can provide traffic that 
can even affect your website Google rank in an indirect way.
Explore Different Search Engines
Review the Google Search Engine
There is no doubt that Google (www.
google.com) is the largest search engine, 
and its page rank algorithm formed the 
basic rules for early known search engine 
optimization. It was the first to rank 
indexed pages based on multiple factors 
and display these indexed pages based on 
their Google ranking. Google has an 
enormous number of servers located in 
countries worldwide, and having your 
website indexed by Google can help your website receive a lot of organic traffic. That said, many SEO 
techniques target putting websites at the top of Google rankings so they will appear at the top-most search 
position in the search results page, which is known as Search Engine Results Page (SERP).
Review the Yahoo Search Engine
Yahoo (www.yahoo.com) has its own web 
crawler (Yahoo Slurp) and it uses different 
indexing capabilities to index your 
website. While Google focuses more on 
the concept of the search term and how 
users use different combinations of 
keywords, Yahoo focuses on the search keywords itself. Also, it places a lot of attention on the page title 
and Metadata. Understanding how the Yahoo search algorithm works will help you optimize your website or 
blog for Yahoo search. Also, Yahoo has its own paid directory, http://dir.yahoo.com/, where you can submit 
your website for indexing. Yahoo is now powered by Bing.

17
CHAPTER1
Understanding the SEO Process
Review the Bing Search Engine
Bing (www.bing.com) is a popular Microsoft search 
engine. It is based on its predecessors, MSN and 
Live Search, which were old Microsoft search 
engines. The Bing algorithm places a greater focus 
on the web page title and description Metadata, 
similar to Yahoo. However, Bing has a better way to 
process queries and search terms than Yahoo. While 
major search engines take into account the 
authority of a link and the length of time a website 
has existed on the web, Bing is not restricted in 
this way. This is helpful to remember if you are building a new website, because Bing can index your 
website much more easily than Google, which puts the website domain name age as one of the important 
factors when indexing links and considering it trustworthy.
Review the Ask Search Engine
Ask (www.ask.com) is an old search engine with a 
different method of organizing a search. Ask groups 
the search results in a vertical search that can help 
the user narrow the search results. Ask is also a 
question and answer platform and allows users to 
ask questions and find answers from its own 
database. At this time, Ask is most focused on the 
Q&A search, which you will notice when you do a 
search on the Ask website. The results appear in the 
form of answers to your questions. While this may 
not affect your search engine optimization process, it can still drive traffic to your website if your content 
has been indexed by the Ask search engine.
Review the AOL Search Engine
AOL (www.aol.com) is an old search engine. While 
AOL currently depends on Google to enhance the 
search results for those using AOL as their web 
searching tool, it depends on its own listing or 
external web links to display the search results. 
When you use AOL, you will notice that it provides 
both horizontal and vertical search as well as free 
search results and paid search results, which are promoted links that meet with your search criteria.

browser’s Settings and select your preferred search 
engine from the Search section. 
Can I make changes in Windows browsers?
Yes, the only difference is the location from 
which you choose your new search engine, 
depending on the version of Windows you are 
using. In Windows 8, you can change the search 
engine from the Manage add-ons screen.

CHAPTER 2
Preparing Your 
Website for SEO
Your website is the most important element in the search engine 
optimization (SEO) process. You can optimize a well-built website 
easily and it will get a high ranking by default. A poorly structured 
website may be impossible to optimize and your SEO efforts may not 
help it reach the top of the search engine results. Thus, it is 
important to prepare your website before applying any SEO steps.

efore you start to build your website or choose the name, you have to determine your website 
niche or your business category. Finding the niche can help you to create a clear vision of the 
website’s structure, content, and organization. Also, it will give you ideas about the type of visitors 
you will have and how to design the website and the content to meet their needs. Websites in some 
niches have to be built in a specific way, such as is the case for e-commerce and news websites.
Find a Website Niche
Compare Focused and General Interest 
Websites
Typically, there are two types of websites: 
those that are focused and those that address a 
general interest. Focused websites center on 
specific topics, such as iPhone cases or design 
jobs. While these types of websites are easy to 
optimize for search engines because they focus 
on one topic, it is not always easy to achieve 
the required target, especially if the website is 
a niche website with few visitors. General 
interest websites, such as the buy-and-sell 
websites and news portals, include a variety of content from different sources, which makes it harder to 
optimize them. At the same time, they are not as risky as the focused websites because they include 
different content categories.
Determine What Audiences Need
The audience or the website visitor is the most 
important factor that you have to consider 
when you design your website, build it, add the 
content, and optimize it for search engines. 
You have to understand the website visitors’ 
needs and how they will interact with the 
website. This information can help you 
determine the best website structure and 
content to use.

23
CHAPTER2
Preparing Your Website for SEO
Consider a Product Website 
Placement
E-commerce websites and websites 
selling specific products are focused sites 
that require a special consideration with 
optimization. You need to focus all your 
SEO tactics to help the website appear at 
the top of the search engine results when 
a user types a specific product name or 
related words in the search field.
Generate Revenue
There are many ways to generate revenue 
from your website. One is to sell a 
product or service to website visitors, 
which is considered e-commerce. If your 
website gets a good number of visitors, 
you can also turn traffic into revenue by 
including advertisements with your 
content. Deciding how to get revenue 
from your website depends on multiple 
factors; for example, you need to consider how advertisements will impact visitors’ satisfaction with your 
website.
Establish Your Website Content
Website content varies according to the 
purpose of the site and its business 
target. For example, content on 
e-commerce websites focuses on product 
information, reviews, and image previews 
for the product. Tutorial and training 
websites include articles, images, and 
video websites such as YouTube focus 
primarily on video content.

A 
web host is the online server or place where you upload your website files. The server is a 
computer with a special hardware configuration that enables it to save one or more website 
files. When a user types a website URL in the web browser, the server sends the website home page 
to the user. To understand how the website works, you need to learn basic hosting server terms and 
concepts, which you will use frequently when building your website and uploading it to the server.
Understanding Web Hosting
Hosting Server Types
You can use several different types of hosting servers to host your website on the Internet. With Shared Web 
Hosting, many websites are located in one server and each website has its own patron on the server. This 
service is cheap and suitable for new websites that do not have many visitors. Once your website has a 
greater number of visitors, you can transfer your website files to a more professional server. A Dedicated 
Server is dedicated totally to one website, and the website owner should have strong networking skills to 
manage it. While it is expensive, it can handle large amounts of traffic and large numbers of files. A Virtual 
Private Server (VPS) is divided into small parts, which are known as nodes. VPS provides flexibility because 
you can increase the nodes when the website traffic increases.
Server Speed
The website speed refers to the server’s ability to respond to visitors’ requests by clicking links or loading 
pages. When visitors come to your website and find it loads slowly, they may leave and never visit again, 
unlike the fast websites. The server loading speed affects the visitors as well as the search engines that 
crawl your website to index its content. The search crawlers index the website content in a short period of 
time that can reach seconds. If your server is responding slowly to the search engine crawlers requests, the 
crawlers will leave the website without crawling all the pages. You can learn more about the server speed by 
reading customer reviews and feedback.
Server Configuration
Storage, bandwith, and RAM are terms you should be familiar with when you search for servers or review 
different services. Storage refers to the storage capability of the website. You have to make sure that the 
hosting company will give you enough storage space to store your website files. An increase in storage size 
may lead to greater server costs. Bandwidth refers to the amount of traffic a server can receive. A larger 
bandwidth means that the server can receive more traffic. You need to make sure that the server provides 
enough bandwidth to be able to receive a lot of traffic, or provides a good upgrade plan to avoid any 
bandwidth-related problems in the future. RAM is the server’s random access memory. It is used to handle 
different website files, such as JavaScript files and Personal Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) programming 
language files that are used in creating dynamic websites.

27
CHAPTER2
Preparing Your Website for SEO
Server Security
Many new website owners do not give much focus 
to the website security issue, which can put them 
at risk of website hacking and malware scripts, 
which can infect your website and redirect traffic to 
other suspicious sites. The first important step in 
securing your website is to choose a secured server. 
While it is important to secure your website 
through using strong passwords, you need to make 
sure that the server is secure enough to prevent 
attacks on your website by applying methods such 
as a firewall that prevent malware attacks from 
reaching your website. You can learn more about 
the server security by reading customer reviews.
File Transfer Protocol
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the technology you 
will need to upload the files to the server and 
access the server folders and files. You can use 
different programs to use this service, such as 
FireFTP and FileZilla. To access the server FTP, you 
should have an FTP URL, which will direct you to 
the FTP folder on the server, and the FTP username 
and password. You can create an FTP account from 
the server control panel or ask customer support to 
create one for your site. Usually, the FTP allows you 
to access a specific directory or the main folder of 
the server, which includes the website files, also 
known as the root folder. There are many names for 
the root folder, such as public_html and home. 
The root name can change depending on the type 
of server control panel.
Managing Servers
To help you control your website server, the hosting 
server gives you a control panel, where you can 
create e-mails, and a database, which saves website 
information and content. You can also control 
different FTP accounts. One of the commonly used 
control panels is the cPanel, which is a web hosting 
control panel with a graphical interface and tools 
to make web server management easier. Plesk is 
another web hosting control panel that allows 
administrators to set up new websites, mail 
accounts, and more. In addition to the control 
panel, each server will have an operating system, 
which is the core system that runs the server. Most 
servers are either Linux based or Windows based. 
Some server packages allow you to add more than 
one website account on the same server, which is 
known as the reseller package.
Website Related Terms
Before you start using the hosting server, you want 
to get familiar with some important terms. IP 
Address (Internet Protocol Address) is a unique 
number that is used to identify devices and 
websites that connect to the Internet. It consists 
of four sets of numbers, separated with dots and 
ranging from 0 to 255. Its format looks like 
90.120.100.50. URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a 
web address that you type in the web browser to 
reach a website. It is usually mapped to the website 
IP. Name servers are server-side URLs added to the 
domain registrar that provide the URL to connect 
the website with the server. Sub-domain refers to 
the sub-sites of the main website. For example, the 
website can be http://www.website.com, and the 
sub-domain is http://sub.website.com.

O
ne of the most important steps before you start building your website is choosing a trusted 
hosting service company. You can find many hosting companies on the Internet. Take time to 
learn about each company and read the reviews on the companies. The hosting company should 
provide uptime for the website at all times, which is known as 99% uptime. You do not want your 
website to go down when users try to visit it. You also need to make sure that the server company 
provides reliable customer support. A good resource to learn about different hosting companies is at 
www.findmyhosting1.com.

TIP
What are the free hosting services?
Some companies provide free hosting services that allow you to create your website. Many of these 
companies provide services you can use to create blogs or websites that you can update frequently and use 
to create archived content. While these hosting services are limited in resources and configuration options, 
they are useful for beginner website owners who would like to use them as a tool to learn how website 
building works. Some examples for these free hosting websites are www.wordpress.com, www.blogger.com, 
http://www.squidoo.com, and https://www.tumblr.com. Free hosting services are not recommended for SEO, 
because you need to have your own website hosting server and URL as an initial step.

critical task because it is not changeable. So, you have to choose an effective name that reflects 
the website content. Also, it should be easy to remember and include the important keywords in 
the website for better SEO results. There are many domain registrars that you can use when you are 
searching for domains and then buying them, such as GoDaddy and Network Solutions.

What is the Top Level Domain (TLD)?
The Top Level Domain (TLD) is the last part in 
the URL after the period, indicating the highest 
level in the hierarchical Domain Name Systems 
(DNS). Many TLDs have different types and uses. 
For example, .COM refers to commercial websites, 
.NET to networks, .ORG to organizations, and 
.TEL to communication.
For how many years should I purchase the domain?
Most new website owners buy a domain for one year 
and then renew it. While this is useful for beginners, 
the search engines give more credit to websites that 
are registered for three years or more. More years 
indicate the website owner has a strong desire to 
continue with the website and develop more content 
through the years.

e-mails. Adding a privacy policy is an indicator that the website is professional and respects visitors’ 
information. It is also very important in SEO, especially for Google indexing. You should have a 
privacy policy page to indicate that your website is reliable. While you can write your own privacy 
policy, there are websites that can help you write one, such as www.easyriver.com/myprivacy.htm.

being collected, and the purpose. The privacy page 
should also include information about the security 
of the collected data and information sharing with 
third-party sites and site members.
Are there other free privacy policy generators?
Yes, there are many free generators that you can 
use to create your website privacy policy. For 
example, you can use www.freeprivacypolicy.com to

fter you build your website, it is important to make sure it appears properly in different browsers 
so site visitors can see it and navigate through it without any errors or problems. In large 
companies, testing teams handle this. But individuals and developers can only test their websites 
through a couple of browsers on their personal computers. Therefore, it is important to test your 
website on different operating systems and browsers. http://browsershots.org is one of the websites 
that allows you to see how your website will look on a wide variety of browser versions and operating 
systems.

CHAPTER 3
Building an SEO 
Friendly Website
The SEO process starts with building your website as it should be 
optimized, so the search spiders can crawl it and index its content 
once it is published on the Internet. The SEO preparation steps include 
creating the website structure, ensuring easy crawling, establishing 
the correct links hierarchy, and avoiding any errors that might prevent 
search engine indexing.

You have to consider your SEO methods even before you start to build your website, because optimization 
affects every part of your website, including its design, development, functions, and structure. If you do not 
take the methods for optimizing website content and files, known as On-page SEO, into consideration early on, 
it may be difficult to optimize your website in the future because many of the On-page SEO relates to the 
website infrastructure itself.
Plan for an Optimized Website
User-Friendly Functions
It sounds strange to talk about usability 
as the term is more related to the design 
side of the site developing, but actually, 
it is very important because once visitors 
locate what they need on a website, they 
remain on the website for a longer time. 
If users are satisfied with the website, 
they will save it as a Favorite and return 
to it again. If they find your website 
hard to use and they cannot find 
information easily, you will never be able 
to keep them on the site, even if you use 
every possible SEO tactic.
URL Structure
When you build a website, you should 
name your HTML files so it is easy for the 
search engine to identify the keywords 
and the file categories. For example, if 
you have a page that talks about 
photography basic tips, you can name 
the HTML file basic-photography-tips.
html, and visitors can reach it through 
www.sitename.com/basic-photography-
tips.html. This can help search engines 
index the web page and display it for 
users when they type photography tips in 
the search field.

45
CHAPTER3
Building an SEO Friendly Website
Website Design Structure
One of the important things to consider 
is the website design. The clean design 
with optimized images can load fast and 
search engines can crawl it faster than a 
website with large-sized images, which 
take a long time to load. Also, a flexible 
design that can be modified easily allows 
you to customize your website based on 
the SEO recommendations.
Website Navigation
Navigation is very important to search 
engines, and website pages should be 
linked to each other so users can easily 
reach any page on a website from the 
other pages on the site. A web page that 
does not allow you to navigate to other 
pages on the website is called a dead 
link, and dead links are a bad practice in 
the SEO industry. The best way to unify 
your website pages is to create a menu that is located on each web page that visitors can use to link to 
other pages within the website.
SEO Website Functions
When you build your website, you have 
to consider functions that help the SEO 
process. For example, you can add a 
section under each post or content area 
that tells users about related topics on 
the website. Then they can visit the 
content for the related topics and get 
more information. This can help increase 
your website page views and the time 
users spend on your website.

Create a Website Sitemap
T
he sitemap is an XML-based file that indexes the website’s links, images, and files. It should 
follow the same structure as the website. The sitemap file is usually named Sitemap.xml, Sitemap.
html, or Sitemap.php and it is placed in the website server so the search engines can reach it 
directly by following the website link; for example, it can be www.sitename.com/sitemap.xml, where 
sitename.com can be your own website name. While you can create the sitemap manually, there are 
tools you can use to create a sitemap for your website without needing to learn how to write XML 
code, such as the free sitemap generator at www.xml-sitemaps.com.

47
CHAPTER3
Building an SEO Friendly Website
What are the different types of sitemaps?
There are different types of sitemaps that you can create and upload to the website server. Each of these 
XML sitemaps can contain specific types of links. The XML sitemap can include an image sitemap, which 
contains links for the images in the website and its information. Also, there are video sitemaps, news 
sitemaps, and mobile sitemaps. You can upload multiple XML sitemap files to the same website and submit 
these sitemaps to search engines to ping the search engines to crawl and index them. When you add new 
content to the website, you have to update the sitemap with the new added content.

T
he Robots.txt file is a text document that informs the search engine spiders which parts of 
your website you would like to be crawled and which parts you do not want the search engines 
crawling. For example, if you have large source files, crawling them may overload the server and 
consume the search engine crawlers’ time indexing website files. You can create the Robots.txt file 
using text editors, such as TextEdit for the Mac and Notepad for Windows.

means it is applied to all the search 
engine robots.
What are the Allow and Disallow rules?
Allow and Disallow set the rules for the search engine spiders to 
crawl specific folders on the server or exclude others. Usually, 
you use Disallow to prevent the search engine spiders from 
crawling specific folders on the server; all other folders will be 
crawled by default.

fter you create the Robots.txt file, you need to upload the file to the server. Usually, the Robots 
file is uploaded to the main folder on the server using a technology called File Transfer Protocol 
(FTP). FTP applications upload files to the website server using the username and password the 
server administrator or hosting company provides. There are many FTP clients such as FireFTP and 
FileZilla along with the FTP URL.

CHAPTER3
Building an SEO Friendly Website
Are there Robots.txt generators?
Creating the Robots.txt file may be a little confusing for beginners and any errors in it may accidently 
prevent search engine spiders from crawling specific parts from your site. There are comprehensive free 
tools that generate Robots.txt, with different customization options based on your website needs, such as 
www.mcanerin.com/EN/search-engine/robots-txt.asp. Also, there is the Robots Text Generator, which you 
can find at www.internetmarketingninjas.com/seo-tools/robots-txt-generator/. This tool is much simpler to 
use than the Robot Control Code Generation Tool from McAnerin.

Note: For Windows users, you can 
write the code in Notepad.
Using the Nofollow Attribute
T
he Nofollow attribute is an HTML snippet that is added to the hyperlink code that creates links in 
websites. The Nofollow attribute plays an important rule in SEO, especially in building links that 
impact the website rank. Usually, the links to external websites can reduce the rank of the website. 
Therefore, you use the attribute rel=”nofollow” in your HTML code to tell the search engine 
not to follow this link and discard it when evaluating the website. You can type this code in any text 
editor, such as TextEdit or Notepad, and save it as an HTML file.

TIPS
Does the Nofollow attribute violate Google rules?
There are rumors that Google does not allow the 
Nofollow attribute because it prevents passing the 
website rank from one site to another. This is wrong. 
Google introduced the Nofollow attribute in 2005. 
Then the Yahoo and Bing search engines started to 
use it in their algorithms.
How do I use the Nofollow attribute in SEO?
In many cases, you will want to add external links 
to your website as part of the information you 
provide to visitors. While this data is helpful, the 
reader does not care about the search engine 
crawler and how it follows the links. So, you can 
use the Nofollow attribute with these links to avoid 
a drop in your website rank.

T
he .htaccess file is uploaded to the website server to help you control the web server’s behavior. 
It can help protect your website from specific issues, such as accessing secured directories on 
the server and banning unwanted visitors from specific sources. You can upload the .htaccess file 
to the website’s main folder on the server or any other folder that you would like to apply .htaccess 
rules to. While the file has a strange extension name, .htaccess, you can create it by using any text-
editing application.

Y
ou may notice that some websites can be accessed by typing the website URL with the WWW or 
without it. For example, both http://www.sitename.com and http://sitename.com point to the 
same website. While this is true, search engines still deal with both in a different ways and give 
both URLs different ranking. This is why you need to redirect the traffic from the non-WWW to the 
standard WWW URL. This is known as a 301 Redirect, or permanent redirect. You can apply this 301 
Redirect in the .htaccess file.

TIPS
What is the 301 Redirect’s impact on SEO?
When you redirect your website traffic from a 
non-WWW URL to WWW URL, the web browsers 
and search engine crawlers redirect the traffic to 
the new URL. This can help you focus your SEO 
campaign on one URL and get more traffic and a 
higher ranking.
How do I figure out my website’s indexing status?
You can check whether your website pages are indexed 
with or without the WWW. Go to www.google.com and 
type Site: sitename.com in the search field, replacing 
sitename.com with your website URL. Then, you can 
check whether the indexed page includes WWW.

Work with 301 Redirects
W
ebsites are updated regularly and website pages may change based on updates. When a web 
page’s location or name changes, search engines may not update this change and may still 
see the old name or path, which they interpret as website errors. In order to fix this, you need to 
manually use the 301 Redirect to redirect any traffic or search engine to the new web page’s URL. It 
is also important to do this when you want to move the website from one domain to another without 
losing any traffic or affecting your ranking. You can apply the 301 Redirect from the .htaccess file.
Work with 301 Redirects

61
CHAPTER3
Building an SEO Friendly Website
When do I use the 301 Redirect?
When you update your website, you have to consider the 301 Redirect to ensure that new web page links 
are updated in the different search engines and that no errors appear after you rename web pages or 
remove them from the server. Sometimes, it takes time to learn about the page errors for which these pages 
do not have replacements. In this case, you can simply redirect these pages to the website home page to 
avoid errors. If you own the .com, .net, or .org version of your URL, you can use the 301 Redirect to move 
all the traffic from these domains to the website’s current active domain.

to check for them and try to have as few of them as possible. Clean code that follows web standards 
helps the search engine spiders crawl your website quickly and index its pages more efficiently 
compared to code that is not compatible with the web standards. There are many ways you can check 
website code compatibility; one is the W3C Markup Validation website.

eywords are the most important part of SEO. Most SEO steps call for you to choose the keywords 
that best reflect your website’s niche and to optimize your site either by optimizing the website 
content files for specific keyword, or by sending traffic and links to your website using these 
keywords. Therefore, it is essential you understand how to select website keywords and how to 
optimize them. Your website can focus on a number of keywords, and each page in your website 
should be optimized for a specific keyword to help the search engine display this page when users 
type this keyword in their search queries.
Understanding Keywords
Select Website Keywords
Many factors affect which keywords you choose for your website. You must first determine the market niche 
and audience for your site. This helps you predict the search engine queries users will use. There are two 
types of websites with regard to keywords. The first type is websites that focus on a limited number of 
keywords or just one keyword. These websites are easy to optimize because you focus your SEO efforts on 
only one term. On the other hand, this limited keyword focus is very risky because you need to choose the 
best keyword; otherwise, it will not drive any traffic to your website. The second type is websites that 
include a number of different keyword categories. While these keywords are not related to each other, they 
are related to the same market niche. When you focus on these keywords in your website, it takes more 
effort during the SEO process to optimize content for each one.
Focus on Limited Number of Keywords
If you have a new website that you would like to optimize, you should focus on one category of keywords 
such as photography, wedding photography, photo effects, and nature photography. This will help your 
website to get indexed fast in the search engine and get ranked in these keywords better than the websites 
that do not focus on specific category keywords. Additionally, the SEO process for focused website are more 
easier than the websites that have wide range or keywords. When your website get ranked in specific 
keyword, you can move forward to focus on more keywords and so on.
Use Head Term Keywords
Head Terms refer to one- or two-word keywords such as “jobs,” “fish food,” and “mothers.” These Head Terms 
keywords are very common and are used frequently to describe a website category or product. While these 
keywords require massive SEO efforts to optimize, they do not guarantee you will have success, especially 
when your website is new on the Internet. This is because search engines display older websites and 
products that include this keyword before displaying yours. For example, if you search for the word 
“Photoshop,” you will notice that the first search results to appear are links from the product’s company, 
along with websites such as Wikipedia and large technology news websites. Thus, it is wise to think in 
terms of long keywords instead of hard-to-reach Head Terms.

Mastering Keywords
Optimize Website Keywords
Keyword optimization is a slow, long-term process that requires time and effort in order to see a significant 
impact on your website. So, you have to focus on one keyword at a time, and once you finish optimizing 
some of your website content for this keyword, you can move on to another keyword. Keep in mind that you 
will get the best SEO results if you keep your keyword focus limited. If you are creating a new page on your 
website, you should use your keywords wisely, and focus each page on a specific keyword. For example, you 
can create an article for your website that talks about online business and include the keyword “online 
business tips” to get the page ranked for this keyword category.
Use Long Tail Terms
Long Tail Terms refer to search keywords that include more than one word, such as “free online jobs,” “fish 
types in the Red Sea,” and “free tips for new mothers.” Most users are trying to find specific information, so 
they do not type just one word in the query field and tend to include the important keywords in their search 
queries. Thus, the Long Tail Term keywords can be easier to target. While these keywords have fewer results 
than the Head Term keywords or the same search volume, your website has a better chance of appearing in 
search engines using Long Tail Term keywords. Building content that focuses on these keywords will help 
you improve your website traffic and rank over time.
Apply Keyword Optimization
There are different aspects to applying keyword optimization to a website. Your website’s content is one of 
the most important parts to optimize because it is what the search engine displays when the user types a 
related keyword in the search query field. You also have to optimize the website links and menus to reflect 
website-focused keywords. For example, if your website niche is “online jobs search,” you can have the 
menu links reflect this with text such as “Job search” and “Online jobs.” The other part of the keyword 
optimization is the website code. You have to apply specific SEO methods to ensure that the website code is 
optimized for search engine indexing.

O
n-page search engine optimization (SEO) techniques are applied to the code in web pages, 
filenames, and content. To apply On-page optimization, you need to have a basic understanding 
of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which is the programming language used to create web 
pages. HTML uses commands called tags to tell the browser how to display content. For example, 
you need to add Meta tags to the <head> tags in HTML documents. These Metadata tags provide 
information to search engines about your page. You can start building HTML documents using text 
editors such as TextEdit for the Mac and Notepad for Windows.

simply opening them in your text editor application. When you 
open an HTML document, you see the code in the browser by 
right-clicking the page and clicking View Source. Viewing the 
code for existing web pages shows you how code should flow 
and how SEO techniques have been applied.
What are the WYSIWYG HTML editors?
WYSIWYG is an acronym for What You

editors that allow you to use commands 
and icons to build web pages without 
having to write the code manually.

the <head> tag. Search crawlers index the Title meta tag and display it in the search results. 
You can view a website’s Title meta tag by opening the website in the web browser; the title appears 
at the top of the browser or tab. Thus, the title should be descriptive of the page’s content and 
include the important optimized keywords. The title should be less than 70 characters; otherwise 
Google will omit the extra characters from the search results.

optimized to ensure that the search engine displays the website when users search for these specific 
keywords. Limit your number of keywords to around 2 to 5 percent of your content. Overloading your 
web page with keywords is considered stuffing, and it may negatively affect your Google rank. Some 
search engines overlook the Keyword tag, but it is still useful in others.

TIPS
What makes the HTML code search engine 
optimized?
When the search engine crawlers crawl websites, they 
read the HTML source code for every web page on the 
website. So, it is important to keep your code clear 
and organized. For example, you need to make sure to 
add the meta tags at the top of the website and avoid 
using complex codes and unwanted tags.
What is the different between .html and .htm?
In the early Windows versions, the file extensions 
were limited to three characters, making .htm 
the default extension for HTML files. Nowadays, 
this limitation no longer exists. There are still 
some applications that use .htm as the default 
format for HTML documents, .html has become 
universal and is recommended.

I
mages should be optimized for the search engines. While the search engine crawlers do not see 
the images, they can crawl the image tag (<img>) in the HTML code. The image filenames should 
reflect the image content. The alt attribute is an image tag value that describes the image for the 
search engine. The caption attribute appears under the images and describes them for the search 
engine as well. title is another image tag attribute. While it is not mandatory in SEO, it is still 
important to build a professional image tag in your HTML code.

text for your image.
TIPS
How do I upload images to the 
server?
You upload images to the website server 
using FTP (File Transfer Protocol). It 
allows you to upload images and files to 
a server and display them by typing the 
server’s URL or image path in your 
browser.
What are the best image formats to use?
Web browsers support various formats, such as JPG, PNG, and 
GIF. JPG is the most commonly used format. It maintains good 
quality, and the file size is smaller. PNG is suitable for images 
that include transparent parts. The images are good quality; 
however, the file sizes are larger than JPGs. GIF supports both 
still image and animated sequence. It has a low color range 
support of only 256 colors.

T
he search engine crawls your website for the content mainly to retrieve the information users are 
looking for when they type a search keyword in the search field. Therefore, your website content 
should be optimized to ensure optimal engine indexing. Optimizing website content is twofold. First 
you optimize the content itself using keyword density, content formatting, and the content itself. 
Second you optimize the HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) code that you use to format the 
content display. The content loading speed is another important factor to consider.
Optimize Your Website Content
Develop CSS and HTML Clean Code
When you develop the webpage HTML and 
CSS, you have to consider that the search 
engine will crawl this code. Therefore, it 
should be well organized and clean, so 
the crawler can easily index your web 
page content without encountering any 
errors that would affect the indexing 
process. You can check for website errors 
using website validation service sites 
such as http://validator.w3.org. You can 
use this website to check your web page 
for errors, and then return to the code 
and fix them.
Improve the Content Loading 
Time
One of the important steps in the SEO 
process is the web page content loading 
time. Fast–loading websites let users 
access content more easily and faster 
than slow loading websites. Additionally, 
the crawlers will be able to crawl more 
pages from your website in a shorter time 
and index them faster. Optimizing the 
loading time includes using small image 
file sizes, avoiding code complexities, and 
implementing JavaScript. You can check 
your website’s loading time using http://
tools.pingdom.com/fpt.

CHAPTER5
Building On-Page SEO
Set Keyword Density
The search engine determines the 
relativity of the content through 
keywords within the content. If your 
content includes the right density of 
keywords, that is the percent of times 
your keyword appears on a page relative 
to all the words on a page, the content 
has a greater chance of displaying in the 
search engine pages when a user types 
related search keywords in the search 
engine’s search field. The placement of 
the keywords should be natural and not 
affect the quality of the content. The 
optimal keyword density varies, but generally 2 to 5 percent is a good range. It is important to check the 
keyword density for each of your website pages. This helps you identify how well the content is optimized 
for search engines. You can use many tools to check the density of a specific keyword on your website page; 
one example is www.gorank.com/analyze.php.
Use Internal Links
Internal links refer to the links on your 
web page and links to other relative 
content within the same website. For 
example, you can use a keyword in an 
article as a link to a related article on the 
same website. These links are very 
important because the greater the 
number of internal links you have, the 
higher your website rank. The internal 
links play an important role in increasing 
page views because website visitors click 
internal links to view other pages on the 
website. Also, you can add internal links 
to a web page by mentioning related topics. There are different web tools that help you check the internal 
links, such as www.google.com/webmasters/tools and www.seochat.com/seo-tools/site-link-analyzer. Unlike 
the Google Webmaster Tools, SEO Chat lets you check website internal links without creating a website 
account.

CHAPTER 6
Building  
Off-Page SEO
Off-page SEO is the optimization process that you perform to increase 
your website’s popularity, rank, and traffic. Link building includes a 
number of steps you take to help increase the high-quality external 
links that link back to your website’s main domain or internal posts; 
using keywords known as anchor text is one.

B
efore you start to create your Off-page campaign, you need to understand the market for your 
website niche and the other related websites within the same category. Because the link-building 
process depends on the relativity of the link that points to your website, the first step is to check 
the partner website’s history and other information. It gives you an idea of when the website was 
established or the website age. Older websites have better reputations on Google than newer websites 
because Google considers them trusted websites and, subsequently, has confidence in their links.

What is the Site Profile tab?
The Site Profile tab includes information 
about a website so you have a better idea 
about its category and focus. It retrieves 
this data from the website’s HTML code, 
called Metadata, and displays it so you 
can understand its relativity to your own 
website.
What is the website’s Server Stats?
It is important to learn about the server that hosts the 
website that you are searching for, because it helps you to 
determine if the website is reliable and whether your links on 
this server will have a good reputation with Google indexing. 
You can learn about the website’s server from the information 
under the Server Stats and the Who is Record tabs, which 
show the type of server hosting the website.

Review Website Backlinks
T
he backlinks are links that appear on other sites on the Internet. These backlinks can link to your 
website home page or inner pages. These backlinks are very important in the SEO process, because 
the more links you have, the higher amount of traffic your website receives, which increases its rank. 
You can obtain backlinks by using guest posts, buying text links, submitting website to directories, 
submitting press releases, and so on. Backlinks from related and other high-ranking websites that 
link to your website can help increase your website’s rank in search engines faster.
Review Website Backlinks

CHAPTER6

What are the internal and external links?
The website backlinks consist of two types. The internal links are linked words within the website itself and 
link to other pages on the same site. They can be used to guide the reader to more information on a 
specific topic or related topic. They are also helpful for increasing the page views for the website because 
users will navigate more pages, which increases the time they remain on your website. The external links 
refer to links to your website home page or internal pages from other websites. These websites provide links 
to yours to provide helpful or related information to their readers.

a comprehensive tool that allows you to learn about your website in more detail. It shows your 
website’s authority, which reflects its ranking potential in different search engines, the links to the 
main domain or home page, and the total links to the website’s pages. If you upgrade to a paid 
account, you can learn more about the website’s social network information, such as its links on 
Facebook, Twitter, and Google +.

use it as an indicator for your website’s traffic value. You can use Alexa for comparing other sites’ 
traffic ranking to yours, and apply this information to your link building plans, such as deciding 
whether to partner with these websites or just analyze their performance. Alexa allows you to compare 
up to four websites to the main website and get the comparison details as Graphs on the chart.

leaving the website. It also shows related websites 
and the percentage of traffic by country.
What is the Alexa toolbar?
Alexa provides a toolbar that you can install on

What are Google Page Rank updates?
On a regular basis, Google makes changes in its search 
algorithm to enhance the search process and update the 
Page Rank for different websites. These updates are known 
as Google Panda and Penguin updates, and can affect your 
website and other sites in one way or another. You can 
learn about the history of different changes in the Google 
algorithm at www.seomoz.org/google-algorithm-change.
What is Google Dance?
When Google applies Page Rank updates, 
you can find they fluctuate for some time 
until they become stable; this process is 
known as Google Dance, and it happens 
because updating data on different Google 
servers around the world takes some time.

Submit Your Website to a Link Directory
O
ne of the initial steps in building links to your website is submitting your website to a link 
directory, which organizes different websites based on category and niche. Some of these 
directories are free and others offer paid subscriptions. When you submit your website, you have 
to make sure that the link directory has a high Page Rank. Two of the most important directories 
are the Yahoo Directory at http://dir.yahoo.com, which charges a fee; and Dmoz at www.dmoz.org, 
which allows you to submit your website for free.

submitting your website; you need to have it in good shape 
to avoid being rejected. Also, you need to submit it to the 
proper category and complete the form with accurate 
information about the website.
What are some other useful 
directories?

to a website without a link back to the original 
linked page. This type of link ensures a better 
ranking than two-way links.
What other article directories are available?
While Ezine is the most popular article directory,

to specific keywords in an article, which takes them to your website. The second type provides more 
natural backlinks because they come from related keywords from sites in the same niche as your

What is the different between free and a paid press release?
While a free press release provides basic benefits, a paid press release includes more and ensures that the 
press release appears on the high-traffic websites and search engines’ news, such as the news on Yahoo, 
Bing, and Google. It also allows you to distribute your press release among large websites and their 
followers. The cost to submit a press release ranges from free submission to $400 or more in the United 
States. As a start, use the free services to get practice writing press releases and to see their initial impact

link exchange with sites in your niche by directly contacting the site’s owner and exchanging links. 
You add the owner’s link code to your website and vice versa, or you can register your website with 
link-exchange websites such as Link Market at www.linkmarket.net. With this website, you submit 
your website and exchange links with other sites in the Link Market directory.

what your visitors seek when they come to your website via its URL, 
or via a search engine. Therefore, it is the first element that you need 
to optimize in your SEO process. Although you need to optimize the 
content so it’s easily recognizable to search engine crawlers, it should 
also be unique and professional.

C
ontent is the main part of your website and it is the main factor that search engines use to rank 
and index your website. Even if you spend time and effort to optimize bad content, original, 
high-quality content will receive more traffic and be indexed by search engines much more easily. 
Having good content, however, does not mean that you need to forgo website optimization; the SEO 
process helps your content appear in the top of the search engine results page. Before you add your 
content, you should consider writing factors and how you will produce good content.
Build Optimized Content
Provide Useful and Professional 
Content
When you write content for a website, 
you have to make sure that the content is 
unique and useful for your readers. Search 
engines reward high-quality content with 
higher ranking and better placement in 
search engine results. If your content is 
not good enough, it will eventually be 
buried in the search results page, as the 
search engine places better quality 
content above it.
Use Attractive and Representative 
Heading Titles
The first part of the content that your 
website visitor sees is the header. It is 
also the first part that the search engine 
checks when it begins to index your 
website. When you choose the content 
title, it should represent the topic 
discussed in the content. Additionally, 
the title should compel the user to click 
on your site and read through the 
content. A good title has to contain the 
most important keywords that you focus 
on in your article or post.

129
CHAPTER7
Working with Content
Write for Your Reader
Most website owners seeking better 
SEO positions make the terrible mistake 
of losing sight of their target, and, in 
turn, their readers’ interest. When they 
lose their readers, they subsequently slip 
in the website rankings and lose website 
traffic. It is important to target your 
readers with topics that interest them 
and to use professional, high-quality 
content. Your topics should include the keywords that you expect the user to use to find your content from 
search engines.
Use a Personal Voice When 
Possible
With some types of websites, such as 
blogs and personal sites, readers seek a 
personal experience with an expert and 
would like to hear the expert’s opinions 
about specific topics. For example, you 
can visit an expert SEO blog to learn 
about his or her experience with special 
problems or tips to improve your website 
indexing. A personal voice can help get the reader’s attention because it represents friendly advice for 
someone in a similar position as the reader.
Drive Readers to Interact
When you build your website and add 
content, you have to consider the 
interaction with your readers, which is 
known as the call-for-action process. In 
this process, you try to add functions 
that help users interact with the website 
and the team behind it, such as providing 
a comments section, options for 
contacting you, and poll questions. You 
can drive readers to interact with your website by asking them to share their experience with products and 
opinions about topics. This relationship builds a strong connection between your visitors and the website, 
helping you get more exposure in your website’s market.

Check Duplicated Content
I
t is incredibly important to make sure your website content is not duplicated anywhere else 
on the web. Duplicated content can weaken your website and search engines may penalize it. 
Penalization can vary from reducing your website’s rank to removing it from the search engine results 
page. Duplicated content happens when you copy others’ content or other websites copy yours. While 
you do not have much control over the latter, the former is important because you do not want it to 
appear to search engines that your copied others’ archived content. The process of copying content 
is called plagiarism.

TIP
Are there any other plagiarism checkers?
Many free tools can help you to check website content for plagiarism and make sure that the content you add 
in your website is unique. You can use the Plagiarism Checker (www.dustball.com/cs/plagiarism.checker) to 
check copied versions of text, website content, and students’ papers. Another option is Plagiarism Detect 
(http://plagiarism-detect.com/), a service that allows you to check the possible duplication of website links 
and text by uploading text files. Yet another is PlagTracker (www.plagtracker.com), which supports different 
languages and provides a comprehensive plagiarism checking process.

use this tool if you know exact sections of website content that may have been copied from your site 
and you need to confirm it is identical without reading all the text on the website. This tool provides 
a match percentage for both sources and shows the similar keywords.

You can use other tools to compare text, links, and HTML code to make sure that your website content is 
unique and it has not been copied from other places. DiffNow (www.diffnow.com) allows you to compare 
text and HTML code. Simply enter two website links, and DiffNow shows you the difference between the 
HTML code for both links. At www.comparemyfiles.com, you upload text files and compare them. In 
addition, you can find simpler tools at www.tareeinternet.com/scripts/comparison-tool, www.quickdiff.com,

f you are creating content for your website, you have to make sure that the content is free of 
grammar and spelling mistakes. These errors give your readers the impression that your website is 
not professional and they will leave it without the chance of returning again. From the search engine 
point of view, content with grammatical errors and typos may negatively impact your website ranking 
because your content does not appear to be high-quality content. Many online free tools, such as 
www.spellcheck.net, are available to help you check your website for typos and grammatical errors.

What other professional language editors can I use?
You can use a word processing application such as Microsoft Word or Apple Pages as a basic editor while 
you are writing your content. However, other applications, such as WhiteSmoke (www.whitesmoke.com), 
provide more comprehensive content editing tools. WhiteSmoke focuses on proofreading your content and 
provides statistics and evaluations for it. You can use it as a guide for proofreading your content, but it

content are available. With these websites, you submit a request for content about a specific topic and 
one of the website authors writes it for you based on your needs and requirements. Many of these sites 
provide templates that you can choose from, such as ones for product reviews, press releases, and lists.

also request marketing documents, such as 
product reviews, press releases, and social 
media posts.
How do I choose the article’s length?
The length of the article should be suitable for your 
website audiences. For example, many blog posts stick 
to short articles or the audience loses interest in the 
topic. Alternatively, some websites require longer, more 
in-depth articles to earn high rankings in the search 
engines.

Google Analytics
Google Analytics is one of the most important tools in the search 
engine optimization (SEO) world; it helps you obtain information about 
website traffic, page views, where users click when they visit a website, 
and where visitors live. Google Analytics enables you to analyze a 
website to learn more about it. You can then apply this information to 
optimize your website.

to track its traffic and visitor information, such as the links visitors click, their web browser 
versions, their countries, and more. You can get the tracking code by clicking the Get Tracking ID 
button when you create a new account or property, or you can get it by accessing each account 
property’s information page in Analytics Admin. Then, you can copy the code and paste it into your 
HTML page before the </head> closing tag.
Install Google Analytics Code

151
CHAPTER8
Working with Google Analytics
Where should I add the tracking code?
The Google Analytics tracking code is used to track the pages on which it is installed. For example, if you 
install the code on index.html, the code will track the traffic and visitors on this specific page only. Thus, 
you need to add the tracking code to each HTML page in your website. In some website structures, the 
website header is added to a separate file that loads in index.html when you visit the website via your web 
browser. In this case, you can add the code only in the header file and it will track the traffic from all the 
website pages. Understanding the structure of your website helps you to avoid multiple insertions or 
duplicate code on the website.

website traffic, the high SERP (search engine results page) content, and other information. You 
can use this information to refine the SEO process for your website and track the progress of each 
optimization task to determine the best SEO techniques for your website. For example, you can use 
the Analytics data to figure out the SERP keywords that bring the most traffic to your website and 
other keywords that you can optimize to get better SERP rankings.

a complete report for the website data. When 
the word “Verified” appears next to the 
website in the Analytics accounts page, it 
means the code has been installed correctly.
How do I install the code in PHP sites?
For websites that use PHP as a coding language, Analytics 
code is installed in a different way. In this case, you 
want to create a file on the server with the name 
analyticstracking.php. This file should include the Analytics 
tracking code, which you place after the opening of the 
<body> tag using the code <?php include_

especially when you have large list of websites to track. For example, you can create an account for 
a specific website and its sub-domains. The sub-domains are websites hosted under the main website 
server and domain name. For example, you can have the website www.sitename.com with the sub-
domains http://faq.sitename.com and http://help.sitename.com. Arranging the websites help you to 
get better tracking for the sites and share it with your teamwork.

Working with Google Analytics
How many site accounts can I create in Google Analytics?
Google Analytics allows you to use up to 50 site accounts to manage your websites. In each account, you 
can add multiple properties. In some cases, you may need to create a separate Google Analytics account for 
a specific website. For example, if you sell the website, the buyer will lose all the old analytics details when 
he adds the website to his own Google Analytics account. Therefore, in order for the buyer to preserve the 
old analytics, you should give the buyer your whole Google Analytics account. In this case, it is advisable 
to have a separate Google Analytics account for this specific website.

from appearing in the profile. For example, you can use them to hide traffic information from 
your IP. The Internet Protocol (IP) address is a set of numbers assigned to each website. Usually, 
you need to check the website frequently while testing and developing content from your own 
browser setting. The analytics information about your own website visits is not important and may 
be misleading. Using Filters to exclude your IP data can help you to get more accurate traffic data.

search engine will display your website more 
efficiently in the search results page for 
visitors from these countries.
What is the best crawling rate for my website?
A high crawling rate ensures fast crawling for your website 
updates, but it creates load on the server, slowing it down. 
Therefore, a high crawling rate is not recommended if you 
are running your website on a slow server. If you are not 
sure if your web server can handle this new rate, select the 
Let Google optimize for my site default option.

S
ocial media has become an essential part of most Internet users’ daily routines. Users find friends, 
communities, and information on different networking platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. 
You can use these social networks to increase traffic to your website and enhance its visibility. 
Further, social network followers can help build links to your website by sharing links among friends 
or linking directly to your website. Understanding the social media market and how to engage with 
website followers can help you gather more followers and expose your website to a larger audience.
Understanding Social Media Marketing
Build a Professional Profile
The first step that you need to take is to 
build a professional profile. The social 
media profile is your springboard to 
starting your website promotion. When 
audiences see that you have a professional 
profile with useful updates, they will likely 
follow your page on Facebook, Google 
Plus, and Twitter. When you build your 
website profile on social networks, make 
sure to include accurate descriptions and 
information about your website, including 
the important keywords.
Understand Your Audience
Each niche in the market has its 
particular audience and special 
characteristics. To increase the exposure 
of your business profile, you need to 
understand what type of followers you 
have and their needs. For example, if you 
provide training materials and your 
audience is mostly students, you would 
add instructional updates, tips, and 
challenging questions. Also, recognizing 
your audience can help you identify the 
best social website to start with to 
promote your business.

CHAPTER

Working with Social Media and SEO
Use Personal Language
One of the important issues to consider when posting in 
social networks is using personal language and 
communicating with your audience with a direct tone. 
Personal, friendly language suits social media audiences 
and encourages followers to respond to your updates 
using social networking tools such as Like and Share. However, you need to avoid using a casual tone that 
may not suit some audiences, especially ones in different countries.
Build an Engagement Strategy
Strategy is very important in social media marketing and 
it can help you gain more exposure in social networks. 
An engagement strategy includes building continuous 
interaction with your audience using content that you 
can run directly through social networks such as 
Facebook and Twitter. Further, you can ask followers questions and build discussion threads. Continually 
interacting with your followers helps promote your page or profile because the friends of your followers will 
see their updates and shares about your page.
Consider Frequent Updates
The frequency of your updates refers to how often you 
post on a social network page or profile. It is very 
important to keep the audience engaged with regular 
updates, which can vary from several updates per day to 
several updates per week. Too many updates can have a 
negative impact because it may annoy your audience and turn out to be spam-like messages. Making one to 
four updates during the day is a safe number that ensures good exposure.
Use Different Media
While text content is the king in SEO, images and video 
can increase the number of followers of your business 
page or profile significantly. Each social network website 
has specific media users can interact with. For example, 
Twitter depends mainly on text updates while Facebook 
uses image and video shares. Further, social media sites 
such as Pinterest depend mainly on images.

Create a Facebook Page for Your Business
T
he Facebook page becomes one of the most important tools for social media promotion. You 
can use it to promote your business, interact with clients, or drive followers and traffic to your 
website. Facebook pages are indexed by search engines and appear when the search user searches 
for related keywords. You can use a Facebook page to get better rankings for your website. To create 
a Facebook page, you will need a Facebook profile, which allows you to create as many pages as you 
want. On your page, you can add your website logo, introduction, and contact information.

TIP
What is the difference between pages and groups?
You can use Facebook pages for business purposes, such as building a business profile for your company, 
magazine, or website. In pages, you allow page followers to post on the page timeline. This gives you full 
responsibility for updates on your Facebook page. On the other hand, the Facebook groups are designed 
for public discussion and sharing information among an entire group. In most groups, anyone can post an 
update and news directly to the group, similar to the group’s owner. The difference between a member and 
the group owner is that the owner has administrative privileges, such as the authority to delete updates 
and ban users.

create advertisements on your personal page to promote your business page. Facebook provides 
comprehensive forms for creating ad banners that target website niches and audiences. You can Pay 
Per Click (PPC), pay per impression, which means that your payment model is based on every 1,000 
times the advertisement appears to the viewer. This is known as Cost Per Mille (CPM).

TIP
How does Pay Per Click (PPC) work?
Pay Per Click (PPC) refers to the advertising networks’ charge per user click. As an advertiser, you pay a 
specific amount of money for each click on your banner or link. The price for each ad depends on the keywords 
that the ad targets. The high ad position in the search engine results page is determined based on your bid 
price and your ad quality score, which refers to the ad relativity to the user search query. If you submit a high 
bid for specific keyword and your ad gets a high quality score, then your ad can appear in the top of the 
search engine results page, unlike the other ads with low bid price or low quality and relativity score.

to the United States. Also, the budget that you assign for the campaign will be allocated to all 
the ads inside this campaign. You can use your campaign to arrange your ads and manage it more 
efficiently. For example, you can add a campaign for a specific website or marketing plan.

What is the different between a display URL and destination URL?
When you create the ad group, you add the URL for the website that you would like to advertise. There are 
two types of URLs that you add when you are setting the ad zone. The first type is the display URL, which 
is the site link that appears to the ad viewer. The second type is the destination URL that is the actual link 
that the user visits after clicking the ad banner title. Both URLs can be different from each other. For 
example, the destination link can be too long to appear in an ad banner. You can add the main domain URL 
in the display URL and the long link in the destination URL. This can help the user to remember your 
domain instead of writing a long, complex URL. In addition, note that a display URL has a character limit.

the estimated price, your ad will not appear in a competitive position in the Search Network or the 
Display Network. Choosing the right keywords and estimated bids are very important to maximize the 
exposure of the ad group.

What are the different ad group types?
You can create multiple types of ad groups. Most common are text ads and image ads, where you upload a 
standard size image and use it instead of a text ad. Image ads are only available in campaigns that support 
the Display Network. The Specialized search ad lets you target Google images and YouTube videos. This type is 
useful for targeting clients who depend on images and video in their search. The WAP (Wireless Application 
Protocol) mobile ad targets mobile devices, such as iPhones, and technology. The Product listing ad helps you 
promote a product, and the Dynamic search ad displays an ad based on the website content.

T
he Keyword tool is one of the essential features that can help SEO experts find the rank of 
keywords and understand its search volume, which indicates how many users type these keywords 
in the search query. Understanding search volume for specific keyword can help you to know which 
keyword you should optimize in the website content and the best combination of keywords to use. In 
order to search for specific keyword rank, you need to add one or more keywords to the words area, 
the URL, and category. You can also set the target location, language, and devices.

How do I use the Keyword Tool in SEO?
When you are creating content for your website or optimizing it for search engines, you have to choose the 
best keyword or group of keywords to focus on to help improve your website’s rank in the search engine 
results page (SERP). The Keyword Tool can give you an idea about the best keywords to use in your website. 
The high search volume means that there are many users who search for this keyword on Google. The 
competition level refers to the number of advertisers that bid on the keyword in AdWords. The Keyword Tool 
can give you ideas about other similar keywords that you can add to your website to increase its search 
engine ranking.

Applying SEO to 
WordPress Blogs
Content Management Systems (CMS) are server-side platforms that allow 
you to build your website and add content easily using Graphic User 
Interface (GUI) elements such as text editors. WordPress is a commonly 
used CMS because it is easy to use and search engine friendly. You can 
use WordPress to create blogs, websites, and simple e-commerce stores.

lthough WordPress was originally a blogging CMS, it is now used to build corporate websites and 
e-commerce stores. You can either use www.wordpress.com to build a free blog where you can get 
free hosting and a blog name or you can install WordPress on your own server by following the steps 
outlined in this link: http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress. Installing WordPress requires 
that you know how to set up domain names and servers. Each WordPress website has an admin page 
where you can add content, change the website layout, or add features and functions. WordPress is 
based on the PHP (Hypertext Processor) programming language that is used to create dynamic web pages.
Understanding WordPress CMS
WordPress Themes
The website or blog design in WordPress depends on 
themes. These are groups of images, PHP files, and 
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files used to create the 
graphical style for the website menus, forms, and 
other features. You can upload the themes to the 
server in the folder /wp-content/themes/. To apply 
the uploaded theme, you activate it from the Themes 
section in the WordPress admin page. The layout of 
the website or blog plays an important role in SEO 
optimization; it has to be clear and ensure that the 
content loads easily. It can be difficult for search engine spiders to crawl large files. Further, the layout 
should be user friendly, display the content in the top portion of the page, and have balance between text 
and images. A wide variety of WordPress themes are available on the web for free as well as for a fee. You 
can find free themes in the WordPress Directory at www.wordpress.org/extend/themes.
WordPress Plugins
WordPress plugins are a group of PHP-based files that 
add features and functions to WordPress websites or 
blogs. Unlike themes, plugins include functions such 
as contact forms, social media buttons, and more. 
Different types of plugins can optimize your 
WordPress website with just a few clicks. There are 
two methods for installing plugins. The first one is to 
search for the plugin and install it directly from the 
Plugins section on the admin page, and the second 
one is to upload the plugin folder to /wp-content/
themes/ on the WordPress website server, and enable the plugins from the admin page. Use plugins wisely 
because they include a lot of code, which can make a site slower than normal. You can find a huge number 
of plugins in WordPress Plugin Directory at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugin.

235
CHAPTER

Applying SEO to WordPress Blogs
WordPress and SEO
WordPress is one of the common CMSs that works 
well with the SEO process. The WordPress site page 
and archive structure lends itself to optimal content 
crawling. Also, it is easy to customize each page or 
post URL to include important keywords for indexing, 
which are known as permalinks. If you choose an 
SEO-friendly theme, it can aid optimization for your 
website. WordPress plugins play a significant role in optimizing websites, with an array of different plugins 
to help you optimize content as well as files. Also, you can customize settings for comments and pingbacks 
to help increase the content optimization. Pingbacks occur when your website links to a specific site and 
sends updates to the site about the link.
WordPress Widgets
WordPress widgets are comments sections that you 
can add to the WordPress sidebar and footer areas. 
These widgets can include different features, such as 
recent posts, related posts, ad spaces, and social 
icons. You can add widgets to either the sidebar or 
the footer from the Widgets link in the Appearance 
section on the admin page. In this link, you will find 
many widgets that you can drag and drop to available areas in your blog or website. Not only are widgets 
easy to use, but also you can use them to increase the number of internal links on your home page, which 
can affect page rank and page views. Also, you can use them to display categories for the website content.
WordPress Content
Content is an essential part of WordPress websites and 
you need to optimize it in order to appear in search 
engine results. You can add content to WordPress 
easily as posts or pages. Posts are content updates that 
you can add to your website every day, and they are 
archived on the blog home page. Pages contain static 
content that you do not change regularly, such as 
contact information and the company information. You can use the text editor in WordPress to format content 
and headings to meet with SEO guidelines. The content can be arranged in tags or categories, which are 
classified for your website content. Tags are keywords that you add to each post and you include the important 
keywords in each post or page.

Install the W3 Total Cache Plugin
W
ebsite or blog loading speed is an essential factor in SEO. Ample speed can help search engine 
crawlers index more pages in less time, whereas with slow websites, crawlers may skip slow 
content. The W3 Total Cache Plugin is one of the plugins that you can install on WordPress and 
configure to create caches or recorded files from the website on the server. This means the user can 
access static site information without needing to load it again. This cached version of the website 
files can help speed content loading and result in a lighter network or bandwidth traffic load.

TIPS
What is caching?
Caching is a method for storing files. The cached 
data can be HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and images. 
With a cached version of a website, the website 
loading speed increases because the server does not 
have to generate dynamic files for each user’s visit. 
Instead, the user views the cached data unless there 
is an update to the website.
How can I uninstall a plugin?
You can remove any plugin from your website 
through the WordPress admin page. Under the 
Plugins section, locate the plugin in the list and 
click Deactivate to remove it from the website. 
Then remove the plugin folder or files from the 
server through the FTP client that is used to upload 
the website files to the server.

plugin, extract its compressed file, and upload the plugin folder to /wp-content/plugins/. Then, go to 
Plugins in the admin page and activate the plugin from the new Plugins list. When you install the W3 
Total Cache, it creates a number of files and folders in the plugins folder or in the wp-content folder.

What are alternatives to the W3 Total Cache plugin?
In addition to the W3 Total Cache, there are other caching plugins that you can use to improve your 
website’s loading speed. The WP Super Cache is a common plugin that is simple to use. It is less complex 
than the W3 Total Cache plugin. However, it has the disadvantage that when you uninstall it, it does not 
leave remaining files on the server as the W3 Total Cache does. You can download it from the WordPress 
admin or from http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/. Also, you can use Hyper Cache, which 
is a new caching plugin that can greatly improve your website’s speed. You can download this plugin from 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hyper-cache/.

A
fter installing the W3 Total Cache, it is important to configure it correctly in order to get the 
most out of it. Configuring the W3 Total Cache lets you set up the server files cache, minifying 
JavaScript and CSS files, which means you make them smaller and faster to load. Also, it allows you 
to configure the Content Delivery Network (CDN) that copies the server files onto servers from various 
locations so they reach users more quickly. The configuration process is pretty easy; you choose 
configuration options that allow server file caching.

What is the Content Delivery Network?
The Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a number of distributed servers that are located in different places. 
These servers are known as data centers and are used to multiply data on the Internet. When a user visits 
a website with CDN service enabled, the CDN delivers the content to the user from the nearest available 
data center. This can increase the availability of content and website performance, especially for websites 
that receive a lot of traffic or deliver large-size media files, such as live streaming media, videos, and 
applications. Usually, the website owner pays for the CDN service based on the bandwidth users request 
from the CDN data centers.

minify options, database cache options, browser cache options, and CDN information that you 
can set by integrating the website with a CDN provider. If you are not familiar with the advanced 
options, you can simply set the plugins’ general information, which is good enough to improve your

How do I integrate CDN with W3 Total Cache?
To use the CDN service on your website, use a caching plugin such as W3 Total Cache. You can register your 
website with the CDN provider to receive an API ID, API Key, and host name. API is the Application 
programming Interface that is used to link your server with the CDN service. This host name replaces the 
current path for all your website files. You need to enable the CDN from the W3 Total Cache setting and set 
it to use the desired CDN services. Then, you can access the CDN settings and add the API information to 
the required fields.

help you customize how WordPress generates the URLs for the new posts once you publish them. 
Instead of using numbers, you can set up WordPress to display the post title, category, or publishing 
date. You can access the Permalinks from the WordPress General Settings page and customize how 
you want the post and page URLs to appear.

TIPS
Which is the best Permalinks setting for SEO?
The URLs are important factors in post indexing. 
They should include the important keywords in your 
post. So, it is best to set the /%postname%/ post 
name for permalinks if you want to add it to the 
custom field. This option sets the URL like the post 
title, but separated by dashes.
Will the Permalinks updates apply to the 
old posts?
Yes, when you change the Permalinks from numbers 
to the post name or other options, old archived 
posts are updated as well. To confirm this, check 
the URLs of older posts and see how they have 
changed.

Your Website
The main reason for SEO is to get more traffic and a higher ranking for 
your website. This traffic turns to potential customers for your product 
or service. Also, visitors can click advertising banners and promotional

W
hile you can direct traffic that comes to your website toward buying a product or service, 
some websites, particularly magazines and blogs, earn revenue other ways. One is to include 
advertising spots that promote other sites and services. These spots can be banners, video, text 
links, or specific articles on your website, such as product reviews. When building your website, 
you have to consider how to earn revenue from your website or blog and the different types of 
advertisements that you can place within the website structure. With strategic planning, you can 
monetize your website, maximizing your profits.

Cost Per Click
In this revenue model, the user clicks an advertising text link or banner, such as an image, text, or video. 
The advertiser pays the website owner each time users click the mouse and visit the advertiser’s product or 
service website. The Cost Per Click (CPC) varies based on many factors, such as the type of visitors coming to 
the website and website competitors. For example, you can set the cost of a banner click at thirty cents 
each time a visitor clicks this banner, the advertiser pays you this amount of money. This model does not 
include how the visitor interacts with the advertiser’s product or website; the payment process is complete 
once the user clicks the banner. Usually, this model is suitable for websites of all sizes that would like to 
generate revenue from advertising. Visitors with the potential to click banners on your site have the 
potential to click other links on your site, which can lead to possible revenue. Ad providers such as Google 
AdSense, Yahoo Publisher Network, and Facebook handle the CPC campaigns for your website.
Cost Per Mille
The Cost Per Mille (CPM), or the cost per thousand, impressions model refers to the cost that an advertiser 
pays a website owner to display the advertiser’s banner on the website owner’s site to visitors a thousand 
times. For example, an advertiser pays you to display his banner for a number of website users regardless 
of whether they click the banner or not; these displays are known as banner impressions. These impressions 
do not include actions such as refreshing the page from the user’s browser. Therefore, if you sell 1,000 
impressions on your website for $2 and the advertiser buys 10,000 impressions, he will pay a total of $20 to 
you for displaying the banner to 10,000 of your website visitors. CPM is most profitable if your website 
receives a lot of traffic or page views because you can sell large numbers of impressions to different 
advertisers, and use rotating ads methods to display multiple ads in the same advertising area. CPM ad 
providers include Facebook and BuySellAds that deliver advertising banners to your website.

CHAPTER

Monetizing Your Website
Cost Per Action
The Cost Per Action (CPA) is commonly used by advertising networks and it refers to an advertising 
campaign that pays you when your website visitors click the advertiser’s banner, which links them to the 
advertiser’s site, and then conducts a specific process. This process can be buying a product from the 
advertiser’s store, which is known as Cost Per Sale (CPS), or it can be completing a form to sign up for a 
service or information or completing a survey page, which is known as Cost Per Lead (CPL). Most affiliate 
marketing campaigns are based on this model: they only pay the website owner once visitors respond to the 
ad by buying a product or completing a form or survey. If your website is new and does not have much 
potential traffic, you will not be able to generate good revenue from this type of ad. You first must build 
trust with website visitors in order for them to click links on your website and trust the products being 
advertised.
Fixed-Price Banners
The fixed-price banner model means the advertiser pays a fixed amount for placing their banners on your 
website for a period of time that is usually one month or more. In this case, the cost is paid in advance 
regardless of the number of clicks or impressions the banner receives. The more clicks the banner receives, 
the greater the possibility that the advertisers renew their banner placements for additional months. The 
advertisers choose which websites to place their ads on based on a number of factors, such as the amount 
of traffic the website receives, the category of the website, and the impressions that each page receives. 
The fixed-price model is one of the easiest advertising models because you do not need to join an 
advertising network to implement it; all you need to do is contact advertisers and invite them to advertise 
on your website. There are some networks, such as BuySellAds, that help you market your website banner 
zones and provide easy management platform for your banners.
Effective Cost Per Mille
While the Cost Per Mille (CPM) equals the display of a banner a thousand times to clients, the Effective Cost 
Per Mille (eCPM) refers to the action a user takes after clicking the banner. The eCPM is calculated by 
dividing the total earnings by the total number of impressions in thousands. For example, if an advertiser 
earns $3 from users’ actions, and the ad appears 1,000 times, the formula for calculating the eCPM is 
$3/1,000 *1,000 where 1,000 is constant, and the results of the Cost-Per-Click in this model is $3.

Y
ou can choose from a variety of web advertisement formats when choosing the ads that will 
appear on your website. Each ad format can have a different impact on the website visitors. You 
may notice that users click a specific ad format more than the others. Subsequently, you can test 
each format and decide which is best for your website based on the number of user clicks and overall 
traffic responding to the ad format. Generally, the ad format is an image, text, video, or specific 
HTML page that appears before displaying the targeted website or a new web page for the advertiser.
Consider the Advertising Formats
Text Ads
Text ads are text-based hyperlinks on 
your website that advertisers buy, and 
when visitors click them, they go to the 
advertiser’s website. Text ads do not 
include graphical images but sometimes 
include text descriptions that appear 
under the main link. Text ads are sold 
directly to the advertiser by the website 
owner or through ad networks such as 
AdSense.
Image Ads
Image ads, or display ads, are ad banners 
that use graphic images instead of text 
links. Image ads are available in several 
standard sizes. While you can create 
banners without restricting them to 
standard sizes, it is recommended you 
follow the standard dimensions so you 
create banner areas that are suitable for 
different customers. Image ads attract 
the visitor’s eyes to a banner, often 
leading them to click it.

Flash Ads
Flash ads refer to banners that use Flash 
technology to create animated ads and 
motion graphics. Flash ads are more 
attractive than the ordinary still images 
or text ads. However, they do not appear 
in smartphone and tablet devices that 
do not support Flash, which makes this 
format undesirable for clients targeting 
smartphone and tablet users. Alternatively, 
some clients use HTML5 animated ads as a substitution for Flash ads because it viewable on smartphones and 
devices that do not support Flash.
E-mail Ads
With the increase in the value of 
e-mail marketing, many advertisers are 
considering sponsoring e-mail newsletters 
as a marketing method for their products. 
This is done by sending e-mail newsletters 
that advise users to use a specific product 
or service. Also, the e-mail ads can list 
advertiser services or products with a link 
to purchase it. A popular directory is the 
Yahoo Directory at http://dir.yahoo.com.
Video Ads
As the Internet speeds increase, making 
it easier to use rich media such as video, 
many advertisers create video ads to 
attract users and deliver direct, 
interactive messages. However, it is not 
recommended you use a video ad more 
than once on a website page; otherwise 
it may cause the page to load slowly and 
distract the website visitor.

one ad in the same advertising spot. The other is image ads, which are image banners with still and 
animated images. While the image ads are more attractive, each AdSense spot includes only one ad. 
This can narrow your chances of getting clicks on the ad banner.

How can I determine if text ads or image ads are better?
Choosing to display text ads, image ads, or both depends on how each type of ad performs on your website. 
The standard choice is to allow both image and text ads in the AdSense zone. But in some cases, you may 
notice that website visitors click specific types of ads more than others. Subsequently, you get more 
revenue from one particular type. The best practice is to test all the types of AdSense ads on your website 
and choose the one that best suits your website content and audience.

banners and is added to your website HTML code 
just after the opening <body> tag. You can add 
the second code snippet in the place where you 
would like the ad zone to display.

How can I determine the best SEO based on cost?
While many SEO companies are very expensive due 
to their reputation and clients, you can still find 
good SEO companies that are more affordable. To 
lower your costs, you must know what your website 
needs and then ask for the specific SEO options 
only; for example, you can request quotes for link 
building.
Where can I find other good SEO companies?
You can find suggestions for the best SEO 
companies to use on SEO forums that cover 
optimization topics; for example, https://forums.
digitalpoint.com and www.webmasterworld.com. If 
you are a paid subscriber of the Warrior Forum 
(www.warriorforum.com), you can receive 
professional SEO advice.

What are Elance contractors?
When you sign up in Elance for the first time, you will have to choose whether you want to create an 
account to find a job or hire others for your own projects. The experts that you hire for the job are called 
contractors, and can be either individuals or companies. Contractor profiles will help you determine if the 
contractor is a person or a company. Some people prefer to hire an individual person, because they can 
follow the work more closely and contact one person directly, whereas often with a company, a technical 
person is not provided as a contact.

What is the difference between an hourly and a fixed rate?
There are two payment models in Elance as well as most other freelance websites. The first payment model 
is the hourly rate, which refers to paying the contractor based on the number of hours that she works. With 
this method, you have to monitor the contractor to make sure that the hours she works match the amount 
of work completed and the money spent. The second payment model is the fixed cost, where you pay a set 
amount of money for a specific job. With this method, you do not pay for each hour. Instead, you pay for 
the whole project at once.

Hire an SEO Expert on oDesk
O
desk is another online workplace website that connects you with different experts and service 
buyers around the world, including ones in SEO and web marketing services. oDesk allows you to 
search for contractors among their huge database or you can post a job contractors can apply for. It 
has a wide database of users because it is free and it does not require payments from contractors. 
Instead it takes a 10 percent charge from the contractor’s rate or the job revenue if it is a fixed rate 
job. When you search online for SEO help, it is wise to consider various online workspace websites; 
this way you can find the best, and most reliable, contractors.

What is the oDesk Team application?
Buyers can use the oDesk Team application to track how far along a contractor is on the job. The tool 
records the contractor’s progress using screenshots of the contractor’s screen that are taken every few 
minutes. Then, you can preview these information through the Work Diary next to your current jobs’ list. 
Also, once the employer reviews and approves a contractor’s hours for the week, payments can be issued 
automatically. This tool helps give both employers and contractors confidence that the project is on track, 
enabling them to focus on the work process instead of payment and time-related issues.

Yahoo, and MSN chat applications; and conference applications such as Adobe Connect and WebEx.

What is the workload rate?
The workload rate refers to the number of hours that the contractor needs to work during the week. Many 
contractors have other job obligations. You need to include the estimated workload in order to give the 
contractor a clear vision of your project. The workload varies from task to task, especially in the SEO 
process. Most SEO tasks require the contractor to check your website over several days to follow up with the 
changes, so you have to account for this as well.

T
he SEO process is complex and requires you to do a lot of small tasks on a regular basis until you 
achieve your target results. Therefore, it is important to manage the workflow for these tasks well, 
especially when there is a team helping you. Many project management tools help you keep up-to-
date with your team’s progress. One of these free, comprehensive tools is Freedcamp, which allows 
you to create multiple projects and add tasks to each one. It also allows you to invite team members 
to work on projects and manage them through the Freedcamp platform.

What is the different between online and desktop project management tools?
Online tools are project management applications that team members can access online without needing to 
install them on their desktop computers. This can enable members to manage a project from different 
places and devices. With the online tools, you do not have to buy a license for your team; instead you can 
use the free versions of project management tools or purchase monthly subscriptions. Alternatively, the 
desktop tools are more complex and hard to use with remote teams where members work from various 
places. Desktop applications that provide free project management include Gantt Project (www.ganttproject.
biz). and 2-plan (http://2-plan.com).

reed Camp projects give you the option to install modules known as applications. These 
applications are tools such as the To-dos list that allows you to create tasks and assign these 
tasks to experts on your team. The Discussions module enables you to discuss the project with the 
team and archive these discussions; and you use Milestones to schedule important dates in the 
delivery timeline for the project. You can also upload files up to 20MB and share them, and you can 
upgrade your account to get more storage space.

TIPS
What is the project group?
The project group allows you to view multiple 
projects under one group. When you view the 
projects in the Choose Project drop-down list, you 
will find similar projects grouped together. You can 
use the groups feature to arrange different SEO 
projects; for example, if you are running the same 
SEO campaign on different projects, you can group 
them by SEO campaign.
What are the Freedcamp widgets?
In addition to the applications that you can install 
for each project, you can create widgets that 
appear on your personal dashboard. For example, 
you can create a widget that displays a calendar for 
a specific project or all your projects. You can also 
create widgets such as To-dos, Activity, Bug Tracker, 
and Milestones.
