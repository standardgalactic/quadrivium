Throughout this spreading E-Book you will discover spreading methods which 
are used by many and some unique which I will go into detail with and 
describe fully to get the most out of each method that is going to be used, 
with this E-Book you should have gotten a ‘Tools’ folder with it which 
includes items and information to help you complete the methods thoroughly. 
With all these methods of spreading you can easily get 100 Bots/Installs 
every hour and even 200 after you get more experience with them. I have 
experience with these methods and have applied them myself in various 
situations and understand what is needed to use them to there full potential. 
I have been using these methods for over a year now and have never met 
people who had used one of these methods effectively before which are why 
some of them were even more effective because they were used by few. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
I have been researching, buying and investing into many spreading methods 
over the last year and I going to explain and show the best one I have found, 
one that suits me and all my customers, with this method you can accumulate 
100 installs within 1 hour very reasonably if you follow this method and if you 
stick to it for the whole hour, that’s right 100 installs, not just downloads, 
the downfall is that this method is manual but can get you 100 installs of 
anything in an hour which could lead to money making methods such as selling 
bots, selling accounts you have gained using this method or many other 
possibilities and if applied throughout a day you can have 2400 installs in day 
one. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Let’s begin shall we 
 
In this method we are going to be using yahoo messenger to get installs, this 
is good as they have chat rooms and are a very big company so thousands of 
people use there service to chat everyday, with these chat rooms you get 
people who chat with you just for signing in so it makes it much easier to get 
installs if there coming to you. If this method doesn’t work on someone then 
that doesn’t matter, there are plenty more fish in the sea to get installs on. 
 
First Step 
We are going to sign up for a yahoo email address which would be appealing 
to people in chat rooms A.K.A we are going to have a girly ID and attract 
guys as this has been the easiest method to get 100 installs an hour but feel 
free to use your own type of ID but I wouldn’t recommend it. To register go 
to http://mail.yahoo.com and select ‘Create new account’ as shown below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

You will then get a sign up screen to fill in all your details, this is pretty 
much self explanatory just fill in all the details needed which can be fake or 
real but should likely be fake as there is no reason to put real details down. 
An example of this is show below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Make the ID A.K.A the email address appear as if you’re a girl so choose 
something along the lines of what I use which is ‘LittleMissSexy’ or 
something more common like ‘Megan_1991’ as this gets the point across that 
you’re a girl but also says your age which would attract more attention but 
make sure the ID isn’t to obvious like ‘huge****’ because they might think 
you’re a bot like one or two of them on yahoo also. Once this is done click 
‘create my account’, this is now the login for your yahoo messenger to get 
installs. 
 

Second Step 
 
You now need to download yahoo messenger which can be downloaded from 
this link: http://messenger.yahoo.com, if you decide not to use this link or it 
doesn’t work then you do a simple Google search for it but make sure it is 
the US version because sometimes If you download other versions such as 
the UK one you don’t get the chat room feature installed. To get passed this 
either download it of a .com link or delete your old yahoo messenger in 
control panel first then ‘Google’ yahoo messenger and make sure you click a 
US .com link and not your home country link unless it’s the US of course. 
Here’s what it should look like 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Click Download Now 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Third Step 
 
The third step is to prepare your server you are spreading and getting 
installs for, because if we were to send a raw server then people wouldn’t 
download it, not that I haven’t seen people do it, you can actually get quite a 
few installs an hour without even crypting, disguising, changing name etc but 
if you forget all 3 then you will get next to no installs so you need to prepare 
your server. The first step of preparing your server is to crypt your server 
so that it shows as having no virus which many people do for free on 
www.hackforums.net under service sections but this depends on your server 
because some servers can be ruined when being crypted so that is your 
responsibility to make sure it can be used after crypting, keep searching 
there is usually a way to crypt most things which could possibly lead to costs. 
Just test your server after crypting to make sure it works. When you have a 
working crypted server or whatever you’re spreading then you will have to 
change the icon of the server to make it look like an image file so it is more 
believable and more likely to get installs. There are many ways to change the 
icon of a server which can be found by searching hackforums.net. Here is a 
very trusted method a lot of people use including me when spreading on 
yahoo. You will need to download ‘resource hacker’ from here: 
http://delphi.icm.edu.pl/ftp/tools/ResHack.zip but if this link cannot be 
accessed then Google “resource hacker” and click the first link, when the 
first link has been clicked then scroll down the resource hacker page and 
click one of the images with a hammer leading to download resource hacker. 
Once you have download Resource Hacker you will need to get a JPG icon 
looking like this 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

This can be found in the folder ‘Tools’ > ‘JPG’ I sent along inside the tools 
folder. Now open Resource Hacker and open your server by clicking file then 
open or CTRL+O 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and then selecting your server. Now when you have opened up your server 
click the + on the left next to the sub-heading saying ‘Icon’, when this 
expands you then right click on the new field that has just appeared and 
then click ‘Replace Resource’. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A new box will appear click on ‘Open file with new icon’ in the new box and 
select the JPG icon which came with the download of this E-Book. After this 
just close the box and file>save in the main resource hacker menu and close 
the whole of Resource hacker. Now you have just changed the icon of your 
server into a believable image and the hard part is now done and it only gets 
easier from here and soon you will have thousands off installs. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The next part is just simply changing the name of the file to a more 
believable one and preparing your server is done. After you are done with 
Resource hacker you will have two files, one is ‘server.exe’ and the other is 
‘server_original.exe’ (obviously ‘server’ is replaced with whatever you named 
your server). We only need the ‘server.exe’ as it is the one which is updated 
with the new icon. We need to re-name ‘server.exe’ to something more 
believable like ‘IMG0947.scr’, the change to ‘IMG0947’ is more believable as 
an image or something along the lines of ‘Janet 19th Nov 2009.scr’ also notice 
the change in the type of file instead of ‘.exe’ I change it to “.scr” which will 
need to be done. When the file extension is changed to ‘.scr’ it runs the same 
as a ‘.exe’ but if it were a ‘.jpg’ your server wouldn’t run. When ‘.scr’ is there 
it shows as a screensaver which makes a more believable image and more 
likely for people to open as your pretending to be a girl. Sometimes you can’t 
see the file extensions such as ‘.exe’, ‘.scr’ or ‘.jpg’ because they are hidden 
so can’t be changed, to alter this on windows vista click on the “organise” tab 
then click ‘folder and search options’ when it appears. A new box should open 
up click the view tab at the top of the new box and then scroll down till you 
sea the ‘hide extension for known file types’ option, make sure it is 
unchecked so that you can see the file extensions which you need to change 
to ‘.scr’ then click ‘ok’ at the bottom of the box and you can now follow the 
steps above to get the desired file extension. To do this in windows xp or 
other operating systems is basically the same method but some buttons to  
 

change the folder options may be in different places, so to get the folder 
options in different operating systems just do a simple Google Search. 
 
Here is what it change into: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fourth Step 
 
Now that your server is completely disguised as an image and is virus ‘free’, 
now we can get on with the spreading. Open up yahoo messenger and type in 
the details to the account you registered above. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before 
After 

Now that you are signed in with the girly ID you will now need to enter chat 
rooms by clicking file>yahoo chat>join a room. Now it is your choice to pick 
which room you would want to join but aim yourself towards rooms with 
horny guys for example:  
 
Anything in the Romance Section 
Regional>India 
              United States 
              United Kingdom 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

You will be prompted with a captcha to enter the room, enter the captcha 
but don’t join the just yet, you will need to right click and copy your server 
so that you can paste it repeatedly and quickly to get loads of installs. Once 
you have done that then return to the captcha screen and click join room. 
Within a couple of seconds you will get loads of IM’s. You will want to get as 
much information needed to them as quick as possible but done well enough 
so that they install your server.  
 
Here is a picture of me just joining a room and within 5 seconds…. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Four isn’t that much but I just joined when it was 4am there just for the E-
Book quickly 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

To do this I send them this message below typed up really quickly then paste 
my server and add on at the end “how is it” (as in how’s the file I just sent?) 
but only send “how is it” If they accept it, I put how is it or “did you like it” 
to make sure they open the file. 
 
“19 F KY, Kelly, Student 
Pic: 
(Paste my Server using Control+V) 
How is it?” 
 
Here’s an Example of this before and after 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before
After

If they ask any questions then answer them reasonably and repeat what you 
typed before for example 
 
You: 19 F KY, Kelly, Student 
Pic: 
(Paste server using Control+V) 
Them: What’s the picture of? 
You: it’s a picture of me 
You: 19 F KY, Kelly, Student 
Pic: 
(Paste server using Control+V) 
How is it? (Only put how is it if they accept) 
 
Eventually after doing this method many times you can apply your own 
methods and you will know what works best for you and what doesn’t. You will 
need to repeat this method to anyone who IM’s you. With this method I can 
usually get an acceptance rate of 5:3 so 5 out of every 8 people I talk to 
installs my server. If they ever decline your download then I usually just 
click “ignore them” as they are likely a waste of time and there are too many 
people out there who are willing to install just to look at my ‘image’. 
 
And that is how I spread my files in which I can get around 300 Installs 
within 2 hours (this is obviously after a lot of experience) which you can 
reach also after a couple of days of learning how to answer questions, know 
what to say to weird questions and know some of your own chat lines through 
your experience with horny guys. 
 
This is the end of the Yahoo Spreading Guide! Go on and spread as much as 
you can but here is a final word from me and some tips: 
 
Hopefully you can be as successful at spreading as me and you can make 
money of it by starting a spreading service, selling bots or use your server 
for PTC but under no circumstances will you re-distribute, re-sell or leach 
this guide innless you have paid for Resell rights of me (Tyler Durden). Also 
you can always or contact me on hackforums.net by PMing me and I will 
respond ASAP. 
 
 

 
Some Final Tips 
 
• The Ignore button is a great tool, use it every time someone hasn’t 
downloaded your file within 1 minute as you have many other people 
that would want to download it. 
• If someone asks you what a ‘.scr’ file is then say it is a ‘screen image’, 
I also like to say it means that it will show a slideshow of me but 
always say that it will open as a regular file. 
• If they want to share the photo in photo share, just simply say you 
have an old yahoo and you can only send pictures. 
• If you are getting no IM’s then go to the Main chat room and type in 
‘anyone wanna chat’ and you should get a healthy amount of IM’s if you 
keep repeating this when empty on IM’s, also switching rooms is good 
if no IM’s are being received. 
• Make smart spreading decisions by finding out by simple Google 
searches the peak time of when people are on the internet and what 
time it is in other countries, by doing this you can then decide which 
room would be best to join for installs. 
• Prepare what you are going to type up really fast and try to send your 
‘server’ as much as you can to them, so that you don’t go into deep 
discussion with them and stay on topic with the download. 
• Never add them as contacts otherwise they will keep pestering you 
every time you come on. 
 
Good Luck Guys 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
This method is very effective and isn’t manual so you can do other things 
while you spread using this method. With this method you can accumulate 
about 50-100 installs everyday or even more depending on what type of 
torrent, how many and how long they are up for without being detected, 
without even being next to your computer. 
 
Let’s begin shall we 
 
This method as you can tell consists of uploading torrents which include your 
server you are trying to spread and getting other people to download them 
and run them. The reason this works so well is that people believe they are 
downloading a virus free program for free that would usually cost quite a lot 
of money in the shops. What actually happens is that they do get the 
programs for free but they also open up your server without knowing 
depending on what type of server you have and if it is crypted/virus free. 
 
Step one 
 
The first thing you will want to do is crypt your server/bot. Crypting is the 
process of scrambling data in your server so that it doesn’t show up as a 
virus to anti-virus’s. To do this you can easily buy a crypter from websites 
such as Hackforums.net or get someone to do it for free at HackForums.net 
under the service section of the website. You will need a crypted server for 
this to work other wise it breaks the method greatly. Now make sure your 
server is crypted by going to http://scanner.novirusthanks.org/ and 
selecting then submitting your server, make sure ‘do not distribute the 
sample’ is checked and wait for your results. If everything is fine you should 
get 0/? CLEAN like shown below. 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Step 2 
 
You have just crypted your server, what you will need to do now is to get 
programs to bind your server to, to make it something people want and want 
to open. Binding is when two files join together and are both find at the 
same time. We will run both the server and the downloaded program at the 
same time but the server will remain hidden when opening so your victim is 
infected with it without knowing specially if your server is crypted. 
 
To get the programs you can do various things. You will need to find 
something people are really wanting, good examples of this include 
Photoshop, Adobe CS?, and keygens. These are good examples because they 
are in high demand and will be opened by many. The keygens are especially 
good because they are not big files so that lowers the risk of someone 
cancelling the download because of it taking too long to download. Good 
Places to find the downloads are Warez or the pirate bay. I would personally 
download from warez as you check whether or not they good via the replies. 
The pirate bay is good also as you can check which program is being 
downloaded most which means more people have checked it thoroughly and 
know it doesn’t have viruses. 
 
First I will show you which downloads are good from the pirate bay. To do 
this you need to visit http://thepiratebay.org/top/301 this shows the Top 
100 download windows applications on the pirate bay. If you can’t click the 
link then search ‘pirate bay’ on Google and click the first link then when on 
the home page click on ‘Top 100’ and on the page after that click on 
‘Windows’ under ‘applications’. From there you decide programs are best to 
download. Try and make sure they are small, in demand and aren’t stupid, For 
example you don’t want to bind it to an anti-virus or keylogger. Here is a 
selection I would pick from below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The download these you will need a torrent downloader, uTorrent is the best 
one to use in my opinion and only take a couple of seconds to install. Go to 
http://www.utorrent.com/ and click the big green download button and ‘run’ 
the program and then follow the installation instructions. If the link isn’t 
working Googling ‘uTorrent’ and clicking the first link should bring you to the 
home page and then follow the instruction above when there. When that is 
done just click the button (looking like the one below) under the download 
name. 
 
 
You will be prompted with a ‘run’ ‘save’ screen, just run the torrent in 
uTorrent and wait for it to download. To locate the download just right click 
the download and click ‘Open Containing folder’ like below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Now I will show you how to repeat the process in warez. To go to warez 
simple Google ‘warez bb’ and click the first link that appears or click here 
http://www.warez-bb.org/ , then when on the page click on the ‘apps’ section 
to view all the programs to download and bind. Before you can look at the 
apps you will need to register by clicking ‘register’ near the top of the home 
page. Once registered and in the ‘Apps’ section there will appear to be man 
programs available, the ones with many replies are what you are looking for 
as they have thanks or good replies from people and hasn’t been deleted for 
bad reasons. To download these ones just click on the link and follow the 
download instructions within the link and locate where you have saved it. 
Make sure what you download is an ‘.exe’ program. Here is what I would pick 
out of the selection below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These are good because they are ‘.exe’’s and have many replies which are 
good. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Step 3 
In step 3 we will need to join both the file you downloaded off the websites 
(pirate bay or warez) and your server, so that when the victim runs the 
overall file they think they have installed a virus free program successfully 
without knowing they also ran your server. 
 
You will need to use a binder which can be found at hackforums.net through 
various searches for free or you can use a tool already integrated into 
windows called ‘iExpress’, I will show you how to bind using iExpress. 
 
To open up iExpress click on ‘start’ in the bottom left corner of your screen. 
Then click ‘search’ or click in the search box. 
Type and search for ‘Run’, when ‘Run’ appears click on it. 
Type in run ‘iExpress’ and hit enter 
 
This will bring up the iExpress. To use iExpress to bind files use the 
pictured tutorial below. 
 
Copy everything I do below using with your own files and change the settings 
to mine, a red box means you click there. 
 
• Click Next 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

• Then click next 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Then press the spacebar inside the white box and click next 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Press the space bar in here and leave it 

• Then click next 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Then click next again 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

• Then click the ‘add’ button and add your crypted server and program 
you downloaded to the list and then click next. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Now select your server as the ‘install program’ and your Program you 
downloaded as your ‘Post install program’ then click next 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

• After that select ‘Hidden’ so that your victim doesn’t know they are 
infected. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Then press next and make sure ‘no message’ is checked 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

• Now you need to pick where you need to save your new binded file and 
pick what you want to call it, make it look like the program you 
downloaded. Then tick the option ‘Hide file extracting progress 
animation from user’ so that the victim can’t see it being extracted 
and click next 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Choose ‘no restart’ and click next 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

• Select ‘don’t save’ then next 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Click next  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

• And finally click ‘finish’ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The final file is wherever you saved it. 
 
Step 4 
 
In step 4 we will be disguising your new file which is a combination of the 
program you downloaded and your server by changing the icon and name of it. 
To do this you will need ‘resource hacker’ which can be located in the tutorial 
above (the yahoo messenger spreading method). 
 
Let’s say ‘keygen.exe’ is the file I downloaded and ‘binded file.exe’ is the two 
programs binded together. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

As you can see ‘binded file.exe’ doesn’t look as good and believable as 
‘keygen.exe’, so we are going to have to make ‘binded file.exe’ look like 
‘keygen.exe’ so people download and install it. 
 
To do this we will open up resource hacker and click file->open and open up 
the ‘keygen.exe’ (your downloaded file), then find ‘version info’ on the left 
panel and if it is there then click the ‘+’ next to it and the ‘+’ that comes out 
of that one. Then select/click on ‘1053’ or whatever you have and text will 
show on the right, then right click anywhere inside that text and then click 
‘select all’ when it appears and right click again, then select ‘copy’ but if you 
get no ‘version info’ appearing just leave it for now. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Now open up you binded file in resource hacker. Repeat the same procedure 
as before and get to ’1053’ and instead of copying, just paste it. So now you 
have pasted all the version info from the program file to the binded file. If 
you never got version info to appear before then (right click 1053 ->delete 
resource-> yes) 
 
Now that you have pasted the new info, click on compile script which is seen 
above. Then click ‘action’ then ‘repace icon’. A new box should appear, click 

‘open file with new icon’ then find the file you downloaded (the one from 
warez or pirate bay) and open it in resource hacker. Once opened you should 
return to the previous box, in which you will click ‘replace’ if any errors come 
up just accept them because the process still works even with errors. After 
this you should be back to the resource hacker main screen, in which you 
should file -> save it. Make sure when saving you name it the same as the 
original download. When you have the final file with the different name, the 
icon should be the same as the download. If the icon hasn’t changed just 
refresh the page a couple of times and it should. 
 
Now you should have a binded file which runs your server and looks like it is 
running a program set-up and looks believable also because it has the same 
icon and name of the downloaded file. 
 
Step 5 
In step 5 we will be using uTorrent to spread the final file. Make sure your 
final binded program is in the same layout as you downloaded it so just 
replace the new binded file with the one in the folder you downloaded 
containing the program. This is because we will be uploading the folder and it 
looks more presentable in the way you got it making it more believable. 
 
To spread using uTorrent, open up uTorrent then click on file-> new torrent. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A new screen will show, click on ‘add file’ and then find the file you binded 
and renamed etc. and open it then under trackers put  
 
http://open.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce 
 
Tick ‘start seeding’ and then click ‘create and save as…’ like below 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When you save it make sure there is no ‘.exe’ in the name 
For example: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When you save you create a ‘torrent’ file which is what you will be uploading, 
the torrent is then used in other peoples ‘utorrents’ to download your binded 
file, so don’t move your new binded file or anything in or around the file. 
Locate your new torrent file. 
 

To get many downloads you need to go to these websites and upload your 
torrent to them: 
 
http://thepiratebay.org/upload 
http://www.mininova.org/upload 
http://www.btjunkie.org/?do=upload 
http://torrentbox.com/torrents-add.php 
http://www.torrentreactor.to/torrents/add 
http://www.seedpeer.com/upload.html 
http://www.bitenova.nl/upload 
http://www.torrentportal.com/torrents-upload.php 
http://www.fulldls.com/upload-torrent.php 
http://torrents.sumotorrent.com/upload.php 
http://www.torrentdownloads.net/upload/ 
http://www.torrentmatrix.com/torrents-upload.php 
http://fenopy.com/submit/index.html 
 
Once they are uploaded leave your uTorrent on as long as you can because 
only you have the file at the beginning and you will need to seed it. 
 
The preferred method of uploading is below: 
Upload your torrent to these sites first 
http://www.seedpeer.com/upload.html 
http://www.btjunkie.org/?do=upload 
http://www.bitenova.nl/upload 
http://www.fulldls.com/upload-torrent.php 
http://torrents.sumotorrent.com/upload.php 
Wait t’ill you have 5 seeds and 20 peers then upload to these 
http://www.torrentreactor.to/torrents/add 
http://www.torrentportal.com/torrents-upload.php 

 
Wait t’ill you have 10 seeds and 30 peers then upload to these 
http://www.torrentdownloads.net/upload/ 
http://www.torrentmatrix.com/torrents-upload.php 
Wait until you have 20 seeds then upload to these 
http://torrentbox.com/torrents-add.php 
When you have 20 seeds upload to this 
http://www.mininova.org/upload 
Wait a couple of hours like 8 then upload to 
http://thepiratebay.org/upload 
 
To check the seeds and peers you will need to look at the torrents stats on 
uTorrent. 
 
This is now the end of the Torrent spreading method which can be repeated 
with many different programs to maximise installs also if you can’t upload 
anymore because of bans use a proxy website or change your ip address so 
you can upload again but they do no accept your torrent just edit the files a 
little bit and make a torrent out of it and they will be non the wiser.  
 
Good luck guys 
 
 
Hopefully you can be as successful at spreading as me and you can make 
money of it by starting a spreading service, selling bots or use your server 
for PTC but under no circumstances will you re-distribute, re-sell or leach 
this guide innless you have paid for Resell rights of me (Tyler Durden). Also 
you can always or contact me on hackforums.net by PMing me and I will 
respond ASAP. 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this Method you can gather about 50 installs with a crypted server 
through the night when you’re asleep. That’s right you can get installs 
automatically just leaving your computer on making it a very lazy but 
efficient method for when you are asleep or away from your computer 
making sure you can spread 24/7. 
 
Let’s Begin Shall we 
 
In the method we shall be using the interface called ‘Omegle’. ‘Omegle’ is a 
website which lets you chat to strangers 1 on 1 and you know how effective 
that can be just looking at the first method in this e-book. With the Omegle 
spreading method we will be using a bot program to automatically do all the 
chatting for you and leave the chat with your link to your server so you get 
installs. 
 
Step 1  
First of all the Omegle spreader program has to run by itself and has to be 
on top of your screen so you can’t do anything else while it is so that’s why 
it’s best to do it when you’re asleep. You can find the Omegle spreader inside 
the ‘Tools” folder that should have come along with the download of this E-
book. Omegle Spreader is in the ‘Omegle spreader’ folder in the ‘Tools’ 
folder. 
 
Now you need to open up the Omegle spreader and place the settings you 
want, you don’t need to apply that much actually, all you need to do is put 
your download link and some usual chit chat to make them believe your real. 
 

Step 2 
To use the Omegle spreader properly you will need to put a static (non 
changing) direct(straight to the ‘.exe’ no waiting) link there to be really 
effective. Before you do this you will want to change the name of your 
server to ‘slideshow’, also you can change the icon of the server to make it 
more believable and crypt it which the tutorials for can be found above 
which will increase the install rate. Once you have disguised the file well 
enough you can create your direct link to your server. There are many ways 
to do this For Example going on hackforums.net and searching for direct link 
websites. I personally prefer to use www.uppit.com. To use uppit effectively 
you will need to click browse and select your server, then when done just 
click upload and wait. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

After waiting for it to upload go to the URL where it says you can download 
your server.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When you are there click the big ‘download’ button 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Go here 

and that should lead you to a screen with ‘download starting, click here if 
nothing happens’. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On that screen just right click-> properties 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

and copy and paste the ‘address URL’ into Omegle for a direct link to your 
server. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

And finally here is my overall screen before I click ‘start’ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As you can see I have filled it with convincing information to make it 
believable. I also included a legit picture to look at in the third message 
which can be found in the ‘tools folder inside ‘picture for Omegle’. This is for 
you to upload using an image hosting website such as http://imageshack.us/ 
and then paste in the third box. 
 
Now that you have got your pictures ready, you will need to press ‘start’ as 
you are ready to spread you server efficiently over night. When you press 
start you will have to leave your computer completely as you can not use any 
of it while the Omegle spreader is doing it’s thing. The spreader will then 
start moving your mouse automatically and will chat to people for you 
automatically. 
 
This is now the end of the ‘Omegle spread tutorial’ which is much easier to 
do than the other methods and may get not many installs but is very 
efficient for when you are asleep. 
 
 
 
 
 

Hopefully with this method you can be as successful at spreading as me and 
you can make money of it by starting a spreading service, selling bots or use 
your server for PTC but under no circumstances will you re-distribute, re-
sell or leach this guide innless you have paid for Resell rights of me (Tyler 
Durden). Also you can always or contact me on hackforums.net by PMing me 
and I will respond ASAP. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
In this method we will be spreading via Chatrooms on websites. With this 
method you can reach about 30 installs an hours which I have done myself. 
This method is good as you can get anyone to follow you into your own chat 
and basically have an unlimited amount of people to infect. 
 
In this method you will be going on chat websites and will be inviting someone 
to chat with you on ‘MSN Messenger’ in which you will be social engineering 
them to install your server. You will get them to believe you’re a girl and 
send them your server. This method is very similar to the Yahoo messenger 
spreading method except you are reaching many more people and can target 
who you want to infect better. You will however have to refer to some 
tutorials above in the other methods as it is a waste of E-book pages to 
repeat and you paid for your pages to be detailed. 
 
Step 1 
 
The first step in this method, just like the other steps is to crypt your 
server (I will move to next part because if you want to crypt your server or 
know what it means just read the tutorials above) which you should now have 
done. When you have done this you will need to change the name of your 
server and the icon which is shown how to do in the ‘Yahoo messenger 
spreading method’ tutorial above. Now that your server is prepared to 
spread, you will need a email address so you can chat to your victims all at 
once and send your server effectively. 
 
We will be setting a hotmail account and download MSN Messenger to do 
this, if you have MSN Messenger set-up and a spare e-mail address (a spare 
one is needed because you don’t want random people asking for boobs on your 
main account) then just skip to step 2 but if you don’t then read on. 
 
You can download MSN Messenger here: 
http://windowslive.com/desktop/messenger  
 
Or  
 

Go to www.Google.com and search for ‘download msn messenger’ then click 
the first link. 
 
When you are on the download page just click ‘Download Now’ and follow the 
screen instructions to install MSN Messenger. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You should have now installed MSN Messenger 
 
Now you have to set up the new e-mail address so you to use on your 
chatroom victims. 
 
Go to www.hotmail.com and click sign up on the left of the screen or just 
simply type www.hotmail.com into your URL bar if you don’t want to click the 
link. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Then just fill out the boxes with fake information but use an appealing name 
for your e-mail address, For example ‘LittleMissSexy2U@hotmail.com’ like 
below and then click ‘I accept’. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Once accepted your email should be ready, now you need to find your target. 
 
Step 2 
 
Now you can simply find your targets by going into any chat room, just say 
your information so that it’s associated with the group your targeting, For 
Example if I’m in a teen chat room I will say that I am a teen. Simple. You 
can just Google ‘chatrooms’ and any of them should be fine but try and go 
for a younger audience who are more likely to install your server. 
 
Here is a good list of websites to use though: 
www.chat-avenue.com 
www.teenssite.co.uk 
www.justchat.co.uk 
www.worldofchat.co.uk/ 

www.teensay.com/ 
www.321teenchat.com 
www.teenchat.com 
 
Now open up MSN Messenger and sign in using your sign up details you just 
made, edit your name to something good like below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Also change your Personal Message to your ‘direct download link’, to get your 
direct download .exe link just look at page 36 of this e-book and onwards to 
get a ‘direct download link’. So by now you should have got a download link 
but it has an ‘.exe’ or ‘.scr’ on the end of it, so we will just have to cover up 
the link using www.tinyurl.com (Google it if the link doesn’t work). Just paste 
the link into www.tinyurl.com and shorten the link. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You should then brought to this page: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Just copy and paste the shortened link into the ‘personal message’ field, with 
an incentive like below. Then click ‘ok’. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3 
Now you are ready to spread your e-mail address, so just enter any chat 
room and type in ‘anyone wanna chat? My email is 
***************@hotmail.com’ (your email address you made). Try and 
associate your username in the chatroom with your email address so that it 
is believed that you are a girl, like below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Now you should get loads of people adding you, like below 
 
 
 
 
 

Add them all and use the chatting technique used in the ‘Yahoo spreading 
methods’ on page 14 in this e-book to spread your link to your server, so that 
you are copy and pasting your direct download link to everyone which makes 
them believe they are looking at a picture. I know this guide is using already 
explained techniques but is still a good alternative especially for reaching 
specific groups yahoo messenger doesn’t have. 
 
This now the end of ‘The Chatrooms spreading method’. It is a good 
alternative to the yahoo one and is still very effective and has more options, 
as you can target better groups if needed. 
 
Hopefully with this method you can be as successful at spreading as me and 
you can make money of it by starting a spreading service, selling bots or use 
your server for PTC but under no circumstances will you re-distribute, re-
sell or leach this guide innless you have paid for Resell rights of me (Tyler 
Durden). Also you can always or contact me on hackforums.net by PMing me 
and I will respond ASAP. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
This is now the end of the E-book, hopefully you feel your got your money’s 
worth. This guide has some known methods of spreading in but they had 
never really been explained in detail on how to get the most out of them. 
This guide didn’t just include basic methods but showed you a combination of 
methods that can all be done at once to guarantee 2000 installs a day easily. 
When you get healthy and a high amount of torrent uploaded, each of them 
can get 100 installs everyday which will only take 20 minutes usually to set 
up one torrent, and If you include Omegle for when your sleeping with 
torrents on, then that can get you 50 installs a night usually. When both 
chatroom methods are both applied you get instant installs, so much that I 
can get a minimum of 200 installs an hour easily. If combine just the 
automatic methods throughout a day you get on average you get: 
 
10 torrents = 1000 installs 
Omegle for 24 hours = 150 installs+ 
That is 1150 installs without doing anything at all 
 
If you include the Chatrooms after experience: 
 
5 torrents = 500 installs 
Omegle for 24 hours = 150 installs+ 
5 hours chatrooms = 1000 installs 
 
All together that is over 2000+ installs in 5 hours everyday easy which can 
lead to you getting your money back if sell each bot install for $0.10, this 
means you would get $200 for 5 hours of spreading. I have over 20 torrents 
still getting installs everyday so my chatroom talk is very limited as I have 
enough installs from torrents so I don’t need to do more than 1 hour 
everyday to reach 2000+ installs, which you can reach also. 
 
This E-book has clearly shown that anyone can reach 2000+ for free easily 
even if your not good at one of the methods. I have also included a word 
document including some links to some other methods of spreading which to 
me weren’t going to generate that many installs put may come of some help 
to you, it can be found in the ‘Tools’ folder in the ‘.Word’ sub folder. 

If you have any questions, suggestions or anything I need to fix in the E-
Book (for example grammar) then just PM me (Tyler Durden) on
