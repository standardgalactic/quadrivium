loving, supportive family, I thank God for you.
I also dedicate this book to the millions of investors who deserve more 
knowledge and information to achieve lasting prosperity.


Author’s Acknowledgments
First and foremost, I offer my appreciation and gratitude to the wonderful 
people at Wiley. It has been a pleasure to work with such a top-notch organi-
zation that works so hard to create products that offer readers tremendous 
value and information. I wish all of you continued success! Wiley has some 
notables whom I want to single out.
The fi rst person is Georgette Beatty (my project editor). She has guided me 
from day one. Her patience, professionalism, and guidance have kept me 
sane and productive. Thanks for being great!
Todd Lothery (my copy editor) is a pro who took my bundle of words and 
turned them into worthy messages, and I thank him. 
The technical editor, Juli Erhart-Graves, is a great fi nancial pro whom I appre-
ciate. She made sure that my logic is sound and my facts are straight. I wish 
her continued success. 
My gratitude again goes out to my fantastic acquisitions editor, Stacy 
Kennedy, for making this 3rd edition happen. For Dummies books don’t magi-
cally appear at the bookstore; they happen because of the foresight and 
efforts of people like Stacy. Wiley is fortunate to have her (and the others 
also mentioned)!
Fran, Lipa Zyenska, I appreciate your great support during the writing and 
updating of this book. It’s not always easy dealing with the world, but with 
you by my side, I know that God has indeed blessed me. Te amo! 
Lastly, I want to acknowledge you, the reader. Over the years, you’ve made 
the For Dummies books what they are today. Your devotion to these wonder-
ful books helped build a foundation that played a big part in the creation of 
this book and many more yet to come. Thank you!

Introduction
S
tock Investing For Dummies, 3rd Edition, has been an honor for me to 
write. I’m grateful that I can share my thoughts, information, and experi-
ence with such a large and devoted group of readers.
I think that this edition is my most important edition so far because so much 
change, volatility, and uncertainty have become a part of the stock market. 
It’s not your parents’ stock market anymore. The opportunities for great 
gains (and even greater losses) have reached an extreme. In some ways, 
today’s market reminds me of Dickens’ famous novel opener: “It was the best 
of times, it was the worst of times . . . .” In terms of what faces us in today’s 
world — economic uncertainty, terrorism, war, political tensions, higher 
taxes, rising inflation, unemployment, and so on — these seem like the worst 
of times. Yet when I think of the tools, strategies, and investing vehicles avail-
able for you to build (and protect) wealth, these can be the best of times.
Successful stock investing takes diligent work and knowledge, like any other 
meaningful pursuit. This book can definitely help you avoid the mistakes 
others have made and can point you in the right direction. It will give you 
a heads up about trends and conditions that are found in few other stock 
investing guides. Explore the pages of this book and find the topics that most 
interest you within the world of stock investing. Let me assure you that I’ve 
squeezed over a quarter century of experience, education, and expertise 
between these covers. My track record is as good (or better) as the track 
records of the experts who trumpet their successes. More important, I share 
information to avoid common mistakes (some of which I made myself!). 
Understanding what not to do can be just as important as figuring out what 
to do.
In all the years that I’ve counseled and educated investors, the single dif-
ference between success and failure, between gain and loss, boils down to 
one word: knowledge. Take this book as your first step in a lifelong learning 
adventure.
About This Book
The stock market has been a cornerstone of the investor’s passive wealth-
building program for over a century and continues in this role. This decade 
has been one huge roller coaster ride for stock investors. Fortunes have been 
made and lost. With all the media attention, all the talking heads on radio and 

2
Stock Investing For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
television, and the books with titles like Dow at 36,000, the investing public 
still didn’t avoid losing trillions in a historic stock market debacle. Sadly, 
even the so-called experts who understand stocks didn’t see the economic 
and geopolitical forces that acted like a tsunami on the market. With just a 
little more knowledge and a few wealth-preserving techniques, more inves-
tors could have held onto their hard-earned stock market fortunes. Cheer 
up, though: This book gives you an early warning on those megatrends and 
events that will affect your stock portfolio. While other books may tell you 
about stocks, this book tells you about stocks and what affects them.
This book is designed to give you a realistic approach to making money in 
stocks. It provides the essence of sound, practical stock investing strategies 
and insights that have been market-tested and proven from nearly 100 years 
of stock market history. I don’t expect you to read it cover to cover, although 
I’d be delighted if you read every word! Instead, this book is designed as a ref-
erence tool. Feel free to read the chapters in whatever order you choose. You 
can flip to the sections and chapters that interest you or those that include 
topics that you need to know more about.
Stock Investing For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is also quite different from the “get 
rich with stocks” titles that have crammed the bookshelves in recent years. It 
doesn’t take a standard approach to the topic; it doesn’t assume that stocks 
are a sure thing and the be-all, end-all of wealth building. In fact, at times in 
this book, I tell you not to invest in stocks.
This book can help you succeed not only in up markets but also in down mar-
kets. Bull markets and bear markets come and go, but the informed investor 
can keep making money no matter what. To give you an extra edge, I’ve tried 
to include information about the investing environment for stocks. Whether 
it’s politics or hurricanes (or both), you need to know how the big picture 
affects your stock investment decisions.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make navigating through this book easier, I’ve established the following 
conventions:
 
✓ Boldface text points out keywords or the main parts of bulleted items.
 
✓ Italics highlight new terms that are defined.
 
✓ Monofont is used for Web addresses.

3
 Introduction
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break 
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I haven’t put in 
any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So when using 
one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book, 
pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
Sidebars (gray boxes of text) in this book give you a more in-depth look at a 
certain topic. While they further illuminate a particular point, these sidebars 
aren’t crucial to your understanding of the rest of the book. Feel free to read 
them or skip them. Of course, I’d love for you to read them all, but my feelings 
won’t be hurt if you decide to skip them over.
The text that accompanies the Technical Stuff icon (see the forthcoming sec-
tion “Icons Used in This Book”) can be passed over as well. The text associ-
ated with this icon gives some technical details about stock investing that are 
certainly interesting and informative, but you can still come away with the 
information you need without reading this text.
Foolish Assumptions
I figure you’ve picked up this book for one or more of the following reasons:
 
✓ You’re a beginner and want a crash course on stock investing that’s an 
easy read.
 
✓ You’re already a stock investor, and you need a book that allows you to 
read only those chapters that cover specific stock investing topics of 
interest to you.
 
✓ You need to review your own situation with the information in the book 
to see if you missed anything when you invested in that hot stock that 
your brother-in-law recommended.
 
✓ You need a great gift! When Uncle Mo is upset over his poor stock picks, 
you can give him this book so he can get back on his financial feet. Be 
sure to get a copy for his broker, too. (Odds are that the broker was the 
one who made those picks to begin with.)

Stock Investing For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
How This Book Is Organized
The information is laid out in a straightforward format. The parts progress 
in a logical approach that any investor interested in stocks can follow very 
easily.
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing
This part is for everyone. Understanding the essentials of stock investing 
and investing in general will only help you, especially in uncertain economic 
times. Stocks may even touch your finances in ways not readily apparent. 
For example, stocks aren’t only in individual accounts; they’re also in mutual 
funds and pension plans.
An important point is that stocks are really financial tools that are a means to 
an end. Investors should be able to answer the question, “Why am I consider-
ing stocks at all?” Stocks are a great vehicle for wealth building, but only if 
investors realize what they can accomplish and how to use them. Chapter 2 
explains how to take stock of your current financial situation and goals, and 
Chapter 3 defines common approaches to stock investing.
One of the essentials of stock investing is understanding risk. Most people 
are clueless about risk. Chapter 4, on risk, is one of the most important chap-
ters that serious stock investors should read. You can’t avoid every type of 
risk out there (life itself embodies risk). However, this chapter can help you 
recognize it and find ways to minimize it in your stock investing program.
Part II: Before You Start Buying
When you’re ready to embark on your career as a stock investor, you need to 
use some resources to gather information about the stocks you’re interested 
in. Fortunately, you live in the information age. I pity the investors from the 
1920s who didn’t have access to so many resources, but today’s investors 
are in an enviable position. This part tells you where to find information and 
how to use it to be a more knowledgeable investor (a rarity in recent years!). 
For example, I explain that stocks can be used for both growth and income 
purposes, and I discuss the characteristics of each; see Chapters 8 and 9 for 
more information.

5
 Introduction
Chapter 6 is a great starting place for your information gathering; I show 
you how to stay on top of financial news and read stock tables, among other 
topics.
When you’re ready to invest, you’ll invariably have to turn to a broker. 
Several types of brokers are out there, so you should know which is which. 
The wrong broker can make you . . . uh . . . broker. Chapter 7 helps you 
choose.
New to this edition is Chapter 10, which gives you the lowdown on how a 
grasp of basic economics can make you more successful with your stock 
investing strategy.
Part III: Picking Winners
Part III is about picking good stocks by using microeconomics, meaning that 
you look at the stocks of individual companies. I explain how to evaluate a 
company’s products, services, and other factors so that you can determine 
whether a company is strong and healthy.
One of the major differences with this edition versus earlier editions is the 
emphasis on emerging sector opportunities. If I can steer you toward those 
segments of the stock market that show solid promise for the coming years, 
that alone would make your stock portfolio thrive. Putting your money into 
solid companies in thriving industries has been the hallmark of superior 
stock investing throughout history. It’s no different now. Check out Chapter 
14 if you want to know more about emerging sector opportunities.
Where do you turn to find out about a company’s financial health? In 
Chapters 11 and 12, I show you the documents you should review to make a 
more informed decision. When you find the information, you’ll discover how 
to make sense of that data as well. While you’re at it, check out Chapter 13 
(on analyzing industries) and Chapter 15 (on how politics affects the art of 
stock picking).
I compare buying stock to picking goldfish. If you look at a bunch of goldfish 
to choose which ones to buy, you want to make sure that you pick the health-
iest ones. With stocks, you also need to pick companies that are healthy. 
Part III can help you do that.

6
Stock Investing For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics
Even the stocks of great companies can fall in a bad investing environment. 
This is where you should be aware of the “macro.” If stocks were goldfish, the 
macro would be the pond or goldfish bowl. In that case, even healthy gold-
fish can die if the water is toxic. Therefore, you should monitor the investing 
environment for stocks. Part IV reveals tips, strategies, and resources that 
you shouldn’t ignore.
Investing is a long-term activity, but stocks can also be short-term oppor-
tunities, so I discuss stock trading in Chapter 16. In Chapter 17, I provide 
guidance on selecting an investing strategy that’s right for your personal and 
financial situations.
After you understand stocks and the economic environment in which they 
operate, choose the strategy and the tactics to help steer you to your 
wealth-building objectives. Chapter 18 reveals some of my all-time favorite 
techniques for building wealth and holding onto your stock investment gains 
(definitely check it out).
You may be an investor, but that doesn’t mean that you have deep pockets. 
Chapter 19 tells you how to buy stocks with low (or no) transaction costs. 
If you’re going to buy the stock anyway, why not save on commissions and 
other costs?
As an investor, you must keep an eye on what company insiders are doing. In 
Chapter 20, I explain what it may mean if a company’s management is buying 
or selling the same stock that you’re considering.
After you spend all your time, money, and effort to grow your money in the 
world of stocks, you have yet another concern: holding onto your hard-
earned gains. This challenge is summarized in one word: taxes. Sound tax 
planning is crucial for everyone who works hard. After all, taxes are the big-
gest expense in your lifetime (right after children!). See Chapter 21 for more 
information.
Part V: The Part of Tens
I wrap up the book with a hallmark of For Dummies books — the Part of Tens. 
These chapters give you a mini crash course in stock investing, including ten 
ways to protect yourself from fraud.

7
 Introduction
In this part, I offer some tips on how to profit with stocks before the crowd 
does (Chapter 22) and how to protect those profits (Chapter 23). I also pro-
vide a list of ten red flags for stock investors (Chapter 24), along with ten 
challenges and opportunities that face stock investors (Chapter 25).
Part VI: Appendixes
Don’t overlook the appendixes. I pride myself on the resources I can pro-
vide my students and readers so that they can make informed investment 
decisions. Whether the topic is stock investing terminology, economics, or 
avoiding capital gains taxes, I include a treasure trove of resources to help 
you. Whether you go to a bookstore, the library, or the Internet, Appendix A 
gives you some great places to turn to for help. In Appendix B, I explain finan-
cial ratios. These important numbers help you better determine whether to 
invest in a particular company’s stock.

Stock Investing For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
Where to Go from Here
You may not need to read every chapter to make you more confident as 
a stock investor, so feel free to jump around to suit your personal needs. 
Because every chapter is designed to be as self-contained as possible, it 
won’t do you any harm to cherry-pick what you really want to read. But if 
you’re like me, you may still want to check out every chapter because you 
never know when you may come across a new tip or resource that will make 
a profitable difference in your stock portfolio. I want you to be successful so 
that I can brag about you in the next edition!

Par t I
The Essentials of 
Stock Investing

In this part . . .
T
he latest market turmoil and uncertainty tell investors 
to get back to square one. Your success is dependent 
on doing your homework before you invest your first dollar 
in stocks. Most investors don’t realize that they should be 
scrutinizing their own situations and financial goals at least 
as much as they scrutinize stocks. How else can you know 
which stocks are right for you? Too many people risk too 
much simply because they don’t take stock of their current 
needs, goals, and risk tolerance before they invest. The 
chapters in this part tell you what you need to know to 
choose the stocks that best suit you.

Chapter 1
Welcome to the World 
of Stock Investing
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing the essentials
▶ Doing your own research
▶ Recognizing winners
▶ Exploring investment strategies
S
tock investing was the hot thing during the late 1990s — a trend just 
like the hula hoop and pet rocks. With the new millennium, however, 
a reversal of fortunes has occurred as the bear market of 2000–2002 rocked 
our world (a bear market is a prolonged period of falling prices — in this 
case, stock prices). This decade has been a wild roller coaster ride that saw 
the market hit new highs in 2007, although it’s down in ugly fashion in 2008. 
During this time, the public figured out that stock investing isn’t for wild-
eyed amateurs or dart-throwers (or the worst . . . wild-eyed amateur dart-
throwers!).
I wrote much of this 3rd Edition with current events and market conditions 
on my radar screen. The year 2008 witnessed some ominous events that will 
make stock investing very interesting (to say the least) for the time being. 
Don’t let that scare you, though; informed investors have made money in all 
sorts of markets — good, bad, and even ugly. As I write this, the conditions 
are in place for an inflationary depression, but selecting stocks that can ben-
efit from these challenging times could indeed make you much wealthier.
The purpose of this book is not only to tell you about the basics of stock 
investing but also to let you in on some solid strategies that can help you 
profit from the stock market. Before you invest your first dollar, you need to 
understand the basics of stock investing, which I introduce in this chapter.

12
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Understanding the Basics
The basics are so basic that few people are doing them. Perhaps the most 
basic (and therefore most important) thing to grasp is the risk you face 
whenever you do anything (like putting your hard-earned money in an invest-
ment like a stock). When you lose track of the basics, you lose track of why 
you invested to begin with. Find out more about risk (and the different kinds 
of risk) in Chapter 4.
When the late comedian Henny Youngman was asked, “How is your wife?” he 
responded, “Compared to what?” This also applies to stocks. When you’re 
asked, “How is your stock?” you can very well respond that it’s doing well, 
especially when compared to an acceptable yardstick such as a stock index 
(like the S&P 500). Find out more about indexes in Chapter 5.
 
The bottom line in stock investing is that you shouldn’t immediately send 
your money to a brokerage account or go to a Web site and click “buy stock.” 
The first thing you should do is find out as much as you can about what stocks 
are and how to use them to achieve your wealth-building goals. Chapters 2 
and 3 help you take stock of your current financial situation and help you 
understand common approaches to stock investing.
Before you continue, I want to get straight exactly what a stock is. Stock is a 
type of security that indicates ownership in a corporation and represents a 
claim on the part of that corporation’s assets and earnings. The two primary 
types of stocks are common and preferred. Common stock (what I cover 
throughout this book) entitles the owner to vote at shareholders’ meetings 
and receive any dividends that the company issues. Preferred stock doesn’t 
usually confer voting rights, but it does include some rights that exceed 
those of common stock. Preferred stockholders, for example, have priority in 
certain conditions, such as receiving dividends before common stockholders 
in the event that the corporation is going bankrupt.
Preparing to Buy Stocks
Gathering information is critical in your stock-investing pursuits. You should 
gather information on your stock picks two times: before you invest and 
after. Obviously, you should become more informed before you invest your 
first dollar, but you also need to stay informed about what’s happening to the 
company whose stock you buy, and also about the industry and the general 
economy. To find the best information sources, check out Chapter 6.

13
 Chapter 1: Welcome to the World of Stock Investing
 
When you’re ready to invest, you need a brokerage account. How do you know 
which broker to use? Chapter 7 provides some answers and resources to help 
you choose a broker.
Knowing How to Pick Winners
When you get past the basics, you can get to the meat of stock picking. 
Successful stock picking isn’t mysterious, but it does take some time, effort, 
and analysis. And the effort is worthwhile because stocks are a convenient 
and important part of most investors’ portfolios. Read the following sections 
and be sure to leapfrog to the relevant chapters to get the inside scoop on 
hot stocks.
Recognizing stock value
Imagine that you like eggs and you’re buying them at the grocery store. 
In this example, the eggs are like companies, and the prices represent the 
prices that you would pay for the companies’ stock. The grocery store is the 
stock market. What if two brands of eggs are similar, but one costs 50 cents 
a carton and the other costs 75 cents? Which would you choose? Odds are 
that you’d look at both brands, judge their quality, and if they’re indeed simi-
lar, take the cheaper eggs. The eggs at 75 cents are overpriced. The same is 
true of stocks. What if you compare two companies that are similar in every 
respect but have different share prices? All things being equal, the cheaper 
price has greater value for the investor.
But the egg example has another side. What if the quality of the two brands 
of eggs is significantly different, but their prices are the same? If one brand 
of eggs is stale, of poor quality, and priced at 50 cents and the other brand is 
fresh, of superior quality, and also priced at 50 cents, which would you get? 
I’d take the good brand because they’re better eggs. Perhaps the lesser eggs 
are an acceptable purchase at 10 cents, but they’re definitely overpriced at 
50 cents. The same example works with stocks. A poorly run company isn’t 
a good choice if you can buy a better company in the marketplace at the 
same — or a better — price.
 
Comparing the value of eggs may seem overly simplistic, but doing so does 
cut to the heart of stock investing. Eggs and egg prices can be as varied as 
companies and stock prices. As an investor, you must make it your job to find 
the best value for your investment dollars. (Otherwise you get egg on your 
face. You saw that one coming, right?)

14
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Understanding how market capitalization 
affects stock value
You can determine a company’s value (and thus the value of its stock) in 
many ways. The most basic way is to look at the company’s market value, 
also known as market capitalization (or market cap). Market capitalization is 
simply the value you get when you multiply all the outstanding shares of a 
stock by the price of a single share.
 
Calculating the market cap is easy. If a company has 1 million shares outstand-
ing and its share price is $10, the market cap is $10 million.
Small cap, mid cap, and large cap aren’t references to headgear; they’re refer-
ences to how large a company is as measured by its market value. Here are 
the five basic stock categories of market capitalization:
 
✓ Micro cap (under $250 million): These stocks are the smallest and 
hence the riskiest available.
 
✓ Small cap ($250 million to $1 billion): These stocks fare better than the 
microcaps and still have plenty of growth potential. The key word here 
is “potential.”
 
✓ Mid cap ($1 billion to $10 billion): For many investors, this category 
offers a good compromise between small caps and large caps. These 
stocks have some of the safety of large caps while retaining some of the 
growth potential of small caps.
 
✓ Large cap ($10 billion to $50 billion): This category is usually best 
reserved for conservative stock investors who want steady appreciation 
with greater safety. Stocks in this category are frequently referred to as 
blue chips.
 
✓ Ultra cap (over $50 billion): These stocks are also called mega caps and 
obviously refer to companies that are the biggest of the big. Stocks such 
as General Electric and Exxon Mobil are examples.
 
From a safety point of view, a company’s size and market value do matter. 
All things being equal, large cap stocks are considered safer than small 
cap stocks. However, small cap stocks have greater potential for growth. 
Compare these stocks to trees: Which tree is sturdier, a giant California red-
wood or a small oak tree that’s just a year old? In a great storm, the redwood 
holds up well, while the smaller tree has a rough time. But you also have to 
ask yourself which tree has more opportunity for growth. The redwood may 
not have much growth left, but the small oak tree has plenty of growth to look 
forward to.

15
 Chapter 1: Welcome to the World of Stock Investing
For beginning investors, comparing market cap to trees isn’t so far-fetched. 
You want your money to branch out without becoming a sap.
 
Although market capitalization is important to consider, don’t invest (or not 
invest) based solely on it. It’s just one measure of value. As a serious investor, 
you need to look at numerous factors that can help you determine whether 
any given stock is a good investment. Keep reading — this book is full of infor-
mation to help you decide.
Sharpening your investment skills
Investors who analyze a company can better judge the value of its stock 
and profit from buying and selling it. Your greatest asset in stock investing 
is knowledge (and a little common sense). To succeed in the world of stock 
investing, keep in mind these key success factors:
 
✓ Understand why you want to invest in stocks. Are you seeking apprecia-
tion (capital gains) or income (dividends)? Look at Chapters 8 and 9 for 
information on these topics.
 
✓ Get a good grounding in economics. It could save your financial life! In 
Chapter 10, I include some basic (but interesting) points on economics 
because I think that stock investors (as a group) are woefully underedu-
cated in economics and are therefore at risk (translation: bad stock deci-
sions!). Check it out — you’ll be glad you did.
 
✓ Do some research. Look at the company whose stock you’re considering 
to see whether it’s a profitable business worthy of your investment dol-
lars. Chapters 11 and 12 help you scrutinize companies.
 
✓ Choosing a winning stock also means that you choose a winning indus-
try. You’ll frequently see stock prices of mediocre companies in hot 
industries rise higher and faster than solid companies in floundering 
industries. Therefore, choosing the industry is very important. Find out 
more about analyzing industries in Chapter 13.
 
✓ Understand and identify megatrends. Doing so makes it easier for you 
to make money. This edition spends more time and provides more 
resources to help you see the opportunities in emerging sectors and 
avoid the problem areas (see Chapter 14 for details).
 
✓ Understand how the world affects your stock. Stocks succeed or fail in 
large part because of the environment in which they operate. Economics 
(see Chapter 10) and politics (see Chapter 15) make up that world, so 
you should know something about them.

✓ Use investing strategies like the pros do. In other words, how you go 
about investing can be just as important as what you invest in. Chapters 
17, 18, and 19 highlight techniques for investing to help you make more 
money from your stocks.
 
✓ Keep more of the money you earn. After all your great work in getting 
the right stocks and making the big bucks, you should know about keep-
ing more of the fruits of your investing. I cover taxes in stock investing in 
Chapter 21.
 
✓ Sometimes, what people tell you to do with stocks is not as revealing 
as what people are actually doing. This is why I like to look at company 
insiders before I buy or sell a particular stock. To find out more about 
insider buying and selling, read Chapter 20.
Actually, every chapter in this book offers you valuable guidance on some 
essential aspect of the fantastic world of stocks. The knowledge you pick up 
and apply from these pages has been tested over nearly a century of stock 
picking. The investment experience of the past — the good, the bad, and 
some of the ugly — is here for your benefit. Use this information to make a 
lot of money (and make me proud!). And don’t forget to check out the appen-
dixes, where I provide a wide variety of investing resources and financial 
ratios!
Stock market insanity
Have you ever noticed a stock going up even 
though the company is reporting terrible results? 
How about seeing a stock nosedive despite 
the fact that the company is doing well? What 
gives? Well, judging the direction of a stock in a 
short-term period — over the next few days or 
weeks — is almost impossible.
Yes, in the short term, stock investing is irra-
tional. The price of a stock and the value of 
its company seem disconnected and crazy. 
The key phrase to remember is “short term.” A 
stock’s price and the company’s value become 
more logical over an extended period of time. 
The longer a stock is in the public’s view, the 
more rational the performance of the stock’s 
price. In other words, a good company con-
tinues to draw attention to itself; hence, more 
people want its stock, and the share price 
rises to better match the company’s value. 
Conversely, a bad company doesn’t hold up to 
continued scrutiny over time. As more and more 
people see that the company isn’t doing well, 
the share price declines. Over the long run, a 
stock’s share price and the company’s value 
eventually become equal for the most part.

 Chapter 1: Welcome to the World of Stock Investing
Boning Up on Strategies and Tactics
Successful investing isn’t just what you invest in; it’s also the way you invest. 
I’m very big on strategies such as trailing stops and limit orders. You can find 
out more in Chapter 18.
Buying stocks doesn’t always mean that you must buy through a broker and 
that it must be 100 shares. You can buy stock for as little as $25 using pro-
grams such as dividend reinvestment plans. Chapter 19 tells you more.
 
While you’re at it, you may as well find out what the corporate insiders are 
doing. Why? Because corporate insiders are among the first to find out what’s 
really going on inside a company, and that knowledge is reflected in their 
investing decisions, which you should pay attention to. You can find out more 
about insider trading and other management doings in Chapter 20.

Taking Stock of Your Current 
Financial Situation and Goals
In This Chapter
▶ Preparing your personal balance sheet
▶ Looking at your cash flow statement
▶ Determining your financial goals
Yes, you want to make the big bucks. Or maybe you just want to get back 
the big bucks you lost in stocks during the bear market (a long period 
of falling prices) of 2000–2002, or perhaps in the tumultuous volatility of 2007 
and early 2008. (Investors who followed the guidelines from the 1st and 2nd 
editions of this book did much better than the crowd!) Either way, you want 
your money to grow so that you can have a better life. But before you make 
reservations for that Caribbean cruise you’re dreaming about, you have to 
map out your action plan for getting there. Stocks can be a great component 
of most wealth-building programs, but you must first do some homework 
on a topic that you should be very familiar with — yourself. That’s right. 
Understanding your current financial situation and clearly defining your 
financial goals are the first steps in successful investing.
Let me give you an example. I met an investor at one of my seminars who 
had a million dollars worth of Procter & Gamble (PG) stock, and he was near-
ing retirement. He asked me whether he should sell his stock and be more 
growth-oriented and invest in a batch of small cap stocks (stocks of a com-
pany worth $250 million to $1 billion; see Chapter 1 for more information). 
Because he already had enough assets to retire on at that time, I said that he 
didn’t need to get more aggressive. In fact, I told him that he had too much 
tied to a single stock, even though it was a solid, large company. What would 
happen to his assets if problems arose at PG? It seemed obvious to tell him to 
shrink his stock portfolio and put that money elsewhere, such as paying off 
debt or adding investment-grade bonds for diversification.

20
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
This chapter is undoubtedly one of the most important chapters in this book. 
At first, you may think it’s a chapter more suitable for some general book on 
personal finance. Wrong! Unsuccessful investors’ greatest weakness is not 
understanding their financial situation and how stocks fit in. Often, I counsel 
people to stay out of the stock market if they aren’t prepared for the respon-
sibilities of stock investing — they haven’t been regularly reviewing the com-
pany’s financial statements or tracking the company’s progress.
 
Investing in stocks requires balance. Investors sometimes tie up too much 
money in stocks, putting themselves at risk of losing a significant portion of 
their wealth if the market plunges. Then again, other investors place little or 
no money in stocks and therefore miss out on excellent opportunities to grow 
their wealth. Investors should make stocks a part of their portfolios, but the 
operative word is part. You should let stocks take up only a portion of your 
money. A disciplined investor also has money in bank accounts, investment-
grade bonds, precious metals, and other assets that offer growth or income 
opportunities. Diversification is the key to minimizing risk. (For more on risk, 
see Chapter 4.)
Establishing a Starting Point 
by Preparing a Balance Sheet
Whether you’re already in stocks or you’re looking to get into stocks, you 
need to find out about how much money you can afford to invest. No matter 
what you hope to accomplish with your stock investing plan, the first step 
you should take is to figure out how much you own and how much you owe. 
To do this, prepare and review your personal balance sheet. A balance sheet 
is simply a list of your assets, your liabilities, and what each item is currently 
worth so you can arrive at your net worth. Your net worth is total assets 
minus total liabilities. I know that these terms sound like accounting mumbo 
jumbo, but knowing your net worth is important to your future financial suc-
cess, so just do it.
Composing your balance sheet is simple. Pull out a pencil and a piece of paper. 
For the computer savvy, a spreadsheet software program accomplishes the 
same task. Gather all your financial documents, such as bank and brokerage 
statements and other such paperwork — you need figures from these docu-
ments. Then follow the steps that I outline in the following sections. Update 
your balance sheet at least once a year to monitor your financial progress (is 
your net worth going up or down?).

21
 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals
 
Your personal balance sheet is really no different from balance sheets that 
giant companies prepare. (The main difference is a few zeros, but you can 
use my advice in this book to work on changing that.) In fact, the more you 
find out about your own balance sheet, the easier it is to understand the bal-
ance sheet of companies in which you’re seeking to invest. See Chapter 11 for 
details on reviewing company balance sheets.
Step 1: Make sure you have 
an emergency fund
First, list cash on your balance sheet. Your goal is to have, in reserve, at least 
three to six months’ worth of your gross living expenses in cash and cash 
equivalents. The cash is important because it gives you a cushion. Three to 
six months is usually enough to get you through the most common forms of 
financial disruption, such as losing your job.
 
If your monthly expenses (or outgo) are $2,000, you should have at least 
$6,000, and probably closer to $12,000, in a secure, FDIC-insured, interest-
bearing bank account (or other, relatively safe interest-bearing vehicle such as 
a money market fund). Consider this account an emergency fund and not an 
investment. Don’t use this money to buy stocks.
Too many Americans don’t have an emergency fund, meaning that they put 
themselves at risk. Walking across a busy street while wearing a blindfold is a 
great example of putting yourself at risk, and in recent years, investors have 
done the financial equivalent. Investors piled on tremendous debt, put too 
much into investments (such as stocks) that they didn’t understand, and had 
little or no savings. One of the biggest problems during this past decade was 
that savings were sinking to record lows while debt levels were reaching new 
heights. People then sold many stocks because they needed funds for — you 
guessed it — paying bills and debt.
 
Resist the urge to start thinking of your investment in stocks as a savings 
account generating over 20 percent per year. This is dangerous thinking! If 
your investments tank, or if you lose your job, you will have financial difficulty 
and that will affect your stock portfolio (you may have to sell some stocks in 
your account just to get money to pay the bills). An emergency fund helps you 
through a temporary cash crunch.

22
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Step 2: List your assets in 
decreasing order of liquidity
Liquid assets aren’t references to beer or cola (unless you’re Anheuser-
Busch). Instead, liquidity refers to how quickly you can convert a particular 
asset (something you own that has value) into cash. If you know the liquidity 
of your assets, including investments, you have some options when you need 
cash to buy some stock (or pay some bills). All too often, people are short 
on cash and have too much wealth tied up in illiquid investments such as real 
estate. Illiquid is just a fancy way of saying that you don’t have the immediate 
cash to meet a pressing need. (Hey, we’ve all had those moments!) Review 
your assets and take measures to ensure that enough of them are liquid 
(along with your illiquid assets).
 
Listing your assets in order of liquidity on your balance sheet gives you an 
immediate picture of which assets you can quickly convert to cash and which 
ones you can’t. If you need money now, you can see that cash in hand, your 
checking account, and your savings account are at the top of the list. The 
items last in order of liquidity become obvious; they’re things like real estate 
and other assets that can take a long time to convert to cash.
 
Selling real estate, even in a seller’s market, can take months. Investors who 
don’t have adequate liquid assets run the danger of selling assets quickly 
and possibly at a loss because they scramble to accumulate the cash for 
their short-term financial obligations. For stock investors, this scramble may 
include prematurely selling stocks that they originally intended to use as long-
term investments.
Table 2-1 shows a typical list of assets in order of liquidity. Use it as a guide 
for making your own asset list.

Here’s how to break down the information in Table 2-1:
 
✓ The first column describes the asset. You can quickly convert current 
assets to cash — they’re more liquid; long-term assets have value, but you 
can’t necessarily convert them to cash quickly — they aren’t very liquid.
 
 
Please take note — I have stocks listed as short-term in the table. The 
reason is that this balance sheet is meant to list items in order of liquid-
ity. Liquidity is best embodied in the question, “How quickly can I turn 
this asset into cash?” Because a stock can be sold and converted to cash 
very quickly, it’s a good example of a liquid asset. (However, that’s not 
the main purpose for buying stocks.)
 
✓ The second column gives the current market value for that item. Keep 
in mind that this value isn’t the purchase price or original value; it’s the 
amount you would realistically get if you sold the asset in the current 
market at that moment.
 
✓ The third column tells you how well that investment is doing, compared 
to one year ago. If the percentage rate is 5 percent, that item increased 
in value by 5 percent from a year ago. You need to know how well all 
your assets are doing. Why? To adjust your assets for maximum growth 
or to get rid of assets that are losing money. Assets that are doing well 
are kept (consider increasing your holdings in these assets), and assets 
that are down in value should be scrutinized to see whether they’re can-
didates for removal. Perhaps you can sell them and reinvest the money 
elsewhere. In addition, the realized loss has tax benefits (see Chapter 21).

24
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
 
 Figuring the annual growth rate (in the third column) as a percentage 
isn’t difficult. Say that you buy 100 shares of the stock Gro-A-Lot Corp. 
(GAL), and its market value on December 31, 2007, is $50 per share for 
a total market value of $5,000 (100 shares × $50 per share). When you 
check its value on December 31, 2008, you find out that the stock is 
at $60 per share for a total market value of $6,000 (100 shares × $60). 
The annual growth rate is 20 percent. You calculate this by taking the 
amount of the gain ($60 per share less $50 per share = $10 gain per 
share), which is $1,000 (100 shares times the $10 gain), and dividing it 
by the value at the beginning of the time period ($5,000). In this case, 
you get 20 percent ($1,000 ÷ $5,000).
 
 What if GAL also generates a dividend of $2 per share during that period — 
now what? In that case, GAL generates a total return of 24 percent. To cal-
culate the total return, add the appreciation ($10 per share × 100 shares 
= $1,000) and the dividend income ($2 per share × 100 shares = $200) and 
divide that sum ($1,000 + $200, or $1,200) by the value at the beginning 
of the year ($50 per share × 100 shares, or $5,000). The total is $1,200 ÷ 
$5,000, or 24 percent.
 
✓ The last line lists the total for all the assets and their current market 
value.
Step 3: List your liabilities
Liabilities are simply the bills that you’re obligated to pay. Whether it’s a 
credit card bill or a mortgage payment, a liability is an amount of money you 
have to pay back eventually (usually with interest). If you don’t keep track of 
your liabilities, you may end up thinking that you have more money than you 
really do.
Table 2-2 lists some common liabilities. Use it as a model when you list your 
own. You should list the liabilities according to how soon you need to pay 
them. Credit card balances tend to be short-term obligations, while mort-
gages are long-term.

 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals
Here’s a summary of the information in Table 2-2:
 
✓ The first column names the type of debt. Don’t forget to include student 
loans and auto loans if you have them.
 
 Never avoid listing a liability because you’re embarrassed to see how 
much you really owe. Be honest with yourself — doing so helps you 
improve your financial health.
 
✓ The second column shows the current value (or current balance) of 
your liabilities. List the most current balance to see where you stand 
with your creditors.
 
✓ The third column reflects how much interest you’re paying for carrying 
that debt. This information is an important reminder about how debt 
can be a wealth zapper. Credit card debt can have an interest rate of 18 
percent or more, and to add insult to injury, it isn’t even tax-deductible. 
Using a credit card to make even a small purchase costs you if you don’t 
pay off the balance each month. Within a year, a $50 sweater at 18 per-
cent costs $59 when you add in the potential interest you pay.
 
If you compare your liabilities in Table 2-2 and your personal assets in Table 
2-1, you may find opportunities to reduce the amount you pay for interest. 
Say, for example, that you pay 15 percent on a credit card balance of $4,000 
but also have a personal asset of $5,000 in a bank savings account that’s earn-
ing 2 percent in interest. In that case, you may want to consider taking $4,000 
out of the savings account to pay off the credit card balance. Doing so saves 
you $520; the $4,000 in the bank was earning only $80 (2 percent of $4,000), 
while you were paying $600 on the credit card balance (15 percent of $4,000).
 
If you can’t pay off high-interest debt, at least look for ways to minimize the 
cost of carrying the debt. The most obvious ways include the following:
 
✓ Replace high-interest cards with low-interest cards. Many companies 
offer incentives to consumers, including signing up for cards with favor-
able rates (recently under 10 percent) that can be used to pay off high-
interest cards (typically 12 to 18 percent or higher).
 
✓ Replace unsecured debt with secured debt. Credit cards and personal 
loans are unsecured (you haven’t put up any collateral or other asset to 
secure the debt); therefore, they have higher interest rates because this 
type of debt is considered riskier for the creditor. Sources of secured 
debt (such as home equity line accounts and brokerage accounts) pro-
vide you with a means to replace your high-interest debt with lower-
interest debt. You get lower interest rates with secured debt because it’s 
less risky for the creditor — the debt is backed up by collateral (your 
home or your stocks).

26
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
 
✓ Replace variable-interest debt with fixed-interest debt. Think about 
how homeowners got blindsided when their monthly payments on 
adjustable-rate mortgages went up drastically in the wake of the housing 
bubble that popped during 2005–2008. If you can’t lower your debt, at 
least make it fixed and predictable.
 
The year 2007 was the 11th consecutive year that personal bankruptcies sur-
passed the million mark in the United States. Corporate bankruptcies were 
also at record levels. Due to the fallout of the housing bubble, it’s probably 
safe to say that by the time you read this, 2008 will also join the million-plus 
bankruptcies club, unfortunately. Make a diligent effort to control and reduce 
your debt; otherwise, the debt can become too burdensome. If you don’t 
control it, you may have to sell your stocks just to stay liquid. Remember, 
Murphy’s Law states that you will sell your stock at the worst possible 
moment! Don’t go there.
Step 4: Calculate your net worth
Your net worth is an indication of your total wealth. You can calculate your 
net worth with this basic equation: total assets (Table 2-1) less total liabilities 
(Table 2-2) equal net worth (net assets or net equity).
Table 2-3 shows this equation in action with a net worth of $173,590 — a 
very respectable number. For many investors, just being in a position where 
assets exceed liabilities (a positive net worth) is great news. Use Table 2-3 as 
a model to analyze your own financial situation. Your mission (if you choose 
to accept it — and you should) is to ensure that your net worth increases 
from year to year as you progress toward your financial goals (I discuss 
financial goals later in this chapter).

Step 5: Analyze your balance sheet
Create a balance sheet based on the prior steps in this chapter to illustrate 
your current finances. Take a close look at it and try to identify any changes 
you can make to increase your wealth. Sometimes, reaching your financial 
goals can be as simple as refocusing the items on your balance sheet (use 
Table 2-3 as a general guideline). Here are some brief points to consider:
 
✓ Is the money in your emergency (or rainy day) fund sitting in an ultra-
safe account and earning the highest interest available? Bank money 
market accounts or money market funds are recommended. The safest 
type of account is a U.S. Treasury money market fund. Banks are backed 
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), while U.S. treasury 
securities are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the federal govern-
ment. Shop around for the best rates.
 
✓ Can you replace depreciating assets with appreciating assets? Say that 
you have two stereo systems. Why not sell one and invest the proceeds? 
You may say, “But I bought that unit two years ago for $500, and if I sell 
it now, I’ll get only $300.” That’s your choice. You need to decide what 
helps your financial situation more — a $500 item that keeps shrink-
ing in value (a depreciating asset) or $300 that can grow in value when 
invested (an appreciating asset).
I owe, I owe, so off to work I go
One reason you continue to work is probably so 
that you can pay off your bills. But many people 
today are losing their jobs because their com-
pany owes, too!
Debt is one of the biggest financial problems 
in America today. Companies and individuals 
holding excessive debt contributed to the stock 
market’s massive decline in 2000 and the U.S. 
recession in 2001. If individuals managed their 
personal liabilities more responsibly, the gen-
eral economy would be much better off.
One reason the U.S. appeared to be doing so 
well during the late 1990s was the fact that 
individuals and organizations went on an 
unprecedented spending binge, financed 
mostly by excessive debt. The economy looked 
unstoppable. However, sooner or later you 
have to pay the piper. Stock prices may go up 
and down, but debt stays up until it’s either 
paid down or the debtor files for bankruptcy. 
As of the first quarter of 2008, U.S. debt has 
surpassed a mind-boggling $49 trillion, which 
means that consumers, businesses, and gov-
ernments will continue dealing with challeng-
ing times through this decade and into the next. 
Yes, the stock market (and the stocks in your 
portfolio) will be affected!

28
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
 
✓ Can you replace low-yield investments with high-yield investments? 
Maybe you have $5,000 in a bank certificate of deposit (CD) earning 
3 percent. You can certainly shop around for a better rate at another 
bank, but you can also seek alternatives that can offer a higher yield, 
such as U.S. savings bonds or short-term bond funds. Just remember 
that if you already have a CD and you withdraw the funds before it 
matures, you may face a penalty (such as losing some interest).
 
✓ Can you pay off any high-interest debt with funds from low-interest 
assets? If, for example, you have $5,000 earning 2 percent in a taxable 
bank account, and you have $2,500 on a credit card charging 18 percent 
(nondeductible), you may as well pay off the credit card balance and 
save on the interest.
 
✓ If you’re carrying debt, are you using that money for an investment 
return that’s greater than the interest you’re paying? Carrying a loan 
with an interest rate of 8 percent is acceptable if that borrowed money 
is yielding more than 8 percent elsewhere. Suppose that you have $6,000 
in cash in a brokerage account. If you qualify, you can actually make a 
stock purchase greater than $6,000 by using margin (essentially a loan 
from the broker). You can buy $12,000 of stock using your $6,000 in 
cash, with the remainder financed by the broker. Of course, you pay 
interest on that margin loan. But what if the interest rate is 6 percent 
and the stock you’re about to invest in has a dividend that yields 9 per-
cent? In that case, the dividend can help you pay off the margin loan, 
and you keep the additional income. (For more on buying on margin, see 
Chapter 18.)
 
✓ Can you sell any personal stuff for cash? You can replace unproductive 
assets with cash from garage sales and auction Web sites.
 
✓ Can you use your home equity to pay off consumer debt? Borrowing 
against your home has more favorable interest rates, and this interest is 
still tax-deductible. (Be careful about your debt level. See Chapter 24 for 
warnings on debt and other concerns.)
 
 Paying off consumer debt by using funds borrowed against your home is 
a great way to wipe the slate clean. What a relief to get rid of your credit 
card balances! Just don’t turn around and run up the consumer debt 
again. You can get overburdened and experience financial ruin (not to 
mention homelessness). Not a pretty picture.
The important point to remember is that you can take control of your 
finances with discipline (and with the advice I offer in this book).

29
 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals
Funding Your Stock Program
If you’re going to invest money in stocks, the first thing you need is . . . 
money! Where can you get that money? If you’re waiting for an inheritance to 
come through, you may have to wait a long time, considering all the advances 
being made in healthcare lately. What’s that? You were going to invest in 
healthcare stocks? How ironic. Yet, the challenge still comes down to how to 
fund your stock program.
Many investors can reallocate their investments and assets to do the trick. 
Reallocating simply means selling some investments or other assets and rein-
vesting that money into something else (such as stocks). It boils down to decid-
ing what investment or asset you can sell or liquidate. Generally, you want 
to consider those investments and assets that give you a low return on your 
money (or no return at all). If you have a complicated mix of investments and 
assets, you may want to consider reviewing your options with a financial plan-
ner. Reallocation is just part of the answer; your cash flow is the other part.
Ever wonder why there’s so much month left at the end of the money? 
Consider your cash flow. Your cash flow refers to what money is coming in 
(income) and what money is being spent (outgo). The net result is either a 
positive cash flow or a negative cash flow, depending on your cash manage-
ment skills. Maintaining a positive cash flow (more money coming in than 
going out) helps you increase your net worth. A negative cash flow ultimately 
depletes your wealth and wipes out your net worth if you don’t turn it around 
immediately. The following sections show you how to analyze your cash flow. 
The first step is to do a cash flow statement. With a cash flow statement, you 
ask yourself three questions:
 
✓ What money is coming in? In your cash flow statement, jot down all 
sources of income. Calculate income for the month and then for the 
year. Include everything: salary, wages, interest, dividends, and so on. 
Add them all up and get your grand total for income.
 
✓ What is your outgo? Write down all the things that you spend money 
on. List all your expenses. If possible, categorize them into essential 
and nonessential. You can get an idea of all the expenses that you can 
reduce without affecting your lifestyle. But before you do that, make as 
complete a list as possible of what you spend your money on.
 
✓ What’s left? If your income is greater than your outgo, you have money 
ready and available for stock investing. No matter how small the amount 
seems, it definitely helps. I’ve seen fortunes built when people started to 
diligently invest as little as $25 to $50 per week or per month. If your outgo 
is greater than your income, you better sharpen your pencil. Cut down on 
nonessential spending and/or increase your income. If your budget is a 
little tight, hold off on your stock investing until your cash flow improves.

Don’t confuse a cash flow statement with an income statement (also called 
a profit and loss statement or an income and expense statement). A cash flow 
statement is simple to calculate because you can easily track what goes in and 
what goes out. Income statements are a little different (especially for busi-
nesses) because they take into account things that aren’t technically cash flow 
(such as depreciation or amortization). Find out more about income state-
ments in Chapter 11.
Step 1: Tally up your income
Using Table 2-4 as a worksheet, list and calculate the money you have coming 
in. The first column describes the source of the money, the second column 
indicates the monthly amount from each respective source, and the last 
column indicates the amount projected for a full year. Include all income, 
such as wages, business income, dividends, interest income, and so on. Then 
project these amounts for a year (multiply by 12) and enter those amounts in 
the third column.

Dot-com-and-go
If you were publishing a book about negative 
cash flow, you could look for the employees of 
any one of 100 dot-com companies to write it. 
Their qualifications include working for a com-
pany that flew sky-high in 1999 and crashed in 
2000 and 2001. Companies such as eToys.com, 
Pets.com, and DrKoop.com were given millions, 
yet they couldn’t turn a profit and eventually 
closed for business. You may as well call them 
“dot-com-and-go.” You can learn from their 
mistakes. (Actually, they could have learned 
from you.) In the same way that profit is the 
most essential single element in a business, a 
positive cash flow is important for your finances 
in general and for funding your stock invest-
ment program in particular.

 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals
 
This is the amount of money you have to work with. To ensure your financial 
health, don’t spend more than this amount. Always be aware of and carefully 
manage your income.
Step 2: Add up your outgo
Using Table 2-5 as a worksheet, list and calculate the money that’s going out. 
How much are you spending and on what? The first column describes the 
source of the expense, the second column indicates the monthly amount, 
and the third column shows the amount projected for a full year. Include 
all the money you spend: credit card and other debt payments; household 
expenses, such as food, utility bills, and medical expenses; and nonessential 
expenses such as video games and elephant-foot umbrella stands.

Payroll taxes is just a category in which to lump all the various taxes that the 
government takes out of your paycheck. Feel free to put each individual tax on 
its own line if you prefer. The important thing is creating a comprehensive list 
that’s meaningful to you.

32
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
 
You may notice that the outgo doesn’t include items such as payments to a 
401(k) plan and other savings vehicles. Yes, these items do impact your cash 
flow, but they’re not expenses; the amounts that you invest (or your employer 
invests for you) are essentially assets that benefit your financial situation 
versus expenses that don’t help you build wealth. To account for the 401(k), 
simply deduct it from the gross pay before you calculate the preceding work-
sheet. If, for example, your gross pay is $2,000 and your 401(k) contribution is 
$300, then use $1,700 as your income figure.
Step 3: Create a cash flow statement
Okay, you’re almost to the end. The last step is creating a cash flow state-
ment so that you can see (all in one place) how your money moves — how 
much comes in and how much goes out and where it goes.
Plug the amount of your total income (from Table 2-4) and the amount of 
your total expenses (from Table 2-5) into the Table 2-6 worksheet to see 
your cash flow. Do you have positive cash flow — more coming in than going 
out — so that you can start investing in stocks (or other investments), or are 
expenses overpowering your income? Doing a cash flow statement isn’t just 
about finding money in your financial situation to fund your stock program. 
First and foremost, it’s about your financial well-being. Are you managing 
your finances well or not?

At the time of this writing, 2008 was shaping up to be yet another record 
year for personal and business bankruptcies. Personal debt and expenses far 
exceeded whatever income they generated. That announcement is another 
reminder to watch your cash flow; keep your income growing and your 
expenses and debt as low as possible.

33
 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals
Step 4: Analyze your cash flow
Use your cash flow statement in Table 2-6 to identify sources of funds for 
your investment program. The more you can increase your income and the 
more you can decrease your outgo, the better. Scrutinize your data. Where 
can you improve the results? Here are some questions to ask yourself:
 
✓ How can you increase your income? Do you have hobbies, interests, or 
skills that can generate extra cash for you?
 
✓ Can you get more paid overtime at work? How about a promotion or a 
job change?
 
✓ Where can you cut expenses?
 
✓ Have you categorized your expenses as either “necessary” or 
“nonessential”?
 
✓ Can you lower your debt payments by refinancing or consolidating loans 
and credit card balances?
 
✓ Have you shopped around for lower insurance or telephone rates?
 
✓ Have you analyzed your tax withholdings in your paycheck to make sure 
that you’re not overpaying your taxes (just to get your overpayment 
back next year as a refund)?
Another option: Finding investment 
money in tax savings
According to the Tax Foundation, the average U.S. citizen pays more in taxes 
than in food, clothing, and shelter combined. Sit down with your tax advi-
sor and try to find ways to reduce your taxes. A home-based business, for 
example, is a great way to gain new income and increase your tax deductions, 
resulting in a lower tax burden. Your tax advisor can make recommendations 
that work for you.
 
One tax strategy to consider is doing your stock investing in a tax-sheltered 
account such as a traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or a Roth 
Individual Retirement Account (Roth IRA). Again, check with your tax advisor 
for deductions and strategies available to you. For more on the tax implica-
tions of stock investing, see Chapter 21.

34
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Setting Your Sights on 
Your Financial Goals
Consider stocks as tools for living, just like any other investment — no more, 
no less. Stocks are the tools you use (one of many) to accomplish something — 
to achieve a goal. Yes, successfully investing in stocks is the goal that you’re 
probably shooting for if you’re reading this book. However, you must complete 
the following sentence: “I want to be successful in my stock investing program 
to accomplish _____.” You must consider stock investing as a means to an end. 
When people buy a computer, they don’t (or shouldn’t) think of buying a com-
puter just to have a computer. People buy a computer because doing so helps 
them achieve a particular result, such as being more efficient in business, play-
ing fun games, or having a nifty paperweight (tsk, tsk).
 
Know the difference between long-term, intermediate-term, and short-term 
goals, and then set some of each (see Chapter 3 for more information).
 
✓ Long-term goals refer to projects or financial goals that need funding five 
or more years from now.
 
✓ Intermediate term refers to financial goals that need funding two to five 
years from now.
 
✓ Short-term goals need funding less than two years from now.
 
Stocks, in general, are best suited for long-term goals such as these:
 
✓ Achieving financial independence (think retirement funding)
 
✓ Paying for future college costs
 
✓ Paying for any long-term expenditure or project
Some categories of stock (such as conservative or large cap) may be suitable 
for intermediate-term financial goals. If, for example, you’ll retire four years 
from now, conservative stocks can be appropriate. If you’re optimistic (or 
bullish) about the stock market and confident that stock prices will rise, go 
ahead and invest. However, if you’re negative about the market (you’re bear-
ish, or you believe that stock prices will decline), you may want to wait until 
the economy starts to forge a clear path. For more on investing in bull or 
bear markets, see Chapter 14.
Stocks generally aren’t suitable for short-term investing goals because stock 
prices can behave irrationally in a short period of time. Stocks fluctuate from 
day to day, so you don’t know what the stock will be worth in the near future. 
You may end up with less money than you expected. For investors seeking to 
reliably accrue money for short-term needs, short-term bank certificates of 
deposit or money market funds are more appropriate.

35
 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals
 
In recent years, investors have sought quick, short-term profits by trading and 
speculating in stocks. Lured by the fantastic returns generated by the stock 
market in the late 1990s, investors saw stocks as a get-rich-quick scheme. It’s 
very important for you to understand the difference between investing, saving, 
and speculating. Which one do you want to do? Knowing the answer to this 
question is crucial to your goals and aspirations. Investors who don’t know 
the difference tend to get burned. Here’s some information to help you distin-
guish among these three actions:
 
✓ Investing is the act of putting your current funds into securities or 
tangible assets for the purpose of gaining future appreciation, income, 
or both. You need time, knowledge, and discipline to invest. The invest-
ment can fluctuate in price, but it has been chosen for long-term potential.
 
✓ Saving is the safe accumulation of funds for a future use. Savings don’t 
fluctuate and are generally free of financial risk. The emphasis is on 
safety and liquidity.
 
✓ Speculating is the financial world’s equivalent of gambling. An inves-
tor who speculates is seeking quick profits gained from short-term price 
movements in a particular asset or investment. (In recent years, many 
folks are trading stocks, which is in the realm of short-term speculating. 
Find out more about trading in Chapter 16.)
These distinctly different concepts are often confused, even among so-called 
financial experts. I know of one financial advisor who actually put a child’s 
college fund money into an Internet stock fund, only to lose over $17,000 in 
less than ten months! This advisor thought that she was investing, but in real-
ity, she was speculating. I know of another advisor who told a client to avoid 
savings accounts altogether because the client had a 401(k) plan. This partic-
ular advisor didn’t catch the crucial difference between saving and investing. 
The client eventually found out the difference; his 401(k) fell by 40 percent 
when the bear market of 2000 arrived.
Fortunately, we can learn from these situations and get back on track. That 
child who lost the $17,000? He’s my neighbor, and I helped the father reinvest 
the remaining funds. The portfolio doubled in value by the following year, 
and it’s still growing. The second fellow who lost 40 percent in his 401(k) 
account? He became my student, he has recouped his losses, and his 401(k) 
plan is up (this occurred within two years). As of 2008, both investors have 
portfolios that are out-performing the general stock market.

In This Chapter

▶ Looking at your purpose for investing: growth versus income
▶ Determining your investing style: conservative versus aggressive
“I
nvesting for the long term” isn’t just some perfunctory investment 
slogan. It’s a culmination of proven stock market experience that goes 
back many decades. Unfortunately, investor buying and selling habits have 
deteriorated in recent years due to impatience. Today’s investors think that 
short term is measured in days, intermediate term is measured in weeks, and 
long term is measured in months. Yeesh! It’s no wonder that so many folks 
are complaining about lousy investment returns. Investors have lost the prof-
itable art of patience!
What should you do? Become an investor with a time horizon greater than 
one year. Give your investments time to grow. Everybody dreams about 
emulating the success of someone like Warren Buffett, but few emulate his 
patience (a huge part of his investment success).
Stocks are tools you can use to build your wealth. When used wisely, for the 
right purpose, and in the right environment, they do a great job. But when 
improperly applied, they can lead to disaster. In this chapter, I show you how 
to choose the right types of investments based on your short- and long-term 
financial goals. I also show you how to decide on your purpose for investing 
(growth or income investing) and your style of investing (conservative or 
aggressive).

38
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Matching Stocks and Strategies 
with Your Goals
Various stocks are out there, as well as various investment approaches. The 
key to success in the stock market is matching the right kind of stock with 
the right kind of investment situation. You have to choose the stock and the 
approach that match your goals. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more on defining 
your financial goals.)
Before investing in a stock, ask yourself, “When do I want to reach my finan-
cial goal?” Stocks are a means to an end. Your job is to figure out what that 
end is — or, more important, when it is. Do you want to retire in ten years 
or next year? Must you pay for your kid’s college education next year or 18 
years from now? The length of time you have before you need the money you 
hope to earn from stock investing determines what stocks you should buy. 
Table 3-1 gives you some guidelines for choosing the kind of stock best suited 
for the type of investor you are and the goals you have.

Well . . . you can invest in stocks 
for less than a year, but seriously,

16) or speculating (see Chapter 
2). Instead, use savings accounts 
and money market funds.

 Chapter 3: Defining Common Approaches to Stock Investing
 
Dividends are payments made to a stock owner (unlike interest, which is pay-
ment to a creditor). Dividends are a great form of income, and companies that 
issue dividends tend to have more stable stock prices as well. For more infor-
mation on dividend-paying stocks, see the section “Steadily making money: 
Income investing,” later in this chapter, and also see Chapter 9.
 
Table 3-1 gives you general guidelines, but not everyone fits into a particular 
profile. Every investor has a unique situation, set of goals, and level of risk tol-
erance. The terms large cap, mid cap, and small cap refer to the size (or market 
capitalization, also known as market cap) of the company. All factors being 
equal, large companies are safer (less risky) than small companies. For more 
on market caps, see the section “Investing for Your Personal Style,” later in 
this chapter.
Investing for the Future
Are your goals long term or short term? Answering this question is important 
because individual stocks can be either great or horrible choices, depending 
on the time period you want to focus on. Generally, the length of time you 
plan to invest in stocks can be short term, intermediate term, or long term. 
The following sections outline what kinds of stocks are most appropriate for 
each term length.
 
Investing in quality stocks becomes less risky as the time frame lengthens. 
Stock prices tend to fluctuate on a daily basis, but they have a tendency to 
trend up or down over an extended period of time. Even if you invest in a 
stock that goes down in the short term, you’re likely to see it rise and possi-
bly exceed your investment if you have the patience to wait it out and let the 
stock price appreciate.
Focusing on the short term
Short term generally means one year or less, although some people extend 
the period to two years or less. Short-term investing isn’t about making a 
quick buck on your stock choices — it refers to when you may need the 
money.
Every person has short-term goals. Some are modest, such as setting aside 
money for a vacation next month or paying for medical bills. Other short-
term goals are more ambitious, such as accruing funds for a down payment 
to purchase a new home within six months. Whatever the expense or pur-
chase, you need a predictable accumulation of cash soon. If this sounds like 
your situation, stay away from the stock market!

40
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
 
Because stocks can be so unpredictable in the short term, they’re a bad 
choice for short-term considerations. I get a kick out of market analysts on 
TV saying things such as, “At $25 a share, XYZ is a solid investment, and we 
feel that its stock should hit our target price of $40 within six to nine months.” 
You know that an eager investor hears that and says, “Gee, why bother with 3 
percent at the bank when this stock will rise by more than 50 percent? I better 
call my broker.” It may hit that target amount (or surpass it), or it may not. 
Most of the time, the stock doesn’t reach the target price, and the investor is 
disappointed. The stock could even go down!
The reason that target prices are frequently missed is that it’s difficult to 
figure out what millions of investors will do in the short term. The short term 
can be irrational because so many investors have so many reasons for buying 
and selling that it can be difficult to analyze. If you invest for an important 
short-term need, you could lose very important cash quicker than you think.
 
During the raging bull market (see more about bull markets in Chapter 14) of 
the late 1990s, investors watched as some high-profile stocks went up 20 to 
50 percent in a matter of months. Hey, who needs a savings account earning 
a measly interest rate when stocks grow like that! Of course, when the bear 
market hit from 2000 to 2003 and those same stocks fell 50 to 85 percent, a 
savings account earning a measly interest rate suddenly didn’t seem so bad.
 
Short-term stock investing is very unpredictable. Stocks — even the best 
ones — fluctuate in the short term. In a negative environment, they can be 
very volatile. No one can accurately predict the price movement (unless he 
or she has some inside information), so stocks are definitely inappropriate 
for any financial goal you need to reach within one year. You can better serve 
your short-term goals with stable, interest-bearing investments like certifi-
cates of deposit at your local bank. Check Table 3-1 for suggestions about your 
short-term strategies.
Considering intermediate-term goals
Intermediate term refers to the financial goals you plan to reach within five 
years. For example, if you want to accumulate funds to put money down for 
investment in real estate four years from now, some growth-oriented invest-
ments may be suitable. (I discuss growth investing in more detail later in this 
chapter.)
Although some stocks may be appropriate for a two- or three-year period, 
not all stocks are good intermediate-term investments. Some stocks are fairly 
stable and hold their value well, such as the stock of large or established 
dividend-paying companies. Other stocks have prices that jump all over the 
place, such as those of untested companies that haven’t been in existence 
long enough to develop a consistent track record.

41
 Chapter 3: Defining Common Approaches to Stock Investing
 
If you plan to invest in the stock market to meet intermediate-term goals, 
consider large, established companies or dividend-paying companies in indus-
tries that provide the necessities of life (like the food and beverage industry, 
or electric utilities). In today’s economic environment, I strongly believe that 
stocks attached to companies that serve basic human needs should have a 
major presence in most stock portfolios. They’re especially well-suited for 
intermediate investment goals.
 
Just because a particular stock is labeled as being appropriate for the inter-
mediate term doesn’t mean you should get rid of it by the stroke of midnight 
five years from now. After all, if the company is doing well and going strong, 
you can continue holding the stock indefinitely. The more time you give a well-
positioned, profitable company’s stock to grow, the better you’ll do.
Preparing for the long term
Stock investing is best suited for making money over a long period of time. 
When you measure stocks against other investments in terms of five to (pref-
erably) ten or more years, they excel. Even investors who bought stocks 
during the depths of the Great Depression saw profitable growth in their 
stock portfolios over a ten-year period. In fact, if you examine any ten-year 
period over the past fifty years, you see that stocks beat out other financial 
investments (such as bonds or bank investments) in almost every period 
when measured by total return (taking into account reinvesting and com-
pounding of capital gains and dividends)!
Of course, your work doesn’t stop at deciding on a long-term investment. 
You still have to do your homework and choose stocks wisely, because even 
in good times, you can lose money if you invest in companies that go out of 
Short-term investing = speculating
My case files are littered with examples of 
long-term stock investors who morphed into 
short-term speculators. I know of one fellow 
who had $80,000 and was set to get married 
within 12 months and then put a down pay-
ment on a new home for him and his bride. He 
wanted to surprise her by growing his nest egg 
quickly so they could have a glitzier wedding 
and a larger down payment. What happened? 
The money instead shrunk to $11,000 as his 
stock choices pulled back sharply. Ouch! How 
does that go again? For better or for worse . . . 
uh . . . for richer or for poorer? I’m sure they had 
to adjust their plans accordingly. I recall some 
of the stocks he chose, and now, years later, 
those stocks have recovered and gone on to 
new highs.
The bottom line is that investing in stocks for 
the short term is nothing more than speculating. 
Your only possible strategy is luck.

business. Part III of this book shows you how to evaluate specific companies 
and industries and alerts you to factors in the general economy that can affect 
stock behavior. Appendix A provides plenty of resources you can turn to.
 
Because so many different types and categories of stocks are available, virtu-
ally any investor with a long-term perspective should add stocks to his invest-
ment portfolio. Whether you want to save for a young child’s college fund or 
for future retirement goals, carefully selected stocks have proven to be a supe-
rior long-term investment.
Investing for a Purpose
When someone asked the lady why she bungee jumped off the bridge that 
spanned a massive ravine, she answered, “Because it’s fun!” When someone 
asked the fellow why he dove into a pool chock-full of alligators and snakes, 
he responded, “Because someone pushed me.” You shouldn’t invest in stocks 
unless you have a purpose that you understand, like investing for growth or 
investing for income. Even if an advisor pushes you to invest, be sure that your 
advisor gives you an explanation of how each stock choice fits your purpose.
I know of a very nice, elderly lady who had a portfolio brimming with 
aggressive-growth stocks because she had an overbearing broker. Her pur-
pose should’ve been conservative, and she should’ve chosen investments 
that would preserve her wealth rather than grow it. Obviously, the broker’s 
agenda got in the way.
Stocks are just a means to an end. Figure out your desired end and then match 
the means. To find out more about dealing with brokers, go to Chapter 7.
Making loads of money quickly: 
Growth investing
When investors want their money to grow (versus just trying to preserve it), 
they look for investments that appreciate in value. Appreciate is just another 
way of saying grow. If you bought a stock for $8 per share and now its value 
is $30 per share, your investment has grown by $22 per share — that’s appre-
ciation. I know I would appreciate it.

43
 Chapter 3: Defining Common Approaches to Stock Investing
Appreciation (also known as capital gain) is probably the number one reason 
people invest in stocks. Few investments have the potential to grow your 
wealth as conveniently as stocks. If you want the stock market to make you 
loads of money (and you can assume some risk), head to Chapter 8, which 
takes an in-depth look at investing for growth.
 
Stocks are a great way to grow your wealth, but they’re not the only way. 
Many investors seek alternative ways to make money, but many of these alter-
native ways are more aggressive than stocks and carry significantly more risk. 
You may have heard about people who made quick fortunes in areas such as 
commodities (like wheat, pork bellies, or precious metals), options, and other 
more sophisticated investment vehicles. Keep in mind that you should limit 
these more risky investments to only a small portion of your portfolio, such as 
10 percent of your investable funds. Experienced investors, however, can go 
as high as 20 percent.
Steadily making money: Income investing
Not all investors want to take on the risk that comes with making a killing. 
(Hey . . . no guts, no glory!) Some people just want to invest in the stock 
market as a means of providing a steady income. They don’t need stock 
values to go through the ceiling. Instead, they need stocks that perform well 
consistently.
If your purpose for investing in stocks is to create income, you need to 
choose stocks that pay dividends. Dividends are typically paid quarterly to 
stockholders on record as of specific dates. How do you know if the dividend 
you’re being paid is higher (or lower) than other vehicles (such as bonds)? 
The next sections will help you figure it out.
Distinguishing between dividends and interest
Don’t confuse dividends with interest. Most people are familiar with interest 
because that’s how you grow your money over the years in the bank. The 
important difference is that interest is paid to creditors, and dividends are 
paid to owners (meaning shareholders — and if you own stock you’re a share-
holder because shares of stock represent ownership in a publicly traded 
company).
 
When you buy stock, you buy a piece of that company. When you put money 
in a bank (or when you buy bonds), you basically loan your money. You 
become a creditor, and the bank or bond issuer is the debtor, and as such, it 
must eventually pay your money back to you with interest.

44
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Recognizing the importance of an income stock’s yield
When you invest for income, you have to consider your investment’s yield 
and compare it with the alternatives. The yield is an investment’s payout 
expressed as a percentage of the investment amount. Looking at the yield is a 
way to compare the income you expect to receive from one investment with 
the expected income from others. Table 3-2 shows some comparative yields.

To calculate yield, use the following formula:
Yield = Payout ÷ Investment amount
For the sake of simplicity, the following exercise is based on an annual per-
centage yield basis (compounding would increase the yield).
Jones Co. and Smith Co. are typical dividend-paying stocks. Looking at Table 
3-2 and presuming that both companies are similar in most respects except 
for their differing dividends, how can you tell whether the $50 stock with a 
$2.50 annual dividend is better (or worse) than the $100 stock with a $4.00 
dividend? The yield tells you.
Even though Jones Co. pays a higher dividend ($4.00), Smith Co. has a higher 
yield (5 percent). Therefore, if you had to choose between those two stocks 
as an income investor, you would choose Smith Co. Of course, if you truly 
want to maximize your income and don’t really need your investment to 
appreciate a lot, you should probably choose Brown Co.’s bond because it 
offers a yield of 6 percent.
 
Dividend-paying stocks do have the ability to increase in value. They may not 
have the same growth potential as growth stocks, but at the very least, they 
have a greater potential for capital gain than CDs or bonds. Dividend-paying 
stocks (investing for income) are covered in Chapter 9.

 Chapter 3: Defining Common Approaches to Stock Investing
Investing for Your Personal Style
Your investing style isn’t a blue-jeans-versus-three-piece-suit debate. It refers 
to your approach to stock investing. Do you want to be conservative or 
aggressive? Would you rather be the tortoise or the hare? Your investment 
personality greatly depends on your purpose and the term over which you’re 
planning to invest (see the previous two sections in this chapter). The follow-
ing sections outline the two most general investment styles.
Conservative investing
Conservative investing means that you put your money in something proven, 
tried, and true. You invest your money in safe and secure places, such as 
banks and government-backed securities. But how does that apply to stocks? 
(Table 3-1 gives you suggestions.)
If you’re a conservative stock investor, you want to place your money in com-
panies that exhibit some of the following qualities:
 
✓ Proven performance: You want companies that have shown increasing 
sales and earnings year after year. You don’t demand anything 
spectacular — just a strong and steady performance.
 
✓ Large market size: You want to invest in large cap companies (short for 
large capitalization). In other words, they should have a market value 
exceeding $5–$25 billion. Conservative investors surmise that bigger is 
safer.
 
✓ Proven market leadership: Look for companies that are leaders in their 
industries.
 
✓ Perceived staying power: You want companies with the financial clout 
and market position to weather uncertain market and economic condi-
tions. It shouldn’t matter what happens in the economy or who gets 
elected.
 
As a conservative investor, you don’t mind if the companies’ share prices 
jump (who would?), but you’re more concerned with steady growth over the 
long term.

Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Aggressive investing
Aggressive investors can plan long term or look over only the intermediate 
term, but in any case, they want stocks that resemble jack rabbits — those 
that show the potential to break out of the pack.
If you’re an aggressive stock investor, you want to invest your money in com-
panies that exhibit some of the following qualities:
 
✓ Great potential: Choose companies that have superior goods, services, 
ideas, or ways of doing business compared to the competition.
 
✓ Capital gains possibility: Don’t even consider dividends. If anything, you 
dislike dividends. You feel that the money dispensed in dividend form is 
better reinvested in the company. This, in turn, can spur greater growth.
 
✓ Innovation: Find companies that have innovative technologies, ideas, or 
methods that make them stand apart from other companies.
 
Aggressive investors usually seek out small capitalization stocks, known as 
small caps, because they can have plenty of potential for growth. Take the tree 
example, for instance: A giant redwood may be strong, but it may not grow 
much more, whereas a brand-new sapling has plenty of growth to look for-
ward to. Why invest in big, stodgy companies when you can invest in smaller 
enterprises that may become the leaders of tomorrow? Aggressive investors 
have no problem buying stock in obscure businesses because they hope that 
such companies will become another IBM or McDonald’s. Find out more about 
growth investing in Chapter 8.

Recognizing the Risks

▶ Taking steps to reduce your risk
▶ Balancing risk against return
I
nvestors face many risks, most of which I cover in this chapter. The sim-
plest definition of risk for investors is “the possibility that your invest-
ment will lose some (or all) of its value.” Yet you don’t have to fear risk if you 
understand it and plan for it. You must understand the oldest equation in the 
world of investing — risk versus return. This equation states the following:
If you want a greater return on your money, you need to tolerate more 
risk. If you don’t want to tolerate more risk, you must tolerate a lower 
rate of return.
This point about risk is best illustrated from a moment in one of my invest-
ment seminars. One of the attendees told me that he had his money in the 
bank but was dissatisfied with the rate of return. He lamented, “The yield 
on my money is pitiful! I want to put my money somewhere where it can 
grow.” I asked him, “How about investing in common stocks? Or what about 
growth mutual funds? They have a solid, long-term growth track record.” He 
responded, “Stocks? I don’t want to put my money there. It’s too risky!” Okay, 
then. If you don’t want to tolerate more risk, then don’t complain about earn-
ing less on your money. Risk (in all its forms) has a bearing on all your money 
concerns and goals. That’s why it’s so important that you understand risk 
before you invest.
This man — as well as the rest of us — needs to remember that risk is not a 
four-letter word. (Well, it is a four-letter word, but you know what I mean.) 
Risk is present no matter what you do with your money. Even if you simply 
stick your money in your mattress, risk is involved — several kinds of risk, in 

48
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
fact. You have the risk of fire. What if your house burns down? You have the 
risk of theft. What if burglars find your stash of cash? You also have relative 
risk. (In other words, what if your relatives find your money?)
Be aware of the different kinds of risk that I describe in this chapter, and you 
can easily plan around them to keep your money growing.
Exploring Different Kinds of Risk
Think about all the ways that an investment can lose money. You can list all 
sorts of possibilities. So many that you may think, “Holy cow! Why invest at all?”
Don’t let risk frighten you. After all, life itself is risky. Just make sure that you 
understand the different kinds of risk that I discuss in the following sections 
before you start navigating the investment world. Be mindful of risk and find 
out about the effects of risk on your investments and personal financial goals.
Financial risk
The financial risk of stock investing is that you can lose your money if the 
company whose stock you purchase loses money or goes belly up. This type 
of risk is the most obvious because companies do go bankrupt.
 
You can greatly enhance the chances of your financial risk paying off by doing 
an adequate amount of research and choosing your stocks carefully (which 
this book helps you do — see Part III for details). Financial risk is a real con-
cern even when the economy is doing well. Some diligent research, a little 
planning, and a dose of common sense help you reduce your financial risk.
In the stock investing mania of the late 1990s, millions of investors (along with 
many well-known investment gurus) ignored some obvious financial risks of 
many then-popular stocks. Investors blindly plunked their money into stocks 
that were bad choices. Consider investors who put their money in DrKoop.
com, a health information Web site, in 1999 and held on during 2000. This 
company had no profit and was over-indebted. DrKoop.com went into cardiac 
arrest as it collapsed from $45 per share to $2 per share by mid-2000. By the 
time the stock was DOA, investors lost millions. RIP (risky investment play!).
Internet and tech stocks littered the graveyard of stock market catastrophes 
during 2000–2001 because investors didn’t see (or didn’t want to see?) the 
risks involved with companies that didn’t offer a solid record of results (prof-
its, sales, and so on). When you invest in companies that don’t have a proven 
track record, you’re not investing, you’re speculating.

49
 Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks
Fast forward to 2007–2008. New risks abound as the headlines rail on about the 
credit crisis on Wall Street and the subprime fiasco in the wake of the housing 
bubble popping. Think about how this crisis impacted investors as the market 
went through its stomach-churning roller-coaster ride. A good example of a 
casualty you didn’t want to be a part of was Bear Stearns (BSC), which was 
caught in the subprime buzz saw. Bear Stearns was sky-high at $170 a share 
in early 2007, yet it crashed to $2 a share by March 2008. Yikes! Its problems 
arose from massive overexposure to bad debt, and investors could have done 
some research (the public data was revealing!) and avoided the stock entirely.
Investors who did their homework regarding the financial conditions of com-
panies such as the Internet stocks (and Bear Stearns, among others) would 
have discovered that these companies had the hallmarks of financial risk — 
high debt, low (or no) earnings, and plenty of competition. They steered 
clear, avoiding tremendous financial loss. Investors who didn’t do their 
homework were lured by the status of these companies and lost their shirts.
Of course, the individual investors who lost money by investing in these 
trendy, high-profile companies don’t deserve all the responsibility for their 
tremendous financial losses; some high-profile analysts and media sources also 
should have known better. The late 1990s may someday be a case study of how 
euphoria and the herd mentality (rather than good, old-fashioned research 
and common sense) ruled the day (temporarily). The excitement of making 
potential fortunes gets the best of people sometimes, and they throw caution 
to the wind. Historians may look back at those days and say, “What were they 
thinking?” Achieving true wealth takes diligent work and careful analysis.
 
In terms of financial risk, the bottom line is . . . well . . . the bottom line! A 
healthy bottom line means that a company is making money. And if a com-
pany is making money, then you can make money by investing in its stock. 
However, if a company isn’t making money, you won’t make money if you 
invest in it. Profit is the lifeblood of any company. See Chapter 11 for the 
scoop on determining whether a company’s bottom line is healthy.
Interest rate risk
 
You can lose money in an apparently sound investment because of something 
that sounds as harmless as “interest rates have changed.” Interest rate risk 
may sound like an odd type of risk, but in fact, it’s a common consideration 
for investors. Be aware that interest rates change on a regular basis, causing 
some challenging moments. Banks set interest rates, and the primary institu-
tion to watch closely is the Federal Reserve (the Fed), which is, in effect, the 
country’s central bank. The Fed raises or lowers its interest rates, actions 
that, in turn, cause banks to raise or lower interest rates accordingly. Interest 
rate changes affect consumers, businesses, and, of course, investors.

50
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Here’s a generic introduction to the way fluctuating interest rate risk can 
affect investors in general: Suppose that you buy a long-term, high-quality 
corporate bond and get a yield of 6 percent. Your money is safe, and your 
return is locked in at 6 percent. Whew! That’s 6 percent. Not bad, huh? But 
what happens if, after you commit your money, interest rates increase to 8 
percent? You lose the opportunity to get that extra 2 percent interest. The 
only way to get out of your 6 percent bond is to sell it at current market 
values and use the money to reinvest at the higher rate.
The only problem with this scenario is that the 6 percent bond is likely to 
drop in value because interest rates rose. Why? Say that the investor is Bob 
and the bond yielding 6 percent is a corporate bond issued by Lucin-Muny 
(LM). According to the bond agreement, LM must pay 6 percent (called the 
face rate or nominal rate) during the life of the bond and then, upon maturity, 
pay the principal. If Bob buys $10,000 of LM bonds on the day they’re issued, 
he gets $600 (of interest) every year for as long as he holds the bonds. If he 
holds on until maturity, he gets back his $10,000 (the principal). So far so 
good, right? The plot thickens, however.
Say that he decides to sell the bond long before maturity and that, at the time 
of the sale, interest rates in the market have risen to 8 percent. Now what? The 
reality is that no one is going to want his 6 percent bond if the market is offer-
ing bonds at 8 percent. What’s Bob to do? He can’t change the face rate of 6 
percent, and he can’t change the fact that only $600 is paid each year for the 
life of the bond. What has to change so that current investors get the equivalent 
yield of 8 percent? If you said, “The bond’s value has to go down,” . . . bingo! In 
this example, the bond’s market value needs to drop to $7,500 so that investors 
buying the bond get an equivalent yield of 8 percent. (For simplicity’s sake, I 
left out the time it takes for the bond to mature.) Here’s how that figures:
New investors still get $600 annually. However, $600 is equal to 8 percent of 
$7,500. Therefore, even though investors get the face rate of 6 percent, they 
get a yield of 8 percent because the actual investment amount is $7,500. In 
this example, little, if any, financial risk is present, but you see how interest 
rate risk presents itself. Bob finds out that you can have a good company 
with a good bond, yet you still lose $2,500 because of the change in the inter-
est rate. Of course, if Bob doesn’t sell, he doesn’t realize that loss. (For more 
on the how and why of selling your stock, review Chapters 17 and 18.)
 
Historically, rising interest rates have had an adverse effect on stock prices. I 
outline several reasons why in the following sections. Because our country is 
top-heavy in debt, rising interest rates are an obvious risk that threatens both 
stocks and fixed-income securities (such as bonds).

51
 Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks
Hurting a company’s financial condition
Rising interest rates have a negative impact on companies that carry a large 
current debt load or that need to take on more debt, because when interest 
rates rise, the cost of borrowing money rises, too. Ultimately, the company’s 
profitability and ability to grow are reduced. When a company’s profits (or 
earnings) drop, its stock becomes less desirable, and its stock price falls.
Affecting a company’s customers
A company’s success comes when it sells its products or services. But what 
happens if increased interest rates negatively impact its customers (specifi-
cally, other companies that buy from it)? The financial health of its custom-
ers directly affects the company’s ability to grow sales and earnings.
For a good example, consider Home Depot (HD) during 2005–2008. The com-
pany had soaring sales and earnings during 2005 and into early 2006 as the 
housing boom hit its high point (record sales, construction, and so on). As 
the housing bubble popped and the housing and construction industries 
went into an agonizing decline, the fortunes of Home Depot followed suit 
because its success is directly tied to home building, repair, and improve-
ment. By late 2006, HD’s sales were slipping and earnings were dropping as 
the housing industry sunk deeper into its depression. This was bad news for 
stock investors. HD’s stock went from over $44 in 2005 to $21 by October 
2008 (a drop of about 52 percent). Ouch! No “home improvement” there.
Impacting investors’ decision-making considerations
When interest rates rise, investors start to rethink their investment strate-
gies, resulting in one of two outcomes:
 
✓ Investors may sell any shares in interest-sensitive stocks that they hold. 
Interest-sensitive industries include electric utilities, real estate, and the 
financial sector. Although increased interest rates can hurt these sec-
tors, the reverse is also generally true: Falling interest rates boost the 
same industries. Keep in mind that interest rate changes affect some 
industries more than others.
 
✓ Investors who favor increased current income (versus waiting for the 
investment to grow in value to sell for a gain later on) are definitely 
attracted to investment vehicles that offer a higher yield. Higher interest 
rates can cause investors to switch from stocks to bonds or bank certifi-
cates of deposit.

52
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Hurting stock prices indirectly
High or rising interest rates can have a negative impact on any investor’s total 
financial picture. What happens when an investor struggles with burdensome 
debt, such as a second mortgage, credit card debt, or margin debt (debt from 
borrowing against stock in a brokerage account)? He may sell some stock 
to pay off some of his high-interest debt. Selling stock to service debt is a 
common practice that, when taken collectively, can hurt stock prices.
As this book goes to press, the stock market and the U.S. economy face 
perhaps the greatest challenge since the Great Depression — debt. In terms 
of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the size of the economy is about $14 tril-
lion (give or take $100 billion), but the debt level is about $49 trillion (this 
includes personal, corporate, mortgage, and government debt). This already 
enormous amount doesn’t include $53 trillion of liabilities such as Social 
Security and Medicare. Additionally (Yikes! There’s more?), some of our 
financial institutions hold over $100 trillion worth of derivatives. These can 
be very complicated and sophisticated investment vehicles that can backfire. 
Derivatives have, in fact, sunk some large organizations (such as Enron and 
Bear Stearns), and investors should be aware of them. Just check out the 
company’s financial reports. (Find out more in Chapter 12.)
 
Because of the effects of interest rates on stock portfolios, both direct and 
indirect, successful investors regularly monitor interest rates in both the gen-
eral economy and in their personal situations. Although stocks have proven 
to be a superior long-term investment (the longer the term, the better), every 
investor should maintain a balanced portfolio that includes other investment 
vehicles. A diversified investor has some money in vehicles that do well when 
interest rates rise. These vehicles include money market funds, U.S. savings 
bonds (series I), and other variable-rate investments whose interest rates rise 
when market rates rise. These types of investments add a measure of safety 
from interest rate risk to your stock portfolio. (I discuss diversification in 
more detail later in this chapter.)
Market risk
People talk about the market and how it goes up or down, making it sound 
like a monolithic entity instead of what it really is — a group of millions 
of individuals making daily decisions to buy or sell stock. No matter how 
modern our society and economic system, you can’t escape the laws of 
supply and demand. When masses of people want to buy a particular stock, it 
becomes in demand, and its price rises. That price rises higher if the supply 
is limited. Conversely, if no one’s interested in buying a stock, its price falls. 
Supply and demand is the nature of market risk. The price of the stock you 
purchase can rise and fall on the fickle whim of market demand.

53
 Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks
Millions of investors buying and selling each minute of every trading day 
affect the share price of your stock. This fact makes it impossible to judge 
which way your stock will move tomorrow or next week. This unpredictabil-
ity and seeming irrationality is why stocks aren’t appropriate for short-term 
financial growth.
A good example of market risk with a stock is Apple (AAPL). Had you bought 
AAPL in early 2007, you could have gotten it for about $75 a share in January 
2007 and watched it rise joyfully upward to hit $205 a share by December 
2007. At that point some giddy investor may be thinking, “It’s time to pop the 
champagne! I’ll be able to buy Rhode Island!” Hold on a second! Within three 
months of that top, AAPL had a dizzying plunge to under $120 by March 2008. 
It’s typical for stocks to take a relatively long time to climb, but they can fall 
in a relatively short time. In that example, a long-term patient investor would 
still be up, but some short-term folks that “jump in” and “jump out” would 
have been burned. I’m sure that some of them lived in Rhode Island (but 
probably renting).
Markets are volatile by nature; they go up and down, and investments need 
time to grow. Market volatility is an increasingly common condition that we 
have to live with. Investors should be aware of the fact that stocks in general 
(especially in today’s marketplace) aren’t suitable for short-term (one year or 
less) goals (see Chapters 2 and 3 for more on short-term goals). Despite the 
fact that companies you’re invested in may be fundamentally sound, all stock 
prices are subject to the gyrations of the marketplace and need time to trend 
upward.
 
Investing requires diligent work and research before putting your money in 
quality investments with a long-term perspective. Speculating is attempting to 
make a relatively quick profit by monitoring the short-term price movements 
of a particular investment. Investors seek to minimize risk, whereas specu-
lators don’t mind risk because it can also magnify profits. Speculating and 
investing have clear differences, but investors frequently become speculators 
and ultimately put themselves and their wealth at risk. Don’t go there!
Consider the married couple nearing retirement who decided to play with 
their money to see about making their pending retirement more comfortable. 
They borrowed a sizable sum by tapping into their home equity to invest in 
the stock market. (Their home, which they had paid off, had enough equity 
to qualify for this loan.) What did they do with these funds? You guessed it; 
they invested in the high-flying stocks of the day, which were high-tech and 
Internet stocks. Within eight months, they lost almost all their money.
 
Understanding market risk is especially important for people who are tempted 
to put their nest eggs or emergency funds into volatile investments such as 
growth stocks (or mutual funds that invest in growth stocks, or similar aggres-
sive investment vehicles). Remember, you can lose everything.

54
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Inflation risk
Inflation is the artificial expansion of the quantity of money so that too much 
money is used in exchange for goods and services. To consumers, inflation 
shows up in the form of higher prices for goods and services. Inflation risk 
is also referred to as purchasing power risk. This term just means that your 
money doesn’t buy as much as it used to. For example, a dollar that bought 
you a sandwich in 1980 barely bought you a candy bar a few years later. For 
you, the investor, this risk means that the value of your investment (a stock 
that doesn’t appreciate much, for example) may not keep up with inflation.
Say that you have money in a bank savings account currently earning 4 per-
cent. This account has flexibility — if the market interest rate goes up, the 
rate you earn in your account goes up. Your account is safe from both finan-
cial risk and interest rate risk. But what if inflation is running at 5 percent? At 
that point you’re losing money.
At the time of this writing, inflation is a very real and a very serious concern 
and it should not be ignored. I deal more with inflation in Chapter 10.
Tax risk
 
Taxes (such as income tax or capital gains tax) don’t affect your stock invest-
ment directly. Taxes can obviously affect how much of your money you get to 
keep. Because the entire point of stock investing is to build wealth, you need 
to understand that taxes take away a portion of the wealth that you’re trying 
to build. Taxes can be risky because if you make the wrong move with your 
stocks (selling them at the wrong time, for example), you can end up paying 
higher taxes than you need to. Because tax laws change so frequently, tax risk 
is part of the risk-versus-return equation, as well.
It pays to gain knowledge about how taxes can impact your wealth-building 
program before you make your investment decisions. Chapter 21 covers in 
greater detail the impact of taxes.
Political and governmental risks
If companies were fish, politics and government policies (such as taxes, laws, 
and regulations) would be the pond. In the same way that fish die in a toxic or 
polluted pond, politics and government policies can kill companies. Of course, 
if you own stock in a company exposed to political and governmental risks, 
you need to be aware of these risks. For some companies, a single new regula-
tion or law is enough to send them into bankruptcy. For other companies, a 
new law could help them increase sales and profits.

55
 Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks
What if you invest in companies or industries that become political targets? 
You may want to consider selling them (you can always buy them back later) 
or consider putting in stop-loss orders on the stock (see Chapter 18). For 
example, tobacco companies were the targets of political firestorms that 
battered their stock prices. Whether you agree or disagree with the political 
machinations of today is not the issue. As an investor, you have to ask your-
self, “How do politics affect the market value and the current and future pros-
pects of my chosen investment?” (See Chapter 15 for more on how politics 
can affect the stock market.)
Taking the preceding point a step further, I’d like to remind you that politics 
and government have a direct and often negative impact on the economic 
environment. And one major pitfall for investors is that many misunderstand 
even basic economics. Considering all the examples I could find in recent 
years, I could write a book! Or . . . uh . . . simply add it to this book. Chapter 
10 goes into greater detail to help you make (and keep) stock market profits 
just by understanding rudimentary (and quite interesting) economics. (Don’t 
worry; the dry stuff will be kept to a minimum!)
Personal risks
Frequently, the risk involved with investing in the stock market may not be 
directly involved with the investment or factors directly related to the invest-
ment; sometimes the risk is with the investor’s circumstances.
Suppose that investor Ralph puts $15,000 into a portfolio of common stocks. 
Imagine that the market experiences a drop in prices that week and Ralph’s 
stocks drop to a market value of $14,000. Because stocks are good for the 
long term, this type of decrease is usually not an alarming incident. Odds are 
that this dip is temporary, especially if Ralph carefully chose high-quality 
companies. Incidentally, if a portfolio of high-quality stocks does experience a 
temporary drop in price, it can be a great opportunity to get more shares at a 
good price. (Chapter 18 covers orders you can place with your broker to help 
you do that.)
Over the long term, Ralph would probably see the value of his investment 
grow substantially. But what if during a period when his stocks are declining, 
Ralph experiences financial difficulty and needs quick cash? He may have to 
sell his stock to get some money.
This problem occurs frequently for investors who don’t have an emergency 
fund or a rainy day fund to handle large, sudden expenses. You never know 
when your company may lay you off or when your basement may flood, leav-
ing you with a huge repair bill. Car accidents, medical emergencies, and other 
unforeseen events are part of life’s bag of surprises — for anyone.

56
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
 
You probably won’t get much comfort from knowing that stock losses are tax 
deductible — a loss is a loss (see Chapter 21 for more on taxes). However, you 
can avoid the kind of loss that results from prematurely having to sell your 
stocks if you maintain an emergency cash fund. A good place for your emer-
gency cash fund is in either a bank savings account or a money market fund. 
Then you aren’t forced to prematurely liquidate your stock investments to pay 
emergency bills. (Chapter 2 provides more guidance on having liquid assets 
for emergencies.)
Emotional risk
 
What does emotional risk have to do with stocks? Emotions are important risk 
considerations because the main decision makers are human beings. Logic 
and discipline are critical factors in investment success, but even the best 
investor can let emotions take over the reins of money management and cause 
loss. For stock investing, you’re likely to be sidetracked by three main emo-
tions: greed, fear, and love. You need to understand your emotions and what 
kinds of risk they can expose you to. If you get too attached to a sinking stock, 
then you don’t need a stock investing book — you need Dr. Phil!
Paying the price for greed
In 1998–2000, millions of investors threw caution to the wind and chased 
highly dubious, risky dot-com stocks. The dollar signs popped up in their 
eyes (just like slot machines) when they saw that easy street was lined with 
dot-com stocks that were doubling and tripling in a very short time. Who 
cares about price/earnings (P/E) ratios and earnings when you can just buy 
stock, make a fortune, and get out with millions? (Of course, you care about 
making money with stocks, so you can flip to Chapter 11 and Appendix B to 
find out more about P/E ratios.)
Unfortunately, the lure of the easy buck can easily turn healthy attitudes 
about growing wealth into unhealthy greed that blinds investors and discards 
common sense (such as investing for quick short-term gains in dubious hot 
stocks rather than doing your homework and buying stocks of solid compa-
nies with strong fundamentals and a long-term focus, as I explain in Part III).
Recognizing the role of fear
Greed can be a problem, but fear is the other extreme. People who are fear-
ful of loss frequently avoid suitable investments and end up settling for a low 
rate of return. If you have to succumb to one of these emotions, at least fear 
exposes you to less loss.

57
 Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks
Also, keep in mind that fear is frequently a symptom of lack of knowledge 
about what’s going on. If you see your stocks falling and don’t understand 
why, fear will take over and you may act irrationally. When stock investors 
are affected by fear, the tendency is to sell their stocks and head for the exits 
and the life boats. When an investor sees his stock go down 20 percent, what 
goes through his head? Experienced, knowledgeable investors see that no 
bull market goes straight up. Even the strongest bull goes up in a zigzag fash-
ion. Conversely, even bear markets don’t go straight down, they zigzag down. 
Out of fear, inexperienced investors will sell good stocks if they see them go 
down temporarily (the “correction”) while experienced investors see that 
temporary down move as a good buying opportunity to add to their posi-
tions. (Flip to Chapter 14 for details on dealing with bull and bear markets.)
Investment lessons from September 11
September 11, 2001, was a horrific day that is 
burned in our minds and won’t be forgotten 
in our lifetime. The acts of terrorism that day 
took over 3,000 lives and caused untold pain 
and grief. A much less important aftereffect 
was the hard lessons that investors learned 
that day. Terrorism reminds us that risk is more 
real than ever and that we should never let our 
guard down. What lessons can investors learn 
from the worst acts of terrorism to ever happen 
on U.S. soil? Here are a few pointers:
 ✓ Diversify your portfolio. Of course, the 
events of September 11 were certainly sur-
real and unexpected. But before the events 
occurred, investors should have made it 
a habit to assess their situations and see 
whether they had any vulnerabilities. Stock 
investors with no money outside the stock 
market are always more at risk. Keeping 
your portfolio diversified is a time-tested 
strategy that is more relevant than ever 
before. (I discuss diversification later in this 
chapter.)
 ✓ Review and re-allocate. September 11 
triggered declines in the overall market, 
but specific industries, such as airlines and 
hotels, were hit particularly hard. In addi-
tion, some industries, such as defense and 
food, saw stock prices rise. Monitor your 
portfolio and ask yourself whether it’s overly 
reliant on or exposed to events in specific 
sectors. If so, reallocate your investments 
to decrease your risk exposure.
 ✓ Check for signs of trouble. Techniques such 
as trailing stops (which I explain in Chapter 
18) come in very handy when your stocks 
plummet because of unexpected events. 
Even if you don’t use these techniques, you 
can make it a regular habit to analyze your 
stocks and check for signs of trouble, such 
as debts or P/E ratios that are too high. If 
you see signs of trouble (check out Chap-
ter 24), consider selling anyway.

Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Looking for love in all the wrong places
Stocks are dispassionate, inanimate vehicles, but people can look for love in 
the strangest places. Emotional risk occurs when investors fall in love with 
a stock and refuse to sell it, even when the stock is plummeting and shows 
all the symptoms of getting worse. Emotional risk also occurs when inves-
tors are drawn to bad investment choices just because they sound good, are 
popular, or are pushed by family or friends. Love and attachment are great in 
relationships with people but can be horrible with investments. To deal with 
this emotion, investors have to deploy techniques that take the emotion out. 
For example, you can use brokerage orders (such as trailing stops and limit 
orders), which can automatically trigger buy and sell transactions and leave 
some of the agonizing out. Hey, disciplined investing may just become your 
new passion!
Minimizing Your Risk
Now, before you go crazy thinking that stock investing carries so much risk 
that you may as well not get out of bed, take a breath. Minimizing your risk 
in stock investing is easier than you think. Although wealth building through 
the stock market doesn’t take place without some amount of risk, you can 
practice the following tips to maximize your profits and still keep your money 
secure.
Gaining knowledge
Some people spend more time analyzing a restaurant menu to choose a $10 
entrée than analyzing where to put their next $5,000. Lack of knowledge con-
stitutes the greatest risk for new investors, but diminishing that risk starts 
with gaining knowledge. The more familiar you are with the stock market — 
how it works, factors that affect stock value, and so on — the better you can 
navigate around its pitfalls and maximize your profits. The same knowledge 
that enables you to grow your wealth also enables you to minimize your risk. 
Before you put your money anywhere, you want to know as much as you 
can. This book is a great place to start — check out Chapter 6 for a rundown 
of the kinds of information you want to know before you buy stocks, as 
well as the resources that can give you the information you need to invest 
successfully.

 Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks
Staying out until you get a little practice
If you don’t understand stocks, don’t invest! Yeah, I know this book is about 
stock investing, and I think that some measure of stock investing is a good 
idea for most people. But that doesn’t mean you should be 100 percent 
invested 100 percent of the time. If you don’t understand a particular stock 
(or don’t understand stocks, period), stay away until you do understand. 
Instead, give yourself an imaginary sum of money, such as $100,000, give 
yourself reasons to invest, and just make believe (“simulated stock invest-
ing or trading”). Pick a few stocks that you think will increase in value, track 
them for a while, and see how they perform. Begin to understand how the 
price of a stock goes up and down, and watch what happens to the stocks 
you choose when various events take place. As you find out more and more 
about stock investing, you get better and better at picking individual stocks, 
and you haven’t risked — or lost — any money during your learning period.
 
A good place to do your imaginary investing is at Web sites such as 
Marketocracy (www.marketocracy.com) and Investopedia’s simulator 
(http://simulator.investopedia.com). You can design a stock port-
folio and track its performance with thousands of other investors to see how 
well you do.
Putting your financial house in order
Advice on what to do before you invest could be a whole book all by itself. 
The bottom line is that you want to make sure that you are, first and fore-
most, financially secure before you take the plunge into the stock market. If 
you’re not sure about your financial security, look over your situation with a 
financial planner. (You can find more on financial planners in Appendix A.)
 
Before you buy your first stock, here are a few things you can do to get your 
finances in order:
 
✓ Have a cushion of money. Set aside three to six months’ worth of your 
gross living expenses somewhere safe, such as in a bank account or trea-
sury money market fund, in case you suddenly need cash for an emer-
gency (see Chapter 2 for details).
 
✓ Reduce your debt. Overindulging in debt was the worst personal eco-
nomic problem for many Americans in the late 1990s, and this has con-
tinued in recent years. The year 2001 was a record year for bankruptcy, 

60
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
with nearly 1.5 million people filing for bankruptcy. When the housing 
bubble popped, millions of foreclosures were the result as homeowners 
piled on too much debt.
 
✓ Make sure that your job is as secure as you can make it. Are you keep-
ing your skills up to date? Is the company you work for strong and grow-
ing? Is the industry that you work in strong and growing?
 
✓ Make sure that you have adequate insurance. You need enough insur-
ance to cover you and your family’s needs in case of illness, death, 
disability, and so on.
Diversifying your investments
 
Diversification is a strategy for reducing risk by spreading your money across 
different investments. It’s a fancy way of saying, “Don’t put all your eggs in one 
basket.” But how do you go about divvying up your money and distributing it 
among different investments? The easiest way to understand proper diversifi-
cation may be to look at what you shouldn’t do:
 
✓ Don’t put all your money in one stock. Sure, if you choose wisely and 
select a hot stock, you may make a bundle, but the odds are tremen-
dously against you. Unless you’re a real expert on a particular company, 
it’s a good idea to have small portions of your money in several different 
stocks. As a general rule, the money you tie up in a single stock should 
be money you can do without.
 
✓ Don’t put all your money in one industry. I know people who own sev-
eral stocks, but the stocks are all in the same industry. Again, if you’re 
an expert in that particular industry, it could work out. But just under-
stand that you’re not properly diversified. If a problem hits an entire 
industry, you may get hurt.
 
✓ Don’t put all your money in one type of investment. Stocks may be 
a great investment, but you need to have money elsewhere. Bonds, 
bank accounts, treasury securities, real estate, and precious metals 
are perennial alternatives to complement your stock portfolio. Some 
of these alternatives can be found in mutual funds or exchange-traded 
funds (ETFs). An exchange-traded fund is a fund with a fixed portfolio of 
stocks or other securities that tracks a particular index but is traded like 
a stock. By the way, I love ETFs and I think that every serious investor 
should consider them; see Chapter 14 for more information.

61
 Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks
 
Okay, now that you know what you shouldn’t do, what should you do? Until 
you become more knowledgeable, follow this advice:
 
✓ Keep only 10 percent (or less) of your investment money in a single 
stock.
 
✓ Invest in four or five (and no more than ten) different stocks that are 
in different industries. Which industries? Choose industries that offer 
products and services that have shown strong, growing demand. To 
make this decision, use your common sense (which isn’t as common as 
it used to be). Think about the industries that people need no matter 
what happens in the general economy, such as food, energy, and other 
consumer necessities. See Chapter 13 for more information about ana-
lyzing industries.
Weighing Risk against Return
How much risk is appropriate for you, and how do you handle it? Before you 
try to figure out what risks accompany your investment choices, analyze 
yourself. Here are some points to keep in mind when weighing risk versus 
return in your situation:
 
✓ Your financial goal: In five minutes with a financial calculator, you can 
easily see how much money you’re going to need to become financially 
independent (presuming financial independence is your goal). Say that 
you need $500,000 in ten years for a worry-free retirement and that your 
financial assets (such as stocks, bonds, and so on) are currently worth 
$400,000. In this scenario, your assets need to grow by only 2.25 percent 
to hit your target. Getting investments that grow by 2.25 percent safely 
is easy to do because that’s a relatively low rate of return.
Better luck next time!
A little knowledge can be very risky. Consider 
the true story of one “lucky” fellow who played 
the California lottery in 1987. He discovered that 
he had a winning ticket, with the first prize of 
$412,000. He immediately ordered a Porsche, 
booked a lavish trip to Hawaii for his family, and 
treated his wife and friends to a champagne 
dinner at a posh Hollywood restaurant. When 
he finally went to collect his prize, he found out 
that he had to share first prize with over 9,000 
other lottery players who also had the same 
winning numbers. His share of the prize was 
actually only $45! Hopefully, he invested that 
tidy sum based on his increased knowledge 
about risk.

62
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
 
 
 The important point is that you don’t have to knock yourself out trying 
to double your money with risky, high-flying investments; some run-
of-the-mill bank investments will do just fine. All too often, investors 
take on more risk than is necessary. Figure out what your financial goal 
is so that you know what kind of return you realistically need. Flip to 
Chapters 2 and 3 for details on determining your financial goals.
 
✓ Your investor profile: Are you nearing retirement, or are you fresh out 
of college? Your life situation matters when it comes to looking at risk 
versus return.
 
• If you’re just beginning your working years, you can certainly toler-
ate greater risk than someone facing retirement. Even if you lose 
big time, you still have a long time to recoup your money and get 
back on track.
 
• However, if you’re within five years of retirement, risky or aggres-
sive investments can do much more harm than good. If you lose 
money, you don’t have as much time to recoup your investment, 
and the odds are that you’ll need the investment money (and its 
income-generating capacity) to cover your living expenses after 
you’re no longer employed.
 
✓ Asset allocation: I never tell retirees to put a large portion of their retire-
ment money into a high-tech stock or other volatile investment. But if 
they still want to speculate, I don’t see a problem as long as they limit 
such investments to 5 percent of their total assets. As long as the bulk of 
their money is safe and sound in secure investments (such as U.S. trea-
sury bonds), I know I can sleep well (knowing that they can sleep well!).
 
 
Asset allocation beckons back to diversification, which I discuss earlier 
in this chapter. For people in their 20s and 30s, having 75 percent of 
their money in a diversified portfolio of growth stocks (such as mid cap 
and small cap stocks; see Chapter 1) is acceptable. For people in their 
60s and 70s, it’s not acceptable. They may, instead, consider investing 
no more than 20 percent of their money in stocks (mid caps and large 
caps are preferable). Check with your financial advisor to find the right 
mix for your particular situation.

In This Chapter
▶ Defining index basics
▶ Looking at the Dow and other indexes
▶ Exploring indexes for practical use
“H
ow’s the market doing today?” is the most common question that 
interested parties ask about the stock market. “What did the Dow 
do?” “How about Nasdaq?” Invariably, people asking those questions expect 
an answer regarding how well the market performed that day. “Well, the Dow 
fell 157 points to 12,500, while Nasdaq was unchanged at 2,449.” The Dow and 
Nasdaq are indexes, which are statistical measures that represent the value 
of a batch of stocks. You can use indexes as general gauges of stock market 
activity. From them, you get a basic idea of how well (or how poorly) the 
overall market (or a portion of it) is doing. In this chapter, I focus my atten-
tion on the major stock market indexes and how to use them.
Knowing How Indexes Are Measured
 
The oldest stock market index is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA or 
simply “The Dow”), which was created by Charles Dow (of Dow Jones fame) 
in 1896. The Dow covered only 12 stocks then, but the number increased to 
30 stocks in 1928, and it remains the same to this day. Because Dow worked 
long before the age of computers, he kept the calculations of his stock market 
index simple and did them arithmetically by hand. Dow added up the stock 
prices of the 12 companies and then divided the sum by 12. Technically, this 
number is an average and not an index (hence the word “average” in the 
name). For simplicity’s sake, I refer to it as an index. Besides, the number gets 
tweaked nowadays to account for things such as stock splits. (For more on 
stock splits, see Chapter 20.)

64
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
 
However, indexes and averages get calculated differently. The primary differ-
ence is the concept of weighting. Weighting refers to the relative importance 
of the items when they’re computed within the index. Several kinds of indexes 
exist, including:
 
✓ Price-weighted index: This index tracks changes based on the change 
in the individual stock’s price per share. For example, suppose you 
own two stocks: Stock A, worth $20 per share, and Stock B, worth $40 
per share. A price-weighted index allocates a greater proportion of the 
index to the stock at $40 than to the one at $20. If the index contained 
only these two stocks, the index number would reflect the $40 stock as 
being 67 percent (two-thirds of the total), while the $20 stock would be 
33 percent (one-third of the total). The Dow is a good example of a price-
weighted index.
 
✓ Market-value weighted index: This index, also known as a capitalization-
weighted index, tracks the proportion of a stock based on its market 
capitalization (or market value, also called market cap).
 
 Say that in your portfolio, you have 10 million shares of a $20 stock 
(Stock A) and 1 million shares of a $40 stock (Stock B). Stock A’s market 
cap is $200 million, while Stock B’s market cap is $40 million. Therefore, 
in a market-value weighted index, Stock A represents 83 percent of the 
index’s value because of its much larger market cap. An example of a 
market-value weighted index is the Nasdaq Composite Index.
 
✓ Broad-based index: The sample portfolios in the preceding bullets 
show only two stocks — obviously not a good representative index. 
Most investing professionals (especially money managers and mutual 
fund firms) use a broad-based index as a benchmark to compare their 
progress. A broad-based index provides a snapshot of the entire market. 
The S&P 500 and the Wilshire 5000 are good examples of broad-based 
indexes (they also happen to be market-value weighted indexes; see 
descriptions of both indexes later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Composite index: This index is a combination of several averages or 
indexes. An example is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Composite, 
which tracks all the stocks on the NYSE. Another example is the Nasdaq 
Composite Index, which is a market-capitalization composite index of 
3,000 companies on Nasdaq. (I discuss Nasdaq later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Performance-based index: This index includes not only the apprecia-
tion of the stocks represented in the index but also the dividends (and 
other cash payouts) issued to stockholders. The DAX (the most widely 
followed German index, composed of 30 major German companies) is a 
performance-based index.

 Chapter 5: Say Cheese: Getting a Snapshot of the Market with Indexes
Checking Out the Indexes
Although most people consider the Dow, Nasdaq, and Standard & Poor’s 
500 to be the stars of the financial press, you may find other indexes equally 
important to follow because they cover other significant facets of the market, 
such as small cap and mid cap stocks, or specific sectors and industries.
 
For example, if you invest in an Internet stock, you should check the Internet 
Stock Index to compare how your stock is doing when measured against the 
index. You can find indexes that cover industries such as transportation, bro-
kerage firms, retailers, computer companies, and real estate firms. For a com-
prehensive list of indexes, go to www.djindexes.com (a Dow Jones & Co. 
Web site). The most reliable and most widely respected indexes are produced 
not only by Dow Jones but also Standard & Poor’s and the major exchanges/
markets themselves, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the 
American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and Nasdaq. Smaller exchanges also issue 
or provide indexes (such as the Philadelphia Exchange). Web sites for differ-
ent exchanges can be found in Appendix A.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average
The most famous stock market barometer is my first example in the previ-
ous section — the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). When someone asks 
how the market is doing, most investors quote the DJIA (simply referred to as 
“the Dow”). The Dow is price weighted and tracks a basket of 30 of the largest 
and most influential public companies in the stock market. I list the stocks 
tracked on the Dow and discuss the Dow’s drawbacks in the following 
sections.

The drawbacks of the Dow
 
The Dow has survived as a popular gauge of stock market activity for over a 
century because it was the first such statistical snapshot of the stock market, 
which helped it become quickly entrenched as a widely followed and quoted 
barometer. Although it’s an important indicator of the market’s progress, the 
Dow does have one major drawback: It tracks only 30 companies. Regardless 
of their status in the market, the companies in the Dow represent a limited 
sampling, so they don’t communicate the true pulse of the market. For exam-
ple, when the Dow surpassed the record 10,000 and 11,000 milestones during 
1999 and 2000, the majority of (nonindex) companies showed lackluster or 
declining stock price movement. (See the “Dow Jones milestones” sidebar, 
later in this chapter, for more information.)
 
The roster of the Dow has changed many times during the 100-plus years of its 
existence. The only original company from 1896 is General Electric. Dow Jones 
made most of the changes because of company mergers and bankruptcy. 
However, Dow Jones also made some changes simply to reflect the chang-
ing times. In September 2008, as AIG Corp.’s stock was plummeting because 
of the credit crisis on Wall Street, it was quickly removed from the Dow and 
replaced with Kraft Foods. At that time, AIG fell from $25 per share to $3 per 
share within days. Had AIG stayed in the Dow, the Dow would have shown a 
larger drop, but it maintained a higher level because of the quick replacement. 
Investors unaware of such moves can be fooled regarding the market’s 
health — another drawback of the Dow.

As you can see, the Dow took 76 years to hit 
its first milestone. But it took less and less time 
to hit each succeeding milestone because the 
higher the Dow is in a relative sense, the easier 
it is to jump 1,000 points. For example, it went 
from 6,000 to 7,000 in only four months.
As the table indicates, most of the milestones 
happened during the 1982–1999 bull market. 
But the Dow didn’t reach a new milestone from 
2000–2004. After the Dow hit a peak of 11,722 
in January 2000, it entered a bear market that 
lasted three years. A new bull market started 
in 2003, and the Dow regained its traction and 
started an ascent to new highs. It finally hit 
the 12,000 mark in late 2006 (nearly 71/2 years 
after hitting the 11,000 level). Despite hitting 
the 14,000 plateau in July 2007, it spent the 
subsequent 12-month period trading sideways 
in the 11,000–13,000 range. The Dow hit an all-
time closing high of 14,164.53 on October 9, 
2007 (Hey! That’s my wedding anniversary!), 
although it is considerably lower a year later 
(under 9,300). Oh well . . . .
The Dow isn’t a pure gauge of industrial activity because it also includes 
a hodgepodge of nonindustrial companies such as J.P. Morgan Chase and 
Citigroup (banks), Home Depot (retailing), and Microsoft (software). During 
this decade, true industrial sectors like manufacturing had difficult times, yet 
the Dow rose to record levels.
Given the Dow’s shortcomings, serious investors also look at the following 
indexes:
 
✓ Broad-based indexes: The S&P 500 and the Wilshire 5000 are more real-
istic gauges of the stock market’s performance than the Dow. (I discuss 
these indexes later in this chapter.)

68
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
 
✓ Industry or sector indexes: These indexes are better gauges of the 
growth (or lack of growth) of specific industries and sectors. If you buy 
a gold stock, for example, you should track the index for the precious 
metals industry.
 
Dow Jones has several averages, including the Dow Jones Transportation 
Average (DJTA) and the Dow Jones Utilities Average (DJUA). Dow Jones man-
ages both of these indexes more strictly than the Dow, so they tend to be a 
more accurate barometer of the market they represent. Find out more about 
the Dow Jones indexes at www.djindexes.com.
Standard & Poor’s 500
The Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) tracks 500 leading publicly traded com-
panies considered to be widely held. The publishing firm Standard & Poor’s 
created this index (I bet you could’ve guessed that). Because it contains 500 
companies, the S&P 500 more accurately represents overall market perfor-
mance than the DJIA, with its 30 companies. Money managers and financial 
advisors actually watch the S&P 500 stock index more closely than the Dow. 
Most mutual funds especially like to measure their performance against the 
S&P 500 rather than any other index, although mutual funds that concentrate 
on small cap stocks usually prefer an index that has more small cap stocks in 
it, such as the Russell 2000 (which I discuss later in this chapter).
The S&P 500 doesn’t attempt to cover the 500 biggest companies. Instead, it 
includes companies that are widely held and widely followed. The companies 
are also industry leaders in a variety of industries, including energy, technol-
ogy, healthcare, and finance.
 
Although it’s a reliable indicator of the market’s overall status, the S&P 500 
also has some limitations. Despite the fact that it tracks 500 companies, the 
top 50 companies make up 50 percent of the index’s market value. This situa-
tion can be a drawback, because those 50 companies have a greater influence 
on the index’s price movement than any other segment of companies. In other 
words, 10 percent of the companies have an equal impact to 90 percent of the 
companies on the same index. Therefore, although the index better represents 
the market than the DIJA, it doesn’t give a perfectly accurate representation of 
the general market.
Standard & Poor’s doesn’t set the 500 companies it tracks in stone — S&P 
can add or remove companies when market conditions change, removing a 
company if it isn’t doing well or goes bankrupt, for instance, and replacing it 

69

with a company that’s doing better. You can find out more at www.standard
andpoors.com.
Wilshire Total Market Index
The Wilshire 5000 Equity Index, often referred to as the Wilshire Total Market 
Index, is probably the largest stock index in the world. Wilshire Associates 
started out in 1980 tracking 5,000 stocks. Since then, the Wilshire 5000 has 
ballooned to cover more than 7,500 stocks. The advantage of the Wilshire 
5000 is that it’s very comprehensive, covering nearly the entire market (at 
the very least, the Wilshire 5000 tracks the largest publicly traded stocks). It 
includes all the stocks on the major stock exchanges (NYSE, AMEX, and the 
largest issues on Nasdaq), which by default also includes all the stocks cov-
ered by the S&P 500. Investors and analysts who seek the greatest represen-
tation/performance of the general market look to the Wilshire 5000.
The Wilshire 5000 is a market-value weighted index that also performs 
as a broad-based index. The Wilshire indexes are maintained by Wilshire 
Associates Incorporated, and you can find out more at www.wilshire.com.
Nasdaq indexes
Nasdaq became a formalized market in 1971. The name used to stand for 
“National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quote” system, but 
now it’s simply “Nasdaq” (as if it’s a name like Ralph or Eddie). Nasdaq 
indexes are similar to other indexes in style and structure. The only dif-
ference is that, well, they cover companies traded on the Nasdaq (www.
nasdaq.com). The Nasdaq has two indexes, both of which are reported in 
the financial pages:
 
✓ Nasdaq Composite Index: Most frequently quoted on the news, the Nasdaq 
Composite Index covers about 3,000 companies that trade on Nasdaq. The 
companies encompass a variety of industries, but the index’s concentra-
tion is primarily technology, telecommunications, and related sectors. 
The Nasdaq Composite Index hit an all-time high of 5,048 in March 2000 
before the worst bear market in its history occurred. The index dropped 
a whopping 77 percent by 2002 to bottom out at 1,114 in October 2002. 
As of early October 2008, the Nasdaq was at approximately 1,740 (still 
way below its all-time high, but higher than its bottom six years earlier).

Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
 
✓ Nasdaq 100 Index: The Nasdaq 100 tracks the 100 largest companies 
in Nasdaq based on size in terms of market capitalization. This index is 
for investors who want to concentrate on the largest companies, which 
tend to be especially weighted in technology. It provides extra represen-
tation of technology-related companies such as Microsoft, Adobe, and 
Symantec.
 
Although these indexes track growth-oriented companies, the stocks of these 
companies are also very volatile and carry commensurate risk. The indexes 
themselves bear this risk out; in the bear market of 2000 and 2001 (and even 
extending into 2002), they fell more than 60 percent. You can find out more 
about Nasdaq’s indexes at www.nasdaq.com.
Russell 3000 Index
The Russell 3000 Index is a great example of an index that seeks more com-
prehensive inclusion of U.S. companies. It’s a performance-based index that 
includes the 3,000 largest publicly traded companies (nearly 98 percent of 
publicly traded stocks). The Russell 3000 is important because it includes 
many mid cap and small cap stocks. Most companies covered in the Russell 
3000 have an average market value of a billion dollars or less.
Russell Investments Group created and maintains the Russell 3000 Index, as 
well as the Russell 1000 and the Russell 2000. The Russell 2000 contains the 
smallest 2,000 companies from the Russell 3000, while the Russell 1000 con-
tains the largest 1,000 companies. The Russell indexes don’t cover micro cap 
stocks (companies with a market capitalization under $250 million). You can 
find out more at www.russell.com.
International indexes
Investors need to remember that the whole world is a vast marketplace that 
interacts with and exerts tremendous influence on individual national econo-
mies and markets. Whether you have one stock or one mutual fund, keep 
tabs on how world markets affect your portfolio. The best way to get a snap-
shot of international markets is, of course, with indexes. Here are some of the 
more widely followed international indexes:
 
✓ BSE SENSEX (India): The most widely followed index of Indian stocks 
is also referred to as the “BSE 30 Index” and is a value-weighted index 
maintained by the Bombay Stock Exchange (www.bseindia.com).

71
 Chapter 5: Say Cheese: Getting a Snapshot of the Market with Indexes
 
✓ CAC-40 (France): This market-capitalization weighted index tracks 40 
of the largest public stocks that trade on Paris’s stock exchange, the 
Euronext Paris.
 
✓ DAX (Germany): This index is similar to our DJIA in that it tracks 30 
blue chip stocks (the largest and most active that trade on the Frankfurt 
Exchange).
 
✓ FTSE-100 (Great Britain): Usually referred to as the “footsie,” this 
market-value weighted index includes the top 100 public companies 
in the United Kingdom.
 
✓ Halter USX China Index (China): This index tracks a basket of 50 
market-value weighted U.S. public companies that derive most of their 
revenues from China.
 
✓ Hang Seng Index (Hong Kong): This market-value weighted index tracks 
the top 45 companies on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
 
✓ Nikkei (Japan): This index is considered Japan’s version of the Dow. If 
you’re invested in Japanese stocks or in stocks that do business with 
Japan, you want to know what’s up with the Nikkei.
 
✓ SSE Composite Index (Shanghai): This is an index of all the stocks that 
trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
 
You can track these international indexes (among others) at major financial 
Web sites such as www.bloomberg.com and www.marketwatch.com. You 
may find international indexes useful in your analysis as you watch your 
stocks’ progress. What if you have stock in a company that has most of its cus-
tomers in Japan? Then the Nikkei can help you get a general snapshot of how 
well the major companies are doing in Japan, which in turn can be a general 
barometer of Japan’s economic health. If your company’s business partners 
or customers are in the Nikkei and it’s plunging, you know it’s probably “sayo-
nara” for the company’s stock price.
As for me, I’m still waiting for the “Galaxy 1 Million Index” — no point in being 
overweight with Earth stocks, you know.
Using the Indexes Effectively
You may be wondering which indexes you should be checking out and 
exactly what you should do with them. The sections that follow give you 
some idea of how to put all the pieces together.

72
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Tracking the indexes
 
The bottom line is that indexes give investors an instant snapshot of how well 
the market is doing. Indexes offer a quick way to compare the performance of 
one investor’s portfolio with the rest of the market. If the Dow goes up 10 per-
cent in a year and your portfolio shows a cumulative gain of 12 percent, then 
you know you’re doing well. Appendix A lists resources to help you keep up 
with various indexes.
 
The problem with indexes is that they can be misleading if you take them too 
literally as an accurate barometer of stock success. For example, the Dow has 
changed its roster of companies many times since 1896. Had it not, the Dow’s 
general upward trajectory in the past few decades would have been much dif-
ferent. Laggard stocks have been dropped and replaced with stocks that have 
shown more promise. Many of the original companies that were in the DJIA 
in 1896 went out of business or were bought by other companies that aren’t 
reflected in the index.
Investing in indexes
If the market is doing well but your specific stock isn’t, can you find a way to 
invest in the index itself? Yes, and with investments based on indexes, you 
can invest in the general market or a particular industry.
 
Say you want to invest in the DJIA. After all, why try to beat the market if just 
matching it is sufficient to grow your wealth? Why not have a portfolio that 
directly mirrors the DJIA? Well, it’s too impractical and expensive to invest in 
all 30 stocks in the DJIA. Fortunately, alternatives can accomplish the act of 
investing in indexes. Here are the best ways:
 
✓ Index mutual funds: An index mutual fund is much like a regular mutual 
fund except that it only invests in securities (in this case, stocks) that 
match as closely as possible the basket of stocks in that particular 
index. For example, you can find index mutual funds that track the DJIA 
and the S&P 500. Find out more about index mutual funds at places such 
as Morningstar (www.morningstar.com).
 
✓ Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): This is a particular favorite of mine. 
ETFs have similar characteristics to mutual funds except for a few key 
differences. An ETF can reflect a basket of stocks that mirror a particu-
lar index, but you can trade the ETF like a stock itself. You can trans-
act ETFs like stocks in that you can buy, sell, or go short. You can put 

73
 Chapter 5: Say Cheese: Getting a Snapshot of the Market with Indexes
stop losses on them, and you can even purchase them on margin (see 
Chapter 18 for more on stop losses and buying on margin). ETFs can 
give you the diversification of mutual funds coupled with the versatility 
of stocks. Examples of ETFs that track indexes are the DJIA ETF (symbol 
DIA) and the ETF for Nasdaq (QQQ). You can find out more about ETFs 
at the American Stock Exchange (www.amex.com).

hen you’re about to begin investing in stocks, you 
should know that different types of stocks exist for 
different objectives. If you can at least get a stock that fits 
your situation, you’re that much ahead in the game. In this 
part, you can find out where to start gathering information 
and discover what stockbrokers can do for you. In addi-

Gathering Information
In This Chapter
▶ Using stock exchanges to get investment information
▶ Applying accounting and economic know-how to your investments
▶ Exploring financial issues
▶ Deciphering stock tables
▶ Interpreting dividend news
▶ Recognizing good (and bad) investing advice
K
nowledge and information are two critical success factors in stock 
investing. (Isn’t that true about most things in life?) People who plunge 
headlong into stocks without sufficient knowledge of the stock market in 
general, and current information in particular, quickly learn the lesson of the 
eager diver who didn’t find out ahead of time that the pool was only an inch 
deep (ouch!). In their haste to avoid missing so-called golden investment 
opportunities, investors too often end up losing money.
 
Opportunities to make money in the stock market will always be there, no 
matter how well or how poorly the economy and the market are performing 
in general. There’s no such thing as a single (and fleeting) magical moment, so 
don’t feel that if you let an opportunity pass you by, you’ll always regret that 
you missed your one big chance.
For the best approach to stock investing, you want to build your knowledge 
and find quality information first. Then buy stocks and make your fortunes 
more assuredly. Basically, before you buy stock, you need to know that the 
company you’re investing in is
 
✓ Financially sound and growing
 
✓ Offering products and services that are in demand by consumers
 
✓ In a strong and growing industry (and general economy)
Where do you start and what kind of information do you want to acquire?

Part II: Before You Start Buying 
Looking to Stock Exchanges for Answers
Before you invest in stocks, you need to be completely familiar with the 
basics of stock investing. At its most fundamental, stock investing is about 
using your money to buy a piece of a company that will give you value in the 
form of appreciation or income. Fortunately, many resources are available to 
help you find out about stock investing. Some of my favorite places are the 
stock exchanges themselves.
Stock exchanges are organized marketplaces for the buying and selling of 
stocks (and other securities). The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the 
premier stock exchange, provides a framework for stock buyers and sellers 
to make their transactions. The NYSE makes money not only from a piece of 
every transaction but also from fees (such as listing fees) charged to com-
panies and brokers that are members of its exchanges. In 2007, the NYSE 
merged with Euronext, a major European exchange, but no material differ-
ences exist for stock investors.
The main exchanges for most stock investors are the NYSE and the American 
Stock Exchange (AMEX). Nasdaq is technically not an exchange, but it is a 
formal market that effectively acts as an exchange. These three encourage 
and inform people about stock investing. Because these exchanges/markets 
benefit from increased popularity of stock investing and continued demand 
for stocks, they offer a wealth of free (or low-cost) resources and information 
for stock investors. Go to their Web sites and you find useful resources 
such as:
 
✓ Tutorials on how to invest in stocks, common investment strategies, and 
so on
 
✓ Glossaries and free information to help you understand the language, 
practice, and purpose of stock investing
 
✓ A wealth of news, press releases, financial data, and other information 
about companies listed on the exchange or market, usually accessed 
through an on-site search engine
 
✓ Industry analysis and news
 
✓ Stock quotes and other market information related to the daily market 
movements of stocks, including data such as volume, new highs, new 
lows, and so on
 
✓ Free tracking of your stock selections (you can input a sample portfolio, 
or the stocks you’re following, to see how well you’re doing)

Understanding Stocks and the 
Companies They Represent
Stocks represent ownership in companies. Before you buy individual stocks, 
you want to understand the companies whose stock you’re considering and 
find out about their operations. It may sound like a daunting task, but you’ll 
digest the point more easily when you realize that companies work very simi-
larly to how you work. They make decisions on a day-to-day basis just as 
you do.
Think about how you grow and prosper as an individual or as a family, and 
you see the same issues with businesses and how they grow and prosper. 
Low earnings and high debt are examples of financial difficulties that can 
affect both people and companies. You’ll understand companies’ finances 
when you take the time to pick up some information in two basic disciplines: 
accounting and economics. These two disciplines play a significant role in 
understanding the performance of a firm’s stock.
Accounting for taste and a whole lot more
 
Accounting. Ugh! But face it: Accounting is the language of business, and 
believe it or not, you’re already familiar with the most important accounting 
concepts! Just look at the following three essential principles:
 
✓ Assets minus liabilities equal net worth. In other words, take what you 
own (your assets), subtract what you owe (your liabilities), and the rest 
is yours (net worth)! Your own personal finances work the same way as 
Microsoft’s (except yours have fewer zeros at the end). See Chapter 2 to 
figure out how to calculate your own net worth.

80
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
 
 A company’s balance sheet shows you its net worth at a specific point 
in time (such as December 31). The net worth of a company is the 
bottom line of its asset and liability picture, and it tells you whether the 
company is solvent (has the ability to pay its debts without going out of 
business). The net worth of a successful company is regularly growing. 
To see whether your company is successful, compare its net worth with 
the net worth from the same point a year earlier. A firm that has a $4 
million net worth on December 31, 2007, and a $5 million net worth on 
December 31, 2008, is doing well; its net worth has gone up 25 percent 
($1 million) in one year.
 
✓ Income less expenses equal net income. In other words, take what you 
make (your income), subtract what you spend (your expenses), and the 
remainder is your net income (or net profit or net earnings — your gain).
 
 A company’s profitability is the whole point of investing in its stock. As 
it profits, the business becomes more valuable, and in turn, its stock 
price becomes more valuable. To discover a firm’s net income, look at 
its income statement. Try to determine whether the company uses its 
gains wisely, either reinvesting them for continued growth or paying 
down debt.
 
✓ Do a comparative financial analysis. That’s a mouthful, but it’s just a 
fancy way of saying how a company is doing now compared with some-
thing else (like a prior period or a similar company).
 
 If you know that the company you’re looking at had a net income of 
$50,000 for the year, you may ask, “Is that good or bad?” Obviously, 
making a net profit is good, but you also need to know whether it’s good 
compared to something else. If the company had a net profit of $40,000 
the year before, you know that the company’s profitability is improving. 
But if a similar company had a net profit of $100,000 the year before and 
in the current year is making $50,000, then you may want to either avoid 
that company or see what went wrong (if anything) with it.
Accounting can be this simple. If you understand these three basic points, 
you’re ahead of the curve (in stock investing as well as in your personal 
finances). For more information on how to use a company’s financial state-
ments to pick good stocks, see Chapters 11 and 12.
Understanding how economics 
affects stocks
Economics. Double ugh! No, you aren’t required to understand “the inelastic-
ity of demand aggregates” (thank heavens!) or “marginal utility” (say what?). 
But a working knowledge of basic economics is crucial (and I mean crucial) 

81
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
to your success and proficiency as a stock investor. The stock market and 
the economy are joined at the hip. The good (or bad) things that happen to 
one have a direct effect on the other.
Getting the hang of the basic concepts
 
Alas, many investors get lost on basic economic concepts (as do some so-
called experts that you see on TV). I owe my personal investing success to my 
status as a student of economics. Understanding basic economics helps me 
(and will help you) filter the financial news to separate relevant information 
from the irrelevant in order to make better investment decisions. Be aware of 
these important economic concepts:
 
✓ Supply and demand: How can anyone possibly think about economics 
without thinking of the ageless concept of supply and demand? Supply 
and demand can be simply stated as the relationship between what’s 
available (the supply) and what people want and are willing to pay for 
(the demand). This equation is the main engine of economic activity and 
is extremely important for your stock investing analysis and decision-
making process. I mean, do you really want to buy stock in a company 
that makes elephant-foot umbrella stands if you find out that the com-
pany has an oversupply and nobody wants to buy them anyway? 
(I discuss supply and demand in more detail in Chapter 10.)
 
✓ Cause and effect: If you pick up a prominent news report and read, 
“Companies in the table industry are expecting plummeting sales,” do 
you rush out and invest in companies that sell chairs or manufacture 
tablecloths? Considering cause and effect is an exercise in logical think-
ing, and believe you me, logic is a major component of sound economic 
thought.
 
 When you read business news, play it out in your mind. What good 
(or bad) can logically be expected given a certain event or situation? If 
you’re looking for an effect (“I want a stock price that keeps increasing”), 
you also want to understand the cause. Here are some typical events 
that can cause a stock’s price to rise (see Chapter 10 for additional info 
on cause and effect):
 
• Positive news reports about a company: The news may report 
that the company is enjoying success with increased sales or a 
new product.
 
• Positive news reports about a company’s industry: The media 
may be highlighting that the industry is poised to do well.
 
• Positive news reports about a company’s customers: Maybe your 
company is in industry A, but its customers are in industry B. If 
you see good news about industry B, that may be good news for 
your stock.

82
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
 
• Negative news reports about a company’s competitors: If the 
competitors are in trouble, their customers may seek alternatives 
to buy from, including your company.
 
✓ Economic effects from government actions: Political and governmental 
actions have economic consequences. As a matter of fact, nothing (and 
I mean nothing!) has a greater effect on investing and economics than 
government. Government actions usually manifest themselves as taxes, 
laws, or regulations. They also can take on a more ominous appearance, 
such as war or the threat of war. Government can willfully (or even acci-
dentally) cause a company to go bankrupt, disrupt an entire industry, 
or even cause a depression. It controls the money supply, credit, and all 
public securities markets. For more information on political effects, see 
Chapter 15.
Gaining insight from past mistakes
Because most investors ignored some basic observations about economics 
in the late 1990s, they subsequently lost trillions in their stock portfolios. 
During 2000–2008, the U.S. experienced the greatest expansion of total debt 
in history, coupled with a record expansion of the money supply. The Federal 
Reserve (or “the Fed”), the U.S. government’s central bank, controls both. 
This growth of debt and money supply resulted in more consumer (and cor-
porate) borrowing, spending, and investing. This activity hyperstimulated the 
stock market and caused stocks to rise 25 percent per year for five straight 
years during the late 1990s. When the stock market bubble popped during 
2000–2002, it was soon replaced with the housing bubble, which popped 
during 2005–2006 and is still hurting the economy in 2008.
Of course, you should always be happy to earn 25 percent per year with your 
investments, but such a return can’t be sustained and encourages specula-
tion. This artificial stimulation by the Fed resulted in the following:
 
✓ More and more people depleted their savings. After all, why settle for 3 
percent in the bank when you can get 25 percent in the stock market?
 
✓ More and more people bought on credit. If the economy is booming, 
why not buy now and pay later? Consumer credit hit record highs.
 
✓ More and more people borrowed against their homes. Why not borrow 
and get rich now? I can pay off my debt later.
 
✓ More and more companies sold more goods as consumers took more 
vacations and bought SUVs, electronics, and so on. Companies then bor-
rowed to finance expansion, open new stores, and so on.
 
✓ More and more companies went public and offered stock to take advan-
tage of more money that was flowing to the markets from banks and 
other financial institutions.

83
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
In the end, spending started to slow down because consumers and busi-
nesses became too indebted. This slowdown in turn caused the sales of 
goods and services to taper off. However, companies had too much over-
head, capacity, and debt because they expanded too eagerly. At this point, 
businesses were caught in a financial bind. Too much debt and too many 
expenses in a slowing economy mean one thing: Profits shrink or disappear. 
Companies, to stay in business, had to do the logical thing — cut expenses. 
What’s usually the biggest expense for companies? People! To stay in busi-
ness, many companies started laying off employees. As a result, consumer 
spending dropped further because more people were either laid off or had 
second thoughts about their own job security.
As people had little in the way of savings and too much in the way of debt, 
they had to sell their stock to pay their bills. This trend was a major reason 
that stocks started to fall in 2000. Earnings started to drop because of shrink-
ing sales from a sputtering economy. As earnings fell, stock prices also fell.
 
The lessons from the 1990s are important ones for investors today:
 
✓ Stocks are not a replacement for savings accounts. Always have some 
money in the bank.
 
✓ Stocks should never occupy 100 percent of your investment funds.
 
✓ When anyone (including an expert) tells you that the economy will 
keep growing indefinitely, be skeptical and read diverse sources of 
information.
 
✓ If stocks do well in your portfolio, consider protecting your stocks (both 
your original investment and any gains) with stop-loss orders. (See 
Chapter 18 for more on these strategies.)
Know thyself before you invest in stocks
If you’re reading this book, you’re probably 
doing so because you want to become a suc-
cessful investor. Granted, to be a successful 
investor, you have to select great stocks, but 
having a realistic understanding of your own 
financial situation and goals is equally impor-
tant. I recall one investor who lost $10,000 in 
a speculative stock. The loss wasn’t that bad 
because he had most of his money safely 
tucked away elsewhere. He also understood 
that his overall financial situation was secure 
and that the money he lost was “play” money 
— the loss wouldn’t have a drastic effect on his 
life. But many investors often lose even more 
money, and the loss does have a major, nega-
tive effect on their lives. You may not be like the 
investor who can afford to lose $10,000. Take 
time to understand yourself, your own financial 
picture, and your personal investment goals 
before you decide to buy stocks.

84
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
 
✓ Keep debt and expenses to a minimum.
 
✓ If the economy is booming, a decline is sure to follow as the ebb and 
flow of the economy’s business cycle continues.
Staying on Top of Financial News
Reading the financial news can help you decide where or where not to invest. 
Many newspapers, magazines, and Web sites offer great coverage of the 
financial world. Obviously, the more informed you are, the better, but you 
don’t have to read everything that’s written. The information explosion in 
recent years has gone beyond overload, and you can easily spend so much 
time reading that you have little time left for investing. In the following sec-
tions, I describe the types of information you need to get from the financial 
news.
 
Appendix A of this book provides more information on the following 
resources, along with a treasure trove of some of the best publications, 
resources, and Web sites to assist you:
 
✓ The most obvious publications of interest to stock investors are The 
Wall Street Journal and Investor’s Business Daily. These excellent publica-
tions report the news and stock data as of the prior trading day.
 
✓ Some of the more obvious Web sites are MarketWatch (www.market
watch.com) and Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com). These Web sites 
can actually give you news and stock data within 15 to 20 minutes after 
an event occurs.
 
✓ Don’t forget the exchanges’ Web sites that I list in the earlier section, 
“Looking to Stock Exchanges for Answers”!
Figuring out what a company’s up to
 
Before you invest, you need to know what’s going on with the company. When 
you read about the company, either from the firm’s literature (its annual 
report, for example) or from media sources, be sure to get answers to some 
pertinent questions:
 
✓ Is the company making more net income than it did last year? You 
want to invest in a company that’s growing.
 
✓ Are the company’s sales greater than they were the year before? 
Remember, you won’t make money if the company isn’t making money.

85
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
 
✓ Is the company issuing press releases on new products, services, 
inventions, or business deals? All these achievements indicate a strong, 
vital company.
Knowing how the company is doing, no matter what’s happening with the 
general economy, is obviously important. To better understand how compa-
nies tick, see Chapters 11 and 12.
Discovering what’s new with an industry
As you consider investing in a stock, make it a point to know what’s going on 
in that company’s industry. If the industry is doing well, your stock is likely 
to do well, too. But then again, the reverse is also true.
Yes, I’ve seen investors pick successful stocks in a failing industry, but those 
cases are exceptional. By and large, it’s easier to succeed with a stock when 
the entire industry is doing well. As you’re watching the news, reading the 
financial pages, or viewing financial Web sites, check out the industry to see 
that it’s strong and dynamic. See Chapter 13 for information on analyzing 
industries.
Knowing what’s happening 
with the economy
No matter how well or how poorly the overall economy is performing, you 
want to stay informed about its general progress. It’s easier for the value of 
stock to keep going up when the economy is stable or growing. The reverse 
is also true; if the economy is contracting or declining, the stock has a 
tougher time keeping its value. Some basic items to keep tabs on include 
the following:
 
✓ Gross domestic product (GDP): This is roughly the total value of output 
for a particular nation, measured in the dollar amount of goods and 
services. The GDP is reported quarterly, and a rising GDP bodes well 
for your stock. When the GDP is rising 3 percent or more on an annual 
basis, that’s solid growth. If it rises at more than zero but less than 3 
percent, that’s generally considered less than stellar (or mediocre). 
A GDP under zero (or negative) means that the economy is shrinking 
(heading into recession).

86
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
 
✓ The index of leading economic indicators (LEI): The LEI is a snapshot 
of a set of economic statistics covering activity that precedes what’s 
happening in the economy. Each statistic helps you understand the 
economy in much the same way that barometers (and windows!) help 
you understand what’s happening with the weather. Economists don’t 
just look at an individual statistic; they look at a set of statistics to get a 
more complete picture of what’s happening with the economy.
Chapter 10 goes into greater detail on economics and its effect on stock 
prices.
Seeing what politicians and government 
bureaucrats are doing
Being informed about what public officials are doing is vital to your success 
as a stock investor. Because federal, state, and local governments pass liter-
ally thousands of laws every year, monitoring the political landscape is criti-
cal to your success. The news media report what the president and Congress 
are doing, so always ask yourself, “How does a new law, tax, or regulation 
affect my stock investment?”
 
Because government actions have a significant effect on your investments, 
it’s a good idea to see what’s going on. Laws being proposed or enacted by 
the federal government can be found through the Thomas legislative search 
engine, which is run by the Library of Congress (www.loc.gov). Also, some 
great organizations inform the public about tax laws and their impact, such 
as the National Taxpayers Union (www.ntu.org). Chapter 15 gives you more 
insights into politics and its effect on the stock market.
Checking for trends in society, 
culture, and entertainment
As odd as it sounds, trends in society, popular culture, and entertainment 
affect your investments, directly or indirectly. For example, a headline such 
as, “The Graying of America — More People Than Ever Before Will Be Senior 
Citizens” gives you some important information that can make or break your

more people age, companies that are well positioned to cater to that growing

 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
Keep your eyes open to emerging trends in society at large. What trends are 
evident now? Can you anticipate the wants and needs of tomorrow’s society? 
Being alert, staying a step ahead of the public, and choosing stocks appro-
priately gives you a profitable edge over other investors. If you own stock in 
a solid company with growing sales and earnings, other investors eventually 
notice. As more investors buy up your company’s stocks, you’re rewarded as 
the stock price increases.
Reading (And Understanding) 
Stock Tables
The stock tables in major business publications such as The Wall Street 
Journal and Investor’s Business Daily are loaded with information that can 
help you become a savvy investor — if you know how to interpret them. 
You need the information in the stock tables for more than selecting promis-
ing investment opportunities. You also need to consult the tables after you 
invest to monitor how your stocks are doing.
Looking at the stock tables without knowing what you’re looking for or why 
you’re looking is the equivalent of reading War and Peace backwards through 
a kaleidoscope — nothing makes sense. But I can help you make sense of it 
all (well, at least the stock tables!). Table 6-1 shows a sample stock table for 
you to refer to as you read the sections that follow.

Part II: Before You Start Buying 
 
Every newspaper’s financial tables are a little different, but they give you basi-
cally the same information. Updated daily, this section is not the place to start 
your search for a good stock; it’s usually where your search ends. The stock 
tables are the place to look when you own a stock or know what you want to 
buy and you’re just checking to see the most recent price.
Each item gives you some clues about the current state of affairs for that par-
ticular company. The sections that follow describe each column to help you 
understand what you’re looking at.
52-week high
The column in Table 6-1 labeled “52-Wk High” gives you the highest price that 
particular stock has reached in the most recent 52-week period. Knowing 
this price lets you gauge where the stock is now versus where it has been 
recently. SkyHighCorp’s (SHC) stock has been as high as $21.50, while its last 
(most recent) price is $21.25, the number listed in the “Day Last” column. 
(Flip to the “Day last” section for more on understanding this information.) 
SkyHighCorp’s stock is trading very high right now because it’s hovering 
right near its overall 52-week high figure.
Now, take a look at DoinBadlyCorp’s (DBC) stock price. It seems to have 
tumbled big time. Its stock price has had a high in the past 52 weeks of $83, 
but it’s currently trading at $33.50. Something just doesn’t seem right here. 
During the past 52 weeks, DBC’s stock price fell dramatically. If you’re think-
ing about investing in DBC, find out why the stock price fell. If the company 
is strong, it may be a good opportunity to buy stock at a lower price. If the 
company is having tough times, avoid it. In any case, research the firm and 
find out why its stock has declined.
52-week low
The column labeled “52-Wk Low” gives you the lowest price that particular 
stock reached in the most recent 52-week period. Again, this information is 
crucial to your ability to analyze stock over a period of time. Look at DBC in 
Table 6-1, and you can see that its current trading price of $33.50 is close to 
its 52-week low of $33.
 
Keep in mind that the high and low prices just give you a range of how far that 
particular stock’s price has moved within the past 52 weeks. They could alert 
you that a stock has problems, or they could tell you that a stock’s price has 
fallen enough to make it a bargain. Simply reading the 52-Wk High and 52-Wk 
Low columns isn’t enough to determine which of those two scenarios is hap-
pening. They basically tell you to get more information before you commit 
your money.

89
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
Name and symbol
The “Name (Symbol)” column is the simplest in Table 6-1. It tells you the 
company name (usually abbreviated) and the stock symbol assigned to the 
company.
 
When you have your eye on a stock for potential purchase, get familiar with 
its symbol. Knowing the symbol makes it easier for you to find your stock in 
the financial tables, which list stocks in alphabetical order by the company’s 
name. Stock symbols are the language of stock investing, and you need to use 
them in all stock communications, from getting a stock quote at your broker’s 
office to buying stock over the Internet.
Dividend
Dividends (shown under the “Div” column in Table 6-1) are basically pay-
ments to owners (stockholders). If a company pays a dividend, it’s shown in 
the dividend column. The amount you see is the annual dividend quoted for 
one share of that stock. If you look at LowDownInc (LDI) in Table 6-1, you can 
see that you get $2.35 as an annual dividend for each share of stock that you 
own. Companies usually pay the dividend in quarterly amounts. If I own 100 
shares of LDI, the company pays me a quarterly dividend of $58.75 ($235 total 
per year). A healthy company strives to maintain or upgrade the dividend for 
stockholders from year to year. (I discuss additional dividend details later in 
this chapter.)
The dividend is very important to investors seeking income from their stock 
investment. For more about investing for income, see Chapter 9. Investors 
buy stock in companies that don’t pay dividends primarily for growth. For 
more information on growth stocks, see Chapter 8.
Volume
Normally, when you hear the word “volume” on the news, it refers to how 
much stock is bought and sold for the entire market: “Well, stocks were very 
active today. Trading volume at the New York Stock Exchange hit 2 billion 
shares.” Volume is certainly important to watch because the stocks that 
you’re investing in are somewhere in that activity. For the “Vol” column in 
Table 6-1, though, the volume refers to the individual stock.

90
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
Volume tells you how many shares of that particular stock were traded 
that day. If only 100 shares are traded in a day, then the trading volume is 
100. SHC had 3,143 shares change hands on the trading day represented in 
Table 6-1. Is that good or bad? Neither, really. Usually the business news 
media only mention volume for a particular stock when it’s unusually large. 
If a stock normally has volume in the 5,000 to 10,000 range and all of a sudden 
has a trading volume of 87,000, then it’s time to sit up and take notice.
 
Keep in mind that a low trading volume for one stock may be a high trading 
volume for another stock. You can’t necessarily compare one stock’s volume 
against that of any other company. The large cap stocks like IBM or Microsoft 
typically have trading volumes in the millions of shares almost every day, 
while less active, smaller stocks may have average trading volumes in far, far 
smaller numbers.
The main point to remember is that trading volume that is far in excess of 
that stock’s normal range is a sign that something is going on with that stock. 
It may be negative or positive, but something newsworthy is happening with 
that company. If the news is positive, the increased volume is a result of 
more people buying the stock. If the news is negative, the increased volume 
is probably a result of more people selling the stock. What are typical events 
that cause increased trading volume? Some positive reasons include the 
following:
 
✓ Good earnings reports: The company announces good (or better-than-
expected) earnings.
 
✓ A new business deal: The firm announces a favorable business deal, 
such as a joint venture, or lands a big client.
 
✓ A new product or service: The company’s research and development 
department creates a potentially profitable new product.
 
✓ Indirect benefits: The business may benefit from a new development in 
the economy or from a new law passed by Congress.
Some negative reasons for an unusually large fluctuation in trading volume 
for a particular stock include the following:
 
✓ Bad earnings reports: Profit is the lifeblood of a company. When its 
profits fall or disappear, you see more volume.
 
✓ Governmental problems: The stock is being targeted by government 
action, such as a lawsuit or a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
probe.

91
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
 
✓ Liability issues: The media report that the company has a defective 
product or similar problem.
 
✓ Financial problems: Independent analysts report that the company’s 
financial health is deteriorating.
 
Check out what’s happening when you hear about heavier than usual volume 
(especially if you already own the stock).
Yield
In general, yield is a return on the money you invest. However, in the stock 
tables, yield (“Yld” in Table 6-1) is a reference to what percentage that par-
ticular dividend is to the stock price. Yield is most important to income 
investors. It’s calculated by dividing the annual dividend by the current stock 
price. In Table 6-1, you can see that the yield du jour of ValueNowInc (VNI) 
is 4.5 percent (a dividend of $1 divided by the company’s stock price of $22). 
Notice that many companies report no yield; because they have no divi-
dends, their yield is zero.
 
Keep in mind that the yield reported in the financial pages changes daily 
as the stock price changes. Yield is always reported as if you’re buying the 
stock that day. If you buy VNI on the day represented in Table 6-1, your yield 
is 4.5 percent. But what if VNI’s stock price rises to $30 the following day? 
Investors who buy stock at $30 per share obtain a yield of just 3.3 percent. 
(The dividend of $1 divided by the new stock price, $30.) Of course, because 
you bought the stock at $22, you essentially locked in the prior yield of 4.5 
percent. Lucky you. Pat yourself on the back.
P/E
The P/E ratio is the ratio between the price of the stock and the company’s 
earnings. P/E ratios are widely followed and are important barometers of 
value in the world of stock investing. The P/E ratio (also called the “earn-
ings multiple” or just “multiple”) is frequently used to determine whether a 
stock is expensive (a good value). Value investors (such as yours truly) find 
P/E ratios to be essential to analyzing a stock as a potential investment. As 
a general rule, the P/E should be 10 to 20 for large cap or income stocks. For 
growth stocks, a P/E no greater than 30 to 40 is preferable. (See Chapter 11 
for full details on P/E ratios.)

92
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
In the P/E ratios reported in stock tables, price refers to the cost of a single 
share of stock. Earnings refers to the company’s reported earnings per share 
as of the most recent four quarters. The P/E ratio is the price divided by the 
earnings. In Table 6-1, VNI has a reported P/E of 12, which is considered a low 
P/E. Notice how SHC has a relatively high P/E (76). This stock is considered 
too pricey because you’re paying a price equivalent to 76 times earnings. 
Also notice that DBC has no available P/E ratio. Usually this lack of a P/E ratio 
indicates that the company reported a loss in the most recent four quarters.
Day last
The “Day Last” column tells you how trading ended for a particular stock on 
the day represented by the table. In Table 6-1, LDI ended the most recent day 
of trading at $41. Some newspapers report the high and low for that day in 
addition to the stock’s ending price for the day.
Net change
The information in the “Net Chg” column answers the question, “How did the 
stock price end today compared with its price at the end of the prior trad-
ing day?” Table 6-1 shows that SHC stock ended the trading day up 25 cents 
(at $21.25). This column tells you that SHC ended the prior day at $21. VNI 
ended the day at $22 (up 10 cents), so you can tell that the prior trading day 
it ended at $21.90.
Using News about Dividends
Reading and understanding the news about dividends is essential if you’re 
an income investor (someone who invests in stocks as a means of generat-
ing regular income; see Chapter 9 for details). The following sections explain 
some basics about dividends you should know.
 
You can find news and information on dividends in newspapers such as 
The Wall Street Journal, Investor’s Business Daily, and Barron’s (you can find 
their Web sites online with your favorite search engine, or just check out 
Appendix A).

93
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
Looking at important dates
 
In order to understand how buying stocks that pay dividends can benefit you 
as an investor, you need to know how companies report and pay dividends. 
Some important dates in the life of a dividend are as follows:
 
✓ Date of declaration: This is the date when a company reports a quar-
terly dividend and the subsequent payment dates. On January 15, for 
example, a company may report that it “is pleased to announce a quar-
terly dividend of 50 cents per share to shareholders of record as of 
February 10.” That was easy. The date of declaration is really just the 
announcement date. If you buy the stock before, on, or after the date of 
declaration, it won’t matter in regard to receiving the stock’s quarterly 
dividend. The date that matters is the date of record (see that bullet 
later in this list).
 
✓ Date of execution: This is the day you actually initiate the stock transac-
tion (buying or selling). If you call up a broker (or contact her online) 
today to buy a particular stock, then today is the date of execution, or 
the date on which you execute the trade. You don’t own the stock on the 
date of execution; it’s just the day you put in the order. For an example, 
skip to the following section.
 
✓ Closing date (settlement date): This is the date on which the trade is 
finalized, which usually happens three business days after the date 
of execution. The closing date for stock is similar in concept to a real 
estate closing. On the closing date, you’re officially the proud new owner 
(or happy seller) of the stock.
 
✓ Date of record: This is used to identify which stockholders qualify to 
receive the declared dividend. Because stock is bought and sold every 
day, how does the company know which investors to pay? The company 
establishes a cut-off date by declaring a date of record. All investors 
who are official stockholders as of the declared date of record receive 
the dividend on the payment date, even if they plan to sell the stock any 
time between the date of declaration and the date of record.
 
✓ Ex-dividend date: Ex-dividend means without dividend. Because it takes 
three days to process a stock purchase before you become an official 
owner of the stock, you have to qualify (that is, you have to own or buy 
the stock) before the three-day period. That three-day period is referred 
to as the “ex-dividend period.” When you buy stock during this short 
time frame, you aren’t on the books of record, because the closing (or 
settlement) date falls after the date of record. See the next section to see 
the effect that the ex-dividend date can have on an investor.
 
✓ Payment date: The date on which a company issues and mails its divi-
dend checks to shareholders. Finally!

94

For typical dividends, the events in Table 6-2 happen four times per year.

Understanding why these dates matter
Three business days pass between the date of execution and the closing 
date. Three business days also pass between the ex-dividend date and the 
date of record. This information is important to know if you want to qualify 
to receive an upcoming dividend. Timing is important, and if you understand 
these dates, you know when to purchase stock and whether you qualify for a 
dividend.
As an example, say that you want to buy ValueNowInc (VNI) in time to qualify 
for the quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share. Assume that the date of 
record (the date by which you have to be an official owner of the stock) 
is February 10. You have to execute the trade (buy the stock) no later than 
February 7 to be assured of the dividend. If you execute the trade right 
on February 7, the closing date occurs three days later, on February 10 — 
just in time for the date of record.
But what if you execute the trade on February 8, a day later? Well, the trade’s 
closing date is February 11, which occurs after the date of record. Because 
you aren’t on the books as an official stockholder on the date of record, you 
aren’t getting that quarterly dividend. In this example, the February 7–10 
period is called the ex-dividend period.

95
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
 
Fortunately, for those people who buy the stock during this brief ex-dividend 
period, the stock actually trades at a slightly lower price to reflect the amount 
of the dividend. If you can’t get the dividend, you may as well save on the 
stock purchase. How’s that for a silver lining?
Evaluating Investment Tips
Psssst. Have I got a stock tip for you! Come closer. You know what it is? 
Research! What I’m trying to tell you is to never automatically invest just 
because you get a hot tip from someone. Good investment selection means 
looking at several sources before you decide on a stock. No shortcut exists. 
That said, getting opinions from others never hurts — just be sure to care-
fully analyze the information you get. Here are some important points to bear 
in mind as you evaluate tips and advice from others:
 
✓ Consider the source. Frequently, people buy stock based on the views 
of some market strategist or market analyst. People may see an analyst 
being interviewed on a television financial show and take that person’s 
opinions and advice as valid and good. The danger here is that the ana-
lyst may be biased because of some relationship that isn’t disclosed on 
the show.
 
 
It happens on TV all too often. The show’s host interviews analyst U.R. 
Kiddingme from the investment firm Foollum & Sellum. The analyst says, 
“Implosion Corp. is a good buy with solid, long-term upside potential.” 
You later find out that the analyst’s employer gets investment banking 
fees from Implosion Corp. Do you really think that analyst would ever 
issue a negative report on a company that’s helping to pay the bills? It’s 
not likely.
 
✓ Get multiple views. Don’t base your investment decisions on just one 
source unless you have the best reasons in the world for thinking that a 
particular, single source is outstanding and reliable. A better approach 
is to scour current issues of independent financial publications, such 
as Barron’s, Money magazine, SmartMoney, and other publications (and 
Web sites) listed in Appendix A.
 
✓ Gather data from the SEC. When you want to get more objective infor-
mation about a company, why not take a look at the reports that firms 
must file with the SEC? These reports are the same reports that the pun-
dits and financial reporters read. Arguably, the most valuable report you 
can look at is the 10K. The 10K is a report that all publicly traded com-
panies must file with the SEC. It provides valuable information on the 

96
Part II: Before Your Start Buying 
company’s operations and financial data for the most recent year, and 
it’s likely to be less biased than the information a company includes in 
other corporate reports, such as an annual report. The next most impor-
tant document from the SEC is the 10Q, which gives the investor similar 
detailed information but for a single quarter. (See Chapter 12 for more 
information about these documents.)
 
 To access 10K and 10Q reports, go to the SEC Web site (www.sec.
gov). From there, you can find the SEC’s extensive database of public 
filings called EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval 
system). By searching EDGAR, you can find companies’ balance sheets, 
income statements, and other related information so that you can verify 
what others say and get a fuller picture of what a business is doing and 
what its financial condition is.

W
hen you’re ready to dive in and start investing in stocks, you first 
have to choose a broker. It’s kind of like buying a car: You can do all 
the research in the world and know exactly what kind of car you want, but 
you still need a venue to conduct the actual transaction. Similarly, when you 
want to buy stock, your task is to do all the research you can to select the 
company you want to invest in. Still, you need a broker to actually buy the 
stock, whether you buy over the phone or online. In this chapter, I introduce 
you to the intricacies of the investor/broker relationship.
For information on various types of orders you can place with a broker, such 
as market orders, stop-loss orders, and so on, flip to Chapter 18.
Defining the Broker’s Role
The broker’s primary role is to serve as the vehicle through which you either 
buy or sell stock. When I talk about brokers, I’m referring to companies such 
as Charles Schwab, Merrill Lynch, E*TRADE, and many other organizations 
that can buy stock on your behalf. Brokers can also be individuals who work 
for such firms. Although you can buy some stocks directly from the company 
that issues them (I discuss direct purchase plans in Chapter 19), to purchase 
most stocks, you still need a broker.

98
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
 
The distinction between institutional stockbrokers and personal stockbrokers 
is important:
 
✓ Institutional stockbrokers make money from institutions and companies 
through investment banking and securities placement fees (such as 
initial public offerings and secondary offerings), advisory services, and 
other broker services.
 
✓ Personal stockbrokers generally offer the same services to individuals 
and small businesses.
Although the primary task of brokers is the buying and selling of securities 
(the word securities refers to the world of financial or paper investments, and 
stocks are only a small part of that world), they can perform other tasks for 
you, including the following:
 
✓ Providing advisory services: Investors pay brokers a fee for investment 
advice. Customers also get access to the firm’s research.
 
✓ Offering limited banking services: Brokers can offer features such as 
interest-bearing accounts, check writing, electronic deposits and with-
drawals, and credit/debit cards.
 
✓ Brokering other securities: In addition to stocks, brokers can buy 
bonds, mutual funds, options, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other 
investments on your behalf.
Personal stockbrokers make their money from individual investors like you 
and me through various fees, including the following:
 
✓ Brokerage commissions: This fee is for buying and/or selling stocks and 
other securities.
 
✓ Margin interest charges: This interest is charged to investors for bor-
rowing against their brokerage account for investment purposes. (I dis-
cuss margin accounts in more detail later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Service charges: These charges are for performing administrative tasks 
and other functions. Brokers charge fees to investors for Individual 
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and for mailing stocks in certificate form.
 
Any broker you deal with should be registered with the Financial Industry 
Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC). In addition, to protect your money after you deposit it into a broker-
age account, that broker should be a member of the Securities Investor 
Protection Corporation (SIPC). SIPC doesn’t protect you from market losses; it 
protects your money in case the brokerage firm goes out of business. To find 
out whether the broker is registered with these organizations, contact FINRA 
(www.finra.org), SEC (www.sec.gov), or SIPC (www.sipc.org). See 
Appendix A for more information on these organizations.

99
 Chapter 7: Going for Brokers
Distinguishing between Full-Service 
and Discount Brokers
Stockbrokers fall into two basic categories: full-service and discount. The 
type you choose really depends on what type of investor you are. Here are 
the differences in a nutshell:
 
✓ Full-service brokers are suitable for investors who need some guidance 
and personal attention.
 
✓ Discount brokers are better for those investors who are sufficiently con-
fident and knowledgeable about stock investing to manage with minimal 
help (usually through the broker’s Web site).
 
Before you deal with any broker (either full-service or discount), get a free 
report on the broker from FINRA by calling 301-590-6500 or visiting its Web 
site at www.finra.org. FINRA can tell you whether any complaints or penal-
ties have been filed against a brokerage firm or an individual rep.
Full-service brokers
Full-service brokers are just what the name indicates. They try to provide as 
many services as possible for investors who open accounts with them. When 
you open an account at a brokerage firm, a representative is assigned to your 
account. This representative is usually called an account executive, a regis-
tered rep, or a financial consultant by the brokerage firm. This person usually 
has a securities license (meaning that he or she is registered with the FINRA 
and the SEC) and is knowledgeable about stocks in particular and investing in 
general.
Examples of full-service brokers are Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Of 
course, all brokers now have full-featured Web sites to give you further infor-
mation about their services. Get as informed as possible before you open 
your account. A full-service broker is there to help you build wealth, not 
make you . . . uh . . . broker.
What they can do for you
Your account executive is responsible for assisting you, answering questions 
about your account and the securities in your portfolio, and transacting your 
buy and sell orders. Here are some things that full-service brokers can do 
for you:

100
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
 
✓ Offer guidance and advice. The greatest distinction between full-service 
brokers and discount brokers is the personal attention you receive from 
your account rep. You get to be on a first-name basis with a full-service 
broker, and you disclose much information about your finances and 
financial goals. The rep is there to make recommendations about stocks 
and funds that are hopefully suitable for you.
 
✓ Provide access to research. Full-service brokers can give you access 
to their investment research department, which can give you in-depth 
information and analysis on a particular company. This information can 
be very valuable, but be aware of the pitfalls. (See the section “Judging 
Brokers’ Recommendations,” later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Help you achieve your investment objectives. A good rep gets to know 
you and your investment goals and then offers advice and answers your 
questions about how specific investments and strategies can help you 
accomplish your wealth-building goals.
 
✓ Make investment decisions on your behalf. Many investors don’t want 
to be bothered when it comes to investment decisions. Full-service bro-
kers can actually make decisions for your account with your authoriza-
tion. This service is fine, but be sure to require them to explain their 
choices to you.
What to watch out for
Although full-service brokers, with their seemingly limitless assistance, can 
make life easy for an investor, you need to remember some important points 
to avoid problems:
 
✓ Brokers and account reps are salespeople. No matter how well they 
treat you, they’re still compensated based on their ability to produce 
revenue for the brokerage firm. They generate commissions and fees 
from you on behalf of the company. (In other words, they’re paid to sell 
you things.)
 
✓ Whenever your rep makes a suggestion or recommendation, be sure 
to ask why and request a complete answer that includes the reasoning 
behind the recommendation. A good advisor is able to clearly explain 
the reasoning behind every suggestion. If you don’t fully understand and 
agree with the advice, don’t take it.
 
✓ Working with a full-service broker costs more than working with a dis-
count broker. Discount brokers are paid for simply buying or selling 
stocks for you. Full-service brokers do that and much more, like provide 
advice and guidance. Because of that, full-service brokers are more 
expensive (through higher brokerage commissions and advisory fees). 
Also, most full-service brokers expect you to invest at least $5,000 to 
$10,000 just to open an account.

101
 Chapter 7: Going for Brokers
 
✓ Handing over decision-making authority to your rep can be a possible 
negative because letting others make financial decisions for you is 
always dicey — especially when they’re using your money. If they make 
poor investment choices that lose you money, you may not have any 
recourse because you authorized them to act on your behalf.
 
✓ Some brokers engage in an activity called churning. Churning is basi-
cally buying and selling stocks for the sole purpose of generating com-
missions. Churning is great for brokers but bad for customers. If your 
account shows a lot of activity, ask for justification. Commissions, espe-
cially by full-service brokers, can take a big bite out of your wealth, so 
don’t tolerate churning or other suspicious activity.
Discount brokers
Perhaps you don’t need any hand-holding from a broker (that’d be kinda 
weird anyway). You know what you want, and you can make your own invest-
ment decisions. All you need is a convenient way to transact your buy/sell 
orders. In that case, go with a discount broker. They don’t offer advice 
or premium services — just the basics required to perform your stock 
transactions.
Discount brokers, as the name implies, are cheaper to engage than full-
service brokers. Because you’re advising yourself (or getting advice and 
information from third parties such as newsletters, hotlines, or independent 
advisors), you can save on costs that you’d incur if you used a full-service 
broker.
 
If you choose to work with a discount broker, you must know as much as pos-
sible about your personal goals and needs. You have a greater responsibility 
for conducting adequate research to make good stock selections, and you 
must be prepared to accept the outcome, whatever that may be. (See Part III 
for details on researching stock selections.)
For a while, the regular investor had two types of discount brokers to choose 
from: conventional discount brokers and Internet discount brokers. But the 
two are basically synonymous now, so the differences are hardly worth men-
tioning. Through industry consolidation, most of the conventional discount 
brokers today have fully featured Web sites, while Internet discount brokers 
have adapted by adding more telephone and face-to-face services.
Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade are examples of conventional discount 
brokers that have adapted well to the Internet era. Internet brokers such as 
E*TRADE.com, TradeKing.com, Scottrade.com, and thinkorswim.com 
have added more conventional services.

What they can do for you
Discount brokers offer some significant advantages over full-service brokers, 
such as:
 
✓ Lower cost: This lower cost is usually the result of lower commissions, 
and it’s the primary benefit of using discount brokers.
 
✓ Unbiased service: Because they don’t offer advice, discount brokers 
have no vested interest in trying to sell you any particular stock.
 
✓ Access to information: Established discount brokers offer extensive 
educational materials at their offices or on their Web sites.
What to watch out for
Of course, doing business with discount brokers also has its downside, 
including the following:
 
✓ No guidance: Because you’ve chosen a discount broker, you know not 
to expect guidance, but the broker should make this fact clear to you 
anyway. If you’re a knowledgeable investor, the lack of advice is consid-
ered a positive thing — no interference.
 
✓ Hidden fees: Discount brokers may shout about their lower commis-
sions, but commissions aren’t their only way of making money. Many 
discount brokers charge extra for services that you may think are 
included, such as issuing a stock certificate or mailing a statement. Ask 
whether they assess fees for maintaining IRAs or for transferring stocks 
and other securities (like bonds) in or out of your account, and find 
out what interest rates they charge for borrowing through brokerage 
accounts.
 
✓ Minimal customer service: If you deal with an Internet brokerage firm, 
find out about its customer service capability. If you can’t transact busi-
ness on its Web site, find out where you can call for assistance with 
your order.
Choosing a Broker
Before you choose a broker, you need to analyze your personal investing 
style (as I explain in Chapter 3), and then you can proceed to finding the 
kind of broker that fits your needs. It’s almost like choosing shoes; if you 
don’t know your size, you can’t get a proper fit (and you can be in for a really 
uncomfortable future).

103
 Chapter 7: Going for Brokers
 
When it’s time to choose a broker, keep the following points in mind:
 
✓ Match your investment style with a brokerage firm that charges the least 
amount of money for the services you’re likely to use most frequently.
 
✓ Compare all the costs of buying, selling, and holding stocks and other 
securities through a broker. Don’t compare only commissions; compare 
other costs, too, like margin interest and other service charges (see 
the earlier section, “Defining the Broker’s Role,” for more about these 
costs).
 
✓ Use broker comparison services available in financial publications such 
as SmartMoney and Barron’s (and, of course, their Web sites).
 
Finding brokers is easy. They’re listed in the Yellow Pages (or on directory 
sites like www.superpages.com), in many investment publications, and on 
many financial Web sites. Start your search by using the sources in Appendix 
A, which includes a list of the major brokerage firms.
Discovering Various Types 
of Brokerage Accounts
When you start investing in the stock market, you have to somehow actu-
ally pay for the stocks you buy. Most brokerage firms offer investors several 
types of accounts, each serving a different purpose. I present three of the 
most common types in the following sections. The basic difference boils 
down to how particular brokers view your creditworthiness when it comes 
to buying and selling securities. If your credit isn’t great, your only choice is 
a cash account. If your credit is good, you can open either a cash account or 
a margin account. After you qualify for a margin account, you can (with addi-
tional approval) upgrade it to do options trades.
 
To open an account, you have to fill out an application and submit a check 
or money order for at least the minimum amount required to establish an 
account.
Cash accounts
A cash account (also referred to as a Type 1 account) means just what you 
think it means. You must deposit a sum of money along with the new account 
application to begin trading. The amount of your initial deposit varies from 

104
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
broker to broker. Some brokers have a minimum of $10,000; others let you 
open an account for as little as $500. Once in a while you may see a broker 
offering cash accounts with no minimum deposit, usually as part of a promo-
tion. Use the resources in Appendix A to help you shop around. Qualifying for 
a cash account is usually easy, as long as you have cash and a pulse.
With a cash account, your money has to be deposited in the account before 
the closing (or settlement) date for any trade you make. The closing occurs 
three business days after the date you make the trade (the date of execution). 
You may be required to have the money in the account even before the date of 
execution. See Chapter 6 for details on these and other important dates.
In other words, if you call your broker on Monday, October 10, and order 
50 shares of CashLess Corp. at $20 per share, then on Thursday, October 13, 
you better have $1,000 in cash sitting in your account (plus commission). 
Otherwise, the purchase doesn’t go through.
In addition, ask the broker how long it takes deposited cash (such as a check) 
to be available for investing. Some brokers put a hold on checks for up to ten 
business days, regardless of how soon that check clears your account (that 
would drive me crazy!).
 
See whether your broker will pay you interest on the uninvested cash in your 
brokerage account. Some brokers offer a service in which uninvested money 
earns money market rates, and you can even choose between a regular money 
market account and a tax-free municipal money market account.
Margin accounts
A margin account (also called a Type 2 account) allows you to borrow money 
against the securities in the account to buy more stock. Because you can 
borrow in a margin account, you have to be qualified and approved by the 
broker. After you’re approved, this newfound credit gives you more leverage 
so you can buy more stock or do short-selling. (You can read more about 
buying on margin and short-selling in Chapter 18.)
For stock trading, the margin limit is 50 percent. For example, if you plan to 
buy $10,000 worth of stock on margin, you need at least $5,000 in cash (or 
securities owned) sitting in your account. The interest rate you pay varies 
depending on the broker, but most brokers generally charge a rate that’s sev-
eral points higher than their own borrowing rate.

105
 Chapter 7: Going for Brokers
Why use margin? Margin is to stocks what mortgage is to buying real estate. 
You can buy real estate with all cash, but using borrowed funds often makes 
sense because you may not have enough money to make a 100 percent cash 
purchase, or you may just prefer not to pay all cash. With margin, you can, 
for example, buy $10,000 worth of stock with as little as $5,000. The balance 
of the stock purchase is acquired using a loan (margin) from the brokerage 
firm.
 
Personally, I’m not a big fan of margin, and I use it sparingly. Margin is a form 
of leverage that can work out fine if you’re correct but can be very danger-
ous if the market moves against you. It’s best applied with stocks that are 
generally stable and dividend-paying. That way, the dividends help pay off the 
margin interest.
Option accounts
An option account (also referred to as a Type 3 account) gives you all the capa-
bilities of a margin account (which in turn also gives you the capabilities of a 
cash account) plus the ability to trade options on stocks and stock indexes. 
To upgrade your margin account to an option account, the broker usually 
asks you to sign a statement that you’re knowledgeable about options and 
familiar with the risks associated with them.
 
Options can be a very effective addition to a stock investor’s array of wealth-
building investment tools. A more comprehensive review of options is 
available in the book Stock Options For Dummies by Alan R. Simon (Wiley). 
I personally love to use options (as do my clients and students), and I think 
they can be a great tool in your wealth-building arsenal. I discuss options fur-
ther in Chapter 16.
Judging Brokers’ Recommendations
In recent years, Americans have become enamored with a new sport: the 
rating of stocks by brokers on the TV financial shows. Frequently, these 
shows feature a dapper market strategist talking up a particular stock. Some 
stocks have been known to jump significantly right after an influential analyst 
issues a buy recommendation. Analysts’ speculation and opinions make for 
great fun, and many people take their views very seriously. However, most 
investors should be very wary when analysts, especially the glib ones on TV, 
make a recommendation. It’s often just showbiz. In the following sections, 
I define basic broker recommendations and list a few important consider-
ations for evaluating them.

106
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
Understanding basic recommendations
Brokers issue their recommendations (advice) as a general idea of how much 
regard they have for a particular stock. The following list presents the basic 
recommendations (or ratings) and what they mean to you:
 
✓ Strong buy and buy: Hot diggity dog! These ratings are the ones to get. 
The analyst loves this pick, and you would be very wise to get a bunch 
of shares. The thing to keep in mind, however, is that buy recommenda-
tions are probably the most common because (let’s face it) brokers sell 
stocks.
 
✓ Accumulate and market perform: An analyst who issues these types of 
recommendations is positive, yet unexcited, about the pick. This rating 
is akin to asking a friend whether he likes your new suit and getting the 
response “It’s nice” in a monotone voice. It’s a polite reply, but you wish 
his opinion had been more definitive.
 
✓ Hold or neutral: Analysts use this language when their backs are to 
the wall, but they still don’t want to say, “Sell that loser!” This recom-
mendation reminds me of my mother telling me to be nice and either say 
something positive or keep my mouth shut. In this case, the rating is the 
analyst’s way of keeping his mouth shut.
 
✓ Sell: Many analysts should have issued this recommendation during the 
bear market of 2000–2002 but didn’t. What a shame. So many investors 
lost money because some analysts were too nice (or biased?) or just 
afraid to be honest, sound the alarm, and urge people to sell.
 
✓ Avoid like the plague: I’m just kidding about this one, but I wish that 
this recommendation was available. I’ve seen plenty of stocks that I 
thought were dreadful investments — stocks of companies that made no 
money, were in terrible financial condition, and should never have been 
considered at all. Yet investors gobble up billions of dollars’ worth of 
stocks that eventually become worthless.
Asking a few important questions
Don’t get me wrong. An analyst’s recommendation is certainly a better tip 
than what you’d get from your barber or your sister-in-law’s neighbor, but 
you want to view recommendations from analysts with a healthy dose of 
reality. Analysts have biases because their employment depends on the very 
companies that are being presented. What investors need to listen to when a 
broker talks up a stock is the reasoning behind the recommendation. In other 
words, why is the broker making this recommendation?

107
 Chapter 7: Going for Brokers
Keep in mind that analysts’ recommendations can play a useful role in your 
personal stock investing research. If you find a great stock and then you hear 
analysts give glowing reports on the same stock, you’re on the right track! 
Here are some questions and points to keep in mind:
 
✓ How does the analyst arrive at a rating? The analyst’s approach to 
evaluating a stock can help you round out your research as you consult 
other sources such as newsletters and independent advisory services.
 
✓ What analytical approach is the analyst using? Some analysts use fun-
damental analysis — looking at the company’s financial condition and 
factors related to its success, such as its standing within the industry 
and the overall market. Other analysts use technical analysis — look-
ing at the company’s stock price history and judging past stock price 
movements to derive some insight regarding the stock’s future price 
movement. Many analysts use a combination of the two. Is this analyst’s 
approach similar to your approach, or to those of sources that you 
respect or admire?
 
✓ What is the analyst’s track record? Has the analyst had a consistently 
good record through both bull and bear markets? Major financial pub-
lications, such as Barron’s and Hulbert Financial Digest, and Web sites, 
such as MarketWatch.com, regularly track recommendations from 
well-known analysts and stock pickers.
 
✓ How does the analyst treat important aspects of the company’s perfor-
mance, such as sales and earnings? How about the company’s balance 
sheet? The essence of a healthy company is growing sales and earn-
ings coupled with strong assets and low debt. (See Chapter 11 for more 
details on these topics.)
 
✓ Is the industry that the company’s in doing well? Do the analysts give 
you insight on this important information? A strong company in a weak 
industry can’t stay strong for long. The right industry is a critical part of 
the stock selection process (for more information, see Chapter 13).
 
✓ What research sources does the analyst cite? Does the analyst quote 
the federal government or industry trade groups to support her thesis? 
These sources are important because they help give a more complete 
picture regarding the company’s prospects for success. Imagine that 
you decide on the stock of a strong company. What if the federal gov-
ernment (through agencies like the SEC) is penalizing the company for 
fraudulent activity? Or what if the company’s industry is shrinking or 
has ceased to grow (making it tougher for the company to continue 
growing)? The astute investor looks at a variety of sources before 
buying stock.

108
Part II: Before Your Start Buying 
 
✓ Is the analyst rational when citing a target price for a stock? When he 
says, “We think the stock will hit $100 per share within 12 months,” is 
he presenting a rational model, such as basing the share price on a pro-
jected price/earnings ratio (see Chapter 11)? The analyst must be able to 
provide a logical scenario explaining why the stock has a good chance 
of achieving the cited target price within the time frame mentioned. You 
may not necessarily agree with the analyst’s conclusion, but the expla-
nation can help you decide whether the stock choice is well thought out.
 
✓ Does the company that’s being recommended have any ties to the ana-
lyst or the analyst’s firm? During 2000–2002, the financial industry got 
bad publicity because many analysts gave positive recommendations on 
stocks of companies that were doing business with the very firms that 
employed those analysts. This conflict of interest is probably the biggest 
reason that analysts were so wrong in their recommendations during 
that period. Ask your broker to disclose any conflict of interest.
 
✓ What school of economic thought does the analyst adhere to? This 
may sound like an odd question, and it may not be readily answered, 
but it’s a good thing to know. If I had to choose between two analysts 
that were very similar except that Analyst A adhered to the Keynesian 
school of economic thought and Analyst B adhered to the Austrian 
school, guess what? I’d choose Analyst B because those who embrace 
the Austrian school have a much better grasp of real-world economics 
(which means better stock investment choices). For more discussion on 
this point, see Chapter 10.
 
The bottom line with brokerage recommendations is that you shouldn’t use 
them to buy or sell a stock. Instead, use them to confirm your own research. 
I know that if I buy a stock based on my own research and later discover the 
same stock being talked up on the financial shows, that’s just the icing on the 
cake. The experts may be great to listen to, and their recommendations can 
augment your own opinions, but they’re no substitute for your own careful 
research. I devote Part III of this book to chapters on researching and picking 
winning stocks.

Chapter 8
Investing for Growth
In This Chapter
▶ Balancing growth and value
▶ Figuring out how to choose growth stocks
▶ Looking at small caps and other speculative investments
W
hat’s the number one reason people invest in stocks? To grow their 
wealth (also referred to as capital appreciation). Yes, some people 
invest for income (in the form of dividends), but that’s a different matter (I 
discuss investing for income in Chapter 9). Investors seeking growth would 
rather see the money that could have been distributed as dividends be 
reinvested in the company so that (hopefully) a greater gain is achieved by 
seeing the stock’s price rise or appreciate. People interested in growing their 
wealth see stocks as one of the convenient ways to do it. Growth stocks tend 
to be riskier than other categories of stocks, but they offer excellent long-
term prospects for making the big bucks. If you don’t believe me, just ask 
Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, and other successful, long-term investors.
Although someone like Buffett is not considered a growth investor, his long-
term, value-oriented approach has been a successful growth strategy. If 
you’re the type of investor who has enough time to let somewhat risky stocks 
trend upward or who has enough money so that a loss won’t devastate you 
financially, then growth stocks are definitely for you. As they say, no guts, no 
glory. The challenge is to figure out which stocks make you richer quicker; 
I give you tips on how to do so in this chapter.
 
Short of starting your own business, stock investing is the best way to profit 
from a business venture. I want to emphasize that to make money in stocks 
consistently over the long haul, you must remember that you’re investing in a 
company; buying the stock is just a means for you to participate in the compa-
ny’s success (or failure). Why does it matter that you think of stock investing 
as buying a company versus buying a stock? Invest in a stock only if you’re just 

110
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
as excited about it as you would be if you were the CEO and in charge of run-
ning the company. If you’re the sole owner of the company, do you act differ-
ently than one of a legion of obscure stockholders? Of course you do. As the 
firm’s owner, you have a greater interest in the company. You have a strong 
desire to know how the enterprise is doing. As you invest in stocks, make 
believe that you’re the owner, and take an active interest in the company’s 
products, services, sales, earnings, and so on. This attitude and discipline can 
enhance your goals as a stock investor. This approach is especially important 
if your investment goal is growth.
Becoming a Value-Oriented 
Growth Investor
 
A stock is considered a growth stock when it’s growing faster and higher than 
the overall stock market. Basically, a growth stock performs better than its 
peers in categories such as sales and earnings. Value stocks are stocks that are 
priced lower than the value of the company and its assets — you can identify 
a value stock by analyzing the company’s fundamentals and looking at key 
financial ratios, such as the price-to-earnings ratio. (For more on the topic 
of ratios, see Appendix B.) Growth stocks tend to have better prospects for 
growth for the immediate future (from one to four years), but value stocks 
tend to have less risk and more steady growth over a longer term.
Over the years, a debate has quietly raged in the financial community about 
growth versus value investing. Some people believe that growth and value 
are mutually exclusive. They maintain that large numbers of people buying 
stock with growth as the expectation tend to drive up the stock price relative 
to the company’s current value. Growth investors, for example, aren’t put off 
by price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 30, 40, or higher. Value investors, mean-
while, are too nervous buying a stock at those P/E ratio levels.
However, you can have both. A value-oriented approach to growth invest-
ing serves you best. Long-term growth stock investors spend time analyz-
ing the company’s fundamentals to make sure that the company’s growth 
prospects lie on a solid foundation. But what if you have to choose between 
a growth stock and a value stock? Which do you choose? Seek value when 
you’re buying the stock and analyze the company’s prospects for growth. 
Growth includes but is not limited to the health and growth of the company’s 
specific industry, the economy at large, and the general political climate (see 
Chapters 10, 13, 14, and 15).

111
 Chapter 8: Investing for Growth
 
The bottom line is that growth is much easier to achieve when you seek solid, 
value-oriented companies in growing industries. To better understand indus-
tries and how they affect stock value, see Chapter 13.
 
Value-oriented growth investing probably has the longest history of success 
compared to most stock investing philosophies. The track record for those 
people who use value-oriented growth investing is enviable. Warren Buffett, 
Benjamin Graham, John Templeton, and Peter Lynch are a few of the more 
well-known practitioners. Each may have his own spin on the concepts, but all 
have successfully applied the basic principles of value-oriented growth invest-
ing over many years.
Choosing Growth Stocks 
with a Few Handy Tips
Although the information in the previous section can help you shrink your 
stock choices from thousands of stocks to maybe a few dozen or a few hun-
dred (depending on how well the general stock market is doing), the purpose 
of this section is to help you cull the so-so growth stocks to unearth the go-go 
ones. It’s time to dig deeper for the biggest potential winners. Keep in mind 
that you probably won’t find a stock to satisfy all the criteria presented here. 
Just make sure that your selection meets as many criteria as realistically pos-
sible. But hey, if you do find a stock that meets all the criteria cited, buy as 
much as you can!
For the record, my approach to choosing a winning growth stock is probably 
almost the reverse method of . . . uh . . . that screaming money guy on TV 
(I won’t mention his name!). People watch his show for “tips” on “hot stocks.” 
The frenetic host seems to do a rapid-fire treatment of stocks in general. 
You get the impression that he looks over thousands of stocks and says 
“I like this one” and “I don’t like that one.” The viewer has to decide. Sheesh.
Verifiably, 80 to 90 percent of my stock picks are profitable. People ask me 
how I pick a winning stock. I tell them that I don’t just pick a stock and hope 
that it does well. In fact, my personal stock-picking research doesn’t even 
begin with stocks; I first look at the investing environment (politics, econom-
ics, demographics, and so on) and choose which industry will benefit. After I 
know which industry will benefit and prosper accordingly, then I start to ana-
lyze and choose my stock(s).

112
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
After I choose a stock, I wait. Patience is more than just a virtue; it is to 
investing what time is to a seed that is planted in fertile soil. The legendary 
Jesse Livermore said that he didn’t make his stock market fortunes by trad-
ing stocks; his fortunes were made “in the waiting.” Why?
When I tell you to have patience and a long-term perspective, it isn’t because 
I want you to wait years or decades for your stock portfolio to bear fruit. It’s 
because you’re waiting for a specific condition to occur: when the market 
discovers what you have! When you have a good stock in a good industry, it 
takes time for the market to discover it. The simple act that makes a stock 
rise is when it has more buyers than sellers. As time passes, more buyers 
find your stock. As the stock rises, this attracts more attention and therefore 
more buyers. The more time that passes, the better your stock looks to the 
investing public.
 
When you’re choosing growth stocks, you should consider investing in a com-
pany only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit 
and from where it generates sales. Part of your research means looking at the 
industry (see Chapter 13) and economic trends in general.
Looking for leaders in megatrends
A strong company in a growing industry is a common recipe for success. If 
you look at the history of stock investing, this point comes up constantly. 
Investors need to be on the alert for megatrends because they help ensure 
success.
A megatrend is a major development that has huge implications for much (if 
not all) of society for a long time to come. Good examples are the advent of 
the Internet and the aging of America. Both of these trends offer significant 
challenges and opportunities for our economy. Take the Internet, for exam-
ple. Its potential for economic application is still being developed. Millions 
are flocking to it for many reasons. And census data tells us that senior 
citizens (over 65) will be the fastest-growing segment of our population 
during the next 20 years. How does the stock investor take advantage of a 
megatrend?
In 2008, the big news was the credit crisis that slammed the stock markets 
(in the U.S. and across the globe). A megatrend — indebtedness to the tune 
of trillions — hit as predicted in the previous edition of Stock Investing For 
Dummies. Investors who stayed alert were able to get their money out of 
harm’s way by moving it out of sectors most affected by the credit crisis, 
such as bank and brokerage stocks. Stocks tied to human need (such as food 
and water) fared much better as a group.

113
 Chapter 8: Investing for Growth
In this 3rd edition, I plan to do what I did in the 2nd edition, which is to help 
you identify the megatrends that are in place to make it easier for you to 
pick winning stocks (you’re welcome!). For emerging megatrends, check out 
Chapter 14.
Comparing a company’s growth 
to an industry’s growth
You have to measure the growth of a company against something to figure 
out whether it’s a growth stock. Usually, you compare the growth of a com-
pany with growth from other companies in the same industry or with the 
stock market in general. In practical terms, when you measure the growth of 
a stock against the stock market, you’re actually comparing it against a gen-
erally accepted benchmark, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) 
or the Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500). For more on DJIA and S&P 500, see 
Chapter 5.
If a company has earnings growth of 15 percent per year over three years or 
more and the industry’s average growth rate over the same time frame is 10 
percent, then the stock qualifies as a growth stock. You can easily calculate 
the earnings growth rate by comparing a company’s earnings in the current 
year and previous year and computing the difference as a percentage. For 
example, if the company’s earnings (on a per share basis) were $1 last year 
and $1.10 this year, then earnings grew by 10 percent. Many analysts also 
look at a current quarter and compare the earnings to the same quarter from 
the previous year to see if earnings are growing.
 
A growth stock is called that not only because the company is growing but 
also because the company is performing well with some consistency. Having a 
single year where your earnings do well versus the S&P 500’s average doesn’t 
cut it. Growth must be consistently accomplished.
Considering a company 
with a strong niche
 
Companies that have established a strong niche are consistently profitable. 
Look for a company with one or more of the following characteristics:
 
✓ A strong brand: Companies such as Coca-Cola and Microsoft come to 
mind. Yes, other companies out there can make soda or software, but a 
business needs a lot more than a similar product to topple companies 
that have established an almost irrevocable identity with the public.

114
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
 
✓ High barriers to entry: United Parcel Service and Federal Express have 
set up tremendous distribution and delivery networks that competitors 
can’t easily duplicate. High barriers to entry offer an important edge 
to companies that are already established. Examples of high barriers 
include high capital requirements (needing lots of cash to start) or spe-
cial technology that’s not easily produced or acquired.
 
✓ Research and development (R&D): Companies such as Pfizer and Merck 
spend a lot of money researching and developing new pharmaceutical 
products. This investment becomes a new product with millions of con-
sumers who become loyal purchasers, so the company’s going to grow. 
You can find out what companies spend on R&D by checking their finan-
cial statements and their annual reports (more on this in Chapter 12).
Checking out a company’s fundamentals
 
When you hear the word fundamentals in the world of stock investing, it refers 
to the company’s financial condition and related data. When investors (espe-
cially value investors) do fundamental analysis, they look at the company’s 
fundamentals — its balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, and other 
operational data, along with external factors such as the company’s market 
position, industry, and economic prospects. Essentially, the fundamentals 
indicate the company’s financial condition. Chapter 11 goes into greater detail 
about analyzing a company’s financial condition. However, the main numbers 
you want to look at include the following:
 
✓ Sales: Are the company’s sales this year surpassing last year’s? As a 
decent benchmark, you want to see sales at least 10 percent higher than 
last year. Although it may differ depending on the industry, 10 percent is 
a reasonable, general yardstick.
 
✓ Earnings: Are earnings at least 10 percent higher than last year? 
Earnings should grow at the same rate as sales (or, hopefully, better).
 
✓ Debt: Is the company’s total debt equal to or lower than the prior year? 
The death knell of many a company has been excessive debt.
A company’s financial condition has more factors than I mention here, 
but these numbers are the most important. I also realize that using the 10 
percent figure may seem like an oversimplification, but you don’t need to 
complicate matters unnecessarily. I know someone’s computerized financial 
model may come out to 9.675 percent or maybe 11.07 percent, but keep it 
simple for now.

 Chapter 8: Investing for Growth
Evaluating a company’s management
The management of a company is crucial to its success. Before you buy stock 
in a company, you want to know that the company’s management is doing a 
great job. But how do you do that? If you call up a company and ask, it may 
not even return your phone call. How do you know whether management is 
running the company properly? The best way is to check the numbers. The 
following sections tell you the numbers you need to check. If the company’s 
management is running the business well, the ultimate result is a rising stock 
price.
Return on equity
 
Although you can measure how well management is doing in several ways, 
you can take a quick snapshot of a management team’s competence by check-
ing the company’s return on equity (ROE). You calculate the ROE simply by 
dividing earnings by equity. The resulting percentage gives you a good idea 
whether the company is using its equity (or net assets) efficiently and profit-
ably. Basically, the higher the percentage, the better, but you can consider the 
ROE solid if the percentage is 10 percent or higher. Keep in mind that not all 
industries have identical ROEs.
To find out a company’s earnings, check out the company’s income state-
ment. The income statement is a simple financial statement that expresses 
this equation: sales (or revenue) less expenses equal net earnings (or net 
income or net profit). You can see an example of an income statement in 
Table 8-1. (I give more details on income statements in Chapter 11.)

$90,000
Expenses

Net earnings

$12,000
To find out a company’s equity, check out that company’s balance sheet. 
(See Chapter 11 for more details on balance sheets.) The balance sheet is 
actually a simple financial statement that illustrates this equation: total 
assets minus total liabilities equal net equity. For public stock companies, 
the net assets are called “shareholders’ equity” or simply “equity.” Table 8-2 
shows a balance sheet for Grobaby, Inc.

Table 8-1 shows that Grobaby’s earnings went from $7,000 to $12,000. In 
Table 8-2, you can see that Grobaby increased the equity from $35,000 to 
$40,000 in one year. The ROE for the year 2007 is 20 percent ($7,000 in earn-
ings divided by $35,000 in equity), which is a solid number. The following 
year, the ROE is 30 percent ($12,000 in earnings divided by $40,000 equity), 
another solid number. A good minimum ROE is 10 percent, but 15 percent or 
more is preferred.
Equity and earnings growth
Two additional barometers of success are a company’s growth in earnings 
and growth of equity.
 
✓ Look at the growth in earnings in Table 8-1. The earnings grew from 
$7,000 (in 2007) to $12,000 (in 2008), or a percentage increase of 71 per-
cent ($12,000 less $7,000 equals $5,000, and $5,000 divided by $7,000 is 
71 percent), which is excellent. At a minimum, earnings growth should 
be equal or better to the rate of inflation, but because that’s not always 
a reliable number, I like at least 10 percent.
 
✓ In Table 8-2, Grobaby’s equity grew by $5,000 (from $35,000 to $40,000), 
or 14 percent, which is very good — management is doing good things 
here. I like to see equity increasing by 10 percent or better.
Insider buying
 
Watching management as it manages the business is important, but another 
indicator of how well the company is doing is to see whether management is 
buying stock in the company as well. If a company is poised for growth, who 
knows better than management? And if management is buying up the compa-
ny’s stock en masse, then that’s a great indicator of the stock’s potential. See 
Chapter 20 for more details on insider buying.

117
 Chapter 8: Investing for Growth
Noticing who’s buying and/or 
recommending a company’s stock
 
You can invest in a great company and still see its stock go nowhere. Why? 
Because what makes the stock go up is demand — having more buyers than 
sellers of the stock. If you pick a stock for all the right reasons and the market 
notices the stock as well, that attention causes the stock price to climb. The 
things to watch for include the following:
 
✓ Institutional buying: Are mutual funds and pension plans buying up 
the stock you’re looking at? If so, this type of buying power can exert 
tremendous upward pressure on the stock’s price. Some resources and 
publications track institutional buying and how that affects any par-
ticular stock. (You can find these resources in Appendix A.) Frequently, 
when a mutual fund buys a stock, others soon follow. In spite of all the 
talk about independent research, a herd mentality still exists.
 
✓ Analysts’ attention: Are analysts talking about the stock on the financial 
shows? As much as you should be skeptical about an analyst’s recom-
mendation (given the stock market debacle of 2000–2002 and the market 
problems in 2008), it offers some positive reinforcement for your stock. 
Don’t ever buy a stock solely on the basis of an analyst’s recommenda-
tion. Just know that if you buy a stock based on your own research, and 
analysts subsequently rave about it, your stock price is likely to go up. A 
single recommendation by an influential analyst can be enough to send a 
stock skyward.
 
✓ Newsletter recommendations: Independent researchers usually pub-
lish newsletters. If influential newsletters are touting your choice, that 
praise is also good for your stock. Although some great newsletters are 
out there (find them in Appendix A) and they offer information that’s as 
good or better than the research departments of some brokerage firms, 
don’t use a single tip to base your investment decision on. But it should 
make you feel good if the newsletters tout a stock that you’ve already 
chosen.
 
✓ Consumer publications: No, you won’t find investment advice here. This 
one seems to come out of left field, but it’s a source that you should 
notice. Publications such as Consumer Reports regularly look at products 
and services and rate them for consumer satisfaction. If a company’s 
offerings are well received by consumers, that’s a strong positive for the 
company. This kind of attention ultimately has a positive effect on that 
company’s stock.

118
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
Making sure a company 
continues to do well
A company’s financial situation does change, and you, as a diligent investor, 
need to continue to look at the numbers for as long as the stock is in your 
portfolio. You may have chosen a great stock from a great company with 
great numbers in 2006, but chances are pretty good that the numbers have 
changed since then.
Protecting your downside
I become a Johnny-one-note on one topic: trail-
ing stops. (See Chapter 18 for a full explanation 
of trailing stops.) Trailing stops are stop losses 
that you regularly manage with the stock you 
invest in. I usually advocate using them, espe-
cially if you’re new to the game of buying growth 
stocks. Trailing stops can help you, no matter 
how good or bad the economy is (or how good 
or bad the stock you’re investing in is).
Suppose that you had invested in Enron, a clas-
sic example of a phenomenal growth stock 
that went bad. In 1999 and 2000, when its stock 
soared, investors were as happy as chocohol-
ics at Hershey. Along with many investors who 
forgot that sound investing takes discipline and 
research, Enron investors thought, “Downside 
risk? What downside risk?”
Here’s an example of how a stop-loss order 
would have worked if you had invested in Enron. 
Suppose that you bought Enron in 2000 at $50 
per share and put in a stop-loss order with your 
broker at $45. (Remember to make it a good-till-
canceled, or GTC, order. If you do, the stop-loss 
order stays on indefinitely.) As a general rule, I 
like to place the stop-loss order at 10 percent 
below the market value. As the stock went up, 
you kept the stop loss trailing upward like a tail. 
(Now you know why it’s called a “trailing” stop; 
it trails the stock’s price.) When Enron hit $70, 
your stop loss was changed to, say, $63, and 
so on. At $84, your new stop loss was at $76. 
Then what?
When Enron started its perilous descent, you 
got out at $76. The new price of $76 triggered 
the stop loss, and the stock was automatically 
sold — you stopped the loss! Actually, in this 
case, you could call it a “stop and cash in the 
gain” order. Because you bought the stock 
at $50 and sold at $76, you pocketed a nice 
capital gain of $26 (52 percent appreciation — 
a-do-en-ron, a-do-en-ron!). Then you safely 
stepped aside and watched the stock continue 
its plunge.
But what if the market is doing well? Are trail-
ing stops a good idea? Because these stops are 
placed below the stock price, you’re not stop-
ping the stock from rising upward indefinitely. 
All you’re doing is protecting your investment 
from loss. That’s discipline! The stock market 
of 2004–2008 was fairly good to stock investors 
as the bear market that started in 2000 took 
a break. If a bear market continues, trailing 
stop strategies will again become very useful 
because a potential decline in the stock price 
will become a greater risk.

119
 Chapter 8: Investing for Growth
 
Great stocks don’t always stay that way. A great selection that you’re drawn 
to today may become tomorrow’s pariah. Information, both good and bad, 
moves like lightning. Keep an eye on your stock company’s numbers! To help 
minimize the downside risk, see the nearby sidebar for an example. For more 
information on a company’s financial data, check out Chapter 11.
Heeding investing lessons from history
A growth stock isn’t a creature like the Loch Ness monster — always talked 
about but rarely seen. Growth stocks have been part of the financial scene 
for nearly a century. Examples abound that offer rich information that you 
can apply to today’s stock market environment. Look at past market winners, 
especially those of the 1970s and 1980s, and ask yourself, “What made them 
profitable stocks?” I mention these two decades because they offer a stark 
contrast to each other. The ’70s were a tough, bearish decade for stocks, 
while the ’80s were booming bull times. (See Chapter 14 for details on bear 
and bull markets.)
 
Being aware and acting logically is as vital to successful stock investing as it 
is to any other pursuit. Over and over again, history gives you the formula for 
successful stock investing:
 
✓ Pick a company that has strong fundamentals, including signs such as 
rising sales and earnings and low debt. (See Chapter 11.)
 
✓ Make sure that the company is in a growing industry. (See Chapter 13.)
 
✓ Be fully invested in stocks during a bull market, when prices are rising in 
the stock market and in the general economy. (See Chapter 14.)
 
✓ During a bear market, switch more of your money out of growth stocks 
(such as technology) and into defensive stocks (such as utilities).
 
✓ Monitor your stocks. Hold onto stocks that continue to have growth 
potential, and sell those stocks with declining prospects. (See Chap-
ter 24 for some red flags for stock investors.)
Exploring Small Caps and 
Speculative Stocks
Everyone wants to get in early on a hot new stock. Why not? You buy 
Shlobotky, Inc., at $1 per share and hope it zooms to $98 before lunch-
time. Who doesn’t want to buy a stock that could become the next IBM or 
Microsoft? This possibility is why investors are attracted to small cap stocks.

120
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
Small cap (or small capitalization) is a reference to the company’s market 
size, as I explain in Chapter 1. Small cap stocks are stocks that have a market 
value under $1 billion. Investors may face more risk with small caps, but they 
also have the chance for greater gains.
Out of all the types of stocks, small cap stocks continue to exhibit the great-
est amount of growth. In the same way that a tree planted last year has more 
opportunity for growth than a mature 100-year-old redwood, small caps have 
greater growth potential than established large cap stocks. Of course, a small 
cap doesn’t exhibit spectacular growth just because it’s small. It grows when 
it does the right things, such as increasing sales and earnings by producing 
goods and services that customers want.
 
For every small company that becomes a Fortune 500 firm, hundreds of com-
panies don’t grow at all or go out of business. When you try to guess the next 
great stock before any evidence of growth, you’re not investing — you’re spec-
ulating. Have you heard that one before? (If not, flip to Chapter 2 for details.) 
Of course you have, and you’ll hear it again. Don’t get me wrong — there’s 
nothing wrong with speculating. But it’s important to know that you’re specu-
lating when you’re doing it. If you’re going to speculate in small stocks hoping 
for the next Google, then use the guidelines I present in the following sections 
to increase your chances of success.
Know when to avoid IPOs
Initial public offerings (IPOs) are the birthplace of public stocks, or the pro-
verbial ground floor. The IPO is the first offering to the public of a company’s 
stock. The IPO is also referred to as “going public.” Because a company’s 
going public is frequently an unproven enterprise, investing in an IPO can be 
risky. Here are the two types of IPOs:
 
✓ Start-up IPO: This is a company that didn’t exist before the IPO. In other 
words, the entrepreneurs get together and create a business plan. To get 
the financing they need for the company, they decide to go public imme-
diately by approaching an investment banker. If the investment banker 
thinks that it’s a good concept, the banker will seek funding (selling the 
stock to investors) via the IPO.
 
✓ A private company that decides to go public: In many cases, the IPO is 
done for a company that already exists and is seeking expansion capital. 
The company may have been around for a long time as a smaller private 
concern, but it decides to seek funding through an IPO to grow even 
larger (or to fund a new product, promotional expenses, and so on).

121
 Chapter 8: Investing for Growth
Which of the two IPOs do you think is less risky? That’s right — the private 
company going public. Why? Because it’s already a proven business, which 
is a safer bet than a brand-new start-up. Some great examples of successful 
IPOs in recent years are United Parcel Service and Google (they were both 
established companies before they went public).
Great stocks started as small companies going public. You may be able to 
recount the stories of Federal Express, Dell, AOL, Home Depot, and hundreds 
of other great successes. But do you remember an IPO by the company 
Lipschitz & Farquar? No? I didn’t think so. It’s among the majority of IPOs 
that don’t succeed.
 
IPOs have a poor track record of success in their first year. Studies periodi-
cally done by the brokerage industry have revealed that IPOs (more times 
than not) actually decline in price 60 percent of the time during the first 12 
months. In other words, an IPO has a better than even chance of dropping 
in price. For investors, the lesson is clear: Wait until a track record appears 
before you invest in a company. If you don’t, you’re simply rolling the dice 
(in other words, you’re speculating, not investing!). Don’t worry about missing 
that great opportunity; if it’s a bona fide opportunity, you’ll still do well after 
the IPO.
Make sure a small cap stock 
is making money
I emphasize two points when investing in stocks:
 
✓ Make sure that a company is established. (Being in business for at least 
three years is a good minimum.)
 
✓ Make sure that a company is profitable.
These points are especially important for investors in small stocks. Plenty 
of start-up ventures lose money but hope to make a fortune down the road. 
A good example is a company in the biotechnology industry. Biotech is an 
exciting area, but it’s esoteric, and at this early stage, companies are find-
ing it difficult to use the technology in profitable ways. You may say, “But 
shouldn’t I jump in now in anticipation of future profits?” You may get lucky, 
but understand that when you invest in unproven, small cap stocks, you’re 
speculating.

122
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
Analyze small cap stocks before you invest
The only difference between a small cap stock and a large cap stock is a few 
zeros in their numbers and the fact that you need to do more research with 
small caps. By sheer dint of size, small caps are riskier than large caps, so 
you offset the risk by accruing more information on yourself and the stock 
in question. Plenty of information is available on large cap stocks because 
they’re widely followed. Small cap stocks don’t get as much press, and fewer 
analysts issue reports on them. Here are a few points to keep in mind:
 
✓ Understand your investment style. Small cap stocks may have more 
potential rewards, but they also carry more risk. No investor should 
devote a large portion of his capital to small cap stocks. If you’re consid-
ering retirement money, you’re better off investing in large cap stocks, 
exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investment-grade bonds, bank accounts, 
and mutual funds. For example, retirement money should be in invest-
ments that are either very safe or have proven track records of steady 
growth over an extended period of time (five years or longer).
 
✓ Check with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Get the 
financial reports that the company must file with the SEC (such as its 
10Ks and 10Qs — see Chapter 6 for more details). These reports offer 
more complete information on the company’s activities and finances. 
Go to the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov and check its massive database 
of company filings at EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and 
Retrieval system). You can also check to see whether any complaints 
have been filed against the company.
 
✓ Check other sources. See whether brokers and independent research 
services, such as Value Line, follow the stock. If two or more differ-
ent sources like the stock, it’s worth further investigation. Check the 
resources in Appendix A for further sources of information before you 
invest.

nvesting for income means investing in stocks that provide you with 
regular cash payments (dividends). Income stocks may not seem to offer 
stellar growth potential, but they’re good for a steady infusion of cash. If 
you have a low tolerance for risk, or if your investment goal is anything less 
than long term, income stocks are your best bet. In this chapter, I explain the 
basics of income stocks, show you how to analyze income stocks with a few 
handy formulas, and describe several typical income stocks.
 
Getting your stock portfolio to yield more income is easier than you think. 
Many investors increase income using proven techniques such as covered call 
writing. Covered call writing is beyond the scope of this book, but I encourage 
you to find out more about this technique and whether it applies to your situa-
tion. Talk to your financial advisor or read up on it — it’s covered more fully in 
Stock Options For Dummies by Alan R. Simon (Wiley). You can also find great 
educational material on this option strategy (and many others) at the Chicago 
Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com).
Understanding the Basics 
of Income Stocks
I certainly think that dividend-paying stocks are a great consideration for 
those investors seeking greater income in their portfolios. I especially like 
stocks with higher-than-average dividends (typically 4 percent or greater) 
that are known as income stocks. Income stocks take on a dual role in that 
they can appreciate but also provide regular income. The following sections 
take a closer look at dividends and income stocks.

124
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
Getting a grip on dividends 
and dividend rates
When people talk about gaining income from stocks, they’re usually talk-
ing about dividends. A dividend is nothing more than money paid out to the 
owner of stock. You purchase dividend stocks primarily for income — not for 
spectacular growth potential.
A dividend is quoted as an annual number but is usually paid on a quarterly 
basis. For example, if a stock pays a dividend of $4, you’re probably paid $1 
every quarter. If, in this example, you have 200 shares, you’re paid $800 every 
year (if the dividend doesn’t change during that period), or $200 per quarter. 
Getting that regular dividend check every three months (for as long as you 
hold the stock) can be a nice perk.
 
A good income stock has a higher-than-average dividend (typically 4 percent 
or higher).
 
Dividend rates aren’t guaranteed — they can go up or down, or in some 
extreme cases, the dividend can be discontinued. Fortunately, most compa-
nies that issue dividends continue them indefinitely and actually increase divi-
dend payments from time to time. Historically, dividend increases have 
equaled (or exceeded) the rate of inflation.
Recognizing who’s well-suited 
for income stocks
What type of person is best suited to income stocks? Income stocks can be 
appropriate for many investors, but they’re especially well-suited for the fol-
lowing individuals:
 
✓ Conservative and novice investors: Conservative investors like to see a 
slow-but-steady approach to growing their money while getting regular 
dividend checks. Novice investors who want to start slowly also benefit 
from income stocks.
 
✓ Retirees: Growth investing (which I describe in Chapter 8) is best suited 
for long-term needs, while income investing is best suited to current 
needs. Retirees may want some growth in their portfolios, but they’re 
more concerned with regular income that can keep pace with inflation.
 
✓ Dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) investors: For those investors who 
like to compound their money with DRPs, income stocks are perfect. For 
more information on DRPs, see Chapter 19.

125
 Chapter 9: Investing for Income
Checking out the advantages 
of income stocks
Income stocks tend to be among the least volatile of all stocks, and many 
investors view them as defensive stocks. Defensive stocks are stocks of com-
panies that sell goods and services that are generally needed no matter what 
shape the economy is in. (Don’t confuse defensive stocks with defense stocks, 
which specialize in goods and equipment for the military.) Food, beverage, 
and utility companies are great examples of defensive stocks. Even when the 
economy is experiencing tough times, people still need to eat, drink, and turn 
on the lights. Companies that offer relatively high dividends also tend to be 
large firms in established, stable industries.
 
Some industries in particular are known for high-dividend stocks. Utilities 
(such as electric, gas, and water), real estate investment trusts (REITs), and 
the energy sector (oil and gas royalty trusts) are places where you definitely 
find income stocks. Yes, you can find high-dividend stocks in other industries, 
but you find a high concentration of them in these industries. For more 
details, see the sections highlighting these industries later in this chapter.
Watching out for the disadvantages 
of income stocks
Before you say, “Income stocks are great! I’ll get my checkbook and buy a 
batch right now,” take a look at some potential disadvantages (ugh!). Income 
stocks do come with some fine print.
What goes up . . .
Income stocks can go down as well as up, just as any stock can. The fac-
tors that affect stocks in general — politics (Chapter 15), economic trends 
(Chapter 10), industry changes (Chapter 13), and so on — affect income 
stocks, too. Fortunately, income stocks don’t get hit as hard as other stocks 
when the market is declining, because high dividends tend to act as a sup-
port to the stock price. Therefore, income stocks’ prices usually fall less dra-
matically than other stocks’ prices in a declining market.
Interest-rate sensitivity
Income stocks can be sensitive to rising interest rates. When interest rates go 
up, other investments (such as corporate bonds, U.S. treasury securities, and 
bank certificates of deposit) are more attractive. When your income stock 
yields 4 percent and interest rates go up to 5 percent, 6 percent, or higher, 
you may think, “Hmm. Why settle for a 4 percent yield when I can get 5 per-
cent or better elsewhere?” As more and more investors sell their low-yield 
stock, the prices for those stocks fall.

126
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
Another point to remember is that rising interest rates may hurt the com-
pany’s financial strength. If the company has to pay more interest, that may 
affect the company’s earnings, which in turn may affect the dividend.
 
Dividend-paying companies that are experiencing consistent falling revenues 
tend to cut dividends. In this case, “consistent” means two years or more.
The effect of inflation
Although many companies raise their dividends on a regular basis, some don’t. 
Or if they do raise their dividends, the increases may be small. If income is 
your primary consideration, you want to be aware of this fact. If you’re 
getting the same dividend year after year and this income is important to 
you, rising inflation becomes a problem.
Say that you have XYZ stock at $10 per share with an annual dividend of 30 
cents (the yield is 30 cents divided by $10, or 3 percent). If you have a yield 
of 3 percent two years in a row, how do you feel when inflation rises 6 percent 
one year and 7 percent the next year? Because inflation means your costs 
are rising, inflation shrinks the value of the dividend income you receive. 
Fortunately, studies show that in general, dividends do better in inflationary 
environments than bonds and other fixed-rate investments. Usually, the divi-
dends of companies that provide consumer staples (food, energy, and so on) 
meet or exceed the rate of inflation.
Playing it safe with alternatives 
for generating income
If you’re an investor seeking income and you’re 
nervous about potential risks with income 
stocks, here are some non-stock alternatives:
 ✓ U.S. Treasury securities: Issued by the 
federal government, these securities are 
considered the safest investments in the 
world. Examples of treasury securities are 
U.S. savings bonds and treasury bonds. 
They pay interest and are an ideal addition 
to any income investor’s portfolio.
 ✓ Bank certificates of deposit (CDs): These 
investments are backed by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and 
are considered very safe.
 ✓ Income mutual funds: Many mutual funds, 
such as treasury bond mutual funds and 
corporate bond funds, are designed for 
income investors. They offer investors 
diversification and professional manage-
ment, and you can usually invest with as 
little as $1,000. For more details, refer to 
Mutual Funds For Dummies by Eric Tyson 
(published by Wiley).

127
 Chapter 9: Investing for Income
Uncle Sam’s cut
The government usually taxes dividends as ordinary income. Fortunately, 
recent tax legislation has favored dividend-paying stock. See Chapter 21 for 
more information on taxes for stock investors.
Analyzing Income Stocks
As I explain in the previous section, even conservative income investors can 
be confronted with different types of risk. (Chapter 4 covers the topic of risk 
in greater detail.) Fortunately, this section helps you carefully choose income 
stocks so that you can minimize potential disadvantages.
 
Look at income stocks in the same way you do growth stocks when assessing 
the financial strength of a company. Getting nice dividends comes to a 
screeching halt if the company can’t afford to pay them. If your budget 
depends on dividend income, then monitoring the company’s financial 
strength is that much more important. You can apply the same techniques I 
list in Chapter 8 for assessing the financial strength of growth stocks to your 
assessment of income stocks.
Pinpointing your needs first
You choose income stocks primarily because you want or need income now. 
As a secondary point, income stocks have the potential for steady, long-term 
appreciation. So if you’re investing for retirement needs that won’t occur 
for another 20 years, maybe income stocks aren’t suitable for you — better 
to invest in growth stocks because they’re more likely to grow your money 
faster over your stated lengthy investment term. (I explain who’s best suited 
to income stocks earlier in this chapter.)
If you’re certain you want income stocks, do a rough calculation to figure 
out how big a portion of your portfolio you want income stocks to occupy. 
Suppose that you need $25,000 in investment income to satisfy your current 
financial needs. If you have bonds that give you $20,000 in interest income 
and you want the rest to come from dividends from income stocks, you need 
to choose stocks that pay you $5,000 in annual dividends. If you have $80,000 
left to invest, you need a portfolio of income stocks that yields 6.25 percent 
($5,000 divided by $80,000 equals a yield of 6.25 percent; I explain yield in 
more detail in the following section).

128
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
You may ask, “Why not just buy $80,000 of bonds [for instance] that yield 
at least 6.25 percent?” Well, if you’re satisfied with that $5,000 and inflation 
for the foreseeable future is zero, then you have a point. Unfortunately, infla-
tion will probably be with us for a long time. Fortunately, steady growth that 
income stocks provide is a benefit to you.
 
If you have income stocks and don’t have any immediate need for the divi-
dends, consider reinvesting the dividends in the company’s stock. For more 
details on this kind of reinvesting, see Chapter 19.
Every investor is different. If you’re not sure about your current or future 
needs, your best choice is to consult with a financial planner. Flip to 
Appendix A for helpful financial planning resources.
Checking out yield
 
Because income stocks pay out dividends — income — you need to assess 
which stocks can give you the highest income. How do you do that? The main 
thing to look for is yield, which is the percentage rate of return paid on a stock 
in the form of dividends. Looking at a stock’s dividend yield is the quickest 
way to find out how much money you’ll earn versus other dividend-paying 
stocks (or even other investments, such as a bank account). Table 9-1 illus-
trates this point. Dividend yield is calculated in the following way:
Dividend yield = Dividend income ÷ Stock investment
The next two sections use the information in Table 9-1 to compare the yields 
from different investments and to show how evaluating yield helps you 
choose the stock that earns you the most money.
Minding your dividends and interest
Dividends are sometimes confused with inter-
est. However, dividends are payouts to owners, 
while interest is a payment to a creditor. A stock 
investor is considered a part owner of the com-
pany he invests in and is entitled to dividends 
when they’re issued. A bank, on the other hand, 
considers you a creditor when you open an 
account. The bank borrows your money and 
pays you interest on it.

Don’t stop scrutinizing stocks after you acquire them. You may make a great 
choice that gives you a great dividend, but that doesn’t mean the stock stays 
that way indefinitely. Monitor the company’s progress for as long as it’s in 
your portfolio by using resources such as www.bloomberg.com and www.
marketwatch.com (see Appendix A for more resources).
Examining changes in yield
Most people have no problem understanding yield when it comes to bank 
accounts. If I tell you that my bank certificate of deposit (CD) has an annual 
yield of 3.5 percent, you can easily figure out that if I deposit $1,000 in that 
account, a year later I’ll have $1,035 (slightly more if you include compound-
ing). The CD’s market value in this example is the same as the deposit 
amount — $1,000. That makes it easy to calculate.
How about stocks? When you see a stock listed in the financial pages, the div-
idend yield is provided, along with the stock’s price and annual dividend. The 
dividend yield in the financial pages is always calculated as if you bought the 
stock on that given day. Just keep in mind that based on supply and demand, 
stock prices change every day (virtually every minute!) that the market’s 
open, so the yield changes daily as well. So keep the following two things in 
mind when examining yield:
 
✓ The yield listed in the financial pages may not represent the yield 
you’re receiving. What if you bought stock in Smith Co. (see Table 9-1) 
a month ago at $20 per share? With an annual dividend of $1, you know 
your yield is 5 percent. But what if today Smith Co. is selling for $40 per 
share? If you look in the financial pages, the yield quoted would be 2.5 
percent. Gasp! Did the dividend get cut in half?! No, not really. You’re 

130
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
still getting 5 percent because you bought the stock at $20 rather than 
the current $40 price; the quoted yield is for investors who purchase 
Smith Co. today. They pay $40 and get the $1 dividend, and they’re 
locked into the current yield of 2.5 percent. Although Smith Co. may 
have been a good income investment for you a month ago, it’s not 
such a hot pick today because the price of the stock doubled, cutting 
the yield in half. Even though the dividend hasn’t changed, the yield 
changed dramatically because of the stock price change.
 
✓ Stock price affects how good of an investment the stock may be. 
Another way to look at yield is by looking at the investment amount. 
Using Smith Co. in Table 9-1 as the example, the investor who bought, 
say, 100 shares of Smith Co. when they were $20 per share only paid 
$2,000 (100 shares times $20 — leave out commissions to make the 
example simple). If the same stock is purchased later at $40 per share, 
the total investment amount is $4,000 (100 shares times $40). In either 
case, the investor gets a total dividend income of $100 (100 shares times 
$1 dividend per share). Which investment is yielding more — the $2,000 
investment or the $4,000 investment? Of course, it’s better to get the 
income ($100 in this case) with the smaller investment (a 5 percent yield 
is better than a 2.5 percent yield).
Comparing yield between different stocks
All things being equal, choosing Smith Co. or Jones Co. is a coin toss. It’s 
looking at your situation and each company’s fundamentals and prospects 
that will sway you. What if Smith Co. is an auto stock (similar to General 
Motors in 2008) and Jones Co. is a utility serving the Las Vegas metro area? 
Now what? In 2008, the automotive industry struggled tremendously, but 
utilities were generally in much better shape. In that scenario, Smith Co.’s 
dividend is in jeopardy while Jones Co.’s dividend is more secure. Another 
issue is the payout ratio (see the next section). Therefore, companies whose 
dividends have the same yield may still have different risks.
Looking at a stock’s payout ratio
 
You can use the payout ratio to figure out what percentage of a company’s 
earnings is being paid out in the form of dividends (earnings equal sales minus 
expenses). Keep in mind that companies pay dividends from their net earn-
ings. Therefore, the company’s earnings should always be higher than the div-
idends the company pays out. Here’s how to figure a payout ratio:
Dividend (per share) ÷ Earnings (per share) = Payout ratio

131
 Chapter 9: Investing for Income
Say that the company CashFlow Now, Inc. (CFN), has annual earnings of $1 
million. Total dividends are to be paid out of $500,000, and the company has 
1 million outstanding shares. Using those numbers, you know that CFN’s 
earnings per share (EPS) is $1 ($1 million in earnings divided by 1 million 
shares) and that it pays an annual dividend of 50 cents per share ($500,000 
divided by 1 million shares). The dividend payout ratio is 50 percent (the 
50-cent dividend is 50 percent of the $1 EPS). This number is a healthy divi-
dend payout ratio because even if CFN’s earnings fall by 10 percent or 20 per-
cent, it still has plenty of room to pay dividends.
 
People concerned about their dividend income’s safety should regularly 
watch the payout ratio. The maximum acceptable payout ratio should be 
80 percent, and a good range is 50–70 percent. A payout ratio of 60 percent 
and lower is considered very safe (the lower the percentage, the safer the 
dividend).
 
When a company suffers significant financial difficulties, its ability to pay divi-
dends is compromised. (Good examples of stocks that have had their divi-
dends cut in recent years due to financial difficulties are mortgage companies 
in the wake of the housing bubble bursting and the fallout from the subprime 
debt fiasco. Mortgage companies received less and less income due to mort-
gage defaults, which forced the lowering of dividends as cash inflow shrunk.) 
So if you need dividend income to help you pay your bills, you better be aware 
of the dividend payout ratio.
Examining a company’s bond rating
Bond rating? Huh? What’s that got to do with dividend-paying stocks? 
Actually, a company’s bond rating is very important to income stock inves-
tors. The bond rating offers insight into the company’s financial strength. 
Bonds get rated for quality for the same reasons that consumer agencies rate 
products like cars or toasters. Standard & Poor’s (S&P) is the major indepen-
dent rating agency that looks into bond issuers. S&P looks at the bond issuer 
and asks, “Does this bond issuer have the financial strength to pay back the 
bond and the interest as stipulated in the bond indenture?”
To understand why this rating is important, consider the following:
 
✓ A good bond rating means that the company is strong enough to pay 
its obligations. These obligations include expenses, payments on debts, 
and declared dividends. If a bond rating agency gives the company a 
high rating (or if it raises the rating), that’s a great sign for anyone hold-
ing the company’s debt or receiving dividends.

132
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
 
✓ If a bond rating agency lowers the rating, that means the company’s 
financial strength is deteriorating — a red flag for anyone who owns the 
company’s bonds or stock. A lower bond rating today may mean trouble 
for the dividend later on.
 
✓ A poor bond rating means that the company is having difficulty paying 
its obligations. If the company can’t pay all its obligations, it has to 
choose which ones to pay. More times than not, a financially troubled 
company chooses to cut dividends or (in a worst case scenario) not pay 
dividends at all.
 
The highest rating issued by S&P is AAA. The grades AAA, AA, and A are con-
sidered investment grade, or of high quality. Bs and Cs indicate a poor grade, 
and anything lower than that is considered very risky (the bonds are referred 
to as junk bonds). So if you see a XXX rating, then . . . gee . . . you better stay 
away! (You may even get an infection.)
Diversifying your stocks
 
If most of your dividend income is from stock in a single company or single 
industry, consider reallocating your investment to avoid having all your eggs 
in one basket. Concerns about diversification apply to income stocks as well 
as growth stocks. If all your income stocks are in the electric utility industry, 
then any problems in that industry are potential problems for your portfolio 
as well. See Chapter 4 for more on diversification.
Exploring Some Typical Income Stocks
Although virtually every industry has stocks that pay dividends, some indus-
tries have more dividend-paying stocks than others. You won’t find too many 
dividend-paying income stocks in the computer or biotech industries, for 
instance. The reason is that these types of companies need a lot of money to 
finance expensive research and development (R&D) projects to create new 
products. Without R&D, the company can’t create new products to fuel sales, 
growth, and future earnings. Computer, biotech, and other innovative indus-
tries are better for growth investors. Keep reading for the scoop on stocks 
that work well for income investors.

133
 Chapter 9: Investing for Income
Utilities
Utilities generate a large cash flow. (If you don’t believe me, look at your gas 
and electric bills!) Cash flow includes money from income (sales of products 
and/or services) and other items (such as the selling of assets, for example). 
This cash flow is needed to cover expenses, loan payments, and dividends. 
Utilities are considered the most common type of income stocks, and many 
investors have at least one utility company in their portfolio. Investing in 
your own local utility isn’t a bad idea — at least it makes paying the utility 
bill less painful.
 
Before you invest in a public utility, consider the following:
 
✓ The utility company’s financial condition: Is the company making 
money, and are its sales and earnings growing from year to year? Make 
sure the utility’s bonds are rated A or higher (I cover bond ratings in the 
“Examining a company’s bond rating” section, earlier in this chapter).
 
✓ The company’s dividend payout ratio: Because utilities tend to have a 
good cash flow, don’t be too concerned if the ratio reaches 70 percent. 
From a safety point of view, however, the lower the rate, the better. See 
the “Looking at a stock’s payout ratio” section, earlier in this chapter, 
for more on payout ratios.
 
✓ The company’s geographic location: If the utility covers an area 
that’s doing well and offers an increasing population base and busi-
ness expansion, that bodes well for your stock. A good resource for 
researching population and business data is the U.S. Census Bureau 
(www.census.gov).
Real estate investment trusts (REITs)
Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are a special breed of stock. A REIT is 
an investment that has elements of both a stock and a mutual fund (a pool of 
money received from investors that’s managed by an investment company).
 
✓ A REIT resembles a stock in that it’s a company whose stock is publicly 
traded on the major stock exchanges, and it has the usual features that 
you expect from a stock — it can be bought and sold easily through a 
broker, income is given to investors as dividends, and so on.

134
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
 
✓ A REIT resembles a mutual fund in that it doesn’t make its money selling 
goods and services; it makes its money by buying, selling, and managing 
an investment portfolio of real estate investments. It generates revenue 
from rents and property leases, as any landlord does. In addition, some 
REITs own mortgages, and they gain income from the interest.
 
REITs are called trusts only because they meet the requirements of the Real 
Estate Investment Trust Act of 1960. This act exempts REITs from corporate 
income tax and capital gains taxes as long as they meet certain criteria, such 
as dispensing 95 percent of their net income to shareholders. This provision is 
the reason why REITs generally issue generous dividends. Beyond this status, 
REITs are, in a practical sense, like any other publicly traded company.
The main advantages to investing in REITs include the following:
 
✓ Unlike other types of real estate investing, REITs are easy to buy and 
sell. You can buy a REIT by making a phone call to a broker or visiting a 
broker’s Web site, just as you can to purchase any stock.
 
✓ REITs have higher-than-average yields. Because they must distribute at 
least 95 percent of their income to shareholders, their dividends usually 
yield a return of 5 to 12 percent.
 
✓ REITs involve a lower risk than the direct purchase of real estate 
because they use a portfolio approach diversified among many proper-
ties. Because you’re investing in a company that buys the real estate, 
you don’t have to worry about managing the properties — the com-
pany’s management does that on a full-time basis. Usually, the REIT 
doesn’t just manage one property; it’s diversified in a portfolio of differ-
ent properties.
 
✓ Investing in a REIT is affordable for small investors. REIT shares usually 
trade in the $10 to $40 range, meaning that you can invest with very little 
money.
 
REITs do have disadvantages. Although they tend to be diversified with vari-
ous properties, they’re still susceptible to risks tied to the general real estate 
sector. Real estate investing reached manic, record-high levels during 2000–
2007, which meant that a downturn was likely. Whenever you invest in an 
asset (like real estate or REITs in recent years) that has already skyrocketed 
due to artificial stimulants (in the case of real estate, very low interest rates 
and too much credit and debt), the potential losses can offset any potential 
(unrealized) income.

135
 Chapter 9: Investing for Income
 
When you’re looking for a REIT to invest in, analyze it the way you’d analyze a 
property. Look at the location and type of property. If shopping malls are 
booming in California and your REIT buys and sells shopping malls in 
California, then hopefully you’ll do well. However, if your REIT invests in office 
buildings across the country and the office building market is overbuilt and 
having tough times, you’ll have a tough time, too. In 2009 and for the next few 
years, it will pay for investors to be extra selective regarding REIT investments 
because the difficulties in the real estate industry aren’t over yet.
Royalty trusts
In recent years, the oil and gas sector has generated much interest as people 
and businesses experience much higher energy prices. Due to a variety of 
bullish factors, such as increased international demand from China and other 
emerging industrialized nations, oil and gas prices have zoomed to record 
highs. Some income investors have capitalized on this price increase by 
investing in energy stocks called royalty trusts.
Royalty trusts are companies that hold assets such as oil-rich and/or gas-rich 
land and generate high fees from companies that seek access to these prop-
erties for exploration. The fees paid to the royalty trusts are then disbursed 
as high dividends to their shareholders. By the first half of 2008, dividend-
rich royalty trusts sported yields in the 9 to 15 percent range, which is very 
enticing given how low the yields have been in this decade for other invest-
ments like bank accounts and bonds. You can research royalty trusts in gen-
erally the same venues as regular stocks (see Appendix A).
 
Although energy has been a hot field in recent years and royalty trusts have 
done well, keep in mind that their payout ratios are very high (often in the 90 
to 100 percent range), so dividends will suffer should their cash flow shrink.

Getting a Grip on Economics
In This Chapter
▶ Distinguishing between microeconomics and macroeconomics
▶ Boning up on key economic concepts
▶ Exploring the major schools of economic thought
▶ Keeping an eye on a couple of current economic issues
“S
tock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau,” 
said the celebrated economist Irving Fisher on October 17, 1929, 
shortly before history’s most famous single-day stock market plunge. Nobody 
should have listened to Irving Fisher — not even Irving Fisher. He lost a ton of 
money in the stock market and filed for bankruptcy at the start of the Great 
Depression. Sooooo . . . if you don’t think understanding economics is impor-
tant to your stock investing strategy, then by gum you’d be as wrong as Irving.
This chapter isn’t full of economic gobbledygook; I won’t beat you over 
the head with phrases like “inelastic demand aggregates” and “marginal 
statistical utility” (whatever that means). (You’re breathing a sigh of relief, 
aren’t you?) Presented properly, economics really is quite interesting. 
Understanding economics helps you make better decisions involving your 
investment choices. All of my successful stock picks were first grounded in 
common sense economics. Economics also helped me avoid bad choices; 
Internet stocks in the late 1990s and mortgage and financial stocks during 
2006–2008 didn’t make economic sense, and ultimately shareholders lost 
most (or all) of their money as stock prices sank into oblivion. Always ask 
yourself: “Does this stock pick make economic sense?” I find economics fasci-
nating, and I hope you find this chapter beneficial and, uh, tolerable.
 
Don’t repeat the mistakes of the past! Be an informed stock investor. Here are 
some sources to help you understand economics more fully:

Breaking Down Microeconomics 
versus Macroeconomics
You can divide the field of economics into two categories: microeconomics 
and macroeconomics. For stock investors,
 
✓ Microeconomics is looking at the economic small picture, such as the 
fundamentals of a company.
 
✓ Macroeconomics is looking at the economic big picture, such as the 
health of the general economy.
Microeconomics
It may not always dawn on you that economics isn’t about alien, arcane data 
and statistics. Economics is the rudimentary stuff of financial life such as 
sales, expenses, profit, debt, and so on. Your own household is the first and 
best example of microeconomics in action. If the money coming in is greater 
than the money going out, that’s certainly good. If you have lots of debt (lia-
bilities) and very little in the way of things you own (assets), then your net 
worth is negative (dead meat!) and the microeconomics of your household 
aren’t good at all.
 
Much of this book covers microeconomics in terms of choosing your stock. 
After all, if you’re going to put your hard-earned money in a stock, you have to 
familiarize yourself with the company represented by that stock. Is the com-
pany in good economic shape? You find out by checking the company’s micro-
economic indicators, such as its income statement (or the P&L), balance 
sheet, and cash flow. You find more information about these indicators in 
Chapter 11.

139
 Chapter 10: Getting a Grip on Economics
Macroeconomics
If you’re only familiar with the microeconomic and don’t notice the big pic-
ture, you could see your portfolio crumble. Macroeconomics is an important 
part of your investment decision-making process because stocks aren’t 
chosen in a vacuum. Even the best stocks in the world will go down if the 
economy is experiencing major problems. This is especially true for stocks of 
companies that offer products and services.
One of the most helpful macroeconomic indicators is the index of Leading 
Economic Indicators (LEI), which is an economic gauge that covers a broad 
array of statistics intended to estimate future economic activity. It’s calcu-
lated by the Conference Board (www.conference-board.org), and it’s a 
useful gauge for investors because it gives you an idea of how the economy is 
progressing.
 
A flaw with the analysis of the investing pundits on financial TV shows is that 
although they’re usually very good at microeconomics, because of certain fac-
tors (a lack of education, bias, and so on), they aren’t proficient at macroeco-
nomics. They may tell you about a great stock in sector X, but they’re missing 
what will hit that sector (and that stock) because of factors elsewhere in the 
economy. A good example is homebuilding stocks. In 2006, I watched as a 
financial advisor extolled the virtues of a particular homebuilding company 
(“Great financials, great profit margin — this stock is a definite buy!”). 
However, the housing sector was about to be slammed by a huge wave of 
defaults and foreclosures because of mortgage problems and a slowing gen-
eral economy. In the following months, that stock plummeted by 60 percent 
even though its microeconomic picture looked nice.
Understanding Important Concepts 
in Economic Logic
To keep yourself grounded with the right data and logic for your stock invest-
ing decisions, I discuss a few points that you ought to be familiar with in the 
following sections.

140
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
Supply and demand
Doing a chapter on economics without mentioning supply and demand is 
like doing a chapter on graceful aging without mentioning Pat Boone and 
Dick Clark. Supply and demand are the quintessential duo in the economic 
universe, and the more you understand how they work, the more successful 
your investment decisions will be.
 
Here are definitions for these two concepts (from my perspective, of course):
 
✓ Supply. What’s being offered or produced? How much is there? How 
desirable or necessary is it? Are there substitutes? How limited or plenti-
ful is the supply in question? What factors affect supply, and do those 
factors affect it directly or indirectly?
 
✓ Demand. This refers to the market that will ultimately buy what’s 
offered. Who are they? How many are they? Are they willing and able to 
buy? Are they individuals, small organizations, or large organizations? 
Do they merely want what’s offered, or do they need it? What factors 
affect demand, and do those factors affect it directly or indirectly?
We count on supply and demand to tell us how well a product or service will 
sell. This in turn tells us if the company providing the supply (again, product 
or service) has enough customers (demand) to be profitable and successful.
How do supply and demand relate to your investing decisions? Here’s a 
simple example: A company sells medical equipment that’s necessary for an 
aging population, and the aging population is a growing segment of society. 
Therefore, demand is strong and probably growing, so the stock of the com-
pany providing supply (the medical equipment) is probably a good bet.
 
Sometimes the laws of supply and demand can be overcome or temporarily 
suspended in the short term by something powerful such as government 
action (a good example is price controls, which I cover in Chapter 15). 
However, in the long term, supply and demand trump all.
Wants and needs
One of my favorite definitions of economics is a very pithy one: “Economics 
is humanity dealing with scarcity.” After all, to “economize” is to use 
resources wisely and to make choices about what to do with time, effort, and 
money. As humans, we know that we must use our resources (such as time, 
effort, and money) to voluntarily exchange with others to acquire goods and 
services that meet our wants and needs (or both).

141
 Chapter 10: Getting a Grip on Economics
When times are good and we’re doing well financially, we’re not that con-
cerned about our needs, and we have a greater ability to address our wants, 
such as a new car or a better vacation. When times are good, we have an 
easier time with stock investing; many stocks tend to do well when times are 
good because more money flows toward both wants and needs.
But what if times are bad (or simply not as good)? When economic times are 
tough or uncertain, common sense kicks in for stock investors. Demand for 
products and services that people merely want but don’t need is weak or neg-
ative. However, demand for those things that are needed in our lives (such as 
food or energy) are a safer choice for stock investors.
 
As I write this, times are difficult, and the data tells me that 2009 and beyond 
will be economically hazardous and difficult for our economy. Therefore, 
investors would be prudent to stick to investment choices tied to human 
needs.
Dynamic analysis versus static analysis
Economics isn’t about dry statistics; it’s about human behavior with incen-
tives and disincentives. In other words, when it comes to economics, people 
behave in a way that usually suits their self-interest. For example, say you’re 
driving down the highway and you notice two gas stations. Gas station A has 
gasoline at $3.00 per gallon while gas station B has the same gas at $2.80. 
Which one is more profitable? All things being equal, gas station B (the one 
with the lower price) will make more money.
Dynamic analysis takes human behavior into account, such as in that exam-
ple. However, someone using static analysis would conclude that gas station 
A would be more profitable by assuming that it would make an extra 20 cents 
per gallon. If the world were a static place and if people were automatons, 
then the latter situation could possibly prove correct. But look . . . we’re 
human! Everyone loves a bargain. Gas A is more expensive, so more people 
will buy gas B, resulting in higher profits for the lower-priced station.
Dynamic analysis takes into account how people or organizations act differ-
ently given incentives (such as discounts) or disincentives (such as sales 
taxes), while static analysis doesn’t.
 
We’re all faced with choices about what to do with our money. I’m certain that 
you’d find the same product cheaper at a big box store than at a haughty bou-
tique in Beverly Hills. Yet which one would make greater overall profits? Ask 
yourself how people would behave with the choices they face in the market-
place. Those companies that deliver with greater efficiency and value are a 
good bet for stock investing.

142
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
Cause and effect
Cause and effect is an exercise in logic that stock investors should embrace. 
If something is a growing problem (or a growing opportunity), what is its pos-
sible cause? And, in turn, what effect will it have? The credit crisis of 2008 is a 
great example of this. When banks were overburdened with debt and much of 
that debt was discovered to be low-quality (risky) debt, this situation caused 
several effects, among them major losses and potential bankruptcies. Wary 
investors see that too much debt in an uncertain economy can certainly 
cause some undesired effects. Individual companies suffer and their stock 
price goes down, which, of course, has a negative effect on your portfolio.
Surveying a Few Schools 
of Economic Thought
Adhering to a particular economic philosophy can make you or break you 
as a stock investor. Be sure to discover which ones have withstood the test 
of time and which ones are the kiss of economic death. In the following sec-
tions, I introduce a few major schools found in the world today.
 
Even if you aren’t proficient in understanding different schools of thought, be 
sure to find out the school of thought of the financial planners you work with 
and the resources you use. By knowing a planner’s school of thought, you can 
understand his general outlook and see whether it’s a fit with your outlook. If 
a financial planner isn’t aware of the schools of thought or answers 
“Keynesian,” that indicates to me that he doesn’t fully understand how gov-
ernment policy and economics affect the stock-picking process.
The Marx school
Frankly, the Marx school of economic thought (named after Karl Marx) makes 
me shudder. I was born in a communist country (Yugoslavia then, Croatia 
now, who knows what it will be tomorrow). I joke in my seminars that being 
born in a communist country is what made me a raving capitalist. In a com-
munist country, the government runs everything. When the government 
runs everything, economic activity is controlled by a centralized, pervasive 
bureaucracy. And history has shown that such economies eventually col-
lapse. Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union are examples of this.

143
 Chapter 10: Getting a Grip on Economics
Part of the reason that centralized planning doesn’t work is that no single 
bureaucrat or committee of bureaucrats has the ability to see and meet the 
complex and constantly changing wants and needs of millions of diverse indi-
viduals. Centralized planning of an economy eventually leads to misallocation 
of resources, and that has always led to intractable economic problems. I can 
write volumes on the subject because my family has experienced it, and I’ve 
studied the topic for over 30 years. But a full treatment is beyond the scope 
and purpose of this book.
 
How does this relate to stocks? Marxist/socialist/communist economic 
thought is, at its core, antithetical to a healthy free market economy, which is 
necessary for stock investing. Stock investing requires a free market, one in 
which the functions of business (such as profit) can operate with minimal 
interference. Businesses must be allowed to be formed, and they must bear 
the burden of risk and reward. Poorly run businesses fail, while well-run com-
panies are rewarded with profit (good for stockholders).
Although profit sometimes gets bad press, it is in fact the most necessary 
element of a successful economy. In other chapters of this book, you find 
out that profit is necessary for companies, but notice that I’ve extended that 
thought to the overall economy. Think about it for a moment. Profit is vital 
for economic growth. Profit is what makes an economy expand. Profit is an 
economic incentive missing from communist economies (and sorely missing 
from socialist ones). Profit is (and should be) a reward for innovation, risk, 
and the proper allocation of resources.
History has shown us conclusively that every country that has adopted a 
totalitarian, command-and-control economic model (communism, fascism, 
and so on) has ended in economic decline and abject failure. The bottom line 
is that Groucho Marx knows more about economics than Karl. Nuff said.
The Keynes school
The economic philosophy of John Maynard Keynes (a British economist in 
the early 20th century) has been the dominant school of thought in American 
politics and governmental economic policy matters for over a half-century. 
What a shame! What many don’t realize is that, after decades of this policy 
being implemented, the long-term effect of Keynesian economics is now 
becoming evident.
Keynesian economics is an economic theory with the central idea that active 
government intervention in the marketplace and in monetary policy (manag-
ing the country’s currency) is the best method of ensuring economic growth 

144
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
and stability. Believers in Keynesian economics think that it’s the govern-
ment’s job to smooth out the ebbs and flows in the business cycle. In bad 
times, intervention takes the form of increased spending by the government 
and tax cuts to stimulate the economy. In good times, the government inter-
venes by a reduction in spending and increases in taxes to curb potential 
inflation.
The problem is that the government intervention at the heart of Keynesian 
economics is now finally seen as the great flaw. The intervention actually 
causes the recessions, depressions, and artificial booms that it was originally 
supposed to remedy. As government continues to spend and allows total 
government debt to keep rising, the situation must eventually be addressed. 
When flaws in his theory were pointed out and shown to be a huge problem 
in the long run, Keynes was famously quoted as saying, “In the long run, we 
will all be dead.” Well, he certainly is dead, but his ideas live on and continue 
to wreak havoc on our economy today. Government intervention, massive 
bailouts, economic dislocation, and rising inflation are being dealt with right 
now. (Another quote attributed to Keynes was, “It is better to be roughly 
right than precisely wrong.” Looks like he has been precisely wrong and it 
sure has been rough!)
 
What does Keynesian economics have to do with the stock market? This is 
the ideology that ends up causing artificial booms (“asset bubbles”) and the 
resulting decline. Keynesian thinking is what drove the government (through 
the Federal Reserve) to increase liquidity (that is, increase the money supply 
and expand credit), which resulted in the bubbles that our society has wit-
nessed in recent years. In the early stages of a bubble, everyone’s happy as 
the value of their assets (such as stocks or real estate) rises and provides 
the illusion that has come to be known as “the wealth effect.” People felt 
wealthy in the late 1990s when the stock market (especially Internet and tech 
stocks) went up dramatically. However, because bubbles are created by arti-
ficial means (the injection of credit), prices are bid up to unnatural levels 
and must ultimately come down. The stock market bubble popped in 2000, 
and millions of people lost trillions of dollars. Then the housing bubble 
inflated (again, by artificial stimulus via credit expansion by the Fed), and 
this has in recent years caused massive pain as record levels of defaults and 
foreclosures took place.
As I write this, the latest bubble in credit and derivatives has started to 
deflate and wreak havoc on the stock market (especially financial stocks 
like banks and brokerage firms). Bubbles have become the visible legacy 
of the rampant credit and money expansion which resulted from applying 
Keynesian economics. (By the way, most politicians are Keynesians. Ha! Need 
I say more?)

145
 Chapter 10: Getting a Grip on Economics
The Austrian school
In my humble opinion, the most useful school of economic thought for inves-
tors (anyone, actually) is the Austrian school. After 100 years of experience, 
the Austrian school has been proven consistently right.
The leading voice of this school was Ludwig von Mises, an Austrian econo-
mist in the early 20th century (now you know where the name of the school 
comes from!). He accurately forecast the Great Depression, the collapse of 
the Soviet Union, and other economic events.
The Austrian school emphasizes free markets, limited government, private 
property rights, and a sound currency tied to the gold standard. This last 
point is important given what can happen when a government issues cur-
rency without limit — how this leads to currency debasement and, ulti-
mately, collapse. In addition, the Austrian school provides research on how 
asset bubbles (such as the recent stock and housing market bubbles) form 
and the problems that can ensue when these bubbles cause booms and the 
inevitable bust.
How does this help you with stocks? In 1999, I recall reading an article about 
asset bubbles on www.mises.org, the site that showcases the work of 
Mises and other Austrian economists (such as Murray Rothbard and Henry 
Hazlitt). That article explained how the stock market was a bubble and why. 
Armed with this knowledge, I informed students and clients about ways to 
protect against the stock market bubble. That forewarning saved many of 
my clients and students from the bear market of 2000–2002, and it was a 
concrete lesson in understanding (and applying) sound economic principles. 
Are you taking notes?
Understanding Some Current Economic 
Issues That Face Stock Investors
As I told you earlier in this chapter, I won’t provide an all-encompassing, 
extensive, voluminous coverage of economics, but I am committed to your 
investment success. The following are a few economic issues that you must 
be aware of in the coming months and years if you’re intent on successful 
stock investing.

146
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
Inflation
Inflation is an issue that could easily be lumped into the chapter on politics 
(Chapter 15, so you know) because it’s as much a governmental phenomenon 
as it is an economic one. In modern economies, you and I use currencies 
(such as the dollar) to transact in our day-to-day lives. It’s our medium of 
exchange; we use currencies to trade with so that we can obtain goods and 
services. The issuance of currency is a government matter; the central bank 
(in the U.S. it’s the Federal Reserve) issues the currency and manages its 
quantity (the money supply). When you hear the term “monetary policy,” 
that’s just the official way of saying that the Federal Reserve manages our 
official supply of money — the dollar as our national currency.
Since 2001, the Federal Reserve has been increasing the money supply at a 
double-digit rate. In recent years, much of this came in the form of credit that 
went into assets (such as stocks and real estate), but much of it has been 
(and is) going into the price of goods and services. This means that the result 
has been (and will be) high and higher prices.
 
Inflation is effectively a hidden tax which hurts most consumers, especially 
those on fixed incomes. Stock investors should be aware of inflation and 
invest in ways that will benefit them. This is part of the reason why I repeat-
edly tell folks to invest in human need. As these prices go up, you need to be 
in the stocks of companies that will either benefit from inflation or (at the very 
least) not be hurt by it. Examples of human need include food, water, energy, 
and so on. Consider stocks in these necessary areas.
Government intervention
Stock investing was actually an easy pursuit in the 1980s and the early 1990s. 
The market was generally unfettered, and economic logic was easy to apply. 
However, a major sea change has occurred during the past 10–15 years that 
has made stock investing more precarious, unpredictable, and hazardous. 
That sea change was driven by government intervention, which is akin to 
betting on a basketball game but finding out that the referees are interfering 
in the game. Government intervention comes in a variety of flavors, and it’s 
usually an outgrowth of political considerations, so spend some in Chapter 
15, where I discuss the relationship between politics and stock investing in 
more detail.

147
 Chapter 10: Getting a Grip on Economics
9,000,000 percent inflation!
In a seminar in 2008, I asked my students to 
name the top-performing stock market in 
the world last year (from a nominal point of 
view). They blurted out “China,” “Brazil,” and 
other guesses, but they weren’t even close. 
“Zimbabwe,” I said to the puzzled class. That’s 
right, a fairly obscure country in central Africa. 
Its stock market was up an astonishing 12,000 
percent. Whew! Yet, the country is mired in 
poverty under an oppressive regime. How can 
that be? When socialist dictator Robert Mugabe 
took control of the country, he put in strict con-
trols on the economy. Among those controls: 
Citizens couldn’t have foreign accounts, couldn’t 
buy gold or other alternative forms of money, 
and could only use the official currency, the 
Zimbabwean dollar. He then began to hyper-
inflate the currency to initially benefit himself 
and his allies. After years of abuse, the inflation 
rate hit horrific levels. On paper, Zimbabwe 
had more multimillionaires per capita than any 
other nation even though most of the popu-
lace was destitute. By the summer of 2008, 
the inflation rate surpassed 9 million percent, 
as 40 billion Zimbabwean dollars equaled one 
U.S. dollar. Recently, the country’s economic 
minister told the United Nations that the infla-
tion rate was beyond calculation. Zimbabwe’s 
fate regarding this extreme condition is yet to 
be clear. Stay tuned!

N
ow that you have the basics down, it’s time to 
become a pro at picking individual stocks. When 
you consider investing in a company, you need to gain 
insight into what makes a particular stock’s price rise. 
And because the stock market doesn’t operate in a vac-
uum, I introduce political and governmental factors that 
can have a huge effect on the stock market. The chapters 
in this part steer you to key financial information and 
important company documents and show you how to 
interpret the information you find.

uccessful stock picking sometimes seems like plucking a rabbit out of a 
hat or watching the Amazing Kreskin do some Houdini trick. In other 
words, it seems like you need sleight of hand to choose a stock. Perhaps 
stock picking is more art than science. The other guy seems to always pick 
winners while you’re stuck with losers. What does it take — a crystal ball or 
some system from a get-rich-quick-with-stocks book?
Well, with the book in your hands now and a little work on your part, I think 
you’ll succeed. This chapter takes the mystery out of the numbers behind the 
stock. The most tried-and-true method for picking a good stock starts with 
picking a good company. Picking the company means looking at its products, 
services, industry, and financial strength (the numbers). Considering the 
problems that the market has witnessed in recent years — such as subprime 
debt problems and derivative meltdowns wreaking havoc on public compa-
nies and financial firms — this chapter is more important than ever. 
Understanding the basics behind the numbers can save your portfolio.
Recognizing Value When You See It
If you pick a stock based on the value of the company that issues it, you’re a 
value investor — an investor who looks at a company’s value and judges 
whether he can purchase the stock at a good price. Companies have value 
the same way many things have value, such as eggs or elephant-foot umbrella 
stands. And there’s such a thing as a fair price to buy them at, too. Take eggs, 

152
Part III: Picking Winners 
for example. You can eat them and have a tasty treat while getting nutrition 
as well. But would you buy an egg for $1,000 (and no, you’re not a starving 
millionaire on a deserted island)? Of course not. But what if you could buy 
an egg for 5 cents? At that point, it has value and a good price. This kind of 
deal is a value investor’s dream.
Value investors analyze a company’s fundamentals (earnings, assets, and so 
on) and see whether the information justifies purchasing the stock. They 
see whether the stock price is low relative to these verifiable, quantifiable 
factors. Therefore, value investors use fundamental analysis, while other 
investors may use technical analysis. Technical analysis looks at stock charts 
and statistical data, such as trading volume and historical stock prices (I take 
a closer look at technical analysis in Chapter 16). Some investors use a 
combination of both strategies.
 
History has shown that the most successful long-term investors have typically 
been value investors using fundamental analysis as their primary investing 
approach. The most consistently successful long-term investors were and are 
predominately value investors (yes, I count myself in this crowd as well).
In the following sections, I describe different kinds of value and explain how 
to spot a company’s value in several places.
Understanding different types of value
“Value” may seem like a murky or subjective term, but it’s the essence of 
good stock picking. You can measure value in different ways, so you need 
to know the differences and understand the impact that value has on your 
investment decisions.
Market value
When you hear someone quoting a stock at $47 per share, that price reflects 
the stock’s market value. The total market valuation of a company’s stock 
is also referred to as its market cap or market capitalization. How do you 
determine a company’s market cap? With the following simple formula:
Market capitalization = Share price × Number of shares outstanding
If Bolshevik Corp.’s stock is $35 per share and it has 10 million shares out-
standing (or shares available for purchase), its market cap is $350 million. 
Granted, $350 million may sound like a lot of money, but Bolshevik Corp. is 
considered a small cap stock. (For more information about small cap stocks, 
dip into Chapter 8.)

153
 Chapter 11: Using Basic Accounting to Choose Winning Stocks
Who sets the market value of stock? The market, of course! Millions of inves-
tors buying and selling directly and through intermediaries such as mutual 
funds determine the market value of any particular stock. If the market 
perceives that the company is desirable, investor demand for the company’s 
stock pushes up the share price.
 
The problem with market valuation is that it’s not always a good indicator of a 
good investment. In recent years, plenty of companies have had astronomical 
market values, yet they proved to be very risky investments. For example, 
think about Bear Stearns. During 2007, it hit a stock price of $170; its market 
cap was measured in billions. Yet its stock price plunged to only $2 per share 
in the spring of 2008. Yikes! Because market value is a direct result of the 
buying and selling of stock investors, it can be a fleeting thing. This is why 
investors must understand the company behind the stock price.
Book value
Book value (also referred to as accounting value) looks at a company from a 
balance sheet perspective (assets minus liabilities equal net worth, or stock-
holders’ equity). It’s a way of judging a firm by its net worth to see whether 
the stock’s market value is reasonable compared to the company’s intrinsic 
value. Intrinsic value is value tied to what the market price would be of a 
company’s assets, both tangible (such as equipment) and intangible (such as 
patents), if they were sold.
Generally, market value tends to be higher than book value. If market value 
is substantially higher than book value, the value investor becomes more 
reluctant to buy that particular stock because it’s overvalued. The closer the 
stock’s market capitalization is to the book value, the safer the investment.
 
I like to be cautious with a stock whose market value is more than twice its 
book value. If the market value is $1 billion or more and the book value is $500 
million or less, that’s a good indicator that the business may be overvalued, 
or valued at a higher price than its book value and ability to generate a profit. 
Just understand that the farther the market value is from the company’s 
book value, the more you’ll pay for the company’s real potential value. And 
the more you pay for the company’s real value, the greater the risk that the 
company’s market value can decrease (the stock price, that is).
Sales and earnings value
A company’s intrinsic value is directly tied to its ability to make money. In 
that case, many analysts like to value stocks from the perspective of the com-
pany’s income statement. Two common barometers of value are expressed in 
ratios: the price to sales ratio (PSR) and the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). In 
both instances, the price is a reference to the company’s market value (as 
reflected in its share price). Sales and earnings are references to the firm’s 
ability to make money. These two ratios are covered more fully in the section 
“Tooling around with ratios,” later in this chapter.

154
Part III: Picking Winners 
 
For investors, the general approach is clear. The closer the market value is to 
the company’s intrinsic value, the better. And, of course, if the market value is 
lower than the company’s intrinsic value, you have a potential bargain worthy 
of a closer look. Part of looking closer means examining the company’s income 
statement, also called the profit and loss statement, or simply, the P&L. A low 
price to sales ratio is 1, a medium PSR is between 1 and 2, and a high PSR is 3 
or higher.
Putting the pieces together
When you look at a company from a value-oriented perspective, here are 
some of the most important items to consider (see the later section 
“Accounting for Value” for more information):
 
✓ The balance sheet, to figure out the company’s net worth: A value 
investor doesn’t buy a company’s stock because it’s cheap; she buys 
it because it’s undervalued (the company is worth more than the 
price its stock reflects — its market value is as close as possible to 
its book value).
 
✓ The income statement, to figure out the company’s profitability: A 
company may be undervalued from a simple comparison of the book 
value and the market value, but that doesn’t mean it’s a screaming buy. 
For example, what if you find out that a company is in trouble and losing 
money this year? Do you buy its stock then? No, you don’t. Why invest 
in the stock of a losing company? (If you do, you aren’t investing — 
you’re gambling or speculating.) The heart of a firm’s value, besides its 
net worth, is its ability to generate profit.
 
✓ Ratios that let you analyze just how well (or not so well) the company 
is doing: Value investors basically look for a bargain. That being the 
case, they generally don’t look at companies that everyone is talking 
about, because by that point, the stock of those companies ceases to be 
a bargain. The value investor searches for a stock that will eventually 
be discovered by the market and then watches as the stock price goes 
up. But before you bother digging into the fundamentals to find that 
bargain stock, first make sure that the company is making money.
 
Value investors can find thousands of companies that have value, but they 
can probably buy only a handful at a truly good price. The number of stocks 
that can be bought at a good price is relative to the market. In mature bull 
markets (markets in a prolonged period of rising prices), a good price is hard 
to find because most stocks have probably seen significant price increases, 
but in bear markets (markets in a prolonged period of falling prices), good 
companies at bargain prices are easier to come by.

155
 Chapter 11: Using Basic Accounting to Choose Winning Stocks
The more ways that you can look at a company and see value, the better. The 
first thing I look at is the P/E ratio. Does the company have one? (It sounds 
dumb, but if it’s losing money, it may not have one.) Does the P/E ratio look 
reasonable, or is it in triple-digit, nose-bleed territory? Is it reasonable or 
too high?
Next, look at the company’s debt load (the total amount of liabilities). Is it 
less than the company’s equity? Are sales healthy and increasing from the 
prior year? Does the firm compare favorably in these categories versus other 
companies in the same industry?
 
Simplicity to me is best. You’ll notice that the number 10 comes up frequently 
as I measure a company’s performance, juxtaposing all the numbers that 
you need to be aware of. If net income is rising by 10 percent or more, that’s 
fine. If the company is in the top 10 percent of its industry, that’s great. If the 
industry is growing by 10 percent or better (sales and so on), that’s terrific. If 
sales are up 10 percent or more from the prior year, that’s wonderful. A great 
company doesn’t have to have all these things going for it, but it should have 
as many of these things happening as possible to ensure greater potential 
success.
Does every company/industry have to neatly fit these criteria? No, of course 
not. But it doesn’t hurt you to be as picky as possible. You need to find only a 
handful of stocks from thousands of choices. (Hey, this approach has worked 
for me, my clients, and my students for nearly 21/2 decades — ’nuff said.)
Accounting for Value
Profit is to a company what oxygen is to you and me. That’s neither good nor 
bad; it just is. Without profit, a company can’t survive, much less thrive. 
Without profit, it can’t provide jobs, pay taxes, and invest in new products, 
equipment, or innovation. Without profit, the company eventually goes bank-
rupt, and the value of its stock evaporates.
In the heady days leading up to the bear market of 2000–2002, many investors 
lost a lot of money simply because they invested in stocks of companies that 
weren’t making a profit. Lots of public companies ended up like bugs that 
just didn’t see the windshield coming their way. Companies such as Enron, 
WorldCom, and Global Crossing entered the graveyard of rather-be-forgotten 
stocks. Stock investors as a group lost trillions of dollars investing in glitzy 
companies that sounded good but weren’t making money. When their 
brokers were saying, “buy, buy, buy,” their hard-earned money was saying, 
“bye, bye, bye!” What were they thinking?

156
Part III: Picking Winners 
Stock investors need to pick up some rudimentary knowledge of accounting 
to round out their stock-picking prowess and to be sure that they’re getting a 
good value for their investment dollars. Accounting is the language of busi-
ness. If you don’t understand basic accounting, then you’ll have difficulty 
being a successful investor. Investing without accounting knowledge is like 
traveling without a map. However, if you can run a household budget, using 
accounting analysis to evaluate stocks is easier than you think.
 
Finding the relevant financial data on a company isn’t difficult in the age of 
information. Web sites such as www.nasdaq.com can give you the most 
recent balance sheets and income statements of most public companies. You 
can find out more about public information and research on companies in 
Chapter 6.
Breaking down the balance sheet
A company’s balance sheet gives you a financial snapshot of what the 
company looks like in terms of the following equation:
Crash-test dummy candidate?
From 2001–2003, consumers were buying up 
SUVs . . . uh . . . ASAP. Demand was very high 
for those popular gas-guzzling vehicles, and 
auto giant General Motors (GM) was racking up 
record sales. Investors noticed GM’s success, 
and its stock surpassed $76 in 2001. However, 
the numbers (and the times) were catching up 
with GM. Their zero-interest financing program 
started to sputter. Debts and human resource 
liabilities (such as employee health and retire-
ment commitments) started accelerating. 
Energy costs rose, making SUVs less attractive. 
The red flags came out. GM’s 2004 year-end 
balance sheet showed debt of over $451 billion, 
while total shareholder equity was only $27.7 
billion. GM’s net income fell to just 1 percent of 
net sales, and its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 
ballooned to a lofty 39. The stock price hit $25 by 
April 2005. Although the price rebounded to the 
mid-$30s by July 2005, investors had skid marks 
on their portfolio as the stock lost nearly two-
thirds of its value during that time frame. By 
September 2005, GM reported a net loss (good-
bye P/E ratio). In my reckoning, GM is no longer 
an investment; it’s now a speculation. At this 
rate, it may go from SUV to DOA ASAP.
As a contrasting point, look at Exxon Mobil 
(XOM) during that same time frame. Its stock 
price went from about $35 in early 2001 to $60 in 
July 2005 (it had a 2-for-1 stock split in mid-2001). 
XOM’s net income was a healthy 8 percent of 
sales, and the P/E ratio was only 14. In its 2004 
year-end balance sheet, total shareholder 
equity of $101.7 billion comfortably exceeded its 
total liabilities of $89.5 billion. A sound company 
with sound numbers. (Ya hear me?)
The point here is that the stock price ultimately 
reflects the financial health and vitality of the 
company, and you can easily find and evaluate 
that information. You don’t need luck or a crys-
tal ball. Again, just a little work in the form of 
fundamental analysis is sufficient.

157
 Chapter 11: Using Basic Accounting to Choose Winning Stocks
Assets – liabilities = Net worth (or net equity)
In the following sections, I list the questions that a balance sheet can 
answer and explain how to judge a company’s strength over time from a 
balance sheet.
Answering a few balance sheet questions
 
Analyze the following items that you find on the balance sheet:
 
✓ Total Assets: Have they increased from the prior year? If not, was it 
because of the sale of an asset or a write-off (uncollectable accounts 
receivable, for example)?
 
✓ Financial Assets: In recent years, many companies (especially banks 
and brokerage firms) had questionable financial assets (such as sub-
prime mortgages and specialized bonds) that went bad, and they had 
to write them off as unrecoverable losses. Does the company you’re 
analyzing have a large exposure to financial assets that are low-quality 
(hence risky) debt?
 
✓ Inventory: Is inventory higher or lower than last year? If sales are flat 
but inventory is growing, that may be a potential problem.
 
✓ Debt: Debt is the biggest weakness on the corporate balance sheet. 
Make sure that debt isn’t a growing item and that it’s under control. In 
recent years, debt has become a huge problem.
 
✓ Derivatives: A derivative is a speculative and complex financial instru-
ment that doesn’t constitute ownership of an asset (such as a stock, 
bond, or commodity) but a promise to convey ownership. Some deriva-
tives are quite acceptable because they’re used as protective or hedging 
vehicles (this isn’t my primary concern). However, they’re frequently 
used to generate income and can then carry risks that can increase 
liabilities. Standard options and futures are examples of derivatives on a 
regulated exchange, but the derivatives I talk about here are a different 
animal and in an unregulated part of the financial world. They have a 
book value exceeding $600 trillion and can easily devastate a company, 
sector, or market (as the credit crisis of 2008 has shown).
 
 Find out whether the company dabbles in these complicated, dicey, 
leveraged financial instruments. Find out (from the company’s 10K 
report; see Chapter 12) whether it has derivatives and, if so, the total 
amount. If a company has derivatives that are valued higher than the 
company’s net equity, it may cause tremendous problems. Derivatives 
problems sank many organizations ranging from stodgy banks (Barings 
Bank of England) to affluent counties (Orange County, California) to 
once-respected hedge funds (LTCM) to infamous corporations (Enron).
 
✓ Equity: Equity is the company’s net worth (what’s left in the event 
that all the assets are used to pay off all the company debts). The stock-
holders’ equity should be increasing steadily by at least 10 percent per 
year. If not, find out why.

158
Part III: Picking Winners 
By looking at a company’s balance sheet, you can address the following 
questions:
 
✓ What does the company own (assets)? The company can own assets, 
which can be financial, tangible, and/or intangible. An asset is anything 
that has value or that can be converted to or sold for cash. Financial 
assets can be cash, investments (such as stocks or bonds of other com-
panies), or accounts receivable. Assets can be tangible things such as 
inventory, equipment, and/or buildings. They can also be intangible 
things such as licenses, trademarks, or copyrights.
 
✓ What does the company owe (liabilities)? A liability is anything of value 
that the company must ultimately pay to someone else. Liabilities can 
be invoices (accounts payable) or short-term or long-term debt.
 
✓ What is the company’s net equity (net worth)? After you subtract the 
liabilities from the assets, the remainder is called net worth, net equity, 
or net stockholders’ equity. This number is critical when calculating a 
company’s book value.
Assessing a company’s financial strength over time
The assets/liabilities relationship for a company has the same logic as the 
assets and liabilities in your own household. When you look at a snapshot 
of your own finances (your personal balance sheet), how can you tell 
whether you’re doing well? Odds are that you would start by comparing 
some numbers. If your net worth is $5,000, you may say, “That’s great!” But 
a more appropriate remark is something like, “That’s great compared to, 
say, a year ago.”
 
Compare a company’s balance sheet at a recent point in time to a past time. 
You should do this comparative analysis with all the key items on the balance 
sheet. You do this analysis to see the company’s progress. Is it growing its 
assets and/or shrinking its debt? Most important, is the company’s net worth 
growing? Is it growing by at least 10 percent from a year ago? All too often, 
investors stop doing their homework after they make an initial investment. 
You should continue to look at the firm’s numbers on a regular basis so that 
you can be ahead of the curve. If the business starts having problems, you can 
get out before the rest of the market starts getting out (which causes the stock 
price to fall).
 
To judge the financial strength of a company, ask yourself the following 
questions:
 
✓ Are the company’s assets greater in value than they were three months 
ago, a year ago, or two years ago? Compare current asset size to the 
most recent two years to make sure that the company is growing in size 
and financial strength.

159
 Chapter 11: Using Basic Accounting to Choose Winning Stocks
 
✓ How do the individual items compare with prior periods? Some particu-
lar assets that you want to take note of are cash, inventory, and 
accounts receivable.
 
✓ Are liabilities such as accounts payable and debt about the same, lower, 
or higher compared to prior periods? Are they growing at a similar, 
faster, or slower rate than the company’s assets? Debt that rises faster 
and higher than items on the other side of the balance sheet is a warning 
sign of pending financial problems.
 
✓ Is the company’s net worth or equity greater than the previous year? 
And is that year’s equity greater than the year before? In a healthy 
company, the net worth is constantly rising. As a general rule, in good 
economic times, net worth should be at least 10 percent higher than the 
previous year. In tough economic times (such as a recession), 5 percent 
is acceptable. Seeing the net worth growing at 15 percent or higher 
is great.
Looking at the income statement
Where do you look if you want to find out what a company’s profit is? Check 
out the firm’s income statement. It reports, in detail, a simple accounting 
equation that you probably already know:
Sales – expenses = Net profit (or net earnings, or net income)
 
Look at the following figures found on the income statement:
 
✓ Sales: Are they increasing? If not, why not? By what percentage are sales 
increasing? Preferably, they should be 10 percent higher than the year 
before. Sales are, after all, where the money is coming from to pay for all 
the company’s activities (such as expenses) and subsequent profit.
 
✓ Expenses: Do you see any unusual items? Are total expenses reported 
higher than the prior year, and by how much? If the total is significantly 
higher, why? A company with large, rising expenses will see profits 
suffer, which isn’t good for the stock price.
 
✓ Research and development (R&D): How much is the company spending 
on R&D? Companies that rely on new product development (such as 
pharmaceuticals or biotech firms) should spend at least as much as they 
did the year before (preferably more) because new products mean 
future earnings and growth.
 
✓ Earnings: This figure reflects the bottom line. Are total earnings higher? 
How about earnings from operations (leaving out expenses such as 
taxes and interest)? The earnings section is the heart and soul of the 
income statement and of the company itself. Out of all the numbers in 
the financial statements, earnings have the greatest single impact on 
the company’s stock price.

160
Part III: Picking Winners 
Looking at the income statement, an investor can try to answer the following 
questions:
 
✓ What sales did the company make? Businesses sell products and 
services that generate revenue (known as sales or gross sales). Sales 
also are referred to as the top line.
 
✓ What expenses did the company incur? In generating sales, companies 
pay expenses such as payroll, utilities, advertising, administration, and 
so on.
 
✓ What is the net income? Also called earnings or net profit, net income 
is the bottom line. After paying for all expenses, what profit did the 
company make?
The information you glean should give you a strong idea about a firm’s cur-
rent financial strength and whether it’s successfully increasing sales, holding 
down expenses, and ultimately maintaining profitability. You can find out 
more about sales, expenses, and profits in the sections that follow.
Sales
Sales refers to the money that a company receives as customers buy its 
goods and/or services. It’s a simple item on the income statement and 
a useful number to look at. Analyzing a business by looking at its sales is 
called top line analysis.
 
As an investor, you should take into consideration the following points 
about sales:
 
✓ Sales should be increasing. A healthy, growing company has growing 
sales. They should grow at least 10 percent from the prior year, and 
you should look at the most recent three years.
 
✓ Core sales (sales of those products or services that the company 
specializes in) should be increasing. Frequently, the sales figure has a 
lot of stuff lumped into it. Maybe the company sells widgets (what the 
heck is a widget, anyway?), but the core sales shouldn’t include other 
things, such as the sale of a building or other unusual items. Take a 
close look. Isolate the firm’s primary offerings and ask whether these 
sales are growing at a reasonable rate (such as 10 percent).
 
✓ Does the company have odd items or odd ways of calculating sales? 
In the late 1990s, many companies boosted their sales by aggressively 
offering affordable financing with easy repayment terms. Say you find 
out that Suspicious Sales Inc. (SSI) had annual sales of $50 million, 
reflecting a 25 percent increase from the year before. Looks great! But 
what if you find out that $20 million of that sales number comes from 
sales made on credit that the company extended to buyers? Some com-
panies that use this approach later have to write off losses as uncollect-
able debt because the customers ultimately can’t pay for the goods.

161
 Chapter 11: Using Basic Accounting to Choose Winning Stocks
 
If you want to get a good clue whether a company is artificially boosting sales, 
check its accounts receivable (listed in the asset section of its balance sheet). 
Accounts receivable refers to money that is owed to the company for goods 
that customers have purchased on credit. If you find out that sales went up by 
$10 million (great!) but accounts receivable went up by $20 million (uh-oh), 
then something just isn’t right. That may be a sign that the financing terms 
were too easy, and the company may have a problem collecting payment 
(especially in a recession).
Expenses
What a company spends has a direct relationship on its profitability. If spend-
ing isn’t controlled or held at a sustainable level, it may spell trouble for the 
business.
 
When you look at a company’s expense items, consider the following:
 
✓ Compare expense items to the prior period. Are expenses higher, 
lower, or about the same from the prior period? If the difference is 
significant, you should see commensurate benefits elsewhere. In other 
words, if overall expenses are 10 percent higher compared to the prior 
period, are sales at least 10 percent more during the same period?
 
✓ Are some expenses too high? Look at the individual expense items. Are 
they significantly higher than the year before? If so, why?
 
✓ Have any unusual items been expensed? Sometimes an unusual 
expense isn’t necessarily a negative. Expenses may be higher than usual 
if a company writes off uncollectable accounts receivable as a bad debt 
expense. Doing so inflates the total expenses and subsequently results 
in lower earnings. Pay attention to nonrecurring charges that show up 
on the income statement and determine whether they make sense.
Profit
Earnings or profit is the single most important item on the income statement. 
It’s also the one that receives the most attention in the financial media. When 
a company makes a profit, it’s usually reported as earnings per share (EPS). 
So if you hear that XYZ Corporation beat last quarter’s earnings by a penny, 
here’s how to translate that news. Suppose that the company made $1 per 
share this quarter and 99 cents per share last quarter. If that company 
had 100 million shares of stock outstanding, its profit this quarter is $100 
million (the EPS times the number of shares outstanding), which is $1 million 
more than it made in the prior quarter ($1 million is 1 cent per share times 
100 million shares).

162
Part III: Picking Winners 
 
Don’t simply look at current earnings as an isolated figure. Always compare 
current earnings to earnings in past periods (usually a year). For example, if 
you’re looking at a retailer’s fourth quarter results, you can’t compare that 
with the retailer’s third quarter. Doing so is like comparing apples to oranges. 
What if the company usually does well during the December holidays but 
poorly in the fall? In that case, you don’t get a fair comparison.
A strong company should show consistent earnings growth from the period 
before (such as the year or the same quarter from the prior year), and 
you should check the period before that, too, so that you can determine 
whether earnings are consistently rising over time. Earnings growth is an 
important barometer of the company’s potential growth and bodes well for 
the stock price.
 
When you look at earnings, here are some things to consider:
 
✓ Total earnings: This item is the most watched. Total earnings should 
grow year to year by at least 10 percent.
 
✓ Operational earnings: Break down the total earnings and look at a key 
subset — that portion of earnings derived from the company’s core 
activity. Is the company continuing to make money from its primary 
goods and services?
 
✓ Nonrecurring items: Are earnings higher (or lower) than usual or than 
expected, and why? Frequently, the difference results from items such 
as the sale of an asset or a large depreciation write-off.
 
I like to keep percentages as simple as possible. Ten percent is a good number 
because it’s easy to calculate and it’s a good benchmark. However, 5 percent 
isn’t unacceptable if you’re talking about tough times, such as a recession. 
Obviously, if sales, earnings, and/or net worth are hitting or passing 15 
percent, that’s great.
Tooling around with ratios
A ratio is a helpful numerical tool that you can use to find out the relation-
ship between two or more figures found in a company’s financial data. 
A ratio can add meaning to a number or put it in perspective. Ratios sound 
complicated, but they’re easier to understand than you think.
Say that you’re considering a stock investment and the company you’re look-
ing at has earnings of $1 million this year. You may think that’s a nice profit, 
but in order for this amount to be meaningful, you have to compare it to 
something. What if you find out that the other companies in the industry (of 
similar size and scope) had earnings of $500 million? Does that change your 
thinking? Or what if you find out that the same company had earnings of $75 
million in the prior period? Does that change your mind?

163
 Chapter 11: Using Basic Accounting to Choose Winning Stocks
Two key ratios to be aware of are
 
✓ Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)
 
✓ Price to sales ratio (PSR)
 
Every investor wants to find stocks that have a 20 percent average growth rate 
over the past five years and have a low P/E ratio (sounds like a dream). Use 
stock screening tools available for free on the Internet to do your research. 
Many brokers have them at their Web sites (such as Charles Schwab at www.
schwab.com and E*TRADE at www.etrade.com). Some excellent stock 
screening tools can also be found at Yahoo! (finance.yahoo.com), Business 
Week (www.businessweek.com), Nasdaq (www.nasdaq.com), and 
MarketWatch (www.marketwatch.com). A stock screening tool lets you plug 
in numbers such as sales or earnings and ratios such as the P/E ratio or the 
debt to equity ratio and then click! — up come stocks that fit your criteria. 
This is a good starting point for serious investors. Check out Appendix B for 
even more on ratios.
The P/E ratio
The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is very important in analyzing a potential 
stock investment because it’s one of the most widely regarded barometers 
of a company’s value, and it’s usually reported along with the company’s 
stock price in the financial page listing. The major significance of the P/E 
ratio is that it establishes a direct relationship between the bottom line of a 
company’s operations — the earnings — and the stock price.
The P in P/E stands for the stock’s current price. The E is for earnings per 
share (typically the most recent 12 months of earnings). The P/E ratio is also 
referred to as the “earnings multiple” or just “multiple.”
 
You calculate the P/E ratio by dividing the price of the stock by the earnings 
per share. If the price of a single share of stock is $10 and the earnings (on a 
per-share basis) are $1, then the P/E is 10. If the stock price goes to $35 per 
share and the earnings are unchanged, then the P/E is 35. Basically, the higher 
the P/E, the more you pay for the company’s earnings.
Why would you buy stock in one company with a relatively high P/E ratio 
instead of investing in another company with a lower P/E ratio? Keep in mind 
that investors buy stocks based on expectations. They may bid up the price 
of the stock (subsequently raising the stock’s P/E ratio) because they feel 
that the company will have increased earnings in the near future. Perhaps 
they feel that the company has great potential (a pending new invention or 
lucrative business deal) that will eventually make it more profitable. More 
profitability in turn has a beneficial impact on the firm’s stock price. The 
danger with a high P/E is that if the company doesn’t achieve the hopeful 
results, the stock price could fall.

164
Part III: Picking Winners 
 
You should look at two types of P/E ratios to get a balanced picture of the 
company’s value:
 
✓ Trailing P/E: This P/E is the most frequently quoted because it deals 
with existing data. The trailing P/E uses the most recent 12 months of 
earnings in its calculation.
 
✓ Forward P/E: This P/E is based on projections or expectations of 
earnings in the coming 12-month period. Although this P/E may seem 
preferable because it looks into the near future, it’s still considered 
an estimate that may or may not prove to be accurate.
The following example illustrates the importance of the P/E ratio. Say that 
you want to buy a business and that I’m selling a business. If you come to me 
and say, “What do you have to offer?” I may say, “Have I got a deal for you! I 
operate a retail business downtown that sells spatulas. The business nets a 
cool $2,000 profit per year.” You reluctantly say, “Uh, okay, what’s the asking 
price for the business?” I reply, “You can have it for only $1 million! What do 
you say?”
If you’re sane, odds are that you politely turn down that offer. Even though 
the business is profitable (a cool $2,000 a year), you’d be crazy to pay a 
million bucks for it. In other words, the business is way overvalued (too 
expensive for what you’re getting in return for your investment dollars). 
The million dollars would generate a better rate of return elsewhere and 
probably with less risk. As for the business, the P/E ratio of 500 ($1 million 
divided by $2,000) is outrageous. This is definitely a case of an overvalued 
company — and a lousy investment.
What if I offered the business for $12,000? Does that price make more sense? 
Yes. The P/E ratio is a more reasonable 6 ($12,000 divided by $2,000). In 
other words, the business pays for itself in about 6 years (versus 500 years 
in the prior example).
Looking at the P/E ratio offers a shortcut for investors asking the question, 
“Is this stock overvalued?” As a general rule, the lower the P/E, the safer 
(or more conservative) the stock is. The reverse is more noteworthy: The 
higher the P/E, the greater the risk.
 
When someone refers to a P/E as high or low, you have to ask the question, 
“Compared to what?” A P/E of 30 is considered very high for a large cap 
electric utility but quite reasonable for a small cap, high-technology firm. Keep 
in mind that phrases such as “large cap” and “small cap” are just a reference 
to the company’s market value or size (see Chapter 1 for details on these 
terms). “Cap” is short for “capitalization” (the total number of shares of stock 
outstanding times the share price).

165
 Chapter 11: Using Basic Accounting to Choose Winning Stocks
The following basic points can help you evaluate P/E ratios:
 
✓ Compare a company’s P/E ratio with its industry. Electric utility industry 
stocks, for example, generally have a P/E that hovers in the 9–14 
range. Therefore, an electric utility with a P/E of 45 indicates that some-
thing is wrong with that utility. (I explain how to analyze industries 
in Chapter 13.)
 
✓ Compare a company’s P/E with the general market. If you’re looking at a 
small cap stock on the Nasdaq that has a P/E of 100 but the average P/E 
for established companies on the Nasdaq is 40, find out why. You should 
also compare the stock’s P/E ratio with the P/E ratio for major indexes 
such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), the Standard & Poor’s 
500 (S&P 500), and the Nasdaq Composite (for more on market indexes, 
see Chapter 5).
 
✓ Compare a company’s current P/E with recent periods (such as this year 
versus last year). If it currently has a P/E ratio of 20 and it previously 
had a P/E ratio of 30, you know that either the stock price has declined 
or that earnings have risen. In this case, the stock is less likely to fall. 
That bodes well for the stock.
 
✓ Low P/E ratios aren’t necessarily a sign of a bargain, but if you’re looking 
at a stock for many other reasons that seem positive (solid sales, strong 
industry, and so on) and it also has a low P/E, that’s a good sign.
 
✓ High P/E ratios aren’t necessarily bad, but they do mean that you should 
investigate further. If a company is weak and the industry is shaky, 
heed the high P/E as a warning sign. Frequently, a high P/E ratio means 
that investors have bid up a stock price, anticipating future income. 
The problem is that if the anticipated income doesn’t materialize, the 
stock price could fall.
 
✓ Watch out for a stock that doesn’t have a P/E ratio. In other words, it 
may have a price (the P), but it doesn’t have earnings (the E). No 
earnings means no P/E, meaning that you’re better off avoiding it. Can 
you still make money buying a stock with no earnings? You can, but 
you aren’t investing; you’re speculating.
The PSR
The price to sales ratio (PSR) is a company’s stock price divided by its sales. 
Because the sales number is rarely expressed as a per-share figure, it’s easier 
to divide a company’s total market value (I explain what this term means 
earlier in this chapter) by its total sales for the last 12 months.
 
As a general rule, stock trading at a PSR of 1 or less is a reasonably priced 
stock worthy of your attention. For example, say that a company has sales 
of $1 billion and the stock has a total market value of $950 million. In that 
case, the PSR is 0.95. In other words, you can buy $1 of the company’s sales 
for only 95 cents. All things being equal, that stock may be a bargain.

166
Part III: Picking Winners 
Analysts frequently use the PSR as an evaluation tool in the following 
circumstances:
 
✓ In tandem with other ratios to get a more well-rounded picture of the 
company and the stock.
 
✓ When they want an alternate way to value a business that doesn’t have 
earnings.
 
✓ When they want a true picture of the company’s financial health, 
because sales are tougher for companies to manipulate than earnings.
 
✓ When they’re considering a company offering products (versus ser-
vices). PSR is more suitable for companies that sell items that are easily 
counted (such as products). Firms that make their money through loans, 
such as banks, aren’t usually valued with a PSR because deriving a 
usable PSR for them is more difficult.
 
Compare the company’s PSR with other companies in the same industry, 
along with the industry average, so that you get a better idea of the company’s 
relative value.

▶ Paging through an annual report
▶ Reviewing other information sources for a second opinion
▶ Organizing your own research library
F
inancial documents — good grief! Some people would rather suck a 
hospital mop than read some dry corporate or government report. Yet 
if you’re serious about choosing stocks, you should be serious about your 
research. Fortunately, it’s not as bad as you think (put away that disgusting 
mop). When you see that some basic research helps you build wealth, it 
gets easier.
In this chapter, I discuss the basic documents that you come across (or 
should come across) most often in your investing life. These documents 
include essential information that all investors need to know, not only at the 
time of the initial investment decision, but also for as long as that stock 
remains in their portfolio.
 
If you plan to hold a stock for the long haul, reading the annual report and 
other reports covered in this chapter will be very helpful. If you intend to get 
rid of the stock soon or plan to hold it only for the short term, reading these 
reports diligently isn’t that important.
Getting a Message from the Bigwigs: 
The Annual Report
When you’re a regular stockholder, the company sends you its annual 
report. If you’re not already a stockholder, contact the company’s share-
holder service department for a hard copy.

168
Part III: Picking Winners 
 
You can often view a company’s annual report at its Web site. Any major 
search engine can help you find it. Downloading or printing the annual report 
should be easy.
You need to carefully analyze an annual report to find out the following:
 
✓ How well the company is doing. Are earnings higher, lower, or the 
same as the year before? How are sales doing? These numbers should 
be clearly presented in the annual report’s financial section.
 
✓ Whether the company is making more money than it’s spending. How 
does the balance sheet look? Are assets higher or lower than the year 
before? Is debt growing, shrinking, or about the same as the year before? 
For more details on balance sheets, see Chapter 11.
 
✓ What management’s strategic plan is for the coming year. How will 
management build on the company’s success? This plan is usually 
covered in the beginning of the annual report — frequently in the letter 
from the chairman of the board.
 
Your task boils down to figuring out where the company has been, where it is 
now, and where it’s going. As an investor, you don’t need to read the annual 
report like a novel — from cover to cover. Instead, approach it like a newspa-
per and jump around to the relevant sections to get the answers you need to 
decide whether you should buy or hold onto the stock. I describe the makeup 
of the annual report and proxy materials in the following sections.
Analyzing the annual report’s anatomy
Not every company puts its annual report together in exactly the same 
way — the style of presentation varies. Some annual reports have gorgeous 
graphics or coupons for the company’s products, while others are in a 
standard black-and-white typeface with no cosmetic frills at all. But every 
annual report does include common basic content, such as the income 
statement and the balance sheet. The following sections present typical 
components of an average annual report. (Keep in mind that not every annual 
report will have the sections in the same order.)
The letter from the chairman of the board
The first thing you see is usually the letter from the chairman of the board. 
It’s the “Dear Stockholder” letter that communicates views from the head 
muckety-muck. The chairman’s letter is designed to put the best possible 
perspective on the company’s operations during the past year. Be aware of 
this bias; no one in upper management wants to panic stockholders. If the 
company is doing well, the letter will certainly point it out. If the company is 

169
 Chapter 12: Decoding Company Documents
having hard times, the letter will probably put a positive spin on the compa-
ny’s difficulties. If the Titanic had an annual report, odds are that the last 
letter would have reported, “Great news! A record number of our customers 
participated in our spontaneous moonlight swimming program. In addition, 
we confidently project no operating expenses whatsoever for the subsequent 
fiscal quarter.” You get the point.
 
To get a good idea of what issues the company’s management team feels 
are important and what goals they want to accomplish, keep the following 
questions in mind:
 
✓ What does the letter say about changing conditions in the company’s 
business? How about in the industry?
 
✓ If any difficulties exist, does the letter communicate a clear and logical 
action plan (cutting costs, closing money-losing plants, and so on) to get 
the company back on a positive track?
 
✓ What’s being highlighted and why? For example, is the firm focusing 
on research and development for new products or on a new deal with 
China?
 
✓ Does the letter offer apologies for anything the company did? If, for 
example, it fell short of sales expectations, does the letter offer a reason 
for the shortcoming?
 
✓ Did the company make (or will it make) new acquisitions or major devel-
opments (selling products to China, or a new marketing agreement with 
a Fortune 500 company)?
 
You should read an annual report (or any messages from upper management) 
in the same way you read or hear anything from a politician — be more con-
cerned with means than ends. In other words, don’t tell me what the goal is 
(greater profitability, or peace on earth), tell me how you’re going to get there. 
Executives may say that “we will increase sales and profits,” but saying “we 
will increase sales and profits by doing X, Y, and Z” is a better message, 
because you can then decide for yourself if the road map makes sense.
The company’s offerings
This section of an annual report can have various titles (such as “Sales and 
Marketing”), but it generally covers what the company sells. You should 
understand the products or services (or both) that the business sells and 
why customers purchase them. If you don’t understand what the company 
offers, then understanding how it earns money, which is the driving force 
behind its stock, is more difficult.

170
Part III: Picking Winners 
 
Are the company’s core or primary offerings selling well? If the earnings of 
McDonald’s are holding steady but earnings strictly from burgers and fries are 
fizzling, that’s a cause for concern. If a business ceases making money from its 
specialty, you should become cautious. Here are some other questions to ask:
 
✓ How does the company distribute its offerings — through a Web site, 
malls, representatives, or some other means? Does it sell only to the U.S. 
market, or is its distribution international? Generally, the greater the 
distribution, the greater the potential sales and, ultimately, the higher 
the stock price.
 
✓ Are most of the company’s sales to a definable marketplace? For exam-
ple, if most of the sales are to a war-torn or politically unstable country, 
you should worry. If the company’s customers aren’t doing well, that 
has a direct impact on the company and, eventually, its stock.
 
✓ How are sales doing versus market standards? In other words, is the 
company doing better than the industry average? Is it a market leader 
in what it offers? The firm should be doing better than (or as well as) its 
peers in the industry. If the company is falling behind its competitors, 
that doesn’t bode well for the stock in the long run.
 
✓ Does the report include information on the company’s competitors and 
related matters? You should know who the company’s competitors are 
because they have a direct effect on the company’s success. If custom-
ers are choosing the competitor over your firm, the slumping sales and 
earnings will ultimately hurt the stock’s price.
Financial statements
Look over the various financial statements and find the relevant numbers. 
Every annual report should have (at the very least) a balance sheet and 
an income statement. Catching the important numbers on a financial state-
ment isn’t that difficult to do. However, it certainly helps when you pick up 
some basic accounting knowledge. Chapter 11 can give you more details on 
evaluating financial statements.
First, review the income statement (also known as the profit and loss state-
ment, or simply P&L). It gives you the company’s sales, expenses, and the 
result (net income or net loss). Next, look at the balance sheet. It provides 
a snapshot of a point in time (annual reports usually provide a year-end 
balance sheet) that tells you what the company owns (assets), what it owes 
(liabilities), and the end result (net worth). For a healthy company, assets 
should always be greater than liabilities.
 
Carefully read the footnotes to the financial statements. Sometimes big 
changes are communicated in small print. In current times, especially be wary 
of small print pointing out other debt or derivatives. Derivatives are compli-
cated and (lately) very risky vehicles. Problems with derivatives were one

Wall Street during late 2008. AIG, for example, is a major insurer that had 
to be bailed out by the Federal Reserve before it went bankrupt (shareholders 
suffered huge losses).
Summary of past financial figures
The summary of past financial figures gives you a snapshot of the company’s 
overall long-term progress. How many years does the annual report summa-
rize? Some reports summarize three years, while most go back two years.
Management issues
The annual report’s management issues section includes a reporting of cur-
rent trends and issues, such as new developments happening in the industry 
that affect the company. See whether you agree with management’s assess-
ment of economic and market conditions that affect the firm’s prospects. 
What significant developments in society does management perceive as 
affecting the company’s operations? Does the report include information on 
current or pending lawsuits?
CPA opinion letter
Annual reports typically include comments from the company’s independent 
accounting firm. It may be an opinion letter or a simple paragraph with the 
accounting firm’s views regarding the financial statements.
The CPA opinion letter should offer an opinion about the accuracy of the 
financial data presented and information on how the statements were pre-
pared. Check to see whether the letter includes any footnotes regarding 
changes in certain numbers or how they were reported. For example, a 
company that wants to report higher earnings may use a conservative 
method of measuring depreciation instead of a more aggressive approach. 
In any case, you should verify the numbers by looking at the company’s 
10K document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC; I 
describe this document in more detail later in this chapter).
Company identity data
The company identity data section informs you about the company’s subsid-
iaries (or lesser businesses that it owns), brands, and addresses. It also 
contains standard data such as the headquarters location and names of 
directors and officers. Many reports also include data on the directors’ and 
officers’ positions in stock ownership at year’s end.
Stock data
The stock data section may include a history of the stock price, along with 
information such as what exchange the stock is listed on, the stock symbol, 
the company’s dividend reinvestment plan (if any), and so on. It also 
includes information on stockholder services and who to contact for further 
information.

Going through the proxy materials
As a shareholder (or stockholder — same thing), you’re entitled to vote at 
the annual shareholders meeting. If you ever get the opportunity to attend 
one, do so. You get to meet other shareholders and ask questions of manage-
ment and other company representatives. Usually, the shareholder services 
department provides you with complete details. At the meetings, sharehold-
ers vote on company matters, such as approving the new accounting firm or 
deciding whether a proposed merger with another company will go forward.
If you can’t attend (which is usually true for the majority of shareholders), 
you can vote by proxy. Voting by proxy essentially means that you vote by 
mail. You indicate your votes on the proxy statement (or card) and authorize 
a representative to vote at the meeting on your behalf. The proxy statement 
is usually sent to all shareholders, along with the annual report, just before 
the meeting.
Getting a Second Opinion
A wealth of valuable information is available for your investing pursuits. The 
resources in this section are just a representative few — a good representa-
tion, though. To get a more balanced view of the company and its prospects, 
take a look at several different sources of information for the stocks you’re 
researching.
 
The information and research they provide can be expensive if you buy or 
subscribe on your own, but fortunately, most of the resources mentioned 
are usually available in the business reference section of a well-stocked public 
library.
Company documents filed with the SEC
The serious investor doesn’t overlook the wealth of information that he can 
cull from documents filed with the SEC. Take the time and effort to review 
these documents, because they offer great insight regarding the company’s 
activities.
 
Here’s how to obtain the main documents that investors should be aware of:
 
✓ Drop by the company itself. Stockholder service departments keep 
these publicly available documents on hand and usually give them out 
at no cost to interested parties.

173
 Chapter 12: Decoding Company Documents
 
✓ Visit the SEC, either in person or online. These documents are avail-
able for public viewing at the SEC offices. You can find out more by 
contacting the Securities and Exchange Commission, Publications Unit, 
450 Fifth St. NW, Washington, DC 20549.
 
 At the SEC’s Web site (www.sec.gov), you can check out EDGAR 
(Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system) to search 
public documents filed. It’s a tremendous source of documents that 
date back to 1994. You can search, print, or download documents 
very easily. Documents can be located either by document number or 
keyword search.
 
✓ Check out the Public Register’s Annual Report Service (www.prars.
com). This organization maintains an extensive collection of annual 
reports.
 
✓ Review the Annual Report Service (www.annualreportservice.
com). This site maintains an extensive database of annual reports.
 
✓ Use The Wall Street Journal free annual report service. If you read 
this newspaper’s financial pages and see a company with the club 
symbol (like the one you see on a playing card), then you can order that 
company’s annual report by calling 800-654-2582 or visiting the Web 
site (www.wsj.com).
Form 10K
Gee, how intimidating. Just the report name alone makes you scratch your 
head. To some people, 10K refers to running a race of 10 kilometers. But 
if you’re reading (not running) a 10K, you may wish you were running one 
instead.
Form 10K is a report that companies must file with the SEC annually. It works 
like the annual report that you get from the company, except that it provides 
more detailed financial information. It can be a little intimidating because the 
text can be dry and cumbersome. It’s not exactly Shakespeare (although 10K 
reports would’ve also driven Lady Macbeth insane); then again, the data isn’t 
laden with as much spin as the annual report the company sends to share-
holders. Without going crazy, go through each section of the 10K. Take some 
extra time to scrutinize the section on financial data. Ask the same questions 
that you do when you’re looking at the annual report.
 
The following Web sites can help you make sense of 10K reports:
 
✓ FreeEDGAR (www.freeedgar.com)
 
✓ 10K Wizard (www.10Kwizard.com)
 
✓ Edgar Online, Inc. (www.edgar-online.com)

174
Part III: Picking Winners 
Form 10Q
This form is a quarterly report that gives you the same basic information as 
the 10K, but it details only three months’ worth of activity. Because a long 
time can pass between 10Ks (after all, it is a year), don’t wait 12 months 
to see how your company is progressing. Make a habit of seeing how the 
company is doing by comparing its recent 10Q with one that covers the same 
quarter last year. Is the profit higher or lower? How about sales? Debt?
 
Keep in mind that not every company has the same fiscal year. A company 
with a calendar year fiscal year (ending December 31) files a 10Q for each 
of the first three quarters and files a 10K for the final quarter. The company 
reports its fourth quarter data in the 10K, along with the statistics for the 
full year.
Insider reports
Two types of insiders exist: those who work within a company and those out-
side the company who have a significant (10 percent or more) ownership of 
company stock. Tracking insider activity is very profitable for investors who 
want to follow in the footsteps of the people in the know. See Chapter 20 for 
information about monitoring and benefiting from insider activity.
 
Every time an insider (such as the CEO or controller) buys or sells stock, the 
transaction has to be reported to the SEC. The insider actually reports the 
trade prior to transacting it. These reports are publicly available documents 
that allow you to see what the insiders are actually doing. Hearing what they 
say in public is one thing, but seeing what they’re actually doing with their 
stock transactions is more important.
Value Line
The Value Line Investment Survey, one of many information products pro-
vided by Value Line Publishing, Inc., is considered a longtime favorite by 
many stock investing professionals. You can look it over at any library 
that has a good business reference department. In the survey, Value Line 
covers the largest public companies and ranks them according to financial 
strength and several other key business factors. To get more information 
about Value Line, either head to the library or visit www.valueline.com.
Standard & Poor’s
Another ubiquitous and venerable publisher is Standard & Poor’s (S&P). 
Although it has a number of quality information products and services for 
both individual and institutional investors, the three you should take a look 
at are the following:

175
 Chapter 12: Decoding Company Documents
 
✓ S&P Stock Reports: Available at many libraries, this guide comes out 
periodically and reports on stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, 
American Stock Exchange, and the largest firms listed on Nasdaq. It 
gives a succinct, two-page summary of each stock, offering a snapshot of 
the company’s current finances, along with a brief history and commen-
tary on the company’s activities. This guide also rates companies based 
on their financial strength.
 
✓ The S&P Industry Survey: S&P gives detailed reports on the top indus-
tries, cramming a lot of information about a given industry in four to 
seven pages. This annual publication provides a nice summary of what’s 
happened in each industry in the past 12 months, what the industry 
looks like today, and what the prospects are for the coming year. It also 
provides the important numbers (earnings, sales, and industry ranking) 
for the top 50 to 100 firms in each industry.
 
✓ S&P Bond Reports: Yes, I know this book is about stocks. But a compa-
ny’s bond rating is invaluable for stock investors. S&P analyzes the 
strength of the bond issuer and ranks the bond for creditworthiness. If 
S&P gives a company a high rating, you have added assurance that the 
company is financially strong. You want the company to have a bond 
rating of AAA, AA, or A, because these ratings tell you that the company 
is “investment-grade.”
 
Check out S&P’s Web site at www.standardandpoors.com for more infor-
mation about its publications.
Moody’s Investment Service
Another stalwart publisher, Moody’s offers vital research on stocks and 
bonds. Moody’s Handbook of Common Stocks is usually available in the refer-
ence section of a well-stocked library. It offers stock and bond guides similar 
to S&P and also provides an independent bond-rating service. A stock rated 
highly by both Moody’s and S&P is a great choice for investors hunting for 
value investments.
Brokerage reports: The good, 
the bad, and the ugly
Clint Eastwood, where are you? Traditionally, brokerage reports have been 
a good source of information for investors seeking informed opinions about 
stocks. And they still are, but in recent years some brokers have been penal-
ized for biased reports. Brokers should never be the sole source of informa-
tion. Otherwise, Clint may ask them whether they’re lucky punks.

176
Part III: Picking Winners 
The good
Research departments at brokerage firms provide stock reports and make 
them available for their clients and investment publications. The firms’ ana-
lysts and market strategists generally prepare these reports. Good research 
is critical, and brokerage reports can be very valuable. What better source 
of guidance than full-time experts backed up by million-dollar research 
departments? Brokerage reports have some strong points:
 
✓ The analysts are professionals who should understand the value of a 
company and its stock. They analyze and compare company data 
every day.
 
✓ They have at their disposal tremendous information and historical data 
that they can sift through to make informed decisions.
 
✓ If you have an account with the firm, you can usually access the informa-
tion at no cost.
The bad
 
Well, brokerage reports may not be bad in every case, but at their worst, 
they’re quite bad. Brokers make their money from commissions and invest-
ment banking fees (nothing bad here). However, they can find themselves 
in the awkward position of issuing brokerage reports on companies that are 
(or could be) customers of the brokerage firm that employs them (hmmm — 
could be bad). Frequently, this relationship results in a brokerage report that 
paints an overly positive picture of a company that can be a bad investment 
(yup, that’s bad).
The ugly
During 1998–2000, an overwhelming number of brokerage reports issued 
glowing praise of companies that were either mediocre or dubious. Investors 
bought up stocks such as tech stocks and Internet stocks. The sheer demand 
pushed up stock prices, which gave the appearance of genius to analysts’ 
forecasts, yet the stock prices rose essentially as a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
The stocks were way overvalued and were cruisin’ for a bruisin.’ Analysts 
and investors were feeling lucky.
Investors, however, lost a ton of money (ooh, ugly). Money that people 
painstakingly accumulated over many years of work vanished in a matter of 
months as the bear market of 2000 hit (ooh, ugly). Retirees who had trusted 
the analysts saw nest eggs lose 40 to 70 percent in value (yikes, very ugly). In 
total, investors lost over $5 trillion during 2000–2002, much of it needlessly.
 
During that bear market, a record number of lawsuits and complaints were 
filed against brokerage firms. Wall Street and Main Street learned some 
tough lessons. Regarding research reports from brokerage firms, the following 
points can help you avoid getting a bad case of the uglies:

177
 Chapter 12: Decoding Company Documents
 
✓ Always ask yourself, “Is the provider of the report a biased source?” In 
other words, is the broker getting business in any way from the com-
pany he’s recommending?
 
✓ Never, never, NEVER rely on just one source of information, especially 
if it’s the same source that’s selling you the stock or other investment.
 
✓ Do your research first before you rely on a brokerage report.
 
✓ Do your due diligence before you buy stocks anyway. Look at the chap-
ters in Parts I and II to understand your need for diversification, risk 
tolerance, and so on.
 
✓ Verify the information provided to you with a trip to the library or Web 
sites (see Appendix A).
 
Although I generally don’t rely on Wall Street brokerage analysts, I do track 
some independent investment analysts. You’ll find some of my favorites 
mentioned in Appendix A.
Compiling Your Own Research 
Department
You don’t need to spend an excessive amount of time or money, but you 
should maintain your own library of resources. You may only need one shelf 
(or a small amount of memory on your computer’s hard drive), but why not 
have a few investment facts and resources at your fingertips? I maintain my 
own library loaded with books, magazines, newsletters, and tons of great 
stuff downloaded on my computer for easy search and reference. When you 
start your own collection, follow these tips:
 
✓ Keep some select newspapers. Barron’s, The Wall Street Journal, and 
Investor’s Business Daily regularly have some editions that are worth 
keeping. For example, The Wall Street Journal and Investor’s Business 
Daily usually publish a year-in-review issue the first business week in 
January. Barron’s has special issues reviewing brokers and financial 
Web sites.
 
✓ Subscribe to financial magazines. Publications such as Forbes and 
SmartMoney offer great research and regularly review stocks, brokers, 
and resources for investors.
 
✓ Keep annual reports. Regarding the stocks that are the core holdings in 
your portfolio, keep all the annual reports (at the very least, the most 
recent three).

178
Part III: Picking Winners 
 
✓ Go to the library’s business reference section periodically to stay 
updated. Hey, you pay the taxes that maintain the public library — you 
may as well use it to stay informed.
 
✓ Use the Internet for research. The Web offers plenty of great sites to 
peruse; I list some of the best in Appendix A.
 
Financial reports are very important and easier to read than most people 
think. An investor can easily avoid a bad investment by simply noticing the 
data in what seems like a jumble of numbers. Figure out how to read them. 
For a great book to help you with reading financial reports (without needless 
technicality), check out How to Read a Financial Report: Wringing Vital Signs 
Out of the Numbers, 6th Edition, by John A. Tracy (published by Wiley).

Chapter 13
Analyzing Industries
In This Chapter
▶ Selecting industries by asking a few important questions
▶ Keeping an eye on four major industries
S
uppose that you have to bet your entire nest egg on a one-mile race. All 
you need to do is select a winning group. Your choices are the following:
Group A: Thoroughbred race horses
Group B: Overweight Elvis impersonators
Group C: Lethargic snails
This isn’t a trick question, and you have one minute to answer. Notice that I 
didn’t ask you to pick a single winner out of a giant mush of horses, Elvii, and 
snails; I only asked you to pick the winning group in the race. The obvious 
answer is the thoroughbred race horses (and no, they weren’t ridden by 
the overweight Elvis impersonators because that would take away from the 
eloquent point being made). In this example, even the slowest member of 
group A easily outdistances the fastest member of either group B or C.
Industries, like groups A, B, and C in my example, aren’t equal, and life isn’t 
fair. After all, if life were fair, Elvis would be alive and the impersonators 
wouldn’t exist. Fortunately, picking stocks doesn’t have to be as difficult 
as picking a winning racehorse. The basic point is that it’s easier to pick a 
successful stock from a group of winners (a growing, vibrant industry). 
Understanding industries only enhances your stock-picking strategy.
A successful, long-term investor looks at the industry just as carefully as he 
looks at the individual stock. Luckily, choosing a winning industry to invest 
in is easier than choosing individual stocks, as you find out in this chapter. I 
know some investors who can pick a winning stock in a losing industry, 
and I also know investors who’ve chosen a losing stock in a winning industry 
(the former is far outnumbered by the latter). Just think how well you do 
when you choose a great stock in a great industry! Of course, if you repeat-
edly choose bad stocks in bad industries, you may as well get out of the 
stock market altogether (maybe your calling is instead to be a celebrity 
impersonator!).

Part III: Picking Winners 
Interrogating the Industries
Your common sense is an important tool in choosing industries with winning 
stocks. The following sections explore some of the most important questions 
to ask yourself when you’re choosing an industry.
 
Keep in mind that an industry isn’t the same as a sector. Even some market 
pros use the two words almost interchangeably. A sector is basically a “mega-
industry,” or a group of interrelated industries. For example, pharmaceuticals 
and HMOs are each an industry, but both are part of the healthcare sector. 
An industry is typically a category of business that performs a precise activity 
(such as manufacturing computer chips, or trucking). Not all industries in a 
sector perform equally in the same market conditions. See Chapter 14 for full 
details on sectors.
Which category does the 
industry fall into?
Most industries can neatly be placed in one of two categories: cyclical and 
defensive. In a rough way, these categories generally translate into what soci-
ety wants and what it needs. Society buys what it wants when times are good 
and holds off when times are bad. It buys what it needs in both good and bad 
times. A want is a “like to have,” while a need is a “must have.” Kapish?
Cyclical industries
Cyclical industries are industries whose fortunes rise and fall with the econo-
my’s rise and fall. In other words, if the economy is doing well and the stock 
market is doing well, consumers and investors are confident and tend to 
spend and invest more money than usual, so cyclical industries tend to do 
well. Real estate and automobiles are great examples of cyclical industries.
Your own situation offers you some common-sense insight into the concept 
of cyclical industries. Think about your behavior as a consumer and you 
get a revealing clue into the thinking of millions of consumers. When you 
(and millions of others) feel good about your career, your finances, and your 
future, you have a greater tendency to buy more (and/or more expensive) 
stuff. When people feel financially strong, they’re more apt to buy a new 
house or car or make some other large financial commitment. Also, people 
take on more debt because they feel confident that they can pay it back. In 
light of this behavior, what industries do you think would do well?

181
 Chapter 13: Analyzing Industries
The same point holds for business spending. When businesses think that 
economic times are good and foresee continuing good times, they tend to 
spend more money on large purchases such as new equipment or technol-
ogy. They think that when they’re doing well and are flush with financial 
success, it’s a good idea to reinvest that money in the business to increase 
future success.
Defensive industries
Defensive industries are industries that produce goods and services that are 
needed no matter what’s happening in the economy. Your common sense 
kicks in here, too. What do you buy even when times are tough? Think about 
what millions of people buy no matter how bad the economy gets. A good 
example is food — people still need to eat regardless of good or bad times. 
Other examples of defensive industries are utilities and healthcare.
 
In bad economic times, defensive stocks tend to do better than cyclical 
stocks. However, when times are good, cyclical stocks tend to do better than 
defensive stocks. Defensive stocks don’t do as well in good times because 
people don’t eat twice as much or use up more electricity.
So how do defensive stocks grow? Their growth generally relies on two 
factors:
 
✓ Population growth: As more and more consumers are born, more 
people become available to buy.
 
✓ New markets: A company can grow by seeking out new groups of con-
sumers to buy their products and services. Coca-Cola, for example, 
found new markets in Asia during the 1990s. As communist regimes fell 
from power and more societies embraced a free market and consumer 
goods, the company sold more beverages, and its stock soared.
 
One way to invest in a particular industry is to take advantage of exchange-
traded funds (ETFs), which have become very popular in recent years. ETFs 
are structured much like mutual funds but are fixed portfolios that trade 
like a stock. If you find a winning industry but you can’t find a winning stock 
(or don’t want to bother with the necessary research), then ETFs are a great 
consideration. You can find out more about ETFs at the American Stock 
Exchange Web site (www.amex.com).
Is the industry growing?
The question may seem obvious, but you still need to ask it before you pur-
chase stock. The saying “the trend is your friend” applies when choosing an 
industry in which to invest, as long as the trend is an upward one. If you look 

182
Part III: Picking Winners 
at three different stocks that are equal in every significant way but you find 
that stock A is in an industry growing 15 percent per year while the other two 
stocks are in industries that have either little growth or are shrinking, which 
stock would you choose?
Sometimes the stock of a financially unsound or poorly run company goes up 
dramatically because the industry it’s in is very exciting to the public. The 
most obvious example is Internet stocks from 1998–2000. Stocks such as Pets.
com shot up to incredible heights because investors thought the Internet 
was the place to be. Sooner or later, however, the measure of a successful 
company is its ability to be profitable (Pets.com went bankrupt in 2000). 
Serious investors look at the company’s fundamentals (see Chapter 11 to 
find out how to do this) and the prospects for the industry’s growth before 
settling on a particular stock.
 
To judge how well an industry is doing, various information sources monitor 
all the major industries and measure their progress. The more reliable sources 
include the following:
 
✓ MarketWatch (www.marketwatch.com)
 
✓ Standard & Poor’s (www.standardpoor.com)
 
✓ Hoover’s (www.hoovers.com)
 
✓ Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com)
 
✓ The Wall Street Journal (www.wsj.com)
The preceding sources generally give you in-depth information about the 
major industries. Visit their Web sites to read their current research and 
articles along with links to relevant sites for more details. For example, 
The Wall Street Journal (published by Dow Jones & Co.), whose Web site is 
updated daily, publishes indexes for all the major sectors and industries so 
that you can get a useful snapshot of how well an industry is doing, including 
information about whether a stock is up or down and how it’s performing 
year-to-date.
 
Standard and Poor’s (S&P) Industry Survey is an especially excellent source of 
information on U.S. industries. Besides ranking and comparing industries and 
informing you about their current prospects, the survey also lists the top 
companies by size, sales, earnings, and other key information. What I like is 
that each industry is covered in a few pages, so you get the critical informa-
tion you need without reading a novel. The survey and other S&P publications 
are available on the S&P Web site or in the business reference section of most 
libraries (your best bet is to head for the library because the survey is rather 
expensive).

183
 Chapter 13: Analyzing Industries
Are the industry’s products 
or services in demand?
Look at the products and services that an industry provides. Do they look 
like things that society will continue to want? Are there products and ser-
vices on the horizon that could replace them? Does the industry face a 
danger of potential obsolescence?
 
When evaluating future demand, look for a sunrise industry — one that’s 
new or emerging or has promising appeal for the future. Good examples of 
sunrise industries in recent years are biotech and Internet companies. In 
contrast, a sunset industry is one that’s either declining or has little potential 
for growth. For example, you probably shouldn’t invest in the videocassette 
manufacturing industry as demand for DVDs increases. Owning stock in a 
strong, profitable company in a sunrise industry is obviously the most 
desirable choice.
Current research unveils the following megatrends:
 
✓ The aging of the U.S.: More senior citizens than ever before will be 
living in the U.S. Because of this fact, financial and healthcare services 
will prosper.
 
✓ Advances in high technology: Internet, telecom, medical, and biotech-
nology innovations will continue.
 
✓ Increasing need for basic materials: As society advances here and in 
the rest of the world, building blocks such as metals and other precious 
commodities will be in demand.
 
✓ Security concerns: Terrorism and other international tensions mean 
more attention for national defense, homeland security, and related 
matters.
 
✓ Energy challenges: Traditional and nontraditional sources of energy 
(such as solar, fuel cells, and so on) will demand society’s attention as it 
faces Peak Oil (shrinking supplies of the world’s available cheap crude 
oil; see Chapter 14 for details).
What does the industry’s growth rely on?
An industry doesn’t exist in a vacuum. External factors weigh heavily on its 
ability to survive and thrive. Does the industry rely on an established mega-
trend? Then it will probably be strong for a while. Does it rely on factors that 

184
Part III: Picking Winners 
are losing relevance? Then it may begin to decline soon. Technological and 
demographic changes are other factors that may contribute to an industry’s 
growth or fall.
Perhaps the industry offers great new medical products for senior citizens. 
What are the prospects for growth? The graying of the U.S. is an established 
megatrend. As millions of Americans climb past age 50, profitable opportuni-
ties await companies that are prepared to cater to them.
Is the industry dependent 
on another industry?
 
This twist on the prior question is a reminder that industries frequently are 
intertwined and can become codependent. When one industry suffers, 
you may find it helpful to understand which industries will subsequently 
suffer. The reverse can also be true — when one industry is doing well, other 
industries may reap the benefits.
In either case, if the stock you choose is in an industry that’s highly depen-
dent on other industries, you should know about it. If you’re considering 
stocks of resort companies and you see the headlines blaring, “Airlines losing 
money as public stops flying,” what do you do? This type of question forces 
you to think logically and consider cause and effect. Logic and common 
sense are powerful tools that frequently trump all the number-crunching 
activity performed by analysts.
Who are the leading companies 
in the industry?
After you’ve chosen the industry, what types of companies do you want to 
invest in? You can choose from two basic types:
 
✓ Established leaders: These companies are considered industry leaders 
or have a large share of the market. Investing in these companies is the 
safer way to go; what better choice for novice investors than companies 
that have already proven themselves?
 
✓ Innovators: If the industry is hot and you want to be more aggressive 
in your approach, investigate companies that offer new products, 
patents, or technologies. These companies are probably smaller but 
have a greater potential for growth in a proven industry.

185
 Chapter 13: Analyzing Industries
Is the industry a target 
of government action?
You need to know if the government is targeting an industry, because inter-
vention by politicians and bureaucrats (rightly or wrongly) can have an 
impact on an industry’s economic situation. For example, would you invest in 
a tobacco company now that the government has issued all its regulations 
and warnings?
 
Investors need to take heed when political “noise” starts coming out about a 
particular industry. An industry can be hurt either by direct government inter-
vention or by the threat of it. Intervention can take the form of lawsuits, inves-
tigations, taxes, regulations, or sometimes an outright ban. In any case, being 
on the wrong end of government intervention is the greatest external threat to 
a company’s survival.
 
Sometimes, government action helps an industry. Generally, beneficial action 
takes two forms:
 
✓ Deregulation and/or tax decreases: Government sometimes reduces 
burdens on an industry. In 1979, the federal government deregulated 
the airlines, an action that caused a boom in travel. The airline industry 
subsequently experienced tremendous growth because more people 
flew than ever before. This increase in the number of airline passengers 
spurred growth for the lodging and resort industries. Likewise, telecom 
deregulation in the mid-1990s helped that industry to boom.
 
✓ Direct funding: Government has the power to steer taxpayer money 
toward business as well. In recent years, federal and state governments 
have provided tax credits and other incentives for alternative energy 
such as solar power.

Not all industries go up and down in tandem. Indeed, at any given time, some 
industry is successful no matter what’s happening with the general economy. 
In fact, investors have made a lot of money simply by choosing an industry 
that benefits from economic trends.
For example, the economy was in bad shape during the 1970s. It was a period 
of stagflation — low growth, high unemployment, and high inflation. This 
decade was the worst time for the economy since the Great Depression; 

186
Part III: Picking Winners 
most industries (and therefore most stocks) were having tough times. But 
some industries did well — in fact, some flourished. Real estate and precious 
metals, for example, performed well in this environment. Because the infla-
tion rate soared into double digits, inflationary hedges such as gold and 
silver did very well. During the ’70s, gold skyrocketed from $35 an ounce to 
$850 an ounce over the course of the decade. Silver went from under $2 to 
over $50 in the same period. What do you think happened to stocks of gold 
and silver mining companies? That’s right — they skyrocketed as well. Gold 
stocks gave investors spectacular returns.
In the 1980s, the economy was rejuvenated when taxes were cut, regulations 
were decreased, and inflation fell. Most industries did well, but even in a 
growing economy, some industries struggle. Examples of industries that 
struggled during that time include precious metals and energy stocks.
Now fast forward to 2008. Think about the industries that have recently 
struggled and those that have performed well during the past few years. 
Stocks involved in energy, agriculture, and general commodities have done 
very well. In the same time frame, industries like airlines, housing, and finan-
cials (such as banks and brokerage firms) have had a rough time. Choosing 
the right industries (or avoiding the wrong ones) has always been a major 
factor in successful stock picking.
In the following sections, I list some of the largest industries you can invest 
in and provide tips on how to tell when they’re doing well . . . and not so well. 
(To research these industries, use the resources mentioned earlier in this 
chapter, as well as those listed in Appendix A.)
Moving in: Real estate
I include real estate as a key industry because it’s a cyclical bellwether 
industry — one that has a great effect on many other industries that may be 
dependent on it. Real estate is looked at as a key component of economic 
health because so many other industries — including building materials, 
mortgages, household appliances, and contract labor services — are tied to 
it. A booming real estate industry bodes well for much of the economy.
Housing starts are one way to measure real estate activity. This data is an 
important leading indicator of health in the industry. Housing starts indicate 
new construction, which means more business for related industries.
 
Keep an eye on the real estate industry for negative news that could be 
bearish for the economy and the stock market. Because real estate is pur-
chased with mortgage money, investors and analysts watch the mortgage 
market for trouble signs such as rising delinquencies and foreclosures. 
These statistics serve as a warning for general economic weakness.

187
 Chapter 13: Analyzing Industries
In recent years, the real estate mania hit its zenith during 2005–2006. A mania 
is typically the final (and craziest) part of a mature bull market. In a mania, 
the prices of the assets experiencing the bull market (such as stock or real 
estate) skyrocket to extreme levels, which excites more and more investors 
to jump in, causing prices to rise even further. It gets to the point where 
seemingly everyone thinks that it’s easy to get rich by buying this particular 
asset, and almost no one notices that the market has become unsustainable. 
After prices are exhausted and start to level off, investor excitement dies 
down, and then investors try to exit by selling their holdings to realize some 
profit. As more and more sell off their holdings, demand decreases while 
supply increases. The mania dissipates and the bear market appears. This is 
definitely what happened to real estate in 2007–2008, when the industry fell 
on hard times as the housing bubble popped.
Driving it home: Automotive
Cars are big-ticket items and are another barometer of people’s economic 
well-being — people buy new cars when they’re doing well financially. 
When sales of cars are up, it’s usually a positive indicator for the economy.
Conversely, trouble in the auto industry is a red flag for trouble in the general 
economy. For instance, an increase in auto repossessions and car loan 
delinquencies translates to a warning about general economic weakness. 
During 2007–2008, some major difficulty definitely showed up in the auto 
industry as GM and Ford experienced financial troubles. When the auto 
industry struggles, other industries tied to it also struggle. These include 
consumer credit and numerous manufacturing subcategories that cater to 
the auto industry (such as base metals and electrical components).
Talking tech: Computers 
and related electronics
In recent years, technology stocks have become very popular with investors. 
Indeed, technology is a great sector, and its impact on the economy’s present 
and future success can’t be underestimated. The share price of technology 
companies can rise substantially because investors buy shares based on 
expectations — today’s untested, unproven companies may become the 
Googles and Apples of tomorrow.
 
In spite of the sector’s potential, companies can still fail if customers don’t 
embrace their products. Even in technology stocks, you still must apply the 
rules and guidelines about financially successful companies that I discuss 
throughout this book. Pick the best in a growing industry and you’ll succeed 

188
Part III: Picking Winners 
over the long haul. But because technology still hasn’t recovered from its 
recent bear market, weakness in the industry means that investors need to be 
very picky and cautious.
Banking on it: Financials
Banking and financial services are an intrinsic part of any economy. Debt is 
the most telling sign of this industry for investors. If a company’s debt is 
growing faster than the economy, you need to watch how that debt impacts 
stocks and mutual funds. If debt gets out of control, it can be disastrous 
for the economy. As credit specialist Doug Noland points out (you can 
find his column at www.prudentbear.com), the amount of debt and debt-
related securities recently reached historic and troublesome levels. This 
trend means that many financial stocks are at risk if a recession hits anytime 
soon. As this book goes to press, financial stocks have experienced a tough 
market as debt and defaults on debt (like subprime debt) have become head-
line news. Because this is a multitrillion-dollar issue and it weighs heavily 
across the economic landscape, problems will persist well into the future, 
and investors should avoid this sector or be very wary and selective.

I
’m thrilled to include this chapter again in this 3rd edition of Stock 
Investing For Dummies. Had you read this chapter in the previous edition 
and acted accordingly, you could have made a fortune (I kid you not). So I 
think that it earns an encore. A lot of this book is about making your own 
decisions and doing your own research, but what the heck — if I can save 
you some time and effort, why not? You can thank me later. Anyway, it’s time 
to make you privy to what my research tells me are unfolding megatrends 
that offer the greatest potential rewards (or risks) for stock investors.
Only a handful of changes in your portfolio over the past four decades would 
have made you tremendously rich. Had you put your money into natural 
resources (such as gold, silver, and oil) at the beginning of the 1970s and 
stayed put until the end of the decade, you would have made a fortune. Then, 
had you cashed in and switched to Japanese stocks in 1980 and held them for 
the rest of the decade, you would have made another fortune. Then, had you 
switched in 1990 to U.S. stocks for the entire decade, you would have made 
yet another fortune. What if you had cashed in your stocks in 2000? Well, for 
starters, you would have avoided huge losses in the down bear market. How 
about being bullish? What looks like a strong bull market for this decade?
By and large, this decade seems to be a repeat of the ’70s. The general realm 
of natural resources looks to be the primary bull market for this decade. 
Why? First, look at what this decade has in common with the ’70s:
 
✓ Problems with energy (rising costs, supply disruptions, and so on)
 
✓ Rising inflation (as the dollar and other currencies are increased in 
supply)

190
Part III: Picking Winners 
 
✓ International conflict (Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, and so on)
 
✓ Sluggish or recessionary domestic economy
 
✓ Rising prices for natural resources (grains, metals, energy, lumber, 
and so on)
However, this decade has more to consider, including the following:
 
✓ Debt, debt, and more debt ($49 trillion as of September 2008, and three 
and a half times the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) total of $14 tril-
lion). The U.S. is now the world’s largest debtor nation.
 
✓ The U.S. as a major importer (versus being an exporter in the ’70s)
 
✓ China, Russia, Brazil, and India as major economic competitors (and 
consumers of resources)
 
✓ The threat of terrorism affecting the U.S. within its borders
 
✓ $600 + trillion worth of derivatives (20 times larger than the world’s total 
GDP)! Many of these derivatives, which are complicated investment 
vehicles, are arcane and ultra-risky.
 
✓ Social Security and Medicare liabilities that are now projected to exceed 
$90 trillion (rising costs started in 2008 as the oldest baby boomers 
started to retire at age 62, and they’ll escalate in 2011 and beyond as 
many turn 65).
This list isn’t comprehensive (due to space limitations). The preceding 
points are enough to make you understand that this investing environment 
has changed dramatically, and you need to refocus your overall game plan 
to keep your money growing. It also makes you want to race off to Gilligan’s 
island!
You’ll see two types of opportunities in this chapter: bullish and bearish. I 
think that you would also benefit from reading Chapter 13 on industries as 
well. If I can’t help you find the winning stocks, then by golly I can at least 
show you what potential problem areas to stay away from.
Bullish Opportunities
Being bullish (or going “long”) is the natural inclination for most investors. 
It’s an easy concept — buy low, sell high. No rocket science there. The follow-
ing sections don’t identify every bullish opportunity, but they do cover the 
most obvious ones (at least to me).

191
 Chapter 14: Emerging Sector Opportunities
 
In the examples in the following sections, I reference time frames of several 
years. Why? You would have seen these stocks dip by 10 or 20 percent or 
more over a given short time frame such as a few weeks or a few months. But 
investing wisely means that time ultimately will get the stock price to higher 
ground, especially if you ride the megatrends.
 
As you research this area for places to help your investments grow, let me just 
mention two words that should guide you along the way: human need. As long 
as most (or even all) of your portfolio is geared toward those goods and ser-
vices that the public will need no matter how good or bad the economy is, you 
should do well in the long run. Remember, not want, but need — it’s a safer 
bet in the coming years.
Commodities
Two countries that figure to have a mega-impact on the world in the near 
future are China and India. In the past ten years, these countries have put 
their economies on the fast track. Consider the following:
 
✓ They’ve generally turned away from socialism and a command economy 
and have turned to a free market or more capitalistic system.
 
✓ Industrialization, privatization, and profit incentives have ignited tre-
mendous booms in these countries.
 
✓ Both nations’ populations have continued to grow, with nearly 3 billion 
people combined.
What do these facts mean for stock investors? Somebody has to sell them 
what they need. China, for example, has a voracious appetite for natu-
ral resources like building materials, energy, copper, grain, and so on. 
Companies that have provided these needed goods and services do very 
well. Take, for example, Bunge Limited (BG). You could have bought BG in 
late 2005 for about $39 per share. As of September 2008, BG hit $70 for a nice 
gain of 79 percent (not including dividends). In that same time frame, the S&P 
500 was only up by about 3 percent (basically flat for three years).
Another great example is Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. (RS). It provides 
the building blocks of infrastructure that society needs for bridges and other 
structures. This steel stock was a real steal at about $18 per share in late 
2005. In September 2008, it was at $47 for a total gain of over 160 percent, 
while the S&P 500 floundered in the same time frame. Though many (most?) 
investors saw their portfolios go up a little, down a little, or flatline, resource 
investors saw their stocks do very well.

192
Part III: Picking Winners 
Of course, China and India are only a part of the world’s emerging markets, 
but they’re certainly the most important to Americans (in terms of economic 
impact). They are indeed megatrends that will either help (or hurt) your 
portfolio. In the coming years, demand will likely continue to be strong, and 
investors will see the obvious positive implications for solid companies that 
meet this demand.
 
To find out more, check out the resources in Appendix A, such as Jim Rogers’s 
book entitled Hot Commodities. You can also conduct research at sites such as 
www.futuresource.com, the commodities section of www.marketwatch.
com, and www.bloomberg.com.
Oil and gas
As I write this, triple-digit prices for oil and $4-per-gallon gas have become 
startling realities. Recent headlines tell me that the costs of energy are a 
major challenge for the economy. For decades, U.S. society has benefited 
from cheap oil, but global supply and demand (among other things) have 
caught up with us. A barrel of oil has gone from $67 in August 2005 to $116 
only three years later (an increase of 74 percent). Gasoline has experienced 
a similar rise, and Peak Oil is much in the news (for more on this condition, 
check out the nearby sidebar, “Taking a peek at Peak Oil”). Energy investors 
must become familiar with Peak Oil because it has weighed, and will continue 
to weigh, very heavily on the economy because people are so dependent on 
oil for their modern lifestyle. Higher energy prices are here to stay. If you’re 
going to pay more for energy, you may as well benefit.
As energy prices have risen strongly over the past few years, how have 
stocks fared? The general stock market (as represented by the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index) didn’t do much from 2005 to 
mid-2008. How about energy stocks? For an example, look at Schlumberger 
Limited (SLB), a major oil drilling and services firm whose fortunes are 
certainly tied to the energy market. Here’s a company that you could have 
bought in late 2005 for about $30 per share. How has SLB fared during this 
time frame? Despite pulling back from a high of $115 in 2007, its stock is at 
$88 as of September 2008 for a solid gain of 167 percent.
The bottom line is that stock investors will either have to consider energy in 
their investment strategies or risk having energy prices steamroll over their 
potential gains. Investment opportunities are plentiful in companies that pro-
vide, sell, distribute, or explore energy. But you may want to consider energy 
alternatives as well. The U.S. and the rest of the world will be forced to turn 
to alternative energy sources in the coming years. As conventional oil and 
gas become scarce, the U.S. will look into gaining energy from sources such 
as wind, solar, fuel cell technologies, and Canada’s oil sands, among others. 
(See the next section for more about alternative energy.)

193
 Chapter 14: Emerging Sector Opportunities
 
As you read this chapter, you may not be sure about what particular company 
you should invest in. If that’s the case, why not consider a convenient way to 
invest in an entire industry or sector? A good consideration is an exchange-
traded fund (ETF). Buying an ETF is like buying a whole portfolio of stocks as 
if it were a single stock. An example is an ETF with the symbol XLE. XLE has a 
cross section of the largest public oil and gas companies such as Exxon Mobil, 
Chevron, and others. In 2003, I bought XLE for $18 per share. By September 
2008, it hit $70. To find out more about ETFs, go to the American Stock 
Exchange (www.amex.com) for all the details.
Alternative energy
Because a traditional energy source like oil has its supply issues (oil’s days 
are numbered), it makes sense to anticipate what’s next on the horizon that 
can logically fulfill America’s energy needs. These changes must happen, 
and stock investors should benefit from what will be a historic shift into 
alternative energy. Alternative energy includes (but isn’t limited to) nuclear 
energy, solar, wind, fuel cell, geothermal, and ocean currents. You can find 
many stocks and ETFs now that are among the myriad choices for investors 
to gain exposure in a sector that will become more and more prominent in 
the coming months and years. Check out Appendix A for general resources to 
help you research this great sector.
Taking a peek at Peak Oil
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, geologist 
Marion King Hubbert conducted landmark 
studies related to the global supply of oil. His 
research indicated that the life of a particular 
underground reserve of oil goes through two 
phases. During the first phase, the oil can be 
easily and inexpensively extracted. However, 
after you get past the 50 percent mark, the 
remaining oil is very difficult (and hence very 
expensive) to extract. That 50 percent mark has 
come to be known as “Hubbert’s Peak,” and 
experts have come to call this condition Peak 
Oil. Hubbert correctly made forecasts of when 
the major oil-producing countries of the world 
would hit this peak. So far the forecasts have 
been accurate. The U.S. hit Hubbert’s Peak in 
the early 1970s (American dependence on for-
eign oil grew significantly after that). Current 
industry research suggests that world produc-
tion hit its peak in 2005. In August 2008, the 
top 100 largest oil fields in the world entered 
a period of declining production. To find out 
more about Peak Oil, check out Web sites 
such as the Association for the Study of Peak 
Oil & Gas (www.aspo-usa.com) and www.

Gold and other precious metals
Over the ages, gold has come to be synonymous with wealth. In modern 
times, gold has become known as an inflation hedge and investment insur-
ance, especially during times of inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. After 
being in a 20-year bear market (from its high of $850 in 1980 to its low of $252 
in 2000), gold is in a powerful bull market. Aggressive investors should be 
investigating gold stocks and ETFs. Why now?
According to many (if not most) gold market analysts such as Bill Murphy 
of the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee (www.gata.org), as well as sites 
that specialize in the gold market like www.lemetropolecafe.com, www.
gold-eagle.com, and www.kitco.com, the fundamentals for gold are 
more bullish than ever. In recent years, demand has begun to significantly 
exceed supply. The shortfall has been filled from gold sales by central banks. 
Because of continued and growing demand both in the U.S. and abroad 
(most notably Russia, India, and China), total worldwide annual demand is 
outstripping supply by anywhere from 1000–2000 tons (depending on whose 
estimates you believe). Juxtapose this demand with current economic condi-
tions (such as the declining value of the dollar and other paper currencies) 
and geopolitical instability, and you can see that gold and gold-related invest-
ments (such as quality gold stocks and ETFs) show bullish potential.
Because gold does well in an inflationary environment, understanding infla-
tion itself is important. Inflation isn’t the price of things going up; it’s the value 
of the currency going down. The reason it goes down in value is primarily 
because the government can print money at will (the money supply). When 
you significantly increase the money supply, you create a bullish environment 
for hard assets such as gold. (For more about inflation, see Chapter 10.)
Gold analysts such as Bill Murphy, Doug Casey, Jay Taylor, James Sinclair, 
and many others accurately forecast that the price of gold would hit four 
figures (it did in March 2008) and that the current environment sees gold 
zigzagging to new highs in the coming years. If that’s the case, gold mining 
stocks and ETFs will perform fantastically well (not unlike their heyday in 
the late 1970s). For conservative investors, consider the large, established 
mining firms such as Newmont Mining (NEM), Gold Corp. (GG), and Agnico-
Eagle (AEM). For the more daring, consider junior mining stocks. Do your 
research using the Web sites mentioned in this section.
 
As an additional note, the general precious metals market is strong and is a 
good consideration for solid gains because of the current inflationary environ-
ment. I think that silver and even uranium (for energy) offer investors good 
opportunities. To find out more, check out my book Precious Metals Investing 
For Dummies (published by Wiley).

 Chapter 14: Emerging Sector Opportunities
Healthcare
I’m sure you’ve heard much about the “graying of America.” This phrase 
obviously represents a firm megatrend in place. For stock investors, this 
megatrend is a purely demographic play, and the numbers are with them. 
The number of people over the age of 50, and especially those considered 
senior citizens, represents the fastest growing segment of American soci-
ety. The same megatrend is in place in all corners of the world (especially 
Europe). As more and more people move into this category, the idea that 
companies that serve this segment will also prosper becomes a no-brainer. 
Well-managed companies that run nursing homes and eldercare services will 
see their stocks rise.
 
Be careful about which healthcare firms you select because this sector 
includes stocks that are defensive and also some that are cyclical. Companies 
that sell expensive equipment (such as CAT scans or MRI technology) may 
not do that well in an economic downturn because hospitals and other health-
care facilities may not want to upgrade or replace their equipment. Therefore, 
healthcare companies that sell big-ticket items can be considered cyclical. On 
the other hand, businesses that sell necessary items like medicine and ban-
dages (such as pharmaceuticals and drug retailers) can be considered defen-
sive. People who need medicine (such as aspirin or antacids) will buy it no 
matter how bad the economy is. In fact, people will probably buy even more 
aspirin and antacids in bad economic times.
 
Also be wary of political trends as they affect healthcare. The U.S. may be 
slowly lurching toward socialized medicine. If this possibility develops, turn 
your bullish expectations into bearish ones. History (and my experience) tells 
me that a government takeover of an industry like healthcare spells danger for 
investors (and patients, too).
 
To find out more about healthcare opportunities, check out the industry and 
main stocks by using the resources in Appendix A.
Defending the nation
The horrific events of September 11, 2001, remind the world how vulnerable 
America is as a free and open society. It has been a brave new world ever 
since. Americans watch their TV screens and listen to their radios to discover 
that terrorism’s wretched tentacles reach across the globe. The most obvious 
way the country can respond is to increase security at home while deploying 
forces across the world to combat terrorists and tangle with the countries 
that support them. Foes of the U.S. aren’t singular nations that are easily 
defined, fought, and defeated within a few months or a few years. Instead, 
they’re implacable and virulent, and they’re spread out over many countries.

196
Part III: Picking Winners 
In addition to terrorism, geopolitical developments pose potential problems 
for the U.S. Russia, China, and Iran are among the hot spots that will continue 
to challenge Americans economically as well as militarily.
 
As the U.S. continues to retool its military and seek ways to monitor, track, 
and attack terrorists, defense companies that sell certain products and ser-
vices will benefit. For publications that do a great job informing investors and 
speculators regarding the war economy, check out the U.S. & World Early 
Warning Report (www.chaostan.com).
A Bearish Outlook
Stocks are versatile in that you can even make money when they go down 
in value. Techniques range from using put options to going short, or doing a 
short sale of stock. (See Chapter 18 regarding going short, and find out more 
about put options at www.cboe.com.) For traditional investors, the more 
appropriate strategy is first and foremost to avoid or minimize losses. Making 
money betting that a stock will fall is closer to speculating than actual invest-
ing. So all I want is that investors see the pitfalls and act accordingly. The fol-
lowing sections offer cautionary alerts to keep you away from troubled areas 
in the economy (or find speculative opportunities to short stocks).
 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) hit a high of 11,722 in January 2000 
and, after seven roller-coaster years, hit an all-time high of 14,164.53 on 
October 9, 2007. (As I write this, the DJIA is about 8,400.) As you can see, the 
general market since January 2000 has been mediocre. Although some stock 
groups have grown quite well, stocks in general have struggled, and some 
sectors have done rather poorly. Choosing the right sector is critical for your 
stock investing success.
Avoiding consumer discretionary sectors
 
When the economy is struggling or contracting and people are concerned 
about their financial situation, some sectors will undoubtedly suffer. If you 
have money tied up in stocks attached to companies in these sectors, you 
may suffer as well. In today’s economic environment, I would generally avoid 
sectors such as “consumer discretionary,” which refers to companies that sell 
products or services that people may want but usually don’t need. In other 
words, when consumers (both individuals and organizations) have to make 
hard choices on tighter budgets, the first areas of spending that will logically 
shrink are those goods and services that simply aren’t that necessary in peo-
ple’s daily lives.

197
 Chapter 14: Emerging Sector Opportunities
Here’s an example: In trying times, those who typically eat at fancy, expensive 
restaurants will cut back. Maybe they’ll eat at fast food places or simply opt for 
good ol’ home cooking. Multiply this choice by millions of consumers and you 
see that high-end restaurants (and their stocks, if they’re public companies) 
will see their fortunes sink. Your logic and common sense are very useful here.
A warning on real estate
 
In the second edition of this book, I warned you to stay away from housing 
because it became an enormous (and dangerous) bubble during 2002–2006. 
It has since sunk into its own depression. Although buying opportunities are 
plenty and sellers are having a difficult time, my warning on housing and the 
general real estate market (of course, all stocks associated with this sector) is 
still on. Be very cautious here and wait for a rebound. “But Paul,” you may ask, 
“isn’t the worst over? Isn’t 2009 the bottom?” Possibly, but just understand 
that more credit problems still hang over the market.
Some recent industry data indicates that during 2007, one out of every seven 
homes purchased was underwater as of mid-2008. In other words, one out of 
every seven homeowners has a mortgage more valuable than the property 
purchased! Yikes! That means that some homebuyer out there has, say, a 
$250,000 mortgage on a property that has seen its market price decline to 
less than $250,000. How many homeowners will keep paying a mortgage 
that’s worth more than the property itself, especially if times are tough and 
people are struggling or have lost a job?
In addition, think about mortgage resets. What does that mean? During the 
middle of this decade (2004–2007), many people purchased property with 
adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). These ARMs typically had an introductory 
period with a fixed monthly payment during the first few years (usually two 
to five years) and then were adjusted afterward. Many folks got into ARMs 
with the expectation that real estate would continue rising and that they’d 
be able to handle the new (higher) monthly payments later, or perhaps move 
out before the fixed introductory period ended. These ARMs became ticking 
time bombs. Many of them hit homeowners and forced sales, which made real 
estate prices drop as sales outnumbered purchases and the national inventory 
of available homes for sale ballooned to record levels. The ARMs aren’t fin-
ished being adjusted, as many more are due to be adjusted during 2009–2011.
 
You can see that the real estate industry, with the ARMs issues and record 
levels of defaults and foreclosures, will need more time to heal and get back 
on a growth path. For stock investors, the point is obvious. Stocks related to 
real estate such as homebuilders, property developers, construction firms, 
and mortgage companies are too speculative at this point. Wait until the 
coast is clear.

The great credit monster
Too much debt means that someone will get hurt. The unprecedented explo-
sion in debt may have given the economy a huge boost in the late 1990s, 
but debt now poses great dangers for the rest of this decade. This massive 
debt problem is obviously tied to real estate. However, it goes much further. 
Individuals, companies, and government agencies are carrying too much debt 
for comfort. It’s not just mortgage debt; it’s also consumer, business, govern-
ment, and margin debt. With total debt now in the vicinity of more than $45 
trillion, saying that a lot of this debt won’t be repaid is probably a safe bet. 
Individual and institutional defaults will rock the economy and the financial 
markets. Bankruptcy is (and will continue to be) a huge issue (in spite of 
bankruptcy reforms that became law on October 17, 2005).
Debt will (and does) weigh heavily on stocks, either directly or indirectly. 
Because every type of debt is now at record levels, no one is truly immune. 
Say you have a retail stock of a company that has no debt whatsoever. Are 
you immune? Not really, because consumer debt (credit cards, personal 
loans, and so on) is at an all-time high. If consumer spending declines, the 
retailer’s sales go down, its profits shrink, and ultimately, its stock goes down.
Exposure to debt is quite pervasive. Check your 401(k) plan, your bond 
funds, and your insurance company’s annuity. Why? Remember those mort-
gages I talk about earlier in this chapter? Banks and mortgage companies 
issued trillions of dollars’ worth of those mortgages in recent years, but after 
the mortgages were issued, they were sold to other financial institutions. A 
huge number of mortgages were sold to the most obvious buyers, the Federal 
National Mortgage Association (FNM) and the Federal Mortgage Assurance 
Corporation (FRE). These giant, government-sponsored entities are usually 
referred to as “Fannie Mae” and “Freddie Mac.” They were taken over in 
2008 by the federal government because of gross mismanagement and over-
indebtedness (in the trillions!). Hmm . . . there goes that alarmist robot with 
the flailing arms again.
 
What’s a stock investor to do?
 
✓ Well, remember that first commandment to avoid or minimize losses? 
Make sure that you review your portfolio and sell stocks that may get 
pulverized by the credit monster. That includes many banks and broker-
age firms.

 Chapter 14: Emerging Sector Opportunities
 
✓ Make sure that the companies themselves have no debt, low debt, or at 
least manageable debt. (Check their financial reports; see Chapter 12 for 
more details.)
 
✓ For the venturesome, seek shorting opportunities in those companies 
most exposed to the dangers of debt. (For more information on shorting, 
go to Chapter 18.)
Cyclical stocks
Another type of stock that I think you should be cautious about is cyclical 
stocks. Heavy equipment, automobiles, and technology tend to be cyclical 
and are very susceptible to downturns in the general economy. Conversely, 
cyclical stocks do very well when the economy is growing or on an upswing 
(hence the label).
As individuals and corporations get squeezed with more debt and less dis-
posable income, hard choices need to be made. Ultimately, the result is that 
people buy fewer big-ticket items. That means that a company selling those 
items ends up selling less and earning less profit. This loss of profit, in turn, 
makes that company’s stock go down.
Firms that experience lagging sales often turn to aggressive discounting. 
Recently, General Motors Corporation (GM) and Ford Motor Company (F) 
offered employee discount sales to the public. Both companies have been 
experiencing plunging sales and profits and ballooning debt in recent years. 
Subsequently, both companies have seen their stocks plummet to single digit 
levels in 2008.
In a struggling, recessionary economy, investing in cyclical stocks is like 
sunbathing on an anthill and using jam instead of sunblock — not a pretty 
picture.
Important Considerations 
for Bulls and Bears
I don’t presume that stocks go straight up or that they zigzag upward indefi-
nitely. Your due diligence is necessary for your success. Make sure that 
you’re investing appropriately for your situation. If you’re 35, heading into 
your peak earnings years, want to ride a home-run stock, and you understand 
the risks, then go ahead and speculate with that small cap gold mining stock 
or the solar power technology junior stock.

200
Part III: Picking Winners 
But if you’re more risk averse or your situation is screaming out loud for you 
to be conservative, then don’t speculate. Go instead with a more diversified 
portfolio of large cap stocks or get the ETF for that particular sector. And 
don’t forget the trailing stop loss strategy (see Chapter 18). ’Nuff said.
For those people who want to make money by going short in those sectors 
that look bearish, again take a deep breath and remember what’s appropri-
ate. Conservative investors simply avoid the risky areas. Aggressive inves-
tors or speculators may want to deploy profitable bearish strategies (with a 
portion of their investable funds). Here are some highlights for all of you.
Conservative and bullish
Being conservative and bullish is proper when you’re in (or near) retirement, 
have a family to support, or live in a very large shoe with so many kids that 
you don’t know what to do. After you choose a promising sector, just select 
large cap companies that are financially strong, are earning a profit, have low 
debt, and are market leaders. This entire book shows you how to do just that.
 
However, you may not like the idea of buying stocks directly. In that case, 
consider either sector mutual funds or ETFs. That way you can choose the 
industry and effectively buy a basket of the top stocks in that area. ETFs have 
been a hot item lately, and I think that they’re a great choice for most investors 
because they offer some advantages over mutual funds. For example, you can 
put stop-loss orders on them or borrow against them in your stock portfolio. 
Check with your financial advisor to see whether ETFs are appropriate for you.
Aggressive and bullish
If you’re aggressive and bullish, you want to buy stocks directly. For real 
growth potential, look at mid caps or small caps. Remember that you’re 
speculating, so you understand the downside risk but are willing to tolerate 
it because the upside potential can reward you so handsomely. Few things in 
the investment world give you a better gain than a supercharged stock in a 
hot sector.

201
 Chapter 14: Emerging Sector Opportunities
Conservative and bearish
 
For many (if not most) investors, making money on a falling market isn’t gen-
erally a good idea. Doing so takes a lot of expertise and risk tolerance. Really, 
for conservative investors, the key word is safety. Analyze your portfolio with 
an advisor you trust and sell the potentially troubled stocks. If you’re not 
sure what to do on a particular stock, then (at the very least) put in stop-loss 
orders and make them GTC (good-till-canceled). (See Chapter 18 for details.) 
As odd as it sounds, sometimes losing less than others makes you come out 
ahead if you play it right.
For example, look at the bear market that hit the U.S. in the mid-1970s. In 
1974–1975, the stock market fell 45 percent. Stocks didn’t recover until 
1982. If you had a stock that was at $100, it would have fallen to $55 and not 
returned to $100 until seven or eight years later. Whew! Sometimes just bury-
ing your money in the backyard sounds like genius. What if you had a stop 
loss at $90? You would have gotten out with a minimal loss and could have 
reinvested the money elsewhere (such as in bonds or CDs) and looked much 
brighter than your neighbor feverishly digging for money in his backyard.
Aggressive and bearish
Being aggressive in a bearish market isn’t for the faint of heart. However, this 
is where the quickest fortunes have been made by some of history’s greatest 
investors. Going short can make you great money when the market is bear-
ish, but it can sink you if you’re wrong. I usually don’t tell my clients and stu-
dents to short a stock because it can backfire. Yes, ways to go short with less 
risk are out there, but I prefer to buy put options.
 
Put options are a way to make money with limited risk when you essentially 
make a bet that an investment (such as stocks) will go down. Obviously, 
options go beyond the scope of this book, but at least let me give you some 
direction, because there’s an appropriate options strategy for most stock port-
folios. You can find great (free) tutorials on using options at Web sites such 
as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com) and the Options 
Industry Council (www.888options.com).

In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the effects of politics and government on stocks
▶ Checking out a few handy political resources
P
olitics can be infuriating, disruptive, meddlesome, corrupting, and 
harmful. Don’t let that fool you — it does have its bad side, too! Even if 
politics doesn’t amuse or interest you, you can’t ignore it. If you aren’t care-
ful, it can wreak great havoc on your portfolio. Politics wields great influence 
on the economic and social environment, which in turn affects how compa-
nies succeed or fail. This success or failure in turn either helps or hurts your 
stock’s price. Politics (manifested in taxes, regulations, price controls, capital 
controls, and other government actions) can make or break a company or 
industry quicker than any other external force.
 
What people must understand (especially government policy makers) is that 
a new tax, law, regulation, or government action has a macro effect on a stock, 
an industry, or even an entire economic system, whereas a company has a 
micro effect on an economy. The following gives you a simple snapshot of 
these effects:
Politics → policy → economy → industry → the company → the stock → 
stock investor
Now, this chapter doesn’t moralize about politics or advocate a political 
point of view; after all, this book is about stock investing. In general, poli-
cies can be good or bad regardless of their effect on the economy — some 
policies are enacted to achieve greater purposes even if they kick you in the 
wallet. However, in the context of this chapter, politics is covered from a 
cause-and-effect perspective: How does politics affect prosperity in general 
and stock investing in particular?

204
Part III: Picking Winners 
 
A proficient stock investor can’t — must not — look at stocks as though they 
exist in a vacuum. My favorite example of this rule is the idea of fish in a lake. 
You can have a great fish (your stock) among a whole school of fish (the stock 
market) in a wonderful lake (the economy). But what if the lake gets polluted 
(bad policy)? What happens to the fish? Politics controls the lake and can 
make it hospitable — or dangerous — for the participants. You get the point. 
The example may sound too simple, yet it isn’t. So many people — political 
committees, corporate managers, bureaucrats, and politicians — still get this 
picture so wrong time and time again, to the detriment of the economy and 
stock investors. Heck, I don’t mind if they get it wrong with their money, but 
their actions make it tough for your money.
Although the two inexorably get intertwined, I do what I can to treat poli-
tics and economics as separate issues. Economics gets its own spotlight in 
Chapter 10.
Tying Together Politics and Stocks
The campaigns heat up. Democrats, Republicans, and smaller parties vie 
for your attention and subsequent votes. Conservatives, liberals, socialists, 
moderates, and libertarians joust in the battlefield of ideas. But after all is 
said and done, voters make their decisions. Election Day brings a new slate 
of politicians into office, and they in turn joust and debate on new rules and 
programs in the legislative halls of power. Before and after election time, 
investors must keep a watchful eye on the proceedings. In the following sec-
tions, I explain some basic political concepts that relate to stock investing.
Seeing the general effects of 
politics on stock investing
For stock investors, politics manifests itself as a major factor in investment-
making decisions in ways shown in Table 15-1.

205
 Chapter 15: Money, Mayhem, and Votes
Table 15-1 
Politics and Investing
Possible 
Legislation
Effect on Investing
Taxes
Will a new tax affect a particular stock (industry or economy)? 
Generally, more or higher taxes ultimately have a negative 
impact on stock investing. Income taxes and capital gains 
taxes are good examples.
Laws
Will Congress (or, in some instances, state legislatures) pass 
a law that will have a negative impact on a stock, the industry, 
or the economy? Price controls — laws that set the price of 
a product, service, or commodity — are examples of nega-
tive laws. I discuss price controls in more detail later in this 
chapter.
Regulations
Will a new (or existing) regulation have a negative (or positive) 
effect on the stock of your choice? Generally, more or tougher 
regulations have a negative impact on stocks.
Government 
spending 
and debt
If government agencies spend too much or misallocate 
resources, they may create greater burdens on society, which 
in turn will be bearish for the economy and the stock market.
Money supply
The U.S. money supply — the dollars you use — is controlled 
by the Federal Reserve. It’s basically a governmental agency 
that serves as America’s central bank. How can it affect 
stocks? Increasing or decreasing the money supply results in 
either an inflationary or a deflationary environment, which can 
help or hurt the economy, specific industries, and stock picks.
Interest rates
The Federal Reserve has crucial influence here. It can raise or 
lower key interest rates that in turn can have an effect on the 
entire economy and the stock market. When interest rates go 
up, it makes credit more expensive for companies. When inter-
est rates go down, companies can get cheaper credit, which 
can be better for profits.
Government 
bailouts
This is when the government intervenes directly in the mar-
ketplace and uses either tax money or borrowed money to bail 
out a troubled enterprise. This is generally a negative because 
funds are diverted by force from the healthier private economy 
to an ailing enterprise.

206
Part III: Picking Winners 
 
When many of the factors in Table 15-1 work in tandem, they can have a mag-
nified effect that can have tremendous consequences for your stock portfolio. 
Alert investors keep a constant vigil when the legislature is open for business, 
and they adjust their portfolios accordingly.
Ascertaining the political climate
 
The bottom line is that you ignore political realities at your own (economic) 
risk. To be and stay aware, ask yourself the following questions about the 
stock of each company in which you invest:
 
✓ What laws will directly affect my stock investment adversely?
 
✓ Will any laws affect the company’s industry?
 
✓ Will any current or prospective laws affect the company’s sources of 
revenue?
 
✓ Will any current or prospective laws affect the company’s expenses or 
supplies?
The seeds of financial disaster in the last decade
As I write this book, the financial headlines 
are blaring away about the trillion-dollar finan-
cial and credit catastrophes unfolding on Wall 
Street. Government-sponsored enterprises 
(GSEs) such as Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie 
Mac (FRE) have collapsed, and shareholders 
have been wiped out. Large financial entities 
such as AIG and Merrill Lynch have been rocked 
by multibillion-dollar losses. Politicians and pun-
dits give indignant speeches about the failures 
of capitalism. But what really happened?
Gang, I predicted this mess years ago in the 
2nd edition of Stock Investing For Dummies. 
Politically popular policies and regulations 
enacted by the federal government during the 
late 1990s and the early part of this decade laid 
the groundwork for today’s massive financial 
mess. The Federal Reserve in 2001 lowered 
interest rates to artificially low levels, removed 
lending standards (to boost home owner-
ship), greatly increased the money supply, 
and expanded credit on a massive scale. This 
fueled a historic mortgage boom that created 
the housing bubble. Trillions of mortgage money 
was loaned out, much of it to home buyers of 
very questionable credit quality. These sub-
prime mortgages were repackaged as bonds 
and sold to financial entities on Wall Street and 
across the globe. When the mortgages went 
bad, financial entities lost billions.
Now, politicians rail about what government 
should do, but what they don’t understand is 
that the root of the problem is what govern-
ment had done years before. The lesson is that 
political/government intervention can unleash 
unintended consequences that can destroy a 
company whose stock you own.

207
 Chapter 15: Money, Mayhem, and Votes
 
✓ Am I staying informed about political and economic issues that may pos-
sibly have a negative impact on my investment?
 
✓ Will such things as excessive regulations, price controls, or new taxes 
have a negative impact on my stock’s industry?
Here’s an example: Oil and gas service and exploration companies benefited 
from the U.S. need for more energy supplies. But investment opportunities 
didn’t stop there. As oil and gas supplies became costly and problematic, 
alternative energy sources gained national attention. The debate was rekin-
dled on solar power and exciting new technologies, such as fuel cells. As tra-
ditional sources of energy (sweet crude) became more expensive, alternative 
sources became more economical. Investors who anticipated the new inter-
est in alternative energy sought companies that would logically benefit. In the 
world of politics, Congress for years had a ban on offshore drilling, but the 
alternative energy industry received tax credits. With that wind at its back, 
along with public acceptance of clean energy technologies, alternative energy 
is something that investors should take notice of.
Distinguishing between nonsystemic and 
systemic effects
Politics can affect your investments in two basic ways: nonsystemic and 
systemic.
 
✓ Nonsystemic means that the system isn’t affected but a particular partici-
pant is affected.
 
✓ Systemic means that all the players in the system are affected.
In this case, the system is the economy at large. Politics imposes itself 
(through taxes, laws, regulations, and so on) and has an undue influence on 
all the members of that system.
Nonsystemic
Say that you decide to buy stock in a company called Golf Carts Unlimited, 
Inc. (GCU). You believe that the market for golf carts has great potential and 
that GCU stands to grow substantially. How can politics affect GCU?
What if politicians believe that GCU is too big and that it controls too much of 
the golf cart industry? Maybe they view GCU as a monopoly and want the fed-
eral government to step in to shrink GCU’s reach and influence for the benefit 
of competition and consumers. Maybe the government believes that GCU 
engages in unfair or predatory business practices and that it’s in violation 

208
Part III: Picking Winners 
of antitrust (or antimonopoly) laws. If the government acts against GCU, the 
action is a nonsystemic issue: The action is directed toward the participant 
(in this case, GCU) and not the golf cart industry in general. (See the nearby 
sidebar for more about monopolies.)
What happens if you’re an investor in GCU? Does your stock investment 
suffer as a result of government action directed against the company? Let’s 
just say that the stock price will hook left and end up in the lake.
Systemic
Say that politicians want to target the golf industry for intervention because 
they maintain that golf should be free or close to free for all to participate in 
and that a law must be passed to make it accessible to all, especially those 
people who can’t afford to play. So to remedy the situation, the following law 
is enacted: “Law #67590305598002 declares that from this day forward, all 
golf courses must charge only one dollar for any golfer who chooses to 
participate.”
That law sounds great to any golfer. But what are the unintended effects 
when such a law becomes reality? Many people agree with the sentiment 
of the law, but what about the cause-and-effect aspects of it? Obviously, all 
things being equal, golf courses will be forced to close. Staying in business is 
uneconomical if their costs are higher than their income. If they can’t charge 
any more than a dollar, how can they possibly stay open? Ultimately (and 
ironically), no one can play golf.
Playing monopoly
Government action against large companies 
for real (or alleged) abuses has happened 
many times. Longtime investors remember 
how companies such as IBM (in the 1970s) and 
Microsoft (during 1999 and 2000) faced monop-
olistic allegations. And in 2004, the New York 
attorney general targeted insurer American 
International Group, Inc. (AIG) for fraud, bid-
rigging, and accounting irregularities. In a few 
months, AIG’s stock fell from $74 to a low of $50 
in April 2005. How irony moves in strange ways! 
In 2008, the federal government bailed out AIG 
with an $80 billion loan as the company was 
pulled away from the brink of collapse. As for 
AIG’s stock? It went DOA . . . uh . . . ASAP. OK?
The federal government is a massive entity, and 
it has trillions of taxpayer dollars at its disposal. 
When it targets a company, regardless of the 
merits of the case, avoid investing in that com-
pany (until the trouble has passed). Investors 
should be wary when the government starts 
making noise about any company and potential 
legal actions against it.

209
 Chapter 15: Money, Mayhem, and Votes
What happens to investors of Golf Carts Unlimited, Inc.? If the world of golf 
shrinks, demand for golf carts shrinks as well. The value of GCU’s stock will 
certainly be stuck in a sand trap.
Examples of politics creating systemic problems are endless, but you get the 
point.
Understanding price controls
Stock investors should be very wary of price controls, which are a great 
example of regulation. A price control is a fixed price on a particular product, 
commodity, or service mandated by the government.
 
Price controls have been tried continuously throughout history, and they’ve 
continuously been removed because they ultimately do more harm than good. 
It’s easy to see why. Imagine that you run a business that sells chairs, and a 
law is passed that states, “From this point onward, chairs can be sold only for 
$10.” If all your costs stay constant at $9 or less, the regulation isn’t that bad. 
However, price controls put two dynamics in motion:
 
✓ First, the artificially lower price encourages consumption — more 
people buy chairs.
 
✓ Second, production is discouraged. What company wants to make chairs 
if it can’t sell them for a decent profit?
What happens to the company with a fixed sales price (in this example, 
$10) and rising costs? Profits shrink, and depending on how long the price 
controls are in effect, the company eventually experiences losses. The chair 
producer is eventually driven out of business. The chair-building industry 
shrinks, and the result is a chair shortage. Profits (and jobs) soon vanish. So 
what happens if you own stock in a company that builds chairs? I’ll just say 
that if I tell you which way the stock price is going, you better be sitting down 
(if, of course, you have a chair).
Poking into Political Resources
Ignoring what’s going on in the world of politics is like sleepwalking near 
the Grand Canyon — a bad idea! You have to be aware of what’s going on. 
Governmental data, reports, and political rumblings are important clues to 

210
Part III: Picking Winners 
the kind of environment that’s unfolding for the economy and financial mar-
kets. Do your research with the following resources so you can stay a step 
ahead in your stock-picking strategies.
Government reports to watch out for
The best analysts look at economic reports from both private and govern-
ment sources. The following sections list some reports/statistics issued 
by the government to watch out for. For private reports on the economy, 
investors can turn to sources such as the American Institute for Economic 
Research (www.aier.org) and Moody’s (www.economy.com).
 
Alas, government reports aren’t totally reliable because errors and/or pur-
poseful fudging happen and usually have a political component to them. Take 
the gross domestic product (GDP), for instance. In the second quarter of 2008, 
the GDP was reported at a surprisingly robust 3.3 percent — a very healthy 
number given the fact that the economy was struggling at the time. A closer 
examination reveals that the GDP was calculated using a very low inflation 
rate of just 1.2 percent, a ten-year low. Yet in a separate report for the same 
quarter, the same agency (the Bureau of Labor Statistics) reported that infla-
tion was at 5.6 percent, a 17-year high! Had the BLS used this more believable 
inflation rate, the GDP would have actually been at –1.1 percent. I doubt that 
the fact that 2008 is an election year is a coincidence because games like this 
have been played by administrations of all stripes dating back to Franklin 
Roosevelt’s day. A good way to round out your economic analysis is to com-
pare government data from other sources that scrutinize the same data. One 
that I like is Shadow Government Statistics (www.shadowstats.com).
GDP
Gross domestic product (GDP), which measures a nation’s total output of 
goods and services for the quarter, is considered the broadest measure of 
economic activity. Although the U.S. GDP is measured in dollars (it hit $14 
trillion by January 2008), it’s usually quoted as a percentage. You typically 
hear a news report that says something like, “The economy grew by 2.5 per-
cent last quarter.” Because the GDP is an important overall barometer of the 
economy, it should be a positive number. The report on the GDP is released 
quarterly by the U.S. Department of Commerce (www.commerce.doc).
 
You should regularly monitor the GDP along with economic data that relates 
directly to your stock portfolio. The following list gives some general guide-
lines for evaluating the GDP:

211
 Chapter 15: Money, Mayhem, and Votes
 
✓ Over 3 percent: This number indicates strong growth and bodes well for 
stocks. At 5 percent or higher, the economy is sizzling!
 
✓ 1 to 3 percent: This figure indicates moderate growth and can occur 
either as the economy is rebounding from a recession or as it’s slowing 
down from a previously strong period.
 
✓ 0 percent or negative (as low as –3 percent): This number isn’t good 
and indicates that the economy is either not growing or is actually 
shrinking a bit. A negative GDP is considered recessionary (meaning that 
the economy’s growth is receding).
 
✓ Under –3 percent: A GDP this low indicates a very difficult period for the 
economy. A GDP under –3 percent, especially for two or more quarters, 
indicates a serious recession or possibly a depression.
 
Looking at a single quarter isn’t that useful. Track the GDP over many quarters 
to see which way the general economy is trending. When you look at the GDP 
for a particular quarter of a year, ask yourself whether it’s better (or worse) 
than the quarter before. If it’s better (or worse), then ask yourself to what 
extent it has changed. Is it dramatically better (or worse) than the quarter 
before? Is the economy showing steady growth, or is it slowing? If several 
quarters show solid growth, the overall economy is generally bullish.
Traditionally, if two or more consecutive quarters show negative growth 
(economic output is shrinking), the economy is considered to be in a reces-
sion. A recession can be a painful necessity; it usually occurs when the 
economy can’t absorb the total amount of goods being produced because of 
too much excess production. A bear market in stocks usually accompanies a 
recession.
 
The GDP is just a rough estimate at best. It can’t possibly calculate all the fac-
tors that go into economic growth. For example, crime has a negative effect 
on economic growth, but it’s not reflected in the GDP. Still, most economists 
agree that the GDP provides a ballpark snapshot of the overall economy’s 
progress.
Unemployment
The National Unemployment Report is provided by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (www.bls.gov). It gives investors a snapshot of the health and 
productivity of the economy.
The Consumer Price Index
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a statistic that tracks the prices of a rep-
resentative basket of goods and services on a monthly basis. This statistic, 
which is also computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is meant to track 

212
Part III: Picking Winners 
price inflation. Investors should pay attention to the CPI because a low-
inflation environment is good for stocks (and bonds, too), while high inflation 
is generally more favorable for sectors such as commodities and precious 
metals.
Web sites to surf
To find out about new laws being passed or proposed, check out 
Congress and what’s going on at its primary Web sites: the U.S. House of 
Representatives (www.house.gov) and the U.S. Senate (www.senate.gov). 
For presidential information and proposals, check the White House’s Web 
site at www.whitehouse.gov.
 
You also may want to check out THOMAS, the service provided by the Library 
of Congress, at http://thomas.loc.gov. THOMAS is a search engine that 
helps you find any piece of legislation, either by bill number or keyword. This 
search engine is an excellent way to find out whether an industry is being 
targeted for increased regulation or deregulation. In the late 1980s, real estate 
was hit hard when the government passed new regulations and tax rules 
(related stocks went down). When the telecom industry was deregulated in 
the mid-1990s, the industry grew dramatically (related stocks went up).

In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the differences between investing and trading
▶ Checking out the tools of stock trading
▶ Sticking to important rules for safe trading
You may have heard of stock trading and wondered how it compares 
to stock investing. Rest assured that trading and investing are two dif-
ferent animals. Trading is advantageous when you’re looking to profit from 
short-term swings in the market due to volatility. However, trading can be 
dangerous because the market’s short-term movements can be quite unpre-
dictable. The only reason I’m including trading in this book is because you, 
dear reader, should get some do’s and don’ts in this short-term venture. If 
you’re going to trade stocks, you should have some guidelines to keep the 
downside to a minimum. I explain what you need to know in this chapter.
The Differences between 
Investing and Trading
Stock investing and stock trading may sound similar, but they’re actually 
pretty different:
 
✓ Investing looks primarily at fundamentals (earnings, sales, industry 
outlook, and so on), which tend to be long-term drivers of stock prices. 
The long-term investor waits out the zigzags as long as the bullish out-
look and the general uptrend are intact. The good part is that investing 
involves fewer transaction costs (you aren’t constantly buying and sell-
ing stock) and usually lower taxes (long-term capital gains typically are 
taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains). The bad part is that some-
times the stock can correct (go down temporarily) or have periods of 
flat performance, which the long-term investor has to patiently tolerate.

✓ In trading, much more activity takes place during a range of a few days, 
weeks, or months. Traders may dump losers immediately and cash out 
winners to lock in some profit before the next dip in price. Trading can 
mean more costs due to frequent commissions and short-term taxable 
gains. For trading, the fundamentals are either not a factor or at best a 
secondary or minor factor because short-term movements in a stock 
price are more geared to momentum and sentiment, which is reflected 
in the data found in charts along with price and volume statistics.
The following sections give you the full scoop on the differences between 
investing and trading.
The time factor
When I first started investing in stocks, it was easy to delineate what was 
short term, intermediate term, and long term:
 
✓ Short term was less than one year.
 
✓ Intermediate term was usually one to three years or one to five years, 
depending on your personal outlook.
 
✓ Long term was beyond that time frame.
In recent years, however, investors have become very impatient. For some 
investors, short term is now measured in days, intermediate term in weeks, 
and long term in months. In the old days, investors were akin to cooks using 
the crock pot; today, they use the microwave. But these people are actually 
traders, not investors. If an investment does well, they sell it immediately and 
move on to (hopefully) another profitable investment. If the investment is 
down, they sell it immediately and move on to (hopefully) greener pastures 
elsewhere.
 
There’s no such thing as a three-month investment when it comes to stocks. 
Stocks require time for the marketplace to discover them. Sometimes great 
stocks see their prices move very little because the market (again, millions of 
individual and institutional investors) hasn’t noticed them yet. In trading, on 
the other hand, you jump in and out relatively quickly. Typical trades occur 
over the span of a few days or a few weeks. Of course, if a position you take 
on grows more profitable and your expectations are positive, you can stay in 
longer. But many experienced traders won’t tempt fate and stay in too long 
because a reversal of fortune can always occur, so don’t be shy about cashing 
out and taking a profit.

217
 Chapter 16: Choosing between Investing and Trading
The psychology factor
In investing, you can be very analytical. You can look at a stock and its fun-
damentals and then at the prospects for the stock’s industry and the general 
economy, and you can make a good choice knowing that you’re not worried 
about the price going up or down a few percentage points in the next few 
days or weeks. If you’ve done your homework, your stock will eventually go 
up and do well over the long haul.
Trading is different. Trading involves looking at stocks that have the ability 
to move quickly, regardless of the direction. The reason is that seasoned 
traders want to make money quickly and capitalize on crowd psychology. It 
matters little whether investors are bidding up or down; the trader is primar-
ily looking for a stock with momentum.
Checking out an example
The stock investor takes the long view and stays patient and focused. As I try 
to stress throughout this book, investing should be measured in years, and 
the stock’s fundamentals (a company’s profits, sales, industry, and so on) 
are the foundation. A patient and successful investor holds on as the stock 
zigzags upward. When the inevitable correction occurs, a successful inves-
tor either just waits it out or takes that moment as a buying opportunity and 
adds shares to her holdings. In a bullish (up) outlook, the investor expects 
the stock to generally trend upward. If the investor expects a stock to have a 
downward path, then obviously she simply avoids it.
The stock trader sees things differently. The trader may indeed be just as 
bullish on a particular stock but may also bet on the occasional pullback or 
correction that’s typical of most stocks. The trader may buy 100 shares of a 
stock and keep it as a core holding, but he may also make different bets on its 
price movement.
For an example, take a look at the chart in Figure 16-1. This is a chart of Zig 
Zag Corporation (ZZC), and it’s helpful in showing you how investing and 
trading behave differently during the same time frame.
An investor would have bought ZZC stock in 2006 and held on. As long as 
the fundamentals don’t change, the investor just “buys right and sits tight.” 
Although some traders may smirk at such a simple strategy, it’s a time-tested 
approach. Look at billionaire Warren Buffet for a great example of this. He 
has been known to hold stocks for decades. Many investors (and traders, 
too) envy his extraordinary success, but relatively few try to emulate it. 

218
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
Patience and discipline aren’t always popular or fashionable in investing, but 
a patient, disciplined approach has proven to be superior to many trading 
systems that tell you to jump in and jump out.
Looking at Figure 16-1, how would successful traders have performed with 
ZZC? The trader may start off as an investor and make that initial invest-
ment in the stock. As time passes, the trader would be watching technical 
indicators to time an entry or exit point. A technical indicator is a result of a 
mathematical calculation based on prices and the volume of trading, typi-
cally displayed as a chart. (See the “Technical analysis” section later in this 
chapter.)
Stock traders typically use options (such as calls and puts) because they’re 
cheap and can provide a magnified move with the underlying stock. In other 
words, options are a form of leverage, meaning that the price swing can be 
greater (up or down) than the move in the underlying stock. If a stock moves 
up 10 percent, then an option (in this case a call option) could go up 20 per-
cent or more. Of course, if the stock goes down 10 percent, then that same 
option could easily go down 20 percent or more.

 Chapter 16: Choosing between Investing and Trading
What are call and put options?
 
✓ A call option is a bet that a particular stock (or exchange-traded fund) 
will go up during the life of the option.
 
✓ A put option is a bet that a particular stock (or exchange-traded fund) 
will go down during the life of the option.
 
Think of the following (very rough) rule of thumb:
 
✓ If the stock goes up 10 percent, a call option on that stock could go up 
20 percent. Of course, a put option on that same stock would lose 20 
percent (or more).
 
✓ If the stock goes down 10 percent, a call option could go down 20 per-
cent. Of course, a put option on that same stock would gain 20 percent 
(or more).
 
✓ If the stock stays flat or neutral, both the call and put options would 
start to lose value because options have a finite life and can potentially 
be worthless by the time they expire.
Referring back to Figure 16-1, the trader may have seen his stock rise during 
October and November 2006 from about $55 per share to $70. Technical indi-
cators may have flashed that the stock is overbought. Some traders would 
have cashed in and sat with the cash, waiting for the next opportunity. Other 
traders would have kept the stock but cashed in any call options that were 
purchased before that time frame for a nice profit. The money from cash-
ing out the sale of the call options would sit waiting for the next entry point. 
Perhaps the trader would then use the money to purchase put options, bet-
ting that a correction was soon due. Then you see the huge move up by ZZC 
starting at about $55 in December 2006 and hitting $115 in October 2007 
before correcting in a zigzag fashion down to about $73 in January 2008.
Had the trader employed both calls and puts, he would have had plenty of 
opportunities for profit. During the summer of 2007, the call options would 
have been profitable and could have been cashed out. In that scenario, a call 
option could easily reward the astute trader with triple-percentage gains. 
Of course, the puts in the same time frame would have greatly lost value. 
Heading into the September 2007–January 2008 period, the bearish strategies 
would have paid off because put options would rise in value as the underly-
ing asset (in this case the stock of ZZC) declined.
As you can see, the successful trader must diligently monitor his positions and 
frequently enter more than one position on the same stock to try to capitalize 
on the stock’s movements. Whenever you take opposing positions on the same 
security, you’re doing a form of hedging. Hedging takes into consideration the 
idea that the market can easily go against you, which is an especially likely sce-
nario if the market is volatile. In that case, why not profit from the move?

220
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
 
Keep in mind that any profits are offset by any losses from options that lose 
value (or expire worthless) and by transaction costs.
 
Scores of books have been written about options, so I won’t go into great 
detail here, but you should get familiar with options, especially if short-term 
speculating or trading greatly interests you. You can start with Stock Options 
For Dummies by Alan R. Simon and Trading Options For Dummies by George A. 
Fontanills, both published by Wiley.
Tools of the Trader
As you can judge from the example I provide earlier in this chapter, success-
ful trading requires lots of diligent attention. Because stocks can go all over 
the place, the trader uses various tools to determine entry and exit points. I 
cover some of those tools and strategies in the following sections.
Technical analysis
The most common tool of short-term speculators and traders is technical 
analysis. Technical analysis looks at the recent price movements and volume 
of trading for particular securities and commodities. The price movements 
are depicted on charts, so “charting a security” is a common practice among 
those who use technical analysis.
The technical analyst uses some useful short-term indicators, including
 
✓ Moving averages to gauge the general trend for a particular stock. 
Typical moving averages are the 10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day 
averages. Stocks that stay above these averages tend to be bullish, while 
stocks that keep falling below these averages tend to be bearish.
 
✓ Relative Strength Indicators (RSI) to see if a stock is considered over-
sold or overbought. A technical analyst sees an oversold stock as a 
buying opportunity and an overbought stock as a selling opportunity.
 
Technical analysis is a complex topic, and I just can’t do it justice in this soli-
tary chapter. I don’t mean to shortchange it, as it’s worthy of study for serious 
traders. I mention it here because traders should be aware of it, regardless 
of how extensively they use it. I strongly recommend that serious traders do 
some extensive research on the topic. Consider starting your research with 
Technical Analysis For Dummies by Barbara Rockefeller (Wiley).

221
 Chapter 16: Choosing between Investing and Trading
 
As most longtime readers probably know by now, I’m not an ardent fan of 
technical analysis. Don’t get me wrong; I respect it as a short-term trading 
tool. It can be remarkably useful over a period of a few weeks or months. 
However, it’s not that useful for long-term investing. Yes, you can use it to 
maximize an entry or exit point, but over the long haul, a company’s funda-
mentals are the primary drivers of the stock’s price. When you look at the pan-
theon of consistently successful investors in history, it’s no accident that most 
of them use fundamental analysis and are into some form of value investing.
Brokerage orders
Because trading in the market’s short-term gyrations can be a fast-moving 
activity, it pays to get proficient with brokerage orders and trading triggers 
to help you manage your trading portfolio and take advantage of the market’s 
swift moves.
The moment after a diligent trader buys a stock or an option, she’ll enter 
her next order very quickly — often even before the stock has made a major 
move. For example, if she buys a stock for $50 at 10 a.m. on a weekday morn-
ing, she may enter a stop-loss order at, say, $45 at 11 a.m. and simultaneously 
put in a sell order at $60. That way she can limit the loss to $5 per share and 
maybe catch a $10 profit on the upside. These moves are possible now due to 
the sophisticated technology that most brokers have on their Web sites.
That’s just an example of what you can do with brokerage orders. Find out 
more about brokerage orders and trade triggers in Chapter 18.
Advisory services
 
You don’t have to go it alone with your trading strategies because the world is 
filled with advisory services, newsletters, and Web sites that cater to the art 
and science of short-term trading. Some notable ones that I respect include 
Elliott Wave International (www.elliottwave.com) and Roger Wiegand’s 
Trader Tracks (www.tradertracks.com). A monthly publication that covers 
the realm of trading is Stock, Futures and Options magazine (www.sfomag.
com). Of course, you can do your own diligent research at the library and on 
the Internet (check Appendix A for resources).

222
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
The Basic Rules of Trading
If you’re going to trade, adhere to some golden rules to help you maximize 
your success (or at least minimize potential losses):
 
✓ Don’t commit all your cash at once: In a fast-moving market, opportuni-
ties come up all the time. Try to keep some cash on hand to take advan-
tage of those opportunities.
 
✓ Have a plan: Try to have predetermined points at which you cut losses 
or take profits.
 
✓ Taking profits is not a sin: Sometimes, a bird in the hand is worth two in 
the bush. Markets can reverse fairly quickly. If you have a stock position 
sitting there with a fat profit, it can’t hurt to take the profit. This gives 
you cash for the next opportunity.
 
✓ Discover hedging techniques: Just because you’re bullish doesn’t mean 
that you can’t also put on a bearish position. Hedging techniques pro-
tect you when the market moves against you.
 
✓ Find out which events move markets: Research the market and dis-
cover what types of events tend to move it (either up or down). Serious 
short-term traders keep one eye on their positions and the other on 
what’s going on in the world. Keep informed by regularly reading finan-
cial publications and Web sites (see Appendix A for resources).
 
✓ Check the stock’s trading history: Charts and related data tell you how 
a particular stock has moved in recent weeks, months, and years. Do 
you see any seasonality or reliable patterns that may help you judge 
future movements?
 
✓ Use stop-loss and limit orders: Using trade orders are an integral part of 
the trader’s overall strategy. Find out more in Chapter 18.
 
✓ Use discipline and patience versus emotion and panic: Part of the 
human equation in the world of financial markets is that fear and greed 
can become an irrational, short-term driver of prices. Instead of joining 
the crowd, watch them to give you an advantage in assessing a stock’s 
price movements. Stick with your plan and use discipline and patience.
 
✓ Minimize transaction costs: Keep in mind that because trading is typi-
cally active and short term, transaction costs are significant. Active 
trading can mean lots of brokerage commissions, even in this age of 
Internet-based brokerage firms. Therefore, traders should shop around 
for brokerage firms that charge low commissions for those that trade 
frequently (check out brokerage firms in Appendix A). In addition, short-
term trading leads to short-term capital gains, which are taxed at a 
higher rate than long-term transactions.

223
 Chapter 16: Choosing between Investing and Trading
 
✓ Understand the beta of a stock: The volatility of a stock is an impor-
tant consideration for traders. The more volatile a stock is, the greater 
its ups and downs are. Therefore, traders should regularly check the 
stock’s beta. Beta is a statistical measure of how volatile a particular 
stock is relative to a market standard (such as the S&P 500 index).
 
 How is it measured? The S&P 500 (for example) is given a beta of 1. A 
stock with a beta of 2 is considered twice as volatile as the index. In 
other words, if the index falls by 10 percent, the stock in question has the 
potential of falling by 20 percent. A stock with a beta of 0.5 is considered 
to be half as volatile as the index. In other words, if the index falls by 10 
percent, that low-beta stock would only be expected to fall 5 percent.
 
 Traders looking for fast (and hopefully profitable) movement look for 
high-beta opportunities. A stock’s beta can be found on various financial 
Web sites (see resources in Appendix A).
 
✓ Read and learn from top traders: Last (but not least), learn from the 
great ones out there, such as the legendary Jesse Livermore. You can 
read all about his trading exploits in the book Reminiscences of a Stock 
Operator by Edwin Lefevre (Wiley).
 
Because trading can be very risky, you need to know as much as you can. 
Don’t use your rent money or retirement money, and for crying out loud, don’t 
break open your kid’s piggy bank. Trading should only be done with risk capi-
tal (money that, if lost, doesn’t hurt your lifestyle). And don’t forget the advice 
from the immortal Will Rogers: “Don’t gamble; take all your savings and buy 
some good stock and hold it till it goes up, then sell it. If it don’t go up, don’t 
buy it.”

Chapter 17
Selecting a Strategy That’s 
Just Right for You
In This Chapter
▶ Basing your investing strategy on your needs and time frame
▶ Deciding where and how to allocate your assets
▶ Recognizing when to unload your stocks
S
tocks are a means to an end. What end are you seeking? You should look 
at stocks as tools for wealth building. Sometimes they’re great tools, 
and sometimes they’re awful. The results you get depend on your approach. 
Some stocks are appropriate for a conservative approach, while others are 
more suitable for an aggressive approach. Sometimes stocks aren’t a good 
idea at all. Golly! A stock investing book that suggests that stocks aren’t 
always the answer! That’s like a teenager saying, “Dad, I respectfully decline 
your generous offer of money for my weekend trip, and I’d be glad to mow 
the lawn.”
In this chapter, I help you select a stock-investing strategy based on your 
personal circumstances and the amount of money you have to invest. I also 
provide tips on when to sell your stocks.
Laying Out Your Plans
A senior citizen in one of my investment seminars in 2000 wanted to be more 
aggressive with his portfolio, and his broker was more than happy to cater to 
his desire for growth stocks. Of course, stocks got clobbered in the volatile 
bear market of 2000–2002, and yes, he did lose lots of money. However, I soon 
discovered that even after the losses, he still had a substantial stock portfolio 
valued at over $1 million. He had more than enough to ensure a comfortable 

226
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
retirement. He sought aggressive growth even though it was really unneces-
sary for his situation. If anything, the aggressive strategy could have put his 
portfolio (and hence his retirement) in jeopardy.
 
Growth is desirable even in your twilight years because inflation can eat away 
at a fixed-income portfolio. But different rates of growth exist, and the type 
you choose should be commensurate with your unique situation and financial 
needs. Notice that I say “needs,” not “wants.” These perspectives are entirely 
different. You may want to invest in aggressive stocks regardless of their suit-
ability (after all, it’s your money), but your financial situation may dictate that 
you need to take another approach. Just understand the difference.
Stocks can play a role in all sorts of investment strategies, but in this chapter, 
I discuss only a few well-known approaches. Keep in mind that your stock-
investing strategy can change based on the major changes in your life and the 
lifestyle that you lead, such as the ones I present in the following sections.
Living the bachelor life: Young 
single with no dependents
If you’re young (age 20–40) and single, with no children or other dependents, 
being more aggressive with your stock selection is fine (as long as you don’t 
use your rent money for investments). The reasoning is that if you do make 
riskier choices and they backfire, individuals dependent on you won’t get 
hurt. In addition, if you’re in this category, you can usually bounce back a lot 
easier over the long term even if you have financial challenges or if a bear 
(down) market hits your stocks.
Safety first: Examining savings bonds
For the next few years, fixed-interest bonds and 
other debt instruments (like corporate bonds) 
generally aren’t the right place to be because 
excessive debt, low interest rates, and rising infla-
tion are problematic for investors. A nice oasis in 
the valley of death known as America’s debt load 
(currently $44+ trillion, which dwarfs our national 
GDP of about $14 trillion!) is U.S. Treasury-issued 
savings bonds, which can be purchased for as 
little as $25. Two types are out there — EE and I 
bonds. The interest rate for the EE bond is fixed, 
while the I bond’s interest rate changes every 
six months, as it’s tied to the official inflation 
rate referred to as the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI). If rates go up, the U.S. Treasury automati-
cally updates the interest rate on your I savings 
bonds every six months so you aren’t locked in to 
low rates when market rates are rising. Savings 
bonds are ultra safe, convenient, and inexpen-
sive to buy, and they’re free from state and local 
taxes. Find out more at the U.S. Treasury Web site 
(www.savingsbonds.gov).

227
 Chapter 17: Selecting a Strategy That’s Just Right for You
 
Consider a mix of small cap, mid cap, and large cap growth stocks in growth 
industries (see Chapter 1 for an explanation of small cap, mid cap, and large 
cap stocks; I provide information on industries in Chapter 13). Invest some of 
your money in five to seven stocks and the remainder in growth-stock mutual 
funds. You can revise your investment allocations along the way as the gen-
eral economy and/or your personal situation changes (like when you finally 
say “I do” to the love of your life).
Going together like a horse and 
carriage: Married with children
Married couples with children must follow a more conservative investing 
strategy, regardless of whether one spouse works or both spouses work. 
Children change the picture drastically (believe me; I have them — and the 
baggy eyes to prove it). You need more stable growth in your portfolio (and 
unbreakable furniture in your home).
 
Consider a mix of large cap growth stocks and dividend-paying defensive 
stocks. (See Chapter 9 for more on defensive stocks.) Invest some of your 
money in five to seven stocks and the remainder in growth and income mutual 
funds. Of course, you can tweak your allocations along the way according 
to changes in the general economic conditions or your personal situation. 
Consider setting aside money for college in a growth-oriented mutual fund and 
in other vehicles such as savings bonds (as early as possible). For more infor-
mation on financing college, check out 529 & Other College Savings Plans For 
Dummies by Margaret A. Munro (published by Wiley).
Getting ready for retirement: Over 40 
and either single or married
Whether you’re over 40 and single or over 40 and married — and if married, 
whether one or both of you work — you should start to slowly convert your 
portfolio from aggressive growth to conservative growth. Shift more of your 
money out of individual stocks and into less-volatile investments such as bal-
anced funds, investment-grade bonds, and bank certificates of deposit.
Devote some time and effort (with a financial planner if necessary) to calcu-
lating what your potential financial needs will be at retirement time. This step 
is critical in helping you decide what age to target for financial independence. 
(What’s that? I can stop working?! Yee-ha!)

228
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
 
Consider five to seven large cap stocks that are predominantly dividend-paying 
defensive stocks in stable and needed industries (such as utilities, food and 
beverage, and so on). Put the remainder of your investment money in balanced 
mutual funds and short-term investment-grade bond funds. Don’t invest all 
your money — keep about 10 to 15 percent of it in something very secure, 
such as savings bonds and bank vehicles (savings accounts and certificates 
of deposit). Keep savings in at least two separate institutions if possible to be 
diversified in today’s uncertain economy. Remember that you can revise 
your allocations in the future as necessary.
Kicking back in the hammock: 
Already retired
If you’re retired, you’re probably in your 60s or older. Safe, reliable income 
and wealth preservation form the crux of your investment strategy. Some 
growth-oriented investments are okay as long as they’re conservative and 
don’t jeopardize your need for income. At one time, financial planners told 
their retired clients to replace growth-oriented investments with safe income-
oriented investments. However, times have changed as senior citizens live 
longer than ever before.
 
Issues such as longevity and inflation (steadily increasing costs of living) 
mean that today’s (and tomorrow’s) retirees need growth in their portfolios. 
To be safe, make sure that 5–20 percent of your retirement portfolio has some 
growth-oriented securities such as stocks to make sure that you continue 
meeting your financial needs as the years pass. You should perform an annual 
review to see whether the stock allocation needs to be adjusted.
 
Consider a mix of large cap stocks dominated by dividend-paying defensive 
stocks in stable industries. Spread your money over three to six stocks, bal-
anced mutual funds, and short-term investment-grade bond funds. Have a 
portion of your money in savings bonds and bank investments. You need to 
monitor and tweak your investment portfolio along the way to account for 
changes in either the general economic environment or your lifestyle needs.
Allocating Your Assets
Asset allocation is really an attempt to properly implement the concept of 
diversification — the key to safety and stability. Diversification is the inclu-
sion in your portfolio of different (and frequently offsetting) investments to 
shield your wealth from most types of current risk while planning for future 

229
 Chapter 17: Selecting a Strategy That’s Just Right for You
growth. To achieve proper diversification, you need to analyze your entire 
portfolio to look for glaring weaknesses or vulnerable areas. I don’t discuss 
your total investment plan here — only the stock portion.
Investors frequently believe that having different stocks in different indus-
tries constitutes proper diversification. Well . . . not quite. Stocks in closely 
related industries tend to be affected (in differing degrees) by the same eco-
nomic events, government policies, and so on. It’s best to invest in stocks 
across different sectors. A sector is essentially a group of related industries; 
water, gas, and electric services are industries, but together they (plus a few 
other industries) make up the utilities sector. For more on analyzing indus-
tries to pick winning stocks, see Chapter 13.
Earlier in this chapter, I talk about some basics for investing, depending 
on your lifestyle, but how do you know how much you need to invest to 
meet your financial goals? In the following sections, I present some typical 
amounts most typical investors can (and should) devote to stock investing.
Investors with less than $10,000
If you have $10,000 or less to allocate to stocks, you may want to consider a 
mutual fund rather than individual stocks because that sum of money may 
not be enough to properly diversify. But if you’re going to invest a sum that 
small, consider allocating it equally into two to four stocks in two different 
sectors that look strong for the foreseeable future. For small investors, con-
sider sectors that are defensive in nature (such as food and utilities).
 
Because $10,000 or less is a small sum in the world of stock investing, you 
may have to purchase in odd lots. (Odd lots usually mean 99 shares or fewer. 
A block of 100 shares is considered a round lot, and 200 shares would be con-
sidered two round lots.) Say that you’re buying four stocks, and all of them are 
priced at $50 per share. Obviously, your $10,000 won’t buy you 100 shares of 
each. You may have to consider investing $2,500 in each stock, which means 
that you end up buying only 50 shares of each stock (not including commis-
sions). Whether you buy an odd lot or a round lot, find out whether the com-
pany has a dividend reinvestment plan (DRP), and use the dividend money you 
earn to buy more shares of stock. (I discuss DRPs more fully in Chapter 19.)
 
Try to avoid the temptation of getting into initial public offerings (IPOs; see 
Chapter 8), penny stocks, and other speculative issues. Participation in them 
may cost little (stock prices are often under $10 per share and can be under $1), 
but the risk exposure is too high for inexperienced investors. If you can’t buy 
100 shares of a large-cap stock, consider buying fewer shares, because com-
missions are still relatively low. In general, it’s safer to buy 50 shares of a large, 
established company than the same amount in a smaller, riskier company.

230
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
Investors with $10,000 to $50,000
If you have between $10,000 and $50,000 to invest, you have more breath-
ing space for diversification. Consider buying four to six stocks in two or 
three different sectors. If you’re the cautious type, defensive stocks will do. 
For growth investors, seek the industries in those sectors that have proven 
growth. This approach gets you off to a good start, and the section “Knowing 
When to Sell,” later in this chapter, can help you maintain your portfolio by 
changing your strategy when necessary.
 
Does diversification mean that you shouldn’t, under any circumstances, 
have all your stocks in one sector? It depends on you. For example, if you’ve 
worked all your life in a particular field and you’re knowledgeable and com-
fortable with the sector, having a greater exposure is okay because your 
greater personal expertise offsets the risk. If you worked in retail for 20 years 
and know the industry inside and out, you probably know more about the 
good, the bad, and the ugly of the retail sector than most Wall Street analysts. 
Use your insight for more profitability. You still shouldn’t invest all your 
money in that single sector, however, because diversification is still vital.
Investors with $50,000 or more
If you have $50,000 or more to invest, have no more than five to ten stocks in 
two or three different sectors. It’s difficult to thoroughly track more than two 
or three sectors and do it successfully — best to keep it simple. For example, 
Warren Buffett, considered the greatest stock market investor of all time, has 
never invested in Web site businesses because he doesn’t understand them. 
He invests only in businesses that he understands. If that strategy works for 
billionaire investors, then, by golly, it can’t be that bad for smaller investors.
 
I suggest investing in no more than seven to ten stocks, because there is such 
a thing as overdiversification. The more stocks you have, the tougher it is to 
keep track of them. Owning more stocks means you need to do more research, 
read more annual reports and news articles, and follow the business news of 
more companies. Even in the best of times, you need to regularly monitor your 
stocks because successful investing requires diligent effort.

 Chapter 17: Selecting a Strategy That’s Just Right for You
 
Consider whether to hire a personal money manager (a person that manages 
investment portfolios for a fee). If you have $50,000 to $100,000 or more, doing 
so may make sense. Get a referral from a financial planner and carefully weigh 
the benefits against the costs. Here are some points to consider:
 
✓ Make sure that the money manager has a philosophy and an approach 
that you agree with. Ask her to give you a copy of her written invest-
ment philosophy. How does she feel about small cap stocks versus large 
caps, or income investing versus growth investing?
 
✓ Find out whether you’re comfortable with how the money manager 
selects stocks. Is he a value investor or a growth investor? Is he aggres-
sive or conservative? Does he analyze a stock based on its fundamentals 
(sales, earnings, book value, and so on), or does he use stock price charts?
 
✓ Ask the money manager to explain her strategy. A good way to evalu-
ate the success (or failure) of the money manager’s strategy is to ask her 
for her past recommendations. Did she pick more winners than losers?
 
✓ Ask the money manager to describe his economic philosophy. Is it 
Keynesian, Austrian, or some other school of thought? Yes, it does 
matter, and Chapter 10 gives you some details about this (I happen to be 
in the Austrian school of thought).
Knowing When to Sell
The act of buying stock is relatively easy. However, the act of selling stock 
can be an agonizing decision for investors. But it’s agonizing only in two 
instances: when you’ve made money with your stock and when you’ve lost it. 
That about covers it. It sounds like a bad joke, but it’s not that far from the 
truth.
The idea of selling stock when it has appreciated (the stock price has 
increased in value) comes with the following concerns:
 
✓ Tax implications: This concern is a good reason to consider selling. See 
Chapter 21 for information about how selling stocks under given circum-
stances can affect your taxes.
 
✓ Emotional baggage: “That stock was in our family for years.” Believe it 
or not, investors cite this personal reason (or one of a dozen other per-
sonal reasons) for agonizing over the sale of an appreciated stock.

232
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
The following is a list of issues that investors should be aware of when 
they’re selling a stock that has lost money:
 
✓ Tax benefits: This issue is a good reason to consider selling a stock. 
See Chapter 21 for more on timing your stock sales to minimize your tax 
burden.
 
✓ Pride: “If I sell, I’ll have to admit I was wrong” (followed by silent sob-
bing). So what? The best investors in history have made bad invest-
ments (some that have been quite embarrassing, in fact). Losing a little 
pride is cheaper than losing your money.
 
✓ Doubt: “If I sell my stock now, it may rebound later.” Frequently, when 
an investor buys a stock at $50 and it goes to $40, the investor believes 
that if he sells, the stock will make an immediate rebound and go to 
$60, and then he’ll be kicking himself. That may happen, but usually the 
stock price goes lower.
 
✓ Separation anxiety: “But I’ve had this stock so long that it’s become 
a part of me.” People hang onto a losing stock for all sorts of illogical 
reasons. Being married to a person is great; being married to a stock is 
ludicrous. If a stock isn’t helping your goals, then it’s hurting your goals.
People have plenty more reasons to agonize over the sale of a bad stock, but 
you can learn to handle the stock sale in a disciplined manner.
 
You have only two reasons to consider selling a stock, regardless of whether 
the stock price has gone up or down:
 
✓ You need the money. Obviously, if you need the money for a bona 
fide reason — such as paying off debt, wiping out a tax bill, or buying a 
home — then you need the money. This reason is easy to see. After all, 
regardless of investment or tax considerations, stocks are there to serve 
you. I hope you do some financial planning so that you don’t need to sell 
your stocks for these types of expenses, but you can’t avoid unexpected 
expenditures.
 
✓ The stock ceases to perform as you desire. If the stock isn’t serving 
your wealth-building goals or fulfilling your investment objectives, it’s 
time to get rid of it and move on to the next stock. Just as soon as you 
get a stiff upper lip and resolve to unload this losing stock, a little voice 
saying, “If I sell my stock now, it may rebound later,” starts to haunt you. 
So you hang onto the stock, but then — bam! — before you know it, you 
lose more money.

233
 Chapter 17: Selecting a Strategy That’s Just Right for You
 
Selling a stock shouldn’t require a psychologist, but it does require discipline, 
which is why I’m a big proponent of trailing stops (see Chapter 18 for more on 
stop orders). Trailing stops take the agony out of selling the stock. All else 
being equal, you shouldn’t sell a winning stock. If it’s doing well, why sell it? 
Keep it as long as possible. But if it stops being a winning stock, sell it. If you 
don’t know how or when to sell it, then apply a stop-loss order at 5 or 10 per-
cent below the market value and let the market action take its course.

nvestment success isn’t just about which stocks to choose; it’s also about 
how you choose those stocks. Frequently, investors think that good stock 
picking means doing your homework and then making that buy (or sell). 
However, you can take it a step further to maximize profits (or minimize 
losses). As a stock investor, you can take advantage of techniques and ser-
vices available through your standard brokerage account (see Chapter 7 for 
details). This chapter presents some of the best ways you can use these pow-
erful techniques, which are useful whether you’re buying or selling stock.
Just before the stock market bubble of 2000 popped, I warned my students 
and readers that a bear market was on the way. All the data warned me about 
it, and undoubtedly, it seemed like a time for caution. Investors didn’t have 
to necessarily believe me, but they could have (at the very least) used trail-
ing stops and other techniques to ensure greater investing success. Investors 
who used stop-loss orders avoided the carnage of trillions of dollars in stock 
losses. In this chapter, I show you how to use these techniques to maximize 
your investing profit.
Checking Out Brokerage Orders
Orders you place with your stockbroker fit neatly into three categories:
 
✓ Time-related orders
 
✓ Condition-related orders
 
✓ Advanced orders

236
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
At the very least, get familiar with the first two types of orders because 
they’re easy to implement, and they’re invaluable tools for wealth building 
and (more importantly) wealth saving! Advanced orders usually are combina-
tions of the first two types.
 
Using a combination of orders helps you fine-tune your strategy so that you 
can maintain greater control over your investments. Speak with your broker 
about the different types of orders you can use to maximize the gains (or mini-
mize the losses) from your stock investing activities. You also can read the 
broker’s policies on stock orders at the brokerage Web site.
On the clock: Time-related orders
Time-related orders are just that — the order has a time limit. Typically, 
investors use these orders in conjunction with condition-related orders, 
which I describe later in this chapter. The two most common time-related 
orders are day orders and good-till-canceled (or GTC) orders.
Day order
A day order is an order to buy or sell a stock that expires at the end of that 
particular trading day. If you tell your broker, “Buy BYOB, Inc., at $37.50 
and make it a day order,” you mean that you want to purchase the stock at 
$37.50. But if the stock doesn’t hit that price, your order expires, unfilled, at 
the end of the trading day. Why would you place such an order? Maybe BYOB 
is trading at $39, but you don’t want to buy it at that price because you don’t 
believe the stock is worth it. Consequently, you have no problem not getting 
the stock that day.
When would you use day orders? It depends on your preferences and per-
sonal circumstances. I rarely use day orders because few events cause me 
to say, “Gee, I’ll just try to buy or sell between now and the end of today’s 
trading action.” However, you may feel that you don’t want a specified order 
to linger beyond today’s market action. Perhaps you want to test a price. (“I 
want to get rid of stock A at $39 to make a quick profit, but it’s currently trad-
ing at $37.50. However, I may change my mind tomorrow.”) A day order is the 
perfect strategy to use in this case.
 
If you make a trade and don’t specify time with the order, most (if not all) bro-
kers automatically treat it as a day order.

237
 Chapter 18: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques
Good-till-canceled (GTC) order
A good-till-canceled (GTC) order is the most commonly requested order by 
investors. The GTC order means just what it says: The order stays in effect 
until it’s transacted or until the investor cancels it. Although GTC orders 
are time-related, they’re always tied to a condition, such as when the stock 
achieves a certain price.
 
Although the order implies that it can run indefinitely, most brokers have a 
limit of 30 or 60 days (or more). By that time, either the broker cancels the 
order or contacts you to see whether you want to extend it. Ask your broker 
about his particular policy.
A GTC order is usually coupled with condition-related orders. For example, 
say that you want to buy ASAP Corp. stock but you don’t want to buy it at 
the current price of $48 per share. You’ve done your homework on the stock, 
including looking at the stock’s price-to-earnings ratio, price to book ratio, 
and so on (see Appendix B for more on ratios), and you say, “Hey, this stock 
isn’t worth $48 a share. I’d only buy it at $36 per share.” You think the stock 
would make a good addition to your portfolio but not at the current market 
price. (It’s overpriced or overvalued according to your analysis.) How should 
you proceed? Your best bet is to ask your broker to do a GTC order at $36. 
This request means that your broker will buy the shares if and when they hit 
the $36 mark (unless you cancel the order). Just make sure that your account 
has the funds available to complete the transaction.
 
GTC orders are very useful, so you should become familiar with your broker’s 
policy on them. While you’re at it, ask whether any fees apply. Many brokers 
don’t charge for GTC orders because if they happen to result in a buy (or sell) 
order, they generate a normal commission just as any stock transaction does. 
Other brokers may charge a small fee.
To be successful with GTC orders, you need to know
 
✓ When you want to buy: In recent years, people have had a tendency 
to rush into buying a stock without giving some thought to what they 
could do to get more for their money. Some investors don’t realize that 
the stock market can be a place for bargain-hunting consumers. If you’re 
ready to buy a quality pair of socks for $16 in a department store but 
the sales clerk says that those same socks are going on sale tomorrow 
for only $8, what would you do — assuming that you’re a cost-conscious 
consumer? Unless you’re barefoot, you’re probably better off waiting. 
The same point holds true with stocks.

238
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
 
 Say that you want to buy SOX, Inc., at $26, but it’s currently trading at 
$30. You think that $30 is too expensive, but you’re happy to buy the 
stock at $26 or lower. However, you have no idea whether the stock will 
move to your desired price today, tomorrow, next week, or even next 
month (maybe never). In this case, a GTC order is appropriate.
 
✓ When you want to sell: What if you buy some socks at a department 
store and you discover that they have holes (darn it!)? Wouldn’t you 
want to get rid of them? Of course you would. If a stock’s price starts to 
unravel, you want to be able to get rid of it as well.
 
 Perhaps you already own SOX at $25 but are concerned that market 
conditions may drive the price lower. You’re not certain which way the 
stock will move in the coming days and weeks. In this case, a GTC order 
to sell the stock at a specified price is a suitable strategy. Because the 
stock price is $25, you may want to place a GTC order to sell it if it 
falls to $22.50, to prevent further losses. Again, in this example, GTC 
is the time frame, and it accompanies a condition (sell when the stock 
hits $22.50).
At your command: Condition-related 
orders
A condition-related order (also known as a conditional order) is an order 
that’s executed only when a certain condition is met. Conditional orders 
enhance your ability to buy stocks at a lower price, to sell at a better price, 
or to minimize potential losses. When stock markets become bearish or 
uncertain, conditional orders are highly recommended.
A good example of a conditional order is a limit order. A limit order may say, 
“Buy Mojeski Corp. at $45.” But if Mojeski Corp. isn’t at $45 (this price is the 
condition), then the order isn’t executed. I discuss limit orders, as well as 
market orders and stop orders, in the following sections.
Market orders
When you buy stock, the simplest type of order is a market order — an order 
to buy or sell a stock at the market’s current best available price. Orders 
don’t get any more basic than that. Here’s an example: Kowalski, Inc., is avail-
able at the market price of $10. When you call up your broker and instruct 
her to buy 100 shares “at the market,” the broker will implement the order 
for your account, and you pay $1,000 plus commission.

239
 Chapter 18: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques
 
I say “current best available price” because the stock’s price is constantly 
moving, and catching the best price can be a function of the broker’s ability to 
process the stock purchase. For very active stocks, the price change can 
happen within seconds. It’s not unheard of to have three brokers simultane-
ously place orders for the same stock and get three different prices because of 
differences in the brokers’ capabilities. (Some computers are faster than 
others.)
The advantage of a market order is that the transaction is processed imme-
diately, and you get your stock without worrying about whether it hits a par-
ticular price. For example, if you buy Kowalski, Inc., with a market order, you 
know that by the end of that phone call (or Web site visit), you’re assured of 
getting the stock. The disadvantage of a market order is that you can’t con-
trol the price of the stock. Whether you’re buying or selling your shares, you 
may not realize the exact price you expect (especially if you’re dealing with a 
volatile stock).
 
Market orders get finalized in the chronological order in which they’re placed. 
Your price may change because the orders ahead of you in line cause the 
stock price to rise or fall based on the latest news.
Stop-loss orders (also known as stop orders)
A stop-loss order (also called a stop order) is a condition-related order that 
instructs the broker to sell a particular stock in your portfolio only when the 
stock reaches a particular price. It acts like a trigger, and the stop order con-
verts to a market order to sell the stock immediately.
 
The stop-loss order isn’t designed to take advantage of small, short-term 
moves in the stock’s price. It’s meant to help you protect the bulk of your 
money when the market turns against your stock investment in a sudden 
manner.
Say that your Kowalski, Inc., stock rises to $20 per share and you seek to 
protect your investment against a possible future market decline. A stop-loss 
order at $18 triggers your broker to sell the stock immediately if it falls to the 
$18 mark. In this example, if the stock suddenly drops to $17, it still triggers 
the stop-loss order, but the finalized sale price is $17. In a volatile market, 
you may not be able to sell at your precise stop-loss price. However, because 
the order automatically gets converted into a market order, the sale will be 
done, and you prevent further declines in the stock.
The main benefit of a stop-loss order is that it prevents a major loss in a stock 
that you own. It’s a form of discipline that’s important in investing in order to 
minimize potential losses. Investors can find it agonizing to sell a stock that 
has fallen. If they don’t sell, however, the stock often continues to plummet as 
investors continue to hold on while hoping for a rebound in the price.

240
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
 
Most investors set a stop-loss amount at about 10 percent below the market 
value of the stock. This percentage gives the stock some room to fluctuate, 
which most stocks tend to do on a day-to-day basis.
Trailing stops
Trailing stops are an important technique in wealth preservation for sea-
soned stock investors and can be one of your key strategies in using stop-loss 
orders. A trailing stop is a stop-loss order that an investor actively manages 
by moving it up along with the stock’s market price. The stop-loss order 
“trails” the stock price upward. As the stop-loss goes upward, it protects 
more and more of the stock’s value from declining.
A real-life example may be the best way to help you understand trailing 
stops. Say that you bought Apple (AAPL) in April 2007 for about $90 per 
share. You would have seen AAPL soar to $200 by the end of 2007 — yup, 
that iPod would have brought tears to your eyes. If you had a trailing stop 
on your stock, it would not have been triggered as AAPL trended upward. 
However, AAPL peaked at that price and then zigzagged downward. Had you 
continued to do trailing stops along the way, the odds are that you would 
have been stopped out as AAPL started trending downward.
Practicing discipline with stop-loss orders
I have a stack of several years’ worth of invest-
ment newsletters in which investment experts 
made all sorts of calls regarding the prospects of 
a company, industry, or the economy in general. 
Some made forecasts that were spectacularly 
on target, but you should see the ones that were 
spectacularly wrong — ouch! However, even 
some of the winners suffered because of a lack 
of discipline. Those spectacular gains disap-
peared like balloons at a porcupine convention.
Some of the strongest recommendations made 
by newsletter experts in 2007 were finan-
cial stocks such as Bank of America (BAC). 
In November 2007, its stock traded at $48. 
However, BAC had much exposure to subprime 
debt and derivatives. Even if you didn’t know 
that, you still heard rumblings in the headlines 
about credit problems in the overall financial 
sector. Sometimes you don’t know a bank has 
bad debt in its financial picture until it goes bad. 
A wary investor would either stay away or at 
least play it safe if a stock like BAC were in the 
investor’s portfolio.
Fast forward to 2008. The credit and bank-
ing crises are in full bloom. BAC’s stock price 
plummets to $19 per share by October 2008. If 
an investor had placed a stop-loss order at, 
say, $43 (roughly 10 percent the original price of 
$48), he would have been saved from a free-fall. 
BAC hitting $19 means that in less than a year, it 
fell 60 percent. Right about now you know that 
some of those newsletter experts are in a new 
profession asking their clients, “Would you like 
those loafers in black or brown?”
Investing can be an emotional roller coaster. 
Keep your sanity and your profits by being dis-
ciplined. Use your stop-loss orders and fasten 
those seat belts.

241
 Chapter 18: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques
A trailing stop of, say, 10 percent would have been triggered at $180 in 
January (10 percent of the AAPL stock price of $200 equals $20, so the stock 
would have been sold at $180). By March 2008, AAPL stock hit $120 before sta-
bilizing and heading back up. With the trailing stop strategy continuously on, 
an AAPL investor buying at $90 (April 2007) would have realized a 100 percent 
gain when the stock was sold in January 2008 at $180. If the investor bought 
the stock again at the $120 level, she would have witnessed AAPL’s rise to 
$190 in the summer of 2008 before its painful descent back to under $90 in 
October 2008. Time to trade in that gadget for some antacids.
 
William O’Neill, founder and publisher of Investor’s Business Daily, advocates 
setting a trailing stop of 8 percent below your purchase price. That’s his pref-
erence. Some investors who invest in very volatile stocks may put in trailing 
stops of 20 or 25 percent. Is a stop-loss order desirable or advisable in every 
situation? No. It depends on your level of experience, your investment goals, 
and the market environment. Still, stop-loss orders are appropriate in most 
cases, especially if the market seems uncertain (or you do!).
 
A trailing stop is a stop-loss order that you actively manage. The stop-loss 
order is good-till-canceled (GTC), and it constantly trails the stock’s price as it 
moves up. To successfully implement trailing stops, you should
 
✓ Realize that brokers usually don’t place trailing stops for you automat-
ically. In fact, they won’t (or shouldn’t) place any type of order without 
your consent. Deciding on the type of order to place is your responsibil-
ity. You can raise, lower, or cancel a trailing stop order at will, but you 
need to monitor your investment when substantial moves do occur to 
respond to the movement appropriately.
 
✓ Change the stop-loss order when the stock price moves significantly. 
Hopefully, you won’t call your broker every time the stock moves 50 cents. 
Change the stop-loss order when the stock price moves around 10 percent. 
For example, if you initially purchase a stock at $90 per share, request the 
broker to place the stop-loss order at $81. When the stock moves to $100, 
cancel the $81 stop-loss order and replace it at $90. When the stock’s price 
moves to $110, change the stop-loss order to $99, and so on.
 
✓ Understand your broker’s policy on GTC orders. If your broker usually 
has a GTC order expire after 30 or 60 days, you should be aware of it. 
You don’t want to risk a sudden drop in your stock’s price without the 
stop-loss order protection. If your broker’s time limit is 60 days, note it 
so that you can renew the order for additional time.
 
✓ Monitor your stock. A trailing stop isn’t a “set it and forget it” technique. 
Monitoring your investment is critical. Of course, if the investment falls, 
the stop-loss order prevents further loss. Should the stock price rise sub-
stantially, remember to adjust your trailing stop accordingly. Keep raising 
the safety net as the stock continues to rise. Part of monitoring the stock 
is knowing the beta, which you can read more about in the next section.

242
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
Using beta measurement
To be a successful investor, you need to understand the volatility of the 
particular stock you invest in. In stock market parlance, this volatility is also 
called the beta of a stock. Beta is a quantitative measure of the volatility of a 
given stock (mutual funds and portfolios, too) relative to the overall market, 
usually the S&P 500 index. (For more information on the S&P 500, see Chapter 
5.) Beta specifically measures the performance movement of the stock as the 
S&P moves 1 percent up or down. A beta measurement above 1 is more vola-
tile than the overall market, while a beta below 1 is less volatile. Some stocks 
are relatively stable in the price movements; others jump around.
Because beta measures how volatile or unstable the stock’s price is, it tends 
to be uttered in the same breath as “risk” — more volatility indicates more 
risk. Similarly, less volatility tends to mean less risk.
 
You can find a company’s beta at Web sites that provide a lot of financial 
information about companies, such as Nasdaq (www.nasdaq.com) or Yahoo! 
Finance (finance.yahoo.com).
The beta is useful to know when it comes to stop-loss orders because it gives 
you a general idea of the stock’s trading range. If a stock is currently priced 
at $50 and it typically trades in the $48–$52 range, then a trailing stop at $49 
doesn’t make sense. Your stock would probably be sold the same day you 
initiated the stop-loss order. If your stock is a volatile growth stock that may 
swing up and down by 10 percent, you should more logically set your stop-
loss at 15 percent below that day’s price.
 
The stock of a large cap company in a mature industry tends to have a low 
beta — one close to the overall market. Small and mid cap stocks in new or 
emerging industries tend to have greater volatility in their day-to-day price 
fluctuations; hence, they tend to have a high beta. (You can find out more 
about large, small, and mid cap stocks in Chapter 1.)
Limit orders
A limit order is a very precise condition-related order implying that a limit 
exists either on the buy or the sell side of the transaction. You want to buy 
(or sell) only at a specified price or better. Period. Limit orders work well if 
you’re buying the stock, and they may not be good for you if you’re selling 
the stock. Here’s how they work in both instances:
 
✓ When you’re buying: Just because you like a particular company and 
you want its stock doesn’t mean that you’re willing to pay the current 
market price. Maybe you want to buy Kowalski, Inc., but the current 
market price of $20 per share isn’t acceptable to you. You prefer to buy 
it at $16 because you think that price reflects its true market value. What 

243
 Chapter 18: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques
do you do? You tell your broker, “Buy Kowalski with a limit order at $16” 
(or you can enter a limit order at the broker’s Web site). You have to 
specify whether it’s a day order or a GTC order, both of which I discuss 
earlier in this chapter.
 
 What happens if the stock experiences great volatility? What if it drops 
to $16.01 and then suddenly drops to $15.95 on the next move? Nothing 
happens, actually, which you may be dismayed to hear. Because your 
order was limited to $16, it can be transacted only at $16 — no more or 
less. The only way for this particular trade to occur is if the stock rises 
back to $16. However, if the price keeps dropping, then your limit order 
isn’t transacted and may expire or be canceled.
  
 When you’re buying a stock, most brokers interpret the limit order as 
“buy at this specific price or better.” Presumably, if your limit order is 
to buy the stock at $10, you’ll be just as happy if your broker buys that 
stock at $9.95. That way, if you don’t get exactly $10 because the stock’s 
price was volatile, you’ll still get the stock at a lower price. Talk to your 
broker to be clear on the meaning of the limit order.
 
✓ When you’re selling: Limit orders are activated only when a stock hits 
a specific price. If you buy Kowalski, Inc., at $20 and you worry about a 
decline in the share price, you may decide to put in a limit order at $18. 
If you watch the news and hear that Kowalski’s price is dropping, you 
may sigh and say, “I sure am glad that I put in that limit order at $18!” 
However, in a volatile market, the share price may leapfrog over your 
specified price. It could go from $18.01 to $17.99 and then continue its 
descent. Because the stock price never hit $18 on the mark, it isn’t sold. 
You may be sitting at home satisfied (mistakenly) that you played it 
smart, while your stock plummets to $15 or $10 or worse! Having a stop-
loss order in place is best.
 
 Investors who aren’t in a hurry can use a limit order to try to get a better 
price when they decide to sell. For example, maybe you own a stock 
whose price is at $50 and you want to sell, but you think that a short-
term rally in the stock is imminent. In that case, you can use a limit 
order such as, “Sell the stock at the sell limit order of $55 and keep the 
order on for 30 days.”
The joys of technology: Advanced orders
Brokers have added sophisticated capabilities to the existing repertoire of 
orders that are available for stock investors. One example is advanced orders, 
which provide investors with a way to use a combination of orders for more 
sophisticated trades. An example of an advanced order is something like, 
“Only sell stock B, and if it sells, use the proceeds to buy stock D.” You get 

244
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
the idea. My brokerage firm has the following on its Web site, and I’m sure 
that more firms will do the same. Inquire with yours and see the benefit of 
using advanced orders such as the following:
 
✓ “One Order Cancels Another Order”: This happens when you enter two 
orders simultaneously with the condition that if one order is executed, 
the second order is automatically cancelled.
 
✓ “One Order Triggers Another Order”: Here you submit an order, and if 
that order is filled, another order is automatically submitted. Many bro-
kers have different names for these types of orders, so ask them if they 
can provide such an order.
Other types of advanced orders are available, but you get the picture. Talk to 
your brokerage firm and find out what’s available in your particular account. 
Investors need to know that today’s technology allows them to have more 
power and control over the implementation of buying and selling transac-
tions. I love it!
Buying on Margin
Buying on margin means buying securities, such as stocks, with funds you 
borrow from your broker. Buying stock on margin is similar to buying a 
house with a mortgage. If you buy a house at a purchase price of $100,000 
and put 10 percent down, your equity (the part you own) is $10,000, and you 
borrow the remaining $90,000 with a mortgage. If the value of the house rises 
to $120,000 and you sell (for the sake of simplicity, I don’t include closing 
costs in this example), you make a profit of 200 percent. How is that? The 
$20,000 gain on the property represents a gain of 20 percent on the purchase 
price of $100,000, but because your real investment is $10,000 (the down pay-
ment), your gain works out to 200 percent (a gain of $20,000 on your initial 
investment of $10,000).
 
Buying on margin is an example of using leverage to maximize your gain when 
prices rise. Leverage is simply using borrowed money when you make an asset 
purchase in order to increase your potential profit. This type of leverage is 
great in a favorable (bull) market, but it works against you in an unfavorable 
(bear) market. Say that a $100,000 house you purchase with a $90,000 mort-
gage falls in value to $80,000 (and property values can decrease during eco-
nomic hard times). Your outstanding debt of $90,000 exceeds the value of the 
property. Because you owe more than you own, you’re left with a negative net 
worth.
Leverage is a double-edged sword. Don’t forget that you need approval from 
your brokerage firm before you can go short.

245
 Chapter 18: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques
Examining marginal outcomes
Suppose that you think that the stock for the company Mergatroid, Inc., cur-
rently at $40 per share, will go up in value. You want to buy 100 shares, but 
you have only $2,000. What can you do? If you’re intent on buying 100 shares 
(versus simply buying the 50 shares that you have cash for), you can borrow 
the additional $2,000 from your broker on margin. If you do that, what are the 
potential outcomes?
If the stock price goes up
This outcome is the best for you. If Mergatroid goes to $50 per share, your 
investment is worth $5,000, and your outstanding margin loan is $2,000. If 
you sell, the total proceeds will pay off the loan and leave you with $3,000. 
Because your initial investment was $2,000, your profit is a solid 50 percent 
because your $2,000 principal amount generated a $1,000 profit. (For the sake 
of this example, I leave out any charges, such as commissions and interest 
paid on the margin loan.) However, if you pay the entire $4,000 upfront with-
out the margin loan, your $4,000 investment generates a profit of $1,000, or 25 
percent. Using margin, you double the return on your money.
 
Leverage, when used properly, is very profitable. However, it’s still debt, 
so understand that you must pay it off eventually, regardless of the stock’s 
performance.
If the stock price fails to rise
If the stock goes nowhere, you still have to pay interest on that margin loan. 
If the stock pays dividends, this money can defray some of the margin loan’s 
cost. In other words, dividends can help you pay off what you borrow from 
the broker.
Having the stock neither rise nor fall may seem like a neutral situation, but 
you pay interest on your margin loan with each passing day. For this reason, 
margin trading can be a good consideration for conservative investors if the 
stock pays a high dividend. Many times, a high dividend from $5,000 worth 
of stock can exceed the margin interest you have to pay from the $2,500 (50 
percent) you borrow from the broker to buy that stock.
 
If the stock price goes down, buying on margin can work against you. What 
if Mergatroid goes to $38 per share? The market value of 100 shares is then 
$3,800, but your equity shrinks to only $1,800 because you have to pay your 
$2,000 margin loan. You’re not exactly looking at a disaster at this point, but 
you’d better be careful, because the margin loan exceeds 50 percent of your 
stock investment. If it goes any lower, you may get the dreaded margin call, 
when the broker actually contacts you to ask you to restore the ratio between 
the margin loan and the value of the securities. See the following section for 
information about appropriate debt to equity ratios.

246
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
Maintaining your balance
 
When you purchase stock on margin, you must maintain a balanced ratio of 
margin debt to equity of at least 50 percent. If the debt portion exceeds this 
limit, you’re required to restore that ratio by depositing either more stock or 
more cash into your brokerage account. The additional stock you deposit can 
be stock that’s transferred from another account.
To continue the example from the previous section: If Mergatroid goes to $28 
per share, the margin loan portion exceeds 50 percent of the equity value in 
that stock — in this case, because the market value of your stock is $2,800 
but the margin loan is still at $2,000, the margin loan is a worrisome 71 per-
cent of the market value ($2,000 divided by $2,800 = 71 percent). Expect to 
get a call from your broker to put more securities or cash into the account to 
restore the 50 percent balance.
If you can’t come up with more stock, other securities, or cash, the next step 
is to sell stock from the account and use the proceeds to pay off the margin 
loan. For you, that means realizing a capital loss — you lost money on your 
investment.
 
The Federal Reserve Board governs margin requirements for brokers with 
Regulation T. Discuss this rule with your broker to understand fully your (and 
the broker’s) risks and obligations. Regulation T dictates margin requirements 
set by brokers for their customers. For most listed stocks, it’s 50 percent.
Striving for success on margin
Margin, as you can see from the previous sections, can escalate your profits 
on the up side but magnify your losses on the down side. If your stock plum-
mets drastically, you can end up with a margin loan that exceeds the market 
value of the stock you used the loan to purchase. In the emerging bear 
market of 2000–2002, stock losses hurt many people, and a large number of 
those losses were made worse because people didn’t manage the responsi-
bilities involved with margin trading. In 2008, margin debt hit record highs, 
which means that investors may (again!) be at risk.
 
If you buy stock on margin, use a disciplined approach. Be extra careful when 
using leverage, such as a margin loan, because it can backfire. Keep the follow-
ing points in mind:

247
 Chapter 18: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques
 
✓ Have ample reserves of cash or marginable securities in your account. 
Try to keep the margin ratio at 40 percent or less to minimize the chance 
of a margin call.
 
✓ If you’re a beginner, consider using margin to buy stock in large com-
panies that have a relatively stable price and pay a good dividend. 
Some people buy income stocks that have dividend yields that exceed 
the margin interest rate, meaning that the stock ends up paying for its 
own margin loan. Just remember those stop orders.
 
✓ Constantly monitor your stocks. If the market turns against you, the 
result will be especially painful if you use margin.
 
✓ Have a payback plan for your margin debt. Taking margin loans 
against your investments means that you’re paying interest. Your ulti-
mate goal is to make money, and paying interest eats into your profits.
Going Short and Coming Out Ahead
The vast majority of stock investors are familiar with buying stock, hold-
ing onto it for a while, and hoping its value goes up. This kind of thinking is 
called going long, and investors who go long are considered to be long on 
stocks. Going long essentially means that you’re bullish and seeking your 
profits from rising prices. However, astute investors also profit in the market 
when stock prices fall. Going short (also called shorting a stock, selling short, 
or doing a short sale) on a stock is a common technique for profiting from a 
stock price decline. Investors have made big profits during bear markets by 
going short. A short sale is a bet that a particular stock is going down.
Most people easily understand making money by going long. It boils down 
to “buy low and sell high.” Piece of cake. Going short means making money 
by selling high and then buying low. Huh? Thinking in reverse isn’t a piece of 
cake. Although thinking of this stock adage in reverse may be challenging, the 
mechanics of going short are really simple. Consider an example that uses a 
fictitious company called DOA, Inc. As a stock, DOA ($50 per share) is look-
ing pretty sickly. It has lots of debt and plummeting sales and earnings, and 
the news is out that DOA’s industry will face hard times for the foreseeable 
future. This situation describes a stock that’s an ideal candidate for shorting. 
The future may be bleak for DOA, but it’s promising for savvy investors.
 
To go short, you have to be deemed (by your broker) creditworthy — your 
account needs to be approved for short selling. When you’re approved for 
margin trading, you’re probably set to sell short, too. Talk to your broker (or 
check for this information on the broker’s Web site) about limitations in your 
account regarding going short.

248
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
 
You must understand brokerage rules before you conduct short selling. The 
broker must approve you for it (see Chapter 7 for information on working with 
brokers), and you must meet the minimum collateral requirement, which is 
typically $2,000 or 50 percent of the shorted stock’s market value. If the stock 
generates dividends, those dividends are paid to the stock’s owner, not to the 
person who borrows it to go short. Check with your broker for complete 
details, and review the resources in Appendix A.
 
Because going short on stocks has greater risks than going long, I strongly 
advise beginning investors to avoid shorting stocks until they become more 
seasoned.
Setting up a short sale
This section explains how to go short. Say that you believe that DOA is the 
right stock to short — you’re pretty sure its price is going to fall. With DOA 
at $50, you instruct your broker to “go short 100 shares on DOA.” (It doesn’t 
have to be 100 shares; I’m just using that as an example.) Here’s what hap-
pens next:
 
1. Your broker borrows 100 shares of DOA stock, either from his own 
inventory or from another client or broker.
 
 That’s right. The stock can be borrowed from a client, no permission 
necessary. The broker guarantees the transaction, and the client/stock 
owner never has to be informed about it because he never loses legal 
and beneficial right to the stock. You borrow 100 shares, and you’ll 
return 100 shares when it’s time to complete the transaction.
 
2. Your broker then sells the stock and puts the money in your account.
 
 Your account is credited with $5,000 (100 shares × $50) in cash — the 
money gained from selling the borrowed stock. This cash acts like a loan 
on which you’re going to have to pay interest.
 
3. You buy the stock back and return it to its rightful owner.
 
 When it’s time to close the transaction (either you want to close it or the 
owner of the shares wants to sell them, so you have to give them back), 
you must return the number of shares you borrowed (in this case, it was 
100 shares). If you buy back the 100 shares at $40 per share (remember 
that you shorted this particular stock because you were sure its price 
was going to fall) and those 100 shares are returned to their owner, you 
make a $1,000 profit. (To keep the example tidy, I don’t include broker-
age commissions.)

249
 Chapter 18: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques
Oops! Going short when prices grow taller
 
I bet you guessed that the wonderful profitability of selling short has a flip 
side. Say that you were wrong about DOA and that the stock price rises from 
the ashes as it goes from $50 to $87. Now what? You still have to return the 
100 shares you borrowed. With the stock’s price at $87, that means you have 
to buy the stock for $8,700 (100 shares at the new, higher price of $87). Ouch! 
How do you pay for it? Well, you have that original $5,000 in your account 
from when you initially went short on the stock. But where do you get the 
other $3,700 ($8,700 less the original $5,000)? You guessed it — your pocket! 
You have to cough up the difference. If the stock continues to rise, that’s a lot 
of coughing.
How much money do you lose if the stock goes to $100 or more? A heck of a 
lot. As a matter of fact, there’s no limit to how much you can lose. That’s why 
going short can be riskier than going long. When going long, the most you can 
lose is 100 percent of your money. When you go short, however, you can lose 
more than 100 percent of the money you invest. Yikes!
 
Because the potential for loss is unlimited when you short a stock, I sug-
gest that you use a stop order (also called a buy-stop order) to minimize the 
damage. Better yet, make it a good-till-canceled (GTC) order, which I discuss 
earlier in this chapter. You can set the stop order at a given price, and if the 
stock hits that price, you buy the stock back so that you can return it to its 
owner before the price rises even higher. You still lose money, but you limit 
your losses.
The uptick rule
For many years, the stock market had some-
thing called “the uptick rule.” This rule stated 
that you could enter into a short sale only when 
the stock had just completed an uptick. “Tick” 
in this case means the actual incremental price 
movement of the stock you’re shorting. For a 
$10 stock that was just $9.95 a moment ago, the 
5-cent difference represents an uptick. If the 
$10 stock was just $10.10 a moment before, the 
10-cent difference is a downtick. The amount of 
the tick doesn’t matter. So, if you short a stock 
at the price of $40, the immediate prior price 
must have been $39.99 or lower. The reason 
for this rule (a Federal Reserve regulation) is 
that short selling can aggravate declining stock 
prices in a rapidly falling market. In practice, 
going short on a stock whose price is already 
declining can make the stock price fall even far-
ther. Excessive short selling can make the stock 
more volatile than it would be otherwise.
In 2007, however, the uptick rule was removed. 
This has contributed to the increased volatil-
ity that investors have seen during 2007–2008. 
Investors have to adapt accordingly. This 
means getting used to wider swings in stock 
price movements on days of heavy activity.

250
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
Feeling the squeeze
If you go short on a stock, you have to buy that stock back sooner or later so 
that you can return it to its owner. What happens when a lot of people are 
short on a particular stock and its price starts to rise? All those short sellers 
are scrambling to buy the stock back so that they can close their transac-
tions before they lose too much money. This mass buying quickens the pace 
of the stock’s ascent and puts a squeeze (called a short squeeze) on the inves-
tors who’ve been shorting the stock.
Earlier in this chapter, I explain that your broker can borrow stock from 
another client so that you can go short on it. What happens when that client 
wants to sell the stock in her account — the stock that you borrowed and 
which is therefore no longer in her account? When that happens, your broker 
asks you to return the borrowed stock. That’s when you feel the squeeze — 
you have to buy the stock back at the current price.
 
Going short can be a great maneuver in a declining (bear) market, but it can 
be brutal if the stock price goes up. If you’re a beginner, stay away from short 
selling until you have enough experience (and money) to risk it.

Getting a Handle on DPPs, 
DRPs, and DCA . . . PDQ
In This Chapter
▶ Buying stock directly from a company
▶ Looking at dividend reinvestment plans
▶ Using dollar cost averaging
W
ho says you must buy 100 shares of a stock to invest? Do you really 
have to go through a broker to buy stock, or can you buy direct? 
What if you only want to put your toe in the water and buy just one share for 
starters? Can you do that without paying through the nose for transaction 
costs, such as commissions?
The answer to these questions is that you can buy stocks directly (without a 
broker) and save money in the process. That’s what this chapter is about. In 
this chapter, I show you how direct purchase programs (DPPs) and dividend 
reinvestment plans (DRPs) make a lot of sense for long-term stock investors, 
and I show how you can do them on your own — no broker necessary. I also 
show you how to use the method of dollar cost averaging (DCA) to acquire 
stock, a technique that works especially well with DRPs. All these programs 
are well-suited for people who like to invest small sums of money and plan on 
doing so consistently in the same stock (or stocks) over a long period of time.
 
Don’t invest in a company just because it has a DPP or DRP. DPPs and DRPs 
are simply a means for getting into a particular stock with very little money. 
They shouldn’t be a substitute for doing diligent research and analysis on a 
particular stock.

252
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
Being Direct with DPPs
If you’re going to buy a stock anyway, why not buy it directly from the com-
pany and bypass the broker (and commissions) altogether? Several hundred 
companies now offer direct purchase programs (DPPs), also called DIPs (or 
direct investment programs), which give investors an opportunity to buy 
stock directly from these companies. In the following sections, I explain the 
steps required for investing in a DPP, describe alternatives to DPPs, and warn 
you of a few minor DPP drawbacks.
 
DPPs give investors the opportunity to buy stock with little upfront money 
(usually enough to cover the purchase of one share) and usually no com-
missions. Why do companies give investors this opportunity? For their sake, 
they want to encourage more attention and participation from investors. For 
your purposes, however, a DPP gives you what you may need most: a low-
cost entry into that particular company’s dividend reinvestment plan, or DRP 
(which you can read more about in the section “Dipping into DRPs,” later in 
this chapter).
Investing in a DPP
If you have your sights set on a particular company and have only a few bucks 
to start out, a DPP is probably the best way to make your initial investment. 
The following steps guide you toward your first stock purchase using a DPP:
 
1. Decide what stock you want to invest in (I explain how to do so in 
Parts II and III) and find the company’s contact information.
 
 Say that you do your homework and decide to invest in Yumpin 
Yimminy Corp. (YYC). You can get YYC’s contact information through 
the stock exchange YYC trades on. For example, if YYC trades on the 
New York Stock Exchange, you can call the NYSE and ask for YYC’s con-
tact information, or you can visit the NYSE Web site (www.nyse.com). 
So, you can contact NYSE to reach YYC for its DPP ASAP. OK?
 
2. Find out whether YYC has a DPP (before it’s DOA! OK?).
 
 Call YYC’s shareholder services department and ask whether it has a 
DPP. If it does, great; if it doesn’t, ask whether it plans to start one. At 
the very least, it may have a DRP. If you prefer, check out the company’s 
Web site, because most corporate Web sites have plenty of information 
on their stock purchase programs.

253
 Chapter 19: Getting a Handle on DPPs, DRPs, and DCA . . . PDQ
 
3. Look into enrolling.
 
 The company will send you an application along with a prospectus — 
the program document that serves as a brochure and, hopefully, answers 
your basic questions. Usually, the enrollment forms are downloadable 
from the company’s Web site.
 
 The processing is typically handled by an organization that the company 
designates (the plan administrator). From this point forward, you’re in 
the dividend reinvestment plan.
Finding DPP alternatives
Although several hundred companies offer DPPs, the majority of companies 
don’t. What if you want to invest in a company directly and it doesn’t have a 
DPP? The following sections present some alternatives.
Buy your first share through a broker to qualify for DRPs
Yes, buying your first share through a broker costs you a commission; how-
ever, after you make the purchase, you can contact that company’s share-
holder services department and ask about its DRP. After you’re an existing 
stockholder, qualifying for the DRP is a piece of cake.
 
To qualify for the DRP, you must be on the book of record with the transfer 
agent. A book of record is simply the database the company uses to track 
every single outstanding share of stock and the stock’s owner. The transfer 
agent is the person or organization responsible for maintaining the database. 
Whenever stock is bought or sold, the transfer agent must implement the 
change and update the records. In many cases, you must have the broker 
issue a stock certificate in your name after you own the stock. This is the most 
common way to get your name on the book of record, hence qualifying you for 
the DRP.
 
Sometimes, simply buying the stock isn’t enough to get your name on the 
book of record. Although you technically and legally own the stock, brokers, 
for ease of transaction, often keep the stock in your account under what’s 
referred to as a street name. (For instance, your name may be Jane Smith, but 
the street name could be the broker’s firm name, such as Jones & Co., simply 
for administrative purposes.) Having the stock in a street name really doesn’t 
mean much to you until you want to qualify for the company’s DPP or DRP. 
Remember to address this point with your broker.

254
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
Get started in a DRP directly through a broker
These days, more brokers offer the features of the DRP (like compounding 
interest) right in the brokerage account itself, which is more convenient than 
going to the trouble of setting up a DRP with the company directly. This ser-
vice is most likely a response to the growing number of long-term investors 
who have fled traditional brokerage accounts for the benefits of direct invest-
ing that DPPs and DRPs offer.
 
The main drawback of a broker-run DRP is that it doesn’t usually allow you to 
make stock purchases through optional cash payments without commission 
charges (a big negative!). See the section “Building wealth with optional cash 
payments,” later in this chapter, for more on this topic.
Purchase shares via alternate buying services
Organizations have set up services to help small investors buy stock in small 
quantities. The primary drawback to these middlemen is that you’ll probably 
pay more in transaction costs than you would if you approached the com-
panies directly. Check out the most prominent services, which include the 
following:
 
✓ First Share at www.firstshare.com
 
✓ Money Paper at www.directinvesting.com
 
✓ National Association of Investors Corporation at www.better
investing.org
 
✓ ShareBuilder at www.sharebuilder.com
Recognizing the drawbacks
As beneficial as DPPs are, they do have some minor drawbacks (doesn’t 
everything?). Keep the following points in mind when considering DPPs as 
part of your stock portfolio:
 
✓ Although more and more companies are starting to offer DPPs, relatively 
few (approximately 500) companies have them.
 
✓ Some DPPs require a high initial amount to invest (as much as $250 or 
more) or a commitment of monthly investments. In any case, ask the 
plan administrator about the investing requirements.
 
✓ A growing number of DPPs have some type of service charge. This 
charge is usually very modest and lower than typical brokerage commis-
sions. Ask about all the incidents — such as getting into the plan, getting 
out, and so on — that may trigger a service charge.

255
 Chapter 19: Getting a Handle on DPPs, DRPs, and DCA . . . PDQ
Dipping into DRPs
Sometimes, dividend reinvestment plans (DRPs) are called “DRIPs,” which 
makes me scratch my head. “Reinvestment” is one word, not two, so where 
does that “I” come from? But I digress. Whether you call them DRIPs or DRPs, 
they’re great for small investors and people who are truly long-term investors 
in a particular stock. A company may offer a DRP to allow investors to accu-
mulate more shares of its stock without paying commissions.
A DRP has two primary advantages:
 
✓ Compounding: The dividends (cash payments to shareholders) get rein-
vested and give you the opportunity to buy more stock.
 
✓ Optional cash payments (OCPs): Most DRPs give participants the ability 
to invest through the plan to purchase more stock, usually with no com-
missions. Some DRPs have the OCP minimum for as little as $25.
 
Here are the requirements to be in a DRP:
 
✓ You must already be a stockholder of that particular stock
 
✓ The stock must be paying dividends (you had to guess this one!)
In the following sections, I go into more detail on compounding and OCPs, 
explain the cost advantages of using DRPs, and warn you of a few drawbacks.
Getting a clue about compounding
Dividends are reinvested, offering a form of compounding for the small inves-
tor. Dividends buy more shares, in turn generating more dividends. Usually, 
the dividends don’t buy entire shares but fractional ones.
For example, say that you own 20 shares of Fraction Corp. at $10 per share 
for a total value of $200. Fraction Corp.’s annual dividend is $1, meaning that 
a quarterly dividend of 25 cents is issued every three months. What happens 
if this stock is in the DRP? The 20 shares generate a $5 dividend payout in the 
first quarter (20 shares × 25 cents), and this amount is applied to the stock 
purchase as soon as it’s credited to the DRP account. If you presume for this 
example that the stock price doesn’t change, the DRP has 20.50 total shares 
valued at $205 (20.50 shares × $10 share price). The dividend payout isn’t 
enough to buy an entire share, so it buys a fractional share and credits that 
to the account.

256
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
Now say that three months pass and that no other shares have been acquired 
since your prior dividend payout. Fraction Corp. issues another quarterly 
dividend for 25 cents per share. Now what?
 
✓ The original 20 shares generate a $5 dividend payout.
 
✓ The .50, or half share, in the account generates a 12.5-cent dividend (half 
the dividend of a full share because it’s only half a share).
 
✓ The total dividend payout is $5.125 (rounded to $5.13), and the new total 
of shares in the account is 21.13 shares (the former 20.50 shares plus 
.625 shares purchased by the dividend payout and rounded off; the .625 
fraction was gained by the cash from the dividends). Full shares gener-
ate full dividends, and fractional shares generate fractional dividends.
 
To illustrate my point easily, the preceding example uses a price that doesn’t 
fluctuate. In reality, stock in a DRP acts like any other stock — the share price 
changes constantly. Every time the DRP makes a stock purchase, whether it’s 
monthly or quarterly, the purchase price will likely be different.
Building wealth with optional 
cash payments
Most DRPs (unless they’re run by a broker) give the participant the opportu-
nity to make optional cash payments (OCPs), which are payments you send 
in to purchase more stock in the DRP. DRPs usually establish a minimum and 
a maximum payment. The minimum is typically very modest, such as $25 or 
$50. A few plans even have no minimum. This feature makes it very affordable 
to regularly invest modest amounts and build up a sizable portfolio of stock 
in a short period of time, unencumbered by commissions.
DRPs also have a maximum investment limitation, such as specifying that 
DRP participants can’t invest more than $10,000 per year. For most investors, 
the maximum isn’t a problem because few would typically invest that much 
anyway. However, consult with the plan’s administrator, because all plans 
are a little different.
 
OCPs are probably the most advantageous aspect of a DRP. If you can invest 
$25 to $50 per month consistently, year after year, at no (or little) cost, you 
may find that doing so is a superb way to build wealth.

Checking out the cost advantages
In spite of the fact that more and more DRPs are charging service fees, DRPs 
are still an economical way to invest, especially for small investors. The big 
savings come from not paying commissions. Although many DPPs and DRPs 
do have charges, they tend to be relatively small (but keep track of them, 
because the costs can add up).
 
Some DRPs actually offer a discount of between 2 percent and 5 percent (a 
few are higher) when buying stock through the plan. Others offer special pro-
grams and discounts on the company’s products and services. Some compa-
nies offer the service of debiting your checking account or paycheck to invest 
in the DRP. One company offered its shareholders significant discounts to its 
restaurant subsidiary. In any case, ask the plan administrator because any 
plus is . . . well . . . a plus.
Moving money out of DRPs to pay off debt
DRPs are a great way to accumulate a large 
stock holding over an extended period of time. 
Moreover, think about what you can do with this 
stock. Say you accumulate 110 shares of stock, 
valued at $50 per share, in your DRP. You can, 
for example, take out $5,000 worth of stock (100 
shares at $50 per share) and place those 100 
shares in your brokerage account. The remain-
ing 10 shares can stay in your account to keep 
the DRP and continue with dividend reinvest-
ment to keep your wealth growing. Why remove 
those shares?
All things being equal, you’re better off keeping 
the stock in the DRP, but what if you have $2,500 
in credit card debt and don’t have extra cash to 
pay off that debt? Brokerage accounts still have 
plenty of advantages, such as, in this example, 
the use of margin (a topic I discuss in detail in 
Chapter 18). If your situation merits it, you can 
borrow up to 50 percent of the $5,000, or $2,500, 
as a margin loan and use it to pay off that credit 
card debt. Because you’re replacing unsecured 
debt (credit card debt that may be charging 15 
percent, 18 percent, or more) with secured 
debt, you can save a lot of money (borrowing 
against stock in a brokerage account is usually 
cheaper than credit card debt). Another benefit 
is that the margin loan with your broker doesn’t 
require monthly payments, as do the credit card 
balances. Additionally, ask your tax consultant 
about potential tax benefits — investment inter-
est expense is deductible, but consumer credit 
card debt is not.

Weighing the pros with the cons
When you’re in a DRP, you reap all the benefits of stock investing. You get an 
annual report, and you qualify for stock splits, dividend increases, and so on. 
But you must be aware of the risks and responsibilities.
 
So before you start to salivate over all the goodies that come with DRPs, be 
clear-eyed about some of the negative aspects to them as well. Those negative 
aspects include:
 
✓ You need to get that first share, because that’s what’s most necessary to 
get the DRP started (but you knew that).
 
✓ Even small fees cut into your profits.
 
✓ Many DRPs may not have certain types of services, such as Individual 
Retirement Accounts (IRAs). (Chapter 21 offers more information on IRAs.)
 
✓ DRPs are designed for long-term investing. Although getting in and out 
of the plan is easy, the transactions may take weeks to process because 
stock purchases and sales are typically done all at once on a certain day 
of the month (or quarter).
 
✓ You need to read the prospectus. You may not consider this a negative 
point, but for some people, reading a prospectus is not unlike giving blood 
by using leeches. Even if that’s your opinion, you need to read the prospec-
tus to avoid any surprises, such as hidden fees or unreasonable terms.
 
✓ You must understand the tax issues. There, ya see? I knew I’d ruin it for 
you. Just know that dividends, whether or not they occur in a DRP, are 
usually taxable (unless the DRP is in an IRA, which is a different matter). 
I cover tax issues in detail in Chapter 21.
 
✓ You need to keep good records. Keep all your statements together and 
use a good spreadsheet program or accounting program if you plan on 
doing a lot of DRP investing. These records are especially important at 
tax time, when you have to report any subsequent gains or losses from 
stock sales. Because capital gains taxes can be complicated as you sort 
out short term versus long term, DRP calculations can be a nightmare 
without good record-keeping.
The One-Two Punch: Dollar Cost 
Averaging and DRPs
Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is a splendid technique for buying stock and 
lowering your cost for doing so. The example in Table 19-1 shows that it’s 
not uncommon for investors to see a total cost that reflects a discount to the 
market value. DCA works especially well with DRPs.

259
 Chapter 19: Getting a Handle on DPPs, DRPs, and DCA . . . PDQ
 
DCA is a simple method for acquiring stock. It rests on the idea that you invest 
a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (monthly, usually) over a long 
period of time in a particular stock. Because a fixed amount (say, $50 per 
month) is going into a fluctuating investment, you end up buying less of that 
stock when it goes up in price and more of it when it goes down in price. Your 
average cost per share is usually lower than if you buy all the shares at once.
DCA is best presented with an example. Say you decide to get into the DRP 
of the company Acme Elevator, Inc. (AE). On your first day in the DRP, AE’s 
stock is at $25, and the plan allows you to invest a minimum of $25 through 
its optional cash purchase (OCP) program. You decide to invest $25 per 
month and assess how well (hopefully) you’re doing six months from now. 
Table 19-1 shows how this technique works.

To assess the wisdom of your decision to invest in the DRP, ask yourself 
some questions:
 
✓ How much did you invest over the entire six months? Your total 
investment is $150. So far, so good.
 
✓ What’s the first share price for AE, and what’s the last share price? 
The first share price is $25, but the last share price is $20.
 
✓ What’s the market value of your investment at the end of six months? 
You can easily calculate the value of your investment. Just multiply the 
number of shares you now own (8.03 shares) by the most recent share 
price ($20). The total value of your investment is $160.60.
 
✓ What’s the average share price you bought at? The average share price 
is also easy to calculate. Take the total amount of your purchases ($150) 
and divide it by the number of shares you acquired (8.03 shares). Your 
average cost per share is $18.68.

260
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
Be sure to take note of the following:
 
✓ Even though the last share price ($20) is lower than the original share 
price ($25), your total investment’s market value is still higher than your 
purchase amount ($160.60 compared to $150)! How can that be?! Dollar 
cost averaging is the culprit here. Your disciplined approach (using 
DCA) overcame the fluctuations in the stock price to help you gain more 
shares at the lower prices of $17.50 and $15.
 
✓ Your average cost per share is only $18.68. The DCA method helped 
you buy more shares at a lower cost, which ultimately helped you make 
money when the stock price made a modest rebound.
 
DCA works in helping you invest with small sums, all the while helping you 
smooth out the volatility in stock prices. This helps you make more money 
in your wealth-building program over the long haul. The bottom line for long-
term stock investors is that DCA is a solid investing technique and DRPs are 
a great stock investment vehicle for building wealth. Can you visualize that 
retirement hammock yet?
 
Dollar cost averaging is a fantastic technique in a bull market and an okay 
technique in a flat or sideways market, but it’s really not a good consideration 
during bear markets because the stock you’re buying is going down in price 
and the market value can very easily be lower than your total investment. If 
you plan on holding onto the stock long term, then simply cease your dollar 
cost averaging approach until times improve for the stock (and its industry, 
and the economy). Learn more about industries in Chapter 13 and general 
economics in Chapter 10.

I
magine that you’re boarding a cruise ship, ready to enjoy a hard-earned 
vacation. As you merrily walk up the plank, you notice that the ship’s 
captain and crew are charging out of the vessel, flailing their arms, and 
screaming at the top of their lungs. Some are even jumping into the water 
below. Quiz: Would you get on that ship? You get double credit if you can 
also explain why (or why not).
What does this scenario have to do with stock investing? Plenty. The behav-
ior of the people running the boat gives you important clues about the near-
term prospects for the boat. Similarly, the actions of company insiders can 
provide important clues into the near-term prospects for their company.
Company insiders are key managers or investors in the company. Insiders 
include the president of the company, the treasurer, or another managing 
officer. An insider can also be someone who owns a large stake in the com-
pany or someone on the board of directors. In any case, insiders usually have 
a bird’s-eye view of what’s going on with the company and a good idea of 
how well (or how poorly) the company is doing.
In this chapter, I describe different kinds of insider activities, such as 
insider buying, insider selling, corporate stock buybacks, and stock splits. 
I also show you how to keep track of these activities with the help of a few 
resources.

262
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
 
Keep tabs on what insiders are doing, because their buy/sell transactions do 
have a strong correlation to the near-term movement of their company’s 
stock. However, don’t buy or sell stock only because you heard that some 
insider did. Use the information on insider trading to confirm your own good 
sense in buying or selling stock. Insider trading sometimes can be a great pre-
cursor to a significant move that you can profit from if you know what to look 
for. Many shrewd investors have made their profits (or avoided losses) by 
tracking the activity of the insiders.
Tracking Insider Trading
Fortunately, we live in an age of disclosure. Insiders who buy or sell stock 
must file reports that document their trading activity with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC), which makes the documents available to the 
public. You can view these documents at either a regional SEC office (see 
www.sec.gov/contact/addresses.htm) or on the SEC’s Web site, which 
maintains the EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) 
database (www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml). Just click on the “Search for 
Company Filings” button. Some of the most useful documents you can view 
there include the following:
 
✓ Form 3: This form is the initial statement that insiders provide. They 
must file Form 3 within ten days of obtaining insider status. An insider 
files this report even if he hasn’t made a purchase yet; the report estab-
lishes the insider’s status.
 
✓ Form 4: This document shows the insider’s activity, such as a change 
in the insider’s position as stockholder — how many shares the person 
bought and sold or other relevant changes. Any activity in a particular 
month must be reported on Form 4 by the 10th of the following month.
 
✓ Form 5: This annual report covers transactions that are small and not 
required on Form 4, such as minor, internal transfers of stock.
 
✓ Form 144: This form serves as the public declaration by an insider 
of the intention to sell restricted stock — stock that the insider was 
awarded, or received from the company as compensation, or bought as 
a term of employment. Insiders must hold restricted stock for at least 
one year before they can sell it. After an insider decides to sell, she files 
Form 144 and then must sell within 90 days or submit a new Form 144. 
The insider must file the form on or before the stock’s sale date. When 
the sale is finalized, the insider is then required to file Form 4.

263
 Chapter 20: Corporate Skullduggery: Looking at Insider Activity
 
Companies are required to make public the documents that track their trading 
activity. The SEC’s Web site offers limited access to these documents, but for 
greater access, check out one of the many companies that report insider trad-
ing data, such as www.marketwatch.com and www.bloomberg.com.
 
The SEC has enacted the short-swing profit rule to protect the investing public. 
This rule prevents insiders from quickly buying the stock that they just sold at 
a profit. The insider must wait at least six months before buying it again. The 
SEC created this rule to prevent insiders from using their privileged knowl-
edge to make an unfair profit quickly, before the investing public can react. 
The rule also applies if an insider sells stock — he can’t sell it at a higher price 
within a six-month period.
Looking at Insider Transactions
The classic phrase “Actions speak louder than words” was probably coined 
for insider trading. Insiders are in the know, and keeping a watchful eye on 
their transactions — both buying and selling their company’s stock — can 
provide you with very useful investing information. But insider buying and 
insider selling can be as different as day and night; insider buying is simple, 
while insider selling can be complicated. In the following sections, I present 
both sides of insider trading.
Fighting accounting fraud: The Sarbanes-Oxley Act
Very often, a market that reaches a mania stage 
sees abuse reach extreme conditions as well. 
Abuse by insiders is a good example. In the 
stock market mania of 1997–2000, this abuse 
wasn’t just limited to insider buying and selling 
of stock; it also covered the related abuse of 
accounting fraud. (Companies like Enron in 2001 
and Fannie Mae in 2008 come to mind.) The top 
management executives at several prominent 
companies deceived investors about the com-
panies’ financial conditions and subsequently 
were able to increase the perceived value of 
the companies’ stock. The stock could then 
be sold at a price that was higher than market 
value. Congress took notice of these activities 
and, in 2002, passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
(SOX). Congress designed this act to protect 
investors from fraudulent accounting activi-
ties by corporations. SOX established a public 
accounting oversight board and also tightened 
the rules on corporate financial reporting.
Since passage of SOX, the period of 2003–2007 
was relatively quiet on the corporate compli-
ance front, but as I write this, SOX will soon be 
tested, as Wall Street’s financial institutions 
have been slammed by bankruptcy and alleged 
management wrongdoing.

Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
Breaking down insider buying
Insider buying is usually an unambiguous signal about how an insider feels 
about his company. After all, the primary reason that all investors buy stock 
is that they expect it to do well. If one insider is buying stock, that’s generally 
not a monumental event. But if several or more insiders are buying, those 
purchases should certainly catch your attention.
Insider buying is generally a positive omen and beneficial for the stock’s 
price. Also, when insiders buy stock, less stock is available to the public. If 
the investing public meets this decreased supply with increased demand, the 
stock price rises. Keep these factors in mind when analyzing insider buying:
 
✓ Identify who’s buying the stock. The CEO is buying 5,000 shares. Is that 
reason enough for you to jump in? Maybe. After all, the CEO certainly 
knows how well the company is doing. But what if that CEO is just start-
ing her new position? What if before this purchase she had no stock in 
the company at all? Maybe the stock is part of her employment package.
 
 The fact that a new company executive is making her first stock pur-
chase isn’t as strong a signal urging you to buy as the fact that a long-
time CEO is doubling her holdings. Also, if large numbers of insiders are 
buying, that sends a stronger signal than if a single insider is buying.
 
✓ See how much is being bought. In the preceding example, the CEO 
bought 5,000 shares, which is a lot of stock no matter how you count it. 
But is it enough for you to base an investment decision on? Maybe, but 
a closer look may reveal more. If she already owned 1 million shares at 
the time of the purchase, then buying 5,000 additional shares wouldn’t 
be such an exciting indicator of a pending stock rise. In this case, 5,000 
shares is a small incremental move that doesn’t offer much to get 
excited about.
 
 However, what if this particular insider has owned only 5,000 shares 
for the past three years and is now buying 1 million shares? Now that 
should arouse your interest! Usually, a massive purchase tells you that 
particular insider has strong feelings about the company’s prospects 
and that she’s making a huge increase in her share of stock ownership. 
Still, a purchase of 1 million shares by the CEO isn’t as strong a signal 
as ten insiders buying 100,000 shares each. Again, if only one person is 
buying, that may or may not be a strong indication of an impending rise. 
However, if lots of people are buying, consider it a fantastic indication.
 
 An insider purchase of any kind is a positive sign, but it’s always more 
significant when a greater number of insiders are making purchases. 
“The more the merrier!” is a good rule for judging insider buying. All 
these individuals have their own, unique perspectives on the company 

265
 Chapter 20: Corporate Skullduggery: Looking at Insider Activity
and its prospects. Mass buying indicates mass optimism for the com-
pany’s future. If the treasurer, the president, the vice president of sales, 
and several other key players are putting their wealth on the line and 
investing it in a company they know intimately, that’s a good sign for 
your stock investment as well.
 
✓ Notice the timing of the purchase. The timing of insider stock pur-
chases is important as well. If I tell you that five insiders bought stock at 
various points last year, you may say, “Hmm.” But if I tell you that all five 
people bought substantial chunks of stock at the same time and right 
before earnings season, that should make you say, “HMMMMM!”
Picking up tips from insider selling
Insider stock buying is rarely negative — it either bodes well for the stock or 
is a neutral event at worst. But how about insider selling? When an insider 
sells his stock, the event can be either neutral or negative. Insider selling is 
usually a little tougher than insider buying to figure out, because insiders 
may have many different motivations to sell stock that have nothing to do 
with the company’s future prospects. Just because the president of the com-
pany is selling 5,000 shares from his personal portfolio doesn’t necessarily 
mean you should sell, too.
Insiders may sell their stock for a couple reasons: They may think that the 
company won’t be doing well in the near future — a negative sign for you — 
or they may simply need the money for a variety of personal reasons that 
have nothing to do with the company’s potential. Some typical reasons why 
insiders may sell stock include the following:
 
✓ To diversify their holdings. If an insider’s portfolio is heavily weighted 
with one company’s stock, a financial advisor may suggest that she bal-
ance her portfolio by selling some of that company’s stock and purchas-
ing other securities.
 
✓ To finance personal emergencies. Sometimes an insider needs money 
for medical, legal, or family reasons.
 
✓ To buy a home or make another major purchase. An insider may need 
the money to make a down payment, or perhaps to buy something out-
right without having to take out a loan.
 
How do you find out about the details regarding insider stock selling? 
Although insiders must report their pertinent stock sales and purchases to the 
SEC, the information isn’t always revealing. As a general rule, consider the fol-
lowing questions when analyzing insider selling:

266
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
 
✓ How many insiders are selling? If only one insider is selling, that single 
transaction doesn’t give you enough information to act on. However, if 
many insiders are selling, you should see a red flag. Check out any news 
or information that’s currently available by going to Web sites such as 
www.marketwatch.com, www.sec.gov, and finance.yahoo.com 
(along with other sources in Appendix A).
 
✓ Are the sales showing a pattern or unusual activity? If one insider sold 
some stock last month, that sale alone isn’t that significant an event. 
However, if ten insiders have each made multiple sales in the past few 
months, those sales are cause for concern. See whether any new devel-
opments at the company are potentially negative. If massive insider 
selling has recently occurred and you don’t know why, consider putting 
a stop-loss order on your stock immediately. I cover stop-loss orders 
more fully in Chapter 18.
 
✓ How much stock is being sold? If a CEO sells 5,000 shares of stock but 
still retains 100,000 shares, that’s not a big deal. But if the CEO sells all 
or most of his holdings, that’s a possible negative. Check to see whether 
other company executives have also sold stock.
 
✓ Do outside events or analyst reports seem coincidental with the sale 
of the stock? Sometimes, an influential analyst may issue a report warn-
ing about a company’s prospects. If the company’s management pooh-
poohs the report but most of them are bailing out anyway (selling their 
stock), you may want to do the same. Frequently, when insiders know 
that damaging information is forthcoming, they sell the stock before it 
takes a dip.
 
 Similarly, if the company’s management issues positive public state-
ments or reports that contradict their own behavior (they’re selling 
their stock holdings), the SEC may investigate to see whether the com-
pany is doing anything that may require a penalty (the SEC regularly 
tracks insider sales).
Considering Corporate Stock Buybacks
When you read the financial pages or watch the financial shows on TV, you 
sometimes hear that a company is buying its own stock. The announcement 
may be something like, “SuperBucks Corp. has announced that it will spend 
$2 billion dollars to buy back its own stock.” Why would a company do that, 
and what does that mean to you if you own the stock or are considering 
buying it?

267
 Chapter 20: Corporate Skullduggery: Looking at Insider Activity
When companies buy back their own stock, they’re generally indicating that 
they believe their stock is undervalued and that it has the potential to rise. If 
a company shows strong fundamentals (for example, good financial condition 
and increasing sales and earnings; see Chapter 11 for details) and it’s buying 
more of its own stock, it’s worth investigating — it may make a great addition 
to your portfolio.
 
Just because a company announces a stock buyback doesn’t always mean that 
one will happen. The announcement itself is meant to stir interest in the stock 
and cause the price to rise. The stock buyback may be only an opportunity 
for insiders to sell stock, or it may be needed for executive compensation — 
recruiting and retaining competent management is a positive use of money.
The following sections present some common reasons a company may buy 
back its shares from investors, as well as some ideas on the negative effects 
of stock buybacks.
 
If you see that a company is buying back its stock while most of the insiders 
are selling their personal shares, that’s not a good sign. It may not necessarily 
be a bad sign, but it’s not a positive sign. Play it safe and invest elsewhere.
Understanding why a company 
buys back shares
You bought this book because you’re looking at buying stocks, but indi-
viduals aren’t alone in the stock buying universe. No, I don’t just mean that 
mutual funds, pensions, and other entities are buyers; I mean the companies 
behind the stocks are buyers (and sellers), too. Why would a public company 
buy stock — especially its own?
Boosting earnings per share
By simply buying back its own shares from stockholders, a company can 
increase its earnings per share without actually earning extra money (see 
Chapter 11 and Appendix B for more on earnings per share). Sound like a 
magician’s trick? Well, it is, kind of. A corporate stock buyback is a finan-
cial sleight of hand that investors should be aware of. Here’s how it works: 
Noware Earnings, Inc., (NEI) has 10 million shares outstanding, and it’s 
expected to net earnings of $10 million for the fourth quarter. NEI’s earnings 
per share (EPS) would be $1 per share. So far so good. But what happens if 
NEI buys 2 million of its own shares? Total shares outstanding shrink to 8 mil-
lion. The new EPS becomes $1.25 — the stock buyback artificially boosts the 
earnings per share by 25 percent!

268
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
 
The important point to remember about stock buybacks is that actual com-
pany earnings don’t change — no fundamental changes occur in company 
management or operations — so the increase in EPS can be misleading. But 
the marketplace can be obsessive about earnings, and because earnings are 
the lifeblood of any company, an earnings boost, even if it’s cosmetic, can also 
boost the stock price.
If you watch a company’s price-to-earnings ratio (see Chapter 11), you know 
that increased earnings usually means an eventual increase in the stock 
price. Additionally, a stock buyback affects supply and demand. With less 
available stock in the market, demand necessarily sends the stock price 
upward.
 
Whenever a company makes a major purchase, such as buying back its own 
stock, think about how the company is paying for it and whether it seems like 
a good use of the company’s purchasing power. In general, companies buy 
their stock for the same reasons any investor buys stock — they believe that 
the stock is a good investment and will appreciate in time. Companies gener-
ally pay for a stock buyback in one of two basic ways: funds from operations 
or borrowed money. Both methods have a downside. For more details, see the 
section “Exploring the downside of buybacks,” later in this chapter.
Beating back a takeover bid
Suppose you read in the financial pages that Company X is doing a hostile 
takeover of Company Z. A hostile takeover doesn’t mean that Company X 
sends storm troopers armed with mace to Company Z’s headquarters to 
trounce its management. All a hostile takeover means is that X wants to buy 
enough shares of Z’s stock to effectively control Z (and Z is unhappy about 
being owned or controlled by X). Because buying and selling stock hap-
pens in a public market or exchange, companies can buy each other’s stock. 
Sometimes, the target company prefers not to be acquired, in which case 
it may buy back shares of its own stock to give it a measure of protection 
against unwanted moves by interested companies.
In some cases, the company attempting the takeover already owns some of 
the target company’s stock. In this case, the targeted company may offer to 
buy those shares back from the aggressor at a premium to thwart the take-
over bid. This type of offer is often referred to as greenmail.
 
Takeover concerns generally prompt interest in the investing public, driving 
the stock price upward and benefiting current stockholders.

269
 Chapter 20: Corporate Skullduggery: Looking at Insider Activity
Exploring the downside of buybacks
As beneficial as stock buybacks can be, they have to be paid for, and this 
expense has consequences. When a company uses funds from operations 
for the stock buyback, less money is available for other activities, such as 
upgrading technology, making improvements, or doing research and develop-
ment. A company faces even greater dangers when it uses debt to finance a 
stock buyback. If the company uses borrowed funds, not only does it have 
less borrowing power for other uses, but it also has to pay back the bor-
rowed funds with interest, thus lowering earnings figures.
 
In general, any misuse of money, such as using debt to buy back stock, affects 
a company’s ability to grow its sales and earnings — two measures that need 
to maintain upward mobility to keep stock prices rising.
Say that Noware Earnings, Inc. (NEI), typically pays an annual dividend of 25 
cents per share of stock and wants to buy back shares, which are currently 
at $10 each, with borrowed money with a 9 percent interest rate. If NEI buys 
back 2 million shares, it won’t have to pay out $500,000 in dividends (2 mil-
lion × 25 cents). That’s money saved. However, NEI has to pay interest on the 
$20 million it borrowed ($10 per share × 2 million shares) to buy back the 
shares. The interest totals $1.8 million (9 percent of $20 million), and the net 
result from this rudimentary example is that NEI sees an outflow of $1.3 mil-
lion (the difference between the interest paid out and the dividends savings).
Using debt to finance a stock buyback needs to make economic sense — it 
needs to strengthen the company’s financial position. Perhaps NEI could 
have used the stock buyback money toward a better purpose, such as mod-
ernizing equipment or paying for a new marketing campaign. Because debt 
interest ultimately decreases earnings, companies must be careful when 
using debt to buy back their stock.
Stock Splits: Nothing 
to Go Bananas Over
Frequently, management teams decide to do a stock split. A stock split is the 
exchange of existing shares of stock for new shares from the same company. 
Stock splits don’t increase or decrease the company’s capitalization; they just 
change the number of shares available in the market and the per-share price.

270
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
Typically, a company may announce that it’s doing a 2-for-1 stock split. For 
example, a company may have 10 million shares outstanding, with a market 
price of $40 each. In a 2-for-1 split, the company then has 20 million shares 
(the share total doubles), but the market price is adjusted to $20 (the share 
price is halved). Companies do other splits, such as a 3-for-2 or 4-for-1, but 
2-for-1 is the most common split.
The following sections present the two basic types of splits: ordinary stock 
splits and reverse stock splits.
 
Qualifying for a stock split is similar to qualifying to receive a dividend — you 
must be listed as a stockholder as of the date of record. Keep good records 
regarding your stock splits in case you need to calculate capital gains for tax 
purposes. (For information on the date of record, see Chapter 6. See Chapter 
21 for tax information.)
Ordinary stock splits
An ordinary stock split — when the number of stock shares increases — is the 
kind investors usually hear about. If you own 100 shares of Dublin, Inc., stock 
(at $60 per share) and the company announces a stock split, what happens? 
If you own the stock in certificate form, you receive in the mail a stock certifi-
cate for 100 more shares. Now, before you cheer over how your money just 
doubled, check the stock’s new price. Each share is adjusted to a $30 value.
 
Not all stock is in certificate form. Stocks held in a brokerage account are 
recorded in book entry form. Most stock, in fact, is in book entry form. A 
company only issues stock certificates when necessary or when the inves-
tor requests it. If you keep the stock in your brokerage account, check with 
your broker for the new share total to make sure you’re credited with the new 
number of shares after the stock split.
 
An ordinary stock split is primarily a neutral event, so why does a company 
bother to do it? The most common reason is that management believes the 
stock is too expensive, so it wants to lower the stock price to make the stock 
more affordable and therefore more attractive to new investors. Studies have 
shown that stock splits frequently precede a rise in the stock price. Although 
stock splits are considered a non-event in and of themselves, many stock 
experts see them as bullish signals because of the interest they generate 
among the investing public.

271
 Chapter 20: Corporate Skullduggery: Looking at Insider Activity
Reverse stock splits
A reverse stock split usually occurs when a company’s management wants to 
raise the price of its stock. Just as ordinary splits can occur when manage-
ment believes the price is too expensive, a reverse stock split means the 
company feels that the stock’s price is too cheap. If a stock’s price looks too 
low, that may discourage interest by individual or institutional investors 
(such as mutual funds). Management wants to drum up more interest in the 
stock for the benefit of shareholders (some of whom are probably insiders).
The company may also do a reverse split to decrease costs. When you have 
to send an annual report and other correspondence regularly to all the 
stockholders, the mailings can get a little pricey, especially if you have lots of 
investors who own only a few shares each. A reverse split helps consolidate 
shares and lower overall management costs.
A reverse split can best be explained with an example. TuCheep, Inc. (TCI), is 
selling at $2 per share on the Nasdaq. At that rock-bottom price, the invest-
ing public may ignore it. So TCI announces a 10-for-1 reverse stock split. Now 
what? If a stockholder had 100 shares at $2 (the old shares), the stockholder 
now owns 10 shares at $20.
 
Technically, a reverse split is considered a neutral event. However, just as 
investors may infer positive expectations from an ordinary stock split, they 
may have negative expectations from a reverse split because a reverse split 
tends to occur for negative reasons. One definitive negative reason for a 
reverse split is if the company’s stock is threatened to be delisted. If a stock is 
on a major exchange and the price falls below $1, the stock will face delisting 
(basically getting removed from the exchange). A reverse split may be used to 
ward off such an event.
 
If, in the event of a stock split, you end up with an odd number of shares, 
the company doesn’t produce a fractional share. Instead, you get a check 
for the cash equivalent. For example, if you have 51 shares and the company 
announces a 2-for-1 reverse split, odds are that you’ll get 25 shares and a cash 
payout for the odd share (or fractional share).

Keeping More of Your Money 
from the Taxman
In This Chapter
▶ Checking out the tax implications of your investments
▶ Paying taxes on your investments
▶ Taking your tax deductions
▶ Investing for your retirement
A
fter conquering the world of making money with stocks, now you have 
another hurdle — keeping your money. Some people may tell you that 
taxes are brutal, complicated, and counterproductive. Others may tell you 
that they’re a form of legalized thievery, and still others may say that they’re 
a necessary evil. And then there are the pessimists. In any case, this chapter 
shows you how to keep more of the fruits from your hard-earned labor.
Keep in mind that this chapter isn’t meant to be comprehensive. For a fuller 
treatment of personal taxes, refer to the latest edition of Taxes For Dummies 
(published by Wiley). You should also check with your personal tax advisor 
and get the publications referenced in this chapter by either visiting the 
IRS Web site at www.irs.gov or calling the IRS publications department at 
800-829-3676.
However, in this chapter, I cover the most relevant points for stock investors, 
such as the tax treatment for dividends and capital gains and losses, common 
tax deductions for investors, some simple tax-reduction strategies, and point-
ers for retirement investing.
 
Tax laws can be very hairy and perplexing, and at press time, the rumblings in 
Washington, DC, are for the potential expiration of tax cuts. Higher (and more 
complicated) taxes generally aren’t good for stock investors or the economy 
at large, so give the legislative folks a piece of your mind. A good way to do 
this is through taxpayer advocacy groups like the National Taxpayers Union 
(www.ntu.org). ’Nuff said.

274
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
Paying through the Nose: The Tax 
Treatment of Different Investments
This section tells you what you need to know about the tax implications you 
face when you start investing in stocks. It’s good to know in advance the 
basics on ordinary income, capital gains, and capital losses because it may 
affect your investing strategy.
Understanding ordinary income 
and capital gains
Profit you make from your stock investments can be taxed in one of two 
ways, depending on the type of profit:
 
✓ Ordinary income: Your profit could be taxed at the same rate as wages — 
at your full, regular tax rate. If your tax bracket is 28 percent, that’s the rate 
at which your ordinary income investment profit is taxed. Two types of 
investment profits get taxed as ordinary income (Check out IRS Publication 
550, “Investment Income and Expenses,” for more information):
 
• Dividends: When you receive dividends (either in cash or stock), 
they’re taxed as ordinary income. This is true even if those divi-
dends are in a dividend reinvestment plan (see Chapter 19 to find 
out more about dividend reinvestment plans, or DRPs.) If, how-
ever, the dividends occur in a tax-sheltered plan, such as an IRA or 
401(k) plan, then they’re exempt from taxes for as long as they’re 
in the plan. (Retirement plans are covered in the section “Taking 
Advantage of Tax-Advantaged Retirement Investing,” later in this 
chapter.) Keep in mind that qualified dividends are taxed at a 
lower rate than non-qualified dividends.
 
• Short-term capital gains: If you sell stock for a gain and you’ve 
owned the stock for one year or less, the gain is considered ordi-
nary income. To calculate the time, you use the trade date (or date 
of execution). This is the date that you executed the order, not the 
settlement date. (For more on important dates, see Chapter 6.) 
However, if these gains occur in a tax-sheltered plan, such as a 
401(k) or an IRA, no tax is triggered.
 
✓ Long-term capital gains: These are usually much better for you than 
ordinary income as far as taxes are concerned. The tax laws reward 
patient investors. After you’ve held the stock for at least a year and a 
day (what a difference a day makes!), your tax rate is reduced. Get more 
information on capital gains in IRS Publication 550, “Investment Income 
and Expenses.”

275
 Chapter 21: Keeping More of Your Money from the Taxman
 
You can control how you manage the tax burden from your investment prof-
its. Gains are taxable only if a sale actually takes place (in other words, only if 
the gain is “realized”). If your stock in GazillionBucks, Inc., goes from $5 per 
share to $87, that $82 appreciation isn’t subject to taxation unless you actually 
sell the stock. Until you sell, that gain is “unrealized.” Time your stock sales 
carefully and hold onto stocks for at least a year to minimize the amount of 
taxes you have to pay on them.
 
When you buy stock, record the date of purchase and the cost basis (the pur-
chase price of the stock plus any ancillary charges, such as commissions). 
This information is very important come tax time should you decide to sell 
your stock. The date of purchase (the date of execution) helps establish the 
holding period (how long you own the stocks) that determines whether your 
gains are considered short term or long term.
Say you buy 100 shares of GazillionBucks, Inc., at $5 and pay a commission 
of $18. Your cost basis is $518 (100 shares times $5 plus $18 commission). If 
you sell the stock at $87 per share and pay a $24 commission, the total sale 
amount is $8,676 (100 shares times $87 less $24 commission). If this sale 
occurs less than a year after the purchase, it’s a short-term gain. In the 28 
percent tax bracket, the short-term gain of $8,158 ($8,676 – $518) is also taxed 
at 28 percent. Read the following section to see the tax implications if your 
gain is a long-term gain.
 
Any gain (or loss) from a short sale is considered short term regardless of 
how long the position is held open. For more information on selling short, 
check out Chapter 18.
Minimizing the tax on your capital gains
Long-term capital gains are taxed at a more favorable rate than ordinary 
income. To qualify for long-term capital gains treatment, you must hold the 
investment for over one year (in other words, for at least one year and one day).
Recall the example in the previous section with GazillionBucks, Inc. As a 
short-term transaction at the 28 percent tax rate, the tax is $2,284 ($8,158 × 
28 percent). After you revive, you say, “Gasp! What a chunk of dough. I better 
hold off a while longer.” You hold onto the stock for at least a year to achieve 
the status of long-term capital gains. How does that change the tax? For 
anyone in the 28 percent tax bracket or higher, the long-term capital gains 
rate of 15 percent applies. In this case, the tax is $1,224 ($8,158 × 15 percent), 
resulting in a tax savings to you of $1,060 ($2,284 less $1,224). Okay, it’s not a 
fortune, but it’s a substantial difference from the original tax.
Capital gains taxes can be lower than the tax on ordinary income, but they’re 
not higher. If, for example, you’re in the 15 percent tax bracket for ordinary 
income and you have a long-term capital gain that would normally bump you 

276
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
up to the 28 percent tax bracket, the gain is taxed at your lower rate of 15 
percent instead of a higher capital gains rate. Check with your tax advisor on 
a regular basis because this can change due to new tax laws.
 
Don’t sell a stock just because it qualifies for long-term capital gains treat-
ment, even if the sale eases your tax burden. If the stock is doing well and 
meets your investing criteria, hold onto it.
Coping with capital losses
Ever think that having the value of your stocks fall could be a good thing? 
Perhaps the only real positive regarding losses in your portfolio is that they 
can reduce your taxes. A capital loss means that you lose money on your 
investments. This amount is generally deductible on your tax return, and you 
can claim a loss on either long-term or short-term stock holdings. This loss 
can go against your other income and lower your overall tax.
Say you bought Worth Zilch Co. stock for a total purchase price of $3,500 and 
sold it later at a sale price of $800. Your tax-deductible capital loss is $2,700.
 
The one string attached to deducting investment losses on your tax return 
is that the most you can report in a single year is $3,000. On the bright side, 
though, any excess loss isn’t really lost — you can carry it forward to the 
next year. If you have net investment losses of $4,500 in 2008, you can deduct 
$3,000 in 2008 and carry the remaining $1,500 loss over to 2009 and deduct it 
on your 2009 tax return.
Debt and taxes: Another angle
If you truly need cash but you don’t want to sell 
your stock because it’s doing well and you want 
to avoid paying capital gains tax, consider bor-
rowing against it. If the stock is listed (on the 
New York Stock Exchange, for example) and is 
in a brokerage account, you can borrow up to 
50 percent of the value of marginable securities 
at favorable rates (listed stocks are marginable 
securities). The money you borrow is considered 
a margin loan (see Chapter 18 for details), and 
the interest you pay is low (compared to credit 
cards or personal loans) because it’s considered 
a secured loan (your stock acts as collateral). 
On those rare occasions when I use margin, I 
usually make sure I use stocks that generate a 
high dividend. That way, the stocks themselves 
help to pay off the margin loan. In addition, if the 
proceeds are used for an investment purpose, 
the margin interest may be tax-deductible. See 
IRS Publication 550 for more details.

277
 Chapter 21: Keeping More of Your Money from the Taxman
Before you can deduct losses, they must first be used to offset any capital 
gains. If you realize long-term capital gains of $7,000 in stock A and long-term 
capital losses of $6,000 in stock B, then you have a net long-term capital gain 
of $1,000 ($7,000 gain less the offset of $6,000 loss). Whenever possible, see 
whether losses in your portfolio can be realized to offset any capital gains to 
reduce potential tax. IRS Publication 550 includes information for investors 
on capital gains and losses.
 
Here’s your optimum strategy: Where possible, keep losses on a short-term 
basis and push your gains into long-term capital gains status. If a transaction 
can’t be tax free, at the very least try to defer the tax to keep your money 
working for you.
Evaluating gains and losses scenarios
 
Of course, any investor can come up with hundreds of possible gains and 
losses scenarios. For example, you may wonder what happens if you sell part 
of your holdings now as a short-term capital loss and the remainder later as a 
long-term capital gain. You must look at each sale of stock (or potential sale) 
methodically to calculate the gain or loss you would realize from it. Figuring 
out your gain or loss isn’t that complicated. Here are some general rules to 
help you wade through the morass:
 
✓ If you add up all your gains and losses and the net result is a short-term 
gain, it’s taxed at your highest tax bracket (as ordinary income).
 
✓ If you add up all your gains and losses and the net result is a long-term 
gain, it’s taxed at 15 percent if you’re in the 28 percent tax bracket or 
higher. If you’re in the 15 percent tax bracket or lower, the tax rate on 
long-term capital gains is 0 percent in 2008.
 
✓ If you add up all your gains and losses and the net result is a loss, it’s 
deductible as follows: If your loss is $3,000 or less, it’s fully deductible 
against other income. If you’re married filing separately, your deduction 
limit is $1,500.
 
✓ If you add up all your gains and losses and the net result is a loss that 
exceeds $3,000, you can only deduct up to $3,000 in that year; the 
remainder goes forward to future years.
Sharing Your Gains with the IRS
Of course, you don’t want to pay more taxes than you have to, but as the 
old cliché goes, “Don’t let the tax tail wag the investment dog.” You should 
buy or sell a stock because it makes economic sense first and consider the 

278
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
tax implications as secondary issues. After all, taxes consume a relatively 
small portion of your gain. As long as you experience a net gain (gain after all 
transaction costs, including taxes, brokerage fees, and other related fees), 
consider yourself a successful investor — even if you have to give away some 
of your gain to taxes.
 
Try to make tax planning second nature in your day-to-day activities. No, you 
don’t have to consume yourself with a blizzard of paperwork and tax projec-
tions. I simply mean that when you make a stock transaction, keep the receipt 
and maintain good records. When you make a large purchase or sale, pause 
for a moment and ask yourself whether you’ll have to face any tax conse-
quences. (Refer to the section “Paying through the Nose: The Tax Treatment 
of Different Investments,” earlier in this chapter, to review various tax scenar-
ios.) Speak to a tax consultant beforehand to discuss the ramifications.
In the following sections, I describe the tax forms you need to fill out, as well 
as some important rules to follow.
Filling out forms
Most investors report their investment-related activities on their individual 
tax returns (Form 1040). The reports that you’ll likely receive from brokers 
and other investment sources include the following:
 
✓ Brokerage and bank statements: Monthly statements that you receive
 
✓ Trade confirmations: Documents to confirm that you bought or sold stock
 
✓ 1099-DIV: Reporting dividends paid to you
 
✓ 1099-INT: Reporting interest paid to you
 
✓ 1099-B: Reporting gross proceeds submitted to you from the sale of 
investments, such as stocks and mutual funds
You may receive other, more obscure forms that aren’t listed here. You 
should retain all documents related to your stock investments.
The IRS schedules and forms that most stock investors need to be aware of 
and/or attach to their Form 1040 include the following:
 
✓ Schedule B: To report interest and dividends
 
✓ Schedule D: To report capital gains and losses
 
✓ Form 4952: Investment Interest Expense Deduction
 
✓ Publication 17: Guide to Form 1040

279

You can get these publications directly from the IRS at 800-829-3676, or you 
can download them from the Web site (www.irs.gov). For more informa-
tion on what records and documentation investors should hang onto, check 
out IRS Publication 552, “Recordkeeping for Individuals.”
 
If you plan to do your own taxes, consider using the latest tax software prod-
ucts, which are inexpensive and easy to use. These programs usually have 
a question-and-answer feature to help you do your taxes step by step, and 
they include all the necessary forms. Consider getting either TurboTax (www.
turbotax.com) or TaxCut (www.taxcut.com) at your local software vendor 
or the companies’ Web sites.
Playing by the rules
 
Some people get the smart idea of, “Hey! Why not sell my losing stock by 
December 31 to grab the short-term loss and just buy back the stock on 
January 2 so that I can have my cake and eat it, too?” Not so fast. The IRS puts 
the kibosh on maneuvers like that with something called the wash-sale rule. 
This rule states that if you sell a stock for a loss and buy it back within 30 
days, the loss isn’t valid because you didn’t make any substantial investment 
change. The wash-sale rule applies only to losses. The way around the rule is 
simple: Wait at least 31 days before you buy that identical stock back again.
Some people try to get around the wash-sale rule by doubling up on their 
stock position with the intention of selling half. Therefore, the IRS makes 
the 30-day rule cover both sides of the sale date. That way, an investor can’t 
buy the identical stock within 30 days just before the sale and then realize a 
short-term loss for tax purposes.
Discovering the Softer Side of the IRS: 
Tax Deductions for Investors
In the course of managing your portfolio of stocks and other investments, 
you’ll probably incur expenses that are tax-deductible. The tax laws allow 
you to write off certain investment-related expenses as itemized expenses on 
Schedule A — an attachment to IRS Form 1040. Keep records of your deduc-
tions and retain a checklist to remind you which deductions you normally 
take. IRS Publication 550 (“Investment Income and Expenses”) gives you 
more details.

280
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
The following sections explain common tax deductions for investors: invest-
ment interest, miscellaneous expenses, and donations to charity. I also list a 
few items you can’t deduct.
Investment interest
If you pay any interest to a stockbroker, such as margin interest or any inter-
est to acquire a taxable financial investment, that’s considered investment 
interest and is usually fully deductible as an itemized expense.
 
Keep in mind that not all interest is deductible. Consumer interest or interest 
paid for any consumer or personal purpose isn’t deductible. For more general 
information, see the section covering interest in IRS Publication 17.
Miscellaneous expenses
Most investment-related deductions are reported as miscellaneous expenses. 
Here are some common deductions:
 
✓ Accounting or bookkeeping fees for keeping records of investment 
income
 
✓ Any expense related to tax service or education
 
✓ Computer expense — you can take a depreciation deduction for your 
computer if you use it 50 percent of the time or more for managing your 
investments
 
✓ Investment management or investment advisor’s fees (fees paid for 
advice on tax-exempt investments aren’t deductible)
 
✓ Legal fees involving stockholder issues
 
✓ Safe-deposit box rental fee or home safe to hold your securities, unless 
used to hold personal effects or tax-exempt securities
 
✓ Service charges for collecting interest and dividends
 
✓ Subscription fees for investment advisory services
 
✓ Travel costs to check investments or to confer with advisors regarding 
income-related investments

281
 Chapter 21: Keeping More of Your Money from the Taxman
 
You can deduct only that portion of your miscellaneous expenses that 
exceeds 2 percent of your adjusted gross income. For more information on 
deducting miscellaneous expenses, check out IRS Publication 529.
Donations of stock to charity
What happens if you donate stock to your favorite (IRS-approved) charity? 
Because it’s a noncash charitable contribution, you can deduct the market 
value of the stock.
Say that last year you bought stock for $2,000 and it’s worth $4,000 this year. 
If you donate it this year, you can write off the market value at the time of 
the contribution. In this case, you have a $4,000 deduction. Use IRS Form 
8283, which is an attachment to Schedule A, to report noncash contributions 
exceeding $500.
 
To get more guidance from the IRS on this matter, get Publication 526, 
“Charitable Contributions,” by calling 800-829-3676.
Knowing what you can’t deduct
 
Just to be complete, here are some items you may think you can deduct, but, 
alas, you can’t:
 
✓ Financial planning or investment seminars
 
✓ Any costs connected with attending stockholder meetings
 
✓ Home office expenses for managing your investments
Taking Advantage of Tax-Advantaged 
Retirement Investing
If you’re going to invest for the long term (such as your retirement), you may as 
well maximize your use of tax-sheltered retirement plans. Many different types 
of plans are available; I touch on only the most popular ones in the following 

282
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 
sections. Although retirement plans may not seem relevant for investors who 
buy and sell stocks directly (as opposed to a mutual fund), some plans, called 
self-directed retirement accounts, allow you to invest directly.
IRAs
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are accounts you can open with a 
financial institution, such as a bank or a mutual fund company. An IRA is 
available to almost anyone who has earned income, and it allows you to set 
aside and invest money to help fund your retirement. Opening an IRA is easy, 
and virtually any bank or mutual fund can guide you through the process. 
Two basic types of IRAs are traditional and Roth.
Traditional IRA
The traditional Individual Retirement Account (also called the deductible 
IRA) was first popularized in the early 1980s. In a traditional IRA, you can 
make a tax-deductible contribution of up to $5,000 in 2008. In addition, 
individuals age 50 and older can make additional “catch-up” investments of 
$1,000. For 2009 and beyond, the limits will be indexed to inflation.
The money can then grow in the IRA account unfettered by current taxes, 
because the money isn’t taxed until you take it out. Because IRAs are 
designed for retirement purposes, you can start taking money out of your 
IRA in the year you turn 591/2. (Hmm. That must really disappoint those who 
want their money in the year they turn 583/4.) The withdrawals at that point 
are taxed as ordinary income. Fortunately, you’ll probably be in a lower tax 
bracket then, so the tax shouldn’t be as burdensome.
Keep in mind that you’re required to start taking distributions from your 
account when you reach age 701/2, and after that point you may no longer 
contribute to a traditional IRA. Again, check with your tax advisor to see how 
this affects you personally.
 
If you take out money from an IRA too early, the amount is included in your 
taxable income, and you may be zapped with a 10 percent penalty. You can 
avoid the penalty if you have a good reason. (The IRS provides a list of rea-
sons in Publication 590, “Individual Retirement Arrangements.”)
To put money into an IRA, you must earn income equal to or greater than 
the amount you’re contributing. Earned income is money made either as an 
employee or a self-employed person. Although traditional IRAs can be great 
for investors, the toughest part about them is qualifying — they have income 
limitations and other qualifiers that make them less deductible based on how 
high your income is. See IRS Publication 590 for more details.

283
 Chapter 21: Keeping More of Your Money from the Taxman
 
Wait a minute! If IRAs usually involve mutual funds or bank investments, how 
does the stock investor take advantage of them? Here’s how: Stock investors 
can open a self-directed IRA with a brokerage firm. This means that you can 
buy and sell stocks in the account with no taxes on dividends or capital gains. 
The account is tax-deferred, so you don’t have to worry about taxes until you 
start making withdrawals. Also, many dividend reinvestment plans (DRPs) can 
be set up as IRAs as well. See Chapter 19 for more about DRPs.
Roth IRA
The Roth IRA is a great retirement plan that I wish had existed a long time 
ago. Here are some ways to distinguish the Roth IRA from the traditional IRA:
 
✓ The Roth IRA provides no tax deduction for contributions.
 
✓ Money in the Roth IRA grows tax free and can be withdrawn tax free 
when you turn 591/2.
 
✓ The Roth IRA is subject to early distribution penalties (although there 
are exceptions). Distributions have to be qualified to be penalty and 
tax-free.
The maximum contribution per year for Roth IRAs is the same as for tradi-
tional IRAs. You can open a self-directed account with a broker as well. See 
IRS Publication 590 for details on qualifying.
401(k) plans
Company-sponsored 401(k) plans (named after the section in the tax code 
that allows them) are widely used and very popular. In a 401(k) plan, compa-
nies set aside money from their paychecks that employees can use to invest 
for retirement. Generally, in 2008 you can invest as much as $15,500 of your 
pretax earned income and have it grow tax-deferred. Those over age 50 can 
contribute an additional $5,000 as a “catch-up” contribution. For 2009 and 
beyond, check with the IRS and/or your tax advisor.
Usually, the money is put in mutual funds administered through a mutual 
fund company or an insurance firm. Although most 401(k) plans aren’t self-
directed, I mention them in this book for good reason.
Because your money is in a mutual fund that may invest in stocks, take an 
active role in finding out the mutual funds in which you’re allowed to invest. 
Most plans offer several types of stock mutual funds. Use your growing 
knowledge about stocks to make more informed choices about your 401(k) 
plan options. For more information on 401(k) and other retirement plans, 
check out IRS Publication 560.

Keep in mind that a mutual fund is only as good as what it invests in. Ask the 
plan administrator some questions about the funds and the types of stocks 
the plan invests in. Are the stocks defensive or cyclical? (For more information 
on defensive and cyclical stocks, see Chapter 13.) Are they large-cap or small-
cap? If you don’t make an informed choice about the investments in your plan, 
someone else will (such as the plan administrator), and that someone proba-
bly doesn’t have the same ideas about your money that you do.

back up the truck and load up! Don’t forget to tell me about it! Well . . . you 
don’t need all ten of these points to give you the flashing buy signal, but the 
more, the better.
Use Your Instincts
Look at the world around you. Remember that you’re a daily participant 
in the economy. Your savvy consumer instincts tell you much about what 
goods and services are great . . . or not so great. What do you like? What 
products do you see flying off the shelves? Do you see anything that throngs 
of fellow consumers are lining around the block to buy? One of the greatest 
investors of our time, Peter Lynch, used to go with his wife to various stores 
and consumer outlets. He watched how consumers responded to what was 
offered. Whatever he found that was popular became a subject of research, 
which lead to great stock picks for the Fidelity Magellan Fund, a stock mutual 
fund that he managed very successfully for years.

Par t V: The Part of Tens 
Take Notice of Praise 
from Consumer Groups
A company is only as good as the profit it generates, and the profit it gener-
ates is only as good as the revenues it generates. The revenues are based 
on whether customers are accepting (and shelling out money for) the com-
pany’s products or services. Therefore, if what the company offers is popular 
with consumers, that bodes well for profits and, ultimately, higher stock 
prices.
 
When you’re ready to invest in stocks, look for high consumer satisfaction. 
Review consumer publications and Web sites such as Consumer Reports 
(www.consumerreports.org) and read the surveys and consumer feedback 
information. Good publicity and word-of-mouth consumer satisfaction are 
things that investors should be aware of. Stock-picking expert Lynch sees 
this popularity with consumers as very valuable stock-picking information. 
He likes to see what consumers buy because that’s where the company’s 
success starts.
Check Out Powerful Demographics
If you know that a company generates lots of profit from the teenage market 
and you find out that the teenage market is going to expand by 10 percent 
per year for the foreseeable future, what would you do? Exactly — you’d buy 
that company’s stock. If a company has strong fundamentals and appealing 
products or services and its market is expanding, that company has a win-
ning combination.
 
Stay alert to growing trends in society. How are demographics changing? 
Which sectors of the population are growing or shrinking? What shifts are 
expected in society in terms of age or ethnicity? Check out the data freely 
available at the Department of Commerce’s Web site for the U.S. Census 
Bureau (www.census.gov).
A market that’s growing in size isn’t an indicator all by itself (in fact, no 
indicator gives you the green light all by itself), but it should alert you to do 
some research. The fact that a strong company sees improving demographic 
shifts (translation: more potential customers) in its marketplace is a big plus.

289
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Profit before the Crowd Does
Look for a Rise in Earnings
If a company earned $1 per share for the past three years and its earnings are 
now $1.20 per share (a 20 percent increase), consider this increase a positive 
harbinger. As the saying goes, “Earnings drive the market,” so you need to 
pay attention to a company’s profitability. The more a company makes, the 
greater the chance that its stock price will increase.
 
Some people wonder whether to invest in a company that was losing money 
and then finally turns a profit. Perhaps you’re considering the stock of a com-
pany involved in new, untested technology. My advice is that you need to be 
careful in this situation. In such a case, predicting whether a second year of 
profits will show up is hard, but of course, that’s what investors are hoping.
For the serious investor, a track record of positive earnings is important. 
Several years of earnings (especially growing earnings) are crucial in the 
decision-making process. As earnings rise, make sure that the growth is at a 
rate of 10 percent or higher.
Say that you’re looking at the stock Buckets-o-Cash, Inc. (BOC). BOC had earn-
ings of $1 per share in 2006, $1.10 in 2007, and $1.21 in 2008. First, you can see 
that the company is a profitable enterprise. Second (and more important), you 
can see that the earnings grew 10 percent each year. The fact that earnings grew 
consistently year after year is important because it indicates that the company 
is being managed well. Effective company management has a very positive effect 
on the stock price as the market notices the company’s progress.
Growing earnings are important for another reason — inflation. If a company 
earns $1 per share in each year, that’s better than earning less or losing 
money. But inflation erodes money’s purchasing power. If earnings stay 
constant, the company’s ability to grow decreases because the value of its 
money declines as a result of inflation.
Check out Chapter 11 for an introduction to the importance of earnings.
Analyze Industries
Become a regular and informed watcher of a specific industry that shows 
great promise. Being aware of an industry’s progress and its promising poten-
tial is a great starting point to find a great stock before the rest of the crowd 
does. Start reading the trade magazines (ask your librarian for help), regu-
larly peruse the industry’s Web sites, and (if possible) attend trade shows 
and conferences. It’s easier to find a good stock this way than trying to scan 

290
Par t V: The Part of Tens 
the thousands of companies that span the entire economy. For more on 
analyzing industries, check out Chapter 13.
Stay Aware of Positive 
Publicity for Industries
When the media report that a company is doing well financially or that its 
products and services are being well-received by both the media and the 
market, that news lets you know that the company’s stock may be going 
places. This positive publicity ties in nicely with the point made earlier in 
this chapter about consumer acceptance for the company’s products and 
services.
 
Positive press and consumer acceptance are important because they mean 
that the company is doing what’s necessary to please its customers. The 
positive media coverage also may attract new customers to the company. 
Gaining customers means more sales and more earnings, which translates into 
a higher stock price. You can find corporate publicity articles at Web sites 
such as www.prnewswire.com, and you can track the industries at www.
hoovers.com.
Watch Megatrends
Watching the news and reading the headlines for megatrends (a trend that 
affects an entire country or major subsections of it) isn’t just an activity to 
pass the time. It’s a profitable pursuit because noticing what society at large 
is doing is a great early warning system. This is one of my favorite ways to 
pick winning stocks. I’ve even done some of the work for you (you can thank 
me later). Take a look at emerging opportunities in Chapter 14.
Keep Track of Politics
The storm clouds or pending sunshine in today’s political sphere can mean 
lots of rain or lots of light in the markets the following day. Stock markets 
tend to be reactive to positive or negative scuttlebutt in the world of politics. 
Politicians get a lot of coverage, especially during election season, which gives 
the stock investor an idea of what’s coming down the pike. When politicians 
of all stripes start talking about, say, the need to be environmentally sensitive 

291
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Profit before the Crowd Does
and how industry should go green, that tells you something (like that you 
should invest in eco-friendly companies). When politicians get elected and 
their agenda becomes obvious (raise taxes, increase regulations, provide 
incentives for activity X, and so on), those actions deserve further investiga-
tion for investment potential.
 
Keep a regular eye on popular publications and Web sites that delve into the 
world of politics. Web sites such as www.cnn.com, www.drudgereport.
com, and www.realclearpolitics.com should be visited regularly. Some 
financial publications, such as the Kiplinger Letter (www.kiplinger.com), 
also make a point of watching political trends. Flip to Chapter 15 for more on 
the effect of politics on stock investing.
Recognize Heavy Insider 
or Corporate Buying
Company insiders (such as the CEO and the treasurer) know more about 
the company’s health than anyone else. If insiders are buying stock by the 
boatload, these purchases are certainly a positive sign for investors. Chapter 
20 thoroughly covers insider trading, but I highlight the main points here. 
Insiders can do one of two things:
 
✓ Buy stock for themselves: If individuals such as the CEO or the trea-
surer are buying stocks for their personal portfolios, you can assume 
that they think the stock is a good investment.
 
✓ Buy stock as a corporate decision: A corporation buying its own stock 
is usually considered a positive move. The corporation may see its own 
stock as a good investment. Additionally, corporate stock buying reduces 
the number of shares available in the market, potentially pushing the 
stock price higher.
All things being equal, either of these situations will have a positive impact 
on the stock price. Odds are that you won’t see a stampede of insiders 
buying the stock in a day or week, but you may see it over a period of 
months. This is generally true simply because each insider has different cir-
cumstances, and insider buying is usually done on an individual basis. An 
accumulation of purchases tells you that members of the management team 
believe so strongly that the company will do well that they’re willing to put 
their own money at risk.

Follow Institutional Investors
You can generally break down the market into two basic groups: retail and 
institutional. Retail is you, me, and millions of other individuals. The institu-
tional group includes mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions, and other large 
entities. These large entities aren’t just private, corporate organizations — 
they now include governmental entities such as the newly-formed sovereign 
wealth funds created by national governments that are becoming direct 
participants in the markets. Institutional investors can have a big impact on 
markets because they can move millions (sometimes even billions) of dollars 
in and out of markets.
 
To find out more about the actions of institutional investors, you can use 
resources such as Institutional Investor News (www.iinews.com), search 
engines on the Internet, and resources in Appendix A to get you started.

W
hew! When you see the headlines out there, you tend to think that 
your money is like a balloon in a room full of porcupines — headed 
for trouble. Fortunately, successful stock investing (or just plain avoiding 
losses) isn’t that difficult to accomplish, even in a crazy market. This chapter 
lists some things to keep in mind when you want to be defensive about your 
hard-earned stock market profits.
Accrue Cash
 
Always try to have some extra cash on the sideline no matter how tempted 
you are to be 100 percent fully invested. You never know when buying oppor-
tunities may show up, especially in stocks you already own. Being in cash is 
its own form of diversification away from market risk.
Spread Your Money across Several Stocks
 
You should never have too much tied to a single stock because it’s too risky. 
Spread your money elsewhere. As a general rule of thumb, you shouldn’t have 
more than 10 percent of your financial assets tied to a single company.

294
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Buy More of a Down (Yet Solid) Stock
 
Gadzooks! Your stock just went down like a lemming off a cliff! What a rotten 
day in the market. Now what do you do? Well, if you’ve chosen well (profitable 
company, good industry, and so on), then why not buy more? If you bought a 
solid, profitable stock at $44, then why not buy some more at $33? That way 
you can dollar-cost average a bit and end up with a better cost basis. When 
the inevitable rebound in the stock price occurs, you’re looking pretty smart.
Apply Long-Term Logic
Even if you’ve done your homework and chosen well, you may still find your-
self scratching your head and saying, “Holy Moly! My stock just went down. 
What the heck happened?!” It’s happened to me many times. You may make 
what you think is the greatest choice in stock market history and still see the 
price decline. What’s a prudent investor to do? Believe it or not, wait. Wait? 
Yes . . . wait. Markets move in irrational ways in the short term, but rationality 
finally kicks in after a longer time horizon (such as 12, 18, or 24 months or 
longer).
 
Common sense takes over regarding a stock price over a protracted period. 
Long term, good choices go up and bad choices go down. Sooner or later, 
market participants (millions of both big and small investors) finally notice 
good companies and invest accordingly. The best way to remember this 
point is to keep in mind that pithy phrase, “Choose right and sit tight.” This 
is why successful stock investing and long-term stock investing tend to be a 
good marriage.
Use the Almighty Stop-Loss Order
Getting jittery about the market? What’s happening with your stock? Keep in 
mind that success with your stocks isn’t just based on what you invest in — 
it’s also based on how you invest. The stop-loss order is a perennial standby, 
and you should reach for it as often as the police commissioner reaches for 
the superhero hotline.
A stop-loss order is simply a conditional order that you put in with your bro-
kerage firm on a stock you hold in your account. If the stock is at, say, $50 
per share, you can put a stop-loss order in at $45 so that if your stock falls 

295
 Chapter 23: Ten (Or So) Ways to Protect Your Stock Market Profits
and hits $45, it’s automatically sold. Keep in mind that a stop-loss order is 
also a time-related order; you can stipulate that it can be a day order or a 
good-till-cancelled (GTC) order. The day order expires at the end of trading 
that day, while the GTC order expires at a much later time (determined by 
the broker). Find out more about stop-loss orders in Chapter 18.
Use the Almighty Trailing Stop Order
The trailing stop order is a nice variation on the stop-loss order that I discuss 
in the preceding section. This order takes the stop-loss order a step further 
by making it move upward with the stock but not budging on the down side. 
In other words, the stop loss trails the stock’s price upward but won’t adjust 
downward. You set the trailing stop at a percentage (or dollar amount) below 
the stock price.
For example, say your stock is at $50; you can set the trailing stop at 10 
percent below and make it a GTC order. If the stock falls to $45 (which is 
10 percent below $50), it’s then automatically sold to prevent further losses. 
But if the stock rises to, say, $60, the trailing stop adjusts upward and would 
then be at $54 (10 percent below the stock’s new price). Should the stock 
reverse and then fall, the trailing stop stays put at $54 and a sell order is then 
triggered. At that point you’ve protected 100 percent of your original invest-
ment ($50 per share) and the $4 profit, too. Find out more about trailing 
stops in Chapter 18.
Place a Limit Order
The limit order is another order available to anyone who has a stock broker-
age account. It has some similarity to the stop-loss order in that you set a 
sales price (or a purchase price) for the stock in question. If the stock is 
rising and hits $48, for example, you can have your brokerage firm set limit 
prices for that stock. If you want to sell it, you can put a limit order at, say, 
$46 ($2 below) or at $50 ($2 above) and, again, make it a GTC order. That 
way, you won’t settle for a price; you get what you want.
 
Limit orders give you the ability to get your price (up or down), but they 
require discipline and patience, because sometimes the market doesn’t move 
the way you think it will. I provide details on limit orders in Chapter 18.

296
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Set Up Broker Triggers
 
Don’t be gun-shy about broker triggers (like that pun?). These are just orders 
and/or e-mail alerts that brokers use to help their customers navigate the 
market environment. Is some news hitting your stock or its particular indus-
try? Triggers act like an early warning system when certain events and condi-
tions occur so that you can act on them (by buying or selling your stock). 
Many brokerage firms have Web sites that allow you to customize your 
orders. In addition, Web sites such as www.marketwatch.com and www.
bloomberg.com can e-mail you news alerts on stocks and market news. You 
can find out more about broker orders (such as trade triggers) in Chapter 18.
Consider the Put Option
A put option is a speculative vehicle that helps you make money when you 
bet on an investment (such as a stock) going down. Put options are beyond 
the scope of this book, but that doesn’t mean that I can’t whet your appetite 
about something that I feel is a good alternative to simply watching your 
investment decrease. The type of put option I want to mention is referred to 
as a protective put.
Many people buy puts when they’re betting (and hoping) that a particular 
stock will go down. Of course, if you own that particular stock, you certainly 
aren’t hoping that it goes down, but you can get a protective put as a form of 
insurance in case the stock does decline. In this case you buy a put on your 
own stock. If the stock goes down (temporarily), your protective put goes 
up. You can then hold onto the stock and sell the put option at a profit. The 
profit you make on the put can offset (wholly or partially) the temporary 
decline in the stock.
Check Out the Covered Call Option
Writing covered call options is a good way to generate income from an 
existing stock in your portfolio. Simply stated, a covered call option is a 
vehicle that gives you a chance to make money from stocks in your brokerage 
account. It’s an ultra safe way to generate more income — as much as 10 
percent, 15 percent, or more — from your stock position.

297
 Chapter 23: Ten (Or So) Ways to Protect Your Stock Market Profits
 
Covered call options are beyond the scope of this book, but I strongly recom-
mend that you look into them, as they can be a safe wealth-building feature, 
even in portfolios that are temporarily down. You can find excellent tutori-
als and beginners’ information on both covered call options and protec-
tive puts (the topic of the preceding section) at places such as the Chicago 
Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com) and the Options Industry Council 
(www.888options.com). For more on options in general, see Stock Options 
For Dummies by Alan R. Simon and Futures & Options For Dummies by Joe 
Duarte (both published by Wiley).
When All Else Fails, Sell
 
The most successful investors in history have taken their lumps. As the 
old adage goes, “Keep your winners and sell your losers.” You sell losers to 
minimize the downside. It’s easier to recoup a 10 percent or 20 percent loss 
in your portfolio on the whole than it is to recoup a huge loss in a particular 
stock. In addition, for what it’s worth, the losses are usually tax-deductible, 
which can at least help minimize the pain at tax time. (See Chapter 21 for 
details on handling taxes.)

ave you ever watched a movie and noticed that one of the characters 
coughs excessively throughout the entire film? To me, that’s a dead 
giveaway that the character is a goner. Or maybe you’ve seen a movie in 
which a bit character annoys a crime boss, so right away you know that it’s 
time for him to “sleep with the fishes.” Stocks aren’t that different. If you’re 
alert, you can recognize some definite signs that your investment may be 
ready to kick the bucket.
Let the tips in this chapter serve as a symptoms checklist on your stock 
investment. This chapter helps you catch your stock as it starts to cough 
so that you can get out before it sleeps with the fishes. (I just can’t help you 
with mixed metaphors.)
Earnings Slow Down or Head South
Profit is the lifeblood of a company. Of course, the opposite is true as well — 
lack of profit is a sign of a company’s poor financial health. Watch the earn-
ings. Are they increasing or not? If they aren’t, find out why. Keep in mind 
that if the general economy is experiencing a recession, stagnant earnings are 
still better than robust losses — everything is relative. Earnings slowdowns 
for a company may very well be a temporary phenomenon. If a firm’s earn-
ings are holding up better than its competitors and/or the market in general, 
you don’t need to be alarmed.

300
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Nonetheless, a company’s earnings are its most important measure of suc-
cess. Keep an eye on the company’s P/E ratio (see Chapter 11 for details on 
this ratio). It could change negatively (go up) as a result of one of two basic 
scenarios:
 
✓ The stock price goes up as earnings barely budge.
 
✓ The stock price doesn’t move, yet earnings drop.
Both of these scenarios result in a rising P/E ratio that ultimately has a nega-
tive effect on the stock price.
 
A P/E ratio that’s lower than industry competitors’ P/E ratios makes a 
company’s stock a favorable investment.
 
Don’t buy the argument that “Although the company has losses, its sales 
are exploding.” This argument is a variation of “The company may be losing 
money, but it’ll make it up on volume.” For example, say that Sweet Patootee, 
Inc. (SPI), had sales of $1 billion in 2008 and that the firm expects sales to 
be $1.5 billion in 2009, projecting an increase of 50 percent. But what if SPI’s 
earnings were $200 million in 2008 and the company actually expects a loss 
for 2009? The business wouldn’t succeed, because sales without earnings 
aren’t enough — the company needs to make a profit. Remember that if you 
put your money in the stock of a company that’s losing money today with 
hopes that it will become profitable tomorrow, you’re not investing, you’re 
speculating.
Sales Slow Down
Before you invest in a company, make sure that sales are strong and rising. If 
sales start to decline, that downward motion ultimately affects earnings (see 
the previous section). Although a firm’s earnings may go safely up and down, 
sales should consistently rise. If they cease to rise, a variety of reasons may 
be to blame. First, the situation may be temporary because the economy in 
general is having tough times. However, it may be more serious. Perhaps the 
company is having marketing problems, or a competitor is eating away at its 
market share. Or maybe a new technology is replacing its products and ser-
vices. In any case, falling sales raise a red flag you shouldn’t ignore.
 
By the way, when I talk sales, I’m talking about the sales of what the company 
usually offers (its products or services). Sometimes a company may sell some-
thing other than what it normally offers (such as equipment, real estate, or a 
subdivision of its business), and this sale may make the total sales number 
temporarily blip upward. Watch for this because it can fool your perception 
of the company’s financial strength. Maybe the unusual sale is due to financial 
or cash flow problems that the company’s experiencing. The bottom line is to 
simply check it out.

301
 Chapter 24: Ten Red Flags for Stock Investors
Debt Is Too High or Unsustainable
Excessive debt is the kiss of death for a struggling company. During 
2000–2002, many companies that experts thought were invincible went 
bankrupt. During 2007 and 2008, many prominent businesses struggled 
with high debt, including brokerage firms (longtime Wall Street power-
houses Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed into bankruptcy in 
early 2008), large regional banks (Indymac Bank in California), and that old 
standby, General Motors (GM was fighting off bankruptcy in mid-2008). It’s 
getting so that stock investing is riskier than hang gliding in a hurricane!
 
Be aware of a company’s debt and solvency. Chapter 12 and Appendix B can 
help you read and understand a company’s financial data clearly so that you 
can make an informed decision about buying or selling its stock.
Analysts Are Exuberant Despite Logic
Too often, analysts give glowing praise to stocks that any logical person with 
some modest financial acumen would avoid like the plague. Why is this? In 
many instances, the analysts have, alas, a dark motive (or something not so 
dark such as . . . ugh . . . stupidity). In any case, remember that analysts are 
employed by firms that earn hefty investment banking fees from the very 
companies that these analysts tout. In that situation, issuing a less-than-
complete or less-than-accurate report can be easy.
 
In fact, you should be wary of analysts’ views, especially the analysts who 
make positive recommendations even when the company in question has wor-
risome features, such as no income and tremendous debt. It seems like a para-
dox: Sell a stock when all the pros say to buy it? How can that be? The merits 
of any stock should speak for themselves. When a company is losing money, 
all the great recommendations in the world can’t reverse its fortunes.
 
Also, keep in mind that if everybody is buying a particular stock — the current 
analysts’ favorite — who’s left to buy it? When the stock turns out to be a dud, 
you aren’t able to sell it because all the other suckers already own it (thanks 
to analysts’ recommendations). And if they already own it, they’re probably 
already aware of the company’s flaws. What happens then? You got it: More 
and more people end up selling it. When more people are selling than buying a 
stock, its price declines.

302
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Insider Selling
Heavy insider selling is to a stock what garlic, sunrises, and crosses are to 
vampires: an almost certain sign of doom! If you notice that increasing num-
bers of insiders (such as a company’s president, treasurer, or vice president 
of finance, for instance) are selling their stock holdings, you can consider it 
a red flag. In recent years, massive insider selling has become a telltale sign 
of a company’s imminent fall from grace. After all, who better to know the 
company’s prospects for success (or lack thereof) than its high-level man-
agement? What management does (selling stock, for example) speaks louder 
than what management says. (Do you hear that loud and persistent coughing 
again?) For more information on insider trading, see Chapter 20.
A Bond Rating Cut
It may seem odd, but the prospects for a company’s bonds are an indicator 
of the prospects for the company’s stock. Many firms issue bonds so they 
can borrow money to fund operations or new ventures. These corporate 
bonds are usually rated by major bond-rating agencies such as Standard and 
Poor’s. These agencies issue a rating on the bond with this question in mind: 
“Does the issuer of the bond (the company) have the financial wherewithal to 
pay back the bond principal and interest in full according to the terms of the 
bond indenture (the bond agreement)?”
 
If a company is rated as financially strong, the bond-rating agency will issue 
a high bond rating (such as AAA or AA). If the agency’s view of the company 
is generally negative, the bond rating for the company will be lower (such as 
BBB or lower). If you see a company’s bonds being downgraded, that’s defi-
nitely a red flag for investors. Check out Chapter 9 for more information on 
bond ratings.
Increased Negative Coverage
You may easily recognize unfavorable reports of a company’s stock as a sign 
to unload that stock. Or you may be a contrarian and see bad press as an 
opportunity to scoop up some shares of a company victimized by negative 
reporting. In any case, take the negative reports as a signal to further investi-
gate the merits of holding onto the stock or as a sign for selling it so that you 
can make room in your portfolio for a more promising stock choice.

303
 Chapter 24: Ten Red Flags for Stock Investors
Industry Problems
 
Sometimes, being a strong company doesn’t matter if that company’s industry 
is having problems. If the industry is in trouble, the company’s decline prob-
ably isn’t that far behind. Tighten up those trailing stops (see Chapter 18 to 
find out how).
Also, try to be aware of industries that are intimately related to the industry 
of a company’s stock you own or are considering buying. Very often, prob-
lems in one industry can affect or spread to a related industry. For example, 
plummeting auto sales may have a negative effect on prospects for auto parts 
or auto services companies. To find out more about industries, check out 
Chapter 13.
Political Problems
 
Political considerations are always a factor in investing. Be it taxes, regulations, 
or other government actions, politics can easily break a company and sink its 
stock. If your company’s stock is sensitive to political developments, be aware 
of potential political pitfalls. Reading The Wall Street Journal and regularly view-
ing major financial Web sites can help you stay informed. (I give you lists of 
sources in Appendix A.)
In recent years, drug and tobacco stocks in general suffered because of 
prevailing political attitudes. Also, the prices of certain stocks in particu-
lar (Microsoft in the late 1990s comes to mind) have dropped drastically 
because the companies were targets of government actions for such reasons 
as antitrust concerns and public safety issues. To find out more about politi-
cal considerations affecting stocks, go to Chapter 15.
Funny Accounting: No Laughing Here!
Throughout this book, I discuss the topic of accounting as an important way 
to see how well (or how poorly) a company is doing. Understanding a com-
pany’s balance sheet and income statement and making a simple comparison 
of these documents over a period of several years can give you great insights 
into the company’s prospects. You don’t have to be an accountant to grasp 
key concepts. Enron is a perfect example of how you can avoid a stock invest-
ing disaster with some rudimentary knowledge of accounting.

304
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Despite the fact that Enron hid many of its financial problems from public 
view, the information that was available made the message clear: “Danger 
Will Robinson! Houston, we have a problem!” If investors had done some 
simple homework, they would have plainly seen the following revealing 
points in 2000, over a year and a half before the collapse:
 
✓ Enron’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio hit 90 in 2000. This stratospheric 
P/E kept most value investors (including myself) away.
 
✓ Its price to book (P/B) ratio hit 12. For investors, this ratio means that 
the market value of the company, compared to the company’s book 
value (also called accounting value), was 12 to 1 — for every $12 of 
market value, investors were getting only $1 in book value. When you 
consider that a P/B ratio of 3 or 4 is considered nosebleed territory 
for value investors, you can see that Enron’s P/B ratio was screaming, 
“Watch out below!”
 
✓ The price to sales (P/S) ratio hit an incredible 22. This ratio means that 
investors paid $22 in market value for every $1 of sales the company 
generated. When a P/S of 5 or 10 is considered too high, 22 is nosebleed 
territory!
I found this information in public filings that anyone could have seen. To 
understand these points more fully (along with other equally incisive and 
lucid accounting and financial points) and to discover how to use the infor-
mation to avoid similar mistakes in the future, see Chapters 11 and 12 and 
Appendix B.

Chapter 25
Ten Challenges and Opportunities 
for Stock Investors
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the most pressing concerns for stock investors
▶ Recognizing other markets that can affect stocks
▶ Spotting hidden opportunities with new economic megatrends
O
ver the years, I’ve found that the easiest way to make money with stocks 
(or to avoid losing money with stocks) is to simply be aware of the eco-
nomic environment in which they operate. Stocks can be the best (or worst) 
investment depending on the economic/political environment. Many economic 
challenges face the stock market, including what’s happening with government 
policy, societal trends, and national/international geopolitical conditions. In 
this chapter, I discuss the most important issues or megatrends that can affect 
you and your loved ones, as well as your stock investments.
 
You need to be aware of the big picture by regularly checking in with great 
Web sites such as Financial Sense (www.financialsense.com), Free-Market 
News Network (www.freemarketnews.com), and the Mises Institute (www.
mises.org). See Appendix A for more resources.
Debt, Debt, and More Debt
In the summer of 2008, the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) surpassed the 
$14 trillion mark. Great! However, the total level of debt in the country sur-
passed $40 trillion. Ugh . . . NOT great. What has kept the economy afloat and 
“growing” during the past eight to ten years is massive and pervasive debt 
that must be dealt with. Debt in just about every category is at record levels, 

306
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
including mortgage, consumer, margin, corporate, and government debt. The 
problem is that this debt must be either paid off or wiped out through 
bankruptcy. In 2008, you’ve seen financial catastrophes with debt gone bad in 
the banking and brokerage industries. The chickens have come home to roost!
 
Make sure that you’re dealing with your debt level now. Reduce it as much as 
possible, and make sure that you’re analyzing your stocks in the same light. 
Companies that carry too much debt are at great risk. If a company sinks, your 
stock will follow. If the company goes into bankruptcy, your stock’s value will 
be vaporized.
 
If you want to see something fascinating (and scary at the same time), check 
out the total debt figures by viewing the Grandfather Economic Report by 
Michael Hodges at http://mwhodges.home.att.net (if the Web site is no 
longer active, feel free to e-mail me at paul@mladjenovic.com and I’ll get 
the info for you). It’s sobering stuff!
Derivatives
Deriv . . . what? You may say, “What the hell are they?” unless, of course, 
you’re my church’s pastor. Derivatives are the largest financial market in the 
world. As of September 2008, the total dollar value exceeds $500 trillion. It 
easily dwarfs the world economy. Easily! Now, you don’t have to understand 
them, but you should be aware of what could go wrong if a derivatives prob-
lem occurs. Companies such as Enron, Bear Stearns, and AIG imploded very 
quickly, primarily because of tragic errors in their derivatives portfolio. I would 
love to explain derivatives more fully, but it would take a whole chapter by 
itself. If you want a detailed explanation, sources such as www.wikipedia.
com and www.investopedia.com do a fairly good job. Derivatives “accidents” 
have dotted the financial landscape over the past 10 to 15 years, and they had 
(and will have) the potential to do major damage to the stock market.
There’s no use fretting about derivatives. While you’re at it, you may as well 
worry about meteors and presidential campaigns. Just take common sense 
approaches to protect your portfolio as you grow your wealth. Stay away 
from firms that have large derivatives positions (typically banks and broker-
age firms). Look into diversifying, trailing stops, and the other strategies dis-
cussed in this book and in the resources cited.

307
 Chapter 25: Ten Challenges and Opportunities for Stock Investors
Real Estate
Real estate is one challenge the experts warned you about during 2004–2005. 
By the time you read this, everyone will realize that the real estate industry is 
down dramatically from its former bubble highs, and it’s languishing with record 
levels of foreclosures and unsold inventories of property (as of mid-2008). If 
you’re tempted to jump in, tread carefully, because a full, healthy recovery in 
a slow-moving market like real estate tends to take a long time. You’re better off 
waiting until the data from the industry becomes more positive.
 
The message to you at this point is clear: Make sure you have your mortgage 
under control and your debt at manageable levels. Make sure that the real 
estate industry is showing signs of solid recovery before you buy any stock of 
any related companies.
 
Some early signs of a recovery are at least three consecutive quarters of rising 
building permits and a steady shrinkage of the national inventory of unsold 
real estate, among others. Some good Web sites on real estate include www.
realtor.com and realestate.yahoo.com.
Inflation
Inflation is indeed a major megatrend as I write this. The real-world rate 
1of inflation (as of September 2008) is in the 9 to 11 percent range. High (and 
rising) inflation is now a worldwide phenomenon because most major coun-
tries are increasing their money supply at double-digit levels. What do stock 
investors do?
 
Reassess your portfolios and avoid companies that may get hurt from rising 
inflation (such as mortgage companies and other fixed-debt securities). 
Consider shifting more of your portfolio to companies that benefit from infla-
tion (or at least don’t get hurt by it), such as those in the food, water, energy, 
and precious metals sectors.

308
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Pensions and Unfunded Liabilities
The year 2008 is more than just an election year; it’s also the year that the 
first wave of 78 million baby boomers retire. The problem is that pensions for 
these folks will likely fall short. The latest data shows that many pensions are 
underfunded, and many future retirees are in for a rude awakening.
In addition, Social Security and Medicare are certain to be gigantic challenges 
during the next few decades. As of July 2008, the total liabilities for these 
mammoth programs exceed $50 trillion. That’s not a typo; it’s a combined 
liability that’s nearly four times the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP). 
Current beneficiaries will likely not be affected, but anyone under 65 will 
certainly be. Let’s face it: We’re living longer than ever before, and we need 
to be more proactive about our personal responsibility in our senior years.
 
To find out more, review your rights and responsibilities with the Social 
Security Administration (www.ssa.gov) and Medicare (www.medicare.
gov). Also check out some excellent private sites such as www.social
security.org, www.medicare.org, and www.medicarenewswatch.com.
 
The message is clear: People need to save and invest more to fill in the finan-
cial gaps that seem to be inevitable. Stocks are a wealth-building tool that’s 
well-suited for long-term needs such as your retirement concerns. Start now, 
because the future has a way of sneaking up on you faster than you think.
The Growth of Government
Every economy has two components: private (consumers and producers) 
and public (government). No matter how you slice it, government is sup-
ported (think taxes) by the private sector. The total combined budget for 
federal, state, and local governments in the U.S. exceeds $5 trillion as of 
September 2008. The trend is for larger and more activist government, which 
entails higher overall taxes, increased regulations, and other government 
growth (inflation, spending, and so on). History tells us that this isn’t a posi-
tive trend and that it can weigh very heavily on the finances of the private 
sector (translation: the stock market goes down). What’s an investor to do?
 
I repeat the message from throughout this book: Stick to stocks from compa-
nies whose products or services address basic human needs, and understand 
the good, the bad, and the ugly of government and its effect on the economy 
and financial markets (Chapters 10 and 15 are good places to start).

309
 Chapter 25: Ten Challenges and Opportunities for Stock Investors
Recession/Depression
Recessions and depressions are actually a tie-in to the point in the previous 
section — they’re symptoms of excessive government growth and inter-
vention. In any event, Americans have been trying to fend off a recession 
throughout much of 2008. I think that struggling economic times will still be 
evident when you read these words.
 
In rough economic times, the best stocks are defensive (food, beverage, 
utilities, and so on) because people buy these things no matter how good 
or bad the economy is. Cyclical stocks will get beaten down, so it may be a 
good idea to shop around for real values after the economy turns around. 
Meanwhile, deploy protective strategies with your money, and play it safe 
with solid, financially sound companies.
Commodities
A shrewd man once said, “History may not repeat itself, but it can often 
rhyme” (okay, it was me!). In many respects, this decade resembles the 
1970s. Stocks were having a dreadful time as inflation, the energy crisis, and 
international tensions escalated. However, it was a great time to invest in 
energy, precious metals, and commodities. Gold and silver hit all-time highs 
by the end of the 1970s. Stock investors who scooped up shares of companies 
in these specific industries racked up tremendous gains.
 
The lesson for investors to understand is that conditions in this decade offer 
opportunities in natural resources that mirror the late 1970s. In addition, 
China and India are growing, and they’ll need more commodities (grains, base 
metals, energy, water, and so on) for their expanding economies and popula-
tions. As demand continues to outpace supply, the stocks of companies that 
provide products and services in natural resources will shine.
Energy
Oil hit a recent high of $147 per barrel in early summer 2008. Although the 
price corrected (it’s at approximately $65 as of mid-October 2008), the 
world’s appetite for energy (oil, gas, and so on) has caused prices to hit 

310
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
record highs, and the coming years promise more demand. The energy 
markets are experiencing a sea change that makes current conditions far 
more different and more serious than in recent decades. Our society has 
entered the age of Peak Oil (see more about this at www.peakoil.net), 
which means that cheap and readily available energy is a thing of the past.
For stock investors, this at least means the chance to grow your money both 
directly (energy companies, obviously) and indirectly (alternate energy 
companies). If you want your wealth to grow, you need to understand the 
impact that energy has on your portfolio. (See Chapter 14 for more on 
emerging sector opportunities.)
Dangers from Left Field
Gee, after being beaten up by the previous nine points, what else is needed? 
This reminds me of the episode of “Get Smart” where the arch villain says, 
“You’ve been whipped, beaten, and tortured, but the picnic is over!” (I still 
use that great line at parties.) In any case, I hope that I’ve impressed upon 
you that it’s a brave new world fraught with dangers for the clueless but filled 
with wealth-building opportunities for the clued in. The fact is that no one 
knows what will hit our economy and society from out of the blue. Events 
such as 9/11, the tsunami in Asia, and Hurricane Katrina certainly tell us that 
the world has unseen perils for us and our prosperity. Terrorism and other 
factors will have an impact. Fortunately, you can make changes — even slight 
changes — that can protect or grow your wealth.
 
Whether you’re talking about healthcare stocks that boom in response to new 
health threats or concerns (such as mad cow disease) or stocks of companies 
that prosper because of homeland security issues, your stock investing pro-
gram can survive and thrive. Stay informed and understand that successful 
stock investing doesn’t happen in a vacuum.

Appendix B
Financial Ratios
C
onsidering how many financial catastrophes have occurred in recent 
years (and continue to occur in the current headlines), doing your 
homework regarding the financial health of your stock choices is more 
important than ever. This appendix should be your go-to section when 
you find stocks that you’re considering for your portfolio. It lists the most 
common ratios that investors should be aware of and use. A solid company 
doesn’t have to pass all these ratio tests with flying colors, but at a minimum, 
it should comfortably pass the ones regarding profitability and solvency:
 
✓ Profitability: Is the company making money? Is it making more or less 
than it did in the prior period? Are sales growing? Are profits growing?
 
 You can answer these questions by looking at the following ratios:
 
• Return on equity
 
• Return on assets
 
• Common size ratio (income statement)
 
✓ Solvency: Is the company keeping debts and other liabilities under con-
trol? Are the company’s assets growing? Is the company’s net equity (or 
net worth or stockholders’ equity) growing?
 
 You can answer these questions by looking at the following ratios:
 
• Quick ratio
 
• Debt to net equity
 
• Working capital
 
While you examine ratios, keep these points in mind:
 
✓ Not every company and/or industry is the same. A ratio that seems dubi-
ous in one industry may be just fine in another. Investigate and check 
out the norms in that particular industry. (See Chapter 13 for details on 
analyzing industries.)

330
Par t VI: Appendixes 
 
✓ A single ratio isn’t enough on which to base your investment decision. 
Look at several ratios covering the major aspects of the company’s 
finances.
 
✓ Look at two or more years of the company’s numbers to judge whether 
the most recent ratio is better, worse, or unchanged from the previ-
ous year’s ratio. Ratios can give you early warning signs regarding the 
company’s prospects. (See Chapter 11 for details on two important 
documents that list a company’s numbers — the balance sheet and the 
income statement.)
Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity is the ability to quickly turn assets into cash. Liquid assets are 
simply assets that are easy to convert to cash. Real estate, for example, is 
certainly an asset, but it’s not liquid because converting it to cash could take 
weeks, months, or even years. Current assets such as checking accounts, sav-
ings accounts, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inventory are 
much easier to sell or convert to cash in a short period of time.
Paying bills or immediate debt takes liquidity. Liquidity ratios help you 
understand a company’s ability to pay its current liabilities. The most 
common liquidity ratios are the current ratio and the quick ratio; the num-
bers to calculate them are located on the balance sheet.
Current ratio
The current ratio is the most commonly used liquidity ratio. It answers the 
question, “Does the company have enough financial cushion to meet its cur-
rent bills?” It’s calculated as follows:
Current ratio = Total current assets ÷ Total current liabilities
If Schmocky Corp. (SHM) has $60,000 in current assets and $20,000 in current 
liabilities, the current ratio is 3, meaning the company has $3 of current assets 
for each dollar of current liabilities. As a general rule, a current ratio of 2 or 
more is desirable.
 
A current ratio of less than 1 is a red flag that the company may have a cash 
crunch that could cause financial problems. Although many companies strive to 
get the current ratio to equal 1, I like to see a higher ratio (in the range of 1–3) to 
keep a cash cushion should the economy slow down.

331
 Appendix B: Financial Ratios
Quick ratio
The quick ratio is frequently referred to as the “acid test” ratio. It’s a little 
more stringent than the current ratio in that you calculate it without inven-
tory. I’ll use the current ratio example discussed in the preceding section. 
What if half of the assets are inventory ($30,000 in this case)? Now what? 
First, here’s the formula for the quick ratio:
Quick ratio = (Current assets less inventory) ÷ Current liabilities
In the example, the quick ratio for SHM is 1.5 ($30,000 divided by $20,000). In 
other words, the company has $1.50 of “quick” liquid assets for each dollar of 
current liabilities. This amount is okay. Quick liquid assets include any money 
in the bank, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. If quick liquid 
assets at the very least equal or exceed total current liabilities, that amount 
is considered adequate.
The acid test that this ratio reflects is embodied in the question, “Can the 
company pay its bills when times are tough?” In other words, if the company 
can’t sell its goods (inventory), can it still meet its short-term liabilities? Of 
course, you must watch the accounts receivable as well. If the economy is 
entering rough times, you want to make sure that the company’s customers 
are paying invoices on a timely basis.
Operating Ratios
Operating ratios essentially measure a company’s efficiency. “How is the 
company managing its resources?” is a question commonly answered with 
operating ratios. If, for example, a company sells products, does it have too 
much inventory? If it does, that could impair the company’s operations. The 
following sections present common operating ratios.
Return on equity (ROE)
Equity is the amount left from total assets after you account for total liabili-
ties. (This can also be considered a profitability ratio.) The net equity (also 
known as shareholders’ equity, stockholders’ equity, or net worth) is the 
bottom line on the company’s balance sheet, both geographically and figura-
tively. It’s calculated as
Return on equity (ROE) = Net income ÷ Net equity

332
Par t VI: Appendixes 
The net income (from the company’s income statement) is simply the total 
income less total expenses. Net income that isn’t spent or used up increases 
the company’s net equity. Looking at net income is a great way to see 
whether the company’s management is doing a good job growing the busi-
ness. You can check this out by looking at the net equity from both the most 
recent balance sheet and the one from a year earlier. Ask yourself whether 
the current net equity is higher or lower than the year before. If it’s higher, 
by what percentage is it higher?
For example, if SHM’s net equity is $40,000 and its net income is $10,000, its 
ROE is a robust 25 percent (net income of $10,000 divided by net equity of 
$40,000). The higher the ROE, the better. An ROE that exceeds 10 percent (for 
simplicity’s sake) is good (especially in a slow and struggling economy). Use 
the ROE in conjunction with the ROA ratio in the following section to get a 
fuller picture of a company’s activity.
Return on assets (ROA)
The ROA may seem similar to the ROE, but it actually gives a perspective that 
completes the picture when coupled with the ROE. The formula for figuring 
out ROA is
Return on assets = Net income ÷ Total assets
The ROA reflects the relationship between a company’s profit and the assets 
used to generate that profit. If SHM makes a profit of $10,000 and has total 
assets of $100,000, the ROA is 10 percent. This percentage should be as high 
as possible, but it will generally be less than the ROE.
Say that the company has an ROE of 25 percent but an ROA of only 5 percent. 
Is that good? It sounds okay, but a problem exists. An ROA that’s much lower 
than the ROE indicates that the higher ROE may have been generated by 
something other than total assets — debt! The use of debt can be a leverage 
to maximize the ROE, but if the ROA doesn’t show a similar percentage of 
efficiency, then the company may have incurred too much debt. In that case, 
investors should be aware that this situation could cause problems (see the 
section “Solvency Ratios,” later in this appendix). Better ROA than DOA!
Sales to receivables ratio (SR)
The sales to receivables ratio (SR) gives investors an indication of a compa-
ny’s ability to manage what customers owe it. This ratio uses data from both 

333
 Appendix B: Financial Ratios
the income statement (sales) and the balance sheet (accounts receivable, or 
AR). The formula is expressed as
Sales to receivables ratio = Sales ÷ Receivables
Say that you have the following data for SHM:
Sales in 2007 are $75,000. On 12/31/07, receivables stood at $25,000.
Sales in 2008 are $80,000. On 12/31/08, receivables stood at $50,000.
Based on this data, you can figure out that sales went up 6.6 percent, but 
receivables went up 100 percent! In 2007, the SR was 3 ($75,000 divided by 
$25,000). However, the SR in 2008 sank to 1.6 ($80,000 divided by $50,000), 
or was nearly cut in half. Yes, sales did increase, but the company’s ability 
to collect money due from customers fell dramatically. This information is 
important to notice for one main reason: What good is selling more when you 
can’t get the money? From a cash flow point of view, the company’s financial 
situation deteriorated.
Solvency Ratios
Solvency just means that a company isn’t overwhelmed by its liabilities. 
Insolvency means “Oops! Too late.” You get the point. Solvency ratios have 
never been more important than they are now because the American econ-
omy is currently carrying so much debt. Solvency ratios look at the relation-
ship between what a company owns and what it owes. Here are two of the 
primary solvency ratios.
Debt to net equity ratio
The debt to net equity ratio answers the question, “How dependent is the 
company on debt?” In other words, it tells you how much the company owes 
and how much it owns. You calculate it as follows:
Debt to net equity ratio = Total liabilities ÷ Net equity
If SHM has $100,000 in debt and $50,000 in net worth, the debt to net equity 
ratio is 2. The company has $2 of debt to every dollar of net worth. In this 
case, what the company owes is twice the amount of what it owns.

334
Par t VI: Appendixes 
 
Whenever a company’s debt to net equity ratio exceeds 1 (as in the example), 
that isn’t good. In fact, the higher the number, the more negative the situation. 
If the number is too high and the company isn’t generating enough income to 
cover the debt, the business runs the risk of bankruptcy.
Working capital
Technically, working capital isn’t a ratio, but it does belong to the list of 
things that serious investors look at. Working capital measures a company’s 
current assets in relation to its current liabilities. It’s a simple equation:
Working capital = Total current assets – Total current liabilities
The point is obvious: Does the company have enough to cover the current 
bills? Actually, you can formulate a useful ratio. If current assets are $25,000 
and current liabilities are $25,000, that’s a 1-to-1 ratio, which is cutting it 
close. Current assets should be at least 50 percent higher than current liabili-
ties (say, $1.50 to $1.00) to have enough cushion to pay bills and have some 
money for other purposes. Preferably, the ratio should be 2 to 1 or higher.
Common Size Ratios
Common size ratios offer simple comparisons. You have common size ratios 
for both the balance sheet (where you compare total assets) and the income 
statement (where you compare total sales):
 
✓ To get a common size ratio from a balance sheet, the total assets figure 
is assigned the percentage of 100 percent. Every other item on the bal-
ance sheet is represented as a percentage of total assets. For example, if 
SHM has total assets of $10,000 and debt of $3,000, then debut equals 30 
percent (debt divided by total assets, or $3,000 ÷ $10,000, which equals 
30 percent).
 
✓ To get a common size ratio from an income statement (or profit and 
loss statement), you compare total sales. For example, if SHM has 
$50,000 in total sales and a net profit of $8,000, then you know that the 
profit equals 16 percent of total sales.
 
Keep in mind the following points with common size ratios:
 
✓ Net profit: What percentage of sales is it? What was it last year? How 
about the year before? What percentage of increases (or decreases) is 
the company experiencing?

335
 Appendix B: Financial Ratios
 
✓ Expenses: Are total expenses in line with the previous year? Are 
any expenses going out of line?
 
✓ Net equity: Is this item higher or lower than the year before?
 
✓ Debt: Is this item higher or lower than the year before?
 
Common size ratios are used to compare the company’s financial data not 
only with prior balance sheets and income statements but also with other 
companies in the same industry. You want to make sure that the company is 
not only doing better historically but also as a competitor in the industry.
Valuation Ratios
Understanding the value of a stock is very important for stock investors. The 
quickest and most efficient way to judge the value of a company is to look at 
valuation ratios. The type of value that you deal with throughout this book is 
the market value (essentially the price of the company’s stock). You hope to 
buy it at one price and sell it later at a higher price — that’s the name of the 
game. But what’s the best way to determine whether what you’re paying for 
now is a bargain or is fair market value? How do you know whether your stock 
investment is undervalued or overvalued? The valuation ratios in the following 
sections can help you answer these questions. In fact, they’re the same ratios 
that value investors have used with great success for many years.
Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)
The price-to-earnings ratio can also double as a profitability ratio because 
it’s a common barometer of value that many investors and analysts look at. 
I cover this topic in Chapter 11, but because it’s such a critical ratio, I also 
include it here. The formula is
P/E ratio = Price (per share) ÷ Earnings (per share)
For example, if SHM’s stock price per share is $10 and the earnings per share 
are $1, the P/E ratio is 10 (10 divided by 1).

336
Par t VI: Appendixes 
 
The P/E ratio answers the question, “Am I paying too much for the company’s 
earnings?” Value investors find this number to be very important. Here are 
some points to remember:
 
✓ Generally, the lower the P/E ratio, the better (from a financial strength 
point of view). Frequently, a low P/E ratio indicates that the stock is under-
valued, especially if the company’s sales are growing and the industry is 
also growing. But you may occasionally encounter a situation where the 
stock price is falling faster than the company’s earnings, which would 
also generate a low P/E. And if the company has too much debt and the 
industry is struggling, then a low P/E may indicate that the company is 
in trouble. Use the P/E as part of your analysis along with other factors 
(such as debt, for instance) to get a more complete picture.
 
✓ A company with a P/E ratio significantly higher than its industry average 
is a red flag that its stock price is too high (or that it’s growing faster 
than its competitors).
 
✓ Don’t invest in a company with no P/E ratio (it has a stock price, but the 
company experienced losses). Such a stock may be good for a specula-
tor’s portfolio but not for your retirement account.
 
✓ Any stock with a P/E ratio higher than 40 should be considered a specu-
lation and not an investment. Frequently, a high P/E ratio indicates that 
the stock is overvalued.
 
When you buy a company, you’re really buying its power to make money. In 
essence, you’re buying its earnings. Paying for a stock that’s priced at 10 
to 20 times earnings is a conservative strategy that has served investors well 
for nearly a century. Make sure that the company is priced fairly, and use the 
P/E ratio in conjunction with other measures of value (such as the ratios in 
this appendix).
Price to sales ratio (PSR)
The price to sales ratio (PSR) helps to answer the question, “Am I paying 
too much for the company’s stock based on the company’s sales?” This is a 
useful valuation ratio that I recommend using as a companion tool with the 
company’s P/E ratio. You calculate it as follows:
PSR = Stock price (per share) ÷ Total sales (per share)
This ratio can be quoted on a per-share basis or on an aggregate basis. For 
example, if a company’s market value (or market capitalization) is $1 billion 
and annual sales are also $1 billion, the PSR is 1. If the market value in this 
example is $2 billion, then the PSR is 2. Or, if the share price is $76 and the 

337
 Appendix B: Financial Ratios
total sales per share are $38, the PSR is 2 — you arrive at the same ratio 
whether you calculate on a per-share or aggregate basis. For investors trying 
to make sure that they’re not paying too much for the stock, the general rule 
is that the lower the PSR, the better. Stocks with a PSR of 2 or lower are con-
sidered undervalued.
 
Be very hesitant about buying a stock with a PSR greater than 5. If you buy a 
stock with a PSR of 5, you’re paying $5 for each dollar of sales — not exactly a 
bargain.
Price to book ratio (PBR)
No, this doesn’t have anything to do with beer, although I am enjoying a cold 
Pabst Blue Ribbon as I write this! The price to book ratio (PBR) compares a 
company’s market value to its accounting (or book) value. The book value 
refers to the company’s net equity (assets minus liabilities). The company’s 
market value is usually dictated by external factors such as supply and 
demand in the stock market. The book value is indicative of the company’s 
internal operations. Value investors see the PBR as another way of valuing 
the company to determine whether they’re paying too much for the stock. 
The formula is
Price to book ratio (PBR) = Market value ÷ Book value
An alternate method is to calculate the ratio on a per-share basis, which 
yields the same ratio. If the company’s stock price is $20 and the book value 
(per share) is $15, then the PBR is 1.33. In other words, the company’s 
market value is 33 percent higher than its book value. Investors seeking an 
undervalued stock like to see the market value as close as possible to (or 
even better, below) the book value.
 
Keep in mind that the PBR may vary depending on the industry and other 
factors. Also, judging a company solely on book value may be misleading 
because many companies have assets that aren’t adequately reflected in the 
book value. Software companies are a good example. Intellectual properties, 
such as copyrights and trademarks, are very valuable yet aren’t fully covered 
in book value. Just bear in mind that, generally, the lower the market value is 
in relation to the book value, the better for you (especially if the company has 
strong earnings and the outlook for the industry is positive).
