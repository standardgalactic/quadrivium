About the Author
E. Phil Haley is a truck driver and equipment operator living in Anchorage,
Alaska, and writes articles about wireless Internet access and security. Phil
first started driving trucks in September 1979, and his most recent over-
the-road experience has been with Leavitt’s Freight Service of Springfield,
Oregon, where he enjoyed the challenge of hauling long loads. During his
over-the-road adventures, he travels with two laptops (one for work and one
for fun), a handful of wireless adapters, more antennas than any one person
should own, and a wireless signal amplifier (just in case). When he’s not dri-
ving or surfing the Web, he can usually be found in one truck stop or another
extolling the virtues of wireless Internet access to anyone in earshot or help-
ing a new convert get set up for wireless Net surfing. Phil also maintains (or,
more often, fails to maintain) theCyberTruckStop.com. 


Dedication
This book is dedicated to the memory of Darrell R. Meyer; friend, mentor and
trucker extraordinaire. 1948 - 2004
Author’s Acknowledgments
A lot of people at Wiley Publishing worked as hard, or harder, than I did to
produce a book that provides solid, accurate, useful, and usable information.
Acquisitions Editor Melody Layne presented me with the opportunity to
author this book and, for that, I’ll be forever grateful. Further, the initial guid-
ance of Melody Layne, Editorial Manager Leah Cameron, and Project Editor
Becky Huehls, each of them giving me important pointers, got this book
started off on the right foot. I feel particularly fortunate to have had Becky
Huehls assigned as the Project Editor. To say that I’m thankful for the work
she so skillfully performed, and for her guiding hand, is an understatement of
immense proportion.
A few others at Wiley Publishing to whom I’m grateful for their contribution
of hard work and application of skill include Senior Copy Editor Barry Childs-
Helton, Copy Editor Heidi Unger, and Copy Editor Virginia Sanders. They all
made sure that, among many other things, my misuses of the English language
got put right and rendered readable. Technical Editor Steven Fletcher pointed
me back toward the path of accuracy whenever I strayed. Project Coordinator
Jennifer Theriot ensured the illustrations and layout went smoothly, while 
Ms. Brooke Graczyk took my chicken scratch drawings and turned them into
useful works of art. (I don’t know how she did that.) 
Flying J Communications, Bill Bingaman of Highway Hotspots, Michael
Ginsberg of EVDOinfo.com, Bill Adams of InternetAnywhere.us, Max Mattia of
OrbitalEnterprises.net, Brian Shaffer representing RaySat, Rebecca Schnall at
Sirius Radio, and Fritz Roland Bjorklund at the Drivers Daily Log, all made
contributions and my thanks go out to them. 
Finally, I’m thankful for, and grateful to, my wife; Sue Ann Haley. There’s just
no way I could’ve completed this book without her help and support. She
never lost faith in my abilities, even when I was sure she was imagining their
existence. I thank God for her every day.

Introduction
T
he other day I was watching The Andy Griffith Show. It was an episode 
I’ve probably seen ten thousand times. (You think I’m exaggerating, don’t
you? There’s a reason I own TAGS on DVD.) Andy was using a phone stuck on
the wall in his kitchen to talk with Aunt Bea, who was in Mt. Pilot. In order to
let Opie talk to her, Andy had to lift him up to the mouthpiece. When I first
started lugging a laptop around the country with me, I felt kind of like Andy
and Opie; I had to bring the laptop to the phone if I wanted to connect to the
Internet — and the phone wasn’t always located in the most comfortable or
convenient places.
All that changed for me when truck stops began offering the possibility of
making a wire-free connection to the Internet. Suddenly, from almost any-
where in the facilities or on the lot, I could get online easily (what a concept).
I love the freedom afforded me by having the option of making a wireless con-
nection to the Internet — and now, whether you’re traveling the highways in
a truck or RV, using the facilities of (say) a campground or truck stop, it’s
possible for you to enjoy that freedom, too.
About This Book
There are, quite literally, millions of books — and they collectively contain
more information than any one person could ever hope to comprehend. Just
for the sake of argument, though, let’s say you had, in fact, both read and
comprehended all that information. . . . So what? Knowledge is only half the
battle. At some point in time, for knowledge to be an asset, you’ve got to get
up out of your chair, walk out of the classroom, and actually do something
with that information.
Among this book’s goals is a dual purpose: (1) providing you with both the
information you need about the whys and wherefores of making a wireless
Internet connection in an over-the-road environment, and (2) showing you
some ways you can use that knowledge to meet specific Wi-Fi needs in the
real world.

By the way, this book does make reference to a lot of Wi-Fi paraphernalia —
including hardware, software, and services that can make your over-the-road
lifestyle easier, better, or more fun (at least where computers or electronics
are concerned). But don’t think you absolutely must have everything all at
once. I recognize that everyone’s needs and desires are different; you might
need or want some items now, some later, and some never. I offer all these
marvels for your consideration — and I do my best to provide enough infor-
mation so you can decide whether any product, program, or service deserves
a place in your Internet toolbox.
Foolish Assumptions
Ever since I was a kid — after my dad first showed me how the word “assume”
breaks down — I’ve been hesitant to make assumptions, believing them all to
be foolish. But I’m going out on a limb here; for the sake of writing a useful
book, I assume that
 You’re seriously considering the inclusion of a computer in the list of
equipment that accompanies you in your over-the-road travels.
 Your computing experience ranges from “Yes, I’m aware that computers
do exist” to “I use a computer at home and in my business every day.”
 You want to make secure, wire-free connections to the Internet from vari-
ous locations on or near the highways and byways of our great country.
How This Book Is Organized
I first read John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath while in high school and,
since that time, I’ve wanted to write The Great American Novel. This isn’t it,
but that’s okay, because it isn’t a novel (great or otherwise), and you don’t
have to read it like one. If you like, you can start at the end or read the chap-
ters you find most interesting first. The whole book is a beginning, of sorts —
and, as such it doesn’t really have an ending as long as your over-the-road
adventure goes on. (Whoa. Deep.) I did, however, organize the parts and
chapters in a way that builds logically, to a certain extent, from one subject
to another — so if you’re a beginner (or just new to Wi-Fi), you might want to
read the book one chapter after the other.
Additionally, even if you’re relatively experienced, you might want to read
chapters containing information that you’re familiar with. After all, in the words
of R. Buckminster Fuller, “You can never learn less; you can only learn more.”

This book is broken up into seven parts, each part is made up of two to four
chapters — and that’d be them coming up now. . . .
Part I: The Wonderful World 
of Wireless Fidelity
If you’re just getting your feet wet with wireless Internet connectivity, you
may have questions ranging from “How does wireless work?” to “How do I get
started?” In this part, I help you to
 Discover the basics of wireless Internet access, as well as ways in which
it can enhance your over-the-road computing experience (Chapter 1).
 Identify the various wireless standards and decide which standard most
suits your needs (Chapter 2).
 Find and buy hardware devices that are especially well suited for use in
your over-the-road environment (Chapter 3).
 Get your wireless gear set up and running smoothly (Chapter 4).
Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged
After you’ve got your gear sorted out and set up, you’re ready to surf the Net
without wires. In this part, I help you to
 Identify and use the directories and devices that can get you to friendly
locations from which to make a wireless connection to the Internet
(Chapter 5).
 Set up an account, get connected at the hotspot of your choice, and
handle issues like troubleshooting and e-mail (Chapter 6).
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap
Even though wireless Internet access is a rapidly spreading phenomenon, there
are still a few gaps in coverage. In this part, I take a look at some methods you
can use to make an alternate connection. For example, I help you to
 Discover some ways cellular data services and equipment can help you
connect your computer to the Internet when there’s not a hotspot — or
even a building — in sight (Chapter 7).

Introduction

 Use dialup effectively, efficiently, and enjoyably when it’s your only hope
of getting connected. I also tell you about a product that can make dialup
a lot more convenient to use. (It’s all in Chapter 8.)
 Explore the potential of using a satellite to make your connection to the
Internet (Chapter 9).
Part IV: Securing Your Information
When you’ve made a wireless Internet connection, it’s nice to know there are
steps you can take to make it secure. In this part I show you how to
 Identify and neutralize threats to your security (Chapter 10).
 Easily encrypt your data and information (Chapter 11).
 Make a secure connection, from a remote location, to a computer at your
home or office (Chapter 12).
Part V: Taking Care of Business
Communication and paperwork are tenets of business — and, by using your
computer and the Internet, your over-the-road office can help you be more
efficient and increase your profits. In this part, I explore:
 Making low-cost calls over the Internet (Chapter 13).
 Finding and using various tools that can help you increase your income,
save time, save more money, and maintain records (Chapter 14).
Part VI: Entertaining Electronics
You can’t spend all your time working! In this part, I help you find a few ways
to relax and have some fun with your electronic devices. For example, I tell
you a little bit about
 Getting and using satellite radio (Chapter 15).
 A few ways to use your computer as an audio-and-video entertainment
center (Chapter 16).

Over-the-Road Wireless For Dummies 

Part VII: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book includes a Part of Tens, and this one’s no exception.
In Chapters 17 and 18, I take a look at ten (or so) ways to accessorize your
over-the-road electronics and ten free software applications that can enhance
your computing experience. Check ’em out.
Conventions Used in This Book
Fortunately, for both you and me, the editors of this book have taken great
pains to ensure that certain conventions are consistently applied throughout
this book. Conventions assist in avoiding confusion by standardizing certain
elements of a book. A few of the conventions used here include the following:
 New terms — such as conventions — are presented in italics and then
either defined or explained in the text that follows.
 A URL (Web address), or anything you need to type into a text-entry
field, is presented in monofont; like this: www.jiwire.com.
 Italics are also used as placeholders in a URL, and might look like this:
www.somewebsite.com.
 Arrows indicate a continuity of activity, usually a sequence of mouse
clicks. Choose File➪New, for example, means to click the File menu and
then choose the New option on that menu.
Icons Used in This Book
The Tip icon marks tips (duh!) and shortcuts that you can use to make find-
ing, buying, setting up, or using Wi-Fi-related hardware, software, utilities, or
accessories easier.
The Remember icons mark information that’s especially important to know.
To siphon off the most important information in each chapter, just skim
through these icons.
5
Introduction

The Technical Stuff icon marks information of a highly technical nature that
you can normally skip over (until things get, well, technical).
The Warning icon tells you to watch out! It marks information that may save
you headaches, heartaches, time, or even money.

The Wonderful
World of Wireless
Fidelity

In this part . . .
T
he central theme is getting set up with all the gear you
need to make a wireless Internet connection. Of course,
before you dash out the door on your hunt for hardware,
you want to have a basic understanding of the way Wi-Fi
(wireless fidelity) works. Although my well-informed and
highly entertaining sock puppets refused to assist me
(something about putting pens in their mouths), I promise
that by the time you get done reading Chapters 1 and 2,
you’ll know more about Wi-Fi than do most people (or
sock puppets). Armed with this knowledge (and with the
help of Chapter 3), you can plunk down your cash with
confidence. After you get your money spent and bring the
doodads home, you can use Chapter 4 to get everything
set up and fully operational.

Chapter 1
Taking the Wi-Fi Highway 
In This Chapter
 Discovering Wi-Fi on the highway
 Looking at your choices
 Breaking down the parts of wireless access
 Meeting your over-the-road wireless needs
E
ven though I think anybody choosing an over-the-road lifestyle has got to
have adventurer’s, explorer’s, or maybe even pirate’s blood running
through their veins, I appreciate the fact that few are those who blaze new
trails through unknown territory. Myself, I’m no Captain Kirk; adventure or
not, I prefer to go where at least a few people have gone before. I always get a
little nervous when kids come running out of their houses to watch the big
truck go by. Well, the Wi-Fi highway’s been paved, the kids have become
bored with the passing traffic, and it looks like it’s here to stay.
If it’s new to you, then you might feel a little anxious about taking the on-
ramp. Don’t be; the weather’s great, the curves and slopes are gentle, and the
scenery’s always interesting. Some parts of the highway — even though it’s
fairly new — are being repaired and improved upon; other parts, though
passable, are still under construction. Just think of me, someone who’s been
down this road before, as a fellow traveler.
Why Wireless?
In the sociology of science, there are two competing theories regarding tech-
nological development. One of them, the genius theory, holds the view that
inventors or scientists make discoveries independent of any outside influ-
ences, just because they’re so darn smart. The other theory, known as deter-
ministic theory, holds the view that social and environmental forces, the
needs and desires of the people, require that inventions or discoveries be
made, and that the individual making them is incidental to the process.

Personally, I think a combination of genius and environment — both social
and technological — must be necessary for invention.
For example, wireless technology — from home phones to cellphones to 
computers — has been developed (if not by geniuses, then at the very least
by people a whole lot smarter than me) in response to the unmet needs and
desires of those wishing to roam freely while staying connected. Wireless
phone handsets meet the needs of those who want to leave the kitchen or
bedroom while conversing; cellphones meet the needs of those desiring free-
dom of travel while maintaining their ability to reach out and touch — or be
touched by — someone. That’s environment and genius coming together,
meeting the needs of the populace; so it is with Wi-Fi.
Exploring the advantages
I’m thinking that shortly after the first phone cord was connected to a computer
(tethering both it and the user to a small and specific radius), somebody —
possibly an ungrateful son or a meddling daughter-in-law — began trying to
figure out how to cut the cord. When the first laptops hit the market, the
movement toward a wireless Internet connection hit high gear. Included
among the needs and desires that wireless Internet connection technology
strives to meet are the following:
 Convenience: I think this is the most attractive of all wireless Internet
attributes. When using a dialup connection, it’s sometimes difficult to
find a suitable spot from which to connect the cord. Because Wi-Fi does
away with the cord or cable, everyplace within range of the wireless
access point is suitable for use. (I explain wireless access points later in
this chapter.)
 Privacy: To a certain extent, this attribute goes hand-in-hand with free-
dom and convenience. I’ve seen RV parks that require dialup computer
users to sit in the office or laundry room, and truck stops usually rele-
gate dialup users to a noisy coffee shop or noisier TV room. When using
Wi-Fi you can, if you choose, sit comfortably in the privacy of your own
home on wheels.
 Speed: Download speeds for wireless broadband Internet connections
are typically as much as ten to twenty times faster than dialup. In
Chapter 2, I discuss Wi-Fi data-transfer speeds in greater detail.
 Ease of use: Yeah, okay, I hear you: “If it’s so easy to use, why do I need a
book?” Well, it really is easy to set up and use, but as with anything,
there’s a learning curve. Besides, I’ve got to make a living somehow.
 Reasonable cost: If you’ve already got a laptop or PDA, you can easily
and inexpensively adapt it for wireless Internet access. (I tell you more
about this in Chapters 3 and 4.) And Internet services, which I talk about
in Chapter 6, are usually reasonably priced, too.
10
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

So . . . what, no disadvantages?
Well, yes, I have to admit that for all its affirmative attributes, Wi-Fi does have
a few disadvantages. Among them, the following three are primary:
 Range: Because of federally mandated power limitations — as well as
the attributes of a high-frequency radio signal — Wi-Fi has a limited
range. Another factor influencing range is interference; in a truck stop or
RV park, that’s the usual result when signals are blocked or bounced by
trucks, trailers, and other RVs. I discuss increasing effective range in
Chapter 3.
 Roaming: Unlike cellphone providers, most of those providing wireless
Internet access have no roaming agreements. When, for example, you
sign up for service with Flying J, you need to be in or near a Flying J
facility in order to access the Internet. Flying J and others do provide
access in areas other than their own facilities — and they’re working on
other solutions as well. You get a look at the details of connecting to
hotspots (and examples of different plans) in Chapters 6.
 Security: Okay, you’re sending data using a radio signal, which means
someone could intercept your transmissions. It is possible, but in Part
IV, I discuss in detail methods of maintaining security and privacy.
Examining your options
If the allure of an untethered connection to the Internet beckons you forward,
you might wonder about your choices and options. Currently, the primary
methods of connecting to the Internet that are free from the tether of a phone
cord include the following:
 Wi-Fi: Believe it or not, even though it’s fully functional — and its use
and availability are rapidly expanding — this technology’s still in devel-
opment. Wi-Fi uses a high-frequency, low-power radio signal to transmit
and receive data. To use Wi-Fi, you must be within range of the access
point transceiver, which is known as a hotspot. I tell you more about this
in the next few sections.
 High-speed cellular: On a cellphone, data’s often carried separately
from voice; usually you need a data-service subscription in addition to
your voice-service subscription. I tell you more about cellular data ser-
vice in Chapter 7.
 Satellite: Requiring the use of some fairly expensive and specialized equip-
ment (not to mention a commitment to a hefty monthly subscription), this
option is most popular with those living full-time in their RVs. I tell you
more about satellite Internet in Chapter 9.
11
Chapter 1: Taking the Wi-Fi Highway

Taking the plunge
Of all the options available to you, the easiest and least expensive method of
making a wireless connection to the Internet is Wi-Fi. In order to get started
down the Wi-Fi highway, you need the following:
 Wi-Fi-enabled computer: There are two methods for enabling a laptop
or PDA for use in a wireless environment:
• Wi-Fi adapter: By using an inexpensive adapter, wireless capability
can be added to almost every laptop and most PDA devices. I tell
you more about finding adapters in Chapter 3 and more about set-
ting them up in Chapter 4.
• Integrated card: Most new laptop computers, and quite a few PDA
devices, come equipped with a built-in wireless card. If you’re
shopping for a new computer, I give you some helpful hints in
Chapter 3.
 Hotspot proximity: You need to be within the coverage area of the radio
transceiver, or access point, that has a wired or satellite connection to
the Internet. (I introduce hotspots in the “What the heck is a hotspot?”
section later in this chapter, and Chapter 5 explains how you can find
them.)
 Wireless Internet service provider: Better known as and often referred
to as a WISP, most hotspot operators are WISPs or they contract with
WISPs for service. In most cases, you can buy an hourly, daily, monthly,
or annual subscription to a WISP — as you discover in Chapter 6.
The Nuts and Bolts of Wi-Fi
To put it very simply, Wi-Fi uses a two-way radio signal instead of wires to
complete the connection between your computer and the wired connection
to the Internet. Also, instead of using slow dialup, the business end of a wire-
less Internet connection is usually high-speed DSL, cable, or T-1 line.
CB radios for computers
Sometime in the late ’50s or early ’60s, a couple of truckers stuck CB radios in
their rigs so they could irritate each other while heading down the highway.
Obviously, for radio communication to occur, both drivers had to install
radios — and each radio had to be capable of both transmitting and receiving
12
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

a signal. Such is the case with Wi-Fi. A few of the attributes and elements of
Wi-Fi radios are as follows:
 Transceiver: The ability to both transmit and receive as well as the abil-
ity to set and determine the circumstances under which each task is to
be performed.
 Antenna: As with a CB radio, the antenna must be capable of both receiv-
ing and transmitting a signal in a specific bandwidth. Most antennas are
integrated into wireless cards, but in some cases, it’s possible to add an
external antenna. (I talk more about antennas in Chapters 3 and 4.)
 Code/Decode: Known as a codec, this is the method by which (among
other things) digital data is converted into a radio signal and vice versa.
 Spread-spectrum signal: High-frequency radio signals used by Wi-Fi are
both low-powered and susceptible to interference. Wide-band, spread-
spectrum radio signals aren’t as sensitive to interference as narrow-band
signals — and they’re quite efficient at getting the most out of the lim-
ited power. They also help in avoiding traffic jams among radio signals,
which makes it possible for several Wi-Fi transceivers to operate at the
same time.

Chapter 1: Taking the Wi-Fi Highway
What have an actress and composer 
got to do with Wi-Fi?
For all of you who believe the abilities of enter-
tainers begin and end with their musical or
acting talents, read this: Just prior to the Amer-
ican entry into World War II, George Antheil, 
an American composer, and Hedy Kiesler
Markey — better known by her stage name,
Hedy Lamarr — got into a discussion over
dinner regarding torpedo guidance. Seems like
standard entertainer table talk. Ms. Lamarr,
who’d been married to an Austrian arms mer-
chant, was interested in the problems sur-
rounding torpedo guidance, and Mr. Antheil
understood multichannel synchronization (It’s 
a long story, involving propellers and player
pianos). Together they developed — and in
August 1942 were granted a patent for — 
what they called a “Secret Communication
System.” They hoped the SCS would eliminate,
through the use of “frequency hopping,” the
possibility that the enemy might jam torpedo
radio-guidance systems.
Frequency-hopping technology, which couldn’t
be used until radio technology caught up to 
it in the early ’60s, formed the foundation for the
spread-spectrum radio transmissions that all
the Wi-Fi standards use. The first 802.11 stan-
dard employed frequency-hopping spread spec-
trum (FHSS), and the 802.11b standard uses
direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS).
Building on these concepts, orthogonal 
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), on
which the 802.11g standard is based, was devel-
oped and implemented. (Try saying that five
times fast.)

What the heck is a hotspot?
The basic definition of a hotspot is a wireless local-access network (WLAN)
that’s open to the public. So, what, you ask, is a WLAN? It is — and I’ll never
understand why the acronym gods didn’t call it a LAWN — nothing more than
two or more computers networked together using Wi-Fi. There are two pri-
mary types of WLANs:
 Ad-hoc: Also known as peer-to-peer networks, computers in an ad-hoc
WLAN communicate with each other directly. By switching your Wi-Fi
cards to ad-hoc mode, you and a nearby neighbor can create a WLAN to
play games, for example.
 Infrastructure: This is the type of WLAN all hotspots use. It’s also the
most commonly used form of WLAN in home or business and is some-
times referred to as a client-server WLAN. There are two basic elements
to an infrastructure WLAN, as shown in Figure 1-1.
• Client: Any computer included in the WLAN, accessing the Internet
via the access point, is known as a client.
• Access point: An access point is a Wi-Fi transceiver that’s connected
directly or by satellite to the Internet. The access point serves, or
distributes, the Internet connection to the client computers within
the network.
Hotspots are WLANs open to the public, but you typically need to provide a
password before you can open a hotspot’s gateway to the Internet. You can
think of an access point like a castle that freely drops the drawbridge over
the moat, allowing entry into the gateway tunnel, but opening the gate to the
interior only after the visitor gives the proper password.

Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

Deciding on the Best Route
One thing I’ve found in my experience with over-the-road types is that every-
body’s situation is vastly different. Because of that, I’m not likely to come up
with a universal solution to the question of how long any Wi-Fi subscription
should be, which WISP you should subscribe to, whether you should main-
tain a dialup account, or whether you should choose to sign up with a cellu-
lar carrier for data service.
What I can do is give you as much information as possible so that, hopefully,
it’ll become clear which route is the most beneficial and economical to you. I
can also get you started in your decision process.
If you’re a trucker
For years upon years, I’ve been told by countless truckers that they don’t
spend much time in truck stops. Right. All those trucks I see clogging the lots
must be mirages, merely Fig Newtons of my amalgamation. Face it; trucks stop
at truck stops. You and I might prefer to spend time elsewhere, but the last time
I checked, almost no one else wants a truck parked in their lots any longer than
it takes to unload the products necessary for them to do business.
That means a truck stop WISP will probably provide you with the best Wi-Fi
service. Still, depending on whether you haul peaches or couches, the plan
and provider best suited to you might be drastically different. For example,
are you a trucker . . . 
 With a dedicated route? If you haul the same freight over the same route
week after week, year after year, it’s likely that you make the same stops.
Are the truck stops you frequent all in the same chain? If they are, signing
up for an annual Wi-Fi subscription can save you some money over the
long term. If your stops run the gamut of travel plaza chains, could you
alter your stops so that an annual subscription might be feasible?
 Traveling far and wide? If you’re never heading in the same direction
two weeks in a row, or you rarely spend three nights a week in a truck
stop of the same chain, you might consider paying for Wi-Fi by the day,
using dialup as a backup. If, however, you can plan to be in a position to
use the same WISP three or four nights a week, you can save a few bucks
by signing up for a monthly or annual plan. (I talk more about using
dialup as a backup in Chapter 8.)
 Hauling over-dimensional loads? Having hauled over-dimensional
freight (think WIDE LOAD), I know how hard it can be to park within
sight of the facilities. Because that’s where the access point is most
often located, you might be parked, quite often, too far away to make a
connection. If that’s the case, you might want to investigate a high-speed
cell data plan. (See Chapter 7 for more information.)
15
Chapter 1: Taking the Wi-Fi Highway

The level of Internet access that you require each day, week, or month is a
primary consideration in determining the type and level of wireless Internet
service you subscribe to. If, for example, you check your e-mail or surf the
Net a couple of times a week, you might want to pay by the day. You also
might, however, want to spin through the chapters in Parts V and VI for ways
to get more use out of your computer and the Internet.
In Chapter 6, among other things, I compare the plans and costs offered by
the major truck stop WISPs. Surprisingly, some of the most competitively
priced and widely available Wi-Fi in the nation is provided by the truck-stop
and travel-plaza chains.
If you’re an RVer
How you use your RV as well as the frequency with which you need access to
the Internet are the two most important considerations when determining
how wireless Internet access fits into your plans. The type and level of service
best suited to your needs is different depending on whether (for example)
you’re
 On vacation: If you’re only away from home for a couple of weeks, or
maybe, a month, it makes no sense whatsoever to sign up with a single
service for more than one or two days. Using dialup as a back-up,
though, does make sense — so you might want to check out Chapter 8
for some ideas about getting the most out of dialup on the road.
 On an extended trip: For trips longer than a month, it might be worth
your while to plan your trip in such a way that you can take advantage
of a month-to-month subscription. In Chapter 5, I tell you about some
ways to find RV-friendly hotspots, and in Chapter 6, I provide informa-
tion about the major WISPs servicing RV parks and campgrounds.
 Living in your RV: Especially if you need consistent and regular access
to the Internet, you might well consider investing in a satellite Internet
system, which I cover in Chapter 9.

Chapter 2
Selecting a Standard
In This Chapter
 Determining your over-the-road computer needs
 Making sense of the standards
 Ensuring cross-compatibility
 Comparing speeds and needs
W
henever I deal with computer-related technology, I’m constantly con-
fronted with a confusing array of choices filled with ever-present abbre-
viations, acronyms, and standards. It sometimes seems (at least to me) that the
menu of available solutions far exceeds the corresponding list of problems. If
the problem is (say) lunch, sooner or later you have to order up — and that
means finding your way around the menu.
That’s why this chapter helps you decide which wireless standard best 
suits your over-the-road needs. Along with demystifying the mind-numbing
menagerie of wireless standards you face, I explain how you can be sure any
and all of the equipment you buy will work wherever you go. I’ll also help you
separate the wheat from the chaff when you’re deciding on a standard.
Matching Purpose to Standard
Okay, a word about standards: They’re guidelines that keep computer equip-
ment and software reasonably consistent in the way they work. That’s why
(for example) you can make a good wireless connection regardless of who
made your equipment. It makes good sense to use the standard that best meets
your needs. And that means paying attention to some everyday details.
When I’m faced with a myriad of choices, I find it helpful to first focus on my
purpose — the goal I’m trying to achieve or the problem I’m trying to solve.
After that’s clearly identified, I can investigate various ways to meet those

goals and solve those problems. For example, when I’m picking up freight
requiring multiple deliveries, I’ve got to load it so the last product on is the
first product off. But I’ve also got to load it so each set of axles is weighted in
accordance with laws and standards. The first order of business is to get
loaded; but how do you decide what part of the problem to tackle first?
Defining your primary purpose
I’m going to guess that at least one reason (likely the primary reason) you’re
interested in Wi-Fi is that you want to connect to the Internet from the quiet
and comfort of your truck or RV. You want to browse the Web, send and
receive e-mail, or conduct business without the noise and distraction of 
a coffeehouse or restaurant.
So, if that’s the case (I’ll go out on a limb and assume it is), then your primary
goal is to connect to the Internet, from nearly anywhere, minus the quarter-
mile of telephone cord. Yeah, that was my main goal, too — but a few other
qualifying factors also enter into consideration. Those pesky industry stan-
dards, for example. . . .
Identifying secondary goals
A tale from days of old — before personal computers (hard to believe, isn’t
it?) — shows how technology standards can influence your goals. Back when
home video was just starting to catch on, two competing standards fought to
dominate the videocassette market: Beta and VHS. Beta produced higher-quality
images than VHS, but VHS became the most widely accepted standard — for
reasons that had nothing to do with image quality.
Both VHS and Beta fulfilled the primary purpose — transferring video to 
tape — but as VHS became more common, producers stopped putting out
Beta versions of their movies. It was far more likely, then inevitable, that any-
thing you rented, borrowed, bought, or lent would be VHS. Beta (with its high
quality) was doomed. At that point, secondary considerations influenced the
choice between Beta and VHS: You had to put up with somewhat lower video
quality to have home video at all, because VHS was available and compatible
with most equipment on the market.
Okay, back to the future (that is, now): As wireless-connection equipment
crops up everywhere, standards are all over the map — and going through
their own struggle for dominance. So here are a couple of questions you’ll
want to answer for yourself as you settle on a Wi-Fi standard:
18
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

 Where will you be using your wireless connection? If you’re using 
only the hotspots in places like truck stops, coffee shops, motels, or RV
parks, then you can narrow your standard choices pretty drastically. If
you’ll be mixing your use between highway, home, and office, you’ll need
a standard that can handle all three. You’ll also need to make certain
that any equipment you purchase conforms to a standard that’s in wide
use and is interoperable (that is, plays nice) with other equipment that
conforms to the same standard.
 Will you be using Wi-Fi for purposes other than connecting to the
Internet? If connecting to the Internet to use e-mail or download basic
travel information is your one and only goal, then you’ll probably choose
a different standard than you would if (for example) you were looking to
get into head-to-head gaming or transferring large files (such as music or
video) from one computer to another.
Answering questions like these can give you a good grasp on why you want
wireless capabilities in your life in the first place. Then you can move ahead
with selecting a Wi-Fi standard that does the job for you.
Focusing on the Front-Runners
Although approximately 13 standards for wireless connectivity exist, fortu-
nately, you don’t need to become familiar with each and every standard. As
you delve deeper into the wireless world, the standards referenced most
often are 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g. Another standard that you’ll run
across — yet to be ratified but lurking on the horizon — is 802.11n. These
four standards define the protocols and specifications used to transfer data
via radio signals — so they’re the only ones for which you need a good work-
ing knowledge. Here’s the short course:
 The 802.11a standard specifies operation in the 5.0GHz band.
 The 802.11b, g, and n standards specify operation in the 2.4GHz fre-
quency band.
 Because 802.11a operates at a higher frequency, it has a shorter 
range and it’s more likely to be adversely affected by obstructions.
Consequently, this standard has found its niche in the wall-free world 
of corporate cubicles.
So which of these standards can do the job for you? Well, the following sec-
tions offer a brief rundown of the major attributes of the standards you’ll
encounter most often.
By getting a basic handle on standards, you can make better choices when
you’re buying wireless gear. Armed with the information in this chapter, you
can march to Chapter 3 for details of getting geared up.

Chapter 2: Selecting a Standard

802.11a: Connecting over short distances
This standard covers the 5GHz band; devices that comply with it are incompat-
ible with the 2.4GHz-band b, g, and n standards. 802.11a is most commonly
found in businesses that require a high-speed wireless network connection to
transfer files between desktop or laptop computers. If your primary goal is con-
necting to the Internet at hotspots — without getting all business-obsessed
about it — you can safely ignore this standard.
802.11b: Opting for the basic standard
802.11b is the standard that started the boom — and it’s best-suited for con-
necting to the Internet or for streaming audio or video.
 The theoretical maximum bandwidth (in effect, how fast data can be
transferred or transmitted) is 11 Mbps (See the following section for a
detailed explanation.)
 This is the standard hotspots currently use most often.
 Both the 802.11g and 802.11n standards are, or will be, backward-com-
patible with this standard.
Backward compatibility — a requirement of the 802.11 standard — means
that any new versions must be designed to work and play well with
older versions.
802.11g: The speedier standard
Ratified in 2003, this standard is quickly becoming the favorite for folks setting
up home networks (and yes, a RV counts as “home” — but you knew that).
 The theoretical maximum bandwidth is 54 Mbps.
 It’s most commonly found in home or business networks as well as
newly established hotspots. Some owners of established hotspots are
upgrading aging 802.11b equipment with new equipment that conforms
to 802.11g as well.
 It’s backward-compatible with the 802.11b standard.
 802.11g is, maybe, more than a home user needs, but it’s still well-suited
for connecting to the Internet for basic information. It also gets high
20
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

marks for streaming audio and video, head-to-head gaming, and transfer-
ring large files between computers on the same network.
 You can also go for 802.11g “enhanced.” This is sometimes called pre-n,
enhanced g, and by proprietary names such as SpeedBooster, Super G,
Xtreme G, and so on. It isn’t a standard in its own right; rather, it’s a vari-
ation of the 802.11g standard.
• Theoretical maximum advertised speeds up to 108 Mbps.
• Most often found in home networks.
• Generally compatible with the 802.11b and g standards, although
it’s not ideal for use in mixed-standard environments (the enhanced
abilities are usually lost).
If a hotspot uses, say, an access point conforming to 802.11g, but
client computers that conform to 802.11b, g, or even “enhanced g”
can still connect to it, it’s a mixed-standard environment.
• It’s best-suited for use in integrated “enhanced-g” networks. It’s
overkill for a basic Internet connection, but it shines at handling
streaming audio and video, gaming, and huge file transfers.
Connecting 802.11b and g devices in the same network won’t adversely affect
the speed of b-standard devices, but it will slow down the general perfor-
mance of the g-standard devices.
The difference in price between 802.11b- and 802.11g-standard equipment is
negligible. The use and popularity of the 802.11g standard is also beginning to
eclipse the older 802.11b standard. For these reasons — and because it offers
faster speeds in certain situations — 802.11g seems to be dominating in avail-
ability, compatibility, and utility.
802.11n: Looking to the future
This yet-to-be-ratified standard specifies a data-transfer rate of 100 Mbps —
equaling that of the wired Ethernet networks businesses use today. It will be
backward-compatible with both b and g.
Ensuring Compliance and Compatibility
Technology isn’t all innovation — when you get to the marketplace, it’s also
about consistent quality. You have to be able to trust it to do what it was
21
Chapter 2: Selecting a Standard

designed to do. For instance, when I was a kid my mom and dad wouldn’t
think of buying a lamp or toaster without the world-famous Underwriters
Laboratories seal of approval. UL developed, and still develops safety stan-
dards for a wide variety of products — and then certifies, through extensive
product testing, that manufacturers meet those standards. By purchasing
products certified safe by Underwriters Laboratories, my folks could rest
assured that unless our Dachshund chewed through a cord, my sister and I
22
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 
Who’s in charge here?
My guess is that as soon as the second com-
puter was completed, someone started figuring
out how to get the first one to communicate
with it. It’s also a pretty good bet that if any two
separate engineers developed devices to do
that job, the widgets they built would be com-
pletely different and entirely incompatible. After
all, computer engineers are resourceful and
innovative — in every possible direction. How
else could they come up with so many different
ways to achieve a single goal? Well, a quick
spin down the byway of history can clarify how
we got to this point.
Fortunately, the engineers themselves have
long recognized the importance of achieving
not only solutions to problems, but also solu-
tions that work and play well together.
Problems of compatibility (and their solutions)
go way back. In 1963, the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers (AIEE) and the Institute of
Radio Engineers (IRE) merged to form the
Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers
(IEEE). It would be difficult to imagine a better-
qualified group leading the charge to set tech-
nology standards that serve as the foundation
for developing a wide variety of compatible
computer-related devices.
The task of creating the first wireless standard
was placed in the capable hands of an IEEE
working group laboring under the name (well,
okay, number) 802.11. In 1997, when the struc-
ture of the first standard was fully defined,
developed and ratified, the working group,
beaming with the pride of a proud papa, named
it after themselves.
A couple of years later, with the birth (just as
proudly announced) of the fraternal twins
802.11a and 802.11b, the alphabet soup of stan-
dards was well on its way to rivaling the confu-
sion brought about by naming all the sons in the
Foreman family George.
Actually, each letter refers to a smaller group
within the 802.11 working-group, assigned the
task of expanding and enhancing, in very spe-
cific ways, the specifications of the original
802.11 standard. To date 13 different task groups,
ranging from 802.11a to 802.11n, have been
formed.
Okay, I can see you flipping fingers up as you
go through the alphabet, and those of you with
your socks off have discovered that from a to n
there are 14 letters. This is true. There will
never be an 802.11 l; that’s to avoid the possi-
bility of confusing the letter l with the letter i and
the number 1.

wouldn’t be zapped out of existence. Products that merited UL certification
also had to be of good-enough quality to keep it. Well, where quality and cer-
tification are concerned, the world of Wi-Fi is no less in need of a watchdog
organization.
Wireless networking was just starting to peek out of the corporate box at 
the end of the last century. So, to promote wireless networking by giving 
the public some confidence in the products they purchased, the computer
industry formed a trade group known as the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility
Alliance (WECA) in 1999. WECA certifies that products manufactured under
various wireless standards have the specs to meet those standards — and
that they’re interoperable with each other.
Somewhere along the line some sharp individual got the bright idea to trade-
mark the catchy name Wi-Fi. One thing led to another and, presto change-o,
WECA became the Wi-Fi Alliance — new name, same job. Wi-Fi Certified 
products can be identified by looking for the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED logo, shown 
in Figure 2-1.
The logo also includes a bit of information concerning which standard the
device meets and with which standards the device is compatible. Here’s 
the gist:
 Products displaying the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED logo are guaranteed to be inter-
operable with other Wi-Fi CERTIFIED products built to the same or com-
patible standards.
 Products built to the 802.11a standard (which doesn’t specify compati-
bility with any other standard) don’t have to be compatible with those
built to the 802.11g standard in order to be Wi-Fi certified.
 Products built to the 802.11g standard must be compatible with 802.11b.
In addition, because the Wi-Fi Alliance has certified their compliance
with the g standard, they’re guaranteed to interoperate with b-standard
products.

Speed Limits on the Cyberhighway
It’s true: After you finish a day of driving on our nation’s actual streets and
highways — wisely restricted by various speed limits — you’ll be facing simi-
lar limits on the cyberhighway. Unlike federal, state, and local authorities,
however, the people in charge of the cyberhighway are constantly searching
for ways to let us go faster.
What limits speed on the cyberhighway is the performance limit of internal
protocols and the wireless environment. So here’s a look at a few things that
limit speed — and a way to put it all into perspective: comparing real-world
speeds with typical Internet-connection speeds.
Measuring speeds in cyberspace
You can measure your speed on the highway by looking at a speedometer
indexed in miles per hour, kilometers per hour, or (sometimes) both.
Traveling at sixty miles per hour means you’re covering a distance of 1,056
inches every second — and, because you can easily tell an inch from a mile,
this measurement has meaning.
Data-transmission rates are commonly measured in bits per second (bps). So
what’s a bit? It’s both symbolic and real: In mathematical terms, it’s either a 1
or a 0; in electrical terms, it’s a state of being (respectively) either on or off.
By its lonesome, a bit is pretty insignificant — but if you put eight bits
together in a string, you get a byte — and then there are 256 possible combi-
nations of ones and zeros. That’s enough to represent all the individual let-
ters, numbers, spaces, and symbols necessary for communication.
It takes 32 bits of data (that is, 4 bytes), to represent a number such as 5828,
the number on the front of my house. If you wanted me to put a comma
between the 5 and the first 8, however, it would take eight more bits —
another byte — and I’d have to head for the hardware store to look for 
a copper comma.
Now, the 802.11b standard specifies a data-transmission rate of 11 Mbps —
and the M represents mega (a million). 11 Mbps, then, means data can be
transmitted at a rate of eleven million bits per second. If you put that in terms
of inches per second, that’d be like traveling down the highway at a speed of
625,000 miles per hour. (Oh yeah, that’d be a ticket.)
24
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

K (kilo) or M (mega) can be used in reference to communication or storage —
and there’s a slight difference in the value that depends on how it’s used.
When I’m talking about data-transmission rate, kilo means one thousand and
Mega means one million. If, however, I’m talking about a storage device —
say, your hard drive — then kilo refers to 1024 and mega refers to 1,048,576.
A small b used in an abbreviation refers to a bit; a capital B represents a byte.
Comparing advertised and 
actual wireless speeds
So you’re thinking that the 11Mbps speed of 802.11b is pretty fast, right?
Yeah, me too — but that’s a theoretical maximum speed. 11 Mbps won’t be
the actual speed at which data is sent. No, it isn’t a matter of truth in adver-
tising. Not exactly, anyway. Here’s why:
 The data isn’t all that’s traveling. A whole bunch of those bits being
blasted through the air form a virtual envelope, a sort of logical con-
tainer known as a packet. Your data is broken down into chunks, placed
in these packets, and sent. Each packet includes a lot of information
about where the data came from, where it’s going, how to reassemble it,
and so on. Believe it or not, this extra information — known as protocol
overhead — can take up 30 or 40 percent of the data stream.
 Speed varies depending on the environment the signal is traveling
through. The actual speed may, for a number of reasons, drop to as little 
as 1 Mbps. Due to distance or interference, the quality of the signal might
not be sufficient to support a bandwidth of 11 Mbps. In that case, the speci-
fications of the standard mandate the use of dynamic rate shifting — which
cuts the transmission speed in half, to 5.5 Mbps. If the conditions still
aren’t sufficient to support the 5.5Mbps speed, then the data gets slowed
down (by dynamic rate shifting) until it reaches a data-transmission rate
that can be supported.
When all is said and done, no matter which standard you end up utilizing,
you shouldn’t count on achieving more than 50 percent of the theoretical
maximum data-transmission rate. In reality it’ll probably be even less than
that. Okay, now that I’ve got you sufficiently bummed out, I’ve got some good
news (no, I didn’t save a bundle on insurance): A real-world speed of 4, 3, 2 
or even 1 Mbps is still faster than you’ll probably need for most of the things
you’re going to want to do with Wi-Fi — such as (for example) connecting to
the Internet.
25
Chapter 2: Selecting a Standard

Comparing common Internet-connection
speeds
Many moons ago (ah, to be younger, dumber, and blessed with more hair), I
tried connecting my laptop to the Internet by using my cellphone as a dialup
modem. I fried phone after phone before I finally gave up on that idea. Why
the fry (sorry about that)? The main reason was that the Internet download
speeds were only 19 Kbps. That was good enough for e-mail, but if I wanted
to surf the Net, I was out of luck: The simplest of Web sites appeared at glacial
speed, if at all. (On more than one occasion, I fell asleep while waiting.)
My cellphone created a bottleneck through which data, no matter how 
fast it’d been moving before it got to my phone, could only travel at no 
more than 19 Kbps.
No matter how fast any part of a connection might be, the overall speed of
the entire connection will be limited to the slowest portion.
It’s a pretty safe bet that the greatest limit on the performance you experience
with Wi-Fi will be the method used to connect the hotspot’s access point to
the Internet. Here’s a look at the most common connection scenarios:
 Dialup: Most of you are probably familiar with the earliest of Internet
connection methods. I, at one time, had a dialup connection rated at 28
Kbps (some of the earliest were between 7 and 10 Kbps), but for the
most part, dialup connections move data at a maximum rate of 56 Kbps.
 Broadband: Taking the form of a cable or DSL connection, broadband
speeds are typically in the 700Kbps range. Whenever I’ve checked my
cable connection speed, I’ve found it varies quite a bit. The lowest rate I
measured was 238 Kbps — and the highest was 768 Kbps. The DSL
providers in my area offer similar speeds.
 Satellite: Also known as Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT), a connec-
tion via satellite can take on many forms. Depending on the carrier and
connection plan, connection speeds can range from around 500 Kbps to
as high as 2 Mbps.
 T-1 line: Although not at the absolute top of the heap when it comes to
speed, a T-1 connection moves data at a pretty respectable rate — 1.544
Mbps. These connections can be pretty speedy; they’re found, most
commonly, as a connection for hotspots and businesses.
26
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

There are a few other, faster, methods of connecting to the Internet — but the
chances that you’ll ever run across a hotspot using one of them (say, a T-3 or
OC3 connection) is about equal to my chances of winning the Daytona 500 or
the Kentucky Derby: Don’t hold your breath.
Anyway, most hotspots you’ll encounter, like truck stops and large RV parks,
use either a high-speed satellite connection or a T-1 line as the method of
connecting the main access point to the Internet. Some of the smaller mom-
and-pop-operated hotspots, though, often employ a broadband cable or DSL
connection. For now, at least, it does the job. We’ll probably laugh about it
one of these days.
Picking the Standard That 
Meets Your Needs
Here we get back to the issues raised in the first portion of this chapter: After
you’ve identified your primary reason for wanting a wireless connection —
and reviewed what the various standards can (and can’t) do for you, you can
make an informed decision among the standards and choose one that works.
Here are some examples of identified needs and the standards that best meet
those needs:
 Connecting to the Internet at a hotspot. Almost every hotspot is con-
nected to the Internet at a rate no faster than about 1.5 Mbps. For that
reason, most of them utilize equipment (such as access points and
antennas) built around the 802.11b standard. Taking this into considera-
tion, 802.11b starts to look like the standard most likely to meet your
needs if your primary objective is making a basic connection to the
Internet.
 Hotspot Internet connections and connecting within a home network.
Because many home networks are built around the 802.11g standard
(and considering that 802.11g is backward-compatible with the 802.11b
standard in use at most wireless hotspots), it follows that the 802.11g
standard might well be a good choice here.
Of course, you’re not necessarily locked in to any one standard for all the
ways you use the Internet. Take a look at Chapter 3 to see the ways a laptop
can be adapted for more than one standard.

Gearing Up
In This Chapter
 Evaluating your OTR environment
 Choosing a laptop or a PDA
 Picking out a wireless adapter
 Extending wireless capacity
Joining in the fun and excitement of the Wi-Fi revolution may mean purchas-
ing some really cool computer gear. If you’re like me, just the thought of
buying computer-related equipment sends shivers of excitement down your
spine. (I even get those shivers at the thought of you buying some cool stuff.)
In this chapter, I help you shop for your gear by pointing out the major pieces
of equipment you need, as well as any features you should look for. I look at
ways to integrate the two most travel-friendly PCs — laptop and handheld —
into the freedoms and limitations of your over-the-road surroundings, and
enhance their capabilities to meet your needs better.
Surveying Your Needs Before You Shop
Before you run off to the CompuMart, take some time to think about what
equipment will best suit your over-the-road computing needs. (For example,
look at Chapters 13 and 14 if you’re still trying to figure out what those needs
are!) With your computing requirements in mind, think about matching the
conditions of your over-the-road (OTR) environment to the characteristics of
the equipment.
Because you’re traveling the highways in a vehicle that affords you more
room than those poor unfortunates trapped in the confines of an airplane
seat, your criteria for choosing a computing device and accessories will be
less constrained than theirs. You can have that laptop that weighs ten pounds
and sports a wide screen. You don’t need to limit yourself to a tiny ultra-
portable; you can have a big, full-featured, truck-size desktop replacement.

On the other hand, no matter the size of your rig, perhaps you’ve already got
stuff crammed into every nook, cranny, and cubbyhole. You’ve got a TV and
DVD player. You always seem to park so far from the truck-stop coffee shop
that you’ve considered strapping a scooter to the frame. Or you just don’t
want another shoulder-strap bag to carry into the truck stop or motel. But
you do want access to e-mail and browse the Web — so the Personal Digital
Assistant (PDA) might be just what you’re looking for.
Of course, choosing between laptop and PDA is just one piece of the puzzle.
You also need to think about issues and equipment that affect wireless con-
nectivity and usability. When it’s decision time, size up the contenders and
their offerings by how they fit with your honest evaluation of your work-
spaces and habits. The following list can help you sift the details:
 Durability: Whatever equipment you choose to use will be doing duty 
in an OTR environment; make certain that it’ll stand up to the job. The
device doesn’t need to be armor-plated, but do some research into
make, model, and manufacturer reputation for durability.
Laptops and PDAs are designed for travel, but durability isn’t necessar-
ily a given. Over the years, I’ve found the reviews, user ratings, and opin-
ions at Web sites such as www.cnet.com and www.epinions.com to
be excellent tools for judging roadworthiness.
 Adaptability: Whether you’re adapting a device, laptop or palmtop for
wireless, GPS, or any other function, you’ll need expandability via vari-
ous slots and ports. Most laptops have at least one PCMCIA slot and 
two USB ports — but twice as many would be really nice. The minimum
requirement for a PDA is a single Secure Digital or Compact Flash Type II
slot. If you can get both, great — and if you can get a USB port, even
better! (I dig into Wi-Fi adaptability later in this chapter, under the head-
ing “ Adapting Your Laptop or PDA for Wireless”; Chapter 13 tackles GPS.)
Even if you choose a computer with built-in Wi-Fi, you may have to use 
a wireless adapter when you’re on the road. Here’s why: Integrated wire-
less capability has proven more than adequate for use in busy airports
and coffee shops, where you often find those same fine folks from Silicon
Valley who designed ’em (coincidence? I think not). Apparently they never
figured out that some travelers enjoy a wireless Internet connection
while relaxing in the bunk of a truck or reclining on a couch in an RV —
sometimes parked in the back forty.
 Compatibility: Any device you choose has to be completely compatible
with every aspect of your OTR environment — not only the 802.11b/g
standards in use at the various hotspots, but also with you. Before buying
anything — whether PDA or laptop — give it a good going over at a local
retailer. Type on the keyboard, maneuver the mouse, and use as many of
the features (those enabled by the store, anyway) as you possibly can. It’s
your money; make sure you’re spending it on something you really like.
30
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

 Usefulness: Most likely, you’ll want to extend computer use beyond just
staying in touch. You can equip a laptop or PDA with a host of software
and components, ranging from voice recognition to GPS. Do you want to
watch DVDs? With a DVD drive, a large, wide-aspect-ratio LCD screen,
and a set of external speakers, your laptop becomes a home theater. Or
maybe you want to play games or catch up on your bills. Your computer
is a useful tool, but with some imagination, it can be a whole lot more.
 Convenience: It’s entirely possible to get excited about a product that
may not be as convenient as one would hope. A good example of this
might be an outdoor mounted directional antenna. (I tell you more about
antennas in a later section, “Extending Your Range.”) While the perfor-
mance of one of these antennas might be outstanding, consider whether
you’ll really want to set it up after a long day of driving.
 Memory and storage capacity: More is better, especially when it comes
to laptops. It’s possible to get by with minimum requirements, but most
people quickly outgrow a laptop system that’s configured with only 128
MB of RAM (Random-Access Memory) and a hard drive holding no more
than 20 GB. Look for at least 64 MB of RAM in a PDA. (I talk about PDA
memory and storage in the section headed “Keeping Life Compact with a
PDA,” later in this chapter.)
The speed and capacity of your laptop’s RAM (Random-Access Memory) will
have a greater impact on its overall performance than any other factor. If
you’re considering the purchase of a laptop and you’re going to splurge on
any one item, choose to buy more RAM.
You may have noticed that I haven’t mentioned desktop computers for use 
in a truck or RV. There’s a good reason for this. Aside from the room they
take up, desktop PCs are designed for use in a stationary home environment.
Unless you live on the San Andreas Fault, they’re not likely to move around
much, let alone be subjected to the jolts and vibrations of highway travel. A
few diehard folks have tried using a desktop in a truck or RV — you can too,
if you really insist — but by and large, resist the urge.
Living Large with a Laptop
If you find yourself interested in purchasing a laptop, you’re not alone. Laptop
sales have skyrocketed, surpassing those of desktops, as more and more
people are finding themselves attracted to the convenience of a truly portable
computer. After seeing an ever-increasing number of people in truck stops
toting laptops or PDAs, I made the decision to purchase a laptop of my own.
Initially, my anticipated computer use didn’t extend far beyond maintaining
e-mail communication with my family and friends. Even though I was really
31
Chapter 3: Gearing Up

excited to join the ranks of laptop-toting truckers, there was no way I envi-
sioned just how indispensable my portable PC would become. Before I knew
it, I’d found tons of things I could do with my laptop and I couldn’t imagine
leaving home without it. For example, besides just e-mailing and Web surfing,
I use my laptop to
 Download music: And, after amassing quite an eclectic collection, I can
burn some really entertaining CDs. (More about this in Chapter 16.)
 Maintain my OTR office: With the addition of a few software applica-
tions, I can find freight, keep a digital log book, balance my checkbook,
pay my bills, budget my income, and file my income tax returns. I can
even use my laptop as a phone. (Find out more about these subjects in
Chapters 13 and 14.)
 Find destinations: I used to call every shipper and receiver that I hadn’t
previously visited to get directions. After installing a GPS receiver and
mapping software, I’ve saved a ton of cellphone minutes that are better
used calling people I really want to talk with (even some who want to
speak with me!). I still make occasional calls to confirm appointments
but directions are a done deal. (More about GPS in Chapter 14.)
 Watch movies on DVD: I don’t download a lot of movies but I do rent
quite a few from Netflix. It usually works out pretty well. I take the movies
with me, drop ’em in the mail after viewing, and when I get home, new
ones are waiting. Blockbuster has a similar online service.
If you’re considering the purchase of a laptop as a way to enhance the enjoy-
ment of time spent traveling the highways, take a look at the next sections for
ideas to keep in mind while shopping.
Ensuring wireless capability
It’s hard to find a new laptop these days that doesn’t come with integrated
802.11b or 802.11g wireless capability (check out Chapter 2 for a full explana-
tion of wireless standards) — built-in wireless isn’t a strict necessity. Almost
every laptop has a standard PCMCIA (PC card) slot or USB port that allows
easy adaptation to wireless connectivity. Chances are good that the laptop
you choose will be equipped with multiple PC card slots and USB ports. Not
that you need a whole bunch of slots and ports to get connected the wireless
way, but having ’em can work to your advantage.
For example, using a wireless adapter that fits into one of your PC’s extra
slots can actually improve your ability to access a wireless signal. When
you’re parked in a space far, far away from the access point, the Wi-Fi signal
32
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

may be too weak for your integrated wireless to detect. If you plug a more
powerful adapter card into an extra laptop slot, you can probably pull in
those weak signals. (So what kind of adapter card do you need? Glad you
asked! Check the criteria for choosing a wireless adapter in “Adapting Your
Laptop or PDA for Wireless,” later in this chapter.)
Employing a Wi-Fi-friendly 
operating system
Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2) is the operating system you really
want installed on your laptop. Could you get by with Windows 98, SE, ME 
or 2000? You could but XP does everything the older systems do, with regard
to wireless Internet access, and much more. Additionally, many wireless
adapters and security programs aren’t compatible with the older operating
systems.
By employing Windows XP with SP2 as your operating system you assure
yourself that the hardware or software you purchase, at least for the foresee-
able future, will be compatible with your system. And Windows SP2 provides
an enhanced security infrastructure that defends against viruses, worms and
hackers.
Here’s one thing to keep in mind: Windows XP requires more memory than do
the Windows 98, SE, ME or 2000 operating systems. Microsoft indicates that
you need a minimum of 128MB of RAM to run Windows XP, but my recom-
mendation is that you consider 256MB to be your rock bottom minimum.

Purposeful laptop abuse tests durability
A couple of years ago, a PC-focused magazine
tested a handful of laptops to determine which
would stand up to the most abuse. Innocent and
unsuspecting laptops got dropped from a desk,
frozen, cooked, and kicked. I suspect the test-
ing staff enjoyed it; they spilled coffee on the
keyboards, slammed the lids, and inflicted a
host of other tortures. (Okay, maybe they didn’t
bounce the poor laptops down the road in the
cab of a truck or drop ’em out the door of a
Freightliner, but I’ve taken care of both those
tests.) Result: Every one of the laptops passed
the tests. Some took longer than others to
recover from the ordeal, but recover they did.
Laptops, at least the top brand names, are
becoming more and more durable as technol-
ogy progresses.

Scouting out durability
If you locate a laptop that looks and feels sturdy, has a special hard-drive-
protection system and sports a good set of latches, you may have found a
laptop suitable for traveling the road with you.
I’m asking you to trust your instincts here. If the lid and the case look flimsy
to you, then chances are that the machine isn’t the best choice for travel in a
truck or RV. If the outside looks wimpy, you’ve really got to wonder how
tough the inside is.
Take the time to check out your purchases for features that scream durability.
The following list gives you a couple of specifics to look for:
 Hard-drive protection systems: Manufacturers offer different types of
systems designed to protect a laptop’s hard drive. Active systems such
as IBM’s APS (Active Protection System) and Toshiba’s EasyGuard focus
primarily on safeguarding machines that are dropped, bumped, or expe-
rience excessive vibration while in use. Dell’s StrikeZone is a passive
system, which surrounds the drive bay with rubber shock absorbers in
an attempt to protect the hard drive from bumps and bruises when the
laptop is in use or in transit. Check out Table 3-1 for a rundown of some
models and their spin on hard-drive protection.
 LCD screen protection: The main protection for the fragile LCD screen is
the laptop lid. I sometimes have to dig my laptop out from under a pile
of junk before using it, so its sturdy case and well-designed lid serve to
protect the fragile (did I mention it’s fragile?) LCD screen. When you’re
shopping for a new laptop, look closely at the construction and quality
of the lid and latches. For example, one nice feature of IBM ThinkPad lids
is the double latch; with a latch near each corner, the lid can’t be bent at
the corners when it’s closed, and the display screen can’t be distorted.
You can see that the lid has a direct impact on how well the LCD screen
is protected; better protection helps ensure screen longevity.

When you’re shopping for a laptop, you would do well to place Dell Latitude,
Toshiba Tecra, HP Compaq, and IBM (Lenovo) ThinkPad laptops near the top
of your shopping list. Each of these manufacturers offers a measure of protec-
tion for the hard drive that goes beyond (in some cases, far beyond) the pro-
tection afforded by the outer shell of the laptop itself.
Another laptop line at which you might want to look closely is manufactured
by TwinHead and sold under the Durabook brand. The model N15RI, for exam-
ple, features a magnesium case with rubber protection surrounding both the
LCD screen and hard disk drive. The keyboard and touchpad are also spill-
resistant. You can get more information at http://usa.twinhead.com.

for more valuable information about what to consider, and what to ignore,
when purchasing a laptop.
Keeping Life Compact with a PDA
The original purpose of the PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), also known as a
handheld or palmtop, was simply PIM (Personal Information Management).
I’ve always been just a little bit jealous of people who found it necessary to
carry a PDA around with them. They always seem to live such full and inter-
esting lives. I mean, just ask someone who owns one to join you for lunch, or
even coffee. The very first thing your friend does is whip out a PDA to check
that busy schedule. After this consultation comes the overcommitted response.
35
Chapter 3: Gearing Up

(You know: “Sorry, ohhhhh, it looks like I’m scheduled to change the air in my
tires, give my cat a bath, and apply for astronaut training this afternoon.
Maybe we can get together after I get back from the moon.”)
Whatever . . . my life’s just never been so busy that I felt the need to schedule
it minute by minute, so if PIM were all that a PDA was really good for, I wouldn’t
even include it here for your consideration. With better screens, faster proces-
sors, more memory, and greater expandability, these PDAs (such as the one
shown in Figure 3-1) have become a whole lot more than digital card catalogs
and calendars.
To get the full use and benefit of a PDA, it’s really necessary to have a com-
puter at home. Most software programs, for example, must be loaded onto a
PC and then transferred, by means of a USB cable or cradle, in a process
known as syncing.
That’s not to say that the PIM function of a PDA is a total waste of time —
quite the contrary. But these handy and compact devices are capable of that
and a whole lot more — for example, a well-equipped PDA can 
 Browse the Web: With a decent Web browser (I discuss PDA Web
browsers later in this section) and an Internet connection you can surf
the Web and e-mail with a PDA in a fashion similar to (although maybe
not exactly the same as) that of a laptop or desktop PC.
 Recognize handwriting: My dad was a math whiz. He communicated
best by scribbling equations on restaurant napkins while we sipped
coffee. I usually only made it through the first napkin. If he could’ve writ-
ten on a PDA, we’d have saved several trees (and I could have taken the
equations to a math professor to explain what my dad was telling me). If
you write a lot of napkin notes, then you’ll love this feature.

 Recognize your voice: Okay, this isn’t Star Trek (you’ll probably feel
more like Captain Dork than Captain Kirk while talking to your PDA) but
you’ve got to admit it’s a cool idea. Several application programs, for
both laptops and PDAs, will get you an answer to the salutation
“Computer . . .” (even if you don’t want to do it too often in public).
 Get directions to your destination: Some PDAs (like those built by
Garmin) are GPS-mapping devices first and foremost; most others can be
easily adapted for GPS capability, a wide variety of mapping applications
are available for both Palm and Windows Mobile platforms.
 Play games and download music and video: Your PDA can do double
duty as a miniature entertainment center. In addition to tons of games,
you can use software applications to listen to favorite tunes, watch TV,
and show movies. Get ready to squint, though. Those tiny screens won’t
provide you with an experience anything like you can get with a PC.
 Store and sort business and personal info: This is where the PIM func-
tion of a PDA really shines. I’ve always carried a little black book (well,
actually the cover had a “Marvin the Martian” theme) with phone 
numbers, addresses, and driving directions; a PDA makes it no longer
necessary.
If you’ve decided, for whatever reason, that a PDA sounds like the answer to
your prayers, then carefully consider the ideas covered in the following sec-
tions as you begin shopping for the perfect PDA.
Deciding on an operating system
The operating system (OS) you choose will, to some extent, determine the
brand of handheld device you choose. For some obscure reason, those PDAs
that use the Palm OS are known by the generic term PDA while a device
designed to use the Windows Mobile OS is called a Pocket PC. These two
operating platforms dominate the market. There are others, like BlackBerry
and Symbian, but they’re largely utilized by the makers of a variation on the
PDA known colloquially as the smartphone.
As you might expect, PDAs manufactured by Palm use the Palm OS — but so
do those made by Sony and Garmin. Pocket PCs, using the Windows Mobile
2003SE (or the latest iteration, Windows Mobile 5.0) OS are manufactured by
Asus, Dell, Fujitsu, HP and Toshiba, among others.
You might think I’m going to recommend one of these operating systems. You
might be wrong. For good reason — each operating system has a vast follow-
ing of fiercely loyal fans. Okay, I wasn’t overly impressed with the early itera-
tions of the Windows Mobile OS, but the two newer versions (2003SE and 5.0)
are both strong competition for the Palm OS.
37
Chapter 3: Gearing Up

When you’re choosing an operating system, keep the following items in mind:
 The Windows Mobile platforms, since they’re diminutive versions of the
Windows desktop OS, will be quite familiar to those who already have
experience with a Windows-based laptop or desktop. The Palm platform,
on the other hand, is simple to use and said by many to be intuitive.
Being somewhat dense, myself, I usually don’t find any operating sys-
tems (or program applications for that matter) to be intuitive — I have
to commit the complete user manual to memory. That being said, even I
find the Palm OS extremely simple to use.
 Microsoft produces both Windows Mobile OS and Microsoft Office appli-
cations (such as Outlook, Word, and Excel), so it makes sense that
Pocket PCs can interface easily with these applications. Palm, however,
also offers several PDAs that work almost equally well with these appli-
cations. If you happen upon a model that doesn’t, an application such as
Dataviz Documents to Go can ease compatibility problems.
All program applications written for PDAs and Pocket PCs are intended
for use on those devices. You can’t use desktop programs on a PDA or
Pocket PC, and their program applications aren’t compatible with desk-
tops or laptops. Some programs, however, are being released in both
desktop and handheld versions so you can enter information into one
device and sync it with the other.
 Time was, many more software applications were written for the Palm
OS than for the Windows Mobile platform — but that difference has
dwindled until it’s no longer a relevant issue. Both platforms are compat-
ible with a wide variety of games and software applications. Many, if not
all, of these are exclusive to one OS or another. So if there’s a game or
application you just can’t live without, make sure it’s supported by the
OS you’re favoring.
Before choosing between the Palm and Windows Mobile OS, I strongly sug-
gest you test-drive several models loaded with each platform. That’s really
the only way to know for sure which one you’re more comfortable with.
Picking a PDA
After choosing an operating platform for your PDA (see the previous section),
you have to choose a handheld device to run it. Pay special attention to
 Synchronization: Be sure that any device you consider comes with a syn-
chronization cable or cradle, along with sync software. A PDA is a self-
contained unit, but you do need access to a desktop (or laptop) PC to
38
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

perform synchronization. Most applications, for example, must first be
downloaded to a PC and then synchronized (synced) to your handheld.
 The display screen: Because the screen is the largest single feature on
any handheld device, it makes sense to consider it carefully:
• Size: Be certain that the size of the screen isn’t going to cause you
to strain your eyes while reading e-mail, browsing the Web, playing
games, and so on.
• View: Many older PDAs and Pocket PCs operated only in what’s
known as a portrait view (long side vertical), but sometimes brows-
ing the Web, playing games, viewing photos, or watching video can
be more enjoyable with a landscape view (long side horizontal).
Shop for a device that can offer both views.
• Color of the display: Most handheld devices made these days
have a color display, but some lower-cost units still employ a
monochrome screen (fine for PIM and e-mail but that’s about it).
• Resolution: The higher the screen resolution, the better the view-
ing experience. PDAs can be found with resolutions ranging from
160 × 160 pixels up to 640 × 480 pixels. If you see a PDA advertised
with a VGA (Video Graphics Array) screen, it boasts the 640 × 480
resolution; if you find a QVGA (Quarter VGA) screen, its resolution
is 320 × 240. Higher resolution often translates into higher price, so
go look at screens of varying resolution to determine your rock-
bottom minimum.
Make certain, no matter the size, view, or resolution that the PDA
you choose has an active-matrix screen, making it viewable at an
angle. Most these days are so equipped but a few still persist with
the passive-matrix technology, which makes viewing the screen dif-
ficult from any angle other than head-on.
 Memory and data storage: Because the Windows Mobile operating sys-
tems are bulkier than the Palm OS, a Pocket PC will take up more
memory than a Palm-based PDA. Every application you add to your
device though, no matter the OS, will soak up available RAM.
Newer PDA devices use a combination of Flash ROM (or even a hard
drive) and RAM. The operating system comes loaded in ROM, and it
shares a bit of RAM, leaving a portion accessible to the user. This user-
accessible memory is the important number to look at when shopping
for a PDA (or, for that matter, any computer — handheld, laptop, or
desktop). Get the most built-in user-accessible memory you can afford.
Look for a device equipped with a non-volatile or persistent memory that
doesn’t let your data disappear if the power fails. That way, if your PDA
runs completely out of power, your data remains perfectly safe.
39
Chapter 3: Gearing Up

 Expandability: You might find three expansion slots or ports on a hand-
held device: Compact Flash (CF), Secure Digital (SD), and USB. Some
have one, some have none, and some have all three. Make sure any
device you fancy is equipped with, at the very least, one CF or SD slot,
as shown in Figure 3-2.
• Compact Flash (CF) type II: The types of additions you can make
to a PDA via a CF type II slot range from adding wireless connectiv-
ity to increasing available memory. Flash memory is a type of solid-
state technology so, unlike RAM, it doesn’t need a constant power
source.
• Secure Digital (SD): This method of expansion, which is also solid-
state, is a secure alternative (meaning it supports Digital Rights
Management) to the multimedia card. If the SD slot is input/output-
capable (SDIO), it can also be fitted with an SDIO wireless adapter.
(I tell you more about this in “Adapting Your Laptop or PDA for
Wireless,” later in the chapter.)
• USB: A USB port enables you to connect a wide variety of periph-
eral devices to your PDA — including, but not limited to, GPS
receivers, digital cameras, and miniature hard drives.
Not every PDA or Pocket PC can be adapted for wireless connectivity; a few
PDAs equipped with an SDIO slot do not support Wi-Fi. Before you buy a
handheld device that doesn’t have integrated Wi-Fi, be absolutely certain that
its expansion slot (whether CF or SDIO) and OS will allow it to be adapted.

Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

To save space in RAM, you can load certain program applications or files
onto SD or CF memory cards. If you save important or confidential files and
applications to removable memory cards, and keep them separate from your
PDA, you still have that data if your PDA is lost, damaged, or stolen.
Considering your wireless options
A PDA or Pocket PC with an open CF type II or SDIO slot (see the previous sec-
tion) can, in all likelihood, be easily adapted for wireless capability. However,
several manufacturers are offering an increasing number of units with inte-
grated wireless capabilities. This, as Martha Stewart would say, is a good thing.
Having built-in wireless connectivity can considerably simplify your Web surf-
ing experience and, even though it might add a bit to the bottom line at the
outset, I believe the extra convenience is well worth the extra cost. Besides, if
you decide to go with a unit that lacks integrated wireless, you’re still faced
with purchasing a wireless adapter, and they don’t just give ’em away.
Another good reason to choose a Pocket PC or PDA with integrated wireless
capability is that your expansion slots will remain free for other purposes.
If you choose, however (like so many others before you), to ignore my sage
advice and purchase a PDA or Pocket PC lacking built-in wireless connectiv-
ity, never fear. I explain how to make that device Wi-Fi-capable in “Adapting
Your Laptop or PDA for Wireless,” later in this chapter.
Customizing with a browser, 
mouse, and keyboard
You can choose from a wide variety of hardware and software options to
make your PDA a trusted and worthy traveling companion — so you might as
well start with a Web browser, a mouse, and a keyboard.
Web browsers installed on handheld devices are somewhat different from
those on PCs. Because the screen is so small, it’s difficult (if not impossible)
to squeeze the contents of a Web page into the tiny space in a way that ren-
ders it readable. Several solutions have been tried, with varying success.
Your browsing options depend on the operating system on your device:
 A Pocket PC with the Windows Mobile OS: On a new Pocket PC, at
least, your default browser is Pocket Internet Explorer (PIE). If you’ve
got a Pocket PC with WM 2003SE installed, you can choose from several
good alternate browsers, including NetFront 3.2, ThunderHawk, and
Skweezer. (I’m sure that other alternative versions, such as NetFront 3.3,
will soon be available for WM 5.0 as well.)
41
Chapter 3: Gearing Up

 PDA with the Palm OS: Palm takes a different approach and installs
browsers that are device-specific. For example, the Palm TX utilizes the
Blazer 4.3 Web browser and the Palm LifeDrive comes with Blazer 4.1.
I haven’t really found an alternate browser for Palm-powered devices that I
think is any better than their standard installed browser. I can’t say the same
for PIE, although the version included with Windows Mobile 5.0 is a bit better
than the version supplied with older WM iterations.
In addition to choosing a browser, you may want to add a keyboard or
mouse, too. Yes, I know — the reason you’re probably attracted to a PDA in
the first place is because it’s ultra-portable and if you wanted a keyboard you
could just get a laptop. Well, what can I say? You might be right, but the nice
thing about a PDA keyboard is that you don’t have to carry it everywhere you
go — and when they’re not in use, many portable keyboards can fold up.
Personally, I can’t use the tiny keyboards found on some devices, and I don’t
really like the idea of tapping on the screen with a stylus to enter information
into a PDA. But I wouldn’t consider being without a portable keyboard — and
if I’m going to have one, I might as well have a mouse, right? You think I’m
getting carried away? I think not. When you need it, you’ve got it; when you
don’t, just fold it and stow it. As a matter of fact, Stowaway is the brand name
of the mouse and keyboard I recommend you look at first; they’re manufac-
tured by Think Outside.
Getting more PDA info
For more information about handheld devices, check out either Palm For
Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley Publishing) or Pocket PCs For Dummies, 2nd

Adapting Your Laptop 
or PDA for Wireless
If your laptop or palmtop isn’t equipped with an integrated wireless connec-
tivity solution — or you’re trying to increase the capability of a laptop that 
is — you’re in the market for a wireless adapter.
A wireless adapter is, basically, a radio transceiver that (after the appropriate
software is loaded) enables a PC or PDA to send and receive radio signals
that carry data. The adapter is powered through the particular interface slot
or port that it’s designed to use. It’s like a CB radio for your laptop or PDA —
except it has to follow very specific standards and protocols (see Chapter 2)
and, of course, there’s no trash talk.
When you’re searching for a wireless adapter, you find several possible 
solutions:
 PCMCIA card adapter: The Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association has developed standards for the PCMCIA card,
known as the PC card. These cards (Figure 3-3 shows an example) are
available for various purposes and come in three different sizes. The
Type II card (5.0mm thick) is the size most often used to provide
input/output capability for laptops. PC cards can adapt a laptop for
(among other things), fax, dial-up, Ethernet, and Wi-Fi.
Another adapter card standard, known as an ExpressCard/34 (to reflect
its 34mm width) has been developed by PCMCIA. So far no wireless
adapter cards conforming to this standard are available, but the port is
beginning to show up on laptops like the Apple Macintosh MacBook Pro
and some Dell models. I expect to see wireless card adapters showing up
on shelves soon. If you want more info you can visit www.expresscard.
org/web/site.
 USB adapter: The Universal Serial Bus has quickly become the most
used and useful port on a laptop. It’s also beginning to show up on quite
a few PDA devices. Although I don’t yet know of any USB 802.11b/g
adapters for handheld devices, several are available for laptops (most 
of which look like a broken lighter). If you happen to have an empty 
USB port, you can always plug in a USB-powered cup warmer to keep 
the coffee in your favorite Star Trek mug piping hot (I told you it was a
useful port).
43
Chapter 3: Gearing Up

 Secure Digital I/O Adapter: You use this adapter (shown in Figure 3-4)
with a PDA or Pocket PC, and it fits into an SDIO slot. If you want to give
a Palm PDA wireless capability, first be certain that it’s equipped with an
SDIO expansion slot. Not all are, so check the specs. SDIO slots are also
beginning to supplant Compact Flash slots on Pocket PCs.
 Compact Flash Adapter: Type I and Type II CF slots are beginning to dis-
appear from Pocket PC handheld devices these days, but enough of
them are still around that you might be able to adapt your handheld
with a CF wireless adapter (like the one shown in Figure 3-5).

Looking at enhanced-performance 
laptop adapters
Because over-the-road environments, as well as the OTR traveler’s needs,
differ from those of the average business traveler, it stands to reason that the
criteria for choosing an adapter will also be a bit different. For example, most
folks owning a laptop with integrated wireless wouldn’t recognize a potential
need for also owning a Wi-Fi adapter. But here are a few things to consider
while you’re out shopping for an adapter:
 Look for an adapter with enhanced capability: Several adapters on the
market excel at pulling in weak signals and connecting with distant
access points. (I focus on these devices later in this section.)
 If your laptop has an integrated wireless solution, give it a good test
drive: Before you shop for a high-powered adapter to use in place of
your built-in wireless solution, take your laptop with you on a road trip.
You might find that your usual OTR environment doesn’t pose a problem
when you access the Internet. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!
 Don’t be overly concerned with shopping for the fastest standard:
Okay, some people in the market for a wireless laptop adapter are
obsessed with the adapter’s speed and standard, but this is only rele-
vant if you also plan to use the adapter extensively within a home net-
work. The available speed under the 802.11b standard is plenty quick for
connecting to the Internet. (For the details on standards, see Chapter 2.)
If you do decide to purchase a laptop adapter, you may as well get one that
can improve your ability to make a connection. An adapter can accomplish
this job in two ways:
Figure 3-5:
An example
of a
Compact
Flash

45
Chapter 3: Gearing Up

 Increased power: The average output of a standard laptop wireless
adapter is between 31.6mW and 63.2mW — sufficient for surfing the Net
while sipping latte — but when you’re berthed in the back row and there’s
an ocean of trucks or RVs between you and the access point, more power
may be the answer. Fortunately, several adapter models, all seemingly
built around the same basic design, boast an output of 200mW.
When shopping for an adapter, you’re bound to see power rated in two
ways: milliwatts (mW) and in decibels above or below 1mW (dBm). You’ll
also see antenna gain referenced, usually, as decibels relative to a theo-
retical isotropic antenna (dBi). Sounds a bit like Star Trek, doesn’t it? But
here’s the practical gist: When you’re comparing two devices, remember
that an increase of 3 dBm (or 3 dBi) indicates a doubling of the power
level (also called antenna gain); a decrease of 3 dBm (or 3 dBi) means a
halving of the power level. For example 31.6mW is expressed as 15 dBm,
63.2mW is expressed as 18 dBm, and 200mW is expressed as (approxi-
mately) 23 dBm, which is pretty powerful either way.
You may find, while wandering the World Wide Web, wireless adapters
that claim a power output of 300mW or higher. These adapters aren’t
meant for use in a laptop. Higher power means higher heat; you could fry
your laptop’s delicate innards like a shoe-leather steak.
 Increased antenna gain: A high-gain antenna uses a more focused
energy to pull in signals that a standard antenna may not even be able to
detect. I don’t fully understand antenna gain — and only a handful of
people (mainly employed by NASA) can claim to know someone who
does — but I’m content if it works as advertised.
Several laptop adapters currently available incorporate one, or both, of the
methods that improve adapter performance. Some are PC-card adapters;
others are USB adapters. Whichever you use is purely your own preference. I
prefer to travel with a PC-card adapter; you may, for any number of reasons,
want a USB-powered device. Table 3-2 lists some of these adapters in no par-
ticular order. (Okay, bias being what it is, my favorite is listed first!)

Perusing PDA adapters
If you’ve decided to ignore my sage advice (see “Picking a PDA,” earlier in this
chapter) and have purchased a handheld that lacks integrated wireless connec-
tivity, then your choice for a compatible adapter will be driven by the type of
expansion slots built into your device. Unfortunately, there just aren’t a lot of
Wi-Fi adapters available on the market today — and none of them offers any
sort of enhanced capability. Here are a couple of representative PDA/Pocket PC
adapters that offer standard output:
 Socket Go Wi-Fi! E300: A low power consumption SDIO card that’s com-
patible with Windows Mobile 2003, 2003SE or 5.0 operating systems.
Socket also makes a CF card known as the Go Wi-Fi! P500. 
 Palm P10952U: Manufactured by Palm and built to the 802.11b standard,
this SDIO card (as one might guess) can be used in Palm devices that
support wireless connectivity.
 Linksys WCF54G: Compatible with most Pocket PC devices that are
equipped with a Compact Flash expansion slot, this Compact Flash wire-
less card complies with the 802.11g standard.
Extending Your Range
I don’t know how many times I’ve read generic Wi-Fi tips suggesting that if
you’re having trouble getting a decent signal at the hotspot of your choice,
you move closer to the source of the signal. Right.
I don’t know about you, but when I’m searching for a truck-stop parking
space, I usually take what I can get and hope I’ll fit. I don’t remember the last
time I was able to pick and choose or move around at random. The real solu-
tion (other than more parking spaces) is extending the range of your laptop.
PDAs need not apply. I don’t know of a way to increase the range of a PDA
wireless-connection device.
Enhanced-capability laptop adapters go a long way toward alleviating the
problem of being too far from an access point. You can use them to enhance
your ability to access a hotspot with your laptop. Before rushing right out to
purchase all the pieces and parts mentioned in this chapter, give one of the
enhanced-capability laptop adapters a good test. If you’re still having prob-
lems obtaining or maintaining a connection, then you can come back and try
one of the following ways to extend your wireless radio-transceiver range:
 Increasing antenna gain: If you’ve purchased one of the laptop adapters
that has a removable antenna, then you can attach an external high-gain
antenna. Most standard laptop adapters are equipped with an antenna
rated at somewhere around 2 dBi — but even those equipped with 
48
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

high-gain antennas can do better with an external high-gain antenna.
There are two types of high-gain antennas:
• Omnidirectional: Most antennas are omnidirectional — covering a
360-degree area — and that includes the most common high-gain
antennas that are suitable for travel. Note, however, that an omni-
directional signal is not spherical.
• Directional: The difference between omnidirectional and direc-
tional antennas is like the difference between (respectively) a
lantern and a flashlight. A lantern casts light in a full circle; a flash-
light focuses its light as a narrow beam.
The phrase antenna gain refers to the focus of the signal or field. A high-
gain antenna has a tightly focused field; a low-gain antenna has a widely
focused field. A high-gain antenna, therefore, isn’t necessarily more pow-
erful than a standard-gain antenna. In fact, there’s really no energy
increase connected with a high-gain antenna — it’s just that the existing
energy is more focused.
 Amplifying output: If you’ve found that a high-output 200mW laptop
adapter doesn’t quite cut the mustard (or you’re just plain power-
hungry), there are several wireless amplifiers on the market that range
in output from 200mW to 1000mW (1 Watt).
Do not — I repeat, do not — attempt to amplify the output of a high-output
adapter. You’ll only fry the amplifier. Amplifiers are designed to handle the
input power of a standard wireless adapter — that is, with a range of
32mW to 63mW.
 Combining increased output and gain: By far the most powerful config-
uration for extending your Wi-Fi range is the combination of a high-
output amplifier and a high-gain antenna. You’ll be happy to know that
several vendors sell complete kits that include the adapter, the amplifier,
and a high-gain antenna.
Comparing directional and 
omni-directional antennas
A directional antenna, as its name suggests, picks up and transmits a signal
from — and in — a particular direction. Here are some attributes typical to a
directional antenna:
 Focused beam width: With its energy directed into a relatively narrow
vertical and horizontal beam width, a directional antenna can be
extremely efficient — it’s a high-gain antenna almost by definition. The
higher its rated gain, the more narrowly focused the beam width.
 Reduced interference: Because interference may be centered in an area
not covered by the narrow beam width, and because the energy is more
49
Chapter 3: Gearing Up

focused (or dense), a directional antenna may be less affected by any
local interference.
 Need to be aimed: As with a flashlight beam, a directional antenna has
to be aimed at the target. This need to be aimed — and the fact that the
beam width narrows as the gain increases — makes the accuracy of the
aim more critical as gain increases. Thus you may want to avoid using a
directional antenna with a rated gain in excess of 10 to 12 dBi.
After reading the preceding information, you might be all set to run out the door
in search of a directional antenna. Well, wait just a second there partner —
there’s more to this story. Everything I’ve said about a directional antenna is
true, but (you just knew a “but” was coming, didn’t you?) when you’re travel-
ing, you might not be able to get a clear shot at the signal source. That’s espe-
cially true if the source is coming from behind and you’ve got a big ol’ trailer
between you and it. High trailers, especially metallic trailers, can serve as
outstandingly effective barriers to wireless signals.
You might be well advised to seriously consider choosing a less discriminat-
ing omnidirectional antenna that encompasses a much wider area. So here
are some attributes typical to omnidirectional antennas:
 360-degree horizontal beam width: Because energy is being expended
throughout a 360-degree circumference around the antenna, the beam is
somewhat less efficient than that of a directional antenna. As the gain of
an omnidirectional antenna increases, the vertical beam width becomes
narrower and more focused — but (of course) its 360-degree horizontal
beam width is maintained.
 Susceptible to interference: At least it’s more susceptible than a direc-
tional antenna might be in the same environment. While the hotspot
signal may be coming from one direction, interference in another area
may be picked up as well. A high-gain omnidirectional antenna is, how-
ever, less susceptible to interference than its low-gain cousin.
 No aiming: The real beauty of an omnidirectional antenna is that it 
doesn’t need to be precisely aimed — so it might detect signals that
would otherwise be blocked from a directional antenna’s line of sight.
Choosing an indoor versus 
an outdoor antenna
When you’re choosing an external high-gain antenna for use with your high-
power adapter, you’ll have to decide whether you’ll want to use a directional
50
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

or omnidirectional antenna — and whether you want an antenna designed for
indoor or outdoor use. Consider the following:
 Indoor antennas: Indoor antennas are the most commonly available that
are suitable for use in a truck or RV. One nice thing about an indoor
antenna is that you don’t need to run a whole bunch of cable through a
window, vent, or other such opening in your vehicle. There are also a few
other advantages and disadvantages associated with indoor antennas:
• The single biggest advantage of an indoor antenna (relating strictly
to directional antennas) is that you can aim it without much trou-
ble. You can sit right next to your laptop and watch the signal
strength indicator as you move the antenna. Outdoor mounted
antennas, by contrast, can be extremely difficult, even dangerous
(read: nearly impossible) for a single person to aim.
• All other things being equal, a directional antenna usually outper-
forms an omnidirectional antenna. If I were choosing an indoor
antenna, my leading candidates would be directional (especially
since I already own an SMC2532W-B adapter card that comes stan-
dard with a 5.5 dBi omnidirectional antenna).
• You can, in most cases, permanently (or semipermanently) mount
an indoor antenna in your vehicle, but that isn’t necessary. You can
store the antenna in an out-of-the-way nook or cranny when it’s not
in use, and then place it in a suitable position when it’s needed.
• If you’re having difficulties getting connected, one problem might
be too many obstructions. Unfortunately, you may not be able to
raise an indoor antenna — which is restricted by your roof, walls
and doors — above the obstructions.
 Outdoor antennas: Large numbers of outdoor high-gain antennas are
available, but only a fraction of them are designed for mobile use. With a
little ingenuity, you can get some of the antennas designed mainly for
static use to work quite nicely — especially for RVs. Here are some
major pros and cons regarding outdoor antennas:
• Possibly the greatest advantage to using an outdoor is that you can
mount it high enough to clear most, if not all, obstructions.
Another advantage to this type of mounting is that the roof of the
vehicle might well act as a ground plane (in effect, a kind of electri-
cal shield against interference), further optimizing the perfor-
mance of the antenna.
• An outdoor antenna requires a more permanent mount, which
sometimes requires the drilling of tiny little holes. Antenna cable
will also need to be run from the outside to the inside and secured.
51
Chapter 3: Gearing Up

Once all that’s done (at least for an omnidirectional antenna), it’s
pretty darn convenient to use.
If I were going to purchase an outdoor antenna, it would be omnidi-
rectional. And, yes, an outdoor antenna can be a pain to mount in a
tidy fashion, but once that job’s done, it’ll usually outperform
indoor antennas with a similar rated gain. Just put it up as high as
you can get it and it does its job.
• Several companies manufacture and sell mobile antennas with the
familiar magnetic mount. That’s not much help if you’ve got an alu-
minum or fiberglass cab, or if your RV has FRP body panels, but if
you’re still living in the Iron Age, they can be handy.
• There are, really, no outdoor directional antennas designed to be
permanently mounted on a moving vehicle. To employ an outdoor
directional antenna, a mount must be fashioned that allows
removal of the antenna before vehicle travels.
Checking out example antennas
Most of the major wireless manufacturers carry a line of external high-gain
antennas. If you’re in the market for an indoor antenna, you might begin 
your search at Hawking Technology (www.hawkingtech.com), Buffalo
Technology (www.buffalotech.com/products/wireless.php), or SMC
(www.smc.com). Here are a few good examples of available antennas:
 Hawking HAI6SDP: This is an outstanding 6 dBi directional antenna
designed for indoor use. The HAI6SDP uses a Reverse Polarity-SMA con-
nector so if you want to connect it to the SMC2532W-B PC card you’ll
need to obtain an RP-MMCX to RP-SMA pigtail as an adapter. (More
about cables and connectors in the next section.)
 Hawking HAI7SIP: Its slightly higher 7 dBi-rated gain would put it at 
the top of my list if I were going to purchase an indoor omnidirectional
antenna. It comes with an RP-SMA connector so an RP-MMCX to RP-SMA
pigtail will be needed to adapt it for use with the SMC2532W-B card.
(Again, I cover the connectors next.)
 Buffalo WLE-DA2: Buffalo Technology manufactures some very high-
quality and well-reviewed wireless products; the WLE-DA2 9 dBi direc-
tional (indoor) antenna is a good example. The vertical and horizontal
beam width is 75 degrees, so it’s not terribly difficult to aim. The only
problem you might run into is in adapting the connectors for use with an
SMC2532W-B PC card.
 SMCHMANT-6: Manufactured by SMC this 6 dBi directional (indoor)
antenna is similar to the Hawking HAI6SDP. Its beam width is 80 degrees
on both the horizontal and vertical planes, so it’s a bit more forgiving
52
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

than a much-higher-dBi directional antenna might be. Now, you might
think that (since it’s manufactured by SMC) that the connector would be
compatible with the SMC2532W-B — but no. Like the Hawking Technology
antennas, this one needs an RP-MMCX to RP-SMA pigtail.
 Trucker & RV +7 dBi: WarDrivingWorld.com offers this 7 dBi omnidirec-
tional (outdoor-mount) antenna that includes an integrated ground
plane. It comes with seven feet of cable and you can get additional cable
from them. It mounts directly into pre-drilled CB antenna holes, or you
can buy an optional mirror mount. You can choose the RP-MMCX con-
nector for use with the SMC2532W-B adapter card.
 HyperGain HG2409UM-KIT: Offered by HyperLink Technologies, this 8.5
dBi Omni-directional antenna is designed for use in a marine environ-
ment and is suitable for use on a truck or RV. The package includes a
four-way marine mount, allowing the antenna to be folded flat for travel.
The connector is an RP-SMA, so (surprise, surprise) you need an RP-
MMCX to RP-SMA pigtail for use with an SMC2532W-B adapter card. (See
the next section for more.)
Getting cables and connectors
When you’re adding an external antenna to a device like your wireless adapter,
you may need to adapt the connection. The SMC2532W-B uses an MMCX con-
nection (for example), and the antenna you desire might be equipped with a
SMA connector. This is a minor irritation; in almost all cases, it can be easily
remedied. You can traipse down to your local electronics geek shop for a solu-
tion or check out one of these online vendors:
 WarDrivingWorld.com: These are the folks from whom I obtained my
RP-MMCX to RP-SMA pigtail for use with my SMC2532W-B card. When
you go to their site in search of a pigtail you need only find the subhead-
ing “Cables & Pigtails” under the main heading “Store home” and follow
that link. This online store also carries other Wi-Fi-related gear that’s tai-
lored to a mobile environment.
 WirelessNetworkProducts.com: Under the heading “More Info,” look for
the subheading “Pigtail Picker” and follow that link. You will be taken to
a page that lets you specify the exact connectors you need on either end
of your custom pigtail. They also offer many other products you might
be interested in.
 RadioLabs.com: Follow the link titled “Wireless” on top of the page, and
then follow the link titled “Cables.” You find other links for “WiFi Cables,”
“Wi-Fi Connectors,” and “Wireless Pigtail cables.” Somewhere within this
site lies the solution to your problems. RadioLabs.com is a site to book-
mark and return to often.
53
Chapter 3: Gearing Up

Okay, all you know for sure is that the two ends don’t connect. Your best
bet is to take the two pieces down to a local electronics shop that sells
connectors. They can identify the tiny offenders and probably sell you a
pigtail or bullet adapter to mate them. Failing that, call RadioLabs.com,
at the toll-free number listed on the top of their Web pages, and tell them
which pieces you’re tying to connect. They’ll be able to help and you
can buy what you need from them.
Combining power and sensitivity in a kit
If your deepest desire is to amplify your power output to the maximum, then
you, my friend, are in the market for a Wi-Fi kit. Most of these kits include a
wireless adapter card, a high-gain omnidirectional (outdoor) antenna, and (of
course) an amplifier.
You can, if you so choose, buy an amplifier as a standalone device — but I
highly recommend that you resist that temptation. There are several obscure
(and not-so-obscure) FCC regulations that apply; by purchasing a kit, you
avoid breaking those regulations.
Both kits that I recommend here incorporate a 500mW amplifier. Yes, you
could purchase a 1000mW amplifier, but — depending on the rated gain of
your antenna — you could easily exceed the maximum power output allowed
by the FCC (36dB). You might also become a source of interference, causing
problems for neighboring trucks and RVs.
Several manufacturers offer 802.11b/g wireless amplifiers; quite a few of them
package these items in complete kits. Here are two of those kits that I think
offer excellent performance and good value:
 RadioLabs Trucker Wireless Internet Antenna Kit: This is a kit put
together by the good folks at RadioLabs.com. It’s got everything you
might need, including a 12V cigarette-lighter jack for powering the ampli-
fier. The total power output of the 500mW (27 dBm) amplifier and 7 dBi
antenna is approximately 34dB, falling safely inside the maximum of
36dB allowed by the FCC.
 HyperLink Marine MAX Range Wi-Fi Kit: This kit, offered by HyperLink
Technology is (okay) a bit more complicated to install. The kit includes
an 802.11g (b/g) 500mW amplifier and 12V-power supply, 8.5 dBi marine
antenna and mount, 802.11b PC card, and connecting cables. The total
power output is a barely-legal 35.5dB.

hen you’ve gone out and got yourself a bunch of stuff, it’s time to get
it all set up and running. Most Wi-Fi gear is relatively simple to set up
and install. Believe me, if I can do it, anyone can do it — and you (you lucky
dog) can benefit from my vast experience (read: ocean of errors).
In this chapter, I walk you through the process of installing and operating a
wireless adapter in your laptop or PDA. I also give you some tips, pointers,
and instructions for setting up and mounting an external antenna.
Getting Ready to Install 
a Wireless Adapter
I usually want to get whatever new gadget I’ve purchased installed as fast as I
can. I rip off the cellophane, tear open the box, and start grabbing goodies.
But hold on a minute. Even though getting Wi-Fi gear set up and operating
smoothly is really pretty simple, it still takes a little forethought and prepara-
tion. There aren’t a lot of things that cause serious problems as you get your
laptop or PDA Wi-Fi-ready and running efficiently, but the few that crop up
can be frustrating, to say the least. Here, my goal is to help you avoid frustra-
tion by employing the Boy Scout motto: “Be Prepared.”

If you’ve got a laptop with an integrated Wi-Fi card, follow these three steps
before you install an additional adapter:
1. Read the instructions.
2. Disable the Wireless Zero Configuration utility.
3. Disable your wireless radio.
If your laptop has no integrated wireless capability, then you can (obviously)
skip the final step — and if you’ve got a PDA, then you can skip the last two —
but the first item applies to one and all. In the following sections, I explain
each step in detail.
Read the instructions
Steven Wright, one of my favorite comedians, once said: “Experience is some-
thing you don’t get until just after you need it.” While that’s true to a certain
extent, at least you can benefit from the experience of others. I’ve learned
(after enough repetitive “lessons”) that manufacturers print these instructions
for a reason. These days (finally) I read the instructions — completely —
before I begin the assembly or installation of anything. Pretty radical, isn’t it?
But reading the instructions can head off some frustrating or annoying sur-
prises, because you start off knowing
 Whether or not your operating system is compatible.
 Whether you need to install the drivers before inserting the card, or vice
versa.
 What needs to be turned off and what needs to be running.
 That you’re going to need a cup of coffee before you start.
Addressing the Wireless Zero
Configuration utility
Windows XP provides a Wireless Zero Configuration (WZC) utility to manage
the connection of PDAs or laptops to wireless networks. That is, the utility
displays the wireless networks in range, along with their status, and performs
the computer gymnastics necessary to make a connection to your network of
choice. It also remembers the network and any configurations, like a security
password or whether or not you allow an automatic connection.
Unfortunately, WZC doesn’t always work well with wireless adapters. For exam-
ple, it seems to work well enough with the Buffalo Technology WLI-CB-G54A
adapter — but if your adapter is a SMC2532W-B, you may note that the user
56
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

guide strongly recommends turning off the WZC and using the adapter’s con-
figuration utility instead. In general, no matter the adapter, I prefer to use a
connection utility other than the WZC.
In all cases, if you’re using a connection utility or manager other than the
Windows Zero Configuration utility — such as the one provided by the
adapter’s manufacturer — the WZC must be disabled, preferably before you
install any drivers or other software associated with your adapter card. You
want to eliminate any chance of conflict between configuration utilities.
The good news: Disabling the WZC is easy. You can do it in several different
ways, all equally effective. My preferred method is as follows:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Switch to Classic View (assuming
Category View is the current default view).
The Classic View Control Panel opens.
2. Double-click the Administrative Tools icon.
The Administrative Tools window opens.
3. Double-click the Services icon.
The double-pane Services window opens, as shown in Figure 4-1.
4. In the right pane of the Services window, scroll down to Wireless Zero
Configuration and click it.
The item is highlighted; in the upper-left corner, you see the heading
Wireless Zero Configuration, which lists two choices: Stop the Service
and Restart the Service.
Figure 4-1:
Stop the
service in
the Services
dialog box.
57
Chapter 4: Putting Your Gear Together

5. Click Stop the Service.
The previous two choices disappear. They are replaced by a single
choice (Start the Service), which means your choice is acknowledged.
6. Move the cursor over to the highlighted Wireless Zero Configuration
item and right-click it. From the context menu that appears, choose
Properties.
The Wireless Zero Configuration Properties dialog box opens, as shown
in Figure 4-2.
7. Click the General tab (if it isn’t already showing).
In the center of the dialog box, you see Startup Type: Automatic.
8. From the Startup Type drop-down list, choose Disabled, click the
Apply button, and then click OK to close the dialog box.
9. Close the Services window, close the Administrative Tools window,
and restart your computer.
There, you’ve done it. The Windows Zero Configuration utility is disabled. If
your laptop has integrated Wi-Fi, be sure to turn off the built-in wireless radio.
(See “Eliminating conflict between integrated wireless and wireless adapters”
later in this chapter.) Otherwise you’re ready to install your adapter.
If you have an integrated wireless card and you’re only using a separate wire-
less adapter for situations in which you need greater power, then you may
Figure 4-2:
Disabling

Properties
dialog box.
58
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

want to use the WZC to make connections with the integrated card. If this is
the case, you need to re-enable the WZC (only when you’re using the integrated
card). To do so, first return to the Wireless Zero Configuration Properties dialog
box as you did in the preceding steps and choose Automatic from the Startup
Type drop-down list. Click Apply before you click OK to close the dialog box.
Then, in the Services dialog box, make sure Wireless Zero Configuration is
selected, and click Start the Service at upper left.
Eliminating conflict between integrated
wireless and wireless adapters
If you’ve got built-in Wi-Fi and you install a high-power adapter to use in a
low-signal-strength area, your computer may get confused about which Wi-Fi
radio to use. To avoid this potential problem, turn off the integrated card.
To turn off the radio, most laptops have simple methods such as a button,
function key, or utility. (Check your user’s manual to find out which, if any,
you have.) My laptop has two of those options: I can use the utility by right-
clicking my wireless-radio icon in the tray and choosing to turn the WLAN off.
Or I can press the button in the center of my laptop keyboard. Either way, the
indicator light goes out, letting me know the built-in radio is off.
If you don’t have any of these options available to you, fear not; a simple
solution is available. If your manual shows no button, key, or utility for dis-
abling a built-in wireless radio, just follow these instructions:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Switch to Classic View.
The Classic View Control Panel opens.
2. Double-click the Network Connections icon.
The Network Connections window opens and you see an icon indicating
the type and status of each network connection.
3. Right-click the Wireless Network Connection icon.
A menu box opens.
4. Click Disable.
5. Click OK to close the Network Connections window.
Your built-in wireless solution is now disabled. To re-enable the radio, you
can follow the same steps that disabled it, clicking Enable in Step 4.

Installing a Wireless Adapter (Laptop)
With all the complicated and confusing things connected with computers, it’s
nice to know that installing an adapter is so easy. In fact, the entire process
will likely take you less than 20 minutes.
Before you begin, here are just a few bits of information you need to know:
 Whereas a USB plug will only go into the USB port one way, it is possible
to put a PC card into the PCMCIA slot incorrectly. Generally speaking,
the PC card will go into the slot with the flashy product logo facing up
and the dull, boring-looking information label facing down. If the card
has little status-indicator lights, those have to face up.
Inserting the card the right way is important. If the card’s upside down,
and if you pushed really hard, you could mangle the way those 68 little
holes in the end of the card fit into the 68 little pins inside the slot, dam-
aging both the card and the laptop.
 To keep static electricity from damaging the adapter, avoid opening any
protective packaging until just before you insert a PC card or USB plug
into your laptop.
 In some cases (as with the SMC2532W-B card and most USB adapters),
you need to install the drivers (tiny programs that handle communica-
tion between the hardware device and the program or operating system
using it) before inserting the card or plug into the appropriate orifice. In
other cases (as with the Buffalo WLI-CB-G54A), you can insert the card
first. Make sure you know the order of events before you proceed with
installing a card or USB adapter; the instructions that came with your
card should steer you straight.
With so many different adapters on the market it’s just not practical to give
you the exact installation instructions for each and every one. Fortunately, no
matter which adapter you’ve selected, the methods of installation are very simi-
lar. That’s true whether it’s a PC card adapter or a USB adapter. So, what follows
are the exact instructions for installing the Buffalo Technology WLI-CB-G54A
adapter. Even if you’ve got a different adapter, the steps will be very similar.
Installing the drivers
Chances are quite good that the box containing your adapter card also con-
tains an installation guide (that is, instructions) and a CD that contains the
hardware drivers and configuration utility. You’ve already read the instructions;
60
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

the adapter card is still nestled inside its protective wrap, and the installation
CD is at hand. You’re ready to begin the installation. Following are the steps, in
excruciating detail, for installing the adapter, drivers, and configuration utility
for the Buffalo WLI-CB-G54A.
Before handling your adapter card, make sure you discharge any static elec-
tricity by touching an object made of electrically conductive metal.
1. Power up your laptop, and then unwrap your adapter card and insert
it into the PCMCIA slot.
The Found New Hardware wizard, shown in Figure 4-3, opens automati-
cally. (If, for some reason, it doesn’t, remove the card, restart your
laptop, and reinsert the card.) The Install software automatically radio
button is selected by default.
2. Insert the CD included with your adapter and close the drive bay to
move to the next step in the wizard. If the wizard doesn’t automati-
cally change screens, click Next.
The driver menu screen opens.
3. Select the most recent driver version as indicated by the highest ver-
sion number (see Figure 4-4).
A warning may appear, indicating that the driver isn’t digitally signed.
You can safely ignore it.
If all version numbers are the same, use the driver listed at the top; this
should be the default driver.

A warning window, indicating that the driver hasn’t passed Windows
Logo testing, may appear and attempt to scare you half to death. This
same warning screen may appear if you’re installing the SMC2532W-B
adapter card or any of several other cards from various manufacturers.
5. Live dangerously (no, not really) and click Continue Anyway.
The Flying Files screen opens, indicating the software is being installed.
As is the case with the installation of most software, Windows also sets a
system restore point (which saves your settings as they are before you
install something new). That way, if the installation goes awry, you can
usually return your system to the way it was. When the files have fin-
ished their flight, the final screen opens.
6. Click Finished.
The drivers are now installed. The next step is to run your adapter’s
connection utility, if it has one. Though I discuss WZC (the Windows XP
utility), earlier in this chapter, the utility that comes with an adapter
usually works better. The next section has all the details.
Running the adapter’s connection utility
If you’re going to use your adapter’s connection utility, you need to install it
after installing the drivers. The following steps use the Buffalo connection
utility as an example of how this works:
1. Click Start➪Run.

The AirNavigator configuration utility opens.
3. Select the Install Buffalo Client Manager radio button and click OK, as
shown in Figure 4-6.
The Client Manager Installer opens, prompting you to close other appli-
cations before continuing.
4. Click Next to open the EULA screen. Read the information (or at least
pretend to) and if you find nothing objectionable, click I Agree.
A screen indicating where the files are to be installed opens. You’re
given the option of choosing another location — but since you’re too
smart to make that mistake, you simply . . .

You’re done! You’re ready to get connected, and I cover this issue in

The PCMCIA slot allows hot swapping, meaning a PC card can be removed
and re-inserted without powering down the laptop. This isn’t always true for
devices — including adapters — connected via a USB port.
Installing a Wireless Adapter (PDA)
With the multitude of PDA and Pocket PC devices available, not to mention
the adapters, I can’t possibly address every one separately. Fortunately, as
with laptops, installation of adapters (though not completely universal) is
remarkably similar for Palm OS and Windows Mobile OS — as is the method
of installation, whether for SDIO wireless or Compact Flash adapters.
Okay, installing an adapter (or any other item requiring software or drivers)
isn’t quite as straightforward on a handheld as it is on a laptop — but it isn’t
overly complex. The only real difference is that any software must be loaded
onto a PC and (via cradle or cable) synced with the handheld device.
It’s worth repeating: Leave your adapter card in its wrapping, protected from
static electricity, until you’re ready to actually install it in your device.
Setting up the PDA or Pocket PC
The first step in loading the drivers and configuration utility on your hand-
held is to connect it, by sync cable or cradle, to your PC. Of course, before
you do that, the ActiveSync (Pocket PC) or HotSync (Palm OS) software

(whichever is appropriate) has to be installed on the PC. Then, with your
PDA connected to your PC, make sure they’re both powered up. What follows
is the step-by-step process for installing a Linksys WCF54G Compact Flash
wireless adapter card in a Pocket PC.
Don’t insert the adapter card into your handheld until after you complete the
installation of both the drivers and the configuration utility.
1. Open the CD/DVD optical drive bay on your PC and insert the CD
included with the adapter card.
2. Close the drive bay.
The CD starts automatically and the Installation wizard welcome screen
opens, showing its menu.
3. Click Install.
The End User’s License Agreement (EULA) opens. By continuing, you
accept the terms of the license. I haven’t found any reason to object to
any of its tenets, but if, after reading it, you find something you can’t live
with, you can click Cancel and exit the installation wizard.
4. Click Next.
The Add/Remove Programs window opens.
5. When asked if you want to install in the default application install
directory, click Yes.
The Add/Remove Programs window remains open; an installation-
progress status bar opens. Don’t click the Cancel button. When the
installation is complete, a notice opens, asking you to check your PDA
screen to see whether any additional steps are necessary.
6. Click OK.
The Congratulations screen opens.
7. Click Exit.
You’re now done using the PC and you can focus on your Pocket PC
where you see the Installation complete screen.
8. Click OK (on the Installation complete screen) and then disconnect
your handheld from the PC.
The Pocket PC’s Start screen appears.
9. Insert the adapter card into the Pocket PC.
10. If it’s not already selected, select Use server-assigned IP address and
click OK.
That’s pretty much it. The little wireless-network icon appears and
you’re ready to connect to a network via a hotspot. I tell you more about
connecting to hotspots in Chapter 6.

Chapter 4: Putting Your Gear Together

Updating drivers and firmware
Every so often the manufacturers of wireless equipment — including wireless
adapters — update or upgrade the software drivers and internal firmware
(programmed operating instructions stored within a hardware device). It’s a
good idea to check the manufacturer’s Web site on a regular basis to see if
they’ve made something available for your adapter.
Firmware doesn’t seem to get upgraded as often as the drivers but, especially
in the case of USB adapters, it does happen. So, how often should you check
the manufacturer’s Web site? If you check the site once every three months,
that’s plenty. (Okay, if you never check for updates or upgrades, the world
won’t come to a screeching halt — but you might miss out on getting a bit
better performance from your wireless equipment.)
In some cases, you may have to uninstall your currently loaded drivers and
connection utility before you install updated or upgraded drivers. (This prob-
ably won’t be the case if you’re upgrading firmware.)
Attaching an External Antenna
For the most part — with the exception of an outdoor directional antenna —
attaching an external antenna is pretty straightforward. There are, however, a
few things worth mentioning, especially if you’re planning to mount an exter-
nal antenna outside your vehicle. If you’re also including an amplifier, even
then you won’t need a working knowledge of rocket science — but planning
and common sense save wear and tear on nerves.
Depending on whether you’re setting up an outdoor omnidirectional antenna
or an indoor antenna (whether directional or omnidirectional), you have dif-
ferent circumstances that influence your planned setup and installation. For
example, if you have an outdoor directional antenna, consider what location
will enable you to rotate it 360 degrees; with an omnidirectional antenna, you
don’t need to worry about that, because of the way the antenna works (see
Chapter 3 for details).
No matter the type of antenna you intend to use — indoor or outdoor, direc-
tional or omnidirectional — here are a couple of universal rules:
 Obstacle avoidance: This rule of thumb applies especially to the folks
who pull a high trailer such as a van or reefer. If that’s you, then mount
your antenna as far forward of the trailer as possible. Whether you’re
operating a semi pulling a high trailer or an RV pulling a snowmobile
trailer, be sure to mount or place your antenna in an obstacle-free area.
66
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

Glass, fiberglass, and FRP (Fiberglass-Reinforced Plastic), while not com-
pletely transparent to a Wi-Fi radio signal, don’t create a serious obsta-
cle (like metal does). You can, for example, mount your antenna behind
a fiberglass wind deflector without worrying that it will deflect your 
Wi-Fi signal as well as wind.
 Mount your antenna as high as possible. With or without a high trailer,
if you can get your antenna up in the air, you have fewer obstacles to the
line-of-sight to the access point’s antenna. If you’re pulling a high trailer
and you can mount the antenna far forward — with the tip of the antenna
reaching up to within a foot or so of the trailer top — then the trailer
itself becomes much less of a potential obstacle.
Setting up an outdoor omnidirectional
antenna
If you’ve ever mounted a CB antenna, then you know that it doesn’t have to
be the most challenging thing you’ve ever done. To plan your installation,
you just find the best place to mount your antenna, determine where the
coax will terminate, and make a plan for running coaxial cable between those
two points. Rather than attempt to give you a step-by-step guide for installing
an antenna, I’ve offered some general guidelines here to help you make a
clean installation that operates efficiently.
Choosing your antenna location
With obstacle avoidance in mind, your first consideration is locating the
antenna as close as possible to the area where you most often use your com-
puter. If drilling holes in the exterior of your vehicle is acceptable in your sit-
uation, then you can probably mount your antenna relatively close to that
area. If not, then a rail or mirror mount may be the ticket; then, no matter
where you do your computing, the location of the rail or mirror you use as a
mount will determine the antenna location.
If you’re planning to drill holes in the exterior wall or roof, be certain that the
mount is securely fastened — and well sealed with gaskets and sealant. (If
neither surface is plastic or FRP, use a polysulfide sealant; otherwise use sili-
cone.) And take a minute and see if there are any nearby entry points, like
vents, that you might use for cable entry.
Finally, you don’t want to minimize the value of a neat and aesthetically pleas-
ing installation. For example, if you can mount the antenna so that a cabinet
or shelving hides any ingress of hardware, that little bit of extra effort will go
a long way in making the job look more professional. If you can use existing
wire and cable entry points for the coax, that’s even better.
67
Chapter 4: Putting Your Gear Together

Planning the coaxial cable path
Once you’ve determined where to mount your antenna, the next step is to lay
out your cabling plan. You want to know:
 How much cable is needed: You don’t want any excess cable because
even the very best cable loses some signal strength over its length. You
also don’t want to coil any cable, because that creates another electro-
magnetic field that might easily create interference.
 What kind of cable is needed: There are two types of low-loss cable
that are both effective and affordable:
• LMR-400: Used as primary antenna cable. The attenuation (loss of
signal strength over distance) is approximately 6.69dB per 100 feet,
so approximately .67dB is lost every 10 feet.
• LMR-100: Used as a pigtail connecting the computer to the main
antenna cable. (Pigtails are short cables used to connect, for exam-
ple, a device with connector A to a cable using connector B. The pig-
tail would have, say, a female A at one end and a male B at the other
end.) The attenuation is approximately 39.363dB per 100 feet — a
signal-strength loss of 1.6dB over a 4-foot length.
A typical coaxial-cable installation includes several feet of LMR-400
(larger RVs may use as much as 40 feet), with 3 or 4 feet of LMR-100 as a
pigtail, to connect the laptop to the main (LMR-400) coaxial cable.
 How the cable is to be secured: Cable clamps are readily available at
hardware stores such as Lowe’s, Ace, or Home Depot. I’m a big fan of the
clean and neat installation of cable, but just because it’s covered up
doesn’t mean you don’t need to secure it the best way you can.
In the next phase of creating your plan, you need to mark where antenna
cable will run, mark the places where holes might have to be drilled, and
make measurements. Here are the basic steps I follow:
1. Gather the necessary tools: a tape measure, a pencil, masking tape,
and a quarter-inch rope or cord.
The perfect cord to use in planning coaxial cable runs — because it’s
cheap and readily available — is clothesline. It usually comes in 50-foot
lengths and you can use masking tape to hold it in place.
2. To figure out the amount of cable that’s needed, I use clothesline cord
as a stand-in for the coaxial cable and tape the cord in place.
This approach makes it easier to plan for any corners or obstacles to be
negotiated; I can try several different paths to decide which works best.
68
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

LMR-400 coaxial cable has a minimum bend radius of 2 inches, as shown
in Figure 4-8; don’t bend it tighter than that or you’ll crimp and damage
it. When negotiating a corner with this cable, be certain that the arc of
the bend falls within 2 inches. LMR-100 cable is much more flexible, with
a minimum bend radius of .25 inch.
Remember that you always want to use the shortest possible length of
cable that’s practical. That doesn’t mean you have to cut diagonal paths
from one place to another, but if you can easily and neatly use an angle
between the antenna and termination point, go for it.
3. I mark where to place the cable clamps by putting a piece of masking
tape where the clamp will go, and placing my marks on the tape (not
on the metal or upholstery).
By using any existing screw holes — say, those for the mounting screws
for panels, shelves, or cabinets — you can secure plastic cable clamps
without making any other holes. Even if you have to replace the existing
screw with a slightly longer one, it makes for a neater job.
4. After you determine the path, take down your cord and measure it to
find out how much cable you need for your antenna. Make sure you
leave marks where the clamps will go.
5. I find it easiest to install the cable clamps, one at a time, as I’m run-
ning the cable. You can also slide ’em down the cable so they’re
stacked and ready to use.
Making the connection
Once you’ve figured out where you’re going to mount your antenna and the
path the coaxial cable will take from the antenna to the termination point, it’s

time to make connections. Generally speaking, the antenna you purchase
includes several feet of coaxial cable — and, on occasion, a pigtail. These
ready-made cables come complete with the appropriate connectors.
If you need a longer or shorter cable, several online outlets offer custom-
made cables, or you can purchase the cable and connectors separately and
fabricate your own (or you might have an electronics-geek shop in town
make a cable for you). In any case, make sure your connectors are compati-
ble. Table 4-1 lists the most common types of connectors. You can have a
look at these connectors (both male and female versions) in Figure 4-9.

ders. For example, a Reverse Polarity Male connector has a male body but
the dielectric and contact are female. Don’t try to mate a Reverse Polarity
connector and adapter with a standard coaxial connector; doing so will
damage the connectors.
If your antenna cable or pigtail terminates in an N, RP-TNC or RP-SMA con-
nector, you can use a short adapter pigtail to make the connection to your
adapter card. These cables are available from several sources.
All these connector types have available bullet-type adapters. These are used
(for example) to join two N-type male connectors. In all cases, even though
attenuation is minimal (usually between .15dB and .25dB per connector), use
as few connectors or adapters as you possibly can to do the job.

Chapter 4: Putting Your Gear Together

Setting up an outdoor directional antenna
A directional antenna must be free to rotate 360 degrees around its vertical
axis; you can probably imagine some of the difficulties in fabricating a mount-
ing system. Most directional antennas include hardware (usually U-bolts, bar
clamps, and nuts) designed to allow the mounting of the antenna to a pole.
By using the included pole-mounting hardware to attach the antenna to a
short piece of pipe, you’ve created half of the mount.
The second half of this high-tech (yeah, right) mount consists of another short
piece of pipe with an inside diameter that’s equal to — or ever so slightly
larger than — the outside diameter of the pipe to which you’ve mounted your
antenna. This second piece of pipe is what you affix, by whatever method you
deem appropriate, to the body of your vehicle. The first pipe cleverly slides
into the second pipe, leaving the directional antenna free to rotate in any
direction, as shown in Figure 4-10.
Figure 4-10:
This is how
the mount I
describe
might look in
its finished
form.
72
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

If you fabricate and install such a mount, keep a few things in mind:
 Make sure that your antenna is free to rotate through a full 360 degrees
without any interference and without being blocked by any obstructions.
 Once the antenna has been aimed toward the signal source, you need a
way to secure the antenna in that position. There are several ways to do
the job, ranging from a friction clamp to wedges made from Popsicle
sticks to duct tape.
 You can use thick-walled (at least 1/16th inch) PVC pipe for both por-
tions of your fancy homemade antenna-mounting device.
Once you’ve fabricated your mounting device, you need to run antenna
cable. For the most part, you can follow the guidelines set out in the previous
section — with the understanding that you have to be able to connect and
disconnect your antenna quickly and easily from the main antenna cable.
I recommend attaching a short length of LMR-400 cable to your antenna that
has a male type-N connector on the dangling end. That way, with a female
type-N connector on the main portion of the antenna cable, you can easily
connect or disconnect your antenna without disturbing the more perma-
nently installed main antenna cable.
Setting up an indoor antenna
I could seriously impress myself if I could come up with some tantalizing high-
tech secrets for setting up an indoor antenna — but there’s just not much to
it. You attach it to your adapter card and it works. There are only three things
you need to consider, and I know, given the chance, that you (and possibly
Fritz, my stuffed frog) would figure them out with no input from me.
Now that Fritz has heard his name mentioned, he’s listening, so I have to be
careful when I tell you (I don’t want him getting a swelled head), that he is
smarter than the average frog, stuffed or otherwise. For example, I know for
sure that, after very little deliberation, Fritz would 
 Place the antenna as high as possible: Yep, it doesn’t matter whether
it’s an outdoor or indoor antenna; you want to get it up in the air.
 Avoid obstructions: Since wood and metal obstruct Wi-Fi radio signals
and glass is almost interference-free, it makes sense to place the antenna
as close to a window, or windows, as is practical.
73
Chapter 4: Putting Your Gear Together

 Use a “protection” or adapter pigtail: It’s possible that the antenna you
choose will utilize a connector other than the MMCX connection incor-
porated in the SMC2532W-B Wi-Fi card or the MC connector found on the
Buffalo WLI-CB-G54A card. You can adapt the antenna to the card by
using a pigtail with the appropriate connecters at either end. (See
“Making the connection,” earlier in this chapter.)
Putting an External Amplifier in the Mix
I’ve found it really handy to amplify my wireless signal when I’m hauling over-
dimensional freight (you know — WIDE LOAD stuff). It’s hard enough to find
adequate parking when I’m hauling freight that fits nicely on the trailer, but
hauling something wide or long cuts down my choices and usually leaves me
looking for my hiking boots and canteen for the trek to the truck stop to get a
shower and a meal. (It feels like that, anyway.)
When parking that far from the facilities, it often seems that the wireless
signal strength lacks gusto. In those situations, if you have an amplifier in
conjunction with a high-gain antenna, you’re still in business. Here’s where
the sections entitled “Setting up an outdoor omnidirectional antenna” and
“Setting up an outdoor directional antenna” come in especially handy: The
same guidelines for installing the antenna, as well as for planning and
installing the coaxial antenna cable, apply to an amplifier — with only one
additional consideration: leave the coax a bit longer. Here’s why . . . 
When installing an external amplifier, always leave the terminating end of the
coax about eight to ten inches longer than you otherwise might. That way, if
you need to bend the cable to connect it to the amplifier, you can do it gently.
The amplifier can then be easily incorporated into the system.
Providing power is the only real problem I’ve encountered when installing an
amplifier, whether for intermittent or constant use. The amplifiers included in
most kits include a power cord designed to provide 12 volts of DC power to
the device. In most instances, this cord is long enough to reach the power
source it’s designed to access — but sometimes you might find that the
placement you’ve chosen for your amplifier is a bit too far from the plug.
Resist the urge to alter the power cord provided with your amplifier. You’ll likely
void your amplifier’s warranty and you might damage the transformer. Rather
than try to splice extra lengths of wire into the cord, you’re better off if you
install a compatible plug close to the location of the amplifier. If you feel that
you absolutely, positively, must lengthen or otherwise alter the cord, call the
manufacturer before you do so. See whether they can make up a custom cord
or provide you with an alternative solution.
74
Part I: The Wonderful World of Wireless Fidelity 

I’ve been told by people I trust that the coaxial cable between an amplifier
and an antenna must be a minimum of 18 inches long. I personally recom-
mend doubling that minimum so any bends in the cable will be gentle.
Installing for intermittent use
The primary reason for installing an amplifier that you only use intermittently
is purely one of neighborly consideration. Providing you followed my advice
about extending your range in Chapter 3, your system, including an amplifier,
won’t exceed the FCC power-output regulations. Even so, when you find your-
self parked three feet from another hotspot user, it’s possible that your high-
output setup might cause interference problems for your neighbors.
By mounting the amplifier near the termination point of your coax, you can
simply disconnect your antenna cable and pigtail from the amplifier and con-
nect the pigtail directly to the antenna cable, bypassing the amplifier. This
arrangement gives you the benefit of a high-gain antenna without creating an
interference problem for your neighbors every time you use Wi-Fi.
Be sure that your amplifier is powered down before you disconnect the coax-
ial cables. Failing to do so might damage the amplifier.
Installing for constant use
A permanent, constant-use installation differs from an intermittent installa-
tion only in the options available to you for slightly increasing the efficiency
of your amplifier and antenna. By locating your amplifier close to your antenna,
you can limit attenuation to a level that’s nearly immeasurable. If you’re using
LMR-400 coaxial cable (as I’ve suggested) and your cable run is, say, 20 feet,
then your signal-strength loss is approximately 1.34dB. This is by no means
excessive — but you can reduce loss to less than .25dB if you place your
amplifier 3 feet from the antenna.
Because you don’t need to connect and disconnect from the amplifier, there’s
no reason to locate it near the area you’ll most likely use your computer and
you’re free to mount it anywhere that’s convenient. You might even, in this
type of installation, be able to mount your amplifier in an area that’s both
nearer the antenna and closer to the power source.
If a constant-use installation is something you’re considering, you might also
want to make sure you have an alternate method of connecting with hotspots
just in case you do run across a situation in which your amplifier is causing
problems for your neighbors.

ing e-mail from hotspots can sometimes be a source of frus-
tration, I describe some means and methods of e-mailing
from hotspots that make it at least as reliable as the Pony

ecause public wireless networks (better known as hotspots) have limited
broadcast ranges, you can’t just park anywhere and expect to connect to
the Internet via Wi-Fi. You might, however, be surprised at the number of places
besides truck stops making wireless Internet access available to you. The trick
is in finding those places when you’re traveling through unfamiliar areas.
In this chapter, I tell you about my favorite methods of finding hotspots that
might be hospitable to large vehicles.
Checking Wireless Directories
I’m big on directories. I’ve got about three truck stop and diesel fuel directories;
I’ve got a couple of truck service directories; I’ve got two tire service directories,
and I’ve even got a few phone directories that I carry around with me. For the
most part, though, a lot of the information printed in these books is also avail-
able on the Net. For example, www.dieselboss.com has several excellent
online directories available, including a comprehensive truck stop directory —
which I’ve been using with greater frequency because it’s updated often.
When it comes to finding hotspots, you also have several online choices.
Online directories make perfect sense because the number of hotspots in the
U.S., Canada, and around the world is growing so fast that a printed directory
would be obsolete before it ever made it to the shelves. A few of the available
online directories are
 JiWire.com: The JiWire search engine and database powers several
directories besides their own. The best among them are
• Wi-Fi Zone Finder: Not long ago, the Wi-Fi Alliance partnered with
JiWire to provide a directory of hotspots that are Wi-Fi Certified

(meaning that, because all the equipment used by the hotspot is
Wi-Fi Certified, your Wi-Fi Certified equipment is guaranteed to be
compatible). It can be found at http://wi-fi.jiwire.com.
• PC World Hotspot Finder: Along with the hotspot locator powered
by JiWire, PC World lists links to articles relevant to Wi-Fi users.
Topics covered include buying guides and how-to articles. You can
find it at http://pcworld.jiwire.com.
• USA Today Tech wireless center: Here you can find links to current
news and articles pertaining specifically to wireless technology
along with the JiWire hotspot locator. The page is found at
http://usatoday.jiwire.com.
In true geek fashion, the word JiWire is a kind of acronym invented by
the owners of this Web business. They couldn’t find a verb meaning “to
connect devices wirelessly,” so they invented this one, which means,
“joining invisible wires.” This is my favorite online directory because it’s
more than just a directory service. JiWire offers a ton of advice and arti-
cles ranging from new product reviews to a Wi-Fi user guide and a dis-
cussion forum.
 WiFi411.com: This site isn’t as versatile and doesn’t offer as many ser-
vices as JiWire.com, but I still use it quite a bit, because within the
results, a lot of useful information is included, such as the number of
access points and the wireless standard that the hotspot uses.
 Wi-FiHotSpotList.com: Billing itself as “The Definitive Wi-Fi HotSpot
Directory,” this site is an offshoot of Wi-FiPlanet.com. I don’t know if
they’re the definitive directory or not, but I do know that a wealth of
wireless information is tucked within the pages of Wi-FiPlanet.com.
 VZ Local Search: Although this site isn’t technically a directory, I’ve
found VZ Local Search to be a very useful traveling tool. This site, at
www.vzlocal.com, focuses on finding highlights and attractions,
including hotspots, in various localities.
 The Wi-Fi-FreeSpot Directory: There are more free access hotspots than
you can shake a stick at, and this directory, which is part of the JiWire
Network and found at www.wififreespot.com, focuses exclusively on
them. It also provides some information and guidelines regarding eti-
quette and use of these free hotspots.
Getting the most out of online directories
Most of the directories use filters so that, by setting some parameters, you
can narrow your search in ways that are likely to return results that fit your
particular situation. The amount of filtering available varies from one direc-
tory to another, but in most cases, the better you get at using these tools, the
better your search results are.
80
Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

For example, at JiWire, the advanced search feature includes a filter that
includes cafes and campgrounds as well as RV parks and travel centers. By
specifying the type of business or venue you’re searching for, you can narrow
your search in such a way that the results should correspond nicely with
your needs.
When you’re using the filters provided within these directories, keep in mind
that you don’t want to totally ignore businesses like a coffeehouse or book-
store that might be located near an area easily accessible to an RV or truck.
I’ve been able to connect, on occasion, with a coffeehouse or motel hotspot
located near a truck stop that had no wireless access, and once, when staying
in a motel that offered no access, I was able to connect to the hotspot pro-
vided by a neighboring RV park.
As good as these directories are, they’re absolutely not perfection in motion.
With the number of hotspots opening up each day, it’s not likely that all of
them will be listed in any one directory. Online directories also rely on infor-
mation provided to them by either the proprietors or users of the business or
venue making the hotspot available. Most of them take great pains to verify
that the information they provide is accurate, but if, for example, a coffee-
house goes out of business or an RV park ceases to offer Wi-Fi to its cus-
tomers and no one bothers to inform the directories, it might be quite some
time before it’s removed.
Putting a directory on your device
So, here you are with “Nowhere” lurking on the horizon, and you’re wonder-
ing where you can find a nearby hotspot. Obviously, using an online directory
when you’re looking for a place to connect seems a bit silly. Fortunately, the
good folks at JiWire have anticipated this very problem. In early 2004, JiWire
unveiled a downloadable hotspot directory that can be updated whenever
the user is online. In May of 2005, however, the free directory was rolled into
a hotspot security utility known as SpotLock. The directory is still free, and
you can download SpotLock and choose to use the directory free of charge.
You can’t, however, choose to download the directory only. I cover the full
SpotLock security utility in Chapter 10, and you can find complete instruc-
tions for downloading and using it there.
Using Wireless Network Detectors
With or without a hotspot directory, online or otherwise, it’s sometimes nice
to be able to detect the presence of a wireless signal. You might, for example,
want to connect to a particular hotspot, but you wonder if you’re too far from
the signal source to make the connection. You could get out your laptop,
81
Chapter 5: Spotting Hotspots

boot it up, and find out whether you’ve got a good signal where you’re at —
but an easier solution is to use a Wi-Fi network detector.
Network detectors, sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi sniffers, are usually fairly
small units — some are designed to fit on a key chain. Before you rush out to
buy one, know that owning one of these devices is indicative of potential
membership in that group commonly referred to as geeks. I put a piece of
duct tape over the Star Trek insignia on my shirt when I use one so that some
doubt about my geek status remains.
Shopping for a Wi-Fi detector
Several manufacturers of wireless products include one or more Wi-Fi detec-
tors in their line of offerings, and at least one company’s primary product is a
highly acclaimed wireless network detector. But the field isn’t filled with a
wide choice of products. In some ways, that’s good because you don’t have a
confusing array of devices to choose from, but in other ways, it’s not so good
because there’s not so much competition-driven innovation.
When you’re shopping for a wireless detector, consider these things:
 Accuracy of network detection: This might seem too obvious to be
listed, but not all detectors can detect the presence of a wireless net-
work with a high level of accuracy. Some inaccurate detectors indicate
the presence of a network when, in fact, a microwave oven or cordless
phone is the only thing present. In other cases, it’s not that the detector
indicates the presence of a nonexistent network, but rather that they fail
to recognize the existence of one or more networks in a given area.
 Signal strength indication: Most detectors offer only a few lights to indi-
cate relative signal strength but at least one of them uses a bar graph
displayed on an LCD screen.
 Additional features: With only the first two features, you have a good
idea as to the presence and relative strength of a signal, but consider
these things as well:
• SSID (Service Set Identifier): The SSID is merely the name of the net-
work. If you’re trying to connect with the Flying J hotspot while
you’re in an adjacent parking lot, it’s good to know whether your
detector is picking up the Flying J signal or that of a nearby home
or business wireless network.
• Security status: Because you’re looking for open networks, it’s nice
to know whether the networks being detected are open or secure.
By the way, just because a network is open doesn’t mean the
owner intends it to be open to the public. I talk more about this
issue in Chapter 6.
82
Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

• Channel: This feature tells you how much interference there might
be when connecting with a nearby hotspot. If several other net-
works are in the area and on the same channel you might have a
bit more interference than if the channels of the nearby networks
are spaced apart.
The device you choose to purchase, if indeed you want one of these gadgets,
depends largely on the amount of information you want to gather. The follow-
ing list illustrates a few of the choices you have:
 Intego WiFi Locator (www.intego.com): This keychain-type device
looks a bit like those remote door-lock devices everybody seems to
have. (I guess if I ever replace my ‘68 Ford pickup, I’ll get one.) With only
a button and four LEDs, this device doesn’t give you a whole lot of info.
 Smith Micro QuickLink Wi-Fi Seeker (www.smithmicro.com): This
one looks exactly like the Intego WiFi Locater, and if you look at the specs
for both, those also match; they even cost almost exactly the same.
 Kensington WiFi Finder Plus (http://us.kensington.com/html/
5703.html): This is another key chain device with a string of LED signal
strength indicators. This one uses five lights and also includes a
Bluetooth detector.
 Canary Digital Hotspotter (www.canarywireless.com/hs10.html):
The Digital Hotspotter is a bit bigger than keychain devices but offers
more information. With this device you can find out not only the presence
and strength of the signal, but also name, channel, and security status.
Another group of Wi-Fi detectors does double duty as wireless adapters. As
adapters, the ones I highlight are all USB-powered; as detectors, they use a Li-
ion battery and can be used independently of your laptop. Here are three: 
 Linksys WUSBF54G: SSID, signal strength, channel, and security status
are displayed on the LCD screen in the order of strength. The device can
also be configured so that only “open” 802.11b and g networks are
detected. See www.linksys.com.
 TRENDnet TEW-509UB: You can customize hotspot searches to find 
networks by SSID, signal strength, or security, and the Li-ion battery is
recharged when connected to the USB port. Find more at www.trend
net.com.
 ZyXEL AG-225H: Offering the ability to scroll through the available net-
works, this detector indicates, on its LCD screen, information including
SSID, signal strength, and channel. Besides 802.11b and g networks, the
AG-225H detects 802.11a networks, too. You can find details at www.us.
zyxel.com.

Chapter 5: Spotting Hotspots

Sniffing out a signal
To use a wireless network detector, you need to have mastered the art of
pushing buttons. My wife tells me I’m an expert button-pusher, and I suspect
that every truck driver on the face of the earth is also quite well qualified.
(I’m sure this trait applies equally for those pushing an RV down the road.)
With the two keychain detectors, you just push the button, and if a hotspot
or wireless network is detected, the LEDs light up, indicating relative signal
strength. By turning a total of 360 degrees, 90 degrees at a time, you can get a
good idea of the direction in which the detected signal is originating.
With each push of the button, these devices detect a single network. If you’re
in an area where more than one hotspot is present, you might have to push
the button several times — and face a different direction with each push of
the button — to find the strongest signal. You’d think that the strongest one
would be detected first, but for some reason, that’s not always the case. The
Canary Digital Hotspotter, like the keychain detectors, also picks up just one
hotspot at a time, so you need to push the button a few times to be sure you
exhaust the potential list of hotspot candidates. When you push the button,
the display indicates that the device is looking for networks, and if one is dis-
covered, it displays information pertaining to it. If you push the button again,
it scans for hotspots again. If a new wireless signal is detected, the informa-
tion for that network is displayed, or if no other network is detected, the
information for the first one is displayed. If no networks are present, the dis-
play gives that indication.
The detector-adapter combo units work in a similar fashion but, since they
detect all the available networks with one push of the button, you only need
to push buttons as you make each 90-degree turn.
Putting Network Detection 
Software to Work
Whatever connection management utility you happen to use, whether it’s
WZC, JiWire, or the utility included with your wireless adapter, it includes
some form of active-scanning, network detection software. Also available are
several stand-alone software applications designed to provide as much infor-
mation as possible concerning the available networks in a given area.
Active scanning network detection software sends out probe requests on
every channel that the wireless radio transceiver is configured to use. Most
cards in North America are configured for Channels 1 through 11. (A few
cards use Channel 6 only. If that’s the only channel your card is configured
84
Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

for, that’s the only channel that the probe request goes out on.) If any
hotspots are detected in the area, the AP (access point) sends a probe
response in answer to the request.
By installing one of these active scanning utilities on your laptop, you can get
quite a bit of valuable information. Among other things, you can use it to help
you accurately aim a directional antenna. With the installation of a network
detection application, you can turn a PDA into a highly effective wireless net-
work detector. Among the large number of available program applications are
the following:
 NetStumbler: I think I can say, without fear of contradiction, that this is
the most popular of the publicly available wireless network detection
software applications.
 MiniStumbler: Designed to be used on Pocket PCs, the application is
both effective and easy to use.
 WiFiFoFum: The name alone is reason enough to make mention of this
application written for use on a Pocket PC.
Both ’Stumbler software programs are, according to the author, Marius Milner,
“beggarware.” Although they’re offered free of cost, if you use one and like it,
you can (as a person of honor) leave a donation to help defray costs and pro-
vide a bit of remuneration for the author’s efforts. Beggarware also means the
software has no warranty — so if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work, and you
can’t expect a whole lot of technical support.
’Stumbler software isn’t extensively tested for hardware compatibility; although
it’s compatible with most integrated wireless solutions and adapter cards, it
might not work with yours. If it doesn’t, just delete the program from your
system — it won’t cause any problems either way. I’ve tried it out with a few
different adapter cards, as well as integrated wireless, and it’s worked well in
each case. But as they say on TV, your results might vary.
WiFiFoFum seems to be no more extensively tested, and it’s compatible with the
Windows Mobile 2003 platforms only. However, Aspecto Software (the group
that developed WiFiFoFum) is continually working on newer versions, so I
expect it to be compatible with Windows Mobile 5.0 as well. As far as which
combination of Pocket PC devices and wireless solutions it works with —
built-in, CF, or SDIO — all I can say is: Give it a try. The cool, radar-like display
is worth the effort to download and install it.
Adding NetStumbler to a laptop

Configuring NetStumbler
Double-click the NetStumbler antenna icon on your desktop to launch the
utility. The first screen you see might be empty and gray. That’s okay. The
amount of configuration you need to do depends on your situation. Familiarize
yourself with a few of the items available on the two toolbars.
A lot of the available options are geared toward users who engage in the geek
sport of wardriving. You might have seen this term — which, according to
legend, was coined by Marius Milner — referenced in various places on the
Internet. The term is derived from the 1983 movie, WarGames, in which David
Lightman, played by Matthew Broderick, breaks into a Department of Defense
computer by using a technique called wardialing. These days, wardrivers
cruise around town in their geekmobiles, packing laptops loaded with active
and passive scanning-detection software and some strange-looking antennas,
searching out open wireless networks — otherwise known as nodes. Because
the legality of this activity is in doubt, and because you probably won’t be
cruising through quiet neighborhoods in your truck or RV looking for open
home networks you can hack into, I don’t dwell on those features of
NetStumbler.
Take a look at Tables 5-1 and 5-2 for a brief description of a few of the perti-
nent features.

Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

The first thing you want to do after starting NetStumbler is set some session
parameters:
1. Click Options, and click the General tab. Set the scan speed to fast, as
shown in Figure 5-3.
This increases the frequency of the scans, which, in turn, increases the
accuracy of the updates. It also makes it easier to use the available infor-
mation to aim a directional antenna.
2. Still working with the Options dialog box, click the MIDI tab, and
select the Enable MIDI Output of SNR check box.
When you enable this feature, NetStumbler gives an audible indication of
each AP’s signal strength. The higher the tone, the stronger the signal.
The other choices alter the tone sound and pitch, and you can fiddle
with them until you’ve found a sufficiently annoying sound.
3. Click Apply, and then click OK.
The Options dialog box closes, and the settings are applied.
Finding a network
When you first launch NetStumbler on your laptop, your screen is a lifeless
gray. To find a network, follow these steps:
1. Click the New icon to start a new session and open a new session dis-
play window.
You should notice, in the right pane of the window, a number of APs
within your view. If, at the bottom of the NetStumbler window, you see
the words No APs active, you’re either in an area without any wire-
less networks, or NetStumbler isn’t using the correct device.
Figure 5-3:
Speed up
the scan
speed.
89
Chapter 5: Spotting Hotspots

2. Click the Device menu, and if you see a check mark by a wireless card
other than the one you’re using, select it, as shown in Figure 5-5.
For example, NetStumbler by default wants to use my integrated wire-
less card, but because I’m using my Buffalo WLI-CB-G54A adapter, I need
to select that card instead. 
3. In the pane on the right, you see the wireless networks available, as
shown in Figure 5-4.
NetStumbler uses different colors for the active AP icons to indicate the
strength of the signal. Green indicates a strong signal that you, very
likely, can connect with. Red, as you might have guessed, is a signal that
isn’t a good connection candidate. Yellow indicates a marginal, maybe-
yes-and-maybe-no signal, and gray indicates a signal that’s barely
detectable. If you see a small lock icon within the signal strength icon,
that’s an indication that the detected network is secured and unavail-
able for public connection. Hotspots, because they’re open to the
public, won’t be secured.
Using ’Stumbler to aim your antenna
Okay, you’re ready to use NetStumbler to help you aim your directional.
Focus your attention, now, on the left pane of the session window and follow
these steps:
1. Click the + (plus sign) next to the SSID heading to expand the informa-
tion tree.
Figure 5-4:
Two
networks
are in range
of my card:
Flying J and

90
Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

2. Now click the + (plus sign) next to the SSID name you’re intending to
connect with to further expand the information tree and display the
hotspot MAC address.
3. Click the MAC address.
This changes the right pane into a graphic signal strength display. The
green portion of the display represents the strength of the signal, and
the red portion, on the bottom, indicates the noise level. Not every card
displays the noise level.
4. By slowly — very slowly — turning your antenna, you notice that the
graph indicates a rise or fall of signal strength.
Because you enabled the sound feature, you should also hear tone pitch
getting higher or lower. 
5. Once you’ve found the best direction to point your antenna, don’t
forget to move it up and down through the vertical axis to further
increase the accuracy of your aim.
When the tone and the graph have reached their highest points, your
antenna is optimally aimed.
In Figure 5-5, you can see that as I move my antenna, pointing it more accu-
rately toward the signal source, the graph begins to move upward until I go
past the optimal aim. As I begin to move back, the graph again spikes. You
might also notice that after I connect the antenna, a whole bunch more APs
appear. It might be noted that the Buffalo connection utility indicates the
presence of only two APs, while the JiWire connection utility sees the same
available networks that NetStumbler does.

Chapter 5: Spotting Hotspots

Some other cool features are, if you’re not wardriving, just toys. The main
one I’m thinking of is the GPS function that can put a latitude and longitude
with each location. Another handy feature lets you perform a WHOIS inquiry
on the IP address of the AP, which might help to determine whether it’s a
legitimate hotspot. Just right-click the MAC address shown in the right pane
to start the search. In addition, applications such as StumbVerter, by Sonar
Security, that can take that information and import it to a mapping utility like
MapPoint.
Adding MiniStumbler to your PDA
If you have a PDA, you can install MiniStumber on your computer, following
the same steps for installing NetStumber, outlined earlier in this chapter.
After the installation is completed, you can choose to open the Readme file. I
suggest doing so, but if you’d rather do so later, you can access it from the
Help menu. When a reminder to check your Pocket PC opens, click OK. You
can now connect your Pocket PC to your computer via cable or cradle. Your
sync software starts automatically, and the files upload to the handheld.
That’s pretty much the size of it, and you’re ready to give MiniStumbler a go.
The menus, icons, and features of MiniStumbler, although not as extensive,
are very similar to NetStumbler. Each of the items and icons that correspond
with those found on NetStumbler offers the same functionality. That means
that you can configure MiniStumbler and use it in much the same way as you
would NetStumbler, with a couple of exceptions. First, MiniStumbler doesn’t
support the MIDI tone, and second, it has no graphic display of the signal
strength and noise.
Most of the information that you can get from the NetStumbler right pane is
also available from MiniStumbler, but in order to see it, you have to scroll a
bit more. MiniStumbler also uses the same intuitive colors to indicate signal
strength and the same lock icon to indicate a secured network.
GPS functionality in MiniStumbler is also very similar to that of NetStumbler,
and like in NetStumbler, right-clicking the MAC address opens a menu allow-
ing you to perform a WHOIS inquiry on displayed IP addresses.

Using Truck – and RV – Friendly
Hotspots
In This Chapter
 Exploring your options
 Connecting to a hotspot
 Troubleshooting problems
 Getting the e-mail delivered
B
ack in the dark ages of mobile computing (those dismal days when
dialup was dominant), an open phone jack was all an establishment
needed to be considered-friendly. To a certain extent, that’s still true — but
because connecting to the Internet from the comfort of your rolling home is
so convenient, many people avoid venues that don’t offer Wi-Fi in addition to
dialup. But how (considering the proliferation of providers) do you make an
informed decision regarding which Wi-Fi service to sign up with — and
whether to make a long- or short-term commitment to that provider?
In this chapter, I help you make some decisions by delving into the details of
your available choices. I give you an idea of what you can expect the first time
you pull into a truck stop or RV park in hopes of using a wireless Internet
connection. I also help you make that connection — and offer tips on trou-
bleshooting a few common problems. Because sending e-mail is sometimes
an issue at hotspots, I spend some time investigating the problems surround-
ing it, and offer some solutions.
Evaluating Your Choices
I don’t remember a technology that’s caught on and spread as rapidly as 
Wi-Fi. I’m sure there’ve been hundreds of rapidly spreading technologies, 

and that you can remember several, but I don’t. I’m sure of one thing —
because of the rapid spread of Wi-Fi, no one has a monopoly on the wireless
Internet access market. As a matter of fact, while some dominant players
have emerged, literally thousands of Wi-Fi providers offer services ranging
from free wireless Internet access at their own business to nationwide or
international wireless Internet services. The latter are known as wireless
Internet service providers (WISPs).
Filling in the middle ground are vast numbers of companies and enterprises
engaging in the business of setting up hotspots custom tailored to their cus-
tomers’ needs. Often, these companies specialize in specific venues such as
truck stops and travel centers, RV parks and campgrounds, hotels and motels,
or restaurants and cafes. Most of these make an attempt to set up a network of
hotspots at similar locations so that folks who frequent these similar venues
can purchase a monthly Wi-Fi subscription and plan their stops accordingly.
Although long-term commitments at reduced rates are attractive — you can
whittle the cost from $4 to $10 per day to $1 to $2 per day — the caveat to
commitment is one of accessibility. If you, for whatever reason, don’t find
yourself frequenting the same RV park or truck stop chain most days, the dis-
count doesn’t make the commitment worthwhile. Of course, influencing your
choice is part of the provider’s plan. If you have a compelling reason to — such
as access to a pool, a good buffet, or Wi-Fi — you might bypass the mom-and-
pop park or truck stop so you can enjoy the amenity you seek. Some might
feel their freedom and spontaneity slipping away, while others might find a
new feeling of comfort in familiar surroundings and service.
Because of quality-of-service issues, I still recommend a try-before-you-buy
trial period. By that, I mean: Use the service at a few locations to find out
whether you’re happy with the quality and ease of use. In addition to that,
make an effort to evaluate your habits before you enter a long-term commit-
ment. Here are a few things to consider:
 Regular routes: Whether you travel by truck or RV, do you usually main-
tain a regular route? If you do, it’s possible, even likely, that your stops
are also fairly regular. If you find that you already stop at the same chain
most of the time, a long-term commitment might be in order.
 Mandated fuel stops: With skyrocketing fuel costs, many trucking com-
panies strive to control costs by making deals with fuel providers and
insisting that drivers buy fuel at specific locations. If these locations also
offer Wi-Fi, again, a long-term commitment might be worthwhile.
 Long stays: This pertains more to RVers than truckers. If you stay at a
park for an extended period of time, signing up for a single week or month
would seem to make sense — even though a multi-month or annual sub-
scription might not be wise.

Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

Truck stops and travel centers
A few years ago, I first found out that the Broadway Flying J in Tacoma,
Washington, had become — at least, as far as I know — the first truck stop 
to offer a wireless Internet connection to its customers. I was ecstatic —
never mind the fact that I have never been able to find a parking place any-
where near this truck stop, let alone in the parking lot.
Even though I knew I’d never use a Wi-Fi connection there, I was equally sure
that it was just a matter of time before Wi-Fi spread across the country and
became widely available at truck stops where I could park. And I was right.
Before I knew it, truck stop after truck stop was becoming a hotspot. The
early drawback was, however, that a few start-up WISPs bit the dust shortly
after signing up a bunch of long-term customers. Others, though, (like Flying
J and TA TravelCenters) became WISPs themselves or (like Pilot, Petro, and
Love’s) partnered with companies that demonstrated a level of stability and
business sense that mirrored their own.
These days, a majority of truck stops and travel centers — both chains and
independents — make wireless Internet connections available to those who
find food and refuge in their restaurants and parking lots. Because of the
number of independents and small chains offering Wi-Fi, a complete and 
comprehensive list is not forthcoming but what follows is a pretty good list 
of the major players.
 Flying J Travel Plazas: I have to list them first. They were the first to
offer Wi-Fi, and they might well be the most widely available hotspot
operator catering to truckers and RV enthusiasts. Besides offering 
Wi-Fi at their travel centers, they also have hotspots set up at various
extended areas.
 TA TravelCenters: Offering what they call TA SpeedZone WiFi Hotspots
at more than 150 of their travel centers, TA has to rank near the top of
any truck stop hotspot list.
 Pilot Travel Centers: Pilot (like many others desiring to offer Wi-Fi to
their customers) went through some hotspot growing pains, but now,
with SiriCOMM, they’ve partnered with a very stable WISP.
 Love’s Travel Stops: I include them just below Pilot because (like Pilot)
they suffered through similar Wi-Fi woes, and now, (like Pilot) they’ve
partnered with SiriCOMM as their wireless Internet access provider.
 IdleAire Technologies: IdleAire is an attractive choice because they’re
not a chain-specific service. You’re as likely to find them located at a
Pilot or Petro as you are to find them at a Love’s or TA. Wi-Fi is only one
small portion of what this company offers at truck stops equipped with
their award-winning Advanced Truckstop Electrification (ATE) system.
95
Chapter 6: Using Truck — and RV — Friendly Hotspots

IdleAire, undergoing a rapid expansion, is popping up all over the place
at truck stops and travel plazas.
 Bosselman Travel Centers: Although they’re not a large, nationwide,
chain, Bosselman is among the very few truck stops to offer free Wi-Fi at
their locations in Nebraska, Kansas, and Iowa.
When you compare the plans and services, Bosselman Travel Centers offers
the simplest of all the plans as I write this book — it’s free. After that,
although none of the plans are complicated, they do vary somewhat in cost,
as you can see in Table 6-1.

An annual or even month-by-month commitment to Flying J, TA, SiriCOMM, 
or IdleAire is cheaper than similar subscriptions from most other national
providers, particularly those common in coffee shops such as Starbucks. One
of the few services that come close to competing with truck-stop and travel-
center monthly rates is Boingo Wireless, which charges $21.95 a month, but
some of their hotspot locations tack on an extra usage fee.
You should know, however, that even if you have an IdleAire Wi-Fi subscrip-
tion, the cost of using the full IdleAire facilities isn’t reduced. (But I did put
that bug in someone’s ear.)
Another area of interest, at least to truckers, is Wi-Fi at the weigh station.
SiriCOMM is the primary WISP providing hotspots at PrePass weigh stations
around the country. I’m not one that really enjoys hanging out at the scale
house but — sometimes voluntarily and sometimes not — I have spent a
night or three relaxing in the soft glow of the Scales Open sign. Doing so 
with wireless Internet access makes the stay much more enjoyable.

RV parks and campgrounds
Following hot on the heels of the wildfire-like spread of Wi-Fi availability in truck
stops and travel plazas is the rapid proliferation of wireless Internet access at
RV parks and campgrounds. Ranging from mom-and-pop parks installing a
single wireless router that campers can access only if they’re visiting the office
to major deployments utilizing multiple access points, bridges, or antennas that
cover every campsite, your choices are both varied and inconsistent.
Besides quality of service inconsistencies, the question of cost is equally
varied and inconsistent. The RV park and campground operators seem to be
separated into three camps of similar size. Yes, I did intend the pun. Anyway,
some park and campground operators view wireless Internet access as an
amenity to be included in the space rental cost, believing that “free” Internet
access draws customers and promotes loyalty. At the other end of the spec-
trum, another group of operators apparently views Wi-Fi as a luxury — and
charges accordingly. In between these two camps is a group offering wireless
Internet access at a reasonable and competitive cost.
Many of the parks and campgrounds offering Wi-Fi partner with a WISP or a
hotspot installation and management company that specializes in park or
campground installations. These partnerships can be structured in several
ways, but usually, customer and technical support, as well as any billing, is
handled by the WISP or management company, not the park. In most cases,
these installations are custom tailored to the park or campground, taking all
the variables into consideration.
One of the major issues surrounding RV park and campground Wi-Fi installa-
tions is that of signal coverage. Because trees, buildings, hills, and even other
RVs often clutter the line of sight between you and the access point, make
sure that you ask — when you’re renting your site — if the Wi-Fi coverage
extends to the area you’re being assigned.
Many of the providers, because of the way they set up their partnerships,
offer fee-based access only one day or week at a time. Others, with set fee
structures, offer daily, monthly, and annual subscriptions. A few of the major
RV-park and campground Wi-Fi providers include
 TengoInternet: Wi-Fi charges vary from one RV park to another, and
because of that, Tengo doesn’t offer portable subscription plans. Users
must sign up for service onsite, and most TengoInternet hotspot loca-
tions also offer prepaid cards.
 Nomad Internet: By providing a wide-ranging menu of installation levels
and services, a venue owner can choose the installation that best meets
97
Chapter 6: Using Truck — and RV — Friendly Hotspots

its customers needs. The park operator can also choose whether to
include the cost in the camping fee or charge separately. Only on-site
signup is available.
 RVwifi: With partnership and roaming agreements, a subscription to
RVwifi gets you access in many venues other than RV parks and camp-
grounds. Monthly subscriptions with an annual commitment also include
dialup service. You can sign up onsite or on the Web at www.rvwifi.com.
 Boingo Wireless: Although they don’t specialize in setting up RV parks
or campgrounds, a subscription to Boingo garners wireless Internet
access at over 200 RV parks and campgrounds as well as hundreds of
other venues. You can sign up for Boingo, and download their free Wi-Fi-
connection utility, at one of their hotspot locations or on the Web at
www.boingo.com.
 Coach Connect: Offering daily, monthly, and seasonal (six-month) sub-
scriptions, you can sign up at a hotspot location only. Coach Connect
doesn’t yet have a huge network of hotspots, but they’re working on it.
They also provide wireless Internet access at all the rest areas in the
state of Texas. You can get more info at www.coachconnect.net.
 Hotspotzz Network: With hundreds of venues — most of them RV parks
and campgrounds — you can choose a monthly subscription that includes
both dialup and wireless Internet access, or Wi-Fi only. Hotspotzz is the
WISP for most of the KOA Kampgrounds. You can get more information
and sign up online at www.hotspotzz.com.
 KOA Konnect: If you usually “kamp” the KOA way, this might be the best
deal on wheels. Most — not all, but most — of the hotspots provided by
Hotspotzz and the KOA Konnect package also include dialup. You can
get more information or sign up online at www.koakonnect.com/
preportal/index.asp.
 LinkSpot Networks: They do it right. I’ve never had a problem getting
connected at an RV park set up by LinkSpot. They offer hourly, daily,
weekly, and monthly subscriptions. You can sign up on-site, or online 
at www.linkspot.com.
I can’t come close to providing an exhaustive list of those WISPs servicing RV
parks and campgrounds. Consult several online resources like Web sites and
hotspot directories for more information. (I talk about directories in Chapter 5.)
A few Web sites that I find both entertaining and helpful include
 RV.net: This site has more information than you could, if you were so
inclined, shake a stick at. Check it out at www.rv.net.
 RVtravel.com: This site offers information, resources, and a pretty good
forum. Point your browser toward www.rvtravel.com.
98
Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

 Trailer Life Directory: This is the online home of the printed directory
and offers information for those new to the life and those who could write
a book. They’ve got, at least in my opinion, one of the best RV forums on
the Web. You can find them at www.tldirectory.com/index.cfm.
Hotels, motels, and cafés
Although hotels, motels, and cafes might be frequented more often by airborne
business travelers than RVers and truckers, they can, nonetheless, be handy
places to get online while traveling the highway. These days just about every
local specialty coffeehouse or bagel shop has a wireless hotspot, and many
hotels and motels (and even a fast food restaurant or two), are serving up Wi-Fi.
99
Chapter 6: Using Truck — and RV — Friendly Hotspots
Connecting at rest areas
Is using wireless services at rest areas a trend?
I don’t really know, but three states — Texas,
Michigan and Iowa — offer wireless Internet
access in their rest areas (or, as the Texans call
them, safety rest areas). Each state, not sur-
prisingly, has a different take on the concept of
providing wireless Internet access to the trav-
eling public.
In Iowa, you can log on to the World Wide Web
wire-free, for free, at all but one rest area. You
can’t surf free of charge for long — 30 minutes
is the limit — but that’s long enough to down-
load your e-mail; then you can head off to the
next one and send your replies.
The Texas solution is far different. Cruise into
any rest stop in Texas — choose from over a
hundred of them — and you can get two hours
of free wireless Internet access.
In order to log on to the hotspots provided in
Texas rest areas, you need to enter credit card
information to establish your account. Your card
won’t be charged for the first two hours, and 
at the end of that period, you’re given the option
of continuing the service; if you say yes, the
WISP — which is Coach Connect — charges
the cost to your card. Coast Connect, working
under the name Road Connect, is also in the
process of providing Wi-Fi services in the rest
areas of Washington, Oregon, California, and
Kansas.
Lastly, Michigan contracted with SBC (now
AT&T) as their hotspot provider, so, if you’re 
an AT&T Wi-Fi subscriber, you can get online
under your current subscription. Otherwise, for
$7.95 per day, you can get wireless Internet
access through the MiWiFi program at three
rest areas — the New Buffalo Welcome Center,
Coldwater Welcome Center, and Clarkston Rest
Area — as well as at several Michigan state
parks.
For more information concerning rest area Wi-Fi,
you can browse to the following Web addresses:
 Iowa rest areas: www.ispotaccess.
com
 Texas safety rest areas: www.road
connect.net
 Michigan rest area information: www.
michigan.gov/wifi

When wireless Internet access is offered in a hotel or motel, it’s usually an
amenity included in the price of the room, but ask before you book the reserva-
tion. Cafés, restaurants, and coffeehouses, on the other hand, generally offer
access in partnership with a provider that charges for the service. McDonald’s,
for example, in partnership with Wayport, is offering a nationwide plan in
which, for as little as $5.00 per month, you can get Wi-Fi with your Big Mac.
Cost of access without a monthly subscription to one of the providers’ plans
specializing in the hospitality industry can vary between $6 to $10 per day. A
few — very few — of the WISPs specializing in these venues offer service by
the hour. Because a stay at a hotel or motel is the exception rather than the
rule for those with homes on wheels and because only a few coffeehouses
and bake shops offer truck and RV parking, a long-term commitment to any of
their Wi-Fi providers is unlikely to make much sense.
Making the Connection
Getting logged on to a hotspot, no matter the provider or what the venue
might be, involves very similar steps. If you’re making the connection for the
first time, you need the following items:
 Wi-Fi-enabled device: You need either a laptop or palmtop with an inte-
grated wireless card or wireless adapter installed and working.
 Connection utility: You can use the WZC (which stands for Wireless
Zero Configuration) utility in Windows XP, the utility that comes with
your adapter, or a separate utility like JiWire SpotLock. (I tell you more
about this in the “Using connection management software” section later
in this chapter.)
 Credit card: To establish and pay for your new wireless account, you’re
asked to provide a credit card for nearly all but the free hotspots. Some
providers do, however, offer prepaid Wi-Fi cards — much like prepaid
phone cards — which include an account and personal identification
number that you can use instead of a credit card.
Using the WZC utility to connect
If you have these items in hand, you’re ready to get online. So boot up your
laptop and follow these steps:
1. If it doesn’t open automatically, start the WZC.
To start the wireless zero configuration utility, I usually choose Start➪
Control Panel➪Network and Internet Connections➪Network Connections
and right-click the connection for the wireless client. In the context
100
Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

menu that opens, click View Available Wireless Networks, as shown in
Figure 6-1.
Or, you can right-click the WZC computer icon in your system tray and
choose View Available Wireless Networks. Assuming you’re in range of
the hotspot, you see the SSID (the network or hotspot name) indicating
the strength and availability of the network.
Most providers use the same SSID at every hotspot they service. The
Flying J SSID, for example, is flyingj and the Coach Connect SSID is
coach. When you connect to one of these networks for the first time,
you create a new profile that is saved by the WZC or alternate connec-
tion utility. (See, later in this chapter, the “Using connection manage-
ment software” section for more information.)
2. Select the SSID of the appropriate hotspot, and click Connect.
After a few internal computer gymnastics, you’re now connected to the
hotspot but you’re not yet connected to the Internet.
3. Now you can close or minimize the connection window, shown in
Figure 6-2, and open your browser.
Before you move on to the “Setting up an account” section, read the last
two paragraphs of this section.
Figure 6-1:
Launching
the wireless
zero con-
figuration
utility.
101
Chapter 6: Using Truck — and RV — Friendly Hotspots

When you’re making a new connection, no matter the utility you’re using, it’s
important, for security reasons that I cover in Chapter 10, to configure your
connection so that you don’t make an automatic connection to an available
network. Whenever you’re making a connection, especially for the first time,
your connection management utility either assumes you want to make this
connection automatically, as in the case of the WZC, or offers the option of
saving a connection profile that connects automatically or prompts you to
connect.
In Chapter 10, where I discus disallowing automatic connections, I tell you
how to configure the WZC to show the SSID rather than automatically con-
nect and, in the next section, I tell you how to configure a utility like JiWire
SpotLock so that automatic connections are avoided.
Using connection management software
If you’ve skipped to this section, I assume you’ve installed (and want to use)
either the connection management utility that comes with your wireless
adapter or a utility like JiWire SpotLock. I happen to like JiWire SpotLock
because of its security features (more about this in Chapter 10 where I also
discuss using a Virtual Private Network, or VPN) but the choice is yours.
Either way, you should have already disabled the WZC, as I discuss in
Chapter 4 (if not, turn to that chapter for directions and do so).
Figure 6-2:
As you can
see, the

quite good,
and I’m now

102
Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

If you’re using the JiWire SpotLock connection utility to connect to an unse-
cured hotspot, for example, here’s how you connect:
1. Open the utility window, select and highlight the appropriate SSID,
and click Connect.
Once the new connection’s made, several Connection Wizard screens
open, allowing you to create a hotspot connection profile.
2. In the first dialog box, select the Use My Own VPN or No Security
option. Click Next.
Even if you subscribe to the JiWire SpotLock service, as I do, you want
to select this option. (It’s not necessary to enter your username and
password here unless you’re giving the SpotLock service a trial run.)
3. In this, the second dialog box, even though it seems counterintuitive,
select the Use No Security option radio button. Click Next.
After you’ve completed these steps, set up (or logged on to) your
hotspot account, and connected to the Internet, you can then start
either your own VPN or the JiWire SpotLock VPN service. I tell you how
to start SpotLock in “Getting logged on” later in this chapter.
4. Unless you have Internet Explorer set to connect exclusively through
a corporate VPN proxy server, you can ignore this Internet Explorer
Proxy Settings dialog box. Click Next.
If, however, you’ve configured IE to connect through a VPN proxy server
you can put a check mark in this box when you’re using JiWire SpotLock
rather than your VPN.
5. When the Application Launch Settings dialog box appears, click Next.
You can use this feature to start applications that don’t require an
Internet connection, but because no Internet connection is established
until after you’re logged onto the network, it’s best to avoid starting, for
example, a browser or e-mail client upon connection to the hotspot.
6. When the Save Network Profile dialog box appears, select the Save,
But Prompt Me to Connect option, and you’re done configuring the
connection profile. Click Finish.
With that chore out of the way, you can close or minimize your connection
management utility. If this is the first time you’ve connected to this hotspot,
you need to set up an account; if you’ve been here before, log on.
Open your browser and you can move on to the next section.
103
Chapter 6: Using Truck — and RV — Friendly Hotspots

Setting up an account
Depending on what hotspot you’re logging on to, the order of events when
setting up a new account varies. Most of them require the same kind of infor-
mation, but they all have their own unique way of getting it. You can count on
providing your name, complete address, phone number, and e-mail address.
It’s likely that this is the first information you’re asked to provide.
After you provide the requested information to set up an account, what you
do next depends on the hotspot. At some point, you’re asked to provide your
credit card information or your prepaid card number and PIN, and you’re also
asked to set up a username and password.
When you’re signing up for service at a Flying J, for example, they offer you
the option of letting them choose, at random, a username and password. This
is a handy feature that helps ensure that no one else shares, or is likely to
guess, your account ID, but if you choose this option, make sure you write the
information down. These randomly generated IDs aren’t easy to remember.
If you need to contact either customer or technical support for the hotspot
you’re using (for any reason), you must have your username and password
available so that support staff can identify you in their system.
Getting logged on
After all the information is gathered, and you’ve verified it, you see somewhere
on the screen a button or link that says something like Sign me up! or Create
account. Click it, and — depending on the hotspot you’re logging on to — you
see one of the following: a welcome screen directing you to click a link to be
connected to the Internet, a welcome screen indicating that you are con-
nected to the Internet, or a logon screen.
At Flying J, for example, after the account’s set up, you’re asked to log on.
Then a dialog box appears, giving you the opportunity to get on the Internet
or manage your account. This dialog box normally appears after every log on
so that, in case you have a monthly or annual account you need to access,
you can do so easily and securely. When you choose to get online, you then
see an activation screen, followed by a “connected” screen. From here, you
can start your VPN service.
When you’re connected to the Internet, most hotspots serve up a secure
screen indicating that you’re connected to the Internet. If you use a corporate
VPN or a public VPN like SpotLock, you can now start the service. (I tell you
about VPNs in Chapter 10.)
104
Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

After you’ve made the connection, enabling SpotLock security is easy. If the
utility’s not currently open, right-click the JiWire icon and click JiWire SpotLock
at the top of the menu. The utility opens. Click the Secure tab, and assuming
your username is already entered in the JiWire ID field, enter your password.
Click Activate. Once the VPN is established you notice, in the upper right
corner, that security is assigned to JiWire SpotLock and a gold lock icon is
exhibited. To discontinue the SpotLock VPN, simply enter your username and
password, and click Deactivate, as shown in Figure 6-3.
Being a good neighbor
Whenever you’re using a hotspot, you’re sharing a network with several
other users. Each hotspot has — depending on the type of Internet connec-
tion in use — a limited amount of bandwidth available. If everyone sharing
the bandwidth decides to download music or video files or e-mail a bunch of
large picture files to friends and family all at the same time, the connection
becomes as slow as molasses for everyone. If you plan on downloading a lot
of music or video, you might want to consider doing so from your home or
office to avoid using massive bandwidth at the hotspot.
Figure 6-3:
I’m feeling
well
protected

105
Chapter 6: Using Truck — and RV — Friendly Hotspots

If you need to e-mail large files, consider doing so later in the evening when
the bandwidth won’t be filled with so many users. If e-mailing large files is
something you do on a regular basis, you might want to consider using a soft-
ware application like SendLater by 4Team Corporation. You can find out more
about it at http://sendlater.4team.biz.
Troubleshooting Your Connection
I’ve spent most of my life living in states where, in the winter, the temperature
dips well below zero, and the frozen ground is covered with snow and ice. In
the ’80s, after having purchased a new home, I figured I should get a dog to 
go with it. Cisco was a good companion, but he acquired the annoying (and
sometimes dangerous) habit of chewing on electrical wires. I’d fixed several,
and one frosty Sunday morning when I woke to a rapidly falling inside temper-
ature of 42 degrees, I figured the furnace wiring had been Cisco’s latest victim.
Looking high and low, I failed to find any wires that had been mistaken as
chew toys, so not wanting the indoor temperature to match the subzero out-
door temp, I called the gas company for emergency service. The guy showed
up promptly, and in about two seconds, the furnace was humming along,
warming my abode. I paid him double for the Sunday service call, and vowed
I’d never again call for help until I’d checked to see if the switch was on.
Sometimes troubleshooting is that simple. Sometimes it’s not. After spending
some time discussing with help desk and support staff supervisors their
most common problems and the solutions to them, I’ve come up with this
troubleshooting guide. After you complete each task, make an attempt to
establish a connection with the hotspot. If you’re successful then, great,
you’re done; if not then go on to the next task. If you get to the end and you
still can’t make a connection then, finally, call the support staff. Make sure
you tell them what you’ve already done so you don’t have to repeat steps.
Identifying global issues
Several situations, either alone or in some combination, can cause difficulties
for hotspot users. You can overcome some of them easily and immediately.
On the other hand, solving some of these issues requires a little more effort
and time. A few of the common issues facing hotspot users are the following:
 Weak wireless cards or adapters: I talk about adapting your laptop or
PDA for wireless in Chapter 3. Although manufacturers have made many
improvements, some internally integrated cards and many standard
wireless adapters lack the power and antenna sensitivity to make a solid
connection when you’re parked in an RV site or truck stop lot. Seriously
106
Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

consider using a high-power adapter even if you have an integrated wire-
less solution. A few other related issues are
• Mixing USB standards: For example, if you have a USB 1.1 port on
your laptop, connecting a USB 2.0 adapter will slow things down. 
If you’re using a USB adapter, make every effort to match the 
standards.
• Using outdated drivers: Check for driver updates as soon as you
install your adapter. The setup CD that came with the adapter
might not be the most recent release. Other times, a driver prob-
lem is due to the initial installation, so if you’re having problems,
try uninstalling and reinstalling the adapter. You might have to use
System Restore to reset your laptop to a time prior to the first
installation of your card and drivers.
• Trying a different adapter: If the adapter you’re using doesn’t seem
to be getting the job done, try a different type or brand. I don’t
know why this works, but sometimes, it does. An adapter that
works great in one laptop sometimes just doesn’t cut it in another
one, even if they’re the same brand and model.
 Line of sight: There might be nothing you can do about this. If you’re in
the last available RV site or truck stop parking slot, what can you do?
Well, if you’re using an external antenna (see Chapter 3), try moving the
antenna around a bit. Sometimes you only need to move it a foot or two
one way or another.
 Operating system: Windows XP is far superior to all the previous Windows
iterations when it comes to using hotspots. Consider upgrading if you’re
having repeated problems related to early Windows systems.
 Proxy servers: If you use a corporate VPN or a private VPN service like
JiWire (more about this in Chapter 10), be sure to disable it until a con-
nection to the Internet is established.
 Firewall settings: This is especially relevant if you’ve just installed a
new firewall. If you’re using a firewall other than the one included in
Windows XP, make sure you disable the Windows firewall. You might
also need to disable the firewall to establish a connection to the
Internet. After the connection is made, you can once again enable the
firewall See Chapter 10 for more information.
Checking the simple stuff
I imagine you already have a good idea that the first thing you need to do is
check the following:
 Be sure everything’s turned on: It sounds simplistic, but before you call
for support, make sure that your wireless adapter is connected. If it’s a
107
Chapter 6: Using Truck — and RV — Friendly Hotspots

PC card, push it in to be sure it’s making a good connection, and if it’s a
USB adapter, make sure it’s plugged in. If you use an integrated wireless
card, be sure it’s on.
 Check your Wi-Fi card status: To make sure your wireless card is working
properly — whether it’s integrated, PC card, or USB — follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Performance and Maintenance➪
System.
The System Properties dialog box opens.
2. Click the Hardware tab, and click the Device Manager button.
The Device Manager window opens.
3. In the Network Adapters area of the Device Manager window,
find your wireless solution, and right-click it. If the device shows
a red X through the icon, click Enable. If the device icon appears
normal, click Properties, as shown in Figure 6-4.
The device’s Properties dialog box opens.
4. Click the General tab, and in the Device Status area, you see
whether the device is working properly or not.
If your device isn’t working properly, you can choose to fire up the trouble-
shooter, but personally, I recommend you call the manufacturer’s support
staff.
Figure 6-4:
Find your
wireless
solution in
the Device
Manager
window.
108
Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

Okay, you know everything’s turned on so, if everything checks out, and you
don’t need to make any adjustments or changes, you can move on to other
troubleshooting tasks. If you did find anything amiss, make your adjustments
accordingly.
Releasing and renewing your IP address
I suppose it’s possible that, even though I advised you in Chapter 3 to install
Windows XP, you’re still using Windows 98, SE, or ME. If that’s the case, I have
it on good authority that one of the most common of all problems stems from
issues surrounding Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). DHCP,
among other things, allows a new computer to be added to a network without
assigning it a unique IP address. Your laptop might be stuck on stupid.
To repair this problem in Windows 98, SE or ME, choose Start➪Run and type
winipcfg in the Open text entry field. Click OK. The IP Configuration dialog
box opens. Make sure your wireless device appears in the window. If it doesn’t,
select it from the drop-down menu. Click Release and, after the little hourglass
icon changes back into a cursor arrow, click Renew. You see the IP address
change and, again, after the hourglass turns into a cursor arrow, click OK.
If you’re now able to make the connection, remember this solution because,
with these older operating systems, this problem apparently occurs quite 
frequently.
Getting the “Page cannot 
be displayed” message
You say the page won’t display, and you can’t log on? You’re connected to the
network, but not to the Net? And you restart your browser, but the browser’s
still stuck? Is that what’s troubling you, Bunky? Don’t give up the ship; I’ve
got a possible solution.
With the annoying message appearing in your browser, follow these steps:
1. In Internet Explorer, click Tools➪Internet Options.
The Internet Options dialog box opens.
If you use a browser other than Internet Explorer, you can accomplish
this same task through the Control Panel. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪
Network and Internet Connections➪Internet Options.
2. Click the Connections tab, shown in Figure 6-5.
109
Chapter 6: Using Truck — and RV — Friendly Hotspots

3. Click the LAN Settings button.
The Local Area Network (LAN) Settings dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 6-6.
4. Select the Automatically Detect Settings check box. Click OK in both
the open dialog boxes.
5. Restart the browser.
A couple of other issues to consider are
 Browser caching: If your browser has cached the last page you visited
online, it might be trying to present that page. Try refreshing the
browser a couple of times and restarting it.

Configuring TCP/IP to use DNS
Say what? Fortunately, you don’t need to understand acronyms such as TCP/IP
and DNS to perform the task — and I’m not sure I can explain it anyway. So I
won’t try. I’ll just give you instructions for doing it. There aren’t any tell-tale
symptoms or error messages indicating a problem; it’s just another step in
the process of elimination. If you’re using Windows XP (or Windows 2000),
follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Network and Internet Connections➪
Network Connections.
The Network Connections window opens.
2. Right-click your connection, and click Properties. (Refer to Figure 6-7.)
The Wireless Network Connection Properties dialog box opens.
3. Click the General tab.
Scroll down in the This Connection Uses the Following Items list.
4. Select the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) check box if it doesn’t have a

Eliminating conflicts
If you’ve tried the previous troubleshooting tips and still can’t connect to a
hotspot, there could be a conflict between the wireless zero configuration
utility and another connection management utility installed on your laptop.
This conflict can occur if you haven’t disabled the WZC. (I tell you how to dis-
able the WZC in Chapter 4.)
First, check to make sure that the WZC is disabled. If it’s not, disable it, and
attempt to make your connection. If that works, great — you’re done. If it
doesn’t work, you need to be sure that no possibility of conflict exists. To do
so, you need to exit (if you’re using JiWire) or uninstall (if you’re using the
utility that came with your adapter) any connection configuration or manage-
ment utility and enable the WZC.
Even if you’re not using the connection configuration or management utility that
came with your wireless adapter, if it’s installed, it can still cause a conflict.
Follow these steps to uninstall any connection utilities currently installed on
your laptop. (If you later want to reinstall them, you’ll need the setup disks
that came with your cards.)
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Add or Remove Programs.
The Add or Remove Program dialog box opens.
2. Scroll through the list to find the appropriate program, and click it.
The information box is highlighted.
3. Click Change/Remove.
If the wizard opens, follow the prompts. Otherwise, after the program
has completed the uninstall process, you can close the window and
restart your laptop.
112
Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

At this point, any conflict that might have existed has been eliminated — but
if the WZC doesn’t resume its network-configuration duty, take the following
steps:
1. Enable the WZC by following the steps outlined in Chapter 4.
2. Set the WZC to Use Windows to Configure My Wireless Network
Settings by completing the steps shown here:
a. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Network and Internet
Connections➪Network Connections.
The Network Connections window opens.
b. Right-click your connection, and click Properties. (Refer to Figure 6-1.)
The Wireless Network Connection Properties dialog box opens.
c. Click the Wireless Networks tab.
d. Make sure a check mark appears in the Use Windows to Configure
My Wireless Network Settings check box.
You can now make another attempt to establish a connection to the hotspot.
If you’re successful and you were previously using a utility other than JiWire,
reinstallation of that utility is ill advised. However, if you were using JiWire,
you should call their support staff — especially if you’d like to use the
SpotLock VPN.
If you’ve gone through this entire troubleshooting section and you still can’t
make a connection, it’s time to call for help. Some help desk personnel go
through a scripted list, so you might end up repeating some of these trou-
bleshooting tasks. Others, like Flying J Communications, actually listen to
you, so tell the person you’re speaking with the steps you’ve already taken so
that they can focus on other potential solutions.
Using E-Mail at a Hotspot
When I bought my first laptop to take on the road with me, I didn’t know what
all I’d do with it, but sending e-mail was of primary importance. In fact, it was
the only thing that I knew, for sure, that I wanted to use a laptop for. Unfortu-
nately, even when I used a dialup service, sending e-mail successfully was a
hit-or-miss proposition. I finally hooked up with a prepaid dialup ISP that
solved the problem, but it was frustrating until I did.
Similarly frustrating situations can occur when you’re using a hotspot. Although
I’ve encountered no problems when using any of the major truck stop hotspots,
113
Chapter 6: Using Truck — and RV — Friendly Hotspots

I have had a problem or two in hotels, coffeehouses, and RV parks. To make
matters even more confusing, these problems don’t always have the same
root cause, and therefore, the solutions can differ.
Receiving e-mail, for the most part, isn’t a problem at a hotspot. Sending
e-mail is what, on occasion, can be a little bit more than frustrating. The pri-
mary, although not exclusive, reason is spam. Not the gourmet delight made
by the fine folks in Austin, Minnesota, but rather, the irritating advertise-
ments and solicitations that seem to constantly and repeatedly fill everyone’s
e-mail inbox. What does spam have to do with your inability to send e-mail
from a hotspot location? Well, some of the methods those ISPs, WISPs, and
hotspot operators use in an attempt to battle spam make it difficult for every-
one to send e-mail.
Exploring your options
Fortunately, if you find yourself at a hotspot battling spam by blocking outgo-
ing e-mail, you’re not without options. I’m not particularly crazy about all of
them. But there are perfectly viable solutions to the problem of sending
e-mail, from hotspots that block it, that work every time and others that have
to be tailor-made to each situation. Some of your options are to
 Use Web mail: Most ISPs offer a Web-based mail client that bypasses all
the restrictions because you’re connecting via the Web. You can also use
a free Web mail service like Yahoo!, Hotmail, or Gmail.
 Use a VPN: By using a corporate VPN or a private VPN service like
JiWire SpotLock, you bypass all attempts a hotspot might make to block,
redirect, intercept, or place restrictions on sending e-mail from their
location. Because the e-mail’s being forwarded, your ISP’s server isn’t
involved either.
 Use e-mail forwarding: Several Web-based companies, like SMTP.com
and mail2web.com, offer relatively inexpensive e-mail forwarding ser-
vices. You might have to do some reconfiguration of your e-mail client,
but after it’s done, you should experience no other problems sending
e-mail — the one possible exception being a WISP that requires using
their server to send e-mail. See the next item.
 Reconfigure your e-mail client: This works only if the WISP requires
you to use their server. In that case, you can change your SMTP server
name to that of the WISP you’re using. (Later, in the “Configuring an
e-mail client” section, I show you how to do that in Outlook Express.)
Because I use JiWire’s SpotLock service, I don’t have any problems sending
e-mail, but there could be a problem in receiving a reply. JiWire forwards
114
Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

e-mail from their proxy server so, even though it’s unlikely anyone will notice
it, the original From address gets changed to username@jiwire-member.com.
The Reply address is the user’s normal e-mail address, though, so, providing
that the recipient just uses the Reply button on their e-mail client, the reply goes
directly to the original sender. Most mail forwarding services, because you’re
only using their SMTP server, won’t change your From address.
Comparing a few free Web mail services
I use Web-based e-mail accounts when I don’t want my primary e-mail
address to be publicly available. For example, anytime I signed up to post to
a forum or want to have some information e-mailed to me, I use a Hotmail
address (www.hotmail.com). But until recently, I haven’t been too high on
the idea of using Web-based e-mail.
With serious competition from Google’s Gmail (http://gmail.google.com),
both Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) and Hotmail have made some improvements,
although the improvements to Hotmail seem to have skipped over their free
e-mail service and are available only in paid versions. In Table 6-2, I give you a
quick comparison of the major features for these three services.

10MB of storage space, however, with their free accounts. The paid ver-
sions they offer have plenty of features, and the Web interface gets rave
reviews. Find out more at www.fastmail.fm.
 AIM Mail: 2GB of storage and, at least as far as the experts are con-
cerned, very good spam filtering are two reasons you might want to look
into AOL’s free AIM Mail service. You can find them on the Web at
http://mail.aim.com.
 Inbox.com: With a name like that, at the very least, you should give
them a look. They offer 2GB of storage. and you can use their search
function to find any e-mails you might have misplaced. Not surprisingly
their Web address is www.inbox.com.

Configuring an e-mail client
Even if you’re going to use a Web-based mail service, you can, in some cases,
also use a desktop e-mail client like Microsoft Outlook Express or Mozilla
Thunderbird. Before you set about the task of configuring your client, you
need to gather just a bit of information. All this information is readily avail-
able from your ISP, WISP, or e-mail provider. Just ask them for e-mail client
configuration information. Here’s some advice on collecting that information:
 Username or account name: Your ISP assigns you an account or user-
name. In some cases, your entire e-mail address serves as your account
name or username.
 Password: This is the password you use to access your e-mail account.
 Incoming server: Usually, the name of the incoming server is something
like mail.myisp.com or pop.myisp.com, but whatever it is, your ISP
can provide it to you.
 SMTP server: Again, most likely it’s something similar to smtp.
myisp.com.
 Mail ports: You need to know the mail, or POP, and SMTP ports your ISP
listens on. Usually, it’s port 25, but as in the case of Gmail or SMTP.com,
it can be different.
 Secure Password Authentication: You also need to find out whether
your ISP requires a secure password authentication log on. This require-
ment is becoming very common.
Because you can configure Gmail for POP3 access, I’ll show you how to config-
ure Outlook Express to download and send e-mail through your Gmail account.
Gmail uses an SMTP port other than the troublesome port 25 that hotspots
are fond of redirecting or blocking altogether. Because of that, and because it’s
free, it’s a great candidate for use as your main e-mail provider while traveling.
The first thing you need to do is configure Gmail to use Post Office Protocol
(POP). To do so follow these steps:
1. From any Gmail page, click Settings.
The Mail Settings window opens.
2. Click the Forwarding and POP tab.
The Forwarding and POP configuration window opens.
117
Chapter 6: Using Truck — and RV — Friendly Hotspots

3. In the POP Download area, select either Enable POP for All Mail or
Enable POP Only for Mail That Arrives from Now On.
If you choose to Enable POP for All Mail, you can download any or all the
mail currently in your Gmail account to your e-mail client. Otherwise,
you can download only new mail.
4. From the drop-down list, decide what action Gmail should take When
Messages Are Accessed with POP.
5. Click the Save Changes button.
Now you can configure your desktop e-mail client. I show you, as an example,
how to configure Outlook Express.
1. After opening Outlook Express, choose Tools➪Accounts.
The Internet Accounts dialog box opens.
2. Click the Mail tab, and select Add➪Mail.
The Internet Connection Wizard opens.
3. Type the name you want displayed to e-mail recipients in the text
field, and click Next.
4. Enter your complete e-mail address in the text field. Click Next.
5. Make sure that POP3 is selected in the My Incoming Mail Server Is A
drop-down list at the top of the dialog box. Type pop.gmail.com in the
Incoming Mail Server text field, and then type smtp.gmail.com in the
Outgoing Mail Server text field. (See Figure 6-8.) Click Next.
Figure 6-8:
Entering the

names.
118
Part II: Surfing the Net Unplugged 

6. Enter your Account name and Password in the proper text fields. Be
sure that the Remember Password check box is enabled.
In the case of Gmail, the account name is your full e-mail address. Other
e-mail accounts might require only your username.
7. Click Next, and then click Finish.
But you’re not quite finished yet.
8. In the Internet Accounts dialog box, which has remained open, click
the Gmail account to highlight it, and click Properties.
The Pop.gmail.com Properties dialog box opens.
9. Click the Servers tab. Put a check mark in the check box next to My
Server Requires Authentication, as shown in Figure 6-9.
10. Click the Advanced tab. In the Server Port Numbers area, type 465 in
the Outgoing Mail (SMTP) text box. In the Incoming Mail (POP3) text
box, type 995. Be sure that both check boxes for This Server Requires
a Secure Connection (SSL) are enabled, as shown in Figure 6-10.
Not every e-mail server, either incoming or outgoing, requires authenti-
cation, so be sure to check with your ISP, WISP, or e-mail service to con-
firm. Most SMTP servers use port 25, and for this reason, most e-mail
clients default to port 25. You’ll have to check to find out on which port
your server listens.

If you need to alter the SMTP settings to conform to the requirements of a par-
ticular hotspot, do it from the account Properties dialog box. Simply highlight
the account under the Mail tab, click Properties, click the Servers tab, and make
the appropriate changes to the Outgoing mail (SMTP) field. Be sure to double-
check that you’re using the proper incoming and outgoing ports as well.

cover a few of the methods you might want to employ
to connect to the Internet when, during your travels,
Wi-Fi just isn’t available. Here, for example, you find out
about cellular data services (Chapter 7), using dialup as a
backup (Chapter 8), and satellite Internet systems (Chap-
ter 9). After perusing this part, you might even decide that
a satellite or cellular Internet connection would be perfect
as your primary means of making a connection. The sock
puppets (being big RV aficionados) are very excited by the
prospect of setting up a satellite Internet system — and
you might be equally excited by the prospect of using a
cellular data service to get connected without the need
for a hotspot.

M
y first foray into the world of wireless Internet connectivity involved
using my cellphone connected to a PC card modem with a dialup a
connection. This worked, but it was painfully slow — much slower than a 
regular dialup connection. And, on top of that, I was burning up cellphone
antennas at an alarming rate.
There have been, since that time, remarkable strides forward in cellular data
technology, and now by using a cell data card, you can get a connection for
your laptop that rivals speeds seen at Wi-Fi hotspots. Even using a cellphone
as a modem, tethered by cable or Bluetooth to your laptop or PDA (I explain
all this within the chapter), can be considerably quicker and less threatening
to the life of the phone than standard dialup.
In this chapter, I help you explore the cellular possibilities and decide, first of
all, whether you want to use a cell data card or cellphone to connect your
computer to the Internet. And secondly, I help you choose a carrier that fits
your needs. With all those details behind you, I get down to the nitty gritty
and tell you how to set up your connections.

Choosing Your Tools
Every so often while traveling around the country, I pick up my cellphone in
some remote location, and to my amazement, find that I have a signal.
Sometimes it’s pretty weak — nonetheless, there it is. But, as anyone with a
cellphone and a will to wander will no doubt tell you, sometimes the signal-
free zones are just as baffling.
In general, though, it seems that having a good strong signal is far more
common than not, and that’s what makes the idea of using this technology
for Internet access so attractive. If you find yourself considering the cellular
option, one of your first choices is between using a cell data card or cell-
phone for connecting your computer to the Internet. Consider the following
when making your decision:
 Cell data card: The simplest way to use a cellular service is with a data
card, but it can also be the most expensive. A few general attributes of
the data card are:
• Fast: The highest-speed cellular services, offering speeds rivaling
802.11b, favor the use of a dedicated data card.
• Simple: Setup is almost exactly the same as a PC card wireless
adapter: Slide the data card into a PCMCIA slot, install the soft-
ware, and you’re surfin’ the Net before you know it.
• Expensive: Data cards are far more expensive than wireless PC 
card adapters, and of course, you still need to have a cellphone to
make calls.
 High-speed cellphone: Because you probably already own a cellphone,
this might seem like the easiest choice. But first, the phone must be data
capable, and second, your carrier must support data transmission for
your phone. A few attributes tell the story; data-capable phones are
• Fast: 3G (third generation) cellphones support high-speed technol-
ogy. If you choose to use a cellphone, you should strongly consider
upgrading your phone to take advantage of the maximum speeds
offered by your cellular provider.
• Complex: Although there are some fairly easy ways to set up your
cellphone for Internet access, it’s still more complex than installing
a data card.
• Inexpensive: This is true especially if you already own a cellphone
that’s data capable. Even if you don’t, though, it’s likely to be
cheaper to get a new cellphone through your cellular provider
than it is to purchase a data card.
124
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

Which will it be — data card 
or cellphone?
I’ve been spoiled by the speed of wireless broadband Internet access. The
excitement and anticipation of watching a Web page slowly manifest itself 
on my display screen has been replaced by the wonder of browsing through
the World Wide Web as easily as I might thumb through a well-worn book.
Recently, cellular technology has begun to offer speeds rivaling those available
at hotspots, and even when the high-speed networks are out of range, you can
usually connect to a network that’s at least as fast as dialup — usually quite a
bit faster.
But which method of accessing those networks best meets your needs? Should
you set your cellphone up as a modem and use it to access the high-speed net-
works, or should you purchase a dedicated cellular data card designed specifi-
cally for that purpose? Well, you’re the only one who can answer that question,
but consider these things when you’re trying to make the choice:
 Cost: The high-speed data plans favoring the use of a data card —
offered by Sprint, Cingular, Verizon and others — sets you back about
$60 to $80 per month in addition to the cost of the data card. You can,
though, pay little or nothing extra if you choose to use a high-speed cell-
phone and accept a slower, but better than dialup, connection speed.
 Commitment: If you use your cellphone for your connection, it’s possi-
ble, even likely, that no other contractual agreement is required, but if
you choose to use a data card, a separate contractual commitment is a
necessity.
 Consistency: The speeds achieved can vary wildly. Both cellphones and
data cards are capable of accessing the high-speed networks, so if you’re
in, for example, an urban area where high-speed offerings are available,
you might experience Wi-Fi–like surfing. But at the edges of urbanity or
in rural America, the speed you’ll see is anybody’s guess. If you choose
to use a cellphone but not the high-speed service, you can expect to see
speeds between 40 Kbps and 144 Kbps.
It seems to me that using a cellphone to make an Internet connection might
be best for the occasional surfing session but probably not something on
which you’d want to rely exclusively. On the other hand, even though sixty to
eighty bucks a month is nothing to sneeze at (you could sign up for two or
more annual truck stop Wi-Fi subscriptions for that price), it might be possi-
ble to use a data card and plan as your primary means of Internet access and
bridge that gap with the occasional Wi-Fi connection.
125
Chapter 7: Cellular Data Services: Can You Connect Me Now?

Choosing a carrier
In the contest to get your business, the first round of eliminations has been
taken care of for you because the pool of providers from which you can
choose is limited to those servicing the area you call home. After the identifi-
cation of potential players, you can take the following into consideration:
 Coverage: Most of the national carriers provide, on their Web sites, a
link to coverage maps. At the Sprint Web site, you can even see a cell
tower map. If your available choices include Verizon, Sprint, Cingular,
Alltel, or T-Mobile, you should find adequate coverage available. If you
limit your travels to a particular region, though, you might find a
regional carrier to be the preferable choice.
 Customer service: One way to judge this is by asking a few neighbors
and colleagues about their personal experiences with any carrier you’re
considering. You should also get a feel for a carrier’s responsiveness
when you’re shopping for a service. If they’re unresponsive when they’re
trying to get your business, how much more unresponsive might they be
when you’re under contract to them and having problems?
 Data capabilities: Even though the major and most of the minor cellular
providers have switched to digital voice transmission, not every carrier
provides digital data transmission. Make sure any carrier you’re consid-
ering offers digital data transmission.
 Data plans: A few carriers charge by the kilobit, some have limited-use
plans, some offer flat-rate, unlimited-use plans, and some offer all three.
(I talk more about data plans a little later in the chapter in the “Sorting
through the services” section.)
You’re going to be stuck with whatever carrier you choose for an extended
period of time, so take a little time to do some shopping around. Ask some
questions and demand decent answers. There’s nothing more frustrating
than dealing with a communications company that refuses to communicate.
Comparing speeds and standards
To begin with, there are two basic cellular technologies: global system for
mobile (better known as GSM) and code division multiple access (CDMA).
GSM and CDMA work just great for voice transmission, but because data’s a
different duck, other technology enhancements were necessary to allow for 
a decent Internet connection. Some carriers, like Verizon and Sprint, have
based their systems on the CDMA technology whereas others, like Cingular
and T-Mobile, use GSM. Tables 7-1 and 7-2 should help to sort the enhance-
ment standards.

example, you’ve signed up with Verizon for their BroadbandAccess package
and you leave the Ev-DO area, the speed you can achieve falls back to the
1xRTT standard.
Sorting through the services
Because it sometimes seems that cellular providers change plans and offerings
more often than the wind changes direction, it can make comparisons some-
what difficult. After you’ve whittled your list of cellular contenders into a short
list, you can begin to home in on your final choice by asking a few questions:
 Do I need a data plan? Most of the high-speed services are contracted
and billed separate from voice plans, but some of the slower-speed 
networks might be available without a separate data plan. Verizon, for
example, allows you to access its slower NationalAccess network using a
cellphone as a modem at no extra cost.
 Do I need a data card? Even though Ev-DO– and EDGE–enabled cell-
phones are available, some of the providers don’t offer the high-speed
services unless you have a data card.
127
Chapter 7: Cellular Data Services: Can You Connect Me Now?

 Will I be charged extra for roaming? Many of the providers offer several
levels of service, and some of those plans include the possibility of being
charged a roaming fee. Find out how much any roaming charges are.
 Are data plans available to business customers only? A few of the
providers make their data plans available, primarily, to business cus-
tomers. Although this might not impact cost, it might affect your con-
tractual commitment.
 Do you have phone connection hardware available? Having hardware
available is an indication that using a cellphone as a modem is well sup-
ported. Not having it, however, isn’t necessarily a negative indicator, and
several vendors sell complete kits and individual data cables.
 Do you have phone connection software available? Most of the data
cards, especially when purchased through the provider, come with a
connection management utility that helps in managing connection pro-
files for both cellular and Wi-Fi. Ask if this software is also available for
use with your cellphone modem.
Many of the cellular carriers offer lower-cost data plans that limit the amount
you can download from the Internet. If your use falls within these bounds,
you can save a few bucks, but charges can get expensive in a hurry if you go
over your limits. Just to give you an idea, the average Web page runs any-
where from 30K to 75K. Some are a little smaller, and some are much larger.
But, for example, if you’ve got a 5MB plan, you’d probably be able to browse
somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 Web pages, and maybe get a bit of
e-mail, before you run out of allotment.
Connecting with a Cell Data Card
The attraction, for me, to using a cell data card rather than a cellphone for
making an Internet connection is the simplicity — possibly because of the
similarity to using a hotspot. In fact, it might be simpler. All the cellular
providers offering service through a data card also offer a connection man-
agement utility, similar to the WZC or JiWire utility, and you don’t have to be
anywhere near a hotspot to use it.
My primary complaints are speed and cost. The high-speed services are lim-
ited to urban areas, and I usually find myself, at best, near the edges of the
coverage. Because of this, I’m often relegated to the slower-speed services
which, although generally faster than dialup, are much slower than I can get
at a hotspot. But that’s just me. I don’t like paying for something I’m rarely
able to use. I do it sometimes; I just don’t like it.

Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

However, you might find yourself, more often than not, with a decent cellular
signal and not a truck– or RV–friendly hotspot in sight. In that case, even
though the speeds might barely hover above those of dialup, a data card and
plan could be the perfect solution.
Making the hardware choice
Shopping for a data card, such as the one shown in Figure 7-1, isn’t much dif-
ferent than shopping for a cellphone. For example, it’s entirely possible to
purchase a cellular data card from your local CompuMart or online discount
retailer, but as is the case with cellphones, these cards are frequently avail-
able from the cellular provider at a deep discount when you sign a long-term
contract.
If you choose to purchase your card from a source other than your cellular
provider, you must still be certain that the card you purchase is compatible
with your chosen carrier and the standard they support. Table 7-3 notes what
cards are compatible with various, popular carriers.

Chapter 7: Cellular Data Services: Can You Connect Me Now?

For more information regarding data cards compatible with Sprint and Verizon
services along with some Ev-DO-specific tips, advice, and information, I’ve
found the Web site EVDOinfo.com to be invaluable. As a matter of fact, if you
purchase your data card through their sister site, Booster-Antenna.com,
they’ll supplement the support you receive from your carrier. They can be
found by pointing your browser to www.evdoinfo.com.
I strongly suggest that you avoid purchasing a used data card. If the card was
originally purchased through a cellular provider, it’s almost certain to be pro-
grammed specifically, and exclusively, for that carrier. Beyond that, if it is a
Sprint card or you want to use Sprint service, you should be aware that their
frequency is incompatible with those of other carriers.
A few of the cellular data cards, like the Sony Ericsson GC89, are capable of
switching between both cellular and Wi-Fi networks — so you can use the
card with your phone or to connect at a hotspot. If this is important to you,
be sure you ask about it prior to purchasing the card.
Recently, laptops that include integrated cellular data cards as well as inte-
grated Wi-Fi cards have appeared on the market, but I don’t recommend them.
To use the built-in data card, you need to contract for the services, and unlike
Wi-Fi, your choice of service is limited to a single cellular carrier. For example,
if you purchase a Sony Vaio VGN-T350 equipped with a GPRS/EDGE card, you
need to sign up with Cingular for service. Although having a data card inte-
grated into a laptop is more than a little convenient, I don’t like the idea of
being stuck with the same cellular carrier for as long as my laptop should last
(my first one lasted 8 years). Also, you can’t swap out integrated cards for
newer technology, so if the integrated card can’t access a new feature, you
won’t be able to access that feature for the life of your laptop.

Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

Setting up a data card
You install a data card in almost exactly the same way you install a wireless
adapter, with one major difference: activation. All cellphones and data cards
carry an Electronic Serial Number (ESN). Whenever you access the network, the
ESN is automatically transmitted so the cellular provider can confirm validity.
When you buy a data card and set up your account, the cellular provider
takes note of the ESN and adds it to its database so that your card is recog-
nized. During the software installation process (see the “Configuring the
card” section later in this chapter), the activation is complete when the
number is detected, transmitted, and recognized for the first time.
Installing the drivers and management utility
When you make your purchase, along with the card you get a CD that includes
the necessary card drivers and a connection management utility. Although the
installation methods vary somewhat from one card to another, three basic
steps seem to be universal. With the CD in hand, you’re ready to begin this
grueling process.
1. Insert CD.
The CD starts automatically, and the installation wizard opens.
2. Follow the prompts.
This varies from one card to another, but for the most part, you simply
need to read and agree to terms and click Next a few times.
3. Click Finish.
At this point, with the device drivers and connection management utility
successfully installed, you’re ready to configure the card (but not quite
ready to put it into the PCMCIA slot).
Configuring the card
Verizon’s VZAccess Manager is a bit more complex to configure than the
others — maybe because it’s such a useful utility — but the process is still
somewhat similar across the board.
Some of the connection management utilities, such as Verizon’s VZAccess
Manager, Sprint’s Power Vision Connection Manager, and the Cingular
Communication Manager, can also handle managing 802.11 wireless connec-
tions. If you use a PC card or USB wireless adapter, make sure you’ve got it
handy during the configuration of your connection management utility.
At some point, in almost every configuration process, you’re asked if you want
to check for updates. Because an update check is a good idea, I highly recom-
mend that you maintain an Internet connection throughout configuration.
131
Chapter 7: Cellular Data Services: Can You Connect Me Now?

Follow these steps to configure your Verizon data card with VZAccess:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪VZAccess Manager.
The setup wizard opens with the Welcome screen.
2. Click Check for Updates. If any are available, you can install them now.
3. Click Next.
The Wi-Fi/WWAN Detection dialog box opens.
4. You can select the Detect both Wi-Fi option or the WWAN or Detect
WWAN Device Only (1xEV-DO/1xRTT/CDMA) option, depending on
your preferences. If you’ve chosen the latter, click Next; if you’ve
chosen the former, follow these steps:
a. Insert your Wi-Fi adapter.
Note: You don’t need to do this if your wireless device is built in.
b. Click Next.
After the device is detected, the WWAN Device Detection dialog
box opens.
c. Remove your Wi-Fi adapter.
5. Click Next to open the Connectivity Options dialog box.
6. Select PC Card, and click Next to open the Find Wireless Device 
dialog box.
7. Insert your data card into the PCMCIA slot.
Windows recognizes it as a new device, and the Found New Hardware
Wizard launches.
8. Follow the prompts. If a Hardware Installation warning appears, click
Continue Anyway.
9. After the wizard completes the installation, click Next.
10. Enable the Run VZAccess Manager at Startup check box if you desire
it, and click Finish.
At this point, your card has been detected and is now configured for use. But
one last item, the Venturi compression client (which helps make your con-
nection more efficient), remains to be installed. Upon completing the configu-
ration process, the Venturi installation wizard automatically launches. Just
follow the prompts through to completion, and you’re ready to connect!
Every once in a while, software that helps a card access the Web, such as the
Venturi compression software, comes into conflict with a program applica-
tion or Web page. If most Web pages display normally but there’s that one
132
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

page that won’t load, try temporarily disabling the software. To do this, right-
click the software’s icon in the system tray and choose Open. For Venturi,
you then click the Off button under Venturi Mode to disable Venturi and
(assuming this solves the problem) click it again to return it to Auto.
If you happen to be downloading a compressed file, usually denoted by a
.zip extension, you should temporarily disable the Venturi, or any other,
compression client. Compressing a compressed file can actually increase the
time required for the download.
Logging on
Ready to use your data card? Here’s a rough idea of what you can expect,
again using Verizon’s VZAccess Manager as an example:
1. Double-click the VZAccess Manager icon to open the utility.
The Connect window opens and the available connection possibilities
are clearly displayed.
2. To log on, click your preferred connection, and after the Connect to
WWAN or Connect to WLAN button’s displayed, click that button.
With a connection established, the Connect to button changes to a
Disconnect button. If you want to change your connection type, you
need to disconnect and then go through the connection process again.
Connecting with Your Cellphone
For a long, long time my cab was a phone-free zone that provided refuge from
the busy outside world. All well and good, but every time I wanted or needed
to talk to someone, I had to get off the highway and make a time-consuming
stop so I could make the call. Now, with voice recognition and hands-free
technology, I can carry on a long-distance conversation as easily as I can talk
to a passenger. And, on top of that, I can also use a cellphone to connect my
laptop to the Internet. (No, not while I’m driving.)
If you want to use your cellphone to access the Internet, you need the following:
 Data-capable cellphone: Contact your cellular provider and ask whether
your phone is compatible for use with their data plans. This information
might also be available on your carrier’s Web site.
 Data plan: Most carriers require that you sign up for a data plan if you’re
going to use your phone as a modem. But check before you buy.
133
Chapter 7: Cellular Data Services: Can You Connect Me Now?

 Method of connection: To configure your cellphone for use as a modem,
you need to tether it to your computer. There are three ways to do this:
• Cable: This is by far the easiest and most widely accepted method
of tethering your phone to your computer. Verizon, T-Mobile, and
Alltel offer connection kits that include a USB cable and a CD
loaded with the necessary drivers and connection management
utility. For those carriers not offering their own kits, you can easily
find cable and driver kits available from several sources. (See the
next section for more information.)
• Bluetooth: This wireless technology is most often used as a cable
replacement. Some phones, however, even though they’re
Bluetooth equipped, can’t be tethered to a computer via Bluetooth
wireless. Check with your cellular provider to determine whether
you can use this feature. Your computer, of course, also needs
Bluetooth capability.
• Infrared: Otherwise known as IrDA, this is possibly the least attrac-
tive tethering method. IrDA’s range is only about three feet, and
you must maintain an absolutely unobstructed line of sight
between the phone and the computer’s IrDA sensor.
You also need answers to a few pertinent questions that I’ve outlined, earlier
in this chapter, in the “Sorting through the services” section. With acceptable
answers to these questions, you’re ready to set up your cellphone as a modem.
Making the connection via data cable
I just absolutely love being wire free, but at least when it comes to tethering a
cellphone to a computer, I prefer to use a data cable. That could be because,
first, my phone’s not equipped with either Bluetooth or IrDA capabilities, and
second, my carrier doesn’t allow Bluetooth tethering anyway. With only one
method remaining, I’ve prudently declared it my favorite.
Gathering the gear
Choose from one of two ways to go about setting up your cellphone as a
modem using a cable as the tethering device. In both instances, you need two
essential items:
 Data cable: The cable, depending on your phone, is either a USB or
serial cable. Cables are available from several sources, including online
retailers, cellphone manufacturers, and cellular providers.
 Device drivers: You can download most drivers from the Web, get them
from the CD included when you purchase your cable, or get them from
the CD that’s included with a complete kit.
134
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

You can find most cables sold individually or bundled in a complete kit that
includes the necessary drivers and, usually, a connection management utility
that might also offer features allowing you to sync your phone with your
laptop. Initially, I just bought a cable and downloaded the drivers. But I like
these kits — primarily because, at the time, no other method of downloading
the pictures I’d taken with my camera phone was available.
If you’re a real do-it-yourself kind of person — meaning you’re interested in
purchasing only the cable, you might try these sources:
 CellPhoneMall.Net: This is where I purchased the cable for my phone,
and as a bonus, I was also able to download the drivers, making it possi-
ble to set my phone up as a modem. You can find them on the Web at
www.cellphonemall.net. Scroll down to and click the Data Cable link.
The page that opens lists hundreds of cellphones with corresponding
cables and also provides a link for downloading the necessary drivers.
 CellularFactory.com: It’s not immediately apparent where the data
cables can be found, but if you scroll to the bottom of the page, you can
find a link for your make of phone. Using that, you can find all the acces-
sories available at the Cellular Factory for your phone. They’re found at
www.cellularfactory.com, and it’s highly likely that a CD including
drivers and maybe a few new ring tones is included.
Your other choice is to purchase a data kit that includes the proper cable,
device drivers, and very often, a connection management utility of some kind.
Chances are pretty good that your cellphone manufacturer has available —
somewhere on their Web site — a data kit for your phone, but a few other
possible sources for these goodies are:
 Verizon: Their connection kits (which are phone specific) are offered
under the Mobile Office moniker. They include a USB cable as well as a
couple of CDs for use in setting up the phone as a modem and installing
the VZAccess Manager. Finding the kits (or anything) on the Verizon 
Web site can be challenging, to say the least. Here’s a link to the Mobile
Office page that worked recently (www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/
mobileoptions/mobileoffice/mobileoffice1.jsp); if it’s moved,
give them a call.
 T-Mobile: In the Accessories area of their Web site (www.t-mobile.com),
find your phone, click the link, and a page with your phone’s available
accessories opens. Scroll to the Data section, and if your phone is sup-
ported, the kit is listed here. Most of these kits offered by T-Mobile are
also available from the manufacturer.
 DataPilot: The DataPilot Individual Kit includes a data cable and CD you
can use in setting up your cellphone as a modem. A lot of other handy
cellphone management features are included as well. You can find
DataPilot at www.datapilot.com.
135
Chapter 7: Cellular Data Services: Can You Connect Me Now?

 FutureDial: FutureDial doesn’t offer a kit, but from them, you can buy a
data cable and their SnapDialer software. If you’re contracted to Sprint,
Verizon, Cingular, or T-Mobile and you’re using a data-capable phone,
there’s a good chance that this combination will get you connected to the
Internet in a snap. FutureDial’s found on the Web at www.futuredial.
com/Default.aspx.
Other cellular providers, besides Verizon, might offer solutions to help you
get your cellphone set up as a modem. For example, from Cingular you can
purchase a data cable and download their Communication Manager, which
will, during installation and in collaboration with the Found New Hardware
Wizard, enable you to set up your phone for use as a modem. For more infor-
mation, check out their Phones as Modems Web page at www.cingular.
com/sbusiness/phonemodem.
Configuring your connection with a kit
If you’re using a complete kit or a third-party software solution, such as
Verizon’s Mobile Office or FutureDial’s SnapDialer, the necessary drivers are
installed from an included CD. During the software installation, the wizard
also takes you through the process of setting up and configuring your
modem. You might still, however, find you need to fill in a few blanks with
information specific to your cellular provider. In some cases the authentica-
tion process is, more or less, taken care of, but in other cases, you might
need to enter information such as:
 Phone number: These aren’t your usual phone numbers, so check with
your carrier for the proper string. Sprint, for example, might use #777
and Cingular might require *99#, *99***1#, or a variation on that theme.
 Username or ID: Check with your service provider for this information. It
might vary depending on the type of service for which you’ve contracted.
 Password: Make sure you find out from your carrier whether the pass-
word is case sensitive. Cingular, for one, requires the use of all capital
letters.
The installation and configuration process using VZAccess Manager is very
similar to that of a data card (see “Setting up a data card” earlier in this chap-
ter) except that you’re connecting to either a serial or USB device. After being
prompted to insert the data cable into the appropriate port, turn on your
phone, and the Windows Found New Hardware Wizard launches. Follow the
prompts, enter any required information, and when you’re finished, your cell-
phone is configured on your computer as a modem.
Your new connection is also set up, but you probably need to adjust the
modem port speed. So jog on over to the “Configuring port speed” section
later in this chapter for instructions.
136
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

Configuring a DIY connection with Windows
You can also choose the complete do-it-yourself (DIY) method of configuring
your cellphone as a modem and set up your own connection through
Windows XP. In this case, you’ve purchased a data cable compatible with
your phone and, of course, you’ve either found, and downloaded, the neces-
sary device drivers or you’ve been fortunate enough to have them included
on a CD with your cable.
If you download drivers from the Web, chances are good that they’re format-
ted in a .zip folder that includes drivers for several operating systems. I find
it easiest to create a new folder in My Documents named Drivers and extract
the drivers to that folder. In that way, I can find them easily when I need to
use them to set up the modem.
The steps involved in setting up your phone as a modem and establishing a
new connection are as follows:
1. Power up your cellphone, and connect the cable to your phone.
2. Connect the cable to your computer using whichever port, USB or
serial, is appropriate.
The Found New Hardware Wizard springs to life and appears before 
your eyes.
3. Select Install From A List Or Specific Location (Advanced) and 
click Next.
4. In the dialog box shown in Figure 7-2, do one of the following,
depending on where your drivers are located:
Figure 7-2:
Select an
option,
depending
on where

137
Chapter 7: Cellular Data Services: Can You Connect Me Now?

If you have a CD containing the drivers, select the Search Removable
Media check box, and click Next to proceed to Step 5.
If you’ve downloaded drivers, select the Include This Location In The
Search check box and click Browse. When the Browse For Folder dialog
box opens (Figure 7-3), scroll to the location to which you extracted the
drivers, select the appropriate driver, and click OK. Back in the Found
New Hardware Wizard, click Next to proceed to Step 5.
5. The chances are almost 100% that a warning from Microsoft, recom-
mending that you abandon any further attempts to install this soft-
ware, now appears. Smugly and confidently ignore the warning; click
Continue Anyway.
The installation status bar, complete with flying folders, opens — and
when it’s finished, it closes. Your computer’s still intact, and it appears
as though the warning was a bit overstated.
6. Click Finish. Still nothing explodes.
At this point, Windows recognizes your cellphone as a fully functional
modem. The final step is to create the connection, and for this, you need
some information from your cellular provider. (See “Configuring your connec-
tion with a kit” earlier in this chapter for the minimum list of information you
need to obtain.)
Follow these steps to create a new connection for your cellphone modem:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Network and Internet Connections➪Set
up or change your Internet connection.
The Internet Properties dialog box opens.
Figure 7-3:
Browse for
drivers you
downloaded
to your
computer.
138
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

2. Click the Connections tab, and click Setup.
The New Connection Wizard welcome screen opens.
3. Click Next to open the Network Connection Type dialog box.
4. Select Connect to the Internet, and click Next.
5. Select Set Up My Connection Manually, and click Next.
6. Select Connect Using A Dial-Up Modem, and click Next.
The Select a Device dialog box opens. If you’ve got an integrated modem
or you’ve previously installed a PC card modem, it’s listed here along
with your cellphone modem.
7. Deselect any other modems, select your cellphone modem, and 
click Next.
8. Enter the name of your cellular carrier or choose any other name for
the connection that you might like, and click Next.
9. Enter the phone number, provided to you by your cellular provider,
which must be dialed to connect to the cellular network, and click Next.
10. Enter the User name and Password provided to you by your cellular
provider. You also want to deselect the check box labeled Use This
Account Name And Password When Anyone Connects To The Internet
From This Computer, as well as the Make This The Default Internet
Connection check box.
11. Click Next.
And that’s it! Well, almost. Before you click Dial, you should check your
modem port speeds; they might need to be adjusted. You can find out
how to do that in the following section (“Configuring port speed”), and
after that’s done, you’re ready to dial.
The first time I set up my modem and connection, the connection didn’t
work. If this happens to you, try rebooting your phone. To do so, leave the
cable connected between your phone and computer, power down the phone,
count slowly to 20, and restart it. According to the support staffer that got
me up and running, this step resets the SIM card.
Configuring port speed
At this point, you might need to configure your port speeds. Often the
modem’s set up at 112 Kbps, but if you plan to use a high-speed network, you
have a definite need to increase port speed. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Network and Internet Connections➪
Network Connections.
The Network Connections screen opens.
139
Chapter 7: Cellular Data Services: Can You Connect Me Now?

2. Right-click the icon for your cellphone connection and select
Properties.
The Properties dialog box opens.
3. Select the General tab, and under the description of your modem,
click Configure.
The Modem Configuration dialog box opens.
4. From the Maximum Speed (bps) drop-down menu, select the appropri-
ate speed.
Recommended settings for the following standards are as follows:
• GPRS or CDMA standard: 230400 bps
• EDGE or 1xRTT standard: 460800 bps
• UTMS, HSDPA, or Ev-DO standard: 921600 bps
You don’t need to set the port settings every time you go from one net-
work to another. If, for example, you occasionally make an Ev-DO con-
nection but most often use a 1xRTT connection, your configuration
should be set to accommodate the high-speed network. (I introduce
standards in “Comparing speeds and standards” earlier in this chapter.)
5. Click OK to establish the settings, and close the dialog boxes.
At this point you’re ready to open the connection manager and log on to
the network.
Making the connection with Bluetooth
The most convenient of all possible tethering methods is Bluetooth — that is,
if your phone has the capability, if your computer has the capability, and if
your cellular provider allows it. Of those three conditions, only one — the
computer lacking Bluetooth capability — is easily remedied.
Vast numbers of Bluetooth adapters — easy remedies for computers lacking
this capability — are available from a wide variety of vendors, but if your
phone lacks Bluetooth, the only remedy is to replace the phone. And if your
carrier disallows Bluetooth tethering, you can either purchase controlling
interest in the company or switch providers — whichever you find easiest
and most expedient.
Assuming, however, that Bluetooth tethering is a possibility, you might want
to consider setting it up. Because this method of tethering requires no wired
connection, it’s extremely convenient. You can, if you choose, leave your
phone in a coat pocket or sitting on a shelf or hanging from the mirror. What
could be better?
140
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

Adapting a laptop or PDA for Bluetooth
It seems that no matter what technology might be missing from your laptop
or PDA there’s a method of adapting it for use. Such is the case with Bluetooth.
If you need to enable Bluetooth for your PDA, for example, you can easily
find, whichever is appropriate, a CF or SDIO adapter. Likewise, if your laptop
lacks the capability, you can find a USB– or PCMCIA–powered Bluetooth
adapter.
Bluetooth, like Wi-Fi, complies with various standards, ranging from v1.0 to
v2.0, and like Wi-Fi, these standards are backward compatible. Bluetooth 1.1
and 1.2 specify a transfer rate of 723Kbps — which is plenty fast enough for
all but the fastest of connections — while Bluetooth 2.0 is capable of speeds
as high as 2.1Mbps. Besides these standards, however, Bluetooth also exists
in three power classes, outlined in Table 7-4.

Chapter 7: Cellular Data Services: Can You Connect Me Now?
What’s Bluetooth?
Bluetooth: A condition resulting from the inges-
tion of far too many blueberry pies. Well, not
really. But it is a strange name for a technology,
don’t you think? Of course, there’s a good story
behind it.
This wireless technology, with its develop-
mental roots in Scandinavia, resulted from the
co-operation and collaboration of several multi-
national companies, and its purpose is to unite
various peripheral devices — like phones, key-
boards, and computers — in seamless, wire-
less, communication. The development group
decided to name the new technology Bluetooth
because it’s a Scandinavian name synonymous
with unification and collaboration.
The term comes from Harald Blatand, the King
of Denmark from 940 to 985 A.D., and Bluetooth’s
symbol is a combination of the runic characters
of King Harald Blatand’s initials. Good King
Harald, whose last name can be translated in
English as Bluetooth, was responsible for unit-
ing Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. I’d like to
say it was united in peace, but unfortunately,
King Harald’s reign came to an end (not coinci-
dentally) at the same moment he lost his life in
battle.

As you can see from Table 7-4, it’s probably a good idea to shop for a Class 1
or Class 2 adapter. A few of the available adapter choices include:
 Socket Bluetooth SDIO Connection Kit: Manufactured by Socket and
available from many online and bricks-and-mortar discount retailers,
this is a Class 2, Bluetooth v1.1 adapter.
 Bluetooth PDA and PC Adapter Combo Card: Manufactured by Belkin,
this card can be used in a PDA’s CF slot or in a PC’s PCMCIA slot, making
it very versatile. The adapter conforms to Bluetooth v1.1 and has a
range of 33 feet.
 HBTC1 Bluetooth USB Class 1 Wireless Adapter: Manufactured by
Hawking Technology, this USB adapter is widely available online and
otherwise. The adapter conforms to Bluetooth v1.1 and, because it’s a
Class 1 adapter, has a range of 330 feet.
 Targus USB Bluetooth Adapter: Conforming to the Bluetooth v1.1 stan-
dard, this Class 2 adapter is manufactured by Targus and available from
their Web site and discount retailers.
Bluetooth adapters come packaged with an installation CD that includes the
necessary drivers. When you install the drivers and your adapter, be sure
that Bluetooth support (My Bluetooth Places) is set up in Windows.
Configuring the connection
If you’re using, for example, the Cingular Communication Manager, you can
employ the connection utility to tether your Bluetooth device. If not, you can
set it up in Windows as follows:
1. Make your phone discoverable.
This just means that it’s broadcasting a Bluetooth signal. Every phone
menu differs greatly; consult your manual to find out how to access your
Bluetooth configuration menu, where you find an option to make the
phone discoverable.
2. On your laptop, choose Start➪All Programs➪My Bluetooth Places.
The My Bluetooth Places window opens.
3. Click View Devices in Range.
After a few moments, an icon representing your phone appears.
4. Right-click the icon.
A dialog menu opens.
5. Select Pair Device.
142
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

The Bluetooth PIN Code Request dialog box opens.
6. Enter a PIN code, and click OK.
You have to enter this same PIN into the phone as well. For this reason,
use only numbers in your PIN — no letters.
7. Redirect your attention now to your phone, where three questions
await you: Accept, Add to Paired, and Decline.
• Accept: Pairs your computer with the phone, but the phone isn’t
paired with the computer.
• Add to Paired: Pairs both devices with each other. I strongly sug-
gest, for the sake of convenience, that you choose this option.
• Decline: Neither device is paired, and you’ve just wasted a couple
minutes.
8. Assuming you’ve chosen to pair both devices, enter the PIN code into
the phone.
9. On your laptop, once again, right-click the icon representing your
phone. From the menu, select Discover Available Services.
Several icons, including Dial-up Networking, appear.
10. Right-click the Dial-up Networking icon, and select Connect Dial-up
Networking.
The Connect Bluetooth Connections dialog box opens.

Chapter 7: Cellular Data Services: Can You Connect Me Now?

Combining Wi-Fi and Cellular
So here you are, traveling the highways and byways of this great nation with
your whole crew. But everyone has his or her own computer and wants to be
online at the same time. For everybody to be connected to a high-speed cellu-
lar service, at $60 to $80 per month per person, your fortune will soon be
transferred from your bank to that of your cellular provider.
There is, however, a light on the horizon. Two companies have come up with
devices designed to share a single, cellular connection. In much the same
way that an access point at a hotspot broadcasts a single Internet connec-
tion, you can use the Junxion Box (manufactured by Junxion) or the Kyocera
KR1 Mobile Router to expand the access of a single, cellular, Internet connec-
tion by broadcasting that connection as a Wi-Fi signal. (See Figure 7-4.)
Using a single, high-speed, cellular data account, you can connect several
computers simultaneously to the Internet. Neither of these devices could be
fairly described as “inexpensive,” but because the connection can be shared
among several users, you could recoup the initial cost in a matter of months,
depending on how many users share the connection.
Although the devices are similar, they do have a couple of important differ-
ences, as you can see in Table 7-5.

As you can see by examining Table 7-5, the Junxion Box is limited to using
data cards, but offers the ability and versatility to connect with all the
national high-speed cellular providers (not, obviously, simultaneously). On
the other hand, the Kyocera KR1 is limited to either Sprint or Verizon, but
costs less than half that of the Junxion Box. The Kyocera KR1 also offers the
option of using a cellphone tethered by a USB cable, rather than a data card,
to establish the connection between the router and cellular network.
Both of these devices provide the option of using either Wi-Fi or Ethernet to
make the connection between your computer and the router. The Kyocera
KR1 has four Ethernet ports, whereas the Junxion Box has two.
Boosting Your Signal
By using an external antenna — either with or without an amplifier — you
can increase your ability to connect to a distant cell tower, but as is the case
with Wi-Fi adapters, not every data card comes equipped with an external
antenna connection port. What’s interesting, though, is that the amplifiers
and antennas are compatible with both GSM and CDMA technologies. You
can use these signal-boosting devices, for example, with a Kyocera KPC650
using Verizon’s Ev-DO service or a Sierra Wireless AirCard 860 tied to Cingular’s
EDGE or HSDPA networks. A few things to keep in mind include:
 Indoor versus outdoor antennas: An outdoor, magnetic-mount antenna
uses the roof as a ground plane, and therefore, can’t be used inside a
vehicle. If you’re looking for one of the best indoor antennas available, I
recommend you begin your search at www.booster-antenna.com.
 Amplifiers: An amplifier used in conjunction with an antenna can pull in
signals that an antenna alone might not even detect. Some amplifiers,
however, (because of the technology used) might boost your signal, but
they do so by using considerable amounts of bandwidth. Currently, one
145
Chapter 7: Cellular Data Services: Can You Connect Me Now?

amplifier, the Cyfre CA819 (sold under both the Inteligain and Shakespeare
banners), has proven in test after test to boost the signal without hog-
ging the network. In fact, it’s the only amplifier approved by all U.S. cel-
lular providers.
Finding Additional Information
Over the course of time, I’ve found a few Web sites that have provided me
with consistently valuable information.
 HowardForums: Found at www.howardforums.com, this Web site is
filled with information related to cellphones, data cards, signal boosting,
and a whole lot more.
 EVDOinfo.com: I rarely come across a Web site with this much relevant
information. Before you make any Ev-DO related purchases, you should
visit www.evdoinfo.com.
 Maximum Signal: If you’re shopping for an amplifier or an outdoor cellu-
lar antenna, this is the first place to look. You can find excellent products,
excellent service, and honest advice at www.maximumsignal.com.

In This Chapter
 Getting prepared for dialup
 Choosing the perfect ISP
 Getting connected on the road
 Doing dialup wire-free
A
s much as I like and enjoy wireless Internet access, it’s an unfortunate
fact of life that Wi-Fi isn’t everywhere. At times, the only way you can
connect to the Internet is to turn back the clock. Yes, I’m talking about con-
necting wires to your computer. I don’t like it any more than you do — but
sometimes, if you want to get connected to the Internet, a wired connection
is necessary.
So why am I telling you about this? Mainly because there are a few differences
between using a wired connection while traveling and using one at home. For
example, if you’ve been using a local ISP for your connection at home, most
likely you’ll need to make a toll call to get connected from your home on
wheels.
In this chapter, I help you prepare to make the occasional wired connection. I
also tell you about ways to avoid long-distance connections — and about an
innovative way to make a wireless connection via dialup.
Preparing for Travel
After so many venues set up hotspots and joined the Wi-Fi revolution, I thought
that I’d be able to throw my 20-foot phone cord in the trash. I couldn’t have
been more wrong. Granted, most of the time I can take advantage of a wire-free
connection, but at times — especially if I’m spending a day or two in an out-of-
the-way motel room — my only hope of getting online is by making a wired
connection.

Because this is true — and because I believe it’ll remain true for quite some
time — I continue to carry the necessary gear for getting connected the old-
fashioned way. Among the items I find necessary and useful are
 Retractable phone cord: When my laptop’s wired to the wall, I don’t like
to sit under the motel desk. So I always carry a 20-foot phone cord. It
doesn’t have to be retractable, but retractable is nice.
 Retractable Ethernet cable: For the most part, you won’t find
retractable Ethernet cords in lengths much longer than eight feet. If you
need more length, you’ll have to carry it the old-fashioned way.
I use the Model PA205U retractable phone cord from Targus (www.
targus.com/us), which also sells a variety of computer travel gear.
You can also find retractable phone cords and Ethernet cables at
CableOrganizer.com (http://cableorganizer.com/retractable),
Cables To Go (www.cablestogo.com), and Belkin (www.belkin.com).
Belkin’s 7-in-1 Retractable Cable Pack is the Swiss Army Knife of cable
organizers.
 Modem: Chances are good (especially if your laptop’s less than a few
years old) that you’ve got a built-in modem, but if not, you can purchase
a PC-card modem that looks very much like a PC-card Wi-Fi adapter.
 Modem saver: Your phone modem’s designed to handle a low-voltage
analog signal. Many hotels and motels, however — because of their PBX
switching needs — use a digital line. This can fry your modem like a
cheap steak. Even worse, if you’re using a laptop with an integrated
modem, you can put your entire computer at risk because the internal
modem’s plugged into the motherboard. To alleviate the problem, look
for a phone equipped with a data port in your hotel room. By using the
data port rather than plugging your phone line directly into the wall
plug, you can avoid any potential damage. If you don’t have the option of
using a data port, you can employ a digital line converter. These are
handy items, but they’re also pretty expensive.
Of course, even the lack of a data port doesn’t necessarily mean the
line’s unsuitable for use with your modem. But how do you know for
sure? Elementary, my dear reader — you simply use a digital line tester.
TeleAdapt, for example, manufactures the TeleTester Pro (NF) that 
can, by detecting a high-amperage line, help you avoid damaging your
modem. If the line’s suitable for use, it’ll indicate that, too. See www.
teleadapt.com.
Delving into Dialup
Back in days of old, when dialup was dominant, I remember being thrilled to
hear those familiar sounds indicating my modem was making a connection.
148
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

Now they’re an indication that I’m stuck somewhere that Wi-Fi hasn’t found.
Still, it’s nice to know that the dialup ISPs are alive and kicking — because at
least occasionally, they’re the only game in town.
The biggest dialup-related issue for me has always been whether to use a
national subscription ISP or a prepaid service. ISPs such as EarthLink and
AOL offer a lot of bells and whistles to go along with their dialup access, but
now that I’m primarily accessing the Internet from wireless hotspots, I don’t
know that I really want to pay a subscription fee for dialup, too.
When I first joined the ranks of laptop-toting truckers, I ventured forth,
believing that my trusty AOL account would provide me with a connection
anywhere I went. For the most part, that assumption was true — but I hadn’t
considered the fact that I’d frequently be in areas lacking local access num-
bers. In those cases, I was forced to pay ten cents a minute to use the toll-free
access number. All well and good — I could surf the Net, but I was paying that
extra fee on top of my already-hefty monthly subscription rate.
Six bucks an hour plus $24 a month is quite a bit to pay for a dialup Internet
connection, but being a newcomer, I didn’t know I had other choices. Part of
the problem, at the time, was that AOL hadn’t yet built the large inventory of
local access numbers it now offers. While the national subscription ISPs have
increased the likelihood of being able to make a local call, the possibility of
being forced to use the expensive toll-free number still lurks.
The alternative to a monthly dialup subscription plan — especially one that
simply serves as a backup to Wi-Fi — is to use one of the many prepaid ISPs.
The advantages are many, but you need to know about a couple of issues,
such as a lack of (or limited) e-mail service, before you buy. Table 8-1 offers a
quick comparison of several services.

I’ve tried most of the prepaid services, and although they’re remarkably simi-
lar, I’ve noticed a few differences — some subtle and some not so subtle. All
the services, for example, require you to purchase a set amount of time up
front (hence the term prepaid), but the minimum amount ranges from a low
of $5.95, offered by Budget Dialup, to a high of $20 at BAMnet.
Some prepaid services, such as BAMnet, also offer a reduced rate for larger
initial and recharge purchases — and while access minutes have a shelf-life of
one year at Budget Dialup and MaGlobe, they never expire at BAMnet. Note,
however, that if you purchase additional time prior to the expiration date, all
time is renewed and no access time expires.
Both Budget Dialup and MaGlobe employ the use of an auto-dialer, much like
the one AOL uses, while BAMnet uses the connection configuration software
built into Windows. Budget Dialup also offers the option of choosing a manual
setup if you don’t want to use the auto-dialer. Why you wouldn’t want to use
it is beyond me, though.
The biggest — and, for me, the most significant — difference is in tech sup-
port. I haven’t experienced a problem with MaGlobe, but at least to me, it
doesn’t seem as if e-mail tech support is going to be much help if you’re expe-
riencing problems getting online. I much prefer being able to speak with a
human. Even a person who barely speaks English is better than being stuck
with e-mail tech support when you can’t send e-mail.
150

If you’re interested in visiting the prepaid ISP Web sites, you can find them by
pointing your browser toward these URLs:
 Budget Dialup: www.budgetdialup.com
 MaGlobe: www.maglobe.com
 BAMnet: www.bamnet.com
After you set up your connection (an installer wizard typically guides you
through the process), the dialer can pop up every time you boot your laptop
or close out a wireless connection. To keep it out of your way, in Internet
Explorer, choose Tools➪Options and click the Connections tab. Select your
connection from the Dial-up and Virtual Private Connections list box, and
select the Never Dial a Connection radio button. When you need to use dialup,
just double-click the dialup icon on your desktop and the dialer opens.
As you travel around using the software that comes with your connection, you
simply need to select the local access number for wherever you are, and set
the dialer to dial a 9 if your hotel or motel requires it to get an outside line.
Dialup Unplugged (Kind Of)
Other than the fact that it’s considerably slower than a wireless broadband
connection, I don’t find dialup all that inconvenient, except for one thing: I
just hate the phone line dangling from my laptop. I don’t know how many
times — especially before I began using a laptop with an internal modem —
I’ve stepped on the cord and caused damage.
For that reason, I’m always on the lookout for a way to use a dialup connec-
tion without actually connecting a wire to my laptop — and I’ve found a few.
For example, in the previous chapter, I talk about using your cellphone as a
modem. There are also other, easier ways to get a wire-free dialup Internet
connection.
Comparing wireless dialup modems
One of the indications that dialup will never die has to be the fact that prod-
ucts continue to be manufactured catering to the technology. With the world
going gaga over Wi-Fi, a few folks have come up with dialup modems that use
various technologies allowing for a wireless connection between your com-
puter and the modem.
151
Chapter 8: Reattaching the Wired Tether

Getting down to brass tacks, the only real difference between these devices
and a wireless access point is that the Internet connection is dialup rather
than broadband. You can choose from at least four different methods of
making the wireless connection between your computer and the modem
being used:
 Infrared: Almost every computer has an infrared sensor located in 
the screen, but if by some chance yours doesn’t, you can buy a USB-
powered infrared adapter.
 Bluetooth: This wireless technology, though it hasn’t yet seemed to real-
ize its potential, has begun to be widely used to eliminate cabling between
computers and peripheral devices. The range is less than the 802.11
standards, but when you’re using it in a motel room, how far does it
need to reach?
 900 MHz wireless: This is the same frequency used by many cordless
phones — and though I know of only one device using this technology,
it’s worth a look.
 802.11: Again, I know of only one device using Wi-Fi to bridge the gap
between your computer and a dialup connection, which is kind of puz-
zling because a large number of the people who want to use wireless
dialup modems already have, in all likelihood, computers capable of
making an 802.11 connection.
Bluetooth modems
The largest group — therefore the largest selection — of wireless dialup
modems utilizes Bluetooth technology. If you don’t have a built-in Bluetooth
transceiver, you’ll need to use an adapter. Many modems include a USB
adapter; for those that don’t, the manufacturer might sell one separately.
Among the group of Bluetooth wireless modems are the following:
 EXP wireless Bluetooth 56K modem: Manufactured by EXP, this modem
functions under the V.90 standard and utilizes the older V1.1 standard,
which is more than sufficient for dialup, but also uses a long-range Class
1 radio transceiver. It comes bundled with a 110v power cord and a USB
Bluetooth adapter. This modem’s available from EXP at www.expnet.
com/expweb.nsf as well as other online retailers.
 Socket Cordless 56K modem: This V.90-standard Bluetooth modem can
be used with the supplied AC power cord or battery; using the power
cord charges the battery simultaneously. A connection-management
wizard is included in the software, and the modem is compatible with
both tone and pulse dialing. It’s available from Socket Communications
at www.socketcom.com, as well as several online discount retailers.
152
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

 Zoom Model 4300 Bluetooth modem: A Bluetooth Class 1 radio trans-
ceiver provides a range of up to 300 feet, and the V1.1 standard easily
surpasses the requirements of a 56K V.90 modem. The Model 4300 uses
encryption to secure the wireless transmission; it’s available from Zoom
at www.zoom.com as well as discount retailers.
Infrared modems
Whereas a Class 1 Bluetooth transceiver is capable of communicating at dis-
tances in excess of 300 feet, an infrared (IrDA) modem is limited to distances
of somewhere around 3 feet. This limitation makes IrDA a much less attrac-
tive technology for use in a hotel or motel room. Most IrDA modems, as a
matter of fact, are probably purchased by PDA owners who desire a dialup
connection for their handhelds.
There have never been a lot of IrDA modems manufactured; the Pegasus III,
from 3JTech, is the only one I know of that’s still being built. It’s available
from www.3jtech.com and online discount retailers. You might also find a
Psion Travel Modem during your Internet travels — it’s supported, but it’s no
longer built by Psion.
Wireless modems
The two wireless modems I’m aware of take two completely different
approaches to achieving a wireless connection between modem and com-
puter. The Nebo Wireless Link, for example, transmits and receives a 900MHz
radio signal between the base unit and a remote device that’s plugged into
both a USB port on your computer and the modem port on your computer.
The Nebo Wireless Link also has an innovative security feature — making it,
possibly, more secure than 802.11-based devices. This security feature chooses
from more than 260,000 digital security codes and assigns one to the base
and remote unit. Base and remote units operate as a pair, communicating
securely. If you’re interested in the Nebo Wireless Link, you can find it avail-
able from the manufacturer at www.nebowireless.com.
On the other hand, the WiFlyer, by AlwaysOn Wireless, employs the 802.11b
standard, making it possible to conveniently connect in the same way you
would at any hotspot. The WiFlyer is especially handy for couples wanting to
share an Internet connection: Because it’s acting as a wireless access point,
you can set up your own local-access network.
Security, which is always a concern with a wireless connection, includes encryp-
tion, MAC address filtering, and other wireless-security protocols. Another
feature of the WiFlyer is its ability to make use of both a dialup and broad-
band connection. Turning your motel room into a wireless hotspot has never
153
Chapter 8: Reattaching the Wired Tether

been so easy. The WiFlyer is available from AlwaysOn at www.alwayson
wireless.com as well as a few other online retailers.
Using the WiFlyer
Never have I come across a computer-related device that was as easy to set
up and use as the WiFlyer. You might not believe this, but from the time the
WiFlyer first arrived at my door to the time I was connected to the Internet,
fewer than ten minutes passed. As a matter of fact, it took just under seven
minutes. And some of that time, maybe even most of the time, I spent slicing
through the tape on the well-packed box.
Configuring WiFlyer for dialup
If it only takes a few minutes to connect to the Internet, there’s not (obviously)
a whole lot involved in configuring the WiFlyer. When you open the box, you
see a three-step guide to getting connected, and with just a couple of nuances,
that’s about it. The most detailed description of configuration follows:
1. Connect the cords.
After you connect the phone line and the power cord, you see the first
LED light indicating that all is well to this point.
Don’t connect the phone cord directly to a digital line.
2. On your laptop, open your connection-management utility (WZC, JiWire,
or other), look for the SSID wiflyer, and connect to that network.
See Chapter 6 for more information about connecting to a wireless 
network.
3. Boot your browser.
Your browser should boot automatically, but if it doesn’t, open it. 
Prior to opening your browser, make certain that your e-mail client
(Outlook Express, Thunderbird, and so on) is closed. The WiFlyer
dialup-configuration page opens automatically.
If, for some unknown reason, the WiFlyer configuration page fails to
open automatically, type http://192.168.7.77 into the address window of
your browser, and press Enter. (See Figure 8-1.) The configuration screen
can be reached only by entering http://192.168.7.77 into the address
field of your browser. Save this page into your favorites so you can
access it easily.
154
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

4. Select your ISP from the Internet Service Provider drop-down list.
If you use one of the ISPs listed in the drop-down list, select it and click
Save. If you’re using any other ISP, such as Budget Dialup, just maintain
the Default setting on the menu.
5. Enter an access number.
If you selected one of the ISPs listed in the drop-down list, the Access
Numbers button is activated — and, if you click that button, you can
choose an access number from the list that opens. Otherwise, use an
access number provided by your ISP. If, for example, your ISP is Budget
Dialup, you’re bypassing the autodialer — but you still need to open it
and select an access number.
6. Enter your username and password.
If you’re an AOL customer, your username is your screen name.
Otherwise, it’s the name and password you used when you signed up for
service with your ISP.

155
Chapter 8: Reattaching the Wired Tether

7. Set dialing rules.
If you’re in a hotel or motel, you most likely need to dial 8 or 9 to get an
outside line. To accomplish this, click Dial Options (toward the top of
the page), and when the Dial Options screen opens, as shown in Figure
8-2, select and set the necessary parameters. Save the settings and the
configuration window reopens.
8. Click Save, and then click Dial Now!
A really handy feature of the WiFlyer is the Quick Connect button located just
above the LED indicator lights. Rather than return to the configuration screen
to disconnect, you can simply press the Quick Connect button. In a similar
fashion, the next time you want to connect to the Internet, if you’re accessing
the same number, you can simply press the Quick Connect button. You can
do this while you’re booting your computer, and by the time it’s up and run-
ning, your dialup connection is established as well.
Figure 8-2:

options.
156
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

Configuring the WiFlyer for broadband
If you find yourself in a hotel or motel room offering a broadband Internet
connection, you can use the WiFlyer to set up a high-speed wireless connec-
tion with no more effort than was required to configure for dialup. You will,
however, need to know whether you’re using a cable or DSL connection, and
you should be able to get that information from the hotel or motel staff. You
should also ask if you need to know about any other issues prior to making a
connection.
The first three steps are the same for both dialup and broadband. With the
configuration screen open, follow these steps:
1. Click the Switch to Broadband button.
A dialog box opens, asking whether you’re sure you want to switch. You
can think about it for a second or two.
2. Click Yes.
The Broadband Configuration screen opens.
3. Choose the Static, DHCP, or PPPoE mode, whichever is appropriate,
for your connection.
This is where information from the staff comes in. If you need a static IP
address, the motel staff will give you the necessary information. If the
connection requires PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet),
they’ll give you a username, password, and authentication method. And,
if it’s DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) — meaning that they
most likely employ a cable connection or you’re connecting to their LAN
(local-access network — nothing more than two or more computers net-
worked together) — no other information is required. DHCP is the most
common setting.
4. Click Save. You might need to reboot the WiFlyer device, and after
you do so, the Broadband Configuration screen reopens.
5. Click Connect if the button’s active (if it’s not, you’re connected).
Configuring security
A hotspot, by its very nature, is an open, unsecured WLAN (wireless local-
area network; an access point, and one or more wirelessly connected com-
puters). With the WiFlyer, you create your own WLAN, but because you might
not want the general public joining your network, you can choose to close it
by enabling a few security features. The nice thing about setting up WiFlyer
security is that no matter where you go and regardless of whether you’re
using a dialup or broadband connection, the settings remain the same.
157
Chapter 8: Reattaching the Wired Tether

You can choose to use just one or all of the several levels of security avail-
able to you. In order to secure your connection, follow these steps:
1. Open the Configuration page (dialup or broadband), and click the
Advanced Configuration button. In the menu on the left side of 
the Advanced Configuration page, choose Security to open the
Security page.
From the Security page, you can choose from four different security
measures.
2. If you want to enable password protection, put a check mark in the
box and then enter and confirm a password.
Enabling the requirement for a password is the most basic of security
features. It probably won’t keep a determined hacker from joining your
network, but it should keep the guy in the next room from barging into
your network.
3. To enable Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), click the Wireless Security
link to open the Wireless Security and Encryption Settings page.
When you’re done defining your WEP settings, click Save and reboot
the WiFlyer.
If you choose to use this feature — and I recommend that you do — you
need to configure the following WEP settings (see Figure 8-3):
a. Put a check mark in the Enable WEP check box.
b. Choose whether you want 64-bit or 128-bit encryption from the drop-
down list. 
I recommend 128-bit encryption, but it’s up to you.
c. Choose your encryption keys.
You don’t have to enter a key for all four fields, but I recommend it.
64-bit hexadecimal keys must be 10-hex-digits long, and 128-bit
keys must be 26-hex bits long.
A hex-digit is one of 16 letters or numbers, either 0-9 or A-F.
Hexadecimal is a base-16 system in which all the bytes can be rep-
resented by using a combination of two hexadecimal numbers.
158
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

Be sure to make note of the keys you’ve used, and put the note
somewhere that you can easily find. This is the only way, once set,
to access the WiFlyer; you can imagine the importance of being
able to locate it.
d. Make certain a check mark appears in the box next to Deny unen-
crypted data.
e. Choose Open or Shared Key authentication.
I prefer Shared Key just because it puts another layer between me
and everyone else.

Chapter 8: Reattaching the Wired Tether

I’ve had problems getting wireless devices to connect with invisible
access points, so I recommend you maintain a visible one. Others can
see your SSID on their Available Networks screen, but you can (if you
choose) change the SSID they see. From the Advanced Configuration
page, choose Wireless Networks, and when the page opens, simply
change the name and click Save. You can also change the channel from
this page if you’ve noticed any interference from other wireless devices.
4. If you want to enable MAC Address filtering, choose, from the
Security page, Wireless Address Filtering, enable it by placing a check
mark in the box, and enter the MAC address of each computer
allowed to join your network into one of the 16 text-entry fields.
By choosing to filter Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, you limit
the computers able to access your network to only those you’ve placed
on the Allowed Access page. To find the MAC address for a computer
running Windows XP, follow these steps:
a. Choose Start➪Run, type cmd into the text field, and click Open.
The Command Prompt screen opens.
b. Type ipconfig/all, and then press Enter.
The Physical Address, which is the MAC address for your wireless
device, is shown. It’s something like 00-15-28-68-BC.
WiFlyer help-desk personnel have recommended to me that either MAC
Address filtering or WEP be used, but not both. Your WiFlyer won’t
explode should you choose to use both, but it’s probably unnecessary
and it could slightly slow your connection speed, especially if you
include a lot of “allowed” MAC addresses.
5. If you like, you can enable the port Filtering Firewall by choosing this
option from the Security page and entering the pertinent parameters
in the text entry fields.
Port filtering stops certain applications from sending traffic through the
access point. I’ve never had occasion to use this feature and the MAC
address filter rules take precedence over this firewall. Primary users of
this firewall will be businesses with intranets that allow access to the
Internet but want to stop certain activities (such as instant messaging).

O
n October 4, 1957, one of my best friends celebrated a birthday while
the Soviet Union sent Sputnik into space. Since that time, those celebrated
birthdays have (sadly) come to an end. But satellites, now numbering in the
thousands, continue to be blasted beyond the bounds of Earth. Many of these
orbiting marvels of engineering are communications satellites that make it pos-
sible to speak with anyone in the world, watch television broadcasts, and (more
recently) access the Internet from nearly any location in the world.
To me, having grown up in a small Oregon town that had a single television
and radio station, the idea that you can park in the middle of nowhere and
access both the World Wide Web and satellite television broadcasts — all at
the same time — is nothing short of incredible. If you’ve got a clear view of
the southern sky, you can have Internet access whether you’re at the MGM
Grand or the Grand Canyon. This convenience doesn’t come cheap, but if you
absolutely must be connected, it’s an option to consider.
In this chapter, I give you an idea of the options available to you should you
decide that Internet-via-satellite is something you want to explore. For exam-
ple, with a look at several satellite-Internet system manufacturers (and more
than one configuration), I help you sift through the possibilities. I also offer
pointers on finding a reputable dealer (whichever configuration you might
choose) and on getting the most out of your system.
Surfing with a Satellite: The Basics
With a satellite setup, you can surf in the desert, mountains, plains, and prairies.
Just about anyplace you can drive to can become a connected campsite if

you use Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) satellite dishes to connect with
communication satellites in geosynchronous orbit.
How do satellite connections work?
If you connect to the Internet via satellite, you connect to a network system
comprised of several components, including the following:
 Network Operation Center (NOC): The NOC has a hardwired connection
to the Internet backbone, usually T1 or better, and maintains a constant
connection to the satellite(s). Every VSAT system making access to
satellites handled by the NOC can be monitored for usage.
 Outdoor Unit: This is basically your satellite dish and all the compo-
nents attached to it, as shown in Figure 9-1.
• Reflector dish: The largest and most recognizable part of the
system, the dish gathers the signal from the satellite and reflects it
toward the feedhorn (when receiving), or gathers the signal from
the feedhorn and reflects it to the satellite (when transmitting).
• Feedhorn: The feedhorn, suspended in front of the dish on the
Feedhorn Arm, focuses the signal that the dish reflects to it and
feeds that signal to the Low Noise Block (LNB).
• LNB: This component amplifies the satellite signal it receives from
the feedhorn, translates it, and sends it on to the modem. If the
feedhorn is integrated into the LNB, it’s referred to as an LNBF.
• Transmit amplifier: Mounted, most often, on the bottom of the
feedhorn arm, this amplifier increases the transmission signal from
the modem to (depending on your system) 1 or 2 watts.

Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

 Indoor unit: Also known as the IDU, this is the part of any VSAT system
that remains inside the coach. The components making up the IDU may
include the following:
• Controller: If the system auto-deployed and is self-pointing, a con-
troller raises, lowers, and aims the dish. Newer controllers are 
fully integrated; the pointing software isn’t loaded on a separate
computer.
• Modem: As with any other connection to the Internet, you need a
modem to convert the satellite signal into a data stream that your
computer can understand.
• Wireless router: Connecting a wireless router to the modem turns
your vehicle into a self-contained hotspot, enabling you to stow all
the system components in a cabinet.
 Satellite: The satellite acts as a middleman, as shown in Figure 9-2. It
receives and transmits radio signals from both the NOC and the VSAT
dish mounted on or near your vehicle. Each satellite contains several
transponders for sending and receiving data. When you subscribe to a
satellite Internet provider, your account is tied to a specific transponder.

Chapter 9: Sky-High Wi-Fi

Maintaining a clear line of sight is one of the most important factors in get-
ting a VSAT system to receive a strong signal from the satellite. Trees with
leaves — even power lines (because of electrical interference) — can be
effective barriers to effective communication with the satellite.
The limiting factors
Each transponder on a satellite has a limited bandwidth. This limitation
results in two attributes that, although not exclusive to those accessing the
Internet via satellite, are common to all satellite ISPs:
 The download data-transfer rate is higher than the upload speed. For
most people who access the Internet to surf the Web and e-mail friends
and family, this attribute means (for example) that Web pages download
and open quickly. Those who need to upload large files, however, should
expect some slowdown. For most basic satellite plans, you get an upload
speed of about 128 Kpbs and a download speed ranging from 500 to 
1000 Kpbs.
 A Fair Access Policy (FAP) controls how much bandwidth you can use.
The purpose of a FAP is to ensure that everyone has equal access to the
satellite and that nobody is using more than their fair share of the avail-
able bandwidth. Most ISPs monitor how much uploading and download-
ing is going on (in terms of data-transfer amounts measured in megabytes)
on a running average. If a subscriber exceeds preset limits, their service
is limited by slowing their data-transfer speeds until they’re back within
set tolerances. Some satellite aficionados who suffer such a slowdown
refer to it as being Fapped.
When you sign up for a service subscription, be sure you entirely under-
stand the FAP under which you’ll be operating. There are two components
common to all FAPs:
• Upload/download threshold: This varies among providers and
may also be subscription plan specific, meaning if you pay a higher
monthly rate your threshold increases. Typically the upload thresh-
old is much lower than the download threshold; if you e-mail a lot
of large files, upload Web pages, or send program files to a server,
you might run afoul of the FAP.
If you simply browse the Web or e-mail friends and family, it’s
unlikely you’ll ever find FAP an issue but, if you download a lot of
music, video, or software you could easily experience a slowdown.
• Recovery rate: In general, if you’re Fapped, your data-transfer rate
falls to a level that approximates that of dialup service until you’ve
recovered enough bandwidth to be allowed full-speed surfing.
Depending on your plan and provider, recovery could take any-
where from a few hours to a day or more.
164
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

The FAP is especially important to those who may be operating a business
while traveling the country in their RVs. Most satellite ISPs offer plans, at a
higher cost, that accommodate larger upload/download thresholds — and
also (generally) allow higher data-transfer rates.
If you regularly use a virtual private network (VPN), you may want to opt for
a public (that is, static) IP address. A more stable connection can be made if
you’ve got a static IP address than may be possible with a dynamic IP
address. I talk more about employing a VPN in Chapter 10.
Surveying the Known Universe of Options
Well, I doubt I can cover the entire universe of choices, but I can point out a
few of the brighter stars. If you’re contemplating the use of satellite communi-
cation as your method of accessing the Internet you should take the following
into consideration while shopping:
 VSAT reflector dish: Although satellite Internet systems may seem simi-
lar, there are some differences. Among them are the following:
• Manually deployed dish: Choosing this type of equipment
decreases your cost but increases the time it takes getting set up
for Internet access. Because it can be positioned 50 to 100 feet
from your coach, however, it’s also very versatile.
• Automatically deployed dish: These systems are more expensive,
but convenience comes at a cost. Boot your laptop, punch a couple
of buttons, and voila´ — you’re connected to the Net. This requires
a controller that not only raises and lowers the dish, but also aims
it and acquires the satellite signal. (Cool.)
• Dish diameter: The most common dish diameter is .74 meters. If
you require service near the edge of a satellite footprint, desire
faster transfer speeds, or want to use a 2-watt rather than a 1-watt
transmitter, you may find it appropriate (albeit more expensive) to
opt for a .95-, .98- or 1.2-meter dish.
 Cost: All these companies offer monthly plans at varying rates; as might
be expected, higher transfer speeds result in a higher cost. FAP is
another cost factor; it pays to become familiar with its limitations. (For
more about FAP, see the earlier section, “The limiting factors.”)
 Coverage: Usually a number of satellites in geosynchronous orbit can
provide Internet access. Each satellite, because of its position in the
southern sky, has a somewhat different coverage footprint. Before sign-
ing a contract, you should be certain that the company you’re consider-
ing provides coverage in the area you most often frequent.
165
Chapter 9: Sky-High Wi-Fi

 Commitment: Depending on the ISP providing the satellite service you
can expect to see minimum contractual commitments ranging in length
from 1 year to 18 months. In some cases, a longer contract results in
lower monthly costs; in all cases, a stiff penalty may be assessed if the
contract is terminated before the commitment is completed. I know of
only one company, StarBand, than offers a month-to-month plan.
Manually deployed systems
A long, long time ago, during my first ski trip at Homewood Mountain Resort
(overlooking lovely Lake Tahoe), I was taking the T-bar back to the top of the
treacherous bunny hill when I noticed a fellow and his young son side-stepping
their way up the slope. When I asked him why they were walking up the moun-
tain when the resort was fully equipped with a number of well-maintained
lifts, he chastened me with the reply: “There’s more to skiing than just going
down the mountain!” Indeed.
If, by chance, you feel that there should be more to surfing the Net than
simply sipping a cup of coffee while your dish deploys itself and acquires a
signal — or you just want to save a few thousand bucks — then you might be
interested in a manually deployed VSAT dish sitting atop a tripod.
At this time, the StarBand Manual-Flyer is the only manually deployed mobile
system that’s officially sanctioned, but a few other companies do offer
HughesNet-based tripod systems. HughesNet doesn’t support or sanction
these systems — technically, they operate outside the strict scope of their
rules — but so far HughesNet hasn’t moved to stop anyone from using one of
these systems. Among those offering manually deployed systems are
 StarBand: The Manual-Flyer system includes a VSAT dish, mounting
tripod, modem, set-up tools, and connection cable. The dealer from
which you buy the system provides a training program that certifies you
as a StarBand Certified Installer. The Web site: www.starband.com.
 Dustyfoot.com: Offering a HughesNet system including, among other
items, the VSAT dish, tripod, modem, cable, and dish pointing tools. You
get a manual and instructional DVD with the system; Dustyfoot.com pro-
vides technical assistance with every complete tripod system. Not sur-
prisingly, their Web address is www.dustyfoot.com.
 Maxwell Satellite: Their system (also HughesNet-based) is known as the
PortaSat. It includes the reflector-dish assembly, tripod, modem, and
cable (in both 25- and 35-foot lengths). A 60-page instruction manual and
customer-support Web site are also provided. They’re located on the
Web at www.maxwellsatellite.com.
166
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

 Mobile Internet: A VSAT dish, tripod mount, modem, pointing tools, and
instructional video are included, along with a two-hour phone consulta-
tion to help with initial setup. They also offer an instructional and infor-
mative e-book on their Web site at www.mobileinternet.bz.
One point in favor of manually deployed systems is that they can, in most
cases, be used to provide Internet access at home as well as on the road. This
is important if you’re not a full-time traveler since monthly charges may con-
tinue whether or not you use the satellite service.
Auto-deployed VSAT systems
When you search for a mobile satellite Internet-access solution, you find sev-
eral companies clamoring for your business. In some respects, these compa-
nies are very similar — some may seem virtually the same at first glance. That’s
because several of them are value-added resellers (VARs) for HughesNet (for-
merly DirecWay).
A HughesNet VAR manufactures or assembles the mobile VSAT unit and/or
controller — but instead of contracting with a satellite owner for their own
transponder(s), they resell the satellite Internet access provided by HughesNet.
Technically, that makes the VAR an ISP — but the satellite modem, in these
cases, is the product of HughesNet.
Included among the HughesNet VARs are
 MotoSAT: DataStorm VSAT systems, manufactured by MotoSAT, might
very well be the most recognizable of satellite systems. You’ve probably
seen them, for years, on top of vans, RVs, and (occasionally) even
trucks. They’re found on the Web at www.motosat.com.
 Ground Control: As manufacturers of the Magellan MSS VSAT system
they offer dishes in both .74 and .95 meter sizes. You can find their Web
site by pointing your browser to www.groundcontrol.com.
 DataTech: The newest member of the HughesNet VAR club is DataTech
and their offering is known as the DirecStar. You can get more informa-
tion by visiting their Web site at www.direcstar.com.
The DataStorm, Magellan MSS and DirecStar aren’t the only fish in the sea.
For example, the iNetVu dish (by C-Com Satellite Systems, Inc.) is the plat-
form on which StarBand builds its StarBand Auto-Pointing Flyer VSAT system.
Here are a couple more major companies offering self-pointing units:
 StarBand: With transponder leases on Telstar 7, StarBand provides service
throughout the contiguous 48 states, but service (with some conditions)
167
Chapter 9: Sky-High Wi-Fi

may also be available in parts of Canada and Alaska. StarBand is located
on the Web at www.starband.com.
 RaySat: The SpeedRay 3000, a phased array low-profile antenna rather
than a dish antenna, is offered by RaySat. This unit, shown in Figure 9-3,
is only a few inches high — and its innovative design lets you use it
while the vehicle is in motion (more information at www.raysat.com).

Focusing on the SpeedRay 3000
As winner of the prestigious “Best of Show”
award, the shining star of the 2006 Consumer
Electronic Show was the RaySat SpeedRay
3000. As with other self-pointing satellite anten-
nas, it uses GPS to position its antenna — but
(unlike traditional reflector dish satellite anten-
nas) the SpeedRay 3000 employs phased-array
panels. The antenna array’s design allows the
panels to turn freely within the housing, making
the SpeedRay 3000 a low-profile unit that can
maintain the antenna’s orientation toward the
Southern sky. That helps it maintain its connec-
tion to satellites, even while the vehicle it’s
attached to cruises merrily along the highway.
As with reflector-dish antennas, it can also
receive television broadcasts and remain con-
nected to the Internet simultaneously.

Deciding which system suits you
While the greatest determining factors when assessing the available options
are likely to be cost and convenience, they probably aren’t your only consid-
erations. When making comparisons, you may want to include the following
items in your decision-making process:
 Manually deployed: You may notice that, while I refer to automatic sys-
tems as self-pointing, I don’t call these systems manual-pointing. That’s
because pointing is only one step in the total dish-deployment process.
If you’re considering a manually deployed system, the following are
some of the attributes you might want to keep in mind:
• Storage: Aside from the equipment shared by both manually
deployed and self-pointing systems (such as a modem and wireless
router), you’ll also need to find storage space for the cabling, dish
assembly, and tripod.
• Dish location: This can be both a positive and negative attribute.
On the one hand, a manually deployed dish might be moved about
the site and placed in a location unobstructed by trees or outbuild-
ings. On the other hand, because the dish is only a few feet off the
ground, nearby coaches might be more likely to block it.
• Convenience: If you don’t move your coach very often, this may
not be much of an issue. If you move more than once a week, how-
ever, you could quickly tire of unpacking, setting up, and pointing
your dish every time you set up your site. And deployment makes
up only two thirds of the issue. When you’re ready to leave, you’ve
got to pack it up and stow it away.
• Cost: Sure, the initial cost is considerably lower than that of a self-
pointing system. In addition to the initial savings, you may also
incur (depending on your plan and provider) lower monthly fees,
and your maintenance costs are nearly nonexistent. For a basic
plan, expect to pay $1,500 to $3,000 for your system, as well as $60
to $70 per month for an Internet service plan.
• Complexity: I’m not really sure these systems are simpler. GPS capa-
bility and pointing hardware are built into automatic systems, but
for manual deployment some other tools come in really handy — for
example, a GPS device, an accurate compass, and an electronic
pointing tool such as a BirDog or Outdoor Pointing Interface (OPI)
meter. At least if any of that equipment breaks, you won’t have to
tear into your system to fix or replace it.
169
Chapter 9: Sky-High Wi-Fi

When you begin to comparison-shop for a manually deployed system,
give careful consideration to the equipment included in the system —
especially the pointing equipment — and the training, documentation,
and support available with the purchase of a system.
 Self-pointing: Of course, self-pointing is only one attribute of a roof-
mounted VSAT system. Among the other characteristics you may want
to consider are the following:
• Storage: Since the dish folds and stows neatly on the roof, the only
storage required is a small, well-ventilated area in which to locate
the modem, controller, and wireless router.
• Dish location: Since the dish is mounted on a coach roof, its eleva-
tion is well above the ground but maybe not above the trees. If you
like to park in the shade, this could pose a problem.
• Convenience: While those with manually deployed systems are
spending time unpacking and setting up, those with self-pointing
systems are going about other business (or just relaxing), while
the dish deploys and acquires a signal. What could be easier?
• Cost: Convenience comes at a cost; if you’re prone to sticker-
shock, you may want your spouse to write the check. But you’ve
also got to consider what your time and effort are worth. For a
basic auto-deployed system, the equipment costs from $4,000 to
$7,000, plus $600 to $1,200 for the installation fee. Monthly Internet
service plans cost from $50 to $80 per month. Your call.
• Complexity: Okay, self-pointing units are complex; besides the
built-in electronics, a maze of gears, motors, and control boards
takes the place of the manual labor. That complexity might mean
more maintenance-related issues, but these units have been in use
for quite some time, and have proven reliable.
Because of potential differences in installation and system costs from one
dealership to another, it definitely pays to do some shopping. In the process
of interviewing dealers you should also question them concerning their
Internet service plan costs. Among the questions you might want to ask, no
matter whether you’re considering a manually deployed or self-pointing
system, concerning Internet service plans include the following:
 Can I reduce monthly costs with a longer contractual commitment?
While this isn’t always a possibility some providers, like StarBand, offer
lower costs with a longer commitment.
 How much more will it cost me to get a faster connection? All
providers offer multiple mobile service plans that feature extra-cost
enhancements to the basic plan.
170
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

 What’s your FAP? This varies from one plan to another and it varies
from one ISP to another. Be sure you understand the policy — and that
it’s something you can easily live with. In most cases, it’s possible to
increase the threshold by paying a higher monthly service fee.
 Can I stop and start service? If you’re on the road full time, you may not
need to suspend service temporarily. But if you spend half the year at
home and half on the road, an option like this can be important.
 If temporary service suspensions are allowed is there any reinstate-
ment fee? If they’re willing to give you a service suspension, you should
probably expect to pay a modest fee for reinstatement.
 Can I switch satellites for better coverage? If your satellite ISP is only
using one satellite, then okay, this won’t be an option. But if they employ
several satellites in their network, it’s worth looking into.
Going the DIY Route
There’s a certain satisfaction that seems to go hand-in-hand with any do-it-
yourself project. It’s something that’s hard to describe and something that
those who don’t do DIY may find themselves at a loss to understand. Not
much doubt, however, about one reason that Martha Stewart and Bob Vila
are such popular figures: They remind us that it’s possible to accomplish a
task, on our own, when others may have to seek professional help.
I think self-reliance is one of the primary attractions to manually deployed
VSAT systems. The feeling of freedom that comes with self-sufficiency is diffi-
cult to quantify. Of course, saving a bundle of cash is entirely quantifiable —
and being able to move a dish 50 to 100 feet away from a coach comfortably
parked in the shade is more than just attractive. It’s delightful. In fact, if you
spend much time in tree-rich environments like state and national parks, a
tripod-mounted system may be the only solution that has any chance at all of
getting a clear view of the southern sky.
Becoming a certified installer
Since a satellite in geostationary orbit measures just a few feet in diameter
and sits almost 22,300 miles above the equator, you can imagine accurately
aiming a satellite dish at it requires more than a compass and a plastic pro-
tractor. Because the equipment used in satellite-signal acquisition isn’t sold
at your local discount hardware store — and a high degree of aiming accu-
racy is required — it stands to reason that at least a limited level of training
might be required to set up a satellite dish used for Internet access.
171
Chapter 9: Sky-High Wi-Fi

Both HughesNet and StarBand require that anyone installing a satellite dish
system, mobile or otherwise, be certified. The certification itself isn’t techni-
cally required by the FCC — but FCC regulations regarding installation of any
satellite Internet dish must be complied with, so both providers require
installers to pass a certification test that demonstrates a general competence
and understanding regarding those regulations.
Understanding the rules and regulations, however, doesn’t mean that a
person also possesses the knowledge and ability to accurately aim a satellite
dish so that a signal can be acquired without creating interference. According
to those who sell the Dustyfoot, Mobile Internet, and Maxwell Satellite sys-
tems and use HughesNet satellite service, you don’t have to become a certi-
fied installer just to become proficient in the technique of deploying and
aiming a satellite dish. Hundreds of happy customers tend to support those
assertions.
Dustyfoot provides an excellent manual (clear and easily understandable),
Mobile Internet offers a video and phone consultation to get you up and 
running, and Maxwell Satellite provides a clear, well-written 60-page user’s
manual. For an additional charge, Maxwell Satellite also provides hands-on
training if you’re in their area. All these vendors say that, with practice, a
mobile tripod-mounted VSAT system can be set up in half an hour or less,
and that certification is unnecessary.
Alas, doing things this way bends — at the very least — the rules and
requirements laid out by HughesNet. You can, however, choose to become a
HughesNet-certified installer by enrolling in (for example) one of the training
classes offered by Ground Control. These training classes last three days and
currently cost $799; some tools, at additional cost, may also be required. For
more information about becoming a certified installer, you can e-mail Ground
Control at training@groundcontrol.com.
Being a trained and certified HughesNet installer won’t necessarily mean that
you’re operating completely within the spirit of the HughesNet customer
agreement — unless you also sign up for a mobile, rather than residential,
service plan. A mobile plan allows for constant dish relocation; the residential
plan stipulates that a user may relocate only one time per year. To date,
HughesNet has taken no action to discourage those who decide to apply a
creative interpretation of the agreement — but they could.
With StarBand offering the only officially sanctioned tripod based mobile
VSAT system currently available; all users of the Manual-Flyer are required to
be certified installers. When you purchase the StarBand Manual-Flyer from
one of their dealers you’re given hands-on training to learn the finer points of
setting up and aiming your VSAT dish. The training is normally completed in
a single afternoon; when you’re comfortable with your new skills, you can
take the free certification test. If you pass, StarBand issues your certification.
172
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

There’s something to be said in favor of personal, hands-on training and offi-
cial certification — even if the process (as seems to be the case under the
StarBand system) is somewhat informal. Another point in favor of using the
StarBand Manual-Flyer with one of the StarBand Mobile Internet service plans
is that everything you’re doing is unquestionably ethical. You’re paying for
the service you’re getting, you’ve complied with all the requirements of the
ISP, and moving your system from one site to another is entirely sanctioned
and supported.
Purchasing the pieces
Okay, you’re ready to buy the gear, but I can just hear those DIY gears turning
in your head. You’re thinking that you might be able to buy a bunch of stuff
from an auction site or three and put your own system together. Well, you
might find it possible — but I wouldn’t recommend it. A whole herd of people
have invested a considerable amount of time and effort to create complete
systems so you don’t have to scrounge the Web in search of every compo-
nent. Take advantage of their expertise and purchase your system directly
from them or from one of their dealers.
If you’re leaning toward Dustyfoot, Mobile Internet, or Maxwell Satellite man-
ually deployed VSAT systems, then finding a dealer requires little more than a
visit to a Web site. StarBand Manual-Flyer dealers, on the other hand, might
be a little bit more difficult to come by. Because StarBand requires Manual-
Flyer dealers to provide hands-on training to those who purchase their sys-
tems they’ve limited the number of StarBand dealers authorized to sell the
system to those dealers also qualified to provide the training. Authorized
dealers include the following:
 Orbital Enterprises: One of the first StarBand dealers in the nation to
offer the Manual-Flyer for sale, this proprietor was also responsible (at
least in part) for convincing StarBand to offer a fully supported, sanc-
tioned, tripod-mounted mobile VSAT system. Several optional system
configurations are available; it’s well worth your time to visit their Web
site at www.orbitalenterprises.net/mobile.html.
 RV Networking: A visit to their information-packed Web site can’t help
but be beneficial. Perusing a few pages reveals that these folks don’t just
sell these products; they really use them, enjoy them, and believe in their
usefulness. You can find them on the Web at www.rvnetworking.com.
 Roving Internet: Located in Castle Rock, CO, this dealer is responsible
for designing the off-set reflector dish mounting bracket that allows the
dish and feedhorn arm assembly to be attached to a tripod while main-
taining balance. The Web address is www.rovinginternet.com.
173
Chapter 9: Sky-High Wi-Fi

All three of these StarBand Manual-Flyer dealers are members of the Satellite
Mobility Support Network. If you’re considering the StarBand system, no
matter your location, your time won’t be wasted if you contact any one of
them. They may be able to arrange meeting you at a convenient location, or
make other suitable arrangements. You can also visit the StarBand Web site
and purchase the Manual-Flyer from them directly, or find a nearby dealer by
using their dealer-locator page. Just submit your Zip code and the resulting
page displays the dealer(s) closest to you. (Note: Not every dealer displayed
offers the Manual-Flyer; you may have to call a couple before you find one.)
Aiming your dish without screaming
At one time, while setting up a site, it was difficult to discern the difference
between couples having a knock-down drag-out argument from those simply
deploying a dish. One person would be outside aiming the dish; the other
would be inside yelling back the signal strength indicated on the laptop. For
couples with no two-way wireless radios, screaming was how they zeroed in.
Fortunately, you don’t have to rely on lung capacity to find out whether your
dish is perfectly positioned. Several devices are available to help make the
job a bit easier — and some combination is generally included with any of the
manually deployed systems. If your dealer doesn’t include one of them as
standard equipment, you might find they offer the device as an option (or
you can obtain one from another vendor). They are as follows:
 Outdoor Pointing Interface: The OPI, connected to the RX (receive)
cable, monitors signal strength without the need to have a computer
(running appropriate software) connected to the other end of the cable.
The OPI was developed by DirecWay and is available from Dustyfoot,
Mobile Internet, and Maxwell Satellite mobile VSAT systems.
 Digisat Meter: Operating in much the same way as the OPI, this meter is
often made available to those purchasing StarBand Manual-Flyer sys-
tems. It’s also available from several online retailers.
 BirDog Meter: Considerably more expensive than the OPI or Digisat
meters, the BirDog satellite signal finder is compatible with all the
mobile VSAT systems. It mounts and operates in much the same way as
the OPI and Digisat meters, but provides far more information. Several
dealers offer this meter with their systems as standard or optional
equipment; if yours doesn’t, you can still find it readily available from
online retailers. The BirDog Web site is www.birdog.tv.
 Align-a-Site: This device is different from all the other meters. It doesn’t
measure signal strength but, rather, helps you find a clear line-of-sight
view of the satellite. By using the Align-a-Site with the optional dish
174
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

mount you won’t even have to level out your tripod. If there’s a hole
through the leaves you’ll be able to find it with an Align-a-Site device.
Several of the dealers offer the Align-a-Site with their systems and it’s
available from the manufacturer at www.alignasite.com.
Whenever you set up and aim your satellite dish a couple of the readings that
you get from your pointing instruments indicate your cross-polarization and
co-polarization. These two readings, important because you’re both receiving
and transmitting a signal, are an indication of how well your dish is aimed. If
you’re aim is off by a little bit you could be causing interference for other
satellite users. Any interference caused by a user can result in action being
taken by the FCC against the satellite provider. For this reason, StarBand
requires all Manual-Flyer users to call their Consumer VSAT Automated
Commissioning System (CVACS) with their cross-pol and co-pol numbers.
Calling CVACS can be inconvenient — maybe impossible — if you’re in an
area outside cellular coverage. In these instances, since you should already
be online, it may be possible to send an e-mail to your dealer with the needed
information and ask them make the call to CVACS.
Getting a Self-Pointing VSAT Installed
Okay, do-it-yourself projects are great, but there’s something to be said for
ease and convenience. If dragging the dish out of storage and setting it up
each and every time you move doesn’t sound much like “convenient” Internet
access, then you might be in the market for a VSAT system that’s permanently
mounted on the roof of your coach. That said, I also understand that even if
you don’t jump for joy at the thought of manually deploying your dish on a
regular basis, you may still enjoy DIY projects — and even consider installing
your own self-pointing VSAT satellite Internet system.
Well, don’t consider that for too long; it’ll cut into the time you have available
for finding a qualified dealership with competent installation technicians. It’s
absolutely necessary to have this job done by a professional installer. Of
course, you could decide to become a dealer or installation technician your-
self (I figure the marketplace is far from saturated), but if you don’t want to
go that route, you’ll want to ferret out a good dealership.
Finding a dealer
MotoSAT, Ground Control and StarBand — the primary players in the self-
pointing-VSAT-system game — all maintain a large network of dealerships and
175
Chapter 9: Sky-High Wi-Fi

installers. If you choose, you can opt to purchase your system from them
directly — and have their technicians install it at their location. Without
hyperbole, I can say with confidence that your choice of dealership and
installation technician makes the difference between enjoying your invest-
ment and spending your days in search of elusive support.
While going directly to the source may be convenient for some, most find
themselves looking for a local dealer. You can begin your search for a rep-
utable dealer by visiting the corporate Web sites (where links to their dealer
networks are provided), or you can search sources such as the Yellow Pages
and World Wide Web. Another method of locating a reputable dealer is to
visit online RV-related forums. Here are some you might want to visit:
 DataStorm Users Forum: As you might guess by the name this forum’s
focused primarily on those who either use or are interested in using
units manufactured by either MotoSAT or Ground Control but there’s
also quite a number of folks posting that use other systems. Quite a few
dealers and installers of high reputation post regularly to the forum and,
believe it or not, so do the President of MotoSAT and the Chairman of
Ground Control. Think you might get your questions answered here?
Yeah, me too; they’re easily found by pointing your browser toward
www.datastormusers.com.
 StarBand Users Forum: Although the traffic here isn’t quite as heavy as
it might be in other forums, still it’s a good source of information. You
have to pay $15 to join the forum group — but (especially if you’re con-
sidering the purchase of a StarBand unit) the cost is minimal, consider-
ing the amount of information available to you. They’re located on the
Web at www.starbandusers.com.
 RV.Net Open Roads Forum: This forum is focused on the RV life more
generally but there is a well attended forum that deals with technology
and includes quite a lot of information regarding satellite Internet. Their
Web address is www.rv.net/forum/index.cfm.
Some of the most highly skilled, eminently qualified dealers and installation
technicians who specialize in self-pointing VSAT systems are themselves
hooked on the RV lifestyle. These “roving dealers” may well be in an area
near you — or may be able to schedule their travels to intersect with yours
at a given time. One such dealer, a frequent contributor to the DataStorm
Users forum, is Bill Adams of Internet Anywhere; his Web site address is
www.internetanywhere.us.
Getting support
The primary providers of satellite Internet seek to insulate their network-
operations personnel from the day-to-day drudgery of responding to customer
176
Part III: Bridging the Wireless Gap 

questions and problems. To meet these goals, they require their network of
VARs to handle the bulk of general support issues — and the VARs seek to
insulate themselves as well, relying on their VAR dealer networks to be the
first line of response for support-related issues.
For this reason, it’s even more important to be certain that the dealer you
choose is both competent and responsive. Both MotoSAT and Ground Control
(for example) offer well-staffed and responsive support systems, but if you
encounter difficulty, your first, best chance at getting up and running is likely
to come from the dealer that installed your system.
Another method of getting support-related questions answered is to visit one
of the user forums I discuss in the previous section, “Finding a dealer.”
Receiving TV, Too
Okay, a reflector dish designed to receive satellite TV can’t be used to provide
Internet access as well. But if you have a reflector dish designed to provide
Internet access, it can also receive satellite TV. Among the items necessary, in
addition to those used for Internet access, to receive simultaneous TV broad-
casts are the following:
 Satellite TV LNBF: The signal received from a satellite designed to provide
TV broadcasts is somewhat different than that of a signal carrying data.
 Mounting bracket: A combined mounting-bracket-and-LNBF is known as
a bird-on-a-wire (BOW). This bracket is attached to the feedhorn arm; the
LNBF is attached to the bracket. Universal mounting brackets allow easy
adjustment of the LNBF to access any available television satellite; dedi-
cated brackets are set to access one satellite in particular.
 Satellite TV receiver: Also known as an Integrated Receiver Decoder
(IRD), connected to both the LNBF and TV by coaxial cable; the IRD
decodes the signal received from the satellite and provides it to the set.
 Satellite TV subscription: A separate subscription to DISH Network or
DirecTV, whichever may be appropriate, is necessary.
The BOW is mounted on the feedhorn arm in a way that offsets the television
LNBF a few degrees east or west of center, as shown in Figure 9-4. The reason
for this offset position is that the satellites used for TV and Internet reside at
different locations in the southern sky. Since the reflector dish is pointed
directly at the satellite providing the Internet service, it follows that the satel-
lite providing the television signal will be positioned a few degrees to the east
or west of that satellite.
177
Chapter 9: Sky-High Wi-Fi

Clearly, the satellite you want to use for receiving television broadcasts
should be relatively close to the satellite you’re assigned to for Internet
access. So if you use a HughesNet satellite for Internet access, you’ll probably
have to subscribe to DirecTV and let them know to which HughesNet Internet
satellite you’re assigned. Likewise, if you’re a StarBand subscriber, a DISH
Network EchoStar satellite may be most compatible.
You can install the BOW, adding access to a television satellite, at any time.
You don’t have to install a BOW as part of your initial installation, but you may
want to run the necessary TV cabling then anyway. It saves you hassle if you
decide to add the BOW at a later date.

Securing Your
Information

In this part . . .
I
address the biggest concern most folks have surround-
ing wireless Internet connections: Security. (Even those
normally fun-loving sock puppets get serious about secu-
rity.) The three chapters included in this part help you
understand the potential threats you face as well as the
actions you can take to thwart the bad guys who seem
determined to abscond with your information, money, and
peace of mind. After reading Chapter 10, you’ll know about
the tools the bad guys use to invade your privacy — and
you’ll be armed with tools of your own to keep the invaders
at bay. Chapters 11 and 12 go a little deeper; after reading
them, you’ll know how to encrypt your data and how to
take control of a computer at your home or office while
you’re away from them both. You’ll also know why you
might want to take those actions — and if you want to
keep that to yourself, you’ll be able to.

Steps to Security

 Putting your info in a safe place
 Installing security applications
 Sending data via a secure tunnel
A
s wonderful as wireless Internet access is, it’s not without its problems,
and, at least in my humble opinion, the issue of security is the biggest
one of them all. Whenever you log on to a hotspot, no matter where that
hotspot is and no matter who operates it, your data and personal information
is open to attack. I’m not trying to scare you here; I’m just imploring you to
be aware that a potential threat exists.
When I log on to my wireless network at home, my data is protected because
I use several security measures that block the public from joining the net-
work. My data, just like at a hotspot, goes flying through the air and my com-
puters are all connected via the network, but only those authorized to join
the network have any possibility of accessing either the data I’m sending or
the data stored on my computers. Hotspots, because they’re open to the
public, can’t employ any of these security features.
In this chapter, I give you peace of mind — first, by helping you spot the
potential threats to your online security and second, by showing you ways
that you can stop information and identity thieves in their tracks. For exam-
ple, I tell you about several methods in use by information and identity
thieves to steal your data, and I give you specific ways to foil those attempts.

Identifying Security Threats
Several years ago, back in the days before widespread cellphone use, a lot of
people used to carry around prepaid phone cards for making long-distance
phone calls from payphones. Often, by carefully observing a person using
one of these cards and entering the card and PIN numbers on the (easily visi-
ble) payphone keypad, a thief could steal those numbers. As an added bonus,
if the card owner was recharging the card with a credit card, the thief might
also steal the credit card number.
People went to great lengths, after they were aware of the potential threat, to
cover up their calling and credit card numbers and hide their fingers when
dialing. A very similar problem now exists in public hotspots all over the
country. When you’re signing on to a network, especially for the first time,
thieves and scoundrels of all sorts might be able to get your credit card
number, your username, your password, your home address, your phone
number, and all sorts of personal information. And they can get this informa-
tion just by looking over your shoulder, watching your fingers on the key-
board, or scanning your bright and beautiful display screen.
Besides the above-captioned (and, admittedly, low-tech-but-effective) method
of gathering valuable information, today’s thieves have developed several
somewhat-higher-tech ways of procuring your personal information. The
methods most commonly used include the following:
 Using trickery: For years, con artists of every stripe have been tricking
people into handing over large sums of money, and these days, informa-
tion is money. I tell you more about a few of the methods used to steal
your info and ways to protect yourself from them in the “Beware of
Geeks Bearing Grifts” section of this chapter.
 Stealing your computer: If you’re a thief, what could be easier than just
stealing the entire computer. I tell you about ways to avoid getting your
laptop stolen — and how to protect your data even if it is stolen — in
the “Protecting Your Data” section of this chapter.
 Hacking into your laptop: By exploiting open or unlocked doors into
your computer, some thieves enter and steal your data out from under
your nose. I tell you about ways to lock your doors in the “Blocking the
Bad Guys with a Firewall” section.
 Intercepting wireless transmissions: Your information’s flying through
the air and, with the greatest of ease, it can be intercepted. Under the
heading “Employing a Virtual Private Network,” I tell you about services
that help you establish a securely encrypted tunnel through which your
info can travel safely.

Part IV: Securing Your Information 

Beware of Geeks Bearing Grifts
The first time I heard the term grift or grifter was in the 1990 movie, The
Grifters, starring Anjelica Huston, John Cusack, and Annette Bening. It’s a
movie I enjoyed, even though the principal characters were all con artists —
and, to the best of my recollection, all died horrible deaths.
A grift is a con and a grifter is a con artist. The fact that the grifters in the
movie all died horrific deaths hasn’t seemed to deter many from engaging in
this activity. All too many cons are perpetrated on the Web-browsing public
today. Some of them trick you, usually by e-mail, into volunteering personal
and financial information by masquerading as legitimate institutions; these
scams are commonly referred to as phishing. Others trick you into accepting
program applications, commonly known as spyware, which allow grifters to
gather information about you or redirect you to a fraudulent — but legiti-
mate-looking — Web site where, they hope, you enter personal information.
Variations of this grift are now referred to as pharming.
Avoiding the evil twin
Often referred to as a rogue hotspot, the phishing scam (or maybe it’s pharm-
ing, I’m not sure) known as the evil twin is run exclusively on hotspot users.
I’ve never experienced it at a truck stop or travel plaza, but I’m sure it’s been
tried more than a few times. The purpose of this grift is to gain access to
usernames, passwords, and in some cases, credit card numbers.
Here’s the way it works. A Wi-Fi hacker sits in the parking lot at a hotspot, or
even somewhere inside the facilities, and by mimicking the SSID, poses as a
legitimate hotspot. This person may even attempt to jam the actual hotspot
signal as well. When an unsuspecting patron logs on to the phony network,
the hacker serves up a sign-in page on which the user voluntarily and unwit-
tingly hands over her username and password — or, if the grifter’s really
lucky, a credit card number.
The hackers (depending on how far they’re willing to go) may even allow a
connection to the Internet where they’re in a position not only to intercept
unencrypted traffic, but also to access any files open to sharing. (I talk about
file sharing later in this chapter, in “Closing the file-sharing door.”)
183
Chapter 10: Taking Common-Sense Steps to Security

To help you avoid these rogue hotspots, take these protective steps:
 Don’t allow automatic connections. No matter what connection man-
agement tool you use, configure it so that an automatic connection to a
hotspot isn’t allowed. I show you how to do this in the “Disallowing
automatic hotspot connections” section that follows.
 Scrutinize the SSID list. If you see, at any hotspot, more than one SSID
that’s the same, or even similar, do some investigation prior to making a
connection. Ask a manager, for example, whether they’re running multi-
ple APs with the same or similar SSID. Not likely. I suppose it’s possible
they could be named the same, but it’s pretty dubious.
 Disallow ad-hoc connections. If you’re running Windows XP with
Service Pack 2, the ad-hoc mode is already disabled, but it doesn’t hurt
to take things a little farther and allow connections to infrastructure net-
works only. I show you how to do this later in this chapter in “Setting the
infrastructure-only mode.”
 Use a firewall. Even though a firewall won’t keep you from connecting to
a rogue hotspot, it will help protect you in case a connection is inadver-
tently made. I tell you more about firewalls under the heading “Blocking
the Bad Guys with a Firewall.”
Disallowing automatic hotspot connections
Unfortunately, once you make an initial connection to a hotspot via the
Wireless Zero Configuration utility, it then assumes (always a dangerous thing
to do) that you always want to make an automatic connection to that network
184
Part IV: Securing Your Information 
Why do they call it phishing?
Back in the ’70s, a guy by the name of John
Draper — using the alias Captain Crunch —
invented a device known as the blue box. The
blue box emitted a series of specially-pitched
tones, allowing the Captain to hack into tele-
phone systems. Captain Crunch, being very
clever, called this illegal activity phone phreak-
ing. Many consider Captain Crunch to be the
original hacker.
In the mid-’90s, a group of Internet grifters
began using e-mail lures to fraudulently obtain
the passwords and usernames of AOL sub-
scribers by tricking them into believing the
e-mails were sent by AOL. When the unsus-
pecting phish took the bait by following the links
in the e-mails, he was directed to phony Web
sites that gathered personal information.
Because the hackers were using e-mail lures,
they compared their activity to fishing, and
because these grifters idolized Captain Crunch,
they paid homage to the Captain by replacing
the letter f in fishing with a ph.

whenever its SSID is detected. To disallow automatic connections with the
WZC, take the following steps:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel, and double-click Network Connections
(in the Classic view of Windows XP).
The Network Connection window opens.
2. Right-click your connection, and click Properties, as shown in 
Figure 10-1.
The Wireless Network Connection Properties dialog box opens.
3. Click the Wireless Networks tab, as shown in Figure 10-2.
4. In the Preferred Networks area, click the network in question to high-
light it, and then click the Properties button.
This brings up the Properties dialog box for the selected network.
5. Click the Connection tab, and clear the check mark for the Connect
When This Network Is in Range option.
6. Click OK in all open dialog boxes.
Figure 10-1:
Select your

185
Chapter 10: Taking Common-Sense Steps to Security

It’s a bit easier to maintain an “ask before connecting” status with most other
types of connection clients. For example, with the JiWire connection tool, you
just choose the “Save, but Prompt Me to Connect” radio button the first time
you make a connection to a new hotspot. (I discuss this utility a bit more in
Chapter 6, and later in this chapter in the “Connecting securely through
SpotLock” section.) With other connection utilities, such as the Buffalo con-
nection client, you simply fail to save the profile. In most cases, you can
choose to edit a saved profile so you’re asked about making a connection to
any hotspot.
Setting the infrastructure-only mode
When you’re connecting to a hotspot, you want to make your connection to
the hotspot’s access point, and you don’t want others to be able to connect
to your laptop. Some hackers running the evil twin scam are set up as an ad
hoc or peer-to-peer network. Also, in some cases, your laptop — especially if
you’re not running Windows XP with SP2 — might begin broadcasting the
SSID of the network it was most recently connected with in an attempt to
make an ad hoc connection with any nearby computers.
If this situation occurs, you’re open to the threat that some low-life scoundrel
is set up to listen for laptops begging for a connection. The hacker hears the
connection cry, creates an ad-hoc network using the SSID that’s being broad-
cast by your laptop, and makes the connection. This could be bad — espe-
cially if you haven’t yet taken all, or most, of the security measures I’ve
outlined in this chapter. Fortunately, there’s an easy fix for this problem —
just follow these steps:
Figure 10-2:

1. Choose Start➪Control Panel, and double-click Network Connections
(in the Classic view of Windows XP).
The Network Connection window opens.
2. Right-click your connection, and click Properties.
The Wireless Network Connection Properties dialog box opens.
3. Click the Wireless Networks tab (refer to Figure 10-2).
4. In the Preferred Networks area, click the Advanced button.
The Advanced dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10-3.
5. Select the Access Point (Infrastructure) Networks Only radio button.
6. Click the Close button in the Advanced dialog box, and click OK.
Using a firewall also helps to eliminate this threat. I tell you about firewalls
later in this chapter in “Blocking the Bad Guys with a Firewall.”
Uncovering hidden extensions
Hidden extensions are another method that the unscrupulous use to trick us
into installing a malicious program application on our PCs. One way they do
this is by sending an e-mail or instant message with a photo or other attach-
ment that has a benign file extension such as .jpg. What you don’t know —
because Windows, by default, shows only the first extension — is that the
filename might actually be something like photo.jpg.exe, or friendly-
memo.txt.exe. You open the attachment, and suddenly you’re the victim 
of a virus that performs any number of unwanted — possibly dangerous —
tasks. This trickery doesn’t seem as prevalent today as it has been in the 
Figure 10-3:
The
Advanced
dialog box.
187
Chapter 10: Taking Common-Sense Steps to Security

past — because, of course, you know to be wary of attachments that you’re
not expecting, even if they’re from people you know, and to never open
e-mails or attachments from people you don’t know. But it’s relatively easy to
expose hidden extensions, so you might as well do so.
1. Click Start➪Control Panel, and (in the Classic view in Windows XP)
double-click Folder Options.
2. Click the View tab.
3. Clear the check mark in the Hide Extensions for Known File Types
check box, as shown in Figure 10-4.
4. Click Apply.
5. Click OK.
This eliminates a great deal of the problems, but a few extensions, such as
.pif and .shc, might remain hidden. To display all extensions, all the time,
you have to edit the Registry.
Going into the Registry and changing anything can cause catastrophic prob-
lems. So even though this Registry edit is really easy to do, the potential
exists to make a slight error that would be irreversible. Directions for editing
the Registry follow, with the disclaimer that you do this at your own peril.
Figure 10-4:

188
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

Because a danger exists, before making any system or Registry change, be
sure that you set a system-restore point so you can revert to the settings that
existed prior to your fiddling with stuff — providing you haven’t done any-
thing so catastrophic that you’re looking at the Blue Screen of Death. (In that
case, a restore point can’t help you — because you can’t get to it.)
In order to create a system-restore point, choose Start➪All Programs➪
Accessories➪System Tools➪System Restore. With the System Restore
window open, select Create a Restore Point, and click Next. Enter a name for
your restore point — I usually name it something descriptive, like Registry
Change — and click Create. The date is automatically added, and you can
click Close. Now you’ve got a point to fall back on where you know every-
thing worked.
Now you’re ready to edit the Registry. Here goes:
1. Choose Start➪Run, and type regedit in the text box.
2. Click Open.
The Registry Editor opens.
3. Choose Edit➪Find.
4. Enter NeverShowExt in the text box, as shown in Figure 10-5.
5. Click Find Next.
The first occurrence of the phrase NeverShowExt is highlighted.
6. Press the Delete key.
Answer in the affirmative when asked whether you’re sure you want to
delete the item — and leave your cursor in that position.
7. Press F3 to search for the next occurrence, and repeat Steps 5 and 6
until the search is completed.

Chapter 10: Taking Common-Sense Steps to Security

8. Close the Registry Editor, and you’re done.
From this moment forward, no one will be able to slip a file with a
hidden extension under your nose. Now, if you see a file that has two
extensions, such as FunPhoto.jpg.exe — especially if the last exten-
sion is .exe or .pif — you know that this file is best deleted.
Antivirus software, which I talk about later in this chapter in the “Vaccinating
against viruses” section, often includes an e-mail scanning utility that may
identify and eliminate e-mails carrying viruses under the cover of hidden
extensions.
Protecting against drive-by spyware
After purchasing my first laptop — which was the first PC I’d ever owned — 
I just absolutely, positively, couldn’t wait to get myself connected to the
Internet. Being somewhat cheap, and believing that most salespeople will try
to sell you lots of stuff you don’t need, I didn’t bother buying any of the anti-
spyware or antivirus software offered to me — and walked confidently out
the door, leaving a sea of shaking heads behind me. What a fool I was.
After browsing the Web for a few days, I started noticing that I had windows
popping up all over the place whenever I opened my browser, and I was often
directed to Web sites I hadn’t asked to be directed to. After doing a little
research, I found out that my browser had been hijacked, and I was the
victim of one or more drive-by installations of spyware. Immediately, I down-
loaded an anti-spyware utility. After running it, I was stunned by the amount
of junk that I’d picked up just by visiting Web sites. To protect yourself from
these drive-by installs, you need to purposely install some anti-spyware and
antivirus utilities. (I tell you more about antivirus software later in this chap-
ter in “Vaccinating against viruses.”)
Fortunately, there are great numbers of anti-spyware utilities available for
download, and in fact, I now use more than one. Some spyware applications
highjack your browser and redirect you to sites you never knew existed, or
by monitoring your Web usage, serve up more and more ads. Others, known
as surveillance spyware, can actually monitor and record every movement
you make on the Web. Some surveillance-spyware applications log your key-
strokes — and if you use VoIP (I tell you more about VoIP in Chapter 13), even
your conversations are open to monitoring and recording. This problem, of
course, isn’t limited to those using hotspots, but I’d be remiss if I didn’t men-
tion a solution to such a widespread security threat.

Part IV: Securing Your Information 

Among my favorite anti-spyware programs, in no particular order, are
 Ad-Aware SE Personal: Produced by Lavasoft, this highly acclaimed util-
ity is offered at the attractive price of free. The cynics among you will
note that the free version doesn’t do real-time scanning or perform auto-
matic updates, but for something that’s free, it does a whole lot of good
stuff and does it pretty well. If you want the full-featured version you can
always upgrade. It’s available from Lavasoft at
www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware
To get the free version, go to that Web address and click the
Download.com link on the top-right side of the page.
 Spyware Doctor: Another utility, produced by PC Tools Software, is
highly thought of by reviewers in print and on the Web, but it’s not free.
(Although, it is reasonably priced.) This utility does a good job of pro-
tecting you from the most serious threats, such as key logging, and at
around thirty bucks, it’s definitely not overpriced. It’s available at
www.pctools.com/spyware-doctor
 SpyBot Search & Destroy: This is produced as freeware, which means
that the developer would really appreciate it if you’d donate a few 
bucks to the cause, providing you like the utility. This is another well-
thought-of application. It can be maddeningly slow, but it seems to do
the job. It’s available from Safer Networking at
www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html
 CounterSpy: For about $20, this award-winning utility is available from
Sunbelt Software. One of the biggest reasons you might want to consider
CounterSpy is that they update their definitions through three different
information sources, including Microsoft. It’s available for download at

 Windows Defender: I haven’t used this product, but Windows Defender
(the second beta version of Windows AntiSpyware) has been remarkably
well-reviewed by most of the major PC magazines, so you might want to
give it a whirl. It’s available at
www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx
The foregoing isn’t, by any stretch of the imagination, a complete and com-
prehensive list, but every one of the utilities has been well-reviewed and
should make a good jumping off spot for you in your search for the perfect
anti-spyware utility.
191
Chapter 10: Taking Common-Sense Steps to Security

Not all anti-spyware utilities are what they claim to be. Some actually install
their own spyware. If you choose to ignore those utilities I’ve listed and go
out in search of a utility on your own, you might want to visit a Web site
known as Spyware Warrior. Visit their Rogue/Suspect Anti-Spyware page,
where they list many of these malicious programs. This site can be found at
www.spywarewarrior.com, and they also offer other valuable information
about spyware and anti-spyware.
Understanding EULAs
These are otherwise known as End User License Agreements. Whenever most
folks in pursuit of a desired program, music, or video download see the EULA
(End User License Agreement), they just click the I Agree button and con-
tinue on. Even though this won’t cause you any problems most of the time,
you should be aware that you might be agreeing — especially with some of
the less scrupulous music-download sites — to download not only music but
also some program applications that are spyware.
If the integrity of the site or company that you’re downloading any type of file
or program application from is in question, make sure you actually read the
EULA (pronounced YOO-la, if you’re wondering) before you continue the
download. Even well-known sites include other marketing “resources” that
can gobble up space and memory resources on your computer. So it’s good
to read any EULA.
If a EULA asks you to accept a program application as a condition of the file
or program you desire, do a quick Web search to find out what it is and what
others are saying about it before continuing. Or just play it safe and abort the
download at the first hint of impropriety.
Protecting Your Data
By incorporating some of the measures previously mentioned, you’ve gone a
long way toward protecting yourself from outside intrusion. But you’re not
done yet. A whole lot of your personal information resides in the files and
folders stored on your laptop hard drive, and it needs to be protected too.
Locking up your laptop
This might seem a bit simplistic, but you just can’t believe how many times,
especially in coffeehouses, I’ve walked by an unoccupied table where some-
one has left a laptop sitting unguarded and unprotected. Usually it’s booted
192
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

up and a program or two has been opened — all a thief has to do is put it in
standby mode, close the lid, and wander off with a nice laptop full of enough
personal information to ruin the life of the person who just took a little too
long in the restroom and trusted the patrons just a little bit too much.
Fortunately, several manufacturers provide laptop locks that make it much
more difficult for a thief to abscond with the valuables. Most of the newer lap-
tops have a security slot into which a cable lock can be attached. They do
vary quite a bit in price, but even if you can slow somebody down for a few
minutes or make them more conspicuous, I think a lock is a no-brainer. Here’s
a fair representation of what’s available:
 Kensington: This is possibly the most-recognized name in laptop-locking
security, but they also manufacture a wide line of other products. My
new laptop came equipped with a Kensington security slot, making 
lock installation a snap — literally. Kensington offers a wide range of
locks, and they can be found on the Web by browsing to http://us.
kensington.com.
 LapLocker: Manufactured by Think Products, this lock is more expen-
sive than almost any other lock I’ve seen, but it includes more features
than any other laptop locking mechanism I know of. To me, the biggest
plus this lock offers is a table-top clamp, making it possible to secure
your laptop to any desk or table. The lock also includes a lid lock that
keeps the laptop open. A thief would be pretty conspicuous walking off
with an open laptop. Their Web address is www.laplocker.com.
 Defcon Notebook Lock: Targus offers both keyed and combination locks
similar in design to those made by Kensington. They also offer an alarm
system equipped with a motion sensor that raises a clatter if your laptop
is even moved. You can find them by browsing to www.targus.com.
Besides locking up your laptop, don’t forget to secure your laptop case and
any items you carry around in it. These items aren’t as attractive to the aver-
age thief, but you never know what someone might deem worth stealing.
Password protecting your laptop
I don’t know about you, but my whole identity in bits and pieces is stored on
my laptop. Well, let’s say that the unthinkable has happened, and I’m the
victim of a clever thief. My laptop’s long gone and not likely to be recovered.
In this case, I definitely need to cancel credit cards, notify banks, move
money, or any number of things I can’t even imagine right now. I need time to
do these things before somebody figures out how to get this information off
my hard drive. This is where password protection can save the day.
193
Chapter 10: Taking Common-Sense Steps to Security

I know that using passwords can be a hassle, but believe me, if you find your-
self in a panic, trying to cancel accounts prior to becoming the proud pur-
chaser of somebody else’s Harley-Davidson motorcycle or a whole bunch of
other stuff you’ll never see, you’ll be glad you went to the trouble to create
strong passwords and put up with the hassle of actually using them.
The primary area where you need to use a password to protect your laptop is
in the user accounts, which you see on the welcome screen. You want to be
sure that, if anyone does get your laptop, they can’t just log on to your
laptop. If a password’s required, you’ve slowed them considerably. If it’s a
highly effective password, you may have them blocked out for good.
You should also change the way users log on to the laptop. The default
method is to log on from the welcome screen. All this requires is that a user
choose their account and enter a password. By using the classic logon
screen, users are also required to enter a username and then follow up with a
password (provided you’ve logged off). It’s likely that the thief stealing your
laptop has little idea what your username might be. In order to switch your
logon screen to the classic view, follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪User Accounts➪User Accounts. 
(Or double-click User Accounts if you use the Control Panel’s 
classic view.)
The User Accounts dialog box opens.
2. Under Pick a Task, click Change the Way Users Log On or Off.
3. Clear the check mark next to Use the Welcome Screen.
Both check marks disappear and the Use Fast User Switching option is
grayed out.
4. Click Apply Options, and close the User Accounts window.
Okay, now you need to develop a password that’s easy for you to remember
and difficult for someone else to figure out.
Creating effective passwords
If a password’s going to be effective, it needs to be something that’s impossi-
ble to guess. In other words, it needs to be more imaginative than $u$1eQ.
Consider the following when working up a strong password:
 Length: By making your password at least eight to ten characters long,
you considerably reduce the chances that anyone can ever hack it.
 Character combination: Use as many different characters as possible. If
part of your password is a number, for example, hit the Shift key a
couple times when entering those numbers, changing them to symbols.
194
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

 Obvious choices: Don’t use your birthday, your name, your favorite
team or player’s name, your dog’s name, your favorite TV character’s
name . . . you get the idea. As a matter of fact, you shouldn’t even use a
word that’s in a dictionary, even if it’s in a foreign dictionary. There exist
several hackers’ applications designed to break passwords that are
based on dictionary words, even if they’re spelled backwards or incor-
porate a number or two.
 Memorable phrase: I love the movie Casablanca. The popularly 
remembered phrase from that film is “Play it again, Sam,” but what Rick
actually said is “Play it, Sam. You played it for her; you can play it for
me.” By using the first letters of each word, I’ve got the password
PiSYpifhycpifm. By substituting a couple of numbers and symbols for
the letters, I could come up with the password: P1$Ypifhycp!fm.
The password I created using the infamous phrase uttered by Rick at the Café
Americain meets all the criteria for a strong password: It’s fourteen charac-
ters long, it uses a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase),
it’s not an obvious word, and it’s not a word found in the dictionary. (But it’s
just an example — and now it’s published in a book — so I’m sure I don’t
have to tell you not to use it for real.) When you’ve created a password of
your own that you think is pretty good, you can check it out with available
online password-checking tools. The Microsoft Web site, for example, offers
one such tool at
www.microsoft.com/athome/security/privacy/password_checker.mspx
If the phrase you come up with is too short, just add a few easily remembered
numbers and symbols. For example, if you want to use Bond, James Bond or
I’ll be back, you can add the last four digits of your social security number and
the three symbols that correspond with your area code. If your social security
number is 123-45-6789 and your area code is 425, the password might be
Ibb6789$@%. Easy to remember and nearly impossible to crack.
Guarding your passwords
My memory being what it is, I’m always worried that I might forget a pass-
word, and that’s why I suggest using a password based on a phrase you can
easily remember. In general, it’s a bad idea to keep your passwords anyplace
other than in your head or in a locked safe. I know some people put them in
password-protected files, but I don’t recommend it.
A couple other things to keep in mind concerning passwords:
 Don’t give your password to anyone. Especially if you’re asked for your
password in an e-mail. Some Internet scammers engage in the act of
phishing for information via e-mail: They send you a legitimate-looking
e-mail from your bank, credit card provider, eBay, or PayPal, asking for
information such as your username and password. Legitimate companies
never ask for this information via e-mail.
195
Chapter 10: Taking Common-Sense Steps to Security

 Don’t use the same password for everything. Use a different password
for each account you log on to. If you just can’t remember that many
passwords, at least use three or four different ones and use your 
computer-logon password only for that purpose.
 Don’t use any Save Password options. Internet Explorer (IE), Mozilla
Firefox, and some Web sites ask whether you want to save your user-
name and password. The only time to take advantage of this option is
when you know for sure that unauthorized access to the site can in no
way result in the user gaining any personal information about you.
Obviously, any site from which you’ve ever purchased goods — or 
financial and related sites — are no place to take this risk.
Storing your passwords
You should never keep a list of passwords anywhere near your laptop or on
your person. I don’t recommend storing your passwords in a file on your
laptop or PDA either, but there are a few utilities available that store pass-
words under an encrypted lock. One such utility, developed by DataViz, is
Passwords Plus. (See www.dataviz.com.) I’ve used this utility for almost a
year now, after downloading a free “Lite” version of it early last year. The free
version’s not available anymore, but a free, 30-day trial version is.
Passwords Plus offers a lot of features, including the ability to generate
extremely effective passwords, and requires that you remember only one
master password to be used in gaining access to the utility. Versions are
available for Windows, Mac, and Palm operating systems.
Closing the file-sharing door
It’s possible — not likely, but possible — that while you’re happily browsing
the Web at a hotspot, a clever hacker could access your laptop via the Guest
account. If this unlikely event were to occur, it’s also possible that your files
might be — due to something called Simple File Sharing — open to the
person browsing your system. If you’re running Windows XP Pro, closing this
back door is as easy as following these steps:
1. Choose Start➪My Computer➪Tools➪Folder Options.
The Folder Options dialog box opens.
2. Click the View tab.
3. Click Advanced Settings.
4. Clear the Simple File Sharing check box.
5. Click Apply, and click OK to close the Folder Options dialog box. You
can then close My Computer.
196
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

If (like me) you’re running Windows XP Home Edition, the previous option
isn’t available, so the best you can do is to use the Make Private option in
each folder’s properties. For each folder you want to protect, perform the fol-
lowing steps:
1. Right-click the folder.
2. Choose Properties.
The folder’s Properties dialog box opens.
3. Click the Sharing tab.
4. Select the Make this Folder Private check box.
5. Click Apply, and then click OK.
If you’re using a firewall, there’s almost no chance that anyone can log on to
your computer while you’re using a hotspot without the firewall stopping the
attack and notifying you of the attempt. I tell you more about firewalls later in
this chapter, in the “Blocking the Bad Guys with a Firewall” section.
197
Chapter 10: Taking Common-Sense Steps to Security
Using separate storage for sensitive info
If the worst case scenario occurs, in which your
laptop is stolen or your hard drive fails, I assume
that you have at least a few files on your hard
drive that you’d really want. I have several types
of files I’d like to be able to recover, including
my music files, e-mail addresses, bookmarks to
various Web sites, photos, program applica-
tions, and bank and tax files. You can back up
your files to one of several types of external
storage. Among the most popular are
 Hard disk drive: You can find good mobile
units available in storage capacities rang-
ing from 2GB to 60GB. Iomega is a leader in
the field, but others make these drives as
well, including Sony, Seagate, and IOGear.
These drives often come with a utility to
help you create your backups.
 CD or DVD: If your laptop has a CD-RW or
DVD-RW drive, you can burn backed up
information to one of these discs. CDs can
store about 700MB and DVDs about 4.5GB.
The new Blu-ray technology will increase
DVD storage capacity to as much as 27GB.
 USB flash drive: These little devices (about
the size of a lighter) plug in to a USB port,
and you can drag and drop files into them.
Get a large one (a gigabyte or more) for
storing your files. You’ll use up that space
faster than you think.
Another choice is to use an online service, but
when you’re using a hotspot, they’re not so hot
because you need to upload the files you’re
saving. Because hotspots limit the upload band-
width, this could take quite a lot of time and
slow down everyone using the hotspot.
If you burn files to CD or DVD, you can use your
computer’s CD burning utility for some files, but
for a full computer backup, consider a third-
party backup utility. If you’re using CDs, DVDs,
or a USB flash drive, look for a utility that saves
files in a format that’s easy to access, such as
.zip files.

Vaccinating against viruses
Are you more likely to get a cold when the only people you interact with are
your own family members, or when you spend your days mingling with large
groups of strange people? Yeah, well, if your kids are in grade school, hanging
out at home isn’t safe either, but you get the point. Vaccinating your com-
puter against viruses is important if you’re using it only in your home or
office, but imperative if you’re taking your computer out to play in public.
Plenty of virus protection programs are available, so you won’t have any
trouble finding one that does the job. But purchasing and downloading a util-
ity is only half the battle. You must also keep your utility up to date. Every
antivirus utility worth its salt offers updates; some even offer to download
the updates automatically. If you fail to update regularly and often, then your
antivirus utility becomes obsolete and nearly useless in no time flat.
A few of the better-known and highly rated virus-protection programs also
come bundled in complete Internet-security suites. Here’s a short list of some
top-notch antivirus programs available to you:
 Trend Micro PC-cillin: This highly rated antivirus product includes a
personal firewall. This utility also monitors your wireless connection
and notifies you if someone is making an attempt to connect to your PC.
You can check out all the features and benefits by browsing to
www.trendmicro.com/en/home/us/personal.htm.
 AVG Anti-virus: Developed by Grisoft, this well-reviewed utility is
offered to private individuals (that’s you and me) for the unbelievably
low price of free. Being cheap, I use this utility, and at least in my opin-
ion, it does a good job. If you need a utility for business or commercial
use they also offer a reasonably priced utility that’s full of features the IT
guys find useful. You can find the free utility at
http://free.grisoft.com/doc/1.
 McAfee VirusScan: McAfee is one of the best-known names in Internet
security, and VirusScan is both an antivirus and an anti-spyware utility.
The only drawback that I’ve seen is that it doesn’t actively block the
type of browser hijacking that either redirects you to unwanted and un-
requested sites or serves up behaviorally targeted ads. McAfee also bun-
dles this utility in a full Internet security suite that includes a firewall
and spam blocker. You can find this utility at www.mcafee.com/us.
 Norton AntiVirus: Developed by Symantec, this highly regarded utility,
which also includes anti-spyware capability, is available as a standalone
product or in a full Internet security suite that includes a firewall. The
antivirus utility blocks spam and checks outgoing e-mail for viruses as
well. The Symantec Web site can be found at www.symantec.com/
index.htm.
198
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

Note that, with most antivirus utilities, the purchase price is actually a sub-
scription that must be renewed on a yearly basis. The reason: New and better
viruses are being dreamed up daily, so your utility has to be updated regu-
larly for the life of your laptop. Because the people who do this are trying to
provide not only safety but an income for themselves and their families, they
make the understandable request that they be paid for their efforts.
Using Built-in Security Features
“There is no need to sally forth, for it remains true that those things which
make us human are, curiously enough, always close at hand. Resolve, then,
that on this very ground, with small flags waving and tiny blasts of tiny
trumpets, we shall meet the enemy, and not only may he be ours, he may 
be us.”
— Walt Kelly
This quote is attributed to Walt Kelly, the author of the Pogo comic strip, 
and was eventually shortened to: “We have met the enemy and he is us.” It
describes to a tee the purpose of the built-in security features in Windows XP.
It’s there to save us from an apathetic, oh-I’m-probably-fine attitude toward
securing our systems from attack — and to save us from any seeming inabil-
ity to avoid unsafe Internet-related activities. The XP features constantly
remind us when security is lax. There aren’t a lot of security features built in
to Windows XP with SP2, but what is available is a whole bunch better than
what was available in earlier Windows operating system iterations. The major
features are
 Firewall: This is one of the biggest improvements made with SP2. It
lacks a few features that, I think, are essential, but this one provides
some protection from outside intrusion at least until you install a full-
featured firewall.
 Drive-by download blocking: This works at least in Internet Explorer,
and IE now blocks pop-ups, too. Well, no pop-up blocker squashes them
all, but the IE browser included with SP2 does a darn good job — and
you don’t need to install another toolbar. Drive-by downloads are also
foiled, and instead of automatically allowing a download, an information
dialog box opens, giving you an option of continuing or cancelling. (Read
more about this subject in the “Protecting against drive-by spyware” sec-
tion earlier in this chapter.)
 Unsafe attachment blocking: This targets the primary way computers
get infected with viruses, worms, and other bad stuff — that is, folks
opening e-mail attachments from strangers. Some of these attachments
199
Chapter 10: Taking Common-Sense Steps to Security

may seem benign, and because they hide the .exe or .pif extension,
people open them and get nasty computer colds. Outlook Express
reduces this potential threat, and the security blanket is also thrown
over Windows Messenger. (I talk about uncovering hidden extensions in
the cleverly named “Uncovering hidden extensions” section earlier in
this chapter.)
Using Windows Security Center
The centerpiece of the Windows XP with SP2 security enhancements is the
Windows Security Center. Its primary purpose is to badger you into actually
doing something about security-related issues, as well as to open avenues 
for defending yourself against attack. To open the Security Center, choose
Start➪Control Panel➪Security Center (or, in some versions, Start➪Settings➪
Control Panel➪Security Center).
The Windows Security Center monitors three areas, as shown in Figure 10-6:
 Firewall: If you’ve got the Windows firewall enabled, the first status indi-
cator is green. If the Windows firewall is disabled — or if a third-party
firewall that’s not recognized is installed — the indicator is red and you
see a Recommendations button.
 Automatic updates: Windows automatically downloads and (if you so
choose) installs important operating-system updates. If you have this
feature enabled, the status indicator is green. If not, the indicator is red
and the Recommendations button appears.
 Virus protection: Providing you have an antivirus utility recognized by
Windows XP that’s running and up-to-date, the status indicator is green.
If it’s a utility that isn’t recognized, one that needs to be updated, or you
don’t have virus protection installed, the indicator is red, and — you
guessed it — the Recommendations button appears.
When you click the Recommendations button, a dialog box corresponding to
that feature opens, such as the one for firewalls shown in Figure 10-7. If you
don’t have a firewall, you can click the Enable Now button. But if you’ve
installed a third-party firewall, such as ZoneAlarm or Norton, you want to dis-
able the Windows firewall. Doing so may cause the Security Center to open a
warning notice each time you boot your laptop. These warnings don’t cause
any problems, but because they’re annoying, you want to let Windows know
what’s going on. Place a check mark in the box indicating that you have a 
firewall solution you’ll monitor yourself. Click OK, and you notice that 
the firewall-status indicator changes to yellow.
200

If you don’t have an antivirus utility installed, you can click the Virus
Protection Recommendations button. The two recommendations are

Chapter 10: Taking Common-Sense Steps to Security

Program, followed by the clickable link How? If you click How?, a Web page
opens and offers several antivirus software choices. Because you’re a
Microsoft XP user, these come with extended trial periods — mostly three
months or more (at least one offers a one-year trial). I discuss virus software
in more detail in “Vaccinating against viruses” earlier in this chapter.
If you already have an antivirus utility but Windows doesn’t recognize it,
place a check mark in the box indicating you have a virus protection solution
that you’ll monitor yourself. The status indication changes to yellow and
(even though it’s clearly not happy about it) the Security Center stops bug-
ging you about your security status.
At the bottom of the Windows Security Center screen are links to the Windows
Firewall, Automatic Updates, and Internet Options configuration dialog boxes.
Click any one of them and you can configure — or reconfigure — your current
settings for those security features.
Keeping your operating system up-to-date
I’ve put this Windows Security Center feature under its own heading because
keeping your operating system updated is one of the most important things
you can do to guarantee the continued health of your system. The easiest
method of ensuring your operating system is kept up-to-date is to schedule
automatic updates. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Open the Windows Security Center, and click the Automatic Updates
link at the bottom of the page.
The Automatic Updates dialog box opens and offers you the opportunity
of scheduling the day of the week and the time at which the utility will
check for, download, and install Windows updates. For any number of
reasons, you may prefer to choose the automatic downloads but not the
automatic installation.
You may prefer to be notified that updates are available without
enabling any automatic features. That’s fine, but for the life of me, I can’t
imagine why anyone would completely disable or ignore this security
tool.
2. After you’ve made your selections, click Apply.
3. Click OK.
Your settings are updated to correspond with your wants and needs.
Another very similar automatic update, known as Microsoft Update, can be
set up through the Windows Security Center, and is of interest to anyone who
runs not only Windows XP, but also other Microsoft program applications
202
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

(such as Microsoft Office). Once enabled, Microsoft Update operates in
exactly the same way that Windows Update does. If you’re running Microsoft
programs released earlier than 2003, however, you should make sure you’ve
got your installation CDs handy. That’s because (at least the first time you
perform updates) the wizard will probably ask for file locations.
Here’s how to set up the Microsoft Updates:
1. Click Start➪All Programs➪Windows Update.
The Windows Update welcome page opens in Internet Explorer.
2. Select and click the Microsoft Update link and follow the prompts.
You might have to install an ActiveX plug-in, and you’ll be asked to con-
figure your updates as either Express or Custom.
It’s always a good idea to point your browser periodically to either Windows
or Microsoft Update to check for any updates you might want to download
and install that aren’t included in the Express configuration.
Blocking the Bad Guys with a Firewall
A firewall might be considered your first line of defense in Internet security. A
lot of the issues I deal with in the previous sections can be made moot if
you’re using a good firewall. Firewalls do pretty much what the name indi-
cates: They keep the danger outside a solid door of protection that’s open
only to those you invite in, and some firewalls keep the bad guys corralled so
they can’t do any damage.
Because a good firewall is the first line of defense when you’re online, either
at home or at a hotspot, you might be wondering why I bring it up so late in
the chapter. Well, even though firewalls do a good job, they’re not foolproof.
If I told you about firewalls right away, you might rely entirely on a firewall —
and fail to take any of the other security measures I tell you about. That
would be a mistake; no matter how good your firewall is, it’s possible that it
might be breached. Not likely — but definitely possible.
So, you may be asking yourself: Because Windows XP has a firewall already
installed, why would I want to go to the trouble of installing a different one?
That’s a fair question. The answer is that, even though the Windows Security
Center does include a firewall, it lacks some features that other, third-party
firewalls may include. Specifically, the Windows firewall doesn’t block out-
bound traffic. You may not think that’s a big deal, especially because you’re
concerned about intrusions, but in reality, it’s a very big deal.
203
Chapter 10: Taking Common-Sense Steps to Security

If, somehow — even after installing a firewall and virus protection, setting up
anti-spyware, closing doors, and locking doors — you still manage to get a
computer infection, your computer might be making outbound connections
you know nothing about. A firewall that detects outbound traffic can corral
that traffic, notify you that it’s been blocked, and ask you whether you want
to allow or disallow the traffic.
Of course, blocking inbound traffic is equally, if not more, important. The
Windows firewall does a decent job of that, but again, some third-party fire-
wall solutions are a bit better than the Windows firewall at this task, too.
Finding a firewall
Many Internet security suites bundle a firewall with their virus protection. In
most cases, these firewalls do the job at least as well as the Windows firewall;
because most of them also block outbound traffic, you could say they do the
job better. If you decide you want virus protection and a firewall from two dif-
ferent companies, each offers a standalone firewall as well. (You can find a list
of these companies in “Vaccinating against viruses,” earlier in this chapter.)
Another developer, ZoneAlarm, offers a very good, standalone firewall in a
basic, free version or a full-featured, paid version. I’m particularly enamored
of the ZoneAlarm firewall. Probably because (as I said) I’m basically cheap
and one of the versions is free, it’s the first firewall I downloaded and used. It
complements my free AVG virus protection quite nicely. ZoneAlarm is devel-
oped by ZoneLabs, and you can find it by pointing your browser toward
www.zonealarm.com. Feel free to exercise your right to purchase the full-
featured version, if you like — it’s got some very useful bells and whistles.
Free utilities almost never include the full-featured capabilities that are avail-
able in the paid or subscription versions. If the free versions meet your needs
(or if you’ve already got access to similar features through other programs or
utilities), then by all means consider the free versions. If, however, you think
you need features not included in the free versions, don’t compromise your
security just to save a few bucks. It can cost you in the end.
Setting up a personal firewall
Most firewalls, after they’re downloaded and installed, take some time to set
up and configure, because as you use different programs and utilities in con-
junction with the Internet, you have to tell the firewall which activities to
allow and which to disallow. This takes some time, but after it’s done, every-
thing begins to hum along quietly in the background; you can rest assured
that after all your efforts, you’ve become a safer surfer.
204
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

If you download ZoneAlarm, for example, you have two ways you can config-
ure it so your programs can access the Internet. The easiest way is to let
ZoneAlarm ask you, each time a new program attempts to access the
Internet, whether you want to allow access for that program, as shown in
Figure 10-8.
If the program is one, like Windows Messenger or Internet Explorer, that you
know requires constant Internet access, select the Remember this Setting
check box, and click Allow. That’s all there is to it. From that time forward,
the program will have access to the Internet.
The other way to configure the firewall is by adding programs, one by one, to
the ZoneAlarm control panel. To accomplish this task, follow these steps:
1. Open the ZoneAlarm control panel.
2. Select Program Control.
3. Click the Programs tab, shown in Figure 10-9.
4. Click the Add button at the bottom of the screen.
The Add Programs window opens, allowing you to choose a program
application to add to the control panel. You can add only one program
application at a time.
5. Choose the program you want to add, and click Open.
You have to drill down to the executable file you want to add to the con-
trol panel. This might require you to go through two or three screens.
After you’ve selected the proper file, it’s added to the Control Panel and
shows question marks to the right of it.

6. Back on the Programs tab, for the program you just added, click the
question mark in the Internet column and click Allow, as shown in
Figure 10-10.
The first two question marks change to green check marks, indicating
they’re cleared for Internet access.
Only a few program applications need to be cleared as a server, so it’s gener-
ally best to leave the two rightmost columns alone. Because question marks
are showing in those columns, ZoneAlarm asks for your approval if an appli-
cation requests access to the Internet as a server.
It takes a bit of time to get any firewall — especially one that monitors out-
bound traffic — configured to the point that it’s not alerting you about one
thing or another. But after you’ve configured the permissions for the bulk of
the programs you normally use, you should be able to relax, confident that
your laptop is well protected.

Part IV: Securing Your Information 

A firewall can sometimes cause unintended problems when you’re attempting
to make a connection at a hotspot. If you’re having problems getting online,
try disabling your firewall just until you establish the connection. If you —
with the firewall disabled — make the connection, you should immediately
enable your firewall and contact the firewall developer’s support staff, telling
them of the problem. It’s probably a simple configuration issue that they can
easily resolve.
Employing a Virtual Private Network
You might have heard or read the term virtual private network in various
places. When I began reading about VPNs, they were usually mentioned in
conjunction with business travelers trying to connect securely to their corpo-
rate network. It always sounded like a great way to stay safe if you were at a
hotspot, but it wasn’t (at least until recently) an option available to the gen-
eral public.
Figure 10-10:
Allow a

207
Chapter 10: Taking Common-Sense Steps to Security

When you’re connected to the Internet at a hotspot, a lot of the data being
transmitted to and from your computer is being broadcast in the clear. Not all
of it, to be sure, but a good portion of it. With enough patience, the right
equipment, and the right software, a hacker can intercept and read that data
and information. You can be sure that if someone goes to those lengths,
they’re not likely to act in your best interests if they gather some valuable
personal information.
If you’re connected via the Internet to a secure Web site, whether from your
home or a hotspot, the data being transmitted is secure from prying eyes. It’s
true, the data and the information are zipping through the air, but not as an
open transmission. It’s garbled and unintelligible because of encryption. You
can know that you’re on a secure Web site by the little gold lock icon that
appears in the URL address window and in the lower right corner of your
Web browser. Also, the first part of the Web address is https, which, by the
way, stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, Secure.
What’s a VPN?
A VPN is a securely encrypted link for data traveling over the Internet. It’s
encrypted by the sender and decrypted by the receiver with specialized VPN
software. This works really well when one end is a corporate network and the
other end is a business traveler. And I hear you saying, That’s great if you’re
connecting to a company network over the Internet, but what if I just want to
connect to the Internet? Even if I encrypt my outbound traffic, the Web site 
I’m connecting to won’t be running any kind of decryption program.
Well, you’re right. But there’s a way to take advantage of this technology,
even if you just want to connect to the Internet. Several companies are now
set up in such a way that you can connect to them under the protection of a
VPN. With that secure connection between you and them, they (in turn) con-
nect you to the Internet.
In geek-speak, you’re connecting securely, via the Internet, to a proxy server
that’s connected to the Internet. When you make a request for a Web page,
that request travels over an encrypted link to the proxy server. That server,
acting on your behalf as a proxy, decrypts your request and resends it over a
wired Internet connection to the Web server hosting the requested Web page.
The Web server, by request, serves up the page, sends it to the proxy server
that then encrypts the page, and resends it to your laptop. The VPN client on
your laptop decrypts the page, and you can then view it on your screen.
As you might guess, this all takes a little bit more time than simply connect-
ing to the Internet directly. The slowdown with 128-bit encryption is barely
noticeable, but you might not want to use a connection like this for playing
games. If, however, you’re sending e-mails that include personal information
or you’re surfing the Net, a service like this can be invaluable.
208
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

Another benefit of using a VPN service is that you surf the Web more-or-less
anonymously. Because the proxy server is making the actual request for the
Web pages, the IP address read by the Web server is that of the proxy, not
your laptop. Lest you believe that this would enable you (or others) to engage
in mass spam-mailing or any other ethically questionable or downright illegal
activity, you should be aware that the records of the company operating the
proxy server are subject to subpoena by law enforcement agencies.
At least three companies I know of offer this type of service. They are
 HotSpotVPN: HotSpotVPN offers their service by subscription to a vari-
ety of users, including those using Palm or Pocket PC PDAs. They also —
if you choose — block unwanted Internet ads and offer three levels of
encryption. Their Web address is www.hotspotvpn.com.
 PublicVPN.com: Although this subscription service is easy to use and
configure, they also offer extensive setup instructions on the Support
page of their Web site. They can be found at (as you may have guessed)
www.publicvpn.com.
 JiWire: Marketed under the name SpotLock, this service, along with its
VPN, includes an Internet connection management utility and an easily
updated hotspot directory. The VPN security feature is available by sub-
scription, but the connection management utility and directory can be
used free of charge. They’re found at www.jiwire.com.
Examining SpotLock by JiWire
Because SpotLock is (at least right now) the lowest-priced of the choices —
and because it includes features like the portable directory and connection-
management utility, I’ve chosen to subscribe to this VPN. My laptop doesn’t
contain a whole lot of top-secret trucking documents that get e-mailed back
and forth, and most of my other online activity is pretty boring and benign.
Nonetheless, I do my banking, budgeting, and tax work online, and even
though this is all done on secure Web sites, I just feel better knowing I’m
doubly secure.
Some of the key features of SpotLock include the following:
 Portable directory: I talk a bit about this in Chapter 5, and I’ve had this
feature installed for a long time. At one time, it was the primary product
offered by JiWire, and it’s how I was first introduced to them.
 Connection-management utility: I get into the nuts and bolts of this util-
ity in Chapter 6. This utility is the only connection utility I’ve used that
detects as many networks as NetStumbler does.
209
Chapter 10: Taking Common-Sense Steps to Security

 E-mail relay: Some hotspots block e-mails that would normally go
through your ISP’s SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server. Under
these circumstances, you can receive e-mail but you can’t send it.
SpotLock, like most VPN services, includes an e-mail transfer service
that eliminates the problem.
 VPN: This is the primary service offered by SpotLock; it protects all the
Internet traffic emanating from and destined for your laptop by placing it
in a cryptographic tunnel.
Downloading and installing SpotLock
If you want to give SpotLock a try, JiWire offers a short, free trial. I say short
because you get to connect through the VPN only three times before that
option expires, and you’re asked to make a decision. You can continue to use
all the other features of SpotLock from that point forward, and should you
decide to take advantage of the security feature, you can sign up at any time
from the connection utility’s Manage tab.
The download process could, in my opinion, be a bit more streamlined. But
until they start taking my advice, you need to follow these steps:
1. On the JiWire home page (www.jiwire.com), click the button labeled
Secure.
You can choose to Buy Now! or Try it Free! I always try before I buy if
given the choice, and that’s what I suggest you do.
2. Click Try it Free, and the logon/registration screen opens. Fill in the
appropriate information, and click Create Account & Start Download.
The registration confirmation page opens, and once again, you’re given
the option to begin the download or get more information.
3. Click Download.
A page opens that includes the Release Notes for the version you’re
trying to download and (again) giving you the opportunity to either buy
the utility right away or accept a free trial.
4. Click Try It For Free, and, finally, the download manager opens.
5. Choose Save to Disk, and with the download complete, you can open
the Installation Wizard.
6. Close out any program applications you’ve got running, and shut
down your antivirus software. Double-click the new icon with the cap-
tion SpotLock-Installer.
The Installation Wizard opens.
7. Click Next.
The EULA window opens.
210
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

8. Read the EULA; if you agree to the terms, select the radio button indi-
cating that you’re accepting the terms. Click Next.
The Customer Information window opens. 
9. Enter the appropriate information, and decide whether you want the
installation to be available to all users or just you by selecting the cor-
responding radio button. Click Next.
The Destination Folder window opens, displaying the default destination
folder. You can choose to change it if you so desire. In a word: Don’t.
10. Click Next.
What I like to call “The Hesitation Window” opens, giving you the option
to go back and make changes. You don’t want to do that.
11. Click Install, and several installation status bar windows open and
close during the process.
The final Installation Wizard window opens, indicating completion.
12. If you don’t want to start the program or don’t want an icon on your
desktop, deselect the radio buttons, and click Finish.
Assuming you leave the radio buttons alone, you now have a new icon
appearing on your desktop, and the connection-management utility opens.
If any hotspots, or home or business wireless networks are in range, they
appear in the Connect window. Any secured networks have a little blue key
icon showing to the left of the SSID, and conversely, unsecured networks, like
hotspots, simply indicate the SSID. Below the SSID, you see the signal
strength, ranging from Very Low to Excellent.
Connecting securely through SpotLock
After you install SpotLock, you can use the following steps to connect and
configure it:
1. With the connection-management utility open, click the hotspot SSID
you want to connect to, and then click Connect in the upper-right
corner of the window.
Because this is the first time you’ve connected to this hotspot, the con-
nection wizard opens.
2. You can choose to use the SpotLock VPN security feature, or choose to
use another VPN/ No Security.
On occasion, the use of a VPN proxy server makes it impossible to make
the initial connection to a hotspot that requires you to use a logon page.
To avoid this problem, I suggest that you choose, initially, to use no
security. After the connection’s made and you receive the You’re
Connected to the Internet screen, you can enable the SpotLock VPN fea-
ture by clicking the Secure tab on the connection manager, entering your
username and password, and clicking Activate.
211
Chapter 10: Taking Common-Sense Steps to Security

3. After making your VPN selection, you have the opportunity to choose
whether you want any applications to start immediately and whether
you want to disable any Internet Explorer proxy settings.
I suggest that you don’t start any other programs in conjunction with
the connection-management utility, but it’s your choice. You need to be
concerned with the IE proxy server settings only if you have IE set to
connect through a corporate VPN.
4. When asked whether to allow an automatic connection, I suggest you
save the settings you’ve made, but disallow the automatic connection.
See the “Disallowing automatic hotspot connections” section earlier in
this chapter for details on the evils of automatic connections.
The connection is now made and you’re surfin’ safe.
The JiWire connection utility automatically disables the Windows Zero
Configuration utility. If, for whatever reason, you want to use the WZC, you
have to right-click the little JiWire icon in the system tray and choose Exit.
Then you have to enable WZC, following the steps outlined in Chapter 5.
Configuring the ZoneAlarm or Windows firewall for use with SpotLock
If you’re using the ZoneAlarm firewall, then the first time you make a connec-
tion to a hotspot with SpotLock, a ZoneAlarm New Program security alert bal-
loon appears — saying jiwire-pluto.exe is trying to access the
Internet. Select the Remember this Setting check box, and click Allow.
(Refer to Figure 10-8 for an example of the alert.)
After that, open the ZoneAlarm control panel, open the Program Control
window, and check the following:
 On the Main tab, be certain that the Program Control is set to Medium
and the Automatic Lock is off.
 On the Programs tab, click the blue question marks in the Server
column to the right of the jiwire-pluto.exe program, and choose
Allow from the menu that appears. Do this under both the Trusted
and Internet subheadings.
Configuring the Windows firewall for use with SpotLock requires less effort
because the Windows firewall doesn’t block any outbound traffic. All that’s
required is quick mouse and cursor reflexes. When the Windows firewall alert
balloon opens, all you have to do is Unblock the jiwire-pluto.exe pro-
gram to enable communication between your laptop and the SpotLock
servers.
If your mouse and cursor reflexes are a little slow on the draw — allowing the
Alert balloon to disappear — all you need do is disconnect from the network
and then reconnect. Doing this causes the security alert to reappear, giving
you another shot at unblocking SpotLock.

Encrypting Data
In This Chapter
 Protecting your valuable data
 Using a data-encryption utility
 Encrypting e-mail
 Using Windows XP Pro encryption
A
recent FBI computer-crime survey found that 50 percent of respon-
dents had been the victims of a laptop theft. That’s an astounding
number, even if you take into account that the survey was limited to compa-
nies and corporations with more than 5 employees and more than a million
dollars in revenue. And the cost of these thefts isn’t limited to the price of a
replacement laptop. Not by a long shot.
Even though I’m not a corporate mogul, plenty of the data on my laptop has
great value to me — and, were it to enter the public domain, could result in
the loss of my identity, potentially putting me on the hook for debts I never
incurred. What data do you have sitting on your laptop hard drive just wait-
ing to be exploited by thieves?
In this chapter, I tell you a little about data encryption and help you set up a
free data-encryption utility on your computer. I also tell you a bit about how
to use it. For example, I show you how to set up an encrypted vault and how
to send encrypted e-mail attachments. I spill the beans about a utility you
can use to lock down programs, and I tell you how to encrypt files and fold-
ers with Windows XP Pro.
Examining Data Encryption
If you watch some of the popular television crime shows, you might think
that encrypting data a waste of time — most crime-scene investigators, a
couple of doctors in the Boston medical examiner’s office, criminal investiga-
tors employed by the Navy, and the janitor at CTU can crack any encryption
code in a few minutes, right? Well, like your mom used to tell you, don’t

believe everything you see on TV. Although it is possible to break encryption,
no one can do it between a couple of commercials, and anyone who tries
needs a supercomputer (or a giant network of PCs) and a lot of time.
For example, in a competition sponsored by RSA Security, a 64-bit encryption
key was broken after almost 5 years, using tens of thousands of computers
networked together. According to experts, cracking a 128-bit encryption key
is 16 times harder. That doesn’t mean, again, that it can’t be done. But your
average laptop thief just won’t see the point in spending millions of dollars
and years of time breaking the encryption on your laptop to get your check-
ing account information.
The longer an encryption key is, the more bits it uses — and the more diffi-
cult it is to crack. A 128-bit encryption key, based on the AES, TEA, Blowfish,
or IDEA algorithm, is considered “strong” encryption and it’s around
300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times more complex than the 40-bit
encryption used in the early days of Internet security. While TOP SECRET
government documents are required to use 192- or 256-bit encryption, you
should find 128-bit encryption to be more than sufficient for keeping your
information safe from prying eyes.
Exploring the advantages
Aside from the fact that using encryption makes you feel like an international
spy, you have more compelling reasons to consider using an encryption
application to protect some of the files and folders you keep stored on your
laptop. Some encryption programs even secure program applications, making
it impossible, for example, to open your Web browser without a password.
If you carry personal information (either yours or others’), carry sensitive
company documents, or discuss information that shouldn’t be available to
the public in e-mail, then using an encryption utility makes good sense. No
one expects their laptop to be stolen, but it does happen. If it happens to
you, it’d be nice to know that at least the information stored on your laptop
won’t be used to further victimize you or your associates.
Another key reason to use encryption is that viruses can’t read or alter
encrypted files, folders or program applications. Nor can Trojan Horses, spy-
ware, curious co-workers, or those who are simply snooping.
Perusing the possibilities
Plenty of companies provide various encryption utilities that offer a wide
range of features. Not every utility will, however, encrypt anything and every-
thing. A few focus on encrypting e-mail, and a few focus on encrypting files
214
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

and folders. And at least one focuses on password protecting your program
applications, although it does encrypt files and folders, too.
The following utilities are among the most popular:
 Folder Lock: With this versatile program, you can choose three levels of
protection and the interface is extremely easy to use and understand.
You can choose to set security for individual files and folders, or you can
place groups of them into a security vault. Folder Lock is produced by
New Softwares and can be found by browsing to www.newsoftwares.
net/folderlock.
 PGP Desktop: Available in both Home and Professional versions,
depending on your needs, PGP Desktop allows the user to send
encrypted e-mail that can’t be read by anyone but the intended recipi-
ent. PGP also includes Self-Decrypting Archives that allow for the
exchange of secure e-mail even if the recipient doesn’t have PGP. They’re
found on the Web at www.pgp.com.
 WinGuard Pro: With the paid version of this utility (a free, limited-capa-
bility version is also available), you can password-protect the 30 built-in
program applications or lock up programs of your own choosing. You
can also encrypt files and folders, lockout Internet program downloads,
lock your desktop, and set password timers to foil hackers. It’s available
from WGSoft at www.winguardpro.com.
 TrueCrypt: This program offers a choice of encryption algorithms and,
like other utilities, allows for the creation of a virtual drive in which to
keep encrypted volumes. With large container sizes available, you can
install program applications into an encrypted container so a program
can only run, or even be seen, when opened with the password key. This
free utility is available for download at www.truecrypt.org.
 Steganos Security Suite: Using a 256-bit AES encryption key, this utility
makes it safe to carry nuclear secrets alongside your personal informa-
tion. Among the features and abilities the utility includes are a password
generator/manager and a file shredder. A free trial is available from the
developer at www.steganos.com.
 Cryptainer LE: A free encryption utility developed by Cypherix, which
also offers several other premium encryption utilities, Cryptainer LE
uses the 128-bit Blowfish algorithm to create 25MB vaults that files and
folders can be dropped into. It also lets you create self-extracting,
encrypted e-mail files that can be read by the recipient, without
Cryptainer LE, providing they have the password. You can download it
free from Cypherix at www.cypherix.com.
Some of the utilities offer 448-bit encryption (based on the Blowfish algo-
rithm) or 256-bit encryption (based on one of several algorithms). You might
wonder why anyone would need such a strong encryption cipher, but for
those involved in, for example, the medical professions, entrusted with the
215
Chapter 11: Encrypting Data

responsibility to keep the personal information of their patients and clients
safe from prying eyes, the extremely strong encryption provides the peace of
mind that comes with knowing files and folders are completely safe.
Getting Started with Cryptainer LE
Most encryption programs use encrypted logical containers — vaults — to
store files and folders on virtual drives, and they all do so in a similar fashion.
For the purpose of illustrating how using these programs work, I decided to
use Cryptainer LE, because it’s free and easy to use. No matter what program
you decide to use, the sections that follow can help you understand the
value, and the ease, of encrypting files and e-mails.
And did I mention Cryptainer LE was free? I did, didn’t I? Well, quite a few
others are free, too, but if you accept a free trial for a premium utility and find
that you like it, don’t let a few dollars stand in the way of your security —
most are less than $50 and all I’ve seen are less than $100.
Downloading and installing the program
Like so many other program applications, the installation of this program
requires little more than an ability to click Next. After downloading
Cryptainer LE from the Cypherix Web site and saving the installation file to
your desktop, double-click the new icon on your desktop and the installation
wizard opens. You don’t really want to alter any of the default names and
locations so, just accept the terms, keep clicking Next until you get to the
Install prompt (click Install) and the last window, where you click Finish.
If you’re still using Windows 98, SE, or ME you’re instructed to restart your
computer. Restarting isn’t absolutely necessary in Windows 2000 or XP, but 
I recommend you do so anyway, before you open the utility and get started.
Setting up Cryptainer
Prior to creating your first encrypted vault, you need to create a password.
Since Cryptainer supports passwords of up to 100 characters in length, and
since the encryption is only as strong as the password, I suggest that you
create an extremely strong password.
If you forget your password, your data will be unrecoverable. It’s important
to have a strong, crack-proof password but it needs to be something you can
remember. For tips on creating strong passwords (that are also easy to
remember), flip to Chapter 10.
216
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

Whereas most passwords will fall into the 8- to 14-character range, you
should, with Cryptainer, use as near the full 100 character length as you pos-
sibly can. While using the first letters of a popular phrase with a few other
characters thrown in works well for shorter passwords, you may want to
employ a different strategy for creating a longer password to use with your
encrypted files. Using a pass phrase is a great idea, but you must be certain
that it’s unique. You don’t want to use a pass phrase that, once a couple of
words are ascertained, will be immediately recognizable.
Encrypting Files
The first thing I wondered when I decided to give Cryptainer LE a try was,
“What the heck should I encrypt?” Well, in case you’re asking yourself this
question, first and foremost you should encrypt anything and everything that
you wouldn’t want John Q. Public having clear and easy access to. A few of
those items might include
 Your saved e-mail: Whenever I sign up for something on the Web, I seem
to (inevitably) get an e-mail that includes, at a minimum, my username
and password. Because I don’t want to remember all that stuff, I save the
e-mails. However, I save them to a couple of files stored in a Cryptainer
vault instead of in Outlook Express or Thunderbird.
 E-mail addresses: Exporting and importing e-mail addresses is a bit of a
hassle but, if you’ve got some addresses that it’d be best to keep confi-
dential, it’s quite possibly worth the effort.
 Financial information: I keep my budget and a lot of tax information on
my laptop. It’s not something I want just anybody to have access to.
 Business-related information: Most employers entrust employees with
information they’d prefer not to make readily available to the public. If
it’s business-related, no matter how sensitive you think the information
might be, treat it like the secret recipe to Bush’s Baked Beans.
Creating an encrypted vault
Cryptainer LE creates a separate, removable (although, because it’s a virtual
drive, it’s not physically removable) drive located on your hard drive. This
drive acts like any other drive on your computer. When the Cryptainer LE
utility is open, this drive is visible and when the utility’s closed, or even mini-
mized, the drive disappears. As long as the utility is open and the drive is vis-
ible, the files, folders or program applications stored on this drive will act,
and can be acted upon, as though they were on your hard drive or any other
removable drive.
217
Chapter 11: Encrypting Data

Your first step in creating an encrypted container in which to store files and
folders you want to keep completely safe is to open the Cryptainer utility.
The first time you start Cryptainer LE, the program prompts you to start cre-
ating your vault. Specify the following in the Specify Cryptainer Volume
Details dialog box (shown in Figure 11-1):
 The Cryptainer volume file name: The default file name and location is
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cxl1705 but it’s suggested that you come up
with something on your own. It can be anything you like. You can either
browse to use an existing path or you can create a new folder and file.
For the purpose of this demonstration, I specify the file saved mail be
created in Saved e-mail — and so the full path is 
C:\Documents and Settings\Phil Haley\Saved e-mail\
saved mail
To create a new folder and specify the path, as I’ve done, follow these
steps:
1. Click Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Windows Explorer.
2. Highlight the location at which you intend to create the new
folder.
For example, if you highlight Desktop, the new folder will be cre-
ated in the Desktop menu tree. (Of course, you could just right-
click your desktop and create a new folder that way.)
3. Click File➪New➪Folder, enter the name of your new folder, and
click Enter.
4. Minimize the Explorer window; then, in the Cryptainer vault-
creation wizard, click Browse.
5. Find your new folder and double-click it. In the text-entry field,
type the desired name for your vault file and click Save.
Figure 11-1:

Cryptainer
begins with
this dialog
box.
218
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

 Volume name: The default name is Cryptainer. It’s suggested you
change the name, so I call this volume Saved Mail.
 Volume size: The default size is 10MB but you can specify any size up to
25MB in Cryptainer LE. If you need a larger vault size than that, you need
to upgrade to another Cryptainer product or choose one of the other
encryption utilities that feature larger vault, or container, sizes.
 Create a password: Come up with a secure password that’s as long as
possible and enter it in the text-entry field.
 Verify the password: Type — don’t copy and paste — the password in
the verification field. The reason you don’t want to paste it from the first
field is that you may have made a typing error (it happens) — and if you
paste an erroneous password into the re-entry field, you may never
figure out the error, forever dooming the utility.
After you enter all the necessary information, click Proceed to Create
Volume. A creation-progress bar opens, followed by a reminder to jot down
the full path to your newly created file and a notice indicating the drive letter
assigned to your new vault. It’s a good idea to jot down the path, especially if
it’s a secondary vault. (Later in this chapter, in “Creating new vaults and
other tricks,” I tell you how to create secondary vaults.)
Moving your files into the vault
You can move files and folders into the Cryptainer vault in two ways. The pri-
mary method is to drag them from one location, like Windows Explorer, and
drop them into the Cryptainer Vault. The second method is to create folders
within the Cryptainer vault and save documents, like your e-mails, to those
folders.
Now, you can’t actually create folders within the normal Cryptainer view, but
you can create new folders or files within the Explorer window that opens by
clicking View in Explorer (on the Cryptainer toolbar). Then just click
File➪New and choose to open a new folder (or to open a new document
type). For my receipts and registrations, I created a couple of folders with the
clever and highly imaginative names — Receipts and Registrations. I
can now save e-mail receipts or registration confirmations directly to the
appropriate folder. (I tell you how to do this in the next section.)
Dragging and dropping existing files and folders into Cryptainer is likely the
most common way folks use this utility. You can, for example, open Windows
Explorer and drag any folder into your vault. You can also, if you’re using the
View in Explorer option, move files and folders from one Explorer window to
another, as shown in Figure 11-2. If you move a file or folder out of the vault,
however, it’s no longer protected by encryption.
219
Chapter 11: Encrypting Data

If you right-click and drag a file or folder into your vault you can choose to
move the file to that location. If, however, you left-click and drag the file you
can only move a copy of the file or folder. Because the point of protecting
files and folders with encryption is to keep them hidden, it’s probably best to
move, rather than copy, folders to the vault.
Certain files, like those relating to program applications or system functions,
should never be moved because moving them can prevent systems and pro-
grams from functioning. If you get a warning from Windows Explorer concern-
ing access to certain folders, you should heed that warning. In general, if the
folder contains items other than documents, music, photos, videos, Web
pages, or other similar media, leave it where you found it.
Accessing your encrypted files
Working with files located on the Cryptainer LE virtual drive, once the utility
and vault are opened, is exactly the same as working with files or folders
located anyplace else on the hard drive. To open your secure vault, double-
click the Cryptainer icon, enter your password in the text-entry field, and
click OK. Your newly created vault opens and you’re ready to work with it.
With the Cryptainer volume open (not minimized), I can also open Outlook
Express and save a receipt or registration confirmation to one of the folders 
I created for that purpose. In order to save, for example, an e-mail receipt I
just highlight the e-mail I want to move, click File➪Save As, and save the
e-mail to the proper folder.
Folders kept within a Cryptainer vault aren’t viewable unless the utility is
open and the vault is loaded. The first vault you create is the Primary volume
and, when you open the utility it is, by default, loaded.

Creating new vaults and other tricks
It’s highly likely that you’ll want to create more than one encrypted vault.
And after you have files tucked away in these separate vaults, a few tips will
help you navigate them more easily. Here’s a quick list of the basic tasks you
need to know:
 Creating a new vault: Open the Cryptainer utility and click Tools➪
Additional Cryptainer Volumes➪New Volume. The Specify Cryptainer
Volume Details window opens and, just like you did with the original
volume, you now specify the path, volume name, size and password.
Since Cryptainer, for security purposes, doesn’t keep a record of your
volume names and locations it’s important, especially if you have sev-
eral, using various paths, that you keep a record of these names and
locations.
When you create a new volume, you can also create it on removable
media or devices like CDs or Flash Drives by specifying that media in the
vault location. Another option is to install Cryptainer LE on a removable
drive so you can use it on more than one computer.
 Accessing a secondary vault: By default, the Primary volume, the only
one that Cryptainer remembers the location of, is the one that loads
upon opening the Cryptainer utility. Accessing your other vaults is done
221
Chapter 11: Encrypting Data
Working with an encrypted Address Book
You may be curious to know how you can store
your address book in an encrypted volume
rather than within, for example, Outlook
Express. After creating a volume in which to
store the addresses open Outlook Express, click
Tools➪Address Book, and the Address Book
screen opens. Click File➪Export➪Address
Book (WAB) and browse to the export location.
Name the file and click Save. Your address
book, at this point, is saved to your encrypted
vault.
The address book also still exists in Outlook
Express. If your goal is to hide this address book
completely, you can now delete it, in its entirety,
from Outlook Express. When you find yourself 
in need of the address book you open the
encrypted volume in which it resides, and
import it. This is done in a fashion similar to the
process used to export the address book.
Click Tools➪Address Book. With the Address
Book screen open click File➪Import➪Address
Book (WAB) and browse to the address book’s
location. Click the address book name to high-
light it and click Open. In the blink of an eye your
address book’s back in Outlook Express. If you
make additions to it while you’re using it, just
export it back to the volume and overwrite the
existing file. It’s a bit of a hassle, yes, but taking
these steps safeguards the e-mail addresses
that others have entrusted to you.

in a fashion very similar to that of creating them. Click Tools➪Additional
Cryptainer Volumes➪Load a Volume and select the volume you want to
work with. You can have as many as four volumes, or vaults, open at any
one time.
 Specifying a volume as the Primary Volume: To do this, once the
Cryptainer utility is opened, load the volume you want to be Primary
and choose File➪Make this the Primary Volume. From now on, unless
you decide to make one of the other volumes Primary, this is the volume
that will load when you open Cryptainer.
Shutting down Cryptainer LE
Before you close any Cryptainer volume, or close the utility, be sure you’ve
saved any of the changes you might have made in any documents you had
open and close those documents. If you’ve got more than one volume loaded,
it’s not necessary to close each one separately; just click Shutdown & Exit on
the Primary Volume window. Cryptainer then unloads all the open volumes
and shuts itself down safely.
Normally, any open Explorer windows will close when the Shutdown & Exit is
performed but it’s possible that you may have to close them out as well. If
any file or folder is still in use, maybe in another program application,
Cryptainer won’t shut down but, instead, an error message appears. In that
case just acknowledge the error, close the offending file or folder, and repeat
the shutdown steps.
Sending Encrypted E-Mail or
Attachments
With some e-mail-encryption programs, you may well have the ability or
option to encrypt both the e-mail message itself and any attachments you
might be sending.
If your correspondence needs to be secure and confidential, it might be best
to create a message in a separate word processing application and send it as
an encrypted attachment to a normal e-mail message. Although you can
create self-extracting encrypted attachments that don’t require the recipient
to have a decryption utility, the message is usually bundled with an exe-
cutable (.exe) file that enables the recipient to read the message, and
antivirus programs almost always strip these .exe files. A better choice is to
send an encrypted attachment, which does require a recipient to have a spe-
cial utility but doesn’t ring alarm bells in antivirus software. I figure, if the file
needs to be secure, your recipient will likely understand and won’t mind get-
ting a simple utility.
222
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

Other encryption programs, especially any specializing in encrypted e-mail,
might be a bit easier to use or offer more versatility than Cryptainer LE — but
for sending encrypted file or folder attachments by e-mail, it does a pretty
good job. This is accomplished quite easily, as you discover in the following
steps:
1. Open the Cryptainer utility in the usual manner and click Secure
E-mail➪Encrypt File to Send by E-mail.
The Encrypt File to Send by E-mail dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 11-3.
2. Enter either the complete path to the file you want to encrypt or click
the cute little file icon to begin browsing for the file. Once you find
the file, double-click it.
The path to the file is entered in the field.
3. Enter and verify the password needed to open the e-mail.
This password needs to be transmitted to the recipient in a separate
e-mail or, preferably, by other means.
4. If you have no way of transmitting the password to your intended
recipient, you can, in the “hint” text box enter a hint or riddle to
which they’re sure to know the answer.
5. Choose whether to leave the original file alone or delete it following
the encryption by selecting the appropriate radio button.
6. Click Encrypt File. Once the encryption is completed, click OK on the
Pathway Information box.
Providing the encrypted file to be sent as an attachment doesn’t reside
in an encrypted vault, you can close the Cryptainer utility.
Figure 11-3:

options for

223
Chapter 11: Encrypting Data

With the file encrypted, you can open your e-mail client and compose the
message to which the file is meant to be attached. You can recognize the
encrypted file, in case there’s some confusion, by the .sit extension at the
end of the filename.
After you send your encrypted message, you don’t want your recipient to
wonder, “How in the world am I supposed to open this?” This is one area in
which all the Cryptainer utilities shine. Just remember that your recipient
needs the following:
 A utility: Your recipient can download and install either the free
Cryptainer LE utility or, if they have no need of that, the free DeCypherIT
utility.
DeCypherIT can be downloaded from the Cypherix Web site by visiting
www.cypherix.co.uk/decypherit.htm and selecting the FREE
Download button. DeCypherIT decrypts any e-mail created by any of the
Cypherix software products.
 The password: Remember the password that you created to protect the
file? You should relay this password to your intended recipient in some
way other than an e-mail — whether you call, text message, or attach a
note to an arrow.
Encrypting Program Applications
I really like the idea of locking up entire program applications so no one has
any hope of accessing them. For example; I lock Internet Explorer. That way,
even if my laptop’s stolen, the thief has no hope of accessing my Favorites
folders or browser history. Without that access, they can’t possibly know
where I do my banking — or with which Web sites I engage in other financial
transactions.
With Cryptainer LE, as well as most of the other encryption programs that
make use of volumes contained on virtual drives, you can install program
applications directly into the vault — with some notable exceptions. The pri-
mary problems I’ve encountered with this approach include an inability to
specify, with some applications, the drive on which I want the program
installed, and, with other applications, being blocked from installing to a
removable drive.
To resolve these problems, I’ve employed a different encryption utility that
password protects program applications. WinGuard Pro, the utility I use for
this purpose, offers a free version of their utility but, because I like the ability
to specify programs other than those the free version supports, I purchased
the fully functional premium utility. Using WinGuard Pro, I can lock up my
Web browsers, e-mail clients, or, if I want, my entire desktop.
224
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

Installing WinGuard Pro
WinGuard Pro is available for download from the developer’s Web site. 
Point your browser to www.winguardpro.com/products.html and click
Download Now. No matter whether you want the free or premium version —
and you might as well give the free version a try — the download includes
both. If you want to upgrade later, you’re given ample, and annoying, ways of
doing so.
After the installation file is downloaded, you simply double-click the newest
icon on your desktop and follow the prompts of the installation wizard. This
is another wizard that requires little more from you than to click Next repeat-
edly, click Install and Finish once, and remain breathing.
Using WinGuard Pro
To lock down a program application, you must first open the WinGuard Pro
utility. When you open it for the first time, you can use the password LET-
MEIN and then, once open, click Set Passwords in the menu on the left so
that you can reset the password. Make sure you use a strong password. (I
offer tips on creating strong passwords in Chapter 10.) One password is used
for all the items you intend to lock, and one password is used to open the
configuration utility.
Once that task is done, you can choose to lock miscellaneous program appli-
cations, encrypt files and folders, or set Internet keyword restrictions using
the Web Content Filter (which stops kids or adults from doing an Internet
search using terms or phrases set by you). Prior to shutting down my laptop,
I lock down both Outlook Express and Internet Explorer. Two separate
actions are required to lock these programs. To lock down Internet Explorer,
follow these steps:
1. Right-click the WinGuard Pro lock icon in the system tray and select
Configuration. Enter your password and click Continue.
The menu screen opens.
2. Click Additional Locks.
The Configuration dialog box opens.
3. Select the Additional Locks tab.
4. Under Internet Explorer, select the Lock Internet Explorer check box.
You notice that, by placing a check mark in the Lock Internet Explorer
check box, that several other boxes are automatically checked, cutting
off all avenues to access Internet Explorer. Figure 11-4 show how it looks.
5. Click Apply.
225
Chapter 11: Encrypting Data

With Internet Explorer locked, you can now lock Outlook Express from the
same dialog box.
1. Select the Home tab and click Lock a Program or Window.
The Lock an Item dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-5.
2. From the menu find Outlook Express and put a check mark in the box
on the left.
At this point you can either choose to lock additional programs or, with
Internet Explorer and Outlook Express password protected, you can
simply close out all the open boxes.

Part IV: Securing Your Information 

You can, with the premium edition, also lock down other programs and win-
dows. I use Mozilla Firefox more than I use Internet Explorer. To lock down
that, or any other program, from the Lock an Item dialog box, follow these
steps:
1. With the application in question open click Add➪Refresh.
2. Click the program you want to lock, in the lower menu window that’s
now open, and click the Add button to the right of it.
This moves the program into the upper Locked Programs and Windows
area, with a check mark next to it.
If you’re locking a program like Firefox, it’s important that the window you
lock is the Home Page. That way, if someone other than you tries to open the
program, it immediately locks down until the password is entered. You could
also choose, if you desire, to lock windows that are doorways to financial
institutions. Be aware that once you enter a password to open the program
or window, you have to re-lock it when you shut down in order to keep it
secure.
Using File Encryption in Windows XP Pro
If you’re using Windows XP Professional, you have the ability to encrypt files
and folders with what Windows calls the Encrypting File System (EFS). By
using EFS, the encrypted files and folders are protected from being viewed or
altered by malicious programs or unauthorized users. EFS uses a pair of
encryption keys, a private key that’s owned by the authorized account user,
and a public key that’s generally available.
When a file or folder is encrypted with EFS, a file-encryption key (FEK) is auto-
matically generated. The FEK, along with an encryption algorithm, is used to
create the encrypted file. The FEK is also encrypted and stored with the
encrypted file. Access to the encrypted file is quick and easy because, as the
creator, your user account holds the certificate verifying you as the owner of
the private key that’s used to decrypt the FEK which, in turn, is used to
decrypt the file or folder.
Anyone accessing the user account under which files or folders were
encrypted has access to those encrypted documents. For this reason it’s
important to set up a separate user account, accessed only from the logon
screen, protected by a very strong password.
227
Chapter 11: Encrypting Data

Setting up user accounts
It’s a good idea, if you’re going to use the EFS, to set up a separate account
from which files and folders will be encrypted. To accomplish this worthy
goal, follow these simple steps:
1. Click Start➪Control Panel➪User Accounts.
The User Accounts screen opens.
2. Select the Users tab and click Add.
3. Type a name for your new account in the text-entry field.
Unless your computer is a part of a client/server network you don’t
need to enter a domain name.
4. Enter and confirm a strong password for the account. Click Next.
See Chapter 10 for details on creating strong passwords.
5. Decide whether you want to grant the account administrative rights or
limit the account. Click Finish.
Encrypting folders and files
You can choose to encrypt individual files, but a better choice is to encrypt
the entire folder and all its contents. As a matter of fact, you can, if you like,
choose to encrypt the My Documents folder or, if you prefer, create a specific
folder in which encrypted files and sub-folders will be stored. Any file or 
sub-folder subsequently created in, or moved to, the encrypted folder is
automatically encrypted.
You can’t encrypt a compressed folder or file. If you attempt to do so, the
item will be encrypted but will no longer be compressed. One solution is to
store the compressed folder or file in an encrypted vault (like those I tell you
about earlier in the chapter), using Cryptainer LE.
To encrypt a folder and its contents, simply follow these steps:
1. Right-click the folder you want to encrypt and click Properties.
The Properties dialog box opens.
2. Select the General tab and click Advanced.
The Advanced Attributes dialog box opens.
3. Select the Encrypt Contents To Secure Data check box. Click OK.
228
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

4. Click OK to close the Advanced Attributes dialog box.
If the folder you’re encrypting already contains files or sub-folders the
Confirm Attribute Changes dialog box opens.
5. Select Apply changes to this folder, subfolders, and files and click OK.
EFS won’t work without a recovery agent certificate, but a recovery agent
account is designated by default, and the necessary certificate is generated
automatically, if you don’t do it manually. I talk more about this a bit later
under the heading “Making sure you can access encrypted data.”
Decrypting files and folders
Providing you’re working from the user account in which the folder you want
to work on was encrypted, file decryption happens automatically. This hap-
pens so quickly and seamlessly that you might wonder if the file was actually
encrypted. If, however, you want to send the file to another person or move it
to another user account, you want it decrypted. The process is pretty much
the reverse of the one you followed to enable encryption. Here’s how it works:
1. Right-click the folder you want to decrypt and click Properties.
The Properties dialog box opens.
2. Select the General tab and click Advanced.
The Advanced Attributes dialog box opens.
3. Deselect the Encrypt Contents To Secure Data check box. Click OK.
4. Click OK to close the Advanced Attributes dialog box.
If the folder you’re decrypting contains files or sub-folders the Confirm
Attribute Changes dialog box opens.
5. If you want to decrypt all the contents of the folder select Apply
changes to this folder, subfolders, and files and click OK.
You can choose to decrypt only the folder but, if this is your choice, none of
the files or sub-folders contained in the folder will be decrypted.
Making sure you can access 
encrypted data
One thing about the certificate authorizing use of the private key that
decrypts the file-encryption key (which is then used to decrypt the folder
you’ve encrypted): You have to keep it somewhere — and normally the 
229
Chapter 11: Encrypting Data

certificate is stored in the same user account in which the folder was
encrypted. If this user account (or the private key held within it) gets deleted
or corrupted, the encrypted data becomes unrecoverable. What to do?
Sure, you can do a lot of complicated computer stuff and create what’s known
as a “designated recovery agent,” but it’s a whole lot easier simply to back up
the certificate to a floppy disk or CD that you can use to recover the data if
there’s a problem. To back up the certificate, follow these steps:
1. Click Start➪Control Panel➪Network and Internet
Connections➪Internet Options.
The Internet Properties dialog box opens.
2. Select the Content tab. In the Certificates section, click Certificates.
The Certificates dialog box opens.
3. Select the Personal tab.
4. In the Certificate Intended Purposes field, select one certificate at a
time until you find Encrypting File System.
When you encrypted your first folder, this certificate was generated by
default.
5. Click Export.
The Certificate Export Wizard opens.
6. Click Next.
7. Click Yes, export the private key.
8. Click Next.
9. Click Enable strong protection.
10. Click Next.
11. Enter your password.
12. Decide whether you want to save the key to another location on 
your hard drive, to a virtual Cryptainer drive, to a CD, or to a floppy
disk — and specify your preferred destination.
13. Click Next.
Your private key is sent to the destination of your choosing. If you sent it
to a CD or floppy disk, be sure to keep it in a safe place. You can breathe
easy; if disaster strikes, you can still decrypt your data.

Accessing Your Home PC
Remotely
In This Chapter
 Understanding Remote Access
 Considering your choices
 Making the preparations
 Starting a remote session
A
whole bunch of folks, my little family included, own multiple comput-
ers. As a matter of fact, we’ve got more computers than we have people.
Well, that is unless you count the cats. But, beyond chasing the mouse across
the desk, sharpening their claws on towers, and sleeping on laptop lids, they
hardly ever use computers. Even so, multiple computers mean that each one
has a different primary purpose (even to the cats), and each one contains
files, folders, and program applications unique to it.
When everybody’s home, it’s no big deal because I can either use the com-
puter that’s best suited for the job at hand, or because they’re networked, I
can grab the file or folder that I need from the computer that contains it, no
matter which one I’m using. When traveling, though, that type of free access
always seems as though it might be impossible to achieve. In truth, however,
while it might be a little bit more difficult — because some pre-planning’s
involved — it’s definitely not impossible or even all that complicated.
In this chapter, I give you the information and help you locate and use the
tools necessary to access your home computer while traveling about the
country. For example, I tell you specifically how to use the tools built into
Windows XP Pro, and if you don’t have a computer at home running that ver-
sion of Windows or you have one that’s not practical to use, I supply you with
two alternative solutions. I also help you begin to identify ways in which
using remote access can make your on-the-road computing experience easier
and more secure.

Examining Remote Access
You might not have previously considered the possibility of using your home
computer while on the road as though you were sitting right in front of it.
Well, I’m here to tell you that, not only is it possible, but it’s also really fairly
easy to do. Currently, any one of the following methods makes it possible for
you to access and control a computer that’s sitting at home from anywhere in
the world:
 Windows Remote Desktop: If the computer you want to access is run-
ning Windows XP Pro, you can access and control it from any computer
running Windows 95 or better, providing that other qualifications 
are met.
 Virtual network computing: Several VNC solutions that operate in a
fashion similar to that of the Windows Remote Desktop (and all based
on the same basic program) are freely available.
 Subscription services: Probably the easiest method of accessing a PC
from a remote location is to use a subscription service. At least one ser-
vice offers a free but relatively basic plan, whereas most of the others
charge between $10 and $20 per month for the service.
The computer that’s being accessed remotely is commonly referred to as the
host, server, or target PC. The computer making the connection — the one
you’re physically using — is most often referred to as the client or local PC.
Why would I want to do this?
By using one of the VPN subscription services that I talk about in Chapter 10,
you can surf the Web and send e-mail within an encrypted tunnel. By using a
remote desktop application or service, however, you can connect to a com-
puter sitting in your own home or office, often through a securely encrypted
tunnel, and operate it as though you were sitting right in front of it.
So . . . big deal; the question of why you’d want to add remote access to your
bag of tools still remains. Well, one of the biggest reasons is that by making
use of remote access, you can increase both security and utility. Among the
other benefits are the following:
 Program application access: Not every computer has the same software
installed. Any programs installed on the host, whether they’re installed
on the client or not, can be used. Some remote access subscription ser-
vices even make it possible to use a PDA or Pocket PC to access a
remote computer and use program applications that would be otherwise
incompatible with the device.
232
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

 Secure file access: If you’ve ever wished that you could just get a look at
that one file or folder stored on your home computer, you can appreci-
ate the value of remote access.
 Secure file storage: Laptops and PDAs are prime targets for thieves. By
using the host computer for file and folder storage, you eliminate any
chance that a thief can access sensitive information.
 Secure transactions: You wouldn’t even need to bookmark the Web sites
of financial institutions with which you do business. Because you can
initiate and complete all transactions on the host computer, your laptop
(or client) wouldn’t even have a browser history to make available to a
would-be identity thief.
 Remote printing: Although not available with every remote solution,
you can, in most cases, print from the host computer. In some cases, you
might be able to print remotely and directly from the client.
The last two benefits I cite are the primary reasons I’m a big fan of remote
access. I can do my banking, pay bills, manage investments, purchase goods
and services, and leave no trace of these transactions on my laptop. Beyond
that — because a printer is connected to my host computer — I can print
permanent records of all these transactions that just sit safely waiting for me
to return, when I can file them appropriately.
Almost anything you can do on your own computer can be done remotely.
There are, however, some significant limitations almost entirely related to the
fact that you can’t physically touch the computer. You can’t, for example,
insert a CD, floppy disk, flash drive or USB plug into any of their correspond-
ing drives or ports. You also will, most likely, need to leave the remote, or
host, computer running because in most cases, you can’t boot a computer
from a remote location.
You might want to consider setting up your host PC so that it’s headless. By
that, I mean that after you’ve taken the steps necessary to set up and config-
ure your host PC for remote control, you really don’t need to have a monitor,
keyboard, and mouse permanently attached to the tower. Only one client at a
time can access the host desktop, but as long as that’s not an issue, you
might want to consider this option. The biggest advantages to doing this are
related to cost (no monitor and peripherals to buy) and security (no one can
see what you’re doing) as well as space (the tower could go in a closet if you
had power and an Internet connection).
Exploring the possibilities
Several methods of achieving access to a remote computer, using various
technologies, are available to you. The cost of these services and utilities, 
as well as their versatility, varies from one to another. Depending on how 
233
Chapter 12: Accessing Your Home PC Remotely

you plan to use a remote access solution, any one of the following might fit
the bill:
 Remote Desktop Protocol: Built into Windows XP Pro, the remote desk-
top capability can come in handy for many users, but it might not be
appropriate for everyone because, even if it’s installed on your home PC,
you might still encounter the following road blocks:
• IP address: Most ISPs use dynamic IP addresses (a number that
identifies your computer, but dynamically, so it changes) for home
subscribers. If your IP address should change while you’re on the
road, it might be difficult or even impossible to locate your remote
PC on the Internet. If, however, you can convince your ISP to assign
a static IP address for your home (that is, an IP address that does-
n’t change), you can overcome this obstacle.
• Router firewall: If you have more than one computer at home, like
me, you’ve likely networked them through a wireless or Ethernet
(wired) router. Routers effectively block inbound traffic to your
network by employing one or more firewall solutions. This prob-
lem is overcome by forwarding port 3389 to the host computer.
(Most router manuals don’t cover this but, if you call tech support,
they can walk you through the steps required to accomplish the
task.)
• LAN: Routers generally dynamically assign a local IP address to
each PC included in the network. In order to forward port 3389 to
the host computer, the router needs to know where to find it. If,
after configuring port forwarding, the router changes the local IP
address of the host, the router won’t know where to forward the
port. You might, after consulting your router’s users’ manual, be
able to configure it to assign a static IP address to the host PC.
If you’re new to the terminology of networking and are curious about
how all this works, check out Networking For Dummies by Doug Lowe
(Wiley).
 RealVNC: The VNC stands for virtual network computing, and this pro-
gram application allows a home computer not equipped with Windows
XP Pro to be accessed from a remote location in much the same way.
Some of the same limitations found in the remote desktop feature of
Windows XP Pro might apply to this utility as well. If you’re interested in
more information, you can visit their Web site at www.realvnc.com.
A handy program application called Hamachi makes it possible to circum-
vent all the roadblocks associated with both Windows Remote Desktop
and any of the VNC applications. This little client can help you set up a vir-
tual private network comprised of computers that might be spread across
the planet. I tell you more about Hamachi in the next section.
234
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

 GoToMyPC: This subscription service accesses the host PC through a
Web server, and then, when the connection’s made, transfers the con-
nection to the communication server for the remainder of the remote
session. The data stream is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
technology. The service is a bit spendy at $20 per month, but it’s the
most feature-rich of the services. You can find them on the Web at

 LogMeIn: Like GoToMyPC, connections are made through secure
servers, so you don’t need to configure the host PC, router, or network.
LogMeIn also offers a completely free version of its service. You don’t
get the same bells and whistles as you would with their paid service, but
most folks find that it’s a good place to start and the free is version more
than sufficient. You can find them on the Web at https://secure.

Each one of these programs and services has points in its favor, so figure out
what you want to accomplish with remote access and visit each of the Web
sites to find out more about their offering. A few others you might want to

Using RealVNC
To show you how accessing your home PC might work, I chose RealVNC as
an example application, simply because most of their executive staff is com-
prised of the original members of the research team who created their prod-
uct. Who better to continue the development of a product than those
responsible for its genesis?
RealVNC offers a free version of the software as well as Personal and
Enterprise editions that are licensed for a fee. Both of the licensed versions
offer quite a number of features, including encrypted connections, not avail-
able on the free versions. However, I use the free version because first, I’m
kind of a cheapskate, and second, depending on what I’m doing, I can use
either the JiWire SpotLock or Hamachi VPN to secure my hotspot connec-
tions anyway. (I tell you more about JiWire in Chapter 10.)
235
Chapter 12: Accessing Your Home PC Remotely

As a matter of fact, the Hamachi VPN is the little gem that enables me to
securely and remotely access my home computers. Because I don’t have a
static IP address for my home and because I use a router that also dynami-
cally assigns local IP addresses, I find it beyond my capability to configure
my home network in such a way that I can connect with it remotely. I’m sure
it could be done, but it’s one of those “too many buttons, not enough brain”
situations that I strive to avoid.
Hamachi allows me to set up a secure peer-to-peer local access network that
exists on the Internet. (That is, it enables my two computers to talk to each
other.) In this way, remote access occurs exactly as if I were at home making
the remote connection within my wireless home network (or WLAN, if you
prefer the technical term). The initial connection is made through the
Hamachi mediation server in much the same way that I might connect to the
Internet through the JiWire proxy server, but then it’s handed off and all com-
munication is directly between members of the network. Setting up this kind
of a network connection completely eliminates all the issues that might block
use of VNC or remote desktop applications.
The following components are all you need to set up a hassle-free, globally
accessed LAN with remote access capability:
 Hamachi VPN: Install the free Hamachi client on each PC that you want
to include in your network. Because the network is created over the
Internet, you can include PCs at home, work, or anywhere.
 RealVNC: Install the RealVNC application on each of the computers that
you want to control remotely. You can choose to install only the Server
portion of the application on the host computer (the one you want to
access remotely) and only the Viewer portion on the PC you use to
access the host.
 Broadband connection: Although you can use dialup on one end of the
connection between host and client PCs, it’s likely to be maddeningly
slow.
Yes, it’s true; I tend to opt for the free versions of quite a few program appli-
cations. Most of the time, however, if the Web site solicits donations for soft-
ware they offer freely, and if I’ve found their program useful, I contribute a
few bucks. Because the RealVNC Web site accepts donations, you might con-
sider showing your appreciation for their hard work with some hard cash.
Hamachi, at this time, is in beta development and available for use with only
Windows XP or 2000 operating systems. I’m unsure as to whether the stan-
dard release will be compatible with any other operating system.

Setting up RealVNC
After downloading the RealVNC program application from their Web site
(www.realvnc.com) and saving the executable to your desktop, you’re
ready to install it on each computer you’d like to access remotely. For the
most part, this installation process is much like any other program applica-
tion. But in a couple of instances, you must specify a configuration element.
To install RealVNC, follow these instructions:
1. Double-click the RealVNC setup icon on your desktop.
The VNC Setup Wizard opens.
2. Click Next.
The License Agreement window opens.
3. Select the radio button accepting the agreement if, after reading it,
you choose to continue, and click Next.
4. With the Destination Location window open, ignore the option to
change the installation location. Just click Next.
The Select Components dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 12-1.
5. Make your component selections, and click Next.
If you’re setting up the host computer, you can choose to install the 
VNC Server only. If you’re setting up the client PC (the one you’ll use to
remotely access the host), you can choose to install just the VNC Viewer.
Doing a full installation on both computers is fine as well.
After you proceed, the Start Menu Folder selection window opens.

and click Install.
The VNC Server Properties dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 12-2.
9. Be sure the VNC Password Authentication radio button’s selected, and
click Configure.
The VNC Server Password dialog box opens.
10. Enter and confirm the password you want to use for remote access.
Click OK to close the dialog box, and click OK to close the Properties
dialog box.
The Information dialog box opens.
11. Click Next.
The final dialog box opens, indicating that you’ve completed the 
installation.
12. Click Finish.

You might need to configure your firewall to allow RealVNC to act as a server.
If you’re using ZoneAlarm, for example, you’ll receive a Security Alert. I use
ZoneAlarm as an example in Chapter 10, where I discuss using a firewall in
more detail.
Setting up Hamachi
With RealVNC installed and configured on the computers you want to use as
host and client, you’re now ready to download and install the Hamachi VPN
client. With the executable client downloaded from http://hamachi.cc
and saved to your desktop, you’re ready to begin the installation and configu-
ration process:
1. Double-click the Hamachi setup icon on your desktop.
The Hamachi Setup Wizard opens.
2. Click Next.
The Hamachi agreement dialog box opens.
3. Accept the agreement, if you find it acceptable and want to continue,
and click Next.
The Hamachi Setup dialog box opens.
4. Don’t alter the default values for Installation Location or Start Menu
Group, but do select the Automatically Start Hamachi When You Log
In check box. Click Next.
You’re ready to install the application.
5. Click Install.
The installation progress window opens, displaying each element as it’s
installed.
6. When all the elements have been installed, click Next.
The Hamachi Quick Guide opens, along with a strange-looking rectangu-
lar object, shown in Figure 12-3. The gray obelisk is the Hamachi client.
7. Read the Welcome and Control information and click Next after
you’ve familiarized yourself with the information contained in each
dialog box.
The Hamachi Address information dialog box opens.
8. Read the information, and click the Power button located at the lower
left corner of the Hamachi client. (Refer to Figure 12-3.)
The Create An Account dialog box opens.
239
Chapter 12: Accessing Your Home PC Remotely

9. Choose a nickname, and click Create.
10. Once again, you have to configure your firewall to allow the Hamachi
Client to access the Internet. If you’re using ZoneAlarm, select the
Remember this Setting check box, and click Allow.
After the Hamachi client resolves, the connection to your local IP
address appears at the top of the obelisk along with your nickname.
11. Click Next on the Hamachi Quick Guide dialog box.
The Hamachi Quick Guide dialog boxes that follow lead you through the
process of joining a network. (After completing each task described in
the guide, the Next button is enabled. Click it to move to the next dialog
box and task description.)
12. Click the Network icon on the Hamachi client, and select Join Existing
Network from the dialog box.
The Join the Network dialog box opens.
13. Enter test in the Network Name text box, and enter secret in the
Network Password text box. Click Join.
You see that you’ve successfully joined the test network.
14. Follow the prompts in the next couple of Hamachi Quick Guide dialog
boxes to find out more about the network you’ve joined.
15. To leave the test network, right-click the network name and choose
Leave Network from the menu. You can now close the Quick Guide.

Part IV: Securing Your Information 

You need to set up the Hamachi client on each of the computers you want to
include in your network. If you’ve got only one PC at home and one laptop
you take with you on the road, your job is quick and easy. But if you’ve got
several, you might want to get a cup of coffee. Heck, you might want to get
one anyway. Yeah, I’ll take one too; thanks for offering.
Configuring your network
Although not absolutely critical, I recommend configuring your Hamachi VPN
from the host computer. That’s because the PC used to create the network
owns the network, and all the other PCs are just joiners. To begin the net-
work-creation process, start by booting the host computer. If you followed
the steps I laid out in the previous section, you know that, in Step 4, I had you
configure the Hamachi client to start during boot up — so when the PC’s
ready to go, so is the client. With both the computer and Hamachi at the
ready, follow these steps:
1. Click the Network icon on the Hamachi client (it’s the triangle-shaped
one) and choose Create New Network from the menu.
The Create New Network dialog box opens.
2. Type the name you want to assign to your new network in the
Network Name text box.
I call my network OTR Wireless For Dummies.
3. Create and enter the password to be used in the Network Password
text box.
4. Click Create.
Boy, that was tough! I’m all worn out. Don’t worry, though, I won’t rest until
you’ve joined the network and accessed the host computer from a remote
location (even if that’s just another room), with your client PC. Get ready
because this is almost as difficult as creating the network. Here are the steps:
1. Boot the client PC (the one you want to use on the road to access and
control the host).
2. Click the Network icon on the Hamachi client.
3. Choose Join the Network from the menu, and when the dialog box
opens, enter the network name and password in the appropriate fields.
4. Click Join and — poof! — you’re connected to the network, as shown
in Figure 12-4.
241
Chapter 12: Accessing Your Home PC Remotely

You can repeat this grueling exercise with every PC you want to include
in the network, and then, maybe, take a little break. Next, I show you
how to take control of the host PC from the remote client.
Unless you choose to leave the network, you’re connected to it each time you
boot the client computer. If you enable file sharing for this network, you can
access or move files from any of the computers you’ve included in your VPN,
provided they’re online. By connecting a printer (one that you don’t mind
leaving on at all times) to the host, you can print documents stored on the
client PC.
Hamachi uses a mediation server to make the connection between all the
computers included in your VPN. After a connection’s established among
them all, the server hands everything off, and the network communication is
direct between the peers. If, however, the Hamachi server is down when you
boot your PC, you can’t make the VPN connection. It doesn’t happen often,
but you should be aware that it can.
Controlling the host from a remote location
Okay, here’s the fun part. For some unknown reason, having the ability to
take over the desktop of a computer that’s not in the same room or even the
same state as I’m in and manipulate it like I’m sitting right in front of it makes

me feel like I’m one of those highly trained and technically savvy computer
geeks that all the best criminal investigators and counter-terrorism agents
consult. I don’t think I feel, or look, much like my two favorites, though,
because they’re named Abby and Chloe. Anyway, if you want to take remote
control of your host PC, just take the following steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪RealVNC➪VNC Viewer 4➪Run VNC
Viewer.
The Connection Details dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 12-5.
2. Type the local IP address of the host computer, which you can find
listed on the Hamachi client, into the Server text box, and click OK.
The Authentication dialog box opens.
3. Enter your password, and click OK.
I set up a network including one of my laptops and the laptop my wife uses
for school, as shown in Figure 12-6. By making her laptop the host and owner
of the network, I was then able to join the network with my laptop and take
remote control of the host desktop. Pretty cool, eh? The wallpaper is a photo
of Beeker, and it seems like my wife’s got a lot of games on a laptop used for
school, doesn’t it?
As if by magic, the desktop of the host computer opens in a browser window
right there in front of your eyes. By default, the VNC Viewer renders the desk-
top using only 64 colors, but you can, if you so choose, configure it for full-
color renditions of the desktop. To do so, just click the Options button on the
VNC Viewer Connection Details dialog box before making the connection.
You can also configure the elements that the server makes on the host com-
puter. Just right-click the VNC Server icon in the system tray and select
Options; with the Properties dialog box, select the Desktop tab and remove
or disable elements as you choose by selecting the check box next to the
appropriate description. You might want to reduce color renditions and elimi-
nate things like wallpaper in order to reduce bandwidth usage. The more
detail included, the greater the bandwidth being used, and vice versa.

Using Windows XP Pro Remote Desktop
If you have the option of using the Remote Desktop utility included with
Windows XP Pro, you might want to make use of it rather than RealVNC or
some other remote access solution. To circumvent potential roadblocks, I
recommend that you set up a VPN with the Hamachi client as I describe in
the previous section. With your VPN configured, you can then set up the
Remote Desktop feature on your host computer.
Getting started
To use Remote Desktop, you need, at a minimum, the following:
 Windows XP Pro: The host computer (the one you’re leaving at home)
must have XP Pro installed as the operating system.
 Remote Desktop client: The client computer (the one you’re taking on
the road) doesn’t need to be running XP Pro, but it does need to be run-
ning a Windows operating system. The client’s pre-installed on both XP
Figure 12-6:
I set up 
my wife’s
computer as
the host.
244
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

Home and Pro, or if you’re not using one of those, you can download
msrdpcli.exe from Microsoft.
 Name or IP address of host: If you’re making the connection to the host
via, for example, the Hamachi VPN, you need the local IP address or the
name of your PC. If you’re fortunate enough to have a static IP address
for the host PC, make a note of it.
If you’re curious about the names of your computers, choose Start➪
Control Panel➪Performance and Maintenance➪System and click the
Computer Name tab in the System Properties dialog box. The name of your
PC, along with any workgroup to which it might be assigned, is clearly listed
on the screen.
Setting up the host PC
With the host computer up and running, just follow these steps to get it ready
to accept remote control:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Performance and Maintenance➪System.
The System Properties dialog box opens.
2. Click the Remote tab.
3. In the Remote Desktop area, select the check box labeled Allow Users
To Connect Remotely To This Computer.
4. Click OK to enable the changes, and close the dialog box.
The other issues you might have to deal with, depending on your situation, 
in configuring the host computer for remote access and control include the
following:
 Firewall: If you’re using ZoneAlarm, I recommend attempting to access
the host computer from the client PC while you’re still in the same room
with them both. In that way, you can allow the connection to be made
and make certain that ZoneAlarm remembers the setting. I discuss con-
figuring ZoneAlarm in more detail in Chapter 10. If you’re using the
Windows Security Center firewall, you can follow these steps to config-
ure it to allow the Remote Desktop utility to be used:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Security Center.
The Windows Security Center screen opens.
2. Click Windows Firewall.
The Windows Firewall dialog box opens.
245
Chapter 12: Accessing Your Home PC Remotely

3. Clear the check mark in the box to the left of Don’t Allow
Exceptions and select the Exceptions tab.
4. Be sure that a check mark appears to the left of Remote Desktop
and click OK.
 Port forwarding: If your host computer is connected to a router, consult
the user’s manual for port forwarding instructions and forward port
3389 to the host.
Preparing your client
If you’ve got Windows XP Pro or Windows XP Home edition on the client com-
puter, then chances are good that you’ve got all you need. It’s possible, how-
ever, that you might need to get your XP installation CD out from its hiding
place. With your CD in hand, insert it in the CD drive and, when the Welcome
screen opens, click Perform additional tasks➪Setup Remote Desktop
Connection and follow the prompts.
If Windows XP isn’t your operating system, then visit the following page and
download msrdpcli.exe:
http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/tools
rdclientdl.mspx 
Install the utility as usual, and you’re all set.
Making the connection
With all the previous steps completed, you’re ready to take control of the
world. Oh . . . sorry, sometimes I get carried away. I doubt it’s even possible
to take control of a small unsuspecting country. You can take control of the
host computer, though, by following these steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Communications➪
Remote Desktop Connection.
The Remote Desktop Connection dialog box opens.
2. In the Computer text box, type the name or IP address, whichever
might be appropriate, and click Connect, as shown in Figure 12-7.
3. With the Log On to Windows dialog box open, type your username
and password into the appropriate text fields.
4. Click OK.
246
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

There you go; you’re looking at the host computer desktop, and for the most
part, it works just like you’re sitting right in front of it. When you’re ready to
end your remote session, just click Start and log off.
Getting Your Feet Wet 
with LogMeIn Free
LogMeIn Free is a subscription service that connects the client (local) PC
with the host (target) PC over the Internet. Using LogMeIn Free in conjunc-
tion with either RealVNC or Remote Desktop is different from using the
Hamachi VPN. Whereas the Hamachi mediation server initiates the connec-
tion and then hands it off, the LogMeIn server never severs itself from the
network connection. Instead, the connection between the host and local com-
puters is maintained and secured through the LogMeIn servers. Another dif-
ference is that you need to install LogMeIn Free on only the host computer.
It’s just ridiculously easy to use and depending on your needs, LogMeIn Free
might be all you require. In order to get the versatility afforded you by setting
up a network with Hamachi and using RealVNC or Remote Desktop, you’d
have to opt for the paid LogMeIn service rather that the free service, but
believe me, for most people, LogMeIn Free is all you need.
Setting up LogMeIn on your host PC
You can install the LogMeIn software on as many computers as you like, but if
you need only remote access and control of one (the host), that’s the only
one on which the software need be installed. Using the host computer, follow
these steps:
1. Open a Web browser, and visit the LogMeIn Web site (https://
secure.logmein.com). Click the link to LogMeIn Free, and follow-
ing the prompts, set up your account.
Figure 12-7:
Connect
with Remote
Desktop.
247
Chapter 12: Accessing Your Home PC Remotely

2. With that complete, you’re given the opportunity to install either a
free trial version of the LogMeIn Pro software or just the LogMeIn
Free application. Decide which one you want to install.
It’s up to you, but you might want to give the Pro version a whirl just so
you know what it includes and whether or not you might be willing to
pay $70 per year for the extra bells and whistles. If you find that ringing
the bells and blowing the whistles is worth the bucks, you’re all set; if
not, you can simply opt for the free version and bounce merrily along
your way.
With that decision out of the way, you’re now ready to install the 
software.
3. Depending on your browser configuration, you might be given
prompts to install a plug-in or two before continuing, and you might
need to verify the digital signature or security certificate.
Install and verify as needed, making the choices that enable you to run
the application.
4. With the installation wizard open, follow the prompts to click Next or
agree to the EULA until you get to the Computer Description window.
The Description window displays your computer name, and if you
choose, you can change the name to something more descriptive or
appropriate.
5. When you click Next, the installation begins and the familiar green
installation status bars start flashing away. Click Finish, and you’re
ready to go.
LogMeIn requires that you use a username and password to make a remote
connection. If you don’t normally use them to log on to the target PC, then,
during the application installation process, you’ll be asked to create a
Computer Access Code. (If you’re not asked to create the Computer Access
Code, you simply use your normal logon name and password.) You’re going
to need this information, so make sure you can either remember it easily or
make a note of it that you store separately.
Configuring firewalls to allow 
remote access
If your host computer has a firewall installed, as it should, it’ll block any
attempt to connect with the host from the Internet. Further, if you’re using
ZoneAlarm, during the installation process, you notice that you must first
248
Part IV: Securing Your Information 

allow LogMeIn to act as a server and allow the LogMeIn Desktop Application
to access the trusted zone. If your host computer’s running an OS other than
Windows XP and using ZoneAlarm, you might also find that other application
elements need to be allowed to act as a server, or access the Internet and
trusted zones. It’s best to put LogMeIn through its paces while you’re actually
sitting right in front of both the host and client computers. In that way, you’ll
be able to configure your particular firewall as it puts up roadblocks.
Accessing the host remotely
One interesting feature regarding LogMeIn is that you can access your home
PC from almost any computer that has a Web browser and a connection to
the Internet. (Although I don’t recommend this, you could potentially use a
public computer as the local PC connecting to the host.) To begin a remote
session:
1. Visit the LogMeIn Web site, and log on with the e-mail address and
password you used to create your account.
2. Click the LogMeIn button.
The My Computers page opens, and you find your target PC listed.
3. Click the icon, and the connection process begins.
If this is the first time you’ve attempted to begin a remote session, it’s
likely that a browser plug-in might need to be installed. If this is the
case, depending on the browser you use, you’re either prompted to
install the plug-in or it’s installed automatically. With that step out of the
way, the connection process continues.
4. When prompted, enter the Computer Access Code you created during
the installation process or the username and password you normally
employ to gain access to the target PC. Then click Login.
On the next page, decide whether you want to view the target PC desk-
top in either a new browser window or the current one. You can also
choose to make display configuration changes or access the help
resources.
5. Make your choices, and click Go.
One more configuration window opens, giving you another opportunity
to customize your connection.
6. Make your selections, click Proceed and, before you know it the 
desktop of the target PC is displayed before your eyes, as shown in
Figure 12-8.

Talking Cheap with VoIP 
In This Chapter
 Understanding VoIP
 Comparing providers
 Gathering the gear
 Setting up Skype
A
few years ago, while reading a popular magazine, I came across an arti-
cle devoted to a new technological development that enabled some
folks to make phone calls using the Internet, instead of wires, to carry the
voice stream. After reading about this new technology called Voice over
Internet Protocol (VoIP), I was instantly excited about the potential VoIP pre-
sented for easing and enhancing long-distance communication for the travel-
ing public. (Traveling public meaning, at the time, me, but because I’m such a
magnanimous guy, I now also include you.)
Since that time, VoIP has gone from being a cutting-edge technology used
mainly by geeks to a mainstream technology used by everyone from geeks to
grammas. And with more and better software and hardware choices, it’s both
proving and expanding on its potential as a valuable communication tool for
travelers.
In this chapter, I help you decide whether VoIP might be a useful tool by first
giving you a basic understanding of what VoIP is and also helping you set up
a free but powerful VoIP solution. In between, I help you decide which VoIP
provider might be best suited to your purposes and point out some of the
hardware choices that can get you started and enhance your experience. I
also try to point out a few of the problems you might face while using VoIP in
a mobile environment.
Exploring VoIP
The importance of communication in trucking is rivaled only by that of diesel
fuel. Most trucks today have satellite systems, and some companies also

pay either part or all of a driver’s cellphone bill. With these developments,
communication between drivers and dispatch has improved to the point that
land lines are the option of last resort. Communication between drivers and
their family and friends, however, is a different subject.
When I was full time on the road, I was constantly irritated by the amount of
money it cost me to stay in touch. Calling cards were usually the best bet, but
I had to sit in a cramped phone booth or take up space in the restaurant while
diners eavesdropped on my conversations. When I started using a cellphone,
things got better because I could sit in the privacy of my truck, but I was still
spending somewhere around ten cents a minute to talk, in addition to a phone
bill at home. This situation was, essentially, mirrored by those in RVs.
And then along comes VoIP. Computer geeks had been using the computer for
voice communication since the early– to mid–’90s, and some mainstream
VoIP software products began to appear on the market by 1996. Using dialup
for VoIP communication was a little bit cumbersome, and at least when I first
became aware of it, you couldn’t make calls to the public switched telephone
network (PSTN) or Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) phones. So VoIP, at
that time, had limited utility. Not so today.
Understanding the basics
It’s now quite possible, in many cases, to carry on a reasonable conversation
over a dialup connection, and when conversing via broadband, the call qual-
ity’s sometimes better than using a cellphone or POTS. Further, not only is it
now possible to make VoIP calls originating from a computer and terminating
at any type of phone (or vice versa), but it’s also possible to make phone-to-
phone calls carried over the Internet instead of PSTN.
Wi-Fi, though, presents a few problems that can sometimes adversely affect
the quality of calls made using VoIP. For several reasons — some of them
inherent in all Wi-Fi transmissions and some of them more likely to be pre-
sent in a truck stop or RV park environment — Wi-Fi tends to drop or lose
some packets that carry the phone conversation from one point to another.
The result is latency, or speech that sounds clipped, which can make a con-
versation more difficult. But this doesn’t happen all or even most of the time.
Even considering some of the problems, VoIP isn’t impossible or overly irri-
tating to use in a mobile environment. Further, the 802.11e wireless standard
has been developed specifically to deal with quality of service issues facing
voice and multimedia transmission over IP. (I introduce wireless standards
in Chapter 2.) As more and more wireless equipment supporting this stan-
dard is deployed, the problems might become not just an exception, but
downright rare.

Part V: Taking Care of Business 

Getting started
I originally became interested in VoIP service because I wanted to increase
the amount of time I could spend talking with friends and family and reduce
the amount of money I was spending to do so. At the time I began my investi-
gation into the ways I could use VoIP on the road, most of the software pro-
grams were relatively inexpensive and although the person I was calling also
needed to have the software installed on their computer, no fees beyond the
initial purchase of the software and the cost of my Internet connection were
necessary. That’s not always the case any longer, but my original goal, cheap
conversation, is still quite possible.
To start making use of this technology while traveling, you need the following:
 VoIP service: Although some services are targeted more toward the
home user than the traveling public, several services truly cater to trav-
elers. When searching for a service, you find two basic types:
• Computer-based: By installing software on your computer, you can,
with an attachment or two, turn it into a phone. Because less hard-
ware is needed, this is usually the preferred choice for truckers and
RVers.
• Converter-based: With a broadband Internet connection at home,
you can connect a VoIP converter, known as an Analog Telephone
Adapter (ATA), to your modem and connect a traditional phone to
the converter. In some cases, you can also connect the converter
to a computer and make your calls that way. Converter-based sys-
tems are targeted toward residential and business customers.
 Internet connection: High-speed broadband connections are best, but
several of the computer-based solutions support VoIP over a dialup
connection as well. If you’re at a hotspot that connects to the Internet
via satellite or if you have a satellite Internet connection, making a VoIP
call might be tedious, or even impossible, due to latency. (I discuss the
latency that’s inherent to satellite connections in Chapter 9.)
There can be no doubt that faster connections make for better call quality.
 Compatible computer: Unless you’re using a converter-based VoIP solu-
tion, you need a computer. Most laptops are likely capable of making use
of VoIP services, and several Pocket PCs and PDA devices can be used.
Recently, a few manufacturers — including NETGEAR, Linksys, and
UTStarcom — have developed VoIP-based phones that look a whole lot
like a cellphone. For example, check out the NETGEAR phone in Figure 13-1.
These Wi-Fi phones are equipped with the hardware necessary to make a 
Wi-Fi connection and the software necessary to make VoIP calls. Currently,
255
Chapter 13: Talking Cheap with VoIP

though, these phones have issues that make them difficult — or in some
cases impossible — to use at most paid hotspots. I suspect, however, that
most of these problems will be overcome in the near future.
Selecting a Service
Not surprisingly, when you begin to search for VoIP services and software, you
find quite a large menu of selections. Some offer converter-based solutions,
some offer computer-based solutions, and some offer a combination of the two.
As you consider which is best suited for your situation, consider the following:
 Intended use: Will you be using VoIP primarily or exclusively while travel-
ing, or will you be combining the use of VoIP between both home and
road? Further, what type of calls do you think you’ll most often be making?
Will they be . . . ?
• Computer-to-computer: If all, or even most, of your calls will both
originate and terminate with computers, then a computer-based
service and software is likely your best choice.
• Computer-to-phone: If the majority of calls originate from a computer
and terminate with a traditional phone, computer-based service
and software should be high on your list of potential choices.
• Phone-to-computer: Phone-to-computer calls, especially those
between family members at home and those on the road, will prob-
ably benefit most from a service that offers a combination of both
converter– and computer-based services.

Part V: Taking Care of Business 

• Phone-to-phone: These types of calls generally originate at home. If
this is the type of call you most often make, a converter-based ser-
vice might be best suited for you.
 Incoming calls: Several services support incoming calls, offering a per-
sonal phone number (sometimes referred to as Direct Inward Dialing, or
DID), but don’t expect to get this feature free of charge. If this feature is
important to you, then you might also want to include the following
related features:
• Area code choice: Most VoIP providers allow you to choose your
own area code, making it cheap and easy for friends and family who
might not have adopted VoIP for themselves to call you on the road.
Some even allow you to have more than one incoming number.
• Voicemail: Because you can’t be connected to Wi-Fi while you’re
driving, there are probably going to be instances when you miss
incoming calls. Voicemail could come in handy.
• Call forwarding: If your absence will be extended, especially if
extended absences are frequent, a call forwarding feature could be
invaluable.
• Caller ID: Do you like it at home? You’ll love it on the road.
• Conference calling: Sometimes three-way calling is the maximum
number you can include in a conference call, but a few providers
offer the ability to conference as many as 10 calls.
 911 calling: If you’re considering replacing your traditional home phone
with a converter-based service that also offers the use of a computer-
based soft phone (a software utility that enables you to make and
receive calls on your laptop) for traveling, you want to know whether
911 calling is a supported service.
Though you might be considering the use of VoIP at home, you might not
be quite ready to trash your traditional phone service. Or maybe the VoIP
service you’d like to use doesn’t yet offer 911 calling. Either way, you
might be able to get a VoIP converter that also supports POTS. That way,
you can still use VoIP for long distance and maintain the ability to make
emergency calls using the same handset. If that sounds good, make sure
you ask about it when you’re interviewing prospective providers.
 Cost: In some cases, you might be able to use VoIP absolutely free. As
with many things that are free, though, some restrictions do apply. The
calls, almost without exception, must be computer to computer, and
both the call originator and recipient must use the same service or soft-
ware. Almost everything that falls outside those parameters will result in
a charge of some kind.
257
Chapter 13: Talking Cheap with VoIP

Comparing converter-based services
If one of the reasons you’re considering VoIP is to reduce both your home
and mobile phone bills, you might want to consider signing up with a service
that provides an ATA for your home and a soft phone for the road. To be sure,
you can achieve this worthy goal by setting up a computer-based system that
can be used at home and away, but a converter-based service is likely to offer
features and capabilities making the transition from traditional to Internet
phone service almost seamless.
However, if you’re thinking of trashing your traditional phone service, con-
sider these issues:
 E911: Developed, initially, for use with cellphones, the E911 service as
implemented by the VoIP providers’ converter-based systems differs
from the traditional phone 911 service in the following ways:
• Power outage: During a power outage, you’ll have no 911 availabil-
ity. Of course, if all you’ve got in the house are cordless phones,
then there’s no difference.
• ISP problems: If your Internet service is disrupted for any reason,
you won’t be making emergency calls. Or any calls at all, for that
matter.
• Registration: E911 is available in certain areas only, and even then,
you need to register your address with the 911 call center. If you
move, forget to register your new address, and call 911, they’ll be
on their way to your old house.
 Broadband connection: All of the converter-based services I’m aware of
require the use of a high-speed broadband Internet connection.
 Multiple providers: If any problems crop up, you might find yourself in
the middle while your broadband ISP blames the VoIP provider and the
VoIP provider blames the ISP.
Converter-based VoIP service providers target their service toward business
and residential customers. Because of this, and because of the requirements
of E911 service, not every provider offers service throughout the U.S. That
doesn’t mean you can’t take advantage of VoIP services, but it does mean
that you might need to look more closely at a computer-based solution if you
can’t find a provider in your area.
258
Part V: Taking Care of Business 

Those offering VoIP services that might be compatible with your intended
use include the following:
 AT&T CallVantage: When AT&T divested themselves of many core busi-
ness components, they did keep the VoIP service. Makes you think,
doesn’t it? You can find them on the Web at www.usa.att.com/
callvantage/index.jsp.
 Vonage: They might not be the oldest residential and business VoIP
provider, but they’re most definitely the most recognized. You can find
them at www.vonage.com.
 Packet8: Offering several innovative features and options including
broadband VideoPhone service, Packet8 has also partnered with
CounterPath to offer an accompanying soft phone feature for use with
a laptop. They’re found at www.packet8.net.
 BroadVoice: Their unlimited plan includes service to the U.S., Canada,
and 19 other countries. They also offer — either instead of or in addition
to the ATA converter — a Wi-Fi phone for use at home. You can easily
find them at www.broadvoice.com.
 Anya VoIP: This is one of the lowest-cost residential VoIP providers
offering full-featured service. They’re located on the Web at www.
anyavoip.com.
 iConnectHere: The deltathree company offers both residential, converter-
based service requiring a high-speed broadband connection as well as
computer-based service that can get by fine on dialup. You can get more
information at www.iconnecthere.com.
As you compare these services, be sure to check the cost per month, activa-
tion fees, the cost of an ATA converter, the cost of an extra phone number if
you need one, and the availability of a soft phone.
Comparing computer-based services
Computer-based PC-to-PC and PC-to-phone services and software are, at least
in my opinion, more appropriate for use in a mobile environment than their
converter-based counterparts. Although most of the converter-based services
offer a soft phone for use with your laptop, you might get fewer features on
the road than you do at home. In addition, you pay a set monthly fee for your
VoIP service, whereas many computer-based systems offer free calls between
those using the same service or software.
259
Chapter 13: Talking Cheap with VoIP

For example, if you use a computer-based service, you might never incur a
charge of any kind if you limit your VoIP use to calls made between yourself
and your home or the homes of family and friends also subscribing to the
same service. If you do make calls outside those bounds, in most cases, you
pay for only the time you actually use. Does this then replace your home
phone? Well, not if you want to maintain 911 services, but it can eliminate
the cost for long-distance calls between all those subscribing to the service.
ATA converters that support computer-based services, like the VoSKY Internet
Phone Wizard from Actiontec, designed to be used in conjunction with Skype,
make it possible to more easily use these services in a home environment. You
still don’t get 911 capability, so you probably want to keep your traditional
POTS line, but you won’t have to be tethered to your computer to make VoIP
calls from home. You can find this device by visiting the Actiontec Web site at
www.actiontec.com.
Among the many established and upstart entities offering computer-based
services and software are the following:
 Skype: After eBay purchased Skype for $2.6 billion, a lot of Skype users
worried that elements of the service they’d come to know and love — like
free Skype-to-Skype calls — would change. Founders Niklas Zennström
and Janus Friis might be driving better cars or flying on private jets; but
for the most part, the basics are the same, and the improvements are
positive. You can find Skype on the Web at www.skype.com.
 NetZeroVoice: Offering free PC-to-PC calls between NetZeroVoice users,
this service also offers a monthly subscription service that allows unlim-
ited PC-to-PC, PC-to-phone, and (by assigning a personal phone number)
phone-to-PC calling. Their Web address is www.netzerovoice.com.
 Gizmo Project: Developed by SIPphone, Gizmo Project (besides having a
catchy name and a host of features) is working on an agreement with
Google Talk that’ll allow users of the two services to freely call each
other. You can find them at www.gizmoproject.com.
 CrystalVoice LIVE: CrystalVoice software powers a portion of the NetZero
Voice service as well as CrystalVoice LIVE. The biggest drawback to
CrystalVoice LIVE is the inability to receive calls. They’re worth checking
out, though, by visiting www.crystalvoicelive.com.
 FWD: Otherwise known as Free World Dialup, this service was, initially, a
PC-to-PC service requiring both parties to have the FWD client installed
on their computer. Currently, they’re implementing services to also
include phone-to-PC and PC-to-phone capability. You can find them at
www.freeworlddialup.com.
As you compare these services, ask how much each provider charges for
user-to-user calls, PC-to-phone calls, phone-to-PC calls. You may also want
to ask if a provider’s service is compatible with dial-up and whether you can
get voicemail.
260
Part V: Taking Care of Business 

Because of the low protocol overhead designed into both CrystalVoice LIVE
and NetZeroVoice services, they’re both well suited for those using Internet
connections like satellite systems, in which latency and data transfer (FAP)
limitations might be an issue. See Chapter 9 for more details on satellite
connections.
Several WISPs, including Flying J Communications, are poised to begin offering
a VoIP solution bundled with their Internet services. By tailoring a VoIP ser-
vice to an existing or upgraded network, it might be possible (might being the
operative word here) to reduce a few of the potential problems and irritations
faced by those using VoIP in a truck stop parking lot.
Turning Your Laptop into a Phone
Using my laptop to make calls is just another one of those cool things that
makes me feel like maybe I’ve entered the 21st century along with everyone
else. Some of you who’ve grown up in the computer age might be a little less
impressed, but for those among you who, like me, remember the words FOR-
TRAN and COBOL or have ever wondered what happened to those little index
cards with the rectangular holes punched in them, just carrying a computer
around in a satchel is amazing. Using it as a phone is downright inspirational.
In order to begin making phone calls from your computer, you need a couple
of items:
 VoIP provider: My suggestion, just to get you started, is that you choose
a VoIP provider that offers free PC-to-PC calls between common users.
You might also want to make calls from your PC to traditional phones, so
the VoIP provider you choose should offer that option as well.
 Phone hardware: There are quite a number of possible choices for the
hardware necessary, ranging from a simple microphone used in conjunc-
tion with your computer’s built-in speakers to USB devices that allow
you to connect a cordless phone to your laptop. Among your choices
are the following:
• Headset: I kind of like headsets. I got the one I own and use from
RadioShack — it’s similar to the multi-function, full-purpose
Plantronics Audio 320 (shown in Figure 13-2). It consists of a pair
of headphones, a swiveling microphone boom, and a pair of jacks
for microphone and speaker on a long cord. It’s ideal for VoIP,
speech recognition, video conferencing, and voice recording.
• USB phone adapter: Quite a number of manufacturers offer adapters,
making it possible to connect a traditional phone to your computer.
In some cases, providing the phone and VoIP providers support it,
you can even get caller ID on the phone.
261
Chapter 13: Talking Cheap with VoIP

Finding the hardware you need
So, where do you find the stuff you need? Well, several of the VoIP providers,
like Skype and NetZeroVoice, also offer equipment and accessories to make
your VoIP experience more enjoyable. Several other manufacturers offer an
extensive menu of choices as well. Included among those you might want to
visit are:
 Actiontec: The VoSKY product line’s designed to be used with Skype ser-
vice and includes a speakerphone known as the Chatterbox, the VoSKY
Call Center, and the Internet Phone Wizard. They’re located on the Web
at www.actiontec.com.
 PhoneConnector: Offering an innovative USB-to-RJ-11 phone adapter bun-
dled with software that recognizes your VoIP provider, PhoneConnector
rings your cordless phone and can even display caller ID on compatible
phones. You can find them by browsing to www.phoneconnector.com.
 Plantronics: Scroll down the menu on the left side of the page at www.
plantronics.com and click the Computer link. The page that opens
lists a variety of solutions and accessories. Plantronics is known for
high-quality cellular headsets, and they bring that reputation to bear
on products designed to enhance the VoIP experience.
 AUVI Technologies: Offering more stuff than you can shake a stick at,
you can find them on the Web at www.auviusa.com.
 RadioShack: Finding headsets on their Web site can be a bit confusing,
but if you just search for “computer headsets,” you’ll find them listed
under the heading “Computers.” It’s easier to go to one of their bricks ’n
mortar stores, but if you insist, you can find them on the Web at www.
radioshack.com/home/index.jsp.
Figure 13-2:

 CrystalVoice LIVE: Their online accessory store is filled with several
items, like the Actiontec InternetPhoneWizard, specially designed to be
used with CrystalVoice LIVE service and software. You can find them on
the Web at www.crystalvoicelive.com.
Getting started with Skype
After you’ve found yourself a suitable headset or phone device, the next step
in turning your laptop into a phone is to sign up with a service and download
the software. I like Skype, so that’s the service I use as an example as I
explain how to set up service with a provider. Free Skype-to-Skype calls got
me hooked, initially, but what’s keeps me interested is their commitment to
continuing quality. There’s a lot of competition these days, and it seems like
you hear about an upstart VoIP service every week. But Skype has been
around for a while, still offers free and reasonably priced services, and is
easy to use. In short, it’s a good choice for getting your feet wet with VoIP,
and you just might stick with Skype for the long haul.
Installing Skype software
Getting Skype is both free and easy:
1. Visit the Skype Web site (www.skype.com), click Download on the
toolbar, and then click the Windows link. On the page that appears,
click the Get It Now! button.
2. Click Download, and save the file to disk.
The setup file is almost 10MB, so it takes a minute or three, even on a
high-speed connection.
3. Double-click the Skype setup icon.
4. If you use ZoneAlarm as your firewall, you’re notified that Skype
Setup is trying to access the Internet. Select Remember This Setting,
and click Allow.
The Skype Setup Wizard opens.
5. Select the language you want to use during the setup process, and
click Next.
The EULA window opens.
6. Accept the agreement, if in fact you do and want to continue, and
click Next.
The Select Destination Location window opens. 
263
Chapter 13: Talking Cheap with VoIP

7. You don’t want to alter the default location, so just click Next.
The Select Additional Tasks window opens.
8. Select the Create a Desktop Icon check box and/or Start Skype When
the Computer Starts, if you choose. Then click Next.
I prefer not to start Skype on boot-up, but if you’re planning on receiving
calls you might want Skype to start when the computer does.
The installation status window opens followed by the final Wizard
window.
9. Click Finish.
At this point, the software’s installed, and you now need to configure your fire-
wall to allow Skype access to the Internet. If you, like me, employ ZoneAlarm,
the configuration requires little more than selecting Remember this Setting
and clicking Allow when Prompted. In ZoneAlarm, you need to do this once
when Skype desires access to the trusted zone and once when it requests
access to the Internet. If you’re using the Windows Firewall, follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Security Center➪Windows Firewall.
The Windows Firewall dialog box opens.
2. Be sure the box to the left of Don’t allow exceptions is clear and click
the Exceptions tab.
3. Skype should appear in the list under Programs and Services but, if it
doesn’t, click Add Program, select it from the Add a Program menu,
and click OK.
4. Put a check mark in the box to the left of Skype and click OK.
Configuring Skype
With the software installed and the firewall configured to allow Internet
access, the Skype client is open, and you’re now ready to configure Skype for
use. The first step is to set up your Skype Account. Click the Don’t Have A
Skype Name? link and follow these steps:
1. With the Create Account window open, enter the required informa-
tion in the text entry fields, choose whether you want to be signed in
when Skype starts, whether you want Skype to start when the com-
puter starts, and indicate that you’ve read and agree to the terms of
the EULA. Click Sign In.
The Help your friends find you window opens. (You might have to con-
figure ZoneAlarm to allow Skype to act as a Server.)
264
Part V: Taking Care of Business 

2. Enter the appropriate information in the text entry fields and click
Next.
The Getting Started Wizard opens, the Skype client is updated with
the provided information, and you see Skype Test Call under the con-
tacts tab.
3. In preparation to make a test call, connect your headset or phone
device to the computer so you can both speak and hear.
4. Turn your attention to the Getting Started Wizard and click Start.
5. Following the instructions on page 1 of the Wizard click the green Call
icon, as shown in Figure 13-3.
You’re connected to the Skype Test recording.
6. Follow the instructions to test your call sound settings.
7. With the test call completed familiarize yourself with the remaining
three Getting Started Wizard pages and, when you reach the final
page, click Search Now.
(The Getting Started Wizard can be accessed at any time from the Help
menu.)
The Import Contacts wizard opens.
8. Click Start.
The Checking Your Address Books page opens. You see a check box for
each address book Skype finds.
Figure 13-3:
Click the
green Call
icon.
265
Chapter 13: Talking Cheap with VoIP

9. Select the address books you want to search and click Next.
Page two of the Checking your address books screen opens.
10. Read the instructions and click Search.
11. Once the search is complete click Next.
12. Depending on the information gleaned from the search, you have the
following options:
• If you find that you already know a few people using Skype, you’re
given the opportunity to Say Hello!
• If not, or after you finish saying hello, you’re then given the oppor-
tunity, by putting a check mark next to the e-mail address, to send
a Join Skype e-mail invitation to selected contacts.
13. With any hellos and invitations done, and after following all the
prompts, the final page of the Import Contacts Wizard opens. Click
Finish and you’re nearly ready to begin making calls.
Making and Receiving Calls
My primary purpose in setting up Skype was to make free phone calls to my
wife. To achieve that goal I also had to install Skype on the computer she’d be
using. With that done we were able to freely call one another whenever we
were both online. That worked out pretty well and, with our recently added
Actiontec Internet Phone Wizard, it’s now even easier. Further, by inviting
other friends and family members to install and use Skype we’re all able to
stay in touch for the cost of an Internet connection.
Calling another Skype user
Before you can call another Skype user you’ve got to find one. To do this you
can follow these steps:
1. Open the Skype client and click Add Contacts.
The Skype Add a Contact window opens.
2. Type the Skype Name, full name or e-mail address of the contact you’d
like to add in the text entry field, and click Search.
The contact information opens below the search parameters.
266
Part V: Taking Care of Business 

3. Select the contact from the list and click Add Selected Contact.
The Say Hello! To... window opens, as shown in Figure 13-4.
4. Click Options and choose whether or not to share information.
5. Click OK to send a greeting, closing the Say Hello! To... window, and
click Close to close the Add a Contact window.
With your new contact information added to the Skype client you can now
make your call. If the party with whom you wish to speak is online the icon
next to their name is green; if not, the icon’s grey. If they’re online all you
have to do is select your contact and click the green Call icon. Their com-
puter begins to ring and a little notification screen, indicating an incoming
call, pops up. They answer the phone and you converse. Cool. By the way, to
answer a call all you’ve got to do is click the green phone icon.
Calling anyone and everyone
Another reason for making VoIP calls is to reduce the costs incurred when call-
ing those folks who’re using traditional phone service. To do this with Skype,
you must first sign up for SkypeOut and buy some credits. To do so simply visit
the Web site, follow the SkypeOut link, and purchase a block of time.
Before you can purchase either SkypeOut or SkypeIn credits you need to
verify your e-mail address. When you sign up for Skype they send you an
e-mail asking for verification. You can choose to copy the verification code
from this e-mail and enter it when prompted on the Web site or follow the
verification link included in the e-mail.
Figure 13-4:
The Say
Hello!
window is
where you
begin a call.
267
Chapter 13: Talking Cheap with VoIP

With a few dollars worth of credit you’re now ready to make a call. Here’s
how it works:
1. You can either click the Call Phones icon or select the Dial tab to open
the soft phone dial pad, shown in Figure 13-5.
2. Enter the number you want to call.
To call any number, no matter where it is, even if it’s your next door
neighbor, you must dial the complete number including the country
code and area code. The country code for the U.S. is +1. To dial the plus
sign on the Skype dial pad you need to click and hold the 0. After a
second the plus sign appears near the bottom of the dial screen; you can
then release the mouse button and continue selecting numbers.
3. Click the green Call icon and the connection process begins.
After your call is over, the Add a Contact screen appears and you have
the option to include this number with your other contacts. The number
you dialed is already entered.
4. If you choose to save the number as a contact, type a name in the text
entry field and click Add Number.
Note that the caller ID displayed on the other end of the call will be unfamil-
iar to the party you’re calling. When I make SkypeOut calls, they’re routed all
over the country but most often, it seems, east coast area codes are dis-
played. At least, that’s what most people tell me they see on their caller ID
screen when I call.

Setting up Skype to receive calls
When you install Skype, you’re ready to receive calls from other Skype users
immediately. If, however, you want to receive calls from those using traditional
phones you need to obtain a SkypeIn number. By following the SkypeIn links
you eventually end up on the Get a SkypeIn Number page where you can
choose the country for which you want a number. For most, choosing a
number in the U.S. will be appropriate but, if, for example, you’ve got friends
in Germany or Japan you could choose a number in one of those countries,
which might make it a whole lot cheaper for them to call you.
Once you make your country selection, and I’ll assume it’s the U.S., you’re
given the opportunity to choose the area code you want to use. If you’ve got
a lot of friends or family in a particular state, maybe one you don’t live in, you
can choose an area code that might enable them to call you without making a
long-distance call. With your area code chosen, all you’ve got to do is select
a number and pay for it. Skype, like some other VoIP providers, charges a
quarterly or annual subscription fee instead of per-minute fees.
You can choose to have as many as ten different SkypeIn numbers, each in a
different area code. Of course, you’ve got to pay for all of them so you might
want to go easy at first.
Once you’ve paid the fees, and they’ve been credited to your account, your
Skype client is updated and you can, because voicemail is free with a SkypeIn
number, set up your voicemail message. A boring and sterile sounding message
is loaded into your voicemail by default but you can easily personalize it by
recording a new one. To accomplish this task follow these steps:
1. Open the Skype client and click Tools➪Voicemail.
The Options dialog box opens with the Call Forwarding & Voicemail
page selected. Near the bottom of the window, you see three icons: a
green Playback button, a red Record button, and a red Reset to Default
button.
2. Click the Playback button to hear the default message. You can
choose to keep it in the event that you really like it; otherwise,
click the Record button, in the center, and record a personalized
message.
3. Click the Playback button to hear your recorded message.
If you hate it, you can record a different message, or if you prefer, you
can reinstate the default message by selecting the Reset button.
269

4. Select the Send Unanswered Calls to Skype Voicemail check box, as
shown in Figure 13-6. Click Save.
You’re now ready to receive calls, and when you’re away, Skype voice-
mail handles the messages. All you’ve got left to do is let people know
how to reach you!

ith more and more husband-and-wife teams taking up the reins of a
big rig, and with ever-growing numbers of families taking to the road
in their RVs, it’s become increasingly important to tend to all kinds of busi-
ness while on the road. Fortunately, it’s also become increasingly possible
to do that because a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from finding freight to
paying bills, has become both easier and more efficient with hardware, soft-
ware, and online solutions targeted toward the traveling public.
In this chapter, I tell you about a few tools that can help you save money and
increase your income, as well as a few tools that can simplify and streamline
your paperwork and record-keeping duties. For example, I tell you about navi-
gational tools that can help you reduce both stress and expenses, and I also
tell you how you can put your paperwork on your computer. In addition, I tell
you about some tools that can help you keep track of where your money goes
and one that can help you keep it from going places it shouldn’t.
Setting Up Your Office
The age-old adage, “The job’s not finished ‘til the paperwork’s done,” still
holds true. Whether you want to admit it, you do manage a mobile office.
Each and every day, no matter whether you’re trying to build a business, or
like me, you’re handling home finances and road-related chores, you engage
in a variety of office-related duties. To help make those jobs easier, a wide

variety of software and hardware tools has been developed. A few areas in
which these tools of technology can assist you in managing the over-the-road
office include:
 Navigation: When you live on the road, navigating is part of your day-to-
day business. Adding GPS (global positioning system) to your toolbox
can help minimize unnecessary miles, help you plan stops to get the
most out of your road time, and generally reduce stress when you’re
trying to find your way.
 Finance: You can handle everything from banking to budgeting to taxes
safely, securely, and quickly from the comfort of your rolling home. Other
tools, like online load matching services, help you increase both income
and efficiency.
 Occupation: If you’re driving a truck, you’ve got state and federally
mandated duties to perform, and in addition, with the cost of everything
from diesel to doughnuts on the rise, it makes sense to use any tool
available to stretch your dollar and avoid unnecessary expenditures.
(I’m pretty sure doughnuts fall into that “unnecessary expenditures”
category, but I’m not aware of any tool that’ll help you avoid them.)
 Organization: The pursuit and administration of business almost always
results in the generation of records and receipts. Managing this outpour-
ing of paper is a job well suited to available software tools.
In addition to your tools, you need space. There can be no doubt; from condo
to cab-over, Class A to camper, no matter the rig, no matter its configuration, if
you’re living on the road, space is at a premium. It’s not generally necessary,
however, to dedicate a specific area of your vehicle to office space. Often
having been designed with an altogether different purpose in mind, mobile
office space almost always does double duty. I use a folding laptop desk while
sitting in the bunk, and you might have another entirely workable workspace
solution.
Aside from a work area, though, there are a couple other reasons to give
more than just a passing thought to the space you have available for office-
related tasks:
 Storage: Depending on your ability — or inability, as the case might be —
to throw things away, documents, records, and receipts have a tendency
to fill all the available space. In an effort to tame the storage shrew, it can
help to classify the types of items to be stored as well as the types of
storage available. For example:
• Indoor: Along with documents or records that you need to update
or access on a regular basis, store any electronic equipment
indoors where the temperature’s likely to be controlled.
• Outdoor: If you’ve got documents, records, or receipts that you just
don’t need to see for a while and the outdoor storage is weather-
proof, there’s no reason to use up your limited indoor space.
272
Part V: Taking Care of Business 

• Digital: Don’t forget the option of digital storage. You can scan doc-
uments into memory, you can defer printing by storing documents
in digital format, and you can sometimes even rely on remote digi-
tal storage.
 Accessibility: The advantage of a dedicated workspace is that all the tools
are at hand and readily accessible. Even if you don’t intend to dedicate a
particular area as a workspace, you should make every effort to keep the
tools and documents you most often use close by and easy to reach.
Navigating by Satellite
A few years ago, I was tooling along the highway in the company of a techni-
cally savvy trucker. We were both on our way to the same remote delivery
destination, and neither of us was familiar with the area. The consignee had
no phone onsite, so calling for directions was out of the question. However,
the driver I was traveling with had added both GPS capability and mapping
software to his computer. With his laptop voicing directions, we were able to
navigate our way to the consignee’s yard without a single misstep. On that
day, I became a believer in the ability of GPS coupled with mapping software
to reduce the level of both my stress and expense.
In the sections that follow, you find the ways in which you can add GPS to
your office. I think you’ll appreciate the extra fuel, the better use of time, and
the reduced stress a GPS system can bring.
Ready-to-use GPS devices
If all the previously mentioned reasons or others of your own have convinced
you that it’s time to start using GPS navigation, you’ve got quite a wide range
of choices available to you. Among the ready-to-use systems are the following:
 Dedicated devices: With one primary purpose, which is to provide accu-
rate voice and visual guidance, these devices are fast becoming the
choice of many. In general, dedicated GPS navigation devices provide
the greatest available feature set, but prices, which are an indication of
included features, can vary from somewhere around $400 to well over
$2,000. Examples of these devices include the following:
• TomTom GO 700: Employing easily updatable TeleAtlas maps the
GO 700 offers door-to-door, turn-by-turn navigation in a very easy to
use, feature rich, package. More information about this and other
TomTom navigation products is available at www.tomtom.com.
• Garmin StreetPilot 2650: Even if you’re in an urban canyon, sur-
rounded by satellite-blocking buildings, the SP 2650, using dead-
reckoning, continues to provide accurate guidance. By adding the
273
Chapter 14: Managing the Over-the-Road Office

optional GTM 10 FM TMC receiver, you can also get real-time traffic
updates. Garmin offers an extensive line of products with various
feature packages at www.garmin.com.
• Magellan RoadMate 760: Giving you voice prompts that include
both the distance to and the name of the upcoming street onto
which you’re about to turn is just one of many features included on
the RM 760. Along with a large selection of GPS navigation prod-
ucts it’s available at www.magellangps.com/en.
• Lowrance iWay 350C: Easily updatable maps combined with a
choice of one 3D display option and two 2D display options are
just a couple of features available with the iWay 350. Lowrance
offers the iWay 350 and iWay 500 GPS mapping devices at www.
lowrance.com.
 Combination devices: A few manufacturers are beginning to offer GPS
navigational devices that also include a wide range of multimedia fea-
tures. These devices often offer the option of integrating real-time traffic
updates with alternate routing capability as well. Included among this
group are the following:
• Pioneer AVIC-N2: Combining a blind-spot camera with a DVD player
and an AM-FM/XM Satellite radio receiver, this unit can also inter-
face with XM NavTraffic to help drivers avoid slowed and con-
gested traffic. XM NavTraffic is available as a standalone
subscription for $9.99 per month or in conjunction with a standard
XM Radio subscription for an additional $3.99 per month. The
AVIC-N2 is available at www.pioneerelectronics.com.
• Garmin StreetPilot 7500: Traffic, weather, and entertainment are all
rolled into a single unit that also offers state-of-the-art GPS naviga-
tion. As with other XM NavTraffic devices, optional equipment and
a subscription are required. You can get more information on this
device from the Garmin Web site at www.garmin.com.
 Handheld devices: Audible voice prompting is one of the features I feel
is essential to a GPS navigational device appropriate for use in an over-
the-road environment. Many handheld devices seem to lack this feature,
but several higher-cost PDAs combined with built-in navigation features
often include voice prompts. A couple you might consider are:
• Garmin iQue M4: This handheld combines a fully functional PDA
with a well-appointed GPS navigational device that provides turn-by-
turn, voice-prompted directions. It’s available at www.garmin.com.
• Magellan Meridian: The GPS Traveler Value Pack includes the
Magellan Meridian Color GPS receiver and adds turn-by-turn guid-
ance, audio prompts, and clear visual indicators to a well-reviewed
handheld navigation device. Available from Magellan at www.
magellangps.com/en.
274
Part V: Taking Care of Business 

Easily upgradeable software is one of the most important features to look
for when searching for any GPS navigation solution. New roads are built
every year, and road construction, even though it never seems like it, does
come to an end. Of course, when one project ends, another one usually
begins, so as you can see, having the ability to update your software to
include new addresses and construction information on a regular basis is
a real benefit.
Adapting a laptop or PDA for GPS
Very few laptops — in fact I know of only one — and just a handful of PDAs
come equipped with GPS capability. Fortunately, though, it’s very easy and
relatively inexpensive to add a GPS receiver to either device. For example,
some GPS navigational systems cost well in excess of $2,000, but you can
adapt a laptop or PDA for less than $200. And while one of the primary rea-
sons to take this route is, undoubtedly, that of economics, you can, in some
cases, end up with a navigational device that has an equal or better feature
set than many standalone models.
A few of the GPS receivers and corresponding or bundled mapping software
available include the following:
 TomTom Navigator 5: By employing a Bluetooth GPS receiver and
Navigator 5 mapping software, this kit can turn your Bluetooth-enabled
PDA into an effective and easy-to-use GPS device. In addition to its
normal capabilities, it provides door-to-door, turn-by-turn, voice-
prompted navigation. Available from TomTom at www.tomtom.com.
275
Chapter 14: Managing the Over-the-Road Office
Finding your way by phone
With GPS-based location technology now
required to be incorporated in newer cellphones,
several companies, including InfoSpace and
MapQuest, are trying to take advantage of the
capability by providing subscription services
that offer, among other things, low-cost naviga-
tion information. InfoSpace Find It! is geared
toward making its online directory accessible to
cellphone users while enhancing current local
information by providing driving directions to
nearby attractions. MapQuest Navigator, on the
other hand, seeks, according to their Web site,
“to turn your phone into a full voice-guided, turn-
by-turn, GPS navigation system.” Other similar
services, offering both point-to-point navigation
and information relevant to a specific location
pin-pointed by GPS, are sure to follow.

 DeLorme: Offering GPS solutions for a variety of applications, two of the
best known GPS receiver and software bundles appropriate for over-the-
road use are the following:
• Earthmate GPS LT-20: DeLorme Street Atlas mapping software is
combined with this USB-powered GPS receiver that transforms
your laptop into a navigational device that both gives and accepts
voice prompts. Available from DeLorme at www.delorme.com/
earthmatelt20/default.asp.
• Earthmate Blue Logger GPS receiver: This Bluetooth receiver can be
used with DeLorme Street Atlas software, turning either your laptop
or PDA into an efficient and effective GPS navigation system.
Available from DeLorme at www.delorme.com/bluelogger/
default.asp.
 Garmin GPS 18: The Garmin 18 GPS receiver, bundled with nRoute and
City Select software, gives you turn-by-turn, voice-prompt directions
that guide you safely to your destination. It’s available from Garmin at
www.garmin.com.
 Microsoft Streets & Trips with GPS locator: Free road construction
updating is just one feature that makes this product worthy of a serious
look. The package is available for both laptops and Pocket PCs, and if
you’ve already got a GPS receiver, you can choose to purchase the
mapping software by itself. You can get more information by visiting
www.microsoft.com/streets/default.mspx.
 ALK Technologies: As developers of the popular PC*MILER mapping
software used by many trucking and related transportation companies,
ALK Technologies is uniquely positioned to provide GPS navigation
solutions with trucking-specific features such as scale and truck stop
locations. Two of their products geared toward truckers are:
• CoPilot Truck/Laptop 4: Routing options let you choose between
the shortest or most practical. In addition, you can choose to
avoid tolls or find routes compatible with HazMat shipments.
The mapping software is available alone, in case you already
have a GPS receiver, or bundled with a Bluetooth-connected or
USB-powered GPS device.
• CoPilot Truck/Mobile: If you’ve got a Bluetooth-enabled Smartphone
running Windows Mobile, you can add GPS navigational capability
to it. Like the laptop software, it includes features important to
truckers.
ALK Technologies also offers a variety of other navigational products
that, although they might lack the trucking-specific information, might
meet your needs if you’d like to turn your laptop or PDA into a GPS navi-
gation tool. You can find them at www.alk.com.
276
Part V: Taking Care of Business 

Hardly any laptop screens and only a few PDA screens are easy to see in
bright sunlight. If you’re making use of one of these devices for navigation,
voice prompts are a must, and I highly recommend the ability to accept voice
commands.
Mounting your device for easy access
If you buy a standalone device designed specifically for GPS navigation, it’s a
good bet that it’ll either come with some sort of mounting device or one will
be available for purchase separately. As a matter of fact, a few require profes-
sional installation because the dead-reckoning features, which are used when
satellites are blocked by buildings or mountains, might, in some cases,
require a tie-in with the vehicle’s speedometer and backup lights. If, however,
you choose to adapt your laptop or PDA for use as a GPS navigator, you also
want it securely mounted in your vehicle.
Looking for a laptop stand
Several laptop mounting solutions are available for those traveling in cars
and SUVs, but far fewer are designed for use in a truck or RV. Key features
that should be high on your list when you begin shopping for a laptop mount-
ing system include
 Shock resistance: You could mount a laptop in your truck or RV by 
duct-taping it to the dash, but because vibration is the enemy of your
hard disk drive — and because it’d look really tacky — I don’t advise
you to do so. Look for a mounting system that offers some method of
absorbing shock.
 Display support: Because your display is fragile, and because it’ll be
open with the vehicle in motion while doing navigational duties, you
want some method of securing the laptop lid.
 No-drill installation: If you’re installing a mount in a company truck or
you just don’t want to drill holes in the floorboard, the no-drill installation
option is well worth shopping for.
With these qualifying features in mind, you can begin your search for a suitable
mounting system. A few of those available that should meet your requirements
include the following:
 RAM Mount: They manufacture a wide variety of mounting systems, and
included in their list of offerings are the RAM-VB-140-SW1 and the RAM-
VB-151-SW1. Both of these mounts are designed to be installed without
drilling, but if neither of these is compatible with your situation, they
also offer a couple of universal vehicle mounts that, although they
require minor drilling, might fill the bill. You can find them on the Web
at www.ram-mount.com.
277
Chapter 14: Managing the Over-the-Road Office

 Jotto Desk: If you’ve ever had the opportunity — or misfortune, as the
case might be — to sit inside a police car, you might’ve seen a Jotto Desk
laptop mount. And, yes, I’ve seen a few. But they also manufacture some
sturdy systems designed for use by truckers and RVers. You can find out
more by visiting www.jottodesk.us.
 Trucker’s Workstation: Distributed by CyberTrucker.net (I love that
name) this unit was designed and developed by a trucker, for truckers.
It features dual cooling fans to help extend the life of your laptop as well
as a sturdy backrest for your laptop lid. You can easily find them on the
Web at www.cybertrucker.net.
 AirDesk: You won’t be able to use this mounting system if you’re passen-
ger seat is usually occupied but, if not, it’s worth a look by browsing to
www.airdesks.com/cardesk.asp.
By locking your laptop to a securely installed laptop stand, you can reduce
the likelihood that your laptop will be stolen if your vehicle is broken into. In
Chapter 10, I mention a few laptop lock manufacturers. You might want to pay
special attention to the LapLocker because it includes a feature that makes it
possible to secure your laptop lid in the open position.
Picking a PDA mount
Because most PDAs incorporate solid-state technology in place of hard drives,
vibration might be less of a factor when you begin searching for the perfect
PDA mounting device; but duct tape isn’t the answer here, either. When you
begin your search, you find a variety of mounting devices available that fall,
generally, into the following three categories:
 Dash mounts: Available in both permanent and semipermanent configu-
rations, these mounting devices sometimes use Velcro or bolts to secure
them to the dash.
 Windshield mounts: Attaching to the windshield through the use of
suction cups, these types of mounts are well suited to travelers who
might not want a more-permanent mounting device. Sometimes short
mounting arms, however, can be a drawback when using this type of
mount in a truck or RV.
 Vent mounts: Using a combination of clips and clutches, these mounts
don’t usually require any kind of permanent installation, making them a
good choice for anyone desiring a dash mount but not wanting to risk
damaging the dash in any way.
All three categories of PDA mounts can usually be found in both powered and
unpowered configurations.
278
Part V: Taking Care of Business 

After you’ve decided the type of mount that most appeals to you or comes
closest to meeting your requirements, you can begin shopping. When you do,
you might include the following manufacturers in your search:
 RAM Mount: Offering a wide variety of mounts covering every category —
including mounts specially designed for both handheld and dedicated
GPS navigational devices — you can find them on the Web at www.
ram-mount.com.
 Arkon Resources: They bill themselves as “The Mobile Mounting
Specialists,” and the description seems to be right on target. Whether
you want to mount a PDA, GPS navigational device, or a cellphone in
your vehicle, you should visit their Web site at www.arkon.com.
 Bracketron: Manufacturing the versatile, one size fits all, FreeWay PDA
Mount, Bracketron can be found by pointing your browser toward www.
bracketron.com.
Using Online Load Matching Services
In 1981, I briefly joined the ranks of owner-operators and got my first taste of
finding freight while sitting in a truck stop far from home. I booked my first
load by browsing through the broker’s offices that were once located on the
back lot of the Iowa 80 Truck Stop in Walcott, IA. Boy, has that place changed
over the years! I spent the better part of that day wandering from office to
office, and while the walk was good for me, my time wasn’t exactly being
used efficiently. Besides that, every time I left one office for another I ran
the risk that I’d miss out on the perfect load.
I finally found a decent westbound load that day, but you could now, simply
by browsing an Internet load board, accomplish in seconds what once
took me hours. Not only that, but by posting your truck on one of these
boards and taking advantage of alarms or alerts, you can take care of other
business while waiting to be notified of one or more loads that meet your 
criteria.
Whenever you contract transportation with a broker or shipper for the first
time, you need to provide pertinent information such as Motor Carrier number
and proof of insurance, often naming the broker or trucking company as a
certificate holder. Some allow you to fax or e-mail scanned documents, while
others require that a third party, like your insurance broker or the carrier
you’re leased to, fax certificates or documents to them.
279
Chapter 14: Managing the Over-the-Road Office

Comparing the contenders
With literally thousands of truck and freight brokerage companies dotting the
landscape, and seemingly every trucking company in America employing at
least one person engaged in brokering excess freight, it’s not surprising that
online load matching services have become increasingly popular. When you
begin browsing the Web in search of freight, you find among those competing
for your subscription dollar the following contenders:
 The Internet Truckstop: Their standard service, providing you meet cer-
tain qualifying criteria, is $25 per month and allows for unlimited search-
ing and posting of trucks and loads. Other services, such as credit
reports, are available at extra cost. If you decide to buy all the bells and
whistles, this can be the most expensive of the load boards, but it’s also
got bells and whistles not offered anywhere else. You can find them on
the Net at www.truckstop.com.
 TruckersEdge: Powered by DAT, one of many TransCore companies, the
TruckersEdge service is tailored to owner-operators and small fleet
owners. Their Owner Operator package is priced at $19.95 per month
and offers a wide range of features beyond simple searches, including
credit scores and accurate mileage and routing. Their Web address is
www.truckersedge.net.
 123Loadboard.com: With a standard plan priced at $20 per month and a
premium package priced at $30 per month, one of the primary reasons
to take a look at 123Loadboard is their ten-day free trial. You can find
them at www.123loadboard.com.
 Getloaded.com: Although all the load matching service Web sites are
easy to navigate, especially after you’ve used them a few times, the
Getloaded.com site is, possibly, the most user-friendly of them all.
Signing up costs you $35 per month, but you can test-drive the service
free for 30 days. They’re located at www.getloaded.com.
Considering alternatives
I’m sure anybody who’s ever spent more than a day driving a truck has heard
of the C.H. Robinson company. For a long time, as a matter of fact, I couldn’t
figure out why one company I drove for wasted money paying the salary of
our inbound dispatcher because all he ever did was tell me to call the nearby
office of C.H. Robinson. Nevertheless, they did a pretty good job of getting us
back home, and now, through their CHRWtrucks Web site, they offer a load
matching service similar to those listed in the previous section. Of course, all
the freight listed is brokered exclusively by C.H. Robinson.
280
Part V: Taking Care of Business 

To use the CHRWtrucks load matching boards, you must first register, and
before you can register you need a CHR ID number, which is more informally
known as a T number. You also need to provide your MC or ICC number, proof
of insurance naming C.H. Robinson as a certificate holder, and a completed
W-9 form. To get more information about using the CHRWtrucks Web site and
load matching service — which, by the way, is free of charge — you can visit
them at www.chrwtrucks.com.
Another interesting alternative, uShip, is one that might just catch on and
change the way some freight, especially household goods, is moved in the
information age. Following in the footsteps of eBay, those wishing to move a
wide range of items from point A to point B put their shipping needs up for
auction, and carriers bid for the business. As a matter of fact, quite a number
of the items available for shipment have been won in an eBay auction in
which the winner must arrange shipping.
One thing I’ve noticed is that a few of those putting shipments up for bid
don’t have much of a clue regarding current shipping costs or requirements.
For example, one recent load(s) up for bid weighed more than 75,000 pounds,
needed to be moved more than 2,500 miles, and the shipper was hoping to
get it done for around $3,000. Still, it’s an interesting concept and at least
worth a look, especially if you find yourself with a little extra room on your
trailer. You can find them on the Web at www.uship.com.
Trucking Simplified with Software
I entered the transportation industry on the cusp of the computer age. Paper
and pencil, although not always used well, was used widely, and I carried a
little ninety-nine cent notebook around with me to keep track of everything
from phone numbers to daily expenses. The notebook I now carry cost in
excess of $1,200, has a keyboard in place of a pencil, and can carry more
information than can be written in ten-thousand notebooks. Especially the
way I write. In addition, with the proper software installed, I can use it in
ways I never dreamed possible in those days of yore.
Keeping your logbook on your laptop
Logbooks have never been my friend, and they’re still not. Rather than get into
a discussion that no one can win concerning the insight or ignorance, depend-
ing on your viewpoint, of the Political Action Committees that have left us with
our current Hours of Service rules and regulations, I point you in the direction
of a couple of software applications that can help to make the chore of main-
taining a logbook a little bit easier. Surprisingly, these programs can also help
pull some valuable information together that’s usable in other areas.
281
Chapter 14: Managing the Over-the-Road Office

It’s now legal in the U.S. and most of Canada to keep your logbook on your
computer, providing that, first, you have a functioning printer capable of print-
ing the current day’s log if requested to do so, and second, you have the previ-
ous seven days’ log pages printed out, signed, and available for inspection.
Among those offering logbook program applications are the following:
 Drivers Daily Log (DDL): Having been around since 1997, it’s the grand-
daddy of logbook programs. This application has so many features and is
so easy to use that I can’t imagine trucking without it. You can download
the Full program and try it free for 60 days. If you don’t think you need all
the bells and whistles, you can, when you buy the license, opt for the Lite
version. DDL can be used “on the fly” between the U.S. and Canada as
well. You can find them on the Web at www.driversdailylog.com.
As you can see in Figure 14-1 in my example log page from a fictitious trip
driving a fictitious truck, this program tracks all sorts of information,
including your duty status, miles, vehicle data, and hours. You also have
the option to include a wide range of other pertinent data such as fuel,
manifest, or trip information. If you do a good job of maintaining these
records, you can, at the end of the month or quarter, generate a multitude
of reports that provide you with a lot of information usable for a variety of
purposes.
Figure 14-1:
DDL is
incredibly

282
Part V: Taking Care of Business 

 Log Calculator: Available from and developed by DieselBoss, the Log
Calculator program requires that Microsoft Excel also be installed on your
computer. The nice thing, though, providing that Excel is installed, is that
it works on a PDA as well as on a laptop. The Log Calculator program is
pretty basic and can’t be used in Canada, but you can beef it up a bit by
opting for their TruckerTracker program that includes some basic book-
keeping features. More information’s available at www.dieselboss.com.
Whether you decide to print pages on a daily basis, you might still find it
necessary to carry a logbook maintained by hand. That’s because not every
company employs compatible log-auditing methods, so your company might
not accept DDL-generated log pages. I’d suggest you download the trial copy,
print out a few pages, and bring them to your safety department for approval.
Several companies have found the DDL Classic log pages compatible with their
programs, and further, DDL has developed several Print Modules that alter the
Classic page in ways that make it compatible with various companies’ log-
auditing programs.
Keeping track of expenses
Failing to acknowledge expenses doesn’t, unfortunately, make them go away.
Quite the contrary. In fact, the more you know about where your money goes
and why it goes there, the better chance you have of reducing over-the-road
expenses. To that end, several software programs have been developed with
the goal of helping truckers with their bookkeeping and accounting chores.
Bookkeeping is something you do so that you know where your money went,
say, for tax purposes. Accounting, on the other hand, is the act of organizing
and analyzing those records in order to make future spending and investment
decisions like, for example, calculating the amount of money to be set aside
out of each settlement to buy tires, pay for an upcoming overhaul, or invest in
new equipment. Obviously, everyone (company drivers and owner-operators
alike) needs to keep expense records. But more complex, and more expensive,
accounting software is likely required only by owner-operators or those oper-
ating small fleets.
Among those programs currently available, you might want to take a look at
the following:
 Truckers Helper: Offers several software programs ranging from one tai-
lored to the needs of a company driver to one suitable for use in a fleet
operation. The Drivers Version and Owner Operator Version also include
a log maintenance program that is easy to use and effective. They offer a
31-day free demo program, and I suggest that if this program strikes
your fancy, you accept the demo offer.
283
Chapter 14: Managing the Over-the-Road Office

You can either download the program, or if you prefer, opt for a two-CD
package that includes the program and tutorials. This program can
be relatively complex, so I strongly suggest taking advantage of the
tutorials. You can get more information from their Web site at www.
truckershelper.com.
 HammerLane: The applications they offer are probably more than any
company driver could make use of, but those designed with the owner-
operator, leased fleet, and full fleet in mind are worth a look. Their pro-
grams are designed to be single-entry, meaning that when you enter data
in one area, it’s automatically copied to all the other related records or
reports. You can find them at www.hammerlane.com.
 Easy Trucking Software: Okay, trucking’s not easy and no software pro-
gram will alter that fact, but the two applications developed by Omni
Communications are comprehensive, easy to use, and should help you
get a handle on your expenses. The Profit Per Mile program module

Managing the Home Front
Before advances in computing and technology enabled me to stay well-
connected while I was on the road, I found it difficult, if not impossible, to
get my mail in a timely fashion and often found myself sending off payments
for utilities, credit cards, and other obligations without always knowing for
sure how much was due. Now, that’s not such a bad thing because even when
I didn’t quite send enough, I rarely got charged a late fee. Other bad things,
however, can and do happen. For example, I once dropped an envelope con-
taining a utility payment into a mailbox near Kingman, Arizona, and went
merrily along my way thinking all was well. It wasn’t.
I’d forgotten to put a stamp on that bill and realized the problem only after I
got home and had to light a candle to see. Fortunately, nothing was frozen
solid and the local Light & Power Company was kind enough to not charge a
reconnect fee.
Since I began taking care of household finances online, I no longer worry
about making payments on time, and in most cases, I usually know exactly
how much I owe. Among the ways personal finances can be tailored to an
over-the-road lifestyle include:
 Direct deposit: Without a doubt, this is the foundation of over-the-road
finance. If you’ve ever come home to a pile of paychecks or had to rely
on others to make deposits for you, then you know the value of getting
the check deposited automatically.
284
Part V: Taking Care of Business 

 Online banking: It’s like having your local bank open for business 24-
hours a day, seven days a week. Most banks offer full access to account
information, and some include features such as transfers between
accounts and bill payment services.
 Online payments: Whether you use an online bill-paying service offered
by your bank or make use of the online payment options offered by your
credit card company, home and auto loan providers, or utility companies,
making payments online is one sure way to know your payments are
always on time. Even though some services charge a monthly fee, it’s
probably less than it costs to buy stamps and checks.
 Online tax preparation: For a couple of years now, I’ve prepared and
filed my taxes online. By keeping books on my laptop — meaning that
I’ve got all I need close at hand — it takes me no more than a few hours
to accomplish what previously took as much as a week at home. Not
only that, but I can also do it on the road at my convenience.
You can find several services that can help you file your taxes online.
Among your options are TurboTax (www.turbotax.com), H&R Block’s
TaxCut (http://taxcut.com), E-File Online (www.e-fileonline.com),
TaxAct (www.taxact.com), and eSmart Tax (www.esmarttax.com).
 Budgeting software: I believe in budgeting; it helps me get a handle on my
money and hang on to it. Several programs, such as Intuit’s Quicken or
Microsoft Money, can help you keep and track your budget on the road.
The budgeting program that works for me is called Mvelopes. When I was
growing up, lots of folks divided cash into envelopes: one for food, one for
utilities, one for clothing, and so on. This system worked especially well
for those whose pay varied from week to week, and because Mvelopes
is based on this system, I think that’s why it works so well for me. The
Mvelopes budgeting system divides funds into the digital envelopes and
is connected via the Internet to your banking and credit card institutions.
Find out more at www.mvelopes.com. (And you can find the version I use
by visiting Crown Financial Ministries at www.crown.org.)
 Online investment management: Whether you’ve got an IRA, a 401k, or
individual stocks and bonds, almost every brokerage house offers full
online account access. You can move money between funds, make
trades, or take advantage of a host of other management features.
If you’re concerned about conducting business that’s related to finances
online — especially while accessing the Internet at a public hotspot — you
might want to use a VPN, which I cover in Chapter 10, or conduct transactions
remotely through your home computer, which I explain in Chapter 12.
Printing Records
It’s a fact of life. Even though we can digitize more information than has ever
before been possible, it’s still necessary to transfer some of that digital data
285
Chapter 14: Managing the Over-the-Road Office

to a piece of paper you can hold in your hand. That means, somewhere along
the line, you need access to a printer. Because you can’t rely on truck stops,
motels, or RV parks to have a compatible printer available for your use,
you’re going to need to make other arrangements.
When you’re attempting to make a decision regarding a method of meeting
your printing needs, you find you’ve got roughly three options:
 Mobile printing: Fortunately, a few manufacturers have begun to build
a variety of printers suitable for use in a mobile environment. Generally
weighing in at less than 5 pounds and taking up less than one square
foot of space, these printers are entirely suitable for over-the-road use.
 Deferred printing: You can choose to print documents at a later date by
storing them in a file or folder on your hard drive or on a removable
storage device, like a USB flash drive.
 Remote printing: By accessing your home computer remotely, it’s
entirely possible to print things at home while you’re on the road. You
can also perform tasks likely to produce documents in need of printing
on the host PC and print from that computer.
You can find details about choosing a travel printer or deferring printing in
the following sections. For details about remote printing, flip to Chapter 12.
Choosing a travel printer
If you must print while you’re on the road — for example, if you need to
print invoices or print logbook pages that you maintain on your computer —
traveling with a printer might be your best or only choice. If that’s the case,
you need a printer that’s small, sturdy, and reliable. When you begin shopping,
you might want to consider looking for a printer that includes the following
features:
 Wireless connectivity: Printing without wires is as handy as accessing
the Internet wire-free. Some mobile printers offer optional 802.11b or
802.11g capability, while others use Bluetooth wireless technology. (For
a refresher on wireless standards, see Chapter 2.)
 Full-size paper: Be aware that micro-printers often use A7 paper, which
measures about 4 x 3 inches. That won’t cut it for printing log pages. Make
sure the printer you choose is capable of printing on 81⁄2-x-11-inch paper.
 Rechargeable battery: While not absolutely necessary, it’s nice to know
you can print on battery power if you absolutely have to.
 A/C adapter: Chances are good you’ve got an inverter (to change DC
power into AC power), but again, just in case you want to power the
printer or recharge the battery using the cigarette lighter/power port,
one of these cords can come in handy.
286
Part V: Taking Care of Business 

To help you start your search, here are a couple of printers currently avail-
able that include these features:
 HP Deskjet 460wbt: Featuring wireless Bluetooth connectivity, you can
print to the 460wbt at a distance of up to 30 feet from your Bluetooth-
capable computer. This printer also includes fold-up feeder and out-feed
doors capable of handling 50 sheets at a time. You can get more informa-
tion from the HP Web site at www.hp.com.
 Canon Pixma iP90: Designed primarily as a mobile photo printer (you can
print photos directly from your camera, PDA, or cellphone), this mobile
printer does a great job on documents as well. Bluetooth capabilities, as
well as a rechargeable battery, are optional. If you visit
www.usa.canon.com you can get more information.
If you often need to fax documents, as well as print them, consider using a
scanner. By creating a scan, you can email the document as an attachement
instead of spending money on fax fees and waiting in the line. (If you work
with lots of documents that require signatures, make sure the scan is accept-
able first.) A few mobile scanning devices, like the Strobe XP 300 or the One
Touch 7300 (both manufactured by Visioneer) won’t take up much room and
will likely meet your needs. You can find out more about the Visioneer line of
scanners by visiting www.visioneer.com.
Saving documents for future printing
Okay, so printing out your log pages isn’t a big deal to you, and besides that,
you don’t really want to put a printer in your truck or RV. I can relate to
that. But you still find that, on occasion, you want or need to print a receipt,
record, or some other document. As long as you don’t need to print it this
very second, no matter whether it’s a text document or Web page, you can
choose to print it at a later date — when you get home or back to the office,
most likely.
There are a couple of ways to do this but only one that I really recommend.
For example, if you want to print a Web page, you can, even without a printer
currently connected to your computer, just click the Print button on your
browser and the page is put into the print queue. In theory, when you get
access to a printer, you can bring up the queue and print everything it con-
tains. The reality (at least in my experience) is that you sometimes just get an
error message, and at that point, you’re out of luck.
Under certain circumstances and with the proper supporting software, you
can Print to File, but I’m not a fan of this method either. So, now that I’ve told
you only what I’m against, you probably think I’m running for political office.
Well, just to prove I have no political aspirations, I’ll tell you that my preferred
method of deferring a print job is to save the document or Web page to a file
or folder.
287
Chapter 14: Managing the Over-the-Road Office

I usually save Web pages indicating the receipt of my money in exchange for
an item that I just can’t live another minute without. I save these pages, and
other documents, in a folder I’ve named Deferred Printing. To accomplish
this easy task, all you need do is follow these simple steps:
1. With the desired Web page open in the browser window of your
choice, click File➪Save as (in Internet Explorer) or File➪Save Page As
(in Firefox).
The Save Webpage (IE) or the Save As (Firefox) window opens.
2. Select the proper folder from the Save In drop-down list.
3. Enter appropriate information in the File Name text field.
4. Click Save.
When it comes time to print the file, again, there are a couple of ways to accom-
plish the task. I prefer to open the saved Web page by right-clicking the file,
choosing Open With, and then choosing my Web browser from the list of pro-
grams that appears. With the file open, I then either choose File➪Print or click
the Print icon on the browser. By doing this, the page displays and prints as it
would if you printed directly from the browser when the page first displayed.
I like to store files — whether they’re documents or Web pages — that I’m
going to print at a later time on removable storage rather than on my laptop.
I talk about using separate storage for sensitive information in Chapter 10.

In this part . . .
I
focus on the central theme of my life: entertainment.
Do I examine every possible form of electronic fun and
games? Nope. It might take a book or two to do that; but I
do cover a few of the things that make me and the sock
puppets smile when it’s time to put up our feet and kick
back for a bit. In Chapter 15 you discover how Satellite
Radio can enhance both your working and leisure time,
and I help you decide which of the services and what
equipment you might want to include in your bag of toys.
And, in Chapter 16, you find out about ways you can use
your computer and an Internet connection to bring music,
movies, and books into your over-the-road abode. Down-
loading music and movies has gotten a lot of bad press in
the past, but you can find out how to do so safely. I point
out some fun alternatives, too.

F
or years, I, like you, have traveled the highways and byways of this great
land listening to the radio. In fact, I’ve often told people, when asked what
I did for a living, that I got paid to do so. I know a lot of folks prefer to listen to
their own digitally or otherwise recorded music collection but, along with my
Moldy Oldies, I’ve always liked to hear human voices read the news, perform
silly skits in local commercials, and, of course, expel huge amounts of hot air
on talk-radio stations. Radio helps me feel connected to the community of
humanity.
Even so, I often lamented the lack of continuity, never knowing from one day
to another whether I’d be able to hear a particular show or sporting event,
and I can’t possibly count the number of times a radio station I really enjoyed
faded into the ether, forcing me to click seek or scan buttons in a frustrating
attempt to find an acceptable replacement. When I began to see billboards
advertising satellite radio, especially in areas where radio signals were as
rare as rain, I knew this was something I had to explore.
In this chapter, I help you decide, first, whether you can justify the expense of
satellite radio and, once you do, which satellite radio service offers the pro-
gramming and features most attractive to you. Also, to help you decide which
type and style radio might best meet your needs, I point out a few attributes
of the many equipment choices you face. When you’ve made your choice, I
help you configure your system. Lastly, I give you a bit of information regard-
ing system and subscription activation.

Surveying the Satellite Radio Scene
The first thing you may notice when you begin to investigate satellite radio
is that the list of service providers for those who live on the road is pretty
short — even if you include Canada. There are, currently and exactly, two:
XM and Sirius Satellite Radio.
Even though the list is short, don’t think for a minute that making a choice
between the two will be easy. Both offer plenty of attractive programming
choices, both are competitively priced, and both are supported by multiple
equipment manufacturers.
Making any comparison between Sirius and XM Satellite Radio is kind of like
trying to compare Galas and Granny Smiths. They’re both apples, but the one
you’re going to like best is a matter of taste and circumstance. So in the sec-
tions that follow, I first cover what both options have to offer and then dis-
cuss the ways in which their content is different. By the time you’re done, I
hope you have a good idea whether satellite radio is a good choice for you,
and if so, which provider you’d like to choose.
What does satellite radio have to offer?
When I was a kid, I lived with my family in a small Oregon town that had
exactly one television station. Because we were surrounded by signal-block-
ing mountains, cable was our only hope of getting a variety of choices. When
cable finally came to town, I was stunned and surprised to hear people whine
and complain about the cost. Apparently they felt that their constitutionally
protected right to watch free TV was being infringed upon. Unfortunately for
me, my dad led the complainers’ choir.
Eventually though, when he could no longer stand the sound of my whining
and complaining, my dad agreed to install cable and, after discovering a few
features and entertainment options we never knew existed, he even bought a
fancy TV with one of those newfangled, high-frequency remote controls.
Since that time, I’ve rarely been without a cable TV subscription and barely
blink when I write the check.
I guess I look at paying for radio pretty much the same way. When I began
comparing satellite radio with free radio, I looked beyond the cost, trying to
remember that one often gets what one pays for. Among the features and
entertainment options that you won’t find on free radio are the following:
 Quality: Digital satellite signals mean you get near-CD-quality sound
without fade or static from sea to shining sea.
292
Part VI: Entertaining Electronics 

 Variety: I’ve heard the same songs so often, especially when listening to
oldies stations, that I’ve almost forgotten anything else was ever recorded.
With both XM and Sirius offering somewhere around 70 music channels
along with several sports, news, talk, and specialty channels, you need
never again be bored.
 Unique content: Where else can you hear All Elvis, All the Time? Or clas-
sic rock and country songs you haven’t heard since high school? Not to
mention personalities heard exclusively on satellite, channels devoted
to truckers, and old-time radio dramas.
 Ad-free: For now, the only advertisements on the music channels are for
other channels. Some find these service announcements annoying, but if
a special event’s coming up on a channel you might not otherwise listen
to, how else are you supposed to know about it? Or what if a brand new
channel’s offered? Again; no way to know unless your channels
announce it!
 Graphic display: If you’ve ever been frustrated by terrestrial DJs playing
song after song without so much as a mention of titles or artists, you’ll
love graphic displays that give you not only title and artist info but also
other interesting stuff like upcoming concert dates, sports scores, or
stock tickers.
 Continuity: I happen to be an Indianapolis Colts fan. Without the NFL on
Sirius, there’d be no chance that I could be sure of hearing every game.
Likewise, if you’re a big-time baseball fan, I know of no way to follow the
home team, no matter where either you or the players are at, other than
by subscribing to XM Radio.
So, cut to the chase — how much does it cost? Well, a subscription from
Sirius or XM, in either one- or two-year increments, will cost you exactly the
same. The price of a one-year subscription is $142.45, or $11.87 per month,
and a two-year stint will run you $271.95, which works out to $11.33 per
month. To put it in different terms: If you listened only while on the road,
and you were on the road 250 days per year, your two-year subscription
would cost you less than $0.55 per day. I spend more than that on soda pop
and coffee.
Comparing content
Sirius and XM, in an effort to bring the best to their listeners, are constantly
upgrading, altering, and adding to their content. That’s a good thing, but it
makes a side-by-side comparison nearly impossible. Not only that, but also
simply comparing the available number of channels does little to differentiate
between the two services. As with cable TV, the total number of choices is
less important than the number of choices that are of interest to you!
293
Chapter 15: Extra-Terrestrial Radio

For example, my vehicle always has been, and will forever remain, a Stern-free
zone. Additionally, you couldn’t find my interest in Eminem’s Shade 45 chan-
nel with a scanning electron microscope. But that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t
consider Sirius as my satellite radio choice. Quite the contrary; when I
survey the menu of choices offered by Sirius, including Radio Margaritaville,
The Roadhouse, Revolution, unique talk channels, and the NFL, I find plenty
of reasons to pony up the pesos for a subscription.
Likewise, I’m just about as excited by XM offerings Raw, Fungus, and The Opie
& Anthony Show as I am about getting a Novocain-free root canal. Does that
mean I’d scratch XM Radio from consideration? No way! XM offers far more
than enough to get my business, including Major League Baseball and IndyCar
Racing as well as The Message, Hank’s Place, and The Loft. With so many chan-
nels and such varied content to choose from, I think almost anyone can find
enough reason to support an XM subscription decision.
I guess I make it sound like I subscribe to both Sirius and XM, don’t I? Well,
don’t think I haven’t considered it, and should you choose to avoid choosing
by subscribing to both, I wouldn’t think you’d gone overboard. But, alas, my
subscription choice will remain anonymous. I will tell you this: For me, the
choice came down to a single channel offered by one and not the other. I’ll
leave it up to you to figure out whether I couldn’t live without the Colts or
the Twins.
Both XM and Sirius offer three-day trial periods during which you can listen
online. The content streamed over the Internet includes all the music chan-
nels, but you won’t hear most of the talk or news channels. Nonetheless, this
can be a great way to help you decide to which service you’d prefer to sub-
scribe. XM also offers, for $7.99 per month, an Internet-only subscription, and
this online service offers a couple channels heard exclusively online. By the
way, XM Radio Online recommends the use of a broadband connection (wired
or Wi-Fi) and, further, if you normally connect to the Internet via satellite,
because of latency, you might want to adopt a try-before-you-buy stance.
Setting up satellite radio
As you continue with your investigation, and if you find that satellite radio is
something you want, there are four steps to follow in getting set up for service:
1. Choose a provider.
Before you go shopping for radio gear, you must decide which satellite
radio service best meets your needs, wants and desires. You don’t need
to subscribe quite yet, but because some of the equipment is designed
specifically for use with one service or the other, you at least need to
know which service you prefer.
294
Part VI: Entertaining Electronics 

2. Gather the gear.
With the issue of satellite service settled, you’re now faced with the
task of determining the type of system you want. There are several
manufacturers building systems and accessories ranging from high-tech
built-in units with functions galore to portable units that can be acces-
sorized beyond belief.
3. Install your system.
Whether you choose to have the system installed professionally or you
do it yourself, everything needs to be up and running prior to activating
the service.
4. Activate your service and equipment.
You can sign up for a subscription and activate your satellite radio
equipment all at the same time. After you’ve paid for your subscription,
the service provider you chose will send a signal from space that acti-
vates the tuner.
Evaluating Equipment
The importance of choosing the radio receiver that best meets your needs
can’t be emphasized enough. As a matter of fact, for some, the available choice
of gear might be the deciding difference when choosing between Sirius and XM
Satellite Radio. When you begin to shop around for radios, you find that the
available equipment falls into four categories:
 Head unit: These in-dash units closely resemble most other terrestrial
radios, and the high-end units usually include features like CD and MP3
playback. Satellite-ready head units require the use of a separate Sirius
or XM radio tuner to enable access to the satellite radio signal. Some,
however, do come equipped with a built-in XM or Sirius tuner.
 Plug & Play: These easily transportable satellite radios, when used in
conjunction with separate connection kits, can be enjoyed in both
rolling and stationary homes. Most Plug & Play units broadcast an FM
signal to your vehicle’s radio but some can be connected by cable.
 Portable: These units are similar to Plug & Play units, but depending on
the unit and the service, they can also receive satellite radio signals
without the necessity of a separate home or car kit, which makes them
perfect for toting around town or a trip to the ballpark.
 Home: Pretty self-explanatory; you probably wouldn’t take your home
stereo with you on the road, and you probably wouldn’t want to take a
satellite radio system designed for the home with you, either.
295
Chapter 15: Extra-Terrestrial Radio

Examining system configurations
Whether you decide to install a system built around an in-dash head unit or
one that incorporates a Plug & Play or portable unit, you find somewhat dif-
ferent configurations. All systems, however, contain the following elements:
 Antenna: If you plan on using your satellite radio subscription in a vehi-
cle, an external antenna is a requirement. Even though a portable radio
has a built-in antenna, this antenna is nearly useless inside a vehicle or
building. Antennas, because of the slightly different signals, are service-
specific, meaning that an XM antenna picks up only XM signals, and a
Sirius antenna can be used only with Sirius service.
 Tuner: Tuners are compatible with only one service provider. Satellite-
ready radios, for example, can be used with either XM or Sirius services
but require an external, service-specific, tuner. Plug & Play units are,
essentially, service-specific tuners with control and display functions.
 Input feed: Satellite-ready head unit radios receive their input audio
from the tuner through a cable that plugs into the back of the radio. Plug
& Play units may use any one of several methods of feeding audio to a
vehicle’s FM radio, including direct cable or FM radio transmission. (I
tell you more about audio input later in this chapter, in the section
“Sending sound to the stereo.”)
Satellite radio subscriptions, both XM and Sirius, are tethered to the tuner. If
you choose to install a built-in head unit and tuner in your vehicle and later
decide you’d like to have satellite radio in your home as well, you will, under
most circumstances, need to get another subscription to go with your new
home unit. Plug & Play and portable units can help eliminate the need for
multiple subscriptions to the same service.
Another component necessary for use in systems built around Plug & Play or
portable units is known as a car kit. Now, I know, you’re interested in getting
a satellite radio system installed in your truck or RV, not your car, but they
don’t call ’em truck kits or RV kits; they call ’em car kits. Anyway, most car
kits come with everything you need, for use in whatever vehicle you choose,
including the following:
 Mounting bracket: At the very least, an adhesive-backed bracket suitable
for sticking on a flat surface should be included in the kit, but in many
cases, an assortment of brackets may be included. (I talk more about
mounting brackets in the section “Choosing a Plug & Play cradle mount,”
later in the chapter.)
 Cradle: The cradle, sometimes referred to as a docking station, provides
connection points for the various cables as well as a secure place to
park your Plug & Play or portable unit.
 DC adapter: The adapter provided is usually the typical power port or
cigarette lighter type.
296
Part VI: Entertaining Electronics 

 Input device: Most car kits include an assortment of input devices rang-
ing from FM modulators to auxiliary input cables. (I tell you a bit more
about this subject later in the chapter, in the section “Sending sound to
the stereo.”)
 Antenna and cable: Most kits include about 20 feet of antenna cable as
well as a magnetic antenna. I tell you more about installing antennas later
in this chapter, under the clever section title “Installing the antenna.” 
Finding the right radio
One of the primary indicators that satellite radio is both the wave of the future
and here to stay has to be the proliferation of radio receivers available for both
services. Several manufacturers, betting that both Sirius and XM will survive
and thrive, even build multiple units for each brand. When you begin shopping
for radio equipment, you find the following among your choices:
 Sirius Plug & Play models: Several manufacturers offer Plug & Play
units designed for use with Sirius service. Some include car kits, and
some don’t, so make sure you get all you need to install the unit in your
vehicle. Among those offered, you find the following:
• Sirius Sportster Replay: Possibly the most popular of all Sirius
radios, the Sportster Replay includes the Game Alert feature, which
lets you know when your favorite teams are playing, and the Game
Zone feature, which lists channels and scores. See Figure 15-1.
• Clarion Calypso: The Calypso features S-Seek, which saves the info
for up to 20 songs and alerts you when a saved song is playing any-
where on Sirius. You can also search by category, channel, artist,
or song title by using the included remote control.
• JVC KT-SR3000: This innovative unit is also sold packaged with a
car kit under the designation KT-PK3000 and looks a little like a PDA.
Including, among other features, a 6-line graphic display, S-Seek,
Game Alert, Program Alert, and a 44-minute replay memory, this
little unit packs a big punch.
 XM Plug & Play models: As with Sirius, a number of manufacturers have
jumped on the XM bandwagon and provide a variety of units designed
for use with XM Satellite Radio service. Among them are the following:
• Delphi Roady XT: Like many Plug & Play units, a built-in transmit-
ter broadcasts the XM signal over any unused FM frequency on
your vehicle’s FM radio. TuneSelect alerts you when any one of 20
saved songs is played on any XM channel, and a stock ticker
scrolls up to 20 stock symbols across the display.
• Audiovox Xpress: If your vehicle’s stereo has an auxiliary input,
you can use the line output to make a direct audio connection, or if
not, the built-in transmitter will broadcast sound through your FM
297
Chapter 15: Extra-Terrestrial Radio

radio. TuneSelect and scrolling sports scores or stock ticker sym-
bols are also included in this compact unit.
• Delphi SKYFi2: The Replay/Pause feature continuously records 30
minutes of the XM channel you’re listening to, and the TuneSelect
preview mode allows you to see what’s playing on other channels.
The built-in FM transmitter broadcasts the XM signal on any of sev-
eral unused FM frequencies. You can see this model in Figure 15-2.
 Head units: When combined with a Sirius or XM tuner, these built-in vehi-
cle stereo systems provide clear satellite radio entertainment as well as a
multitude of other audio entertainment options. As with the Plug & Play
radios, several models, including the following, are offered for sale:
• Alpine CDA 9857: Besides being satellite radio ready (requiring a
Sirius or XM tuner) you can listen to terrestrial AM and FM radio
or, with the optional tuner, HD Radio. You can also enjoy listening
to commercial and homemade CDs, or by connecting the included
cable, you can play and control your iPod.

Part VI: Entertaining Electronics 

• Sony MEX-1GP: This unit incorporates almost too many audio
choices. Along with AM, FM, HD (with optional tuner), and Satellite
radio (with required tuner), you can listen to your choice of CDs or
store, for replay, up to 1GB of WMA, MP3, or ATRAC3plus files in
the included flash memory.
• Pioneer DEH-P6800MP: With the optional iPod adapter, you can
plug in your iPod and listen to your whole music library, should
you ever tire of listening to satellite radio. As with most of the
satellite-radio ready receivers, you need to purchase a separate
tuner and service subscription.
Another way to get satellite radio in your vehicle is to have it factory
installed in your next new truck or RV. Both Sirius and XM have signed
deals with various truck and RV manufacturers to offer service-specific
equipment as an option at purchase, but some manufacturers, like
Delphi, also offer satellite-ready radios, designed specifically for use in
heavy-duty trucks, allowing the purchaser to install the service-specific
tuner of his or her choice.
 Portables: Some of the most versatile products to come down the pike
are portable satellite radios, but at least up to now, the only truly
portable units are designed to be used with XM. Among your choices
are the following: 
Because of the ability to store and replay music, the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA) has filed a lawsuit against XM Radio citing
that, through the use of time-shifting or on-demand devices like the Inno,
Helix and NeXus, XM has overstepped the bounds of its licensing agree-
ments. As I write this book, chances are good that XM and the RIAA will
hammer out an acceptable agreement making everybody happy but,
until that time, you might want to put the Inno, or similar devices, on
your “wish list” instead of your “buy now” list.
• Pioneer Inno: The Inno is roughly the size of a cellphone and has
a built-in antenna that receives the XM signal almost anywhere.
You’ll need an optional kit for use in your vehicle, but the Inno
comes with all the necessary gear to play it over your home stereo.
The Inno can record up to 50 hours of programming, either one
song at a time or in blocks, and up to half the memory (although
not quite 25 hours) can be used to store MP3 or WMA files. As the
2006 “CNET Best of CES Peoples Voice” award winner, the Pioneer
Inno is a truly innovative product.
• Sirius S50 Portable: The S50 isn’t really a portable radio because 
it can receive the Sirius satellite signal only when it’s docked in a
home or vehicle cradle, but it can store up to 50 hours of Sirius
programming and MP3 or WMA music files. By the way, Sirius has
an agreement with the RIAA to make a per-unit royalty payment 
on each S50 sold so; no lawsuit.

• Samsung Helix: Boasting a feature set almost identical to the
Pioneer Inno, the Helix also includes a built-in rechargeable battery
and a USB cable for uploading MP3s from your computer.
With so many equipment choices you may be wondering where you’re going
to find it all. Well, there are a number of retailers offering satellite radio
equipment including Best Buy, Fry’s Electronics, and Circuit City, but at least
in my opinion, you can’t go wrong by starting your search at Crutchfield.
They offer a huge selection of products as well as installation, advice, and
online tutorials covering a wide range of satellite radio-related issues. You
can find them at www.crutchfield.com. Choose Car Satellite Radio from
the Car Audio & Video drop-down menu and start your tour!
Setting Up a Satellite Radio System
Because every satellite radio system installation is different, any attempt to
give you step by step installation directions will fall short of the mark. There
are, however, a few issues that most, if not all, system installations have in
common. Included among those considerations are the following:
 Placement: Depending on the type of system you’re installing, you need
to determine where you’re going to place the antenna, tuner, cabling, or
mounting device. If you’re installing an in-dash radio, then, obviously, it

XM Passport
One of the most interesting devices debuting at
the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show (CES),
because of its potential impact on the satellite
radio industry as a whole, is the XM Passport.
The low-cost Passport, which looks a little bit like
an SD card, as shown in the following figure, can
take the place of the bulky radio tuners needed to
receive the XM Satellite Radio signal. The tiny
tuner, to which the satellite radio subscription is
tied, provides programming when inserted into a
built-in port or when used in a docking device
connected to the radio receiver. As more and
more manufacturers make XM radio-ready
devices available, including a Passport slot, the
need for multiple satellite radio subscriptions will
be, if not eliminated, greatly diminished.
The XM Passport, manufactured by Audiovox,
is expected to be bundled with, among others,
the Samsung Helix and Nexus, for use in con-
junction with a docking station. You can expect
to see several Passport compatible head units
follow suit.

gets installed in the dash; but if you’re installing a Plug & Play unit, you
have a number of placement options.
 Mounting: Most vehicle kits include a few different types of mounts,
ranging from suction mounts for use on a windshield to vent mounts for
use on the dash. It’s also possible to purchase mounting brackets
designed specifically for use in your truck or RV.
 Connections: Ranging from connecting the antenna to the tuner to con-
necting a Plug & Play radio to the vehicle’s stereo, you must make a
number of wired or even wireless connections.
 Activation: With everything installed and powered up, you can then acti-
vate your service and equipment.
Because everything needs to be installed before you can activate the service,
and because after a device is installed it might be difficult to relocate if there
are problems, I recommend that you make sure everything’s going to work
before you start drilling too many holes. You can do this by following these
steps:
1. Place the antenna approximately in the area that you expect to set it
up more permanently, and then make a temporary connection to the
radio tuner.
2. Provide temporary power to the radio tuner.
If you’re installing a Plug & Play radio, you can use the power port plug.
Otherwise, just run a couple of jumper wires: one for power and one to
ground the device.
3. If you have an XM radio, tune it to channel one, which is the XM
Preview channel, and if you have a Sirius radio, check the signal
strength meter on the screen.
4. Make adjustments, if needed, to the antenna location to fine-tune the
signal, and when all is well, continue with the installation.
Location, location, location
Yep, location is a key consideration in restaurants, real estate, and radio equip-
ment, but for decidedly different reasons. Where you locate your radio, tuner,
or antenna will be determined, to some extent, by circumstance, but in areas in
which you can exert some control, you may want to keep the following in mind:
 Cables: If you’re installing a head unit, tuner, and antenna, make sure
you’ve got enough cable to reach easily between the antenna and tuner
as well as the tuner and radio. If you’re installing a vehicle kit for a Plug
& Play or portable unit, you need sufficient cable to span the distance
between the cradle and antenna.
301
Chapter 15: Extra-Terrestrial Radio

 Access: If you’re installing a vehicle kit for a Plug & Play or portable
radio, you want to be sure you can reach the controls and easily
read the display. It also needs to be in close proximity to the vehicle
stereo system if you’re using a cassette adapter or auxiliary input
cable, and be sure it’s within reach of the DC outlet (cigarette lighter)
for power.
 Interference: You don’t want the location of your radio, tuner, vehicle
kit, or cables to interfere with the safe operation of your vehicle. Be
sure that all items are safely secured, afford unobstructed use of all
your vehicle controls, and don’t block your vision in any way.
Installing the antenna
The most difficult part of installing an antenna is running the cable in such a
way as to avoid making it easy for water to find its way inside. After that, the
most difficulty is found when trying to run the cable in an unobtrusive way.
You’re on your own with those two issues, but hey, it’s not like you’ve never
done it before, right? There are, however, a couple other things to keep in
mind when you begin looking for a place to install your antenna:
 Obstructions: I know people who’ve just stuck their antenna up on the
dash and seem happy with the reception. Don’t do that. The roof of
any vehicle makes a great satellite-signal-blocking obstruction. For
best results, the antenna should be placed outside the vehicle in an
obstruction-free area.
 Attachment: Most of the antennas included with radios and tuners have
a magnetic base, although a few use an adhesive-backed base. I like the
magnetic-base antennas, but depending on your situation, you might
need to find an antenna, like a bolt-on marine mount, that allows for an
alternative method of attachment.
 Mounting: If you have a good metal roof on which to attach your mag-
netic-base antenna, you have no issues, but if you’d like to mount your
antenna on a mirror, you might be scratching your head wondering how
to do that. Well, scratch no more! A couple manufacturers make an inno-
vative little metal bracket that attaches to your mirror, onto which you
can set your magnetic or, if you insist, adhesive-backed satellite antenna.
The two mounting brackets in question are
• Pro.Fit: This company makes a nice black, powder-coated, satellite
antenna mount that attaches to the top bar of the mirror. For most
folks, that should place the antenna in a relatively obstruction-free
area. You can find Pro.Fit on the Web at www.pro-fit-intl.com.
302
Part VI: Entertaining Electronics 

• Terk SRB-MM: Very similar to the Pro.Fit model, the Terk antenna
mount also attaches to the top bracket of the mirror and has a
small opening near the front through which the antenna coax cable
fits. The Terk SRB-MM can be purchased from several online retail-
ers, including, who else, Crutchfield.
Having a satellite radio antenna sitting somewhere on your vehicle is like
having a flashing neon sign telling thieves and criminals that you’ve got some
expensive satellite radio gear sitting in your vehicle. Make sure you take proper
precautions.
Choosing a Plug & Play cradle mount
Most car kits include at least one mounting bracket, and some include sev-
eral. The most common types are
 Universal brackets: These are great for ease of use, but because anything
meant to work everywhere results in compromise, you might not get the
cleanest-looking installation with a universal mount. Among the group of
universal mounts, you find the following methods of attachment:
• Adhesive: Most car kits include an adhesive backed mounting
bracket. These are great if you have a flat surface onto which
you can stick the bracket, but if you ever need to remove the
bracket, get ready for a fight. Additionally, if you do remove
the bracket, a very sticky residue that’s difficult to remove will
be left behind.
• Suction cup: These mounts, sometimes included with the kits and
also available from other sources, are used to attach the mounting
bracket to a windshield. If you choose this type of mounting
bracket, be certain that your vision isn’t obstructed in any way.
• Dash vent: I’ve never been a big fan of dash-vent mounts because
I’m not sure it’s a great idea to blast heat on any electronic item
that cost me more than twenty bucks. These brackets clip on the
vent slats and are surprisingly secure, but vents aren’t always
located in places you’d like to have your radio.
 Vehicle-specific brackets: A couple companies offer brackets that are
designed for use in specific vehicles. If you can find one for your truck
or RV, these are usually preferable to almost any other option. They’re
easy to install, and because they’re designed for your vehicle, they usu-
ally place the radio in the best possible location. A few places you can
find these mounts include
• Crutchfield: Offering a number of brackets designed for use in a
wide variety of vehicles, you can find Crutchfield on the Web at
www.crutchfield.com.

• Arkon Resources: Although they don’t offer a line of vehicle-specific
mounting brackets, they provide a viable alternative to those brack-
ets bundled with typical car kits. You can find them on the Web at:
www.arkon.com.
• Satellite Radio Superstore: There’s one Satellite Radio Superstore
targeted to XM users and another for Sirius subscribers. They offer
a wide variety of mounting brackets as well as other satellite radio
services and accessories. You can find them at the following
addresses:

• Pro.Fit Int’l: Pro.Fit manufactures quite a number of vehicle-specific
mounting brackets for a variety of products, including satellite
radio cradles and cellphones. The Web site is located at www.
pro-fit-intl.com.
Sending sound to the stereo
Plug & Play satellite radios aren’t really radios at all. In fact, they’re primarily
satellite radio tuners. Therefore, if you’re using one of these units, you must
have a way to send the sound to your vehicle’s FM radio. Of course, that also
means you need to have a regular radio installed in your vehicle, but you
have one of those, don’t you? I thought so. Anyway, you can use any of sev-
eral methods to get your satellite radio audio to play on your terrestrial FM
radio. Included among them are
 Cassette adapter: If your vehicle’s radio is also a cassette tape player,
you can use a cassette tape adapter to connect your satellite unit to
the stereo. The cassette adapter looks like a standard cassette tape
with a wire attached to it. Just stick the cassette into the slot, connect
the wire to the cradle, and you’re in business. I’ve heard and read con-
flicting reports concerning the audio quality obtained by using this
connection method. Some love it, and some hate it; I’ll let you decide
for yourself.
 FM modulator: An FM modulator transmits the satellite audio feed to your
radio by using FM radio frequencies. Because the FM frequency used by
the modulator can’t be used by any local stations, you may, during the
course of the day, need to find open frequencies as you travel. Two types
of modulators are currently in use, and they are as follows:
• Wireless: Most Plug & Play units and some portable units include a
wireless FM transmitter that broadcasts an FM signal that can be
picked up by your FM radio antenna. In my opinion, this is the
least desirable method of sending the signal to your radio, but I
also recognize that it’s the easiest.

• Wired: A wired modulator connects to the audio output port on
your cradle and plugs into the antenna input port on your FM
radio. So what do you do with the terrestrial radio antenna you’ve
disconnected from your radio? Well, your FM modulator comes
equipped with a female antenna plug into which you insert the
standard antenna.
 Direct input: Making a direct connection, in a fashion similar to that
used by satellite-ready in-dash radios, is the best option, but it’s also an
option that may not be available to you. If, however, your current stereo
does include an auxiliary input port, you can run a cable with a mini-jack
plug on one end and an RCA plug on the other from the cradle output to
the stereo’s input, or if need be, you can purchase an auxiliary input
adapter from one of the following places:
• Crutchfield: Crutchfield just keeps showing up, doesn’t it? You can
find this company’s Web site, which hasn’t changed since you began
reading this chapter, by using this URL: www.crutchfield.com.
• Precision Interface Electronics: Better known as PIE, this company
makes a wide range of interface products for the audio installation
industry. You can visit PIE on the Web at www.pie.net.
Activating the service
Getting your radio tuner activated isn’t rocket science, but rocket science is,
or at least was, involved. That’s because activation occurs when your satel-
lite radio service provider sends an activation hit to your particular unit from
a satellite that’s in geo-stationary orbit. To get your tuner activated, you need
the following items:
 ID number: Sirius requires you to provide the System Identification
Number (SID) or Electronic Serial Number (ESN), which can be found on
the tuner under the bar code. XM radios use an 8-digit ID number that
displays when you tune your radio to channel 0.
If you have an XM radio, be aware that the ID numbers won’t include the
letters I, O, S, or F so as not to be confused with the numbers 1, 0, 5, or 4.
I don’t really think an F looks like a 4, but that’s what they tell me.
 Working radio: Because the company is sending a signal to your
radio telling it to unlock itself, your radio must be on and operating
prior to activation. If you’re signing up with XM, you need to tune your
radio to channel 0; if you’re signing up with Sirius, tune your radio to
channel 184.
 Credit card: Yep, the company will take the money before it sends the
signal. You also have to set up an account, so make sure you know to
which address your credit card billing statement goes if you use more
than one.
305
Chapter 15: Extra-Terrestrial Radio

You can save a few bucks by choosing to activate the equipment online. Both
XM and Sirius charge about $10 to activate online and about $15 to activate
by calling customer service.
With both services, after you’ve set up your account and provided payment,
an activation hit will be sent to your radio. This can, at times, take as long as
30 minutes, but in most cases, activation is completed within 15 minutes.
With XM radio, for example, when you can hear channels 7, 9, 47, and 122,
you know your activation is complete, but in both cases, you should simply
be able to scroll through the channels and hear each one.

O
kay, I hate to admit it, but I must; the primary purpose of my laptop is to
keep me entertained. Yes, I use it for all kinds of business-related pur-
poses, but if you really pressed me, you’d find out that I’ve focused a fair
amount of my time and effort in the search for entertainment. And even
though I justify electronic expenses with professional needs, I know, down
deep, I travel with a laptop because I can do all sorts of fun things with it.
Of course, my electronic entertainment isn’t limited to my laptop alone.
Perish the thought. For example, I’ve got music downloaded onto my laptop
and MP3 player; if I ever get around to it, I’ll have it on my phone as well. As
far as video entertainment goes, I’ve downloaded movies, rented DVDs, sub-
scribed to satellite TV, and streamed TV over the Internet. In addition to that,
I found a couple of great places to download digital books.
In this chapter, I take a brief look at just a few ways you can play with your
electronic toys. For example, I tell you a little bit about the many ways you
can bring a little music to your ears using the Internet and your computer. In
case you’re more of a visual person, I tell you about a few ways you can sat-
isfy your need to watch movies, and if you’re more in the mood for TV, I tell
you how you can stream it from the Net and beam it from the sky. Finally, a
word about books because you know, reading is a good thing, even if you let
someone read to you.

Getting Music, Movies and More
(Legally)
I think all moms sing to their kids, but my sister and I were especially 
fortunate — our mom sang with a concert-quality voice. As a matter of fact,
the greatest a cappella rendition of “Silent Night” ever heard by man or beast
might have occurred one winter evening, many moons ago, inside a tiny
Southern Oregon church. When my mom finished the last note, no one
moved, no one spoke, and the only sounds that could be heard were those of
quiet weeping. She says — at 70-plus years of age, still teaching piano and
voice — that she can no longer sing; but that’s okay because whenever I hear
“Silent Night,” it’s always sung by my mom, and strong men still cry.
It was from her, I’m sure, that I got my love of music. Now, understand that
the only instrument I can play is the stereo, and I can’t carry a tune in a tin
bucket. But I definitely appreciate and enjoy the efforts of others more gifted.
In addition to a love of music, I also gained from my mom an appreciation of
movies that bordered on obsession.
When I first realized that not only were movie and music downloads available
from the Internet, but that they also could be had at little or no cost, I was
absolutely euphoric. That euphoria, however, quickly faded when I realized
there were serious ethical issues involved with many sites set up for music
and movie downloads. When you decide to download one of those items,
there are a few things you want to keep in mind:
 Ethics: Even though Web sites have been shut down, laws have been
passed, and people have been sued, it’s still possible to find Web sites
offering pirated music and movie downloads. No matter how you ratio-
nalize it, downloading an unauthorized copy of a song or a DVD is, at the
very best, unethical.
 Safety: It doesn’t happen as often as it used to, but it’s still possible to
run across a Web site offering spyware cleverly disguised as a harmless
music or movie download. Additionally, some file-sharing programs can
open your private information to public scrutiny.
For centuries it’s been recognized as fact that an author or artist creating an
original work, a publisher who creates authorized copies of the original, and
individual owners of these copies all have certain rights. Although a few
copyright laws existed in earlier eras, most agree that the precursor to
modern copyright law was the Statute of Anne passed by British Parliament
on April 10, 1710. Copyright law has continued to change and adapt since the
Statute of Anne was adopted, but the basic need and purpose has remained
the same: To protect the creator and the contracted publishers of artistic and
intellectual work.
308
Part VI: Entertaining Electronics 

It doesn’t take a moral or mental giant to determine that simply owning a
copy of a work doesn’t convey to the owner the right to create and distribute
unlimited copies, regardless of whether the copies are sold or given freely.
It’s true that Fair Use and Access policies do allow an individual to create
copies for personal use — and teachers or journalists can (in most cases) use
copyrighted works for educational and informational purposes without the
owner’s explicit permission. However, any copies failing those tests exist out-
side the law.
If you want to remain on the right side of the law — and I’m sure you do —
make sure you keep the following in mind:
 Avoid sharing copyrighted files on peer-to-peer networks. File-sharing
programs like BitTorrent, LimeWire, Kazaa, and Morpheus can be used
within online networks to share, among other things, music, movies, TV
shows, games, and software. This type of trading, besides running afoul
of copyright laws, can expose you to spyware and make private informa-
tion on your laptop public, too, as I mentioned earlier in this chapter. So
if you do decide to use these networks for the legitimate trading of files,
know the risks.
 Use common sense. If a movie hasn’t yet been released to DVD, why
would it be available for download on the Internet? Only one answer: It’s
a pirated copy. Other clues to potentially illegal download sites include
• Very low cost: If your only cost is a $20 to $50 annual subscription
fee, you can bet that a good portion — not all, but enough to cause
concern — of the music, movies, games, or software available for
download is pirated.
• Lack of affiliations: Most of the legal movie and music download
sites proudly advertise their affiliation with legitimate entertain-
ment creators, producers, and publishers.
• Lack of accountability: Some file-sharing sites tell you not to 
download — or offer for download — copyrighted material, but they
take no responsibility for ensuring that the files available are legally
obtained and offered. Quite the contrary — they tell you that you
and you alone are responsible, and I’m sure they’ll be happy to
point the police in your direction should the opportunity arise.
Putting a Little Music in Your Laptop
Whenever I’m using my laptop for some mundane business task like maintain-
ing my logbook, bookkeeping, or budgeting, I like to listen to a little music. It
doesn’t make the job any easier, or any more fun, but it does make it easier to
309
Chapter 16: Taking the Show on the Road

take. Being a bit of a music junkie, I’ve got multiple options for listening to
music, and I’ve got a few methods of putting music on my laptop, including
the following:
 Ripping from CD: I’m not sure where the term ripping originated, but all
it means is to extract (rip) the digital audio tracks from a CD and store
them on your laptop (or, in some cases, iPods or other portable audio
players) in a different format.
 Downloading: I buy a lot of songs from several Web vendors and down-
load them to my hard drive. This way, if there’s just one song from a par-
ticular CD that I want, that’s all I’ve got to buy.
 Streaming: I subscribe to one music service that allows me to stream
music. I don’t own the copies, but who cares? I can listen as often as I
want without filling up my hard drive. I also, on occasion, stream the
audio from one of several radio stations.
Finding a media player
Before you can listen to music on your computer, you need to install a media
player. Several are available, and even though some offer extra-cost Pro or
Plus versions, most of them are free. If you’ve got Windows XP, chances are
good you’ve already got the Windows Media Player, but there are a few
others as well, including the following:
 Winamp: I like this player because I can listen to AOL Radio (which
includes several XM Radio channels; see Chapter 15), and it’s integrated
with SHOUTcast radio and TV. Winamp also offers a Pro version that
allows you to rip and burn CDs. It’s available for download at
www.winamp.com.
 MediaMonkey: Although this one boasts several attractive features, the
thing I like best about the MediaMonkey media player is its ability to
convert MP3s, OGG, FLAC, and WMA files into other formats. You can 
get more information and download the player by visiting www.media
monkey.com.
 Musicmatch Jukebox: Now owned by Yahoo!, this media player —
unlike so many others — concentrates on audio only. Because of that, 
I think it does an excellent job of both playing and managing music. You
can find more information by visiting www.musicmatch.com.
 RealPlayer: With a menu of features too long to list, the RealPlayer 
is the media player I use most often. It has the ability to play both 
audio and video files in almost every format currently in use, and the
optional Plus version can even help you transfer your record or cassette
collection to your laptop or MP3 player. You can get a ton of information
and download the player of your choice by visiting www.real.com.
310
Part VI: Entertaining Electronics 

 iTunes: It’s free for the taking, but believe me, Apple figures to make a
ton of money with this versatile little player. You can rip your own CDs
into the library, but the iTunes store is always open. Besides music, you
can buy TV shows and audiobooks. You can also browse the iTunes
store for free and premium podcasts. More information about iTunes is
available by visiting www.apple.com/itunes.
There’s just no reason to limit yourself to one media player. Although I have
only one premium player installed, I’ve got and use three others. I suggest
you download a few of the basic players, give ’em a spin, and if you find one
you really like, use that as your default player and delete the ones you don’t
use or need. You can find a comprehensive comparison of media players at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_media_players.
Ripping CDs to your computer
Once you’ve got a media player or three downloaded and installed, you can
begin to transfer your CD collection to your computer. Some of the media
players, like Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, and iTunes, include CD-rip-
ping capability with their basic players, whereas others include this feature
only with their Pro or Plus versions. Personally, I use a completely separate
program application known as Audiograbber for ripping CDs. (I tell you a
little bit more about Audiograbber in Chapter 18.)
Using Windows Media Player as an example (because nearly everyone has it
installed on their computers), follow these steps to rip a CD to your computer:
1. Open the Windows Media Player application.
2. Right-click the Rip tab and choose Tools➪Options.
The Options dialog box opens.
3. Click the Rip Music tab, shown in Figure 16-1.
From this window, you can determine where music files are stored, what
information will be included in the file names, and what format the files
will be saved in, as well as what size and quality the files are.
Windows Media Player, by default, uses the .wma format, but because
it’s almost universally recognized and compatible with most portable
players, I prefer to rip into the MP3 format. MP3s are more bulky files,
but by using the 256Kbps sampling speed, I get a reasonably sized file
that sounds, at least in my opinion, better than the smaller WMA file.
4. Make any changes or adjustments. Click Apply, and click OK.
5. Insert the CD you want to import to your computer.
6. Select the tracks you want to transfer, as shown in Figure 16-2, and
click Rip Music.

Downloading music files
I’ve become addicted to downloading music — so much so that I’ve had to
strictly limit the number of songs I allow myself to purchase for download
each week. No, I’m not going to tell you — and by default, my wife — what
that number is, but let it suffice to say that I’m currently spending less money
on music each week than I used to spend on a single CD. And sometimes two
whole weeks go by without a single musical purchase! I’m always so proud of
myself when that happens.
I think downloading music is addictive because you can purchase one single
song at a time. You don’t have to buy a whole album, thereby getting at least
a few songs you don’t want, but before you know it, you’ve found 15 songs
you can’t live without for one more minute. At almost a buck a crack, that
habit can get expensive in a hurry.
Because downloading anything, including music, uses up a lot of bandwidth, 
I strongly suggest that you try to do all the downloading you can while you’re
at home. That way, you don’t run afoul of any hotspot data transfer or usage
limits, and you don’t slow the Internet connection for everybody else.
I used to buy music from a lot of places, and now . . . only a couple. The
reason for this is purely out of convenience. I tried a bunch of them, settled
on two, and set up accounts so that I can just download the music, and my
card’s billed automatically. Included among those sites that I’ve tried are the
following:
 MSN Music: They don’t offer as many tracks as some of the other ser-
vices, but they’re definitely easy to use. Once you’ve set up an account,
all you’ve got to do is browse and download. They bill your credit card
once a month. You can find them online at http://music.msn.com.
 Real Music Store: Lots and lots of music, but at least for me, it’s a little
less convenient to use. You can access the music store only through
RealPlayer, so if you want to shop here, you’ve got to install the media
player. After that, you’ve got to set up an account. Once the account’s
set up, though, all you’ve got to do is find the songs you’re looking for
and click Buy.
 iTunes Music Store: Did Apple start the whole “legal music download”
deal? I’m not really sure, but having been around since January of 2001,
they’re definitely among the oldest of the legal online music stores. The
iTMS, as it’s commonly known, can be accessed from the iTunes media
player. Install the player, set up an account, and you’re all set to spend
money on music.

Chapter 16: Taking the Show on the Road

 Napster: The nice thing about Napster is that you can register with them,
listen to a tune up to five times, and then either purchase it or subscribe
to their service. (I tell you more about that in the next section.) It’s well
worth your time, I believe, to visit them at www.napster.com.
If you’re downloading music with an eye toward transferring the music to an
iPod, you should be aware that many of the music-download stores (such as
Napster, Yahoo!, and MSN Music) use the WMA format, which is incompatible
with the iPod. Music purchased from iTunes, as well as most of the CDs you
rip — providing you rip to the MP3 or AAC format — is iPod-compatible. If
you’ve got a portable player of a different brand, make sure you check to be
sure it’s compatible with the music you intend to download.
The format of music purchased from the Real Music Store is incompatible
with almost every media player, but by using a conversion tool, you can
change the format to WAV, MP3, or Ogg Vorbis. One such tool is included with
the program application known as Audacity. I tell you a little bit about
Audacity in Chapter 18.
Subscribing to a music service
Several sites have begun to offer music subscription services. Now, at first, 
I didn’t think this was something I’d want to do, but after taking advantage of
a few free trials, I can see how a subscription service could actually save me
money. I mean, I buy music (sometimes, every week), and generally, I’d say 
I spend somewhere around $20 a month in doing so. Most of the subscription
services, however, cost around $10 a month, and although you don’t own the
music, you get unlimited access to more than you could afford to buy for as
long as your subscription’s current.
Nearly all the music subscription services require the use of a proprietary
media player or some other software application, and in some cases, as with
Rhapsody, it’s different from their standard player. This just means you might
have to download another player to go along with your others, but it’s a good
reason to avoid purchasing a premium player until you’ve fully investigated
your options.
Among those offering music-subscription services are the following:
 Rhapsody: To say that I like Rhapsody is a serious understatement. After
having used it for a while, I’m considering scrapping all my other media
players. I can save as much music as I want, I can transfer it to my MP3
player, and when I’m home, I can stream it to my stereo. The thing I like
best, though, is the radio stations that I can build and program. I enter
up to ten artists, and then Rhapsody streams music from them as well as
314
Part VI: Entertaining Electronics 

artists in the same genre. It’s amazing, and I can’t get enough of it. I
could go on and on about the service and the player, but because space
is limited, you can instead find out more by visiting www.real.com.
 AOL Music Now: After purchasing Music Now from Circuit City, AOL
intends to eliminate MusicNet@AOL (which was an extra-cost option
available only to AOL customers) and switch those customers to the
new service. MusicNow is open to the general public and because it’s
Web-based, can be used from any PC. The only thing I don’t like is that
the ability to transfer music to an MP3 player is an option available only
for an additional fee. You can get more information from their Web site
at http://aol.musicnow.com.
 Musicmatch On Demand: The AutoDJ feature in the Musicmatch media
player works a little like the Rhapsody Custom Radio. You can build a
playlist around a few artists, and by incorporating some user-set filters
and On Demand, the playlist will be enhanced with artists and music
that are compatible with your pre-set playlist. This feature really and
truly adds to your enjoyment of music. If you pay for a year, this is one
of the cheapest services. You can get more information by browsing to
www.musicmatch.com.
 Yahoo! Music Unlimited: You would think, because Yahoo! already owns
Musicmatch On Demand, that they wouldn’t have started an entirely
new service, but here it is. If you take the time to configure your prefer-
ences, YMU can make playlist suggestions you might not have thought
of. And I’d have to say that the personal-preference-driven LAUNCHcast
radio is a strong competitor to the Rhapsody Custom Radio. This ser-
vice, like its On Demand sister, is only $4.99 per month if you pay for a
year in advance. More information is easily found by navigating to
http://music.yahoo.com.
 Napster: The cool thing about Napster is that you can really give it a
workout before you finally decide whether to subscribe to the service.
They let you play every song up to five times before requiring you to
either subscribe or purchase the song. That’s a good deal. On top of
that, they’ve got a huge online community that provides playlists and
suggestions; you can build custom radio stations like you can with
Rhapsody, and Napster can be streamed to your stereo. As with AOL
MusicNow, though, you have to pay an extra five bucks a month if you
want to load music onto an MP3 player. It’s worth a look, though, and
you can get a glimpse by browsing to www.napster.com.
If you’re planning on using free trial periods to evaluate the suitability of each
one of these services, I strongly suggest that you evaluate only one at a time.
If you miss the trial-cancellation date, you’re on the hook for (at the very
least) a full month. AOL, at 30 days, offers the longest trial period, while
those of the Napster and the two Yahoo! services are only a week in duration.
Give ’em each a good whirl, and choose carefully.

Chapter 16: Taking the Show on the Road

As with the music-download sites, none of the music from subscription sites
can be transferred to an iPod. Make sure you check the FAQs for information
concerning portable-player compatibility for each of the services.
Watching Movies on the Road
I purchased a wide-screen laptop specifically so I could watch movies on it.
I’m sure I justified the extra expense by convincing myself that a wide-screen
laptop would let me open and work on several windows at the same time, but
really, it was just so I could use my laptop as a DVD viewer. Lots of people
carry a DVD player with them for watching movies on their TV, but for me,
I’ve found that my laptop works remarkably well. If you really want to,
though, most laptops can be connected to a TV and used like a traditional
DVD player; more about that a little later.
Currently, movies that can go mobile are found in the following formats:
 VHS tapes: It’s difficult for me to turn my back on a technology that 
I once held so dearly, but alas, I must say, “Good night, good night!
Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say good night ’til it be
morrow.” (Romeo and Juliet, Act 2, Scene II) As we all know, “morrow”
never comes, and the demise of tape isn’t tragic.
 DVD discs: Other than their ridiculously high price, what’s not to like?
They don’t take up much space, the playback quality is spectacular, and
DVDs usually include some great bonus features.
 Digital downloads: Taking up space only on your hard drive, these are
the ultimate in mobile movies, but because disk space is limited and
downloading a large file can be a hassle, they’re not without their issues.
Downloading pros and cons
Right now, if you want to legally download movies, you’ve only got a couple
of choices:
 Movielink: According to their Web site, Movielink is “a joint venture of
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures
Entertainment, Universal Studios and Warner Bros. Studios. Movielink
draws its content offerings from the vast libraries of those studios as
well as Walt Disney Pictures, Miramax, Artisan and others on a non-
exclusive basis.” Movielink’s Web site URL is www.movielink.com.
316
Part VI: Entertaining Electronics 

 CinemaNow: Included among the companies affiliated with CinemaNow
are 20th Century Fox, ABC News, Disney, Endemol, MGM, Miramax, NBC
Universal, Sony, Sundance Channel, Warner Bros., and Lions Gate
Entertainment. You can find CinemaNow on the Web at www.cinema
now.com.
Both Movielink and CinemaNow offer movies for sale or rent, but while all are
available for rent, only some are available for purchase. If you choose to rent
a movie from either vendor, you find they share the following traits:
 24-hour viewing: Once you start watching a movie, you have 24 hours to
finish watching it. The clock starts ticking as soon as you begin to watch
it, and when 24 hours is up, the movie disappears from your hard drive.
• Pro: The good thing about this is that once you’re done watching
the movie, even if it’s not Mission Impossible, it self-destructs and
no longer takes up space on your hard drive.
• Con: The bad thing is that if you start watching the movie and
something prevents you from finishing within the 24-hour period,
you’re probably going to have to pay another rental fee. It’s possi-
ble, though, that you might not have to download the movie all
over again.
 30-day storage: After you rent a movie, you’ve got 30 days in which to
download and watch the movie.
• Pro: You can download several movies before leaving on a trip,
and they’ll be ready to view when you are ready to watch.
• Con: If you don’t get around to watching or downloading the movie
within the 30-day time period, you’re out of luck.
 Streaming: If you want, you can start watching a movie shortly after you
begin downloading — usually within a minute.
• Pro: If you just can’t wait to see the movie, you don’t have to.
• Con: Your 24-hour viewing period begins before you’ve even fin-
ished downloading the movie.
The 30-day storage period, due to licensing agreements that limit the length
of time a movie can be offered for download, might be shorter than 30 days.
Make sure, before you download a movie, that you know exactly how long the
movie can be stored. Generally, if the storage period is, for whatever reason,
shorter than 30 days, it’s clearly and prominently stated in the preview area.
If you’d rather own the movies you download, you can, if you choose, purchase
certain movies from either Movielink or CinemaNow. As with the rental movies,
both services have certain common traits. Among them are the following:
317
Chapter 16: Taking the Show on the Road

 Download window: As with the rental downloads, you have 30 days
from the date of purchase to download a movie, but if the movie’s
removed from the site due to licensing agreements before the 30 days is
up and before you download it, you might be making calls to customer
service in an effort to recover your funds. Good luck with that.
 Large file size: What can I say; movie files are huge, sometimes exceed-
ing one gigabyte. It takes up to 90 minutes to download a movie, even on
a fast connection, and if your hard-drive capacity is 40 gigabytes or less,
you can fill it up in a hurry with movie files.
 DVD-burning: Although you can burn a purchased movie to DVD, the
Windows Media Player format won’t allow it to be played in a traditional
DVD player.
I strongly urge you to avoid using a public hotspot for movie downloads. For
one thing, some hotspot providers impose a data transfer limit, and if you
exceed that limit before your movie download is completed, you could
encounter some problems. Common courtesy, though, is the biggest reason
to avoid downloading any large file at a public hotspot. Big files clog the
bandwidth, and while you’re downloading your movie, everyone else’s con-
nection is slowed to a crawl.
Renting instead of downloading
Even though I’ve downloaded a rental movie or three, I much prefer to watch
DVDs. They don’t take up space on my hard drive, and I don’t have to spend
an hour and a half downloading them from the Web. The thing is, I can watch
most movies only once or twice. I’ve got my favorites that I can see over and
over again and never tire of them, but for the most part, if I’ve seen it once
I’m done with it.
In the old days, it used to be impossible to rent movies to take on the road
because, by the time I got home and returned the movie, I’d end up paying
more in late fees than the movie was worth. Enter: Netflix. Well, they entered
the room way before I ever knew they existed, so, I guess, it’s more like,
Enter: Awareness of Netflix.
With Netflix, you pay a monthly subscription fee, choose a bunch of movies
you want to watch, and depending on your subscription plan, they start
sending them to you. When you’re done with one, you send it back in the
postage prepaid envelope that they provide, and they send the next one in
line. It works out great if you get home every once in a while because you can
drop the movies in the mail as you watch them, and by the time you get
home, you’ve got new ones waiting for you.
318
Part VI: Entertaining Electronics 

If you hear about a movie currently showing in theaters that you’d like to see,
but you’re afraid you’ll forget about it before it’s released as a DVD, Netflix
allows you to add it to your movie queue. When the DVD’s finally released, it
takes its turn in rotation.
Of course, Netflix isn’t the only game in town. Included among the online
movie rental sites are:
 Netflix: Yeah, I know, I already mentioned them, but I didn’t tell you that
you could find them on the Web at www.netflix.com.
 Blockbuster: If you don’t think Netflix had a hand in the elimination of
late fees at Blockbuster, you’d better think again. And because I’d put my
credit card on the line for my oldest nephew’s Blockbuster membership,
no one was happier than me. Blockbuster’s service and pricing are very
similar to Netflix, but Blockbuster also rents games. You can find them on
the Web by pointing your browser toward www.blockbuster.com.
 CafeDVD: They’re a little more expensive than both Netflix and
Blockbuster, but because their subscription plan’s more flexible and
because they offer a lot of movies that you just can’t get from Netflix or
Blockbuster, you might want to give them a close look. They also sell
some DVDs at wholesale prices to subscribers. You can find out more
about CafeDVD by visiting their Web site at www.cafedvd.com.
 GreenCine: Again, it’s hard to compare them with the others because
their subscription plans work out a little bit differently, but they’re defi-
nitely competitive. GreenCine specializes in independent films, but they
also carry current releases. Like CafeDVD, they have out of print DVDs
available, and they also offer a Video On Demand service you might
want to check out at www.greencine.com/main.

Using your laptop as a DVD player
Although you can simply watch movies on your
laptop monitor, many people prefer to watch
them on a larger TV screen. Providing that both
your laptop and your TV share common con-
nections or can be adapted, you should find it
fairly easy and fairly inexpensive to plug your
laptop into your TV and use it as a DVD player.
Most laptops recently and currently available
include either an S-Video or Super S-Video con-
nection port. The S-Video port has four pin
holes, while the Super S-Video port sports
seven. Assuming your TV also has one of these
connection ports, you should be able to make
the connection. Even if your laptop, for example,
has a seven-pin Super S-Video port and your TV
has a four-pin S-Video port, you can find and
buy a compatible connection cable. Rather than
provide step-by-step setup instructions I point
you to the best setup guide I’ve seen, which is
found on the CinemaNow Web site at
www.cinemanow.com/PC-to-TV.aspx.
They provide a complete setup guide as well as
links to Web sites that offer connection cables
and adapters.

Streaming TV
Since Newton Minow, the Chairman of the FCC from 1961–1963, first uttered
the words, in a speech to the National Association of Broadcasters on May 9,
1961, TV has often been referred to as a “vast wasteland.” Whether that’s true
or not is up to you to decide. Personally, I really enjoy TV, and while not
every episode ever produced has found my favor (or even most of them),
there are a fair number that I really enjoy.
Most of the time, I prefer to watch TV while sitting sprawled in my comfy
chair with my feet propped up on the ottoman. No truck I’ve ever driven has
come equipped with such a setup, but I’ve still found watching TV from my
home on wheels to be an enjoyable diversion. Recently, the “wasteland” has
expanded to the Internet as several Web sites have begun to offer TV
episodes and series that can be either downloaded or streamed.
Getting TV via the Internet
A lot of the TV available for viewing over the Internet has made me believe
that, just maybe, TV is, after all, a vast wasteland. I’m sure there are some
entertaining things said at school board meetings and state senate sessions,
but I think I’d prefer something more like Maverick or Monk.
Fortunately, though, both Monk and Maverick — along with a whole bunch of
other current and classic TV episodes — are offered by several sites, including:
 iTunes: According to their Web site, the iTunes Music Store offers select
episodes and complete series from, among others, ABC, NBC, MTV,
ESPN, Sci-Fi Channel, Comedy Central, Disney, Nickelodeon, and
Showtime. You can buy one episode at a time, or in some cases, you can
purchase a whole season. More information’s available from their Web
site at www.apple.com/itunes/videos.
 In2TV: This is where I found Maverick, along with old episodes of Chico
and the Man and The FBI with Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. You can watch full-
length episodes of old favorites at no cost, and should you choose, you
can join their Hi-Q Video closed network and receive full-screen, DVD-
quality videos of some classics. It’s offered by AOL and you can find out
more at http://television.aol.com/in2tv.
 SHOUTcast: Available with the Winamp media player, SHOUTcast is one
of those offering a multitude of channels — some interesting and some
just downright strange. The most popular stations, running both current
320
Part VI: Entertaining Electronics 

and classic episodes, are those run by ESS. They’re offered free, but
because they limit the bandwidth available to nonpaying viewers, you
might never find a time when their server’s not full. If you pay a $5
monthly subscription fee, you’re assured of access. You can find out
more about SHOUTcast from the Winamp Web site and more about ESS
from their Web site at www.ess.tv.
 CNN Pipeline: Offered as a subscription, Internet-only news service for
$2.95 per month, you can choose from four different live feeds, browse
broadcasts from earlier in the day, or choose on-demand videos. The
Pipeline is downloaded from CNN and operates independently of your
Web browser. You can get more information by visiting
www.cnn.com/pipeline.
 Trio Network: I can’t tell you much about this yet because, as I’m writ-
ing this, it’s not yet a reality. About the same time cheers were going up
in Times Square to signal the end of 2005 and celebrating the beginning
of 2006, Bravo pulled Trio from cable and began working on bringing it,
in total, to the Web as an Internet-only offering. You can find out more
and sign up to be notified of its debut by visiting www.trioplus.tv/

Chapter 16: Taking the Show on the Road
Slinging TV from home
One high-tech gadget that I haven’t yet tried,
even though it’s been on the market for a while,
is called the Slingbox, which you can see in the
following figure. With this amazing little device
connected to both your home TV and the
Internet, you can actually watch your own TV
from anywhere you’ve got an Internet connec-
tion. All you need at home is a TV source (like
satellite, cable, or antenna) and an Ethernet
connection to a router with a broadband
Internet connection. Sling Media even offers a
Powerline Ethernet Bridge that will connect
your Slingbox to the router through your electri-
cal wiring.
After you set up the necessary hardware at
home, you just need to install the free
SlingPlayer on your computer and connect to
the Internet. If you’ve got TiVo or some other
DVR, you can watch your recorded program-
ming, watch live TV, or even program your DVR
right over the Internet. Even if you’re not sure
whether this is something you’re interested in,
you should, at the very least, visit the Sling
Media Web site at www.slingmedia.com.
SlingPlayer Mobile software also makes it pos-
sible to watch your home TV on a Pocket PC,
cellphone, or smartphone using the Windows
Mobile OS.

Scoping Out Satellite TV
Satellite TV, especially for those spending week after week on the road, is
quite possibly the preferred TV viewing choice. Currently, you have two
choices in a satellite TV provider:
 DIRECTV: Their Total Choice MOBILE package offers 155 channels of
programming, including several XM Radio channels, for $41.99 per
month. The DIRECTV Web site is located at www.directv.com, but I
recommend you call customer service (at 888-777-2454) or visit a nearby
dealer for more information.
 DISH Network: Just trying to figure out which of their plans would best
suit your needs could take days. The DISH Network, offering a little more
flexibility in the local programming available to those with wheels on
their homes, allows you to choose up to two local network packages
from Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, or New York. You can find
more information at www.dishnetwork.com.
Even though plenty of information is available from the DIRECTV and DISH
Network Web sites, I suggest that you visit your local dealer for the best
information. The Web sites and customer-service representatives you’re
likely to contact by phone have lots of information regarding home installa-
tions, but usually aren’t quite so prepared to answer your questions regard-
ing a mobile installation.
The three items necessary to secure service for a mobile system include the
following:
 Satellite antenna: Those little dishes they used to sell in the truck stops
are now best used as Frisbees, according to those in the know. You can
find satellite TV antennas ranging in price from a couple hundred dollars
to a couple thousand dollars, so shop around to find the antenna that
best suits both your needs and desires.
 Receiver: Your best bet is to purchase your receiver from the dealer.
You can find them on eBay and in the classifieds, but because there have
been many new developments in the technology, you should shop the
dealership before going elsewhere for the hardware. For example, both
DISH Network and DIRECTV now offer DVR– and HD–capable equipment.
 Service subscription: Even though there are only a couple of providers,
these providers offer plans galore. These plans and the channels avail-
able for mobile subscriptions vary from those available for home-based
subscriptions, so make sure you carefully consider those choices that
might be available to you.
322
Part VI: Entertaining Electronics 

As a mobile subscriber, you must provide proof to your chosen service
provider that you meet certain criteria. Before either DISH Network or
DIRECTV will accept your subscription application, you must provide a
signed Declaration of Intent. In addition to that, if you’re an RV owner, you
need to provide a copy of your current state vehicle registration, and if
you’re an OTR trucker, you need to provide a copy of your CDL and a copy of
your current state vehicle registration. (You can’t use a satellite TV dish to
get a satellite Internet connection, but you can use a satellite Internet dish to
get both TV and the Internet. If you’re interested, check out Chapter 9.)
Settling on a satellite antenna
One of the first considerations in setting up a satellite TV system is the satel-
lite antenna. Because most satellite TV dealerships are set up, primarily, to
install systems for homes, they might not be able to provide you with an
antenna. Not to worry, you should be able to find an RV dealership in your
area that sells and installs suitable satellite antennas. The two primary satel-
lite TV antenna manufacturers are:
 Winegard: With satellite TV antennas ranging from the low-profile
LP1000 that can maintain a satellite connection even with the vehicle in
motion to the portable, ground-mounted RD-9046, chances are good that
Winegard has an antenna that meets your needs. For the budget-con-
scious, you can check out the RM-DM46 or RM-DM61. You can find them
on the Web at www.winegard.com.
 KVH Industries: Offering a serious selection of satellite antennas that can
maintain communication while your vehicle is in motion, the KVH
TracVision R6 and A5, as well as Series 2 and 3, provide enough versatil-
ity to meet anyone’s needs. They’re located on the Web at www.kvh.com.
Before you begin looking at the in-motion antennas, you should get ready for
some sticker shock because these antennas, which are taking over the
market, will, in all likelihood, set you back well over $1,000. As a matter of
fact, the very cool-looking KVH TracVision A5, which is designed specifically
for use with the DIRECTV Total Choice MOBILE Package, has a suggested
retail price of $2,295.
Setting up the system
I’m a big-time do-it-yourself kind of guy. However, were I getting ready to
install a satellite TV system in my truck or RV, I’d be on my way down to the
local satellite shop. It’s not that I don’t think I couldn’t get the job done, it’s
323
Chapter 16: Taking the Show on the Road

just that I like things installed in a neat, clean, and orderly fashion — and the
chances are good that your local dealership either does a lot of mobile instal-
lations or they can point you in the direction of someone who does.
Experience counts.
Once you’ve got the system installed, it’s time to get it commissioned. Your
dealer can walk you through the process, and because the satellite antenna
needs to be aimed with a fair amount of precision so that the activation
signal can be sent to your receiver, this is another good reason to have the
system installed by a professional.
Getting Bookish
For a long time, I’ve enjoyed books on tape, and even though the words
“always” and “never” are seldom appropriate, I think I can safely say that I’m
never found without a book to read. As a matter of fact, I usually have several
just in case I finish one while I’m in a book-free zone. Recently, I found a few
Web sites that offer digital books. A couple of them provide books in print,
while the others offer audio books that can be downloaded to your computer.
A few of the sites are
 Audible.com: Considering the cost of books on tape, this Web site offers
downloadable digital books at bargain-basement prices. You don’t have
to subscribe to the service to buy books, but if you purchase even an
annual subscription for less than $10, you can get an even bigger dis-
count. Once you’ve downloaded the book, you can listen to it on your
computer, burn it to CD, or transfer it to a portable player. For more
information, go to www.audible.com.
324
Part VI: Entertaining Electronics 
Gaming on the go
Entire books are written about games and
gaming, but not so much about games, game
boxes and consoles that are being used in a
mobile environment. That could be because,
although live gaming over the Internet is great
at home, it doesn’t seem to translate into quite
as much fun at hotspots. Xbox Live, for example,
can be more than a little frustrating to play at a
hotspot that, because it’s using a VSAT connec-
tion to the Internet, doesn’t maintain an upload
and download speed sufficient to support the
games. In addition, the latency inherent with
satellite Internet connections will absolutely
wreak havoc with the gaming experience.
Games designed to be played online, but with a
computer rather than a game box or console,
seem to be more playable, but latency and vari-
ations in connection speed can cause a 
problem here as well. Your best bet for gaming-
on-the-go is to bring your games with you and
see if you can set up a local-area network (LAN)
with some nearby gamers rather than taking it
to the Net.

 eBookwise: Offering e-books specially formatted for use with the
eBookwise-1150 e-book reader, they’ve got hundreds of books for sale,
but they can be read only on the reader. You can get more information
by visiting their Web site at www.ebookwise.com.
 Project Gutenberg: With over 18,000 free e-books available for down-
load, this site is a bookworm’s delight. Most of the books offered on the
site are in the Public Domain (meaning the U.S. copyright has expired),
so you won’t find any recent bestsellers here — but for those among you
who haven’t read everything by Herman Melville, Jack London, or Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle (to name a very few), it’s well worth taking a look.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
’m not sure where or how the inclusion of The Part of
Tens in every For Dummies book originated. Maybe it
was inspired by the top ten lists of David Letterman who,
like those good folks at Wiley Publishing, hails from
Indianapolis, Indiana. Anyway, in Chapter 17, I tell you
about at least ten accessories that can add to the life, 
utility, and your enjoyment, of your over-the-road elec-
tronic devices. In Chapter 18, you find out about ten good
program applications that, besides being interesting and
useful, won’t cost you a dime.

Chapter 17
Ten Must-Have Travel
Accessories
In This Chapter
 Toting the toys
 Packing power and cleanliness
 Adding laptop accessories
 Bringing along music and photos
O
nce, a long time ago, the owner of the company I drove for asked me to
make a quick trip to Sioux City, Iowa — just to pick up a trailer from the
Thermo King shop. Although it was my day off and my truck was being serv-
iced, I agreed to go anyway. Wearing a T-shirt, cutoffs, and sandals, without
any of my gear, I jumped into an empty truck and bobtailed to town. I figured
I’d be home by three o’clock.
I was gone for ten days. Sometime around Day Two or Three, severely under-
accessorized and singing along with the Beach Boys’ version of “Sloop John B,”
I vowed that I’d never again go anywhere without all my stuff — ’cause stuff’s
important.
As I’ve grown older, the list of stuff I consider to be indispensable — the stuff
I won’t leave home without — has grown a bit beyond a bag of jeans and
boxers. Included among those items are, of course, various accessories, elec-
tronic and otherwise, designed to make life on the road a little easier. Now, I
know that a ton of toys can add to enjoyment on the road, but the more
you’ve got, the more you’ve got to move. That’s why, in this chapter, I include
in my list of accessories — not only items that enhance your ability to use
and enjoy your tools and toys, but an item or two that can help you keep
things organized and get them packed away.

Toting Your Laptop in the Right Luggage
Everything you lug around with you requires luggage, yes it does, and I now
have a selection of laptop bags ranging in condition from tattered to top-
notch. After ripping my way through quite a number of inexpensive bags, I’ve
come to the conclusion that, when shopping for laptop luggage, cheap is not
the way to go. There are a bunch of really good bags on the market, and there
are two that I know, for sure, I can recommend:
 Kensington Contour Roller: I always thought that wheels on luggage
were for flight attendants and lazy businessmen. I no longer hold that
antiquated view — now that I’m somewhat of an antique myself — but
wheeled luggage, when used in an over-the-road environment, has got to
be tough. The Kensington Contour Roller is pretty light in weight but
definitely not a lightweight when it comes to being sturdy. The shoulder
strap, handle, and contour design also make it pretty easy to carry when
wheels are out of the question. You can get more information by visiting
their Web site at http://us.kensington.com.
 Samsonite Business One Mobile Office: Besides the fact that it rolls, the
thing I like best about this — and most of the Samsonite product line —
is that it seems nearly indestructible. It also provides a lot of protection
for my laptop and all the rest of the stuff that it has plenty of room to
store. If I had one complaint, though, it would be this: If you’re in an area
where wheels won’t work, this case isn’t as easy to tote around as the
Kensington Contour. I do like it, though, and if you’re interested, you can
get more information from (among other places) the Samsonite Web site
at http://us.samsonite.com.
Maintaining Your Laptop
Granted, there’s not a lot of external maintenance required for a laptop — or
any electronic gadget, for that matter — but there are a couple things that need
to be taken care of on a regular basis. For example, gadgets have batteries, and
batteries run down. Gadgets also get dirty and need to be cleaned. Here are a
couple of accessories that can keep you going and keep you clean — clean
around the country.
Charging up
If you’ve got a built-in inverter (the gadget that changes battery current from
12V DC to 110-120V AC), it never hurts to have a backup — and if you don’t
have one, this one should fill the bill quite nicely. The Xantrex Pocket
330
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Powerpack 100 combines a 100-watt inverter with a high-capacity, high-
output battery pack that has a three-prong power outlet and USB charging
port. The battery pack can power your laptop for up to two and a half hours,
or you can plug the inverter into the DC power port on your vehicle, recharg-
ing both the Powerpack 100 battery and your laptop’s battery.
The USB charging port can charge or power compatible cellphones, PDAs, or
iPods in less than a half-hour, and if you don’t think you really need the com-
bination of a battery and inverter, you can instead choose the Xantrex
XPower 100 or Xantrex XPower 175 DC-to-AC inverter. Both have a standard,
three-prong, AC outlet as well as the USB charging port, and the 175 provides
up to 175 watts of power. You can get more information about these devices
from the Xantrex Web site at www.xantrex.com, and they’re available at
Crutchfield and other online retailers.
Keeping your laptop clean
A laptop can be a dirt magnet. Most of them are made of some combination
of plastic and light metals — and with the spinning fans and electricity run-
ning through them, the static electricity that’s created attracts dust, dirt, and
hair at an alarming rate. I’ve heard of folks cleaning keyboards, fans, and
ports with compressed air cans, but I really don’t recommend that — and
under no circumstances should you consider attacking your laptop with the
air hose you might use to clean your cab. There are a couple of things I’ve
found, however, that can help you keep your laptop spic’n’span.
Deferring dirt
Dust has a way of working its way into every nook and cranny — especially, it
seems, in an over-the-road environment. Even with the lid closed, a laptop
can become dusty, dirty, and grimy. As a matter of fact, while happily typing
away, you deposit a little oil from your fingers on each of the keys you touch.
I’ve found a product, though, that can help to keep that oil from being trans-
ferred to the screen when the lid’s closed — and at the same time keep dust
from getting on the keys.
The Notebook ScreensavRz, manufactured and sold by RadTech, can help to
protect your laptop’s LCD screen from body oils and dirt as well as from
scratching and abrasion. The ScreensavRz (a 0.6-millimeter-thick polishing
fabric that you lay on your keyboard before closing the lid) can help to main-
tain a clean keyboard and screen — and can actually polish and remove
scratches from your screen! It was designed for use with Macs, but RadTech
offers models made for PCs as well. You can get more information from their
Web site at www.radtech.us.

Chapter 17: Ten Must-Have Travel Accessories

Eradicating dirt
No matter how you try — with or without the ScreensavRz — your laptop is
bound to get dirty. When it does, I recommend using a handy little product
manufactured by LensPen — the Laptop-Pro. With an optical-grade chamois
on one end and two brushes on the other end (one for removing dust from
the screen and another for removing dirt and dust from the keyboard), it’s
the best tool for cleaning a laptop I’ve ever run across. By visiting the
LensPen Web site at www.lenspen.com, you can get more information about
the Laptop-Pro, as well as tips on the best methods of use.
Accessorizing Your Workspace
It just makes sense to make your workspace as comfortable and efficient as
possible. Here I tell you about a few items that can make life and work on the
road a little less taxing and a little more convenient.
Desks without legs
I use a portable laptop desk while traveling. I do so because, first, I some-
times prefer to use a mouse instead of the touch pad, and second, most
laptop desks incorporate some method of cooling the laptop (besides insulat-
ing your lap from the heat generated by a laptop).
Now, I haven’t owned or extensively tested a whole bunch of laptop desks,
but recently, when I went shopping for a new one, I found the Targus
Notebook Portable LapDesk — which was recommended in one magazine or
another, so I thought I’d give it a go. The three things I like best about it are:
 It’s light. Weighing in at a couple ounces less than a pound and a half,
it’s definitely not a burden to carry around.
 It’s small. Like a lot of laptop desks, it folds in the middle and when
folded, measures less than one square foot. It also fits in my laptop bag.
What more could you want?
 It’s cheap. It could go up in price — but I paid less than thirty bucks for
mine, and I think that’s a pretty good deal.
It’s got ventilation channels under the laptop, similar to others, but — and this
is the thing that sets it apart — it’s also got an adjustable foot that raises the
back edge of the laptop. Raising the back of the laptop accomplishes two things:
First, by increasing airflow, it improves cooling; second, with the rear of the
laptop raised, I find it easier to use the keyboard. You can get more information
about the Targus LapDesk by visiting their Web site at www.targus.com.
332
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Another laptop desk and pad manufacturer — one that you should most defi-
nitely take a look at when shopping for a laptop desk — is LapLogic. Their
Traveler Series LapPads, although not rigid enough to be called desks, help 
to dissipate heat. And their Guardian Series Laptop Desks, which are made 
of the same material as the heat-dissipating pads, are both colorful and 
lightweight. You can get more information from their Web site at http://
laplogic.com.
Mice without tails
My wife has finally convinced me that a mouse is better than a touch pad or
pointing stick, and I’m sure there are myriad mice that do a great job. But in
an effort to reduce the number of cords and wires hanging off of my laptop, 
I made the decision to opt for a Bluetooth wireless mouse. There are quite a
number of them available, so I had no problem finding a few to choose from.
When the shopping dust had settled, I’d narrowed the field to two, and I think
either of these will do quite nicely.
 Bluetake BT500: The Bluetake Web site says you can use this mouse up
to 10 meters away from a Bluetooth-enabled computer. That’s just great,
but if I’m 33 feet from my laptop, I can’t possibly see the cursor. So
what’s the point? (Well, if you’re giving PowerPoint presentations to
illustrate the many benefits dock personnel will enjoy by getting you
unloaded before anyone else, you can wander around and away from
your laptop while doing so.) Anyway, the BT500’s a mini mouse, and
although I didn’t think I’d want a small mouse, when I gave it a try, it felt
fine, and I liked the fact that it took up less space in the bag. If you don’t
have integrated Bluetooth capability, you can buy their Combo Pack,
which includes the USB-powered BT009X Bluetooth adapter. You can get
more information from their Web site at www.bluetake.com, and it’s
also available from several online retailers.
 Anycom Blue Mini Mouse BTM-100: The Blue Mini Mouse BTM-100 is
powered by AAA batteries that can be recharged while in use, with the
included USB Power Clip. During recharging, the mouse works like a reg-
ular wired mouse, and once charged, the clip can be removed. This
mouse boasts the ridiculous range of 30 meters. What are these people
thinking? I don’t know about you, but I’ve never had the urge to browse
the Web through a pair of binoculars. Nonetheless, it’s a great product,
and if you need a Bluetooth adapter, the BTM-100 can be bundled with
the Anycom Blue USB-120 or USB-130 adapter. More information’s avail-
able at www.anycom.com, and it’s available from quite a number of
online retailers.

Phones without hands
I guess, technically speaking, no phone has hands, and I should have titled
this section, “Hands-free phones,” but . . . I’ve got a kind of theme going here.
You understand, don’t you? Sure you do, and I’ve got a couple of interesting
phone accessories to tell you about that could cause you to say something
like, “Look ma, no hands!” So, without any further ado. . . . 
 ClearOne Chat 50: The ClearOne Chat 50 is a USB-powered speaker-
phone that really shines when it’s connected to a laptop to make VoIP
calls. (I introduce VoIP in Chapter 13.) But, provided you’re using the
optional external AC adapter for power, you can also connect it to a 
cellphone via the headphone jack. The Chat 50 also has full-duplex 
capability, meaning that you can both hear and speak to the person on
the other end of the call at the same time. That’s a feat most cellphones
are incapable of performing. You can get more information by visiting
their Web site at www.clearone.com.
 Bluetake BT400 G5 Headset: I’ve already mentioned Bluetake once in
this chapter, and because they make some really good Bluetooth wire-
less products, I could probably mention them again. (But I won’t.) The
BT400 G5 Headset is among the best they offer. True, you’ve got to have
a Bluetooth-capable cellphone to use this baby, but really, it’s so good
that, if you haven’t already got one, you should run right out and get a
cellphone with Bluetooth technology. I mean, you can actually be nearly
100 feet from your cellphone and still talk on it using this thing. Not only
that, but the volume is also so loud and clear you can easily hear the
other party in the noisiest of conditions. More information’s available by
visiting Bluetake at www.bluetake.com.
Entertaining Accessories
In the previous chapter, I gave you a few ideas about using your electronic
wonders to enhance and expand your over-the-road entertainment choices.
Here I’ve got a couple ideas about some accessories that can improve your
enjoyment of that entertainment, as well as one that can help you share,
save, and remember your experiences on the road.
MP3 players
Once you’ve got music on your laptop, it’s really nice to be able to listen to it
anytime and anywhere. All you need is an MP3 player. Everyone, it seems, is
in love with their iPods — and if I’d ever had one, I probably would be too.
334
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

I’m a bit of a contrarian, so when I decided it was finally time to join the rest
of the world and put hundreds of songs on a device that was just a little bit
bigger than a pack of gum, I went looking for a non-iPod player.
I found, during my shopping, that there were actually quite a few really good
non-iPods out there. Because I wasn’t sure just how much use I was going to
get out of this kind of gadget, I decided to go with the cheapest one I could
find that was well reviewed. I came up with the Zen Nano Plus. It’s manufac-
tured by Creative, offered with a storage capacity of either 512MB or 1GB,
and it’s compatible with either MP3– or WMA–formatted music.
The 1GB version of the Nano Plus can store around 500 songs and comes
complete with an FM tuner. The one thing that really caught my eye, however,
is that it also includes Line-In encoding so that you can connect directly to —
and record from — any audio source. The Nano Plus package includes a Line-
in cable for recording from a CD or cassette player, and with a mini-plug-to-
RCA-plug adapter, you can even record vinyl LPs directly from the turntable
or amp. This player’s available from Wal-Mart, Best Buy, or any number of
online retailers, and more information’s available on the Creative Web site at:
www.creative.com.
Portable speakers
With the proliferation of MP3 players has come a nearly equal boom in the
number of portable speakers capable of giving the little devices a big voice.
For me, though, I wanted a set of portable speakers that could also be used
as external laptop speakers. I found just what I was looking for in the
Boomtube H2O1, manufactured by Think Outside. They’re not, at around
$250 a set, what I’d call inexpensive, but the sound is superb. If you’re inter-
ested, you can find their Web site at www.thinkoutside.com.
Sharing your over-the-road life
I can’t imagine traveling without a camera. Not, mind you, that I’ve always
had a camera; I haven’t. And because I haven’t, I’ve missed out on the oppor-
tunity to share some amazing sights with my family and friends. No more,
though — because I recently found a reasonably priced digital camera that
can take wide angle shots as well as optical-zoom photos with up to 5X mag-
nification. What is this amazing camera? Why, it’s the Kodak EasyShare V570,
of course.
335
Chapter 17: Ten Must-Have Travel Accessories

The beauty of the Kodak EasyShare line of cameras is, as the moniker implies,
the ease with which photos can be organized, edited, and shared. The
EasyShare button on the back of the camera makes it a snap to tag photos that
you want to print or e-mail; EasyShare software helps you make those photos
look their absolute best, and the included EasyShare Photo Frame Dock 2
helps you transfer photos to your computer with a single touch. What more
could you ask for? Well, you could ask that it be priced at less than $400 —
and it is. More information’s available at www.kodak.com.
Of course, the camera is king when it comes to accessories, and the Kodak
EasyShare line is no exception. The V570 comes standard with enough stuff
to get you started and keep you going, but after a while, you might start feel-
ing the need to accessorize. And wouldn’t you know it, Kodak is there to help.
The EasyShare line looks like it’s going to be around for awhile, so I’m sure
they’ll come up with a lot of cool stuff for you to drool over.

Ten Fantastic Free Applications
In This Chapter
 Making your desktop work for you
 Keeping an eye on your computer
 Finding free office applications
 Having some fun with your computer
C
hances are good, if you’ve read any part of this book, that you already
know I’m enamored with almost anything that advertises itself as free.
And even if this is the first chapter you’re reading, I’m willing to bet that the
word free has a special place in your heart as well. Now, I grant you, the word
free doesn’t always really mean free, and having studied economics, I believe
TANSTAAFL (There Ain’t No Such Thing As A Free Lunch) to be a truism.
All the above notwithstanding, I’ve gathered together, in this chapter, ten
applications that — even if they’re not perfectly polished — won’t require
you to whip out your credit card prior to installing them. And believe me, it
wasn’t easy to whittle the list of free stuff found on the Web down to ten
items. The Web sites I visit regularly to shop for freeware include these:
 Softpile.com: www.softpile.com
 SnapFiles: www.snapfiles.com
 Softpedia: www.softpedia.com
 FreewareFiles: www.freewarefiles.com
 Tucows: www.tucows.com
As you might guess, enticing unsuspecting cheapskates like me with the
promise of free software is one way Internet scoundrels manage to con folks
into downloading malicious programs. Those sites I mention in the preceding
list, as well as several others, do all they can to be sure the program applica-
tions they offer for download are virus-free. If you’ve got any doubt about the
site or the program, play it safe and don’t download.

Enhancing Your Desktop
If you spend a fair amount of time staring at your computer, it’s nice to have
your desktop organized and useful. It should also be easy on the eyes. To that
end, developers around the world have written literally hundreds of program
applications, some free and some not, that accomplish a range of productiv-
ity and organizational tasks and look good, too.
If you search around the Internet, you can find clocks, alarms, newsreaders,
icon-makers, calendars, and personal information managers. You can even
find several programs that create multiple virtual desktops. Because I don’t
like to clutter my desktop (or my hard drive) with a bunch of doodads, I don’t
grab every gadget that comes down the pike, but there are a couple I’ve
found useful. (The fact that they’re free doesn’t hurt, either.)
Stickies
I’ve noticed a lot of people frame their computer monitors with colorful little
sticky notes. These little reminders are really handy because, besides making
one look very busy and efficient, they serve as a kind of external storage
device for the brain. Because, however, I don’t work in a traditional office and
I don’t use a desktop computer, I’ve always felt somewhat left out.
Now, I’m not really all that interested in looking busy or efficient, but the
value of a deferred external memory system isn’t lost on me at all — espe-
cially because I’ve been told I’m a fountain of useless information. Whether
that’s true or not, I know that given the choice between remembering the
name of King Henry VIII’s third wife or my wife’s dental appointment, it seems
I can instantly remember Jane Seymour (not Dr. Quinn), while the dental
appointment takes me by surprise every time.
Enter a tiny little desktop utility called Stickies. This free program, created by
Zhorn Software, allows you to put digital sticky notes all over your desktop.
You can remind yourself of anything and everything. You can jot down phone
numbers, addresses, names, appointments; you name it, and you can put it
on a Stickies digital note. In addition to that, you can tell the note to go to
sleep for a while and wake up whenever you want it to. You could even have
it wake up month after month or year after year, reminding you to pay a bill
or send a card. And, if you don’t want the notes plastered all over the place,
you can choose to hide them all.
If this sounds like a little gem you’d like to add to your arsenal of desktop
tools, you can find it freely available at www.zhornsoftware.co.uk. To
keep your Stickies looking fresh and interesting, you can also download your
choice of several different skins.
338
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Another free tool available from Zhorn, called Stickies Store, allows you to file
away Stickies that have outlived their usefulness, but, for whatever reason,
you want to keep. By the way, if you download the Stickies Store, you’ll notice
it’s a zipped folder. The installation instructions are included in the folder, so
all you need to do is read the instructions and extract the .exe and .chm
files to the same program folder in which the Stickies program files reside.
Desktop Sidebar
Okay, I hear you asking: What in the world is a desktop sidebar? Well, one of
the many features available with Vista (the newest Windows operating
system) is a desktop panel loaded with a bunch of gadgets. Some access the
Web and provide news headlines, weather updates, online slide shows, or
stock prices; other gadgets give you easy access to your e-mail, contacts, cal-
endar, or media player. Sounds pretty good, eh? Well, you don’t have to wait
for Windows Vista; you can have all that now — for no cost. Figure 18-1 gives
you a look at a few views available.
Each panel, when the cursor hovers over it, displays details off to the side; if
you right-click it, each panel is (to various extents) customizable. You can
also undock panels and float them into any position on your desktop that you
choose. A few of the panels available are
 Clocks: A number of clock styles are available within the hundreds of
skins. Almost every skin gives you the option of a digital or analog clock.
In most of the skins, I prefer the analog version even though it does take
up a bit more space. Hovering over the clock usually brings up a calen-
dar and (if you want) the time in various cities around the world.
 Weather: The weather panels are usually driven by The Weather
Channel, and by entering a city name or Zip code, you can get local
weather from anywhere in the world. It doesn’t update itself as often as
I’d like, but a quick right-click on the panel offers the option to refresh.
 Performance Monitor: This panel is one of the main reasons I installed
the sidebar. You can monitor a number of areas within your computer. If,
for example, your CPU monitor suddenly jumps, it might be an indica-
tion that someone’s hacked into your system or some form of malware
has found a new home on your hard drive.
 Newsroom: I like the news — always have, always will. With this panel,
you can monitor headlines from a number of different news sources, and
you can customize it with RSS feeds or blogs.
All these panels are standard issue when you choose to install the sidebar,
but there are more than 50 others — some variations and some unique —
available now, and developers are working on more all the time.
339
Chapter 18: Ten Fantastic Free Applications

Slideshow is one of the standard-issue panels in Desktop Sidebar. You can use
all kinds of photos; I’ve chosen to display Webcam views from around the
world. I’ve got regularly updating photos ranging from Old Faithful to a pen-
guin-research station in Antarctica. To save a webcam to Desktop Sidebar,
just find the view you want, right-click it, choose Properties, and copy the
Address. Open Panel Properties in the Slideshow panel, choose to Add a URL,
configure the refresh time, click OK a couple of times, and you’re done!
Now, I happen to really like the Desktop Sidebar, but you might also be inter-
ested to know that a similar product’s available from TGT Soft called
SpyderBar. It’s also free, and, although it looks and operates much like
Desktop Sidebar, it’s not exactly the same, so you might want to check it out.
Another possibility for desktop enhancement is found at the Yahoo! Web site.
During the summer of 2005, Yahoo! bought out Pixoria so they could get their
hands on Konfabulator and their Widgets. What are Widgets? A few examples
Figure 18-1:
The three

the skins,
panels, and

340
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

include alarm clocks, countdown clocks, calculators, performance monitors,
day planners, news feeds, radio tuners, and weather stations. For the very
paranoid among you, there’s even a Werewolf Monitor that shows you the
phases of the moon. You can place these Widgets anywhere on the desktop
and configure them in a number of ways.
When Yahoo! purchased Konfabulator, they immediately ceased charging a
fee. Widgets, once they were free, became instantly appealing to me. After
downloading the Widget Engine from Yahoo!, you can choose from literally
thousands of Widgets that can perform an incredible range of tasks. I use
these more as an enhancement to the Desktop Sidebar than a replacement,
but it’s your computer, so you choose.
These program applications and their optional features can be freely down-
loaded at

Monitoring Your Computer
I’m normally pretty curious about stuff. I like to know just what it is, for exam-
ple, that my computer’s doing. Not that I understand all (or even most) of it. 
I don’t, but that doesn’t mean I don’t like to snoop through the inner work-
ings. I’ve found a couple of utilities that not only tell me considerably more
than I ever thought I could find out about what my computer’s doing, but also
help me — slowly, very slowly — discover more about the way it does it.
The first utility I tell you about takes a snapshot of everything going on in
your computer and generates a complete — and I really mean complete —
report, detailing everything that’s going on in there. The second utility is 
similar — it identifies the processes, indicating what’s in use and how much
of the available resources are being allocated to it — but it continually
updates itself, giving you a real-time look at what’s happening.
LookInMyPC
Created by Solid Oak Software, this little utility was recommended to me by a
tech-support staffer. She told me that if I’d had this utility installed, I’d be
able to take a snapshot of the internal workings of my computer, save it as a
file, and e-mail it to her. She’d then be able to go through it and figure out
exactly what was fouling up the works.
341
Chapter 18: Ten Fantastic Free Applications

Of course, at that particular moment, I didn’t have LookInMyPC loaded on my
laptop, so I was out of luck. Because I am, however, one who believes in learn-
ing from my mistakes, I downloaded a copy of LookInMyPC just in case I ever
needed it again. Every once in a while, especially if things seem a little slug-
gish or if the system monitors I use in Desktop Sidebar seem to be indicating
something’s happening, I run the utility and create a report.
A few of the hundreds of items you find by scanning a typical report include
 Windows version: You see the exact version of Windows installed on
your computer, including build and serial numbers.
 Hard-drive information: The make and model number are identified
along with the total capacity, number of partitions, and current status.
 Installed hotfixes: Creates a detailed list of all the Windows updates and
hotfixes that have been installed on your computer. Each link opens the
Microsoft Knowledge Base article for that particular fix.
 Installed programs: Although only registered programs are listed (mean-
ing that malicious applications are unlikely to be represented), you can
find out about some very obscure programs by following the links.
 Installed services: Creates a detailed list of all the programs running in
the background. You can see the full path as well as their current status.
The report includes so much information concerning the hardware installed
that it’s probably a good idea to generate and print a report just so you have
that information at your fingertips if you ever need it.
You can download a copy of your own at www.lookinmypc.com.
Process Explorer
Rather than give you a snapshot of the processes currently running in your
computer, Process Explorer gives you a dynamic view. Process Explorer is a
tremendously handy tool that’s used by many professionals to troubleshoot
computer problems. If you play around with the Process Explorer buttons
and options a little bit, you can find out more about your computer than you
ever thought possible.
Every process or application running on your computer, whether it’s hidden
or not, is shown in the upper window. If you click any item, the lower window
displays information about that item’s component. If you right-click an item,
as shown in Figure 18-2, you can choose to display the Properties dialog box,
kill or suspend the process, or click Google to open a browser window with
search results related to the process name — if you just don’t know what the
item is.
342
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Downloading and using Process Explorer is a little different from how it is for
most program applications you’re probably familiar with. When you visit the
Sysinternals Web site (www.sysinternals.com) to find Process Explorer,
you navigate to the Processes and Threads page. Scroll down that page until
you find Process Explorer (followed by a version number), and click the link.
The page that opens has a whole bunch of information (some important and
some not-so-important) relating to Process Explorer. Scroll to the bottom of
the page and click the link that lists your operating system. The download is
a ZIP folder containing the help file, the README text, and the executable
application. If you download the folder to your desktop or My Documents,
you don’t need to extract the files. You can simply open the folder and
double-click the file you want to open. It’s a good idea to read through the
help file (procexp.chm) once before you begin working with the application.
Office Productivity Applications
Whether you need a whole suite of office applications or just a good word
processor, you can get what you need without forking over a huge wad of
cash. As a matter of fact, you can get what you need for no cost whatsoever,

Both of these products are the result of open source projects that bring a
wide variety of people and corporations together into a development commu-
nity. This method of software development, wherein the source code is avail-
able to everyone and everyone can contribute, has been proven, time and
again, to be both efficient and innovative. And, because many freely con-
tribute, it’s generally freely available.
When you visit these sites, you’ll probably notice links to pages where dona-
tions of time, talent, or money are accepted. It’s not required, and you’re not
a bad person if you don’t contribute; but if you like the software, you might
consider supporting, in some small way, to the well-being of the communities
developing the software.
AbiWord
Microsoft Word 2003 is (at least in my opinion) the absolute best word
processor available. It’s unquestionably the standard by which all others are
judged, and its lofty position is reflected in the equally lofty price tag. There
is, however, a close runner-up that does nearly everything MS Word does —
and has the added attraction of being absolutely free.
AbiWord can read and write to all the current document types, including
Microsoft Word and Word Perfect, and because it has a user interface very
similar to both of those, it’s very easy to learn and use. Like any high-end
processor, AbiWord allows you to embed images, format tables, and create
bulleted or numbered lists — you can even create HTML Web pages.
Another nice thing about AbiWord is its small size. It doesn’t take up a lot of
space on your hard drive, and places fewer demands on memory resources
when it’s in use. When you download AbiWord, you get the basic word
processor; then, after you install the basic program, you can go back and
download any plug-in applications you might want.
If you select the check boxes next to Associate .doc with AbiWord and
Associate .rtf with AbiWord during the installation process, any MS Word 
documents you have currently saved — as well as any Rich Text Format 
documents — are forever after displayed as AbiWord documents. However,
you don’t need to select those check boxes in order to save AbiWord docu-
ments as .doc or .rtf files.
AbiWord is produced by AbiSource and can be downloaded from their site,
located on the World Wide Web at www.abisource.com. The plug-ins must
be downloaded and installed separately from — and after — the basic pro-
gram application.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 

OpenOffice
Do you need a complete office suite, but for some obscure reason, you don’t
feel like spending $400 or more? Well, here’s the solution to your problem. In
October of 2000, OpenOffice.org opened to the public the source code for
StarOffice by Sun Microsystems. Since that time, thousands of contributors
have helped develop a world-class, office productivity suite.
Open Office is compatible with all the major office productivity suites and
includes the following components:
 Word processor: Known as Writer, this word processor is quite good. 
I like AbiWord a bit better, but if you only want one, this does the job.
 Spreadsheet program: I’ve always found Excel a bit daunting. Calc, as
the spreadsheet component is known, is somewhat easier to use. The
Scenario Manager lets me do a lot of hypothetical forecasting; I like that.
 Presentation creator: Impress is the OpenOffice answer to PowerPoint,
and it does a remarkable job. You can create 3-D or Flash presentations,
and you can save your work in PowerPoint format.
 Graphics tools: You can import graphics from common formats or use
Draw to create your own. You can easily create charts and diagrams, and
the 3-D controller helps to give depth to your designs.
 Database program: I have to admit, I’ve never created a database, but if
you want (or need) to do so, you can accomplish your goal with Base.
 Equation program: Complex equations can be rendered within Math for
use in text documents. Do I have a need for this? No. Do you? Well, if you
do, this is the tool for you. The equations can be inserted into Writer,
Calc, or Impress. If they could then be printed on coffee-shop napkins,
my dad would’ve loved this tool.
OpenOffice, commonly referred to as OOo, is available from OpenOffice.org
at, appropriately enough, www.openoffice.org. You can find complete
setup and installation instructions there, linked from the download page.
Viewing Your Destination from Space
Mapping software combined with GPS can easily get you to your destination,
but it’s less capable of showing you what the area surrounding your destina-
tion might look like. It certainly would be nice if you could get a preview,
wouldn’t it? Just think, by getting a look at the roads leading into your pick-
up or delivery location, you might be able to anticipate difficult turns or
intersections. Or you might be able to see, ahead of time, whether an on-
ramp is accessed from the right or left lane.
345
Chapter 18: Ten Fantastic Free Applications

Likewise, if you’re traveling to a new RV park or campground, it’d be nice to
get a bird’s-eye view of the layout and terrain, as well as the surroundings,
wouldn’t it? Well, now you can. A couple of free applications give you access
to satellite imagery.
Google Earth
Rarely have I found something I thought was as flat-out great as Google Earth.
With an Internet connection and Google Earth, you can virtually fly to nearly
every city in the U.S. and get a pretty good view of buildings, parking lots,
intersections, roads, highways, parks, campgrounds, and a whole bunch of
other stuff. Just enter an address or intersection into the text field of the
search tool, click the search icon, and you’re off.
Once you get a look at your chosen location, you can zoom in for a closer
view or zoom out to get some perspective. Another nice feature is the ability
to tilt the view down by using the controls to the right of the directional but-
tons. In this view, you can actually feel like you’re flying over an area. By
using the different layers, you can add names and labels for roads, busi-
nesses, hospitals, pharmacies, fire stations, and a whole lot more. In some
cases, mostly in the larger cities, you can even get 3-D views of the buildings.
As great as Google Earth is, however, it’s far from perfect. Some smaller
towns are a blur, and the satellite images are up to three years old. Still, even
three-year-old images can give you a good idea of what to expect. Most larger
towns are well covered, as are many smaller and more remote locations.
The Google Earth home page is located at http://earth.google.com, and
you can find links there for the download page, as well as pages that’ll help
you get the most out of Google Earth. You can do a lot with this program, so
don’t expect to have total mastery of it in an hour or two.
World Wind
World Wind is one of the most powerful programs available on the Internet
today. That it’s free just amazes me. World Wind was developed by NASA, so
as you might imagine, it’s not quite as user-friendly as Google Earth. As a
matter of fact, there’s little doubt that an entire book could be written cover-
ing just this application. But don’t let that scare you out of downloading
World Wind. There’s lots of information available to help you get proficient
with the program, and just because it was developed by actual rocket scien-
tists doesn’t mean you have to be one to use and enjoy World Wind.
346
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

World Wind is available for download from NASA at http://worldwind.
arc.nasa.gov, and some invaluable information about how it works and
ways to use it is available from World Wind Central at www.worldwind
central.com/wiki/Main_Page.
Make sure you take the Walkthrough Tour when you visit World Wind Central.
It’ll give you a good idea of what you can do right away with the program, and
you can find out about add-on and plug-in programs that can further enhance
your enjoyment of World Wind.
Making Music
It took me awhile, but after I realized what my laptop was capable of, I started
using it in ways I’d never imagined I might. For example, I started ripping my
CD collection onto the hard drive, and after reading an article in a magazine, 
I decided to try transferring my wife’s vinyl LP collection onto CDs. In both
cases, I found free software to help me do the job.
Audiograbber
I download a lot of music from places like MSN Music, iTunes, and others, but
I also like to rip CDs. I can then transfer all this music to an MP3 player or
just listen to it while I’m surfing the Web. When I first began loading my CD
collection onto my hard drive, I noticed a distinct difference in the quality of
the sound. The music I downloaded seemed to sound somewhat better than
the music I ripped from my CDs, and my CDs sounded better on my stereo.
After doing a little research, I found that the problem might be due to media
player software, which I used to copy CDs to my hard drive, using the sound
card as a translator. I just figured I was going to have to accept this difference
in sound quality, but then I stumbled across Audiograbber.
Because Audiograbber copies a CD digitally and directly, you can make a per-
fect digital audio copy. Even though this utility is very versatile and includes
a lot of features, it’s relatively easy to use, takes up very little space on your
hard drive, and makes very little demand on resources when in use.
Audiograbber is available free of charge, and you can obtain it by pointing
your browser to www.audiograbber.com-us.net.
After downloading Audiograbber, take advantage of the Guide for Newbies
and the Guided Tour pages found on the Audiograbber Web site. Both of
these guides will provide a solid foundation for using the utility. Another
great resource for Audiograbber info is Tom’s Audioguides, located on the
Web at http://ripping.v33.org/.

Chapter 18: Ten Fantastic Free Applications

Audacity
After reading an article in Popular Mechanics, I decided I’d try my hand at
transferring my wife’s aging LP collection onto CD. The advantages of digitiz-
ing our vinyl collection seemed obvious, so I began to collect the pieces and
parts necessary to do the job. After spending a couple hundred bucks on the
hardware — mainly due to the fact that the old turntable just wasn’t up to the
job — I was desperate for a free software solution.
Buried in the article was a reference to Audacity, so I jumped at the opportu-
nity to save a few bucks. The only thing missing in the program — which only
makes its presence felt when you want to export your MP3s — is the LAME
MP3 encoder. Audacity offers a host of other features as well; you can find
out about them by visiting their Web site at http://audacity.source
forge.net. The Help page includes links to the FAQs, Documentation, and
Tutorials. Once you make it through those sections, you’ll have a good work-
ing knowledge of the program.
If, like me, you’re interested in converting your vinyl collection into a 
CD collection, you can read the article that sparked my interest by visiting
www.popularmechanics.com/technology/audio/1552397.html and
reading the “Vinyl to Go-Go” article.
348
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Downloading and installing 
the LAME MP3 encoder
With most MP3 utilities — at least the free 
ones — it’s necessary to download and install
an MP3 encoder. The one most often recom-
mended is the LAME encoder, and you can find
it widely available on the Web by searching the
term “LAME MP3 encoder.” A couple sites I can
recommend to download from are
 Free-codecs.com: The link for the LAME
encoder is www.free-codecs.com/
download/Lame_Encoder.htm.
 Softpedia: The encoder can be found 
here 
www.softpedia.com/get/
Multimedia/Audio/Audio-CD-
Rippers-Encoders/LAME-MP3-
Encoder.shtml.
This download is in the form of a ZIP folder, so I
suggest you download it to your desktop. (This
just seems to work best for me.) Once the
folder’s finished downloading, you can open it
with WinZip or the Windows XP utility and
extract the contents to the location, such as
C:\Program Files\audiograbber, at
which the Audiograbber or any other MP3 util-
ity resides.
