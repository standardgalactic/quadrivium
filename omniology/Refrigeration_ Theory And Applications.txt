Introduction
1	 Introduction
1.1	
Importance of Refrigeration
For most people, certainly in the developed world, the word ‘refrigeration’ would probably evoke the 
image of a white or metallic-grey device in their homes which is used to keep food and beverages cool. 
These devices are generally reliable and low-maintenance and have a familiar, comforting quality, but 
do not solicit much thought or attention. However, refrigeration goes far beyond the domestic setting, 
or the supermarket or grocery store where ‘fridges’ are most commonly seen by the average person. The 
reality is that societies in the developed world depend on refrigeration to the point where it would be 
no exaggeration to say that many lives would be lost if all mechanical refrigerators were suddenly to fail.
In addition to keeping beer chilled, and ice cream frozen, refrigeration is vital for food supply and 
security, particularly for countries who import the majority of their food (more than 80% in some 
instances). Nature does not work according to humanity’s schedule; many fruits and vegetables are 
produced seasonally and refrigeration technology provides us with the ability to store perishable produce 
in order to balance the irregular supply with the much more steady demand. A number of countries 
which are significant food exporters (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, Chile and Argentina) are geographically 
isolated from the major food importers (particularly in Europe) and refrigeration provides the means 
for transporting foods large distances by the relatively slow mode of sea transport. Even within national 
borders, refrigerated transport is important since, in highly urbanised countries at least, much of the 
food produced in rural areas is destined to be consumed in the cities. 
Estimates by the International Institute of Refrigeration suggest that on average 25% of food produced 
is wasted, due to spoilage during transportation and storage, and much of this (particularly in the 
Developing World) could be prevented by refrigeration. In fact there is a correlation between the number 
of refrigeration units per capita and rates of malnutrition. As we head further into the 21st Century, 
refrigeration is becoming more and more crucial to achieving the goal of feeding a growing population 
in a world where we have run out of room to expand our crops and pastures.
But the importance of refrigeration is not limited to food. Think of a typical hospital: many vaccines, 
anaesthetics, blood plasma and other forms of medication need to be kept refrigerated; some at 
temperatures significantly lower than that at which most food is stored. Although it has a different name, 
‘air conditioning’ is mostly the same process as refrigeration. And it is not just human comfort that is at 
issue – in the 21st century air-conditioning is vital for keeping large computers and data-centres (i.e. file 
server banks) producing megawatts of heat, at operable temperatures. Modern society is so dependent 
on computers that failure in the air conditioning systems that cool the electronic systems that keep all 
our records, and control so much of the processes we rely on in everyday life, could be catastrophic.

Introduction
And then there is cryogenics – the science of low temperatures. At low temperatures all sorts of interesting 
phenomena occur. CERN’s Large Hadron Collider requires temperatures to be low in order for their 
experiments to be run. Refrigeration provides key support in the pursuit of knowledge about our universe 
and the workings of nature that we are yet to fully comprehend.
This picture of refrigeration has been painted with broad brush-strokes, but hopefully you will see that 
refrigeration goes beyond the mundane and commonplace role that is associated with the humble fridge, 
and that it truly is vital technology for our health, longevity and well-being in the modern age. So how 
did we get to the point where we rely on refrigeration so much? To answer, that question let us look very 
briefly at the development of refrigeration from ancient times. Subsequently we will adopt a definition 
of refrigeration as it is used in this book.
1.2	
A Brief History of Refrigeration
It is difficult to put a date on the first ever usage of a cold environment to preserve food, but there is 
evidence to suggest that the practice is many thousands of years old. Caves appear to have been used to 
store food (particularly the hunter’s animal prey) in primitive times, and that people in warmer climates 
were aware that by climbing high hills or mountains the air would be cooler and could be used for food 
storage. A Chinese poem of 1100 BC mentions a house where ice was stored, specifically for domestic 
use. In the 5th Century BC the Greek Protagoras reported that the Egyptians were capable of producing 
ice by placing water on their roofs when there was a clear night sky. Several hundred years later the 
Roman Emperor Nero Claudius is reported to have sent slaves to the mountains to fetch snow to be 
used specifically for cooling fruit drinks.
As time progressed, ice and snow began to be harvested and traded. During the time of the Roman 
Empire, citizens of Rome were supplied with ice from the Apennine Mountains. Caravans of camels 
were used to transport snow from the hills of Lebanon to the Caliphs in Baghdad and Damascus. By 
the 19th Century the trade in natural ice was intercontinental – in 1899 half a million tonnes of natural 
ice was imported from the United States and Norway to Great Britain.
But there is also clear evidence that these passive means of keeping food cool were not the only ones 
employed. An Egyptian frieze dated from some 5000 years ago depicts a man waving a fan in front of 
an earthenware jar, which, it is thought (with support from other sources), would have been filled with 
water in order to achieve cooling by evaporation. Later on, but possibly as early as the 4th Century AD 
in India people noticed that certain salts, such as sodium nitrate, when added to water caused cooling 
effects. By the 16th Century it was well-known that adding these salts to ice would result in temperatures 
that were lower than that of the ice or snow on its own. It was in 1550 that the first use of the expression 
‘to refrigerate’ (essentially to ‘make fresh’) appears to have been used by Blas Villafranca, who published 
a text on the subject.

Introduction
However, the real leap forward in terms of refrigeration technology came with the development of 
mechanical refrigeration during the 18th and 19th Centuries, which occurred largely as part of the movement 
to understand heat engines and the wider science of thermodynamics. People began to design devices 
operating in cycles using a working fluid, such as ammonia, to achieve cooling. Names such as Carrier 
and von Linde (major players in the development of refrigeration) are familiar to many today as brand 
names on modern refrigeration equipment. The 20th Century saw an explosion in the uptake of mechanical 
refrigeration, thanks to mass production and the progress in technology (interestingly CFC refrigerants, 
which until the end of last century were regarded as near perfect refrigerants, are often credited with a 
significant role in this ‘explosion’). The result, of course, is that refrigerators, air conditioners and heat 
pumps are common features in homes, shops, offices, hotels and other buildings all around the world.
1.3	
Scope and Outline of this Book
This book is concerned with the active, mechanical production of ‘cold’ (note that we don’t really have an 
antonym for ‘heat’ in the English language). Therefore, when the term refrigeration is used, it is not meant 
to include the use of naturally occurring ‘cold’ from the environment. As a general term, refrigeration also 
includes air-conditioning technology; however, due to its similarity, heat pump technology will also be 
covered. The majority of the content of the book is concerned with devices based on the vapour compression 
cycle, since it is this technology that the vast majority of refrigerators, air conditioners and heat pumps 
employ. However, other techniques will also be covered, albeit in less detail (see Chapter 5 in particular).
The book is split into two parts. Part 1 deals with the underlying physics associated with refrigeration 
technology (thermodynamics and heat transfer in particular). Part 2 deals with the applications of 
refrigeration technology, in the fields of preservation (of biological material), human comfort and 
cryogenics.
The book is intended for use as a text for a third or fourth year elective paper (or possibly a taught 
Masters paper) for engineering students. Prior knowledge of (or at least exposure to) thermodynamics 
and heat transfer is assumed; however, only basic theory is covered, and some students may be capable 
of understanding the content without significant prior knowledge.

Thermodynamics
2	 Thermodynamics
2.1	
Definitions
It is assumed that the reader of this text is familiar with the definitions and concepts of pressure, 
temperature, enthalpy, entropy, heat and work (if not the reader is directed to Cengel & Boles 2007). 
However it is worth revising some of the important concepts of Classical Thermodynamics.
2.1.1	
System and Surroundings
In classical thermodynamics we are typically interested in changes in, and exchanges of, energy and 
mass between certain bodies (e.g. a tank of water or quantity of gas etc.). To clarify discussions, we call 
the particular body of interest (or region of space) the system. The system is often (but not by necessity) 
contained within some physical boundary. Where the boundary of the system is such that matter (mass) 
is allowed to enter or leave the system, it is said to be an open system. Where the boundary of the system 
is such that mass is not allowed to enter or leave the system, but work and/or heat are allowed to be 
transferred across the boundary, the system is said to be a closed system. In the unusual case that the 
boundary of the system is such that neither mass nor energy (in the form of heat or work) is allowed to 
cross the boundary, the system is said to be an isolated system.
The distinction between open and closed systems is important since thermodynamic analyses of closed 
systems tend to be simpler, by virtue of the fact that we do not have to consider the changes in energy of 
a system brought about simply by the transfer of mass with its intrinsic energy into or out of the system. 
This is the case with the refrigerant in a refrigerator or heat pump (provided there are no leaks), and 
hence we only need to consider work and heat transfer effects.
Everything outside the system is known as the surroundings. There can be more than one system but 
typically we only talk about one ‘surroundings’. Note that the surroundings of a system of interest may 
simply be one or more other system(s) in their own right. Typically we are interested in transfers between 
the system and its surroundings. The system and surroundings combined make up what is referred to 
as the universe (this latter definition is important when considering entropy changes).
2.1.2	
Equilibrium
In classical thermodynamics equilibrium is a vital concept, because changes are expressed in terms of an 
initial state and a final state, but changes are not considered with respect to time. (i.e. there is no concern 
for rates of change with respect to time). In order for a system to be at equilibrium, all forces (or, more 
generally, drivers of change) acting on it need to be balanced such that there is no net change to any of 
the system’s state variables with time.

2.1.3	
State variables and path-dependent variables
Another important concept in classical thermodynamics is the concept of a state variable. To illustrate 
this concept, consider climbing the hill, as depicted in Figure 2.1.

Thermodynamics
There may be a number of different trails you could follow to climb the hill, which will affect the distance 
that you travel; however, regardless of which path you take, your change in altitude (vertical displacement) 
depends only on your initial and final altitudes. In this example, the distance travelled is a path-dependent 
variable, whereas altitude is a state variable. In thermodynamics examples of path-dependent variables 
include heat and work, while examples of state variables include temperature, pressure, specific enthalpy, 
and specific entropy. The name ‘state’ refers to the fact that state variables characterise or describe the 
physical state (i.e. condition) of the system. 
2.1.4	
Gibbs Phase Rule
You should be familiar with Gibb’s Phase Rule which allows us to determine the number of independent, 
intensive variables that need to be known in order for the system’s state to be specified completely:
	
2
+
−
=
N
C
F

(2.1)
Where: F is the number of degrees of freedom (i.e. the number of variables that need to be specified), 
C is the number of chemical components in the system and N is the number of phases in the system.
Many common refrigerants are essentially pure chemical species (i.e. C = 1). If phase change is occurring 
then two phases are in equilibrium with each other (i.e. N = 2) and hence F = 1. That is, when two species 
are in equilibrium (e.g. a liquid and vapour) there is only one degree of freedom, which means that if 
we specify one intensive state variable (e.g. temperature), then all the other intensive state variables (e.g. 
pressure, specific enthalpy, specific entropy) are fixed. If, however, only the liquid or vapour phases are 
present in the system, then we have N = 1 and F = 2, and hence we need to specify two intensive state 
variables before all the others are fixed. This information will be useful when we analyse the performance 
of different refrigeration cycles later in the chapter.
2.1.5	
Reversibility and Irreversibility
Reversibility is yet another important concept in thermodynamics. In order for a process to be 
thermodynamically reversible, the following criteria must be met:
1.	 The system must be only infinitesimally removed from equilibrium at any stage of the 
process
2.	 The process must be able to be reversed at any stage of the process without leaving any 
impact on the surroundings (note that this second criterion is implied by the first)
Thermodynamic reversibility is more specific than simply referring to a process for with the opposite 
(or reverse) process is possible. Let’s illustrate from an every-day example. Consider the vertical window 
as depicted in Figure 2.2.

Refrigeration: Theory And Applications
15 
Thermodynamics
Figure 2.2: Closing a vertical window – irreversibly
The window is originally in its fully open position, held in place by the latch. If the latch is turned, 
releasing the window, it will lower itself spontaneously (probably with quite a crash!). We do not need 
to expend any energy in closing the window (other than turning the latch); however, we will need to do 
quite a lot of work to open the window (i.e. to return it to its original state).
Now consider the vertical window depicted in Figure 2.3. This time there are counterweights for the 
window. If it is originally in its fully open position, when we turn the latch nothing will happen; the 
window will not close itself spontaneously. In order for the window to be closed we will need to apply 
a small downward force (to overcome friction). We can halt the process halfway, and leave the window 
half open. We can return the window to its original position simply be applying a small upward force. 
When the window is fully closed, returning it to its fully open position requires much less work than 
the window without counterweights.

Thermodynamics
The window example illustrates that reversible processes are not spontaneous and therefore spontaneous 
processes are necessarily irreversible. Although we do not provide the proof here, thermodynamically 
reversible processes are the most energy efficient processes possible (returning to the window illustration – 
in principle we could open the counter-weighted window with a little finger, whereas the un-weighted 
window would require both hands with a significant force). True thermodynamic reversibility cannot 
be attained by any real-life processes due to friction and similar factors; however, a number of real life 
processes approximate reversibility. Examples include equilibrium chemical reactions, isothermal heat 
transfer (e.g. involving phase change), and some compression processes (think of a compressing or 
expanding a gas by adding or removing a grain to/from a pile of sand used as the weight for the piston 
doing the compressing).
2.2	
The First Law of Thermodynamics
You should be familiar with the famous First Law of thermodynamics, which states that energy is not 
created or destroyed by any process; rather its form is changed. Of practical value to engineers and 
scientists is the mathematical expression of this statement, shown below for a closed system at rest:

Thermodynamics
(Note that the signs of Q and W in Eq. (2.2) depend on convention, but the important point to bear in 
mind is that work done on the system and heat transferred to it will increase U, and vice versa for work 
done by the system and heat transferred from it).
Most refrigeration and heat pump processes operate in a cyclic manner, periodically returning the 
refrigerant to a given state. We can, therefore, say that over the cycle the net change in internal energy 
is zero, i.e.:
	
0
=
∆∫
cycle
U

(2.3)
and therefore the first law for a closed, cyclic process can be written:
	
net

W
Q
=

(2.4)
In refrigeration and heat pump cycles work is only performed during one stage of the cycle, while heat is 
transferred during two stages, one at a low temperature and one at a high temperature (the temperatures 
are ‘high’ and ‘low’ relative to each other, rather than in absolute terms). Hence the form of the First 
Law that will be most useful for analysing refrigeration or heat pump cycles is:
	
C
H
Q
Q
W
−

(2.5)
where W is work done on the refrigerant, and the subscripts H and C refer to the hot (high) and cold 
(low) temperature heat transfer processes respectively.
2.3	
The Second Law of Thermodynamics
2.3.1	
Statements of the Second Law
The Second Law of Thermodynamics is perhaps slightly more abstract and harder to grasp than the First 
Law. To paraphrase Rudolf Clausius (1822 to 1888), the Second Law states that:
It is impossible to construct a device operating in cyclic fashion whose sole purpose is to transfer 
heat from a low temperature reservoir to a higher temperature reservoir.
At face value this statement might appear to suggest that refrigeration (which is a process having the net 
effect of transferring heat from a low temperature to a higher temperature) is a physical impossibility – 
more on this point later.

To get a mathematical expression of the Second Law, first we need to recall the definition of entropy (as 
used in classical thermodynamics) courtesy of Clausius:

Mathematically, the Second Law can be written as:

S

(2.7)
We can state Eq. (2.7) verbally by saying that for any process the entropy of the universe can only increase, 
or in the limiting case (reversible processes) can remain unchanged. The Second Law states that the 
entropy of the universe can never decrease. So how do we reconcile Eq. (2.7) with Claudius’s statement? 
To answer this question, refer to Figure 2.4:

Figure 2.4: Heat flow between hot and cold reservoirs
A quantity of heat Q is transferred between the thermal reservoir at temperature TH and another thermal 
reservoir at temperature TC where TH > TC (Note that a thermal reservoir is a large thermal mass at an 
essentially uniform temperature such that adding or removing quantities of heat will have a negligible 
impact on the reservoir’s temperature. Examples of thermal reservoirs include the atmosphere or large 
bodies of water such as lakes and seas).
If the heat is transferred from the high temperature reservoir to the low temperature reservoir, the 
entropy change for the high temperature reservoir (DSH) is given by:
	
H

Thermodynamics
Since TH > TC, DSH < DSC , and DSuniverse will be greater than 0, and therefore this process is allowable 
according to Eq. 2.7. By contrast, the reverse process is not permissible, which is where we get the 
statement that “heat only flows from hot to cold”, and demonstrates that Clausius’s statement of the 
Second Law is a necessary consequence of Eq. (2.7).
So then how can refrigeration be possible, if heat cannot flow from cold to hot? The answer is because 
the temperature of a body of mass can be raised or lowered without the transfer of heat, and this is 
how refrigeration works. There are a number of ways in which this can be achieved (and some of these 
will be discussed in Chapter 5); however, the vast majority of refrigeration and heat pump cycles in use 
today achieve the increase of temperature of the refrigerant by compressing it and the reduction of its 
temperature by expanding it adiabatically (thanks to the Joule-Thomson effect).
2.3.2	
The Reversed Carnot Cycle and the COP
One of the key theories in the elucidation of the Second Law, was the Carnot Cycle. The Carnot Cycle 
is an ideal heat engine which operates according to four reversible processes: adiabatic expansion, 
isothermal compression, adiabatic compression, and isothermal expansion. During the first process work 
is produced by the system, during the second heat is absorbed by the system, during the third work is 
done on the system, and during the fourth heat is rejected by the system.

Since the cycle involves only reversible processes, any Carnot engine should be able to be operated in 
reverse as a heat pump or refrigerator, in which case the four processes would be adiabatic expansion, 
isothermal expansion, adiabatic compression and isothermal compression. The reversed Carnot cycle is 
illustrated on a temperature versus entropy (TS) plot shown in Figure 2.5:

In order to assess the performance of the reversed Carnot cycle we introduce the coefficient of performance 
(COP). For a refrigerator, where we are interested in removing heat at a low temperature the COP is 
defined as:

(The COP is essentially the efficiency of the refrigeration or heat pump cycle; however, because ‘efficiencies’ 
are generally defined such that they have values between 0 and 1, and COP values are usually greater 
than 1, traditionally the more cumbersome term COP has been used to keep the purists happy).
Note that by substituting Eqs. (2.13 and 2.15 into Eq. 2.16) we can obtain simple expressions for the 
COPs of reversed Carnot cycles:

Because the reversed Carnot cycle only employs reversible processes, it is the most efficient cycle possible 
(i.e. has the highest COP). Therefore the COPs calculated for Carnot cycle provide benchmarks for real 
refrigeration and heat pump cycles to be compared against.
By examining Eqs. (2.18) and (2.19) we see that the performance of the cycle is increased as we increase 
the target temperature (TC for a refrigerator, TH for a heat pump) and as we decrease the difference 
between the high and low temperatures. While these conclusions were derived for the idealised Carnot 
cycle, the conclusion is generally applicable for real refrigeration and heat pump cycles.
It is also worth noting that:

Hence a device (e.g. the invertible domestic heat pump described in Chapter 8) will perform better as 
a heat pump than as a refrigerator, when operating between any two given temperatures. The reason 
for this is that the ‘waste product’ of the compression process is heat (essentially equal to W), which is 
included in QH, but not in QC.

Phase diagrams and refrigerant properties
The reversed Carnot cycle involves adiabatic and isothermal compressions and expansions. Obviously 
there needs to be some substance that is expanded or compressed, and this substance is known as the 
working fluid, or, in the case of refrigeration specifically, the refrigerant. The desirable attributes of a 
refrigerant will be discussed in Chapter 4.

Thermodynamics
State variables are physical attributes of a substance, and since we can relate thermodynamic processes 
(including refrigeration and heat pump cycles) to changes in state variables, we need to have access to 
the thermodynamic data of the refrigerant in order to select an appropriate refrigerant for a given task, 
and to perform preliminary calculations.
The Gibbs Phase Rule tells us that if we have a pure substance we need to specify at most 2 state variables, 
in order for the remaining variables to be fixed. However, simply knowing the number of variables that 
need to be specified does not tell us what the mathematical dependencies of the remaining state variables 
are. Thankfully a lot of work has been performed over the years to measure, correlate and model these 
dependencies for a large number of working fluids. The data may then be tabulated or plotted on a 
chart (or, these days, entered into an electronic database). A variety of sources may be consulted for the 
data including the ASHRAE Handbook of Refrigeration*, and the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology’s internet website (http://webbook.nist.gov).
Thermodynamic property charts are often referred to as phase diagrams, because, typically the plots 
cover data over a number of different phases. In plotting a phase diagram, the choice of which variable 
to set on the abscissa (‘x-axis’) and which to set on the ordinate (‘y-axis’) will depend on its purpose. In 
the previous section the Carnot cycle was plotted on a TS or temperature entropy diagram, which was 
convenient because the Carnot Cycle involves isothermal and isentropic (i.e. the adiabatic compression 
and expansion) processes, and hence only lines parallel to an axis were required. Often the properties 
of water are plotted as HS (enthalpy vs. entropy) diagrams called Mollier diagrams. However, the most 
common plot for refrigerants is the PH (pressure vs. enthalpy) diagram, an example of which is shown 
in Fig. 2.6 for the refrigerant R-134a , whose chemical name is 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (if you are 
curious about the naming convention for refrigerants, refer to the ASHRAE Handbook of Refrigeration).

(Note that a slightly larger version of this chart may be found in the Appendix – Figure A.1) 
In Fig. 2.6, the blue line corresponds to the saturated liquid, the red line corresponds to the saturated 
vapour, the green lines correspond to isotherms (note the sharp change in the gradient of isotherms as 
they enter and exit the two-phase region) and the black lines correspond to lines of constant entropy 
(‘isentropes’). The point where the saturated liquid and vapour lines meet is known as the critical point. 
Above the critical temperature and critical pressure of the fluid the distinction between liquid and gas 
is vague with density gradients rather than a sharply defined interface between phases, and the fluid is 
said to be supercritical.
Most PH diagrams include more isotherms and isentropes than are shown in Fig. 2.6, and also include 
lines of constant specific volume (the inverse of density). However, the more data included in the chart, 
the harder they are to read, so Fig. 2.6, is drawn specifically to contain sufficient data to perform the 
worked examples in this chapter. A larger version of Fig. 2.6 is provided in the Appendix (Figure A.1).
PH diagrams are useful for obtaining a visual representation of a refrigeration or heat pump cycle; 
however, since the precision of the data is limited by the size of the chart and the amount of data it 
contains, only the most basic calculations can be performed. For greater accuracy, tabulated data are more 
practical to use. The Appendix includes tabulated data for saturated R-134a and superheated R-134a (we 
do not often need to worry about sub-cooled liquid data, since in refrigeration cycles we do not tend to 
operate far away from saturation in the liquid phase). 
Example 2.1: Use Fig. 2.6 the diagram to determine the enthalpy of saturated liquid R134a 
at 1 bar.
Solution: 1 bar = 105 Pa = 0.1 MPa. We locate 0.1 MPa on the pressure axis of Fig. 2.6 
and then follow the line across to the intersection with the blue saturated liquid line, then 
read horizontally downward to the enthalpy axis, which yields an enthalpy of approximately 
165 kJ kg-1. 
Note: Temperatures and pressures involved in plotting Fig. 2.6 are absolute; however, the data 
for enthalpy and entropy depend on the specification of a reference state, and hence different 
sources will give different values of the enthalpy of the saturated liquid R-134a at 1 bar. However, 
regardless of the source, any enthalpy difference determined from a PH diagram for a particular 
refrigerant should have a single result. The data in Fig. 2.6 and Table A1 were obtained from 
the same source, so all numbers including the enthalpy and entropy data will be the same.
Example 2.2: Use the data in Table A2 (Appendix) to determine the enthalpy of superheated 
refrigerant R-134a if the temperature is 100 °C and the entropy is 1.95 kJ kg-1 K-1.

Solution: Find 100 °C in the temperature column in Table A2 and then read horizontally 
across until you come to the entry closest to 1.95 kJ kg-1 K-1, which occurs in the P = 0.6 MPa 
section of the table. Then read the enthalpy value in the neighbouring column, i.e. 487.6 kJ kg-1. 
Example 2.3: Calculate the enthalpy difference between saturated liquid R134a at 40 °C and 
superheated R134a at 0.5 MPa and the same temperature.
Solution: This problem can be solved either by using Fig. 2.6 or by using Tables A1 and A2. 
However, since the point on the saturation curve has been specified in terms of its temperature, 
less interpolation or rounding will be required using the tables, since the independent variable 
in Table A1 is temperature (if the saturated liquid pressure was supplied then Fig. 2.6 might 
have been simpler to use). Let h1 refer to the specific enthalpy of the saturated liquid and h2 
refer to the enthalpy of the superheated vapour. From the ‘hf’ column in Table A1 at 40 °C, 
h1 = 256.4 kJ kg-1; from Table A2 at 40 °C and 0.5 MPa h2 = 430.6 kJ kg-1. The difference is:
Δh = h2 – h1 = 430.6 – 256.4 = 174.2 kJ kg-1.

Vapour Compression Cycles
Can we implement the reversed Carnot cycle in real life? There are, in fact, a number of hurdles that so 
far have prevented anyone from developing a genuine, practical Carnot refrigerator or heat pump. First 
of all, in order to achieve the isothermal processes, we would like to operate the cycle within the two-
phase region of the refrigerant (i.e. under the saturation curves in Fig. 2.6) so that heat exchange causes 
phase-change rather than change in sensible heat. However, it is very difficult to manufacture turbines 
and particularly compressors that will cope with two-phase flows. If we operate in a single-phase region 
(most likely the gaseous region), our expansion and compression processes can, in principle approach 
reversibility, with practical mechanical designs; however, it is difficult to achieve the isothermal processes. 
So where should we make the compromise? 
2.5.1	
Ideal vapour compression cycles
The most commonly used refrigeration cycle is known as the vapour-compression cycle, and accounts for 
roughly 95% of the world’s mechanical refrigerators and heat pumps. The ideal vapour compression cycle 
is illustrated in Fig. 2.7 on TS and PH diagrams, along with a schematic of the hardware. It consists of 
four processes: isentropic vapour compression, isobaric sub-cooling and condensation, isenthalpic liquid 
expansion, and isothermal (and isobaric) evaporation. As much as possible, the heat transfer processes 
occur within the two-phase region, in order to benefit from the efficiency of isothermal processes. Unlike 
the reversed Carnot cycle, however, the compression process occurs outside the two-phase region which 
causes the temperature of the refrigerant to rise significantly above the condensation temperature. This is 
done to avoid two-phase flow that would damage the compressor. The other key difference between the 
ideal vapour compression cycle and the reversed Carnot cycle is that we do not attempt to recover work 
during the expansion process, and simply throttle the refrigerant adiabatically. However, the adiabatic 
throttling causes some of the refrigerant to evaporate, reducing the quantity of heat that can be absorbed.

In practical refrigerators, PH diagrams are generally preferred to TS diagrams for plotting the cycle. By 
plotting an ideal-vapour compression cycle on a PH diagram we can perform relatively straightforward 
estimates of work, heat and COPs of the cycle. The work (W) required to drive the cycle is equal to the 
enthalpy change of the refrigerant during the compression process, i.e. the work is equal to the enthalpy 
change between points 1 and 2 in Fig. 2.8. The heat absorbed by the refrigerant in the evaporator is equal 
to the difference in enthalpy between points 1 and 4 and the heat rejected (QH) by the refrigerant in the 
condenser is equal to the difference in enthalpy between points 2 and 3. Once we know W, QC and QH 
we are able to calculate COPR and COPHP using Eq. 2.16 or Eq. 2.17.
Example 2.4: Consider the ideal vapour compression cycle using R-134a as the refrigerant, and 
operating with a condenser temperature of 40 °C of and an evaporator temperature of –20 °C, 
as shown in Fig. 2.8. Calculate the amount of cooling (QC) and the work (W) input required.

Thermodynamics
Solution: The amount of heat removed is equal to the difference in enthalpy of the refrigerant 
between the inlet and the outlet of the evaporator, i.e. the difference in enthalpy between State 
1 and State 4. The specific enthalpy at State 1 can be obtained from Figure 2.8 by reading the 
‘x-coordinate’ of point 1, i.e. h1 = 385 kJ kg-1. Likewise h4 = 255 kJ kg-1. Hence:
QC = h1 – h4 = 385 – 255 = 130 kJ kg-1
Similarly, the amount of work required is equal to the difference in enthalpy between the inlet 
and the outlet of the compressor, i.e.:
W = h2 – h1 = 430 – 385 = 45 kJ kg-1
Once we know QC and W, we can determine QH by using the First Law: 
QH = QC + W = 130 + 45 = 175 kJ kg-1
Alternatively we could have read it from the chart: 
QH = h2 – h4 = 430 – 255 = 175 kJ kg-1
Example 2.5: For the cycle depicted in Fig. 2.8 calculate COPR and the mass flow-rate of 
refrigerant that would be required to achieve 2 kW of cooling.
Solution: The COPR can be determined easily using Eq. 2.16 and the results from Example 2.4:

In order to calculate the mass flow-rate of refrigerant required we recognise that the enthalpy, 
heat and work data that we have been using so far have units of kJ kg-1. We want to know what 
mass flow-rate will give us heat flow with units of kW (i.e. kJ s-1). This should immediately 
suggest the following relationship:

Example 2.6: An ideal vapour compression cycle using R-134a operates with a suction pressure 
of 0.2 MPa and a discharge pressure of 1.0 MPa. Using the thermodynamic property tables 
for R134a in the Appendix calculate: a) the evaporator and condenser temperatures, b) the 
temperature at the compressor discharge, c) COPHP 
Solution: The ‘suction’ pressure refers to the pressure of the refrigerant at the inlet of the 
compressor, which corresponds to the pressure at States 1 and 4 in Fig. 2.7b. The ‘discharge’ 
pressure refers to the pressure of the refrigerant at the outlet of the compressor, which 
corresponds to the pressure at States 2 and 3. 
a) Since States 1 and 3 lie on the saturation line, there is only one degree of freedom, so if we 
know one state variable (pressure, in this case) we can use Table A1 to find all the other state 
variables. Figure 2.7b shows that the State 1 is at the evaporator temperature, and State 3 is at 
the condenser temperature. From Table A1, the temperature of saturated R134a at 0.2 MPa 
(i.e. T1, the evaporator temperature) is -10 °C. The temperature of saturated R134a at 1.0 MPa 
(i.e. T3, the condenser temperature) is 40 °C.
b) When the refrigerant exits the compressor it is in the superheated state (see Figures 2.7a and 
2.7b), and therefore it has two degrees of freedom, and a variable in addition to the pressure 
needs to be specified in order for the state to be completely defined. In the case of the ideal 
vapour-compression cycle, we have assumed perfect, isentropic compression, i.e. the entropy 
of the refrigerant at the compressor discharge is assumed to be the same as the entropy at the 
suction, hence s1 = s2 (this is shown in Figure 2.8 where the pathway between States 1 and 2 
lies along an isentrope). Since State 1 is completely defined by specifying one state variable, 
we can determine s1 from Table A1 by finding the value in the ‘sg’ column which corresponds 
to P1 (i.e. 0.2 MPa), hence s2 = s1 = 1.73 kJ kg-1 K-1. 
To determine the temperature at State 2, we need to find the temperature which corresponds 
to a pressure of 1.0 MPa and an entropy of 1.73 kJ kg-1K-1 in Table A2. Locating the columns 
under the ‘P = 1.0 MPa’ heading in Table A2 we see that when s = 1.73 kJ kg-1 K-1 the refrigerant 
temperature is 45 °C, i.e. T2 = 45 °C.
c) To calculate COPHP, we observe that for an ideal vapour-compression cycle:

Since States 1 and 3 lie on the saturation curve, we can read h1 from the saturated vapour 
column (hg) of Table A1 when P = 0.2 MPa, i.e. h1 = 392.7 kJ kg-1, and h3 from the saturated 
liquid column (hf) of Table A1 when P = 1.0 MPa, i.e. h3 = 256.4 kJ kg-1. In the solution to part 
b) of this problem we determined that s2 = 1.73 kJ kg-1 K-1 in addition to P2 being given as 1.0 
MPa. Therefore we can obtain h2 by locating the enthalpy value next to the s = 1.73 kJ kg-1 K-1 
entry in the ‘P = 1.0 MPa’ heading of Table A2, i.e. h2 = 425.4 kJ kg-1.

Practical vapour compression cycles
In the previous section we studied the ideal vapour compression cycle, in which the evaporation and 
condensation processes occurred isobarically, the compression occurred isentropically, and the expansion 
occurred adiabatically. In addition, it was assumed that the refrigerant was in the saturated vapour state 
when it entered the compressor, and in the saturated liquid state at the start of the expansion process. 
In real vapour-compression devices none of these assumptions is likely to be entirely accurate, and it is 
worth considering factors which prevent real vapour-compression devices from operating ideally.
Non-isentropic compression process: only a truly reversible compression process is isentropic (i.e. 100% 
efficient). In practice the compression process has an efficiency which is usually greater than 80% of the 
truly isentropic process.
Non-isobaric operation: the reader should also bear in mind that in refrigeration applications larger than the 
domestic setting, there may be a significant length of piping between the evaporator and the compressor, 
and the condenser and the expansion valve. Most systems also have a refrigerant filter/dryer in the line 
to prevent solid particles or water droplets entering and damaging the compressor. Friction between the 
refrigerant and the tubing, fittings and manifolds which contain it, along with bends, expansions and 
restrictions all serve to reduce the pressure of the refrigerant as it passes through the system. 
Condition of the refrigerant entering the compressor: in practice, the risk of having liquid droplets in the 
compressor means that measures are taken to ensure that all the refrigerant has evaporated before it 
enters the compressor, which often means that it is super-heated slightly. In practice this is often achieved 
with the use of an accumulator, a simple device which uses gravity to separate vapour from any liquid.
Condition of the refrigerant entering the expansion valve: although expansion valves are not damaged by 
two-phase flow, it is difficult in practice to control the condensation process such that the refrigerant is a 
saturated liquid as it enters the expansion valve. Additionally, it is reasonably common practice to charge 
the system with an excess of refrigerant as a safety margin, to prevent poor performance or damage caused 
by too little refrigerant in the system (especially given that refrigerant may be lost from the system due 
to leakage). The excess refrigerant is usually stored in a device known as a receiver, which is commonly 
drum-shaped. For this reason, the refrigerant is usually sub-cooled when it enters the expansion valve.
Adiabatic (isenthalpic) expansion process: a well-insulated valve should produce an expansion that is very 
close to being truly isenthalpic; however, if there is no insulation around the valve, the refrigerant will 
absorb heat before it enters the evaporator, thereby reducing the cooling capacity of the system.
Figure 2.9 Shows a PH plot of a more realistic vapour compression cycle superimposed on the ideal 
vapour compression cycle shown in Figure 2.7b. The two cycles (realistic and ideal) have the same 
suction and discharge pressures. The following implications of the differences in the realistic and ideal 
cycles may be observed:

The effects of the non-isentropic compression process are seen in the fact that compression 
pathway of the realistic cycle proceeds to the right of the pathway of the ideal compression 
process, and hence more work is required to achieve the same compression (i.e. h2 – h1 for 
the realistic process is greater than it is for the ideal process)
--
The non-isobaric nature of the passage of the refrigerant between the compressor and 
expansion valve mean that the average temperature in the condenser of the realistic system 
is lower than in the ideal system, and conversely the average temperature in the evaporator 
of the realistic system is higher than in the ideal system. This means that the compressor 
of the realistic system will need to have a higher compression ratio (i.e. will need to do 
more work) than the compressor in the ideal system to operate between the same load and 
ambient temperatures
--
A well-insulated expansion valve should, in principle, approximate isenthalpic expansion; 
however, a poorly insulated valve will result in a reduced COPR, since it reduces the amount 
of liquid refrigerant entering the evaporator, and hence reduces the enthalpy of vaporisation 
available for heat absorption. This can be seen in Figure 2.9a: the refrigerant passing 
through a well-insulated valve will follow the path from 3b to 4; whereas refrigerant passing 
through an un-insulated valve will follow the path from 3b to 4’. Clearly (h1a – h4) is greater 
than (h1a – h4’).

Example 2.7: A real vapour-compression refrigeration cycle operates with a suction pressure of 
0.2 MPa and a compression ratio of 5. The refrigerant enters the compressor close to saturation 
and exits at 50 °C. At the start of the expansion process it is essentially saturated at 36 °C. 
Calculate: 
a) isentropic efficiency of the compression process, where the isentropic efficiency is defined 
(with reference to figure 2.9b) by:

b) the COPR, assuming that the system is sufficiently well-insulated that the only significant 
heat absorption occurs in the evaporator.
c) the cooling capacity of the system under these conditions if the refrigerant flow-rate is 
0.05 kg s-1.
Solution: for this exercise it is most convenient to use the refrigerant property tables A1 and 
A2; however, it may be helpful for the reader to refer to Figure 2.9 to identify which states and 
processes are being discussed.
a) In order to calculate the isentropic efficiency using Eq. 2.22 we need to determine h1b, h2 
and hisentropic. Since the information given is that the refrigerant enters the compressor essentially 
as a saturated gas (i.e. there is negligible difference between h1a and h1b) we can determine 
h1b from finding the enthalpy of the saturated vapour at 0.2 MPa from Table A1, which is 
392.7 kJ kg-1 K-1. The compression ratio of 5 means that the outlet pressure is 1.0 MPa, and 
since the outlet temperature was given as 50 °C, we have the two state variables necessary for 
determining the state of the superheated refrigerant using Table A2, i.e. h2 = 430.9 kJ kg-1 K-1. 
hisentropic is the enthalpy of the refrigerant that would have resulted from an isentropic compression, 
and so we can determine its value by determining the entropy of the refrigerant at the inlet 
and using that entropy along with the exit pressure to determine hisentropic from Table A2 (the 
same as for the calculation of h2 in Example 2.6c), i.e. s1a = s1b = 1.73 kJ kg-1 K-1 (from Table 
A1 at 0.2 MPa), and therefore hisentropic = 425.4 kJ kg-1 (from Table A2 with s = 1.73 kJ kg-1 K-1 
and P =1.0 MPa)
Hence:

Having determined h1a and h2 in part a), and given that there is negligible difference between 
h1a and h1b it remains for us to determine h4. Although State 4 lies within the saturation region, 
we cannot know its enthalpy simply from its temperature and/or pressure, without knowing 
what fraction of the refrigerant is in the liquid state, and what fraction is vapour. If we plotted 
the cycle accurately on a P-H or T-S diagram, we could use the Lever rule to estimate this 
fraction; however, since the problem states that the system is well insulated, it is reasonable to 
assume that the expansion occurs isenthalpically, and hence that h4 = h3b. h3b is the enthalpy 
of the refrigerant at the start of the expansion process, which was given as saturated liquid at 
36 °C, so h3b = h4 = 250.5 kJ kg-1 K-1 (from Table A1). Hence:

Note: Example 2.7 was essentially the more realistic version of the ideal scenario of Example 
2.6. In Example 2.6 and COPR,ideal was 4.2 and COPR,realistic calculated in Example 2.7 was 3.7, 
which illustrates the effect irreversibilities have on performance. However, it should be pointed 
out that had we calculated the COP based on the total power drawn by the system it would 
have been lower, since power is required to run the control system and typically fans on one 
or both of the heat exchangers.

Cascade and multi-stage vapour compression cycles
The performance of an ordinary vapour compression cycle can be improved in a number of ways, at the 
expense of extra capital costs. Eq. 2.23 shows the work required for an adiabatic (isentropic) compression 
process:

(2.23)
Where R is the Universal Gas Constant, and γ is the ratio of specific heat capacity at constant pressure 
to the specific heat capacity at constant volume. 
Eq. 2.23 reveals that the work is required is directly proportional to the suction temperature (the 
temperature of the gas as it enters the compressor) and is also proportional to the compression ratio. 
Since the suction temperature will be set by the desired temperature in the evaporator, the single most 
effective way to reduce the work requirement for a given refrigeration load is to divide the compression 
process into stages with intercooling between stages.
2.6.1	
Cascade refrigeration
Consider the ideal, single-stage vapour compression cycle shown by the dotted black line in Figure 2.10a 
(path 1→2'→7→4'). In this case the condensation and evaporation temperatures (and hence pressures) 
are relatively far apart and the liquid fraction of refrigerant which enters the evaporator is relatively low 
(hence the heat absorption potential is also relatively low). Now consider a modification to the single-
stage vapour compression cycle as shown schematically in Figure 2.10b. In this modified refrigeration 
system, there are actually two cycles operating in two different pressure (and hence temperature) ranges.

The heat exchanger that connects the two cycles serves as the evaporator for the high pressure cycle 
(depicted by the solid blue line following the path 5→6→7→8) and the condenser for the low pressure 
cycle (depicted by the solid blue line following the path 1→2→3→4).
The arrangement shown in Figure 2.10 is knows as a cascade of refrigeration cycles, or cascade 
refrigeration. The advantages of cascade refrigeration over a single-stage cycle is that there is greater 
cooling potential LH'4& K·±K when operating between the same condensation and evaporation 
temperatures, and for a given cooling load the compression work will be lower. This means that the COP 
of cascade refrigerators will be higher than single-stage refrigerators operating between the same 
temperatures. The penalty of the improved performance, though, is in more equipment and hence higher 
capital costs.
In addition to offering greater efficiency than single-stage refrigeration, cascade refrigeration will be able 
to perform some refrigeration tasks that single-stage refrigeration cannot. If the difference between the 
condensation and evaporation temperatures is large the compression ratio required to operate between 
the two temperatures may be too large for practical compressors. Using cascade refrigeration, the overall 
compression can be broken up into manageable compression ratios.

Note that refrigerant flow-rates will not necessarily be the same for each vapour compression cycle 
within a cascade. In order for the cascade refrigerator to function properly, there must be an enthalpy 
balance over the heat exchanger between the two cycles. Referring to the notation in Figure 2.10, the 
enthalpy balance is given by:

The cycles in a cascade refrigerator, need not employ the same refrigerant, which means that different 
refrigerants can be selected for the different cycles, depending on which refrigerant has the optimal 
thermodynamic properties (i.e. the refrigerant with optimal thermodynamic properties in the higher 
temperature range may not be the optimal refrigerant in the lower temperature range). However, if 
the same refrigerant is used in all cycles, a modification of cascade refrigeration known as multi-stage 
refrigeration, may work more efficiently.
2.6.2	
Multi-stage refrigeration
Figure 2.11 shows an ideal multi-stage refrigeration cycle. The key difference between the multi-stage and 
cascade refrigeration cycles is the absence of the heat exchanger between separate vapour compression 
cycles. Instead, after the refrigerant is dropped from the condenser pressure to the intermediate pressure 
(path 7→8 in Figure 2.11), the gaseous fraction is separated from the liquid fraction using a flash drum 
(or flash chamber). The liquid fraction is then expanded again before it passes through the evaporator, 
and then the Compressor 1 (path 3→4→1→2 in Figure 2.11). The vapour coming from Compressor 
1 (which is in the superheated state) is then mixed with the saturated vapour coming from the flash 
drum (path 8→9 in Figure 2.11), and the mixture is then compressed from the intermediate pressure to 
the higher pressure before it passes through the condenser, and the cycle is completed (path 5→6 →7). 
Clearly this arrangement will only work if the same refrigerant is used throughout the cycle, and so it 
will not necessarily be more efficient than an optimised cascade refrigerator.

Example 2.8: Compare the COPR values of a single-stage ideal vapour compression cycle 
with a two-stage, ideal cascade refrigerator both using R134a with a cooling load of 6 kW 
at an evaporator temperature of -26 °C. The condenser pressure is 1.0 MPa, and for the sake 
of simplicity, you may assume that the evaporation and condensation processes in the heat 
exchanger both occur at a constant pressure of 0.3 MPa (although this would require infinite 
heat exchange area in reality). PH diagrams of the two systems are shown in Figure 2.12.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Sorption refrigeration
So far we have considered vapour compression cycles which make up the vast majority of commercial 
refrigeration, heat pump and air conditioning units. However there is a wide range of practical alternatives 
to vapour compression as a means of transferring heat from a low temperature to a high temperature. 
Many of these, such as the thermo-electric devices, magnetic refrigeration and acoustic refrigeration are 
currently limited to small-scale and niche applications, and these will be covered briefly in Chapter 5. 
Probably the only rival to vapour-compression on the medium to large scale is sorption refrigeration, 
a collective term for absorption and adsorption refrigeration. Sorption refrigeration cycles are similar 
in principle to vapour compression cycles, with the main difference being that vapour compression is 
replaced in a novel way such that the work input required to drive the cycle is very small, and instead 
the cycle is essentially driven by heat.
Consider the schematic of the absorption refrigeration cycle shown in Figure 2.13. Comparison of 
Figure 2.13 with Figure 2.7c illustrates that the condenser, expansion valve and evaporator are the same 
for both cycles. The difference occurs once the refrigerant vapour leaves the evaporator, where, in the 
case of absorption refrigeration, instead of entering a compressor it is dissolved in a liquid absorbent. The 
refrigerant/absorbent mixture is then pumped to the condenser pressure where the refrigerant vapour is 
liberated in the generator by heat from an external source such as industrial waste heat or solar energy.

The vapour stream from the regenerator is comprised mainly of refrigerant; however, it will most likely 
contain some entrained absorbent as well. The remaining absorbent is separated from the refrigerant 
in the rectifier, and then returned to the regenerator, while the refrigerant vapour enters the condenser 
and the cycle is repeated. 
The liquid phase in the regenerator which is mainly made up of absorbent, but will most likely contain 
a small amount of un-liberated refrigerant is returned to the absorber. Since the liquid stream entering 
the absorber needs to be heated, and the liquid stream leaving the regenerator needs to be cooled, they 
are passed through a heat exchanger, which reduces the external heating and cooling duties. Generally 
speaking, the lower the temperature of the absorbent, the more refrigerant it will be able to dissolve, so 
there is an incentive to actively cool it, at least with cooling water (i.e. water at ambient temperature).
Clearly the interaction between the refrigerant and absorbent plays a key role in their selection. The 
refrigerant needs to be highly soluble in the absorbent at low temperature and pressure and only 
sparingly soluble at higher temperature and pressure. A common pairing is ammonia as the refrigerant 
and water as the absorbent. Ammonia, which is an excellent refrigerant in a vapour compression cycle, 
is highly soluble in water at low temperatures, but also has a much higher vapour pressure than water, 
so is easily liberated at higher temperature. The disadvantage of ammonia is that it is highly flammable 
and toxic, which means that it is best suited to industrial applications were proper maintenance and 
safety precautions are likely to be practiced. Another common pairing is water as the refrigerant and an 
aqueous solution of lithium bromide as the absorbent, although this system is limited by the relatively 
high freezing temperature of water, and the hazardous nature of lithium bromide.
A COP is essentially the ratio of the cooling output to the energy input. For a sorption refrigerator this 
means:

Sorption refrigerators are more complex and require greater maintenance than vapour-compression 
refrigerators, and are significantly less efficient. Their advantage, however, is that under the right 
circumstances they are cheaper to run. Liquid pumping is far less energy intensive than vapour 
compression, and in terms of the absorption refrigerator, the work input is almost negligible. If the heat 
input comes from a solar thermal array or industrial waste heat then it is essentially ‘cost-free’ energy, 
in which case the lower efficiency of the system can easily be justified economically.

Thermodynamics
Since the work required to run the cycle is small, and the heat source is likely to be renewable (solar) 
or ‘recycled’ (waste heat), another factor in the absorption refrigerator’s favour is that it can be argued 
that it has less impact on the environment, especially in countries where electricity is generated by non-
renewable methods.

Summary of Chapter 2
The majority of refrigerators, air conditioners and heat pumps operate using the vapour compression 
cycle. The performance of these devices is measured by the ratio of the amount of cooling (in the case of 
refrigerators and air conditioners) or heating (in the case of heat pumps) delivered divided by the work 
required to run the cycle, which is mainly associated with the compression stage. This ratio is known as 
the coefficient of performance, or COP:

The COPs of the reversed Carnot cycle illustrate principles that are generally true of real devices:
--
The performance of refrigerators and heat pumps is increased by an increase in the target 
temperature (TH or TC), and decreased by an increase in the difference between TH and TC 
--
Any device that may be operated both as a heat pump and a refrigerator (e.g. the typical 
domestic heat pump) will have a higher COP when operated as a heat pump than as a 
refrigerator
For set values of TH and TC, the COPs for devices employing the vapour compression cycles may be 
increased by breaking the overall compression process into stages, by employing cascade or multi-stage 
refrigeration.
Sorption refrigeration offers the main alternative to vapour compression refrigeration, and can be thought 
of as being driven by heat rather than by work. Sorption refrigerators are generally less efficient than 
vapour compression refrigerators, but they can be cheaper to run and have the potential to have less 
impact on the environment.

Heat Transfer
3	 Heat Transfer
Classical thermodynamics considers changes between thermodynamic states (i.e. changes in variables 
such as temperature, pressure, enthalpy etc.) but not the rate at which changes occur. However, rates of 
change are often important for practical purposes. High efficiency designs or processes, as identified by 
the Laws of Thermodynamics, may be too slow to be practical, and some compromise between energy 
efficiency and practicality will often be required. For this reason we need a separate, but related discipline 
known as ‘heat transfer’ (also known as ‘heat transport’ or ‘heat transmission’), which is the science 
concerned with calculating heat flows and temperatures as a function of time and location.
3.1	
Modes of heat transfer
Heat may be transferred by three different mechanisms:
--
Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy from high-temperature regions of a substance 
to adjacent, lower-temperature regions as a result of physical interaction between atoms/
molecules in the form of collisions and vibrations.
--
Convection is the combined effect of conduction and fluid motion, from density differences 
(buoyancy), wind or natural water flows, or mechanical means
--
Thermal Radiation is energy emitted by matter in the form of electromagnetic waves (or 
photons) over a range of wavelengths. It does not occur as the result of direct physical 
contact between atoms or molecules. 
As a generalisation, we are concerned with conduction within solids, and convection within fluids and 
radiation between surfaces separated by a fluid. Radiation is the most difficult of the three modes to 
model mathematically and in refrigeration applications its influence is relatively minor (although certainly 
not negligible) and hence its effects may often be approximated simply or combined with the effects of 
convection, as will be assumed to be the case throughout the remainder of this chapter.
3.2	
Steady state conduction and convection
Many of the heat transfer analyses involved in refrigeration can be performed with steady state models, 
i.e. models which assume there is no net change with time in the variables of interest (or at least no 
significant net change). 
One dimensional steady state conduction is described by Fourier’s Law:

where: k is thermal conductivity (W m-1 K-1), A is the cross-sectional area in the direction of the heat 
flow (m2) and dT/dx is the temperature gradient in the x-direction (K m-1) and the subscript x is to 
indicate the heat flow in the x-direction. Note that the negative sign in Fourier’s Law is to ensure that 
the heat flow is positive when heat flows from a higher temperature to a lower temperature (i.e. when 
the temperature gradient is negative), so that the Second Law of Thermodynamics is not violated. When 
rearranged to be explicit in terms of k, Eq. (3.1) actually serves as a definition of thermal conductivity. 
Data for thermal conductivity of different materials may be found in a wide variety of sources, including 
those listed at the end of this chapter.

where h is referred to as the heat transfer coefficient (W m-2 K-1), or the film heat transfer coefficient. As 
with thermal conductivity and Fourier’s Law, Newton’s Law of Cooling actually serves as the definition 
of h, i.e. the proportionality between a temperature difference and a heat flux. Experiments have shown 
that h is dependent on a large number of factors including the velocity and turbulence of the fluid over 
the surface of an object and the physical properties of the fluid. In practice heat transfer coefficients are 
often determined from correlations of experimental data. A large number of data for flow in pipes and 
ducts and over flat plates may be found in the literature (including the references listed at the end of 
this chapter). Table 3.1 gives a list of indicative values for heat transfer coefficients.

Heat Transfer
It is worth noting from Table 3.1 that heat transfer coefficients due to flowing liquids (i.e. forced 
convection) are typically orders of magnitudes higher than flowing gases, and that heat transfer coefficients 
due to condensation and boiling processes are typically orders of magnitudes higher than for flowing 
liquids. Hence the phase change processes that take place in the condenser and evaporator are beneficial 
not only because of the high energy storage capacity, but also because of the high rates of heat transfer 
that may occur.
Consider the diagram shown in Figure 3.1, of a plane wall separating two fluids in which the bulk fluid 
temperature on one side of the wall is kept constant at T∞,i, while the bulk fluid on the other side of 
the window is kept constant at some lower temperature T∞,o (e.g. a window in a room which has the 
air temperature thermostatically controlled during a period when the outside air temperature remains 
essentially constant).

Figure 3.1: Schematic of a plane wall separating two fluids
Note that while the temperature of the fluid (say, air) a certain distance away from the window will 
have little dependence on x, there is a noticeable reduction in temperature as it approaches the surface 
of the wall, due to the presence of a boundary layer of air – a layer of air that is prevented from mixing 
as thoroughly with the air in the room due to friction against the surface of the window pane. Likewise 
there is a boundary layer on the outside of the window. A typical temperature profile of this situation is 
indicated by the red line in Figure 3.1.
According to Newton’s Law of Cooling, the heat transferred from the air inside the room to the surface 
of the window is:

from the inside bulk air to the inside window surface must be equal to the heat flow through the window 
pane and also to the heat flow from the outside surface to the bulk air outside, i.e.:

and is very useful for performing calculations and analyses in heat exchangers, such as a condenser or 
evaporator of a refrigeration system, and also for modelling heat infiltration into a refrigerator, from a 
variety of sources. Its value may be determined relatively simply by relatively straightforward experiments, 
as will be illustrated for a heat exchanger later in Example 3.1.

Heat Exchangers
The scenario depicted in Figure 3.1 assumes that the heat flow from one fluid to the other is small 
enough so as to have negligible impact on either bulk fluid temperature T∞,i or T∞,o (i.e. the two fluids 
behave as thermal reservoirs). This assumption allows us to assume the bulk fluid temperatures remain 
constant over prescribed time periods. This scenario is reasonable when considering heat loss through a 
window, for example, but is not accurate for heat exchangers, where the purpose of the heat exchanger 
is to change the fluid temperatures.
For heat exchangers we are typically interested in four temperatures, the inlet and outlet temperatures 
of the stream on the higher temperature side (TH,i, and TH,o) and the inlet and outlet temperatures on 
the lower temperature side (TC,i, and TC,o). Because the temperature of the hotter fluid is not constant, 
but varies between TH,i, and TH,o (and similarly for the colder fluid) we cannot use a simple expression 
like Eq. (3.11), even if we know the heat transfer area and the overall heat transfer coefficient. What we 
need is an expression for the average temperature difference between the two fluids over the entire heat 
exchange surface, and the appropriate average in this case is the logarithmic mean, or more specifically 
in this context, the Logarithmic Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD or ∆TLM) defined by Eq. (3.12) 
for counter-current flow (see Figure 3.2):

Figure 3.2: Illustration of co-current and counter-current flow in a heat exchanger
Counter-current flow, in which the fluids enter the exchanger at opposite ends is more efficient than 
co-current flow, in which the fluids enter the exchanger at the same end simply because the LMTD will 
be higher for given values of TH,i, TH,o, TC,i, and TC,o [Demonstrate this for yourself! To get the co-current 
form of the LMTD, simply switch the positions of TC,i, and TC,o in Eq. (3.12)].

Heat Transfer
In some cases the outlet temperatures of the two streams in a heat exchanger may not be known, and 
hence the LMTD cannot be determined. However, using a technique known as the Effectiveness-NTU 
Method, the heat transferred and outlet temperatures of both streams may be determined, provided 
the overall heat transfer coefficient, heat transfer area and heat capacities of both streams are known. 
The reader is directed to the references listed at the end of this chapter for more information of the 
Effectiveness-NTU method.
Example 3.1. A counter-current heat exchanger is used to cool a process stream from 80 °C 
to 35 °C, using water from a river at 15 °C. If the mass flow-rate of the process stream is 40 kg 
s-1, its specific heat capacity is 3.9 kJ kg-1 K-1 and the heat transfer area of the heat exchanger 
is 200 m2, calculate:
a) the required flow-rate of cooling water if the exit temperature is not allowed to rise above 
25 °C (assume the specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 kJ kg-1 K-1) 
b) the overall heat transfer coefficient of heat exchanger.
Solution: a) The mass flow-rate of the cooling water may be found by performing an enthalpy 
balance on both fluid streams. From the process stream we can calculate the heat transferred 
from its change in enthalpy:

Heat Transfer
In Example 3.1 the fluids on both sides of the heat exchange surface had temperatures varying continuously 
along the length of the heat exchanger; however, in the evaporator and condenser of a refrigeration system, 
the refrigerant temperature will not vary as significantly because of the phase change occurring. In fact, 
for first-approximation calculations it will be reasonable to assume that the refrigerant temperature is 
constant at the condensing temperature (as determined from the phase diagram or refrigerant property 
tables) or evaporating temperature, as appropriate.
Another point to note is that the need for a finite temperature difference across the heat exchange surface 
in a heat exchanger reduces the performance of a refrigeration system. This point is illustrated in Figure 
3.3, and Example 3.2.
Figure 3.3: Schematic of the relative temperature differences between the evaporator and condenser, superimposed on a T-S diagram 
for a vapour compression cycle (c.f. Fig. 2.7a).
Example 3.2: If a refrigerator is being used to maintain a temperature of 4 °C, and is rejecting 
heat to air at 25 °C, calculate the difference in Carnot COP based on the refrigerant temperatures 
and the air-side temperatures, if the LMTD of each heat exchanger is a) 5 °C, b) 10 °C.

Example 3.2 shows that the maximum performance of the refrigerator is decreased as the LMTD is 
increased. So why do we not choose to have minimal LMTD in condensers and evaporators, thereby 
maximising the COP? The answer can be seen by rearranging the heat exchanger equation (i.e. Eq. 3.13):

(3.14)
For a given heat duty and overall heat transfer coefficient, the required heat transfer area (and hence 
size and cost of the heat exchanger) is inversely proportional to the LMTD. The temperature difference 
across the heat exchanger is therefore a key design variable whose value will be determined by a trade-off 
between the greater energy efficiency of a small LMTD against the lower costs and size of a larger LMTD.
3.4	
Transient Heat Transfer
When an object (e.g. a food product) is placed into a refrigerator, we are often interested in the time 
required for the object to cool to a specified temperature, and perhaps also the instantaneous rate of 
heat loss from the product. This is vitally important with temperature-sensitive materials, including most 
biological products, where there is a risk of spoilage if the rate of temperature change is either too slow 
or too fast. Since the temperature change and heat transfer rates are dependent on time, we cannot use 
the simple steady-state equations of Sections 3.2 and 3.3.
For liquids we can assume that, due to natural convection, the temperature within the liquid container 
is roughly uniform and therefore may be represented by one temperature. In this situation an enthalpy 
balance around the food product which is cooled at its surface by some medium (usually, but certainly 
not exclusively, air) is given by:

Eq. (3.16) is often referred to as the ‘lumped heat capacity model’ and gives a simple exponential 
decay relationship between temperature and time. As well as being a realistic model for liquids, it can 
occasionally be used for solids, provided the size of the object is small (a thickness of a few millimetres) 
and it is being cooled in still air. The heat load for this problem can be determined from:

For solids (or for highly viscous liquids) the spatial temperature variation within the object must be 
accounted for and a simple enthalpy balance such as Eq. (3.15) will not be adequate. For a material 
having uniform composition and whose thermal properties are independent of temperature, conduction 
within the product is governed by Fourier’s Second Law, which is a form of commonly occurring partial 
differential equation called the Diffusion Equation:

Note that an ‘apparent heat transfer coefficient’ may be used which will include the effects of radiation

For regular geometries in which heat transfer is only significant in one dimension (e.g. the sphere, the 
long cylinder and the plane wall) and objects being initially at some uniform temperature (T0), the 
solution of Eq. (3.18) with convection boundary conditions may be written generally as:

The Biot number is a very important parameter in any transient heat transfer problem involving 
conduction because it is the ratio of internal to external heat transfer resistance. A high Bi (e.g. Bi > 10) 
indicates that the heat transfer process is dominated by conduction within the product, while a low Bi (e.g. 
Bi < 0.1) indicates that resistance to heat transfer is dominated by resistance between the product’s surface 
and the cooling fluid (and Eq. 3.16 may therefore be applied). Most cooling models are dependent on Bi.

(3.27)
Comparison of Eqs. (3.26) and (3.27) indicates that any off-centre temperature may simply be related 
to the centre temperature by the factor ζ1 (Eq. 3.25) which is independent of time. This is illustrated in 
Figure 3.4 which shows the cooling curves at the surface, mid-radius and centre of a sphere.
Figure 3.4. Cooling curves at the centre, mid-radius and surface of a sphere with Bi = 1.
Figure 3.4 shows that when the cooling curves at different positions are plotted as lnθ vs. t, they are 
parallel lines with different y-intercepts. The effect of the ζ function in Eq. 3.20 is to move the cooling 
curve up or down, depending on how far off centre the point of interest is.
Example 3.3: An orange may be approximated as a perfect sphere having the thermal properties 
of water and a radius of 40 mm. If the orange is initially at a uniform temperature of 25 °C and 
it is placed in a refrigerator in which the air is maintained at 4 °C calculate:
a) the time for the temperature at the centre of the orange to reach 10 °C 
b) the temperature at the surface at this time. Use the following data: h = 45 W m-2 K-1, k = 0.6 
W m-1 K-1, ρ = 999 kg m-3, Cp = 4180 J kg-1.

Heat Transfer
Solution: a) To determine the time required for the centre temperature to reach 10 °C, we 
use Eq. 3.27 where Fo (effectively the dimensionless time) is the unknown value. We can then 
solve for t from the definition of Fo (Eq. 3.21). However, in order to use Eq. 3.27 we will need 
to know the value of λ1, which we can obtain from the Bi number via Eq. 3.23.

Heat Transfer
While some items that might be placed in a refrigerated environment might be approximately spherical 
or cylindrical, most of them will have irregular geometries. The mathematics that would be required for 
analytical models of the cooling process would be excessively complex to be worthwhile; however, it is 
actually possible to treat the effects of geometry empirically, and independently of the effects of time. 
This may be seen by plotting the cooling curves of the three simple geometries (sphere, long cylinder 
and plane wall) for Bi = 1 (i.e. same dimensions, physical properties and heat transfer coefficient for 
each shape), as shown in Figure 3.5.
Figure 3.5. Cooling curves for sphere, long cylinder and plane wall with Bi = 1.
Figure 3.5 illustrates that the cooling curve for a long cylinder or plane wall could be obtained by applying 
a constant ‘shape factor’ to the cooling curve of the sphere (and, in fact, another factor applied to the 
y-intercept) provided the radius of the cylinder and the half-thickness of the wall are the same as the 
radius of the sphere. Hence, any geometry can have empirical shape factors determined by relatively 
simple experimentation; a point that will be expanded on in Chapter 6.

Summary of Chapter 3
While Thermodynamics allows us to perform calculations about the necessary temperatures pressures 
and heat flows in refrigeration problems, we need the separate discipline of Heat Transfer to allow us to 
size the heat exchangers of a refrigeration system, and also to determine the transient temperatures and 
heat loads of products being placed in the refrigeration system to be cooled. 
For the former problem we used steady-state heat transfer analyses and arrived at the heat exchanger 
equation:

Refrigerants
4	 Refrigerants
The vast majority of refrigerators, heat pumps and air conditioners use the vapour compression cycle – the 
vapour that gives its name to the cycle is a working fluid called the refrigerant (even for heat pumps and 
air conditioners). Of course it is possible to achieve mechanical cooling without a refrigerant, but these 
devices make up only a very small percentage of all refrigerators, and will be dealt with in a Chapter 5.
So what is required for a substance to be a refrigerant? It turns out that almost any fluid can be used in 
a mechanical refrigeration cycle, including common-place ones such as air, water and carbon dioxide. 
However, some perform better than others; and of course most readers will be aware of environmental 
considerations such as the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect. So how does one select the best 
refrigerant for a task?
4.1	
Desirable Attributes of Refrigerants
Generally speaking there are three basic categories of attributes we desire of our refrigerants:
1.	 Performance (efficiency, compatibility, cost)
2.	 Safety
3.	 Minimal environmental impact

Refrigerants
4.1.1	
Performance
The first aspect of performance is thermodynamic efficiency; we would like the refrigerant to have a 
high critical point and low triple point so that it can operate within the vapour-liquid region of the 
phase diagram (and hence have sufficient phase change in both the condenser and evaporator), and high 
enthalpies of vaporisation so that each gram of refrigerant can transport large quantities of heat. These two 
criteria might lead us to look at small, polar molecules: small for large specific enthalpies of vaporisation, 
and polar for higher critical points. One such molecule that fits this description is ammonia, which is 
indeed one of the most efficient refrigerants, and has been used consistently almost since the dawn of 
mechanical refrigeration. However, it does not do so well in the safety criteria, as will be discussed later.
But there other desirable physical attributes: we want a relatively high density of the vapour at the 
compressor inlet to minimise the work requirement, we would like high thermal conductivity for heat 
transfer, and we typically require miscibility with the lubricating oil of the compressor. We also need 
the refrigerant to be chemically stable so that its performance doesn’t change over time, or worse still, 
produce detrimental by-products. We want it to be non-corrosive, so that we do not need to pay for 
expensive, corrosion-resistant materials of construction for our refrigerator. Finally, of course, we need 
the refrigerant itself to be relatively cheap.
4.1.2	
Refrigerant Safety
Ammonia performs excellently in a wide range of refrigeration applications; however, it is highly 
flammable and toxic, which means it is not suitable in domestic settings, or in devices which are 
susceptible to leakage, such as automobile air-conditioners. Clearly we would prefer non-flammable, 
non-toxic refrigerants. In the 1930s Thomas Midgley discovered that a class of compounds containing 
one or two carbon atoms, with varying numbers of chlorine and fluorine atoms attached were very 
effective refrigerants. These chemicals, later to be referred to as chloro-fluoro-carbons, or CFCs seemed 
to be ideal; they had desirable thermodynamic properties, and they were non-toxic, non-flammable and 
non-corrosive. For 50 years or so they were used abundantly, particularly R11 (trichlorofluoromethane 
CCl3F2), R12 (dichlorodifluoro-methane CCl2F2) and R22 (Chlorodifluoromethane, CHClF2). In the late 
1970s, however, scientists Rowland and Molina argued that the chlorine in CFCs was destroying ozone 
in the stratosphere. After some initial opposition, this theory was accepted as being correct and Rowland 
and Molina shared the Nobel Prize in 1995 for their work. Clearly while being efficient and safe in terms 
of direct exposure to humans, CFCs have a negative environmental impact.

Refrigerants
4.1.3	
Environmental Impact
There are two aspects of the environmental impact of a refrigerant; firstly there is the direct impact of 
the refrigerant leaking from a system and escaping to the atmosphere; secondly there is also the impact 
from the extra carbon load on the environment from the extra fossil-fuel that needs to be burned by a 
less-efficient refrigerant compared to a more efficient refrigerant. There are two major measures of the 
environment impact of a refrigerant: the ozone depleting potential (ODP) and the Global Warming 
Potential (GWP). The ODP is based solely on the impact of the release of the refrigerant into the 
atmosphere; however the GWP is based not only on the direct release of the refrigerant into the 
atmosphere, but also the energy consumption for a given refrigeration load by that particular refrigerant. 
Sometimes the term Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI) is used in GWP calculations.
In 1987 the Montreal Protocol was signed by a large number of countries, and the phase-out of refrigerants 
containing chlorine began in order to protect the ozone layer, and has continued successfully, to the 
point that CFCs have almost disappeared from use in the Developed World. How could they be replaced? 
Ideally, ‘drop-in’ replacements could be found such that an existing refrigeration system could be drained 
of its old, CFC refrigerant and be replaced by a non-CFC. One highly successful example was R134a 
(1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane, CH2FCF3) as a drop-in replacement for R12; however being a compound 
containing fluorine (a so-called ‘F-gas’), which have direct GWP values of several thousand times that of 
carbon dioxide, its use has been scheduled for phase-out by signatories of the Kyoto Protocol. So what’s 
left? Ammonia is efficient and environmentally friendly, but hazardous. CFC’s are efficient and safe but 
destroy the ozone. F-gases such as R134a are efficient and safe but apparently contribute significantly to 
global warming. Which refrigerants are suitable in the modern age?
4.2	
Refrigerants after the Montreal and Kyoto Protocols
To date no single refrigerant has been discovered that satisfies all the criteria desired of the ideal 
refrigerant. Perhaps R12 came the closest to being the ideal refrigerant before its environmental impacts 
were discovered, but since then no single compound can claim to be as dominant as it once was. Instead 
different refrigerants tend to be used for different tasks; the common ones are discussed briefly here.
4.2.1	
Ammonia
Ammonia, as mentioned previously, was one of the very first refrigerants to be used with the vapour 
compression cycle. It has been in continuous use since then, although its popularity saw a decline in 
the middle of the 20th century due to the widespread use of CFCs. Since the signing of the Montreal 
Protocol, however, its use has recovered. As discussed above, it fares very well against the performance 
criteria but poorly in the safety criteria. However, given that it is part of the nitrogen cycle it performs 
excellently again against the environmental criteria, having both zero ODP and zero GWP.

Refrigerants
Today it is the dominant refrigerant on the industrial scale, thanks to its high efficiency, low cost and 
minimal environmental impact. With advances in the design of refrigeration components, leakage is 
less of a problem. In addition, the use of non-flammable secondary refrigerants (i.e. refrigerants that are 
cooled by the primary refrigerant, before in turn cooling the load) has reduced safety concerns where 
flammability is a significant risk.
4.2.2	
Carbon Dioxide
Like ammonia, carbon dioxide was one of the first refrigerants to be used in the vapour-compression 
cycle; however it is not as efficient as ammonia, having quite a low critical point. It performs better than 
ammonia against the safety criteria, being non-flammable and less toxic (although it may still cause fatal 
poisoning), and has zero ODP and relatively low (some would argue zero) direct GWP. It disappeared 
from widespread use after the advent of the CFCs in the 1930s, but in recent years has made a strong 
recovery with the development of the trans-critical vapour-compression cycle. Its use is predicted to 
increase, both for low temperatures on the industrial scale, and also for commercial use, such as in 
supermarket display cabinets.

Refrigerants
4.2.3	
Hydrocarbons
Like carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons were tested as refrigerants before the introduction of CFCs, but 
their high flammability saw them fall out of favour. They too have seen more widespread use since the 
Montreal and Kyoto Protocols to the point where iso-butane (R600a, CH(CH3)3) in particular is widely 
used in domestic refrigeration in Northern Europe. It has been predicted that the use of hydrocarbon 
refrigerants will increase in the future as safety features of refrigeration systems are improved.
4.2.4	
Hydro-fluorocarbons (HFCs)
As the chosen successor to R12, R134a is still in widespread use, particularly for smaller applications such 
as domestic refrigerators and domestic and automobile air conditioners. Because it has high GWP, there 
has been pressure for its phase-out by signatories of the Kyoto Protocol, but since there are many countries 
who are not signatories, its use (along with other HFCs) looks set to continue for several years to come.
4.2.5	
Blends
Refrigerant blends have been used since the time of CFCs, as people attempted to tailor the performance 
and safety of the refrigerant to meet a desired task. For example, an efficient but flammable refrigerant 
may be blended with a slightly less-efficient, non-flammable refrigerant to reduce the overall flammability 
of the mixture.
Ideally azeotropic mixtures (i.e. those whose composition does not vary between the liquid and vapour 
phases) should be used, since their properties are not altered as a result of leakage. Common examples 
of blended refrigerants are R502, which is a blend of the CFCs R22 and R115 (CClF2CF3) and R404A, 
which is a blend of the HFCs R134a, R143a (CH3CF3) and R125 (CHCF5). HFC blends continue to be 
used in commercial refrigeration, but are subject to political pressure for their phase-out.
4.3	
Summary of Chapter 4
The ideal refrigerant has a high critical point, high enthalpy of vaporisation, is miscible with lubricating 
oil, is cheap, is non-flammable, is non-toxic, has zero ODP and GDP, amongst other desirable criteria. 
Unsurprisingly, perhaps, no single refrigerant satisfies all these desirable criteria. Since the signing of 
the Montreal and Kyoto Protocols, the trend has been away from the synthetic, chlorine and fluorine-
containing refrigerants towards natural refrigerants such as ammonia, carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons. 
Some synthetics, R134a in particular, look set to remain in widespread use for the foreseeable future.

Refrigeration  withou t  a Refrigeran
5	 Refrigeration without a 
Refrigerant
If a sufficiently cold natural environment is not available to cool an object, then in order to achieve a 
cooling effect one has to be able to change a body’s temperature without the transfer of heat (since heat 
will only flow from a higher temperature to a colder temperature). The vapour compression and sorption 
refrigeration cycles rely on gas expansion to reduce the temperature of the refrigerant. However, there 
are several other options.
5.1	
Evaporative cooling
The human body is cooled by water (sweat) evaporating from the skin. This same principle may be 
applied to achieve air cooling, and is particularly effective in dry climates. There are indications from 
ancient paintings that as early as the time of the Pharaohs in Egypt evaporative cooling was used in 
homes, as earthenware pitchers were filled with water which saturated the clay and evaporated from 
the surface. Today there is a thriving commercial market for evaporative coolers, particularly for people 
who live on or near a desert. 
Obviously, evaporative cooling is limited to a relatively narrow range of temperatures, and is most effective 
for air-conditioning applications. The cooling effect is directly proportional to the difference in humidity 
between the air before and after it is sprayed with water, so evaporative cooling will not be feasible in humid 
climates. The reader might argue that the water used in evaporative cooling is a refrigerant; however, 
it is not a working fluid in the common sense of the term, which is why it is included in this chapter. 
In a dry climate, all that is needed for an evaporative cooling system is water source, a small pump to 
pass the water through an atomising nozzle, and a fan to circulate the cooled air. Misting fans are an 
example of a very simple, portable evaporative cooling device.
In very dry climates the increased humidity of the air from the water spray adds to human comfort. 
In climates that are not particularly dry the air will most likely need to be dehumidified prior to being 
sprayed with water in order that there is a sufficient driving force for the evaporation process, and also to 
prevent the need to humidify the air above 85%, which would make it uncomfortable to humans. Often 
desiccant systems are used for dehumidification, sometimes in the form of wheels, and sometimes in the 
form of stationary beds. The addition of the dehumidifying process increases the power requirement of 
the fan, since the pressure drop through the desiccant will be significant. Also, the desiccant will need 
to be regenerated, typically by heating. A number of prototype devices have been developed which use 
photovoltaics to drive the pump and fan, and solar thermal energy to regenerate the desiccant, thereby 
producing a stand-alone system, even in climates with moderate humidity.

Refrigeration  withou t  a Refrigeran
The advantage of evaporative cooling over vapour-compression air-conditioning is the relatively low 
running cost, since no gas is being compressed (the water pump and fan use orders of magnitude less 
energy than a compressor), and often very low installation and maintenance cost.
The disadvantages, apart from the requirement of low humidity and a narrow range of temperatures, are 
that warm, still water is an ideal breeding environment place for insects, such as mosquitoes and bacteria, 
such as legionella which causes Legionnaires Disease. For this reason a number of systems use indirect 
cooling, enclosing the sprayed water via a heat exchanger so that any potential contaminants won’t be 
breathed in by humans. Indirect systems are less efficient and more complex, which is the trade-off for 
their increased safety.
5.2	
Peltier-Seebeck effect (thermoelectric devices)
The Peltier-Seebeck effect describes the relationship between temperature and voltage that occurs when 
two dissimilar conductors (typically metals) are connected at two separate junctions. If the two junctions 
are held at dissimilar temperatures then a voltage difference will exist between the two junctions, and 
this phenomenon is known as the Seebeck effect. The Seebeck effect may be used to measure temperature 
since the voltage generated is proportional to the temperature difference between the two junctions. 
Temperature sensors that make use of the Seebeck effect are known as thermocouples, and they are 
typically cheap and very versatile; although are not as accurate as resistance thermometers.

Refrigeration  withou t  a Refrigeran
Alternatively the voltage generated by the Seebeck effect may be used to run a motor. A large number of 
thermocouples grouped together and operating between the same temperatures is known as a thermopile, 
and may be used to measure temperatures, or as a thermo-electric engine. A thermo-electric engine is 
one which employs the Seebeck effect to generate work from a sustained temperature difference. For 
example, if a thermal hot spring exists close to a cold river, a thermo-electric engine might be used to 
power a fan simply by having one junction in the hot spring and the other junction in the cold river.
The Peltier effect is essentially the Seebeck effect in reverse. If a voltage difference is applied between the 
two junctions of a thermocouple, one junction will increase in temperature while the other junction 
will decrease in temperature. The low temperature junction of the Peltier cooling is maintained by the 
continuous supply of power, even as it absorbs heat from its surroundings. Thus the Peltier effect offers us 
an incredibly simple cooling method, and allows us to produce cooling devices having no moving parts, 
which can be of any size or shape. Peltier coolers have a wide range of niche applications, particularly 
in electronics and in research laboratories. 
Figure 5.1 shows a demonstration model of a thermo-electric device at the University of Waikato. The 
thermo-electric unit (thermocouple) is sandwiched between two aluminium legs. If the device is switched 
to the ‘engine’ setting, then the fan will run if one leg is placed in ice water and the other is placed in 
boiling water. If the device is switched to the ‘Peltier’ setting and a DC power supply (up to 5V for this 
device) is attached to the electrodes, then one of its legs will increase in temperature, while the other 
will decrease.

Refrigeration  withou t  a Refrigeran
So why are Peltier coolers not in more common use? The simple answer is they have very low 
thermodynamic efficiency – of the order of 10–15 % of Carnot efficiency. This limits their application to 
the small scale, where their inefficiency is more than compensated by their practicality. Some commercial 
units are available and research efforts are continuing with the goal of increasing their efficiency, but in 
the foreseeable future, they will be limited to small, niche applications.
5.3	
Magneto-Calorific Effect (Magnetic Refrigeration)
The magneto-calorific effect describes changes in the temperature of a (solid) medium when it is placed 
in a changing magnetic field. The temperature change occurs as a result of the entropy reduction that is 
caused by the magnetic dipoles of the atoms in the solid coming into alignment as a result of the applied 
magnetic field. Alloys of the element gadolinium (Gd) show a particularly noticeable temperature change 
when a magnetic field is applied.
To exploit the magneto-calorific effect in a refrigeration cycle, the magneto-calorific material (often in 
the form of a rotor) is successively exposed to magnetic fields and heat exchange environments in an 
analogous manner to the vapour compression cycle. Beginning with the rotor in an unmagnetised state 
at low temperature, the rotor is magnetised adiabatically (i.e. in an insulated environment) such that its 
temperature increases (analogous to the adiabatic compression process). At the end of the magnetisation 
process the rotor enters a heat exchanger where it rejects its heat in an isomagnetic state (analogous to 
the condensation process). Subsequently it is de-magnetised adiabatically, which lowers its temperature 
(analogous to the expansion process). Finally it absorbs heat at the lower temperature (analogous to the 
evaporation process), before the cycle is repeated.
Magnetic refrigeration saw its earliest practical use in low-temperature (cryogenic) applications; however, 
more recently a lot more effort has been put into developing units for room-temperature. By contrast 
with thermo-electric devices, magnetic refrigerators can be very thermodynamically efficient, provided 
the heat absorption and heat rejection temperatures do not vary too significantly. This efficiency, along 
with the fact that there is no refrigerant vapour to escape into the atmosphere means that magnetic 
refrigeration is a very environmentally friendly option. It is also very quiet, since there is no compressor, 
and like thermo-electric devices has relatively few moving parts. For these reasons there are hopes that the 
technology will continue to be developed to the point that it may one day become the standard method 
of refrigeration in small-scale applications such as in domestic settings or automobile air-conditioning.

Refrigeration  withou t  a Refrigeran
However, the magnetic refrigerator does suffer disadvantages, particularly when compared to the vapour 
compression cycle. The temperature difference between magnetised and unmagnetised states is limited 
which means that if there is a significant difference between the heat absorption and heat rejection 
temperatures then a cascade design may have to be employed. Permanent magnets also have limited field 
strength, which imposes a relatively low upper limit to the rate at which heat may be absorbed, since 
electro-magnets would make the overall cost restrictive. But perhaps the biggest restriction is due to the 
low rates of heat transfer that occur in the heat exchangers, where rates are orders of magnitude lower 
than rates encountered with evaporating liquids and condensing vapours. Also the heat is not transferred 
isothermally, as is mostly the case in evaporators and condensers, which greatly reduces the logarithmic 
mean temperature difference of each exchanger. For these reasons, even if magnetic refrigeration devices 
come in to common usage, it is probable that they will be limited to small applications.
5.4	
Thermo-acoustic effect (acoustic refrigeration)
Inasmuch as sound waves are fluctuations in pressure within a fluid medium (usually a gas), there will 
be temperature fluctuations associated with these pressure fluctuations. If the pressure fluctuations can 
be made to be large enough, the accompanying temperature fluctuations may be exploited to achieve 
refrigeration.

Refrigeration  withou t  a Refrigeran
A schematic of an acoustic refrigerator is shown in Figure 5.2. An ultrasonic, high-amplitude sound 
generator (essentially an audio speaker) is placed at one end of a pressurised resonator tube and is used 
to generate a standing wave. The length of the resonator tube is designed to be one half-wavelength of 
the generated sound wave at the desired frequency (hence the effect is analogous to plucking a guitar 
string). Near the sound generator end of the tube is a stack of parallel, low-conductivity plates that make 
up the regenerator. 
Figure 5.3: Schematic of an acoustic refrigerator
Let us consider what happens to a small volume of gas as it travels between the regenerator plates. 
As the soundwave moves the volume from the cold side of the stack to the hot side it is compressed 
adiabatically, and so its temperature increases so that it can exchange heat with the fluid in the hot heat 
exchanger at constant pressure (isobarically but not isothermally), but with a loss in temperature. The 
gas is then moved back from the hot side to the cold side and expands adiabatically so that it is at a 
lower temperature than the heat exchange fluid in the cold heat exchanger, where again it transfers heat 
isobarically, and the cycle repeats.
In principle, the thermodynamic efficiency of acoustic refrigerators could be very high, and like Peltier 
coolers and magnetic refrigerators they have few moving parts and have no refrigerant to cause ozone 
depletion or global warming. However, in practice their performance is greatly limited by the efficiency 
of the heat exchangers, which, similar to magnetic refrigerators, suffers from low heat transfer rates 
and low logarithmic mean temperature differences, and so its application would be limited to the small 
scale. Currently it is not considered to be as promising an alternative to vapour compression as magnetic 
refrigeration.

Summary of Chapter 5
There are alternatives to refrigerants for achieving cooling effects; however, none can compete with 
the vapour compression cycle for medium to large scale application or for wide temperature ranges. 
Evaporative cooling and thermo-electric devices each have their niche and magnetic refrigeration 
is expected to gain popularity in the near future. Thermo-acoustic devices are largely only at the 
development stage.

Chilling and Freezing
6	 Chilling and Freezing
Food preservation is required due to the fact that there is typically a time lag between when a food 
is harvested and when it is consumed. Grains, fruits and vegetables, and animal products tend to be 
produced seasonally, while their consumption is relatively steady year-round. And even if production was 
steady, due to urbanisation time is required for the food to be transported from the rural areas where it is 
produced to the cities were the majority of it is consumed. Without some means of preservation, foods, 
particularly those with high moisture contents, are susceptible to contamination from micro-organisms 
including yeasts, moulds, fungi, bacteria and viruses. Even in the absence of foreign microbes, foods 
may still spoil due to the activity of enzymes and other biochemical processes within the food itself.
Worldwide, refrigeration and drying are probably the most common methods for preserving food. 
Refrigeration achieves preservation by lowering the temperature such that microbial populations do 
not grow at significant rates, and biochemical processes are slowed. Drying achieves preservation 
by lowering the moisture content to a point at which most microbes cannot survive. Of these two 
techniques, however, refrigeration has much less impact on the colour, structure and flavour of the food, 
and is therefore preferred as a preservation means for most foods, particularly in the Developed World. 
Drying (particularly sun-drying) is a lower-cost alternative for Developing Countries, particularly in 
rural settings.

Chilling and Freezing
It has been estimated in that in the first decade of the 21st Century about 360 million tonnes of perishable 
food was lost every year due to insufficient use of refrigeration, or poorly designed refrigeration systems. 
With the world’s population continuing to increase, and all the available arable land currently being 
used, refrigeration is going to be relied on more and more to reduce wastage and ensure the world’s 
population is sufficiently nourished. 
Food refrigeration is typically separated into two categories depending on whether any ice forms. 
Refrigeration to temperatures above the initial freezing point of food is called chilling; refrigeration 
below the initial temperature of the food is called freezing. The reason for this distinction is that it is 
often vital for the quality of the food that it is treated properly, e.g. most fruits and vegetables will suffer 
irreversible tissue damage if ice crystals are formed, and hence they must not be frozen. The physical 
mechanisms involved in chilling and freezing are also quite different, which is a further reason to analyse 
them separately.
By contrast with the domestic situation, industrially, the process of temperature reduction (‘chilling’ or 
‘freezing’) is often (but not always) performed in a different device/room than the process of temperature 
maintenance (‘cool’ or ‘cold storage’). Typically a devoted chiller/ freezer will have a relatively small 
product space, and relatively large refrigeration unit, while the cool/cold store will have a higher product 
space and comparatively small refrigeration unit. 
6.1	
Estimating Chilling times of food products
Once raw foods have been harvested (here ‘harvesting’ is used as an inclusive term for all foods meaning 
the process of extracting them from their natural environment) there is usually a relatively narrow window 
during which time they must be cooled from their harvested temperature to the storage or further 
processing temperature. Generally the cooling process is as fast as possible; however, the biochemical/
physiological make up of some foods places an upper limit on the rates at which they may be cooled. 
As will be discussed in Chapter 7, different foods have different requirements, and it is important that 
each type of food is cooled optimally in order to reduce product wastage, and maximise profit for the 
producer. It is helpful if we have some way to predict how long a food product will take to cool under 
certain conditions since this well help us to design or select a suitable cooling regime.
Recall that in Chapter 3 we discussed the cooling of regularly shaped objects, and mentioned that 
irregularly shaped objects could be modelled in a similar manner. For liquid foods we may simply 
use Eq. 3.16 (Chapter 3), provided we can determine the value of h (which may often be measured by 
performing a relatively straightforward experiment). For highly viscous or solid foods we use modified 
forms of Eq. 3.20 or, preferably, only the first term of the infinite series:

From Eq. (6.2) we see that the influence of the object’s shape (manifested by the parameters a and b) 
can be treated independently from the effect of time. Hence for any shape, if we are able to determine 
these shape-related factors, we can use Eq. (6.2) as the cooling model, provided there is no phase change 
(i.e. chilling processes only). 
The factors a and b can be determined empirically as a function of Bi, and this may be the simplest 
method for their determination for some shapes. Recall from Chapter 3 that the Biot number measures 
the relative resistance of heat transfer to or from the surface to the resistance to heat transfer from the 
centre of the object to its surface. It is a function of the product’s thickness, its thermal conductivity and 
the heat transfer coefficient at the product’s surface. Therefore, the range of Bi considered when measuring 
a and b should reflect the range of cooling conditions likely to be encountered (i.e. if the product is to 
be chilled in air, the range of Bi should reflect the range of air velocities likely to be encountered).
The cooling trials that would be required to determine a and b are relatively simple to perform; however, 
given the need to perform measurements over a range of Bi, a large number would need to be performed 
for a single product, which would be time-consuming and therefore expensive in a commercial setting. 
Fortunately, in many situations the slope and intercept of the cooling curve may be predicted. In practice 
a modified form of Eq. (6.2) is used:

The physical interpretation of the parameter f (often referred to as the ‘f-factor’) is that it is the time 
required for the dimensionless temperature to decrease by a factor of 10 (which is why the factor 2.303, 
which is equal to ln(10), is present in Eq. (6.5)). Note that the j-factor is given a subscript ‘0’ to indicate 
that it relates to the centre temperature, and a different factor will be required for off-centre temperatures.

The f and j0 parameters for the long cylinder and plane wall may be determined in a similar manner; 
however, for more complex shapes the determination of f and j0 will not be as trivial an exercise. 
The literature contains several methods for predicting their values. The relatively simple procedure of 
Hayakawa and Villalobos for determining the centre and/or mass average temperature is outlined here 
(and is also covered in the ASHRAE Handbook of Refrigeration). 
Firstly the object must be analysed in such a manner that the shortest distance (L) between the centre 
and the surface is identified (the radius in the case of the sphere) and from this a factor P1 is defined:

1.	 Obtain thermal properties of food product and heat transfer coefficient of cooling fluid
2.	 Calculate Bi from Eq. (3.22) with R = L (the shortest distance between centre an surface)
3.	 Estimate S1 and S2 and calculate P1 and P2 from Eqs. (6.8) and (6.9)

Chilling and Freezing
An alternative approach which will not be presented here is to employ the equivalent heat transfer 
dimensionality (refer the ASHRAE Handbook of Refrigeration listed in the Further Reading Section) 
which is slightly more elaborate, but is based on parameters that may, in some cases, be easier to identify 
than L, S1 and S2. 
For greater accuracy than may be expected from these semi-empirical methods for estimating chilling 
times, numerical methods are required. As might be expected, there are several software packages that 
have been developed specifically for calculating cooling times and heat loads. An example is the Food 
Product Modeller™ package that has been developed by AgResearch Ltd in New Zealand.
Example 6.1: Estimate the time required for a cucumber which has a diameter of 70 mm and 
a length of 200 mm, to cool from an initial uniform temperature of 35 °C to a mass average 
temperature of 4 °C when placed in a refrigerator set to maintain an air temperature of 2 °C, 
assuming a heat transfer coefficient of 50 W m-2 K-1.
Solution: It is useful in any transient heat transfer problem to calculate Bi initially. For irregular 
shapes the Bi is based on the shortest path from the centre to the surface of the object, and 
in this case is simply the radius. However, first we need to know the thermal conductivity 
of cucumber. Data for thermal properties of foods is available from a number of sources, 
including the ASHRAE Handbook of Refrigeration and the Food Properties Handbook (see 
Further Reading) especially for fruit vegetables, meat, poultry and dairy products. Where data 
are not available for a food (i.e. for a processed food), its thermal properties may be predicted 
from composition data, using models that are typically available from the same sources as the 
data. For high water-content foods such as fruits and vegetables, using the properties of water 
will often be suitable for a first approximation. In the case of cucumbers, data from the sources 
mentioned above are as follows: k = 0.59 W m-1 K-1, ρ = 950 kg m-3, Cp = 4090 J kg-1 K-1. Hence:

A schematic of the cucumber is shown in Figure 6.1, in which the areas S1 and S2 are indicated. 
We can assume that the cucumber has a perfectly circular cross-section in which case S1 will 
be equal to the cross-section area of a circle with a radius of 0.035 m, and P1 will be unity (by 
inspection of Eq. 6.8).

Figure 6.1: Schematic of the cucumber in Example 6.1
Cucumbers have rounded ends; however, since the length of the cucumber is several time 
greater than the diameter, the rate of heat transfer down the axis of the cucumber will not be 
as great as in the radial direction, so it will be sufficient for this sort of estimate to assume that 
the cross sectional area orthogonal to the cross-sectional area in the direction of the radius is 
simply the length of the cucumber multiplied by the diameter, i.e.:

Hence we would expect the cucumber to take approximately 1½ hours to cool. Note that in 
this problem we considered a single cucumber being chilled. In reality cucumbers would be 
cooled in bulk, and the physical (i.e. k, ρ and Cp) and transport (i.e. h) properties involved 
require more attention, but are beyond the scope of this text

Estimating heat loads of food products
Calculation of the heat load of a refrigeration process depends to some extent on the design of the 
refrigerator and in particular whether it is run under batch or continuous operation. For a continuous 
process (e.g. tunnel chiller where product passes through the chiller on a conveyer belt), it will probably 
be sufficient to divide the enthalpy change between the inlet and outlet by the residence time of the 
product in order to determine the average load:

In reality the cooling load will vary along the length of the tunnel, but Eq. (6.15) will often be sufficient 
as an estimate.
For a batch process (e.g. a carcass chiller, where the carcasses are placed in a refrigerated room, left there 
for a length of time), it is helpful to be able to model time-variable load. This may be achieved based 
on parameters calculated when estimating the chilling time. The time-variable heating load up to the 
point in time where:

Freezing and Thawing Time Prediction
A standard temperature history (i.e. cooling curve) of a chilling process follows a relatively simple 
exponential decay curve, as illustrated in Figures 3.4 and 3.5. By contrast, the temperature history of a 
freezing process has cusps and cannot be modeled simply by a continuous function. Figure 6.2 shows 
the freezing curves at three different positions in a pail of strawberry pulp.

Initially, the freezing curves follow an exponential decay, since above the initial freezing temperature it 
is simply a chilling process. Note that unlike pure water which has a distinct freezing temperature above 
which water is in the liquid state and below which water is in the frozen state, the freezing point of a 
solution only has a distinct starting point. Below the initial freezing point water still may exist in the 
liquid state, while water elsewhere has crystallised.

Chilling and Freezing
At the initial freezing temperature there is a noticeable temperature plateau at the centre and mass average 
positions, while the absolute magnitude of the slope of the surface (edge) temperature is significantly 
less than for the slope above the initial freezing temperature. These effects are due to the release of latent 
heat (or, more properly, enthalpy of fusion) as the ice crystals form.
The latent heat effects accompanying the formation of ice in a food product complicate the heat transfer 
analysis when compared to a chilling process; nevertheless a similar empirical approach to the one 
outlined in Section 6.1 may be employed. There are many freezing models within the literature, most 
of which have been based on Plank’s method from the early 20th Century; however, several studies have 
recommended that Pham’s method provides the greatest accuracy for a range of shapes and hence will 
be outlined here. The freezing time (tf) may be calculated from:

the plane wall, long cylinder and sphere respectively. Note that the plane wall and sphere represent the

between 1 and 3. ∆H1 and ∆T1 represent the contributions from the sensible heat above freezing, given

It is worth noting that thawing is not simply the reverse process of freezing since the formation of ice 
crystals often has an irreversible effect on the food’s structure. Cleland et al. developed a simple, semi-

and ∆H10 is the volumetric enthalpy change of the product between 0 and -10°C (which is significant,

Where ∆H1 and ∆H2 were defined by Eqs. 6.20 and 6.22. Methods for estimating time-variable heat loads 
during freezing may be found in the ASHRAE Handbook of Refrigeration.
Example 6.2: The frozen contents of a carton of lean beef cuts, 400 mm × 600 mm × 120 mm 
is thawed in still air. The uniform, initial temperature of the beef is -40 °C and the thawing air 
is at 10 °C, while the heat transfer coefficient is 15 W m-2 K-1. Calculate the time required for 
the mass average temperature of the block to reach 5 °C.
Solution: Obtaining data from the ASHRAE Handbook of Refrigeration, we have: ru = 1075 
kg m-3, rf = 1018 kg m-3, Cp,u = 3520 J kg-1 K-1, Cp,f = 2110 J kg-1 K-1; ku = 0.49 W m-1 K-1, kf = 
1.6 W m-1 K-1, Tf = -2 °C, ∆H10 = 210 MJ m-3.
Next we calculate Bi. The shortest distance between the centre and the surface is 60 mm (i.e. half 
the smallest of the three dimensions of the block). The thermal conductivity of the beef is quite 
different depending on its state; however, we will chose the frozen beef thermal conductivity, 
since the majority of the warming process occurs while there is at least some ice. Hence:

In order to calculate the equivalent heat transfer dimensionality, we need to determine the 
parameters S1, S2, P1 and P2 in the same manner that we did in Example 6.1. For a rectangular 
parallelepiped (i.e. a ‘brick’ or ‘block’ shape) the areas S1 and S2 are easy to calculate: S1 = 0.12 
x 0.4 = 0.024 m2, and S2 = 0.12 x 0.6 = 0.048 m2. Hence:

Summary of Chapter 6
In order to design suitable refrigerated facilities, one needs to know the chilling or freezing times of 
the product; this will then allow for the calculation of heat loads, and finally will allow the necessary 
refrigeration capacity to be determined. As first approximations, relatively simple, semi-empirical 
calculation procedures may be employed, provided the necessary input data (e.g. thermal properties, 
heat transfer coefficients, initial, target, and cooling medium temperatures) are available. For greater 
accuracy, numerical methods may be employed, and commercial software packages especially for this 
purpose have been developed.

7	 Food Refrigeration
Most people probably associate the term ‘refrigeration’ with the domestic refrigerator, which is reliable and 
simple to use, and is bought as a single unit containing both the chiller and the freezer. Industrially and 
commercially the situation is quite different. Not only will chillers and freezers often be entirely separate 
units, but the components of a refrigerator (compressor, condenser, expansion device and evaporator) 
will not necessarily be purchased at the same time, or necessarily from the same supplier. A single 
compressor may service multiple evaporators in different refrigerated environments; or alternatively 
multiple compressors may be required for a single chiller or freezer, if it has a large heat load. In fact, 
for a large refrigerated facility such as may be found at abattoirs there may be a number of compressors, 
condensers, expansions and evaporators all connected in a network, so that varying cooling capacity 
may be applied to different rooms as required.
On the industrial scale it is convenient to separate refrigeration applications into four categories: cooling 
a product to above its initial freezing temperature is known as ‘chilling’; maintaining it at temperatures 
above the initial freezing point, is known as ‘cool storage’; cooling a product below its initial freezing 
temperature is known as ‘freezing’; maintaining its temperature below its initial freezing temperate is 
known as ‘cold storage’. While these definitions are not always used, they are useful to bear in mind. In 
this chapter, ‘refrigerated environment’ is used as a general term to cover all four of these classes.
7.1	
The Domestic Refrigerator
Every reader of this book will be familiar with the ubiquitous domestic refrigerator. Modern ‘fridges’ are 
simple to use, durable and reliable. The most widely used model is the upright fridge/freezer, although 
units which only serve as ‘fridges’ or only as freezers are also common. The domestic fridge is almost 
invariably based on the vapour compression cycle; however, for a fridge/freezer unit the basic design is 
slightly different to the standard vapour compression cycle illustrated schematically in Figure 2.7c. This 
is because in order for the two compartments to be maintained at different temperatures (the fridge 
compartment typically at 4 °C and the freezer compartment typically at -18 °C), the expansion process 
needs to be separated into two stages. However, since typically only a single compressor is employed, 
the energy savings of multi-stage compression (as described in Chapter 2) are not possible. A schematic 
of the domestic refrigerator components is shown in Figure 7.1a with the corresponding PH diagram 
in Figure 7.1b.

Figure 7.1a shows the refrigerant passing through the fridge evaporator and freezer evaporator in series – 
an alternative, parallel arrangement is also possible. Note that the expansion valve is sometimes called a 
‘metering device’ since it can be used to control the flow of refrigerant (although its essential function is to 
reduce the pressure of the refrigerant). With variable-speed compressors which may be used to control the 
flow of refrigerant becoming more common, many modern domestic refrigerators achieve the expansion 
simply be crimping a restriction (throttle) into the refrigerant line – with no actual valve required.
7.2	
The Cold Chain
Most food will go through several different stages of chilling/freezing and cool/cold storage between the 
time it is harvested and the time it is consumed. To illustrate just how significant a role refrigeration plays in 
keeping us fed, consider frozen beef being exported from New Zealand to Europe. Immediately after it has 
been slaughtered and ‘dressed’ (i.e. had the head, hide, offal, tail etc. removed) a side of beef will be placed 
in a carcass chiller for a period of more than 24 hours. Following the chilling process it will be separated 
into different cuts in a ‘boning room’ maintained at about 10 °C and packed into cartons. These cartons 
will then be placed in a blast freezer before being stored frozen, until they are ready to be transported. 
When they are ready to be transported they will probably be loaded into refrigerated (‘reefer’) containers 
and placed on either a road or rail truck and taken to a seaport. At the port they will be loaded onto a ship 
which will sail to Europe, a journey that will take several weeks to complete. After being unloaded at the 
destination port, the beef will most likely be taken to a cold storage facility at the retailer’s warehouse. At 
some point the meat will be placed in a refrigerated retail display cabinet (e.g. at a supermarket) for sale. 
Once purchased, it will most likely spend some time in the customer’s domestic refrigerator.

Food Refrigeration
The journey of the beef from the abattoir to the customer’s home is referred to as the Cold Chain, since 
refrigeration plays such an important role at every stage of its journey. Some countries are net importers 
of food, meaning they rely on food from other countries to keep their population fed (e.g. Lebanon 
imports more than 80% of its food!). A robust, effective Cold Chain is obviously vital for feeding the 
ever-increasing global population. This means that at each stage (each ‘link’ in the ‘chain’) the product’s 
‘temperature integrity’ must be maintained (i.e. its temperature must be held between certain limits).
Failure in the cold chain is often due to poor handling and logistics, and can be responsible for loss of 
product during transportation, rejection of the product by the customer or retailer, or else food poisoning 
if it is unhygienic when consumed. 
7.3	
Typical examples of refrigerated facilities
Figure 7.2 shows a schematic of a typical, multi-purpose freezing facility. The facility is divided into 
cold stores accessed by a central air-lock passageway. The stores may each be maintained at different 
temperatures, while the air-lock will typically be the closest to ambient in temperature. For large facilities 
the stores will be accessible by forklift, and in some cases small trucks. Often a truck will be able to enter 
the air-lock at least, in order that it may be loaded under cool conditions.

Food Refrigeration
The access-ways in the facility need to be designed to minimize heat and moisture ingress to the stores. 
This may be achieved in a number of ways, but the most common ones include roller doors, strip 
curtains, and air curtains (i.e. jets of air that are sent down from vents above the doorways to provide 
positive pressure against the air within the store) or a combination of these. If no significant traffic into 
or out of a store is expected for significant periods, then a properly insulated door will be pulled across 
the access-way to achieve a near air-tight seal.
In one corner of two of the stores in Figure 7.2 is an air blast freezer. A schematic of a blast-freezer is 
shown in Figure 7.3.
Figure 7.3: Schematic of a blast freezer
Product, which typically has been pre-packaged, is placed onto racks which allow space for air-flow 
between the product boxes. The evaporator fans generate high velocities (>10 m s-1) to achieve high rates 
of freezing. Once a batch has been frozen, it will be removed and placed in the storage area outside the 
blast freezer, and a new batch will be placed in the blast freezer.
In addition to the generic cold-store and blast-freezer complex shown in Figure 7.2, there are some more 
specialised refrigeration facilities. A carcass chiller (illustrated schematically in Figure 7.4) is essentially 
a large room with a relatively low ceiling in which whole lamb carcasses, or pork or beef sides are hung 
on rails. Most carcass chillers will have some type of arrangement to ensure air is distributed throughout 
the chiller to minimise variation in chilling rates in different regions of the room. Some modern carcass 
chillers even use water spray, if permitted by regulatory bodies, to increase chilling rates and minimise 
weight loss. Carcasses are usually cooled for several hours before either being transported for sale whole, 
or more commonly packaged as individual cuts, often with the removal of significant amounts of fat and 
bone. The rooms where the carcasses are cut (sometimes referred to as ‘boning rooms’) also need to be 
maintained at temperatures well-below ambient (e.g. 10 °C).

Fruit and vegetable cool-stores are often fitted with equipment to control the composition of the gas 
in the room, in order to restrict the rate of ripening and/or reduce the moisture loss during storage. 
Controlled Atmosphere (CA) storage refers to the storage facilities in which the amounts of oxygen, 
nitrogen and carbon dioxide or monitored and controlled, often with oxygen levels lower than found in 
air. Modified Atmosphere (MA) storage (often part of the packaging) refers to environments in which 
the amount of oxygen is greatly reduced, or essentially removed altogether, and has been found to extend 
shelf-life significantly.

Most fishing vessels have on-board cold-storage facilities, since they may be away from port for weeks at 
a time. Some species are simply packed whole in ice in insulated rooms below deck, while other species 
may be partially ‘dressed’ (e.g. have their heads, guts and tails removed) on deck before being packed 
into boxes, frozen in a plate-freezer, and placed in a cold-store.
7.4	
Design Considerations
Regardless of the specific design of the chiller, freezer, cool- or cold-store, there are some general design 
considerations that apply.
7.4.1	
Capacity and Temperature
Probably the first decisions that need to be made are what quantity of product is expected to be cooled/
stored and at what temperature. For the chilling and freezing processes (as opposed to cool and cold 
storage), the initial temperature is also important. The quantity and temperatures of the product will 
determine the required capacity of the refrigeration (in terms of kW), using techniques similar to ones 
described in Chapter 6.
In addition to the heat load from the product, a number of other sources can contribute to the total heat 
load, depending on the type of refrigerated environment:
--
Heat infiltration through walls, floor, ceiling, pillars, beams etc. (should be minimised by 
good insulation)
--
Heat from warm, humid air coming in through doors or other access-ways (see Section 
7.4.3)
--
Heat from evaporator fans circulating the air in the refrigerated environment
--
Heat from lights
--
Heat of respiration (not only from humans present, but also from some products, fruit and 
vegetables in particular)
--
Heat from forklift trucks or other vehicles used to transfer product in
--
Heat from the defrost cycle (see Section 7.4.3)
The relative magnitudes of each component within the total heat load will vary widely between different 
refrigerated environments. Many of the components of the heat load may be determined using simple 
variations of Eq. 3.11. Once the total heat load has been estimated, and an appropriate design safety 
factor has been applied, the selection of the most effective compressor and refrigerant pairing (‘effective’ 
here being meant to include both energy efficiency and cost) may be made.

Food Refrigeration
7.4.2	
Air movement
The cooling medium for most refrigerated facilities is air. Typically the evaporators of the refrigeration 
system are located in one part of the refrigerated environment with fans being relied upon for circulating 
the air. One problem that can arise is that of ‘short-circuiting’, where cold air exiting the evaporator(s) 
is sucked back around to the inlet, without passing over most of the product. This will lead to relatively 
warm regions (‘hotspots’), resulting in significantly reduced cooling times, or product not reaching the 
required temperature at all. 
It may not be sufficient simply for air to be well-distributed in the head space above the product and in 
aisle spaces; significant air-flow through the product stacks may also be required in order to achieve not 
only the desired rate of cooling, but also uniform rates of cooling between product stacks in different parts 
of the refrigerated environment. In addition to the evaporator fans, which are standard, air movement 
can be aided by diffusers, vanes and ducting that can distribute the air optimally, at the expense of higher 
pressure drops needing to be overcome by the fans.
(Note that not all chillers and freezers use air, some rely on liquids such as water or an ‘anti-freeze’ 
solution, or by direct physical contact, in the case of plate freezers. However, most cool/cold stores use air).
7.4.3	
Control of moisture
It is almost impossible to prevent moisture entering refrigerated environments where it increases the 
cooling load (due its latent heat of evaporation), reduces the effectiveness of the evaporator (by causing 
frost and/or mould build-up on the heat exchange surface) and can also be a hazard, particularly in 
freezers and cold stores, where ice can build up on the floor and potentially result in slips. 
Moisture may enter the refrigerated environment as humidity in the air that accompanies staff and 
product when they enter, or from the product itself as it cools (e.g. carcass chillers and fruit stores in 
which the product can release significant quantities of moisture). Most chillers and cool-stores will have 
humidity control, since humidity is often a significant factor in determining the shelf-life of chilled 
products. Almost all evaporators will have some sort of defrost-mechanism, which typically involves 
heating the evaporator surface to melt any ice that has built-up (note that even chillers and cool-stores 
may have ice build-up, since the evaporator temperature may have to be below 0 °C, in order to maintain 
air temperatures of 0 to 4 °C). The heating of the evaporator surface may either be achieved externally, 
or by allowing some of the refrigerant exiting the compressor to bypass the condenser and expansion, 
and enter the evaporator as a hot vapour. The defrost cycle is an extra heat load, but is compensated for 
by the improved performance of the evaporator.

Measures are also taken to restrict the quantity of warm, humid air entering the refrigerated environment 
through the use of strip curtains and air curtains, and by management of the number of entries and exits 
to/from the refrigerated environment.
7.4.4	
Insulation
Effective insulation is critical for the efficiency of cool/cold stores. Ideally insulation is incorporated 
within the structural elements of the building when the facility is built, since this tends to result in the 
most durable arrangement. Spray-on, foam insulation may be used if an existing building has been 
converted to a cool/cold store. It is important to recognise that it is not only walls and doors that need 
to be insulated, but also ceilings and, for freezers and cold stores in particular, floors. 
Insulation should not only provide a barrier to heat transfer, it should also be effective as a moisture 
barrier. This is not only to prevent moisture ingress from outside, but also to prevent moisture from within 
the store permeating the insulating material, which can significantly reduce its effectiveness. Particular 
care is needed to ensure moisture barriers are maintained at joins between walls, floors and ceilings. 
Floor insulation is highly recommended for freezers and cold stores, to prevent ice forming in the soil 
below, which may then crack concrete floors as it expands (a phenomenon known as ‘frost heave’). The 
alternative would be to heat the soil underneath to prevent it from freezing, but would be an added 
running cost, not only from the direct heating cost, but also the added heat load from infiltration through 
the floor to the store.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

7.4.5	
Access-ways and traffic
Access-ways (mainly doors, but possibly hatches and windows) in cool/cold stores need to be practical in 
the sense that they need to be in convenient positions and large enough to allow stacks of product and 
its transportation (e.g. forklift trucks) to pass through. However, the larger the access-way the greater 
the amount of warm, moist air that can infiltrate the refrigerated environment, and if the access-way 
is too close to the evaporator fans, then cold air can be blown out at the same time that warm, moist 
air is sucked in. Strip curtains, air curtains and roller doors can help minimise these losses, but clearly 
optimisation is required to balance the potentially conflicting requirements of practicality and energy 
efficiency. Smart scheduling of the loading and unloading of refrigerated environments can also be used 
to minimise the number of accesses, and hence the quantities of cold air that is lost and warm, moist 
air that replaces it.
Cool/cold stores are often large enough to have forklift trucks driving around in them, and a storage 
facility may have a central air-lock (see Figure 7.2) that is large enough to contain a transportation truck, 
so that product can be loaded under cool conditions, out of direct sunlight. Where possible, electric 
vehicles should be used since they produce much less heat than petroleum-fuelled vehicles, and no 
moisture vapour exhaust. Electric forklifts are very common; however, the majority of transport vehicles 
are diesel-fuelled. Clearly, if a diesel truck is inside a store it should not be allowed to idle while it is 
being loaded, as often tends to be the case when trucks are loaded outside a store.
7.4.6	
Controlled and modified atmospheres
The design of controlled and modified atmosphere stores requires extra care and consideration, since 
they will need to be sealed sufficiently to prevent significant ingress and egress of gases. The number of 
accesses in a controlled atmosphere store should be minimal; in fact the ideal is for a batch of product to 
be loaded into the store, the store to be sealed, and then left until the required storage time has elapsed, at 
which point the entire batch is unloaded. However, this will not always be possible for logistical reasons.
7.5	
Refrigerated transport
Refrigerated transport vehicles may be thought of as special classes of cool/cold stores (and in some 
cases they also do some chilling and freezing). Road trucks, rail-trucks, ships and airplanes are all in use 
for transporting refrigerated food. Some vehicles only have thermal insulation and rely on the thermal 
mass of the product to maintain temperature integrity; however, many have their own active refrigeration 
system. Reefer containers in particular have become popular, since they are modular and can be used 
with road, rail and sea transportation, simply by plugging them into a power source.

Food Refrigeration
Most of the general design principles described in Section 7.4 apply to refrigerated transport; however, 
there are obviously extra considerations that need to be made. For example, a reefer container, which 
must draw its power from an external source, either mains power at a warehouse or the truck/train/ship 
transporting it, needs to be plugged in manually at the start of each stage of its journey – simple human 
error, could mean that is not. For frozen product, occasional lapses can be tolerated but for chilled product 
such a mistake can spoil the contents of an entire container. Hence a reefer is more likely to experience 
power failure than a permanent refrigerated building with hard wired power. Also, refrigeration systems 
on transports experience far more vibration and mechanical shock than permanent structures, and hence 
are more exposed to failure by wear and tear. The logistics associated with refrigerated transport is also, 
perhaps, a more difficult exercise than managing a cool/cold store facility since tracking the location 
and monitoring temperatures of the product is confined to a much smaller space.
Since there are typically a number of different parties involved in the cold chain of a particular product, 
it will not always be clear who is to blame if and when a failure occurs which results in the loss of 
product. Unsurprisingly there are frequent disputes between producer, transport companies, warehouse 
companies, port companies and retailers, many of which result in litigation. For this reason there has 
been, particularly in Developed Nations, greater efforts put into auditing the cold chain, using a variety 
of different methods to monitor the product’s temperature over time, and preferably to identify when a 
failure has occurred, and therefore who is culpable.

Food Refrigeration
Food products have different optimal transportation conditions – the most significant of which is the 
product temperature. Tables 7.1 to 7.3 show transportation conditions recommended by the International

Summary of Chapter 7
The ‘Cold Chain’ is the term given to the various refrigeration stages that a food (or pharmaceutical) 
product experiences between harvest/production and consumption. The term ‘chain’ is appropriate 
since the food may be spoiled by lack of temperature integrity (‘failure’) at any stage (‘link’) in the chain. 
Careful design and operation of refrigerated environments and good logistical management are required 
in order to maintain temperature integrity throughout the chain, thereby satisfying producer, retailer 
and customer, and, more importantly, allowing for a steady supply of food year round.

Air Conditioning 
8	 Air Conditioning 
‘Air conditioning’ is the term used to describe the supply of comfortable, healthy air to the interior of 
building. Often this requires the air to be cooled (i.e. refrigeration), but humidity regulation, air movement 
(ventilation), and dust and odour removal are also important. Comfortable room temperatures tend 
to be in the range of 19 °C to 25 °C, comfortable humidity levels tend to be in the range of 60 to 80% 
(at comfortable room temperatures), and air movement up to 0.25 m s-1 for ventilation is considered 
comfortable. However, since this is a book about refrigeration, this chapter will focus briefly on the 
refrigeration aspect of air conditioning.
8.1	
Air-conditioning Cooling Load Calculations
Air-conditioning for human comfort has slightly different aims compared to food refrigeration, in that 
we are not trying to reduce the core temperature of the human body. Instead we are concerned with 
removing the heat generated by the human body, by lighting and appliances that give off heat as a waste 
product, and also to cool fresh air from outside for ventilation purposes. For this reason, steady-state 
models similar to the ones discussed in Chapter 3 would be sufficient for estimating cooling loads.
8.1.1	
Heat load categories
Heat loads for air-conditioning can come from a variety of sources, which may be divided into two 
categories: internal heat loads and external heat loads.
Internal heat loads include:
--
Humans – a person involved in normal indoor activity will produce between 100 and 600 W 
depending on their age, size and specific activity (see Table 8.1). Hence a room filled with 
a large number of people can be a significant heat load, measuring in the region of several 
kilowatts.
--
Lighting – each light gives of a certain wattage and individual bulbs can be in the range of 
100 W.
--
Appliances/machines – large televisions, domestic refrigerators, washing machines, 
computers all give off heat while in use. Any appliance that uses electricity will produce heat 
as a waste product.

Air Conditioning 
External heat loads include:
--
Solar loads – the biggest solar gain is by sunlight shining through transparent surfaces such 
as windows. Sunlight heating walls and roofs can also add significantly to the heat load on 
a room, particularly if there is little thermal cladding. Estimating solar loads accurately is 
more complex than for internal gains, however, several sources (including those listed at the 
end of the chapter) provide relatively simple guides 
--
Hot winds – although typically much less of a factor than solar loads can be significant if 
there is poor thermal cladding on the building. Of course strong winds which are lower in 
temperature than the external surface temperature of the building will actually reduce heat 
loads

8.1.2	
Air conditioning heat load estimation procedure
The following procedure is adapted from the recommendations of Stoecker and Jones (listed at the end 
of the chapter):
1.	 Determine the design-basis external air temperature and humidity (i.e. the climate in the 
geographical region where the building is located). Typically this means using a conservative 
value, i.e. for cooling, the design might be based on the 98th percentile temperature (i.e. the 
value which the actual temperature is lower than for 98% of the time)
2.	 Select the desired air temperature and humidity within the building (e.g. 22 °C, 60 % 
humidity)
3.	 For each room being considered estimate the temperature in any adjacent rooms
4.	 Estimate the overall heat transfer coefficients (U) within each room
5.	 Estimate the rate of infiltration of air (including active ventilation) into the room
6.	 Determine the latitude, orientation, external shading that will affect solar heat-load 
calculations
7.	 Determine the thermal properties of the building and insulation materials and the heat 
transfer coefficients within the rooms

Air Conditioning 
8.	 Calculate the rate of heat gain into the room from external sources
9.	 Estimate the maximum number of people likely to be within each room, and their most 
active occupation
10.	Determine the amount of lighting and the power consumption of appliances/machines that 
will be within each room
11.	Sum the internal and external heat loads to estimate the required cooling capacity
Many of the steps above require location-specific and material specific data. Sources such as the ASHRAE 
Handbook of Fundamentals, contain much of this required data, particularly for buildings located within 
the United States. Once the required input data have been obtained most of the individual calculation 
steps are relatively straightforward (often being simple variations of Eq. 3.11), provided the procedures 
are followed correctly. The following example illustrates the types of calculation involved.
Example 8.1: Estimate the internal heat generation that could be expected for an office which 
will be occupied by 4 to 8 people, four lap-top computers, a small fridge and 10 fluorescent 
tube lights in the ceiling.

Solution: Indicative values for the power consumption of appliances are relatively simple 
to obtain, and is often indicated on the appliance itself (or from manufacturer’s data on the 
internet). A small fridge will draw about 200 W, while lap-top computers might draw 50 W 
each. Each tube light may be assumed to draw 30 W (including the ballast).
Since up to eight people may be expected to occupy the office we should use that number along 
with the data in Table 8.1 to estimate the heat load. Hence:

Note that in this example the largest internal heat load is from the occupants. The final value 
would be more meaningful if it could also be expressed on a per unit volume (of the room) 
basis, or at least on a per floor-area basis, since that will give an idea of the load density, as 
well as the total load.
8.2	
Domestic air-conditioning
Once the design conditions and cooling load have been determined, an appropriate air-conditioner may 
be selected. For most domestic applications, air-conditioners are based on the vapour-compression cycle, 
although evaporative coolers are popular in hot, dry climates (see Chapter 5). The operation principle of 
the air-conditioner is identical to that of the food refrigerator, as outlined in Chapter 2, with the same 
four essential components (namely the compressor, condenser, expander and evaporator). The main 
difference between the air-conditioner and food refrigerator is in its mechanical design (obviously, it 
does not have an enclosed product space). Even for a domestic unit, it may not be a single physically 
contiguous unit (by contrast with the domestic refrigerator). 
Perhaps the most common design option in current use in a number of countries outside the tropics is 
the split, invertible heat pump, which is illustrated schematically in Figure 8.1.

8.3	
Large-scale air-conditioning
Simple ‘package’ heat pump/air conditioners may be most practical and economical for the domestic 
setting, but for larger scales a more integrated approach will often be more effective (although large 
buildings sometimes have numerous individual domestic-scale air conditioners). In a large building there 
may be several heat sources and several heat sinks. In this case individual heat pumps can be combined in 
a network which also contains Air Handling Units (AHUs). Water is often used as a secondary refrigerant 
to transport heat away from one space to another.
In recent times data centres (i.e. rooms that house file servers and other computing equipment) have 
become a special air-conditioning application. The heat generation density (i.e. watts generated per 
square metre of floor area) can be significantly higher than for a room occupied mainly by people. 
In cold climates, large volumetric flow-rates of air may be sufficient to keep the centre at the required 
temperature; however, water will need to be used as a medium for carrying the heat, due to the high heat 
generation density. Where possible evaporative cooling will be employed, but if the long-term wet-bulb 
temperature of the ambient air is not sufficiently low (i.e. warm, humid climates) then air conditioning, 
or refrigeration of the cooling water will be required.

Summary of Chapter 8
‘Air conditioning’ refers to the process of achieving and maintaining air within certain constraints of 
temperature, humidity, and freshness. From a temperature management perspective, it is an identical 
process to refrigeration, usually employing the vapour-compression cycle (with the notable exception 
of evaporative coolers in hot, dry climates). Many air conditioners can be used to provide both cooling 
and heating (heat pumping) by redirecting the flow of refrigerant within the system.

9.1	
Cryogenics
The term ‘cryogenic’ refers to low temperatures, and while there is no universally agreed upon threshold 
defining the start of the cryogenic temperature range, it is in the vicinity of -100 °C to -150 °C. Cryogenics 
finds applications in the following fields:
--
Transportation of natural gas
--
Electricity transmission (the lower the temperature the lower the transmission losses)
--
Superconductivity research and modern physics (e.g. in CERN’s Large Hadron Collider)
--
Cryo-surgery
--
MRI and other analytical tools
--
Rocket propulsion (liquid hydrogen as the fuel, liquid oxygen as the oxidiser)
--
Long-term storage of biological media (e.g. blood and sperm)
--
Industrial applications 
The search for the lowest achievable temperature is a field of research in itself, as workers strive to get 
closer and closer to absolute zero.
Cryogenic refrigeration is most commonly achieved by allowing a liquefied gas to evaporate to the 
atmosphere. This is a very simple method of maintaining a steady, low temperature. Table 9.1 shows the 
normal boiling points (i.e. boiling points at atmospheric pressure) of a selection of gases.

Liquid nitrogen is perhaps the most widely used cryogenic refrigerant, while liquid helium achieves the 
lowest temperatures. Since we do not find the gases listed in Table 9.2 occurring naturally in the pure, 
liquid state, clearly there needs to be some way of producing them.

Cryogenics and Gas Liquefaction 
9.2	
Gas Liquefaction
In order to liquefy a gas using the standard vapour compression cycle, we would need a refrigerant with 
a very low evaporation temperature – lower than the boiling point of the gas we are trying to liquefy. 
Instead we essentially use the gas we are trying to liquefy as the refrigerant, and use the cooling effect that 
accompanies the expansion of gases under most (but not all!) conditions. Figure 9.1a shows a schematic 
of a gas liquefaction process, and Figure 9.1b shows the cycle on a TS diagram.

Figure 9.1: Gas liquefaction process, a) schematic diagram, b) TS diagram
To achieve the lowest temperature from an expansion process, we want the gas to be at as high a pressure 
as possible, and as low a temperature as possible at the inlet to the valve or throttle. Consider a gas at 
ambient conditions before it enters the compressor (State 1 in figure 9.1). If we compress it isentropically 
its temperature will increase (State 2). We should cool it isobarically down to as low a temperature as 
possible, firstly using some external cooling (State 3), but also relying on the fraction of gas that is 
not liquefied by the expansion process (State 4). Once we have cooled the gas as much as possible it is 
expanded through a throttle or valve into a flash drum (State 5) where a fraction of the gas is liquefied 
(State 9) and is the product, while the un-liquefied gas (State 6) is returned to the compressor via the 
regenerator where it transfers heat to the compressed gas which is being cooled prior to expansion. After 
the regenerator (State 7) the gas is mixed with make-up feed gas (State 8) before the cycle is repeated.
Referring to the TS diagram (Figure 9.1b), the closer State 5 is to State 9, the greater the fraction of 
liquid that is produced, and hence the more efficient the process is (on a mass basis). The work required 
to get the gas from State 1 to State 3 may be reduced significantly by using multi-stage compression. We 
could also potentially recover some work by expanding the gas through a turbine down to the start of 
the two-phase region, followed by expansion through a throttle for the remainder.

Cryogenics and Gas Liquefaction 
The liquefaction process is generally energy intensive, due to the large work of compression that is required 
as well as the need for external cooling, and hence cryogenic refrigeration tends to be very expensive 
(typically an order of magnitude more expensive than conventional vapour-compression refrigeration).
9.3	
Summary of Chapter 9
Cryogenics refers to the study, production and application of low temperature. Simple cryogenic 
refrigerators operate by allowing a liquefied gas to evaporate at atmospheric pressure. Gases are liquefied 
by a process similar to the vapour compression cycle; however, the gas itself is essentially the working fluid.
