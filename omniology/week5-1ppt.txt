Respiratory System 
PRIMARY ROLES 
Provide O2 for oxidative metabolism 
    which generates ATP & CO2. 
 
Regulate the body’s H+ concentration (pH).  
 
Host defense – 70 m2, 10,000 liters a day 
KEY CONCEPT  
Flow (F) = pressure gradient (   P)/ resistance (R) 
 
R is related to radius of the tube – 1/r4

Lung Airways 
CONDUCTING (trachea, bronchi, 
bronchioles) – 150 ml 
- Cleanses, warms,  & moistens air 
- Distributes air to deeper parts of 
the lung 
- Dilation/constriction of smooth 
muscle determines ease of air 
flow 
- Defense – mucociliary transport 
system 
 
RESPIRATORY (alveoli)– 3 L 
- Gases exchange between  alveoli 
and capillaries

Alveolar-capillary interface = blood-gas interface. This is also called the respiratory membrane. 
= ~ 70 sq meters for gas exchange! 
Type I cells - gas exchange 
Type II - stem cells that secrete  
surfactant

Ventilation & Lung Mechanics  
Negative pressure breathing 
 
diaphragm – when contracts goes 
from a dome to a flat sheet 
 
 
muscles of the rib cage – more during 
exercise, lifts ribs 
 
exhalation – inspiration muscles  
   relax, elastic recoil of lung

Inspiration (inhalation) uses skeletal muscles to 
expand  thoracic cavity & lung airways. Pressure falls 
within them and air enters. 
Air enters when Patm > PA 
Air leaves when Patm < PA 
Between breathes, Patm = PA so F = 0

Air enters when Patm > PA 
Air leaves when Patm < PA 
Between breathes, Patm = PA so F = 0 
Expiration (exhalation) is passive, as the thoracic cavity 
and lung return to normal dimensions, pressure rises and 
air is forced out.  
Ventilation is exchange of air between atmosphere and 
alveoli.

Ventilation Cycle 
 
•
Ventilation Cycle  = one inspiration and one expiration. 
 
•
Frequency of ventilation (f) is in the range of 10-18 breaths 
per min.  
 
•
Tidal volume (TV) is ~0.5 L/breath 
 
•
Minute Ventilation (VE) = TV x f  = 0.5L/breath x 10 
breaths/min = 5L/min 
 
•
Both the depth and rate can be changed by output from 
the respiratory centers in the brain stem.   
 
•
During heavy exercise, air flow can increase 20-fold and 
blood flow 3- fold. To expel such increased volumes, active 
exhalation is required in which abdominal muscles and 
external intercostal muscles contract.  

Key Concepts 
•
The lung provides an interface for gas exchange (O2 
and CO2) between the atmosphere and the blood. It 
contains dead space (conducting zone) and the 
alveolar space (respiratory zone).  
 
•
Breathing (ventilation cycle) is the process of moving 
air into (inhalation, inspiration) and out (exhalation, 
expiration) of the lungs.   
 
•
During inspiration, skeletal muscles contract to 
expand the chest cavity. Alveoli expand passively, 
alveolar air pressure drops and air enters. During 
normal quiet expiration, muscles relax, the lungs 
return to their original volume due to recoil of elastic 
fibers within the lung and air exits.
