Preface to the Millennium Edition
The original 1981 edition of A Course in Universal Algebra has now been
LaTeXed so the authors could make the out-of-print Springer-Verlag Gradu-
ate Texts in Mathematics edition available once again, with corrections. The
subject of Universal Algebra has ﬂourished mightily since 1981, and we still
believe that A Course in Universal Algebra oﬀers an excellent introduction
to the subject.
Special thanks go to Lis D’Alessio for the superb job of LaTeXing this
edition, and to NSERC for their support which has made this work possible.

Acknowledgments
First we would like to express gratitude to our colleagues who have added so much vital-
ity to the subject of Universal Algebra during the past twenty years. One of the original
reasons for writing this book was to make readily available the beautiful work on sheaves
and discriminator varieties which we had learned from, and later developed with H. Werner.
Recent work of, and with, R. McKenzie on structure and decidability theory has added to
our excitement, and conviction, concerning the directions emphasized in this book.
In the late stages of polishing the manuscript we received valuable suggestions from
M. Valeriote, W. Taylor, and the reviewer for Springer-Verlag. For help in proof-reading we
also thank A. Adamson, M. Albert, D. Higgs, H. Kommel, G. Krishnan, and H. Riedel. A
great deal of credit for the existence of the ﬁnal product goes to Sandy Tamowski whose
enthusiastic typing has been a constant inspiration. The Natural Sciences and Engineering
Research Council of Canada has generously funded both the research which has provided
much of the impetus for writing this book as well as the preparation of the manuscript
through NSERC Grant No. A7256. Also thanks go to the Pure Mathematics Department of
the University of Waterloo for their kind hospitality during the several visits of the second
author, and to the Institute of Mathematics, Federal University of Bahia, for their generous
cooperation in this venture.
The second author would most of all like to express his aﬀectionate gratitude and ap-
preciation to his wife—Nalinaxi—who, over the past four years has patiently endured the
many trips between South and North America which were necessary for this project. For
her understanding and encouragement he will always be indebted.

Preface
Universal algebra has enjoyed a particularly explosive growth in the last twenty years, and
a student entering the subject now will ﬁnd a bewildering amount of material to digest.
This text is not intended to be encyclopedic; rather, a few themes central to universal
algebra have been developed suﬃciently to bring the reader to the brink of current research.
The choice of topics most certainly reﬂects the authors’ interests.
Chapter I contains a brief but substantial introduction to lattices, and to the close con-
nection between complete lattices and closure operators. In particular, everything necessary
for the subsequent study of congruence lattices is included.
Chapter II develops the most general and fundamental notions of universal algebra—
these include the results that apply to all types of algebras, such as the homomorphism and
isomorphism theorems. Free algebras are discussed in great detail—we use them to derive
the existence of simple algebras, the rules of equational logic, and the important Mal’cev
conditions. We introduce the notion of classifying a variety by properties of (the lattices of)
congruences on members of the variety. Also, the center of an algebra is deﬁned and used to
characterize modules (up to polynomial equivalence).
In Chapter III we show how neatly two famous results—the refutation of Euler’s con-
jecture on orthogonal Latin squares and Kleene’s characterization of languages accepted by
ﬁnite automata—can be presented using universal algebra. We predict that such “applied
universal algebra” will become much more prominent.
Chapter IV starts with a careful development of Boolean algebras, including Stone du-
ality, which is subsequently used in our study of Boolean sheaf representations; however,
the cumbersome formulation of general sheaf theory has been replaced by the considerably
simpler deﬁnition of a Boolean product. First we look at Boolean powers, a beautiful tool
for transferring results about Boolean algebras to other varieties as well as for providing a
structure theory for certain varieties. The highlight of the chapter is the study of discrimi-
nator varieties. These varieties have played a remarkable role in the study of spectra, model
companions, decidability, and Boolean product representations. Probably no other class of
varieties is so well-behaved yet so fascinating.
The ﬁnal chapter gives the reader a leisurely introduction to some basic concepts, tools,
and results of model theory. In particular, we use the ultraproduct construction to derive the
compactness theorem and to prove fundamental preservation theorems. Principal congruence

Preface
formulas are a favorite model-theoretic tool of universal algebraists, and we use them in the
study of the sizes of subdirectly irreducible algebras. Next we prove three general results on
the existence of a ﬁnite basis for an equational theory. The last topic is semantic embeddings,
a popular technique for proving undecidability results. This technique is essentially algebraic
in nature, requiring no familiarity whatsoever with the theory of algorithms. (The study
of decidability has given surprisingly deep insight into the limitations of Boolean product
representations.)
At the end of several sections the reader will ﬁnd selected references to source material
plus state of the art texts or papers relevant to that section, and at the end of the book one
ﬁnds a brief survey of recent developments and several outstanding problems.
The material in this book divides naturally into two parts. One part can be described
as “what every mathematician (or at least every algebraist) should know about universal
algebra.” It would form a short introductory course to universal algebra, and would consist
of Chapter I; Chapter II except for §4, §12, §13, and the last parts of §11, §14; Chapter
IV §1–4; and Chapter V §1 and the part of §2 leading to the compactness theorem. The
remaining material is more specialized and more intimately connected with current research
in universal algebra.
Chapters are numbered in Roman numerals I through V, the sections in a chapter are
given by Arabic numerals, §1, §2, etc. Thus II§6.18 refers to item 18, which happens to
be a theorem, in Section 6 of Chapter II. A citation within Chapter II would simply refer
to this item as 6.18. For the exercises we use numbering such as II§5 Exercise 4, meaning
the fourth exercise in §5 of Chapter II. The bibliography is divided into two parts, the ﬁrst
containing books and survey articles, and the second research papers. The books and survey
articles are referred to by number, e.g., G. Birkhoﬀ[3], and the research papers by year, e.g.,
R. McKenzie [1978].

Preliminaries
We have attempted to keep our notation and conventions in agreement with those of the
closely related subject of model theory, especially as presented in Chang and Keisler’s Model
Theory [8]. The reader needs only a modest exposure to classical algebra; for example he
should know what groups and rings are.
We will assume a familiarity with the most basic notions of set theory. Actually, we use
classes as well as sets. A class of sets is frequently called a family of sets. The notations,
Ai, i ∈I, and (Ai)i∈I refer to a family of sets indexed by a set I. A naive theory of sets
and classes is suﬃcient for our purposes. We assume the reader is familiar with membership
(∈), set-builder notation ({—:—}), subset (⊆), union (∪), intersection (∩), diﬀerence (−),
ordered n-tuples (⟨x1, . . . , xn⟩), (direct) products of sets (A×B, Q
i∈I Ai), and (direct) powers
of sets (AI). Also, it is most useful to know that
(a) concerning relations:
(i) an n-ary relation on a set A is a subset of An;
(ii) if n = 2 it is called a binary relation on A;
(iii) the inverse rˇ of a binary relation r on A is speciﬁed by ⟨a, b⟩∈rˇ iﬀ⟨b, a⟩∈r;
(iv) the relational product r◦s of two binary relations r, s on A is given by: ⟨a, b⟩∈r◦s
iﬀfor some c, ⟨a, c⟩∈r, ⟨c, b⟩∈s;
(b) concerning functions:
(i) a function f from a set A to a set B, written f : A →B, is a subset of A × B
such that for each a ∈A there is exactly one b ∈B with ⟨a, b⟩∈f; in this case
we write f(a) = b or f : a 7→b;
(ii) the set of all functions from A to B is denoted by BA;
(iii) the function f ∈BA is injective (or one-to-one) if f(a1) = f(a2) ⇒a1 = a2;
(iv) the function f ∈BA is surjective (or onto) if for every b ∈B there is an a ∈A
with f(a) = b;

Preliminaries
(v) the function f ∈BA is bijective if it is both injective and surjective;
(vi) for f ∈BA and X ⊆A, f(X) = {b ∈B : f(a) = b for some a ∈X};
(vii) for f ∈BA and Y ⊆B, f −1(Y ) = {a ∈A : f(a) ∈Y };
(viii) for f : A →B and g : B →C, let g ◦f : A →C be the function deﬁned by
(g ◦f)(a) = g(f(a)). [This does not agree with the relational product deﬁned
above—but the ambiguity causes no problem in practice.];
(c) given a family F of sets, the union of F, S F, is deﬁned by a ∈S F iﬀa ∈A for some
A ∈F (deﬁne the intersection of F, T F, dually);
(d) a chain of sets C is a family of sets such that for each A, B ∈C either A ⊆B or
B ⊆A;
(e) Zorn’s lemma says that if F is a nonempty family of sets such that for each chain C of
members of F there is a member of F containing S C (i.e., C has an upper bound in
F) then F has a maximal member M (i.e., M ∈F and M ⊆A ∈F implies M = A);
(f) concerning ordinals:
(i) the ordinals are generated from the empty set ∅using the operations of successor
(x+ = x ∪{x}) and union;
(ii) 0 = ∅, 1 = 0+, 2 = 1+, etc.; the ﬁnite ordinals are 0, 1, . . .; and n = {0, 1, . . ., n−
1}; the natural numbers are 1, 2, 3 . . ., the nonzero ﬁnite ordinals;
(iii) the ﬁrst inﬁnite ordinal is ω = {0, 1, 2, . . .};
(iv) the ordinals are well-ordered by the relation ∈, also called <;
(g) concerning cardinality:
(i) two sets A and B have the same cardinality if there is a bijection from A to B;
(ii) the cardinals are those ordinals κ such that no earlier ordinal has the same car-
dinality as κ. The ﬁnite cardinals are 0, 1, 2, . . .; and ω is the smallest inﬁnite
cardinal;
(iii) the cardinality of a set A, written |A|, is that (unique) cardinal κ such that A and
κ have the same cardinality;
(iv) |A| · |B| = |A × B| [= max(|A|, |B|) if either is inﬁnite and A, B ̸= ∅] . A ∩B =
∅⇒|A| + |B| = |A ∪B| [= max(|A|, |B|) if either is inﬁnite];
(h) one usually recognizes that a class is not a set by noting that it is too big to be put in
one-to-one-correspondence with a cardinal (for example, the class of all groups).

3
In Chapter IV the reader needs to know the basic deﬁnitions from point set topology,
namely what a topological space, a closed (open) set, a subbasis (basis) for a topological space,
a closed (open) neighborhood of a point, a Hausdorﬀspace, a continuous function, etc., are.
The symbol “=” is used to express the fact that both sides name the same object, whereas
“≈” is used to build equations which may or may not be true of particular elements. (A
careful study of ≈is given in Chapter II.)


Chapter I
Lattices
In the study of the properties common to all algebraic structures (such as groups, rings, etc.)
and even some of the properties that distinguish one class of algebras from another, lattices
enter in an essential and natural way. In particular, congruence lattices play an important
role. Furthermore, lattices, like groups or rings, are an important class of algebras in their
own right, and in fact one of the most beautiful theorems in universal algebra, Baker’s ﬁnite
basis theorem, was inspired by McKenzie’s ﬁnite basis theorem for lattices. In view of this
dual role of lattices in relation to universal algebra, it is appropriate that we start with a
brief study of them. In this chapter the reader is acquainted with those concepts and results
from lattice theory which are important in later chapters. Our notation in this chapter is
less formal than that used in subsequent chapters. We would like the reader to have a casual
introduction to the subject of lattice theory.
The origin of the lattice concept can be traced back to Boole’s analysis of thought and
Dedekind’s study of divisibility. Schroeder and Pierce were also pioneers at the end of the
last century. The subject started to gain momentum in the 1930’s and was greatly promoted
by Birkhoﬀ’s book Lattice Theory in the 1940’s.
§1.
Deﬁnitions of Lattices
There are two standard ways of deﬁning lattices—one puts them on the same (algebraic)
footing as groups or rings, and the other, based on the notion of order, oﬀers geometric
insight.
Deﬁnition 1.1. A nonempty set L together with two binary operations ∨and ∧(read
“join” and “meet” respectively) on L is called a lattice if it satisﬁes the following identities:
L1: (a) x ∨y ≈y ∨x
(b) x ∧y ≈y ∧x
(commutative laws)
L2: (a) x ∨(y ∨z) ≈(x ∨y) ∨z
5

6
I Lattices
(b) x ∧(y ∧z) ≈(x ∧y) ∧z
(associative laws)
L3: (a) x ∨x ≈x
(b) x ∧x ≈x
(idempotent laws)
L4: (a) x ≈x ∨(x ∧y)
(b) x ≈x ∧(x ∨y)
(absorption laws).
Example. Let L be the set of propositions, let ∨denote the connective “or” and ∧denote
the connective “and”. Then L1 to L4 are well-known properties from propositional logic.
Example. Let L be the set of natural numbers, let ∨denote the least common multiple
and ∧denote the greatest common divisor. Then properties L1 to L4 are easily veriﬁable.
Before introducing the second deﬁnition of a lattice we need the notion of a partial order
on a set.
Deﬁnition 1.2. A binary relation ≤deﬁned on a set A is a partial order on the set A if the
following conditions hold identically in A:
(i) a ≤a
(reﬂexivity)
(ii) a ≤b and b ≤a imply a = b
(antisymmetry)
(iii) a ≤b and b ≤c imply a ≤c
(transitivity).
If, in addition, for every a, b in A
(iv) a ≤b or b ≤a
then we say ≤is a total order on A. A nonempty set with a partial order on it is called a
partially ordered set, or more brieﬂy a poset, and if the relation is a total order then we speak
of a totally ordered set, or a linearly ordered set, or simply a chain. In a poset A we use the
expression a < b to mean a ≤b but a ̸= b.
Examples. (1) Let Su(A) denote the power set of A, i.e., the set of all subsets of A. Then
⊆is a partial order on Su(A).
(2) Let A be the set of natural numbers and let ≤be the relation “divides.” Then ≤is
a partial order on A.
(3) Let A be the set of real numbers and let ≤be the usual ordering. Then ≤is a total
order on A.
Most of the concepts developed for the real numbers which involve only the notion of
order can be easily generalized to partially ordered sets.
Deﬁnition 1.3. Let A be a subset of a poset P. An element p in P is an upper bound for
A if a ≤p for every a in A. An element p in P is the least upper bound of A (l.u.b. of A),
or supremum of A (sup A) if p is an upper bound of A, and a ≤b for every a in A implies

§1. Deﬁnitions of Lattices

p ≤b (i.e., p is the smallest among the upper bounds of A). Similarly we can deﬁne what it
means for p to be a lower bound of A, and for p to be the greatest lower bound of A (g.l.b.
of A), also called the inﬁmum of A (inf A). For a, b in P we say b covers a, or a is covered
by b, if a < b, and whenever a ≤c ≤b it follows that a = c or c = b. We use the notation
a ≺b to denote a is covered by b. The closed interval [a, b] is deﬁned to be the set of c in P
such that a ≤c ≤b, and the open interval (a, b) is the set of c in P such that a < c < b.
Posets have the delightful characteristic that we can draw pictures of them.
Let us
describe in detail the method of associating a diagram, the so-called Hasse diagram, with
a ﬁnite poset P. Let us represent each element of P by a small circle “◦”. If a ≺b then
we draw the circle for b above the circle for a, joining the two circles with a line segment.
From this diagram we can recapture the relation ≤by noting that a < b holds iﬀfor some
ﬁnite sequence of elements c1, . . . , cn from P we have a = c1 ≺c2 · · · cn−1 ≺cn = b. We have
drawn some examples in Figure 1. It is not so clear how one would draw an inﬁnite poset.
For example, the real line with the usual ordering has no covering relations, but it is quite
common to visualize it as a vertical line. Unfortunately, the rational line would have the
same picture. However, for those inﬁnite posets for which the ordering is determined by the
covering relation it is often possible to draw diagrams which do completely convey the order
relation to the viewer; for example, consider the diagram in Figure 2 for the integers under
the usual ordering.

Drawing the poset of the integers
Now let us look at the second approach to lattices.
Deﬁnition 1.4. A poset L is a lattice iﬀfor every a, b in L both sup{a, b} and inf{a, b} exist
(in L).
The reader should verify that for each of the diagrams in Figure 1 the corresponding
poset is a lattice, with the exception of (e). The poset corresponding to diagram (e) does
have the interesting property that every pair of elements has an upper bound and a lower
bound.
We will now show that the two deﬁnitions of a lattice are equivalent in the following
sense: if L is a lattice by one of the two deﬁnitions then we can construct in a simple and
uniform fashion on the same set L a lattice by the other deﬁnition, and the two constructions
(converting from one deﬁnition to the other) are inverses. First we describe the constructions:
(A) If L is a lattice by the ﬁrst deﬁnition, then deﬁne ≤on L by a ≤b iﬀa = a ∧b;
(B) If L is a lattice by the second deﬁnition, then deﬁne the operations ∨and ∧by a∨b =
sup{a, b}, and a ∧b = inf{a, b}.
Suppose that L is a lattice by the ﬁrst deﬁnition and ≤is deﬁned as in (A). From a∧a = a
follows a ≤a. If a ≤b and b ≤a then a = a ∧b and b = b ∧a; hence a = b. Also if a ≤b
and b ≤c then a = a ∧b and b = b ∧c, so a = a ∧b = a ∧(b ∧c) = (a ∧b) ∧c = a ∧c; hence
a ≤c. This shows ≤is a partial order on L. From a = a ∧(a ∨b) and b = b ∧(a ∨b) follow
a ≤a ∨b and b ≤a ∨b, so a ∨b is an upper bound of both a and b. Now if a ≤u and b ≤u
then a ∨u = (a ∧u) ∨u = u, and likewise b ∨u = u, so (a ∨u) ∨(b ∨u) = u ∨u = u; hence
(a ∨b) ∨u = u, giving (a ∨b) ∧u = (a ∨b) ∧[(a ∨b) ∨u] = a ∨b (by the absorption law),
and this says a ∨b ≤u. Thus a ∨b = sup{a, b}. Similarly, a ∧b = inf{a, b}.
If, on the other hand, we are given a lattice L by the second deﬁnition, then the
reader should not ﬁnd it too diﬃcult to verify that the operations ∨and ∧as deﬁned
in (B) satisfy the requirements L1 to L4, for example the absorption law L4(a) becomes
a = sup{a, inf{a, b}}, which is clearly true as inf{a, b} ≤a.
The fact that these two constructions (A) and (B) are inverses is now an easy matter to
check. Throughout the text we will be using the word lattice to mean lattice by the ﬁrst
deﬁnition (with the two operations join and meet), but it will often be convenient to freely
make use of the corresponding partial order.

Isomorphic Lattices, and Sublattices
The word isomorphism is used to signify that two structures are the same except for the
nature of their elements (for example, if the elements of a group are painted blue, one still
has essentially the same group). The following deﬁnition is a special case of II§2.1.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Two lattices L1 and L2 are isomorphic if there is a bijection α from L1 to
L2 such that for every a, b in L1 the following two equations hold: α(a ∨b) = α(a) ∨α(b)
and α(a ∧b) = α(a) ∧α(b). Such an α is called an isomorphism.
It is useful to note that if α is an isomorphism from L1 to L2 then α−1 is an isomorphism
from L2 to L1, and if β is an isomorphism from L2 to L3 then β ◦α is an isomorphism from
L1 to L3. One can reformulate the deﬁnition of isomorphism in terms of the corresponding
order relations.
Deﬁnition 2.2. If P1 and P2 are two posets and α is a map from P1 to P2, then we say α
is order-preserving if α(a) ≤α(b) holds in P2 whenever a ≤b holds in P1.
Theorem 2.3. Two lattices L1 and L2 are isomorphic iﬀthere is a bijection α from L1 to
L2 such that both α and α−1 are order-preserving.
Proof. If α is an isomorphism from L1 to L2 and a ≤b holds in L1 then a = a ∧b, so
α(a) = α(a ∧b) = α(a) ∧α(b), hence α(a) ≤α(b), and thus α is order-preserving. As α−1 is
an isomorphism, it is also order-preserving.
Conversely, let α be a bijection from L1 to L2 such that both α and α−1 are order-
preserving.
For a, b in L1 we have a ≤a ∨b and b ≤a ∨b, so α(a) ≤α(a ∨b) and
α(b) ≤α(a∨b), hence α(a)∨α(b) ≤α(a∨b). Furthermore, if α(a)∨α(b) ≤u then α(a) ≤u
and α(b) ≤u, hence a ≤α−1(u) and b ≤α−1(u), so a ∨b ≤α−1(u), and thus α(a ∨b) ≤u.
This implies that α(a)∨α(b) = α(a∨b). Similarly, it can be argued that α(a)∧α(b) = α(a∧b).

It is easy to give examples of bijections α between lattices which are order-preserving but
are not isomorphisms; for example, consider the map α(a) = a, . . . , α(d) = d where L1 and
L2 are the two lattices in Figure 3.
A sublattice of a lattice L is a subset of L which is a lattice in its own right, using the
same operations.
Deﬁnition 2.4. If L is a lattice and L′ ̸= ∅is a subset of L such that for every pair of
elements a, b in L′ both a ∨b and a ∧b are in L′, where ∨and ∧are the lattice operations
of L, then we say that L′ with the same operations (restricted to L′) is a sublattice of L.
If L′ is a sublattice of L then for a, b in L′ we will of course have a ≤b in L′ iﬀa ≤b in
L. It is interesting to note that given a lattice L one can often ﬁnd subsets which as posets
(using the same order relation) are lattices, but which do not qualify as sublattices as the
operations ∨and ∧do not agree with those of the original lattice L. The example in Figure
4 illustrates this, for note that P = {a, c, d, e} as a poset is indeed a lattice, but P is not a
sublattice of the lattice {a, b, c, d, e}.

Deﬁnition 2.5. A lattice L1 can be embedded into a lattice L2 if there is a sublattice of L2
isomorphic to L1; in this case we also say L2 contains a copy of L1 as a sublattice.

subsets, form a lattice using ⊆as the partial order. Show that the lattice of open

2. If P and Q are posets, let QP be the poset of order-preserving maps from P to Q,
where for f, g ∈QP we deﬁne f ≤g iﬀf(a) ≤g(a) for all a ∈P. If Q is a lattice show
that QP is also a lattice.

lower segments of P forms a lattice.
5. If L is a lattice, then an ideal I of L is a nonempty lower segment closed under ∨. Show
that the set of ideals I(L) of L forms a lattice under ⊆.
6. Given a lattice L, an ideal I of L is called a principal ideal if it is of the form {b ∈
L : b ≤a}, for some a ∈L. (Note that such subsets are indeed ideals.) Show that the
principal ideals of L form a sublattice of I(L) isomorphic to L.
§3.
Distributive and Modular Lattices
The most thoroughly studied classes of lattices are distributive lattices and modular lattices.
Deﬁnition 3.1. A distributive lattice is a lattice which satisﬁes either (and hence, as we
shall see, both) of the distributive laws,
D1: x ∧(y ∨z) ≈(x ∧y) ∨(x ∧z)
D2: x ∨(y ∧z) ≈(x ∨y) ∧(x ∨z).
Theorem 3.2. A lattice L satisﬁes D1 iﬀit satisﬁes D2.
Proof. Suppose D1 holds. Then
x ∨(y ∧z) ≈(x ∨(x ∧z)) ∨(y ∧z)
(by L4(a))
≈x ∨((x ∧z) ∨(y ∧z))
(by L2(a))
≈x ∨((z ∧x) ∨(z ∧y))
(by L1(b))
≈x ∨(z ∧(x ∨y))
(by D1)
≈x ∨((x ∨y) ∧z)
(by L1(b))
≈(x ∧(x ∨y)) ∨((x ∨y) ∧z)
(by L4(b))
≈((x ∨y) ∧x) ∨((x ∨y) ∧z)
(by L1(b))
≈(x ∨y) ∧(x ∨z)
(by D1).
Thus D2 also holds. A similar proof shows that if D2 holds then so does D1.

Actually every lattice satisﬁes both of the inequalities (x ∧y) ∨(x ∧z) ≤x ∧(y ∨z) and
x ∨(y ∧z) ≤(x ∨y) ∧(x ∨z). To see this, note for example that x ∧y ≤x and x ∧y ≤y ∨z;

§3. Distributive and Modular Lattices
13
hence x ∧y ≤x ∧(y ∨z), etc. Thus to verify the distributive laws in a lattice it suﬃces to
check either of the following inequalities:
x ∧(y ∨z) ≤(x ∧y) ∨(x ∧z)
(x ∨y) ∧(x ∨z) ≤x ∨(y ∧z).
Deﬁnition 3.3. A modular lattice is any lattice which satisﬁes the modular law
M: x ≤y →x ∨(y ∧z) ≈y ∧(x ∨z).
The modular law is obviously equivalent (for lattices) to the identity
(x ∧y) ∨(y ∧z) ≈y ∧((x ∧y) ∨z)
since a ≤b holds iﬀa = a ∧b. Also it is not diﬃcult to see that every lattice satisﬁes
x ≤y →x ∨(y ∧z) ≤y ∧(x ∨z),
so to verify the modular law it suﬃces to check the implication
x ≤y →y ∧(x ∨z) ≤x ∨(y ∧z).
Theorem 3.4. Every distributive lattice is a modular lattice.
Proof. Just use D2, noting that a ∨b = b whenever a ≤b.

The next two theorems give a fascinating characterization of modular and distributive
lattices in terms of two ﬁve-element lattices called M5 and N5 depicted in Figure 5. In
neither case is a ∨(b ∧c) = (a ∨b) ∧(a ∨c), so neither M5 nor N5 is a distributive lattice.
For N5 we also see that a ≤b but a ∨(b ∧c) ̸= b ∧(a ∨c), so N5 is not modular. With a
small amount of eﬀort one can verify that M5 does satisfy the modular law, however.

Theorem 3.5 (Dedekind). L is a nonmodular lattice iﬀN5 can be embedded into L.
Proof. From the remarks above it is clear that if N5 can be embedded into L, then L does
not satisfy the modular law. For the converse, suppose that L does not satisfy the modular
law. Then for some a, b, c in L we have a ≤b but a ∨(b ∧c) < b ∧(a ∨c). Let a1 = a ∨(b ∧c)
and b1 = b ∧(a ∨c). Then
c ∨b1 = c ∧[b ∧(a ∨c)]
= [c ∧(c ∨a)] ∧b
(by L1(a), L1(b), L2(b))
= c ∧b
(by L4(b))
and
c ∨a1 = c ∨[a ∨(b ∧c)]
= [c ∨(c ∧b)] ∨a
(by L1(a), L1(b), L2(a))
= c ∨a
(by L4(a)).
Now as c ∧b ≤a1 ≤b1 we have c ∧b ≤c ∧a1 ≤c ∧b1 = c ∧b, hence c ∧a1 = c ∧b1 = c ∧b.
Likewise c ∨b1 = c ∨a1 = c ∨a.
Now it is straightforward to verify that the diagram in Figure 6 gives the desired copy of
N5 in L.

Theorem 3.6 (Birkhoﬀ). L is a nondistributive lattice iﬀM5 or N5 can be embedded into
L.
Proof. If either M5 or N5 can be embedded into L, then it is clear from earlier remarks
that L cannot be distributive. For the converse, let us suppose that L is a nondistributive
lattice and that L does not contain a copy of N5 as a sublattice. Thus L is modular by 3.5.

§3. Distributive and Modular Lattices

Since the distributive laws do not hold in L, there must be elements a, b, c from L such that
(a ∧b) ∨(a ∧c) < a ∧(b ∨c). Let us deﬁne
d = (a ∧b) ∨(a ∧c) ∨(b ∧c)
e = (a ∨b) ∧(a ∨c) ∧(b ∨c)
a1 = (a ∧e) ∨d
b1 = (b ∧e) ∨d
c1 = (c ∧e) ∨d.
Then it is easily seen that d ≤a1, b1, c1 ≤e. Now from
a ∧e = a ∧(b ∨c)
(by L4(b))
and (applying the modular law to switch the underlined terms)
a ∧d = a ∧((a ∧b) ∨(a ∧c) ∨(b ∧c))
= ((a ∧b) ∨(a ∧c)) ∨(a ∧(b ∧c))
(by M)
= (a ∧b) ∨(a ∧c)
it follows that d < e.

We will verify one case only and the others require similar arguments (in the following we

§4.
Complete Lattices, Equivalence Relations,
and Algebraic Lattices
In the 1930’s Birkhoﬀintroduced the class of complete lattices to study the combinations of
subalgebras.
Deﬁnition 4.1. A poset P is complete if for every subset A of P both sup A and inf A
exist (in P). The elements sup A and inf A will be denoted by W A and V A, respectively.
All complete posets are lattices, and a lattice L which is complete as a poset is a complete
lattice.
Theorem 4.2. Let P be a poset such that V A exists for every subset A, or such that W A
exists for every subset A. Then P is a complete lattice.
Proof. Suppose V A exists for every A ⊆P. Then letting Au be the set of upper bounds
of A in P, it is routine to verify that V Au is indeed W A. The other half of the theorem is
proved similarly.

In the above theorem the existence of V ∅guarantees a largest element in P, and likewise
the existence of W ∅guarantees a smallest element in P. So an equivalent formulation of
Theorem 4.2 would be to say that P is complete if it has a largest element and the inf of
every nonempty subset exists, or if it has a smallest element and the sup of every nonempty
subset exists.
Examples. (1) The set of extended reals with the usual ordering is a complete lattice.
(2) The open subsets of a topological space with the ordering ⊆form a complete lattice.
(3) Su(I) with the usual ordering ⊆is a complete lattice.
A complete lattice may, of course, have sublattices which are incomplete (for example,
consider the reals as a sublattice of the extended reals). It is also possible for a sublattice
of a complete lattice to be complete, but the sups and infs of the sublattice not to agree
with those of the original lattice (for example look at the sublattice of the extended reals
consisting of those numbers whose absolute value is less than one together with the numbers
−2, +2).
Deﬁnition 4.3. A sublattice L′ of a complete lattice L is called a complete sublattice of L
if for every subset A of L′ the elements W A and V A, as deﬁned in L, are actually in L′.
In the 1930’s Birkhoﬀintroduced the lattice of equivalence relations on a set, which is
especially important in the study of quotient structures.
Deﬁnition 4.4. Let A be a set. Recall that a binary relation r on A is a subset of A2. If
⟨a, b⟩∈r we also write arb. If r1 and r2 are binary relations on A then the relational product

18
I Lattices
r1 ◦r2 is the binary relation on A deﬁned by ⟨a, b⟩∈r1 ◦r2 iﬀthere is a c ∈A such that
⟨a, c⟩∈r1 and ⟨c, b⟩∈r2. Inductively one deﬁnes r1 ◦r2 ◦· · · ◦rn = (r1 ◦r2 ◦· · · ◦rn−1) ◦rn.
The inverse of a binary relation r is given by rˇ = {⟨a, b⟩∈A2 : ⟨b, a⟩∈r}. The diagonal
relation ∆A on A is the set {⟨a, a⟩: a ∈A} and the all relation A2 is denoted by ∇A. (We
write simply ∆(read: delta) and ∇(read: nabla) when there is no confusion.) A binary
relation r on A is an equivalence relation on A if, for any a, b, c from A, it satisﬁes:
E1: ara
(reﬂexivity)
E2: arb implies bra
(symmetry)
E3: arb and brc imply arc
(transitivity).
Eq(A) is the set of all equivalence relations on A.
Theorem 4.5. The poset Eq(A), with ⊆as the partial ordering, is a complete lattice.
Proof. Note that Eq(A) is closed under arbitrary intersections.

For θ1 and θ2 in Eq(A) it is clear that θ1 ∧θ2 = θ1 ∩θ2. Next we look at a (constructive)
description of θ1 ∨θ2.
Theorem 4.6. If θ1 and θ2 are two equivalence relations on A then
θ1 ∨θ2 = θ1 ∪(θ1 ◦θ2) ∪(θ1 ◦θ2 ◦θ1) ∪(θ1 ◦θ2 ◦θ1 ◦θ2) ∪· · · ,
or equivalently, ⟨a, b⟩∈θ1 ∨θ2 iﬀthere is a sequence of elements c1, c2, . . . , cn from A such
that
⟨ci, ci+1⟩∈θ1
or
⟨ci, ci+1⟩∈θ2
for i = 1, . . . , n −1, and a = c1, b = cn.
Proof. It is not diﬃcult to see that the right-hand side of the above equation is indeed an
equivalence relation, and also that each of the relational products in parentheses is contained
in θ1 ∨θ2.

If {θi}i∈I is a subset of Eq(A) then it is also easy to see that V
i∈I θi is just T
i∈I θi. The
following straightforward generalization of the previous theorem describes arbitrary sups in
Eq(A).
Theorem 4.7. If θi ∈Eq(A) for i ∈I, then
_
i∈I
θi =
[
{θi0 ◦θi1 ◦· · · ◦θik : i0, . . ., ik ∈I, k < ∞}.
Deﬁnition 4.8. Let θ be a member of Eq(A). For a ∈A, the equivalence class (or coset) of
a modulo θ is the set a/θ = {b ∈A : ⟨b, a⟩∈θ}. The set {a/θ : a ∈A} is denoted by A/θ.

Theorem 4.9. For θ ∈Eq(A) and a, b ∈A we have
(a) A = S
a∈A a/θ.
(b) a/θ ̸= b/θ implies a/θ ∩b/θ = ∅.
Proof. (Exercise).

An alternative approach to equivalence relations is given by partitions, in view of 4.9.
Deﬁnition 4.10. A partition π of a set A is a family of nonempty pairwise disjoint subsets
of A such that A = S π. The sets in π are called the blocks of π. The set of all partitions of
A is denoted by Π(A).
For π in Π(A), let us deﬁne an equivalence relation θ(π) by θ(π) = {⟨a, b⟩∈A2 : {a, b} ⊆
B for some B in π}. Note that the mapping π 7→θ(π) is a bijection between Π(A) and
Eq(A). Deﬁne a relation ≤on Π(A) by π1 ≤π2 iﬀeach block of π1 is contained in some
block of π2.
Theorem 4.11. With the above ordering Π(A) is a complete lattice, and it is isomorphic
to the lattice Eq(A) under the mapping π 7→θ(π).
The veriﬁcation of this result is left to the reader.
Deﬁnition 4.12. The lattice Π(A) is called the lattice of partitions of A.
The last class of lattices which we introduce is that of algebraic lattices.
Deﬁnition 4.13. Let L be a lattice. An element a in L is compact iﬀwhenever W A exists
and a ≤W A for A ⊆L, then a ≤W B for some ﬁnite B ⊆A. L is compactly generated iﬀ
every element in L is a sup of compact elements. A lattice L is algebraic if it is complete
and compactly generated.
The reader will readily see the similarity between the deﬁnition of a compact element in
a lattice and that of a compact subset of a topological space. Algebraic lattices originated
with Komatu and Nachbin in the 1940’s and B¨uchi in the early 1950’s; the original deﬁnition
was somewhat diﬀerent, however.
Examples. (1) The lattice of subsets of a set is an algebraic lattice (where the compact
elements are ﬁnite sets).
(2) The lattice of subgroups of a group is an algebraic lattice (in which “compact” =
“ﬁnitely generated”).
(3) Finite lattices are algebraic lattices.
(4) The subset [0, 1] of the real line is a complete lattice, but is not algebraic.

I Lattices
In the next chapter we will encounter two situations where algebraic lattices arise, namely
as lattices of subuniverses of algebras and as lattices of congruences on algebras.
Exercises §4
1. Show that the binary relations on a set A form a lattice under ⊆.
2. Show that the right-hand side of the equation in Theorem 4.6 is indeed an equivalence
relation on A.
3. If I is a closed and bounded interval of the real line with the usual ordering, and P a
nonempty subset of I with the same ordering, show that P is a complete sublattice iﬀ
P is a closed subset of I.
4. If L is a complete chain show that L is algebraic iﬀfor every a1, a2 ∈L with a1 < a2
there are b1, b2 ∈L with a1 ≤b1 ≺b2 ≤a2.
5. Draw the Hasse diagram of the lattice of partitions of a set with n elements for 1 ≤
n ≤4. For |A| ≥4 show that Π(A) is not a modular lattice.
6. If L is an algebraic lattice and D is a subset of L such that for d1, d2 ∈D there is a
d3 ∈D with d1 ≤d3, d2 ≤d3 (i.e., D is upward directed) then, for a ∈L, a ∧W D =
W
d∈D(a ∧d).
7. If L is a distributive algebraic lattice then, for any A ⊆L, we have a∧W A = W
d∈A(a∧
d).
8. If a and b are compact elements of a lattice L, show that a ∨b is also compact. Is a ∧b
always compact?
9. If L is a lattice with at least one compact element, let C(L) be the poset of compact
elements of L with the partial order on C(L) agreeing with the partial order on L. An
ideal of C(L) is a nonempty subset I of C(L) such that a, b ∈I implies a ∨b ∈I, and
a ∈I, b ∈C(L) with b ≤a implies b ∈I. Show that the ideals of C(L) form a lattice
under ⊆if L has a least element and that the lattice of ideals of C(L) is isomorphic
to L if L is an algebraic lattice.
§5.
Closure Operators
One way of producing, and recognizing, complete [algebraic] lattices is through [algebraic]
closure operators. Tarski developed one of the most fascinating applications of closure op-
erators during the 1930’s in his study of “consequences” in logic.

§5. Closure Operators
21
Deﬁnition 5.1. If we are given a set A, a mapping C : Su(A) →Su(A) is called a closure
operator on A if, for X, Y ⊆A, it satisﬁes:
C1: X ⊆C(X)
(extensive)
C2: C2(X) = C(X)
(idempotent)
C3: X ⊆Y implies C(X) ⊆C(Y )
(isotone).
A subset X of A is called a closed subset if C(X) = X. The poset of closed subsets of A with
set inclusion as the partial ordering is denoted by LC.
The deﬁnition of a closure operator is more general than that of a topological closure
operator since we do not require that the union of two closed subsets be closed.
Theorem 5.2. Let C be a closure operator on a set A. Then LC is a complete lattice with
^
i∈I
C(Ai) =
\
i∈I
C(Ai)
and
_
i∈I
C(Ai) = C
 [
i∈I
Ai
!
.
Proof. Let (Ai)i∈I be an indexed family of closed subsets of A. From
\
i∈I
Ai ⊆Ai,
for each i, we have
C
 \
i∈I
Ai
!
⊆C(Ai) = Ai,
so
C
 \
i∈I
Ai
!
⊆
\
i∈I
Ai,
hence
C
 \
i∈I
Ai
!
=
\
i∈I
Ai;
so T
i∈I Ai is in LC. Then, if one notes that A itself is in LC, it follows that LC is a complete
lattice. The veriﬁcation of the formulas for the V ’s and W ’s of families of closed sets is
straightforward.

Interestingly enough, the converse of this theorem is also true, which shows that the
lattices LC arising from closure operators provide typical examples of complete lattices.

22
I Lattices
Theorem 5.3. Every complete lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of closed subsets of some
set A with a closure operator C.
Proof. Let L be a complete lattice. For X ⊆L deﬁne
C(X) = {a ∈L : a ≤sup X}.
Then C is a closure operator on L and the mapping a 7→{b ∈L : b ≤a} gives the desired
isomorphism between L and LC.

The closure operators which give rise to algebraic lattices of closed subsets are called al-
gebraic closure operators; actually the consequence operator of Tarski is an algebraic closure
operator.
Deﬁnition 5.4. A closure operator C on the set A is an algebraic closure operator if for
every X ⊆A
C4: C(X) = S{C(Y ) : Y ⊆X and Y is ﬁnite}.
(Note that C1, C2, C4 implies C3.)
Theorem 5.5. If C is an algebraic closure operator on a set A then LC is an algebraic
lattice, and the compact elements of LC are precisely the closed sets C(X), where X is a
ﬁnite subset of A.
Proof. First we will show that C(X) is compact if X is ﬁnite. Then by (C4), and in view
of 5.2, LC is indeed an algebraic lattice. So suppose X = {a1, . . ., ak} and
C(X) ⊆
_
i∈I
C(Ai) = C
 [
i∈I
Ai
!
.
For each aj ∈X we have by (C4) a ﬁnite Xj ⊆S
i∈I Ai with aj ∈C(Xj). Since there are
ﬁnitely many Ai’s, say Aj1, . . . , Ajnj, such that
Xj ⊆Aj1 ∪· · · ∪Ajnj,
then
aj ∈C(Aj1 ∪· · · ∪Ajnj).
But then
X ⊆
[
1≤j≤k
C(Aj1 ∪· · · ∪Ajnj),
so
X ⊆C


[

and hence
C(X) ⊆C

1≤i≤nj
Aji



=
_
1≤j≤k

C(Aji),
so C(X) is compact.
Now suppose C(Y ) is not equal to C(X) for any ﬁnite X. From
C(Y ) ⊆
[
{C(X) : X ⊆Y and X is ﬁnite}
it is easy to see that C(Y ) cannot be contained in any ﬁnite union of the C(X)’s; hence
C(Y ) is not compact.

Deﬁnition 5.6. If C is a closure operator on A and Y is a closed subset of A, then we say
a set X is a generating set for Y if C(X) = Y. The set Y is ﬁnitely generated if there is a
ﬁnite generating set for Y. The set X is a minimal generating set for Y if X generates Y
and no proper subset of X generates Y.
Corollary 5.7. Let C be an algebraic closure operator on A. Then the ﬁnitely generated
subsets of A are precisely the compact elements of LC.
Theorem 5.8. Every algebraic lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of closed subsets of some
set A with an algebraic closure operator C.
Proof. Let L be an algebraic lattice, and let A be the subset of compact elements. For
X ⊆A deﬁne
C(X) = {a ∈A : a ≤
_
X}.
C is a closure operator, and from the deﬁnition of compact elements it follows that C is
algebraic. The map a 7→{b ∈A : b ≤a} gives the desired isomorphism as L is compactly
generated.

under arbitrary intersections.
Given a set A and a family K of subsets of A, K is said to be closed under unions of
chains if whenever C ⊆K and C is a chain (under ⊆) then S C ∈K; and K is said to
be closed under unions of upward directed families of sets if whenever D ⊆K is such that
A1, A2 ∈D implies A1 ∪A2 ⊆A3 for some A3 ∈D, then S D ∈K. A result of set theory
says that K is closed under unions of chains iﬀK is closed under unions of upward directed
families of sets.

8. Let C be a closure operator on S. A closed subset X ̸= S is maximal if for any closed
subset Y with X ⊆Y ⊆S, either X = Y or Y = S. Show that if C is algebraic and
X ⊆S with C(X) ̸= S then X is contained in a maximal closed subset if S is ﬁnitely
generated. (In logic one applies this to show every consistent theory is contained in a
complete theory.)

Chapter II
The Elements of Universal Algebra
One of the aims of universal algebra is to extract, whenever possible, the common elements
of several seemingly diﬀerent types of algebraic structures. In achieving this one discovers
general concepts, constructions, and results which not only generalize and unify the known
special situations, thus leading to an economy of presentation, but, being at a higher level of
abstraction, can also be applied to entirely new situations, yielding signiﬁcant information
and giving rise to new directions.
In this chapter we describe some of these concepts and their interrelationships. Of pri-
mary importance is the concept of an algebra; centered around this we discuss the notions
of isomorphism, subalgebra, congruence, quotient algebra, homomorphism, direct product,
subdirect product, term, identity, and free algebra.
§1.
Deﬁnition and Examples of Algebras
The deﬁnition of an algebra given below encompasses most of the well known algebraic struc-
tures, as we shall point out, as well as numerous lesser known algebras which are of current
research interest. Although the need for such a deﬁnition was noted by several mathemati-
cians such as Whitehead in 1898, and later by Noether, the credit for realizing this goal goes
to Birkhoﬀin 1933. Perhaps it should be noted here that recent research in logic, recur-
sive function theory, theory of automata, and computer science has revealed that Birkhoﬀ’s
original notion could be fruitfully extended, for example to partial algebras and heteroge-
neous algebras, topics which lie outside the scope of this text. (Birkhoﬀ’s deﬁnition allowed
inﬁnitary operations; however, his main results were concerned with ﬁnitary operations.)
Deﬁnition 1.1. For A a nonempty set and n a nonnegative integer we deﬁne A0 = {∅},
and, for n > 0, An is the set of n-tuples of elements from A. An n-ary operation (or function)
on A is any function f from An to A; n is the arity (or rank) of f. A ﬁnitary operation is an
n-ary operation, for some n. The image of ⟨a1, . . . , an⟩under an n-ary operation f is denoted
by f(a1, . . . , an). An operation f on A is called a nullary operation (or constant) if its arity
25

26
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
is zero; it is completely determined by the image f(∅) in A of the only element ∅in A0,
and as such it is convenient to identify it with the element f(∅). Thus a nullary operation is
thought of as an element of A. An operation f on A is unary, binary, or ternary if its arity
is 1,2, or 3, respectively.
Deﬁnition 1.2. A language (or type) of algebras is a set F of function symbols such that
a nonnegative integer n is assigned to each member f of F. This integer is called the arity
(or rank) of f, and f is said to be an n-ary function symbol. The subset of n-ary function
symbols in F is denoted by Fn.
Deﬁnition 1.3. If F is a language of algebras then an algebra A of type F is an ordered
pair ⟨A, F⟩where A is a nonempty set and F is a family of ﬁnitary operations on A indexed
by the language F such that corresponding to each n-ary function symbol f in F there is an
n-ary operation f A on A. The set A is called the universe (or underlying set) of A = ⟨A, F⟩,
and the f A’s are called the fundamental operations of A. (In practice we prefer to write just
f for f A—this convention creates an ambiguity which seldom causes a problem. However,
in this chapter we will be unusually careful.) If F is ﬁnite, say F = {f1, . . . , fk}, we often
write ⟨A, f1, . . . , fk⟩for ⟨A, F⟩, usually adopting the convention:
arity f1 ≥arity f2 ≥· · · ≥arity fk.
An algebra A is unary if all of its operations are unary, and it is mono-unary if it has just
one unary operation. A is a groupoid if it has just one binary operation; this operation is
usually denoted by + or ·, and we write a+b or a·b (or just ab) for the image of ⟨a, b⟩under
this operation, and call it the sum or product of a and b, respectively. An algebra A is ﬁnite
if |A| is ﬁnite, and trivial if |A| = 1.
It is a curious fact that the algebras that have been most extensively studied in conven-
tional (albeit modern!) algebra do not have fundamental operations of arity greater than
two. (However see IV§7 Ex. 8.)
Not all of the following examples of algebras are well-known, but they are of considerable
importance in current research. In particular we would like to point out the role of recent
directions in logic aimed at providing algebraic models for certain logical systems. The reader
will notice that all of the diﬀerent kinds of algebras listed below are distinguished from each
other by their fundamental operations and the fact that they satisfy certain identities. One
of the early achievements of Birkhoﬀwas to clarify the role of identities (see §11).
Examples. (1) Groups. A group G is an algebra ⟨G, ·, −1, 1⟩with a binary, a unary, and
nullary operation in which the following identities are true:
G1: x · (y · z) ≈(x · y) · z
G2: x · 1 ≈1 · x ≈x
G3: x · x−1 ≈x−1 · x ≈1.
A group G is Abelian (or commutative ) if the following identity is true:

§1. Deﬁnition and Examples of Algebras
27
G4: x · y ≈y · x.
Groups were one of the earliest concepts studied in algebra (groups of substitutions
appeared about two hundred years ago). The deﬁnition given above is not the one which
appears in standard texts on groups, for they use only one binary operation and axioms
involving existential quantiﬁers. The reason for the above choice, and for the descriptions
given below, will become clear in §2.
Groups are generalized to semigroups and monoids in one direction, and to quasigroups
and loops in another direction.
(2) Semigroups and Monoids. A semigroup is a groupoid ⟨G, ·⟩in which (G1) is true.
It is commutative (or Abelian) if (G4) holds. A monoid is an algebra ⟨M, ·, 1⟩with a binary
and a nullary operation satisfying (G1) and (G2).
(3) Quasigroups and Loops. A quasigroup is an algebra ⟨Q, /, ·, \⟩with three binary
operations satisfying the following identities:
Q1: x\(x · y) ≈y; (x · y)/y ≈x
Q2: x · (x\y) ≈y; (x/y) · y ≈x.
A loop is a quasigroup with identity, i.e., an algebra ⟨Q, /, ·, \, 1⟩which satisﬁes (Q1), (Q2)
and (G2). Quasigroups and loops will play a major role in Chapter III.
(4) Rings. A ring is an algebra ⟨R, +, ·, −, 0⟩, where + and · are binary, −is unary and 0
is nullary, satisfying the following conditions:
R1: ⟨R, +, −, 0⟩is an Abelian group
R2: ⟨R, ·⟩is a semigroup
R3: x · (y + z) ≈(x · y) + (x · z)
(x + y) · z ≈(x · z) + (y · z).
A ring with identity is an algebra ⟨R, +, ·, −, 0, 1⟩such that (R1)–(R3) and (G2) hold.
(5) Modules Over a (Fixed) Ring. Let R be a given ring. A (left) R-module is an
algebra ⟨M, +, −, 0, (fr)r∈R⟩where + is binary, −is unary, 0 is nullary, and each fr is unary,
such that the following hold:
M1: ⟨M, +, −, 0⟩is an Abelian group
M2: fr(x + y) ≈fr(x) + fr(y), for r ∈R
M3: fr+s(x) ≈fr(x) + fs(x), for r, s ∈R
M4: fr(fs(x)) ≈frs(x) for r, s ∈R.
Let R be a ring with identity. A unitary R-module is an algebra as above satisfying (M1)–
(M4) and
M5: f1(x) ≈x.

28
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
(6) Algebras Over a Ring. Let R be a ring with identity. An algebra over R is an
algebra ⟨A, +, ·, −, 0, (fr)r∈R⟩such that the following hold:
A1: ⟨A, +, −, 0, (fr)r∈R⟩is a unitary R-module
A2: ⟨A, +, ·, −, 0⟩is a ring
A3: fr(x · y) ≈(fr(x)) · y ≈x · fr(y) for r ∈R.
(7) Semilattices. A semilattice is a semigroup ⟨S, ·⟩which satisﬁes the commutative law
(G4) and the idempotent law
S1: x · x ≈x.
Two deﬁnitions of a lattice were given in the last chapter.
We reformulate the ﬁrst
deﬁnition given there in order that it be a special case of algebras as deﬁned in this chapter.
(8) Lattices. A lattice is an algebra ⟨L, ∨, ∧⟩with two binary operations which satisﬁes
(L1)–(L4) of I§1.
(9) Bounded Lattices. An algebra ⟨L, ∨, ∧, 0, 1⟩with two binary and two nullary opera-
tions is a bounded lattice if it satisﬁes:
BL1: ⟨L, ∨, ∧⟩is a lattice
BL2: x ∧0 ≈0; x ∨1 ≈1.
(10) Boolean Algebras. A Boolean algebra is an algebra ⟨B, ∨, ∧, ′, 0, 1⟩with two binary,
one unary, and two nullary operations which satisﬁes:
B1: ⟨B, ∨, ∧⟩is a distributive lattice
B2: x ∧0 ≈0; x ∨1 ≈1
B3: x ∧x′ ≈0; x ∨x′ ≈1.
Boolean algebras were of course discovered as a result of Boole’s investigations into the
underlying laws of correct reasoning. Since then they have become vital to electrical engi-
neering, computer science, axiomatic set theory, model theory, and other areas of science
and mathematics. We will return to them in Chapter IV.
(11) Heyting Algebras. An algebra ⟨H, ∨, ∧, →, 0, 1⟩with three binary and two nullary
operations is a Heyting algebra if it satisﬁes:
H1: ⟨H, ∨, ∧⟩is a distributive lattice
H2: x ∧0 ≈0; x ∨1 ≈1
H3: x →x ≈1
H4: (x →y) ∧y ≈y; x ∧(x →y) ≈x ∧y
H5: x →(y ∧z) ≈(x →y) ∧(x →z); (x ∨y) →z ≈(x →z) ∧(y →z).
These were introduced by Birkhoﬀunder a diﬀerent name, Brouwerian algebras, and with
a diﬀerent notation (v : u for u →v).

§1. Deﬁnition and Examples of Algebras

(12) n-Valued Post Algebras. An algebra ⟨A, ∨, ∧, ′, 0, 1⟩with two binary, one unary,
and two nullary operations is an n-valued Post algebra if it satisﬁes every identity satisﬁed
by the algebra Pn = ⟨{0, 1, . . ., n −1}, ∨, ∧, ′, 0, 1⟩where ⟨{0, 1, . . ., n −1}, ∨, ∧, 0, 1⟩is a
bounded chain with 0 < n −1 < n −2 < · · · < 2 < 1, and 1′ = 2, 2′ = 3, . . ., (n −2)′ =
n −1, (n −1)′ = 0, and 0′ = 1. See Figure 8, where the unary operation ′ is depicted by
arrows. In IV§7 we will give a structure theorem for all n-valued Post algebras, and in V§4
show that they can be deﬁned by a ﬁnite set of equations.

(13) Cylindric Algebras of Dimension n. If we are given n ∈ω, then an algebra
⟨A, ∨, ∧, ′, c0, . . . , cn−1, 0, 1, d00, d01, . . . , dn−1,n−1⟩with two binary operations, n + 1 unary
operations, and n2 + 2 nullary operations is a cylindric algebra of dimension n if it satisﬁes
the following, where 0 ≤i, j, k < n :
C1: ⟨A, ∨, ∧, ′, 0, 1⟩is a Boolean algebra
C2: ci0 ≈0
C3: x ≤cix
C4: ci(x ∧ciy) ≈(cix) ∧(ciy)
C5: cicjx ≈cjcix
C6: dii ≈1
C7: dik ≈cj(dij ∧djk) if i ̸= j ̸= k
C8: ci(dij ∧x) ∧ci(dij ∧x′) ≈0 if i ̸= j.
Cylindric algebras were introduced by Tarski and Thompson to provide an algebraic
version of the predicate logic.
(14) Ortholattices.
An algebra ⟨L, ∨, ∧, ′, 0, 1⟩with two binary, one unary and two
nullary operations is an ortholattice if it satisﬁes:
Q1: ⟨L, ∨, ∧, 0, 1⟩is a bounded lattice
Q2: x ∧x′ ≈0; x ∨x′ ≈1

30
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
Q3: (x ∧y)′ ≈x′ ∨y′; (x ∨y)′ ≈x′ ∧y′
Q4: (x′)′ ≈x.
An orthomodular lattice is an ortholattice which satisﬁes
Q5: x ≤y →x ∨(x′ ∧y) ≈y.

translate undecidability results about word problems for monoids into undecidability
results about equations of unary algebras. This idea has been reﬁned and developed
by McNulty [1976] and Murskiˇı [1971]).
§2.
Isomorphic Algebras, and Subalgebras
The concepts of isomorphism in group theory, ring theory, and lattice theory are special
cases of the notion of isomorphism between algebras.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let A and B be two algebras of the same type F. Then a function α : A →B
is an isomorphism from A to B if α is one-to-one and onto, and for every n-ary f ∈F, for
a1, . . ., an ∈A, we have
αf A(a1, . . ., an) = f B(αa1, . . . , αan).
(∗)
We say A is isomorphic to B, written A ∼= B, if there is an isomorphism from A to B. If α
is an isomorphism from A to B we may simply say “α : A →B is an isomorphism”.
As is well-known, following Felix Klein’s Erlanger Programm, algebra is often considered
as the study of those properties of algebras which are invariant under isomorphism, and such
properties are called algebraic properties. Thus from an algebraic point of view, isomorphic
algebras can be regarded as equal or the same, as they would have the same algebraic
structure, and would diﬀer only in the nature of the elements; the phrase “they are equal up
to isomorphism” is often used.
There are several important methods of constructing new algebras from given ones. Three
of the most fundamental are the formation of subalgebras, homomorphic images, and direct
products. These will occupy us for the next few sections.
Deﬁnition 2.2. Let A and B be two algebras of the same type. Then B is a subalgebra of
A if B ⊆A and every fundamental operation of B is the restriction of the corresponding
operation of A, i.e., for each function symbol f, f B is f A restricted to B; we write simply
B ≤A. A subuniverse of A is a subset B of A which is closed under the fundamental
operations of A, i.e., if f is a fundamental n-ary operation of A and a1, . . . , an ∈B we
would require f(a1, . . ., an) ∈B.

32
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
Thus if B is a subalgebra of A, then B is a subuniverse of A. Note that the empty set
may be a subuniverse, but it is not the underlying set of any subalgebra. If A has nullary
operations then every subuniverse contains them as well.
It is the above deﬁnition of subalgebra which motivated the choice of fundamental op-
erations for the several examples given in §1. For example, we would like a subalgebra of
a group to again be a group. If we were to consider a group as an algebra with only the
usual binary operation then, unfortunately, subalgebra would only mean subsemigroup (for
example the positive integers are a subsemigroup, but not a subgroup, of the group of all
integers). Similar remarks apply to rings, modules, etc. By considering a suitable modiﬁca-
tion (enlargement) of the set of fundamental operations the concept of subalgebra as deﬁned
above coincides with the usual notion for the several examples in §1.
A slight generalization of the notion of isomorphism leads to the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.3. Let A and B be of the same type. A function α : A →B is an embedding of
A into B if α is one-to-one and satisﬁes (∗) of 2.1 (such an α is also called a monomorphism).
For brevity we simply say “α : A →B is an embedding”. We say A can be embedded in B
if there is an embedding of A into B.
Theorem 2.4. If α : A →B is an embedding, then α(A) is a subuniverse of B.
Proof. Let α : A →B be an embedding.
Then for an n-ary function symbol f and
a1, . . ., an ∈A,
f B(αa1, . . . , αan) = αf A(a1, . . . , an) ∈α(A),
hence α(A) is a subuniverse of B.

Deﬁnition 2.5. If α : A →B is an embedding, α(A) denotes the subalgebra of B with
universe α(A).
A problem of general interest to algebraists may be formulated as follows. Let K be
a class of algebras and let K1 be a proper subclass of K. (In practice, K may have been
obtained from the process of abstraction of certain properties of K1, or K1 may be obtained
from K by certain additional, more desirable, properties.) Two basic questions arise in the
quest for structure theorems.
(1) Is every member of K isomorphic to some member of K1?
(2) Is every member of K embeddable in some member of K1?
For example, every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a ﬁeld of sets (see IV§1), every group
is isomorphic to a group of permutations, a ﬁnite Abelian group is isomorphic to a direct
product of cyclic groups, and a ﬁnite distributive lattice can be embedded in a power of the
two-element distributive lattice. Structure theorems are certainly a major theme in Chapter
IV.

§3. Algebraic Lattices and Subuniverses
33
§3.
Algebraic Lattices and Subuniverses
We shall now describe one of the natural ways that algebraic lattices arise in universal
algebra.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Given an algebra A deﬁne, for every X ⊆A,
Sg(X) =
\
{B : X ⊆B and B is a subuniverse of A}.
We read Sg(X) as “the subuniverse generated by X”.
Theorem 3.2. If we are given an algebra A, then Sg is an algebraic closure operator on A.
Proof. Observe that an arbitrary intersection of subuniverses of A is again a subuniverse,
hence Sg is a closure operator on A whose closed sets are precisely the subuniverses of A.
Now, for any X ⊆A deﬁne
E(X) = X ∪{f(a1, . . . , an) : f is a fundamental n-ary operation on A and a1, . . . , an ∈X}.
Then deﬁne En(X) for n ≥0 by
E0(X) = X
En+1(X) = E(En(X)).
As all the fundamental operations on A are ﬁnitary and
X ⊆E(X) ⊆E2(X) ⊆· · ·
one can show that (Exercise 1)
Sg(X) = X ∪E(X) ∪E2(X) ∪· · · ,
and from this it follows that if a ∈Sg(X) then a ∈En(X) for some n < ω; hence for some
ﬁnite Y ⊆X, a ∈En(Y ). Thus a ∈Sg(Y ). But this says Sg is an algebraic closure operator.

Corollary 3.3. If A is an algebra then LSg, the lattice of subuniverses of A, is an algebraic
lattice.
The corollary says that the subuniverses of A, with ⊆as the partial order, form an
algebraic lattice.
Deﬁnition 3.4. Given an algebra A, Sub(A) denotes the set of subuniverses of A, and
Sub(A) is the corresponding algebraic lattice, the lattice of subuniverses of A. For X ⊆A

34
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
we say X generates A (or A is generated by X, or X is a set of generators of A) if Sg(X) = A.
The algebra A is ﬁnitely generated if it has a ﬁnite set of generators.
One cannot hope to ﬁnd any further essentially new lattice properties which hold for the
class of lattices of subuniverses since every algebraic lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of
subuniverses of some algebra.
Theorem 3.5 (Birkhoﬀand Frink). If L is an algebraic lattice, then L ∼= Sub(A), for some
algebra A.
Proof. Let C be an algebraic closure operator on a set A such that L ∼= LC (such exists
by I§5.8). For each ﬁnite subset B of A and each b ∈C(B) deﬁne an n-ary function fB,b on
A, where n = |B|, by
fB,b(a1, . . . , an) =
(
b
if B = {a1, . . ., an}
a1
otherwise,
and call the resulting algebra A. Then clearly
fB,b(a1, . . . , an) ∈C({a1, . . ., an}),
hence for X ⊆A,
Sg(X) ⊆C(X).
On the other hand
C(X) =
[
{C(B) : B ⊆X and B is ﬁnite}
and, for B ﬁnite,
C(B) = {fB,b(a1, . . . , an) : B = {a1, . . . , an}, b ∈C(B)}
⊆Sg(B)
⊆Sg(X)
imply
C(X) ⊆Sg(X);
hence
C(X) = Sg(X).
Thus LC = Sub(A), so Sub(A) ∼= L.

The following set-theoretic result is used to justify the possibility of certain constructions
in universal algebra—in particular it shows that for a given type there cannot be “too many”
algebras (up to isomorphism) generated by sets no larger than a given cardinality. Recall
that ω is the smallest inﬁnite cardinal.

§4. The Irredundant Basis Theorem
35
Corollary 3.6. If A is an algebra and X ⊆A then |Sg(X)| ≤|X| + |F| + ω.
Proof. Using induction on n one has |En(X)| ≤|X| + |F| + ω, so the result follows from
the proof of 3.2.

§4.
The Irredundant Basis Theorem
Recall that ﬁnitely generated vector spaces have the property that all minimal generating
sets have the same cardinality. It is a rather rare phenomenon, though, to have a “dimen-
sion.” For example, consider the Abelian group Z6—it has both {1} and {2, 3} as minimal
generating sets.
Deﬁnition 4.1. Let C be a closure operator on A. For n < ω, let Cn be the function deﬁned
on Su(A) by
Cn(X) =
[
{C(Y ) : Y ⊆X, |Y | ≤n}.
We say that C is n-ary if
C(X) = Cn(X) ∪C2
n(X) ∪· · · ,
where
C1
n(X) = Cn(X),
Ck+1
n
(X) = Cn(Ck
n(X)).
Lemma 4.2. Let A be an algebra all of whose fundamental operations have arity at most
n. Then Sg is an n-ary closure operator on A.
Proof. Note that (using the E of the proof of 3.2)
E(X) ⊆(Sg)n(X) ⊆Sg(X);
hence
Sg(X) = X ∪E(X) ∪E2(X) ∪· · ·
⊆(Sg)n(X) ∪(Sg)2
n(X) ∪· · ·
⊆Sg(X),
so

36
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
Sg(X) = (Sg)n(X) ∪(Sg)2
n(X) ∪· · · .

Deﬁnition 4.3. Suppose C is a closure operator on S. A minimal generating set of S is called
an irredundant basis. Let IrB(C) = {n < ω : S has an irredundant basis of n elements}.
The next result shows that the length of the ﬁnite gaps in IrB(C) is bounded by n −2 if
C is an n-ary closure operator.
Theorem 4.4 (Tarski). If C is an n-ary closure operator on S with n ≥2, and if i < j with
i, j ∈IrB(C) such that
{i + 1, . . ., j −1} ∩IrB(C) = ∅,
(∗)
then j−i ≤n−1. In particular, if n = 2 then IrB(C) is a convex subset of ω, i.e., a sequence
of consecutive numbers.
Proof. Let B be an irredundant basis with |B| = j. Let K be the set of irredundant bases
A with |A| ≤i.
The idea of the proof is simple. We will think of B as the center of S, and measure the
distance from B using the “rings” Ck+1
n
(B) −Ck
n(B). We want to choose a basis A0 in K
such that A0 is as close as possible to B, and such that the last ring which contains elements
of A0 contains as few elements of A0 as possible. We choose one of the latter elements a0 and
replace it by n or fewer closer elements b1, . . . , bm to obtain a new generating set A1, with
|A1| < i+n. Then A1 contains an irredundant basis A2. By the ‘minimal distance’ condition
on A0 we see that A2 ̸∈K, hence |A2| > i, so |A2| ≥j by (∗). Thus j < i + n.
Now for the details of this proof, choose A0 ∈K such that
A0 ̸⊈Ck
n(B) imples A ⊈Ck
n(B)
for A ∈K (see Figure 9). Let t be such that
A0 ⊆Ct+1
n
(B),
A0 ⊈Ct
n(B).
We can assume that
|A0 ∩(Ct+1
n
(B) −Ct
n(B))| ≤|A ∩(Ct+1
n
(B) −Ct
n(B))|
for all A ∈K with A ⊆Ct+1
n
(B). Choose
a0 ∈[Ct+1
n
(B) −Ct
n(B)] ∩A0.
Then there must exist b1, . . . , bm ∈Ct
n(B), for some m ≤n, with
a0 ∈Cn({b1, . . . , bm}),

§4. The Irredundant Basis Theorem
37
so
A0 ⊆Cn(A1),
where
A1 = (A0 −{a0}) ∪{b1, . . . , bm};
hence
C(A0) ⊆C(A1),
which says A1 is a set of generators of S. Consequently, there is an irredundant basis A2 ⊆A1.
Now |A2| < |A0| + n. If |A0| + n ≤j, we see that the existence of A2 contradicts the choice
of A0 as then we would have
A2 ∈K,
A2 ⊆Ct+1
n
(B)
and
|A2 ∩(Ct+1
n
(B) −Ct
n(B))| < |A0 ∩(Ct+1
n
(B) −Ct
n(B))|.
Thus |A0| + n > j. As |A0| ≤i, we have j −i < n.

§5.
Congruences and Quotient Algebras
The concepts of congruence, quotient algebra, and homomorphism are all closely related.
These will be the subjects of this and the next section.
Normal subgroups, which were introduced by Galois at the beginning of the last century,
play a fundamental role in deﬁning quotient groups and in the so-called homomorphism and
isomorphism theorems which are so basic to the general development of group theory. Ideals,
introduced in the second half of the last century by Dedekind, play an analogous role in
deﬁning quotient rings, and in the corresponding homomorphism and isomorphism theorems
in ring theory. Given such a parallel situation, it was inevitable that mathematicians should
seek a general common formulation. In these two sections the reader will see that congruences
do indeed form the unifying concept, and furthermore they provide another meeting place
for lattice theory and universal algebra.
Deﬁnition 5.1. Let A be an algebra of type F and let θ ∈Eq(A). Then θ is a congruence
on A if θ satisﬁes the following compatibility property:
CP: For each n-ary function symbol f ∈F and elements ai, bi ∈A, if aiθbi holds for
1 ≤i ≤n then
f A(a1, . . . , an)θf A(b1, . . . , bn)
holds.
The compatibility property is an obvious condition for introducing an algebraic structure
on the set of equivalence classes A/θ, an algebraic structure which is inherited from the
algebra A. For if a1, . . . , an are elements of A and f is an n-ary symbol in F, then the easiest
choice of an equivalence class to be the value of f applied to ⟨a1/θ, . . . , an/θ⟩would be simply
f A(a1, . . ., an)/θ. This will indeed deﬁne a function on A/θ iﬀ(CP) holds. We illustrate (CP)
for a binary operation in Figure 10 by subdividing A into the equivalence classes of θ; then
selecting a1, b1 in the same equivalence class and a2, b2 in the same equivalence class we want
f A(a1, b1), f A(a2, b2) to be in the same equivalence class.

Deﬁnition 5.2. The set of all congruences on an algebra A is denoted by Con A. Let θ
be a congruence on an algebra A. Then the quotient algebra of A by θ, written A/θ, is the
algebra whose universe is A/θ and whose fundamental operations satisfy
f A/θ(a1/θ, . . . , an/θ) = f A(a1, . . . , an)/θ
where a1, . . . , an ∈A and f is an n-ary function symbol in F.
Note that quotient algebras of A are of the same type as A.
Examples. (1) Let G be a group. Then one can establish the following connection between
congruences on G and normal subgroups of G:
(a) If θ ∈Con G then 1/θ is the universe of a normal subgroup of G, and for a, b ∈G
we have ⟨a, b⟩∈θ iﬀa · b−1 ∈1/θ;
(b) If N is a normal subgroup of G, then the binary relation deﬁned on G by
⟨a, b⟩∈θ
iﬀ
a · b−1 ∈N
is a congruence on G with 1/θ = N.
Thus the mapping θ 7→1/θ is an order-preserving bijection between congruences on G
and normal subgroups of G.
(2) Let R be a ring. The following establishes a similar connection between the congru-
ences on R and ideals of R:
(a) If θ ∈Con R then 0/θ is an ideal of R, and for a, b ∈R we have ⟨a, b⟩∈θ iﬀ
a −b ∈0/θ;
(b) If I is an ideal of R then the binary relation θ deﬁned on R by
⟨a, b⟩∈θ iﬀa −b ∈I

40
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
is a congruence on R with 0/θ = I.
Thus the mapping θ 7→0/θ is an order-preserving bijection between congruences on R
and ideals of R.
These two examples are a bit misleading in that they suggest any congruence on an
algebra might be determined by a single equivalence class of the congruence.
The next
example shows this need not be the case.
(3) Let L be a lattice which is a chain, and let θ be an equivalence relation on L such
that the equivalence classes of θ are convex subsets of L (i.e., if aθb and a ≤c ≤b then aθc).
Then θ is a congruence on L.
We will delay further discussion of quotient algebras until the next section and instead
concentrate now on the lattice structure of Con A.
Theorem 5.3. ⟨Con A, ⊆⟩is a complete sublattice of ⟨Eq(A), ⊆⟩, the lattice of equivalence
relations on A.
Proof. To verify that Con A is closed under arbitrary intersection is straightforward. For
arbitrary joins in Con A suppose θi ∈Con A for i ∈I. Then, if f is a fundamental n-ary
operation of A and
⟨a1, b1⟩, . . ., ⟨an, bn⟩∈
_
i∈I
θi,
where W is the join of Eq(A), then from I§4.7 it follows that one can ﬁnd i0, . . . , ik ∈I such
that
⟨ai, bi⟩∈θi0 ◦θi1 ◦· · · ◦θik,
0 ≤i ≤n.
An easy argument then suﬃces to show that
⟨f(a1, . . . , an), f(b1, . . . , bn)⟩∈θi0 ◦θi1 ◦· · · ◦θik;
hence W
i∈I θi is a congruence relation on A.

Deﬁnition 5.4.
The congruence lattice of A, denoted by Con A, is the lattice whose
universe is Con A, and meets and joins are calculated the same as when working with
equivalence relations (see I§4).
The following theorem suggests the abstract characterization of congruence lattices of
algebras.
Theorem 5.5. For A an algebra, there is an algebraic closure operator Θ on A × A such
that the closed subsets of A × A are precisely the congruences on A. Hence Con A is an
algebraic lattice.

§5. Congruences and Quotient Algebras
41
Proof. Let us start by setting up an appropriate algebraic structure on A × A. First, for
each n-ary function symbol f in the type of A let us deﬁne a corresponding n-ary function
f on A × A by
f(⟨a1, b1⟩, . . . , ⟨an, bn⟩) = ⟨f A(a1, . . . , an), f A(b1, . . . , bn)⟩.
Then we add the nullary operations ⟨a, a⟩for each a ∈A, a unary operation s deﬁned by
s(⟨a, b⟩) = ⟨b, a⟩,
and a binary operation t deﬁned by
t(⟨a, b⟩, ⟨c, d⟩) =
(
⟨a, d⟩
if b = c
⟨a, b⟩
otherwise.
Now it is an interesting exercise to verify that B is a subuniverse of this new algebra iﬀB is
a congruence on A. Let Θ be the Sg closure operator on A × A for the algebra we have just
described. Thus, by 3.3, Con A is an algebraic lattice.

The compact members of Con A are, by I§5.7, the ﬁnitely generated members Θ(⟨a1, b1⟩,
. . . , ⟨an, bn⟩) of Con A.
Deﬁnition 5.6. For A an algebra and a1, . . . , an ∈A let Θ(a1, . . . , an) denote the congruence
generated by {⟨ai, aj⟩: 1 ≤i, j ≤n}, i.e., the smallest congruence such that a1, . . ., an are in
the same equivalence class. The congruence Θ(a1, a2) is called a principal congruence. For
arbitrary X ⊆A, let Θ(X) be deﬁned to mean the congruence generated by X × X.
Finitely generated congruences will play a key role in II§12, in Chapter IV, and Chapter
V. In certain cases we already know a good description of principal congruences.
Examples. (1) If G is a group and a, b, c, d ∈G then ⟨a, b⟩∈Θ(c, d) iﬀab−1 is a product
of conjugates of cd−1 and conjugates of dc−1. This follows from the fact that the smallest
normal subgroup of G containing a given element e has as its universe the set of all products
of conjugates of e and conjugates of e−1.
(2) If R is a ring with unity and a, b, c, d ∈R then ⟨a, b⟩∈Θ(c, d) iﬀa −b is of the form
P
1≤i≤n ri(c −d)si where ri, si ∈R. This follows from the fact that the smallest ideal of R
containing a given element e of R is precisely the set P
1≤i≤n riesi : ri, si ∈R, n ≥1
	
.
Some useful facts about congruences which depend primarily on the fact that Θ is an
algebraic closure operator are given in the following.
Theorem 5.7. Let A be an algebra, and suppose a1, b1, . . . , an, bn ∈A and θ ∈Con A.
Then

(a) Θ(a1, b1) = Θ(b1, a1)
(b) Θ(⟨a1, b1⟩, . . . , ⟨an, bn⟩) = Θ(a1, b1) ∨· · · ∨Θ(an, bn)
(c) Θ(a1, . . . , an) = Θ(a1, a2) ∨Θ(a2, a3) ∨· · · ∨Θ(an−1, an)
(d) θ = S{Θ(a, b) : ⟨a, b⟩∈θ} = W{Θ(a, b) : ⟨a, b⟩∈θ}
(e) θ = S{Θ(⟨a1, b1⟩, . . ., ⟨an, bn⟩) : ⟨ai, bi⟩∈θ, n ≥1}.
Proof. (a) As
⟨b1, a1⟩∈Θ(a1, b1)
we have
Θ(b1, a1) ⊆Θ(a1, b1);
hence, by symmetry,
Θ(a1, b1) = Θ(b1, a1).
(b) For 1 ≤i ≤n,
⟨ai, bi⟩∈Θ(⟨a1, b1⟩, . . ., ⟨an, bn⟩);
hence
Θ(ai, bi) ⊆Θ(⟨a1, b1⟩, . . . , ⟨an, bn⟩),
so
Θ(a1, b1) ∨· · · ∨Θ(an, bn) ⊆Θ(⟨a1, b1⟩, . . ., ⟨an, bn⟩).
On the other hand, for 1 ≤i ≤n,
⟨ai, bi⟩∈Θ(ai, bi) ⊆Θ(a1, b1) ∨· · · ∨Θ(an, bn),
so
{⟨a1, b1⟩, . . . , ⟨an, bn⟩} ⊆Θ(a1, b1) ∨· · · ∨Θ(an, bn);
hence
Θ(⟨a1, b1⟩, . . . , ⟨an, bn⟩) ⊆Θ(a1, b1) ∨· · · ∨Θ(an, bn),
so
Θ(⟨a1, b1⟩, . . ., ⟨an, bn⟩) = Θ(a1, b1) ∨· · · ∨Θ(an, bn).
(c) For 1 ≤i ≤n −1,
⟨ai, ai+1⟩∈Θ(a1, . . . , an),
so
Θ(ai, ai+1) ⊆Θ(a1, . . . , an);
hence
Θ(a1, a2) ∨· · · ∨Θ(an−1, an) ⊆Θ(a1, . . . , an).
Conversely, for 1 ≤i < j ≤n,
⟨ai, aj⟩∈Θ(ai, ai+1) ◦· · · ◦Θ(aj−1, aj)

§5. Congruences and Quotient Algebras
43
so, by I§4.7
⟨ai, aj⟩∈Θ(ai, ai+1) ∨· · · ∨Θ(aj−1, aj);
hence
⟨ai, aj⟩∈Θ(a1, a2) ∨· · · ∨Θ(an−1, an).
In view of (a) this leads to
Θ(a1, . . . , an) ⊆Θ(a1, a2) ∨· · · ∨Θ(an−1, an),
so
Θ(a1, . . ., an) = Θ(a1, a2) ∨· · · ∨Θ(an−1, an).

⟨a, b⟩∈Θ(a, b) ⊆θ

One cannot hope for a further sharpening of the abstract characterization of congruence
lattices of algebras in 5.5 because in 1963 Gr¨atzer and Schmidt proved that for every algebraic
lattice L there is an algebra A such that L ∼= Con A. Of course, for particular classes of
algebras one might ﬁnd that some additional properties hold for the corresponding classes of
congruence lattices. For example, the congruence lattices of lattices satisfy the distributive
law, and the congruence lattices of groups (or rings) satisfy the modular law. One of the
major themes of universal algebra has been to study the consequences of special assumptions
about the congruence lattices (or congruences) of algebras (see §12 as well as Chapters IV
and V). For this purpose we introduce the following terminology.
Deﬁnition 5.8. An algebra A is congruence-distributive (congruence-modular) if Con A is
a distributive (modular) lattice. If θ1, θ2 ∈Con A and
θ1 ◦θ2 = θ2 ◦θ1
then we say θ1 and θ2 are permutable, or θ1 and θ2 permute. A is congruence-permutable if
every pair of congruences on A permutes. A class K of algebras is congruence-distributive,
congruence-modular, respectively congruence-permutable iﬀevery algebra in K has the de-
sired property.
We have already looked at distributivity and modularity, so we will ﬁnish this section
with two results on permutable congruences.

Theorem 5.9. Let A be an algebra and suppose θ1, θ2 ∈Con A. Then the following are
equivalent:
(a) θ1 ◦θ2 = θ2 ◦θ1
(b) θ1 ∨θ2 = θ1 ◦θ2
(c) θ1 ◦θ2 ⊆θ2 ◦θ1.
Proof. (a) ⇒(b): For any equivalence relation θ we have θ ◦θ = θ, so from (a) it follows
that the expression for θ1 ∨θ2 given in I§4.6 reduces to θ1 ∪(θ1 ◦θ2), and hence to θ1 ◦θ2.
(c) ⇒(a): Given (c) we have to show that
θ2 ◦θ1 ⊆θ1 ◦θ2.
This, however, follows easily from applying the relational inverse operation to (c), namely
we have
(θ1 ◦θ2)ˇ⊆(θ2 ◦θ1)ˇ,
and hence (as the reader can easily verify)
θ2ˇ◦θ1ˇ⊆θ1ˇ◦θ2ˇ.
Since the inverse of an equivalence relation is just that equivalence relation, we have estab-
lished (a).
(b) ⇒(c): Since
θ2 ◦θ1 ⊆θ1 ∨θ2,
from (b) we could deduce
θ2 ◦θ1 ⊆θ1 ◦θ2,
and then from the previous paragraph it would follow that
θ2 ◦θ1 = θ1 ◦θ2;
hence (c) holds.

Theorem 5.10 (Birkhoﬀ). If A is congruence-permutable, then A is congruence-modular.
Proof. Let θ1, θ2, θ3 ∈Con A with θ1 ⊆θ2. We want to show that
θ2 ∩(θ1 ∨θ3) ⊆θ1 ∨(θ2 ∩θ3),
so suppose ⟨a, b⟩is in θ2 ∩(θ1 ∨θ3). By 5.9 there is an element c such that
aθ1c θ3b
holds as
θ1 ∨θ3 = θ1 ◦θ3.

§5. Congruences and Quotient Algebras
45
By symmetry
⟨c, a⟩∈θ1;
hence
⟨c, a⟩∈θ2,
and then by transitivity
⟨c, b⟩∈θ2.
Thus
⟨c, b⟩∈θ2 ∩θ3,
so from
aθ1c(θ2 ∩θ3)b
follows
⟨a, b⟩∈θ1 ◦(θ2 ∩θ3);
hence
⟨a, b⟩∈θ1 ∨(θ2 ∩θ3).

We would like to note that in 1953 J´onsson improved on Birkhoﬀ’s result above by
showing that one could derive the so-called Arguesian identity for lattices from congruence-
permutability. In §12 we will concern ourselves again with congruence-distributivity and
permutability.

§6.
Homomorphisms and the Homomorphism and
Isomorphism Theorems
Homomorphisms are a natural generalization of the concept of isomorphism, and, as we shall
see, go hand in hand with congruences.
Deﬁnition 6.1. Suppose A and B are two algebras of the same type F. A mapping α :
A →B is called a homomorphism from A to B if
αf A(a1, . . . , an) = f B(αa1, . . . , αan)
for each n-ary f in F and each sequence a1, . . . , an from A. If, in addition, the mapping α is
onto then B is said to be a homomorphic image of A, and α is called an epimorphism. (In
this terminology an isomorphism is a homomorphism which is one-to-one and onto.) In case
A = B a homomorphism is also called an endomorphism and an isomorphism is referred to
as an automorphism. The phrase “α : A →B is a homomorphism” is often used to express
the fact that α is a homomorphism from A to B.
Examples. Lattice, group, ring, module, and monoid homomorphisms are all special cases
of homomorphisms as deﬁned above.
Theorem 6.2. Let A be an algebra generated by a set X. If α : A →B and β : A →B are
two homomorphisms which agree on X (i.e., α(a) = β(a) for a ∈X), then α = β.
Proof. Recall the deﬁnition of E in §3. Note that if α and β agree on X then α and β
agree on E(X), for if f is an n-ary function symbol and a1, . . . , an ∈X then
αf A(a1, . . . , an) = f B(αa1, . . . αan)
= f B(βa1, . . . , βan)
= βf A(a1, . . . , an).
Thus by induction, if α and β agree on X then they agree on En(X) for n < ω, and hence
they agree on Sg(X).

Theorem 6.3. Let α : A →B be a homomorphism. Then the image of a subuniverse of A
under α is a subuniverse of B, and the inverse image of a subuniverse of B is a subuniverse
of A.
Proof. Let S be a subuniverse of A, let f be an n-ary member of F, and let a1, . . . , an ∈S.
Then
f B(αa1, . . . , αan) = αf A(a1, . . . , an) ∈α(S),

48
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
so α(S) is a subuniverse of B. If we now assume that S is a subuniverse of B (instead of
A) and α(a1), . . ., α(an) ∈S then αf A(a1, . . . , an) ∈S follows from the above equation, so
f A(a1, . . ., an) is in α−1(S). Thus α−1(S) is a subuniverse of A.

Deﬁnition 6.4. If α : A →B is a homomorphism and C ≤A, D ≤B, let α(C) be the
subalgebra of B with universe α(C), and let α−1(D) be the subalgebra of A with universe
α−1(D), provided α−1(D) ̸= ∅.
Theorem 6.5.
Suppose α : A →B and β : B →C are homomorphisms. Then the
composition β ◦α is a homomorphism from A to C.
Proof. For f an n-ary function symbol and a1, . . . , an ∈A, we have
(β ◦α)f A(a1, . . . , an) = β(αf A(a1, . . ., an))
= βf B(αa1, . . . , αan)
= f C(β(αa1), . . . , β(αan))
= f C((β ◦α)a1, . . . , (β ◦α)an).

The next result says that homomorphisms commute with subuniverse closure operators.
Theorem 6.6. If α : A →B is a homomorphism and X is a subset of A then
α Sg(X) = Sg(αX).
Proof. From the deﬁnition of E (see §3) and the fact that α is a homomorphism we have
αE(Y ) = E(αY )
for all Y ⊆A. Thus, by induction on n,
αEn(X) = En(αX)
for n ≥1; hence
α Sg(X) = α(X ∪E(X) ∪E2(X) ∪. . . )
= αX ∪αE(X) ∪αE2(X) ∪. . .
= αX ∪E(αX) ∪E2(αX) ∪. . .
= Sg(αX).

§6. Homomorphisms and the Homomorphism and Isomorphism Theorems

Deﬁnition 6.7. Let α : A →B be a homomorphism. Then the kernel of α, written ker(α),
is deﬁned by
ker(α) = {⟨a, b⟩∈A2 : α(a) = α(b)}.
Theorem 6.8. Let α : A →B be a homomorphism. Then ker(α) is a congruence on A.
Proof. If ⟨ai, bi⟩∈ker(α) for 1 ≤i ≤n and f is n-ary in F, then
αf A(a1, . . . , an) = f B(αa1, . . . , αan)
= f B(αb1, . . . , αbn)
= αf A(b1, . . ., bn);
hence
⟨f A(a1, . . . , an), f A(b1, . . . , bn)⟩∈ker(α).
Clearly ker(α) is an equivalence relation, so it follows that ker(α) is actually a congruence
on A.

When studying groups it is usual to refer to the kernel of a homomorphism as a normal
subgroup, namely the inverse image of the identity element under the homomorphism. This
does not cause any real problems since we have already pointed out in §5 that a congruence
on a group is determined by the equivalence class of the identity element, which is a normal
subgroup. Similarly, in the study of rings one refers to the kernel of a homomorphism as a
certain ideal.
We are now ready to look at the straightforward generalizations to abstract algebras of
the homomorphism and isomorphism theorems usually encountered in a ﬁrst course on group
theory.

Deﬁnition 6.9. Let A be an algebra and let θ ∈Con A. The natural map νθ : A →A/θ
is deﬁned by νθ(a) = a/θ. (When there is no ambiguity we write simply ν instead of νθ.)
Figure 11 shows how one might visualize the natural map.
Theorem 6.10. The natural map from an algebra to a quotient of the algebra is an onto
homomorphism.
Proof. Let θ ∈Con A and let ν : A →A/θ be the natural map. Then for f an n-ary
function symbol and a1, . . . , an ∈A we have
νf A(a1, . . . , an) = f A(a1, . . ., an)/θ
= f A/θ(a1/θ, . . ., an/θ)
= f A/θ(νa1, . . . , νan),
so ν is a homomorphism. Clearly ν is onto.

Deﬁnition 6.11. The natural homomorphism from an algebra to a quotient of the algebra
is given by the natural map.
Theorem 6.12 (Homomorphism Theorem). Suppose α : A →B is a homomorphism onto
B. Then there is an isomorphism β from A/ ker(α) to B deﬁned by α = β ◦ν, where ν is
the natural homomorphism from A to A/ ker(α). (See Figure 12).

Proof. First note that if α = β ◦ν then we must have β(a/θ) = α(a). The second of these
equalities does indeed deﬁne a function β, and β satisﬁes α = β ◦ν. It is not diﬃcult to
verify that β is a bijection. To show that β is actually an isomorphism, suppose f is an
n-ary function symbol and a1, . . ., an ∈A. Then
β(f A/θ(a1/θ, . . . , an/θ)) = β(f A(a1, . . . , an)/θ)
= αf A(a1, . . . , an)
= f B(αa1, . . ., αan)
= f B(β(a1/θ), . . . , β(an/θ)).

Combining Theorems 6.5 and 6.12 we see that an algebra is a homomorphic image of
an algebra A iﬀit is isomorphic to a quotient of the algebra A. Thus the “external” prob-
lem of ﬁnding all homomorphic images of A reduces to the “internal” problem of ﬁnding
all congruences on A. The homomorphism theorem is also called “the ﬁrst isomorphism
theorem”.
Deﬁnition 6.13. Suppose A is an algebra and φ, θ ∈Con A with θ ⊆φ. Then let
φ/θ = {⟨a/θ, b/θ⟩∈(A/θ)2 : ⟨a, b⟩∈φ}.
Lemma 6.14. If φ, θ ∈Con A and θ ⊆φ, then φ/θ is a congruence on A/θ.
Proof. Let f be an n-ary function symbol and suppose ⟨ai/θ, bi/θ⟩∈φ/θ, 1 ≤i ≤n. Then
⟨ai, bi⟩∈φ (why?), so
⟨f A(a1, . . . , an), f A(b1, . . . , bn)⟩∈φ,
and thus
⟨f A(a1, . . ., an)/θ, f A(b1, . . . , bn)/θ⟩∈φ/θ.
From this is follows that
⟨f A/θ(a1/θ, . . ., an/θ), f A/θ(b1/θ, . . . , bn/θ⟩∈φ/θ.

Theorem 6.15 (Second Isomorphism Theorem). If φ, θ ∈Con A and θ ⊆φ, then the map
α : (A/θ)/(φ/θ) →A/φ
deﬁned by
α((a/θ)/(φ/θ)) = a/φ
is an isomorphism from (A/θ)/(φ/θ) to A/φ. (See Figure 13.)

Proof. Let a, b ∈A. Then from
(a/θ)/(φ/θ) = (b/θ)/(φ/θ)
iﬀ
a/φ = b/φ
it follows that α is a well-deﬁned bijection.
Now, for f an n-ary function symbol and
a1, . . ., an ∈A we have
αf (A/θ)/(φ/θ)((a1/θ)/(φ/θ), . . ., (an/θ)/(φ/θ)) = α(f A/θ(a1/θ, . . . , an/θ)/(φ/θ))
= α((f A(a1, . . . , an)/θ)/(φ/θ))
= f A(a1, . . ., an)/φ
= f A/φ(a1/φ, . . ., an/φ)
= f A/φ(α((a1/θ)/(φ/θ)), . . ., α((an/θ)/(φ/θ))),
so α is an isomorphism.

Deﬁnition 6.16. Suppose B is a subset of A and θ is a congruence on A. Let Bθ = {a ∈
A : B ∩a/θ ̸= ∅}. Let Bθ be the subalgebra of A generated by Bθ. Also deﬁne θ↾B to be
θ ∩B2, the restriction of θ to B. (See Figure 14, where the dashed-line subdivisions of A are
the equivalence classes of θ.)

Lemma 6.17. If B is a subalgebra of A and θ ∈Con A, then
(a) The universe of Bθ is Bθ.
(b) θ↾B is a congruence on B.
Proof. Suppose f is an n-ary function symbol. For (a) let a1, . . ., an ∈Bθ. Then one can
ﬁnd b1, . . . , bn ∈B such that
⟨ai, bi⟩∈θ,
1 ≤i ≤n,
hence
⟨f A(a1, . . . , an), f A(b1, . . . , bn)⟩∈θ,
so
f A(a1, . . ., an) ∈Bθ.
Thus Bθ is a subuniverse of A. Next, to verify that θ↾B is a congruence on B is straightfor-
ward.

the desired isomorphism.

The last theorem in this section will be quite important in the subsequent study of
subdirectly irreducible algebras. Before looking at this theorem let us note that if L is a
lattice and a, b ∈L with a ≤b then the interval [a, b] is a subuniverse of L.
Deﬁnition 6.19. For [a, b] a closed interval of a lattice L, where a ≤b, let [[[a, b]]] denote the
corresponding sublattice of L.
Theorem 6.20 (Correspondence Theorem). Let A be an algebra and let θ ∈Con A. Then
the mapping α deﬁned on [θ, ∇A] by
α(φ) = φ/θ
is a lattice isomorphism from [[[θ, ∇A]]] to Con A/θ, where [[[θ, ∇A]]] is a sublattice of Con A.
(See Figure 16.)

Figure 16
Proof. To see that α is one-to-one, let φ, ψ ∈[θ, ∇A] with φ ̸= ψ. Then, without loss of
generality, we can assume that there are elements a, b ∈A with ⟨a, b⟩∈φ −ψ. Thus
⟨a/θ, b/θ⟩∈(φ/θ) −(ψ/θ),
so
α(φ) ̸= α(ψ).
To show that α is onto, let ψ ∈Con A/θ and deﬁne φ to be ker(νψνθ). Then for a, b ∈A,
⟨a/θ, b/θ⟩∈φ/θ

⟨a, b⟩∈φ

⟨a/θ, b/θ⟩∈ψ,

so
φ/θ = ψ.
Finally, we will show that α is an isomorphism. If φ, ψ ∈[θ, ∇A] then it is clear that
φ ⊆ψ

φ/θ ⊆ψ/θ

One can readily translate 6.12, 6.15, 6.18, and 6.20 into the (usual) theorems used in
group theory and in ring theory.

1. Show that, under composition, the endomorphisms of an algebra form a monoid, and
the automorphisms form a group.
2. Translate the isomorphism theorems and the correspondence theorem into results about

⟨αa, αb⟩∈Θ(αX).
6. Given two homomorphisms α : A →B and β : A →C, if ker β ⊆ker α and β is onto,
show that there is a homomorphism γ : C →B such that α = γ ◦β.
§7.
Direct Products, Factor Congruences, and
Directly Indecomposable Algebras
The constructions we have looked at so far, namely subalgebras and quotient algebras, do
not give a means of creating algebras of larger cardinality than what we start with, or of
combining several algebras into one.

56
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
Deﬁnition 7.1. Let A1 and A2 be two algebras of the same type F. Deﬁne the (direct)
product A1 × A2 to be the algebra whose universe is the set A1 × A2, and such that for
f ∈Fn and ai ∈A1, a′
i ∈A2, 1 ≤i ≤n,
f A1×A2(⟨a1, a′
1⟩, . . ., ⟨an, a′
n⟩) = ⟨f A1(a1, . . . , an), f A2(a′
1, . . . , a′
n)⟩.
In general neither A1 nor A2 is embeddable in A1 × A2, although in special cases like
groups this is possible because there is always a trivial subalgebra. However, both A1 and
A2 are homomorphic images of A1 × A2.
Deﬁnition 7.2. The mapping
πi : A1 × A2 →Ai,
i ∈{1, 2},
deﬁned by
πi(⟨a1, a2⟩) = ai,
is called the projection map on the i th coordinate of A1 × A2.
Theorem 7.3. For i = 1 or 2 the mapping πi : A1 ×A2 →Ai is a surjective homomorphism
from A = A1 × A2 to Ai. Furthermore, in Con A1 × A2 we have
ker π1 ∩ker π2 = ∆,
ker π1 and ker π2 permute,
and
ker π1 ∨ker π2 = ∇.
Proof. Clearly πi is surjective. If f ∈Fn and ai ∈A1, a′
i ∈A2, 1 ≤i ≤n, then
π1(f A(⟨a1, a′
1⟩, . . . , ⟨an, a′
n⟩)) = π1(⟨f A1(a1, . . . , an), f A2(a′
1, . . . , a′
n)⟩)
= f A1(a1, . . ., an)
= f A1(π1(⟨a1, a′
1⟩), . . . , π1(⟨an, a′
n⟩)),
so π1 is a homomorphism; and similarly π2 is a homomorphism.
Now
⟨⟨a1, a2⟩, ⟨b1, b2⟩⟩∈ker πi
iﬀ
πi(⟨a1, a2⟩) = πi(⟨b1, b2⟩)
iﬀ
ai = bi.
Thus
ker π1 ∩ker π2 = ∆.

§7. Direct Products, Factor Congruences, and Directly Indecomposable Algebras
57
Also if ⟨a1, a2⟩, ⟨b1, b2⟩are any two elements of A1 × A2 then
⟨a1, a2⟩ker π1⟨a1, b2⟩ker π2⟨b1, b2⟩,
so
∇= ker π1 ◦ker π2.
But then ker π1 and ker π2 permute, and their join is ∇.

The last half of Theorem 7.3 motivates the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 7.4. A congruence θ on A is a factor congruence if there is a congruence θ∗on
A such that
θ ∩θ∗= ∆,
θ ∨θ∗= ∇,
and
θ permutes with θ∗.
The pair θ, θ∗is called a pair of factor congruences on A.
Theorem 7.5. If θ, θ∗is a pair of factor congruences on A, then
A ∼= A/θ × A/θ∗
under the map
α(a) = ⟨a/θ, a/θ∗⟩.
Proof. If a, b ∈A and
α(a) = α(b)
then
a/θ = b/θ
and
a/θ∗= b/θ∗,
so
⟨a, b⟩∈θ
and
⟨a, b⟩∈θ∗;
hence
a = b.
This means that α is injective. Next, given a, b ∈A there is a c ∈A with
aθcθ∗b ;

58
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
hence
α(c) = ⟨c/θ, c/θ∗⟩
= ⟨a/θ, b/θ∗⟩,
so α is onto. Finally, for f ∈Fn and a1, . . . , an ∈A,
αf A(a1, . . . , an) = ⟨f A(a1, . . ., an)/θ, f A(a1, . . ., an)/θ∗⟩
= ⟨f A/θ(a1/θ, . . . , an/θ), f A/θ∗(a1/θ∗, . . . , an/θ∗)⟩
= f A/θ×A/θ∗(⟨a1/θ, a1/θ∗⟩, . . ., ⟨an/θ, an/θ∗⟩)
= f A/θ×A/θ∗(αa1, . . . , αan);
hence α is indeed an isomorphism.

Thus we see that factor congruences come from and give rise to direct products.
Deﬁnition 7.6. An algebra A is (directly) indecomposable if A is not isomorphic to a direct
product of two nontrivial algebras.
Example. Any ﬁnite algebra A with |A| a prime number must be directly indecomposable.
From Theorems 7.3 and 7.5 we have the following.
Corollary 7.7. A is directly indecomposable iﬀthe only factor congruences on A are ∆
and ∇.
We can easily generalize the deﬁnition of A1 × A2 as follows.
Deﬁnition 7.8. Let (Ai)i∈I be an indexed family of algebras of type F. The (direct) product
A = Q
i∈I Ai is an algebra with universe Q
i∈I Ai and such that for f ∈Fn and a1, . . . , an ∈
Q
i∈I Ai,
f A(a1, . . . , an)(i) = f Ai(a1(i), . . . , an(i))
for i ∈I, i.e., f A is deﬁned coordinate-wise. The empty product Q ∅is the trivial algebra
with universe {∅}. As before we have projection maps
πj :
Y
i∈I
Ai →Aj
for j ∈I deﬁned by
πj(a) = a(j)
which give surjective homomorphisms

If I = {1, 2, . . ., n} we also write A1 × · · · × An. If I is arbitrary but Ai = A for all i ∈I,
then we usually write AI for the direct product, and call it a (direct) power of A. A
? is a
trivial algebra.
A direct product Q
i∈I Ai of sets is often visualized as a rectangle with base I and vertical
cross sections Ai. An element a of Q
i∈I Ai is then a curve as indicated in Figure 17. Two
elementary facts about direct products are stated next.

Theorem 7.9. If A1, A2, and A3 are of type F then
(a) A1 × A2 ∼= A2 × A1 under α(⟨a1, a2⟩) = ⟨a2, a1⟩.
(b) A1 × (A2 × A3) ∼= A1 × A2 × A3 under α(⟨a1, ⟨a2, a3⟩⟩) = ⟨a1, a2, a3⟩.
Proof. (Exercise.)

In Chapter IV we will see that there is up to isomorphism only one nontrivial directly in-
decomposable Boolean algebra, namely a two-element Boolean algebra, hence by cardinality
considerations it follows that a countably inﬁnite Boolean algebra cannot be isomorphic to
a direct product of directly indecomposable algebras. On the other hand for ﬁnite algebras
we have the following.
Theorem 7.10. Every ﬁnite algebra is isomorphic to a direct product of directly indecom-
posable algebras.
Proof. Let A be a ﬁnite algebra. If A is trivial then A is indecomposable. We proceed by
induction on the cardinality of A. Suppose A is a nontrivial ﬁnite algebra such that for every
B with |B| < |A| we know that B is isomorphic to a product of indecomposable algebras. If
A is indecomposable we are ﬁnished. If not, then A ∼= A1 × A2 with 1 < |A1|, |A2|. Then,
|A1|, |A2| < |A|, so by the induction hypothesis,
A1 ∼= B1 × · · · × Bm,
A2 ∼= C1 × · · · × Cn,

where the Bi and Cj are indecomposable. Consequently,
A ∼= B1 × · · · × Bm × C1 × · · · × Cn.

Using direct products there are two obvious ways (which occur a number of times in
practice) of combining families of homomorphisms into single homomorphisms.
Deﬁnition 7.11. (i) If we are given maps αi : A →Ai, i ∈I, then the natural map
α : A →
Y
i∈I
Ai
is deﬁned by
(αa)(i) = αia.
(ii) If we are given maps αi : Ai →Bi, i ∈I, then the natural map
α :
Y
i∈I
Ai →
Y
i∈I
Bi
is deﬁned by
(αa)(i) = αi(a(i)).
Theorem 7.12. (a) If αi : A →Ai, i ∈I, is an indexed family of homomorphisms, then
the natural map α is a homomorphism from A to A∗= Q
i∈I Ai.
(b) If αi : Ai →Bi, i ∈I, is an indexed family of homomorphisms, then the natural map
α is a homomorphism from A∗= Q
i∈I Ai to B∗= Q
i∈I Bi.
Proof. Suppose αi : A →Ai is a homomorphism for i ∈I. Then for a1, . . . , an ∈A and
f ∈Fn we have, for i ∈I,
(αf A(a1, . . ., an))(i) = αif A(a1, . . . , an)
= f Ai(αia1, . . . , αian)
= f Ai((αa1)(i), . . . , (αan)(i))
= f A∗(αa1, . . . , αan)(i);
hence
αf A(a1, . . . , an) = f A∗(αa1, . . . , αan),
so α is indeed a homomorphism in (a) above. Case (b) is a consequence of (a) using the
homomorphisms αi ◦πi.

Deﬁnition 7.13. If a1, a2 ∈A and α : A →B is a map we say α separates a1 and a2 if
αa1 ̸= αa2.
The maps αi : A →Ai, i ∈I, separate points if for each a1, a2 ∈A with a1 ̸= a2 there is an
αi such that
αi(a1) ̸= αi(a2).
Lemma 7.14.
For an indexed family of maps αi : A →Ai, i ∈I, the following are
equivalent:
(a) The maps αi separate points.
(b) α is injective (α is the natural map of 7.11(a)).
(c) T
i∈I ker αi = ∆.
Proof. (a) ⇒(b): Suppose a1, a2 ∈A and a1 ̸= a2. Then for some i,
αi(a1) ̸= αi(a2);
hence
(αa1)(i) ̸= (αa2)(i)
so
αa1 ̸= αa2.
(b) ⇒(c): For a1, a2 ∈A with a1 ̸= a2, we have
αa1 ̸= αa2;
hence
(αa1)(i) ̸= (αa2)(i)
for some i, so
αia1 ̸= αia2
for some i, and this implies
⟨a1, a2⟩̸∈ker αi,
so
\
i∈I
ker αi = ∆.
(c) ⇒(a): For a1, a2 ∈A with a1 ̸= a2,
⟨a1, a2⟩̸∈

i∈I

so, for some i,
⟨a1, a2⟩̸∈ker αi;
hence
αia1 ̸= αia2.

Theorem 7.15. If we are given an indexed family of homomorphisms αi : A →Ai, i ∈I,
then the natural homomorphism α : A →Q

Subdirect Products, Subdirectly Irreducible
Algebras, and Simple Algebras
Although every ﬁnite algebra is isomorphic to a direct product of directly indecomposable
algebras, the same does not hold for inﬁnite algebras in general. For example, we see that a
denumerable vector space over a ﬁnite ﬁeld cannot be isomorphic to a direct product of one-
dimensional spaces by merely considering cardinalities. The quest for general building blocks
in the study of universal algebra led Birkhoﬀto consider subdirectly irreducible algebras.
Deﬁnition 8.1. An algebra A is a subdirect product of an indexed family (Ai)i∈I of algebras
if
(i) A ≤Q
i∈I Ai
and
(ii) πi(A) = Ai for each i ∈I.

§8. Subdirect Products, Subdirectly Irreducible Algebras, and Simple Algebras
63
An embedding α : A →Q
i∈I Ai is subdirect if α(A) is a subdirect product of the Ai.
Note that if I = ∅then A is a subdirect product of ∅iﬀA = Q ∅, a trivial algebra.
Lemma 8.2. If θi ∈Con A for i ∈I and T
i∈I θi = ∆, then the natural homomorphism
ν : A →
Y
i∈I
A/θi
deﬁned by
ν(a)(i) = a/θi
is a subdirect embedding.
Proof. Let νi be the natural homomorphism from A to A/θi for i ∈I. As ker νi = θi,
it follows from 7.15 that ν is an embedding. Since each νi is surjective, ν is a subdirect
embedding.

Deﬁnition 8.3. An algebra A is subdirectly irreducible if for every subdirect embedding
α : A →
Y
i∈I
Ai
there is an i ∈I such that
πi ◦α : A →Ai
is an isomorphism.
The following characterization of subdirectly irreducible algebras is most useful in prac-
tice.
Theorem 8.4. An algebra A is subdirectly irreducible iﬀA is trivial or there is a minimum
congruence in Con A −{∆}. In the latter case the minimum element is T(Con A −{∆}),
a principal congruence, and the congruence lattice of A looks like the diagram in Figure 18.
(Con A - {∆})
∆
∆
Figure 18

64
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
Proof. (⇒) If A is not trivial and Con A−{∆} has no minimum element then T(Con A−
{∆}) = ∆. Let I = Con A −{∆}. Then the natural map α : A →Q
θ∈I A/θ is a subdirect
embedding by Lemma 8.2, and as the natural map A →A/θ is not injective for θ ∈I, it
follows that A is not subdirectly irreducible.
(⇐) If A is trivial and α : A →Q
i∈I Ai is a subdirect embedding then each Ai is
trivial; hence each πi ◦α is an isomorphism.
So suppose A is not trivial, and let θ =
T(Con A−{∆}) ̸= ∆. Choose ⟨a, b⟩∈θ, a ̸= b. If α : A →Q
i∈I Ai is a subdirect embedding
then for some i, (αa)(i) ̸= (αb)(i); hence (πi ◦α)(a) ̸= (πi ◦α)(b). Thus ⟨a, b⟩̸∈ker(πi ◦α)
so θ ⊈ker(πi ◦α). But this implies ker(πi ◦α) = ∆, so πi ◦α : A →Ai is an isomorphism.
Consequently A is subdirectly irreducible.
If Con A −{∆} has a minimum element θ then for a ̸= b and ⟨a, b⟩∈θ we have
Θ(a, b) ⊆θ, hence θ = Θ(a, b).

Using 8.4, we can readily list some subdirectly irreducible algebras.
Examples. (1) A ﬁnite Abelian group G is subdirectly irreducible iﬀit is cyclic and |G| = pn
for some prime p.
(2) The group Zp∞is subdirectly irreducible.
(3) Every simple group is subdirectly irreducible.
(4) A vector space over a ﬁeld F is subdirectly irreducible iﬀit is trivial or one-dimensional.
(5) Any two-element algebra is subdirectly irreducible.
A directly indecomposable algebra need not be subdirectly irreducible.
For example
consider a three-element chain as a lattice. But the converse does indeed hold.
Theorem 8.5. A subdirectly irreducible algebra is directly indecomposable.
Proof. Clearly the only factor congruences on a subdirectly irreducible algebra are ∆and
∇, so by 7.7 such an algebra is directly indecomposable.

Theorem 8.6 (Birkhoﬀ). Every algebra A is isomorphic to a subdirect product of subdirectly
irreducible algebras (which are homomorphic images of A).
Proof. As trivial algebras are subdirectly irreducible we only need to consider the case of
nontrivial A. For a, b ∈A with a ̸= b we can ﬁnd, using Zorn’s lemma, a congruence θa,b
on A which is maximal with respect to the property ⟨a, b⟩̸∈θa,b. Then clearly Θ(a, b) ∨
θa,b is the smallest congruence in [θa,b, ∇] −{θa,b}, so by 6.20 and 8.4 we see that A/θa,b
is subdirectly irreducible.
As T{θa,b : a ̸= b} = ∆we can apply 8.2 to show that A
is subdirectly embeddable in the product of the indexed family of subdirectly irreducible
algebras (A/θa,b)a̸=b.
An immediate consequence of 8.6 is the following.

§8. Subdirect Products, Subdirectly Irreducible Algebras, and Simple Algebras
65
Corollary 8.7. Every ﬁnite algebra is isomorphic to a subdirect product of a ﬁnite number
of subdirectly irreducible ﬁnite algebras.
Although subdirectly irreducible algebras do form the building blocks of algebra, the
subdirect product construction is so ﬂexible that one is often unable to draw signiﬁcant
conclusions for a class of algebras by studying its subdirectly irreducible members. In some
special yet interesting cases we can derive an improved version of Birkhoﬀ’s theorem which
permits a much deeper insight—this will be the theme of Chapter IV.
Next we look at a special kind of subdirectly irreducible algebra. This deﬁnition extends
the usual notion of a simple group or a simple ring to arbitrary algebras.
Deﬁnition 8.8. An algebra A is simple if Con A = {∆, ∇}. A congruence θ on an algebra
A is maximal if the interval [θ, ∇] of Con A has exactly two elements.
Many algebraists prefer to require that a simple algebra be nontrivial. For our devel-
opment, particularly for the material in Chapter IV, we ﬁnd the discussion smoother by
admitting trivial algebras.
Just as the quotient of a group by a normal subgroup is simple and nontrivial iﬀthe
normal subgroup if maximal, we have a similar result for arbitrary algebras.
Theorem 8.9. Let θ ∈Con A. Then A/θ is a simple algebra iﬀθ is a maximal congruence
on A or θ = ∇.
Proof. We know that
Con A/θ ∼= [[[θ, ∇A]]]
by 6.20, so the theorem is an immediate consequence of 8.8.

Class Operators and Varieties
A major theme in universal algebra is the study of classes of algebras of the same type closed
under one or more constructions.
Deﬁnition 9.1. We introduce the following operators mapping classes of algebras to classes
of algebras (all of the same type):
A ∈I(K) iﬀA is isomorphic to some member of K
A ∈S(K) iﬀA is a subalgebra of some member of K

§9. Class Operators and Varieties
67
A ∈H(K) iﬀA is a homomorphic image of some member of K
A ∈P(K) iﬀA is a direct product of a nonempty family of algebras in K
A ∈PS(K) iﬀA is a subdirect product of a nonempty family of algebras in K.
If O1 and O2 are two operators on classes of algebras we write O1O2 for the composition of
the two operators, and ≤denotes the usual partial ordering, i.e., O1 ≤O2 if O1(K) ⊆O2(K)
for all classes of algebras K. An operator O is idempotent if O2 = O. A class K of algebras
is closed under an operator O if O(K) ⊆K.
Our convention that P and PS apply only to non-empty indexed families of algebras is the
convention followed by model theorists. Thus for any operator O above, O(∅) = ∅. Many
algebraists prefer to include Q ∅, guaranteeing that P(K) and PS(K) always contain a trivial
algebra. However this leads to problems formulating certain preservation theorems—see V§2.
For us Q ∅is really used only in IV§1, §5 and §7.
Lemma 9.2. The following inequalities hold: SH ≤HS, PS ≤SP, and PH ≤HP. Also
the operators, H, S, and IP are idempotent.
Proof. Suppose A = SH(K). Then for some B ∈K and onto homomorphism α : B →C,
we have A ≤C. Thus α−1(A) ≤B, and as α(α−1(A)) = A, we have A ∈HS(K).
If A ∈PS(K) then A = Q
i∈I Ai for suitable Ai ≤Bi ∈K, i ∈I. As Q
i∈I Ai ≤Q
i∈I Bi,
we have A ∈SP(K).
Next if A ∈PH(K), then there are algebras Bi ∈K and epimorphisms αi : Bi →Ai
such that A = Q
i∈I Ai. It is easy to check that the mapping α : Q
i∈I Bi →Q
i∈I Ai deﬁned
by α(b)(i) = αi(b(i)) is an epimorphism; hence A ∈HP(K).
Finally it is a routine exercise to verify that H2 = H, etc.

Deﬁnition 9.3. A nonempty class K of algebras of type F is called a variety if it is closed
under subalgebras, homomorphic images, and direct products.
As the intersection of a class of varieties of type F is again a variety, and as all algebras
of type F form a variety, we can conclude that for every class K of algebras of the same type
there is a smallest variety containing K.
Deﬁnition 9.4. If K is a class of algebras of the same type let V (K) denote the smallest
variety containing K. We say that V (K) is the variety generated by K. If K has a single
member A we write simply V (A). A variety V is ﬁnitely generated if V = V (K) for some
ﬁnite set K of ﬁnite algebras.
Theorem 9.5 (Tarski). V = HSP.
Proof. Since HV = SV = IPV = V and I ≤V it follows that HSP ≤HSPV = V. From
Lemma 9.2 we see that H(HSP) = HSP, S(HSP) ≤HSSP = HSP, and P(HSP) ≤
HPSP ≤HSPP ≤HSIPIP = HSIP ≤HSHP ≤HHSP = HSP; hence for any

68
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
K, HSP(K) is closed under H, S, and P. As V (K) is the smallest class containing K and
closed under H, S, and P, we must have V = HSP.

Another description of the operator V will be given at the end of §11. The following
version of Birkhoﬀ’s Theorem 8.6 is useful in studying varieties.
Theorem 9.6. If K is a variety, then every member of K is isomorphic to a subdirect
product of subdirectly irreducible members of K.
Corollary 9.7. A variety is determined by its subdirectly irreducible members.

Terms, Term Algebras, and Free Algebras
Given an algebra A there are usually many functions besides the fundamental operations
which are compatible with the congruences on A and which “preserve” subalgebras of A. The
most obvious functions of this type are those obtained by compositions of the fundamental
operations. This leads us to the study of terms.
Deﬁnition 10.1. Let X be a set of (distinct) objects called variables. Let F be a type of
algebras. The set T(X) of terms of type F over X is the smallest set such that
(i) X ∪F0 ⊆T(X).

§10. Terms, Term Algebras, and Free Algebras
69
(ii) If p1, . . . , pn ∈T(X) and f ∈Fn then the “string” f(p1, . . . , pn) ∈T(X).
For a binary function symbol · we usually prefer p1 ·p2 to ·(p1, p2). For p ∈T(X) we often
write p as p(x1, . . ., xn) to indicate that the variables occurring in p are among x1, . . . , xn. A
term p is n-ary if the number of variables appearing explicitly in p is ≤n.
Examples. (1) Let F consist of a single binary function symbol ·, and let X = {x, y, z}.
Then
x, y, z, x · y, y · z, x · (y · z), and (x · y) · z
are some of the terms over X.
(2) Let F consist of two binary operation symbols + and ·, and let X be as before. Then
x, y, z, x · (y + z), and (x · y) + (x · z)
are some of the terms over X.
(3) The classical polynomials over the ﬁeld of real numbers R are really the terms as
deﬁned above of type F consisting of +, ·, and −together with a nullary function symbol r
for each r ∈R.
In elementary algebra one often thinks of an n-ary polynomial over R as a function from
Rn to R for some n. This can be applied to terms as well.
Deﬁnition 10.2. Given a term p(x1, . . . , xn) of type F over some set X and given an algebra
A of type F we deﬁne a mapping pA : An →A as follows:
(1) if p is a variable xi, then
pA(a1, . . . , an) = ai
for a1, . . ., an ∈A, i.e., pA is the ith projection map;
(2) if p is of the form f(p1(x1, . . . , xn), . . ., pk(x1, . . ., xn)), where f ∈Fk, then
pA(a1, . . . , an) = f A(pA
1 (a1, . . . , an), . . ., pA
k (a1, . . . , an)).
In particular if p = f ∈F then pA = f A. pA is the term function on A corresponding to the
term p. (Often we will drop the superscript A).
The next theorem gives some useful properties of term functions, namely they behave
like fundamental operations insofar as congruences and homomorphisms are concerned, and
they can be used to describe the closure operator Sg of §3 in a most eﬃcient manner.
Theorem 10.3. For any type F and algebras A, B of type F we have the following.
(a) Let p be an n-ary term of type F, let θ ∈Con A, and suppose ⟨ai, bi⟩∈θ for 1 ≤i ≤n.
Then
pA(a1, . . . , an)θpA(b1, . . . , bn).

70
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
(b) If p is an n-ary term of type F and α : A →B is a homomorphism, then
αpA(a1, . . . , an) = pB(αa1, . . . , αan)
for a1, . . . , an ∈A.
(c) Let S be a subset of A. Then
Sg(S) = {pA(a1, . . . , an) : p is an n-ary term of type F, n < ω, and a1, . . . , an ∈S}.
Proof. Given a term p deﬁne the length l(p) of p to be the number of occurences of n-ary
operation symbols in p for n ≥1. Note that l(p) = 0 iﬀp ∈X ∪F0.
(a) We proceed by induction on l(p). If l(p) = 0, then either p = xi for some i, whence
⟨pA(a1, . . ., an), pA(b1, . . . , bn)⟩= ⟨ai, bi⟩∈θ
or p = a for some a ∈F0, whence
⟨pA(a1, . . . , an), pA(b1, . . . , bn)⟩= ⟨aA, aA⟩∈θ.
Now suppose l(p) > 0 and the assertion holds for every term q with l(q) < l(p). Then we
know p is of the form
f(p1(x1, . . . , xn), . . . , pk(x1, . . . , xn)),
and as l(pi) < l(p) we must have, for 1 ≤i ≤k,
⟨pA
i (a1, . . . , an), pA
i (b1, . . . , bn)⟩∈θ;
hence
⟨f A(pA
1 (a1, . . . , an), . . . , pA
k (a1, . . ., an)), f A(pA
1 (b1, . . . , bn), . . . , pA
k (b1, . . ., bn))⟩∈θ,
and consequently
⟨pA(a1, . . . , an), pA(b1, . . . , bn)⟩∈θ.
(b) The proof of this is an induction argument on l(p).
(c) Referring to §3 one can give an induction proof, for k ≥1, of
Ek(S) = {pA(a1, . . . , an) : p is an n-ary term, l(p) ≤k, n < ω, a1, . . . , an ∈S},
and thus
Sg(S) =
[
k<∞
Ek(S) = {pA(a1, . . . , an) : p is an n-ary term, n < ω, a1, . . . , an ∈S}.

One can, in a natural way, transform the set T(X) into an algebra.
Deﬁnition 10.4. Given F and X, if T(X) ̸= ∅then the term algebra of type F over X,
written T(X), has as its universe the set T(X), and the fundamental operations satisfy
f T(X) : ⟨p1, . . . , pn⟩7→f(p1, . . . , pn)
for f ∈Fn and pi ∈T(X), 1 ≤i ≤n. (T(∅) exists iﬀF0 ̸= ∅.)
Note that T(X) is indeed generated by X. Term algebras provide us with the simplest
examples of algebras with the universal mapping property.
Deﬁnition 10.5. Let K be a class of algebras of type F and let U(X) be an algebra of type
F which is generated by X. If for every A ∈K and for every map
α : X →A
there is a homomorphism
β : U(X) →A
which extends α (i.e., β(x) = α(x) for x ∈X), then we say U(X) has the universal mapping
property for K over X, X is called a set of free generators of U(X), and U(X) is said to be
freely generated by X.
Lemma 10.6. Suppose U(X) has the universal mapping property for K over X. Then if
we are given A ∈K and α : X →A, there is a unique extension β of α such that β is a
homomorphism from U(X) to A.
Proof. This follows simply from noting that a homomorphism is completely determined
by how it maps a set of generators (see 6.2) from the domain.

The next result says that for a given cardinal m there is, up to isomorphism, at most
one algebra in a class K which has the universal mapping property for K over a set of free
generators of size m.
Theorem 10.7. Suppose U1(X1) and U2(X2) are two algebras in a class K with the univer-
sal mapping property for K over the indicated sets. If |X1| = |X2|, then U1(X1) ∼= U2(X2).
Proof. First note that the identity map
ıj : Xj →Xj,
j = 1, 2,
has as its unique extension to a homomorphism from Uj(Xj) to Uj(Xj) the identity map.
Now let
α : X1 →X2

72
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
be a bijection. Then we have a homomorphism
β : U1(X1) →U2(X2)
extending α, and a homomorphism
γ : U2(X2) →U1(X1)
extending α−1. As β ◦γ is an endomorphism of U2(X2) extending ı2, it follows by 10.6 that
β ◦γ is the identity map on U2(X2). Likewise γ ◦β is the identity map on U1(X1). Thus β
is a bijection, so U1(X1) ∼= U2(X2).

Theorem 10.8. For any type F and set X of variables, where X ̸= ∅if F0 = ∅, the term
algebra T(X) has the universal mapping property for the class of all algebras of type F over
X.
Proof. Let α : X →A where A is of type F. Deﬁne
β : T(X) →A
recursively by
βx = αx
for x ∈X, and
β(f(p1, . . . , pn)) = f A(βp1, . . ., βpn)
for p1, . . . , pn ∈T(X) and f ∈Fn. Then β(p(x1, . . ., xn)) = pA(αx1, . . . , αxn), and β is the
desired homomorphism extending α.

Thus given any class K of algebras the term algebras provide algebras which have the
universal mapping property for K. To study properties of classes of algebras we often try to
ﬁnd special kinds of algebras in these classes which yield the desired information. Directly
indecomposable and subdirectly irreducible algebras are two examples which we have already
encountered. In order to ﬁnd algebras with the universal mapping property for K which
give more insight into K we will introduce K-free algebras. Unfortunately not every class K
contains algebras with the universal mapping property for K. Nonetheless we will be able to
show that any class closed under I, S, and P contains its K-free algebras. There is reasonable
diﬃculty in providing transparent descriptions of K-free algebras for most K. However, most
of the applications of K-free algebras come directly from the universal mapping property,
the fact that they exist in varieties, and their relation to identities holding in K (which
we will examine in the next section). A proper understanding of free algebras is essential
in our development of universal algebra—we use them to show varieties are the same as
classes deﬁned by equations (Birkhoﬀ), to give useful characterizations (Mal’cev conditions)
of important properties of varieties, and to show every nontrivial variety contains a nontrivial
simple algebra (Magari).

§10. Terms, Term Algebras, and Free Algebras

Deﬁnition 10.9. Let K be a family of algebras of type F. Given a set X of variables deﬁne
the congruence θK(X) on T(X) by
θK(X) =
\
ΦK(X),
where
ΦK(X) = {φ ∈Con T(X) : T(X)/φ ∈IS(K)};
and then deﬁne FK(X), the K-free algebra over X, by
FK(X) = T(X)/θK(X),
where
X = X/θK(X).
For x ∈X we write x for x/θK(X), and for p = p(x1, . . . , xn) ∈T(X) we write p for
pFK(X)(x1, . . . , xn). If X is ﬁnite, say X = {x1, . . . , xn}, we often write FK(x1, . . . , xn) for
FK(X). FK(X) is the universe of FK(X).
Remarks.
(1) FK(X) exists iﬀT(X) exists iﬀX ̸= ∅or F0 ̸= ∅. (2) If FK(X) exists, then X is a set of
generators of FK(X) as X generates T(X). (3) If F0 ̸= ∅, then the algebra FK(∅) is often
referred to as an initial object by category theorists and computer scientists. (4) If K = ∅or
K consists solely of trivial algebras, then FK(X) is a trivial algebra as θK(X) = ∇. (5) If K
has a nontrivial algebra A and T(X) exists, then X ∩(x/θK(X)) = {x} as distinct members
x, y of X can be separated by some homomorphism α : T(X) →A. In this case |X| = |X|.
(6) If |X| = |Y | and T(X) exists, then clearly FK(X) ∼= FK(Y ) under an isomorphism which
maps X to Y as T(X) ∼= T(Y ) under an isomorphism mapping X to Y. Thus FK(X) is
determined, up to isomorphism, by K and |X|.
Theorem 10.10 (Birkhoﬀ). Suppose T(X) exists. Then FK(X) has the universal mapping
property for K over X.
Proof. Given A ∈K let α be a map from X to A. Let ν : T(X) →FK(X) be the
natural homomorphism. Then α ◦ν maps X into A, so by the universal mapping property
of T(X) there is a homomorphism µ : T(X) →A extending α ◦ν↾X . From the deﬁnition
of θK(X) it is clear that θK(X) ⊆ker µ (as ker µ ∈ΦK(X)). Thus there is a homomorphism
β : FK(X) →A such that µ = β ◦ν (see §6 Exercise 6) as ker ν = θK(X). But then, for
x ∈X,
β(x) = β ◦ν(x)
= µ(x)
= α ◦ν(x)
= α(x),

74
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
so β extends α. Thus FK(X) has the universal mapping property for K over X.

If FK(X) ∈K then it is, up to isomorphism, the unique algebra in K with the universal
mapping property freely generated by a set of generators of size |X|. Actually every algebra
in K with the universal mapping property for K is isomorphic to a K-free algebra (see
Exercise 6).
Examples. (1) It is clear that T(X) is isomorphic to the free algebra with respect to the
class K of all algebras of type F over X since θK(X) = ∆. The corresponding free algebra
is sometimes called the absolutely free algebra F(X) of type F.
(2) Given X let X∗be the set of ﬁnite strings of elements of X, including the empty
string. We can construct a monoid ⟨X∗, ·, 1⟩by deﬁning · to be concatenation, and 1 is the
empty string. By checking the universal mapping property one sees that ⟨X∗, ·, 1⟩is, up to
isomorphism, the free monoid freely generated by X.
Corollary 10.11. If K is a class of algebras of type F and A ∈K, then for suﬃciently
large X, A ∈H(FK(X)).
Proof. Choose |X| ≥|A| and let
α : X →A
be a surjection. Then let
β : FK(X) →A
be a homomorphism extending α.

In general FK(X) is not isomorphic to a member of K (for example, let K = {L} where
L is a two-element lattice; then FK(x, y) ̸∈I(K)). However FK(X) can be embedded in a
product of members of K.
Theorem 10.12 (Birkhoﬀ). Suppose T(X) exists. Then for K ̸= ∅, FK(X) ∈ISP(K).
Thus if K is closed under I, S, and P, in particular if K is a variety, then FK(X) ∈K.
Proof. As
θK(X) =
\
ΦK(X)
it follows (see §8 Exercise 11) that
FK(X) = T(X)/θK(X) ∈IPS({T(X)/θ : θ ∈ΦK(X)}),
so
FK(X) ∈IPSIS(K),

§10. Terms, Term Algebras, and Free Algebras
75
and thus by 9.2 and the fact that PS ≤SP,
FK(X) ∈ISP(K).

From an earlier theorem of Birkhoﬀwe know that if a variety has a nontrivial algebra in
it then it must have a nontrivial subdirectly irreducible algebra in it. The next result shows
that such a variety must also contain a nontrivial simple algebra.
Theorem 10.13 (Magari). If we are given a variety V with a nontrivial member, then V
contains a nontrivial simple algebra.
Proof. Let X = {x, y}, and let
S = {p(x) : p ∈T({x})},
a subset of FV (X). First suppose that Θ(S) ̸= ∇in Con FV (X). Then by Zorn’s lemma
there is a maximal element in [Θ(S), ∇]−{∇}. (The key observation for this step is that for
θ ∈[Θ(S), ∇],
θ = ∇
iﬀ
⟨x, y⟩∈θ.
To see this note that if ⟨x, y⟩∈θ and Θ(S) ⊆θ, then for any term p(x, y), with F = FV (X)
we have
pF(x, y)θpF(x, x)Θ(S)x;
hence θ = ∇.) Let θ0 be a maximal element in [Θ(S), ∇] −{∇}. Then FV (X)/θ0 is a simple
algebra by 8.9, and it is in V.
If, however, Θ(S) = ∇, then since Θ is an algebraic closure operator by 5.5, it follows
that for some ﬁnite subset S0 of S we must have ⟨x, y⟩∈Θ(S0). Let S be the subalgebra
of FV (X) with universe S (note that S = Sg({x}) by 10.3(c)). As V is nontrivial we must
have x ̸= y in FV (X), and as ⟨x, y⟩∈Θ(S) it follows that S is nontrivial. Now we claim
that ∇S = Θ(S0), where Θ in this case is understood to be the appropriate closure operator
on S. To see this let p(x) ∈S and let
α : FV (X) →S
be the homomorphism deﬁned by
α(x) = x
α(y) = p(x).
As
⟨x, y⟩∈Θ(S0)
in FV (X),

76
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
it follows from 6.6 (see §6 Exercise 5) that
⟨x, p(x)⟩∈Θ(S0)
in S
as
α(S0) = S0.
This establishes our claim; hence using Zorn’s lemma we can ﬁnd a maximal congruence θ
on S as ∇S is ﬁnitely generated. Hence S/θ is a simple algebra in V.

Let us turn to another application of free algebras.
Deﬁnition 10.14. An algebra A is locally ﬁnite if every ﬁnitely generated subalgebra (see
§3.4) is ﬁnite. A class K of algebras is locally ﬁnite if every member of K is locally ﬁnite.
Theorem 10.15. A variety V is locally ﬁnite iﬀ
|X| < ω ⇒|FV (X)| < ω.
Proof. The direction (⇒) is clear as X generates FV (X). For (⇐) let A be a ﬁnitely
generated member of V, and let B ⊆A be a ﬁnite set of generators. Choose X such that we
have a bijection
α : X →B.
Extend this to a homomorphism
β : FV (X) →A.
As β(FV (X)) is a subalgebra of A containing B, it must equal A. Thus β is surjective, and
as FV (X) is ﬁnite so is A.

Theorem 10.16. Let K be a ﬁnite set of ﬁnite algebras. Then V (K) is a locally ﬁnite
variety.
Proof. First verify that P(K) is locally ﬁnite. To do this deﬁne an equivalence relation
∼on T({x1, . . . , xn}) by p ∼q if the term functions corresponding to p and q are the
same for each member of K. Use the ﬁniteness conditions to show that ∼has ﬁnitely many
equivalence classes. This, combined with 10.3(c), suﬃces. Then it easily follows that V is
locally ﬁnite since every ﬁnitely generated member of HSP(K) is a homomorphic image of
a ﬁnitely generated member of SP(K).

Identities, Free Algebras, and Birkhoﬀ’s Theorem
One of the most celebrated theorems of Birkhoﬀsays that the classes of algebras deﬁned
by identities are precisely those which are closed under H, S, and P. In this section we
study identities, their relation to free algebras, and then give several applications, including
Birkhoﬀ’s theorem. We have already seen particular examples of identities, among which are
the commutative law, the associative law, and the distributive laws. Now let us formalize
the general notion of an identity, and the notion of an identity holding in an algebra A, or
in a class of algebras K.
Deﬁnition 11.1 An identity of type F over X is an expression of the form
p ≈q

78
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
where p, q ∈T(X). Let Id(X) be the set of identities of type F over X. An algebra A of type
F satisﬁes an identity
p(x1, . . . , xn) ≈q(x1, . . . , xn)
(or the identity is true in A, or holds in A), abbreviated by
A |= p(x1, . . . , xn) ≈q(x1, . . . , xn),
or more brieﬂy
A |= p ≈q,
if for every choice of a1, . . ., an ∈A we have
pA(a1, . . . , an) = qA(a1, . . . , an).
A class K of algebras satisﬁes p ≈q, written
K |= p ≈q,
if each member of K satisﬁes p ≈q. If Σ is a set of identities, we say K satisﬁes Σ, written
K |= Σ,
if K |= p ≈q for each p ≈q ∈Σ. Given K and X let
IdK(X) = {p ≈q ∈Id(X) : K |= p ≈q}.
We use the symbol ̸|= for “does not satisfy.”
We can reformulate the above deﬁnition of satisfaction using the notion of homomor-
phism.
Lemma 11.2. If K is a class of algebras of type F and p ≈q is an identity of type F over
X, then
K |= p ≈q
iﬀfor every A ∈K and for every homomorphism α : T(X) →A we have
αp = αq.
Proof. (⇒) Let p = p(x1, . . . , xn), q = q(x1, . . ., xn). Suppose K |= p ≈q, A ∈K, and
α : T(X) →A is a homomorphism. Then
pA(αx1, . . . , αxn) = qA(αx1, . . ., αxn)
⇒αpT(X)(x1, . . ., xn) = αqT(X)(x1, . . . , xn)
⇒αp = αq.

§11. Identities, Free Algebras, and Birkhoﬀ’s Theorem
79
(⇐) For the converse choose A ∈K and a1, . . . , an ∈A. By the universal mapping
property of T(X) there is a homomorphism α : T(X) →A such that
αxi = ai,
1 ≤i ≤n.
But then
pA(a1, . . . , an) = pA(αx1, . . ., αxn)
= αp
= αq
= qA(αx1, . . . , αxn)
= qA(a1, . . . an),
so K |= p ≈q.

Next we see that the basic class operators preserve identities.
Lemma 11.3. For any class K of type F all of the classes K, I(K), S(K), H(K), P(K)
and V (K) satisfy the same identities over any set of variables X.
Proof. Clearly K and I(K) satisfy the same identities. As
I ≤IS,
I ≤H,
and
I ≤IP,
we must have
IdK(X) ⊇IdS(K)(X),
IdH(K)(X),
and
IdP (K)(X).
For the remainder of the proof suppose
K |= p(x1, . . . , xn) ≈q(x1, . . . , xn).
Then if B ≤A ∈K and b1, . . ., bn ∈B, then as b1, . . . , bn ∈A we have
pA(b1, . . . , bn) = qA(b1, . . . , bn);
hence
pB(b1, . . . , bn) = qB(b1, . . ., bn),
so
B |= p ≈q.
Thus
IdK(X) = IdS(K)(X).

80
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
Next suppose α : A →B is a surjective homomorphism with A ∈K. If b1, . . . , bn ∈B,
choose a1, . . . , an ∈A such that
α(a1) = b1,
. . . ,
α(an) = bn.
Then
pA(a1, . . . , an) = qA(a1, . . . , an)
implies
αpA(a1, . . . , an) = αqA(a1, . . ., an);
hence
pB(b1, . . . , bn) = qB(b1, . . ., bn).
Thus
B |= p ≈q,
so
IdK(X) = IdH(K)(X).
Lastly, suppose Ai ∈K for i ∈I. Then for a1, . . ., an ∈A = Q
i∈I Ai we have
pAi(a1(i), . . . , an(i)) = qAi(a1(i), . . . , an(i));
hence
pA(a1, . . ., an)(i) = qA(a1, . . . , an)(i)
for i ∈I, so
pA(a1, . . . , an) = qA(a1, . . . , an).
Thus
IdK(X) = IdP (K)(X).
As V = HSP by 9.5, the proof is complete.

Now we will formulate the crucial connection between K-free algebras and identities.
Theorem 11.4. Given a class K of algebras of type F and terms p, q ∈T(X) of type F we
have
K |= p ≈q
⇔FK(X) |= p ≈q
⇔p = q
in
FK(X)
⇔⟨p, q⟩∈θK(X).

§11. Identities, Free Algebras, and Birkhoﬀ’s Theorem
81
Proof. Let F = FK(X), p = p(x1, . . . , xn), q = q(x1, . . ., xn), and let
ν : T(X) →F
be the natural homomorphism. Certainly K |= p ≈q implies F |= p ≈q as F ∈ISP(K).
Suppose next that F |= p ≈q. Then
pF(x1, . . . , xn) = qF(x1, . . . , xn),
hence p = q. Now suppose p = q in F. Then
ν(p) = p = q = ν(q),
so
⟨p, q⟩∈ker ν = θK(X).
Finally suppose ⟨p, q⟩∈θK(X). Given A ∈K and a1, . . . , an ∈A choose α : T(X) →A
such that αxi = ai, 1 ≤i ≤n. As ker α ∈ΦK(X) we have
ker α ⊇ker ν = θK(X),
so it follows that there is a homomorphism β : F →A such that α = β ◦ν (see §6 Exercise
6). Then
α(p) = β ◦ν(p) = β ◦ν(q) = α(q).
Consequently
K |= p ≈q
by 11.2.

Corollary 11.5. Let K be a class of algebras of type F, and suppose p, q ∈T(X). Then for
any set of variables Y with |Y | ≥|X| we have
K |= p ≈q
iﬀ
FK(Y ) |= p ≈q.
Proof. The direction (⇒) is obvious as FK(Y ) ∈ISP(K). For the converse choose X0 ⊇X
such that |X0| = |Y |. Then
FK(X0) ∼= FK(Y ),
and as
K |= p ≈q
iﬀ
FK(X0) |= p ≈q
by 11.4 it follows that
K |= p ≈q
iﬀ
FK(Y ) |= p ≈q.

II The Elements of Universal Algebra
Corollary 11.6. Suppose K is a class of algebras of type F and X is a set of variables.
Then for any inﬁnite set of variables Y,
IdK(X) = IdFK(Y )(X).
Proof. For p ≈q ∈IdK(X), say p = p(x1, . . . , xn), q = q(x1, . . . , xn), we have p, q ∈
T({x1, . . . , xn}). As |{x1, . . . , xn}| < |Y |, by 11.5
K |= p ≈q
iﬀ
FK(Y ) |= p ≈q,
so the corollary is proved.

As we have seen in §1, many of the most popular classes of algebras are deﬁned by
identities.
Deﬁnition 11.7. Let Σ be a set of identities of type F, and deﬁne M(Σ) to be the class
of algebras A satisfying Σ. A class K of algebras is an equational class if there is a set of
identities Σ such that K = M(Σ). In this case we say that K is deﬁned, or axiomatized, by
Σ.
Lemma 11.8. If V is a variety and X is an inﬁnite set of variables, then V = M(IdV (X)).
Proof. Let
V ′ = M(IdV (X)).
Clearly V ′ is a variety by 11.3, V ′ ⊇V, and
IdV ′(X) = IdV (X).
So by 11.4,
FV ′(X) = FV (X).
Now given any inﬁnite set of variables Y, we have by 11.6
IdV ′(Y ) = IdFV ′(X)(Y ) = IdFV (X)(Y ) = IdV (Y ).
Thus again by 11.4,
θV ′(Y ) = θV (Y );
hence
FV ′(Y ) = FV (Y ).
Now for A ∈V ′ we have (by 10.11), for suitable inﬁnite Y,
A ∈H(FV ′(Y ));

§11. Identities, Free Algebras, and Birkhoﬀ’s Theorem
83
hence
A ∈H(FV (Y )),
so A ∈V ; hence V ′ ⊆V, and thus V ′ = V.

Now we have all the background needed to prove the famous theorem of Birkhoﬀ.
Theorem 11.9 (Birkhoﬀ). K is an equational class iﬀK is a variety.
Proof. (⇒) Suppose
K = M(Σ).
Then
V (K) |= Σ
by 11.3; hence
V (K) ⊆M(Σ),
so
V (K) = K,
i.e., K is a variety.
(⇐) This follows from 11.8.

We can also use 11.4 to obtain a signiﬁcant strengthening of 10.12.
Corollary 11.10. Let K be a class of algebras of type F. If T(X) exists and K′ is any class
of algebras such that K ⊆K′ ⊆V (K), then
FK′(X) = FK(X).
In particular it follows that
FK′(X) ∈ISP(K).
Proof.
Since IdK(X) = IdV (K)(X) by 11.3, it follows that IdK(X) = IdK′(X). Thus
θK′(X) = θK(X), so FK′(X) = FK(X). The last statement of the corollary then follows
from 10.12.

So far we know that K-free algebras belong to ISP(K). The next result partially sharpens
this by showing that large K-free algebras are in IPS(K).
Theorem 11.11. Let K be a nonempty class of algebras of type F. Then for some cardinal
m, if |X| ≥m we have
FK(X) ∈IPS(K).

84
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
Proof. First choose a subset K∗of K such that for any X, IdK∗(X) = IdK(X). (One can
ﬁnd such a K∗by choosing an inﬁnite set of variables Y and then selecting, for each identity
p ≈q in Id(Y ) −IdK(Y ), an algebra A ∈K such that A ̸|= p ≈q.) Let m be any inﬁnite
upper bound of {|A| : A ∈K∗}. (Since K∗is a set such a cardinal m must exist.)
Next let ΨK∗(X), for any X, be {φ ∈Con T(X) : T(X)/φ ∈I(K∗)}. Then ΨK∗(X) ⊆
ΦK∗(X), hence T ΨK∗(X) ⊇θK∗(X). To prove equality of these two congruences for |X| ≥m
suppose ⟨p, q⟩̸∈θK∗(X). Then K∗̸|= p ≈q by 11.4; hence for some A ∈K∗, A ̸|= p ≈q.
If p = p(x1, . . . , xn), q = q(x1, . . . , xn), choose a1, . . . , an ∈A such that pA(a1, . . . , an) ̸=
qA(a1, . . . , an). As |X| ≥|A| we can ﬁnd a mapping α : X →A which is onto and αxi =
ai, 1 ≤i ≤n. Then α can be extended to a surjective homomorphism β : FK∗(X) →A,
and β(p) ̸= β(q). Thus ⟨p, q⟩̸∈ker β ∈ΨK∗(X), so ⟨p, q⟩̸∈T ΨK∗(X). Consequently
T ΨK∗(X) = θK∗(X). As FK(X) = FK∗(X) by 11.4, it follows that FK(X) = T(X)/ T ΨK∗(X).
Then (see §8 Exercise 11) we see that FK(X) ∈IPS(K∗) ⊆IPS(K).

Theorem 11.12. V = HPS.
Proof. As
PS ≤SP
we have
HPS ≤HSP = V.
Given a class K of algebras and suﬃciently large X, we have
FV (K)(X) ∈IPS(K)
by 11.11; hence
V (K) ⊆HPS(K)
by 10.11. Thus
V = HPS.

Mal’cev Conditions
One of the most fruitful directions of research was initiated by Mal’cev in the 1950’s when
he showed the connection between permutability of congruences for all algebras in a variety
V and the existence of a ternary term p such that V satisﬁes certain identities involving p.
The characterization of properties in varieties by the existence of certain terms involved in
certain identities we will refer to as Mal’cev conditions. This topic has been signiﬁcantly
advanced in recent years by Taylor.
Lemma 12.1. Let V be a variety of type F, and let
p(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn),
q(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn)
be terms such that in F = FV (X), where
X = {x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn},
we have
⟨pF(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn), qF(x1, . . ., xm, y1, . . . , yn)⟩∈Θ(y1, . . . , yn).
Then
V |= p(x1, . . ., xm, y, . . ., y) ≈q(x1, . . . , xm, y, . . ., y).
Proof. The homomorphism
α : FV (x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . ., yn) →FV (x1, . . . , xm, y)
deﬁned by
α(xi) = xi,
1 ≤i ≤m,
and
α(yi) = y,
1 ≤i ≤n,

is such that
Θ(y1, . . . , yn) ⊆ker α;
so
αp(x1, . . ., xm, y1, . . . , yn) = αq(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn);
thus
p(x1, . . ., xm, y, . . . , y) = q(x1, . . . , xm, y, . . ., y)
in FV (x1, . . . , xm, y), so by 11.4
V |= p(x1, . . ., xm, y, . . ., y) ≈q(x1, . . . , xm, y, . . ., y).

Theorem 12.2 (Mal’cev).
Let V be a variety of type F. The variety V is congruence-
permutable iﬀthere is a term p(x, y, z) such that
V |= p(x, x, y) ≈y
and
V |= p(x, y, y) ≈x.
Proof. (⇒) If V is congruence-permutable, then in FV (x, y, z) we have
⟨x, z⟩∈Θ(x, y) ◦Θ(y, z)
so
⟨x, z⟩∈Θ(y, z) ◦Θ(x, y).
Hence there is a p(x, y, z) ∈FV (x, y, z) such that
xΘ(y, z)p(x, y, z)Θ (x, y)z.
By 12.1
V |= p(x, y, y) ≈x
and
V |= p(x, x, z) ≈z.
(⇐) Let A ∈V and suppose φ, ψ ∈Con A. If
⟨a, b⟩∈φ ◦ψ,
say aφcψb, then
b = p(c, c, b)φp(a, c, b)ψp(a, b, b) = a,

§12. Mal’cev Conditions
87
so
⟨b, a⟩∈φ ◦ψ.
Thus by 5.9
φ ◦ψ = ψ ◦φ.

Examples. (1) Groups ⟨A, ·, −1, 1⟩are congruence-permutable, for let p(x, y, z) be x·y−1·z.
(2) Rings ⟨R, +, ·, −, 0⟩are congruence-permutable, for let p(x, y, z) be x −y + z.
(3) Quasigroups ⟨Q, /, ·, \⟩are congruence-permutable, for let p(x, y, z) be (x/(y\y)) ·
(y\z).
Theorem 12.3. Suppose V is a variety for which there is a ternary term M(x, y, z) such
that
V |= M(x, x, y) ≈M(x, y, x) ≈M(y, x, x) ≈x.
Then V is congruence-distributive.
Proof. Let φ, ψ, χ ∈Con A, where A ∈V. If
⟨a, b⟩∈φ ∧(ψ ∨χ)
then ⟨a, b⟩∈φ and there exist c1, . . . , cn such that
aψc1χc2 · · · ψcnχb.
But then as
M(a, ci, b)φM(a, ci, a) = a,
for each i, we have
a = M(a, a, b)(φ ∧ψ)M(a, c1, b)(φ ∧χ)M(a, c2, b) · · · M(a, cn, b)(φ ∧χ)M(a, b, b) = b,
so
⟨a, b⟩∈(φ ∧ψ) ∨(φ ∧χ).
This suﬃces to show
φ ∧(ψ ∨χ) = (φ ∧ψ) ∨(φ ∧χ),
so V is congruence-distributive.

Example. Lattices are congruence-distributive, for let
M(x, y, z) = (x ∨y) ∧(x ∨z) ∧(y ∨z).

Deﬁnition 12.4.
A variety V is arithmetical if it is both congruence-distributive and
congruence-permutable.
Theorem 12.5 (Pixley). A variety V is arithmetical iﬀit satisﬁes either of the equivalent
conditions
(a) There are terms p and M as in 12.2 and 12.3.
(b) There is a term m(x, y, z) such that
V |= m(x, y, x) ≈m(x, y, y) ≈m(y, y, x) ≈x.
Proof. If V is arithmetical then there is a term p as V is congruence-permutable. Let
FV (x, y, z) be the free algebra in V freely generated by {x, y, z}. Then as
⟨x, z⟩∈Θ(x, z) ∩[Θ(x, y) ∨Θ(y, z)]
it follows that
⟨x, z⟩∈[Θ(x, z) ∩Θ(x, y)] ∨[Θ(x, z) ∩Θ(y, z)];
hence
⟨x, z⟩∈[Θ(x, z) ∩Θ(x, y)] ◦[Θ(x, z) ∩Θ(y, z)].
Choose M(x, y, z) ∈FV (x, y, z) such that
x[Θ(x, z) ∩Θ(x, y)]M(x, y, z)[Θ(x, z) ∩Θ(y, z)]z.
Then by 12.1,
V |= M(x, x, y) ≈M(x, y, x) ≈M(y, x, x) ≈x.
If (a) holds then let m(x, y, z) be p(x, M(x, y, z), z). Finally if (b) holds let p(x, y, z) be
m(x, y, z) and let M(x, y, z) be m(x, m(x, y, z), z), and use 12.2 and 12.3.

Examples. (1) Boolean algebras are arithmetical, for let
m(x, y, z) = (x ∧z) ∨(x ∧y′ ∧z′) ∨(x′ ∧y′ ∧z).
(2) Heyting algebras are arithmetical, for let
m(x, y, z) = [(x →y) →z] ∧[(z →y) →x] ∧[x ∨z].
Note that 12.3 is not a Mal’cev condition as it is an implication rather than a character-
ization. J´onsson discovered a Mal’cev condition for congruence-distributive varieties which
we will make considerable use of in the last chapter.

§12. Mal’cev Conditions

Theorem 12.6 (J´onsson). A variety V is congruence-distributive iﬀthere is a ﬁnite n and
terms p0(x, y, z), . . . , pn(x, y, z) such that V satisﬁes
pi(x, y, x) ≈x
0 ≤i ≤n
p0(x, y, z) ≈x,
pn(x, y, z) ≈z
pi(x, x, y) ≈pi+1(x, x, y)
for i even
pi(x, y, y) ≈pi+1(x, y, y)
for i odd.
Proof. (⇒) Since
Θ(x, z) ∧[Θ(x, y) ∨Θ(y, z)] = [Θ(x, z) ∧Θ(x, y)] ∨[Θ(x, z) ∧Θ(y, z)]
in FV (x, y, z) we must have
⟨x, z⟩∈[Θ(x, z) ∧Θ(x, y)] ∨[Θ(x, z) ∧Θ(y, z)].
Thus for some p1(x, y, z), . . ., pn−1(x, y, z) ∈FV (x, y, z) we have
x[Θ(x, z) ∧Θ(x, y)]p1(x, y, z)
p1(x, y, z)[Θ(x, z) ∧Θ(y, z)]p2(x, y, z)
...
pn−1(x, y, z)[Θ(x, z) ∧Θ(y, z)]z,
and from these the desired equations fall out.
(⇐) For φ, ψ, χ ∈Con A, where A ∈V, we need to show
φ ∧(ψ ∨χ) ⊆(φ ∧ψ) ∨(φ ∧χ),
so let
⟨a, b⟩∈φ ∧(ψ ∨χ).
Then ⟨a, b⟩∈φ, and for some c1, . . . , ct we have
aψc1χ . . . ctχb.
From this follows, for 0 ≤i ≤n,
pi(a, a, b)ψpi(a, c1, b)χ . . . pi(a, ct, b)χpi(a, b, b);
hence
pi(a, a, b)(φ ∧ψ)pi(a, c1, b)(φ ∧χ) . . . pi(a, ct, b)(φ ∧χ)pi(a, b, b),

90
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
so
pi(a, a, b)[(φ ∧ψ) ∨(φ ∧χ)]pi(a, b, b),
0 ≤i ≤n. Then in view of the given equations, a[(φ ∧ψ) ∨(φ ∧χ)]b, so V is congruence-
distributive.

By looking at the proofs of 12.2 and 12.6 one easily has the following result.
Theorem 12.7. A variety V is congruence-permutable (respectively, congruence-distributive)
iﬀFV (x, y, z) has permutable (respectively, distributive) congruences.
For convenience in future discussions we introduce the following deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 12.8. A ternary term p satisfying the conditions in 12.2 for a variety V is called
a Mal’cev term for V, a ternary term M as described in 12.3 is a majority term for V, and a
ternary term m as described in 12.5 is called a 2
3-minority term for V.
The reader will ﬁnd Mal’cev conditions for congruence-modular varieties in Day [1] below.

The Center of an Algebra
Smith [6] introduced a generalization to any algebra in a congruence-permutable variety of
the commutator for groups. Hagemann and Herrmann [3] then showed that such commuta-
tors exist for any algebra in a congruence-modular variety. Using the commutator one can
deﬁne the center of such algebras. Another very simple deﬁnition of the center, valid for any
algebra, was given by Freese and McKenzie [1], and we will use it here.
Deﬁnition 13.1. Let A be an algebra of type F. The center of A is the binary relation
Z(A) deﬁned by:
⟨a, b⟩∈Z(A)
iﬀfor every p(x, y1, . . . , yn) ∈T(x, y1, . . ., yn) and for every c1, . . ., cn, d1, . . . , dn ∈A,
p(a, c1, . . . , cn) = p(a, d1, . . ., dn)
iﬀ
p(b, c1, . . . , cn) = p(b, d1, . . . , dn).
Theorem 13.2. For every algebra A, the center Z(A) is a congruence on A.
Proof. Certainly Z(A) is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive, hence Z(A) is an equivalence
relation on A. Next let f be an n-ary function symbol, and suppose ⟨ai, bi⟩∈Z(A), 1 ≤i ≤
n. Given a term p(x, y1, . . ., ym) and elements c1, . . . , cm, d1, . . . , dm of A, from the deﬁnition

92
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
of Z(A) we have
p(f(a1, a2, . . . , an),⃗c ) = p(f(a1, a2, . . . , an), ⃗d )
iﬀ
p(f(b1, a2, . . . , an),⃗c ) = p(f(b1, a2, . . ., an), ⃗d )
...
iﬀ
p(f(b1, . . . , bn−1, an),⃗c ) = p(f(b1, . . . , bn−1, an), ⃗d )
iﬀ
p(f(b1, . . . , bn),⃗c ) = p(f(b1, . . . , bn), ⃗d );
hence
p(f(⃗a),⃗c ) = p(f(⃗a), ⃗d )
iﬀ
p(f(⃗b),⃗c ) = p(f(⃗b), ⃗d ),
so
⟨f(a1, . . ., an), f(b1, . . . , bn)⟩∈Z(A).
Thus Z(A) is indeed a congruence.

Let us actually calculate the above deﬁned center of a group and of a ring.
Example.
Let G = ⟨G, ·, −1, 1⟩be a group.
If ⟨a, b⟩∈Z(G) then, with the term
p(x, y1, y2) = y1 · x · y2 and c ∈G, we have
p(a, a−1, c) = p(a, c, a−1);
hence
p(b, a−1, c) = p(b, c, a−1),
that is,
a−1 · b · c = c · b · a−1.
With c = 1 it follows that
a−1 · b = b · a−1;
hence for c ∈G,
a−1 · b · c = c · a−1 · b,
consequently ⟨a, b⟩is in the congruence associated with the normal subgroup N of G which
is the usual group-theoretic center of G, i.e., N = {g ∈G : h · g = g · h for h ∈G}.
Conversely, suppose N is the usual group-theoretic center of G. Then for any term
p(x, y1, . . . , yn) and elements a, b, c1, . . ., cn, d1, . . . , dn ∈G, if a · b−1 ∈N, and if
p(a,⃗c ) = p(a, ⃗d )
then
p((a · b−1) · b,⃗c ) = p((a · b−1) · b, ⃗d ),

§13. The Center of an Algebra
93
so
p(b,⃗c ) = p(b, ⃗d )
as a · b−1 is central. So, by symmetry, if a · b−1 ∈N then
p(a,⃗c ) = p(a, ⃗d )
iﬀ
p(b,⃗c ) = p(b, ⃗d ),
so ⟨a, b⟩∈Z(G).
Thus
Z(G) = {⟨a, b⟩∈G2 : (a · b−1) · c = c · (a · b−1) for c ∈G}.
Example. Let R = ⟨R, +, ·, −, 0⟩be a ring. If ⟨r, s⟩∈Z(R) then, for t ∈R,
(r −r) · t = (r −r) · 0;
hence replacing the underlined r by s we have
(r −s) · t = 0.
Likewise
t · (r −s) = 0,
so r −s ∈Ann(R), the annihilator of R. Conversely, if r −s ∈Ann(R) and p(x, y1, . . . , yn)
is a term and c1, . . . , cn, d1, . . . , dn ∈R then from
p(r,⃗c ) = p(r, ⃗d )
it follows that
p((r −s) + s,⃗c ) = p((r −s) + s, ⃗d ),
and thus
p(s,⃗c ) = p(s, ⃗d ).
By symmetry, we have
Z(R) = {⟨r, s⟩: r −s ∈Ann(R)}.
Now we return to the fundamental theorem of centrality, namely the characterization of
modules up to polynomial equivalence.
Deﬁnition 13.3. Let A be an algebra of type F. To F0 add symbols a for each a ∈A,
and call the new type FA, and let AA be the algebra of type FA which is just A with a
nullary operation corresponding to each element of A. The terms of type FA are called the
polynomials of A. We write pA for pAA. Two algebras A1 = ⟨A, F1⟩and A2 = ⟨A, F2⟩,
possibly of diﬀerent types, on the same universe are said to be polynomially equivalent if

94
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
they have the same set of polynomial functions, i.e., for each polynomial p(x1, . . . , xn) of A1
there is a polynomial q(x1, . . . , xn) of A2 such that pA1 = qA2, and conversely.
The following proof incorporates elegant arguments due to McKenzie and Taylor.
Theorem 13.4 (Gumm, Hagemann, Herrmann). Let A be an algebra such that V (A) is
congruence-permutable. Then the following are equivalent:
(a) A is polynomially equivalent to a left R-module, for some R.
(b) Z(A) = ∇A.
(c) {⟨a, a⟩: a ∈A} is a coset of a congruence on A × A.
Proof. (a) ⇒(b): If A is polynomially equivalent to a module M = ⟨M, +, −, 0, (fr)r∈R⟩,
then for every term p(x, y1, . . . , yn) of A there is a polynomial
q(x, y1, . . . , yn) = fr(x) + fr1(y1) + · · · + frn(yn) + m
of M such that
pA = qM.
Thus for a, b, c1, . . ., cn, d1, . . . , dn ∈A, if
p(a, c1, . . . , cn) = p(a, d1, . . . , dn)
then
q(a, c1, . . . , cn) = q(a, d1, . . . , dn);
hence if we subtract fr(a) from both sides,
fr1(c1) + · · · + frn(cn) + m = fr1(d1) + · · · + frn(dn) + m,
so if we add fr(b) to both sides,
q(b, c1, . . . , cn) = q(b, d1, . . . , dn);
consequently
p(b, c1, . . . , cn) = p(b, d1, . . ., dn).
By symmetry,
p(a,⃗c ) = p(a, ⃗d )
iﬀ
p(b,⃗c ) = p(b, ⃗d );
hence Z(A) = ∇A.
(b) ⇔(c): First note that X = {⟨a, a⟩: a ∈A} is a coset of some congruence on A × A
iﬀit is a coset of Θ(X), the smallest congruence on A × A obtained by identifying X. Now,
from §10 Exercise 7,
Θ({⟨a, a⟩: a ∈A}) = t∗(s({⟨pA×A(⟨a, a⟩, ⟨c1, d1⟩, . . ., ⟨cn, dn⟩),
pA×A(⟨b, b⟩, ⟨c1, d1⟩, . . ., ⟨cn, dn⟩)⟩: a, b, c1, . . ., cn, d1, . . . , dn ∈A

§13. The Center of an Algebra
95
and p is a term })) ∪∆A×A.
Hence X is a coset of Θ(X) iﬀfor every a, b, c1, . . . , cn, d1, . . . , dn ∈A and every term
p(x, y1, . . . , yn),
pA×A(⟨a, a⟩, ⟨c1, d1⟩, . . . , ⟨cn, dn⟩) ∈X
iﬀ
pA×A(⟨b, b⟩, ⟨c1, d1⟩, . . ., ⟨cn, dn⟩) ∈X,
that is,
pA(a,⃗c ) = pA(a, ⃗d )
iﬀ
pA(b,⃗c ) = pA(b, ⃗d ).
Thus X is a coset of Θ(X) iﬀZ(A) = ∇A.
(b) ⇒(a): Given that Z(A) = ∇A, let p(x, y, z) be a Mal’cev term for V (A). Choose
any element 0 of A and deﬁne, for a, b ∈A,
a + b = p(a, 0, b)
−a = p(0, a, 0).
Then
a + 0 = p(a, 0, 0)
= a.
Next observe that for a, b, c, d, e ∈A,
p(p(a, a, a), d, p(b, e, e)) = p(p(a, d, b), e, p(c, c, e));
hence, as ⟨e, c⟩∈Z(A), we can replace the underlined e by c to obtain
p(p(a, a, a), d, p(b, e, c)) = p(p(a, d, b), e, p(c, c, c)),
so
p(a, d, p(b, e, c)) = p(p(a, d, b), e, c).
Setting d = e = 0, we have the associative law
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c.
Next,
a + (−a) = p(a, 0, p(0, a, 0))
= p(p(a, 0, 0), a, 0)
= p(a, a, 0)
= 0.

96
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
By
p(a, b, b) = p(b, b, a)
and the fact that ⟨0, b⟩∈Z(A), we can replace the underlined b by 0 to obtain
p(a, 0, b) = p(b, 0, a);
hence
a + b = b + a,
so ⟨A, +, −, 0⟩is an Abelian group.
Next we show that each n-ary term function pA(x1, . . . , xn) of A is aﬃne for ⟨A, +, −, 0⟩,
i.e., it is a homomorphism from ⟨A, +, −, 0⟩n to ⟨A, +, −, 0⟩plus a constant. Let a1, . . ., an,
b1, . . . , bn ∈A. Then
p(a1 + 0, . . . , an + 0) + p(0, . . ., 0) = p(0 + 0, . . ., 0 + 0) + p(a1, . . . , an).
As ⟨0, b1⟩∈Z(A) we can replace the underlined 0’s by b1 to obtain
p(a1 + b1, a2 + 0, . . . , an + 0) + p(0, . . ., 0) = p(0 + b1, 0 + 0, . . . , 0 + 0) + p(a1, . . . , an).
Continuing in this fashion, we obtain
p(a1 + b1, . . . , an + bn) + p(0, . . ., 0) = p(b1, . . . , bn) + p(a1, . . . , an)
= p(a1, . . ., an) + p(b1, . . . , bn).
Thus pA(x1, . . . , xn) −pA(0, . . . , 0) is a group homomorphism from ⟨A, +, −, 0⟩n to ⟨A, +, −, 0⟩.
To construct the desired module, let R be the set of unary functions pA(x, c1, . . . , cn) on
A obtained by choosing terms p(x, y1, . . . , yn) and elements c1, . . . , cn ∈A such that
p(0, c1, . . . , cn) = 0.
For such unary functions we have
p(a + b, c1, . . . , cn) = p(a, c1, . . . , cn) + p(b, 0, . . ., 0) −p(0, . . ., 0)
and
p(b, c1, . . . , cn) = p(b, 0, . . ., 0) + p(0, c1, . . ., cn) −p(0, . . ., 0)
= p(b, 0, . . ., 0) −p(0, . . . , 0);
hence
p(a + b, c1 . . . , cn) = p(a, c1, . . . , cn) + p(b, c1, . . . , cn).
(∗)
Thus each member of R is an endomorphism of ⟨A, +, −, 0⟩.

§13. The Center of an Algebra
97
Clearly R is closed under composition ◦, and for r, s ∈R deﬁne r + s and −r by
(r + s)(a) = r(a) + s(a) = p(r(a), 0, s(a))
(−r)(a) = −r(a) = p(0, r(a), 0).
Then r + s, −r ∈R. Let ˆ0 be the constant function on A with value 0, and let ˆ1 be the
identity function on A. Then ˆ0, ˆ1 ∈R as well. We claim that R = ⟨R, +, ·, −, ˆ0, ˆ1⟩is a
ring. Certainly ⟨R, +, −, 0⟩is an Abelian group as the operations are deﬁned pointwise in
the Abelian group ⟨A, +, −, 0⟩, and ⟨R, ·, 1⟩is a monoid. Thus we only need to look at the
distributive laws. If we are given r, s, t ∈R, then
[(r + s) ◦t](a) = (r + s)(t(a))
= r(t(a)) + s(t(a))
= (r ◦t)(a) + (s ◦t)(a)
= (r ◦t + s ◦t)(a);
hence
(r + s) ◦t = r ◦t + s ◦t.
Also
[r ◦(s + t)](a) = r((s + t)(a))
= r(s(a) + t(a))
= r(s(a)) + r(t(a))
(by (∗) above)
= (r ◦s)(a) + (r ◦t)(a)
= (r ◦s + r ◦t)(a);
hence
r ◦(s + t) = (r ◦s) + (r ◦t).
This shows R is a ring.
Now to show that M = ⟨A, +, −, 0, (r)r∈R⟩is a left R-module, we only need to check the
laws concerning scalar multiplication. So let r, s ∈R, a, b ∈A. Then
(r + s)(a) = r(a) + s(a)
(by deﬁnition)
r(a + b) = r(a) + r(b)
by (∗))
(r ◦s)(a) = r(s(a)).
Thus M is a left R-module (indeed a unitary left R-module).
The fundamental operations of M are certainly expressible by polynomial functions of A.
Conversely any n-ary fundamental operation f A(x1, . . . , xn) of A satisﬁes, for a1, . . . , an ∈A,
f(a1, . . . , an) −f(0, . . ., 0) = (f(a1, 0, . . ., 0) −f(0, . . . , 0))
+ · · · + (f(0, . . . , an) −f(0, . . ., 0)).

98
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
As
r1 = f A(x, 0, . . . , 0) −f A(0, . . . , 0) ∈R
...
rn = f A(0, . . . , 0, x) −f A(0, . . . , 0) ∈R
it follows that
f A(x1, . . ., xn) = r1(x1) + · · · + rn(xn) + f(0, . . ., 0);
hence each fundamental operation of A is a polynomial of M. This suﬃces to show that A
and M are polynomially equivalent.

Actually one only needs to assume V (A) is a congruence-modular in Theorem 13.4 (see
(4) or (7) below).

6. (Freese and McKenzie). Let V be a congruence permutable variety such that Z(A) =
∇A for every A ∈V. Let p(x, y, z) be a Mal’cev term for V. Deﬁne R by
R = {r(x, y) ∈FV (x, y) : r(x, x) = x}.
(Note that if r(x, y) = s(x, y), then r(x, x) = x iﬀs(x, x) = x.) Deﬁne the operations
+, ·, −, 0, 1 on R by
r(x, y) + s(x, y) = p(r(x, y), y, s(x, y))
r(x, y) · s(x, y) = r(s(x, y), y)
−r(x, y) = p(y, r(x, y), y)
0 = y
1 = x.
Verify that R = ⟨R, +, ·, −, 0, 1⟩is a ring with unity. Next, given an algebra A ∈V
and n ∈A, deﬁne the operations +, −, 0, (fr)r∈R on A by
a + b = p(a, n, b)
−a = p(n, a, n)
0 = n
fr(a) = r(a, n).
Now verify that ⟨A, +, −, 0, (fr)r∈R⟩is a unitary R-module, and it is polynomially
equivalent to A.

Equational Logic and Fully Invariant Congruences
In this section we explore the connections between the identities satisﬁed by classes of alge-
bras and fully invariant congruences on the term algebra. Using this, we can give a complete
set of rules for making deductions of identities from identities. Finally, we show that the
possible ﬁnite sizes of minimal deﬁning sets of identities of a variety form a convex set.
Deﬁnition 14.1. A congruence θ on an algebra A is fully invariant if for every endomor-
phism α on A,
⟨a, b⟩∈θ ⇒⟨αa, αb⟩∈θ.
Let ConFI(A) denote the set of fully invariant congruences on A.
Lemma 14.2. ConFI(A) is closed under arbitrary intersection.

II The Elements of Universal Algebra
Proof. (Exercise.)

Deﬁnition 14.3. Given an algebra A and S ⊆A × A let ΘFI(S) denote the least fully
invariant congruence on A containing S. The congruence ΘFI(S) is called the fully invariant
congruence generated by S.
Lemma 14.4. If we are given an algebra A of type F then ΘFI is an algebraic closure
operator on A × A. Indeed, ΘFI is 2-ary.
Proof. First construct A × A, and then to the fundamental operations of A × A add the
following:
⟨a, a⟩
for a ∈A
s(⟨a, b⟩) = ⟨b, a⟩
t(⟨a, b⟩, ⟨c, d⟩) =
(
⟨a, d⟩
⟨a, b⟩
if b = c
otherwise
eσ(⟨a, b⟩) = ⟨σa, σb⟩
for σ an endomorphism of A.
Then it is not diﬃcult to verify that θ is a fully invariant congruence on A iﬀθ is a subuniverse
of the new algebra we have just constructed. Thus ΘFI is an algebraic closure operator.
To see that ΘFI is 2-ary let us deﬁne a new algebra A∗by replacing each n-ary funda-
mental operation f of A by the set of all unary operations of the form
f(a1, . . . , ai−1, x, ai+1, . . ., an)
where a1, . . . , ai−1, ai+1, . . . , an are elements of A.
Claim. Con A = Con A∗.
Clearly θ ∈Con A ⇒θ ∈Con A∗. For the converse suppose that θ ∈Con A∗and
f ∈Fn. Then for
⟨ai, bi⟩∈θ,
1 ≤i ≤n,
we have
⟨f(a1, . . . , an−1, an), f(a1, . . . , an−1, bn)⟩∈θ
⟨f(a1, . . . , an−1, bn), f(a1, . . . , bn−1, bn)⟩∈θ
...
⟨f(a1, b2, . . . , b2), f(b1, . . ., bn)⟩∈θ;
hence
⟨f(a1, . . . , an), f(b1, . . ., bn)⟩∈θ.

§14. Equational Logic and Fully Invariant Congruences
101
Thus
θ ∈Con A.
If now we go back to the beginning of the proof and use A∗instead of A, but keep the eσ’s
the same, it follows that ΘFI is the closure operator Sg of an algebra all of whose operations
are of arity at most 2. Then by 4.2, ΘFI is a 2-ary closure operator.

Deﬁnition 14.5. Given a set of variables X and a type F, let
τ : Id(X) →T(X) × T(X)
be the bijection deﬁned by
τ(p ≈q) = ⟨p, q⟩.
Lemma 14.6. For K a class of algebras of type F and X a set of variables, τ(IdK(X)) is
a fully invariant congruence on T(X).
Proof. As
p ≈p ∈IdK(x)
for p ∈T(X)
p ≈q ∈IdK(X) ⇒q ≈p ∈IdK(X)
p ≈q, q ≈r ∈IdK(X) ⇒p ≈r ∈IdK(X)
it follows that τ(IdK(X)) is an equivalence relation on T(X). Now if
pi ≈qi ∈IdK(X)
for 1 ≤i ≤n
and if f ∈Fn then it is easily seen that
f(p1, . . . , pn) ≈f(q1, . . . , qn) ∈IdK(X),
so τ(IdK(X)) is a congruence relation on T(X). Next, if α is an endomorphism of T(X) and
p(x1, . . . , xn) ≈q(x1, . . . , xn) ∈IdK(X)
then it is again direct to verify that
p(αx1, . . . , αxn) ≈q(αx1, . . . , αxn) ∈IdK(X);
hence τ(IdK(X)) is fully invariant.

Lemma 14.7. Given a set of variables X and a fully invariant congruence θ on T(X) we
have, for p ≈q ∈Id(X),
T(X)/θ |= p ≈q ⇔⟨p, q⟩∈θ.

102
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
Thus T(X)/θ is free in V (T(X)/θ).
Proof. (⇒) If
p = p(x1, . . ., xn),
q = q(x1, . . ., xn)
then
T(X)/θ |= p(x1, . . . , xn) ≈q(x1, . . . , xn)
⇒p(x1/θ, . . . , xn/θ) = q(x1/θ, . . ., xn/θ)
⇒p(x1, . . . , xn)/θ = q(x1, . . ., xn)/θ
⇒⟨p(x1, . . ., xn), q(x1, . . . , xn)⟩∈θ
⇒⟨p, q⟩∈θ.
(⇐) Given r1, . . . , rn ∈T(X) we can ﬁnd an endomorphism ε of T(X) with
ε(xi) = ri,
1 ≤i ≤n;
hence
⟨p(x1, . . . , xn), q(x1, . . . , xn)⟩∈θ
⇒⟨εp(x1, . . ., xn), εq(x1, . . . , xn)⟩∈θ
⇒⟨p(r1, . . . , rn), q(r1, . . ., rn)⟩∈θ
⇒p(r1/θ, . . ., rn/θ) = q(r1/θ, . . . , rn/θ).
Thus
T(X)/θ |= p ≈q.
For the last claim, given p ≈q ∈Id(X),
⟨p, q⟩∈θ ⇔T(X)/θ |= p ≈q
⇔V (T(X)/θ) |= p ≈q
(by 11.3),
so T(X)/θ is free in V (T(X)/θ) by 11.4.

Theorem 14.8. Given a subset Σ of Id(X), one can ﬁnd a K such that
Σ = IdK(X)
iﬀτ(Σ) is a fully invariant congruence on T(X).
Proof. (⇒) This was proved in 14.6.

§14. Equational Logic and Fully Invariant Congruences
103
(⇐) Suppose τ(Σ) is a fully invariant congruence θ. Let K = {T(X)/θ}. Then by 14.7
K |= p ≈q ⇔⟨p, q⟩∈θ
⇔p ≈q ∈Σ.
Thus Σ = IdK(X).

Deﬁnition 14.9. A subset Σ of Id(X) is called an equational theory over X if there is a
class of algebras K such that
Σ = IdK(X).
Corollary 14.10. The equational theories (of type F) over X form an algebraic lattice which
is isomorphic to the lattice of fully invariant congruences on T(X).
Proof. This follows from 14.4 and 14.8.

Deﬁnition 14.11. Let X be a set of variables and Σ a set of identities of type F with
variables from X. For p, q ∈T(X) we say
Σ |= p ≈q
(read: “Σ yields p ≈q”) if, given any algebra A,
A |= Σ
implies
A |= p ≈q.
Theorem 14.12. If Σ is a set of identities over X and p ≈q is an identity over X, then
Σ |= p ≈q ⇔⟨p, q⟩∈ΘFI(τΣ).
Proof. Suppose
A |= Σ.
Then as τ(IdA(X)) is a fully invariant congruence on T(X) by 14.6, we have
ΘFI(τΣ) ⊆τIdA(X);
hence
⟨p, q⟩∈ΘFI(τΣ) ⇒A |= p ≈q,
so
⟨p, q⟩∈ΘFI(τΣ) ⇒Σ |= p ≈q.
Conversely, by 14.7
T(X)/ΘFI(τΣ) |= Σ,

104
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
so if
Σ |= p ≈q
then
T(X)/ΘFI(τΣ) |= p ≈q;
hence by 14.7,
⟨p, q⟩∈ΘFI(τΣ).

In the proof of 14.4 we gave an explicit description of the operations needed to construct
the fully invariant closure ΘFI(S) of a set of ordered pairs S from an algebra. This will lead
to an elegant set of axioms and rules of inference for working with identities.
Deﬁnition 14.13. Given a term p, the subterms of p are deﬁned by:
(1) The term p is a subterm of p.
(2) If f(p1, . . . , pn) is a subterm of p and f ∈Fn then each pi is a subterm of p.
Deﬁnition 14.14. A set of identities Σ over X is closed under replacement if given any
p ≈q ∈Σ and any term r ∈T(X), if p occurs as a subterm of r, then letting s be the result
of replacing that occurrence of p by q, we have r ≈s ∈Σ.
Deﬁnition 14.15. A set of identities Σ over X is closed under substitution if for each p ≈q
in Σ and for ri ∈T(X), if we simultaneously replace every occurrence of each variable xi in
p ≈q by ri, then the resulting identity is in Σ.
Deﬁnition 14.16. If Σ is a set of identities over X, then the deductive closure D(Σ) of Σ
is the smallest subset of Id(X) containing Σ such that
p ≈p ∈D(Σ) for p ∈T(X)
p ≈q ∈D(Σ) ⇒q ≈p ∈D(Σ)
p ≈q, q ≈r ∈D(Σ) ⇒p ≈r ∈D(Σ)
D(Σ) is closed under replacement
D(Σ) is closed under substitution.
Theorem 14.17. Given Σ ⊆Id(X), p ≈q ∈Id(X),
Σ |= p ≈q ⇔p ≈q ∈D(Σ).
Proof. The ﬁrst three closure properties make τD(Σ) into an equivalence relation contain-
ing τΣ, the fourth makes it a congruence, and the last closure property says τD(Σ) is a fully
invariant congruence. Thus
τD(Σ) ⊇ΘFI(τΣ).

§14. Equational Logic and Fully Invariant Congruences
105
However τ −1ΘFI(τΣ) has all ﬁve closure properties and contains Σ; hence
τD(Σ) = ΘFI(τΣ).
Thus
Σ |= p ≈q ⇔⟨p, q⟩∈ΘFI(τΣ)
(by 14.12)
⇔p ≈q ∈D(Σ).

Thus we see that using only the most obvious rules for working with identities we can
derive all possible consequences. From this we can set up the following equational logic.
Deﬁnition 14.18. Let Σ be a set of identities over X. For p ≈q ∈Id(X) we say
Σ ⊢p ≈q
(read “Σ proves p ≈q”) if there is a sequence of identities
p1 ≈q1, . . . , pn ≈qn
from Id(X) such that each pi ≈qi belongs to Σ, or is of the form p ≈p, or is a result of
applying any of the last four closure rules of 14.16 to previous identities in the sequence,
and the last identity pn ≈qn is p ≈q. The sequence p1 ≈q1, . . . , pn ≈qn is called a formal
deduction of p ≈q, and n is the length of the deduction.
Theorem 14.19 (Birkhoﬀ: The Completeness Theorem for Equational Logic). Given Σ ⊆
Id(X) and p ≈q ∈Id(X) we have
Σ |= p ≈q ⇔Σ ⊢p ≈q.
Proof. Certainly
Σ ⊢p ≈q ⇒p ≈q ∈D(Σ)
as we have used only properties under which D(Σ) is closed in the construction of a formal
deduction p1 ≈q1, . . . , pn ≈qn of p ≈q.
For the converse of this, ﬁrst it is obvious that
Σ ⊢p ≈q
for
p ≈q ∈Σ
and
Σ ⊢p ≈p
for
p ∈T(X).

106
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
If
Σ ⊢p ≈q
then there is a formal deduction
p1 ≈q1, . . . , pn ≈qn
of p ≈q. But then
p1 ≈q1, . . . , pn ≈qn,
qn ≈pn
is a formal deduction of q ≈p.
If
Σ ⊢p ≈q,
Σ ⊢q ≈r
let
p1 ≈q1, . . . , pn ≈qn
be a formal deduction of p ≈q and let
p1 ≈q1, . . . , pk ≈qk
be a formal deduction of q ≈r.
Then
p1 ≈q1, . . . , pn ≈qn,
p1 ≈q1, . . . , pk ≈qk,
pn ≈qk
is a formal deduction of p ≈r.
If
Σ ⊢p ≈q
let
p1 ≈q1, . . . , pn ≈qn
be a formal deduction of p ≈q. Let
r(. . . , p, . . . )
denote a term with a speciﬁc occurrence of the subterm p. Then
p1 ≈q1, . . . , pn ≈qn,
r(. . . , pn, . . . ) ≈r(. . . , qn, . . . )
is a formal deduction of
r(. . . , p, . . .) ≈r(. . . , q, . . .).
Finally, if
Σ ⊢pi ≈qi,
1 ≤i ≤n,

§14. Equational Logic and Fully Invariant Congruences
107
and f ∈Fn then by writing the formal deductions of each pi ≈qi in succession and adding
replacement steps to obtain the identity f(p1, . . . , pn) ≈f(q1, . . . , qn) at the end we have a
formal deduction of the latter, viz.,
. . . , p1 ≈q1, . . ., p2 ≈q2, . . . , . . . , pn ≈qn, f(p1, . . . , pn) ≈f(p1 . . . , pn−1, qn), . . . .
Thus
D(Σ) ⊆{p ≈q : Σ ⊢p ≈q};
hence
D(Σ) = {p ≈q : Σ ⊢p ≈q},
so by 14.17
Σ |= p ≈q ⇔Σ ⊢p ≈q.

The completeness theorem gives us a two-edged sword for tackling the study of conse-
quences of identities. When using the notion of satisfaction, we look at all the algebras
satisfying a given set of identities, whereas when working with ⊢we can use induction argu-
ments on the length of a formal deduction.
Examples. (1) An identity p ≈q is balanced if each variable occurs the same number of
times in p as in q. If Σ is a balanced set of identities then using induction on the length of a
formal deduction we can show that if Σ ⊢p ≈q then p ≈q is balanced. [This is not at all
evident if one works with the notion |= .]
(2) A famous theorem of Jacobson in ring theory says that if we are given n ≥2, if Σ
is the set of ring axioms plus xn ≈x, then Σ |= x · y ≈y · x. However there is no known
routine way of writing out a formal deduction, given n, of x · y ≈y · x. (For special n, such
as n = 2, 3, this is a popular exercise.)
Another application of fully invariant congruences in the study of identities is to show
the existence of minimal subvarieties.
Deﬁnition 14.20. A variety V is trivial if all algebras in V are trivial. A subclass W of a
variety V which is also a variety is called a subvariety of V. V is a minimal (or equationally
complete) variety if V is not trivial but the only subvariety of V not equal to V is the trivial
variety.
Theorem 14.21. Let V be a nontrivial variety. Then V contains a minimal subvariety.
Proof. Let V = M(Σ), Σ ⊆Id(X) with X inﬁnite (see 11.8). Then IdV (X) deﬁnes V,
and as V is nontrivial it follows from 14.6 that τ(IdV (X)) is a fully invariant congruence on
T(X) which is not ∇. As
∇= ΘFI(⟨x, y⟩)

108
II The Elements of Universal Algebra
for any x, y ∈X with x ̸= y, it follows that ∇is ﬁnitely generated (as a fully invariant
congruence). This allows us to use Zorn’s lemma to extend τ(IdV (X)) to a maximal fully
invariant congruence on T(X), say θ. Then in view of 14.8, τ −1θ must deﬁne a minimal
variety which is a subvariety of V.

Example. The variety of lattices has a unique minimal subvariety, the variety generated
by a two-element chain. To see this let V be a minimal subvariety of the variety of lattices.
Let L be a nontrivial lattice in V. As L contains a two-element sublattice, we can assume L
is a two-element lattice. Now V (L) is not trivial, and V (L) ⊆V, hence V (L) = V. [We shall
see in IV§8 Exercise 2 that V is a variety of all distributive lattices.]
We close this section with a look at an application of Tarski’s irredundant basis theorem
to sizes of minimal deﬁning sets of identities.
Deﬁnition 14.22. Given a variety V and a set of variables X let
IrB(IdV (X)) = {|Σ| : Σ is a minimal ﬁnite set of identities over X deﬁning V }.
Theorem 14.23 (Tarski). Given a variety V and a set of variables X, IrB(IdV (X)) is a
convex set.
Proof. For Σ ⊆IdV (X), Σ |= IdV (X) implies
ΘFI(τΣ) = τIdV (X).
As ΘFI is 2-ary by 14.4, from 4.4 we have the result.

Now that we have covered the most basic aspects of universal algebra, let us take a brief look
at how universal algebra relates to two other popular areas of mathematics. First we discuss
two topics from combinatorics which can conveniently be regarded as algebraic systems,
namely Steiner triple systems and mutually orthogonal Latin squares. In particular we will
show how to refute Euler’s conjecture. Then we treat ﬁnite state acceptors as partial unary
algebras and look at the languages they accept—this will include the famous Kleene theorem
on regular languages.
§1.
Steiner Triple Systems, Squags, and Sloops
Deﬁnition 1.1. A Steiner triple system on a set A is a family S of three-element subsets of
A such that each pair of distinct elements from A is contained in exactly one member of S.
|A| is called the order of the Steiner triple system.
If |A| = 1 then S = ∅, and if |A| = 3 then S = {A}. Of course there are no Steiner triple
systems on A if |A| = 2. The following result gives some constraints on |A| and |S|. (Actually
they are the best possible, but we will not prove this fact.)
Theorem 1.2. If S is a Steiner triple system on a ﬁnite set A, then
(a) |S| = |A| · (|A| −1)/6
(b) |A| ≡1 or 3(mod 6).
Proof. For (a) note that each member of S contains three distinct pairs of elements of A,
and as each pair of elements appears in only one member of S, it follows that the number of
pairs of elements from A is exactly 3|S|, i.e.,
|A|
2

= 3|S|.

III Selected Topics
To show that (b) holds, ﬁx a ∈A and let T1, . . . , Tk be the members of S to which
a belongs. Then the doubletons T1 −{a}, . . . , Tk −{a} are mutually disjoint as no pair of
elements of A is contained in two distinct triples of S; and A−{a} = (T1−{a})∪· · ·∪(Tk−{a})
as each member of A −{a} is in some triple along with the element a. Thus 2
|A| −1, so
|A| ≡1 (mod 2). From (a) we see that |A| ≡0 or 1 (mod 3); hence we have |A| ≡1 or
3 (mod 6).

Thus after |A| = 3 the next possible size |A| is 7. Figure 20 shows a Steiner triple system
of order 7, where we require that three numbers be in a triple iﬀthey lie on one of the lines
drawn or on the circle. The reader will quickly convince himself that this is the only Steiner
triple system of order 7 (up to a relabelling of the elements).

Are there some easy ways to construct new Steiner triple systems from old ones? If we
convert to an algebraic system it will become evident that our standard constructions in
universal algebra apply. A natural way of introducing a binary operation on A is to require
a · b = c
if {a, b, c} ∈S.
(∗)
Unfortunately this leaves a · a undeﬁned. We conveniently get around this by deﬁning
a · a = a.
(∗∗)
Although the associative law for · fails already in the system of order 3, nonetheless we have
the identities

§1. Steiner Triple Systems, Squags, and Sloops
113
(Sq1) x · x ≈x
(Sq2) x · y ≈y · x
(Sq3) x · (x · y) ≈y.
Deﬁnition 1.3. A groupoid satisfying the identities (Sq1)–(Sq3) above is called a squag (or
Steiner quasigroup).
Now we will show that the variety of squags precisely captures the Steiner triple systems.
Theorem 1.4. If ⟨A, ·⟩is a squag deﬁne S to be the set of three-element subsets {a, b, c}
of A such that the product of any two elements gives the third. Then S is a Steiner triple
system on A.
Proof. Suppose a · b = c holds. Then
a · (a · b) = a · c,
so by (Sq3)
b = a · c.
Continuing, we see that the product of any two of a, b, c gives the third. Thus in view of
(Sq1), if any two are equal, all three are equal. Consequently for any two distinct elements
of A there is a unique third element (distinct from the two) such that the product of any
two gives the third. Thus S is indeed a Steiner triple system on A.

Another approach to converting a Steiner triple system S on A to an algebra is to adjoin
a new element, called 1, and replace (∗∗) by
a · a = 1
(∗∗′)
a · 1 = 1 · a = a.
(∗∗′′)
This leads to a groupoid with identity ⟨A ∪{1}, ·, 1⟩satisfying the identities
(Sl1) x · x ≈1
(Sl2) x · y ≈y · x
(Sl3) x · (x · y) ≈y.
Deﬁnition 1.5. A groupoid with a distinguished element ⟨A, ·, 1⟩is called a sloop (or Steiner
loop) if the identities (Sl1)–(Sl3) hold.
Theorem 1.6. If ⟨A, ·, 1⟩is a sloop and |A| ≥2, deﬁne S to be the three-element subsets
of A −{1} such that the product of any two distinct elements gives the third. Then S is a
Steiner triple system on A −{1}.
Proof. (Similar to 1.4.)

Quasigroups, Loops, and Latin Squares
A quasigroup is usually deﬁned to be a groupoid ⟨A, ·⟩such that for any elements a, b ∈A
there are unique elements c, d satisfying
a · c = b
d · a = b.
The deﬁnition of quasigroups we adopted in II§1 has two extra binary operations \ and /,
left division and right division respectively, which allow us to consider quasigroups as an
equational class. Recall that the axioms for quasigroups ⟨A, /, ·, \⟩are given by
x\(x · y) ≈y
(x · y)/y ≈x
x · (x\y) ≈y
(x/y) · y ≈x.
To convert a quasigroup ⟨A, ·⟩in the usual deﬁnition to one in our deﬁnition let a/b be
the unique solution c of c · b = a, and let a\b be the unique solution d of a · d = b. The four
equations above are then easily veriﬁed. Conversely, given a quasigroup ⟨A, /, ·, \⟩by our
deﬁnition and a, b ∈A, suppose c is such that a · c = b. Then a\(a · c) = a\b; hence c = a\b,
so only one such c is possible. However, a · (a\b) = b, so there is one such c. Similarly, we
can show that there is exactly one d such that d · a = b, namely d = b/a. Thus the two
deﬁnitions of quasigroups are, in an obvious manner, equivalent.
A loop is usually deﬁned to be a quasigroup with an identity element ⟨A, ·, 1⟩. In our
deﬁnition we have an algebra ⟨A, /, ·, \, 1⟩; and such loops form an equational class.
Returning to a Steiner triple system S on A we see that the associated squag ⟨A, ·⟩is
indeed a quasigroup, for if a · c = b then a · (a · c) = a · b, so c = a · b, and furthermore
a · (a · b) = b; hence if we are given a, b there is a unique c such that a · c = b. Similarly,
there is a unique d such that d · a = b. In the case of squags we do not need to introduce the
additional operations / and \ to obtain an equational class, for in this case / and \ are the
same as ·. Squags are sometimes called idempotent totally symmetric quasigroups.
Given any ﬁnite groupoid ⟨A, ·⟩we can write out the multiplication table of ⟨A, ·⟩in a
square array, giving the Cayley table of ⟨A, ·⟩(see Figure 21). If we are given the Cayley
table for a ﬁnite groupoid ⟨A, ·⟩, it is quite easy to check whether or not ⟨A, ·⟩is actually a
quasigroup.

Theorem 2.1. A ﬁnite groupoid A is a quasigroup iﬀevery element of A appears exactly
once in each row and in each column of the Cayley table of ⟨A, ·⟩.
Proof. If we are given a, b ∈A, then there is exactly one c satisfying a · c = b iﬀb occurs
exactly once in the ath row of the Cayley table of ⟨A, ·⟩; and there is exactly one d such that
d · a = b iﬀb occurs exactly once in the ath column of the Cayley table.

Deﬁnition 2.2. A Latin square of order n is an n × n matrix (aij) of elements from an n
element set A such that each member of A occurs exactly once in each row and each column
of the matrix. (See Figure 22 for a Latin square of order 4.)

Orthogonal Latin Squares
Deﬁnition 3.1. If (aij) and (bij) are two Latin squares of order n with entries from A
with the property that for each ⟨a, b⟩∈A × A there is exactly one index ij such that
⟨a, b⟩= ⟨aij, bij⟩, then we say that (aij) and (bij) are orthogonal Latin squares.
Figure 23 shows an example of orthogonal Latin squares of order 3. In the late 1700’s
Euler was asked if there were orthogonal Latin squares of order 6. Euler conjectured: if
n ≡2 (mod 4) then there do not exist orthogonal Latin squares of order n. However he was
unable to prove even a single case of this conjecture for n > 2. In 1900 Tarry veriﬁed the
conjecture for n = 6 (this is perhaps surprising if one considers that there are more than
800 million Latin squares on a set of six elements). Later Macneish gave a construction
of orthogonal Latin squares of all orders n where n ̸≡2 (mod 4). Then in 1959–60, Bose,
Parker, and Shrikhande showed that n = 2, 6 are the only values for which Euler’s conjecture

is actually true! Following the elegant presentation of Evans we will show, by converting
orthogonal Latin squares into algebras, how to construct a pair of orthogonal Latin squares
of order 54, giving a counterexample to Euler’s conjecture.

In view of §2, two orthogonal Latin squares on a set A correspond to two quasigroups
⟨A, /, ·, \⟩and ⟨A, ◦/, ◦, ◦\⟩such that the map ⟨a, b⟩7→⟨a · b, a ◦b⟩is a permutation of A × A.
For a ﬁnite set A this will be a bijection iﬀthere exist functions ∗l and ∗r from A × A to A
such that
∗l(a · b, a ◦b) = a
∗r(a · b, a ◦b) = b.
Thus we are led to the following algebraic structures.
Deﬁnition 3.2 (Evans). A pair of orthogonal Latin squares is an algebra
⟨A, /, ·, \, ◦/, ◦, ◦\, ∗l, ∗r⟩
with eight binary operations such that
(i) ⟨A, /, ·, \⟩is a quasigroup
(ii) ⟨A, ◦/, ◦, ◦\⟩is a quasigroup
(iii) ∗l(x · y, x ◦y) ≈x
(iv) ∗r(x · y, x ◦y) ≈y.
The order of such an algebra is the cardinality of its universe. Let POLS be the variety of
pairs of orthogonal Latin squares.
Now let us show how to construct a pair of orthogonal Latin squares of order n for any
n which is not congruent to 2 (mod 4).
Lemma 3.3. If q is a prime power and q ≥3, then there is a member of POLS of order q.
Proof.
Let ⟨K, +, ·⟩be a ﬁnite ﬁeld of order q, and let e1, e2 be two distinct nonzero
elements of K. Then deﬁne two binary operations
1 and
2 on K by
aib = ei · a + b.

§3. Orthogonal Latin Squares
117
Note that the two groupoids ⟨K,
1⟩and ⟨K,
2⟩are actually quasigroups, for aic = b
holds iﬀc = b −ei · a, and dia = b holds iﬀd = e−1
i
· (b −a). Also we have that
⟨a1b, a2b⟩= ⟨c1d, c2d⟩
implies
e1 · a + b = e1 · c + d
e2 · a + b = e2 · c + d;
hence
e1 · (a −c) = d −b
e2 · (a −c) = d −b
and thus, as e1 ̸= e2,
a = c
and
b = d.
Thus the Cayley tables of ⟨K,
1⟩and ⟨K,
2⟩give rise to orthogonal Latin squares of order
q.

Theorem 3.4. If n ≡0, 1, or 3 (mod 4), then there is a pair of orthogonal Latin squares of
order n.
Proof. Note that n ≡0, 1 or 3 (mod 4) iﬀn = 2αpα1
1 · · · pαk
k
with α ̸= 1, αi ≥1, and
each pi is an odd prime. The case n = 1 is trivial, and for n ≥3 use 3.3 to construct
A0, A1, . . . , Ak in POLS of order 2α, pα1
1 , . . . , pαk
k
respectively. Then A0 × A1 × · · · × Ak is
the desired algebra.

To refute Euler’s conjecture we need to be more clever.
Deﬁnition 3.5. An algebra ⟨A, F⟩is a binary algebra if each of the fundamental operations
is binary. A binary algebra ⟨A, F⟩is idempotent if
f(x, x) ≈x
holds for each function symbol f.
Deﬁnition 3.6. Let IPOLS be the variety of idempotent algebras in POLS.
Our goal is to show that there is an idempotent pair of orthogonal Latin squares of order
54. We construct this algebra by using a block design obtained from the projective plane of
order 7 to paste together some small members of IPOLS which come from ﬁnite ﬁelds.
Deﬁnition 3.7. A variety V of algebras is binary idempotent if

118
III Selected Topics
(i) the members of V are binary idempotent algebras, and
(ii) V can be deﬁned by identities involving at most two variables.
Note that IPOLS is a binary idempotent variety.
Deﬁnition 3.8. A 2-design is a tuple ⟨B, B1, . . . , Bk⟩where
(i) B is a ﬁnite set,
(ii) each Bi is a subset of B (called a block),
(iii) |Bi| ≥2 for all i, and
(iv) each two-element subset of B is contained in exactly one block.
The crucial idea is contained in the following.
Lemma 3.9. Let V be a binary idempotent variety and let ⟨B, B1, . . ., Bk⟩be a 2-design.
Let n = |B|, ni = |Bi|. If V has members of size ni, 1 ≤i ≤k, then V has a member of
size n.
Proof. Let Ai ∈V with |Ai| = ni. We can assume Ai = Bi. Then for each binary function
symbol f in the type of V we can ﬁnd a binary function f B on B such that when we restrict
f B to Bi it agrees with f Ai (essentially we let f B be the union of the f Ai). As V can be
deﬁned by two variable identities p(x, y) ≈q(x, y) which hold on each Ai, it follows that we
have constructed an algebra B in V with |B| = n.

Lemma 3.10. If q is a prime power and q ≥4, then there is a member of IPOLS of size q.
In particular, there are members of sizes 5, 7, and 8.
Proof. Again let K be a ﬁeld of order q, let e1, e2 be two distinct elements of K −{0, 1},
and deﬁne two binary operations
1,
2 on K by
aib = ei · a + (1 −ei) · b.
We leave it to the reader to verify that the Cayley tables of ⟨K,
1⟩and ⟨K,
2⟩give rise to
an idempotent pair of orthogonal Latin squares.

Now we need a construction from ﬁnite projective geometry. Given a ﬁnite ﬁeld F of
cardinality n we form a projective plane Pn of order n by letting the points be the subsets of
F 3 of the form U where U is a one-dimensional subspace of F 3 (as a vector space over F),
and by letting the lines be the subsets of F 3 of the form V where V is a two-dimensional
subspace of F 3. One can readily verify that every line of Pn contains n + 1 points, and every
point of Pn “belongs to” (i.e., is contained in) n + 1 lines; and there are n2 + n + 1 points

§4. Finite State Acceptors
119
and n2 + n + 1 lines. Furthermore, any two distinct points belong to exactly one line and
any two distinct lines meet in exactly one point.
Lemma 3.11. There is a 2-design ⟨B, B1, . . . , Bk⟩with |B| = 54 and |Bi| ∈{5, 7, 8} for
1 ≤i ≤k.
Proof. Let π be the projective plane of order 7. This has 57 points and each line contains 8
points. Choose three points on one line and remove them. Let B be the set of the remaining
54 points, and let the Bi be the sets obtained by intersecting the lines of π with B. Then
⟨B, B1, . . . , Bk⟩is easily seen to be a 2-design since each pair of points from B lies on a
unique line of π, and |Bi| ∈{5, 7, 8}.

Theorem 3.12. There is an idempotent pair of orthogonal Latin squares of order 54.
Proof. Just combine 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.

Finite State Acceptors
In 1943 McCulloch and Pitts developed a model of nerve nets which was later formalized as
various types of ﬁnite state machines. The idea is quite simple. One considers the nervous
system as a ﬁnite collection of internal neurons and sensory neurons and considers time as
divided into suitably small subintervals such that in each subinterval each neuron either
ﬁres once or is inactive. The ﬁring of a given neuron during any one subinterval will send
impulses to certain other internal neurons during that subinterval. Such impulses are either
activating or deactivating. If an internal neuron receives suﬃciently many (the threshold of
the neuron) activating impulses and no deactivating impulses in a given subinterval, then it
ﬁres during the next subinterval of time. The sensory neurons can only be excited to ﬁre
by external stimuli. In any given subinterval of time, the state of the network of internal
neurons is deﬁned by noting which neurons are ﬁring and which are not, and the input during
any given subinterval to the network is determined by which sensory neurons are ﬁring and
which are not. We call an input during a subinterval of time a letter, the totality of letters
constituting the alphabet. A sequence of inputs (in consecutive subintervals) is a word. A
word is accepted (or recognized) by the neural network if after the sensory neurons proceed
through the sequence of inputs given by the letters of the word the internal neurons at some
speciﬁed number of subintervals later are in some one of the so-called accepting states.
In his 1956 paper, Kleene analyzed the possibilities for the set of all words which could
be accepted by a neural network and showed that they are precisely the regular languages.
Later Myhill showed the connection between these languages and certain congruences on the

120
III Selected Topics
monoid of words. Let us now abstract from the nerve nets, where we consider the states as
points and the letters of the alphabet as functions acting on the states, i.e., if we are in a
given state and read a given letter, the resulting state describes the action of the letter on
the given state.
Deﬁnition 4.1. A ﬁnite state acceptor (abbreviated f.s.a.) of type F (where the type is
ﬁnite) is a 4-tuple A = ⟨A, F, a0, A0⟩, where ⟨A, F⟩is a ﬁnite unary algebra of type F, a0 ∈A,
and A0 ⊆A. The set A is the set of states of A, a0 is the initial state, and A0 is the set of
ﬁnal states.
Deﬁnition 4.2. If we are given a ﬁnite type F of unary algebras, let ⟨F∗, ·, 1⟩be the monoid
of strings on F. Given a string w ∈F∗, an f.s.a. A of type F, and an element a ∈A, let w(a)
be the element resulting from applying the “term” w(x) to a; for example if w = fg then
w(a) = f(g(a)), and 1(a) = a.
Deﬁnition 4.3. A language of type F is a subset of F∗. A string w from F∗is accepted by
an f.s.a. A = ⟨A, F, a0, A0⟩of type F if w(a0) ∈A0. The language accepted by A, written
L(A), is the set of strings from F∗accepted by A. (“Language” has a diﬀerent meaning in
this section from that given in II§1.)
Deﬁnition 4.4. Given languages L, L1, and L2 of type F let
L1 · L2 = {w1 · w2 : w1 ∈L1, w2 ∈L2} and
L∗= the subuniverse of ⟨F∗, ·, 1⟩generated by L.
The set of regular languages of type F is the smallest collection of subsets of F∗which contains
the singleton languages {f}, f ∈F ∪{1}, and is closed under the set-theoretic operations,
∪, ∩, ′, and the operations · and ∗deﬁned above.
To prove that the languages accepted by f.s.a.’s form precisely the class of regular lan-
guages it is convenient to introduce partial algebras.
Deﬁnition 4.5. A partial unary algebra of type F is a pair ⟨A, F⟩where F is a family
of partially deﬁned unary functions on A indexed by F, i.e., the domain and range of each
function f are contained in A.
Deﬁnition 4.6. A partial ﬁnite state acceptor (partial f.s.a.) A = ⟨A, F, a0, A0⟩of type F
has the same deﬁnition as an f.s.a. of type F, except that we only require that ⟨A, F⟩be a
partial unary algebra of type F. Also the language accepted by A, L(A), is deﬁned as in 4.3.
(Note that for a given w ∈F∗, w(a) might not be deﬁned for some a ∈A.)
Lemma 4.7. Every language accepted by a partial f.s.a. is accepted by some f.s.a.

§4. Finite State Acceptors
121
Proof. Given a partial f.s.a. A = ⟨A, F, a0, A0⟩choose b ̸∈A and let B = A ∪{b}. For
f ∈F and a ∈A ∪{b}, if f(a) is not deﬁned in A let f(a) = b. This gives an f.s.a. which
accepts the same language as A.

Deﬁnition 4.8. If ⟨A, F, a0, A0⟩is a partial f.s.a. then, for a ∈A and w ∈F∗, the range of
w applied to a, written Rg(w, a), is the set
{fn(a), fn−1fn(a), . . . , f1 · · · fn(a)}
where w = f1 · · ·fn; and it is {a} if w = 1.
Lemma 4.9. The language accepted by any f.s.a. is regular.
Proof. Let L be the language of the partial f.s.a. A = ⟨A, F, a0, A0⟩. We will prove the
lemma by induction on |A|. First note that ∅is a regular language as ∅= {f}∩{f}′ for any
f ∈F. For the ground case suppose |A| = 1. If A0 = ∅then L(A) = ∅, a regular language.
If A0 = {a0} let
G = {f ∈F : f(a0) is deﬁned}.
Then
L(A) = G∗=

[

also a regular language.
For the induction step assume that |A| > 1, and for any partial f.s.a. B = ⟨B, F, b0, B0⟩
with |B| < |A| the language L(B) is regular. If A0 = ∅, then, as before, L(A) = ∅, a
regular language. So assume A0 ̸= ∅. The crux of the proof is to decompose any acceptable
word into a product of words which one can visualize as giving a sequence of cycles when
applied to a0, followed by a noncycle, mapping from a0 to a member of A0 if a0 ̸∈A0. Let
C ={⟨f1, f2⟩∈F × F : f1wf2(a0) = a0 for some w ∈F∗,
f2(a0) ̸= a0, and Rg(w; f2(a0)) ⊆A −{a0}}
which we picture as in Figure 24. Now, for ⟨f1, f2⟩∈C let
Cf1f2 = {w ∈F∗: f1wf2(a0) = a0, Rg(w; f2(a0)) ⊆A −{a0}}.
Then Cf1f2 is the language accepted by
⟨A −{a0}, F, f2(a0), f −1
1 (a0) −{a0}⟩;
hence, by the induction hypothesis, Cf1f2 is regular. Let
H = {f ∈F : f(a0) = a0} ∪{1}

and
D = {f ∈F : f(a0) ̸= a0}.
For f ∈D let
Ef = {w ∈F∗: wf(a0) ∈A0, Rg(w, f(a0)) ⊆A −{a0}}.
We see that Ef is the language accepted by
⟨A −{a0}, F, f(a0), A0 −{a0}⟩;
hence by the induction hypothesis, it is also regular. Let

for f ∈F
δt(t) = 1.

Lemma 4.11. If L is a language of type F ∪{t}, where t ̸∈F, which is also the language
accepted by some f.s.a., then δt(L) is a language of type F which is the language accepted by

and let
B = {Sw : w ∈F∗}.
This is of course ﬁnite as A is ﬁnite. For f ∈F deﬁne
f(Sw) = Sfw.
This makes sense as Sfw depends only on Sw, not on w. Next let

L = {f} then we can use the partial f.s.a. in Figure 25, where all functions not drawn are
undeﬁned, and A0 = {a}. If L = {1} use A = A0 = {a0} with all f’s undeﬁned.

Next suppose L1 is the language of ⟨A, F, a0, A0⟩and L2 is the language of ⟨B, F, b0, B0⟩.
Then L1 ∩L2 is the language of ⟨A × B, F, ⟨a0, b0⟩, A0 × B0⟩, where f(⟨a, b⟩) is deﬁned to
be ⟨f(a), f(b)⟩; and L′
1 is the language of ⟨A, F, a0, A −A0⟩(we are assuming ⟨A, F, a0, A0⟩
is an f.s.a.). Combining these we see by De Morgan’s law that L1 ∪L2 is the language of a
suitable f.s.a.
To handle L1 · L2 we ﬁrst expand our type to F ∪{t}. Then mapping each member of B0
to the input of a copy of A as in Figure 26 we see that L1 · {t} · L2 is the language of some
f.s.a.; hence if we use 4.11 it follows that L1 · L2 is the language of some f.s.a.

L∗
1 = δt[(L1 · {t})∗· L1 ∪{1}]
is the language of some f.s.a. This proves Kleene’s theorem.

Another approach to characterizing languages accepted by f.s.a.’s of type F uses congru-
ences on ⟨F∗, ·, 1⟩.
Deﬁnition 4.13. Let τ be the mapping from F∗to T(x), the set of terms of type F over x,
deﬁned by τ(w) = w(x).
Lemma 4.14. The mapping τ is an isomorphism between the monoid ⟨F∗, ·, 1⟩and the
monoid ⟨T(x), ◦, x⟩, where ◦is “composition.”
Proof. (Exercise.)

Deﬁnition 4.15. For θ ∈Con⟨F∗, ·, 1⟩let
θ(x) = {⟨w1(x), w2(x)⟩: ⟨w1, w2⟩∈θ}.
Lemma 4.16. The map θ 7→θ(x) is a lattice isomorphism from the lattice of congruences
of ⟨F∗, ·, 1⟩to the lattice of fully invariant congruences of T(x). (See II§14.)
Proof. Suppose θ ∈Con⟨F∗, ·, 1⟩and ⟨w1, w2⟩∈θ. Then for u ∈F∗, ⟨uw1, uw2⟩∈θ
suﬃces to show that θ(x) is a congruence on T(x), and ⟨w1u, w2u⟩∈θ shows that θ(x) is
fully invariant. The remaining details we leave to the reader.

Lemma 4.17. If L is a language of type F accepted by some f.s.a., then there is a θ ∈
Con⟨F∗, ·, 1⟩such that θ is of ﬁnite index (i.e., ⟨F∗, ·, 1⟩/θ is ﬁnite) and Lθ = L (see II§6.16),
i.e., L is a union of cosets of θ.
Proof. Choose A an f.s.a. of type F such that L(A) = L. Let FA(x) be the free algebra
freely generated by x in the variety V (⟨A, F⟩). Let
α : T(x) →FA(x)
be the natural homomorphism deﬁned by α(x) = x, and let
β : FA(x) →⟨A, F⟩
be the homomorphism deﬁned by β(x) = a0. Then, with
L(x) = {w(x) : w ∈L},
L(x) = α−1β−1(A0)
=
[
p∈β−1(A0)
p/ ker α;

126

hence
L(x) = L(x)ker α.
As ker α is a fully invariant congruence on T(x) we have ker α = θ(x) for some θ ∈
Con⟨F∗, ·, 1⟩. Thus
L(x) = L(x)θ(x);
hence
L = Lθ.
As ker α is of ﬁnite index, it follows that θ is also of ﬁnite index.

w1 ≡L w2
iﬀ
(uw1v ∈L ⇔uw2v ∈L for u, v ∈F∗).
Lemma 4.20. If we are given L, a language of type F, then ≡L is the largest congruence θ
on ⟨F∗, ·, 1⟩such that Lθ = L.
Proof. Suppose Lθ = L. Then for ⟨w1, w2⟩∈θ and u, v ∈F∗, ⟨uw1v, uw2v⟩∈θ; hence
uw1v ∈L ⇔uw2v ∈L as uw1v/θ = uw2v/θ and L = S
w∈L w/θ. Thus θ ⊆≡L .

Next ≡L is easily seen to be an equivalence relation on F∗. If w1 ≡L w2 and ˆw1 ≡L ˆw2
then for u, v ∈F∗,
uw1 ˆw1v ∈L
iﬀ
uw1 ˆw2v ∈L
iﬀ
uw2 ˆw2v ∈L;
hence
w1 ˆw1 ≡L w2 ˆw2,
so ≡L is indeed a congruence on ⟨F∗, ·, 1⟩.
If now w ∈L and w ≡L ˆw then
1 · w · 1 ∈L ⇔1 · ˆw · 1 ∈L
implies ˆw ∈L; hence w/ ≡L ⊆L. Thus L≡L = L.

Deﬁnition 4.21. If we are given a language L of type F, then the syntactic monoid ML of
L is deﬁned by
ML = ⟨F∗, ·, 1⟩/ ≡L .
Theorem 4.22. A language L is accepted by some f.s.a. iﬀML is ﬁnite.
Proof. Just combine 4.18 and 4.20.

Chapter IV
Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
Boolean algebras, essentially introduced by Boole in the 1850’s to codify the laws of thought,
have been a popular topic of research since then. A major breakthrough was the duality
between Boolean algebras and Boolean spaces discovered by Stone in the 1930’s. Stone also
proved that Boolean algebras and Boolean rings are essentially the same in that one can con-
vert via terms from one to the other. Following Stone’s papers numerous results appeared
which generalized or used his results to obtain structure theorems—these include the work of
Montgomery and McCoy (rings), Rosenbloom (Post algebras), Arens and Kaplansky (rings),
Foster (Boolean powers), Foster and Pixley (various notions of primality), Dauns and Hof-
mann (biregular rings), Pierce (rings), Comer (cylindric algebras and general algebras), and
Bulman-Fleming, Keimel, and Werner (discriminator varieties).
Since every Boolean algebra can be represented as a ﬁeld of sets, the class of Boolean
algebras is sometimes regarded as being rather uncomplicated. However, when one starts
to look at basic questions concerning decidability, rigidity, direct products, etc., they are
associated with some of the most challenging results. Our major goal in this chapter will be
representation theorems based on Boolean algebras, with some fascinating digressions.
§1.
Boolean Algebras
Let us repeat our deﬁnition from II§1.
Deﬁnition 1.1. A Boolean algebra is an algebra ⟨B, ∨, ∧, ′, 0, 1⟩with two binary operations,
one unary operation (called complementation), and two nullary operations which satisﬁes:
B1: ⟨B, ∨, ∧⟩is a distributive lattice
B2: x ∧0 ≈0, x ∨1 ≈1
B3: x ∧x′ ≈0, x ∨x′ ≈1.
Thus Boolean algebras form an equational class, and hence a variety. Some useful prop-
erties of Boolean algebras follow.

Lemma 1.2. Let B be a Boolean algebra. Then B satisﬁes
B4: a ∧b = 0 and a ∨b = 1 imply a = b′
B5: (x′)′ ≈x
B6: (x ∨y)′ ≈x′ ∧y′, (x ∧y)′ ≈x′ ∨y′ (DeMorgan’s Laws).
Proof. If
a ∧b = 0
then
a′ = a′ ∨(a ∧b)
= (a′ ∨a) ∧(a′ ∨b)
= 1 ∧(a′ ∨b)
= a′ ∨b;
hence a′ ≥b, and if
a ∨b = 1
then
a′ = a′ ∧(a ∨b)
= (a′ ∧a) ∨(a′ ∧b)
= 0 ∨(a′ ∧b)
= a′ ∧b.
Thus a′ ≤b; hence
b = a′.
This proves B4.
Now
a′ ∧a = 0
and
a′ ∨a = 1;
hence
a = (a′)′
by B4, so B5 is established. Finally
(x ∨y) ∨(x′ ∧y′) ≈x ∨[y ∨(x′ ∧y′)]
≈x ∨[(y ∨x′) ∧(y ∨y′)]
≈x ∨y ∨x′
≈1

§1. Boolean Algebras
131
and
(x ∨y) ∧(x′ ∧y′) ≈[x ∧(x′ ∧y′)] ∨[y ∧(x′ ∧y′)]
≈0 ∨0
≈0.
Thus by B4
x′ ∧y′ ≈(x ∨y)′.
Similarly (interchanging ∨and ∧, 0 and 1), we establish
x′ ∨y′ ≈(x ∧y)′.
Perhaps the best known Boolean algebras are the following.
Deﬁnition 1.3.
Let X be a set.
The Boolean algebra of subsets of X, Su(X), has
as its universe Su(X) and as operations ∪, ∩, ′, ∅, X. The Boolean algebra 2 is given by
⟨2, ∨, ∧, ′, 0, 1⟩where ⟨2, ∨, ∧⟩is a two element lattice with 0 < 1, and where 0′ = 1, 1′ = 0;
also 1 = ⟨{∅}, ∨, ∧, ′, ∅, ∅⟩.
It is an easy exercise to see that if |X| = 1 then Su(X) ∼= 2; and Su(∅) = 1.
Lemma 1.4. Let X be a set. Then Su(X) ∼= 2X.
Proof. Let α : Su(X) →2X be such that
α(Y )(x) = 1
iﬀ
x ∈Y.
Then α is a bijection, and both α and α−1 are order-preserving maps between ⟨Su(X), ⊆⟩
and ⟨2X, ≤⟩; hence we have a lattice isomorphism. Also for Y ⊆X
α(Y ′)(x) = 1
iﬀ
x ̸∈Y
iﬀ
α(Y )(x) = 0;
hence
α(Y ′)(x) = (α(Y )(x))′,
so
α(Y ′) = (α(Y ))′.
As
α(∅) = 0
and
α(X) = 1
we have an isomorphism.

Deﬁnition 1.5. If B is a Boolean algebra and a ∈B, let B↾a be the algebra
⟨[0, a], ∨, ∧,∗, 0, a⟩
where [0, a] is the interval {x ∈B : 0 ≤x ≤a}, ∨and ∧are the same as in B except
restricted to [0, a], and b∗is deﬁned to be a ∧b′.
Lemma 1.6. If B is a Boolean algebra and a ∈B then B↾a is also a Boolean algebra.
Proof. Clearly ⟨[0, a], ∨, ∧⟩is a distributive lattice, as it is a sublattice of ⟨B, ∨, ∧⟩. For
b ∈[0, a] we have
b ∧0 = 0,
b ∨a = a,
b ∧b∗= b ∧(a ∧b′)
= 0,
b ∨b∗= b ∨(a ∧b′)
= (a ∧b) ∨(a ∧b′)
= a ∧(b ∨b′)
= a ∧1
= a.
Thus B↾a is a Boolean algebra.

Lemma 1.7. If B is a Boolean algebra and a ∈B then the map
αa : B →B↾a
deﬁned by
αa(b) = a ∧b
is a surjective homomorphism from B to B↾a.

§1. Boolean Algebras
133
Proof. If b, c ∈B then
αa(b ∨c) = a ∧(b ∨c)
= (a ∧b) ∨(a ∧c)
= αa(b) ∨αa(c),
αa(b ∧c) = a ∧(b ∧c)
= (a ∧b) ∧(a ∧c)
= αa(b) ∧αa(c),
αa(b′) = a ∧b′
= (a ∧a′) ∨(a ∧b′)
= a ∧(a′ ∨b′)
= a ∧(a ∧b)′
= (αa(b))∗,
αa(0) = 0
and
αa(1) = a.
Thus αa is indeed a homomorphism.

Theorem 1.8. If B is a Boolean algebra and a ∈B, then
B ∼= B↾a × B↾a′.
Proof. Let
α : B →B↾a × B↾a′
be deﬁned by
α(b) = ⟨αa(b), αa′(b)⟩.
It is easily seen that α is a homomorphism, and for
⟨b, c⟩∈B↾a × B↾a′
we have
α(b ∨c) = ⟨a ∧(b ∨c), a′ ∧(b ∨c)⟩
= ⟨b, c⟩
as
a ∧(b ∨c) = (a ∧b) ∨(a ∧c)
= b ∨0
= b,

134
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
etc. Thus α is surjective. Now if
α(b) = α(c)
for any b, c ∈B then
a ∧b = a ∧c
and
a′ ∧b = a′ ∧c
so
(a ∧b) ∨(a′ ∧b) = (a ∧c) ∨(a′ ∧c);
hence
(a ∨a′) ∧b = (a ∨a′) ∧c,
and thus
b = c.
This guarantees that α is the desired isomorphism.

Corollary 1.9 (Stone). 2 is, up to isomorphism, the only directly indecomposable Boolean
algebra which is nontrivial.
Proof. If B is a Boolean algebra and |B| > 2, let a ∈B, 0 < a < 1. Then 0 < a′ < 1,
and hence both B↾a and B↾a′ are nontrivial. From 1.8 it follows that B is not directly
indecomposable.

Corollary 1.10 (Stone). Every ﬁnite Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra
of all subsets of some ﬁnite set X.
Proof. Every ﬁnite Boolean algebra B is isomorphic to a direct product of directly inde-
composable Boolean algebras by II§7.10; hence B ∼= 2n for some ﬁnite n. Now 1.4 applies.

Deﬁnition 1.11. A ﬁeld of subsets of the set X is a subalgebra of Su(X), i.e., a family of
subsets of X closed under union, intersection, and complementation and containing ∅and
X, with the operations of Su(X).
Corollary 1.12.
Every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a subdirect power of 2; hence
(Stone) every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a ﬁeld of sets.
Proof. The only nontrivial subdirectly irreducible Boolean algebra is 2, in view of 1.9.
Thus Birkhoﬀ’s theorem guarantees that for every Boolean algebra B there is an X and a
subdirect embedding α : B →2X; hence by 1.4 there is an embedding β : B →Su(X).

Deﬁnition 1.13. Let BA be the class of Boolean algebras.
The next result is immediate from 1.12.
Corollary 1.14. BA = V (2) = ISP(S) = IPS(S), where S = {1, 2}.

(a) ci(x) ≈0 ↔x ≈0
(b) ci(ci(x)) ≈ci(x)
(c) x ∧ci(y) ≈0 ↔ci(x) ∧y ≈0

A ↾a ∈CAn, and the map α : A →A ↾a deﬁned by α(b) = b ∧a is a surjective
homomorphism from A to A↾a.
14. If A ∈CAn, a ∈A, show that c(a) = a implies c(a′) = a′. Hence show that if c(a) = a

Boolean Rings
The observation that Boolean algebras could be regarded as rings is due to Stone.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A ring R = ⟨R, +, ·, −, 0, 1⟩is Boolean if R satisﬁes
x2 ≈x.
Lemma 2.2. If R is a Boolean ring, then R satisﬁes
x + x ≈0
and
x · y ≈y · x.

§2. Boolean Rings
137
Proof. Let a, b ∈R. Then
(a + a)2 = a + a
implies
a2 + a2 + a2 + a2 = a + a;
hence
a + a + a + a = a + a,
so
a + a = 0.
Thus
R |= x + x ≈0.
Now
(a + b)2 = a + b,
so
a2 + a · b + b · a + b2 = a + b;
hence
a + a · b + b · a + b = a + b,
yielding
a · b + b · a = 0.
As
a · b + a · b = 0
this says
a · b + a · b = a · b + b · a,
so
a · b = b · a.
Thus
R |= x · y ≈y · x.

Theorem 2.3 (Stone). (a) Let B = ⟨B, ∨, ∧, ′, 0, 1⟩be a Boolean algebra. Deﬁne B⊗to be
the algebra ⟨B, +, ·, −, 0, 1⟩, where
a + b = (a ∧b′) ∨(a′ ∧b)
a · b = a ∧b
−a = a.
Then B⊗is a Boolean ring.

(b) Let R = ⟨R, +, ·, −, 0, 1⟩be a Boolean ring. Deﬁne R⊗to be the algebra ⟨R, ∨, ∧, ′, 0, 1⟩
where
a ∨b = a + b + a · b
a ∧b = a · b
a′ = 1 + a.
Then R⊗is a Boolean algebra.
(c) Given B and R as above we have B⊗⊗= B, R⊗⊗= R.
Proof. (a) Let a, b, c ∈B. Then
(i)
a + 0 = (a ∧0′) ∨(a′ ∧0)
= a ∧1
= a
(ii)
a + b = (a ∧b′) ∨(a′ ∧b)
= (b ∧a′) ∨(b′ ∧a)
= b + a
(iii)
a + a = (a ∧a′) ∨(a′ ∧a)
= 0
(iv)
a + (b + c) = [a ∧(b + c)′] ∨[a′ ∧(b + c)]
= {a ∧[(b ∧c′) ∨(b′ ∧c)]′} ∨{a′ ∧[(b ∧c′) ∨(b′ ∧c)]}
= {a ∧[(b′ ∨c) ∧(b ∨c′)]} ∨{(a′ ∧b ∧c′) ∨(a′ ∧b′ ∧c)}
= {a ∧[(b′ ∧c′) ∨(c ∧b)]} ∨{(a′ ∧b ∧c′) ∨(a′ ∧b′ ∧c)}
= (a ∧b′ ∧c′) ∨(a ∧b ∧c) ∨(a′ ∧b ∧c′) ∨(a′ ∧b′ ∧c)
= (a ∧b ∧c) ∨(a ∧b′ ∧c′) ∨(b ∧c′ ∧a′) ∨(c ∧a′ ∧b′).
The value of this last expression does not change if we permute a, b and c in any manner;
hence c + (a + b) = a + (b + c), so by (ii) (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).
(v)
a · 1 = 1 · a = a
(vi)
a · (b · c) = a ∧(b ∧c)
= (a ∧b) ∧c
= (a · b) · c
(vii)
a · (b + c) = a ∧[(b ∧c′) ∨(b′ ∧c)]
= (a ∧b ∧c′) ∨(a ∧b′ ∧c)

§2. Boolean Rings
139
and
(a · b) + (a · c) = [(a ∧b) ∧(a ∧c)′] ∨[(a ∧b)′ ∧(a ∧c)]
= [(a ∧b) ∧(a′ ∨c′)] ∨[(a′ ∨b′) ∧(a ∧c)]
= (a ∧b ∧c′) ∨(b′ ∧a ∧c)
so
a · (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c).
(viii)
a · a = a ∧a
= a.
Thus B⊗is a Boolean ring.
(b) Let a, b, c ∈R. Then
(i)
a ∨b = a + b + a · b
= b + a + b · a
= b ∨a
(ii)
a ∧b = a · b
= b · a
= b ∧a
(iii)
a ∨(b ∨c) = a + (b ∨c) + a · (b ∨c)
= a + (b + c + b · c) + a · (b + c + b · c)
= a + b + c + a · b + a · c + b · c + a · b · c.
The value of this last expression does not change if we permute a, b and c, so
a ∨(b ∨c) = c ∨(a ∨b);
hence by (i) above
a ∨(b ∨c) = (a ∨b) ∨c.
(iv)
a ∧(b ∧c) = a · (b · c)
= (a · b) · c
= (a ∧b) ∧c
(v)
a ∨a = a + a + a · a
= 0 + a
= a

IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
(vi)
a ∧a = a · a
= a
(vii)
a ∨(a ∧b) = a + (a ∧b) + a · (a ∧b)
= a + a · b + a · (a · b)
= a + a · b + a · b
= a
(viii)
a ∧(a ∨b) = a · (a + b + a · b)
= a2 + a · b + a2 · b
= a + a · b + a · b
= a
(ix)
a ∧(b ∨c) = a · (b + c + b · c)
= a · b + a · c + a · b · c
= a · b + a · c + a · b · a · c
= (a ∧b) ∨(a ∧c)
(x)
a ∧0 = a · 0
= 0
(xi)
a ∨1 = a + 1 + a · 1
= 1
(xii)
a ∧a′ = a · (1 + a)
= a + a2
= a + a
= 0
(xiii)
a ∨a′ = a + (1 + a) + a · (1 + a)
= a + 1 + a + a + a2
= 1.
Thus R⊗is a Boolean algebra.
(c) Suppose B = ⟨B, ∨, ∧, ′, 0, 1⟩is a Boolean algebra and a, b ∈B. Then with B⊗=
⟨B, +, ·, −, 0, 1⟩
(i)
a · b = a ∧b
(ii)
1 + a = (1 ∧a′) ∨(1′ ∧a) = a′

§2. Boolean Rings

(iii)
a + b + a · b = a + (b + a · b)
= a + b · (1 + a)
= a + b · a′
= [a ∧(b ∧a′)′] ∨[a′ ∧(b ∧a′)]
= [a ∧(b′ ∨a)] ∨[a′ ∧b]
= a ∨(a′ ∧b)
= (a ∨a′) ∧(a ∨b)
= a ∨b.
Thus B⊗⊗= B.
Next suppose R = ⟨R, +, ·, −, 0, 1⟩is a Boolean ring. Then with R⊗= ⟨R, ∨, ∧, ′, 0, 1⟩
and a, b ∈R,
(i)
(a ∧b′) ∨(a′ ∧b) = [a · (1 + b)] + [(1 + a) · b] + [a · (1 + b) · (1 + a) · b]
= [a + a · b] + [b + a · b] + 0
= a + b
(ii)
a ∧b = a · b.
Thus R⊗⊗= R.

6. If A is an ordered basis of B, show that 1 ∈A, A is a basis for the vector space ⟨B, +⟩
over the two-element ﬁeld, and each nonzero element of B can be uniquely expressed
in the form a1 + · · · + an with ai ∈A, a1 < a2 < · · · < an.
7. Show that every countable Boolean algebra has an ordered basis.

Filters and Ideals
Since congruences on rings are associated with ideals, it follows that the same must hold
for Boolean rings. The translation of Boolean rings to Boolean algebras, namely R 7→R⊗,
gives rise to ideals of Boolean algebras. The image of an ideal under ′ gives a ﬁlter.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let B = ⟨B, ∨, ∧, ′, 0, 1⟩be a Boolean algebra. A subset I of B is called
an ideal of B if
(i) 0 ∈I
(ii) a, b ∈I ⇒a ∨b ∈I
(iii) a ∈I and b ≤a ⇒b ∈I.
A subset F of B is called a ﬁlter of B if
(i) 1 ∈F
(ii) a, b ∈F ⇒a ∧b ∈F

§3. Filters and Ideals

(iii) a ∈F and b ≥a ⇒b ∈F.
Theorem 3.2. Let B = ⟨B, ∨, ∧, ′, 0, 1⟩be a Boolean algebra. Then I is an ideal of B iﬀI
is an ideal of B⊗.
Proof. Recall that I is an ideal of a ring B⊗iﬀ
0 ∈I,
a, b ∈I ⇒a + b ∈I
as −b = b, and
a ∈I, b ∈R ⇒a · b ∈I.
So suppose I is an ideal of B. Then
0 ∈I,
and if a, b ∈I then
a ∧b′ ≤a,
a′ ∧b ≤b,
so
a ∧b′, a′ ∧b ∈I;
hence
a + b = (a ∧b′) ∨(a′ ∧b) ∈I.
Now if a ∈I and b ∈B then
a ∧b ≤a,
so
a · b = a ∧b ∈I.
Thus I is an ideal of B⊗.
Next suppose I is an ideal of B⊗. Then 0 ∈I, and if a, b ∈I then
a · b ∈I;
hence
a ∨b = a + b + a · b ∈I.
If a ∈I and b ≤a then
b = a ∧b = a · b ∈I,
so I is an ideal of B.

Deﬁnition 3.3. If X ⊆B, where B is a Boolean algebra, let
X′ = {a′ : a ∈X}.
The next result shows that ideals and ﬁlters come in pairs.
Lemma 3.4. Given a Boolean algebra B, then
(a) For I ⊆B, I is an ideal iﬀI′ is a ﬁlter,
(b) For F ⊆B, F is a ﬁlter iﬀF ′ is an ideal.
Proof. First
0 ∈I
iﬀ
1 = 0′ ∈I′.
If a, b ∈I then
a ∨b ∈I
iﬀ
(a ∨b)′ = a′ ∧b′ ∈I′.
For a ∈I we have b ≤a iﬀa′ ≤b′; hence b ∈I iﬀb′ ∈I′. This proves (a), and (b) is handled
similarly.

The following is now an easy consequence of results about rings, but we will give a direct
proof.
Theorem 3.5. Let B be a Boolean algebra. If θ is a binary relation on B, then θ is a
congruence on B iﬀ0/θ is an ideal, and for a, b ∈B we have
⟨a, b⟩∈θ
iﬀ
a + b ∈0/θ.
Proof. (⇒) Suppose θ is a congruence on B. Then
0 ∈0/θ,
and if a, b ∈0/θ then
⟨a, 0⟩∈θ,
⟨b, 0⟩∈θ,
so
⟨a ∨b, 0 ∨0⟩∈θ,
i.e.,
a ∨b ∈0/θ.
Now if a ∈0/θ and b ≤a then
⟨a, 0⟩∈θ

§3. Filters and Ideals
145
so
⟨a ∧b, 0 ∧b⟩∈θ,
i.e.,
⟨b, 0⟩∈θ;
hence
b ∈0/θ.
This shows that 0/θ is an ideal. Now
⟨a, b⟩∈θ
implies
⟨a + b, b + b⟩∈θ,
i.e.,
⟨a + b, 0⟩∈θ,
so
a + b ∈0/θ.
Conversely,
a + b ∈0/θ
implies
⟨a + b, 0⟩∈θ,
so
⟨(a + b) + b, 0 + b⟩∈θ,
thus
⟨a, b⟩∈θ.
(⇐) For this direction, ﬁrst note that θ is an equivalence relation on B as
⟨a, a⟩∈θ,
since
a + a = 0,
for a ∈B; if
⟨a, b⟩∈θ
then
⟨b, a⟩∈θ
as
a + b = b + a;

146
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
and if
⟨a, b⟩∈θ,
⟨b, c⟩∈θ
then
a + c = (a + b) + (b + c) ∈0/θ;
hence
⟨a, c⟩∈θ.
Next to show that θ is compatible with the operations of B, let a1, a2, b1, b2 ∈B with
⟨a1, a2⟩∈θ,
⟨b1, b2⟩∈θ.
Then
(a1 ∧b1) + (a2 ∧b2) = (a1 · b1) + (a2 · b2)
= (a1 · b1) + [(a1 · b2) + (a1 · b2)] + (a2 · b2)
= a1 · (b1 + b2) + (a1 + a2) · b2 ∈0/θ,
so
⟨a1 ∧b1, a2 ∧b2⟩∈θ.
Next
(a1 ∨b1) + (a2 ∨b2) = (a1 + b1 + a1 · b1) + (a2 + b2 + a2 · b2)
= (a1 + a2) + (b1 + b2) + (a1 ∧b1 + a2 ∧b2) ∈0/θ
as each of the three summands belongs to 0/θ, so
⟨a1 ∨b1, a2 ∨b2⟩∈θ.
From
a1 + a2 ∈0/θ
it follows that
(1 + a1) + (1 + a2) ∈0/θ,
so
⟨a′
1, a′
2⟩∈θ.
This suﬃces to show that θ is a congruence.

Deﬁnition 3.6. If I is an ideal of a Boolean algebra B, let B/I denote the quotient algebra
B/θ, where
⟨a, b⟩∈θ
iﬀ
a + b ∈I.
Let b/I denote the equivalence class b/θ for b ∈B. If F is a ﬁlter of B let B/F denote B/F ′
and let b/F denote b/F ′ (see 3.3).
Since we have established a correspondence between ideals, ﬁlters, and congruences of
Boolean algebras, it is natural to look at the corresponding lattices.
Lemma 3.7. The set of ideals and the set of ﬁlters of a Boolean algebra are closed under
arbitrary intersection.
Proof. (Exercise).

Deﬁnition 3.8. Given a Boolean algebra B and a set X ⊆B let I(X) denote the least ideal
containing X, called the ideal generated by X, and let F(X) denote the least ﬁlter containing
X, called the ﬁlter generated by X.
Lemma 3.9. For B a Boolean algebra and X ⊆B, we have
(a) I(X) = {b ∈B : b ≤b1 ∨· · · ∨bn for some b1, . . . , bn ∈X} ∪{0}
(b) F(X) = {b ∈B : b ≥b1 ∧· · · ∧bn for some b1, . . . , bn ∈X} ∪{1}.
Proof. For (a) note that
0 ∈I(X),
and for b1, . . ., bn ∈X we must have
b1 ∨· · · ∨bn ∈I(X),
so
I(X) ⊇{b ∈B : b ≤b1 ∨· · · ∨bn for some b1, . . . , bn ∈X} ∪{0}.
All we need to do is show that the latter set is an ideal as it certainly contains X, and for
this it suﬃces to show that it is closed under join. If
b ≤b1 ∨· · · ∨bn,
c ≤c1 ∨· · · ∨cm
with b1, . . . , bn, c1, . . . , cm ∈X then
b ∨c ≤b1 ∨· · · ∨bn ∨c1 ∨· · · ∨cm
so I(X) is as described. The discussion of F(X) parallels the above.

IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
Lemma 3.10. Let B be a Boolean algebra.
(a) The set of ideals of B forms a distributive lattice (under ⊆) where, for ideals I1, I2,
I1 ∧I2 = I1 ∩I2,
I1 ∨I2 = {a ∈B : a ≤a1 ∨a2 for some a1 ∈I1, a2 ∈I2}.
(b) The set of ﬁlters of B forms a distributive lattice (under ⊆) where, for ﬁlters F1, F2,
F1 ∧F2 = F1 ∩F2,
F1 ∨F2 = {a ∈B : a ≥a1 ∧a2 for some a1 ∈F1, a2 ∈F2}.
(c) Both of these lattices are isomorphic to Con B.
Proof. From 3.5 it is evident that the mapping
θ 7→0/θ
from congruences on B to ideals of B is a bijection such that
θ1 ⊆θ2
iﬀ
0/θ1 ⊆0/θ2.
Thus the ideals form a lattice isomorphic to Con B. The calculations given for ∧and ∨
follow from 3.7 and 3.9. The ﬁlters are handled similarly. The distributivity of these lattices
follows from the fact that Boolean algebras form a congruence-distributive variety, see II§12,
or one can verify this directly.

A remarkable role will be played in this text by maximal ﬁlters, the so-called ultraﬁlters.
Deﬁnition 3.11. A ﬁlter F of a Boolean algebra B is an ultraﬁlter if F is maximal with
respect to the property that 0 ̸∈F. A maximal ideal of B is an ideal which is maximal
with respect to the property that 1 ̸∈I. (Thus only non-trivial Boolean algebras can have
ultraﬁlters or maximal ideals.)
In view of 3.4, F is an ultraﬁlter of B iﬀF ′ is a maximal ideal of B, and I is a maximal
ideal of B iﬀI′ is an ultraﬁlter. The following simple criterion is most useful.
Theorem 3.12. Let F be a ﬁlter [I be an ideal ] of B. Then F is an ultraﬁlter [I is a
maximal ideal ] of B iﬀfor any a ∈B, exactly one of a, a′ belongs to F [belongs to I ].
Proof. Suppose F is a ﬁlter of B.
(⇒) If F is an ultraﬁlter then
B/F ∼= 2

§3. Filters and Ideals
149
by 1.9 as B/F is simple by II§8.9. Let
ν : B →B/F
be the natural homomorphism. For a ∈B,
ν(a′) = ν(a)′
so
ν(a) = 1/F
or
ν(a′) = 1/F,
as B/F ∼= 2; hence
a ∈F
or
a′ ∈F.
If we are given a ∈B then exactly one of a, a′ is in F as
a ∧a′ = 0 ̸∈F.
(⇐) For a ∈B suppose exactly one of a, a′ ∈F. Then if F1 is a ﬁlter of B with
F ⊆F1
and
F ̸= F1
let a ∈F1 −F. As a′ ∈F we have
0 = a ∧a′ ∈F1;
hence F1 = B. Thus F is an ultraﬁlter.
The ideals are handled in the same manner.

Corollary 3.13. Let B be a Boolean algebra.
(a) Let F be a ﬁlter of B. Then F is an ultraﬁlter of B iﬀ0 ̸∈F and for a, b ∈B, a∨b ∈F
iﬀa ∈F or b ∈F.
(b) (Stone) Let I be an ideal of B. Then I is a maximal ideal of B iﬀ1 ̸∈I and for
a, b ∈B, a ∧b ∈I iﬀa ∈I or b ∈I.
Proof. We will prove the case of ﬁlters.
(⇒) Suppose F is an ultraﬁlter with
a ∨b ∈F.
As
(a ∨b) ∧(a′ ∧b′) = 0 ̸∈F
we have
a′ ∧b′ ̸∈F;

150
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
hence
a′ ̸∈F
or
b′ ̸∈F.
By 3.12 either
a ∈F
or
b ∈F.
(⇐) Since 1 ∈F, given a ∈B we have
a ∨a′ ∈F;
hence
a ∈F
or
a′ ∈F.
Both a, a′ cannot belong to F as
a ∧a′ = 0 ̸∈F.

Deﬁnition 3.14. An ideal I of a Boolean algebra is called a prime ideal if 1 ̸∈I and
a ∧b ∈I
implies
a ∈I or b ∈I.
Thus we have just seen that the prime ideals of a Boolean algebra are precisely the
maximal ideals.
Theorem 3.15. Let B be a Boolean algebra.
(a) (Stone) If a ∈B −{0}, then there is a prime ideal I such that a ̸∈I.
(b) If a ∈B −{1}, then there is an ultraﬁlter U of B with a ̸∈U.
Proof. (a) If a ∈B −{0}, let
α : B →2J
be any subdirect embedding of B into 2J for some J (see 1.12). Then
α(a) ̸= α(0),
so for some j ∈J we have
(πj ◦α)(a) ̸= (πj ◦α)(0).
As
πj ◦α : B →2
is onto it follows that
θ = ker(πj ◦α)
is a maximal congruence on B; hence
I = 0/θ

§3. Filters and Ideals
151
is a maximal ideal, thus a prime ideal, and a ̸∈I.
(b) is handled similarly.

Lemma 3.16. Let B1 and B2 be Boolean algebras and suppose
α : B1 →B2
is a homomorphism. If U is an ultraﬁlter of B2, then α−1(U) is an ultraﬁlter of B1.
Proof. Let U be an ultraﬁlter of B2 and β the natural map from B2 to B2/U. Then
α−1(U) = (β ◦α)−1(1),
hence α−1(U) is an ultraﬁlter of B1 (as the ultraﬁlters of B1 are just the preimages of 1
under homomorphisms to 2).

Theorem 3.17. Let B be a Boolean algebra.
(a) If F is a ﬁlter of B and a ∈B −F, then there is an ultraﬁlter U with F ⊆U and
a ̸∈U.
(b) (Stone) If I is an ideal of B and a ∈B −I, then there is a maximal ideal M with
I ⊆M and a ̸∈M.
Proof. For (a) choose an ultraﬁlter U∗of B/F by 3.15 with
a/F ̸∈U∗.
Then let U be the inverse image of U∗under the canonical map from B to B/F. (b) is
handled similarly.

Stone Duality
We will refer to the duality Stone established between Boolean algebras and certain topo-
logical spaces as Stone duality. In the following when we speak of a “clopen” set, we will
mean of course a closed and open set.
Deﬁnition 4.1. A topological space is a Boolean space if it (i) is Hausdorﬀ, (ii) is compact,
and (iii) has a basis of clopen subsets.
Deﬁnition 4.2. Let B be a Boolean algebra. Deﬁne B∗to be the topological space whose
underlying set is the collection B∗of ultraﬁlters of B, and whose topology has a subbasis
consisting of all sets of the form
Na = {U ∈B∗: a ∈U},
for a ∈B.
Lemma 4.3. If B is a Boolean algebra and a, b ∈B then
Na ∪Nb = Na∨b,
Na ∩Nb = Na∧b,
and
Na′ = (Na)′.
Thus in particular the Na’s form a basis for the topology of B∗.

§4. Stone Duality
153
Proof.
U ∈Na ∪Nb
iﬀ
a ∈U or b ∈U
iﬀ
a ∨b ∈U
iﬀ
U ∈Na∨b.
Thus
Na ∪Nb = Na∨b.
The other two identities can be derived similarly.

Lemma 4.4. Let X be a topological space. Then the clopen subsets of X form a subuniverse
of Su(X).
Proof. (Exercise.)

Deﬁnition 4.5. If X is a topological space, let X∗be the subalgebra of Su(X) with universe
the collection of clopen subsets of X.
Theorem 4.6 (Stone). (a) Let B be a Boolean algebra. Then B∗is a Boolean space, and B
is isomorphic to B∗∗under the mapping
a 7→Na.
(b) Let X be a Boolean space. Then X∗is a Boolean algebra, and X is homeomorphic
to X∗∗under the mapping
x 7→{N ∈X∗: x ∈N}.
Proof. (a) To show that B∗is compact let (Na)a∈J be a basic open cover of B∗, where
J ⊆B. Now suppose no ﬁnite subset of J has 1 as its join in B. Then J is contained in a
maximal ideal M, and
U = M′
is an ultraﬁlter with
U ∩J = ∅.
But then
U ̸∈Na
for a ∈J, which is impossible. Hence for some ﬁnite subset J0 of J we have
_
J0 = 1.
As
_
J0 ∈U

154
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
for every ultraﬁlter U we must have
U ∈Na
for some a ∈J0 by 3.13, so (Na)a∈J0 is a cover of B∗. Thus B∗is compact. It clearly has a
basis of clopen sets as each Na is clopen since
Na ∩Na′ = ∅,
Na ∪Na′ = B∗.
Now if
U1 ̸= U2
in B∗let
a ∈U1 −U2.
Then
U1 ∈Na,
U2 ∈Na′,
so B∗is Hausdorﬀ. Thus B∗is a Boolean space.
The mapping a 7→Na is clearly a homomorphism from B to B∗∗in view of 4.3. If a, b ∈B
and a ̸= b then
(a ∨b) ∧(a ∧b)′ ̸= 0,
so by 3.15(a) there is a prime ideal I such that
(a ∨b) ∧(a ∧b)′ ̸∈I,
so there is an ultraﬁlter U(= I′) such that
(a ∨b) ∧(a ∧b)′ ∈U.
But then
(a ∧b)′ ∈U
so
a ∧b ̸∈U;
hence
a ̸∈U
or
b ̸∈U;
but as
a ∨b ∈U
we have
a ∈U
or
b ∈U

§4. Stone Duality
155
so exactly one of a, b is in U; hence
Na ̸= Nb.
Thus the mapping is injective. If now N is any clopen subset of B∗then, being open, N is a
union of basic open subsets Na, and being a closed subset of a compact space, N is compact.
Thus N is a ﬁnite union of basic open sets, so N is equal to some Na, by 4.3.
Thus B ∼= B∗∗under the above mapping.
(b) X∗is a Boolean algebra by 4.4. Let
α : X →X∗∗
be the mapping
α(x) = {N ∈X∗: x ∈N}.
(Note that α(x) is indeed an ultraﬁlter of X∗). If
x, y ∈X
and
x ̸= y
then
α(x) ̸= α(y)
as X is Hausdorﬀand has a basis of clopen subsets. If U is an ultraﬁlter of X∗then U is
a family of closed subsets of X with the ﬁnite intersection property, so as X is compact we
must have
\
U ̸= ∅.
It easily follows that for x ∈T U,
U ⊆α(x);
thus
U = α(x)
by the maximality of U. Thus α is a bijection.
A clopen subset of X∗∗looks like
{U ∈X∗∗: N ∈U}
for N ∈X∗, i.e., for N a clopen subset of X. Now
α(N) = {U ∈X∗∗: α(x) = U for some x ∈N}
= {U ∈X∗∗: N ∈U},
so α is an open map. Also
α−1{U ∈X∗∗: N ∈U} = {x ∈X : α(x) ∈{U ∈X∗∗: N ∈U}}
= {x ∈X : x ∈N}
= N,

156

so α is continuous. Thus α is the desired homeomorphism.

Deﬁnition 4.7. Given two disjoint topological spaces, X1, X2, deﬁne the union of X1, X2
to be the topological space whose underlying set is X1∪X2 and whose open sets are precisely
the subsets of the form O1 ∪O2 there Oi is open in Xi.
Given two topological spaces X1, X2, let
X1 ·∪X2
denote the topological space whose underlying set is
{1} × X1 ∪{2} × X2
and whose open subsets are precisely the subsets of the form
{1} × O1 ∪{2} × O2
where Oi is open in Xi, i = 1, 2. X1 ·∪X2 is called the disjointed union of X1, X2.
The next result is used in the next section.
Lemma 4.8. Given two Boolean algebras B1 and B2, the Boolean spaces (B1 × B2)∗and
B∗
1 ·∪B∗
2 are homeomorphic.
Proof. The case that |B1| = |B2| = 1 is trivial, so we assume |B1 × B2| ≥2. Given an
ultraﬁlter U in (B1 ×B2)∗, let πi(U) be the image of U under the projection homomorphism
πi : B1 × B2 →Bi.
Claim: U = π1(U) × B2 or U = B1 × π2(U).
To see this, note that
⟨1, 0⟩∨⟨0, 1⟩= ⟨1, 1⟩∈U
implies
⟨1, 0⟩∈U
or
⟨0, 1⟩∈U.
If ⟨1, 0⟩∈U, then
⟨b1, b2⟩∈U ⇒⟨b1, 0⟩= ⟨b1, b2⟩∧⟨1, 0⟩∈U;
hence
π1(U) × {0} ⊆U,
so
π1(U) × B2 ⊆U.
As
U ⊆π1(U) × π2(U)

§4. Stone Duality
157
we have
U = π1(U) × B2.
Likewise we handle the case ⟨0, 1⟩∈U. This ﬁnishes the proof of the claim.
From the claim it is easy to verify that either π1(U) or π2(U) is a ﬁlter, and then an
ultraﬁlter. So let us deﬁne the map
β : (B1 × B2)∗→B∗
1 ·∪B∗
2
by
β(U) = {i} × πi(U)
for i such that πi(U) is an ultraﬁlter of Bi. The map β is easily seen to be injective in view
of the claim. If U ∈B∗
1 then U × B2 ∈(B1 × B2)∗, so
β(U × B2) = {1} × U,
and a similar argument for U ∈B∗
2 shows β is also surjective. Finally, we have
β(N⟨b1,b2⟩) = {β(U) : U ∈(B1 × B2)∗, ⟨b1, b2⟩∈U}
= {β(U) : U ∈(B1 × B2)∗, ⟨b1, 0⟩∈U or ⟨0, b2⟩∈U}
= {β(U) : U ∈(B1 × B2)∗, b1 ∈π1(U) or b2 ∈π2(U)}
= {1} × Nb1 ∪{2} × Nb2.

§5.
Boolean Powers
The Boolean power construction goes back at least to a paper of Arens and Kaplansky in
1948, and it has parallels in earlier work of Gelfand. Arens and Kaplansky were concerned
with rings, and in 1953 Foster generalized Boolean powers to arbitrary algebras. This con-
struction provides a method for translating numerous fascinating properties of Boolean alge-
bras into other varieties, and, as we shall see in §7, provides basic representation theorems.
Deﬁnition 5.1. If B is a Boolean algebra and A an arbitrary algebra, let A[B]∗be the set
of continuous functions from B∗to A, giving A the discrete topology.
Lemma 5.2. If we are given A, B as in 5.1, A[B]∗is a subuniverse of AX, where X = B∗.
Proof.
Let c1, . . . , cn ∈A[B]∗. As X is compact, each ci has a ﬁnite range, and, for
a ∈A, c−1
i (a) is a clopen subset of X. Thus we can visualize a typical member of A[B]∗as
in Figure 28, namely a step function with ﬁnitely many steps, each step occurring over a
clopen subset of X. If A is of type F and f ∈Fn then if we choose clopen subsets N1, . . ., Nk
which partition X such that each ci is constant on each Nj, i = 1, . . ., n, j = 1, . . ., k, it is
clear that f(c1, . . . , cn) is constant on each Nj. Consequently, f(c1, . . . , cn) ∈A[B]∗.

Deﬁnition 5.3. Given A, B as in 5.1, let A[B]∗denote the subalgebra of AX, X = B∗,
with universe A[B]∗. A[B]∗is called the (bounded) Boolean power of A by B. (Note that
A[1]∗is a trivial algebra.)
Theorem 5.4. The following results hold for Boolean powers:

160
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
(a) A[B]∗is a subdirect power of A.
(b) A can be embedded in A[B]∗if B is not trivial.
(c) A[2]∗∼= A.
(d) A[B1 × B2]∗∼= A[B1]∗× A[B2]∗.
(e) (A1 × A2)[B]∗∼= A1[B]∗× A2[B]∗.
Proof. For (a) and (b) note that the constant functions of AX are in A[B]∗. (c) follows from
noting that 2∗is a one-element space, so the only functions in AX are constant functions.
Let C(X, A) denote the set of continuous functions from X to A, for X a Boolean space,
and let C(X, A) denote the subalgebra of AX with universe C(X, A). Given two disjoint
Boolean spaces X1, X2 deﬁne
α : C(X1 ∪X2, A) →C(X1, A) × C(X2, A)
by
αc = ⟨c↾X1, c↾X2⟩.
As X1, X2 are clopen in X1 ∪X2 it is not diﬃcult to see that α is a bijection, and if
c1, . . . , cn ∈C(X1 ∪X2, A) and f is a fundamental operation of arity n, then
αf(c1, . . . , cn) = ⟨f(c1, . . . , cn)↾X1, f(c1, . . . , cn)↾X2⟩
= ⟨f(c1↾X1, . . . , cn↾X1), f(c1↾X2, . . . , cn↾X2)⟩
= f(⟨c1↾X1, c1↾X2⟩, . . ., ⟨cn↾X1, cn↾X2⟩)
= f(αc1, . . ., αcn),
so α is an isomorphism. As
A[B]∗= C(B∗, A)
it follows from 4.8 that
A[B1 × B2]∗∼= A[B1]∗× A[B2]∗.
This proves (d).
Next deﬁne
α : A1[B]∗× A2[B]∗→(A1 × A2)[B]∗
by
α(⟨c1, c2⟩)(x) = ⟨c1x, c2x⟩.
Clearly this is a well-deﬁned injective map. If c ∈(A1×A2)[B]∗let N1, . . . , Nk be a partition
of B∗into clopen subsets such that c is constant on each Nj. Then let
ci(x) = (πic)(x),
i = 1, 2. Then ci ∈Ai[B]∗as ci is constant on each Nj, and
α(⟨c1, c2⟩) = c,

§5. Boolean Powers
161
so α is surjective. If ⟨cj
1, cj
2⟩∈A1[B]∗× A2[B]∗, 1 ≤j ≤n, and if f is a fundamental n-ary
operation then
αf(⟨c1
1, c1
2⟩, . . ., ⟨cn
1, cn
2⟩)(x) = α(⟨f(c1
1, . . . , cn

= ⟨f(c1
1, . . ., cn

2, . . . , cn
2)(x)⟩
= ⟨f(c1
1x, . . . , cn
1x), f(c1
2x, . . . , cn
2x)⟩
= f(⟨c1
1x, c1
2x⟩, . . . , ⟨cn
1x, cn
2x⟩)
= f(α(⟨c1
1, c1
2⟩)(x), . . . , α(⟨cn
1, cn
2⟩)(x))
= f(α⟨c1
1, c1
2⟩, . . . , α⟨cn
1, cn
2⟩)(x);
hence
αf(⟨c1
1, c1
2⟩, . . . , ⟨cn
1, cn
2⟩) = f(α⟨c1
1, c1
2⟩, . . . , α⟨cn
1, cn
2⟩).
This proves
A1[B]∗× A2[B]∗∼= (A1 × A2)[B]∗
as α is an isomorphism.

The next result is used in §7, and provides the springboard for the generalization of
Boolean powers given in §8.
Deﬁnition 5.5. If a, b ∈Q
i∈I Ai the equalizer of a and b is
[[a = b]] = {i ∈I : a(i) = b(i)};
and if J1, . . . , Jn partition I and a1, . . . , an ∈Q
i∈I Ai then
a1↾J1 ∪· · · ∪an↾Jn
denotes the function a where
a(i) = ak(i)
if
i ∈Jk.
Theorem 5.6. Let B be a Boolean algebra and A any algebra. With X = B∗, a subset S
of AX is A[B]∗iﬀS satisﬁes
(a) the constant functions of AX are in S,
(b) for c1, c2 ∈S, [[c1 = c2]] is a clopen subset of X, and
(c) for c1, c2 ∈S and N a clopen subset of X,
c1↾N ∪c2↾X−N∈S.
Proof. (⇒) We have already noted that the constant functions are in A[B]∗. For part (b)
note that c ∈A[B]∗implies c−1(a) is clopen for a ∈A as c is continuous. Also as c has ﬁnite
range,

c = c1↾N ∪c2↾X−N
is in A[B]∗as
c−1(a) = (c−1
1 (a) ∩N) ∪(c−1
2 (a) ∩(X −N)),
a clopen subset of X for a ∈A.
(⇐) For a ∈A let ca ∈AX be the constant function with value a. From (b) we have, for
c ∈S,
c−1(a) = [[c = ca]],
a clopen subset of X; hence c is continuous, so c ∈A[B]∗. Finally, if c ∈A[B]∗let
Na = [[c = ca]]
for a ∈A. Then
c =

a∈A
ca↾Na,
so by (c), c ∈S.

§6.
Ultraproducts and Congruence-distributive
Varieties
One of the most popular constructions, ﬁrst introduced by  Lo´s (pronounced “wash”) in
1955, is the ultraproduct. We will make good use of it in both this and the next chapter.
The main result in this section is a new description due to J´onsson, using ultraproducts, of
congruence-distributive varieties generated by a class K.
Deﬁnition 6.1. For any set I, members of Su(I)∗are called ultraﬁlters over I. Let Ai, i ∈I,
be a family of algebras of a given type, and let U be an ultraﬁlter over I. Deﬁne θU on Q
i∈I Ai
by
⟨a, b⟩∈θU
iﬀ
[[a = b]] ∈U,
where [[a = b]] is as deﬁned in 5.5.
Lemma 6.2. With Ai, i ∈I, and U as above, θU is a congruence on Q
i∈I Ai.
Proof. Obviously, θU is reﬂexive and symmetric. If
⟨a, b⟩∈θU
and
⟨b, c⟩∈θU
then
[[a = c]] ⊇[[a = b]] ∩[[b = c]]
implies
[[a = c]] ∈U,
so
⟨a, c⟩∈θU.
If
⟨a1, b1⟩, . . . , ⟨an, bn⟩∈θU
and f is a fundamental n-ary operation then
[[f(a1, . . . , an) = f(b1, . . . , bn]] ⊇[[a1 = b1]] ∩· · · ∩[[an = bn]]

164
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
implies
⟨f(a1, . . ., an), f(b1, . . . , bn)⟩∈θU.
Thus θU is a congruence.

Deﬁnition 6.3. With Ai, i ∈I, and U an ultraﬁlter over I, we deﬁne the ultraproduct
Y
i∈I
Ai/U
to be
Y
i∈I
Ai/θU.
The elements of Q
i∈I Ai/U are denoted by a/U, where a ∈Q
i∈I Ai.
Lemma 6.4. For a/U, b/U in an ultraproduct Q
i∈I Ai/U, we have
a/U = b/U
iﬀ
[[a = b]] ∈U.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the deﬁnition.

Lemma 6.5. If {Ai : i ∈I} is a ﬁnite set of ﬁnite algebras, say {B1, . . . , Bk}, (I can be
inﬁnite), and U is an ultraﬁlter over I, then Q
i∈I Ai/U is isomorphic to one of the algebras
B1, . . . , Bk, namely to that Bj such that
{i ∈I : Ai = Bj} ∈U.
Proof. Let
Sj = {i ∈I : Ai = Bj}.
Then
I = S1 ∪· · · ∪Sm
implies (by 3.13) that for some j,
Sj ∈U.
Let Bj = {b1, . . . , bk}, where the b’s are all distinct, and choose a1, . . . , ak ∈Q
i∈I Ai such
that
a1(i) = b1, . . . , ak(i) = bk
if i ∈Sj. Then if we are given a ∈Q
i∈I Ai,
[[a = a1]] ∪· · · ∪[[a = ak]] ⊇Sj,

§6. Ultraproducts and Congruence-distributive Varieties
165
so
[[a = a1]] ∈U or . . . or [[a = ak]] ∈U;
hence
a/U = a1/U
or
. . .
or a/U = ak/U.
Also it should be evident that a1/U, . . . , ak/U are all distinct. Thus Q
i∈I Ai/U has exactly
k elements, a1/U, . . . , ak/U. Now for f a fundamental n-ary operation and for
{bi1, . . . , bin, bin+1} ⊆{b1, . . . , bk}
with
f(bi1, . . . , bin) = bin+1,
we have
[[f(ai1, . . . , ain) = ain+1]] ⊇Sj;
hence
f(ai1/U, . . . , ain/U) = ain+1/U.
Thus the map
α :
Y
i∈I
Ai/U →Bj
deﬁned by
α(at/U) = bt,
1 ≤t ≤k, is an isomorphism.

Lemma 6.6 (J´onsson). Let W be a family of subsets of I(̸= ∅) such that
(i) I ∈W,
(ii) if J ∈W and J ⊆K ⊆I then K ∈W, and
(iii) if J1 ∪J2 ∈W then J1 ∈W or J2 ∈W. Then there is an ultraﬁlter U over I with
U ⊆W.
Proof. If ∅∈W then W = Su(I), so any ultraﬁlter will do. If ∅̸∈W, then Su(I) −W is
a proper ideal; extend it to a maximal ideal and take the complementary ultraﬁlter.

Deﬁnition 6.7. We denote the class of ultraproducts of members of K by PU(K).
Theorem 6.8 (J´onsson). Let V (K) be a congruence-distributive variety. If A is a subdirectly
irreducible algebra in V (K), then
A ∈HSPU(K);

166
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
hence
V (K) = IPSHSPU(K).
Proof. Suppose A is a nontrivial subdirectly irreducible algebra in V (K). Then for some
choice of Ai ∈K, i ∈I, and for some B ≤Q
i∈I Ai there is a surjective homomorphism
α : B →A,
as V (K) = HSP(K). Let
θ = ker α.
For J ⊆I let
θJ =


⟨a, b⟩∈
 Y
i∈I
Ai
!2
: J ⊆[[a = b]]


.
One easily veriﬁes that θJ is a congruence on Q
i∈I Ai. Let
θJ↾B = θJ ∩B2
be the restriction of θJ to B, and deﬁne W to be
{J ⊆I : θJ↾B ⊆θ}.
Clearly
I ∈W,
∅̸∈W
and if
J ∈W
and
J ⊆K ⊆I
then
θK↾B ⊆θ,
as
θK↾B ⊆θJ ↾B .
Now suppose
J1 ∪J2 ∈W,
i.e.,
θJ1∪J2↾B ⊆θ.
As
θJ1∪J2 = θJ1 ∩θJ2,
it follows that
(θJ1∪J2)↾B = θJ1↾B ∩θJ2↾B .

§6. Ultraproducts and Congruence-distributive Varieties
167
Since
θ = θ ∨(θJ1↾B ∩θJ2↾B)
it follows that
θ = (θ ∨θJ1↾B) ∩(θ ∨θJ2↾B)
by distributivity, and as Theorem II§6.20 gives
Con B/θ ∼= [[[θ, ∇]]]
≤Con/B
we must have from the fact that B/θ is subdirectly irreducible (it is isomorphic to A)
θ = θ ∨θJi↾B
for i = 1 or 2; hence
θJi↾B ⊆θ
for i = 1 or 2, so either J1 or J2 is in W. By 6.6, there is an ultraﬁlter U contained in W.
From the deﬁnition of W we have
θU ↾B ⊆θ
as
θU =
[
{θJ : J ∈U}.
Let ν be the natural homomorphism from Q
i∈I Ai to Q
i∈I Ai/U. Then let
β : B →ν(B)
be the restriction of ν to B. As
ker β = θU ↾B
⊆θ
we have
A ∼= B/θ
∼= (B/ ker β)/(θ/ ker β).
Now
B/ ker β ∼= ν(B) ≤
Y
i∈I
Ai/U
so
B/ ker β ∈ISPU(K);
hence
A ∈HSPU(K).

168
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
As every algebra in V (K) is isomorphic to a subdirect product of subdirectly irreducible
algebras, we have
V (K) = IPSHSPU(K).

One part of the previous proof has found so many applications that we isolate it in the
following.
Corollary 6.9 (J´onsson’s Lemma). If V is a congruence-distributive variety and Ai ∈V, i ∈
I, if B ≤Q
i∈I Ai, and θ ∈Con B is such that B/θ is a nontrivial subdirectly irreducible
algebra, then there is an ultraﬁlter U over I such that
θU ↾B ⊆θ
where θU is the congruence on Q
i∈I Ai deﬁned by
⟨a, b⟩∈θU
iﬀ
[[a = b]] ∈U.
Corollary 6.10 (J´onsson). If K is a ﬁnite set of ﬁnite algebras and V (K) is congruence-
distributive, then the subdirectly irreducible algebras of V (K) are in
HS(K),
and
V (K) = IPS(HS(K)).
Proof. By 6.5, PU(K) ⊆I(K), so just apply 6.8.

Primal Algebras
When Rosenbloom presented his study of the variety of n-valued Post algebras in 1942, he
proved that all ﬁnite members were isomorphic to direct powers of Pn (see II§1), just as in the
case of Boolean algebras. However, he thought that an analysis of the inﬁnite members would
prove to be far more complex than the corresponding study of inﬁnite Boolean algebras. Then
in 1953 Foster proved that every n-valued Post algebra was just a Boolean power of Pn.
Deﬁnition 7.1. If A is an algebra and
f : An →A
is an n-ary function on A, then f is representable by a term if there is a term p such that
f(a1, . . . , an) = pA(a1, . . . , an)
for a1, . . ., an ∈A.
Deﬁnition 7.2. A ﬁnite algebra A is primal if every n-ary function on A, for every n ≥1,
is representable by a term.
In §10 we will give an easy test for primality, and show that the Post algebras Pn are
primal. However, one can give a direct proof. A key tool here and in later sections is the
switching function.

170
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
Deﬁnition 7.3. The function
s : A4 →A
on a set A deﬁned by
s(a, b, c, d) =
(
c
if a = b
d
if a ̸= b
is called the switching function on A. A term s(x, y, u, v) representing the switching function
on an algebra A is called a switching term for A.
Theorem 7.4 (Foster). Let P be a primal algebra. Then
V (P) = I{P[B]∗: B is a Boolean algebra}.
Proof. We only need to consider nontrivial P. If E is an equivalence relation on P and
⟨a, b⟩̸∈E,
⟨c, d⟩∈E
with c ̸= d, then choose a term p(x) such that
p(c) = a,
p(d) = b.
Thus
E ̸∈Con(P);
hence P is simple. Also the only subalgebra of P is itself (as P is the only subset of P closed
under all functions on P). As P has a majority term, it follows that V (P) is congruence-
distributive, so by 6.8 and the above remarks
V (P) = IPSHSPU(P)
= IPS(P) ∪{trivial algebras}.
Thus we only need to show every subdirect power of P is isomorphic to a Boolean power of
P. Let
A ≤PI
be a nontrivial subdirect power of P. Recall that for p1, p2 ∈P I we let
[[p1 = p2]] = {i ∈I : p1(i) = p2(i)}.
In the following we will let s(x, y, u, v) be a term which represents the switching function on
P.

§7. Primal Algebras
171
Claim i. The constant functions of P I are in A.
This follows from noting that every constant function on P is represented by a term.
Claim ii. The subsets [[a1 = a2]], for a1, a2 ∈A, of I form a subuniverse of the Boolean
algebra Su(I).
Let c1, c2 be two elements of A with
[[c1 = c2]] = ∅
(such must exist as we have assumed P is nontrivial). Then for a1, a2, b1, b2 ∈A the following
observations suﬃce:
I = [[c1 = c1]]
[[a1 = a2]] ∪[[b1 = b2]] = [[s(a1, a2, b1, b2) = b1]]
[[a1 = a2]] ∩[[b1 = b2]] = [[s(a1, a2, b1, a1) = s(a1, a2, b2, a2)]]
I −[[a1 = a2]] = [[s(a1, a2, c1, c2) = c2]].
Let B be the subalgebra of Su(I) with the universe
{[[a1 = a2]] : a1, a2 ∈A},
and let
X = B∗.
Claim iii. For a ∈A and U ∈X there is exactly one p ∈P such that a−1(p) ∈U.
Since P is ﬁnite this is the an easy consequence of the facts
[
p∈P
a−1(p) = I ∈U,
U is an ultraﬁlter, and the a−1(p)’s are pairwise disjoint.
So let us deﬁne σ : A × X →P by
σ(a, U) = p
iﬀ
a−1(p) ∈U.
Then let us deﬁne α : A →P X by
(αa)(U) = σ(a, U).
Clearly all the constant functions of P X are in αA (just look at the images of the constant
functions in A).

Claim iv. For a, b ∈A, [[αa = αb]] = {U ∈X : [[a = b]] ∈U}.
To see this we have
[[αa = αb]] = {U ∈X : (αa)(U) = (αb)(U)}
= {U ∈X : σ(a, U) = σ(b, U)}
= {U ∈X : a−1(p) ∈U, b−1(p) ∈U for some p ∈P}
= {U ∈X : [[a = b]] ∈U}
(why?).
Thus a typical clopen subset of X is of the form [[αa = αb]].
Next for a1, a2 ∈A and N a clopen subset of X, choose b1, b2 ∈A with
N = {U ∈X : [[b1 = b2]] ∈U}.
Let
a = a1↾M ∪a2↾I−M
where
M = [[b1 = b2]].
Then
a ∈A
as
a = s(b1, b2, a1, a2).
Now
[[αa = αa1]] = {U ∈X : [[a = a1]] ∈U}
⊇{U ∈X : M ∈U}
= N,
and
[[αa = αa2]] = {U ∈X : [[a = a2]] ∈U}
⊇{U ∈X : I −M ∈U}
= X −N;
hence
αa = αa1↾N ∪αa2↾X−N .
Then by 5.6 we see that
α(A) = P[B]∗.

§7. Primal Algebras
173
The map α is actually a bijection, for if a1, a2 ∈A with
a1 ̸= a2
then choosing, by 3.15(b), U ∈X with
[[a1 = a2]] ̸∈U,
we have
(αa1)(U) ̸= (αa2)(U).
Finally, to see that α is an isomorphism, let a1, . . . , an ∈A, and suppose f is an n-ary
function symbol. Then for U ∈X and p such that
σ(f(a1, . . ., an), U) = p
we can use
f(a1, . . . , an)−1(p) =
[
pi∈P
f(p1,...,pn)=p
a−1
1 (p1) ∩· · · ∩a−1
n (pn)
and
f(a1, . . ., an)−1(p) ∈U
to show that, for some choice of p1, . . . , pn with f(p1, . . . , pn) = p,
a−1
1 (p1) ∩· · · ∩a−1
n (pn) ∈U.
Hence
a−1
i (pi) ∈U,
1 ≤i ≤n,
and thus
σ(ai, U) = pi,
1 ≤i ≤n.
Consequently,
α(f(a1, . . . , an))(U) = σ(f(a1, . . . , an), U)
= p
= f(p1, . . . , pn)
= f(σ(a1, U), . . . , σ(an, U))
= f((αa1)(U), . . . , (αan)(U))
= f(αa1, . . . , αan)(U),
so
αf(a1, . . . , an) = f(αa1, . . ., αan).

Boolean Products
Boolean products provide an eﬀective generalization of the notion of Boolean power. Actually
the construction that we call “Boolean product” has been known for several years as “the
algebras of global sections of sheaves of algebras over Boolean spaces”; however, the deﬁnition
of the latter was unnecessarily involved.
Deﬁnition 8.1. A Boolean product of an indexed family (Ax)x∈X, X ̸= ∅, of algebras is a
subdirect product A ≤Q
x∈X Ax, where X can be endowed with a Boolean space topology
so that
(i) [[a = b]] is clopen for a, b ∈A, and

§8. Boolean Products
175
(ii) if a, b ∈A and N is a clopen subset of X, then
a↾N ∪b↾X−N ∈A.
We refer to condition (i) as “equalizers are clopen”, and to condition (ii) as “the patchwork
property” (draw a picture!). For a class of algebras K, let Γa(K) denote the class of Boolean
products which can be formed from nonempty subsets of K. Thus Γa(K) ⊆PS(K).
Our deﬁnition of Boolean product is indeed very close to the description of Boolean
powers given in 5.6. In this section we will develop a technique for establishing the existence
of Boolean product representations, and apply it to biregular rings. But ﬁrst we need to
develop some lattice-theoretic notions and results.
Deﬁnition 8.2. Let L be a lattice. An ideal I of L is a nonempty subset of L such that
(i) a ∈I, b ∈L, and b ≤a ⇒b ∈I,
(ii) a, b ∈I ⇒a ∨b ∈I.
I is proper if I ̸= L, and I is maximal if I is maximal among the proper ideals of L. Similarly
we deﬁne ﬁlters, proper ﬁlters, and maximal ﬁlters of L.
Parallel to 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9 we have (using the same proofs) the following.
Lemma 8.3.
The set of ideals and the set of ﬁlters of a lattice are closed under ﬁnite
intersection, and arbitrary intersection provided the intersection is not empty.
Deﬁnition 8.4. Given a lattice L and a nonempty set X ⊆L, let I(X) denote the least
ideal of L containing X, called the ideal generated by X, and let F(X) denote the least ﬁlter
of L containing X, called the ﬁlter generated by X.
Lemma 8.5. For a lattice L and X ⊆L we have
I(X) = {a ∈L : a ≤a1 ∨· · · ∨an for some a1, . . . , an ∈X}
F(X) = {a ∈L : a ≥a1 ∧· · · ∧an for some a1, . . . , an ∈X}.
In particular if J is an ideal of L and b ∈L, then
I(J ∪{b}) = {a ∈L : a ≤j ∨b for some j ∈J}.
Deﬁnition 8.6. A lattice L is said to be relatively complemented if for
a ≤b ≤c

176
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
in L there exists d ∈L with
b ∧d = a,
b ∨d = c.
d is called a relative complement of b in the interval [a, c].
Lemma 8.7. Suppose L is a relatively complemented distributive lattice with I an ideal of
L and a ∈L −I. Then there is a maximal ideal M of L with
I ⊆M,
a ̸∈M.
Furthermore, L −M is a maximal ﬁlter of L. The same results hold interchanging the words
ideal and ﬁlter.
Proof. Use Zorn’s lemma to extend I to an ideal M which is maximal among the ideals of
L containing I, but to which a does not belong. It only remains to show that M is actually
a maximal ideal of L. For b1, b2 ̸∈M we have
a ∈I(M ∪{bi}),
i = 1, 2;
hence for some ci ∈M, i = 1, 2,
a ≤b1 ∨c1,
a ≤b2 ∨c2.
Hence
a ≤(b1 ∨c1) ∧(b2 ∨c2)
= (b1 ∧b2) ∨[(b1 ∧c2) ∨(c1 ∧b2) ∨(c1 ∧c2)].
As the element in brackets is in M, we must have
b1 ∧b2 ̸∈M
as a ̸∈M. Thus it is easily seen that L −M is a ﬁlter. Now given b1, b2 ̸∈M, choose c ∈M
with
c ≤b1.
Then let d1 ∈L be such that
b1 ∨d1 = b1 ∨b2,
b1 ∧d1 = c,

§8. Boolean Products
177
i.e., d1 is a relative complement of b1 in the interval [c, b1 ∨b2]. As L −M is a ﬁlter and
c ̸∈L −M, it follows that d1 ∈M. But then
b2 ≤b1 ∨d1
says
b2 ∈I(M ∪{b1});
hence
L = I(M ∪{b1}).
Consequently M is a maximal ideal.

Lemma 8.8. In a distributive lattice relative complements are unique if they exist.
Proof. Suppose L is a distributive lattice and
a ≤b ≤c
in L. If d1 and d2 are relative complements of b in the interval [a, c], then
d1 = d1 ∧c
= d1 ∧(b ∨d2)
= (d1 ∧b) ∨(d1 ∧d2)
= d1 ∧d2.
Likewise
d2 = d1 ∧d2,
so
d1 = d2.

Deﬁnition 8.9. If L is a relatively complemented distributive lattice with a least element
0 and a, b ∈L, then a\b denotes the relative complement of b in the interval [0, a ∨b].
Lemma 8.10. If L is a distributive lattice with a least element 0 such that for a, b ∈L the
relative complement (denoted a\b) of b in the interval [0, a ∨b] exists, then L is relatively
complemented.
Proof. Let
a ≤b ≤c
hold in L. Let
d = a ∨(c\b).

178
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
Then
b ∨d = b ∨(c\b) = c,
and
b ∧d = b ∧[a ∨(c\b)]
= a ∨[b ∧(c\b)]
= a,
so d is a relative complement of b in [a, c].

Now we have all the facts we need about relatively complemented distributive lattices,
so let us apply them to the study of Boolean products.
Deﬁnition 8.11. If A is an algebra, then an embedding
α : A →
Y
x∈X
Ax
gives a Boolean product representation of A if α(A) is a Boolean product of the Ax’s.
Theorem 8.12. Let A be an algebra. Suppose L is a sublattice of Con A such that
(i) ∆∈L,
(ii) the congruences in L permute,
(iii) L is a relatively complemented distributive lattice, and
(iv) for each a, b ∈A there is a smallest member θab of L with ⟨a, b⟩∈θab.
Let
X = {M : M is a maximal ideal of L} ∪{L},
and introduce a topology on X with a subbasis
{Nθ : θ ∈L} ∪{Dθ : θ ∈L}
where
Nθ = {M ∈X : θ ∈M},
and
Dθ = {M ∈X : θ ̸∈M}.
Then X is a Boolean space, S M is a congruence for each M ∈X, and the map
α : A →
Y
M∈X
(A/

deﬁned by
(αa)(M) = a/
[
M
gives a Boolean product representation of A such that
[[αa = αb]] = Nθab.
Consequently,
A ∈IΓa({A/
[
M : M ∈X}).
Proof.
Claim i. The subbasis
{Nθ : θ ∈L} ∪{Dθ : θ ∈L}
is a ﬁeld of subsets of X, hence a basis for the topology. In particular,
(a) X = N∆, ∅= D∆,
and for θ, φ ∈L,
(b) Nθ ∪Nφ = Nθ∩φ,
(c) Nθ ∩Nφ = Nθ∨φ,
(d) Dθ ∪Dφ = Dθ∨φ,
(e) Dθ ∩Dφ = Dθ∩φ,
(f) Nθ ∪Dφ = Nθ\φ,
(g) Nθ ∩Dφ = Dφ\θ,
and
(h) X = Nθ ∪Dθ, ∅= Nθ ∩Dθ.
Proof. (a) Clearly
X = N∆,
∅= D∆.
The proofs below make frequent use of the fact that L −M is a ﬁlter of L if M ∈X −{L}.
(b)
M ∈Nθ ∪Nφ iﬀθ ∈M
or
φ ∈M
iﬀθ ∩φ ∈M
iﬀM ∈Nθ∩φ.
One handles (c) similarly.
(d)
M ∈Dθ ∪Dφ iﬀθ ̸∈M
or
φ ̸∈M
iﬀθ ∨φ ̸∈M
iﬀM ∈Dθ∨φ.
One handles (e) similarly.

180
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
(f) From the statements
φ ∩(θ\φ) = ∆
θ\φ ⊆θ
θ ⊆θ ∨φ = φ ∨(θ\φ)
it follows, for M ∈X, that
φ ∈M
or
θ\φ ∈M
θ ̸∈M
or
θ\φ ∈M
φ ̸∈M
or
θ\φ ̸∈M
or
θ ∈M.
The ﬁrst two give
θ\φ ̸∈M ⇒θ ̸∈M and φ ∈M
and from the third
θ\φ ∈M ⇒θ ∈M or φ ̸∈M.
Thus
θ\φ ∈M ⇔θ ∈M or φ ̸∈M.
(g) This is an immediate consequence of (f).
(h) (These assertions are obvious.)
Thus we have a ﬁeld of subsets of X.

Claim ii. X is a Boolean space.
Proof. If M1, M2 ∈X and M1 ̸= M2, then without loss of generality let θ ∈M1 −M2.
Then
M1 ∈Nθ,
M2 ∈Dθ,
so X is Hausdorﬀ. From claim (i) we have a basis of clopen subsets. So we only need to
show X is compact. Suppose
X =
[
i∈I
Nθi ∪
[
j∈J
Dφj.
As L ∈X it follows that I ̸= ∅, say i0 ∈I. Let
Dθ′
i = Nθi ∩Dθi0
and
Dφ′
j = Dφj ∩Dθi0.

§8. Boolean Products
181
Then
Dθi0 = X ∩Dθi0
=
[
i∈I
Dθ′
i ∪
[
j∈J
Dφ′
j.
If the ideal of L generated by
{θ′
i : i ∈I} ∪{φ′
j : j ∈J}
does not contain θi0, then it can be extended to a maximal ideal M of L such that θi0 ̸∈M.
But then
M ∈Dθi0 −
 [
i∈I
Dθi ∪
[
j∈J
Dφ′

which is impossible. Thus by 8.5 for some ﬁnite subsets I0 (of I) and J0 (of J) we have
θi0 ≤
_
i∈I0
θ′
i ∨
_
j∈J0
φ′
j;
hence, by claim (i),
Dθi0 ⊆
[
i∈I0
D′
θi ∪
[
j∈J0
Dφ′
j.
As
Dθ′
i ⊆Nθi,
Dφ′
j ⊆Dφj
we have
X = Nθi0 ∪Dθi0
= Nθi0 ∪
[
i∈I0
Nθi ∪
[
j∈J0
Dφj,
so X is compact.

Claim iii. α gives a Boolean product representation of A.
Proof. Certainly α is a homomorphism. If a ̸= b in A, then
{θ ∈L : ⟨a, b⟩∈θ}
is a proper ﬁlter of L. Extend this to a maximal ﬁlter F of L, and let
M = L −F,

182
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
a maximal ideal of L. Thus
⟨a, b⟩̸∈
[
M
as
⟨a, b⟩̸∈θ
for θ ∈M. From this follows
\
M∈X
(
[
M) = ∆,
so αA is a subdirect product of the A/ SM by II§8.2.
For a, b ∈A we have
[[αa = αb]] = {M ∈X; ⟨a, b⟩∈
[
M}
= {M ∈X : θab ∈M}
= Nθab,
so equalizers are clopen.
Next given a, b ∈A and θ ∈L we want to show
(αa)↾Nθ ∪(αb)↾X−Nθ ∈αA.
Choose φ ∈L such that
⟨a, b⟩∈φ.
Then
⟨a, b⟩∈θ ∨φ = θ ∨(φ\θ),
so by the permutability of members of L there is a c ∈A with
⟨a, c⟩∈θ,
⟨c, b⟩∈φ\θ.
As
[[αa = αc]] = Nθac
⊇Nθ
and
[[αc = αb]] = Nθcb
⊇Nφ\θ
= Nφ ∪Dθ
⊇Dθ

§8. Boolean Products
183
we have
αc = αa↾Nθ ∪αb↾Dθ,
so αA has the patchwork property.

Deﬁnition 8.13. Given A let
Spec A = {φ ∈Con A : φ is a maximal congruence on A} ∪{∇},
and let the topology on Spec A be generated by
{E(a, b)|a, b ∈A} ∪{D(a, b)|a, b ∈A},
where
E(a, b) = {φ ∈Spec A : ⟨a, b⟩∈φ},
D(a, b) = {φ ∈Spec A : ⟨a, b⟩̸∈φ}.
Corollary 8.14. Let A be an algebra such that the ﬁnitely generated congruences permute
and form a sublattice L of Con A which is distributive and relatively complemented. Then
the natural map
β : A →
Y
θ∈Spec A
A/θ
gives a Boolean product representation of A, and for a, b ∈A,
[[βa = βb]] = E(a, b).
Proof. Let M ∈X, X as deﬁned in 8.12. If
M = L
then
[
M = ∇∈Spec A.
If
M ̸= L,
then for some a, b ∈A,
Θ(a, b) ̸∈M,
so
⟨a, b⟩̸∈
[
M.

184
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
If S M is not maximal then, for some θ ∈Con A,
[
M ⊆θ ̸= ∇
and
[
M ̸= θ.
But
θ =
[
{φ ∈L : φ ⊆θ},
so
I = {φ ∈L : φ ⊆θ}
is a proper ideal of L such that M ⊆I but M ̸= I. This contradicts the maximality of M.
Hence M ∈X implies
[
M ∈Spec A.
If M1, M2 ∈X with
M1 ̸= M2,
then it is readily veriﬁable that
[
M1 ̸=
[
M2.
And for θ ∈Spec A, clearly
{φ ∈L : φ ⊆θ}
is in X. Thus the map
σ : X →Spec A
deﬁned by
σM =
[
M
is a bijection. For a, b ∈A note that
σ(NΘ(a,b)) = σ{M ∈X : Θ(a, b) ∈M}
= {
[
M : M ∈X, ⟨a, b⟩∈
[
M}
= {θ ∈Spec A : ⟨a, b⟩∈θ}
= E(a, b);
hence σ is a homeomorphism from X to Spec A. Thus
β : A →
Y
θ∈Spec A
A/θ

§8. Boolean Products

gives a Boolean product representation of A where
[[βa = βb]] = E(a, b).

Example (Dauns and Hofmann). A ring R is biregular if every principal ideal is generated
by a central idempotent (we only consider two-sided ideals). For r ∈R let I(r) denote the
ideal of R generated by r. If a and b are central idempotents of R, it is a simple exercise to
verify
I(a) ∨I(b) = I(a + b −ab)
and
I(a) ∧I(b) = I(ab).
Thus, for R biregular, all ﬁnitely generated ideals are principal, and they form a sublattice of
the lattice of all ideals of R. From the above equalities one can readily check the distributive
laws, and ﬁnally
I(b)\I(a) = I(b −ab),
i.e., the ﬁnitely generated ideals of R form a relatively complemented distributive sublattice
of the lattice of ideals of R; and of course all rings have permutable congruences. Thus by
8.14, R is isomorphic to a Boolean product of simple rings and a trivial ring. (A lemma of
Arens and Kaplansky shows that the simple rings have a unit element.)

§9.
Discriminator Varieties
In this section we look at the most successful generalization of Boolean algebras to date,
successful because we obtain Boolean product representations (which can be used to provide
a deep insight into algebraic and logical properties).
Deﬁnition 9.1. The discriminator function on a set A is the function t : A3 →A deﬁned
by
t(a, b, c) =
(
a
if a ̸= b
c
if a = b.
A ternary term t(x, y, z) representing the discriminator function on A is called a discrimi-
nator term for A.
Lemma 9.2. (a) An algebra A has a discriminator term iﬀit has a switching term (see §7).
(b) An algebra A with a discriminator term is simple.
Proof. (a) (⇒) If t(x, y, z) is a discriminator term for A, let s(x, y, u, v) = t(t(x, y, u), t(x, y, v), v).
(⇐) If s(x, y, u, v) is a switching term for A, then let t(x, y, z) = s(x, y, z, x).
(b) Let s(x, y, u, v) be a switching term for A. If a, b, c, d ∈A with a ̸= b, we have
⟨c, d⟩= ⟨s(a, a, c, d), s(a, b, c, d)⟩∈Θ(a, b);
hence
a ̸= b ⇒Θ(a, b) = ∇.
Thus A is simple.

Deﬁnition 9.3. Let K be a class of algebras with a common discriminator term t(x, y, z).
Then V (K) is called a discriminator variety.
Examples. (1) If P is a primal algebra, then V (P) is a discriminator variety.

§9. Discriminator Varieties
187
(2) The cylindric algebras of dimension n form a discriminator variety. To see this let
c(x) = c0(c1(. . . (cn−1(x) . . . ). From §3 Exercise 7 we know that a cylindric algebra A of
dimension n is subdirectly irreducible iﬀfor a ∈A,
a ̸= 0 ⇒c(a) = 1.
Thus the term t(x, y, z) given by
[c(x + y) ∧x] ∨[c(x + y)′ ∧z]
is a discriminator term on the subdirectly irreducible members. This ensures that the variety
is a discriminator variety.
Theorem 9.4 (Bulman-Fleming, Keimel, Werner). Let t(x, y, z) be a discriminator term
for all algebras in K. Then
(a) V (K) is an arithmetical variety.
(b) The indecomposable members of V (K) are simple algebras, and
(c) The simple algebras are precisely the members of ISPU(K+), where K+ is K, augmented
by a trivial algebra.
(d) Furthermore, every member of V (K) is isomorphic to a Boolean product of simple alge-
bras, i.e.,
V (K) = IΓaSPU(K+).
Proof.
As t(x, y, z) is a 2/3-minority term for K, we have an arithmetical variety by
II§12.5. Hence the subdirectly irreducible members of V (K) are in HSPU(K) by 6.8. For
Ai ∈K, i ∈I, U ∈Su(I)∗, and a, b, c ∈Q
i∈I Ai, if
a/U = b/U
then
t(a/U, b/U, c/U) = t(a, b, c)/U
= c/U
as
[[t(a, b, c) = c]] ∈U
since
[[a = b]] ∈U
and
[[t(a, b, c) = c]] ⊇[[a = b]].

188
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
Likewise,
[[a = b]] ̸∈U
⇒I −[[a = b]] ∈U
⇒[[t(a, b, c) = a]] ∈U;
hence
a/U ̸= b/U ⇒t(a/U, b/U, c/U) = a/U;
thus t is a discriminator term for Q
i∈I Ai/U. If now
B ≤
Y
i∈I
Ai/U
then t is also a discriminator term for B. Consequently, all members of SPU(K) are simple
by 9.2. It follows by 6.8 that the subdirectly irreducible members of V (K) are up to iso-
morphism precisely the members of SPU(K+), and all subdirectly irreducible algebras are
simple algebras with t(x, y, z) as a discriminator term.
To see that we have Boolean product representations let
A ∈PSSPU(K+),
say A ≤Q
i∈I Si, Si ∈SPU(K+). Let s(x, y, u, v) be a switching term for SPU(K+) (which
must exist by 9.2). If a, b, c, d ∈A and
[[a = b]] ⊆[[c = d]]
then
⟨c, d⟩= ⟨s(a, a, c, d), s(a, b, c, d)⟩∈Θ(a, b).
Thus
⟨a, b⟩∈{⟨c, d⟩: [[a = b]] ⊆[[c = d]]} ⊆Θ(a, b).
The set
{⟨c, d⟩: [[a = b]] ⊆[[c = d]]}
is readily seen to be a congruence on A; hence
Θ(a, b) = {⟨c, d⟩: [[a = b]] ⊆[[c = d]]}.
From this it follows that
Θ(a, b) ∨Θ(c, d) = Θ(t(a, b, c), t(b, a, d))
Θ(a, b) ∧Θ(c, d) = Θ(s(a, b, c, d), c).

§9. Discriminator Varieties
189
Let us verify these two equalities. For i ∈I,
t(a, b, c)(i) = t(b, a, d)(i)
holds iﬀ
a(i) = b(i)
and
c(i) = d(i);
hence
[[t(a, b, c) = t(b, a, d)]] = [[a = b]] ∩[[c = d]],
so
⟨a, b⟩, ⟨c, d⟩∈Θ(t(a, b, c), t(b, a, d)),
thus
Θ(a, b), Θ(c, d) ⊆Θ(t(a, b, c), t(b, a, d)).
This gives
Θ(a, b) ∨Θ(c, d) ⊆Θ(t(a, b, c), t(b, a, d)).
Now clearly
⟨t(a, b, c), t(b, a, d)⟩∈Θ(a, b) ∨Θ(c, d)
as
t(a, b, c)Θ(a, b)t(a, a, c)Θ(c, d)t(a, a, d)Θ(a, b)t(b, a, d).
Thus
⟨t(a, b, c), t(b, a, d)⟩∈Θ(a, b) ∨Θ(c, d),
so
Θ(a, b) ∨Θ(c, d) = Θ(t(a, b, c), t(b, a, d)).
Next, note that
s(a, b, c, d)(i) = c(i)
iﬀ
a(i) = b(i) or c(i) = d(i);
hence
[[s(a, b, c, d) = c]] = [[a = b]] ∪[[c = d]].
This immediately gives
Θ(s(a, b, c, d), c) ⊆Θ(a, b), Θ(c, d),
so
Θ(s(a, b, c, d), c) ⊆Θ(a, b) ∩Θ(c, d).
Conversely, if
⟨e1, e2⟩∈Θ(a, b) ∩Θ(c, d)
then
[[a = b]], [[c = d]] ⊆[[e1 = e2]],

190
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
so
[[s(a, b, c, d) = c]] = [[a = b]] ∪[[c = d]]
⊆[[e1 = e2]],
thus
⟨e1, e2⟩∈Θ(s(a, b, c, d), c).
This shows
Θ(a, b) ∩Θ(c, d) = Θ(s(a, b, c, d), c).
The above equalities show that the ﬁnitely generated congruences on A form a sublattice
L of Con A, and indeed they are all principal. As V (K) is arithmetical L is a distributive
lattice of permuting congruences. Next we show the existence of relative complements. For
a, b, c, d ∈A note that
Θ(c, d) ∧Θ(s(c, d, a, b), b) = Θ(s(c, d, s(c, d, a, b), b), s(c, d, a, b))
= ∆
as one can easily verify
s(c, d, s(c, d, a, b), b) = s(c, d, a, b);
and
Θ(c, d) ∨Θ(s(c, d, a, b), b) = Θ(t(c, d, s(c, d, a, b)), t(d, c, b))
= Θ(t(c, d, a), t(d, c, b))
(just verify that both of the corresponding equalizers are equal to [[c = d]] ∩[[a = b]]); hence
= Θ(a, b) ∨Θ(c, d).
Thus
Θ(a, b)\Θ(c, d) = Θ(s(c, d, a, b), b),
so L is relatively complemented.
Applying 8.14, we see that A ∈IΓaSPU(K+).
Note that if a variety V is such that V = IΓa(K) then VDI ⊆I(K), where VDI is the
class of directly indecomposable members of V.

§10.
Quasiprimal Algebras
Perhaps the most successful generalization of the two-element Boolean algebra was intro-
duced by Pixley in 1970. But before looking at this, we want to consider three remarkable
results which will facilitate the study of these algebras.
Lemma 10.1 (Fleischer). Let C be a subalgebra of A × B, where A, B are in a congruence-
permutable variety V. Let A′ be the image of C under the ﬁrst projection map α, and let B′
be the image of C under the second projection map β. Then
C = {⟨a, b⟩∈A′ × B′ : α′(a) = β′(b)}
for some surjective homomorphisms α′ : A′ →D, β′ : B′ →D.

192
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
Proof. Let θ = ker α↾C ∨ker β ↾C, and let ν be the natural map from C to C/θ. Next,
deﬁne
α′ : A′ →C/θ
to be the homomorphism such that
ν = α′ ◦α↾C
and
β′ : B′ →C/θ
to be such that
ν = β′ ◦β↾C .
(See Figure 29.) Suppose c ∈C. Then
c = ⟨αc, βc⟩∈A′ × B′
and
α′(αc) = νc
= β′(βc),
so
c ∈{⟨a, b⟩∈A′ × B′ : α′(a) = β′(b)}.
Conversely, if
⟨a, b⟩∈A′ × B′
and
α′(a) = β′(b)
let c1, c2 ∈C with
α(c1) = a,
β(c2) = b.
Then
ν(c1) = α′α(c1)
= α′(a)
= β′(b)
= β′(βc2)
= ν(c2),
so
⟨c1, c2⟩∈θ;
hence ⟨c1, c2⟩∈ker α ◦ker β as C has permutable congruences. Choose c ∈C such that
c1(ker α)c(ker β)c2.

§10. Quasiprimal Algebras
193
Then
α(c) = α(c1) = a,
β(c) = β(c2) = b,
so
c = ⟨a, b⟩;
hence
⟨a, b⟩∈C.
This proves
C = {⟨a, b⟩∈A′ × B′ : α′(a) = β′(b)}.

Corollary 10.2 (Foster-Pixley). Let S1, . . . , Sn be simple algebras in a congruence-permutable
variety V. If
C ≤S1 × · · · × Sn
is a subdirect product, then
C ∼= Si1 × · · · × Sik
for some {i1, . . . , ik} ⊆{1, . . . , n}.

194
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
Proof. Certainly the result is true if n = 1. So suppose m > 1 and the result is true for all
n < m. Then C is isomorphic in an obvious way to a subalgebra C∗of (S1×· · ·×Sm−1)×Sm.
Let
A = S1 × · · · × Sm−1,
B = Sm.
Let
α′ : A′ →D,
β′ : B′ →D
be as in 10.1. (Of course B′ = B.) As β′ is surjective and B′ is simple, it follows that D is
simple.
If D is nontrivial, then β′ is an isomorphism. In this case
C∗= {⟨a, b⟩∈A′ × B′ : α′a = β′b}
implies
C∗= {⟨a, β′−1α′a⟩: a ∈A′},
so
A′ ∼= C∗
under the map
a 7→⟨a, β′−1α′a⟩
(just use the fact that β′−1α′ is a homomorphism from A′ to B′), and hence C ∼= A′. As
A′ ≤S1 × · · · × Sm−1
is a subdirect product, then the induction hypothesis implies C is isomorphic to a product
of some of the Si, 1 ≤i ≤m.
The other case to consider is that in which D is trivial. But then
C∗= {⟨a, b⟩∈A′ × B′ : α′a = β′b}
= A′ × B′
so
C ∼= A′ × B′.
As A′ is isomorphic to some product of the Si and B′ is isomorphic to Sm, we have C
isomorphic to a product of suitable Si’s.

Deﬁnition 10.3. Let f be a function from An →A. Deﬁne f on A2 by
f(⟨a1, b1⟩, . . ., ⟨an, bn⟩) = ⟨f(a1, . . . , an), f(b1, . . . , bn)⟩.

§10. Quasiprimal Algebras
195
For an algebra A we say f preserves subalgebras of A2 if, for any B ≤A2,
f(Bn) ⊆B,
i.e., B is closed under f.
Lemma 10.4 (Baker-Pixley).
Let A be a ﬁnite algebra of type F with a majority term
M(x, y, z). Then for any function
f : An →A,
n ≥1,
which preserves subalgebras of A2 there is a term p(x1, . . . , xn) of type F representing f on
A.
Proof. First note that for B ≤A we have
f(Bn) ⊆B
as
C = {⟨b, b⟩: b ∈B}
is a subuniverse of A2; hence
f(Cn) ⊆C,
i.e., if we are given b1, . . . , bn ∈B there is a b ∈B such that
f(⟨b1, b1⟩, . . ., ⟨bn, bn⟩) = ⟨b, b⟩.
But then
f(b1, . . . , bn) = b.
Thus given any n-tuple ⟨a1, . . ., an⟩∈An we can ﬁnd a term p with
p(a1, . . . , an) = f(a1, . . . , an)
as
f(a1, . . ., an) ∈Sg({a1, . . . , an})
(see II§10.3). Also given any two elements
⟨a1, . . . , an⟩, ⟨b1, . . . , bn⟩∈An,
we have
f(⟨a1, b1⟩, . . ., ⟨an, bn⟩) ∈Sg({⟨a1, b1⟩, . . . , ⟨an, bn⟩});
hence there is a term q with
q(⟨a1, b1⟩, . . ., ⟨an, bn⟩) = f(⟨a1, b1⟩, . . ., ⟨an, bn⟩),

196
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
so
q(a1, . . . , an) = f(a1, . . . , an)
and
q(b1, . . . , bn) = f(b1, . . ., bn).
Now suppose that for every k elements of An, k ≥2, we can ﬁnd a term function p which
agrees with f on those k elements. If k ̸= |A|n, let S be a set of k +1 elements of An. Choose
three distinct members ⟨a1, . . . , an⟩, ⟨b1, . . . , bn⟩, ⟨c1, . . . , cn⟩of S, and then choose terms
p1, p2, p3 such that p1 agrees with f on the set S −{⟨a1, . . ., an⟩}, etc. Let
p(x1, . . . , xn) = M(p1(x1, . . . , xn), p2(x1, . . . , xn), p3(x1, . . ., xn)).
Since for any member of S at least two of p1, p2, p3 agree with f, it follows that p agrees
with f on S. By iterating this procedure we are able to construct a term which agrees with
f everywhere.

Deﬁnition 10.5. An algebra S is hereditarily simple if every subalgebra is simple.
Deﬁnition 10.6. A ﬁnite algebra A with a discriminator term is said to be quasiprimal.
Theorem 10.7 (Pixley). A ﬁnite algebra A is quasiprimal iﬀV (A) is arithmetical and A
is hereditarily simple.
Proof. (⇒) In §9 we veriﬁed that if A has a discriminator term then A is hereditarily
simple and V (A) is arithmetical.
(⇐) Let t : A3 →A be the discriminator function on A. Since V (A) is arithmetical,
it suﬃces by 10.4 and II§12.5 to show that t preserves subalgebras of A2. So let C be a
subalgebra of A2. Let A′ be the image of C under the ﬁrst projection map, and A′′ the
image of C under the second projection map. By 10.1 there is an algebra D and surjective
homomorphisms
α′ : A′ →D,
β′ : A′′ →D
such that
C = {⟨a′, a′′⟩∈A′ × A′′ : α′a′ = β′a′′}.
As A is hereditarily simple, it follows that either α′ and β′ are both isomorphisms, or D is
trivial. In the ﬁrst case
C = {⟨a′, β′−1α′a′⟩: a′ ∈A′},
and in the second case
C = A′ × A′′.

§10. Quasiprimal Algebras
197
Now let
⟨a′, a′′⟩, ⟨b′, b′′⟩, ⟨c′, c′′⟩∈A2,
and let C be the subuniverse of A2 generated by these three elements. If C is of the form
{⟨a′, γa′⟩: a′ ∈A′}
for some isomorphism
γ : A′ →A′′
(γ was β′−1α′ above), then
⟨a′, a′′⟩= ⟨b′, b′′⟩
iﬀ
a′ = b′;
hence
t(⟨a′, a′′⟩, ⟨b′, b′′⟩, ⟨c′, c′′⟩) = ⟨t(a′, b′, c′), t(a′′, b′′, c′′)⟩=
(
⟨c′, c′′⟩
if a′ = b′
⟨a′, a′′⟩
if a′ ̸= b′,
and in either case it belongs to C. If C is
A′ × A′′,
then as
t(⟨a′, a′′⟩, ⟨b′, b′′⟩, ⟨c′, c′′⟩) ∈{⟨a′, a′′⟩, ⟨a′, c′′⟩, ⟨c′, c′′⟩, ⟨c′, a′′⟩} ⊆C
we see that this, combined with the previous sentence, shows t preserves subalgebras of A2.

Corollary 10.8 (Foster-Pixley). For a ﬁnite algebra A the following are equivalent:
(a) A is primal,
(b) V (A) is arithmetical and A is simple with no subalgebras except itself, and the only
automorphism of A is the identity map, and
(c) A is quasiprimal and A has only one subalgebra (itself ) and only one automorphism (the
identity map).
Proof. (a
⇒
b) If A is primal then there is a discriminator term for A so V (A) is
arithmetical and A is simple by §9. As all unary functions on A are represented by terms,
A has no subalgebras except A, and only one automorphism.
(b ⇒c) This is immediate from 10.7.
(c ⇒a) A2 can have only A2 and {⟨a, a⟩: a ∈A} as subuniverses in view of the details
of the proof of 10.7. Thus for f : An →A, n ≥1, it is clear that f preserves subalgebras of
A2. By 10.4, f is representable by a term p, so A is primal.


IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
Examples.
(1) The ring Z/(p) = ⟨Z/(p), +, ·, −, 0, 1⟩is primal for p a prime number
as Z/(p) = {1, 1 + 1, . . . }; hence Z/(p) has no subalgebras except itself, and only one
automorphism. A discriminator term is given by
t(x, y, z) = (x −y)p−1 · x + [1 −(x −y)p−1] · z.
(2) The Post algebra Pn = ⟨{0, 1, . . ., n−1}, ∨, ∧, ′, 0, 1⟩is primal as Pn = {0, 0′, . . . , 0(n−1)},
where a(k) means k applications of ′ to a; hence Pn has no subalgebras except Pn, and no au-
tomorphisms except the identity map. For the discriminator term we can proceed as follows.
For a, b ∈Pn,
^
1≤k≤n
a(k) ∨b(k) = 0
iﬀ
a = b
 
^
1≤j≤n−1

Thus let

.
Then
g(a, b) =
(
0
if a = b
1
if a ̸= b.
Now we can let
t(x, y, z) = [g(x, y) ∧x] ∨[g(g(x, y), 1) ∧z].
It is fairly safe to wager that the reader will think that quasiprimal algebras are highly
specialized and rare—however Murskiˇı proved in (6) below that almost all ﬁnite algebras are
quasiprimal.

§11.
Functionally Complete Algebras and
Skew-free Algebras
A natural generalization of primal algebras would be to consider those ﬁnite algebras A such
that every ﬁnitary function on A could be represented by a polynomial (see II§13.3). Given
an algebra A of type F, recall the deﬁnition of FA and AA given in II§13.3.
Deﬁnition 11.1. A ﬁnite algebra A is functionally complete if AA is primal, i.e., if every
ﬁnitary function on A is representable by a polynomial.
In this section we will prove Werner’s remarkable characterization of functionally com-
plete algebras A, given that V (A) is congruence-permutable.
Deﬁnition 11.2. Let 2L denote the two-element distributive lattice ⟨2, ∨, ∧⟩where 2 =
{0, 1} and 0 < 1.

Lemma 11.3. Let S be a ﬁnite simple algebra such that V (S) is congruence-permutable and
Con(Sn
S) ∼= 2n
L
for n < ω. Then S is functionally complete.
Proof. For brevity let F denote FV (SS)(x, y, z). From II§11.10 it follows that F ∈ISP(SS).
As SS has no proper subalgebras, F is subdirectly embeddable in Sk
S for some k. Then from
10.2, we have
F ∼= Sn
S
for some n, so by hypothesis
Con(F) ∼= 2n
L.
Thus Con F is distributive, so by II§12.7, V (SS) is congruence-distributive. Since V (S)
is congruence-permutable so is V (SS) (just use the same Mal’cev term for permutability);
hence V (SS) is arithmetical. As SS has only one automorphism, we see from 10.8 that SS
is primal, so S is functionally complete.

The rest of this section is devoted to improving the formulation of 11.3.
Deﬁnition 11.4. Let θi ∈Con Ai, 1 ≤i ≤n. The product congruence
θ1 × · · · × θn
on A1 × · · · × An is deﬁned by
⟨⟨a1, . . . , an⟩, ⟨b1, . . . , bn⟩⟩∈θ1 × · · · × θn
iﬀ
⟨ai, bi⟩∈θi
for 1 ≤i ≤n.
(We leave the veriﬁcation that θ1 × · · · × θn is a congruence on A1 × · · · × An to the reader.)
Deﬁnition 11.5. A subdirect product
B ≤B1 × · · · × Bk
of ﬁnitely many algebras is skew-free if all the congruences on B are of the form
(θ1 × · · · × θk) ∩B2,
where θi ∈Con Bi, i.e., the congruences on B are precisely the restrictions of the product
congruences on B1 × · · · × Bk to B. A ﬁnite set of algebras {A1, . . . , An} is totally skew-free
if every subdirect product
B ≤B1 × · · · × Bk

§11. Functionally Complete Algebras and Skew-free Algebras
201
is skew-free, where Bi ∈{A1, . . . , An}.
Lemma 11.6. The subdirect product
B ≤B1 × · · · × Bk
is skew-free iﬀ
θ = (θ ∨ρ1) ∩· · · ∩(θ ∨ρk)
for θ ∈Con B, where
ρi = (ker πi) ∩B2
and πi is the ith projection map on B1 × · · · × Bk.
Proof. (⇒) Given B skew-free let θ ∈Con B. Then
θ = (θ1 × · · · × θk) ∩B2
for suitable θi ∈Con Bi. Let
νi : B →B/(θ ∨ρi)
be the canonical homomorphism, and let
ˆπi : B →Bi
be the ith projection of B1 × · · · × Bk restricted to B. Then as
ker ˆπi = ρi ⊆θ ∨ρi = ker νi
there is a homomorphism
αi : Bi →B/(θ ∨ρi)
such that
νi = αiˆπi.
Now for a, b ∈B we have
⟨a, b⟩∈θ ∨ρi
iﬀ
νi(a) = νi(b)
iﬀ
αiπi(a) = αiπi(b)
iﬀ
αiai = αibi
iﬀ
⟨ai, bi⟩∈ker αi;
hence
θ ∨ρi = (∇× · · · × ker αi × · · · × ∇) ∩B2.
Also since
⟨a, b⟩∈ρi ⇒ai = bi

202
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
it is clear that
⟨a, b⟩∈θ ∨ρi ⇒⟨ai, bi⟩∈θi;
hence
ker αi ⊆θi.
Thus
θ ∨ρi ⊆(∇× · · · × θi × · · · × ∇) ∩B2,
and then
θ ⊆(θ ∨ρ1) ∩· · · ∩(θ ∨ρk)
⊆(θ1 × ∇× · · · × ∇) ∩· · · ∩(∇× · · · × ∇× θk) ∩B2
= (θ1 × · · · × θk) ∩B2
= θ,
so the ﬁrst half of the theorem is proved.
(⇐) For this direction just note that the above assertion
θ ∨ρi = (∇× · · · × ker αi × · · · × ∇) ∩B2,
for θ ∈Con B, does not depend on the skew-free property. Thus
θ = (θ ∨ρi) ∩· · · ∩(θ ∨ρk)
= (ker α1 × ∇× · · · × ∇) ∩· · · ∩(∇× · · · × ∇× ker αk) ∩B2
= (ker α1 × · · · × ker αk) ∩B2,
so θ is the restriction of a product congruence.

Now we can ﬁnish oﬀthe technical lemmas concerning the congruences in the abstract
setting of lattice theory.
Lemma 11.7. Suppose L is a modular lattice with a largest element 1. Also suppose that
a1, a2 ∈L have the property:
c ∈[a1 ∧a2, 1] ⇒c = (c ∨a1) ∧(c ∨a2).
Then for any b ∈L,
c ∈[a1 ∧a2 ∧b, b] ⇒c = (c ∨(a1 ∧b)) ∧(c ∨(a2 ∧b)).

Proof. Let c ∈[a1 ∧a2 ∧b, b]. Then
c = c ∨(b ∧a1 ∧a2)
= b ∧(c ∨(a1 ∧a2))
= b ∧(c ∨a1) ∧(c ∨a2)
= [c ∨(a1 ∧b)] ∧[c ∨(a2 ∧b)]
follows from the modular law and our hypotheses.

Lemma 11.8. Let L be a modular lattice with a largest element 1. Then if a1, . . . , an ∈L
have the property
c ∈[ai ∧aj, 1] ⇒c = (c ∨ai) ∧(c ∨aj),
1 ≤i, j ≤n, then
c ∈[a1 ∧· · · ∧an, 1] ⇒c = (c ∨a1) ∧· · · ∧(c ∨an).
Proof. Clearly the lemma holds if n ≤2. So let us suppose it holds for all n < m, where
m ≥3. Then for c ∈[a1 ∧· · · ∧am, 1],
c = c ∨(a1 ∧c)
= c ∨{[(a1 ∧c) ∨(a1 ∧a2)] ∧· · · ∧[(a1 ∧c) ∨(a1 ∧am)]}.
(∗)
This last equation follows by replacing L by the sublattice of elements x of L such that
x ≤a1, and noting that a1 ∧a2, . . . , a1 ∧am satisfy the hypothesis of 11.8 in view of 11.7.
By the induction hypothesis we have for this sublattice
a1 ∧c = [(a1 ∧c) ∨(a1 ∧a2)] ∧· · · ∧[(a1 ∧c) ∨(a1 ∧am)].
Now applying the modular law and the hypotheses to (∗) we have
c = c ∨{a1 ∧[c ∨(a1 ∧a2)] ∧· · · ∧[c ∨(a1 ∧am)]}
= c ∨{a1 ∧[(c ∨a1) ∧(c ∨a2)] ∧· · · ∧[(c ∨a1) ∧(c ∨am)]}
= (c ∨a1) ∧· · · ∧(c ∨am).
This ﬁnishes the induction step.

Lemma 11.9. Let {A1, . . . , An} be a set of algebras in a congruence-modular variety such
that for any subdirect product D of any two (not necessarily distinct ) members, say D ≤Ai×
Aj, the only congruences on D are restrictions of product congruences. Then {A1, . . . , An}
is totally skew-free.

204
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
Proof. Let
B ≤B1 × · · · × Bk
be a subdirect product of members of {A1, . . . , An}, and let
ρi = (ker πi) ∩B2
as before. For 1 ≤i ≤j ≤k, B/(ρi ∩ρj) is isomorphic to a subalgebra of Bi × Bj, which
is a subdirect product of Bi × Bj obtained by using a projection map on B. From this and
the correspondence theorem it follows that if θ ∈Con B, then
ρi ∩ρj ⊆θ
implies
θ = (θ ∨ρi) ∩(θ ∨ρj)
by our assumption on D above and 11.6. Now we can invoke 11.8, noting that B × B is the
largest element of Con B, to show that, for θ ∈Con B,
θ = (θ ∨ρ1) ∩· · · ∩(θ ∨ρk)
because ρ1 ∩· · · ∩ρk is the smallest congruence of B. By 11.6, {A1, . . . , An} must be totally
skew-free.

Lemma 11.10.
Suppose A1, . . ., An belong to a congruence-distributive variety.
Then
{A1, . . . , An} is totally skew-free.
Proof. For any subdirect product
B ≤B1 × · · · × Bk,
where B1, . . . , Bk belong to a congruence-distributive variety, let ρi be as deﬁned in 11.6.
Then for θ ∈Con B,
θ = θ ∨∆= θ ∨(ρ1 ∧· · · ∧ρk)
= (θ ∨ρ1) ∧· · · ∧(θ ∨ρk),
so B is skew-free by 11.6. Hence {A1, . . . , An} is totally skew-free.

Lemma 11.11. Let P be a nontrivial primal algebra. Then
Con P2 ∼= 22
L.
Proof. As V (P) is congruence-distributive, the congruences of P2 are precisely the product
congruences θ1 × θ2 by 11.10. As P is simple, Con P2 is isomorphic to 22
L.

Theorem 11.12 (Werner). Let A be a nontrivial ﬁnite algebra such that V (A) is congruence-
permutable. Then A is functionally complete iﬀCon A2 ∼= 22
L.
Proof. (⇒) Suppose A is functionally complete. Note that
Con An = Con An
An
(adding constants does not aﬀect the congruences). As AA is primal, we have by 11.11,
Con A2 ∼= 22
L.
(⇐) As
Con A2 ∼= 22
L
again
Con A2
A ∼= 22
L.
Thus AA must be simple (otherwise there would be other product congruences on A2
A), and
having the constants of A ensures AA has no proper subalgebras and no proper automor-
phisms. A (now familiar) application of Fleischer’s lemma shows that the only subdirect
powers contained in AA × AA are A2
A and D, where
D = {⟨a, a⟩: a ∈A}.
The congruences on A2
A are product congruences since there are at least four product con-
gruences ∆× ∆, ∆× ∇, ∇× ∆, ∇× ∇, and from above
Con An
A ∼= 2n
L.
The congruences on D are (∇×∇)∩D2 and (∆×∆)∩D2 as D ∼= AA. Thus by 11.9, {AA}
is totally skew-free. Consequently,
Con An
A ∼= 2n
L,
so A is functionally complete by 11.3.

Corollary 11.13 (Maurer-Rhodes).
A ﬁnite group G is functionally complete iﬀG is
nonabelian and simple or G is trivial.
Proof. The variety of groups is congruence-permutable; hence congruence-modular. If
Con G2 ∼= 22
L
then G is simple.

206
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
The nontrivial simple abelian groups are of the form Z/(p); and
|Con(Z/(p) × Z/(p))| > 4
as
{⟨a, a⟩: a ∈Z/(p)}
is a normal subgroup of Z/(p) × Z/(p), so Z/(p) cannot be functionally complete. Hence G
is nonabelian and simple.
If G is nonabelian simple and N is a normal subgroup of G2, suppose ⟨a, b⟩∈N with
a ̸= 1. Choose c ∈G such that
cac−1 ̸= a.
Then
⟨cac−1, b⟩= ⟨c, b⟩⟨a, b⟩⟨c−1, b−1⟩∈N;
hence
⟨cac−1a−1, 1⟩= ⟨cac−1, b⟩⟨a−1, b−1⟩∈N.
As G is simple, it follows that
⟨cac−1a−1, 1⟩
generates the normal subgroup ker π2 since
cac−1a−1 ̸= 1,
so
ker π2 ⊆N.
Similarly,
b ̸= 1 ⇒ker π1 ⊆N.
If both a, b ̸= 1, then
ker π1, ker π2 ⊆N
implies
G2 = N.
Thus G2 has only four normal subgroups, so
Con G2 ∼= 22
L.
This ﬁnishes the proof that G is functionally complete.

Semisimple Varieties
Every nontrivial Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a subdirect power of the simple two-element
algebra, and in 9.4 we proved that every algebra in a discriminator variety is isomorphic to
a subdirect product of simple algebras. We can generalize this in the following manner.
Deﬁnition 12.1. An algebra is semisimple if it is isomorphic to a subdirect product of
simple algebras. A variety V is semisimple if every member of V is semisimple.
Lemma 12.2. A variety V is semisimple iﬀevery subdirectly irreducible member of V is
simple.
Proof. (⇒) Let A be a subdirectly irreducible member of V. Then A can be subdirectly
embedded in a product of simple algebras, say by
α : A →
Y
i∈I
Si.
As A is subdirectly irreducible, there is a projection map
πi :
Y
i∈I
Si →Si

such that πi ◦α is an isomorphism. Thus
A ∼= Si,
so A is simple.
(⇐) For this direction use the fact that every algebra is isomorphic to a subdirect product
of subdirectly irreducible algebras.

Deﬁnition 12.3. Let A be an algebra and let θ ∈Con A. In the proof of II§5.5 we showed
that θ is a subuniverse of A × A. Let θθθ denote the subalgebra of A × A with universe θ.
Lemma 12.4 (Burris). Let A be a nonsimple directly indecomposable algebra in a congruence-
distributive variety. If θ ∈Con A is maximal or the smallest congruence above ∆, then θθθ is
directly indecomposable.
Proof. We have
θθθ ≤A × A.
By 11.10, θθθ is skew-free. Thus suppose
(φ1 × φ2) ∩θ2
and
(φ∗
1 × φ∗
2) ∩θ2
are a pair of factor congruences on θθθ, where φi, φ∗
i ∈Con A, i = 1, 2. From
[(φ1 × φ2) ∩θ2] ◦[(φ∗
1 × φ∗
2) ∩θ2] = ∇θ
it follows that
φi ◦φ∗
i = ∇A,
i = 1, 2. To see this let a, b ∈A. Then
⟨⟨a, a⟩, ⟨b, b⟩⟩∈θ2,
so for some c, d ∈A,
⟨a, a⟩[(φ1 × φ2) ∩θ2]⟨c, d⟩[(φ∗
1 × φ∗
2) ∩θ2]⟨b, b⟩.
Thus
aφ1cφ∗
1b,
aφ2dφ∗
2b.

§12. Semisimple Varieties
209
Next, from
[(φ1 × φ2) ∩θ2] ∩[φ∗
1 × φ∗
2) ∩θ2] = ∆θ
it follows that
φi ∩φ∗
i ∩θ = ∆A
for i = 1, 2. To see this, suppose
⟨a, b⟩∈φ1 ∩φ∗
1 ∩θ,
with a ̸= b. Then
⟨⟨a, b⟩, ⟨b, b⟩⟩∈[(φ1 × φ2) ∩θ2] ∩[(φ∗
1 × φ∗
2) ∩θ2],
which is impossible as
⟨a, b⟩̸= ⟨b, b⟩.
Likewise, we show
φ2 ∩φ∗
2 ∩θ = ∆A.
Suppose θ is a maximal congruence on A. If
φi ∩φ∗
i ̸= ∆A
for i = 1, 2, then
θ ∨(φi ∩φ∗
i) = ∇A
as
φi ∩φ∗
i ⊈θ;
and
θ ∩(φi ∩φ∗
i) = ∆A,
so φi ∩φ∗
i is the complement of θ in Con A, i = 1, 2. In distributive lattices complements are
unique, so
φ1 ∩φ∗
1 = φ2 ∩φ∗
2.
Then choose ⟨a, b⟩∈φ1 ∩φ∗
1 with a ̸= b. This leads to
⟨⟨a, a⟩, ⟨b, b⟩⟩∈[(φ1 × φ2) ∩θ2] ∩[(φ∗
1 × φ∗
2) ∩θ2],
which is impossible as
⟨a, a⟩̸= ⟨b, b⟩.
Now we can assume without loss of generality that
φ1 ∩φ∗
1 = ∆A.

210
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
Thus, by the above, φ1, φ∗
1 is a pair of factor congruences on A. As A is directly indecom-
posable, we must have
{φ1, φ∗
1} = {∆A, ∇A},
say
φ1 = ∇A,
φ∗
1 = ∆A.
Then
(φ∗
1 × φ∗
2) ∩θ2 = (∆A × φ∗
2) ∩θ2
= [∆A × (φ∗
2 ∩θ)] ∩θ2;
hence
φ2 ◦(φ∗
2 ∩θ) = ∇A.
As
φ2 ∩(φ∗
2 ∩θ) = ∆A
and A is directly indecomposable we must have
φ∗
2 ∩θ = ∆A,
so
(φ∗
1 × φ∗
2) ∩θ2 = (∆A × ∆A) ∩θ2
= ∆θ.
This shows that θθθ has only one pair of factor congruences, namely
{∆θ, ∇θ};
hence θθθ is directly indecomposable.
Next suppose θ is the smallest congruence in Con A −{∆A}. Then
θ ∩(φi ∩φ∗
i ) = ∆A
immediately gives
φi ∩φ∗
i = ∆A,
so we must have
{φi, φ∗
i} = {∆A, ∇A}
as
φi ◦φ∗
i = ∇A,
i = 1, 2. If
φ1 ̸= φ2,

§12. Semisimple Varieties
211
say
φ1 = ∇A, φ2 = ∆A,
then
(φ1 × φ2) ∩θ2 = (θ × ∆A) ∩θ2,
which implies
(φ∗
1 × φ∗
2) ∩θ2 = (∆A × θ) ∩θ2.
But if ⟨a, b⟩̸∈θ then
⟨⟨a, a⟩, ⟨b, b⟩⟩̸∈(θ × ∆A) ∩θ2 ◦(∆A × θ) ∩θ2,
so we do not have factor congruences. Hence necessarily
φ1 = φ2,
φ∗
1 = φ∗
2,
and this leads to the factor congruences
{∇θ, ∆θ},
so θθθ is directly indecomposable.

Theorem 12.5 (Burris). If V is a congruence-distributive variety such that every directly
indecomposable member is subdirectly irreducible, then V is semisimple.
Proof. Suppose A ∈V where A is a nonsimple subdirectly irreducible algebra. Let θ be
the least congruence in Con A−{∆}. Note that θ ̸= ∇A. Then θθθ is a directly indecomposable
member of V which is not subdirectly irreducible (as
ρ1 ∩ρ2 = ∆θ
where
ρi = (ker πi) ∩θ2,
πi : A × A →A,
i = 1, 2).

§13.
Directly Representable Varieties
One of the most striking features of the variety of Boolean algebras is the fact that, up to
isomorphism, there is only one nontrivial directly indecomposable member, namely 2 (see
Corollary 1.9). From this we have a detailed classiﬁcation of the ﬁnite Boolean algebras. A
natural generalization is the following.
Deﬁnition 13.1. A variety V is directly representable if it is ﬁnitely generated and has (up
to isomorphism) only ﬁnitely many ﬁnite directly indecomposable members.
After special cases of directly representable varieties had been investigated by Taylor,
Quackenbush, Clark and Krauss, and McKenzie in the mid-1970’s, a remarkable analysis
was made by McKenzie in late 1979. Most of this section is based on his work.
Lemma 13.2 (P´olya). Let c1, . . . , ct be a ﬁnite sequence of natural numbers such that not
all are equal to the same number. Then the sequence
sn = cn
1 + · · · + cn
t ,
n ≥1,
has the property that the set of prime numbers p for which one can ﬁnd an n such that p
divides sn is inﬁnite.
Proof. Suppose that c1, . . ., ct is such a sequence and that the only primes p such that p
divides at least one of {sn : n ≥1} are p1, . . . , pr. Without loss of generality we can assume
that the greatest common divisor of c1, . . . , ct is 1.
Claim. For p a prime and for n ≥1, k ≥1, t < pk+1,
pk+1 ∤c(p−1)pk·n
1
+ · · · + c(p−1)pk·n
t
.

§13. Directly Representable Varieties
213
To see this, note that from Euler’s Theorem we have
p ∤ci ⇒cφ(pk+1)
i
≡1 (mod pk+1);
and furthermore
p | ci ⇒ci ≡0 (mod p)
⇒ck+1
i
≡0 (mod pk+1)
⇒cφ(pk+1)
i
≡0 (mod pk+1).
Let u be the number of integers i ∈[1, t] such that p ∤ci, i.e., cφ(pk+1)
i
≡1 (mod pk+1). Then
u ≥1 as g.c.d.(c1, . . . , ct) = 1. Furthermore, for n ≥1,
cφ(pk+1)·n
1
+ · · · + cφ(pk+1)·n
t
≡u (mod pk+1).
Since 1 ≤u ≤t < pk+1, pk+1 ∤u, and hence the claim is proved.
Now if we set
m = φ(pk+1
1
) · · ·φ(pk+1
r
)
then for n ≥1, 1 ≤j ≤r, t < pk+1, the claim implies
pk+1
j
∤cmn
1
+ · · · + cmn
t
,
so
smn ≤pk+1
1
· · · pk+1
r
as p1, . . . , pr are the only possible prime divisors of smn. Thus the sequence (smn)n≥1 is
bounded. But this can happen only if a1 = · · · = at = 1, which is a contradiction.

Deﬁnition 13.3. A congruence θ on A is uniform if for every a, b ∈A,
|a/θ| = |b/θ|.
An algebra A is congruence-uniform if every congruence on A is uniform.
Theorem 13.4 (McKenzie). If V is a directly representable variety, then every ﬁnite member
of V is congruence-uniform.
Proof. If V is directly representable, then there exist (up to isomorphism) ﬁnitely many
ﬁnite algebras D1, . . . , Dk of V which are directly indecomposable; hence every ﬁnite member
of V is isomorphic to some Dm1
1 ×· · ·×Dmk
k . Thus there are only ﬁnitely many prime numbers
p such that p
|A| for some ﬁnite A ∈V.

214
IV Starting from Boolean Algebras . . .
Now if A is a ﬁnite member of V which is not congruence-uniform, choose θ ∈Con A
such that for some a, b ∈A, |a/θ| ̸= |b/θ|. For n ≥1, let Bn be the subalgebra of An whose
universe is given by
Bn = {a ∈An : a(i)θa(j) for 0 ≤i, j < n}.
Let the cosets of θ be S1, . . ., St and have sizes c1, . . ., ct respectively. Then
|Bn| = cn
1 + · · · + cn
t ;
hence by P´olya’s lemma there are inﬁnitely many primes p such that for some Bn, p
|Bn|. As
Bn ∈SP(A) ⊆V this is impossible. Thus every ﬁnite member of V is congruence-uniform.

Lemma 13.5 (McKenzie). If A is a ﬁnite algebra such that each member of S(A × A) is
congruence-uniform, then the congruences on A permute.
Proof. Given θ1, θ2 ∈Con A, let B be the subalgebra of A × A whose universe is given by
B = θ1 ◦θ2.
Let
φ = θ2 × θ2↾B,
a congruence on B. For a ∈A,
a/θ2 × a/θ2 ⊆θ2 ⊆B;
hence
⟨a, a⟩/φ = a/θ2 × a/θ2.
Since A ∈IS(A × A), both θ2 on A and φ on B are uniform congruences. If r is the size
of cosets of θ2 and s is the size of cosets of φ, it follows that s = r2. Now for ⟨a, b⟩∈B, we
have
⟨a, b⟩/φ ⊆a/θ2 × b/θ2,
|⟨a, b⟩/φ| = s,
|a/θ2| = |b/θ2| = r,
and s = r2; hence
⟨a, b⟩/φ = a/θ2 × b/θ2.
Now for c, d ∈A,
⟨c, d⟩∈θ2 ◦θ1 ◦θ2 ◦θ2
iﬀ
⟨c, d⟩∈a/θ2 × b/θ2
for some ⟨a, b⟩∈B,

§13. Directly Representable Varieties
215
so
θ2 ◦θ1 ◦θ2 ◦θ2 ⊆B = θ1 ◦θ2;
hence
θ2 ◦θ1 ⊆θ1 ◦θ2,
so the congruences on A permute.

Theorem 13.6 (Clark-Krauss). If V is a locally ﬁnite variety all of whose ﬁnite algebras
are congruence-uniform, then V is congruence-permutable.
Proof. As FV (x, y, z) is ﬁnite, by 13.5 it has permutable congruences; hence V is congruence-
permutable.

Corollary 13.7 (McKenzie). If V is a directly representable variety, then V is congruence-
permutable.
Proof. Just combine 13.4 and 13.6.

Theorem 13.8 (Burris). Let V be a ﬁnitely generated congruence-distributive variety. Then
V is directly representable iﬀV is semisimple arithmetical.
Proof. (⇒) From 12.4 and 12.5, V is semisimple, and by 13.7 V is congruence-permutable.
Hence V is semisimple arithmetical.
(⇐) If V is semisimple arithmetical, then every ﬁnite subdirectly irreducible member of
V is a simple algebra; hence every ﬁnite member of V is isomorphic to a subdirect product
of ﬁnitely many simples. Then by 10.2 every ﬁnite member of V is isomorphic to a direct
product of simple algebras. By 6.10 there are only ﬁnitely many simple members of V, so V
is directly representable.

Theorem 13.9 (McKenzie). If V = IΓa(K), where K is a ﬁnite set of ﬁnite algebras, then
V is congruence-permutable.
Proof. As every ﬁnite Boolean space is discrete, it follows that every ﬁnite member of V
is in IP(K+); hence V is directly representable, so 13.7 applies.

Chapter V
Connections with Model Theory
Since the 1950’s, a branch of logic called model theory has developed under the leadership
of Tarski. Much of what is considered universal algebra can be regarded as an extensively
developed fragment of model theory, just as ﬁeld theory is part of ring theory. In this chapter
we will look at several results in universal algebra which require some familiarity with model
theory. The chapter is self-contained, so the reader need not have had any previous exposure
to a basic course in logic.
§1.
First-order Languages, First-order Structures,
and Satisfaction
Model theory has been primarily concerned with connections between ﬁrst-order properties
and ﬁrst-order structures.
First-order languages are very restrictive (when compared to
English), and many interesting questions cannot be discussed using them. On the other
hand, they have a precise grammar and there are beautiful results (such as the compactness
theorem) connecting ﬁrst-order properties and the structures which satisfy these properties.
Deﬁnition 1.1. A (ﬁrst-order) language L consists of a set R of relation symbols and a set
F of function symbols, and associated to each member of R [of F] is a natural number [a
nonnegative integer] called the arity of the symbol. Fn denotes the set of function symbols
in F of arity n, and Rn denotes the set of relation symbols in R of arity n. L is a language
of algebras if R = ∅, and it is a language of relational structures if F = ∅.
Deﬁnition 1.2. If we are given a nonempty set A and a positive integer n, we say that r is
an n-ary relation on A if r ⊆An. r is unary if n = 1, binary if n = 2, and ternary if n = 3.
A relation is ﬁnitary if it is n-ary for some n, 1 ≤n < ω. When r is a binary relation we
frequently write arb for ⟨a, b⟩∈r.
Deﬁnition 1.3. If L is a ﬁrst-order language, then a (ﬁrst-order) structure of type L (or
217

218
V Connections with Model Theory
L-structure) is an ordered pair A = ⟨A, L⟩with A ̸= ∅, where L consists of a family R of
fundamental relations rA on A indexed by R (with the arity of rA equal to the arity of r,
for r ∈R) and a family F of fundamental operations f A on A indexed by F (with the arity
of f A equal to the arity of f, for f ∈F). A is called the universe of A, and in practice we
usually write just r for rA and f for f A. If R = ∅then A is an algebra; if F = ∅then A
is a relational structure. If L is ﬁnite, say F = {f1, . . . , fm}, R = {r1, . . . , rn}, then we often
write
⟨A, f1, . . . , fm, r1, . . ., rn⟩
instead of ⟨A, L⟩.
Examples. (1) If L = {+, ·, ≤}, then the linearly ordered ﬁeld of rationals ⟨Q, +, ·, ≤⟩is a
structure of type L.
(2) If L = {≤}, then a partially ordered set ⟨P, ≤⟩is a relational structure of type L.
Deﬁnition 1.4. If L is a ﬁrst-order language and X is a set (members of X are called
variables), we deﬁne the terms of type L over X to be the terms of type F over X (see
II§11). The atomic formulas of type L over X are expressions of the form
p ≈q
where p, q are terms of type L over X
r(p1, . . . , pn)
where r ∈Rn and p1, . . . , pn are terms of type L over X.
Example. For the language L = {+, ·, ≤} we see that
(x · y) · z ≈x · y,
(x · y) · z ≤x · z
are examples of atomic formulas, where of course we are writing binary functions and binary
relations in the everyday manner, namely we write u · v for ·(u, v), and u ≤v for ≤(u, v). If
we were to rewrite the above atomic formulas using only the original deﬁnition of terms, we
would have the expressions
·(·(x, y), z) ≈·(x, y),
≤(·(·(x, y), z), ·(x, z)).
Deﬁnition 1.5. Let L be a ﬁrst-order language and X a set of variables. The set of (ﬁrst-
order) formulas of type L (or L-formulas) over X, written L(X), is the smallest collection of
strings of symbols from L ∪X ∪{(, )} ∪{&, ∨, ¬, →, ↔, ∀, ∃, ≈} ∪{, } containing the atomic

§1. First-order Languages, First-order Structures, and Satisfaction

formulas of type L over X, and such that if Φ, Φ1, Φ2 ∈L(X) then
(Φ1)&(Φ2) ∈L(X),
(Φ1) ∨(Φ2) ∈L(X),
¬ (Φ) ∈L(X),
(Φ1) →(Φ2) ∈L(X),
(Φ1) ↔(Φ2) ∈L(X),
∀x(Φ) ∈L(X),
∃x(Φ) ∈L(X).
The symbols & (and), ∨(or), ¬ (not), →(implies), and ↔(iﬀ) are called the propositional
connectives. ∀is the universal quantiﬁer, and ∃is the existential quantiﬁer; we refer to them
simply as quantiﬁers. p ̸≈q denotes ¬ (p ≈q).
Example. With L = {+, ·, ≤} we see that
(∀x(x · y ≈y + u)) →(∃y(x · y ≤y + u))
is in L({x, y, u}), but
∀x(x&y ≈u)
does not belong to L({x, y, u}).
Deﬁnition 1.6. A formula Φ1 is a subformula of a formula Φ if there is consecutive string
of symbols in the formula Φ which is precisely the formula Φ1.
Example. The subformulas of
(∀x(x · y ≈y + u)) →(∃y(x · y ≤y + u))
are itself,
∀x(x · y ≈y + u),
x · y ≈y + u,
∃y(x · y ≤y + u),
and
x · y ≤y + u.
Remark. Note that the deﬁnition of subformula does not apply to the string of symbols
(∀x(x · y ≈y + u)) →(∃y(x · y ≤y + u));

220
V Connections with Model Theory
for clearly y ≈y is a consecutive string of symbols in this expression which gives a formula,
but we would not want this to be a subformula. However if one translates the above into
the formula
(∀x(·(x, y) ≈+(y, u)) →(∃y(≤(·(x, y), +(y, u)),
then the subformulas, retranslated, are just those listed in the example above.
Deﬁnition 1.7. A particular variable x may appear several times in the string of symbols
which constitute a formula Φ; each of these is called an occurrence of x. Similarly we may
speak of occurrences of subformulas. Since strings are written linearly we can speak of the
ﬁrst occurrence, etc., reading from left to right.
Example. There are three occurrences of x in the formula
(∀x(x · y ≈y + u)) →(∃y(x · y ≤y + u)).
Deﬁnition 1.8. A particular occurrence of a variable x in a formula Φ is said to belong to
an occurrence of a subformula Φ1 of Φ if the occurrence of x is a component of the string of
symbols which form the occurrence of Φ1. An occurrence of x in Φ is free if x does not belong
to any occurrence of a subformula of the form ∀x(Ψ) or ∃x(Ψ). Otherwise, an occurrence of
x is bound in Φ. A variable x is free in Φ if some occurrence of x is free in Φ. To say that
x is not free in Φ we write simply x ̸∈Φ. A sentence is a formula with no free variables.
When we write Φ(x1, . . . , xn) we will mean a formula all of whose free variables are among
{x1, . . ., xn}. We ﬁnd it convenient to express Φ(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . ., yn, . . .) by Φ(⃗x, ⃗y, . . . ). If
xi is free in Φ(x1, . . . , xn) then this notation is assumed to refer to all the free occurrences
of xi. Thus, given a formula Φ(x1, . . . , xn), when we write
Φ(x1, . . . , xi−1, y, xi+1, . . . , xn)
we mean the formula obtained by replacing all free occurrences of xi by y.
Example. Let Φ(x, y, u) be the formula
(∀x(x · y ≈y + u)) →(∃y(x · y ≤y + u)).
The ﬁrst two occurrences of x in Φ(x, y, u) are bound, the third is free. Φ(x, x, u) is the
formula
(∀x(x · x ≈x + u)) →(∃y(x · y ≤y + u)).
Deﬁnition 1.9. If A is a structure of type L, we let LA denote the language obtained by
adding a nullary function symbol a to L for each a ∈A. Given Φ(x1, . . ., xn) of type LA and
a ∈A, the formula
Φ(x1, . . . , xi−1, a, xi+1, . . ., xn)

§1. First-order Languages, First-order Structures, and Satisfaction
221
is the formula obtained by replacing every free occurrence of xi by a. We sometimes refer to
formulas of type LA as formulas of type L with parameters from A.
When desirable we give ourselves the option of inserting or removing parentheses to
improve readability, and sometimes we use brackets, [, ] and braces {, } instead of parentheses.
Next we want to capture the intuitive understanding of what it means for a ﬁrst-order
formula to be true in a ﬁrst-order structure. A precise deﬁnition of truth (i.e., deﬁnition of
satisfaction) will allow us to do proofs by induction later on. From now on we will frequently
drop parentheses. For example we will write Φ1 & Φ2 instead of (Φ1) & (Φ2), and ∀x∃yΦ
instead of ∀x(∃y(Φ)); but we would not write Φ1 & Φ2 ∨Φ3 for (Φ1) & (Φ2 ∨Φ3).
Deﬁnition 1.10. Let A be a structure of type L. For sentences Φ in LA(X) we deﬁne the
notion A |= Φ (read: “A satisﬁes Φ” or “Φ is true in A” or “Φ holds in A”) recursively as
follows:
(i) if Φ is atomic:
(a) A |= p(a1, . . . , an) ≈q(a1, . . . , an) iﬀpA(a1, . . . , an) = qA(a1, . . . , an)
(b) A |= r(a1, . . ., an) iﬀrA(a1, . . . , an) holds in A
(ii) A |= Φ1 & φ2 iﬀA |= Φ1 and A |= Φ2
(iii) A |= Φ1 ∨Φ2 iﬀA |= Φ1 or A |= Φ2
(iv) A |= ¬ Φ iﬀit is not the case that A |= Φ (which we abbreviate to: A ̸|= Φ)
(v) A |= Φ1 →Φ2 iﬀA ̸|= Φ1 or A |= Φ2
(vi) A |= Φ1 ↔Φ2 iﬀ(A ̸|= Φ1 and A ̸|= Φ2) or (A |= Φ1 and A |= Φ2)
(vii) A |= ∀xΦ(x) iﬀA |= Φ(a) for every a ∈A
(viii) A |= ∃xΦ(x) iﬀA |= Φ(a) for some a ∈A.
For a formula Φ ∈LA(X) we say
A |= Φ
iﬀ
A |= ∀x1 . . . ∀xnΦ,
where x1, . . ., xn are the free variables of Φ. For a class K of L-structures and Φ ∈L(X) we
say
K |= Φ
iﬀ
A |= Φ
for every A ∈K,

and for Σ a set of L-formulas
A |= Σ
iﬀ
A |= Φ
for every Φ ∈Σ
K |= Σ

K |= Φ

(If A |= Σ we also say A is a model of Σ.) Then we say

A |= Φ,

(read: “Σ yields Φ”), and
Σ |= Σ1

Example. A graph is a structure ⟨A, r⟩where r is a binary relation which is irreﬂexive and
symmetric, i.e., for a, b ∈A we do not have r(a, a), and if r(a, b) holds so does r(b, a). Graphs
are particularly nice to work with because of the possibility of drawing numerous examples.
Let A = ⟨A, r⟩be the graph in Figure 30, where an edge between two points means they
are related by r. Let us ﬁnd out if
A |= ∀x∃y∀z(r(x, z) ∨r(y, z)).
This sentence will be true in A iﬀthe following four assertions hold:
(i) A |= ∃y∀z(r(a, z) ∨r(y, z))
(ii) A |= ∃y∀z(r(b, z) ∨r(y, z))
(iii) A |= ∃y∀z(r(c, z) ∨r(y, z))
(iv) A |= ∃y∀z(r(d, z) ∨r(y, z)).
Let us examine (i). It will hold iﬀone of the following holds:
(ia) A |= ∀z(r(a, z) ∨r(a, z))
(ib) A |= ∀z(r(a, z) ∨r(b, z))
(ic) A |= ∀z(r(a, z) ∨r(c, z))
(id) A |= ∀z(r(a, z) ∨r(d, z)).
The validity of (ib) depends on all of the following holding:
(iba) A |= r(a, a) ∨r(b, a)
(ibb) A |= r(a, b) ∨r(b, b)
(ibc) A |= r(a, c) ∨r(b, c)
(ibd) A |= r(a, d) ∨r(b, d).

§1. First-order Languages, First-order Structures, and Satisfaction
223
(ib) is true, hence (i) holds. Likewise, the reader can verify that (ii), (iii), and (iv) hold.
But this means the graph A satisﬁes the original sentence.
It is useful to be able to work with sentences in some sort of normal form.

Deﬁnition 1.11. Let Φ1(x1, . . . , xn) and Φ2(x1, . . . , xn) be two formulas in L(X). We say

A |= Φ2(a1, . . . , an).

provided replacing all free occurrences
of x in Φ(x) by y does not lead
to any new bound occurrences of y.
Proof. All of these are immediate consequences of the deﬁnition of satisfaction. In the
last two cases let us point out what happens if one does not heed the “provided. . . ” clause.
Consider the formula Φ(x) given by ∃y(x ̸≈y). Replacing x by y gives ∃y(y ̸≈y). Now
the sentence ∀x∃y(x ̸≈y) is true in any structure A with at least two elements, whereas
∀x∃y(y ̸≈y) is logically equivalent to ∃y(y ̸≈y), which is never true.

Deﬁnition 1.14. If Φ ∈L(X) we deﬁne the length l(Φ) of Φ to be the number of occurrences
of the symbols &, ∨, ¬, →, ↔, ∀, and ∃in Φ.
Note that l(Φ) = 0
iﬀ
Φ is atomic.
Lemma 1.15. If Φ1 is a subformula of Φ and Φ1 is logically equivalent to Φ2, then replacing
an occurrence of Φ1 by Φ2 gives a formula Φ∗which is logically equivalent to Φ.

§1. First-order Languages, First-order Structures, and Satisfaction
225
Proof. We proceed by induction on l(Φ).
If l(Φ) = 0 then Φ is atomic, so the only subformula of Φ is Φ itself, and the lemma
is obvious in this case. So suppose l(Φ) ≥1 and for any Ψ such that l(Ψ) < l(Φ) the
replacement of an occurrence of a subformula of Ψ by a logically equivalent formula leads to
a formula which is logically equivalent to Ψ. Let Φ1 be a subformula of Φ and suppose Φ1 is
logically equivalent to Φ2. The case in which Φ1 = Φ is trivial, so we assume l(Φ1) < l(Φ).
There are now seven cases to consider. Suppose Φ is Φ′ & Φ′′. Then the occurrence of Φ1
being considered is an occurrence in Φ′ or Φ′′, say it is an occurrence in Φ′. Let Φ′∗be the
result of replacing Φ1 in Φ′ by Φ2. By the induction assumption Φ′∗is logically equivalent to
Φ′. Let Φ∗be the result of replacing the occurrence of Φ1 in Φ by Φ2. Then Φ∗is Φ′∗& Φ′′,
and this is easily argued to be logically equivalent to Φ′ & Φ′′, i.e., to Φ. Likewise one handles
the four cases involving ∨, ¬, →, ↔. If Φ is ∀xΦ′(x, ⃗y ) then let Φ′∗(x, ⃗y ) be the result of
replacing the occurrence of Φ1 in Φ′(x, ⃗y ) by Φ2. Then by the induction hypothesis Φ′∗(x, ⃗y )
is logically equivalent to Φ′(x, ⃗y ), so given a structure A of type L we have
A |= Φ′∗(x, ⃗y ) ↔Φ′(x, ⃗y );
hence
A |= Φ′∗(a, ⃗y ) ↔Φ′(a, ⃗y )
for a ∈A, so
A |= ∀xΦ′∗(x, ⃗y )
iﬀ
A |= ∀xΦ′(x, ⃗y );
thus Φ is logically equivalent to ∀xΦ′∗(x, ⃗y ). Similarly, we can handle the case ∃xΦ′(x, ⃗y ).
Deﬁnition 1.16. An open formula is a formula in which there are no occurrences of quan-
tiﬁers.
Deﬁnition 1.17. A formula Φ is in prenex form if it looks like
Q1x1 . . . QnxnΦ′(x1, . . . , xn)
where each Qi is a quantiﬁer and Φ′(x1, . . . , xn) is an open formula. Φ′ is called the matrix
of Φ.
Here, and in all future references to prenex form, we have the convention that no quan-
tiﬁers need appear in the formula Φ.
Theorem 1.18. Every formula is logically equivalent to a formula in prenex form.
Proof. This follows from 1.12, 1.13, and 1.15. First, if necessary, change some of the bound
variables to new variables so that for any variable x there is at most one occurrence of ∀x as
well as ∃x in the formula, both do not occur in the formula, and no variable occurs both as

226
V Connections with Model Theory
a bound variable and a free variable. Then one simply pulls the quantiﬁers out front using
1.13.

Example. The following shows how to put the formula ∀x ¬ (r(x, y) →∃xr(x, z)) in prenex
form.
∀x ¬ (r(x, y) →∃xr(x, z)) ∼∀x ¬ (r(x, y) →∃wr(w, z))
∼∀x ¬ ∃w(r(x, y) →r(w, z))
∼∀x∀w ¬ (r, (x, y) →r(w, z)).
In view of the associative law for & and ∨, we will make it a practice of dropping parenthe-
ses in formulas when the ambiguity is only “up to logical equivalence”. Thus Φ1 & Φ2 & Φ3
replaces (Φ1 & Φ2) & Φ3 and Φ1 & (Φ2 & Φ3), etc. Also, we ﬁnd it convenient to replace
Φ1 & · · · & Φn by &1≤i≤nΦi (called the conjunction of the Φi), and Φ1∨· · ·∨Φn by W
1≤i≤n Φi
(called the disjunction of the Φi).
Deﬁnition 1.19. An open formula is in disjunctive form if it is in the form
_
i &
j Φij
where each Φij is atomic or negated atomic (i.e., the negation of an atomic formula). An
open formula is in conjunctive form if it is in the form
&
i
_
j
Φij
where again each Φij is atomic or negated atomic.
Theorem 1.20. Every open formula is logically equivalent to an open formula in disjunctive
form, as well as to one in conjunctive form.
Proof.

The notions of subalgebra, isomorphism, and embedding can be easily generalized to
ﬁrst-order structures.
Deﬁnition 1.21. Let A and B be ﬁrst-order structures of type L. We say A is a substructure
of B, written A ≤B, if A ⊆B and the fundamental operations and relations of A are
precisely the restrictions of the corresponding fundamental operations and relations of B to
A. If X ⊆B let Sg(X) be the smallest subset of B which is closed under the fundamental
operations of B. The substructure Sg(X) with universe Sg(X) (assuming Sg(X) ̸= ∅) is
called the substructure generated by X. As in II§3 we have |Sg(X)| ≤|X| + |F| + ω. If K is
a class of structures of type L, let S(K) be the class of all substructures of members of K.
A very restrictive notion of substructure which we will encounter again in the next section
is the following.
Deﬁnition 1.22. Let A, B be two ﬁrst-order structures of type L. A is an elementary
substructure of B if A ≤B and for any sentence Φ of type LA (and hence of type LB),
A |= Φ
iﬀ
B |= Φ.
In this case we write
A ≺B.
S(≺)(K) denotes the class of elementary substructures of members of K.

228
V Connections with Model Theory
Example. Let us ﬁnd the elementary substructures of the group of integers Z = ⟨Z, +, −, 0⟩.
Suppose A ≺Z. As Z is a group, it follows that A is a group.
Z |= ∃x∃y(x ̸≈y),
so
A |= ∃x∃y(x ̸≈y);
hence A is nontrivial. Thus for some n > 0, n ∈A. As
Z |= ∃x(x + x + · · · + x ≈n),
where there are n x’s added together, it follows that A satisﬁes the same; hence
1 ∈A.
But then
A = Z.
Deﬁnition 1.23. Let A and B be ﬁrst-order structures of type L and suppose α : A →B
is a bijection such that
αf(a1, . . . , an) = f(αa1, . . . , αan)
for f a fundamental operation, and that r(a1, . . ., an) holds in A iﬀr(αa1, . . . , αan) holds in
B. Then α is an isomorphism from A to B, and A is isomorphic to B (written A ∼= B). If
α : A →B is an isomorphism from A to a substructure of B, we say α is an embedding of
A into B. Let I(K) denote the closure of K under isomorphism. An embedding α : A →B
such that αA ≺B is called an elementary embedding.

If we are given two structures A and B of type L, then a mapping α : A →B is a
homomorphism if (i) αf(a1, . . . , an) = f(αa1, . . . , αan) for f ∈F, and (ii) r(a1, . . ., an) ⇒
r(αa1, . . . , αan) for r ∈R.
If α is a homomorphism we write, as before, α : A →B. The image of A under α,
denoted by αA, is the substructure of B with universe αA. The homomorphism α is an

letting r(a1, . . . , an) hold iﬀit holds for some A ∈C.

in which each Ψj is atomic or negated atomic, and at most one of the Ψj is atomic.
29. Show that the following can be expressed by Horn formulas: (a) “the cancellation law”

31. Show that a special Horn sentence is logically equivalent to a Horn sentence.
32. Show that if A is a subdirect product of Ai, i ∈I, and Φ is a special Horn sentence

§2.
Reduced Products and Ultraproducts
Reduced products result from a certain combination of the direct product and quotient con-
structions. They were introduced in the 1950’s by  Lo´s, and the special case of ultraproducts
has been a subject worthy of at least one book. In the following you will need to recall the
deﬁnition of [[a = b]] from IV§5.5, and that of direct products of structures from p. 232.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let (Ai)i∈I be a nonempty indexed family of structures of type L, and
suppose F is a ﬁlter over I. Deﬁne the binary relation θF on Q
i∈I Ai by
⟨a, b⟩∈θF
iﬀ
[[a = b]] ∈F.
(When discussing reduced products we will always assume ∅̸∈F, i.e., F is proper.)
Lemma 2.2. For (Ai)i∈I and F as above, the relation θF is an equivalence relation on
Q
i∈I Ai. For a fundamental n-ary operation f of Q
i∈I Ai and for
⟨a1, b1⟩, . . ., ⟨an, bn⟩∈θF
we have
⟨f(a1, . . . , an), f(b1, . . ., bn)⟩∈θF,
i.e., θF is a congruence for the “algebra part of A”.
Proof. Clearly θF is reﬂexive and symmetric. If
⟨a, b⟩, ⟨b, c⟩∈θF
then
[[a = b]], [[b = c]] ∈F,
hence
[[a = b]] ∩[[b = c]] ∈F.
Now from
[[a = c]] ⊇[[a = b]] ∩[[b = c]]
it follows that
[[a = c]] ∈F,
so
⟨a, c⟩∈θF .
Consequently, θF is an equivalence relation. Next with f and ⟨ai, bi⟩as in the statement of
the lemma, note that
[[f(a1, . . . , an) = f(b1, . . ., bn)]] ⊇[[a1 = b1]] ∩· · · ∩[[an = bn]];

§2. Reduced Products and Ultraproducts
235
hence
[[f(a1, . . . , an) = f(b1, . . ., bn)]] ∈F,
so
⟨f(a1, . . . , an), f(b1, . . ., bn)⟩∈θF.

Deﬁnition 2.3. Given a nonempty indexed family of structures (Ai)i∈I of type L and a
proper ﬁlter F over I, deﬁne the reduced product Q
i∈I Ai/F as follows. Let its universe
Q
i∈I Ai/F be the set Q
i∈I Ai/θF, and let a/F denote the element a/θF. For f an n-ary
function symbol and for a1, . . . , an ∈Q
i∈I Ai, let
f(a1/F, . . ., an/F) = f(a1, . . . , an)/F,
and for r an n-ary relation symbol, let r(a1/F, . . ., an/F) hold iﬀ
{i ∈I : Ai |= r(a1(i), . . ., an(i))} ∈F.
If K is a nonempty class of structures of type L, let PR(K) denote the class of all reduced
products Q
i∈I Ai/F, where Ai ∈K.
In view of Deﬁnition 2.3, it is reasonable to extend our use of the [[
]] notation as follows.
Deﬁnition 2.4. If (Ai)i∈I is a nonempty indexed family of structures of type L and if
Φ(a1, . . . , an) is a sentence of type LA, where A = Q
i∈I Ai, let
[[Φ(a1, . . ., an)]] = {i ∈I : Ai |= Φ(a1(i), . . . , an(i))}.
Thus given a reduced product Q
i∈I Ai/F and an atomic sentence Φ(a1, . . . , an), we see
that
Y
i∈I
Ai/F |= Φ(a1/F, . . ., an/F)
iﬀ
[[Φ(a1, . . . , an)]] ∈F.
Determining precisely which sentences are preserved by reduced products has been one
of the milestones in the history of model theory. Our next theorem is concerned with the
easy half of this study.
Deﬁnition 2.5. A Horn formula is a formula in prenex form with a matrix consisting of
conjunctions of formulas Φ1 ∨· · · ∨Φn where each Φi is atomic or negated atomic, and at
most one Φi is atomic in each such disjunction. Such disjunctions of atomic and negated
atomic formulas are called basic Horn formulas.
The following property of direct products is useful in induction proofs on reduced prod-
ucts.

236

Lemma 2.6 (The maximal property). Let Ai, i ∈I, be a nonempty indexed family of
structures of type L. If we are given a formula ∃xΦ(x, y1, . . . , yn) of type L and a1, . . . , an ∈
Q
i∈I Ai, then there is an a ∈Q
i∈I Ai such that
[[∃xΦ(x, a1, . . . , an)]] = [[Φ(a, a1, . . . , an)]].
Proof. For
i ∈[[∃xΦ(x, a1, . . ., an)]]
choose a(i) ∈Ai such that
Ai |= Φ(a(i), a1(i), . . . , an(i)),
and for other i’s in I, let a(i) be arbitrary. Then it is readily veriﬁed that such an a satisﬁes
the lemma.

Theorem 2.7. Let Q
i∈I Ai/F be a reduced product of structures of type L, and suppose
Φ(x1, . . . , xn) is a Horn formula of type L. If
a1, . . . , an ∈
Y
i∈I
Ai
and
[[Φ(a1, . . . , an)]] ∈F
then
Y
i∈I
Ai/F |= Φ(a1/F, . . ., an/F).
Proof. First let us suppose Φ is a basic Horn formula
Φ1(x1, . . . , xn) ∨· · · ∨Φk(x1, . . ., xn).
Our assumption
"" _
1≤i≤k
Φi(a1, . . . , an)
##
∈F
is equivalent to
[
1≤i≤k
[[Φi(a1, . . . , an)]] ∈F.
If, for some Φi which is a negated atomic formula we have
I −[[Φi(a1, . . . , an)]] ̸∈F,

§2. Reduced Products and Ultraproducts
237
then, by the deﬁnition of reduced product,
Y
i∈I
Ai/F |= Φi(a1/F, . . ., an/F);
hence
Y
i∈I
Ai/F |= Φ(a1/F, . . ., an/F).
If now for each negated atomic formula Φi we have
I −[[Φi(a1, . . . , an)]] ∈F,
then there must be one of the Φi’s, say Φk, which is atomic. (Otherwise
I −[[Φ(a1, . . . , an)]] = I −
[
1≤i≤k
[[Φi(a1, . . . , an)]] ∈F,
which is impossible as F is closed under intersection and ∅̸∈F.) Now in this case
[[¬ Φi(a1, . . ., an)]] ∈F
for 1 ≤i ≤k −1, so

&
1≤i≤k−1¬ Φi(a1, . . . , an)

∈F.
Since
[[Φ(a1, . . . , an)]] ∈F,
taking the intersection we have

&
1≤i≤k−1¬ Φi(a1, . . . , an)

& Φk(a1, . . ., an)

∈F,
so
[[Φk(a1, . . . , an)]] ∈F.
This says
Y
i∈I
Ai/F |= Φk(a1/F, . . . , an/F);
hence
Y
i∈I
Ai/F |= Φ(a1/F, . . ., an/F).
If Φ is a conjunction
Ψ1 & · · · & Ψk

238
V Connections with Model Theory
of basic Horn formulas, then
[[Ψ1(a1, . . . , an) & · · · & Ψk(a1, . . . , an)]] ∈F
leads to
[[Ψi(a1, . . . , an)]] ∈F
for 1 ≤i ≤k, so
Y
i∈I
Ai/F |= Ψi(a1/F, . . ., an/F),
1 ≤i ≤k, and thus
Y
i∈I
Ai/F |= Φ(a1/F, . . ., an/F).
Next we look at the general case in which Φ is in the form
Q1y1 . . . QmymΨ(y1, . . . , ym, x1, . . . , xn)
with Ψ being a conjunction of basic Horn formulas. We use induction on the number of
occurrences of quantiﬁers in Φ. If there are no quantiﬁers, then we have ﬁnished this case in
the last paragraph. So suppose that the theorem is true for any Horn formula with fewer than
m occurrences of quantiﬁers. In Φ above let us ﬁrst suppose Q1 is the universal quantiﬁer,
i.e.,
Φ = ∀y1Φ∗(y1, x1, . . . , xn).
If we are given a ∈Q
i∈I Ai, then from
[[Φ(a1, . . . , an)]] ∈F
it follows that
[[Φ∗(a, a1, . . . , an)]] ∈F
as
[[Φ(a1, . . ., an)]] ⊆[[Φ∗(a, a1, . . ., an)]].
By the induction hypothesis
Y
i∈I
Ai/F |= Φ∗(a/F, a1/F, . . . , an/F);
hence
Y
i∈I
Ai/F |= Φ(a1/F, . . ., an/F).
Next suppose Q1 is the existential quantiﬁer, i.e.,
Φ = ∃y1Φ∗(y1, x1, . . . , xn).

§2. Reduced Products and Ultraproducts
239
Choose by 2.6 a ∈Q
i∈I Ai such that
[[Φ(a1, . . . , an)]] = [[Φ∗(a, a1, . . . , an)]].
Then again by the induction hypothesis
Y
i∈I
Ai/F |= Φ∗(a/F, a1/F, . . . , an/F);
hence
Y
i∈I
Ai/F |= Φ(a1/F, . . ., an/F).

The following generalizes the deﬁnition of ultraproducts in IV§6 to arbitrary ﬁrst-order
structures.
Deﬁnition 2.8. A reduced product Q
i∈I Ai/U is called an ultraproduct if U is an ultraﬁlter
over I. If all the Ai = A, then we write AI/U and call it an ultrapower of A. The class of
all ultraproducts of members of K is denoted PU(K).
For the following recall the basic properties of ultraﬁlters from IV§3. We abbreviate
a1, . . ., an by ⃗a, and a1/U, . . . , an/U by ⃗a/U.
Theorem 2.9 ( Lo´s). Given structures Ai, i ∈I, of type L, if U is an ultraﬁlter over I and
Φ is any ﬁrst-order formula of type L, then
Y
i∈I
Ai/U |= Φ(a1/U, . . . , an/U)
iﬀ
[[Φ(a1, . . . , an)]] ∈U.
Proof. (By induction on l(Φ).) For l(Φ) = 0 we have already observed that the theorem is
true. So suppose l(Φ) > 0 and the theorem holds for all Ψ such that l(Ψ) < l(Φ). If
Φ = Φ1 & Φ2,
then
[[Φ1(⃗a) & Φ2(⃗a)]] ∈U
iﬀ
[[Φ1(⃗a)]] ∩[[Φ2(⃗a)]] ∈U
iﬀ
[[Φi(⃗a)]] ∈U
for i = 1, 2
iﬀ
Y
i∈I
Ai/U |= Φi(⃗a/U)
for i = 1, 2
iﬀ
Y
i∈I
Ai/U |= Φ1(⃗a/U) & Φ2(⃗a/U).

240

One handles the logical connectives ∨, ¬, →, ↔in a similar fashion. If
Φ(⃗a) = ∃xˆΦ(x,⃗a),
choose a ∈Q
i∈I Ai such that
[[∃xˆΦ(x,⃗a)]] = [[ˆΦ(a,⃗a)]].
Then
[[Φ(⃗a)]] ∈U
iﬀ
[[∃xˆΦ(x,⃗a)]] ∈U

[[ˆΦ(a,⃗a)]] ∈U

for some a

Y
i∈I
Ai/U |= ∃xˆΦ(x,⃗a/U)
iﬀ
Y
i∈I
Ai/U |= Φ(⃗a/U).
Finally, if
Φ(⃗a) = ∀xˆΦ(x,⃗a)
then one can ﬁnd a Ψ(⃗a) such that the quantiﬁer ∀does not appear in Ψ and Φ ∼Ψ (by
1.13), hence from what we have just proved,
[[Φ(⃗a)]] ∈U

[[Ψ(⃗a)]] ∈U

Lemma 2.10. Let A be a ﬁrst-order structure, I a nonempty index set and F a proper ﬁlter
over I. For a ∈A, let ca denote the element of AI with
ca(i) = a,
i ∈I.
The map
α : A →AI/F
deﬁned by
αa = ca/F
is an embedding of A into AI/F. The map α is called the natural embedding of A into AI/F.

§2. Reduced Products and Ultraproducts
241
Proof. (Exercise.)

Theorem 2.11. If A is a ﬁrst-order structure of type L, I is an index set, and U is an
ultraﬁlter over I, then the natural embedding α of A into AI/U is an elementary embedding.
Proof. Just note that for formulas Φ(x1, . . ., xn) of type L, we have
[[Φ(ca1, . . . , can)]] = I
if
A |= Φ(a1, . . . , an),
and
[[Φ(ca1, . . . , can)]] = ∅
if
A ̸|= Φ(a1, . . ., an).
Thus
αA |= Φ(αa1, . . . , αan)
iﬀ
AI/U |= Φ(αa1, . . ., αan).

Next we prove one of the most celebrated theorems of logic.
Theorem 2.12 (The Compactness Theorem). Let Σ be a set of ﬁrst-order sentences of type
L such that for every ﬁnite subset Σ0 of Σ there is a structure satisfying Σ0. Then A |= Σ
for some A of type L.
Proof. Let I be the family of ﬁnite subsets of Σ, and for i ∈I let Ai be a structure
satisfying the sentences in i. For i ∈I let
Ji = {j ∈I : i ⊆j}.
Then
Ji1 ∩Ji2 = Ji1∪i2,
so the collection of Ji’s is closed under ﬁnite intersection. As no Ji = ∅it follows that
F = {J ⊆I : Ji ⊆J for some i ∈I}
is a proper ﬁlter over I, so by IV§3.17 we can extend it to an ultraﬁlter U over I; and each
Ji belongs to U. Now for Φ ∈Σ we have
{Φ} ∈I,
so
Aj |= Φ
for j ∈J{Φ}
as Φ ∈j. Looking at Q
i∈I Ai we see that
[[Φ]] ⊇J{Φ}

242
V Connections with Model Theory
so
Y
i∈I
Ai/U |= Φ;
hence
Y
i∈I
Ai/U |= Σ.

Corollary 2.13. If Σ is a set of sentences of type L and Φ is a sentence of type L such that
Σ |= Φ,
then, for some ﬁnite subset Σ0 of Σ,
Σ0 |= Φ.
Proof. If the above fails, then for some Σ and Φ and for every ﬁnite subset Σ0 of Σ there is
a structure A which satisﬁes Σ0 but not Φ; hence Σ0∪{¬ Φ} is satisﬁed by some A. But then
2.12 says Σ ∪{¬ Φ} is satisﬁed by some A, which is impossible as A |= Σ implies A |= Φ.
A slight variation of the proof of the compactness theorem gives us the following.
Theorem 2.14. Every ﬁrst-order structure A can be embedded in an ultraproduct of its
ﬁnitely generated substructures.
Proof. Let I be the family of nonempty ﬁnite subsets of A, and for i ∈I let Ai be the
substructure of A generated by i. Also, for i ∈I let
Ji = {j ∈I : i ⊆j}.
As in 2.12 extend the family of Ji’s to an ultraﬁlter U over I. For a ∈A let λa be any
element of Q
i∈I Ai such that
(λa)(i) = a
if a ∈i. Then let
α : A →
Y
i∈I
Ai/U
be deﬁned by
αa = (λa)/U.
For Φ(x1, . . . , xn) an atomic or negated atomic formula and a1, . . . , an ∈A such that
A |= Φ(a1, . . . , an),

§2. Reduced Products and Ultraproducts
243
we have
[[Φ(λa1, . . . , λan)]] ⊇J{a1,...,an};
hence
α(A) |= Φ(λa1/U, . . . , λan/U).
This is easily seen to guarantee that α is an embedding.

For the remainder of this section we will assume that we are working with some convenient
ﬁxed countably inﬁnite set of variables X, i.e., all formulas will be over this X.
Deﬁnition 2.15. A class K of ﬁrst-order L-structures is an elementary class (or a ﬁrst-order
class) if there is a set Σ of ﬁrst-order formulas such that
A ∈K
iﬀ
A |= Σ.
K is said to be axiomatized (or deﬁned) by Σ in this case, and Σ is a set of axioms for K.
Let Th(K) be the set of ﬁrst-order sentences of type L satisﬁed by K, called the theory of
K.
Theorem 2.16. Let K be a class of ﬁrst-order structures of type L. Then the following are
equivalent:
(a) K is an elementary class.
(b) K is closed under I, S(≺), and PU.
(c) IS(≺)PU(K∗), for some class K∗.
Proof. For (a) ⇒(b) use the fact that each of I, S(≺) and PU preserve ﬁrst-order properties.
(b) ⇒(c) is trivial, for let K∗= K. For (c) ⇒(a) we claim that K is axiomatizable by
Th(K∗) where K∗is as in (c). Note that K |= Th(K∗). Suppose
A |= Th(K∗).
Let Th∗(A) be the set of sentences Φ(a1, . . . , an) of type LA satisﬁed by A, and let I be the
collection of ﬁnite subsets of Th∗(A). If
Φ(a1, . . . , an) ∈Th∗(A)
then for some B ∈K∗,
B |= ∃x1 . . . ∃xnΦ(x1, . . . , xn).
For otherwise
K∗|= ∀x1 . . . ∀xn¬ Φ(x1, . . . , xn),
which is impossible as
A |= ∃x1 . . . ∃xnΦ(x1, . . . , xn)

244
V Connections with Model Theory
and A |= Th(K∗). Consequently, for i ∈I we can choose Ai ∈K∗and elements ˆa(i) ∈Ai
for a ∈A such that the formulas in i become true of Ai when a is interpreted as ˆa(i), for
a ∈A. Let
Ji = {j ∈I : i ⊆j},
and, as before, let U be an ultraﬁlter over I such that Ji ∈U for i ∈I. Let ˆa be the element
in Q
i∈I Ai whose ith coordinate is ˆa(i). Then for
Φ(a1, . . . , an) ∈Th∗(A)
we have
[[Φ(ˆa1, . . ., ˆan)]] ⊇Ji ∈U
where
i = {Φ(a1, . . . , an)};
hence
[[Φ(ˆa1, . . . , ˆan)]] ∈U.
Thus
Y
i∈I
Ai/U |= Φ(ˆa1/U, . . ., ˆan/U).
By considering the atomic and negated atomic sentences in Th∗(A), we see that the mapping
α : A →
Y
i∈I
Ai/U
deﬁned by
αa = ˆa/U
gives an embedding of A into Q
i∈I Ai/U, and then again from the above it follows that the
embedding is elementary. Thus A ∈IS(≺)PU(K∗).

Deﬁnition 2.17. An elementary class K is a strictly ﬁrst-order (or strictly elementary)
class if K can be axiomatized by ﬁnitely many formulas, or equivalently by a single formula.
Corollary 2.18. An elementary class K of ﬁrst-order structures is a strictly elementary
class iﬀthe complement K′ of K is closed under ultraproducts.
Proof. If K is axiomatized by Φ, then the complement of K is axiomatized by ¬ Φ; hence
K′ is an elementary class, so K′ is closed under PU. Conversely suppose K′ is closed under
PU. Let I be the collection of ﬁnite subsets of Th(K). If K is not ﬁnitely axiomatizable, for
each i ∈I there must be a structure Ai such that
Ai |= i

§2. Reduced Products and Ultraproducts
245
but
Ai ̸∈K.
Let
Ji = {j ∈I : i ⊆j},
and construct U as before. Then
Y
i∈I
Ai/U |= Φ
for Φ ∈Th(K) as
[[Φ]] ⊇J{Φ} ∈U.
Thus
Y
i∈I
Ai/U |= Th(K),
so
Y
i∈I
Ai/U ∈K.
But this is impossible since by the assumption
Y
i∈I
Ai/U ∈K′
as each Ai ∈K′. Thus K must be a strictly elementary class.

Deﬁnition 2.19. A ﬁrst-order formula Φ is a universal formula if it is in prenex form and all
the quantiﬁers are universal. An elementary class is a universal class if it can be axiomatized
by universal formulas.
Theorem 2.20. Let K be a class of structures of type L. Then the following are equivalent:
(a) K is a universal class,
(b) K is closed under I, S, and PU,
(c) K = ISPU(K∗), for some K∗.
Proof. (a) ⇒(b) is easily checked and (b) ⇒(c) is straightforward. For (c) ⇒(a) let
Th∀(K∗) be the set of universal sentences of type L which are satisﬁed by K∗, and suppose
A |= Th∀(K∗). Let Th∗
∀(A) be the set of universal sentences of type LA which are satisﬁed
by A. Now we just repeat the last part of the proof of 2.16, replacing Th∗by Th∗

Deﬁnition 2.21. A ﬁrst-order formula Φ is a universal Horn formula if it is both a universal
and a Horn formula. A class K of structures is a universal Horn class if it can be axiomatized
by universal Horn formulas.
Before looking at classes deﬁned by universal Horn formulas we need a technical lemma.

Lemma 2.22. The following inequalities on class operators hold:
(a) P ≤IPR,
(b) PRPR ≤IPR,
(c) PR ≤ISPPU.
Proof. (a) Given Q
i∈I Ai let F = {I} be the smallest ﬁlter over I. Then one sees that
Y
i∈I
Ai ∼=
Y
i∈I
Ai/F
using the map α(a) = a/F.
(b) Given a set J and a family of pairwise disjoint sets Ij, j ∈J, and algebras Ai for
i ∈Ij and a ﬁlter F over J and for j ∈J a ﬁlter Fj over Ij, deﬁne
I =
[
j∈J
Ij
and let
ˆF = {S ⊆I : {j ∈J : S ∩Ij ∈Fj} ∈F}.
Then ˆF is easily seen to be a ﬁlter over I, and we will show that
Y

F ∼=

Ai/ ˆF.
For each j ∈J deﬁne
αj :
Y
i∈I
Ai →
Y
i∈Ij

by
αj(a) = a↾Ij.
Then αj is a surjective homomorphism from Q
i∈I Ai to Q
i∈Ij Ai. Let

Let

surjective. Also let
ν∗:
Y

be the natural map. Let us show that
ker(ν ◦β) = θ ˆF.
We have
⟨a, b⟩∈ker(ν ◦β) ⇔⟨βa, βb⟩∈ker ν = θ ˆF
⇔[[βa = βb]] ∈F
⇔{j ∈J : νj(a↾Ij) = νj(b↾Ij)} ∈F
⇔{j ∈J : [[a = b]] ∩Ij ∈Fj} ∈F
⇔[[a = b]] ∈ˆF.
Thus we have a bijection

γ preserves fundamental relations to the reader.

Thus

Theorem 2.23. Let K be a class of structures of type L. Then the following are equivalent:
(a) K is a universal Horn class,
(b) K is closed under I, S, and PR,
(c) K is closed under I, S, P, and PU,
(d) K = ISPR(K∗), for some K∗,
(e) K = ISPPU(K∗), for some K∗.
Proof. (a) ⇒(b) is easily checked using 2.7, and (b) ⇒(c), (b) ⇒(d) and (c) ⇒(e) are
clear. For (d) ⇒(a) and (e) ⇒(a) let Th∀H(K∗) be the set of universal Horn sentences of
type L which are true of K∗. Certainly K |= Th∀H(K∗). Suppose
A |= Th∀H(K∗).
Let Th∗
0(A) be the set of atomic or negated atomic sentences true of A in LA. (This is called
the open diagram of A.) If we are given
{Φ1(a1, . . . , an), . . . , Φk(a1, . . ., an)} ⊆Th∗
0(A)
then
A |= ∃x1 . . . ∃xn[Φ1(x1, . . ., xn) & · · · & Φk(x1, . . ., xn)].
We want to show some member of P(K∗) satisﬁes this sentence as well. For this purpose it
suﬃces to show
P(K∗) ̸|= ∀x1 . . . ∀xn[¬ Φ1(x1, . . . , xn) ∨· · · ∨¬ Φk(x1, . . . , xn)].
If at most one Φi is negated atomic, then the universal sentence above would be logically
equivalent to a universal Horn sentence which is not true of A, hence not of K∗. So let us
suppose at least two of the Φi are negated atomic, say Φi is negated atomic for 1 ≤i ≤t
(where 2 ≤t ≤k), and atomic for t+1 ≤i ≤k. Then, for 1 ≤i ≤t, one can argue as above
that
K∗̸|= ∀x1 . . . ∀xn[¬ Φi(x1, . . . , xn) ∨¬ Φt+1(x1, . . . , xn) ∨· · · ∨¬ Φk(x1, . . ., xn)];
hence for some Ai ∈K∗,
Ai |= ∃x1 . . . ∃xn[Φi(x1, . . . , xn) & Φt+1(x1, . . ., xn) & · · · & Φk(x1, . . ., xn)].

250
V Connections with Model Theory
For 1 ≤i ≤t, 1 ≤j ≤n, choose aj(i) ∈Ai such that
Ai |= Φi(a1(i), . . . , an(i)) & Φt+1(a1(i), . . ., an(i)) & · · · & Φk(a1(i), . . . , an(i)).
Then
Y
1≤i≤t
Ai |= &
1≤i≤kΦi(a1, . . . , an)
and
Y
1≤i≤t
Ai ∈P(K∗).
Let I be the collection of ﬁnite subsets of Th∗
0(A), and proceed as in the proof of 2.16,
replacing Th∗(A) by Th∗
0(A), to obtain
A ∈ISPUP(K∗).
From 2.22,
ISPR ≤ISPPU ≤ISPRPR ≤ISPR;
hence
ISPR = ISPPU.
Now
ISPUP ≤ISPRPR = ISPR;
hence
A ∈ISPUP(K∗) ⊆ISPR(K∗) = ISPPU(K∗) = K.

Let us now turn to algebras.
Deﬁnition 2.24. A quasi-identity is an identity or a formula of the form (p1 ≈q1 & · · · & pn ≈
qn) →p ≈q. A quasivariety is a class of algebras closed under I, S, and PR, and containing
the one-element algebras.
Theorem 2.25. Let K be a class of algebras. Then the following are equivalent:
(a) K can be axiomatized by quasi-identities,
(b) K is a quasivariety,
(c) K is closed under I, S, P, and PU and contains a trivial algebra,
(d) K is closed under ISPR and contains a trivial algebra, and
(e) K is closed under ISPPU and contains a trivial algebra.
Proof. As quasi-identities are logically equivalent to universal Horn formulas, and as trivial
algebras satisfy any quasi-identity, we have (a) ⇒(b). (b) ⇒(c), (b) ⇒(d) and (c) ⇒(e)

§2. Reduced Products and Ultraproducts
251
are obvious. If (d) or (e) holds, then K can be axiomatized by universal Horn formulas by
2.23 which we may assume to be of the form ∀x1 . . . ∀xn(Ψ1 ∨· · · ∨Ψk) with each Ψi an
atomic or negated atomic formula. (Why?) As a trivial algebra cannot satisfy a negated
atomic formula, exactly one of Ψ1, . . . , Ψk is atomic. Such an axiom is logically equivalent
to a quasi-identity.

For us the study of universal algebra has been almost synonymous with the study of
varieties, but the Russian mathematicians under the leadership of Mal’cev have vigorously
pursued the subject of quasivarieties as well.
Example. The cancellation law
x · y ≈x · z →y ≈z
is a quasi-identity.

Principal Congruence Formulas
Principal congruence formulas are the obvious ﬁrst-order formulas for describing principal
congruences. We give two applications of principal congruence formulas, namely McKenzie’s
theorem on deﬁnable principal congruences, and Taylor’s theorem on the number of subdi-
rectly irreducible algebras in a variety. Throughout this section we are working with a ﬁxed
language F of algebras. First we look at how to construct principal congruences using unary
polynomials.
Lemma 3.1 (Mal’cev). Let A be an algebra of type F and suppose a, b, c, d ∈A. Then
⟨a, b⟩∈Θ(c, d)
iﬀthere are terms
pi(x, y1, . . . , yk),
1 ≤i ≤m, and elements e1, . . . , ek ∈A such that
a = p1(s1,⃗e ),
pi(ti,⃗e ) = pi+1(si+1,⃗e )
for 1 ≤i ≤m,
pm(tm,⃗e ) = b,
where
{si, ti} = {c, d}

§3. Principal Congruence Formulas
253
for 1 ≤i ≤m.
Proof. Let pi(x, y1, . . . , yk) be any terms of type F and let e1, . . ., ek be any elements of A.
Then clearly
⟨pi(c,⃗e ), pi(d,⃗e )⟩∈Θ(c, d);
hence if
{si, ti} = {c, d}
and
pi(ti,⃗e ) = pi+1(si+1,⃗e )
then by the transitivity of Θ(c, d),
⟨p1(s1,⃗e ), pm(tm,⃗e )⟩∈Θ(c, d).
Thus the collection θ∗of pairs ⟨a, b⟩such that there are pi’s and ej’s as above form a subset
of Θ(c, d). Now note that θ∗is an equivalence relation, and indeed a congruence. For if
⟨aj, bj⟩∈θ∗,
1 ≤j ≤n, and if f is a fundamental n-ary operation, let
aj = pj1(sj1,⃗ej),
pji(tji,⃗ej) = pji+1(sji+1,⃗ej),
and
pjmj(tjmj,⃗ej) = bj.
Then
f(b1, . . . , bj−1, aj, . . . , an) = f(b1, . . . , bj−1, pj1(sj1,⃗ej), aj+1, . . . , an),
f(b1, . . . , bj−1, pji(tji,⃗ej), aj+1, . . . , an) = f(b1, . . . , bj−1, pji+1(sji+1,⃗ej), aj+1, . . . , an),
1 ≤i ≤mj, and
f(b1, . . . , bj−1, pjmj(tjmj,⃗ej), aj+1, . . . , an) = f(b1, . . . , bj−1, bj, aj+1, . . . , an);
hence
⟨f(b1, . . . , bj−1, aj, . . . , an), f(b1, . . . , bj, aj+1, . . . , an)⟩∈θ∗,
so by transitivity
⟨f(a1, . . . , an), f(b1, . . . , bn)⟩∈θ∗.
As
⟨c, d⟩∈θ∗⊆Θ(c, d)

254

we must have
Θ(c, d) = θ∗,
since Θ(c, d) is the smallest congruence containing ⟨c, d⟩.

⟨a, b⟩∈Θ(c, d)

Deﬁnition 3.4. A variety V has deﬁnable principal congruences if there is a ﬁnite subset
Π0 of Π such that for A ∈V and a, b, c, d ∈A,

iﬀ
A |= π(a, b, c, d)
for some π ∈Π0.
Theorem 3.5 (McKenzie). If V is a directly representable variety, then V has deﬁnable
principal congruences.
Proof. Choose ﬁnite algebras A1, . . . , Ak ∈V such that for any ﬁnite B ∈V,
B ∈IP({A1, . . . , Ak}),
and let
mi = |Ai|.

§3. Principal Congruence Formulas

Now let
K = {Aj1
1 × · · · × Ajk
k : ji ≤m4
i , 1 ≤i ≤k}.
As K is a ﬁnite set of ﬁnite algebras, it is clear that there is a ﬁnite Π0 ⊆Π such that for
A ∈K and a, b, c, d ∈A,
⟨a, b⟩∈Θ(c, d)
iﬀ
A |= π(a, b, c, d)
for some π ∈Π0. Now suppose B is any ﬁnite member of P({A1, . . . , Ak}) and a, b, c, d ∈B
with
⟨a, b⟩∈Θ(c, d).
Let
B = As1
1 × · · · × Ask
k .
Let us rewrite the latter as
B11 × · · · × B1s1 × · · · × Bk1 × · · · × Bksk,
with Bij = Ai. For some π ∈Π we have
B |= π(a, b, c, d).
Let π(x, y, u, v) be
∃w1 . . . ∃wrΦ(x, y, u, v, w1, . . ., wr),
where Φ is open. Let e1, . . . , er ∈B be such that
B |= Φ(a, b, c, d, e1, . . . , er).
As there are at most m4
i possible 4-tuples
⟨a(i, j), b(i, j), c(i, j), d(i, j)⟩
for 1 ≤j ≤si we can partition the indices i1, . . . , isi into sets Ji1, . . . , Jiti with ti ≤m4
i such
that on each Jij the elements a, b, c, d are all constant. Thus in view of the description of
congruence formulas we can assume the e’s are all constant on Jij. The set of elements of B
which are constant on each Jij form a subuniverse C of B, and let C be the corresponding
subalgebra. Then C ∈I(K), for if we select one index (ij)∗from each Jij then the map
α : C →
Y
B(ij)∗
deﬁned by
α(c)(ij)∗= c((ij)∗)

256
V Connections with Model Theory
is easily seen to be an isomorphism. As αC ∈H(B),
αC |= π(αa, αb, αc, αd);
hence
C |= π(a, b, c, d).
It follows that for some π∗∈Π0 (as C ∈I(K)),
C |= π∗(a, b, c, d).
But then
B |= π∗(a, b, c, d).
Hence for any ﬁnite member B of V, the principal congruences of B can be described just
by using the formulas in Π0.
Finally, if B is any member of V and a, b, c, d ∈B with
⟨a, b⟩∈Θ(c, d)
then for some π ∈Π we have
B |= π(a, b, c, d).
If π is
∃w1 . . . ∃wrΦ(x, y, u, v, w1, . . . , wr)
with Φ open, choose e1, . . . , er ∈B such that
B |= Φ(a, b, c, d, e1, . . . , er).
Let C be the subalgebra of B generated by {a, b, c, d, e1, . . . , er}. Then
C |= Φ(a, b, c, d, e1, . . . , er)
so
C |= π(a, b, c, d);
hence for some π∗∈Π0,
C |= π∗(a, b, c, d),
so
B |= π∗(a, b, c, d).
Thus V has deﬁnable principal congruences.

Before proving Taylor’s Theorem we need a combinatorial lemma, a proof of which can
be found in [3].

Lemma 3.6 (Erd¨os). Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal and let A be a set with |A| > 2κ, C a
set with |C| ≤κ. Let A(2) be the set of doubletons {c, d} contained in A with c ̸= d. If α is a
map from A(2) to C, then for some inﬁnite subset B of A,
α(B(2)) = {e}
for some e ∈C.
Theorem 3.7 (Taylor). Let V be a variety of type F, and let κ = max(ω, |F|). If V has
a subdirectly irreducible algebra A with |A| > 2κ, then V has arbitrarily large subdirectly
irreducible algebras.
Proof. If A ∈V is subdirectly irreducible and |A| > 2κ, then let a, b ∈A be such that
Θ(a, b) is the smallest congruence not equal to ∆. As there are only κ many formulas in Π,
and as
A |= π(a, b, c, d)
for some π ∈Π, if c ̸= d, it follows from 3.3 and 3.6 that for some inﬁnite subset B of A
there is a π∗∈Π such that for c, d ∈B, if c ̸= d then
A |= π∗(a, b, c, d).
Given an inﬁnite set I of new nullary function symbols with |I| = m and an inﬁnite set of
variables X, let Σ be
{i ̸≈j : i, j ∈I and i ̸= j} ∪(IdV (X)) ∪{π∗(a, b, i, j) : i, j ∈I and i ̸= j} ∪{a ̸≈b}.
Then for each ﬁnite Σ0 ⊆Σ we see that by interpreting the i’s as suitable members of B,
it is possible to ﬁnd an algebra (essentially A) satisfying Σ0. Thus Σ is satisﬁed by some
algebra A∗of type F ∪I ∪{a, b}. Let I ⊆A∗be the elements of A∗corresponding to I, and
let a, b again denote appropriate elements of A∗. Then |I| = m, and a ̸= b. Choose θ to be
a maximal congruence on A∗among the congruences on A∗which do not identify a and b.
Then i, j ∈I and i ̸= j imply
⟨i, j⟩̸∈θ,
as
A∗|= π∗(a, b, i, j).
Consequently A∗/θ is subdirectly irreducible and
|A∗/θ| ≥|I| = m.
This shows that V has arbitrarily large subdirectly irreducible members.

The next result does not depend on principal congruence formulas, but does indeed nicely
complement the previous theorem.

V Connections with Model Theory
Theorem 3.8 (Quackenbush).
If V is a locally ﬁnite variety with, up to isomorphism,
only ﬁnitely many ﬁnite subdirectly irreducible members, then V has no inﬁnite subdirectly
irreducible members.
Proof. Let V ∗be the class of ﬁnite subdirectly irreducible members of V. If A ∈V then
let K be the set of ﬁnitely generated subalgebras of A. By 2.14 we have
A ∈ISPU(K),
and from local ﬁniteness
K ⊆IPS(V ∗) ⊆ISP(V ∗);
hence
A ∈ISPUSP(V ∗),
so
A ∈ISPPU(V ∗)
by 2.23. As an ultraproduct of ﬁnitely many ﬁnite algebras is isomorphic to one of the
algebras, we have
A ∈ISP(V ∗);
hence
A ∈IPS(V ∗),
so A cannot be both inﬁnite and subdirectly irreducible.

Three Finite Basis Theorems
One of the older questions of universal algebra was whether or not the identities of a ﬁnite
algebra of ﬁnite type F could be derived from ﬁnitely many of the identities. Birkhoﬀproved
that this was true if a ﬁnite bound is placed on the number of variables, but in 1954 Lyndon
constructed a seven-element algebra with one binary and one nullary operation such that
the identities were not ﬁnitely based. Murskiˇı constructed a three-element algebra whose
identities are not ﬁnitely based in 1965, and Perkins constructed a six-element semigroup
whose identities are not ﬁnitely based in 1969. An example of a ﬁnite nonassociative ring
whose identities are not ﬁnitely based was constructed by Polin in 1976. On the positive
side we know that ﬁnite algebras of the following kinds have a ﬁnitely based set of identi-
ties: two-element algebras (Lyndon, 1951), groups (Oates-Powell, 1965), rings (Kruse; Lvov,
1973), algebras determining a congruence-distributive variety (Baker, 1977), and algebras
determining a variety with ﬁnitely many ﬁnite subdirectly irreducibles and deﬁnable prin-
cipal congruences (McKenzie, 1978). We will prove the theorems of Baker, Birkhoﬀ, and
McKenzie in this section.
Deﬁnition 4.1. Let X be a set of variables and K a class of algebras. We say that IdK(X)
is ﬁnitely based if there is a ﬁnite subset Σ of IdK(X) such that
Σ |= IdK(X),
and we say that the identities of K are ﬁnitely based if there is a ﬁnite set of identities Σ
such that for any X,
Σ |= IdK(X).
1This is apparently an open problem.

Theorem 4.2 (Birkhoﬀ). Let A be a ﬁnite algebra of ﬁnite type F and let X be a ﬁnite set
of variables. Then IdA(X) is ﬁnitely based.
Proof. Let θ be the congruence on T(X) deﬁned by
⟨p, q⟩∈θ
iﬀ
A |= p ≈q.
(This, of course, is the congruence used to deﬁne FV (A)(X).) As A is ﬁnite there are only
ﬁnitely many equivalence classes of θ. From each equivalence class of θ choose one term. Let
this set of representatives be Q = {q1, . . . , qn}. Now let Σ be the set of equations consisting
of
x ≈y
if x, y ∈X
and ⟨x, y⟩∈θ,
qi ≈x
if x ∈X
and ⟨x, qi⟩∈θ,
f(qi1, . . ., qin) ≈qin+1
if f ∈Fn
and ⟨f(qi1, . . . , qin), qin+1⟩∈θ.
Then a proof by induction on the number of function symbols in a term p ∈T(X) shows
that if
⟨p, qi⟩∈θ
then
Σ |= p ≈qi.
But then
Σ |= p ≈q
if
A |= p ≈q,
and as
A |= Σ,
IdK(X) is indeed ﬁnitely based.

Theorem 4.3 (McKenzie). If V is a locally ﬁnite variety of ﬁnite type F with ﬁnitely many
ﬁnite subdirectly irreducible members and if V has deﬁnable principal congruences, then the
identities of V are ﬁnitely based.
Proof. Let Π0 ⊆Π be a ﬁnite set of principal congruence formulas which show that V has
deﬁnable principal congruences. Let Π0 be {π1, . . . , πn}, and deﬁne Φ to be
π1 ∨· · · ∨πn.

§4. Three Finite Basis Theorems
261
Then for A ∈V and a, b, c, d ∈A,
⟨a, b⟩∈Θ(c, d) ⇔A |= Φ(a, b, c, d).
Let S1, . . . , Sn be ﬁnite subdirectly irreducible members of V such that every ﬁnite sub-
directly irreducible member of V is isomorphic to one of the Si’s. By 3.8 they are, up to
isomorphism, the only subdirectly irreducible algebras in V. Let Ψ1 be a sentence which
asserts “the collection of ⟨a, b⟩such that Φ(a, b, c, d) holds is Θ(c, d),” i.e. Ψ1 can be
∀u∀v

Φ(u, v, u, v) & ∀xΦ(x, x, u, v) & ∀x∀y[Φ(x, y, u, v) →Φ(y, x, u, v)]
& ∀x∀y∀z[Φ(x, y, u, v) & Φ(y, z, u, v) →Φ(x, z, u, v)]


&
1≤i≤nΦ(xi, yi, u, v) →Φ(f(⃗x), f(⃗y), u, v)

.
Thus for A any algebra of type F, A |= Ψ1 iﬀfor all a, b, c, d ∈A,
⟨a, b⟩∈Θ(c, d) ⇔A |= Φ(a, b, c, d).
Next let Ψ2 be a sentence which says
“an algebra is isomorphic to one of S1, . . . , Sn”
(see §1 Exercise 3). Then let Ψ3 be a sentence which says
“an algebra satisﬁes Ψ1, and if it is subdirectly irreducible
then it is isomorphic to one of S1, . . ., Sn.”
For example, Ψ3 could be
Ψ1 & ({∃x∃y[x ̸≈y & ∀u∀v(u ̸≈v →Φ(x, y, u, v))] →Ψ2} ∨∀x∀y(x ≈y)).
Let Σ be the set of identities of V over an inﬁnite set of variables X. As
Σ |= Ψ3,
there must be a ﬁnite subset Σ0 of Σ such that
Σ0 |= Ψ3
by 2.13. But then the subdirectly irreducible algebras satisfying Σ0 will satisfy Ψ3; hence
they will be in V . Thus the variety deﬁned by Σ0 must be V.

Now we turn to the proof of Baker’s ﬁnite basis theorem. From this paragraph until the
statement of Corollary 4.18 we will assume that our ﬁnite language of algebras is F, and

262
V Connections with Model Theory
that we are working with a congruence-distributive variety V. Let p0(x, y, z), . . . , pn(x, y, z)
be ternary terms which satisfy J´onsson’s conditions II§12.6.
Lemma 4.4.
V |= pi(x, u, x) ≈pi(x, v, x),
1 ≤i ≤n −1
V |= x ̸≈y →[p1(x, x, y) ̸≈p1(x, y, y) ∨· · · ∨pn−1(x, x, y) ̸≈pn−1(x, y, y)].
Proof. These are both immediate from II§12.6.

The proof of Baker’s theorem is must easier to write out if we can assume that the pi’s
are function symbols.
Deﬁnition 4.5.
Let F∗be the language obtained by adjoining new ternary operation
symbols t1, . . . , tn−1 to F, and let V ∗be the variety deﬁned by the identities Σ of type F
over some inﬁnite set X of variables true of V plus the identities
ti(x, y, z) ≈pi(x, y, z),
1 ≤i ≤n −1.
Lemma 4.6. If the identities Σ∗of V ∗are ﬁnitely based, then so are the identities Σ of V.
Proof. Let Σ∗∗be
Σ ∪{ti(x, y, z) ≈pi(x, y, z) : 1 ≤i ≤n −1},
and let Σ∗
0 be a ﬁnite basis for Σ∗. Then
Σ∗∗|= Σ∗
0;
hence by 2.13 there is a ﬁnite subset Σ∗∗
0 of Σ∗∗such that
Σ∗∗
0 |= Σ∗
0.
Thus Σ∗∗
0 is a set of axioms for V ∗; hence there is a ﬁnite Σ0 ⊆Σ such that
Σ0 ∪{ti(x, y, z) ≈pi(x, y, z); 1 ≤i ≤n −1}
axiomatizes V ∗. Hence it is clear that
Σ0 |= Σ
as one can add new functions ti to any A satisfying Σ0 to obtain A∗with
A∗|= Σ∗∗
0 ,

§4. Three Finite Basis Theorems
263
so
A |= Σ.

Deﬁnition 4.7. Let T ∗be the set of all terms p(x, ⃗y ) of type F∗such that (i) no variable
occurs twice in p, and (ii) the variable x occurs in every nonvariable subterm of p (as deﬁned
in II§14.13).
Lemma 4.8. For A ∈V ∗and a, b, a′, b′ ∈A we have
Θ(a, b) ∩Θ(a′, b′) ̸= ∆
iﬀ
A |= ∃⃗z ∃⃗w [ti(p(a,⃗z ), q(a′, ⃗w ), p(b,⃗z )) ̸≈ti(p(a,⃗z ), q(b′, ⃗w ), p(b,⃗z ))]
for some p(x,⃗z ), q(x, ⃗w ) ∈T ∗and some i, 1 ≤i ≤n −1.
Proof. (⇒) Suppose c ̸= d and
⟨c, d⟩∈Θ(a, b) ∩Θ(a′, b′).
Then we claim that for some ˆp(x, ⃗y ) ∈T ∗, for some j, and for some ⃗g from A, we have
tj(c, ˆp(a,⃗g ), d) ̸= tj(c, ˆp(b,⃗g ), d).
To see this ﬁrst note that the equivalence relation on A generated by
{⟨ˆp(a,⃗g ), ˆp(b,⃗g )⟩: ˆp ∈T ∗,⃗g from A}
is Θ(a, b) (one can argue this in a manner similar to the proof of 3.1). As
⟨c, d⟩∈Θ(a, b)
we see that for each i,
⟨ti(c, c, d), ti(c, d, d)⟩
is in the equivalence relation generated by
{⟨ti(c, ˆp(a,⃗g ), d), ti(c, ˆp(b,⃗g ), d)⟩: ˆp ∈T ∗,⃗g from A}.
As c ̸= d, for some j we know
tj(c, c, d) ̸= tj(c, d, d)
by 4.4; hence for some ˆp, some ⃗g, and the same j,
tj(c, ˆp(a,⃗g ), d) ̸= tj(c, ˆp(b,⃗g ), d),

264
V Connections with Model Theory
proving the claim. By incorporating c, d into the parameters, we have a p ∈T ∗and param-
eters ⃗e such that
p(a,⃗e ) ̸= p(b,⃗e );
and furthermore
⟨p(a,⃗e ), p(b,⃗e )⟩∈Θ(a′, b′)
as
⟨p(a,⃗e ), p(b,⃗e )⟩∈Θ(c, d)
because of 4.4. Now starting with ⟨p(a,⃗e ), p(b,⃗e )⟩instead of ⟨c, d⟩, we can repeat the above
argument to ﬁnd q ∈T ∗, ti and ⃗f from A such that
ti(p(a,⃗e ), q(a′, ⃗f ), p(b,⃗e )) ̸= ti(p(a,⃗e ), q(b′, ⃗f ), p(b,⃗e )),
as desired.
(⇐) If for some i
ti(p(a,⃗e ), q(a′, ⃗f ), p(b,⃗e )) ̸= ti(p(a,⃗e ), q(b′, ⃗f ), p(b,⃗e )),
then, as the ordered pair consisting of these two distinct elements is in both Θ(a, b) and
Θ(a′, b′) by 4.4, we have
Θ(a, b) ∩Θ(a′, b′) ̸= ∆.

Deﬁnition 4.9. Suppose the operation symbols in F∗have arity at most r, with r ﬁnite.
For m < ω let T ∗
m be the subset of T ∗consisting of those terms p in T ∗with no more than
m occurrences of function symbols. Then deﬁne δm(x, y, u, v) to be
_
1≤i≤n−1
p,q∈T ∗
m
∃⃗z ∃⃗w [ti(p(x,⃗z ), q(u, ⃗w ), p(y,⃗z )) ̸≈ti(p(x,⃗z ), q(v, ⃗w ), p(y,⃗z ))]
where the z’s come from {z1, . . . , zmr}, and the w’s come from {w1, . . . , wmr}.
The next lemma is just a restatement of Lemma 4.8.
Lemma 4.10. For A ∈V ∗and a, b, a′, b′ ∈A, we have
Θ(a, b) ∩Θ(a′, b′) ̸= ∆
iﬀ
A |= δm(a, b, a′, b′)
for some m < ω.

§4. Three Finite Basis Theorems
265
Deﬁnition 4.11. Let δ∗
m be the sentence
∀x∀y∀u∀v[δm+1(x, y, u, v) →δm(x, y, u, v)].
Lemma 4.12. (a)
V∗|= δ∗
m →δ∗
m+1
for m < ω, and
(b) for A ∈V ∗, if
A |= δ∗
m
and
A |= δk(a, b, c, d),
then
A |= δm(a, b, c, d)
for k, m < ω.
Proof. To prove (a) suppose, for A ∈V ∗,
A |= δ∗
m
and, for some a, b, c, d ∈A,
A |= δm+2(a, b, c, d).
We want to show
A |= δm+1(a, b, c, d).
Choose p, q ∈T ∗
m+2, ⃗f,⃗g ∈A, and i such that
ti(p(a, ⃗f ), q(c,⃗g ), p(b, ⃗f )) ̸= ti(p(a, ⃗f ), q(d,⃗g ), p(b, ⃗f )).
Then one can ﬁnd p′, q′ ∈T ∗
1 , p′′, q′′ ∈T ∗
m+1 with
p(x,⃗z ) = p′′(p′(x,⃗z(1)),⃗z(2))
q(x, ⃗w ) = q′′(q′(x, ⃗w(1)), ⃗w(2))
where ⃗z(1),⃗z(2), ⃗w(1), ⃗w(2) are subsequences of ⃗z, respectively ⃗w. Let
a′ = p′(a, ⃗f(1)),
b′ = p′(b, ⃗f(1)),
c′ = q′(c,⃗g(1)),
d′ = q′(d,⃗g(1)).

266
V Connections with Model Theory
Then
ti(p′′(a′, ⃗f(2)), q′′(c′,⃗g(2)), p′′(b′, ⃗f(2))) ̸= ti(p′′(a′, ⃗f(2)), q′′(d′,⃗g(2)), p′′(b′, ⃗f(2)));
hence
A |= δm+1(a′, b′, c′, d′).
As A |= δ∗
m it follows that
A |= δm(a′, b′, c′, d′),
so there are ˆp, ˆq ∈T ∗
m, and ⃗h,⃗k ∈A, and j such that
tj(ˆp(a′,⃗h ), ˆq(c′,⃗k ), ˆp(b′,⃗h )) ̸= tj(ˆp(a′,⃗h ), ˆq(d′,⃗k ), ˆp(b′,⃗h )),
i.e.,
tj(ˆp(p′(a, ⃗f(1)),⃗h ), ˆq(q′(c,⃗g(1)),⃗k ), ˆp(p′(b, ⃗f(1),⃗h ))
̸= tj(ˆp(p′(a, ⃗f(1)),⃗h ), ˆq(q′(d,⃗g(1)),⃗k ), ˆp(p′(b, ⃗f(1),⃗h )).
Now
ˆp(p′(x,⃗z(1)),⃗u ) ∈T ∗
m+1
for suitable ⃗u, and likewise
ˆq(q′(x, ⃗w(1)),⃗v ) ∈T ∗
m+1
for suitable ⃗v, so
A |= δm+1(a, b, c, d),
as was to be shown.
Combining (a) with the fact that
V ∗|= δk →δk+1,
k < ω, we can easily show (b).

Deﬁnition 4.13. An algebra A is ﬁnitely subdirectly irreducible if for a, b, a′, b′ ∈A with
a ̸= b, a′ ̸= b′ we always have
Θ(a, b) ∩Θ(a′, b′) ̸= ∆.
(Any subdirectly irreducible algebra is ﬁnitely subdirectly irreducible.) If V is a variety,
then VF SI denotes the class of ﬁnitely subdirectly irreducible algebras in V.
Lemma 4.14. If V ∗
F SI is a strictly elementary class, then, for some n0 < ω,
V ∗
F SI |= (x ̸≈y & u ̸≈v) →δn0(x, y, u, v)

§4. Three Finite Basis Theorems
267
and
V ∗|= δ∗
n0.
Proof. Let Φ axiomatize V ∗
F SI. Then the set of formulas
{Φ & (a ̸≈b & c ̸≈d) & ¬ δm(a, b, c, d)}m<ω
cannot be satisﬁed by any algebra A and elements a, b, c, d ∈A in view of 4.10. Hence by
the compactness theorem, there is an n0 < ω such that
{Φ & (x ̸≈y & u ̸≈v) & ¬ δm(x, y, u, v)}m≤n0
cannot be satisﬁed. By taking negations, we see that every algebra of type F∗satisﬁes one
of
{Φ →[(x ̸≈y & u ̸≈v) →δm(x, y, u, v)]}m≤n0;
hence if A ∈V ∗
F SI and a, b, c, d ∈A, we have
A |=
_
m≤n0
(a ̸≈b & c ̸≈d) →δm(a, b, c, d)
so
A |= (a ̸≈b & c ̸≈d) →
_
m≤n0
δm(a, b, c, d);
and as
V ∗
F SI |= δm →δm+1,
we have
A |= (a ̸≈b & c ̸≈d) →δn0(a, b, c, d).
Thus
V ∗
F SI |= (x ̸≈y & u ̸≈v) →δn0(x, y, u, v).
Again if
A ∈V ∗
F SI
and a, b, c, d ∈A and
A |= δn0+1(a, b, c, d)
then
Θ(a, b) ∩Θ(c, d) ̸= ∆
by 4.10, so a ̸= b and c ̸= d. From the ﬁrst part of this lemma we have
A |= δn0(a, b, c, d).

268
V Connections with Model Theory
Thus
V ∗
F SI |= δ∗
n0.
Now if
A ∈PS(V ∗
F SI),
say
A ≤
Y
i∈I
Ai
(as a subdirect product),
where Ai ∈V ∗
F SI, and if a, b, c, d ∈A and
A |= δn0+1(a, b, c, d),
then for some p, q ∈T ∗
n0+1, for some ⃗e, ⃗f from A, and for some j, we have
tj(p(a,⃗e ), q(c, ⃗f ), p(b,⃗e )) ̸= tj(p(a,⃗e ), q(d, ⃗f ), p(b,⃗e ));
hence for some i ∈I,
tj(p(a,⃗e ), q(c, ⃗f ), p(b,⃗e ))(i) ̸= tj(p(a,⃗e ), q(d, ⃗f ), p(b,⃗e ))(i).
Thus
Ai |= δn0+1(a(i), b(i), c(i), d(i)).
As V ∗
F SI |= δ∗
n0 it follows that
Ai |= δn0(a(i), b(i), c(i), d(i)).
We leave it to the reader to see that the above steps can be reversed to show
A |= δn0(a, b, c, d).
Consequently,
V ∗|= δ∗
n0.

Deﬁnition 4.15. If V ∗
F SI is a strictly elementary class, let Φ1 axiomatize V ∗

and let Φ3 be the sentence

where n0 is as in 4.14.
Lemma 4.16. If V ∗
F SI is a strictly elementary class, then
V ∗|= δ∗
n0 & Φ2 & (Φ3 →Φ1),
where n0 and the Φi are as in 4.15.
Proof. We have
V ∗|= δ∗
n0
from 4.14 and
V ∗|= Φ2
follows from 4.4. Finally, the assertions
A |= Φ3,
A ∈V ∗
imply
A ∈V ∗
F SI
in view of 4.10; hence
V ∗|= Φ3 →Φ1.

The following improvement of Baker’s theorem (4.18) was pointed out by J´onsson.
Theorem 4.17. Suppose V is a congruence-distributive variety of ﬁnite type such that VF SI
is a strictly elementary class. Then V has a ﬁnitely based equational theory.
Proof. Let p1, . . . , pn−1 be the terms used in 4.4, and let V ∗be as deﬁned in 4.5. Let Φ
axiomatize VF SI. Then
Φ &

&
1≤i≤n−1ti(x, y, z) ≈pi(x, y, z)

axiomatizes V ∗
F SI, so V ∗
F SI is also a strictly elementary class. Now let Φ1, Φ2, Φ3 and n0 be
as in 4.15. If Σ∗is the set of identities true of V ∗over some inﬁnite set of variables, then
Σ∗|= δ∗
n0 & Φ2 & (Φ3 →Φ1)
by 4.16. By 2.13 it follows that there is a ﬁnite subset Σ∗
0 of Σ∗such that
Σ∗
0 |= δ∗
n0 & Φ2 & (Φ3 →Φ1).

270
V Connections with Model Theory
We want to show that Σ∗
0 axiomatizes V ∗, so suppose A is ﬁnitely subdirectly irreducible
and A |= Σ∗
0. The only time we have made use of congruence-distributivity was to obtain
terms for 4.4. All of the subsequent results have depended only on 4.4 (this is not surprising
in view of Exercise 3). As Φ2 holds in the variety deﬁned by Σ∗
0 we can use these subsequent
results. Hence if a, b, c, d ∈A and a ̸= b, c ̸= d, then
A |= δm(a, b, c, d)
for some m < ω by 4.10. As A |= δ∗
n0 we know
A |= δn0(a, b, c, d)
by 4.12. Thus
A |= Φ3,
and as
A |= Φ3 →Φ1,
it follows that
A |= Φ1.
This means
A ∈V ∗
F SI;
hence every subdirectly irreducible algebra satisfying Σ∗
0 also satisﬁes Σ∗. In view of Birkhoﬀ’s
theorem (II§8.6), Σ∗
0 is a set of axioms for V ∗. From 4.6 it is clear that V has a ﬁnitely based
set of identities.

Corollary 4.18 (Baker). If V is a ﬁnitely generated congruence-distributive variety of ﬁnite
type, then V has a ﬁnitely based equational theory.
Proof. The proof of J´onsson’s Theorem IV§6.8 actually gives VF SI ⊆HSPu(K), where
K generates V. If V is ﬁnitely generated, this means VF SI = VSI, a ﬁnitely axiomatizable
elementary class.

§5.
Semantic Embeddings and Undecidability
In this section we will see that by assuming a few basic results about undecidability we will be
able to prove that a large number of familiar theories are undecidable. The fundamental work
on undecidability was developed by Church, G¨odel, Kleene, Rosser, and Turing in the 1930’s.
Rosser proved that the theory of the natural numbers is undecidable, and Turing constructed
a Turing machine with an undecidable halting problem. These results were subsequently
encoded into many problems to show that the latter were also undecidable—some of the
early contributors were Church, Novikov, Post, and Tarski.
Popular new techniques of
encoding were developed in the 1960’s by Ershov and Rabin.
We will look at two methods, the embedding of the natural numbers used by Tarski, and
the embedding of ﬁnite graphs used by Ershov and Rabin.
The precise deﬁnition of decidability cannot be given here—however it suﬃces to think
of a set of objects as being decidable if there is an “algorithm” to determine whether or not
an object is in the set, and it is common to think of an algorithm as a computer program.
Let us recall the deﬁnition of the theory of a class of structures.
Deﬁnition 5.1. Let K be a class of structures of type L. The theory of K, written Th(K),
is the set of all ﬁrst-order sentences of type L (over some ﬁxed “standard” countably inﬁnite
set of variables) which are satisﬁed by K.
Deﬁnition 5.2. Let A be a structure of type L and let B be a structure of type L∗. Suppose
we can ﬁnd formulas
∆(x)
Φf(x1, . . . , xn, y)
for f ∈Fn, n ≥1
Φr(x1, . . . , xn)
for r ∈Rn, n ≥1
of type L∗such that if we let
B0 = {b ∈B : B |= ∆(b)}

272
V Connections with Model Theory
then the set
{⟨⟨b1, . . . , bn⟩, b⟩∈Bn
0 × B0 : B |= Φf(b1, . . . , bn, b)}
deﬁnes an n-ary function f on B0, for f ∈Fn, n ≥1, and the set
{⟨b1, . . . , bn⟩∈Bn
0 : B |= Φr(b1, . . . , bn)}
deﬁnes an n-ary relation r on B0 for r ∈Rn, n ≥1, such that by suitably interpreting the
constant symbols of L in B0 we have a structure B0 of type L isomorphic to A. Then we
say A can be semantically embedded in B, written A
-
sem B. The notation A
-
sem K means
A can be semantically embedded in some member of K, and the notation H
-
sem K means
each member of H can be semantically embedded in at least one member of K, using the
same formulas ∆, Φf, Φr.
Lemma 5.3.
If G
-
sem H and H
-
sem K, then G
-
sem K, i.e., the notion of semantic
embedding is transitive.
Proof. (Exercise.)

Deﬁnition 5.4.
If K is a class of structures of type L and c1, . . . , cn are symbols not
appearing in L, then K(c1, . . . , cn) denotes the class of all structures of type L∪{c1, . . ., cn},
where each ci is a constant symbol, obtained by taking the members B of K and arbitrarily
designating elements c1, . . ., cn in B.
Deﬁnition 5.5. Let N be the set of natural numbers, and let N be ⟨N, +, ·, 1⟩.
We will state the following result without proof, and use it to prove that the theory of
rings and the theory of groups are undecidable. (See [33].)
Theorem 5.6 (Tarski). Given K, if for some n < ω we have N
-
sem K(c1, . . . , cn), then
Th(K) is undecidable.
Lemma 5.7 (Tarski). N

sem Z = ⟨Z, +, ·, 1⟩, Z being the set of integers.
Proof. Let ∆(x) be
∃y1 · · · ∃y4[x ≈y1 · y1 + · · · + y4 · y4 + 1].
By a well-known theorem of Lagrange,
Z |= ∆(n)
iﬀn ∈N.
Let Φ+(x1, x2, y) be
x1 + x2 ≈y,

and let Φ.(x1, x2, y) be
x1 · x2 ≈y.
Then it is easy to see N

Theorem 5.8 (Tarski). The theory of rings is undecidable.
Proof. Z is a ring, so 5.6 applies.

Remark. In the above theory of rings we can assume the language being used is any of the
usual languages such as {+, ·}, {+, ·, 1}, {+, ·, −, 0, 1} in view of 5.6.
Lemma 5.9 (Tarski).
⟨Z, +, ·, 1⟩
-
sem ⟨Z, +, 2, 1⟩,
where 2 denotes the function mapping a to a2.
Proof. Let ∆(x) be
x ≈x,
let Φ+(x1, x2, y) be
x1 + x2 ≈y,
and let Φ.(x1, x2, y) be
y + y + x2
1 + x2
2 ≈(x1 + x2)2.
To see that the latter formula actually deﬁnes · in Z, note that in Z
a · b = c ⇔2c + a2 + b2 = (a + b)2.

Lemma 5.10 (Tarski).
⟨Z, +, 2, 1⟩
-
sem ⟨Z, +, |, 1⟩,
where a|b means a divides b.
Proof. Let ∆(x) be
x ≈x,
let Φ+(x1, x2, y) be
x1 + x2 ≈y
and let Φ2(x1, y) be
∀z[(x1 + y)|z ↔((x1|z) & (x1 + 1|z))]
& ∀u∀v∀z[((u + x1 ≈y) & (v + 1 ≈x1))
→(u|z ↔(x1|z & v|z))].

Then Φ2(a, b) holds for a, b ∈Z iﬀ
a + b = ± a(a + 1)
b −a = ± a(a −1),
and thus iﬀ
b = a2.

Lemma 5.11 (Tarski).
Let Sym(Z) be the set of bijections from Z to Z, let ◦denote
composition of bijections, and let π be the bijection deﬁned by π(a) = a + 1, a ∈Z. Then
⟨Z, +, |, 1⟩
-
sem ⟨Sym(Z), ◦, π⟩.
Proof. Let ∆(x) be
x ◦π ≈π ◦x,
let Φ+(x1, x2, y) be
x1 ◦x2 ≈y,
and let Φ|(x1, x2) be
∀z(x1 ◦z ≈z ◦x1 →x2 ◦z ≈z ◦x2).
For σ ∈Sym(Z) note that
σ ◦π = π ◦σ
iﬀfor a ∈Z,
σ(a + 1) = σ(a) + 1;
hence if
σ ◦π = π ◦σ
then
σ(a) = σ(0) + a,
i.e.,
σ = πσ(0).
Thus
⟨Sym(Z), ◦, π⟩|= ∆(σ)
iﬀ
σ ∈{πn : n ∈Z}.

§5. Semantic Embeddings and Undecidability
275
Clearly Φ+ deﬁnes a function on this set, and indeed
⟨Sym(Z), ◦, π⟩|= Φ+(πa, πb, πc)
iﬀ
a + b = c.
Next we wish to show
⟨Sym(Z), ◦, π⟩|= Φ|(πa, πb)
iﬀ
a|b,
in which case the mapping
a 7→πa
for a ∈Z gives the desired isomorphism to show
⟨Z, +, |, 1⟩−−→
sem ⟨Sym(Z), ◦, π⟩.
So suppose a|b in Z. If σ ∈Sym(Z) and
σ ◦πa = πa ◦σ
we have
σ(c + a) = σ(c) + a
for c ∈Z; hence
σ(c + d · a) = σ(c) + d · a
for c, d ∈Z, so in particular
σ(c + b) = σ(c) + b;
hence
σ ◦πb = πb ◦σ.
Thus
a|b ⇒⟨Sym(Z), ◦, π⟩|= Φ|(πa, πb).
Conversely suppose
⟨Sym(Z), ◦, π⟩|= Φ|(πa, πb)
for some a, b ∈Z. If b = 0 then a|b, so suppose b ̸= 0. Let
ρ(c) =
(
c + a
if a|c
c
if a ∤c
for c ∈Z. Clearly ρ ∈Sym(Z). An easy calculation shows
ρ ◦πa = πa ◦ρ;

276
V Connections with Model Theory
hence looking at Φ| we must have
ρ ◦πb = πb ◦ρ.
Now
πb ◦ρ(c) =
(
c + a + b
if a|c
c + b
if a ∤c
and
ρ ◦πb(c) =
(
c + b + a
if a|c + b
c + b
if a ∤c + b.
Thus
a|c
iﬀ
a|c + b,
for c ∈Z; hence a|b.

Corollary 5.12 (Tarski). The theory of groups is undecidable.
Proof. From 5.3, 5.7, 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11 we have N
-
sem ⟨Sym(Z), ◦, π⟩. If K is the class
of groups (in the language {·}) then ⟨Sym(Z), ◦, π⟩∈K(c1); hence by 5.6 it follows that
Th(K) is undecidable.

A major result of J. Robinson was to show ⟨N, +, ·, 1⟩
-
sem ⟨Q, +, ·, 1⟩; hence the theory
of ﬁelds is undecidable.
Now we turn to our second technique for proving undecidability. Recall that a graph is
a structure ⟨G, r⟩where r is an irreﬂexive and symmetric binary relation.
Deﬁnition 5.13. Gﬁn will denote the class of ﬁnite graphs.
The following result we state without proof. (See [13]; Rabin [1965].)
Theorem 5.14 (Ershov, Rabin). If we are given K, and for some n < ω we have
Gﬁn
-
sem K(c1, . . . , cn),
then Th(K) is undecidable.
Corollary 5.15 (Grzegorczyk). The theory of distributive lattices is undecidable.
Proof. If P = ⟨P, ≤⟩is a poset, recall that a lower segment of P means a subset S of P
such that a ∈P, b ∈S and a ≤b imply a ∈S. In I§3 Exercise 4 it was stated that a ﬁnite
distributive lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of nonempty lower segments (under ⊆) of the
poset of join irreducible elements of the lattice; and if we are given any poset with 0 then
the nonempty lower segments form a distributive lattice, with the poset corresponding to
the join irreducibles.

§5. Semantic Embeddings and Undecidability
277
Thus given a ﬁnite graph ⟨G, r⟩, let us deﬁne a poset P = ⟨P, ≤⟩by
P = G ∪{{a, b} ⊆G : arb holds} ∪{0},
and require p ≤q to hold iﬀp = q, p = 0, or p ∈G and q is of the form {p, b}. Then in
the lattice L of lower segments of P the minimal join irreducible elements are precisely the
lower segments of the form {a, 0} for a ∈G; and arb holds in G iﬀthere is a join irreducible
element above {a, 0} and {b, 0} in L. (See Figure 34 for the poset corresponding to the graph
in Figure 30.) Hence if we let Irr(x) be
∀y∀z(y ∨z ≈x →(y ≈x ∨z ≈x))
and then let ∆(x) be
Irr(x) & ∀y[(y ≤x & Irr(y)) →(y ≈0 ∨y ≈x)] & (x ̸≈0)
and let Φr(x1, x2) be
(x1 ̸≈x2) & ∃y[Irr(y) & x1 ≤y & x2 ≤y],
where in the above formulas u ≤v is to be replaced by u ∧v = u, then we see that ⟨G, r⟩is
semantically embedded in ⟨L, ∨, ∧, 0⟩.

Corollary 5.16 (Rogers). The theory of two equivalence relations is undecidable, i.e., if K
is the class of structures ⟨A, r1, r2⟩where r1 and r2 are both equivalence relations on A, then
Th(K) is undecidable.

278
V Connections with Model Theory
Proof. Given a ﬁnite graph ⟨G, r⟩let ≤be a linear order on G. Then let S be the set
G ∪{⟨a, b⟩: arb}.
Let the equivalence class a/r1 be
{a} ∪{⟨a, b⟩: arb, a < b} ∪{⟨b, a⟩: arb, a < b}
and let the equivalence class b/r2 be
{b} ∪{⟨a, b⟩: arb, a < b} ∪{⟨b, a⟩: arb, a < b}.
(See Figure 35 for the structure ⟨S, r1, r2⟩corresponding to the graph in Figure 30 with
a < b < c < d. The rows give the equivalence classes of r1, the columns the equivalence
classes of r2.) Then ⟨S, r1, r2⟩is a set with two equivalence relations. Let
r0 = r1 ∩r2.
Then the elements of G are precisely those s ∈S such that
s/r0 = {s},
and for a, b ∈G, arb holds iﬀ
|{c ∈S : ar1c and cr2b} ∪{c ∈S : br1c and cr2a}| = 2.

§5. Semantic Embeddings and Undecidability

A more general notion of a semantic embedding of a structure A into a structure B is
required for some of the more subtle undecidability results, namely the interpretation of the
elements of A as equivalence classes of n-tuples of elements of B. Of course this must all be
done in a ﬁrst-order fashion. For notational convenience we will deﬁne this only for the case
of A a binary structure, but it should be obvious how to formulate it for other structures.
Deﬁnition 5.17. Let A = ⟨A, r⟩be a binary structure, and B a structure of type L. A can
be semantically embedded in B, written A
sem
−−→B, if there are L-formulas, for some n < ω,
∆(x1, . . . , xn)
Φr(x1, . . . , xn; y1, . . ., yn)
Eq(x1, . . . , xn; y1, . . ., yn)
such that if we let
D = {⟨b1, . . . , bn⟩∈Bn : B |= ∆(b1, . . . , bn)}
and if rD is the binary relation
rD = {⟨⃗b,⃗c ⟩∈D × D : B |= Φr(⃗b,⃗c )}
and ≡is the binary relation
≡= {⟨⃗b,⃗c ⟩∈D × D : B |= Eq(⃗b,⃗c )}
then ≡is an equivalence relation on D and we have
⟨A, r⟩∼= ⟨D, rD⟩/ ≡
where
rD/ ≡= {⟨⃗b/ ≡,⃗c/ ≡⟩∈D/ ≡×D/ ≡: rD ∩(⃗b/ ≡×⃗c/ ≡) ̸= ∅}.
A class H of binary structures can be semantically embedded into a class K of structures
of type L, written H
sem
−−→K, if there are formulas ∆, Φr, Eq as above such that for each
structure A in the class H there is a member B of K such that ∆, Φr, Eq provide a semantic
embedding of A into B.
Using our more general notion of semantic embedding we still have the general results
from before, two of which we repeat here for convenience.
Theorem 5.18. (a) The semantic embeddability relation
sem
−−→is transitive.
(b) (Ershov, Rabin). If ﬁnite graphs can be semantically embedded into a class K(c1, . . . , cn),
then the ﬁrst-order theory of K is undecidable.
For the last part of this section we will look at results on Boolean pairs.

280
V Connections with Model Theory
Deﬁnition 5.19. A Boolean pair is a structure ⟨B, B0, ≤⟩where ⟨B, ≤⟩is a Boolean algebra
(i.e., this is a complemented distributive lattice) and B0 is a unary relation which gives a
subalgebra ⟨B0, ≤⟩. The class of all Boolean pairs is called BP.
The Boolean pairs ⟨B, B0, ≤⟩such that ⟨B, ≤⟩is atomic (i.e., every element is a sup of
atoms) and B0 contains all the atoms of ⟨B, ≤⟩form the class BP 1.
The Boolean pairs ⟨B, B0, ≤⟩such that for every element b ∈B there is a least element
b ∈B0 with b ≤b constitute the class BP M.
The Boolean pairs ⟨B, B0, ≤⟩in BP M such that ⟨B, ≤⟩, ⟨B0, ≤⟩are atomic form the class
BP 2.
Deﬁnition 5.20. Let G∗
ﬁn be the class of ﬁnite graphs ⟨G, r⟩such that r ̸= ∅.
Lemma 5.21. Gﬁn
sem

ﬁn(c).
Proof. (Exercise.)

Adapting a technique of Rubin, McKenzie proved the following.
Theorem 5.22 (McKenzie). The theory of BP 2 is undecidable.
Proof. Given a member G = ⟨G, r⟩of G∗
ﬁn let X = G × ω. Two sets Y and Z are said
to be “almost equal,” written Y
a= Z, if Y and Z diﬀer by only ﬁnitely many points. For
g ∈G, let Cg = {⟨g, j⟩: j ∈ω} ⊆X, a “cylinder” of X. Let B be all subsets of X which
are almost equal to a union of cylinders, i.e., all Y such that for some S ⊆G, Y
a= S
g∈S Cg.
Note that ⟨B, ⊆⟩is a Boolean algebra containing all ﬁnite subsets of X.
To deﬁne B0 ﬁrst let
E = {{a, b} : ⟨a, b⟩∈r},
the set of unordered edges of G, and then for each g ∈G choose a surjective map
αg : Cg →E × ω
such that
|α−1
g (⟨e, j⟩)| =

if g ∈e
3
if g ̸∈e.
Then, for ⟨e, j⟩∈E × ω, let
De,j =

g (⟨e, j⟩).
This partitions X into ﬁnite sets De,j such that for g ∈G,
|De,j ∩Cg| =
(
2
if g ∈e
3
if g ̸∈e.

§5. Semantic Embeddings and Undecidability
281
Let B0 be the set of ﬁnite and coﬁnite unions of De,j’s. Note that ⟨B0, ⊆⟩is a subalgebra of
⟨B, ⊆⟩as a Boolean algebra.
Now we want to show ⟨G, r⟩
sem
−−→⟨B, B0, ⊆⟩:
∆(x) is “for all atoms y of B0 there are exactly two or three atoms of B below x ∧y”
Eq(x, y) is ∀z∃u [u is an atom of B0 and there are exactly two or three atoms of B below
x ∧y ∧u and (x ∧y ∧z ∧u ≈0 or x ∧y ∧z′ ∧u ≈0)]
Φr(x, y) is x ̸≈y & ∀u∀v[Eq(u, x) & Eq(v, y) →(for some atom z of B0 there are exactly
two atoms of B below each of u ∧z and v ∧z)].
To see that G
sem
−−→⟨B, B0, ≤⟩it suﬃces to check the following claims:
(a) ⟨B, B0, ≤⟩|= ∆(Z) implies Z
a= Cg for some g ∈G (just recall the description of the
elements of B),
(b) ⟨B, B0, ≤⟩|= ∆(Cg) for g ∈G,
(c) for X, Y such that ∆(X), ∆(Y ) hold we have Eq(X, Y ) iﬀX
a= Y,
(d) for X, Y such that ∆(X), ∆(Y ) hold we have Φr(X, Y ) iﬀX
a= Cg, Y
a= Cg′ for some
g, g′ ∈G with ⟨g, g′⟩∈r,
(e) the mapping g 7→Cg/ ≡establishes G ∼= ⟨D, rD⟩/ ≡.
Thus we have proved

Theorem 5.23 (Rubin). The theory of CA1, the variety of monadic algebras, is undecidable.
Proof. It suﬃces to show BP 2
sem

sem
−−→BP 2(c1). Given ⟨B, B0, ≤⟩∈
BP 2, let c be the unary function deﬁned on the Boolean algebra ⟨B, ≤⟩by
c(b) = the least member of B0 above b.
Then ⟨B, ∨, ∧, ′, c, 0, 1⟩is a monadic algebra, and with
∆(x)
deﬁned as x ≈x
ΦB0(x)
deﬁned as x ≈c(x)
we have, using the old deﬁnition of semantic embedding, ⟨B, B0, ≤⟩

Actually the class BP M deﬁned above is just an alternate description of monadic algebras,
and BP 2 ⊆BP M.
Finally we turn to the class BP 1, a class which has played a remarkable role in the
classiﬁcation of decidable locally ﬁnite congruence modular varieties.
Theorem 5.24 (McKenzie). The theory of BP 1 is undecidable.
Proof. Given a ﬁnite graph ⟨G, r⟩with r ̸= ∅ﬁrst construct ⟨B, B0, ⊆⟩as in 5.22, so B is
a ﬁeld of subsets of X = G × ω. Let π1 be the ﬁrst projection map from X × ω to X, and
deﬁne
B∗= {π−1
1 (Y ) : Y ∈B}
B∗
0 = {π−1
1 (Y ) : Y ∈B0}.
Then
⟨B∗, B∗
0, ⊆⟩∼= ⟨B, B0, ⊆⟩,
and each nonzero member of B∗contains inﬁnitely many points from X × ω. Now let
B∗∗= {Y ⊆X × ω : Y
a= Z for some Z ∈B∗}
B∗∗
0 = {Y ⊆X × ω : Y
a= Z for some Z ∈B∗
0}.
Then ⟨B∗∗, B∗∗
0 , ⊆⟩∈BP 1 as all ﬁnite subsets of X × ω belong to both B∗∗and B∗∗
0 , and
furthermore
⟨B∗∗, B∗∗
0 , ⊆⟩/
a= ∼= ⟨B∗, B∗
0, ⊆⟩.
Now “Y is ﬁnite” can be expressed for Y ∈B∗∗by
∀x[x ≤Y →x ∈B∗∗
0 ]
as every nonzero element b0 of B0 has an element b ∈B −B0 below it. Thus
⟨B∗, B∗
0, ⊆⟩
sem
−−→⟨B∗∗, B∗∗
0 , ⊆⟩;
hence
⟨B, B0, ⊆⟩
sem
−−→⟨B∗∗, B∗∗
0 , ⊆⟩.
This shows
BP 2
sem
−−→BP 1;
hence
Gﬁn
sem
−−→BP 1(c1).

Recent Developments and
Open Problems
At several points in the text we have come very close to some of the most exciting areas
of current research. Now that the reader has had a substantial introduction to universal
algebra, we will survey the current situation in these areas and list a few of the problems
being considered. (This is not a comprehensive survey of recent developments in universal
algebra—the reader will have a good idea of the breadth of the subject if he reads Taylor’s
survey article [35], J´onsson’s report [20], and the appendices to Gr¨atzer’s book [16].)
§1.
The Commutator and the Center
One of the most promising developments has been the creation of the commutator by Smith
[1976]. He showed that, for any algebra A in a congruence-permutable variety, there is a
unique function, [−, −], called the commutator, from (Con A) × (Con A) to Con A with
certain properties. In the case of groups this is just the familiar commutator (when one
considers the corresponding normal subgroups). Rather abruptly, several concepts one had
previously considered to belong exclusively to the study of groups have become available on
a grand scale: viz., solvability, nilpotence, and the center. Hagemann and Herrmann [1979]
subsequently extended the commutator to any algebra in a congruence-modular variety.
Freese and McKenzie [1987] have given another deﬁnition of the commutator, and of course
we used their (ﬁrst-order) deﬁnition of the center (of an arbitrary algebra) in II§13. These
new concepts have already played key roles in Burris and McKenzie [1981] and Freese and
McKenzie [1981],[1987].
Problem 1. For which varieties can we deﬁne a commutator?
Problem 2. Find a description of all A (parallel to II§13.4) such that Z(A) = ∇A.

§2.
The Classiﬁcation of Varieties
Birkhoﬀ’s suggestion in the 1930’s that congruence lattices should be considered as funda-
mental associated structures has proved to be remarkably farsighted. An important early
result was the connection between modular congruence lattices and the unique factorization
property due to Ore [1936]. A major turning point in showing the usefulness of classifying a
variety by the behavior of the congruence lattices was J´onsson’s theorem [1967] that if V (K)
is congruence-distributive, then V (K) = IPSHSPU(K).
The role of a single congruence, the center, is rapidly gaining attention. Let us call a
variety modular Abelian if it is congruence-modular and, for any algebra A in the variety,
Z(A) = ∇A. Such varieties are essentially varieties of unitary left R-modules. A variety V is
said to be (discriminator) ⊗(modular Abelian) if it is congruence modular and there are two
subvarieties V1, V2 such that V1 is a discriminator variety, V2 is a modular Abelian variety,
and V = V1 ∨V2. For such a variety V (see Burris and McKenzie [1981]) each algebra in V
is, up to isomorphism, uniquely decomposable as a product of an algebra from V1 and an
algebra from V2. The importance of this class of varieties is discussed in §3 and §5 below.
The following Hasse diagram (Figure 36) shows some of the most useful classes of varieties
in research.

§3.
Decidability Questions
Decidability problems have been a popular area of investigation in universal algebra, thanks
to the fascinating work of Mal’cev [24] and Tarski [33]. Let us look at several diﬀerent types
of decidability questions being studied.
(a) First-order Theories.
In V§5 we discussed the semantic embedding technique for
proving that theories are undecidable. There has been a long-standing conviction among
researchers in this area that positive decidability and nice structure theory go hand in hand.
The combined eﬀorts of Szmielew [1954], Ershov [1972] and Zamjatin [1978a] show that
a variety of groups is decidable iﬀit is Abelian. This has recently been strengthened by
McKenzie [1982c] as follows: any class of groups containing PS(G), where G can be any
nonabelian group, has an undecidable theory. In Burris and Werner [1979] techniques of
Comer [1975] for cylindric algebras have been extended to prove that every ﬁnitely generated
discriminator variety of ﬁnite type has a decidable theory. Zamjatin [1976] showed that a
variety of rings has a decidable theory iﬀit is generated by a zero-ring and ﬁnitely many ﬁnite
ﬁelds. Recently Burris and McKenzie [1981] have applied the center and commutator to prove
the following: if a locally ﬁnite congruence-modular variety has a decidable theory, then it
must be of the form (discriminator) ⊗(modular Abelian). Indeed there is an algorithm such
that, given a ﬁnite set K of ﬁnite algebras of ﬁnite type, one can decide if V (K) is of this
form, and if so, one can construct a ﬁnite ring R with 1 such that V (K) has a decidable
theory iﬀthe variety of unitary left R-modules has a decidable theory. This leads to an
obvious question.
Problem 3. Which locally ﬁnite varieties of ﬁnite type have a decidable theory?
Zamjatin [1976] has examined the following question for varieties of rings.
Problem 4. For which varieties of ﬁnite type is the theory of the ﬁnite algebras in the variety
decidable?
Actually we know very little about this question, so let us pose two rather special prob-
lems.
Problem 5. Do the ﬁnite algebras in any ﬁnitely generated arithmetical variety of ﬁnite type
have a decidable theory?
Problem 6. Do the ﬁnite algebras in any ﬁnitely generated congruence-distributive, but not
congruence-permutable, variety of ﬁnite type have an undecidable theory?
(b) Equational Theories. Tarski [1953] proved that there is no algorithm for deciding if an
equation holds in all relation algebras (hence the ﬁrst-order theory is certainly undecidable).
Mal’cev [24] showed the same for unary algebras.
Murskiˇı [1968] gave an example of a

286
Recent Developments and Open Problems
ﬁnitely based variety of semigroups with an undecidable equational theory. R. Freese [1979]
has proved that there is no algorithm to decide which equations in at most 5 variables hold
in the variety of modular lattices. From Dedekind’s description (see [3]) of the 28 element
modular lattice freely generated by 3 elements it is clear that one can decide which equations
in at most 3 variables hold in the variety of modular lattices.
Problem 7. Is there an algorithm to decide which equations in at most 4 variables hold in
modular lattices?
(c) Word Problems. Given a variety V of type F, a presentation (of an algebra A) in V
is an ordered pair ⟨G, R⟩of generators G and deﬁning relations R such that the following
hold.
(i) R is a set of equations p(g1, . . . , gn) ≈q(g1, . . . , gn) of type F ∪G (we assume F ∩G = ∅)
with g1, . . . , gn ∈G.
(ii) If ˆV is the variety of type F ∪G deﬁned by Σ ∪R, where Σ is a set of equations deﬁning
V, then A is the reduct (see II§1 Exercise 1) of F ˆV (∅) to the type of V.
When the above holds we write PV (G, R) for A, and say “PV (G, R) is the algebra in V freely
generated by G subject to the relations R.” If R = ∅we just obtain FV (G). A presentation
⟨G, R⟩is ﬁnite if both G and R are ﬁnite, and in such case PV (G, R) is said to be ﬁnitely
presented.
The word problem for a given presentation ⟨G, R⟩in V asks if there is an algorithm to
determine, for any pair of “words,” i.e., terms r(g1, . . . , gn), s(g1, . . . , gn), whether or not
FV (∅) |= r(g1, . . . , gn) ≈s(g1, . . . , gn).
If so, the word problem for ⟨G, R⟩is decidable (or solvable); otherwise it is undecidable (or
unsolvable). The question encountered in (b) above of “which equations in the set of variables
X hold in a variety V ” is often called the word problem for the free algebra FV (X). The word
problem for a given variety V asks if every ﬁnite presentation ⟨G, R⟩in V has a decidable
word problem. If so, the word problem for V is decidable; otherwise it is undecidable.
Markov [1947] and Post [1947] proved that the word problem for semigroups is undecid-
able. (A fascinating introduction to decidability and word problems is given in Trakhtenbrot
[36].)
Perhaps the most celebrated result is the undecidability of the word problem for
groups (Novikov [1955]). A beautiful algebraic characterization of ﬁnitely presented groups
PV (G, R) with solvable word problems is due to Boone and Higman [1974], namely PV (G, R)
has a solvable word problem iﬀit can be embedded in a simple group S which in turn can be
embedded in a ﬁnitely presented group T. This idea has been generalized by Evans [1978]
to the variety of all algebras of an arbitrary type. Other varieties where word problems have
been investigated include loops (Evans [1951]) and modular lattices (Hutchinson [1973], Lip-
schitz [1974] and Freese [1979]). The survey article of Evans [14] is recommended.
Problem 8. Is the word problem for orthomodular lattices decidable?

§4. Boolean Constructions
287
(d) Base Undecidability. This topic has been extensively developed by McNulty [1976]
and Murskiˇı [1971]. The following example suﬃces to explain the subject. Suppose one takes
a ﬁnite set of equations which are true of Boolean algebras and asks: “Do these equations
axiomatize Boolean algebras?” Surprisingly, there is no algorithm to decide this question.
Problem 9. Can one derive the Linial-Post theorem [1949] (that there is no algorithm to de-
termine if a ﬁnite set of tautologies with modus ponens axiomatizes the propo-
sitional calculus) from the above result on Boolean algebras, or vice versa?
(e) Other Undecidable Properties. Markov [26] showed that a number of properties of
ﬁnitely presented semigroups are undecidable, for example there is no algorithm to determine
if the semigroup is trivial, commutative, etc.
Parallel results for groups were obtained
by Rabin [1958]; and McNulty [1976] investigates such questions for arbitrary types. In
[1975] McKenzie shows that the question of whether or not a single groupoid equation has
a nontrivial ﬁnite model is undecidable, and then he derives the delightful result that there
is a certain groupoid equation which will have a nontrivial ﬁnite model iﬀFermat’s Last
Theorem is actually false. For decidability questions concerning whether a quasivariety is
actually a variety see Burris [1982b] and McNulty [1977]. A diﬃcult question is the following.
Problem 10. (Tarski). Is there an algorithm to determine if V (A) has a ﬁnitely based equa-
tional theory, given that A is a ﬁnite algebra of ﬁnite type?
§4.
Boolean Constructions
Comer’s work [1971], [1974], [1975], and [1976] connected with sheaves has inspired a se-
rious development of this construction in universal algebra. Comer was mainly interested
in sheaves over Boolean spaces, and one might say that this construction, which we have
formulated as a Boolean product, bears the same relation to the direct product that the
variety of Boolean algebras bears to the class of power set algebras Su(I). Let us discuss the
role of Boolean constructions in two major results.
The decidability of any ﬁnitely generated discriminator variety of ﬁnite type (Burris and
Werner [1979]) is proved by semantically embedding the countable members of the variety
into countable Boolean algebras with a ﬁxed ﬁnite number of distinguished ﬁlters, and then
applying a result of Rabin [1969].
The semantic embedding is achieved by ﬁrst taking
the Boolean product representation of Keimel and Werner [1974], and then converting this
representation into a better behaved Boolean product called a ﬁltered Boolean power (the
ﬁltered Boolean power is the construction introduced by Arens and Kaplansky in [1948]).
The newest additions to the family of Boolean constructions are the modiﬁed Boolean
powers, introduced by Burris in the fall of 1978. Whereas Boolean products of ﬁnitely many
ﬁnite structures give a well-behaved class of algebras, the modiﬁed Boolean powers give

288
Recent Developments and Open Problems
a uniform method for constructing deviant algebras from a wide range of algebras. This
construction is a highly specialized subdirect power, but not a Boolean product.
The construction is quite easy. Given a ﬁeld B of subsets of a set I, a subﬁeld B0 of B,
an algebra A, and a congruence θ on A, let
A[B, B0, θ]∗= {f ∈AI : f −1(a) ∈B, f −1(a/θ) ∈B0, for a ∈A, and |Rg(f)| < ω}.
This is a subuniverse of AI, and the corresponding subalgebra is what we call the modiﬁed
Boolean power A[B, B0, θ]∗. McKenzie developed a subtle generalization of this construction
in the fall of 1979 for the decidability result of Burris and McKenzie mentioned in §3(a)
above.
His variation proceeds as follows: let B, B0, A and θ be as above, and suppose
A ≤S. Furthermore assume that B0 contains all singletons {i}, for i ∈I. Then the set
A[B, B0, θ, S]∗= {f ∈SI : ∃g ∈A[B, B0, θ]∗with [[f ̸= g]] ﬁnite}
is a subuniverse of SI. The corresponding subalgebra A[B, B0, θ, S]∗is the algebra we want.
§5.
Structure Theory
We have seen two beautiful results on the subject of structure theory, namely the Bulman-
Fleming, Keimel and Werner theorem (IV§9.4) that every discriminator variety can be rep-
resented by Boolean products of simple algebras, and McKenzie’s proof [1982b] that every
directly representable variety is congruence-permutable. McKenzie goes on to show that in
a directly representable variety every directly indecomposable algebra is modular Abelian or
functionally complete.
The deﬁnition of a Boolean product was introduced in Burris and Werner [1979] as a
simpliﬁcation of a construction sometimes called a Boolean sheaf. Subsequently Krauss and
Clark [1979] showed that the general sheaf construction could be described in purely algebraic
terms, reviewed much of the literature on the subject, and posed a number of interesting
problems. Recently Burris and McKenzie [1981] have proved that if a variety V can be
written in the form IΓa(K), with K consisting of ﬁnitely many ﬁnite algebras, then V is of
the form (discriminator) ⊗(modular Abelian); and then they discuss in detail the possibility
of Boolean powers, or ﬁltered Boolean powers, of ﬁnitely many ﬁnite algebras representing
a variety. The paper concludes with an internal characterization of all quasiprimal algebras
A such that the [countable] members of V (A) can be represented as ﬁltered Boolean powers
of A, generalizing the work of Arens and Kaplansky [1948] on ﬁnite ﬁelds.
Let us try to further crystallize the mathematically imprecise question of “which varieties
admit a nice structure theory” by posing some speciﬁc questions.
Problem 11. For which varieties does there exist a bound on the size of the directly inde-
composable members?

§6. Applications to Computer Science
289
Problem 12. For which varieties V is every algebra in V a Boolean product of directly
indecomposable algebras? (Krauss and Clark [1979]) of subdirectly irreducible
algebras? of simple algebras?
Problem 13. For which ﬁnite rings R with 1 is the variety of unitary left R-modules directly
representable?
§6.
Applications to Computer Science
Following Kleene’s beautiful characterization [1956] of languages accepted by ﬁnite state
acceptors and Myhill’s study [1957] of the monoid of a language, considerable work has
been devoted to relating various subclasses of regular languages and the associated class of
monoids. For example Sch¨utzenberger [1965] showed that the class of star-free languages
corresponds to the class of groupfree monoids. For this direction see the books [11], [12] of
Eilenberg, and the problem set and survey of Brzozowski [7], [7a].
§7.
Applications to Model Theory
Comer [1974] formulated a version of the Feferman-Vaught theorem (on ﬁrst-order properties
of direct products) for certain Boolean products, and in Burris and Werner [1979] it is
shown that all of the known variations on the Feferman-Vaught theorem can be derived
from Comer’s version.
Macintyre [1973/74] used sheaf constructions to describe the model companions of certain
classes of rings, and this was generalized somewhat by Comer [1976] and applied to varieties of
monadic algebras. In Burris and Werner [1979] a detailed study is made of model companions
of discriminator varieties, and then the concept of a discriminator formula is introduced to
show that the theorems of Macintyre and Comer are easy consequences of the results on
discriminator varieties. A formula τ(x, y, u, v) is a discriminator formula for a class K of
algebras if it is an existential formula in prenex form such that the matrix is a conjunction
of atomic formulas, and we have
K |= τ(x, y, u, v) ↔[(x ≈y & u ≈v) ∨(x ̸≈y & x ≈v)].
Problem 14. For which varieties V can one ﬁnd a discriminator formula for the subclass of
subdirectly irreducible members?
Problem 15. Which ﬁnite algebras have a discriminator formula?

Recent Developments and Open Problems
§8.
Finite Basis Theorems
In V§4 we looked at the three known general results on the existence of a ﬁnite basis for a va-
riety (i.e., the variety is ﬁnitely axiomatizable). For many years universal algebraists hoped
to amalgamate the Oates-Powell theorem [1965] (that a variety generated by a ﬁnite group
has a ﬁnite basis) with Baker’s theorem (that a ﬁnitely generated congruence-distributive
variety of ﬁnite type has a ﬁnite basis) into one theorem saying that a ﬁnitely generated
congruence-modular variety of ﬁnite type would have a ﬁnite basis. This was shown im-
possible by Polin [1976] who gave an example of a ﬁnitely generated but not ﬁnitely based
(congruence-permutable) variety of nonassociative rings.
Problem 16. Find a common generalization of the Oates-Powell theorem and Baker’s theo-
rem.
§9.
Subdirectly Irreducible Algebras
Let F be a type of algebras, and let κ = |F|+ω. As we have seen in V§3, Taylor [1972] proved
that if a variety V of type F has a subdirectly irreducible algebra of size greater than 2κ then
V has arbitrarily large subdirectly irreducible members. Later McKenzie and Shelah [1974]
proved a parallel result for simple algebras. In V§3 we proved Quackenbush’s result [1971]
that if A is ﬁnite and V (A) has only ﬁnitely many ﬁnite subdirectly irreducible members
(up to isomorphism), then V (A) contains no inﬁnite subdirectly irreducible members. Using
the commutator Freese and McKenzie [1981] proved that a ﬁnitely generated congruence-
modular variety with no inﬁnite subdirectly irreducible members has only ﬁnitely many ﬁnite
subdirectly irreducible members.
Problem 17. (Quackenbush). If a ﬁnitely generated variety has no inﬁnite subdirectly irre-
ducible members, must it have only ﬁnitely many ﬁnite subdirectly irreducible
algebras?
