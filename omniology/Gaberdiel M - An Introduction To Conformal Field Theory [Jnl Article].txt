description of open string theory.
All known consistent string theories can be obtained by compactiﬁcation from a
rather small number of theories. These include the ﬁve diﬀerent supersymmetric string
theories in ten dimensions, as well as a number of non-supersymmetric theories that are
deﬁned in either ten or twenty-six dimensions. The recent advances in string theory have
centered around the idea of duality, namely that these theories are further related in the
sense that the strong coupling regime of one theory is described by the weak coupling
regime of another. A crucial element in these developments has been the realisation that
the solitonic objects that deﬁne the relevant degrees of freedom at strong coupling are
Dirichlet-branes that have an alternative description in terms of open string theory [7].
In fact, the eﬀect of a Dirichlet brane is completely described by adding certain open
string sectors (whose end-points are ﬁxed to lie on the world-volume of the brane) to the
theory. The possible Dirichlet branes of a given string theory are then selected by the
condition that the resulting theory of open and closed strings must be consistent. These
consistency conditions contain (and may be equivalent to) the consistency conditions of
conformal ﬁeld theory on a manifold with a boundary [8–10]. Much of the structure of
the theory that we shall explain in this review article is directly relevant for an analysis
of these questions, although we shall not discuss the actual consistency conditions (and
their solutions) here.
Any review article of a well-developed subject such as conformal ﬁeld theory will
miss out important elements of the theory, and this article is no exception. We have
chosen to present one coherent route through some section of the theory and we shall
not discuss in any detail alternative view points on the subject. The approach that
we have taken is in essence algebraic (although we shall touch upon some questions of
analysis), and is inspired by the work of Goddard [11] as well as the mathematical theory
of vertex operator algebras that was developed by Borcherds [12,13], Frenkel, Lepowsky
& Meurman [14], Frenkel, Huang & Lepowsky [15], Zhu [16], Kac [17] and others. This
algebraic approach will be fairly familiar to many physicists, but we have tried to give
it a somewhat new slant by emphasising the fundamental rˆole of the amplitudes. We
have also tried to explain some of the more recent developments in the mathematical
theory of vertex operator algebras that have so far not been widely appreciated in the
physics community, in particular, the work of Zhu.
There exist in essence two other view points on the subject: a functional analytic
approach in which techniques from algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory [18] are employed and
which has been pioneered by Wassermann [19] and Gabbiani and Fr¨ohlich [20]; and a
geometrical approach that is inspired by string theory (for example the work of Friedan
& Shenker [21]) and that has been put on a solid mathematical foundation by Segal [22]
(see also Huang [23,24]).
We shall also miss out various recent developments of the theory, in particular the
progress in understanding conformal ﬁeld theories on higher genus Riemann surfaces
[25–29], and on surfaces with boundaries [30–35].

Finally, we should mention that a number of treatments of conformal ﬁeld theory
are by now available, in particular the review articles of Ginsparg [36] and Gawedzki [37],
and the book by Di Francesco, Mathieu and S´en´echal [38]. We have attempted to be
somewhat more general, and have put less emphasis on speciﬁc well understood models
such as the minimal models or the WZNW models (although they will be explained in
due course). We have also been more inﬂuenced by the mathematical theory of vertex
operator algebras, although we have avoided to phrase the theory in this language.
The paper is organised as follows. In section 2, we outline the general structure of
the theory, and explain how the various ingredients that will be subsequently described
ﬁt together. Section 3 is devoted to the study of meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory;
this is the part of the theory that describes in essence what is sometimes called the
chiral algebra by physicists, or the vertex operator algebra by mathematicians. We
also introduce the most important examples of conformal ﬁeld theories, and describe
standard constructions such as the coset and orbifold construction. In section 4 we
introduce the concept of a representation of the meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory, and
explain the rˆole of Zhu’s algebra in classifying (a certain class of) such representations.
Section 5 deals with higher correlation functions and fusion rules. We explain Verlinde’s
formula, and give a brief account of the polynomial relations of Moore & Seiberg and
their relation to quantum groups. We also describe logarithmic conformal ﬁeld theories.
We conclude in section 6 with a number of general open problems that deserve, in
our opinion, more work. Finally, we have included an appendix that contains a brief
summary about the diﬀerent deﬁnitions of rationality.
2. The General Structure of a Local Conformal Field Theory
Let us begin by describing somewhat sketchily what the general structure of a local
conformal ﬁeld theory is, and how the various structures that will be discussed in detail
later ﬁt together.
2.1. The Space of States
In essence, a two-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theory (like any other ﬁeld theory) is
determined by its space of states and the collection of its correlation functions. The
space of states is a vector space H
H
H (that may or may not be a Hilbert space), and the
correlation functions are deﬁned for collections of vectors in some dense subspace FFF
of H
H
H. These correlation functions are deﬁned on a two-dimensional space-time, which
we shall always assume to be of Euclidean signature. We shall mainly be interested in
the case where the space-time is a closed compact surface. These surfaces are classiﬁed
(topologically) by their genus g which counts the number of ‘handles’; the simplest such
surface is the sphere with g = 0, the surface with g = 1 is the torus, etc. In a ﬁrst step
we shall therefore consider conformal ﬁeld theories that are deﬁned on the sphere; as we
shall explain later, under certain conditions it is possible to associate to such a theory

Conformal Field Theory

families of theories that are deﬁned on surfaces of arbitrary genus. This is important in
the context of string theory where the perturbative expansion consists of a sum over all
such theories (where the genus of the surface plays the rˆole of the loop order).
One of the special features of conformal ﬁeld theory is the fact that the theory
is naturally deﬁned on a Riemann surface (or complex curve), i.e.
on a surface
that possesses suitable complex coordinates. In the case of the sphere, the complex
coordinates can be taken to be those of the complex plane that cover the sphere except
for the point at inﬁnity; complex coordinates around inﬁnity are deﬁned by means
of the coordinate function γ(z) = 1/z that maps a neighbourhood of inﬁnity to a
neighbourhood of 0. With this choice of complex coordinates, the sphere is usually
referred to as the Riemann sphere, and this choice of complex coordinates is up to some
suitable class of reparametrisations unique. The correlation functions of a conformal
ﬁeld theory that is deﬁned on the sphere are thus of the form
⟨V (ψ1; z1, ¯z1) · · · V (ψn; zn, ¯zn)⟩,
(3)
where V (ψ, z) is the ﬁeld that is associated to the state ψ, ψi ∈FFF ⊂H
H
H, and zi and ¯zi
are complex numbers (or inﬁnity). These correlation functions are assumed to be local,
i.e. independent of the order in which the ﬁelds appear in (3).
One of the properties that makes two-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theories exactly
solvable is the fact that the theory contains a large (inﬁnite-dimensional) symmetry
algebra with respect to which the states in H
H
H fall into representations. This symmetry
algebra is directly related (in a way we shall describe below) to a certain preferred
subspace F0 of FFF that is characterised by the property that the correlation functions
(3) of its states depend only on the complex parameter z, but not on its complex
conjugate ¯z. More precisely, a state ψ ∈FFF is in F0 if for any collection of ψi ∈FFF ⊂H
H
H,
the correlation functions
⟨V (ψ; z, ¯z)V (ψ1; z1, ¯z1) · · · V (ψn; zn, ¯zn)⟩
(4)
do not depend on ¯z. The correlation functions that involve only states in F0 are then
analytic functions on the sphere. These correlation functions deﬁne the meromorphic
(sub)theory [11] that will be the main focus of the next section.§
Similarly, we can consider the subspace of states F 0 that consists of those states
for which the correlation functions of the form (4) do not depend on z. These states
deﬁne an (anti-)meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory which can be analysed by the same
methods as a meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory. The two meromorphic conformal
subtheories encode all the information about the symmetries of the theory, and for the
most interesting class of theories, the so-called ﬁnite or rational theories, the whole
theory can be reconstructed from them up to some ﬁnite ambiguity. In essence, this
means that the whole theory is determined by symmetry considerations alone, and this
is at the heart of the solvability of the theory.
§ Our use of the term meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is diﬀerent from that employed by, e.g.,
Schellekens [39].

The correlation functions of the theory determine the operator product expansion
(OPE) of the conformal ﬁelds which expresses the operator product of two ﬁelds in
terms of a sum of single ﬁelds. If ψ1 and ψ2 are two arbitrary states in FFF then the OPE
of ψ1 and ψ2 is an expansion of the form
V (ψ1; z1, ¯z1)V (ψ2; z2, ¯z2)
=
X
i
(z1 −z2)∆i(¯z1 −¯z2)
¯∆i X
r,s≥0
V (φi
r,s; z2, ¯z2)(z1 −z2)r(¯z1 −¯z2)s ,
(5)
where ∆i and ¯∆i are real numbers, r, s ∈IN and φi
r,s ∈FFF. The actual form of this
expansion can be read oﬀfrom the correlation functions of the theory since the identity
(5) has to hold in all correlation functions, i.e.
D
V (ψ1; z1, ¯z1)V (ψ2; z2, ¯z2)V (φ1; w1, ¯w1) · · · V (φn; wn, ¯wn)
E
=
X
i
(z1 −z2)∆i(¯z1 −¯z2)
¯∆i X
r,s≥0
(z1 −z2)r(¯z1 −¯z2)s
D
V (φi
r,s; z2, ¯z2)V (φ1; w1, ¯w1) · · · V (φn; wn, ¯wn)
E
(6)
for all φj ∈FFF. If both states ψ1 and ψ2 belong to the meromorphic subtheory F0, (6)
only depends on zi, and φi
r,s also belongs to the meromorphic subtheory F0. The OPE
therefore deﬁnes a certain product on the meromorphic ﬁelds. Since the product involves
the complex parameters zi in a non-trivial way, it does not directly deﬁne an algebra;
the resulting structure is usually called a vertex (operator) algebra in the mathematical
literature [12,14], and we shall adopt this name here as well.
By virtue of its deﬁnition in terms of (6), the operator product expansion is
associative, i.e.

V (ψ1; z1, ¯z1)V (ψ2; z2, ¯z2)

V (ψ3; z3, ¯z3) = V (ψ1; z1, ¯z1)

V (ψ2; z2, ¯z2)V (ψ3; z3, ¯z3)

,
(7)
where the brackets indicate which OPE is evaluated ﬁrst. If we consider the case where
both ψ1 and ψ2 are meromorphic ﬁelds (i.e. in F0), then the associativity of the OPE
implies that the states in FFF form a representation of the vertex operator algebra. The
same also holds for the vertex operator algebra associated to the anti-meromorphic
ﬁelds, and we can thus decompose the whole space FFF (or H
H
H) as
H
H
H =
M
(j,¯)
H
H
H(j,¯) ,
(8)
where each H
H
H(j,¯) is an (indecomposable) representation of the two vertex operator
algebras.
Finite theories are characterised by the property that only ﬁnitely many
indecomposable representations of the two vertex operator algebras occur in (8).
2.2. Modular Invariance
The decomposition of the space of states in terms of representations of the two vertex
operator algebras throws considerable light on the problem of whether the theory is well-
deﬁned on higher Riemann surfaces. One necessary constraint for this (which is believed

Conformal Field Theory

also to be suﬃcient [40]) is that the vacuum correlator on the torus is independent of its
parametrisation. Every two-dimensional torus can be described as the quotient space of
IR2 ≃C by the relations z ∼z + w1 and z ∼z + w2, where w1 and w2 are not parallel.
The complex structure of the torus is invariant under rotations and rescalings of C, and
therefore every torus is conformally equivalent to (i.e. has the same complex structure
as) a torus for which the relations are z ∼z + 1 and z ∼z + τ, and τ is in the upper
half plane of C. It is also easy to see that τ, T(τ) = τ + 1 and S(τ) = −1/τ describe
conformally equivalent tori; the two maps T and S generate the group SL(2, Z)/Z2 that
consists of matrices of the form
A =
 
a
b
c
d
!
where
a, b, c, d ∈Z ,
ad −bc = 1 ,
(9)
and the matrices A and −A have the same action on τ,
τ 7→Aτ = aτ + b
cτ + d .
(10)
The parameter τ is sometimes called the modular parameter of the torus, and the group
SL(2, Z)/Z2 is called the modular group (of the torus).
Given a conformal ﬁeld theory that is deﬁned on the Riemann sphere, the vacuum
correlator on the torus can be determined as follows. First, we cut the torus along one
of its non-trivial cycles; the resulting surface is a cylinder (or an annulus) whose shape
depends on one complex parameter q. Since the annulus is a subset of the sphere, the
conformal ﬁeld theory on the annulus is determined in terms of the theory on the sphere.
In particular, the states that can propagate in the annulus are precisely the states of
the theory as deﬁned on the sphere.
In order to reobtain the torus from the annulus, we have to glue the two ends of
the annulus together; in terms of conformal ﬁeld theory this means that we have to sum
over a complete set of states. The vacuum correlator on the torus is therefore described
by a trace over the whole space of states, the partition function of the theory,
X
(j,¯)
TrH
H
H(j,¯) (O(q, ¯q)) ,
(11)
where O(q, ¯q) is the operator that describes the propagation of the states along the
annulus,
O(q, ¯q) = qL0−c
24 ¯q
¯L0−¯c
24 .
(12)
Here L0 and ¯L0 are the scaling operators of the two vertex operator algebras and c and
¯c their central charges; this will be discussed in more detail in the following section.
The propagator depends on the actual shape of the annulus that is described in terms
of the complex parameter q. For a given torus that is described by τ, there is a natural
choice for how to cut the torus into an annulus, and the complex parameter q that is
associated to this annulus is q = e2πiτ. Since the tori that are described by τ and Aτ
(where A ∈SL(2, Z)) are equivalent, the vacuum correlator is only well-deﬁned provided
that (11) is invariant under this transformation. This provides strong constraints on
the spectrum of the theory.

For most conformal ﬁeld theories (although not for all, see for example [41]) each
of the spaces H
H
H(j,¯) is a tensor product of an irreducible representation Hj of the
meromorphic vertex operator algebra and an irreducible representation ¯H¯of the anti-
meromorphic vertex operator algebra. In this case, the vacuum correlator on the torus
(11) takes the form
X
(j,¯)
χj(q) ¯χ¯(¯q) ,
(13)
where χj is the character of the representation Hj of the meromorphic vertex operator
algebra,
χj(τ) = TrHj(qL0−c
24)
where
q = e2πiτ ,
(14)
and likewise for ¯χ¯. One of the remarkable facts about many vertex operator algebras
(that has now been proven for a certain class of them [16], see also [42]) is the property
that the characters transform into one another under modular transformations,
χj(−1/τ) =
X
k
Sjk χk(τ)
and
χj(τ + 1) =
X
k
Tjk χk(τ) ,
(15)
where S and T are constant matrices, i.e. independent of τ. In this case, writing
H
H
H =
M
i,¯
Mi¯Hi ⊗¯H¯,
(16)
where Mi¯∈IN denotes the multiplicity with which the tensor product Hi ⊗¯H¯appears
in H
H
H, the torus vacuum correlation function is well deﬁned provided that
X
i,¯
SilMi¯¯S¯¯k =
X
i,¯
TilMi¯¯T¯¯k = Ml¯k ,
(17)
and ¯S and ¯T are the matrices deﬁned as in (15) for the representations of the anti-
meromorphic vertex operator algebra. This provides very powerful constraints for the
multiplicity matrices Mi¯. In particular, in the case of a ﬁnite theory (for which each of
the two vertex operator algebras has only ﬁnitely many irreducible representations) these
conditions typically only allow for a ﬁnite number of solutions that can be classiﬁed;
this has been done for the case of the so-called minimal models and the aﬃne theories
with group SU(2) by Cappelli, Itzykson and Zuber [43,44] (for a modern proof involving
some Galois theory see [45]), and for the aﬃne theories with group SU(3) and the N = 2
superconformal minimal models by Gannon [46,47].
This concludes our brief overview over the general structure of a local conformal
ﬁeld theory. For the rest of the paper we shall mainly concentrate on the theory that is
deﬁned on the sphere. Let us begin by analysing the meromorphic conformal subtheory
in some detail.

3. Meromorphic Conformal Field Theory
In this section we shall describe in detail the structure of a meromorphic conformal
ﬁeld theory; our exposition follows closely the work of Goddard [11] and Gaberdiel &
Goddard [48], and we refer the reader for some of the mathematical details (that shall
be ignored in the following) to these papers.
3.1. Amplitudes and M¨obius Covariance
As we have explained above, a meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is determined in
terms of its space of states H0, and the amplitudes involving arbitrary elements ψi in a
dense subspace F0 of H0. Indeed, for each state ψ ∈F0, there exists a vertex operator
V (ψ, z) that creates the state ψ from the vacuum (in a sense that will be described
in more detail shortly), and the amplitudes are the vacuum expectation values of the
corresponding product of vertex operators,
A(ψ1, . . ., ψn; z1, . . ., zn) = ⟨V (ψ1, z1) · · · V (ψn, zn)⟩.
(18)
Each vertex operator V (ψ, z) depends linearly on ψ, and the amplitudes are meromor-
phic functions that are deﬁned on the Riemann sphere P = C ∪{∞}, i.e. they are
analytic except for possible poles at zi = zj, i ̸= j. The operators are furthermore
assumed to be local in the sense that for z ̸= ζ
V (ψ, z)V (φ, ζ) = ε V (φ, ζ)V (ψ, z) ,
(19)
where ε = −1 if both ψ and φ are fermionic, and ε = +1 otherwise. In formulating (19)
we have assumed that ψ and φ are states of deﬁnite fermion number; more precisely,
this means that F0 decomposes as
F0 = F B
0 ⊕F F
0 ,
(20)
where F B
0 and F F
0 is the subspace of bosonic and fermionic states, respectively, and that
both ψ and φ are either in F B
0 or in F F
0 . In the following we shall always only consider
states of deﬁnite fermion number.
In terms of the amplitudes, the locality condition (19) is equivalent to the property
that
A(ψ1, . . . , ψi, ψi+1, . . ., ψn; z1, . . ., zi, zi+1, . . . , zn)
= εi,i+1A(ψ1, . . ., ψi+1, ψi, . . ., ψn; z1, . . . , zi+1, zi, . . ., zn) ,
(21)
and εi,i+1 is deﬁned as above. As the amplitudes are essentially independent of the order
of the ﬁelds, we shall sometimes also write them as
A(ψ1, . . ., ψn; z1, . . ., zn) = ⟨
n
Y
i=1
V (ψi, zi)⟩.
(22)

Conformal Field Theory
11
We may assume that F0 contains a (bosonic) state Ωthat has the property that its
vertex operator V (Ω, z) is the identity operator; in terms of the amplitudes this means
that
⟨V (Ω, z)
n
Y
i=1
V (ψi, zi)⟩= ⟨
n
Y
i=1
V (ψi, zi)⟩.
(23)
We call Ωthe vacuum (state) of the theory. Given Ω, the state ψ ∈F0 that is associated
to the vertex operator V (ψ, z) can then be deﬁned as
ψ = V (ψ, 0)Ω.
(24)
In conventional quantum ﬁeld theory, the states of the theory transform in a
suitable way under the Poincar´e group, and the amplitudes are therefore covariant under
Poincar´e transformations. In the present context, the rˆole of the Poincar´e group is played
by the group of M¨obius transformations M, i.e. the group of (complex) automorphisms
of the Riemann sphere. These are the transformations of the form
z 7→γ(z) = az + b
cz + d ,
where
a, b, c, d ∈C ,
ad −bc = 1 .
(25)
We can associate to each element
A =
 
a
b
c
d
!
∈SL(2,C) ,
(26)
the M¨obius transformation (25), and since A ∈SL(2,C) and −A ∈SL(2,C) deﬁne the
same M¨obius transformation, the group of M¨obius transformations M is isomorphic
to M ∼= SL(2,C)/Z2. In the following we shall sometimes use elements of SL(2,C) to
denote the corresponding elements of M where no confusion will result.
It is convenient to introduce a set of generators for M by
eλL−1(z) = z + λ,
eλL0(z) = eλz,
eλL1(z) =
z
1 −λz ,
(27)
where the ﬁrst transformation is a translation, the second is a scaling, and the
last one is usually referred to as a special conformal transformation.
Every M¨obius
transformation can be obtained as a composition of these transformations, and for
M¨obius transformations with d ̸= 0, this can be compactly described as
γ = exp
 b
dL−1

d−2L0 exp

−c
dL1

(28)
where γ is given as in (25). In terms of SL(2,C), the three transformations in (27) are

They form a basis for the Lie algebra sl(2,C) of SL(2,C), and satisfy the commutation
relations
[Lm, Ln] = (m −n)Lm+n,
m, n = 0, ±1 .
(31)
As in conventional quantum ﬁeld theory, the states of the meromorphic theory
form a representation of this algebra which can be decomposed into irreducible
representations. The (irreducible) representations that are relevant in physics are those
that satisfy the condition of positive energy.
In the present context, since L0 (the
operator associated to L0) can be identiﬁed with the energy operator (up to some
constant), these are those representations for which the spectrum of L0 is bounded from
below. This will follow from the cluster property of the amplitudes that will be discussed
below. In a given irreducible highest weight representation, let us denote by ψ the state
for which L0 takes the minimal value, h say.∥Using (31) we then have
L0L1ψ = [L0, L1]ψ + hL1ψ = (h −1)L1ψ ,
(32)
where Ln denotes the operator corresponding to Ln.
Since ψ is the state with the
minimal value for L0, it follows that L1ψ = 0; states with the property
L1ψ = 0
L0ψ = hψ
(33)
are called quasiprimary, and the real number h is called the conformal weight of ψ.
Every quasiprimary state ψ generates a representation of sl(2,C) that consists of the
L−1-descendants (of ψ), i.e. the states of the form Ln
−1ψ where n = 0, 1, . . ..
This
inﬁnite-dimensional representation is irreducible unless h is a non-positive half-integer.
Indeed,
L1Ln

(h + n −1 −l)Ln−1
−1 ψ
(35)
= 2n(h + 1
2(n −1))Ln−1
−1 ψ ,
(36)
and thus if h is a non-positive half-integer, the state Ln
−1ψ with n = 1 −2h and its L−1-
descendants deﬁne a subrepresentation. In order to obtain an irreducible representation
one has to quotient the space of L−1-descendants of ψ by this subrepresentation; the
resulting irreducible representation is then ﬁnite-dimensional.
Since the states of the theory carry a representation of the M¨obius group, the
amplitudes transform covariantly under M¨obius transformations. The transformation
rule for general states is quite complicated (we shall give an explicit formula later on), but
for quasiprimary states it can be easily described: let ψi, i = 1, . . . , n be n quasiprimary
states with conformal weights hi, i = 1, . . . , n, then

where γ is a M¨obius transformation as in (25).
Let us denote the operators that implement the M¨obius transformations on the
space of states by the same symbols as in (27) with Ln replaced by Ln.
Then the
transformation formulae for the vertex operators are given as
eλL−1V (ψ, z)e−λL−1 = V (ψ, z + λ)
(38)
xL0 V (ψ, z)x−L0
= xh V (ψ, xz)
(39)
eµL1V (ψ, z)e−µL1
= (1 −µz)−2hV (ψ, z/(1 −µz)) ,
(40)
where ψ is quasiprimary with conformal weight h. We also write more generally
DγV (ψ, z)D−1
γ
=

γ′(z)
h
V

ψ, γ(z)

,
(41)
where Dγ is given by the same formula as in (28). In this notation we then have
DγΩ= Ω
(42)
for all γ; this is equivalent to LnΩ= 0 for n = 0, ±1. The transformation formula for the
vertex operator associated to a quasiprimary ﬁeld ψ is consistent with the identiﬁcation
of states and ﬁelds (24) and the deﬁnition of a quasiprimary state (33): indeed, if we
apply (39) and (40) to the vacuum, use (42) and set z = 0, we obtain
xL0ψ = xhψ
and
eµL1ψ = ψ
(43)
which implies that L1ψ = 0 and L0ψ = hψ, and is thus in agreement with (33).
The M¨obius symmetry constrains the functional form of all amplitudes, but in the
case of the one-, two- and three-point functions it actually determines their functional
dependence completely. If ψ is a quasiprimary state with conformal weight h, then
⟨V (ψ, z)⟩is independent of z because of the translation symmetry, but it follows from
(39) that
⟨V (ψ, z)⟩= λh⟨V (ψ, λz)⟩.
(44)
The one-point function can therefore only be non-zero if h = 0. Under the assumption
of the cluster property to be discussed in the next subsection, the only state with h = 0
is the vacuum, ψ = Ω.
If ψ and φ are two quasiprimary states with conformal weights hψ and hφ,
respectively, then the translation symmetry implies that
⟨V (ψ, z)V (φ, ζ)⟩= ⟨V (ψ, z −ζ)V (φ, 0)⟩= F(z −ζ) ,
(45)
and the scaling symmetry gives
λhψ+hφF(λx) = F(x) ,
(46)
so that
F(x) = Cx−hψ−hφ ,
(47)
where C is some constant. On the other hand, the symmetry under special conformal
transformations implies that
⟨V (ψ, x)V (φ, 0)⟩= (1 −µx)−2hψ⟨V (ψ, x/(1 −µx))V (φ, 0)⟩,
(48)

and therefore, upon comparison with (47), the amplitude can only be non-trivial if
2hψ = hψ + hφ, i.e. hψ = hφ. In this case the amplitude is of the form
⟨V (ψ, z)V (φ, ζ)⟩= C(z −ζ)−2hψ .
(49)
If the amplitude is non-trivial for ψ = φ, the locality condition implies that h ∈Z if ψ
is a bosonic ﬁeld, and h ∈1
2 + Z if ψ is fermionic. This is the familiar Spin-Statistics
Theorem.
Finally, if ψi are quasiprimary ﬁelds with conformal weights hi, i = 1, 2, 3, then
⟨V (ψ1, z1)V (ψ2, z2)V (ψ3, z3)⟩=
Y

⟨V (ψ1, a1)V (ψ2, a2)V (ψ3, a3)⟩,
(50)
where h12 = h1 + h2 −h3, etc., and ai are three distinct arbitrary constants. In deriving
(50) we have used the fact that every three points can be mapped to any other three
points by means of a M¨obius transformation.
3.2. The Uniqueness Theorem
It follows directly from (38), (42) and (24) that
V (ψ, z)Ω= ezL−1V (ψ, 0)Ω= ezL−1ψ .
(51)
If V (ψ, z) is in addition local, i.e. if it satisﬁes (19) for every φ, V (ψ, z) is uniquely
characterised by this property; this is the content of the
Uniqueness Theorem [11]: If Uψ(z) is a local vertex operator that satisﬁes
Uψ(z)Ω= ezL−1ψ
(52)
then
Uψ(z) = V (ψ, z)
(53)
on a dense subspace of H0.
Proof: Let χ ∈F0 be arbitrary. Then
Uψ(z)χ = Uψ(z)V (χ, 0)Ω= εχ,ψV (χ, 0)Uψ(z)Ω= εχ,ψV (χ, 0)ezL−1ψ , (54)
where we have used the locality of Uψ(z) and (52) and εχ,ψ denotes the sign in (19). We
can then use (51) and the locality of V (ψ, z) to rewrite this as
εχ,ψV (χ, 0)ezL−1ψ = εχ,ψV (χ, 0)V (ψ, z)Ω= V (ψ, z)V (χ, 0)Ω= V (ψ, z)χ ,
(55)
and thus the action of Uψ(z) and V (ψ, z) agrees on the dense subspace F0.
Given the uniqueness theorem, we can now deduce the transformation property of
a general vertex operator under M¨obius transformations

In the special case where ψ is quasiprimary, exp(γ′′(z)/2γ′(z)L1)ψ = ψ, and (56) reduces
to (41). To prove (56), we observe that the uniqueness theorem implies that it is suﬃcient
to evaluate the identity on the vacuum, in which case it becomes
DγezL−1ψ = eγ(z)L−1(cz + d)−2L0e−

together with the fact that M ∼= SL(2,C)/Z2.
We can now also deduce the behaviour under inﬁnitesimal transformations from
(56). For example, if γ is an inﬁnitesimal translation, γ(z) = z + δ, then to ﬁrst order
in δ, (56) becomes
V (ψ, z) + δ[L−1, V (ψ, z)] = V (ψ, z) + δdV
dz (ψ, z) ,
(60)
from which we deduce that
[L−1, V (ψ, z)] = dV
dz (ψ, z) .
(61)
Similarly, we ﬁnd that
[L0, V (ψ, z)] = z d
dzV (ψ, z) + V (L0ψ, z) ,
(62)
and
[L1, V (ψ, z)] = z2 d
dz V (ψ, z) + 2zV (L0ψ, z) + V (L1ψ, z) .
(63)
If ψ is quasiprimary of conformal weight h, the last three equations can be compactly
written as
[Ln, V (ψ, z)] = zn

z d
dz + (n + 1)h

V (ψ, z)
for n = 0, ±1.
(64)
Finally, applying (61) to the vacuum we have
ezL−1L−1ψ = ezL−1 dV
dz (ψ, 0)Ω,
(65)
and this implies, using the uniqueness theorem, that
dV
dz (ψ, z) = V (L−1ψ, z) .
(66)
In particular, it follows that the correlation functions of L−1-descendants of quasi-
primary states can be directly deduced from those that only involve the quasiprimary
states themselves.

3.3. Factorisation and the Cluster Property
As we have explained above, a meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is determined by
its space of states H0 together with the set of amplitudes that are deﬁned for arbitrary
elements in a dense subspace F0 of H0. The amplitudes contain all relevant information
about the vertex operators; for example the locality and M¨obius transformation
properties of the vertex operators follow from the corresponding properties of the
amplitudes (21), and (37).
In practice, this is however not a good way to deﬁne a conformal ﬁeld theory,
since H0 is always inﬁnite-dimensional (unless the meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory
consists only of the vacuum), and it is unwieldy to give the correlation functions for
arbitrary combinations of elements in an inﬁnite-dimensional (dense) subspace F0 of
H0. Most (if not all) theories of interest however possess a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace
V ⊂H0 that is not dense in H0 but that generates H0 in the sense that H0 and all its
amplitudes can be derived from those only involving states in V ; this process is called
factorisation.
The basic idea of factorisation is very simple: given the amplitudes involving states
in V , we can deﬁne the vector space that consists of linear combinations of states of the
form
Ψ = V (ψ1, z1) · · · V (ψn, zn)Ω,
(67)
where ψi ∈V , and zi ̸= zj for i ̸= j. We identify two such states if their diﬀerence
vanishes in all amplitudes (involving states in V ), and denote the resulting vector space
by b
F0. We then say that V generates H0 if b
F0 is dense in H0. Finally we can introduce
a vertex operator for Ψ by
V (Ψ, z) = V (ψ1, z1 + z) · · · V (ψn, zn + z) ,
(68)
and the amplitudes involving arbitrary elements in b
F0 are thus determined in terms of
those that only involve states in V . (More details of this construction can be found
in [48].) In the following, when we shall give examples of meromorphic conformal ﬁeld
theories, we shall therefore only describe the theory associated to a suitable generating
space V .
It is easy to check that the locality and M¨obius transformation properties of the
amplitudes involving only states in V are suﬃcient to guarantee the corresponding
properties for the amplitudes involving arbitrary states in b
F0, and therefore for the
conformal ﬁeld theory that is obtained by factorisation from V . However, the situation
is more complicated with respect to the condition that the states in H0 are of positive
energy, i.e. that the spectrum of L0 is bounded from below, since this clearly does
not follow from the condition that this is so for the states in V . In the case of the
meromorphic theory the relevant spectrum condition is actually slightly stronger in
that it requires that the spectrum of L0 is non-negative, and that there exists a unique
state, the vacuum, with L0 = 0. This stronger condition (which we shall always assume
from now on) is satisﬁed for the meromorphic theory obtained by factorisation from V

Conformal Field Theory
17
provided the amplitudes in V satisfy the cluster property; this states that if we separate
the variables of an amplitude into two sets and scale one set towards a ﬁxed point (e.g.
0 or ∞) the behaviour of the amplitude is dominated by the product of two amplitudes,
corresponding to the two sets of variables, multiplied by an appropriate power of the
separation, speciﬁcally

where φi, ψj ∈V have conformal weight h′
i and hj, respectively. (Here ∼means that
the two sides of the equation agree up to terms of lower order in λ.) Because of the
M¨obius covariance of the amplitudes this is equivalent to

To prove that this implies that the spectrum of L0 is non-negative and that the
vacuum is unique, let us introduce the projection operators deﬁned by
PN =
I
0
uL0−N−1du,
for N ∈Z/2 ,
(70)
where we have absorbed a factor of 1/2πi into the deﬁnition of the symbol

In

V (ψj, zj)Ω=

and so P0Ψ = Ω⟨Ψ⟩. Thus the cluster decomposition property implies that PN = 0 for
N < 0, i.e. that the spectrum of L0 is non-negative, and that Ωis the unique state with
L0 = 0. The cluster property also implies that the space of states can be completely
decomposed into irreducible representations of the Lie algebra sl(2,C) that corresponds
to the M¨obius transformations (see Appendix D of [48]).

3.4. The Operator Product Expansion
One of the most important consequences of the uniqueness theorem is that it allows
for a direct derivation of the duality relation which in turn gives rise to the operator
product expansion.
Duality Theorem [11]: Let ψ and φ be states in F0, then
V (ψ, z)V (φ, ζ) = V

V (ψ, z −ζ)φ, ζ

.
(76)
Proof: By the uniqueness theorem it is suﬃcient to evaluate both sides on the vacuum,
in which case (76) becomes
V (ψ, z)V (φ, ζ)Ω= V (ψ, z)eζL−1φ
(77)
= eζL−1V (ψ, z −ζ)φ
(78)
= V

V (ψ, z −ζ)φ, ζ

Ω,
(79)
where we have used (38).
For many purposes it is convenient to expand the ﬁelds V (ψ, z) in terms of modes
V (ψ, z) =
X
n∈Z−h
Vn(ψ)z−n−h ,
(80)
where ψ has conformal weight h, i.e. L0ψ = hψ. The modes can be deﬁned in terms of
a contour integral as
Vn(ψ) =
I
zh+n−1V (ψ, z)dz ,
(81)
where the contour encircles z = 0 anticlockwise. In terms of the modes the identity
V (ψ, 0)Ω= ψ implies that
V−h(ψ)Ω= ψ
and
Vl(ψ)Ω= 0
for l > −h.
(82)
Furthermore, if ψ is quasiprimary, (64) becomes
[Lm, Vn(ψ)] = (m(h −1) −n) Vm+n(ψ)
m = 0, ±1.
(83)
Actually, the equations for m = 0, −1 do not require that ψ is quasiprimary as follows
from (61) and (62); thus we have that [L0, Vn(ψ)] = −nVn(ψ) for all ψ, so that Vn(ψ)
lowers the eigenvalue of L0 by n.
Given the modes of the conformal ﬁelds, we can introduce the Fock space e
F0 that
is spanned by eigenstates of L0 and that forms a dense subspace of the space of states.
This space consists of ﬁnite linear combinations of vectors of the form
Ψ = Vn1(ψ1)Vn2(ψ2) · · · VnN (ψN)Ω,
(84)
where ni + hi ∈Z, hi is the conformal weight of ψi, and we may restrict ψi to be in the
subspace V that generates the whole theory by factorisation. Because of (83) Ψ is an
eigenvector of L0 with eigenvalue
L0Ψ = hψ
where h = −PN
i=1 ni.
(85)

Conformal Field Theory
19
The Fock space e
F0 is a quotient space of the vector space W0 whose basis is given by the
states of the form (84); the subspace by which W0 has to be divided consists of linear
combinations of states of the form (84) that vanish in all amplitudes.
We can also introduce a vertex operator for Ψ by the formula
V (Ψ, z) =
I
C1
zh1+n1−1
1
V (ψ1, z + z1)dz1 · · ·
I
CN
zhN +nN −1
N
V (ψN, z + zN)dzN ,
(86)
where the Cj are contours about 0 with |zi| > |zj| if i < j. The Fock space e
F0 thus
satisﬁes the conditions that we have required of the dense subspace F0, and we may
therefore assume that F0 is actually the Fock space of the theory; from now on we shall
always do so.
The duality property of the vertex operators can now be rewritten in terms of
modes as
V (φ, z)V (ψ, ζ) = V (V (φ, z −ζ)ψ, ζ)
=
X
n≤hψ
V (Vn(φ)ψ, ζ)(z −ζ)−n−hφ ,
(87)
where L0ψ = hψψ and L0φ = hφφ, and ψ, φ ∈F0. The sum over n is bounded by hψ,
since L0Vn(φ)ψ = (hψ −n)Vn(φ)ψ, and the spectrum condition implies that the theory
does not contain any states of negative conformal weight. The equation (87) is known
as the Operator Product Expansion. The inﬁnite sum converges provided that all other
meromorphic ﬁelds in a given amplitude are further away from ζ than z.
We can use (87) to derive a formula for the commutation relations of modes as
follows.¶ The commutator of two modes Vm(φ) and Vn(ψ) is given as
[Vm(Φ), Vn(Ψ)] =
I
dz
I
dζ
|z|>|ζ|
zm+hφ−1ζn+hψ −1V (φ, z)V (ψ, ζ)
−
I
dz
I
dζ
|ζ|>|z|
zm+hφ−1ζn+hψ −1V (φ, z)V (ψ, ζ)
(88)
where the contours on the right-hand side encircle the origin anti-clockwise. We can
then deform the two contours so as to rewrite (88) as
[Vm(φ), Vn(ψ)] =
I
0
ζn+hψ −1dζ
I
ζ
zm+hφ−1dz
X
l
V (Vl(φ)ψ, ζ)(z −ζ)−l−hφ ,
(89)
where the z contour is a small positive circle about ζ and the ζ contour is a positive
circle about the origin. Only terms with l ≥1−hφ contribute, and the integral becomes
[Vm(φ), Vn(ψ)] =
hψ
X
N=−hφ+1
 
m + hφ −1
m −N
!
Vm+n(VN(φ)ψ) .
(90)
In particular, if m ≥−hφ + 1, n ≥−hψ + 1, then m −N ≥0 in the sum, and
m + n ≥N + n ≥N −hψ + 1. This implies that the modes {Vm(ψ) : m ≥−hψ + 1}
¶ To be precise, the following construction a priori only deﬁnes a Lie bracket for the quotient space of
modes where we identify modes whose action on the Fock space of the meromorphic theory coincides.

Conformal Field Theory
20
close as a Lie algebra. The same also holds for the modes {Vm(ψ) : m ≤hψ −1}, and
therefore for their intersection
L0 = {Vn(ψ) : −hψ + 1 ≤n ≤hψ −1} .
(91)
This algebra is sometimes called the vacuum-preserving algebra since any element in L0
annihilates the vacuum. A certain deformation of L0 deﬁnes a ﬁnite Lie algebra that can
be interpreted as describing the ﬁnite W-symmetry of the conformal ﬁeld theory [49].
It is also clear that the subset of all positive, all negative or all zero modes form closed
Lie algebras, respectively.
3.5. The Inner Product and Null-vectors
We can deﬁne an (hermitian) inner product on the Fock space F0 provided that the
amplitudes are hermitian in the following sense: there exists an antilinear involution
ψ 7→ψ for each ψ ∈F0 such that the amplitudes satisfy
 
⟨

Y
i=1
V (ψi, zi)⟩
!∗
= ⟨

i=1
V (ψi, ¯zi)⟩.
(92)
If this condition is satisﬁed, we can deﬁne an inner product by

(93)
This inner product is hermitian, i.e.
⟨ψ, φ⟩∗= ⟨φ, ψ⟩
(94)
since (92) implies that the left-hand-side of (94) is

(98)
Since ψ 7→¯ψ is an involution, we can choose a basis of real states, i.e. states that satisfy
¯ψ = ψ. If ψ is a quasiprimary real state, then (97) simpliﬁes to

(100)
By a similar calculation it also follows that the adjoint of the M¨obius generators are
given as
L†
±1 = L∓1
L†
0 = L0 .
(101)
All known conformal ﬁeld theories satisfy (92) and thus possess a hermitian inner
product; from now on we shall therefore sometimes assume that the theory has such an
inner product.
The inner product can be extended to the vector space W0 whose basis is given by
the states of the form (84). Typically, the inner product is degenerate on W0, i.e. there
exist vectors N ∈W0 for which
⟨ψ, N⟩= 0
for all ψ ∈W0.
(102)
Every vector with this property is called a null-vector. Because of M¨obius covariance, the
ﬁeld corresponding to N vanishes in all amplitudes, and therefore N is in the subspace
by which W0 has to be divided in order to obtain the Fock space F0. Since this is the
case for every null-vector of W0, it follows that the inner product is non-degenerate on
F0.
In general, the inner product may not be positive deﬁnite, but there exist many
interesting theories for which it is; in this case the theory is called unitary. For unitary
theories, the spectrum of L0 is always bounded by 0. To see this we observe that if ψ is
a quasiprimary state with conformal weight h, then
⟨L−1ψ, L−1ψ⟩= ⟨ψ, L1L−1ψ⟩
= 2h⟨ψ, ψ⟩,
(103)
where we have used (101). If the theory is unitary then both sides of (103) have to be
non-negative, and thus h ≥0.
3.6. Conformal Structure
Up to now we have described what could be called ‘meromorphic ﬁeld theory’ rather
than ‘meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory’ (and that is, in the mathematical literature,
sometimes referred to as a vertex algebra, rather than a vertex operator algebra). Indeed,
we have not yet discussed the conformal symmetry of the correlation functions but only
its M¨obius symmetry. A large part of the structure that we shall discuss in these notes
does not actually rely on the presence of a conformal structure, but more advanced

Conformal Field Theory
22
features of the theory do, and therefore the conformal structure is an integral part of
the theory.
A meromorphic ﬁeld theory is called conformal if the three M¨obius generators L0,
L±1 are the modes of a ﬁeld L that is then usually called the stress-energy tensor or
the Virasoro ﬁeld.
Because of (31), (83) and (90), the ﬁeld in question must be a
quasiprimary ﬁeld of conformal weight 2 that can be expanded as
L(z) =
∞
X
n=−∞
Lnz−n−2 .
(104)
If we write L(z) = V (ψL, z), the commutator in (90) becomes
[Lm, Ln] =
2
X
N=−1
 
m + 1
mN
!
Vm+n (LNψL)
= m(m2 −1)
6
Vm+n(L2ψL) + m(m + 1)
2
Vm+n(L1ψL)
+ (m + 1)Vm+n(L0ψL) + Vm+n(L−1ψL) .
(105)
All these expressions can be evaluated further [11]+: since L2ψL has conformal weight
h = 0, the uniqueness of the vacuum implies that it must be proportional to the vacuum
vector,
L2ψL = L2L−2Ω= c
2Ω,
(106)
where c is some constant. Also, since the vacuum vector acts as the identity operator,
Vn(Ω) = δn,0. Furthermore, L1ψL = 0 since L is quasiprimary, and L0ψL = 2ψL since L
has conformal weight 2. Finally, because of (66),
V (L−1ψ, z) = d
dz
X
n
Vn(ψ)z−n−h = −
X
n
(n + h)Vn(ψ)z−n−(h+1) ,
(107)
and since L−1ψ has conformal weight h + 1 (if ψ has conformal weight h),
Vn(L−1ψ) = −(n + h)Vn(ψ) .
(108)
Putting all of this together we then ﬁnd that (105) becomes
[Lm, Ln] = (m −n)Lm+n + c
12m(m2 −1)δm+n,0 .
(109)
This algebra is called the Virasoro algebra [53], and the parameter c is called the central
charge. The real algebra deﬁned by (109) is the Lie algebra of the central extension of
the group of diﬀeomorphisms of the circle (see e.g. [54]).
If the theory contains a Virasoro ﬁeld, the states transform in representations of
the Virasoro algebra (rather than just the Lie algebra of sl(2,C) that corresponds to
the M¨obius transformations).
Under suitable conditions (for example if the theory
is unitary), the space of states can then be completely decomposed into irreducible
representations of the Virasoro algebra. Because of the spectrum condition, the relevant
+ This is also known as the L¨uscher-Mack Theorem, see [50–52].

Conformal Field Theory
23
representations are then highest weight representations that are generated from a
primary state ψ, i.e. a state satisfying
L0ψ = hψ
Lnψ = 0
for n > 0.
(110)
If ψ is primary, the commutation relation (83) holds for all m, i.e.
[Lm, Vn(ψ)] = (m(h −1) −n)Vm+n(ψ)
for all m ∈Z
(111)
as follows from (90) together with (108). In this case the conformal symmetry also leads
to an extension of the M¨obius transformation formula (41) to arbitrary holomorphic
transformations f that are only locally deﬁned,
DfV (ψ, z)D−1
f
= (f ′(z))h V (ψ, f(z)) ,
(112)
where ψ is primary and Df is a certain product of exponentials of Ln with coeﬃcients
that depend on f [55]. The extension of (112) to states that are not primary is also
known (but again much more complicated).
3.7. Examples
Let us now give a number of examples that exhibit the structures that we have described
so far.
3.7.1.
The Free Boson The simplest conformal ﬁeld theory is the theory that is
associated to a single free boson. In this case V can be taken to be a one-dimensional
vector space, spanned by a vector J of weight 1, in which case we write J(z) ≡V (J, z).
The amplitude of an odd number of J-ﬁelds is deﬁned to vanish, and in the case of an
even number it is given by
⟨J(z1) · · · J(z2n)⟩= kn
2nn!
X
π∈S2n
n
Y
j=1
1
(zπ(j) −zπ(j+n))2 ,
(113)
= kn X
π∈S′
2n
n
Y
j=1
1
(zπ(j) −zπ(j+n))2 ,
(114)
where k is an arbitrary (real) constant and, in (113), S2n is the permutation group on
2n objects, whilst, in (114), the sum is restricted to the subset S′
2n of permutations
π ∈S2n such that π(i) < π(i + n) and π(i) < π(j) if 1 ≤i < j ≤n. It is clear that
these amplitudes are meromorphic and local, and it is easy to check that they satisfy
the condition of M¨obius invariance with the conformal weight of J being 1.
From the amplitudes we can directly read oﬀthe operator product expansion of
the ﬁeld J with itself as
J(z)J(ζ) ∼
k
(z −ζ)2 ,
(115)
where we use the symbol ∼to indicate equality up to terms that are non-singular at
z = ζ. Comparing this with (87), and using (90) we then obtain
[Jn, Jm] = nkδn,−m .
(116)

Conformal Field Theory

This deﬁnes (a representation of) the aﬃne algebra ˆu(1). J is also sometimes called a
U(1)-current. The operator product expansion (115) actually contains all the relevant
information about the theory since one can reconstruct the amplitudes from it; to this
end one deﬁnes recursively
⟨⟩

⟨J(z)⟩= 0

(119)
Indeed, the two sets of amplitudes have the same poles, and their diﬀerence describes
therefore an entire function; all entire functions on the sphere are constant and it is not
diﬃcult to see that the constant is actually zero. The equality between the two sets of
amplitudes can also be checked directly.
This theory is actually conformal since the space of states that is obtained by
factorisation from these amplitudes contains the state
ψL = 1
2k J−1J−1Ω,
(120)
which plays the rˆole of the stress-energy tensor with central charge c = 1.
The
corresponding ﬁeld (that is deﬁned by (86)) can actually be given directly as
V (ψL, z) = L(z) = 1
2k
×
×J(z)J(z) ×
× ,
(121)
where ×
×
×
× denotes normal ordering, which, in this context, means that the singular part
of the OPE of J with itself has been subtracted. In fact, it follows from (87) that
J(w)J(z) =
1
(w −z)2V (J1J−1Ω, z) +
1
(w −z)V (J0J−1Ω, z)
(122)
+ V (J−1J−1Ω, z) + O(w −z) ,
(123)
and therefore (121) implies (120).
3.7.2. Aﬃne Theories
We can generalise this example to the case of an arbitrary ﬁnite-
dimensional Lie algebra g; the corresponding conformal ﬁeld theory is usually called a
Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model [56–60], and the following explicit construction
of the amplitudes is due to Frenkel & Zhu [61].
Suppose that the matrices ta,
1 ≤a ≤dim g, provide a ﬁnite-dimensional representation of g so that [ta, tb] = f ab
ctc,
where f ab
c are the structure constants of g. We introduce a ﬁeld J a(z) for each ta,
1 ≤a ≤dimg. If K is any matrix which commutes with all the ta, deﬁne
κa1a2...am = tr(Kta1ta2 · · · tam) .
(124)
The κa1a2...am have the properties that
κa1a2a3...am−1am = κa2a3...am−1ama1
(125)

Conformal Field Theory
25
and
κa1a2a3...am−1am −κa2a1a3...am−1am = f a1a2
bκba3...am−1am .
(126)
With a cycle σ = (i1, i2, . . ., im) ≡(i2, . . ., im, i1) we associate the function
f
ai1 ai2...aim
σ
(zi1, zi2, . . . , zim) =
κai1 ai2...aim
(zi1 −zi2)(zi2 −zi3) · · · (zim−1 −zim)(zim −zi1) .
(127)
If the permutation ρ ∈Sn has no ﬁxed points, it can be written as the product of cycles
of length at least 2, ρ = σ1σ2 . . .σM. We associate to ρ the product fρ of functions
fσ1fσ2 . . . fσM and deﬁne ⟨J a1(z1)J a2(z2) . . . J an(zn)⟩to be the sum of such functions fρ
over permutations ρ ∈Sn with no ﬁxed point. Graphically, we can construct these
amplitudes by summing over all graphs with n vertices where the vertices carry labels
aj, 1 ≤j ≤n, and each vertex is connected by two directed lines (propagators) to other
vertices, one of the lines at each vertex pointing towards it and one away. (In the above
notation, the vertex i is connected to σ−1(i) and to σ(i), and the line from σ−1(i) is
directed towards i, and from i to σ(i).) Thus, in a given graph, the vertices are divided
into directed loops or cycles, each loop containing at least two vertices. To each loop, we
associate a function as in (127) and to each graph we associate the product of functions
associated to the loops of which it is composed.
The resulting amplitudes are evidently local and meromorphic, and one can verify
that they satisfy the M¨obius covariance property with the weight of J a being 1. They
determine the operator product expansion to be of the form∗
J a(z)J b(w) ∼
κab
(z −w)2 + f ab
cJ c(w)
(z −w) ,
(128)
and the algebra therefore becomes
[J a
m, J b
n] = f ab
cJ c
m+n + mκabδm,−n .
(129)
This is (a representation of) the aﬃne algebra ˆg [62–64]. In the particular case where g
is simple, κab = tr(Ktatb) = kδab in a suitable basis, where k is a real number (that is
called the level). The algebra then becomes
[J a
m, J b
n] = f ab
cJ c
m+n + mkδabδm,−n .
(130)
Again this theory is conformal since it has a stress-energy tensor given by
ψL =
1
2(k + Q)
X
a
J a
−1J a
−1Ω,
(131)
where Q is the dual Coxeter number of g (i.e. the value of the quadratic Casimir in
the adjoint representation divided by the length squared of the longest root). Here the
central charge is
c = 2k dim g
2k + Q ,
(132)
∗The terms singular in (z −w) only arise from cycles where the vertices associated to z and w are
adjacent. The ﬁrst term in (128) comes from the 2-cycle involving z and w. For every larger cycle
in which z and w are adjacent, there exists another cycle where the order of z and w is reversed; the
contributions of these two cycles combine to give the second term in (128).

Conformal Field Theory

and the corresponding ﬁeld can be described as
L(z) =
1
2(k + Q)
X
a
×
×J a(z)J a(z) ×
× .
(133)
Finally, the modes of L can be expressed in terms of the modes of J a as
Ln =
1
2(k + Q)
X
a
X
m
: J a
mJ a
n−m : ,
(134)
where the colons denote normal ordering
: J a
mJ b
l :=
(
J a
mJ b
l
if m < 0
J b
l J a
m
if m ≥0.
(135)
The construction of the stress-energy-tensor as a bilinear in the currents J a is called
the Sugawara construction [65]. The construction can be generalised directly to the case
where g is semi-simple: in this case, the Sugawara ﬁeld is the sum of the Sugawara ﬁelds
associated to each simple factor, and the central charge is the sum of the corresponding
central charges.
The conformal ﬁeld theory associated to the aﬃne algebra ˆg is unitary if k is a
positive integer [54,66]; in this case c ≥1.
3.7.3. Virasoro Theories
Another very simple example of a meromorphic conformal
ﬁeld theory is the theory where V can be taken to be a one-dimensional vector space
that is spanned by the (conformal) vector L [4]. Let us denote the corresponding ﬁeld by
L(z) = V (L, z). Again following Frenkel and Zhu [61], we can construct the amplitudes
graphically as follows. We sum over all graphs with n vertices, where the vertices are
labelled by the integers 1 ≤j ≤n, and each vertex is connected by two directed lines
(propagators) to other vertices, one of the lines at each vertex pointing towards it and
one away. In a given graph, the vertices are now divided into loops, each loop containing
at least two vertices. To each loop ℓ= (i1, i2, . . . , im), we associate a function
fℓ(zi1, zi2, . . . , zim) =
c/2
(zi1 −zi2)2(zi2 −zi3)2 · · · (zim−1 −zim)2(zim −zi1)2 ,
(136)
where c is a real number, and, to a graph, the product of the functions associated to its
loops. [Since it corresponds to a factor of the form (zi−zj)−2 rather than (zi−zj)−1, each
line or propagator might appropriately be represented by a double line.] The amplitudes
⟨L(z1)L(z2) . . . L(zn)⟩are then obtained by summing the functions associated with the
various graphs with n vertices. [Note that graphs related by reversing the direction of
any loop contribute equally to this sum.]
These amplitudes determine the operator product expansion to be
L(z)L(ζ) ∼
c/2
(z −ζ)4 +
2L(ζ)
(z −ζ)2 + L′(ζ)
z −ζ ,
(137)
which thus agrees with the operator product expansion of the ﬁeld L as deﬁned in
subsection 3.6.

Conformal Field Theory
27
These pure Virasoro models are unitary if either c ≥1 or c belongs to the unitary
discrete series [67]
c = 1 −
6
m(m + 1)
m = 2, 3, 4, . . .
(138)
The necessity of this condition was established in [67] using the Kac-determinant
formula [68] that was proven by Feigin & Fuchs in [69]. The existence of these unitary
representations follows from the coset construction (to be explained below) [70].
3.7.4. Lattice Theories
Let us recall that a lattice Λ is a subset of an n-dimensional
inner product space which has integral coordinates in some basis, ej, j = 1, . . ., n; thus
Λ = {Pmjej : mj ∈Z}. The lattice is called Euclidean if the inner product is positive
deﬁnite, i.e. if k2 ≥0 for each k ∈Λ, and integral if k · l ∈Z for all k, l ∈Λ. An
(integral) lattice is even if k2 is an even integer for every k ∈Λ.
Suppose Λ is an even Euclidean lattice with basis ej, j = 1, . . . , n.
Let us
introduce an algebra consisting of matrices γj, 1 ≤j ≤n, such that γ2
j = 1 and
γiγj = (−1)ei·ejγjγi. If we deﬁne γk = γm1
1 γm2
2
. . .γmn
n
for k = m1e1 +m2e2 +. . .+mnen,
we can deﬁne quantities ϵ(k1, k2, . . ., kN), taking the values ±1, by
γk1γk2 . . . γkN = ϵ(k1, k2, . . ., kN)γk1+k2+...+kN .
(139)
We deﬁne the theory associated to the lattice Λ by taking a basis for V to consist of
the states k ∈Λ. For each k, the corresponding ﬁeld V (k, z) has conformal weight 1
2k2,
and the amplitudes are given by
⟨V (k1, z1)V (k2, z2) · · · V (kN, zn)⟩= ϵ(k1, k2, . . ., kN)
Y
1≤i<j≤N
(zi −zj)ki·kj
(140)
if k1 + k2 + . . . + kN = 0 and zero otherwise. The ϵ(k1, k2, . . . , kN) obey the conditions
ϵ(k1, k2, . . ., kj−1, kj, kj+1, kj+2, . . . , kN)
(141)
= (−1)kj·kj+1ϵ(k1, k2, . . . , kj−1, kj+1, kj, kj+2, . . ., kN) ,
(142)
which guarantees the locality of the amplitudes, and
ϵ(k1, k2, . . ., kj)ϵ(kj+1, . . ., kN)
(143)
= ϵ(k1 + k2 + . . . + kj, kj+1 + . . . + kN)ϵ(k1, k2, . . . , kj, kj+1, . . ., kN) ,
(144)
which implies the cluster decomposition property (that guarantees the uniqueness of
the vacuum). It is also easy to check that the amplitudes satisfy the M¨obius covariance
condition.
This theory is also conformal, but the Virasoro ﬁeld cannot be easily described in
terms of the ﬁelds in V . In fact, the theory that is obtained by factorisation from the
above amplitudes contains n ﬁelds of conformal weight 1, Hi(z), i = 1, . . . , n, whose
operator product expansion is
Hi(z)Hj(ζ) ∼δij
1
(z −ζ)2 .
(145)

Conformal Field Theory
28
This is of the same form as (115), and the corresponding modes therefore satisfy
[Hi
m, Hj
n] = mδijδm,−n .
(146)
The Virasoro ﬁeld is then given as
L(z) = 1
2
X
i
×
×Hi(z)Hi(z) ×
× ,
(147)
and the central charge is c = n. Details of the construction of this unitary meromorphic
conformal ﬁeld theory can be found in [71,72].
For the case where Λ is the root lattice of a simply-laced ﬁnite-dimensional Lie
algebra, the lattice theory coincides with the aﬃne theory of the corresponding aﬃne
Lie algebra at level k = 1; this is known as the Frenkel-Kac-Segal construction [73,74].
Lattice theories that are associated to even self-dual lattices whose dimension is a
multiple of 24 provide examples of local meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theories, i.e. local
modular invariant theories that are meromorphic. Such theories are characterised by the
property that all amplitudes depend only on the chiral coordinates (i.e. on zi but not
on ¯zi), and that the space of states of the complete local theory coincides with (rather
than just contains) that of the meromorphic (sub)theory. Recall that for a given lattice
Λ, the dual lattice Λ∗is the lattice that contains all vectors y for which x · y ∈Z for all
x ∈Λ. A lattice is integral if Λ ⊂Λ∗, and it is self-dual if Λ∗= Λ. The dimension of an
even self-dual lattice has to be a multiple of 8.
It is not diﬃcult to prove that a basis of states for the meromorphic Fock space FΛ
that is associated to an even lattice Λ can be taken to consist of the states of the form
Hi1
m1Hi2
m2 · · · HiN
mN|k⟩,
(148)
where m1 ≤m2 ≤· · · ≤mN, ij ∈{1, . . ., n} and k ∈Λ. Here Hi
l are the modes of the
currents (145), and |k⟩= V (k, 0)Ω. The contribution of the meromorphic subtheory to
the partition function (11) is therefore
χFΛ(τ) = q−c
24 trFΛ(qL0) = η(τ)−dim ΛΘΛ(τ) ,
(149)
where η(τ) is the famous Dedekind eta-function,
η(τ) = q
1
24
∞
Y
n=1
(1 −qn) ,
(150)
ΘΛ is the theta function of the lattice,
ΘΛ(τ) =
X
k∈Λ
q
1
2 k2 ,
(151)
and we have set q = e2πiτ. The theta function of a lattice is related to that of its dual
by the Jacobi transformation formula
ΘΛ(−1/τ) = (−iτ)
1
2 dim Λ||Λ∗||ΘΛ∗(τ) ,
(152)
where ||Λ|| = | det(ei · ej)|. Together with the transformation formula of the Dedekind
function
η(−1/τ) = (−iτ)
1
2η(τ) ,
(153)

Conformal Field Theory
29
this implies that the partition function of the meromorphic theory transforms under
modular transformations as
χFΛ(−1/τ) = ||Λ∗||χFΛ∗(τ) .
(154)
Furthermore, it follows from (149) together with the fact that the spectrum of L0 in FΛ
is integral that
χFΛ(τ + 1) = e2πi c
24χFΛ(τ) .
(155)
If Λ is a self-dual lattice, ||Λ∗|| = 1 and the partition function is invariant under
the transformation in (154). If in addition c = n = 24k where k ∈Z, the partition
function of the meromorphic theory is invariant under the whole modular group, and
the meromorphic theory deﬁnes a local (modular invariant) conformal ﬁeld theory. For
the case where n = 24, lattices with these properties have been classiﬁed: there exist
precisely 24 such lattices, the 23 Niemeier lattices and the Leech lattice (see [75] for
a review). The Leech lattice plays a central rˆole in the construction of the Monster
conformal ﬁeld theory [14].
3.7.5.
More General W-Algebras In the above examples, closed formulae for all
amplitudes of the generating ﬁelds could be given explicitly. There exist however many
meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theories for which this is not the case. These theories
are normally deﬁned in terms of the operator product expansion of a set of generating
ﬁelds (that span V ) from which the commutation relations of the corresponding modes
can be derived; the resulting algebra is then usually called a W-algebra. In general, a
W-algebra is not a Lie algebra in the modes of the generating ﬁelds since the operator
product expansion (and therefore the associated commutator) of two generating ﬁelds
may involve normal ordered products of the generating ﬁelds rather than just the
generating ﬁelds themselves.
In principle all amplitudes can be determined from the knowledge of these
commutation relations, but it is often diﬃcult to give closed expressions for them. (It
is also, a priori, not clear whether the power series expansion that can be obtained
from these commutation relations will converge to deﬁne meromorphic functions with
the appropriate singularity structure, although this is believed to be the case for all
presently known examples.) The theories that we have described in detail above are in
some sense fundamental in that all presently known meromorphic (bosonic) conformal
ﬁeld theories have an (alternative) description as a coset or orbifold of one of these
theories; these constructions will be described in the next subsection.
The ﬁrst example of a W-algebra that is not a Lie algebra in the modes of its
generating ﬁelds is the so-called W3 algebra [76, 77]; this algebra is generated by the
Virasoro algebra {Ln}, and the modes Wm of a quasiprimary ﬁeld of conformal weight
h = 3, subject to (109) and the relations [76–78]
[Lm, Wn] =
(2m −n) Wm+n ,
[Wm, Wn] =

30 (m −n) (2m2 −mn + 2n2 −8) Lm+n ,
(156)
where Λk are the modes of a quasiprimary ﬁeld of conformal weight hΛ = 4. This ﬁeld
is a normal ordered product of L with itself, and its modes are explicitly given as
Λn =

X
k=−1

k=−∞

10 (n + 2) (n + 3) Ln .
(157)
One can check that this set of commutators satisﬁes the Jacobi-identity.
(This is
believed to be equivalent to the associativity of the operator product expansion of
the corresponding ﬁelds.)
Subsequently, various classes of W-algebras have been
constructed [79–86]. There have also been attempts to construct systematically classes
of W-algebras [87,88] following [89]. For a review of these matters see [90].
3.7.6. Superconformal Field Theories
All examples mentioned up to now have been
bosonic theories, i.e. theories all of whose ﬁelds are bosonic (and therefore have integral
conformal weight). The simplest example of a fermionic conformal ﬁeld theory is the
theory generated by a single free fermion ﬁeld b(z) of conformal weight h =
1
2 with
operator product expansion
b(z)b(ζ) ∼
1
(z −ζ) .
(158)
The corresponding modes
b(z) =
X
r∈Z+ 1
2
brz−r−1
2
(159)
satisfy an anti-commutation relation of the form
{br, bs} = δr,−s .
(160)
The Virasoro ﬁeld is given in this case by
L(z) = 1

(161)
and the corresponding modes are

(162)
They satisfy the Virasoro algebra with central charge c = 1
2.
This theory has a supersymmetric extension whose generating ﬁelds are the free
fermion b(z) (158) and the free boson J(z) deﬁned by (115) and (116), where we set
for convenience k = 1.
The operator product expansion of J and b is regular, so
that the corresponding commutator vanishes. This theory then exhibits superconformal
invariance; in the present context this means that the theory has in addition to the

31
stress-energy-tensor L, the superpartner ﬁeld G of conformal weight 3/2, whose modes
satisfy

(163)
Together with the Virasoro commutation relations for L (109), this is called the (Neveu
Schwarz [NS] sector of the) N = 1 superconformal algebra. In terms of J and b, L and
G can be written as
L(z) = 1
2

× + 1
2

db(z)
dz b(z) ×

G(z) = J(z)b(z) ,
(164)
where on the right-hand-side of the second line we have omitted the normal ordering
since the operator product expansion is regular. The modes of L and G are then given
as
Ln = 1

(165)
and it is easy to check that they satisfy (109) and (163) with c = 3/2.
The N = 1 superconformal ﬁeld theory that is generated by the ﬁelds L and G
subject to the commutation relations (163) is unitary if [91]
c = 3

m = 2, 3, 4, . . .
(166)
There also exist extended superconformal algebras that contain the above algebra as
a subalgebra. The most important of these is the N = 2 superconformal algebra [92,93]
that is the symmetry algebra of the world-sheet conformal ﬁeld theory of space-time
supersymmetric string theories [94]. In the so-called NS sector, this algebra is generated
by the modes of the Virasoro algebra (109), the modes of a free boson Jn (116) (where
we set again k = 1), and the modes of two supercurrents of conformal dimension h = 3

3.8. The Coset Construction
There exists a fairly general construction by means of which a meromorphic conformal
ﬁeld theory can be associated to a pair of a meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory and a
subtheory. In its simplest formulation [70,98] (see also [99–101] for a related construction
in a particular case) the pair of theories are aﬃne theories that are associated to a pair
h ⊂g of ﬁnite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. Let us denote by Lg
m and Lh
m the modes
of the Sugawara ﬁelds (134) of the aﬃne algebras ˆg and ˆh, respectively. If J a
n is a
generator of ˆh ⊂ˆg, then
[Lg
m, J a
n] = −nJ a
m+n
and
[Lh
m, J a
n] = −nJ a
m+n
(168)
since J a
n are the modes of a primary ﬁeld of conformal weight h = 1. (This can also be
checked directly using (134) and (130).) It then follows that
Km = Lg
m −Lh
m
(169)
commutes with every generator J a
n of ˆh, and therefore with the modes Lh
m (which are
bilinear in J a
n). We can thus write Lg
m as the sum of two commuting terms
Lg
m = Lh
m + Km ,
(170)
and since both Lg
m and Lh
m satisfy the commutation relations of a Virasoro algebra, it
follows that this is also the case for Km, where the corresponding central charge is
cK = cg −ch .
(171)
It is also straightforward to extend the construction to the case where g (and/or h) are
semi-simple.
In the unitary case, both cg ≥ch ≥1, but cK need not be greater or equal to one.
Indeed, we can consider ˆg = ˆsu(2)m ⊕ˆsu(2)1 and h = ˆsu(2)m+1, where the index is the
level k of (130), and the central charge cK is then
cK =
3m
m + 2 + 1 −3(m + 1)
(m + 3) = 1 −
6
(m + 2)(m + 3) ,
(172)
where m ∈Z+ and we have used (132) together with dim su(2) = 3 and Qsu(2) = 4. By
construction, the subspace that is generated by Km from the vacuum forms a unitary
representation of the Virasoro algebra with h = 0 and c = cK, and thus for each value of
c in the unitary discrete series (138), the vacuum representation of the Virasoro algebra
is indeed unitary [70]. Similar arguments can also be given for the discrete series of the
N = 1 superconformal algebra (166) [98].
We can generalise this construction directly to the case where instead of the aﬃne
theory associated to ˆg, we consider an arbitrary conformal ﬁeld theory H (with stress-
energy tensor L) that contains, as a subtheory, the aﬃne theory associated to ˆh. Then
by the same arguments as above
K = L −Lh
(173)

Conformal Field Theory
33
commutes with ˆh (and thus with Lh), and therefore satisﬁes a Virasoro algebra with
central charge cK = c−ch. By construction, the Virasoro algebra Km leaves the subspace
of states
Hh =
n
ψ ∈H : J a
nψ = 0 for every J a
n ∈ˆh with n ≥0
o
(174)
invariant. Furthermore, the operator product expansion of an h-current J a(z) and a
vertex operator V (ψ, ζ) associated to ψ ∈Hh is regular, and therefore the corresponding
modes commute. This implies that the operator product expansion of two states in Hh
only contain states that lie in Hh [102], and thus that we can deﬁne a meromorphic
ﬁeld theory whose space of states is Hh. Since the commutator of Lh with any state
in Hh vanishes, it is clear that the Virasoro ﬁeld for this theory is K; the resulting
meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is called the coset theory.
Many W-algebras can be constructed as cosets of aﬃne theories [81, 102–104].
It is also possible to construct representations of the coset theory from those of H,
and to determine the corresponding modular transformation matrix; details of these
constructions for the case of certain coset theories of aﬃne theories have been recently
worked out in [105].
3.9. Orbifolds
There exists another very important construction that associates to a given local
(modular invariant) conformal ﬁeld theory another such theory [106–110].
This
construction is possible whenever the theory carries an action of a ﬁnite group G. A
group G acts on the space of states of a conformal ﬁeld theory HH
H, if each g ∈G deﬁnes
a linear map g : H
H
H →H
H
H (that leaves the dense subspace FFF invariant, g : FFF →FFF), the
composition of maps respects the group structure of G, and the amplitudes satisfy
⟨V (gψ1; z1, ¯z1) · · · V (gψn; zn, ¯zn)⟩= ⟨V (ψ1; z1, ¯z1) · · · V (ψn; zn, ¯zn)⟩. (175)
The space of states of the orbifold theory consists of those states that are invariant
under the action of G,
H
H
HG = {ψ ∈H
H
H : gψ = ψ
for all g ∈G.} ,
(176)
together with additional twisted sectors, one for each conjugacy class in G. Generically
the meromorphic subtheory of the resulting theory consists of those meromorphic ﬁelds
of the original theory that are invariant under G, but in general it may also happen that
some of the twisted sectors contain additional meromorphic ﬁelds.
The construction of the twisted sectors is somewhat formal in general, and so is the
proof that the resulting local theory is always modular invariant. There exist however
some examples where the construction is understood in detail, most notably the local
meromorphic lattice theories that were discussed in section 3.7.4. Let us for simplicity
consider the case where G = Z2 = {1, θ}, and the action on HΛ is determined by
θHi(z)θ = −Hi(z) ,
θV (x, z)θ = V (−x, z) ,
θΩ= Ω.
(177)

Conformal Field Theory
34
In this case there exists only one twisted sector, H′
Λ, and it is generated by the operators
ci
r, i = 1, . . . , n with r ∈Z + 1
2, satisfying the commutation relations
[ci
r, cj
s] = rδijδr,−s .
(178)
These act on an irreducible representation space U of the algebra
γiγj = (−1)ei·ejγjγi ,
(179)
where ei, i = 1, . . . , n is a basis of Λ, and where for χ ∈U, ci
rχ = 0 if r > 0. The actual
orbifold theory consists then of the states in the untwisted HΛ and the twisted sector
H′
Λ that are left invariant by θ, where the action of θ on HΛ is given as in (177), and
on H′
Λ we have
θci
rθ = −ci
r
θ|U = ±1 .
(180)
The generators of the Virasoro algebra act in the twisted sector as
Lm = 1

n
X
i=1
X
r∈Z+ 1
2
: ci
rci
m−r : + n
16δm,0 .
(181)
As in the untwisted sector Lm commutes with θ and is therefore well deﬁned in the
orbifold theory.
Since the local meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is already modular invariant,
the dimension n of the lattice is a multiple of 24 and the orbifold theory is again a
meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory. This theory is again bosonic provided the sign in
(180) corresponds to the parity of dimΛ divided by 8. With this choice of (180) the
orbifold theory deﬁnes another local meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory [71,72,111].
The most important example of this type is the orbifold theory associated to the
Leech lattice for which the orbifold theory does not have any states of conformal weight
one. This is the famous Monster conformal ﬁeld theory whose automorphism group is the
Monster group [12–14,112], the largest simple sporadic group. It has been conjectured
that this theory is uniquely characterised by the property to be a local meromorphic
conformal ﬁeld theory with c = 24 and without any states of conformal weight one [14],
but this has not been proven so far.
One can also apply the construction systematically to the other 23 Niemeier
lattices.
Together with the 24 local meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theories that are
directly associated to the 24 self-dual lattices, this would naively give 48 conformal ﬁeld
theories. However, nine of these theories coincide, and therefore these constructions
only produce 39 diﬀerent local meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theories [72, 111]. If the
above conjecture about the uniqueness of the Monster theory is true, then every local
meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory at c = 24 (other than the Monster theory) contains
states of weight one, and therefore an aﬃne subtheory [11].
The theory can then
be analysed in terms of this subtheory, and using arguments of modular invariance,
Schellekens has suggested that at most 71 local meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theories
exist for c = 24 [39]. However this classiﬁcation has only been done on the level of the
partition functions, and it is not clear whether more than one conformal ﬁeld theory

Conformal Field Theory
35
may correspond to a given partition function. Also, none of these additional theories
has been constructed explicitly, and it is not obvious that all 71 partition functions arise
from consistent conformal ﬁeld theories.
4. Representations of a Meromorphic Conformal Field Theory
For most local conformal ﬁeld theories the meromorphic ﬁelds form a proper subspace of
the space of states. The additional states of the theory transform then in representations
of the meromorphic (and the anti-meromorphic) subtheory. Indeed, as we explained in
section 2.1, the space of states is a direct sum of subspaces H
H
H(j,¯), each of which forms
an indecomposable representation of the two meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theories. For
most conformal ﬁeld theories of interest (although not for all, see [41]), each HH
H(j,¯) is
a tensor product of an irreducible representation of the meromorphic and the anti-
meromorphic conformal subtheory, respectively
H
H
H(j,¯) = Hj ⊗¯H¯.
(182)
The local theory is speciﬁed in terms of the space of states and the set of all amplitudes
involving arbitrary states in FFF ⊂H
H
H. The meromorphic subtheory that we analysed
above describes the amplitudes that only involve states in F0.
Similarly, the anti-
meromorphic subtheory describes the amplitudes that only involve states in F 0. Since
the two meromorphic theories commute, a general amplitude involving states from
both F0 and F 0 is simply the product of the corresponding meromorphic and anti-
meromorphic amplitude.
(Indeed, the product of the meromorphic and the anti-
meromorphic amplitude has the same poles as the original amplitude.)
If the theory factorises as in (182), one of the summands in (8) is the completion
of F0 ⊗F0, and we denote it by H
H
H(0,¯0). A general amplitude of the theory contains
states from diﬀerent sectors H
H
H(j,¯).
Since each H
H
H(j,¯) is a representation of the two
vertex operator algebras, we can use the operator product expansion (5) to rewrite
a given amplitude in terms of amplitudes that do not involve states in HH
H(0,¯0). It is
therefore useful to call an amplitude an n-point function if it involves n states from
sectors other than H
H
H(0,¯0) and an arbitrary number of states from H
H
H(0,¯0). In general,
each such amplitude can be expressed as a sum of products of a chiral amplitude, i.e.
an amplitude that only depends on the zi, and an anti-chiral amplitude, i.e. one that
only depends on the ¯zi. However, for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, the sum contains only one term
since the functional form of the relevant chiral (and anti-chiral) amplitudes is uniquely
determined by M¨obius symmetry.
The zero-point functions are simply products of meromorphic amplitudes, and
the one-point functions vanish. The two-point functions are usually non-trivial, and
they deﬁne, in essence, the diﬀerent representations of the meromorphic and the anti-
meromorphic subtheory that are present in the theory. Since these amplitudes factorise
into chiral and anti-chiral amplitudes, one can analyse them separately; these chiral
amplitudes deﬁne then a representation of the meromorphic subtheory.

4.1. Highest Weight Representations
A representation of the meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is deﬁned by the collection
of amplitudes
D
¯φ(w)V (ψ1, z1) · · · V (ψn, zn)φ(u)
E
,
(183)
where φ and ¯φ are two ﬁxed ﬁelds (that describe the generating ﬁeld of a representation
and its conjugate), and ψi are quasiprimary ﬁelds in the meromorphic conformal ﬁeld
theory.
The amplitudes (183) are analytic functions of the variables and transform
covariantly under the M¨obius transformations as in (37)
D
¯φ(w)V (ψ1, z1) · · · V (ψn, zn)φ(u)

D
¯φ(γ(w))V (ψ1, γ(z1)) · · · V (ψn, γ(zn))φ(γ(u))
E
,
(184)
where hi is the conformal weight of ψi, and we call h and ¯h the conformal weights of φ
and ¯φ, respectively. Since φ and ¯φ are not meromorphic ﬁelds, h and ¯h are in general
not half-integer, and the amplitudes are typically branched about u = w. Because of the
M¨obius symmetry we can always map the two points u and w to 0 and ∞, respectively
(for example by considering the M¨obius transformation γ(z) = z−u
z−w ), and we shall from
now always do so. In this case we shall write φ(0)⟩= |φ⟩. For the case of w = ∞the
situation is slightly more subtle since (183) behaves as w−2¯h for w →∞; we therefore
deﬁne
⟨¯φ| = lim
w→∞w2¯h⟨¯φ(w) .
(185)
We can then think of the amplitudes as being the expectation value of the meromorphic
ﬁelds in the background described by φ and ¯φ.
The main property that distinguishes the amplitudes as representations of the
meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is the condition that the operator product relations
of the meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory are preserved by these amplitudes. This is
the requirement that the operator product expansion of the meromorphic ﬁelds (87)
also holds in the amplitudes (183), i.e.
⟨¯φ|V (ψ1, z1) · · · V (ψi, zi)V (ψi+1, zi+1) · · · V (ψn, zn)|φ⟩
=
X
n<hi+1
(zi −zi+1)−n−hi
(186)
⟨¯φ|V (ψ1, z1) · · · V (ψi−1, zi−1)V (Vn(ψi)ψi+1, zi+1) · · · V (ψn, zn)|φ⟩,
where |zi −zi+1| < |zj −zi+1| for j ̸= i and |zi −zi+1| < |zi+1|. In writing (186) we
have also implicitly assumed that if N is a null-state of the meromorphic conformal
ﬁeld theory (i.e. a linear combination of states of the form (84) that vanishes in every
meromorphic amplitude) then any amplitude (183) involving N also vanishes; this is

Conformal Field Theory
37
implicit in the above since the operator product expansion of the meromorphic conformal
ﬁeld theory is only determined up to such null-ﬁelds by the meromorphic amplitudes.
We call a representation untwisted if the amplitudes (183) are single-valued as zi
encircles the origin or inﬁnity; if this is not the case for at least some of the meromorphic
ﬁelds the representation is called twisted. If the representation is untwisted, we can
expand the meromorphic ﬁelds in terms of their modes as in (80). In this way we can
then deﬁne the action of Vn(ψ) on the non-meromorphic state |φ⟩, and thus on arbitrary
states of the form
Vn1(ψ1) · · · VnN (ψN)|φ⟩.
(187)
As we explained in section 3.4, the commutation relations of these modes (90) can be
derived from the operator product expansion of the corresponding ﬁelds.
Since the
representation amplitudes (183) preserve these in the sense of (186), it follows that the
action of the modes on the states of the form (187) also respects (90), at least up to
null-states that vanish in all amplitudes. If we thus deﬁne the Fock space F to be the
quotient space of the space of states generated by (187), where we identify states whose
diﬀerence vanishes in all amplitudes, then F carries a representation of the Lie algebra
of modes (of the meromorphic ﬁelds).♯
For most of the following we shall only consider untwisted representations, but
there is one important case of a twisted representations, the so-called Ramond sector
of a fermionic algebra, that should be mentioned here since it can be analysed by very
similar methods. In this case the bosonic ﬁelds are single-valued as z encircles the origin,
and the fermionic ﬁelds pick up a minus sign. It is then again possible to expand the
meromorphic ﬁelds in modes, where the bosonic ﬁelds are treated as before, and for a
fermionic ﬁeld we now have
V (χ, z) =
X
r∈Z
Vr(χ)z−r−h
R-sector of fermionic χ.
(188)
Using the same methods as before, we can deduce the commutation (and anti-
commutation) relations of these modes from the operator product expansion of the
ﬁelds in the meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory, and the Fock space of the R-sector
representations forms then a representation of this Lie algebra.
Indeed, the actual
form of the commutation and anti-commutation relations is the same except that the
fermionic ﬁelds now have integer mode number. For example, the commutation relations
of the R-sector of the N = 1 superconformal algebra are
[Lm, Ln]

♯Strictly speaking, the underlying vector space of this Lie algebra is the vector space of modes, where
we identify two modes if their diﬀerence vanishes on the Fock space of all representations.

Conformal Field Theory
38
where now r, s ∈Z, and this agrees formally with (163).
The physically relevant representations satisfy again the condition that the
spectrum of L0 (the zero mode of the conformal stress-energy-tensor) is bounded from
below. This implies that there exists a state φ0 in F that is annihilated by all modes
Vn(ψ) with n > 0 (since Vn(ψ) lowers the L0 eigenvalue by n as follows from (83)); such
a state is called a (Virasoro) highest weight state. If the representation is irreducible, i.e.
if it does not contain any proper subrepresentations, then the representation generated
from φ0 by the action of the modes reproduces the whole representation space, and
we may therefore assume that φ (and ¯φ) are highest weight states. Using the mode
expansion of the meromorphic ﬁeld V (ψ, z), the highest weight property of φ can be
rewritten as the condition that the pole in z of an amplitude involving V (ψ, z)|φ⟩is at
most of order h, where h is the conformal weight of ψ. Because of the M¨obius covariance
of the amplitudes, this is then also equivalent to the condition that the order of the pole
in (zi −u) in (183) is bounded by the conformal weight of ψi, hi.
If φ0 is a Virasoro highest weight state, then so is V0(ψ)φ0 for any ψ. The space
of Virasoro highest weight states therefore forms a representation of the zero modes of
the meromorphic ﬁelds. Conversely, given a representation R of the zero modes we can
consider the space of states that is generated from a state in R by the action of the
negative modes; this is called the Verma module. More precisely, the Verma module V
is the vector space that is spanned by the states of the form
Vn1(ψ1) · · · VnN (ψN)φ
φ ∈R ,
(190)
where ni < 0, modulo the relations
Vl1(ψ1) · · · Vlr(ψr)

Vn(ψ), Vm(χ)
i
Vlr+1(ψr+1) · · · VlN(ψN)φ ,
(191)
where φ ∈R, and [Vn(ψ), Vm(χ)] stands for the right-hand-side of (90). If the meromor-
phic conformal ﬁeld theory is generated by a ﬁnite set of ﬁelds, W 1(z), . . .W s(z), one can
show [104] that the Verma module is spanned by the so-called Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt
basis that consists of vectors of the form
W i1
−m1 · · · W il
−mlφ ,
(192)
where φ ∈R, mj > 0, 1 ≤ij+1 ≤ij ≤s and mj ≥mj+1 if ij = ij+1. The actual Fock
space of the representation F is again a certain quotient of the Verma module, where
we set to zero all states that vanish identically in all amplitudes; these states are again
called null-vectors.
4.2. An Illustrative Example
It should be stressed at this stage that the condition to be a representation of
the meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is usually stronger than that of being a
representation of the Lie algebra (or W-algebra) of modes of the generating ﬁelds. For
example, in the case of the aﬃne theories introduced in section 3.7.2, the latter condition

Conformal Field Theory
39
means that the representation space has to be a representation of the aﬃne algebra (130),
and for any value of k, there exist inﬁnitely many (non-integral) representations. On the
other hand, if k is a positive integer, the meromorphic theory possesses null-vectors, and
only those representations of the aﬃne algebra are representations of the meromorphic
conformal ﬁeld theory for which the null-ﬁelds act trivially on the representation space;
this selects a ﬁnite number of representations. For example, if g = su(2), the aﬃne
algebra can be written (in the Cartan-Weyl basis) as [66]
[Hm, Hn] = 1
2kmδm,−n
[Hm, J ±
n ] = ±J ±
m+n
(193)
[J +
m, J −
n ] = 2Hm+n + kmδm,−n ,
and if k is a positive integer, the vector
N =
 J +
−1
k+1 Ω
(194)
is a singular vector, i.e. it is a descendant of the highest weight vector that is annihilated
by all modes Vn(ψ) with n > 0. This follows from the fact that the positive modes of
the generating ﬁelds annihilate N which is obvious for HnN = J +
n N = 0, and for J −
n N
is a consequence of LnN = 0 for n > 0 together with

(195)
Every singular vector is a null-vector as follows from (100). In the above example, N
actually generates the null-space in the sense that every null-vector of the meromorphic
conformal ﬁeld theory can be obtained by the action of the modes from N [113] (see
also [64]).
The zero modes of the aﬃne algebra ˆsu(2) form the ﬁnite Lie algebra of su(2). For
every (ﬁnite-dimensional) representation R of su(2), i.e. for every spin j ∈Z/2, we can
construct a Verma module for ˆsu(2) whose Virasoro highest weight space transforms
as R. This (and any irreducible quotient space thereof) deﬁnes a representation of the
aﬃne algebra ˆsu(2). On the other hand, the zero mode of the null-vector N acts on any
Virasoro highest weight state φ as
V0(N)φ =
 J +
0
k+1 φ ,
(196)
and in order for the Verma module to deﬁne a representation of the meromorphic
conformal ﬁeld theory, (196) must vanish. This implies that j can only take the values
j = 0, 1/2, . . . , k/2. Since N generates all other null-ﬁelds [61], one may suspect that
this is the only additional condition, and this is indeed correct.
Incidentally, in the case at hand the meromorphic theory is actually unitary, and
the allowed representations are precisely those representations of the aﬃne algebra that
are unitary with respect to an inner product for which

and if the representation is unitary, this requires that (k −2j) ≥0, and thus that
j = 0, 1/2, . . . , k/2. As it turns out, this is also suﬃcient to guarantee unitarity. In
general, however, the constraints that select the representations of the meromorphic
conformal ﬁeld theory from those of the Lie algebra of modes cannot be understood in
terms of unitarity.
4.3. Zhu’s Algebra and the Classiﬁcation of Representations
The above analysis suggests that to each representation of the zero modes of the
meromorphic ﬁelds for which the zero modes of the null-ﬁelds vanish, a highest weight
representation of the meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory can be associated, and that all
highest weight representations of a meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory can be obtained
in this way [114]. This idea has been made precise by Zhu [16] who constructed an
algebra, now commonly referred to as Zhu’s algebra, that describes the algebra of zero
modes modulo zero modes of null-vectors, and whose representations are in one-to-one
correspondence with those of the meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory. The following
explanation of Zhu’s work follows closely [48].
In a ﬁrst step we determine the subspace of states whose zero modes always vanish
on Virasoro highest weight states. This subspace certainly contains the states of the
form (L−1 + L0)ψ, where ψ ∈F0 is arbitrary, since (108) implies that
V0 ((L−1 + L0)ψ) = V0 (L−1ψ) + hV0 (ψ) = 0 .
(199)
Furthermore, the subspace must also contain every state whose zero mode is of the form
V0(χ)V0((L−1 + L0)ψ) or V0((L−1 + L0)ψ)V0(χ). In order to describe states of this form
more explicitly, it is useful to observe that if both φ and ¯φ are Virasoro highest weight
states
⟨¯φ|V (ψ, 1)|φ⟩=
X
l
⟨¯φ|Vl(ψ)|φ⟩
= ⟨¯φ|V0(ψ)|φ⟩,
(200)
since the highest weight property implies that Vl(ψ)|φ⟩= 0 for l > 0 and similarly, using
(100), ⟨¯φ|Vl(ψ) = 0 for l < 0. Because of the translation symmetry of the amplitudes,
this can then be rewritten as
⟨¯φ|φ(−1) ψ⟩= ⟨¯φ|V0(ψ)|φ⟩.
(201)
Let us introduce the operators
V (N)(ψ) =
I
0
dw
wN+1V

(w + 1)L0 ψ, w

,
(202)

Conformal Field Theory
41
where N is an arbitrary integer, and the contour is a small circle that encircles w = 0
but not w = −1. Then if both φ and ¯φ are arbitrary Virasoro highest weight states and
N > 0, we have that
⟨¯φ|φ(−1) V (N)(ψ)χ⟩= 0 ,
(203)
since the integrand in (203) does not have any poles at w = −1 or w = ∞. Because of
(201) this implies that the zero mode of the corresponding state vanishes on an arbitrary
highest weight state (since the amplitude with any other highest weight state vanishes).
Let us denote by O(F0) the subspace of F0 that is generated by states of the form
V (N)(ψ)χ with N > 0, and deﬁne the quotient space A(F0) = F0/O(F0). The above
then implies that we can associate a zero mode (acting on a highest weight state) to
each state in A(F0). We can write (202) in terms of modes as
V (N)(ψ) =
h

n=0

V−n−N(ψ) ,
(204)
where ψ has conformal weight h, and it therefore follows that
V (1)(ψ)Ω= V−h−1(ψ)Ω+ hV−h(ψ)Ω= (L−1 + L0)ψ .
(205)
Thus O(F0) contains the states in (199). Furthermore,

(207)
Thus O(F0) is actually generated by the states of the form V (1)(ψ)χ, where ψ and χ
are arbitrary states in F0.
As we shall show momentarily, the vector space A(F0) actually has the structure
of an associative algebra, where the product is deﬁned by
ψ ∗L χ ≡V (0)(ψ)χ ,
(208)
and V (0)(ψ) is given as in (202) or (204); this algebra is called Zhu’s algebra.
The
analogue of (203) is then
⟨¯φ|φ(−1) V (0)(ψ)χ⟩= (−1)hψ⟨V0(ψ)¯φ|φ(−1) χ⟩
= (−1)hψ⟨V0(ψ)¯φ|V0(χ)|φ⟩
(209)
= ⟨¯φ|V0(ψ)V0(χ)|φ⟩,
(210)
and thus the product in A(F0) corresponds indeed to the action of the zero modes.

In order to exhibit the structure of this algebra it is useful to introduce a second
set of modes by
V (N)
c
(ψ) = (−1)N

w

(w + 1)
w + 1
w
N
V

(211)
These modes are characterised by the property that
⟨¯φ|φ(−1) V (N)
c
(ψ) χ⟩= 0
for N > 0,
(212)
⟨¯φ|φ(−1) V (0)
c
(ψ) χ⟩= ⟨¯φ| (V0(ψ)φ) (−1) χ⟩.
(213)
It is obvious from (204) and (211) that V (1)(ψ) = V (1)
c
(ψ), and the analogue of (207) is
V (N+1)
c
(ψ) = −

N + 1V (N)
c
(L−1ψ) −N + hψ
N + 1 V (N)
c

(214)
The space O(F0) is therefore also generated by the states of the form V (1)
c
(ψ)χ. Let us
introduce, following (209) and (213), the notation
VL(ψ) ≡V (0)(ψ)
VR(ψ) ≡V (0)
c
(ψ)
N(ψ) = V (1)(ψ) = V (1)
c
(ψ) .
We also denote by N(F0) the vector space of operators that are spanned by N(ψ) for
ψ ∈F0; then O(F0) = N(F0)F0. Finally it follows from (82) that VL(ψ)Ω= VR(ψ)Ω=
ψ.
The equations (209) and (213) suggest that the modes VL(ψ) and VR(χ) commute
up to an operator in N(F0). In order to prove this it is suﬃcient to consider the case
where ψ and χ are both eigenvectors of L0 with eigenvalues hψ and hχ, respectively.
Then we have
[VL(ψ), VR(χ)] =

(215)
Because of (214), every element in N(F0) can be written as VR(φ) for a suitable φ, and
(215) thus implies that [VL(ψ), N(χ)] ∈N(F0); hence VL(ψ) deﬁnes an endomorphism
of A(F0).

Conformal Field Theory
43
For two endomorphisms, Φ1, Φ2, of F0, which leave O(F0) invariant (so that they
induce endomorphisms of A(F0)), we shall write Φ1 ≈Φ2 if they agree as endomorphisms
of A(F0), i.e. if (Φ1 −Φ2)F0 ⊂O(F0). Similarly we write φ ≈0 if φ ∈O(F0).
In the same way in which the action of V (ψ, z) is uniquely characterised by locality
and (51), we can now prove the following
Uniqueness Theorem for Zhu modes [48]: Suppose Φ is an endomorphism of F0
that leaves O(F0) invariant and satisﬁes
ΦΩ= ψ
[Φ, VR(χ)] ∈N(F0)
for all χ ∈F0.
Then Φ ≈VL(ψ).
Proof: This follows from
Φ χ = Φ VR(χ)Ω≈VR(χ) Φ Ω= VR(χ)ψ = VR(χ) VL(ψ) Ω≈VL(ψ)χ ,
where we have used that VL(ψ)Ω= VR(ψ)Ω= ψ.
It is then an immediate consequence that
VL(VL(ψ)χ) ≈VL(ψ)VL(χ) ,
(216)
and a particular case of this (using again the fact that every element in N(F0) can be
written as VL(φ) for some suitable φ) is that
VL(N(ψ)χ) ≈N(ψ)VL(χ) .
(217)
In particular this implies that the product (208) φ ∗L ψ is well-deﬁned for both
φ, ψ ∈A(F0).
Furthermore, (216) shows that this product is associative, and thus
A(F0) has the structure of an algebra.
We can also deﬁne a product by φ ∗R ψ = VR(φ)ψ. Since
φ ∗L ψ = VL(φ)ψ = VL(φ)VR(ψ)Ω≈VR(ψ)VL(φ)Ω= VR(ψ)φ = ψ ∗R φ
this deﬁnes the reverse ring (or algebra) structure.
As we have explained before, this algebra plays the rˆole of the algebra of zero
modes. Since it has been constructed in terms of the space of states of the meromorphic
theory, all null-relations have been taken into account, and one may therefore expect
that its irreducible representations are in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible
representation of the meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory.
This is indeed true [16],
although the proof is rather non-trivial.
4.4. Finite (or Rational) Theories
Since Zhu’s algebra plays a central rˆole in characterising the structure of a conformal
ﬁeld theory, one may expect that the theories for which it is ﬁnite-dimensional are
particularly simple and tractable. In the physics literature these theories are sometimes
called rational [115], although it may seem more appropriate to call them ﬁnite, and

Conformal Field Theory
44
we shall from now on do so. The name rational originates from the observation that
the conformal weights of all states as well as the central charge are rational numbers in
these theories [116,117]. Unfortunately, there is no uniform deﬁnition of rationality, and
indeed, the notion is used somewhat diﬀerently in mathematics and physics; a survey
of the most common deﬁnitions is given in the appendix. In this paper we shall adopt
the convention that a theory is called ﬁnite if Zhu’s algebra is ﬁnite-dimensional, and
it is called rational if it satisﬁes the conditions of Zhu’s deﬁnition together with the C2
criterion (see the appendix).
The determination of Zhu’s algebra is usually rather diﬃcult since the modes N(ψ)
that generate the space O(F0) are not homogeneous with respect to L0.
It would
therefore be interesting to ﬁnd an equivalent condition for the ﬁniteness of a conformal
ﬁeld theory that is easier to analyse in practice. One such condition that implies (and
may be equivalent to) the ﬁniteness of a meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is the
so-called C2 condition of Zhu [16]: this is the condition that the quotient space
A(1)(F0) = H/O(1)(F0)
(218)
is ﬁnite-dimensional, where O(1)(F0) is spanned by the states of the form V−l(ψ)χ
where l ≥h, the conformal weight of ψ.††
It is not diﬃcult to show that the
dimension of Zhu’s algebra is bounded by that of the above quotient space [16], i.e.
dim(A(F0)) ≤dim(A(1)(F0)). In many cases the two dimensions are actually the same,
but this is not true in general; the simplest counter example is the theory associated to
the aﬃne algebra for g = e8 at level k = 1. As we have mentioned before, this theory can
equivalently be described as the meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory that is associated
to the self-dual root lattice of e8, and it is well known that its only representation is the
meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory itself [118]; the highest weight space of the vacuum
representation is one-dimensional, and Zhu’s algebra is therefore also one-dimensional.
On the other hand, it is clear that the dimension of A(1)(F0) is at least 249 since the
vacuum state and the 248 vectors of the form J a
−1Ω(where a runs over a basis of the
248-dimensional adjoint representation of e8) are linearly independent in A(1)(F0).
Many examples of ﬁnite conformal ﬁeld theories are known. Of the examples we
mentioned in section 3.7, the theories associated to even Euclidean lattices (3.7.4) are
always ﬁnite (and unitary) [118,119], the aﬃne theories (3.7.2) are ﬁnite if the level k
is a positive integer [59–61] (in which case the theory is also unitary), and the Virasoro
models (3.7.3) are ﬁnite if they belong to the so-called minimal series [4, 120]. This is
the case provided the central charge c is of the form
cp,q = 1 −6(p −q)2
pq
,
(219)
where p, q ≥2 are coprime integers. In this case there exist only ﬁnitely many irreducible
representations of the meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory. Each such representation is
††Incidentally, A(1)(F0) also has the structure of an abelian algebra; the signiﬁcance of this algebra is
however not clear at present.

Conformal Field Theory
45
the irreducible quotient space of a Verma module generated from a highest weight state
with conformal weight h, and the allowed values for h are
h(r,s) = (rp −qs)2 −(p −q)2
4pq
,
(220)
where 1 ≤r ≤q −1 and 1 ≤s ≤p−1, and (r, s) deﬁnes the same value as (q −r, p−s).
Each of the corresponding Verma modules has two null-vectors at conformal weights
h+rs and h+(p−r)(q−s), respectively, and the actual Fock space is the quotient space
of the Verma module by the subspace generated by these two null-vectors [68,69,121].
There are therefore (p −1)(q −1)/2 inequivalent irreducible highest weight
representations, and Zhu’s algebra has dimension (p −1)(q −1)/2, and is of the form
C[t]/
Y
(r,s)
(t −h(r,s)) .
(221)
In this case the dimension of Zhu’s algebra actually agrees with the dimension of the
homogeneous quotient space (218). Indeed, we can choose a basis for (218) to consist
of the states of the form Ll
−2Ω, where l = 0, 1, . . .. For c = cp,q the meromorphic Verma
module has a null-vector at level (p −1)(q −1) (since it corresponds to r = s = 1), and
since the coeﬃcient of L(p−1)(q−1)/2
−2
Ωin the null-vector does not vanish [120–122], this
allows us to express L(p−1)(q−1)/2
−2
Ωin terms of states in O(1)(F0), and thus shows that
the dimension of A(1)(F0) is indeed (p −1)(q −1)/2.
The minimal models include the unitary discrete series (138) for which we choose
p = m and q = m + 1, but they also include non-unitary ﬁnite theories. The theory
with (p, q) = (2, 3) is trivial since c = 0, and the simplest (non-trivial) unitary theory is
the so called Ising model for which (p, q) = (3, 4) [4]: this is the theory with c = 1
2, and
its allowed representations have conformal weight
h = 0
(vacuum)
h = 1
2
(energy)
h = 1
16
(spin) .
(222)
The simplest non-unitary ﬁnite theory is the Yang-Lee edge theory with (p, q) = (2, 5)
[123] for which c = −22
5 . This theory has only two allowed representations, the vacuum
representation with h = 0, and the representation with h = −1/5. It has also been
observed that the theory with (p, q) = (4, 5) can be identiﬁed with the tricritical Ising
model [124].
5. Fusion Rules, Correlation Functions and Verlinde’s Formula
Upto now we have analysed in detail the meromorphic subtheory and its representa-
tions, i.e. the zero- and two-point functions of the theory. In order to understand the
structure of the theory further we need to analyse next the amplitudes that involve more
than two non-trivial representations of the meromorphic subtheory. In a ﬁrst step we
shall consider the three-point functions that describe the allowed couplings between the
diﬀerent subspaces of H
H
H. We shall then also consider higher correlation functions; their
structure is in essence already determined in terms of the three-point functions.

Conformal Field Theory
46
5.1. Fusion Rules and the Comultiplication Formula
As we have explained before, the three-point amplitudes factorise into chiral and anti-
chiral functions. We can therefore restrict ourselves to discussing the corresponding
chiral amplitudes of the meromorphic theory, say. Their functional form is uniquely
determined, and one of the essential pieces of information is therefore whether the
corresponding amplitudes can be non-trivial or not; this is encoded in the so-called
fusion rules.
The deﬁnition of the fusion rule is actually slightly more complicated since there
can also be non-trivial multiplicities. In fact, the problem is rather analogous to that of
decomposing a tensor product representation (of a compact group, say) into irreducibles.
Because of the M¨obius covariance of the amplitudes, it is suﬃcient to consider the
amplitudes of the form
⟨φk(∞) V (ψ1, z1) · · · V (ψl, zl) φi(u1)φj(u2)⟩,
(223)
where the three non-meromorphic ﬁelds are φi, φj and φk, and we could set u1 = 1 and
u2 = 0, for example. The amplitude deﬁnes, in essence, an action of the meromorphic
ﬁelds on the product φi(u1)φj(u2), and the amplitude can only be non-trivial if this
product representation contains the representation that is conjugate to φk. Furthermore,
if this representation is contained a ﬁnite number of times in the product representation
φi(u1)φj(u2), there is a ﬁnite ambiguity in deﬁning the amplitude. We therefore deﬁne,
more precisely, the fusion rule N k
ij to be the multiplicity with which the representation
conjugate to φk appears in φi(u1)φj(u2).
The action of the meromorphic ﬁelds (or rather their modes) on the product of
the two ﬁelds can actually be described rather explicitly using the comultiplication
formula [40, 125, 126]:† let us denote by A the algebra of modes of the meromorphic
ﬁelds. A comultiplication is a homomorphism
∆: A →A ⊗A ,
Vn(ψ) 7→
X
∆(1)(Vn(ψ)) ⊗∆(2)(Vn(ψ)) ,
(224)
and it deﬁnes an action on the product of two ﬁelds as
Vn(ψ)


=
X  ∆(1)(Vn(ψ))φi

(u1)
 ∆(2)(Vn(ψ))φj

(u2) .
(225)
Here the action of the modes of the meromorphic ﬁelds on φi or φj is deﬁned as in (187).
The comultiplication depends on u1 and u2, and for the modes of a ﬁeld ψ of conformal
weight h, it is explicitly given as

(228)
where each χj can be a meromorphic or a non-meromorphic ﬁeld and we have used the
notation of (225). In fact, the comultiplication formula can be derived from (228) using
the fact that the amplitude ⟨Q
j V (χj, ζj)V (ψ, z)φi(u1)φj(u2)⟩from which the above
expression can be obtained by integration has only poles (as a function of z) for z = ζj
and z = ui [125,126].
The above formula is not symmetric under the exchange of φi and φj. In fact, it is
manifest from the derivation that (228) must also hold if the comultiplication formulae
(226) and (227) are replaced by

Since the two formulae agree in every amplitude, the product space is
therefore the ring-like tensor product, i.e. the quotient of the direct product by the
relations that guarantee that ∆= e∆; this construction is based on an idea of Richard
Borcherds, unpublished (see [125]).
A priori it is not clear whether the actual product space may not be even smaller.
However, the fusion rules for a number of models have been calculated with this
‡ It is a priori ambiguous whether a given vector in a representation space is fermionic or not. However,
once a convention has been chosen for one element, the fermion number of any element that can be
obtained from it by the action of the modes of the meromorphic ﬁelds is well deﬁned.

Conformal Field Theory
48
deﬁnition [126, 131], and the results coincide with those obtained by other methods.
Indeed, fusion rules were ﬁrst determined, for the case of the minimal models, by
considering the implications for the amplitudes of the diﬀerential equations that follow
from the condition that a null-vector of a representation must vanish in all amplitudes [4]:
if the central charge c is given in terms of (p, q) as in (219), the highest weight
representations are labelled by (r, s), where h is deﬁned by (220) and 1 ≤r ≤q −1 and
1 ≤s ≤p −1; the fusion rules are then given as
(r1, s1) ⊗(r2, s2)
min(r1+r2−1,2q−1−r1−r2)
M
r=|r1−r2|+1
min(s1+s2−1,2p−1−s1−s2)
M
s=|s1−s2|+1
(r, s) , (231)
where r and s attain only every other value, i.e. r (s) is even if r1 + r2 −1 (s1 + s2 −1)
is even, and odd otherwise.
The analysis of [4] was adapted for the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models in [60].
For a general aﬃne algebra ˆg, the fusion rules can be determined from the so-called depth
rule; in the speciﬁc case of g = su(2) at level k, this leads to
j1 ⊗j2 =
min(j1+j2,k−j1−j2)
M
j=|j1−j2|
j ,
(232)
where j is integer if j1 + j2 is integer, and half-integer otherwise, and the highest weight
representations are labelled by j = 0, 1/2, . . . , k/2. A closed expression for the fusion
rules in the general case is provided by the Kac-Walton formula [64,132–134].
Similarly, the fusion rules have been determined for the W3 algebra in [135], the
N = 1 superconformal minimal models in [136] and the N = 2 superconformal minimal
models in [137, 138].
For ﬁnite theories the fusion rules can also be obtained by
performing the analogue of Zhu’s construction in each representation space; this was ﬁrst
done (in a slightly diﬀerent language) by Feigin & Fuchs for the minimal models [139],
and later by Frenkel & Zhu for general vertex operator algebras [61]. (As was pointed
out by Li [140], the analysis of Frenkel & Zhu only holds under additional assumptions,
for example in the rational case.)
One of the advantages of the approach that we have adopted here is the fact
that structural properties of fusion can be derived in this framework [141]. For each
representation Hj, let us deﬁne the subspace F −
j of the Fock space Fj to be the space
that is spanned by the vectors of the form
V−n(ψ)Φ
where Φ ∈Fj and n ≥h(ψ).
(233)
We call a representation quasi-rational provided that the quotient space
Fj/F −
j
(234)
is ﬁnite-dimensional. This quotient space (or rather a realisation of it as a subspace of
Fj) is usually called the special subspace.
It was shown by Nahm [141] that the fusion product of a quasi-rational represen-
tation and a highest weight representation contains only ﬁnitely many highest weight

Conformal Field Theory
49
representations.
He also showed that the special subspace of the fusion product of
two quasi-rational representations is ﬁnite-dimensional. In fact, if we denote by ds
j the
dimension of the special subspace, we have
X
k
N k
ijds
k ≤ds
ids
j .
(235)
In particular, these results imply that the set of quasi-rational representations of a
meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is closed under the operation of taking fusion
products. It is believed that every representation of a ﬁnite meromorphic conformal
ﬁeld theory is quasi-rational [141], but quasi-rationality is a weaker condition and there
also exist quasi-rational representations of meromorphic theories that are not ﬁnite. The
simplest example is the Virasoro theory for which c is given by (219), but p and q are not
(coprime) integers greater than one. This theory is not ﬁnite, but every highest weight
representation with h = hr,s as in (220) and r, s positive integers is quasi-rational. (This
is a consequence of the fact that such a representation has a null-vector with conformal
weight h+rs, whose coeﬃcient of Lrs
−1 is non-zero.) In fact, the collection of all of these
representations is closed under fusion, and forms a ‘quasi-rational’ chiral conformal ﬁeld
theory.
5.2. Indecomposable Fusion Products and Logarithmic Theories
In much of the above discussion we have implicitly assumed that the fusion product of
any two irreducible representations of the chiral conformal ﬁeld theory can be completely
decomposed into irreducible representations.
Whilst this is indeed correct for most
theories of interest, there exist a few models where this is not the case. These theories
are usually called logarithmic theories since, as we shall explain, some of their correlation
functions contain logarithms. In this subsection we shall give a brief account of this class
of theories; since the general theory has only been developed for theories for which this
problem is absent, the present subsection is something of an interlude and not crucial
for the rest of this article.
The simplest example of a logarithmic theory is the (quasi-rational) Virasoro model
with p = 2, q = 1 whose conformal charge is c = −2 [142]. As we have explained before,
the quasi-rational (irreducible) representations of this theory have a highest weight
vector with conformal weight h = hr,s (220), where r and s are positive integers. Since
the formula for hr,s has the symmetry (for p = 2, q = 1)
hr,s = h1−r,2−s = hr−1,s−2 ,
(236)
we can restrict ourselves to the values (r, s) with s = 1, 2.
The vacuum representation is (r, s) = (1, 1) with conformal weight h = 0; the null-
vector at level rs = 1 is L−1Ω. The simplest non-trivial representation is (r, s) = (1, 2)
with h = −1/8; it has a null-vector at level rs = 2. As we have alluded to before, a
null-vector of a representation gives rise to a diﬀerential equation for the corresponding

Conformal Field Theory
50
amplitude [4]. In the present case, if we denote by µ the highest weight state with
conformal weight h = −1/8, the 4-point function involving four times µ has the form
⟨µ(z1)µ(z2)µ(z3)µ(z4)⟩= (z1 −z3)
1
4 (z2 −z4)
1
4 (x(1 −x))
1
4 F(x) ,
(237)
where we have used the M¨obius symmetry, and x denotes the cross-ratio
x = (z1 −z2)(z3 −z4)
(z1 −z3)(z2 −z4) .
(238)
The null-vector for µ gives then rise to a diﬀerential equation for F which, in the present
case, is given by
x(1 −x)F ′′(x) + (1 −2x)F ′(x) −1
4F(x) = 0 .
(239)
We can make an ansatz for F as
F(x) = xs  a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · ·

,
(240)
where a0 ̸= 0. The diﬀerential equation (239) then determines the ai recursively provided
we can solve the indicial equation, i.e. the equation that comes from the coeﬃcient of
xs−1,
s(s −1) + s = s2 = 0 .
(241)
Generically, the indicial equation has two distinct roots (that do not diﬀer by an integer),
and for each solution of the indicial equation there is a solution of the original diﬀerential
equation that is of the form (240). However, if the two roots coincide (as in our case),
only one solution of the diﬀerential equation is of the form (240), and the general solution
to (239) is
F(x) = AG(x) + B [G(x) log(x) + H(x)] ,
(242)
where G and H are regular at x = 0 (since s = 0 solves (241)), and A and B are
constants. In fact,
G(x) =
Z

dϕ

,
(243)
and
G(x) log(x) + H(x) = G(1 −x) .
(244)
This implies that the 4-point function necessarily has a logarithmic branch cut: if F is
regular at x = 0, i.e. if we choose B = 0, then because of (244), F has a logarithmic
branch cut at x = 1.
In terms of the representation theory this logarithmic behaviour is related to the
property of the fusion product of µ with itself not to be completely reducible: by
considering a suitable limit of z1, z2 →∞in the above 4-point function we can obtain
a state Ω′ satisfying

where A and B are constants (that depend now on Ω′). We can therefore write

(246)
where ⟨Ω′(∞)ω(0)⟩= A and ⟨Ω′(∞)Ω(0)⟩= B. Next we consider the transformation of
this amplitude under a rotation by 2π; this is implemented by the M¨obius transformation

(248)
Comparing (247) with (248) we then ﬁnd that
e2πiL0Ω= Ω
(249)
e2πiL0ω = ω + 2πiΩ,
(250)
i.e. L0Ω= 0, L0ω = Ω. Thus we ﬁnd that the scaling operator L0 is not diagonalisable,
but that it acts as a Jordan block
 
0

(251)
on the space spanned by Ωand ω.
Since L0 is diagonalisable in every irreducible
representation, it follows that the fusion product is necessarily not completely decompo-
sable. This conclusion holds actually more generally whenever any correlation function
contains a logarithm.
One can analyse the fusion product of µ with itself using the comultiplication
formula, and this allows one to determine the structure of the resulting representation
R1,1 in detail [143]: the representation is generated from a highest weight state ω
satisfying
L0ω = Ω,
L0Ω= 0 ,
Lnω = 0
for n > 0
(252)
by the action of the Virasoro algebra. The state L−1Ωis a null-state of R1,1, but L−1ω
is not null since L1L−1ω = [L1, L−1]ω = 2L0ω = 2Ω. Schematically the representation
can therefore be described as

Here each vertex • denotes a state of the representation space, and the vertices ×
correspond to null-vectors. An arrow A −→B indicates that the vertex B is in the
image of A under the action of the Virasoro algebra. The representation R1,1 is not
irreducible since the states that are obtained by the action of the Virasoro algebra from
Ωform the subrepresentation H0 of R1,1 (that is actually isomorphic to the vacuum
representation). On the other hand, R1,1 is not completely reducible since we cannot
ﬁnd a complementary subspace to H0 that is a representation by itself; R1,1 is therefore
called an indecomposable (but reducible) representation.
Actually, R1,1 is the simplest example of a whole class of indecomposable
representations that appear in fusion products of the irreducible quasi-rational represen-
tations; these indecomposable representations are labelled by (m, n) where now n = 1,
and their structure is schematically described as

53
set of representations that consists of all quasi-rational irreducible representations and
the above indecomposable representations closes under fusion, i.e. any fusion product
of two such representations can be decomposed as a direct sum of these representations.
This model is not an isolated example; the same structure is also present for the
Virasoro models with q = 1 where p is any positive integer [143–145]. Furthermore, the
WZNW model on the supergroup GL(1, 1) [146] and gravitationally dressed conformal
ﬁeld theories [147,148] are also known to deﬁne logarithmic theories. It was conjectured
by Dong & Mason [149] (using a diﬀerent language) that logarithms can only occur if the
theory is not ﬁnite, i.e. if the number of irreducible representations is inﬁnite. However,
this does not seem to be correct since the triplet algebra [150] has only ﬁnitely many
irreducible representations, but contains indecomposable representations in their fusion
products that lead to logarithmic correlation functions [151]. Logarithmic conformal
ﬁeld theories are not actually pathological; as was shown in [41] a consistent local
conformal ﬁeld theory that satisﬁes all conditions of a local theory (including modular
invariance of the partition function) can be associated to this triplet algebra. The space
of states of this local theory is then a certain quotient of the direct sum of tensor
products of indecomposable representations of the two chiral algebras.
5.3. Verlinde’s Formula
If all chiral representations Hj as well as their fusion products are completely reducible
into irreducibles, we can deﬁne for each irreducible representation Hj, its conjugate
representation Hj∨. The conjugate representation has the property that at least one two-
point function involving a state from Hj and a state from Hj∨is non-trivial. Because of
Schur’s lemma the conjugation map is uniquely deﬁned, and by construction it is clearly
an involution, i.e. (j∨)∨= j.
If conjugation is deﬁned, the condition that the fusion product of Hi and Hj
contains the representation Hk is equivalent to the condition that the three-point
function involving a state from Hi, one from Hj and one from Hk∨is non-trivial; thus we
can identify N k
ij with the number of diﬀerent three-point functions of suitable φi ∈Hi,
φj ∈Hj and φk∨∈Hk∨. It is then natural to deﬁne
Nijk ≡N k∨
ij ,
(259)
which is manifestly symmetric under the exchange of i, j and k.
The fusion product is also associative,
X

(260)
If we deﬁne Ni to be the matrix with matrix elements
(Ni)k
j ≡N k

(261)
then (260) can be rewritten as

(Ni)k
j (Nl)m
k =

(Nl)k
j (Ni)m

(262)

Conformal Field Theory
54
where we have used (259). Thus the matrices Ni commute with each other.
Because of (259) the matrices Ni are normal, i.e. they commute with their adjoint
(or transpose) since N†
i = Ni∨. This implies that each Ni can be diagonalised, and
since the diﬀerent Ni commute, there exists a common matrix S that diagonalises all
Ni simultaneously. If we denote the diﬀerent eigenvalues of Ni by λ(l)
i , we therefore
have that

(263)
If j is the vacuum representation, i.e. j = 0, then N k
i0 = δk
i if all representations labelled
by i are irreducible. In this case, multiplying all three expressions of (263) by Sn
k from
the right (and summing over k), we ﬁnd
Sn
i =

(265)
What we have done so far has been a rather trivial manipulation. However, the deep
conjecture is now that the matrix S that diagonalises the fusion rules coincides precisely
with the matrix S (15) that describes the modular transformation properties of the
characters associated to the irreducible representations [152]. Thus (265) provides an
expression for the fusion rules in terms of the modular properties of the corresponding
characters; with this interpretation, (265) is called the Verlinde formula.
This is a
remarkable formula, not least because it is not obvious in general why the right-hand-
side of (265) should deﬁne a non-negative integer. In fact, using techniques from Galois
theory, one can show that this property implies severe constraints on the matrix elements
of S [153,154].
The Verlinde formula has been tested for many conformal ﬁeld theories, and
whenever it makes sense (i.e. whenever the theory is rational), it is indeed correct. It
has also been proven for the case of the WZNW models of the classical groups at integer
level [155], and it follows from the polynomial equations of Moore & Seiberg [115] to be
discussed below.
5.4. Higher Correlation Functions and the Polynomial Relations of Moore & Seiberg
The higher correlation functions of the local theory do not directly factorise into products
of chiral and anti-chiral functions, but they can always be written as sums of such
products. It is therefore useful to analyse the functional form of these chiral functions.
The actual (local) amplitudes (that are linear combinations of products of the chiral and
anti-chiral amplitudes) can then be determined from these by the conditions that (i)
they have to be local, and (ii) the operator product expansion (7) is indeed associative.
These constraints deﬁne the so-called bootstrap equations [4]; in practice they are rather

Conformal Field Theory
55
diﬃcult to solve, and explicit solutions are only known for a relatively small number of
examples [41,156–164].
The chiral n-point functions are largely determined in terms of the three-point
functions of the theory. In particular, the number of diﬀerent solutions for a given set
of non-meromorphic ﬁelds can be deduced from the fusion rules of the theory.§ Let us
consider, as an example, the case of a 4-point function, where the four non-meromorphic
ﬁelds φi ∈Hmi, i = 1, . . . , 4 are inserted at u1, . . . , u4. (It will become apparent from
the following discussion how this generalises to arbitrary higher correlation functions.)
In the limit in which u2 →u1 (with u3 and u4 far away), the 4-point function can be
thought of as a three-point function whose non-meromorphic ﬁeld at u1 ≈u2 is the
fusion product of φ1 and φ2; we can therefore write every 4-point function involving
φ1, . . ., φ4 as
⟨φ1(u1)φ2(u2)φ3(u3)φ4(u4)⟩=
X
k
N k
m1m2
X
i=1

Φk,i

E
,
(266)
where Φk,i
12(u1, u2) ∈Hk, αk,i are arbitrary constants, and the sum extends over those
k for which N k
m1m2 ≥1.
The number of diﬀerent three-point functions involving
Φk
12(u1, u2) ∈Hk, φ3 and φ4, is given by N k∨
m3m4, and the number of diﬀerent solutions
is therefore altogether
X
k
N k
m1m2N k∨
m3m4 .
(267)
The space of chiral 4-point functions is a vector space (since any linear combination
of 4-point functions is again a 4-point function), and in the above we have selected a
speciﬁc basis for this space; in fact the diﬀerent basis vectors (i.e. the solutions in terms
of which we have expanded (266)) are characterised by the condition that they can be
approximated by a product of three-point functions as u2 →u1. In the notation of
Moore & Seiberg [40], these solutions are described by
⟨φ1|
 m2
m1 k

u2;a
(φ2)
 m3

where we have used the M¨obius invariance to set, without loss of generality, u1 = ∞
and u4 = 0. Here,
 i

describes the so-called chiral vertex operator that is associated to φ ∈Hi; it is the
restriction of φ(u) to Hk, where the image is projected onto Hj and a labels the diﬀerent
such projections (if N j
ik ≥2). This deﬁnition has to be treated with some care since φ(u)
§ Since the functional form of the amplitudes is no longer determined by M¨obius symmetry, it is possible
(and indeed usually the case) that there are more than one amplitude for a given set of irreducible
highest weight representations; see for example the 4-point function that we considered in section 5.2.

Conformal Field Theory
56
is strictly speaking not a well-deﬁned operator on the direct sum of the chiral spaces,
⊕iHi — indeed, if it were, there would only be one 4-point function!∥
In the above we have expanded the 4-point functions in terms of a basis of functions
each of which approximates a product of three-point functions as u2 →u1. We could
equally consider the basis of functions to consist of those functions that approximate
products of three-point functions as u2 →u3; in the notation of Moore & Seiberg [40]
these are described by
⟨φ1|


u3;c
(χ) |φ4⟩· ⟨χ|
 m2

u2−u3;d

(270)
Since both sets of functions form a basis for the same vector space, their number must
be equal; there are (267) elements in the ﬁrst set of basis vectors, and the number of
basis elements of the form (270) is
X
k
N k
m1m4N k∨
m2m3 .
(271)
The two expressions are indeed equal, as follows from (260) upon setting m1 = j, m2 = i,
m3 = ¯m, m4 = l, and using (259). We can furthermore express the two sets of basis
vectors in terms of each other; this is achieved by the so-called fusing matrix of Moore
& Seiberg [40],

We can also consider the basis of functions that are approximated by products of
three-point functions as u3 →u1 (rather than u2 →u1). These basis functions are
described, in the notation of Moore & Seiberg [40], by
⟨φ1|
 m3

u3;c
(φ3)
 m2

(273)
By similar arguments to the above, it is easy to see that the number of such basis vectors
is the same as (267) or (271). Furthermore, we can express the basis vectors in (268) in
terms of the new basis vectors (273) as

(274)
where B is the so-called braiding matrix. Since the correlation functions are not single-
valued, the braiding matrix depends on the equivalence class of paths along which the
conﬁguration u2 ≈u1 (with u4 far away) is analytically continued to the conﬁguration
u3 ≈u1. In fact, there are two such equivalence classes which diﬀer by a path along
which u3 encircles u2 once; we distinguish the corresponding braiding matrices by B(±).
∥It is possible to give an operator description for the chiral theory (at least for the case of the WZNW-
models) by considering, instead of Hi, the tensor product of Hi with a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space
that is a certain truncation of the corresponding anti-chiral representation H¯ı [165, 166]. This also
provides a natural interpretation for the quantum group symmetry to be discussed below.

Conformal Field Theory
57
The two matrices (272) and (274) have been derived in the context of 4-point
functions, but the notation we have used suggests that the corresponding identities
should hold more generally, namely for products of chiral vertex operators in any
correlation function.
As we can always consider the limit in which the remaining
coordinates coalesce (so that the amplitude approximates a 4-point function), this must
be true in every consistent conformal ﬁeld theory. On the other hand, the identities
(272) and (274) can only be true in general provided that the matrices F and B satisfy a
number of consistency conditions; these are usually called the polynomial equations [115].
The simplest relation is that which allows to describe the braiding matrix B in
terms of the fusing matrix F, and the diagonalisable matrix Ω. The latter is deﬁned by

z;a

(275)
where again the sign ± distinguishes between clockwise (or anti-clockwise) analytic
continuation of the ﬁeld in Hm around that in Hl. Since all three representations are
irreducible, Ω(±) is just a phase,
 Ω(±)k
lm
b
a = sae±iπ(hk−hl−hm)δb
a ,
(276)
where sa = ±1, and hi is the conformal weight of the highest weight state in Hi. In
order to describe now B in terms of F, we apply the fusing matrix to obtain the right-
hand-side of (272); braiding now corresponds to Ω(applied to the second and third
representation), and in order to recover the right-hand-side of (274), we have to apply
the inverse of F again. Thus we ﬁnd [40]
B(ϵ) = F −1 (1l ⊗Ω(−ϵ)) F .
(277)
The consistency conditions that have to be satisﬁed by B and F can therefore be
formulated in terms of F and Ω. In essence, there are two non-trivial identities, the
pentagon identity, and the hexagon identity. The former can be obtained by considering
sequences of fusing identities in a 5-point function, and is explictly given as [40]
F23F12F23 = P23F13F12 ,
(278)
where F12 acts on the ﬁrst two representation spaces, etc., and P23 is the permutation
matrix that exchanges the second and third representation space. The hexagon identity
can be derived by considering a sequence of transformations involving F and Ωin a
4-point function [40]
F(Ω(ϵ) ⊗1l)F = (1l ⊗Ω(ϵ)) F (1l ⊗Ω(ϵ)) .
(279)
It was shown by Moore & Seiberg [40] using category theory that all relations that arise
from comparing diﬀerent expansions of an arbitrary n-point function on the sphere are
a consequence of the pentagon and hexagon identity. This is a deep result which allows
us, at least in principle (and ignoring problems of convergence, etc.), to construct all
n-point functions of the theory from the three-point functions. Indeed, the three-point
functions determine in essence the chiral vertex operators, and by composing these
operators as above, we can construct a basis for an arbitrary n-point function. If F and

Conformal Field Theory
58
Ωsatisfy the pentagon and hexagon identities, the resulting space will be independent
of the particular expansion we used.
Actually, Moore & Seiberg also solved the problem for the case of arbitrary n-point
functions on an arbitrary surface of genus g. (The proof in [40] is not quite complete;
see however [167].) In this case there are three additional consistency conditions that
originate from considering correlation functions on the torus and involve the modular
transformation matrix S (see [40] for more details). As was also shown in [40] this
extended set of relations implies Verlinde’s formula.
5.5. Quantum Groups
It was observed in [40] that every (compact) group G gives rise to matrices F and B (or
Ω) that satisfy the polynomial equations: let us denote by {Ri} the set of irreducible
representations of G. Every tensor product of two irreducible representations can be
decomposed into irreducibles,
Ri ⊗Rj = ⊕kV k
ij ⊗Rk ,
(280)
where the vector space V k
ij can be identiﬁed with the space of intertwining operators,
 k
i j

: Ri ⊗Rj →Rk ,
(281)
and dim(V k
ij) is the multiplicity with which Rk appears in the tensor product of Ri and
Rj. There exist natural isomorphisms between representations,
ˆΩ: Ri ⊗Rj ∼= Rj ⊗Ri
(282)
ˆF : (Ri ⊗Rj) ⊗Rk ∼= Ri ⊗(Rj ⊗Rk) ,
(283)
and they induce isomorphisms on the space of intertwining operators,
Ω: V k

Thus the representation ring of a compact group gives rise to a solution of the polynomial
relations; the fusion rules are then identiﬁed as N k
ij = dim(V k
ij).

Conformal Field Theory
59
The F and B matrices that are associated to a chiral conformal ﬁeld theory are,
however, usually not of this form. Indeed, for compact groups we have Ω2 = 1 since the
tensor product is symmetric, but because of (276) this would require that the conformal
weights of all highest weight states are half-integer which is not the case for most
conformal ﬁeld theories of interest. For a general conformal ﬁeld theory the relation
Ω2 = 1 is replaced by Ω(+)Ω(−) = 1; this is a manifestation of the fact that the ﬁelds
of a (two-dimensional) conformal ﬁeld theory obey braid group statistics rather than
permutation group statistics [168,169].
On the other hand, many conformal ﬁeld theories possess a ‘classical limit’ [40] in
which the conformal dimensions tend to zero, and in this limit the F and B matrices
come from compact groups. This suggests [40,170] that the actual F and B matrices of a
chiral conformal ﬁeld theory can be thought of as being associated to the representation
theory of a quantum group [171–174], a certain deformation of a group (for reviews
on quantum groups see [175, 176]).
Indeed, the chiral conformal ﬁeld theory of the
WZNW model associated to the aﬃne algebra
ˆ
su(2) at level k has the same F and
B matrices [177, 178] as the quantum group Uq(sl(2)) [179] at q = eiπ/(k+2) [180].
Similar relations have also been found for the WZNW models associated to the other
groups [181], and the minimal models [160,170].
These observations suggest that chiral conformal ﬁeld theories may have a hidden
quantum group symmetry. Various attempts have been made to realise the relevant
quantum group generators in terms of the chiral conformal ﬁeld theory [182–185]
but no clear picture has emerged so far. A diﬀerent proposal has been put forward
in [166] following [165] (see also [186,187]). According to this idea the quantum group
symmetry acts naturally on a certain (ﬁnite-dimensional) truncation of the anti-chiral
representation space, namely the special subspace; these anti-chiral degrees of freedom
arise naturally in an operator formulation of the chiral theory.
The actual quantum symmetries that arise for rational theories are typically
quantum groups at roots of unity; tensor products of certain representations of such
quantum groups are then not completely reducible [188], and in order to obtain a
structure as in (280), it is necessary to truncate the tensor products in a suitable
way. The resulting symmetry structure is then more correctly described as a quasi-Hopf
algebra [189,190]. In fact, the underlying structure of a chiral conformal ﬁeld theory must
be a quasi-Hopf algebra (rather than a normal quantum group) whenever the quantum
dimensions are not integers: to each representation Hi we can associate (because of the
Perron-Frobenius theorem) a unique positive real number di, the quantum dimension,
so that
didj =
X
k
N k
ijdk ,
(286)
where N k
ij are the fusion rules; if the symmetry structure of the conformal ﬁeld theory
is described by a quantum group, the choice di = dim(Ri) satisﬁes (286), and thus each

quantum dimension must be a positive integer. It follows from (265) that
di = Si0
S00
(287)
satisﬁes (286); for unitary theories this expression is a positive number, and thus
coincides with the quantum dimension. For most theories of interest this number is
not an integer for all i.
It has been shown in [191] (see also [192]) that for every rational chiral conformal
ﬁeld theory, a weak quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebra exists that reproduces the fusing
and the braiding matrices of the conformal ﬁeld theory. This quasi-Hopf algebra is
however not unique; for every choice of positive integers Di satisfying
DiDj ≥
X
k
N k
ijDk
(288)
such a quasi-Hopf algebra can be constructed. As we have seen above, the dimensions
of the special subspaces ds
i satisfy this inequality (235) provided that they are ﬁnite;
this gives rise to one preferred such quasi-Hopf algebra in this case [166,187].
The quantum groups at roots of unity also play a central rˆole in the various knot
invariants that have been constructed starting with the work of Jones [193–195]. These
have also a direct relation to the braiding matrices of conformal ﬁeld theories [168,169]
and can be interpreted in terms of 2 + 1 dimensional Chern-Simons theory [196,197].
6. Conclusions and Outlook
Let us conclude this review with a summary of general problems in conformal ﬁeld
theory that deserve, in our opinion, further work.
1. The local theory: It is generally believed that to every modular invariant partition
function of tensor products of representations of a chiral algebra, a consistent local
theory can be deﬁned. Unfortunately, only very few local theories have been constructed
in detail, and there are virtually no general results (see however [198]).
Recently it has been realised that the operator product expansion coeﬃcients in a
boundary conformal ﬁeld theory can be expressed in terms of certain elements of the
fusing matrix F [32–34]. Since there exists a close relation between the operator product
expansion coeﬃcients of the boundary theory and those of the bulk theory, this may
open the way for a general construction of local conformal ﬁeld theories.
2. Algebraic formulae for fusing and braiding matrices: Essentially all of the structure of
conformal ﬁeld theory can be described in terms of the representation theory of certain
algebraic structures. However, in order to obtain the fusing and braiding matrices that
we discussed above, it is necessary to analyse the analytical properties of correlation
functions, in particular their monodromy matrices. If it is indeed true that the whole
structure is determined by the algebraic data of the theory, a direct (representation
theoretic) expression should exist for these matrices as well.

3. Finite versus rational: As we have explained in this article (and as is indeed illustrated
by the appendix), there are diﬀerent conditions that guarantee that diﬀerent aspects of
the theory are well-behaved in some sense. Unfortunately, it is not clear at the moment
what the precise logical relation between the diﬀerent conditions are, and which of them
is crucial in distinguishing between theories that are tractable, and those that are less so.
In this context it would also be very interesting to understand under which conditions
the correlation functions (of representations of the meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory)
do not contain logarithmic branch cuts.
4. Existence of higher correlation functions: It is generally believed that the higher
correlation functions of representations of a ﬁnite conformal ﬁeld theory deﬁne analytic
functions that have appropriate singularities and branch cuts. This is actually a crucial
assumption in the deﬁnition of the fusing and braiding matrices, and therefore in the
derivation of the polynomial relations of Moore & Seiberg (from which Verlinde’s formula
can be derived). It would be interesting to prove this in general.
5. Higher genus: Despite recent advances in our understanding of the theory on higher
genus Riemann surfaces [27–29], a completely satisfactory treatment for the case of a
general conformal ﬁeld theory is not available at present.
Appendix A. Deﬁnitions of Rationality
Appendix A.1. Zhu’s Deﬁnition
According to [16], a meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is rational if it has only ﬁnitely
many irreducible highest weight representations.
The Fock space of each of these
representations has ﬁnite-dimensional weight spaces, i.e. for each eigenvalue of L0, the
corresponding eigenspace is ﬁnite-dimensional.
Furthermore, each ﬁnitely generated
representation is a direct sum of these irreducible representations.
If a meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is rational in this sense, Zhu’s algebra is
a semi-simple complex algebra, and therefore ﬁnite-dimensional [16,199]. Zhu has also
conjectured that every such theory satisﬁes the C2 criterion, i.e. the condition that the
quotient space (218) is ﬁnite-dimensional.
If a meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is rational in this sense and satisﬁes the
C2 condition then the characters of its representations deﬁne a representation of the
modular group SL(2, Z) [16].
Appendix A.2. The DLM Deﬁnitions
Dong, Li & Mason call a representation admissible if it satisﬁes the representation
criterion (i.e. if the corresponding amplitudes satisfy the condition (186)), and if it
possesses a decomposition of the form ⊕∞
n=0Mn+λ, where λ is ﬁxed and Vn(ψ)Mµ ⊂Mµ−n
for µ = λ + m for some m.
A meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is then called
rational if every admissible representation can be decomposed into irreducible admissible
representations.

Conformal Field Theory
62
If a meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is rational in this sense, then Zhu’s algebra
is a semi-simple complex algebra (and hence ﬁnite-dimensional), every irreducible
admissible representation is an irreducible representation for which each Mµ is ﬁnite-
dimensional and an eigenspace of L0, and the number of irreducible representations is
ﬁnite [199].
This deﬁnition of rationality therefore implies Zhu’s notion of rationality, but it is
not clear whether the converse is true.
It has been conjectured by Dong & Mason [149] that the ﬁnite-dimensionality
of Zhu’s algebra implies rationality (in either sense).
This is not true as has been
demonstrated by the counterexample of Gaberdiel & Kausch [151].
Appendix A.3. Physicists Deﬁnition
Physicists call a meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory rational if it has ﬁnitely many
irreducible highest weight representations.
Each of these has a Fock space with
ﬁnite-dimensional L0 eigenspaces, and the characters of these representations form a
representation of the modular group SL(2, Z). (Sometimes this last condition is not
imposed.)
If a meromorphic conformal ﬁeld theory is rational in the sense of Zhu and satisﬁes
the C2 condition, then it is rational in the above sense.
The notion of rationality is also sometimes applied to the whole conformal ﬁeld
theory:
a conformal ﬁeld theory is called rational if its meromorphic and anti-
meromorphic conformal subtheories are rational.
