INTRODUCTION 
UP to the present the English public-and in this 
I do not for one moment pretend that the English 
public is different from any other-has found it 
difficult to conceive that a novelist can, or indeed 
should, be anything else than a teller of stories. 
That he should be a philosopher in the sense that 
his work should be the profound expression of his 
attitude towards life ; that this attitude should 
decide the manner in which he presents his experi­
ences ; and finally that only by virtue of the passion 
which the problem rather than the fact of life 
awakens in his soul he is worthy to be called a great 
novelist-these arc yet far from being the common­
places of criticism that they should be. 
It is not the whole truth of the novelist. 
The 
novelist does indeed tell a story of lives and miseries 
and triumphs that are particular and human ; but 
he also speaks a parable. 
Those who read the 
story and do not understand the parable are per­
haps blessed, but they are blessed as the poor in 
spirit. 
And those who profess to understand the 
parable without loving and being moved by the 
humanity of the story are liars, and there is no 
health in them. 
On this side English readers and 

Vlll 
IXTRODUCTION 
English criticism will not fail. 
On the other it will 
and does. 
And yet the issue is simple. 
An artist, great or 
small, works for the salvation of his own soul above 
all other things. 
If he works for other things he 
is a journeyman and a hireling. 
If he is a novelist, 
he may write because he looks upon the world and 
sees that it is good, and his joy is such that he must 
recreate it for others, infused with the joy that he 
has found in it. 
But it must not be forgotten that 
joy and acceptance are a perfect and complete 
philosophy. They are even the greatest of all 
philosophies when they do not exclude misgiving 
and perplexity, when doubt is weighed in the 
balance against certainty and cannot prevail. 
But 
artists like these belong to the heroes of old. 
The 
man who in modern times was most richly endowed 
with their spirit was Tolstoi. But the old confidence 
left him, and left him a prey to doubts and torments 
that seemed to his accepting mind so horrible and 
unnatural that he dared not reveal them. 
There 
has been none like Tolstoi these hundred years, for 
his deep and miraculous joy in life ; and if this 
failed him, surely we may conclude that the age 
of acceptance is past, and that the men who will 
speak for the humanity of the future will be those 
who have wrestled all their lives long with a great 
doubt, who will endeavour to prove that there is 
a good hope, and yet will always in their heart of 
hearts mistrust their reasoning. 
I have said we 

INTRODUCTION 
lX 
may conclude this ; but it is indeed no matter of 
conclusion or argument. 
It is now become a part 
of our inheritance. 
But that a great artist should be essentially like 
ourselves-this is so hard for many to allow. 
Art 
must be a miracle to them, or it is not art. 
That 
they should be taken by the sleeve and invited to 
look into the secret impulses of the artist's soul is 
so much sacrilege to them, that even if they have 
seen they will deny that anything was there. 
And 
perhaps they are speaking truth. 
Perhaps there is 
not one general life, but many lives ; and between 
them a gulf is fixed, so that the one will never under­
stand the other. 
But there will still be tho<>c who 
believe themselves on the side of the artists, and 
who, because they believe it, will be truly on their 
side, who believe that somehow art is the supreme 
human activity, that it is an abstract and brief 
chronicle of time, of life, of all philosophies, all 
aspirations, all re2.lities. 
They will never believe 
that art is set apart from them by the gulf of a 
miracle, or that the soul of even the greatest among 
artists passes their understanding. 
Perhaps they 
are wrong, but they will go to their grave in the 
delusion, for without it they cannot live. 
First to understand themselves, then to reach out 
after the souls of the mighty ones who have spoken 
for them, to live it may be lonely, but at least upon 
the heights. 
Perhaps this is after all only one of 
many lives, but it is no ignoble one. 
And what 

X 
INTRODUCTION 
if the heights arc not heights at all, so long as we 
believe they are, and to believe otherwise is, to us, 
an incredible folly ? 
One thing is certain-that 
the joy of discovering in a great artist that deep 
community, without which understanding is only 
a phrase, is undivided and unmistakable. 
To it 
there is no short way, however. 
One can only hold 
one's breath and listen for the undertone, in the 
sure knowledge that it is there to be heard. 
That 
too is unmistakable. 
There comes a moment when 
one feels that every wዷrd that he is reading comes 
from within him, and not from without any more, 
when he is conscious of nothing but the throb and 
the anguish of a human soul that at once is and is 
not his own. 
Upon that moment he can only wait. 
In so far as that moment can be held in any single 
expression of an artist's life-long striving, it is con­
tained in The Dream of a Queer Fellow. 
The very 
title might serve for an account of the whole of 
Dostoevsky's life and work. 
It is an epitome of the problems which tormented 
him. 
And yet it seems so simple and straight­
forward : a dream, another world like our own, a 
beatific life in a golden and innocent age, and then 
the knowledge of good and evil and the fall. 
It is 
not so very different from the uniyersal legend of 
Paradise, of the world without pain of which man­
kind has dreamed since dreams began. 
Because it 
is so simple, it should be received with fear, in the 
spirit in which Dostoevsky himself said that he 

INTRODUCTION 
xi 
feared simple men far more than complex men. 
Great men know the cold_ terror of all ultimate 
simpȍities, whȎ_n the soul trembles with the longing 
to be done \vith dreams and torments, and to sny 
clearly and once for all, yea or_nay, and yet because 
of its trcȏbling ti1e·tȐngue cannot speak. 
There are many of these ultimate simplicities in 
this dream of Dostoevsky's. 
Into it. he, the great 
fighter for humanity, seems to have gathered them 
all ; perhaps to have tried, in the last years of his 
life before he grappled with his final achievement, 
The Brothers Karamazov, to say clearly to the world 
what it hardly understood, that he was contending 
on its behalf against a despair which, if it once took 
hold of human hearts, would leave them dead. 
The Dream of a Queer Fl'llow-I write the words 
again 
and 
they 
appear 
doubly 
pregnant 
with 
meaning. 
It is a true and terrible phrase: true, 
because we are all queer fellows dreaming ; and we 
are queer just because we dream ; terrible, because 
of the vastness of the unknown which it carries 
within itself, because it sets loose the tremendous 
and awful question : 
What if we arc only queer 
fellows dreaming ? 
What if behind the veil the 
truth is leering and jeering at our queerness and our 
dreams ? 
'Vhat if the queer fellow of the story were 
right, before he dreamed ? 
What if it were really 
all the same ? 
What if it were all the same not once but a 
million times, life after life, world after world, the 

Xll 
INTRODUCTION 
same pain, the same doubt, the same dreams ? 
The queer fellow went but one day's journey along 
the 
eternal 
recurrence which 
threatens human 
minds and human destinies. 
'Vhen he returned 
he was queer. 
There was another man went the 
same journey. 
Friedrich Nietzsche dreamed this 
very dream in the mountains of the Engadine. 
When he returned he too was queer. 
'Vhere shall a bound be set to the ravages of this 
disease of knowledge and despair? 
Without we 
are as the beasts that perish; with it we perish as 
the beasts, having thought a few queer thoughts, 
having done a few queer things, having dreamed a 
few queer dreams. 
Elsewhere 1 I have tried to show 
where Dostoevsky himself strove to set the bound; 
and that he could not set it this side humanity. 
For the m0ment let it suffice that Dostoevsky spent 
his final strength in the effort to create a new life 
and a new man. 
The Dream of a Queer Fellow came to my knmv­
ledge late, when my thought upon Dostoevsky w·as 
already formed ; 
if it had not been so I might 
honestly have been able to say that it was the key 
to his work. 
But now I do not believe it. 
Alone, 
it may be only a simple, beautiful and tragic story : 
I do not know. 
But when the memory is crowded 
with visions of all the queer fellows with whom 
Dostoevsky peopled his terrible world, when they

and all the dreams they dreamed-the dreams of 
Raskolnikov, of Rogozhin, of Svidrigailov and Ivan 
Karamazov-arc remembered as the dreams of the 
queer fellow who was Fyodor Dostoevsky: then 
I do know that it is something utterly different from 
a simple story, that it is something vast and terrible 
and true. 
Into this little volume has been also put the 
famous lecture upon Pushkin with which Dos­
toevsky's life came to an end. 
The connection 
between the two utterances is real and living, 
although it may be obscure, and although this is not 
the place to expound it. 
In brief, Dostoevsky was 
a Russian patriot for two reasons : first, 
because 
his mind was Russian, and in his years of exile he 
knew 
that he starved amid foreign men and 
manners; secondly, because he had set his hope in 
the birth of a new humanity, and this, he believed, 
could only come to pass in Russia. 
It would be 
hard to say which was the more potent of these 
impulses. 
But as a patriot he yearned to act. 
He embraced the Slavophile doctrine ardently, not 
because he believed in its material details-let 
those who believe that he did read the dialogue 
between Svidrigailov and Shatov in The Possessed­
but because it did, as it still does, boldly confess 
Russia before the world. 
This was all that he cared 
for, that Russia should not be denied, that her 
children should believe in her, if not for the sake of 
the mysterious Advent of 'vhich Dostoevsky him-

xiv 
INTRODUCTION 
self dreamed, when salvation should descend upon 
the world from Russia, at least for her own sake. 
The vials of his wrath were poured out upon 
Gradovsky and the \Vesterners, not because they 
were in another political camp, but because they 
denied Russia, and were like to cheat her of her 
mighty 
spiritual 
destiny. 
And 
the 
speech 
on 
Pushkin itself is Dostoevsky's attempt to give to 
his dream future a local habitation and a name. 
With it he finally conquered the position which 
had always been his due. 
He became the great 
writer of the Russian land. 
The occasion of his 
triumph may seem, in comparison with his novels, 
almost accidental. 
It is not so. 
The tens of 
thousands who were turned to him by the speech 
and followed him to his grave, honoured a writer 
who was great, not least, because he was a great 
Russian.

THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW' 


THE DREAl\I OF A QUEER FELLO"V 
I 
I A:<.I a queer fellow. 
They call me mad now. 
That would be a promotion, if I were not still the 
same queer fellow for them as before. 
But I 'm 
not cross with them any more ; now I love them 
all-even when they laugh at me, somehow I love 
them more than ever. 
I would laugh with them 
myself-not at myself, but for love of them-if it 
did not make me so sad to look at them ; 
sad, 
because they do not know the truth, and I do. 
How hard it is for one man who knows the truth ! 
But 
they won't understand this. 
They won't 
understand it. 
Before, I used to suffer deeply, because I seemed 
queer. 
Not seemed, but was. 
I always was queer ; 
perhaps I 've known it from the clay of my birth. 
Perhaps when I was only seven I knew that I was 
queer. 
Afterwards I went to school, then to the 
university, and-well, the more I studied tlH' more 
I discovered that I was queer. 
So that finally it 
seemed to me that all my university knowledge 
existed only to explain and prove to me, the deeper 
I plunged into it, that I was queer. 
Each day in­
creased and strengthened my consciousness that I 
looked queer in every way. 
Everybody always 
laughed at me. 
But not one of them knew or guessed 
that if there was a man on earth who really knew 
a 

4 
THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
how queer I was, that man was myself; their not 
knowing that was quite the most insulting thing 
of all, but there I was to blame. 
I was always so 
proud that nothing would induce me to confess that 
to any one. 
1\ly pride increased with years, and I 
verily believe that if it had happened that I had 
allowed myself to confess that I was queer to any 
living soul, I would have blown out my brains with 
a revolver on the spot. 
Oh, how much I suffered as 
a youth for fear I might not be able to hold out, and 
might suddenly, somehow, confess to my comrades. 
But since I became a young man, though each 
year I realised my awful nature more and more, 
for some reason I have been a little calmer. 
For some reason or other, I say, for even now I 
cannot 
define 
it. 
Perhaps 
because 
a terrible 
anguish had been born in my soul of one thing 
which was infinitely higher than the whole of me­
it was the conviction that had descended upon me 
that IT IS ALL THE SAME, everywhere on earth. 
I 
had suspected it long before, but the full conviction 
came somehow suddenly last year. 
I suddenly felt 
that IT WOULD BE ALL TilE SA:\IE to me if the world 
really existed, or if there was nothing anywhere. 
I 
began to feel with all my being that there had been 
nothing behind me. 
At first I thought that there 
really had been a great deal, but afterwards I 
guessed that even before there had been nothing, 
but it had only seemed so, somehow. 
Little by 
little I became convinceu that there never would 
be anything. 
Then I suddenly stopped being angry 
with people, and began almost not to notice them. 
Indeed, that was shown in the most trivial things. 
It would happen, for instance, that I would walk 

THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
5 
in the street and knock into people. Not because 
I was lost in thought-what had I to think about, 
I had utterly ceased to think by then ?-it was all 
the same to me. And as for solving questions ; 
oh, I didn't solve one, yet what thousands there 
were ! 
But it had become ALL THE SAl\IE TO ME, 
and all the questions disappeared. 
Just after that, I learned the truth. 
I learned 
the truth last November, the 3rd of November last, 
and I remember every instant since that day. It 
was a gloomy night, the gloomiest night you can 
conceive. I was going home at about eleven o'clock, 
and I remember I thought that it would be im­
possible to find a gloomier hour. Even physically. 
It had poured with rain all day, the coldest and 
gloomiest rain ; some of it, I remember, was posi­
tively menacing, manifestly hostile to humankind. 
Suddenly, at eleven o'clock it stopped, and a 
horrible dampness followed, damper even and 
colder than when the rain was pouring. A mist 
ascended from everything, from every stone in the 
street, and from every alley, when I looked away 
from the street into the depths. I suddenly thought 
that it would be comfortable if the gas 'vent out, 
for the heart was sadder with the gas alight, be­
cause it lit up all those mists. That day I had had 
practically no food ; from the early evening I had 
been sitting with an engineer I knew, 'vho had two 
other friends with him. 
I was silent all the while, 
and I believe I bored them. They talked of some­
thing provocative and suddenly they became quite 
excited. 
But it was really all the same to them. 
I saw that. They were excited all for nothing. 
Suddenly I broke out : ' I say, gentlemen, 
.
•
.
 but 

6 
THE DREAl\1 OF A QUEER FELLOW 
it 's all the same to you.' They were not offended, 
but they all began to laugh at me. 
That was 
because I spoke without any 1·eproach, just' be­
cause it was all the same to me. They saw it was 
all the same to me, and cheered up. 
While I was thinking about the gas in the street, 
I glanced at the sky. 
The sky was terribly black, 
but I could clearly distinguish the ragged clouds, 
and between them bottomless spaces of black. 
Suddenly I caught sight of a little star in one of 
these spaces and began to stare at it. 
For the 
little star had given me an idea : I proposed to kill 
myself that night. l had firmly decided to kill 
myself two months before, and though I was very 
poor, I bought myself an excellent revolycr and 
loaded it that very same day. Two months had 
passed since and it still lay in my drawer ; it was 
so much the same to me that at last I longed to 
find a day when it would not be all the same,­
why, I do not know. So, every night for these two 
months, as I returned home, I thought that I would 
shoot myself. 
But all the while I was waiting for 
the moment. Now the little star had given me the 
idea, and I decided that it would happen that night 
infallibly. 
Bnt why the little star should have 
given me the idea-l do not know. 
And just as I was looking at the sky, that girl 
suddenly caught me by the arm. 
The street was 
already empty ; hardly a soul was in it. 
Far away, 
a cabman was asleep on his box. The girl was about 
eight years old, and wore a little shawl. 
She had 
no coat and was wet through. 
But I particularly 
remember her wet, ragged boots ; I remember them 
even now. They caught my eye particularly. She 

THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
7 
suddenly began to pull me by the arm and to cry 
out. 
She did not weep, but cried out some words 
abruptly somehow. 
She could not utter the words 
properly because she continually shivered all over 
from the cold. 
She was terrified by something and 
cried despairingly : ' 1\Iother, Mother ! ' 
I turned 
my face towards her, but did not speak. 
I walked 
on. But she ran and pulled at me. 
In her voice 
was the sound which with very frightened people 
means despair. I know that sound. 
Though she 
had not uttered the words, I realised that her 
mother was dying somewhere, or something had 
happened to them, and she had run out to call 
some one or find something to help mother. 
But 
I did not follow her ; on the contrary, the idea 
suddenly came to me to drive her away. First, I 
told her to find a policeman. 
But she suddenly 
cla5ped her hands together and kept running at 
my side, sobbing and breathless, and would not 
leave me. Then I stamped my foot and shouted 
at her. 
She only cried out : ' Please, sir, sir . . .  ' ; 
but suddenly she left me and rushed across the 
street. 
A passer-by appeared. 
Evidently she had 
rushed from me to him. 
I climbed up to my fifth floor. 
I rent a room 
from the landlord : there arc other rooms. 
l\Iy 
room is poverty-stricken and small. 
The window 
is an attic window, semi-circular. I have a sofa 
covered in Ameዶ·ican cloth, a table with some books, 
two chairs and an easy-chair, old, incredibly old, 
but still an easy-chair. 
I sat down, lit the candle, 
and began to think. Next door in the other room, 
behind the partition, pandemonium went on. 
It 
had been going on since the day before yesterday. 

8 
THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
A retired captain lived there, and he had friends­
about half a dozen beauties-who drank vodka, 
and played faro with old cards. Last night there 
was a scuffic, and I know that a couple of them 
pulled each other about by the hair for a long 
while. 'fhe landlady wanted to complain to the 
police, but she is terribly afraid of the captain. 
The only other lodger in our rooms is a small, thin, 
military lady, who is only passing through here, 
with three little children who have already got ill 
through being in the rooms. 
She and the children 
faint with fear of the captain : all night long they 
tremble and cross themselves, and the youngest 
child has had a fit from fright. I know for a fact 
that this captain sometimes accosts passers-by on 
the Nevsky Prospekt and begs. 
He is turned out 
of every office, but strange to say-this is the reason 
why I speak of him-for the whole month he has 
not aroused my resentment. 
From the very be­
ginning, of course, I avoided his acquaintance ; 
and he was bored by me at our very first meeting. 
But however loud they shouted behind the parti­
tion and however many of them there were-it was 
all the same to me. I sit up all night long, and 
really I do not hear them, so utterly do I forget 
them. 
Every night I do not sleep till dawn. That 
has been going on for a year. 
I sit in my easy­
chair by the table all night and do nothing. 
I 
read books only in the daytime. 
I sit and do not 
even think, but even so some thoughts keep wan­
dering, and I let them wander at will. 
The whole 
candle burns away during the night. 
I sat by the table, took out the revolver, and 
put it in front of me. 
When I had put it there, I 

THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
9 
remember, I asked myself : ' Is it true ? '  and I 
answered with absolute conviction : 
' Perfectly 
true '-that is, that I was going to shoot myself. 
I knew for certain that I would shoot myself that 
night, but how long I would sit by the table-that 
I did not know. 
I should certainly have shot 
myself, but for that little girl. 
II 
You see : though it was all the same to me, I felt 
pain, for instance. 
If any one were to strike me, 
I should feel pain. 
Exactly the same in the moral 
sense : if anything very pitiful happened, I would 
feel pity, just as I did before everything in life 
became all the same to me. 
I had felt pity just 
before : 
surely, I would have helped a child 
without fail. 
Why did I not help the little girl, 
then ? 
It was because of an idea that came 
into my mind then. 
When she was pulling at 
me and calling to me, suddenly a question arose 
before me, which I could not answer. 
The question 
was an idle one ; but it made me angry. 
I was 
angry because of my conclusion, that if I had 
already made up my mind that I would put an 
end to myself to-night, then now more than ever 
before everything in the world should be all the 
same to me. Why was it that I felt it was not all 
the same to me, and pitied the little girl ? 
I 
remember I pitied her very much : 
so much 
that I felt a pain that was even strange and in­
credible in my situation. Really, I cannot give a 
more definite account of my momentary sensation ; 
but it continued even when I reached home, when 

10 
THE DREAM: OF A QUEER FELLOW 
I had sat down to my table. 
I was more irritated 
than I had been for a long time. 
One thought 
followed another. 
It seemed clear that if I was a man and not a 
cipher yet, and until I was changed into a cipher, 
then I was alive and therefore could suffer, be 
angry and feel shame for my actions. 
V cry well. 
But if I were to kill myself, for instance, in two 
hours from now, what is the girl to me, and what 
have I to do with shame or with anything on earth ? 
I am going to be a cipher, an absolute zero. Could 
my consciousness that I would soon absolutely cease 
to exist, and that therefore nothing would exist, 
have not the least influence on my feeling of pity 
for the girl or on my sense of shame for the vileness 
I had committed ? 
But that was the very reason 
why I had stamped and shouted wildly at the 
poor child, as it were to show that not only did I 
feel no pity, but even if I should commit some 
inhuman vileness, then I had the right to do so, 
because in two hours everything would be extin­
guished. Do you believe that was why I shouted ? 
Now I am almost convinced of it. 
It became 
clear to me that life and the world, as it were, 
depended upon me. 
I might even say that 
the world had existed for me alone. I should 
shoot myself, and then there would be no world 
at all, for me at least. Not to mention that 
perhaps there will really be nothing for any one 
after me, and the whole world, as soon as my con­
sciousness is extinguished, will also be extinguished 
like a phantom, as part of my consciousness only, 
and be utterly abolished, since perhaps all this 
world and all these men arc myself alone. 
I re­
member that as I sat and thought, I turned all 

THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
11 
these new, thronging questions to a completely 
different aspect, and excogitated something utterly 
new. 
For instance, one strange consideration sud­
denly presented itself to me. If I had previously 
lived on the moon or in 1\lars, and I had there been 
dishonoured and disgraced so utterly that one can 
only imagine it sometimes in a dream or a night­
mare, and if I afterwards found myself on earth 
and still preserved a consciousness of what I had 
done on the other planet, and if I knew besides 
that I would never by any chance return, then, if 
I were to look at the moon from the earth-would 
it be all the same to me or not ? 
Would I feel any 
shame for my action or not ? 
The questions were 
idle and useless, for the revolver was already lying 
before me, and I knew with all my being that this 
thing would happen for certain : but the questions 
excited me to rage. 
I could not die now, without 
having solved this first. 
In a word, that little girl 
saved me, for my questions made me postpone 
pulling the trigger. 1\Ieanwhile everything had 
begun to quiet clown at the captain's. 
They had 
finished their cards, and had begun to settle them· 
selves to sleep, grumbling and reviling each other 
at their leisure the while. Then I suddenly fell 
asleep in the easy-chair by the table, a thing which 
had never happened to me before. I fell asleep 
quite unconsciously. 
Dreams are extraordinarily strange. 
One thing 
appears with terrifying clarity, with the details 
finely set like jewels, while you leap over another, 
as though you did not notice it at all-space and 
time, for instance. It seems that dreams are the 
work not of mind but of desire, not of the head 
but of the heart ; and what complicated things 

12 
THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
my mind has sometimes contrived in a dream ! 
In 
a dream things quite incomprehensible come to 
pass. For instance, my brother died five years ago. 
Sometimes I see him in a dream : he takes part in 
my affairs, and we arc very excited, while I, all 
the time my dream goes on, know and remember 
perfectly that my brother is dead and buried. Why 
am I not surprised that he, though dead, is still 
near me and busied about me ? \Yhy docs my 
mind allow all that ? 
But enough of that. 
I will 
proceed to my dream. 
Y cs, then it was I dreamed 
that dream, my dream of the 3rd of November. 
Now they tease me because it was only a dream. 
But is it not the same whether it was a dream or 
not, if that dream revealed the Truth to me ? 
Surely if you once knew the Truth and saw her, 
then you would know that she is the Truth, and 
that there is not, neither could there be, another 
Truth, whether in sleep or wakefulness. 'Yell, let 
it be a dream ; nevertheless I wanted to extinguish 
by suicide this life that you praise so highly, while 
my dream, my dream-it announced to me a new 
life, great, renewed, and strong ! 
Listen. 
III 
I said I had fallen asleep unconsciously, as it were 
still thinking about the same things. 
Suddenly 
I dreamed that I took the revolver and pointed 
it straight at my heart as I sat-at my heart and 
not at my head. 
Before I had firmly decided to 
shoot myselfthrough the head-to be exact, through 
the right temple. Pointing it at my heart I waited 
a second or two. 
My candle, the table, and the 

THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
13 
wall in front of me suddenly began to move and 
shake. I pulled the trigger quipkly. 
In a dream you sometimes fall from a height, or 
your throat is cut, or you are beaten ; but you 
never feel pain, unless, somehow, you really hurt 
yourself in bed. 
Then you will feel pain and nearly 
always will wake because of it. 
So it was in my 
dream : I felt no pain, but it seemed to me that 
with the report, everything in me was convulsed, 
and everything suddenly extinguished. 
It was 
terribly black all about me. 
I became as though 
blind and numb, and I lay on my back on some­
thing hard. 
I could sec nothing, neither could I 
make any sound. 
People were walking and making 
a noise about me : the captain's bass voice, the 
landlady's screams. . . . Suddenly there was a 
break. I am being carried in a closed coffin. I feel 
the coffin swinging and I think about that, and sud­
denly for the first time the idea strikes me that I 
am dead, quite dead. 
I know it and do not doubt 
it ; I cannot sec nor move, yet at the same time 
I feel and think. 
llut I am soon reconciled to 
that, and as usual in a dream I accept the reality 
without a question. 
Now I am being buried in the earth. 
Every one 
leaves me and I am alone, quite alone. 
I do not 
stir. Before, when I imagined how I would really 
be buried in my grave, I always associated with it 
only the feeling of damp and cold. Now, too, I 
felt that I was very cold, particularly in the tips 
of my toes, but I felt nothing besides. 
I lay there and-strange to say-I expected 
nothing, accepting without question that a dead 
man has nothing to expect. 
But it was damp. 
I 

14 
THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
do not know how long passed-an hour, a few days, 
or many days. 
Suddenly, on my left eye which 
was closed, a drop of water fell, which had leaked 
through the top of the grave. 
In a minute fell 
another, then a third, and so on, every minute. 
Suddenly, deep indignation kindled in my heart 
and suddenly in my heart I felt physical pain. 
'It 's my wound,' I thought. 
' It 's where I shot 
myself. 
The bullet is there.' And all the while 
the water dripped straight on to my closed eye. 
Suddenly, I cried out, not with a voice, for I was 
motionless, but with all my being, to the arbiter 
of all that was being done to me. 
' 'Vhosoever thou art, if thou art, and if there 
exists a purpose more intelligent than the things 
which are now taking place, let it be present here 
also. 
But if thou dost take vengeance upon me 
for my foolish suicide, then know, by the indecency 
and absurdity of further existence, that no torture 
whatever that may befall me, can ever be com­
pared to the contempt which I will silently feel, 
even through millions of years of martyrdom.' 
I cried out and was silent. Deep silence lasted 
a whole minute. 
One more drop even fell. 
But 
I knew and believed, infinitely and steadfastly, 
that in a moment everything would infallibly 
change. Suddenly, my grave opened. 
I do not 
know whether it had been uncovered and opened, 
but I was taken by some dark being unknown to 
me, and we found ourselves in space. Suddenly, I 
saw. 
It was deep night ; never, never had such 
darkness been ! 
'Vc were borne through space and 
were already far from the earth. 
I asked nothing 
of him who led me. 
I was proud and waited. 
I 

THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
15 
assured myself that I was not afraid, and my heart 
melted with rapture at the thought that I was not 
afraid. 
I do not remember how long we rushed 
through space, and I cannot imagine it. 
It hap­
pened as always in a dream when you leap over 
space and time and the laws of life and mind, and 
you stop only there where your heart delights. 
I 
remember, I suddenly saw in the darkness one little 
star. 
' Is it Sirius ? ' I asked, suddenly losing control 
of myself, for I did not want to ask him anything. 
'No, it is the same star which thou didst see 
returning home,' replied the being who bore me 
away. 
I knew that he had, as it were, a human 
face. 
It is strange, but I did not love that being ; 
I felt even a deep repugnance towards him. I had 
expected utter annihilation, and with that idea I 
had shot myself in the heart. 
And now I was in 
the power of a being, who was, of course, not 
human, but who was, and did exist. 
' So there is 
life after the grave,' I thought, with the strange 
light-heartedness of a dream. 
But the essence of 
my heart in all its depth remained to me. 
' And 
if it is necessary TO BE once more,' I thought, ' and 
to live again by some one's inexorable will, then I 
will not be conquered and degraded ! ' 
' Thou knowest that I do not fear thee : therefore 
thou dost despise me ? ' I suddenly said to my com­
panion, unable to restrain myself from a humiliat­
ing question in which was contained a confession, 
and I felt my humiliation like the stab of a needle 
in my heart. He did not answer my question, but 
suddenly I felt that I was not despised, neither 
laughed at, nor even pitied, but that our journey 

16 
THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
had an unknown and mysterious purpose which 
concerned myself alone. Fear grew in my heart. 
Some dumb yet painful influence reached me from 
my silent companion and penetrated me. ·we were 
rushing through dark and unknown spaces. I had 
long since ceased to see any constellation familiar 
to my eyes. I knew there were stars in the 
heavenly spaces, whose rays reach the earth only 
after thousands and millions of years. 
Perhaps we 
had already passed beyond those spaces. 
With 
terrible anguish that wore out my heart, I was ex­
pecting something. Suddenly a familiar yet most 
overwhelming emotion shook me through. 
I saw 
our sun. 
I knew that it could not be our sun, 
which had begotten our earth, and that we were 
an infinite distance away, but somehow all through 
me I recognised that it was exactly the same sun 
as ours, its copy and double. 
A sweet and moving 
delight echoed rapturously through my soul. 
The 
dear power of light, of that same light which had 
given me birth, touched my heart and revived it, 
and I felt life, the old life, for the first time since 
my death. 
' But if it is the sun, the same sun as ours,' I 
exclaimed, ' then where is the earth ? ' 
And my 
companion pointed to the little star which twinkled 
in the darkness with an emerald radiance. 
'Ve 
were borne straight towards it. 
' And can there be such repetitions in the uni­
verse ? 
Is that the law of nature. . . . And if it 
is the earth there, is it just the same earth as ours 
. . .  the very same, poor, unhappy, dear, ever­
beloved earth, that rouses the same painful love 
for her in her most ungrateful children, just as 

THE DREAl\1 OF A QUEER FELLOW 
17 
our own ? ' . . . I cried, trembling with irresistible, 
rapturous love for my own earth of old that I had 
left. The image of the little girl I had wronged 
rose before me. 
' You will see everything,' replied my companion, 
and I could hear a note of sadness in his words. 
\V c 
were fast approaching the planet. It grew before 
my eyes. 
I could already discern the ocean, the 
outlines of Europe. 
Suddenly a strange feeling of 
great and sacred jealousy was kindled in my heart. 
' How can such a repetition be, and why ? 
It 's 
only the earth that I love or can love, the earth 
which I left, which was sprinkled with my blood, 
when I, the ungrateful, put an end to my life with 
a pistol-shot. 
But never once, never once, did I 
cease to love the earth, and even on that _jght 
when I parted from her, I loved her perhaps more 
poignantly than ever. 
Is there pain on this new 
earth ? 
On earth we can love truly only with 
pain and only through pain ! 
We cannot love 
otherwise, and. we know no other love. 
I need 
pain in order to love. 
At this very moment, I 
want, I long, to melt into tears and kiss only that 
earth which I have left. 
I do not want, I will not 
accept, life on any other earth.' 
But my companion had already left me. 
Sud­
denly, as it were quite unperceived by myself, I 
stood on that other earth in the bright light of a 
sunny day, beautiful as Paradise. 
I believe I stood 
on one of those islands which on our earth are the 
Greek Archipelago, or somewhere on the mainland 
coast near to that Archipelago. 
Oh, everything 
was exactly as on earth, but everything seemed to 
be bright with holiday, with a great and sacred 

18 
THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
triumph, finally achieved. 
The smiling emerald 
sea gently lapped the shores, kissing them with 
love, with manifest, visible, almost conscious love. 
Tall, splendid trees stood in all the glory of their 
bloom, and I am convinced that their innumerable 
leaves greeted me with a sweet, caressing sound, 
as though they uttered words of love. 
The grass 
was aflame with brilliant and sweet-scented colours. 
Flights of birds wheeled in the air, and fearlessly 
settled on my shoulders and my hands, joyfully 
tapping me with their dear, tremulous little wings. 
At last I saw and recognised the people of that 
happy land. 
They came to me themselves, 
thronged me about, and kissed me. 
Children of 
the sun, children of the sun-oh, how beautiful 
they were ! 
Never on earth have I seen such 
beauty in man. 
In our children alone, in their 
very earliest years, one could perhaps find a re­
mote and faint reflection of that beauty. The eyes 
of those happy people shone with a bright radiance. 
Their faces gleamed with wisdom, and with a cer­
tain consciousness, consummated in tranquillity ; 
but their faces were happy. 
In their words and 
voices sounded a childlike joy. 
Oh, instantly, at 
the first glimpse of their faces I understood eyery­
thing, everything ! 
It was the earth as yet un­
polluted by transgression ; on it lived men who 
had yet known no sin. They lived in the same 
paradise in which, according to the universal tradi­
tion of mankind, our fallen ancestors once lived, 
save that here all the earth was everywhere one 
single paradise. Laughing joyfully they thronged 
me and caressed me ; they led me to their homes, 
and each one of them wished to make me happy. 

THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
Hl 
Oh, they asked me no questions ; it seemed that 
they already knew all, and they wished to remove 
all trace of suffering from my face as quickly as 
they might. 
IV 
Again, grant that it was only a dream. 
But the 
sensation of the love of those beautiful and innocent 
people has remained with me for ever, and even 
now I feel that their love breathes upon me from 
yonder. 
I saw them with my own eyes, I came to 
know them, and to know that I loved them ; after­
wards I suffered for them. 
Oh, I knew immedi­
ately even then that in many things I would not 
understand them at all. To me, a modern Russian 
radical, and an abominable Petersburgcr, it seemed 
for instance unintelligible that, knowing so much, 
they yet did not possess our science. 
But I soon 
perceived that their knowledge was achieved and 
nourished by other intuitions than those we have 
on earth, and that their aspirations wet·e quite 
other. 
They desired nothing, but were calm ; they 
did not aspire to a knowledge of life, as we aspire 
to knowledge, because their life was fulfilled. 
But 
their knowledge was deeper and higher than our 
science, for our science seeks to explain what is 
life, she aspires to know life, that she may teach 
others how to live ; but they, without science, 
knew how to live. That also I understood, but I 
could not understand their knowledge. 
They 
showed me their trees, but I could not understand 
the depth of love with which they looked at them ; 
exactly as though they spoke with their fellows. 
And perhaps I should not be wrong if I said they 

20 
THE DREAM: OF A QUEER FELLOW 
did speak with them. 
Yes, they had found their 
language and I am convinced that the trees under­
stood them. 
In the same way did they regard all 
nature-the animals which lived at peace with 
them, did not attack them, but loved them, subdued 
by their love. 
They pointed out the stars to me 
and told me something about them that I could 
not understand, but I am convinced that in some 
way they were in contact with the stars of heaven, 
having connection with them not by thought alone 
but in some physical way. 
Oh, they did not try 
to make me understand them ; they loved me 
without that. 
But I knew they would never under­
stand me, and therefore I hardly spoke to them of 
our earth. 
I only kissed the earth on which they 
lived, in their presence, and without words I adored 
them, and they saw it and let themselves be adored, 
and felt no shame that I adored them, because 
they loved much. 
They did not suffer for me 
when I in tears kissed their feet, joyfully knowing 
in my heart with how great power of love they 
would requite me. Sometimes I asked myself in 
amazement, how could it be that they should not 
have offended such an one as myself all this while, 
and never have aroused in me either jealousy or 
envy ? 
l\Iany times I asked myself, how could it 
be that I, a braggart and a liar, had not told them 
of my learning, of "·hich, of course, they had no 
notion-how could it be that I had not wished to 
surprise them with it, even though only for the 
love I bore them ? 
They were playful and happy 
as children. They wandered through their beau­
tiful groves and forests, sang their lovely songs, fed 
on ambrosial food, the fruits of their trees, the 

THE DREAl\1 OF A QUEER FELLOW 
21 
honey of their forests, and the milk of the beasts 
that loved them. 
For their food and raiment they 
laboured but little and with case. 
Love was 
amongst them and children were born, but never 
did I see amongst them the transports of that cruel 
sensuality which OYertakcs almost all men on our 
earth, and is the one source of nearly all their sins. 
They rejoiced in the children born to them as in 
new partners of their bliss. There were no quarrels 
among them, neither any jealousy : they did not 
even understand what it meant. Their children 
were the children of all, because they were all one 
family. 
There was hardly any disease among them, 
though there was death ; but their old folk died 
quietly, as though they fell asleep, surrounded by 
friends who took leave of them, whom they blessed 
and smiled upon, themselves well sped by their 
friends' bright smiles. At this parting I never saw 
sorrow, neither tears : there was only love, as it 
were multiplied to ecstasy, but to an ecstasy quiet, 
consummated, and full of contemplation. 
One 
could have believed that they still had communion 
with their dead even after death, and that their 
earthly union was not severed by the grave. 
They 
hardly understood me when I asked them concern­
ing eternal life, but they were evidently so con­
vinced of it that it was no question to them. 
They 
had no temples, but they had a real, living, and 
continual communion with the whole universe ; 
they had no religion, but they had the firm know­
ledge that when their earthly joy had been con­
summated to the limit of their earthly nature, then 
would begin for them, living as '"ell as dead, a 
yet greater expansion of their contact with the 

22 
THE DREAl\1 OF A QUEER FELLOW 
- 
whole universe. They awaited this moment with 
joy, but without impatience, with no anguished 
longing for it, but already as it were partaking of 
it in the presentiments of their hearts which they 
communicated each to the other. 
In the evenings, 
before they went to rest, they loved to sing sweetly 
and harmoniously in chorus. In these songs they 
expressed all the feelings which the dying day had 
given them ; they glorified it and bade it farewell. 
They glorified nature, the earth, the sea, the 
forests. They loved to make songs to each other, 
which rose from the heart and touched the heart. 
And not in songs alone, for it seemed that all 
their life was spent in mutual admiration. They 
were enamoured one of the other, completely, 
universally. 
Others of their solemn and exalted 
songs I could hardly understand at all. 
I under­
stood the words, but I could never penetrate their 
deep meaning, which remained as it were inac­
cessible to my mind, but, unaccountably, my heart 
felt it only the more. 
I often told them that long 
ago I had had a presentiment of all this, that all 
their joy and praise had appeared to me while still 
upon our earth, with an anguish of yearning which 
sometimes reached intolerable pain ; that I had 
anticipated them and their grace in the dreams of 
my heart and the visions of my mind ; that often, 
on earth, I could not look toward the setting sun 
without tears . . .  that in my hatred of the people 
on the earth was always anguish-why could I not 
hate them without loving them ? 
Why could I not 
but forgive them ; and in my love for them was 
also anguish : why could I not love them without 
hating them ? They listened to me, and I saw 

THE DREAI\1 OF A QUEER FELLOW 
23 
that they could not understand what I said, but I 
did not regret that I had spoken to them of it : 
for I knew that they understood all the force of 
my anguish for those whom I had left. 
Yes, when 
they looked at me with their dear, love-suffused 
eyes, when I felt that in their presence my heart 
too had become as innocent and truthful as their 
own, then I did not regret that I did not under­
stand them. 
l\Iy feeling of the completeness of 
their life deprived me of speech, and I revered 
them in silence. 
Oh, every one now laughs in my face, and tells 
me that it is impossible even in a dream to sec such 
details as I am telling now. They tell me that in 
my dream I saw or felt but one thing, begotten 
of my own heart in delirium, but that I n:J,yself 
created the particulars when I was awake. 
And 
when I said that perhaps it was so-my God, how 
they burst out laughing in my face, and what 
pleasure I gave them ! 
Oh yes, of course, I was 
overcome by the sensation cf that dream alone, 
and that alone remained whole in my bleeding 
heart : yet the real images and forms of my dream, 
which I indeed saw at the very moment of my 
dream, were perfected to such a harmony, were so 
enchanting and beautiful, and so true, that when 
I awoke I certainly could not clothe them in our 
weak words. Therefore they must needs have 
blurred in my mind, and perhaps I myself uncon­
sciously was obliged to compose the details after­
wards, of course distorting them, above all by 
reason of my passionate desire to tell it instantly 
even though only in part. But, for all that, how 
could I not believe that all these things had really 

24 
THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
been ? 
It was perhaps a thousand times better, 
brighter, and more joyful than I have told. 
Let it 
be a dream, but yet all this could not but have 
really been. 
I will tell you a secret : perhaps all 
this was not a dream at all ! 
For something hap­
pened, a thing to such a degree of horror true that 
it could not have belonged to a sleeping dream. 
Let my heart have begotten my dream, but could 
my heart alone have begotten the horrid truth, 
which happened afterwards ? 
How could I alone 
have invented it or dreamed it within my heart ? 
Could my paltry heart and my capricious, petty 
mind have risen to such a revelation of truth ? 
Oh, 
judge for yourselves : hitherto I have concealed it, 
but now I will tell openly this truth also. 
v 
... ,.,.,.t, led them all ! 
•
•
 
l.,-._, 
v 
Yes, yes, it ended with that. 
I corrupted them 
all ! 
How could it have been achieved-! do not 
know, yet I remember clearly. 
The dream passed 
aeons away, and left in me only the sensation of 
the whole. I only know that the cause of the fall 
was I. 
Like a filthy germ, like an atom of pesti­
lence, infecting whole peoples, so did I infect with 
my soul that happy land, that knew not sin before 
me. 
They learned to lie, and loved lying, and 
knew the beauty of lies. Oh, this perhaps began 
innocently, from a jest, from playfulness, in a 
loving game, perhaps indeed from an atom, but 
the atom of lie entered their hearts and they loved 
it. Soon was begotten voluptuousness, of volup­
tuousness-jealousy, of jealousy-cruelty . . . .  Oh, 

THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
25 
I do not know, I do not remember, but soon, very 
soon, the first blood was spilled. They were sur­
prised and horrified and began to be disunited and 
to disperse. 
Unions appeared, but they were 
unions one against the other. 
Reproach and re­
crimination began. 
They came to know shame, 
and made of shame a virtue. 
The idea of honour 
was born and each union had its flag. 
They began 
to usc the beasts ill, and the beasts withdrew into 
the woods and became their enemies. A war of 
disunion began, in which they fought for separa­
tion, for personality, for mine and thine. 
They 
began to speak different tongues. They came to 
know and to love sadness ; they longed for suffer­
ing and said that truth could be achieved by suffer­
ing alone. 
Then science appeared among them. 
When they were angered, they began to talk of 
brotherhood and humanity, and conceived those 
ideas. When they committed crime, they invented 
justice and prescribed for themselves whole codes 
of laws to maintain it, and to maintain the codes 
they set up a guillotine. Hardly, hardly did they 
remember what they had lost ; they did not even 
want to believe that they had once been innocent 
and happy. They laughed even at the possibility 
of that old happiness and called it a dream. 
They 
could not even present it to themselves in forms 
and. images, but it is strange and wonderful, that 
when they had lost all belief in their former happi­
ness, calling it a legend, they conceived so great a 
desire to be innocent and happy again once more 
that they fell before the desire of their hearts like 
children, and worshipped this desire ; they built 
many temples to it and began to pray to their 

26 
THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
ideal, to their own desire ; though they fully be­
lieved it was impracticable and impossible, still 
they worshipped and adored it with tears. 
And 
yet if it could only have happened that they might 
return to the innocent and happy state which they 
had lost, and if some one had suddenly showed it 
to them and asked them if they wished to return 
to it, they would surely have refused. 
They would 
answer me : ' Grant that we are liars, evil, and 
unjust, we know that and weep for it, we torture 
and torment ourselves, and punish ourselves more 
hardly perhaps than even that merciful Judge, who 
will judge us and whose name we do not know. 
llut we have science, aዴd by her aid we will find 
the truth again, and this time we will accept her 
consciously. 
Knowledge is higher than feeling ; 
the consciousness of life is higher than life. 
Science 
will give us wisdom ; wisdom will reveal to us 
laws, and the knowledge of the laws of happiness 
is higher than happiness.' That is what they said, 
and after such words, each one loved himself above 
all others, neither could they do otherwise. Each 
one had become so jealous of his own individuality 
that he sought with all his might only to degrade 
and belittle it in others ; therein he saw his life. 
Slavery appeared, even voluntary slavery ; 
the 
weak readily submitted to the strong, with one aim 
alone, that the strong should help them to crush 
those yet weaker than themselves. 
Godly men 
appeared who came to these people wiʶh tears and 
spoke to them of their pride, of their lack of 
measure and harmony, of their loss of shame. 
They were laughed at and stoned with stones. 
Sacred blood flowed on the thref:holds of the 

THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
27 
temples. Yet there began to appear men who 
pondered how they might be united in such a way 
that each, without ceasing to love himself most of 
all, might yet not stand in the way of others ; 
they might live all together as it were in a united 
society. 
Whole wars were fought for this idea. 
All those who fought believed firmly that science 
and wisdom and the instinct of self-preservation 
would at last unite men into a harmonious and 
reasonable society ; in the meanwhile, to help the 
work along, ' the wise ' tried to exterminate with 
all speed ' the foolish ' and those who did not 
understand their idea in order that they should 
not prevent its triumph. But the instinct of self­
preservation quickly began to weaken. 
Proud and 
voluptuous men appeared who straightway de­
manded everything or nothing. 
To acquire all 
things they had recourse to murder, and if they 
failed, to suicide. Religions appeared devoted to 
the cult of not-being and of self-destruction for the 
sake of eternal rest in nothingness. 
Finally these 
men became tired of their foolish labour, and on 
their faces showed suffering ; and they proclaimed 
that suffering was beauty, since thought was in 
suffering alone. They praised suffering in their 
songs. 
I walked among them wringing my hands 
and wept over them ; yet I loved them perhaps 
still more than when there was no suffering in their 
faces, and they were innocent and beautiful. 
I 
loved the earth which they had polluted more than 
when it was a paradise, for this alone that sorrow 
had appeared upon it. 
Alas, I have always loved 
sorrow and sadness, but for myself, myself alone, 
and I wept for them, pitying them. I stretched 

28 
THE DREAl\1 OF A QUEER FELLOW 
out my hands to them, accusing, cursing, and 
despising myself in my despair. 
I told them that 
this was all my work, mine alone ; that it was I 
who had brought corruption, infection, and the lie 
among them ! 
I implored them to crucify me on 
the cross, I taught them how to make a cross. 
I 
could not kill myself, I had not the power, but I 
wanted to submit to tortures from them, I yearned 
for torments, I longed that in those torments my 
last drop of blood should be spilled. 
But they 
only laughed at me, and at last began to think me 
mad. 
They defended me ; they said they had 
only received that which themselves desired, and 
that everything that was, could not hut have been. 
At last they declared to me that I was becoming 
dangerous to them, and that they would put me in 
a mad-house if I did not hold my peace. 
Their 
sorrow so mightily entered my soul that my heart 
shrank and I felt that I would die . . . .  Then I 
awoke. 
It was already morning ; that is to say, day had 
not yet dawned, but it was six o'clock. 
I awoke 
in the same easy-chair, my candle was burnt out. 
They were asleep at the captain's, and all about 
was a stillness such as was seldom in our house. 
First, I jumped up in surprised astonishment. 
Nothing like it had ever happened to me before, 
it was strange even to the smallest details. 
For 
instance, I had never fallen asleep in my easy-chair. 
Then suddenly, while I stood regaining my senses, 
my loaded revolver suddenly appeared before me. 
But instantly I put it away from me. 
Oh, now­
life, life ! 
I lifted my hands and called upon the 

THE DREAl\1 OF A QUEER FELLOW 
20 
eternal truth, not called, but wept. Rapture, m­
effable rapture exalted all my being. 
Yes, to live 
and-to preach ! 
Oh, that very minute I decided 
to preach, yes, to preach all my life long. 
I would 
preach, I longed to preach-what ? 
Truth, for I 
had seen her, seen her with my eyes, seen her in 
all her glory. 
Since then I have preached. l\Iorc than that, I 
love all men, above all those who laugh at me. 
'Vhy is it so ? 
I do not know, I cannot explain, 
but so let it be. 
They say already that I 'm wan­
dering : if he wanders now what will the end be ! 
It 's true. I wander, and perhaps it will be worse 
in the future . 
And of course I shall wander many 
times before I find out how to preach, with what 
words and deeds, for these arc hard to find. 
Even 
now I sec all this as clear as day ; but listen. 'Vho 
does not go astray ? 
Y ct all arc tending to one 
and the same goal, at least all aspire to the same 
goal, from the wise man to the lowest murderer, 
but only by different ways. 
It is an old truth, 
but there is this new in it : I cannot go far astray. 
I saw the truth. 
I saw and know that men could 
be beautiful and happy, without losing the capacity 
to live upon the earth. 
I will not, I cannot believe 
that evil is the normal condition of men. 
Yet all 
of them only laugh at my belief. 
But how could 
I not believe ? 
I saw the truth, I did not invent 
it with my mind. 
I saw, saw, and her living 
image filled my soul for ever. 
I saw her in such 
consummate perfection that I cannot possibly be­
lieve that she was not among men. 
How can I 
then go astray ? 
I shall wander, of course, more 
than once even, and I will perhaps even speak 

30 
THE DREAM OF A QUEER FELLOW 
with another's words, but not for long. The living 
image of what I saw will be with me always, and 
will correct and guide me always. 
Oh, I am strong 
and fresh, I can go on, go on, even for a thousand 
years. 
You know at first I even wanted to conceal 
that I had corrupted them all, but it was a mistake­
the first mistake, you sec ! 
But truth whispered to 
me that I was lying ; she guarded and guided me. 
But how to make a paradise I do not know, because 
I cannot express it in words. 
After my dream I 
lost all my words, at least, all the important words, 
those I need most. 
But so let it be ; I will go on 
and preach untiringly, because I saw plainly, 
although I cannot relate what I saw. 
But the 
mockers do not understand : ' He saw a dream, a 
delirious vision, a hallucination.' Ah, but is this 
really wise ? 
A dream ? 
What is a dream ? 
Is 
not our life a dream ? 
I 'II say more ! 
Let it be 
that this will never come to pass and there will be 
no paradise-that at least I understand-well, still 
I will preach. 
And it is so simple : in one day, in 
one hour, everything would be settled at once. 
The 
one thing i'l-love thy neighbour as thyself-that 
is the one thing. 
That is all, nothing else is needed. 
You will instantly find how to live. Though it is 
an old truth, repeated and read ten million times, 
yet it is discovered. 
' The knowledge of life is 
higher than life, the knowledge of the laws of 
happiness-is higher than happiness '-that is what 
must be fought. 
And I will fight. 
If only every 
one wanted it, then everything would be right in 
an instant. 
And the little girl I found . . . .  I 'll go to her, 
I '11 go.

CHAPTER I 
A WORD OF EXPLANATIO" CO#CERNING THE SPEECH 
ON PUSHKIN PUBLISIIED BELOW 
MY speech upon l)ushkin and his significance, 
printed below, which forms the chief matter of this 
number of The Journal of an Author (the only 
number published in 1880), was delivered on the 
8th of June of this year in the presence of a numer­
ous audience at the grand meeting of the Society 
of Lovers of Russian Literature, and made a con­
siderable impression. Ivan Scrgueycvich Aksakov, 
who there said of himself that all people considered 
him the leader of the Slavophiles, declared from 
the chair that my speech was ' an event.' 
I do not 
refer to this now to boast, but to say just this : if 
my speech is an event, then it is an event from one 
and only one point of vie·w, which I will proceed to 
expound. 
That is the reason of this foreword. 
In 
my speech I endeavoured to emphasise only these 
four aspects of the value of Pushkin to Russia. 
l. Pushkin with his profound insight, his genius, 
and his purely Russian heart, '\vas the first to 
detect and exhibit the chief symptom of the sick­
ness of our intellectual society, uprooted from the 
soil and raised above the people. 
He exhibited 
and set in relief before us our negative type, the 
c 

84 
PUSHKIN 
disturbed and unsatisfied man, who can believe 
neither in his own country nor in its powers, who 
finally denies Russia and himself (that is, his own 
society, his own intellectual stratum, raised from 
our native soil), who does not want to work with 
others, and who suffers sincerely. 
Aleko and 
Onyegin were the fathers of a host of their similars 
in our literature. 
After them came the Pechorins, 
Tchichikovs, Rudins, and Lavrezkys, Bolkonskys 
(in Tolstoi's War and Peace) and many others who 
by the mere fact of their appearance bore witness 
to the truth of the idea originally enunciated by 
Pushkin. 
All honour and glory to him, to his 
mighty mind and genius, \Yho discovered the most 
sore disease of the society which had grown up 
amongst us after Peter's great reform. 
To his 
skilful diagnosis we owe our knowledge and realisa­
tion of our disease, and it was he who first gave us 
consolation, for he gave us also the great hope that 
the disease is not mortal, but that Russian society 
could be cured, regenerated, and revived if it were 
bathed in the truth of the people, because 
2. He was the first-the first indeed : none was 
before him-to give us artistic types of Russian 
moral beauty, which had sprung directly out of the 
Russian soul, which had its home in the truth of 
the people, in our very soil-these types did Push kin 
trace out. 
To which bear witness Tatiana, a per­
fectly Russian woman, who guarded herself from 
the monstrous lie ; historical types, for instance 
the 1\Ionk and others in Boris Godunov ; realistic 
types, as in The Captain's Daughter, and many 
other figures which appear in his poems, his stories, 
his memories, and even in his account of the riot 

PUSHKIN 
35 
at Pougachov. 
But what must be chiefly empha­
sised is that all these types of the positive beauty 
of the Russian and the Russian soul are wholly 
drawn from the spirit of the people. Now the 
whole truth must be said : not in our present 
civilisation, not in the so-called European culture 
(which, by the way, never existed with us), not in 
the monstrosities of European ideas and forms only 
outwardly assimilated, did Pushkin discover this 
beauty, but he found it in the spirit of the people 
alone. Thus, I repeat, having revealed the disease, 
he gave us also a great hope. 
' Believe-in the 
spirit of the people, expect salvation from it alone, 
and you will be saved.' It is impossible not to 
come to this conclusion, when one has really gone 
deep into Pushkin. 
3. The third aspect of Pushkin's significance 
which I wished to emphasise, is that most peculiar 
and characteristic trait of his artistic genius, one 
never met before-his capacity for universal sym­
pathy, and for the most complete reincarnation in 
the genius of other nations, a reincarnation almost 
perfect. I said in my ' Speech ' that there had 
been mighty world-geniuses in Europe : a Shake­
speare, a Cervantes, a Schiller, but in none of them 
1o we find this capacity-save in Pushkin alone. 
Not the sympathy only is here in point, but the 
astonishing completeness of the reincarnation. This 
capacity of course I could not help emphasising as 
the most characteristic peculiarity of his genius, 
which belongs to him alone of all the artists of the 
world, by which he differs from them all. I dict 
not say it to belittle European geniuses so great as 
Shakespeare and Schiller : only a fool could draw 

86 
PUSHKIN 
a conclusion so foolish from my words. 
The uni­
versal comprehensibility and unfathomable depth 
of the types of Aryan man created by Shakespeare 
meet with no scepticism in me. 
And had Shake­
speare created Othello really a Venetian 1\loor, and 
not an Englishman, he would only have added a 
halo of local, national peculiarity to his creation. 
But the universal significance of the type would 
have been the same, for in an Italian too he would 
have expressed what he wanted to say 'vith the 
same power. 
I repeat, I did not want to diminish 
from the universal significance of a Shakespeare 
and a Schiller when I pointed out Pushkin's won­
derful faculty for reincarnating himself in the 
genius of foreign nations : I only wanted to point 
out the great and prophetical indication for us in 
this faculty and its perfection, because 
4. This faculty is a completely Russian faculty, 
a national faculty. 
Pushkin only shares it with 
the whole Russian people ; but as a perfect artist, 
he most perfectly expresses this faculty, in his 
sphere at least, in the sphere of his art. 
Our 
people docs truly contain within its soul this 
tendency to universal sympathy and reconcilia­
tion ; it has already given voice to it more than 
once in the two centuries since Peter's reforms. 
As I pointed out this capacity of our people I could 
not help showing that in this very fact is the great 
consolation of our future, our great, perhaps our 
greatest, hope, shining for us ahead. 
Above all, 
I showed that our aspiration after Europe, in spite 
of all its infatuations and extremes, was not only 
right and necessary in its basis, but also popular ; 
it fully coincided with the aspirations of the national 

PUSHKIN 
spirit itself, and was without doubt ultimately a 
higher purpose also. 
In my very short speech I 
naturally could not develop my idea fully, but 
what I said at least seems to me clear. And people 
should not be indignant with me for saying : 
' Perhaps our poor country will at the end say the 
new word to the world.' 
It is ridiculous to assert 
that "·e must complete our economic, scientific, and 
social development, before we can dream of saying 
' new words ' to such perfect organisms as the 
states of Europe. 
Indeed, I emphasise it in my 
' Speech,' that I make no attempt to compare 
Russia with the western nations in the matter of 
economic or scientific renown. 
I say only that the 
Russian soul, the genius of the Russian people, is 
perhaps among all nations the most capable of 
upholding the ideal of a universal union of man­
kind, of brotherly love, of the calm conception 
which forgives contrasts, allows for and excuses the 
unlike, and softens all contradictions. 
This is not 
an economical, but a moral trait ; and can any one 
deny that it is present in the Russian people ? 
Can any one say that the Russian nation is only 
an inert mass, doomed to serve, only economically, 
the prosperity and development of the European 
intelligentsia which has lifted itself above the 
people ; that the mass of the people in itself con­
tains only a dead inertia, from which nothing can 
be expected, nor any hope:. be formed ? 
Alas, 
many people assert this, but I dared to proclaim 
something different. 
I repeat, I naturally could 
not prove ' this fancy of mine,' as I myself called 
it, circumstantially and fully ; neither could I help 
pointing it out. 
To assert that our poor untidy 

38 
PUSHKIN 
conntry cannot harbour such lofty aspirations until 
it has become economically and socially the equal 
of the West, is simply absurd. 
In their funda­
mental substance at least the moral treasures of 
the spirit do not depend upon economical power. 
Our poor untidy land, save for its upper classes, 
is as one single man. 
The eighty millions of her 
population represent a spiritual union whose like 
cannot be found anywhere in Europe, and because 
of this alone, it is impossible to say that the land 
is untidy, it is strictly impossible to say even 
that it is poor. 
On the other hand, in Europe­
this Europe where so many treasures have been 
amassed-the whole social foundation of every 
European nation is undermined, and perhaps will 
crumble away to-morrow, leaving no trace behind, 
and in its place will arise something radically new 
and utterly unlike thnt which was before. And 
all the treasures which Europe has amassed will 
not save her from her fall, for ' in the twinkling of 
an eye all riches too will be destroyed.' 
To this 
social order, infected and rotten indeed, our people 
is being pointed as to an ideal to which they must 
aspire, and only when they have reached it, should 
they dare to whisper their "·ord to Europe. 
But 
we assert that it is possible to contain and cherish 
the power of a loving spirit of universal union even 
in our present economic poverty, and in poverty 
still greater than this. 
It can be preserved and 
cherished even in such poverty as there was after 
the Tartar invasion, or after the disasters of the 
' Troublous Age ' when Russia was saved solely by 
her national spirit of unity. Finally, if it is indeed 
required, in order to love mankind and preserve 

PUSHKIN 
39 
within ourselves a soul for universal unity ; in 
order to have within ourselves the capacity not to 
hate foreign nations because they are not like us ; 
in order to have the desire not to let our national 
feeling grow so strong that we should aim at 
getting everything and the other nations be only 
so many lemons to be squeezed-there are nations 
of this spirit in Europe !-if to obtain all this, it is 
necessary, I repeat, that we should first become a 
rich nation and adapt the European social order 
to ourselves, then must we still slavishly imitate 
that European order which may crumble to pieces 
in Europe to-morrow ? 
Will the Russian organism 
even now not be suffered to develop nationally by 
its own organic strength, but must it necessarily 
lose its individuality in a servile imitation of 
Europe ? 
What is then to be done with the 
Russian organism ? 
Do these gentlemen under­
stand what an organism is ? 
And they still talk 
of natural sciences. 
' The people will not suffer 
that,' said a friend of mine on an occasion two 
years ago to a vehement Westernist. 
' Then the 
people should be destroyed ! ' was the quiet and 
majestic answer. 
And he was not a person of no 
importance, but one of the leaders of our intellec­
tuals. 
The story is true. 
In these four aspects I sho\\·ed Pushkin's signifi­
cance for us, and my ' Speech ' made an impression. 
It did not make an impression by its merits-! 
emphasise this-nor by any talent in its exposition 
(wherein I agree \Yith all my opponents, and do 
not boast), but by its sincerity, and I will even say 
by some irresistible power in the facts displayed, 
notwithstanding its brevity and incompleteness. 

·10 
PUSHKIN 
But wherein lay ' the event,' as I van Sergueyevich 
Akc:akov put it ? 
In that the Slavophiles, or the 
Russian party so-called-we have a Russian party ! 
-made an immense, and perhaps final step to­
wards reconciliation with the \Vesternists, for the 
Slavophiles fully recognised the validity of the 
\Vesternist aspiration after Europe, the validity 
even of their most extreme enthusiasms and con­
elusions, and explained this validity by our purely 
Russian and national aspiration, which coincides 
with the national spirit itself. They explained the 
enthusiasms by historical necessity, by historical 
destiny, so that in the whole sum-total (if that 
sum-total is ever reckoned) it "·ill appear that the 
Westernists have served the Russian land and 
spirit as much as all those purely Russian men who 
have sincerely loved their native land and hitherto 
perhaps too jealously guarded her from all the in­
fatuations of ' Russian foreigners.' 
It was finally 
declared that all the friction between the two 
parties and all their unpleasant quarrels had been 
due to a misunderstanding. 
This perhaps might 
have been an event, for the representatives of the 
Slavophiles present fully agreed with the conclusions 
of my speech when it was ended. And I declare 
now-as I declared in my ' Speech ' also-that the 
honour of this new step (for even a sincere desire 
for reeoneiliation is nn honour), that the merit of 
this new word, if you will, belongs not to me alone, 
but to the whole Slavophile movement, to the 
whole spirit and tcncleney of our ' party,' that this 
was always clear to those who impartially examined 
the movement, and that the idea which I expressed 
had more than once been, if not expressed, at least 

PUSHKIN 
indicated by the Slavophiles. 
l\Iy part was only 
to seiz;e the opportune moment. 
Now this is the 
conclusion : if the Western is to accept our reason­
ing and agree with it, then of course all the mis­
understandings between both parties will be re­
moved, and the 'Vcstcrnists and the Slavophiles 
will have nothing to quarrel about, since, as Ivan 
Sergucyevich put it, ' from this day forward every­
thing has been cleared up.' 
Naturally, from this 
point of view my ' Speech ' "·ould have been an 
event. 
But, alas ! the word ' event ' was uttered 
in a moment of sincere enthusiasm by one side, but 
whether it will be accepted by the other side and 
not remain merely an ideal-that is another ques­
tion. Together with the Slavophiles who embraced 
me and shook me by the hand on the platform as 
soon as I had finished my speech, there came up 
to me 'Vesternists also, the leading representatives 
of the movement who occupy the principal r6lcs 
in it, above all at the present time. 
They pressed 
my hand with the same sincere and fervent en­
thusiasm as the Slavophiles, spoke of my speech 
as the work of genius, and repeated the word over 
and over again. But I am afraid, genuinely afraid, 
that this word was pronounced in the first rush of 
enthusiasm. 
Oh, I am not afraid that they will 
recant their opinion that my speech was the work 
of genius. 
I myself know that it was not, I was 
not at all deceived by the praise, so that from my 
whole heart I shall forgive them their disappoint­
ment in my genius. 
But it may happen that the 
'Vcsternists, upon reflection, will say-mark "·ell 
that I am not writing of those who pressed my 
hand, but of the \Vesternists in general-' Ah,' 

42 
PUSHKIN 
they will perhaps 'iay (you hear ; no more ' per­
haps ')-' Ah, you 've agreed at last, after so much 
dispute and discussion, that our aspiration after 
Europe was justified and normal, you have acknow­
ledged that there was truth on our side as well, 
and you have lowered your flag. 
"\Vell, we accept 
your acknowledgment good-heartcdly, and hasten 
to assure you that it is not at all bad on your part. 
At least it shows a certain intelligence in you, which 
indeed we never denied, with the exception perhaps 
of our stupidest members, for whom we have 
neither the will nor the power to be responsible, 
but . . .' Here you see another ' but ' appears, 
and it must be explained immediately. 
' The 
point is that your thesis and conclusion that in 
our enthusiasms we, as it were, coincided with the 
national spirit and were mysteriously guided by it 
-that proposition is still more than doubtful to us, 
and so an agreement between us once more becomes 
impossible. 
Please understand. that "·e were guided 
by Europe, by her science, and by Peter's reforms, 
but not by the spirit of the people at all, for we 
neither met nor scented this spirit on our way ; 
on the contrary, we left it behind and ran away 
from it as soon as we could. 
From the very outset 
we went our way independently, and did not in 
the least follow some instinct or other which is 
leading the Russian people to universal sympathy 
and the unification of mankind-to all that you 
have just talked so much about. 
In the Russian 
people, for the time has come to speak perfectly 
frankly, we see, as before, only an inert mass, from 
which we have nothing to learn, which, on the 
contrary, hinders Russia's development towards 

PUSHKIN 
something better, and must be wholly recreated 
and remade-if it is impossible organically, then 
mechanically at least-by simply making them obey 
us once for all. 
And to obtain this obedience we 
must adopt the social order just as it is in European 
countries, which we were discussing just now. 
Strictly speaking, our nation is poor and untidy, as 
it always has been, and can have neither individu­
ality nor ideal. The whole history of our people 
is absurd, from which you have deduced the devil 
knows "·hat, while we alone have looked at it 
soberly. 
It is necessary that a people like ours 
should have no history, anci that what it has in the 
shape of a history should be utterly forgotten by 
it in disgust. 
Only an intellectual society must 
have a history, and this society the people must 
se1Te, and only serve, with its labour and powers. 
' Don't worry and don't shout I 
'\Vc don't want 
to enslave our people when we talk of making it 
obey, of comsc not. 
Please don't rush to such 
conclusions. We arc humane, we are Europeans, 
you know that as well as we. 
On the contrary, 
we intend to develop our people gradually, in due 
order, and to crown our edifice by raising up the 
people to ourselves and by remaking its nationality 
into something different which will appear when 
its development is complete. 
We will lay the 
foundations of education and begin whence we 
ourselves started, with the renunciation of all the 
past, and with the damnation ·to which the people 
must itself deliver up its past. The moment we 
have taught one of the people to read and write, 
we shall immediately make him scent the delights 
of Europe, we will seduce him with Europe, 

44 
PUSHKIN 
by the refinement of European life, of European 
.customs, clothes, drinks,.dances-in a word, we will 
make hin1ashame(fof his bast shoes and his kvass, 
ashamed of his old songs, and though there arc 
many excellent, musical songs among them, we will 
make him sing vaudeville, no matter how furious 
you may be. 
In brief, for the good purpose, by 
any and every means, we will first work on the 
weak springs of his character, just as it has been 
in our case, and then the people will be ours. He 
will be ashamed of his past and will curse it. 
He 
who curses his past-is ours !-that is our formula. 
We will apply it to the full when we begin to raise 
up the people to ourselves. 
And if the people 
prove itself incapable of enlightenment, then " re­
move the people." 
For then it will be clearly 
shown that our people is only a worthless and bar­
barous horde, only to be made to obey. 
For what 
else is there to be done ? 
Truth exists in the intel­
lectuals and in Europe alone, and therefore though 
you have eighty million people-you seem to boast 
of it-all these millions must first serve this 
European truth, since there is not and cannot be 
another truth. 
You won't frighten us with your 
millions. That is our permanent conclusion, though 
you have it now in its nakedness. 
'Ve abide by it. 
\'Ve cannot accept your conclusions and talk to­
gether, for instance, about such a strange thing as 
the Pravoslavie1 and its so-called particular signifi­
cance. 
"r c hope at least that you will not expect 
it of us, above all at a time when the last word of 
Europe and European Science is an enlightened and 
humane atheism, and we can but follow Europe. 
1 The idea of thl! Orthodox Faith. 

PUSHKIN 
45 
' Therefore-well-we agree to accept with 
certain limitations that half of your speech in 
which you pay us compliments : yes, ,ye wil <lo 
you this kindness. As for the other half which 
refers to you and those " principles " of yours, 
please forgive us, but we cannot accept it.' 
ዲuc.h is_ the sad conclusion possible. , I repeat, not 
only would I not venture to put this conclusion into 
the mouths of the 'Vestcrnistswho pressed my hand, 
but not even into the mouths of a very great number 
of the most enlightened among them, Russian 
workers and perfect Russians, and, in spite of their 
theories, respectable and esteemed Russian citizens. 
But the mass, the great mass of those who have 
been uprooted, the outcasts, your Westernists, the 
average, the men in the street, through which the 
ideal is being dragged-all these rank and file of 
' the tendency,' as many as the sand of the sea, 
will say something of the kind, perhaps have already 
said it. 
(Concerning religion, for instance, one 
paper has already said, with its peculiar wit, that the 
aim of the Slavophiles is to rebaptize all Europe 
into orthodoxy.) 
But let us throw off gloomy 
thoughts and place our hope in the leaders of 
Europeanism. 
If they will accept only one half of 
our conclusions and our hopes in them, then honour 
and glory to them, and we shall meet them with full 
hearts. 
If they accept only one half, and aclmmY­
ledge the independence and the individuality of the 
Russian spirit, the justification of its being, and its 
humane tendency to universal unity, even then there 
will be nothing left to quarrel about, at least nothing 
of fundamental importance. 
Then my ' Speech ' 
would really serve for the foundation of a new event 

4G 
PUSHKIN 
-not the ' Speech ' itself, I repeat for the last time, 
(it is not worthy of such a name), but the solemn 
celebration of the mighty Pushkin, which was the 
occasion of our union-a union now of all sincere 
and enlightened Russians for the great purpose 
of the future. 

CHAPTER II 
A SPEECH 
DELIVERED 
ON 8TH JUNE 1880 AT THE 
MEETING 
OF 
THE 
SOCIETY 
OF 
LOVERS 
OF 
RUSSIAN LITERATURE 
PusHKIN is an extraordinary phenomenon, and, 
perhaps, the unique phenomenon of the Russian 
spirit, said Gogol. 
I will add, ' and a prophetic 
phenomenon.' 
Yes, in his appearing there is con­
tained for all us Russians, something incontestably 
prophetic. 
Pushkin arrives exactly at the begin­
ning of our true self-consciousness, which had only 
just begun to exist a whole century after Peter's 
reforms, and Pushkin's coming mightily aids us in 
our dark way by a new guiding light. 
In this sense 
Pushkin is a presage and a prophecy. 
I divide the activity of our great poet into three 
periods. 
I speak now not as a literary critic. 
I 
dwell on Pushkin's creative activity only to eluci­
date my conception of his prophetic significance to 
us, and the meaning I give the word prophecy. 
I 
would, however, observe in passing that the periods 
of Pushkin's activity do not seem to me to be 
marked off from each other by firm boundaries. 
The beginning of Eugene Onyegin, for instance, in 
my opinion belongs still to the first period, while 
Onyeginends in the second period when Pushkin had 
already found his ideals in his native land, had 
taken them to his heart and cherished them in his 

48 
PUSHKIN 
loving and clail·yoyant soul. 
It is said that in his 
first period Pushkin imitated European poets, 
Parny and Andre Chenier, and above all, Byron. 
Without doubt the poets of Europe had a great 
influence upon the development of his genius, and 
they maintained their influence all through his life. 
Nevertheless, even the very earliest poems of 
Pushkin were not mere imitations, and in them the 
extraordinary independence of his genius was ex­
pressed. 
In an imitation there never appears such 
individual suffering and such depths of self-con­
sciousness as Pushkin displayed, for instance, in 
The Gipsies, a poem "·hich I ascribe in its entirety 
to his first period ; not to mention the creative 
force and impetuosity which would never have been 
so evident had his work been only imitation. 
Al­
ready, in the character of Aleko, the hero of The 
Gipsies, is exhibited a powerful, profound, and 
purely Russian idea, later to be expressed in har­
monious perfection in Onyegin, where almost the 
same Aleko appears not in a fantastic light, but as 
tangible, real and comprehensible. 
In Aleko Push­
kin had already discovered, and portrayed with 
genius, the unhappy wanderer in his native land, 
the Russian sufferer of history, whose appearance 
in our society, uprooted from among the people, 
was a historic necessity. 
The type is true and 
perfectly rendered, it is an eternal type, long since 
settled in our Russian land. These homeless 
Russian wanderers are wandering still, and the time 
will be long before they disappear. 
If they in our 
day no longer go to gipsy camps to seek their 
universal ideals in the wild life of the Gipsies and 
their consolation away from the confused and 

PUSHKIN 
pointless life of our Russian intellectuals, in the 
bosom of nature, they launch into Socialism, which 
did not exist in Aleko's day, they march with a new 
faith into another field, and there work zealously, 
believing, like Aleko, that they will by their fantastic 
occupations obtain their aims and happiness, not 
for themselves alone, but for all mankind. For the 
Russian wanderer can find his own peace only in the 
happiness of all men ; he will not be more cheaply 
satisfied, at least while it is still a matter of theory. 
It is the same Russian man who appears at a 
different time. 
This man, I repeat, was born just 
at the beginning of the second century after Peter's 
great reforms, in an intellectual society, uprooted 
from among the people. 
Oh, the vast majority of 
intellectual Russians in Pushkin's time were serving 
then as they are serving now, as civil servants, in 
government appointments, in raihvays or in banks, 
or earning money in whatever way, or engaged in 
the sciences, delivering lectures-all this in a 
regular, leisurely, peaceful manner, receiving salaries, 
playing whist, without any longing to escape into 
gipsy camps or other places more in accordance 
with our modern times. They go only so far as to 
play the liberal, ' with a tinge of European Social­
ism,' to which Socialism is given a certain benign 
Russian character-but it is only a matter of time : 
·what if one has not yet begun to be disturbed, 
while another has already come up against a bolted 
door and violently beaten his head against it ? 
The same fate awaits all men in their turn, unless 
they walk in the saving road of humble communion 
with the people. 
But suppose that this fate does 
not. await them all : let ' the chosen ' suffice, let on!ʵ· 

50 
PUSH KIN 
a tenth part be disturbed lest the vast majority 
remaining should find no rest through them. 
Aleko, of course, is still unable to express his anguish 
rightly : 
with him everything is still somehow 
abstract ; he has only a yearning after nature, a 
grudge against high society, aspirations for all men, 
lamentations for the truth, which some one has 
somewhere lost, and he can by no means find. 
'Wherein is this truth, where and in what she could 
appear, and when exactly she was lost, he, of course, 
cannot say, but he suffers sincerely. 
In the mean­
time a fantastic and impatient person seeks for sal­
vation above all in external phenomena ; and so it 
should be. Truth is as it were somewhere outside 
himself, perhaps in some other European land, with 
their firm and historical political organisations and 
their established social and civil life. And he will 
never understand that the truth is first of all within 
himself. 
How could he understand this ? 
For a 
whole century he has not been himself in his own 
land. 
He has forgotten how to work, he has no 
culture, he has grown up like a convent schoolgirl 
within closed walls, he has fulfilled strange and un­
accountable duties according as he belonged to one 
or another of the fourteen classes into which edu­
cated Russian society is divided. 
For the time 
being he is only a blade of grass torn from the roots 
and blown through the air. 
And he feels it, and 
suffers for it, suffers often acutely ! 
Well, what if, 
perhaps belonging by birth to the nobility and pro­
bably possessing serfs, he allowed himself a noble­
man's liberty, the pleasant fancy of being charmed 
by men who live ' without laws,' and began to lead 
a performing bear in a gipsy camp ? 
Of course a 

PUSHKIN 
51 
woman, ' a wild woman,' as a certain poet says, 
would be most likely to give him hope of a way out 
of his anguish, and with an easy-going, but pas­
sionate belief, he throws himself into the arms of 
Zemphira. 
' Here is my way of escape ; here I can 
find my happiness, here in the bosom of nature far 
from the world, here with people who have neither 
civilisation nor law.' 
And what happens ? 
He 
cannot endure his first collision with the conditions 
of this wild nature, and his hands arc stained 'vith 
blood. 
The wretched dreamer was not only unfitted 
for universal harmony, but even for gipsies, anu 
they drive him away-without vengeance, without 
malice, with simple dignity. 
Leave us, proud ma n .  
"·c are wild and without law, 
\\. c tortlil'e not, neither do we punish. 
This is, of course, all fantastic, but the proud man 
is real, his image sharply caught. Pushkin "·as the 
first to seize the type, and we should remember this. 
Should anything happen in the least uegrec not to 
his liking, he is ready to torment cruelly and punish 
for the wrong done to him, or, more comfortable 
still, he will remember that he belongs to one of the 
fourteen classes, and will himself call upon-this 
has happened often-the torturing and punishing 
law, if only his private wrong may be revenged. 
No, this poem of genius is not an imitation ! 
Here 
already is whispered the Russian solution of the 
question, ' the accursed question,' in accordance 
with the faith and justice of the people. 
' Humble 
yourself, proud man, and first of all break down 
your pride. 
Humble yourself, idle man, and first 

52 
PUSHKIN 
of all labour on your native land '-that is the solu­
tion according to the wisdom and justice of the 
people. 
' Truth is not outside thee, but in thyself. 
Find thyself in thyself, subdue thyself to thyself, 
be master of thyself and thou wilt sec the truth. 
Not in things is this truth, not outside thee or 
abroad, but first of all in thine own labour upon 
thyself. 
If thou conquer and subdue thyself, then 
thou wilt be freer than thou hast ever dreamed, and 
thou wilt begin a great work and make others free, 
and thou wilt see happiness, for thy life will be ful­
filled and thou wilt at the last understand thy 
people and its sacred truth. 
Not with the Gipsies 
nor elsewhere is universal harmony, if thou thyself 
art first unworthy of her, malicious and proud, and 
thou dost demand life as a gift, not even thinking, 
that man must pay for her.' 
This solution of the 
question is strongly foreshadowed in Pushkin's 
poem. 
Still more clearly is it expressed in Eugene 
Onyegin, which is not a fantastic, but a tangible and 
realistic poem, in which the real Russian life is em­
bodied with a creative power and a perfection such 
as had not been before Pushkin and perhaps never 
after him. 
Onycgin comes from Petersburg. 
Certainly from 
Petersburg : it is beyond all doubt necessary to the 
poem, and Pushkin could not omit that all-impor­
tant realistic trait in the life of his hero. 
I repeat, 
he is the same Aleko, particularly when later on in 
the poem he cries in anguish : 
\Yhv am I not, like the assessor of Tula, 
Striʴkcu with palsy ? 
But now at the beginning of the poem he is still 

PUSHKIN 
53 
half a coxcomb and a man of the world ; he had 
lived too little to be utterly disappointed in life. 
But he is already visited and disturbed by 
The demon lord of hidden weariness. 
In a remote place, in the heart of his mother 
country, he is of course an exile in a foreign land. 
He does not know what to do and is somehow 
conscious of his own quest. Afterwards, wander­
ing over his native country and over foreign lands, 
he, beyond doubt clever and sincere, feels himself 
among strangers, still more a stranger to himself. 
True, he loves his native land, but he does not trust 
in it. 
Of course he has heard of national ideals, but 
he does not believe in them. He only believes in 
the utter impossibility of any work whatever in his 
native land, and upon those who believe in this possi­
bility-then, as now, but few-he looks with sorrow­
ful derision. He had killed Lensky out of spleen, 
perhaps from spleen born of yearning for the uni­
versal ideal-that is quite like us, quite probable. 
Tatiana is different. 
She is a strong character, 
strongly standing on her own ground. 
She is 
deeper than Onyegin and certainly wiser than he. 
With a noble instinct she divines where and what is 
truth, and her thought finds expression in the finale 
of the poem. Perhaps Pushkin would even have 
done better to call his poem Tatiana, and not 
Onyegin, for she is indubitably the chief character. 
She is positive and not negative, a type of positive 
beauty, the apotheosis of the Russian woman, and 
the poet destined her to express the idea of his poem 
in the famous scene of the final meeting of Tatiana. 
with Onyegin. One may even say that so beautiful 

54 
PUSHKIN 
or positive a type of the Russian woman has never 
been created since in our literature, save perhaps 
the figure of Li:.r.a in Turgenicv's A Nest of Gentle­
folk. 
But because of his way of looking down upon 
people, Onyegin did not even understand Tatiana 
when he met her for the first time, in a remote place, 
under the modest guise of a pure, innocent girl, who 
was at first so shy of him. He could not see the 
completeness nnd perfection of the poor girl, and 
perhaps he really took her for a ' moral embryo.' 
She, the embryo ! She, after her letter to Onyegin ! 
If there is a moral embryo in the poem, it is he him­
self, Onycgin, beyond all debate. And he could not 
comprehend her. Does he know the human soul ? 
He has been an abstract person, a restless dreamer, 
all his life long. 
Nor docs he comprehend her later 
in Petersburg, as a grand lady, when in the words 
of his own letter to her ' he in his soul understood 
all her perfections.' 
But these are only words. 
She passed through his life unrecognised by him 
and unappreciated : therein is the tragedy of their 
love. 
But if at his first meeting with her in the 
village Childe Harold had arrived from England, or 
even, by a miracle, Lord Byron himself, and had 
noticed her timid, modest beauty and pointed her 
out to him, oh, Onyegin would have been instantly 
struck with admiration, for in these universal 
sufferers there is sometimes so much spiritual 
servility ! 
But this did not happen, and the seeker 
after universal harmony, haYing read her a sermon, 
:.md having done very honestly by her, set off 
with his universal anguish and the blood of his 
friend, spilt in foolish anger, on his hands, to 
wander over his mother country, blind to her ; 

PUSHKIN 
55 
and, bubbling over with health and strength, he 
exclaims with an oath : 
I am yet young and life is strong in me, 
Yet what awaits me ?-anguish, anguish, anguish. 
This Tatiana understood. 
In the immortal lines 
of the romance the poet represented hercomingtosee 
the house of the man who is so wonderful and still 
so incomprehensible to her. 
I do not speak of the 
unattainable artistic beauty and profundity of the 
lines. She is in his study ; she looks at his books 
and possessions ; she tries through them to under­
stand his soul, to solve her enigma, and ' the moral 
embryo ' at last pauses thoughtfully, with a fore­
boding that her riddle is solved, and gently 
whispers : 
Pe(haps he is only a parody ? 
Yes, she had to whisper this ; she had divined 
him. Later, long afterwards in Petersburg, when 
they meet again, she knows him perfectly. 
By the 
way, who was it that said that the life of the court 
and society had affected her soul for the worse, and 
that her new position as a lady of fashion and her 
new ideas were in part the reason for her refusing 
Onyegin ? 
This is not true. 
No, she is the same 
Tanya, the same country Tanya as before ! 
She is 
not spoiled ; on the contrary, she is tormented by 
the splendid life of Petersburg, she is worn down by 
it and suffers : she hates her position as a lady of 
society, and whoever thinks otherwise of her, has 
no undersbmding of what Pushkin wanted to say. 
Now she says firmly to Onyegin : 
Now am I to another given : 
To him I will be faithful unto death. 

56 
PUSHKIN 
She said this as a Russian woman, indeed, and 
herein is her apotheosis. 
She expresses the truths 
of the poem. 
I shall not say a word of her religious 
convictions, her views on the sacrament of marriage 
-no, I shall not touch upon that. 
But then, did 
she refuse to follow him although she herself had 
said to him ' I love you ' ? 
Did she refuse because 
she, ' as a Russian woman ' (and not a Southern or a 
French woman), is incapable of a bold step or has 
not the power to sacrifice the fascination of honours, 
riches, position in society, the conventions of virtue ? 
No, a Russian woman is brave. A Russian woman 
will boldly follow what she believes, and she has 
proved it. 
But she ' is to another given ; to him 
she will be faithful unto death.' To whom, to what 
will she be true ? 
To what obligations be faithful ? 
Is it to that old general whom she cannot possibly 
love, whom she married only because ' with tears 
and adjurations her mother did beseech her,' and in 
her wronged and wounded soul was there then only 
despair and neither hope nor ray of light at all ? 
Yes, she is true to that general, to her husband, to 
an honest man who loves her, respects her, and is 
proud of her. Her mother ' did beseech her,' but it 
was she and she alone who consented, she herself 
swore an oath to be his faithful wife. 
She married 
him out of despair. But now he is her husband, and 
her perfidy will cover him with disgrace and shame 
and will kill him. 
Can any one build his happiness 
on the unhappiness of another ? 
Happiness is not 
in the !lclights of love alone, but also in the spirit's 
highest harmony. How could the spirit be appeased 
if behind it stood a dishonourable, merciless, in­
human action ? 
Should she run away merely 

PUSHKIN 
57 
because her happiness lay therein ? 
What kind of 
happiness would that be, based on the unhappiness 
of another ? Imagine that you yourself are build­
ing a palace of human destiny for the final end of 
making all men happy, and of giving them peace and 
rest at last. And imagine also that for that purpose 
it is necessary and inevitable to torture to death one 
single human being, and him not a great soul, but 
even in some one's eyes a ridiculous being, not a 
Shakespeare, but simply an honest old man, the 
husband of a young wife in whom he believes 
blindly, and whom, although he does not know her 
heart at all, he respects, of whom he is proud, with 
whom he is happy and at rest, He has only to be 
disgraced, dishonoured, and tortured, and on his 
dishonoured suffering your palace shall be built ! 
vVould you consent to be the architect on this con­
dition ? 
'l'hat is the question. 
Can you for one 
moment admit the thought that those for whom 
the building had been built would agree to receive 
that happiness from you, if its foundation was 
suffering, the suffering of an insignificant being 
perhaps, but one who had been cruelly and unjustly 
put to death, even if, when they had attained that 
happiness, they should be happy for ever ? 
Could 
Tatiana's great soul, which had so deeply suffered, 
have chosen otherwise ? 
No, a pure, Russian soul 
decides thus : Let me, let me alone be deprived of 
happiness, let my happiness be infinitely greater 
than the unhappiness of this old man, and finally let 
no one, not this old man, know and appreciate my 
sacrifice : but I will not be happy through having 
ruined another. 
Here is a tragedy in act, the line 
cannot be passed, and Tatiana sends Onyegin away. 

58 
PUSHKIN 
It may Le said : But Onyegin too is unhappy. She 
has saved one, and ruined the other. But that is 
another question, perhaps the most important in the 
poem. 
By the way, the question, Why did not 
Tatiana go away with Onyegin ? has with us, in our 
literature at least, a very characteristic history, and 
therefore I have allowed myself to dwell upon it. 
The most characteristic thing is that the moral 
solution of the question should have been so long 
subject to doubt. 
I think that even if Tatiana had 
been free and her old husband had died and she 
become a widow, even then she would not have gone 
away with Onyegin. 
But one must understand the 
essential substance of the character. 
She sees what 
he is. The eternal wanderer has suddenly seen the 
woman whom he had previously scorned in a new 
and unattainable setting. 
In this setting is perhaps 
the essence of the matter. 
The girl whom he almost 
despised is now adored by all society-society, the 
awful authority for Onyegin, for all his universal 
aspirations. That is 'rhy he throws himself, dazzled, 
at her feet. 
Here is my ideal, he cries,.here is my 
salvation, here is the escape from my anguish. 
I 
did not see her then, when ' happiness was so pos­
sible, so ncar.' 
And as before Aleko turned to 
Zemphira, so does Onyegin turn to Tatiana, seeking 
in his new, capricious fancy the solution of all his 
questions. 
But does not Tatiana see this in him, 
had she not seen it long ago ? 
She knows beyond a 
doubt that at bottom he loves his new caprice, and 
not her, the humble Tatiana as of old. 
She knows 
that he takes her for something else, and not for 
what she is, that it is not her whom he loves, that 
perhaps he does not love any one, is incapable of 

PUSHKIN 
59 
loving any one, although he suffers so acutely. 
He 
loves a caprice, but he himself is a caprice. 
If she 
were to follow him, then to-morrow he would be 
disillusioned and look with mockery upon his in­
fatuation. 
He has no root at all, he is a blade of 
grass, borne on the wind. She is otherwise : even 
in her despair, in the painful consciousness that her 
life has been ruined, she still has something solid 
and unshakable upon which her soul may bear. 
These are the memories of her childhood, the 
reminiscences of her country, her remote village, in 
which her pure and humble life had begun : it is 
the woven shade 
Of branches that o'erhang her nurse's grave. 
0 h, these memories and the pictures of the past are 
most precious to her now ; these alone are left to 
her, but they do save her soul from final despair. 
And this is not a little, bnt rather much, for there is 
here a whole foundation, unshakable and indestruc­
tible. 
Here is contact with her own land, with her 
own people, and with their sanctities. And he­
what has he and what is he ? 
Nothing, that she 
should follow him out of compassion, to amuse him, 
to give him a moment's gift of a mirage of happiness 
out of the infinite pity of her love, knowing well 
beforehand that to-morrow he would look on his 
happiness with mockery. No, these are deep, firm 
souls, which cannot deliberately give their sanctiti<:>s 
to dishonour, even from infinite compassion. 
No, 
Tatiana could not follow Onyegin. 
Thus in Onycgin, that immortal and unequalled 
poem, Pushkin was revealed as a great national 
writer, unlike any before him. 
In one stroke, with 

60 
PUSHKIN 
the extreme of exactness and insight, he defined the 
very inmost essence of our high society that stands 
above the people. 
He defined the type of the 
Russian wanderer before our day and in our day ; 
he was the first to divine him, with the jlai1· of 
genius, to divine his destiny in history and his 
enormous significance in our destiny to be. Side 
by side he placed a type of positive and indubitable 
beauty in the person of a Russian woman. 
Besides, 
of course, he was the first Russian writer to show us, 
in his other works of that period, a whole gallery of 
positively beautiful Russian types, finding them in 
the Russian people. The paramount beauty of 
these lies in their truth, their tangible and indubi­
table truth. It is impossible to deny them, they 
stand as though sculptured. 
I would remind you 
again. I speak not as a literary critic, and therefore 
do not intend to elucidate my idea by a particular 
and detailed literary discussion of these works of the 
poet's genius. 
Concerning the type of the Russian 
monkish chronicler, for instance, a whole book 
might be written to show the importance and 
meaning for us of this lofty Russian figure, dis­
covered by Pushkin in the Russian land, portrayed 
and sculptured by him, and now eternally set before 
us in its humble, exalted, indubitable spiritual 
beauty, as the evidence of that mighty spirit of 
national life which can send forth from itself figures 
of such certain loveliness. 
This type is now given ; 
he exists, he cannot be disputed ; it cannot be said 
that he is only the poet's fancy and ideal. 
You 
yourself see and agree : Yes, he exists, therefore the 
spirit of the nation which created him exists also, 
therefore the vital power of this spirit exists and is 

PUSHKIN 
61 
mighty and vast. 
Throughout Pushkin sounds a 
belief in the Russian character, in its spiritual 
might ; and if there is belief, there is hope also, the 
great hope for the man of Russia. 
In the hope of glory and good 
I look without fear ahead, 
said the poet himself on another occasion ; but the 
words may be applied directly to the whole of his 
national, creative activity. And yet no single 
Russian writer, before or after him, did ever asso­
ciate himself so intimately and fraternally with his 
people as Pushkin. 
Oh, we have a multitude of 
experts on the people among our writers, who have 
written about the people, with talent and knowledge 
and love, and yet if we compare them with Pushkin, 
then in reality, with one or at most two exceptions 
among his latest followers, they will be found to be 
only ' gentlemen ' writing about the masses. Even 
in the most gifted of them, even in the two excep­
tions 1 I have just mentioned, sometimes appears a 
sudden flash of something haughty, something from 
another life and world, something which desires to 
raise the people up to the writer, and so to make 
them happy. 
But in Pushkin there is something 
allied indeed to the people, which in him rises on 
occasion to some of the most nai:vc emotions. 
Take his story of The Bear, and how a peasant killed 
the bear's mate ; or remember the verses, 
Kinsman John, when we begin to drink .
.
.
 
and you will understand what I mean. 
All these treasures of art and artistic insight are 
left by our great poet as it were a landmark for the 
I Turgeniev and Tolstoi are meant. 

62 
PUSHKIN 
writers who should come after him, for future 
labourers in the same field. 
One may say posi­
tively that if Pushkin had not existed, there would 
not have been the gifted writers who came after 
him. At least they would not have displayed 
themselves with such power and clarity, in spite of 
the great gifts with "·hich they have succeeded in 
expressing themselves in our day. 
But not in 
poetry alone, not in artistic creation alone : if 
Pushkin had not existed, there would not have been 
expressed with the irresistible force with whieh it 
appeared after him (not in all writers, hut in a 
chosen few), our belief in our Russian individuality, 
our now conscious faith in the people's powers, and 
finally the belief in our future individual destiny 
among the family of European nations. This 
achievement of Pushkin's is particularly displayed 
if one examines what I call the third period of his 
activity. 
_ I  repeat, there are no fixed divisions between the 
periods. Some of the works of even the third period 
might have been written at the very beginning oft he 
poet's artistic activity, for Pushkin was always n 
complete whole, as it were a perfect organism carry­
ing within itself at once every one of its principles, 
not receiving them from beyond. 
The beyond only 
awakened in him that which was already in the 
depths of his soul. But this organism developed 
and the phases of this development could really be 
marked and defined, each of them by its peculiar 
character and the regular generation of one phase 
from another. Thus to the third period can be 
assigned those of his works in which universal ideas 
were pre-eminently reflected, in which the poetic 

PUSHKIN 
63 
conceptions of other nations were mirrored and their 
genius re-embodied. 
Some of these appeared after 
Pushkin's death. 
And in this period the poet 
reveals something almost miraculous, never seen or 
heard at any time or in any nation before. 
There 
had been in the literatures of Europe men of colossal 
artistic genius-a Shakespeare, 
a Cervantes, a 
Schiller. 
But show me one of these great geniuses 
who possessed such a capacity for uninrsal sym­
pathy as our Pushkin. 
This capacity, the pre­
eminent capacity of our nation, he shares with our 
nation, and by that above all he is our national poet. 
The greatest of European poets could never so 
powerfully embody in themselves the genius of a 
foreign, even a neighbouring, people, its spirit in all 
its hidden depth, and all its yearning after its 
appointed end, as Pushkin could. 
On the contrarዮ'· 
when they turned to foreign nations European pods 
most often made them one with their own people, 
and understood them after their own fashion. 
Even Shakespeare's Italians, for instance, arc almosL 
always Englishmen. 
Pushkin's alone of all world 
poets possessed the capacity of fully identifying 
himself "·ith another nationality. 
Take scenes 
from Faust, take The 11liserly Knight, take the 
ballad ' Once there LiYCd a Poor Knight ' ;  reml 
Don Juan again. 
Had Pushkin not signed them, 
you would never know that they were not written 
by a Spaniard. 
How profound and fantastic is the 
imagination in the poem ' A Feast in Time of 
Plague.' 
But in this fantastic imagination is the 
genius of England ; and in the hero's wonderful 
song about the plague, and in Mary's song, 
Our children's voices in the noisv school 
Were heard 
. 
. 
. 
• 

64 
PUSHKIN 
These are English songs ; this is the yearning of the 
British genius, its lament, its painful presentiment 
of its future. 
Remember the strange lines : 
Once as I wandered through the valley wild. 
It is almost a literal transposition of the first three 
pages of a strange mystical book, written in prose 
by an old English sectarian-but is it only a trans­
position ? 
In the sad and rapturous music of these 
verses is the very soul of Northern Protestantism, 
of the English heresiarch, of the illimitable mystic 
with his dull, sombre, invincible aspiration, and the 
impetuous power of his mystical dreaming. 
As you 
read these strange verses, you seem to hear the spirit 
of the times, of the Reformation, yon understand 
the warlike fire of early Protestantism, and finally 
history herself, not merely by thought but as one 
who passes through the armed sectarian camp, sings 
psalms with them, weeps with them in their religious 
ecstasies, and with them believed in their belief. 
Then set beside this religious mysticism, religious 
verses from the Koran or ' Imitations from the 
Koran.' Is there not here a 1\Iohammedan, is it not 
the very spirit of the Koran and its sword, the nai:ve 
grandeur of faith and her terrible, bloody power ? 
And here is the ancient world ; here arc Egyptian 
Nights, here sit the gods of earth, ·who sat aboye 
their people like gods, and despised the genius of the 
people and its aspirations, who became gods in 
isolation, and went mad in their isolation, in the 
anguish of their weariness unto death, diverting 
themsclYes with fanatic brutalities, with the volup­
tuousness of creeping things, of a she-spider de,·om­
ing her male. No, I will say rlcliberatcly, then'

never had been a poet with a universal sympathy like 
Pushkin's. And it is not his sympathy alone, but 
his amazing profundity, the reincarnation of his 
spirit in the spirit of foreign nations, a reincarna­
tion almost perfect and therefore also miraculous, 
because the phenomenon has never been repeated 
in any poet in all the world. It is only in Pushkin ; 
and by this, I repeat, he is a phenomenon never seen 
and never heard of before, and in my opinion, a 
prophetic phenomenon, because . . . because here­
in was expressed the national spirit of his poetry, the 
national spirit in its future development, the national 
spirit of our future, which is already implicit in the 
present, and it was expressed prophetically. 
For 
what is the power of the spirit of Russian nationality 
if not its aspiration after the final goal of univer­
sality and omni-humanity ? 
No sooner had he 
become a completely national poet, no sooner had 
he come into contact with the national pmvcr, than 
he already anticipated the great future of that 
power. 
In this he was a seer, in this a prophet. 
For what is the reform of Peter the Great to us, 
not merely for the future, but in that which has been 
and has already been plainly maniiዯsted to us ? 
What did that reform mean to us ? Surely it m1s 
not only the adoption of European clothes, CU!itoms, 
inventions and science. 
Let us exami11e how it w<.s, 
let us look more steadily. 
Yes, it is very probable 
that at the outset l)eter beg:w his reform in this 
narrowly utilitarian sense, but in course of time, as 
his idea developed, Peter undoubtedly obeyed somደ 
hidden instinct which drew him and his work to 
future purposes, undoubtedly more vast than 
narrow utilitarianism. 
Just as the Russian people 

66 
PUSHKIN 
did not accept the reform in the utilitarian spirit 
alone ; but undoubtedly with a presentiment which 
almost instantly forewarned them of a distant and 
incomparably higher goal than mere utilitarianism. 
I repeat, the people felt that purpose unconsciously, 
but it felt it directly and quite vitally. 
Surely we 
then turned at once to the most vital reunion, to the 
unity of all mankind ! 
Not in a spirit of enmity (as 
one might have thought it would have been) but in 
friendliness and perfect love, we received into our 
soul the geniuses offoreign nations, all alike without 
preference of race, able by instinct from almost the 
very first step to discern, to discount distinctions, to 
excuse and reconcile them, and therein we already 
showed our readiness and inclination, which had 
only just become manifest to ourselves, for a 
common and universal union with all the races of 
the great Aryan family. 
Yes, beyond all doubt, the 
destiny of a Russian is pan-European and universal. 
To becoine a true Russian, to become a Russian 
fully, (in the end of all, I repeat) means only to 
become the bt·other of all men, to become, if you 
will, a universዱ1 man. 
All our Slavophilism and 
'Vesternisni l.s only a great misunderstanding, even 
thoHgh hi.<>torically necessary. 
To a true Russian, 
Eur0pe and the destiny of all the mighty Aryan 
family is as de&.r as Russia herself, as the destiny of 
his own native country, bceause our destiny is 
universality, won n0t by the sword, but by the 
strength of brotherhood. and our ft·aternal aspiration 
to reunite mankind. If you go dcc1) into our history 
since Peter's reform, you will already find traces 
and indications of this idea, of this dream of mine, 
if you will, in the character of our intc1·coursc with 

PUSHKIN 
67 
European nations, even in the policy of the state. 
For what has Russian policy been doing for these 
two centuries if not serving 'Europe, perhaps, far 
more than she has served herself. 
I do not believe 
this came to pass through the incapacity of our 
statesmen. The nations of Europe know how dear 
they are to us. 
And in course of time I believe that 
we-not we, of course, but our children to come­
will a11 without exception understand that to be a 
true Russian docs indeed mean to aspire finally to 
reconcile the contradictions of Europe, to show the 
end of European yearning in our Russian soul, omni­
human and all-uniting, to include within our soul 
by brotherly love all our brethren, and at last, it 
may be, to pronounce the final \Vord of the great 
general harmony, of the final brotherly communion 
of all nations in accordance with the law of the 
gospel of Christ ! 
I know, I know too well, that 
my words may appear ecstatic, ',xaggerated and 
fantastic. 
Let them be so, I do not repent having 
uttered them. They ought to be uttered, above all 
now, at the moment that we honour our great genius 
who by his artistic power cmbodiP.IJ this idea. 
The 
idea has been expressed mai1.:'j' times buየorc. 
I say 
nothing new. But chiefly it will appear ዩዪresump­
tuous. 
' Is this our dest"lny, the destiny of OU1 1ያoor, 
brutal land ?

to utter the new wǼǽ 1 ? ' 
Do I speak of f!:corwmic glory, of the glory of the 
sword or of science ? I speak only·ofthe brotherhood. 
of man ; I sa y that to this universal, omni-human 
union the heart of Russia, perhaps more than all 
other nation.>, is chiefly predestined ; I see its traces 
in our history, our men of genius, in the artistic 

68 
PUSHKIN 
genius of Pushkin. 
Let our country be poor, but 
this poor land ' Christ traversed with blessing, in the 
garb of a serf.' 
Why then should we not contain 
His final word ? 
'Vas not He Himself born in a 
manger ? 
I say again, we at least can already point 
to Pushkin, to the universality and omni-humanity 
of his genius. 
He surely could contain the genius of 
foreign lands in his soul as his own. 
In art at least, 
in artistic creation, he undeniably revealed this 
universality of the aspiration of the Russian spirit, 
and therein is a great promise. 
If our thought is a 
dream, then in Pushkin at least this dream has solid 
foundation. Had he lived longer, he would perhaps 
have revealed great and immortal embodiments of 
the Russian soul, which would then have been in­
telligible to our European brethren ; he would have 
attracted them much more and closer than they are 
attracted now, perhaps he would have succeeded in 
explaining to them all the truth of our aspirations ; 
and they would understand us more than they do 
now, they would have begun to have insight into us, 
and would have ceased to look at us so suspiciously 
and prcsumptw".ዬይ1r as they still do. 
Had Pushkin 
lived long<':, then amu.ዳ1g us too there would perhaps 
be fewc!- misunderstandings and quarrels than we 
SL " ;1ow. But God saw uJhcrwisc. Pushkin died 
n the full maturity of his 1;\owcrs, and undeniably 
)Ore away with him a great see ret into the grave. 
And now we, without him, arc set:>king to divine his 
secret.

THE 
OCCASION OF ONE LECTURE, BY l\1. GRADOVSKY. 
WITH AN ADVERTISEMENT TO M. GRADOVSKY. 
§ 1 
OF ONE VERY FUNDAMENTAL THING 
I IIAD just been putting the finishing touch to my 
Journal, confining it to my ' Speech,' delivered in 
Moscow on the 8th of June, and to the foreword 
which I had written, anticipating the fuss which 
was actually made by the press after the publication 
of my ' Speech ' in the Jlloskovskaia Viedomosti. 
But when I had read your criticism, l\1. Gradovsky, 
I delayed the publication of my Joumal in order to 
add to it also my answer to your attacks. 
Oh, my 
misgivings were justified. There was a terrible fuss. 
' I  am haughty.' 
' I  am a coward.' 
' I  am a 
l\Ianilov,1 and a poet.' ' The police should be called 
in to suppress these public outbursts '-the moral 
police, the liberal police, of course. 
But why not 
the real police ? 
The real police nowadays are 
quite as liberal as the liberals themselves. Truly, 
it is only a very little less than calling in the real 
police ! 
But we will leave that for the meanwhile ; 
I will answer your points immediately. 
1 A sentimental liar, from Gogo!. 
69 

70 
PUSHKIN 
From the very beginning I will confess that I per­
sonally have nothing to do, or to discuss, with you. 
It is impossible for me to come to an understanding 
with you ; and therefore I have no thought either of 
persuading or dissuading you. 
When I read some 
of your previous articles, I naturally was always 
amazed by the trend of your thought. 
So why 
should I answer you now ? 
Simply because I have 
in view the others who "'ill judge between us-the 
public. For them I am writing now. 
I hear, I feel, I even see that new elements are 
rising and springing forth, whieh thirst for a new 
word, which are siek and tired of the old liberal 
giggling at any "·ord of hope for Russia, sick and 
tired of the old toothless liberal scepticism, sick 
and tired of the old corpses who have forgotten to 
be buried and still take themselves for the rising 
generation, sick and tired of the old liberal guide 
and saviour of Russia, who after the whole twenty­
five years that he stayed "·ith us was ultimately 
defined, in the people's speech, as ' a  man who 
shouts for nothing in the market-place.' 
In a 
word, I should like to do a great deal more than 
to reply to your observations. In replying now, 
therefore, I have only seized an opportunity. 
First of all you question me and cYen reprove 
me, asking why I did not sho"· more clearly "·hence 
the ' wanderers ' came of whom I spoke in my 
' Speech ' ?  'Veil, that is a long story ; one would 
have to go back too far. 
Besides, whatever answer 
I made to that question, you would not agree, 
because you have already preconceived and pre­
pared your own solution of the question whence 
and how the ' wanderers ' came. 
' From weariness 

PUSH KIN 
71 
of living with Skvoznik-Dmuhanovskys,1 and from 
the social yearning after the as yet unliberated 
serfs.' 
A conclusion eminently worthy of a modern 
liberal-minded man, for whom everything that 
has to do with Russia hns been settled and signed 
long ago, with the extraordinary ease peculiar 
to the Russian Liberal alone. 
Nevertheless the 
question is more complicated than you think, far 
more complicated, in spite of your very final solu­
tion. 
I will speak elsewhere of ' Skvozniks and 
Yearning,' but first of all permit me to take hold of 
one most characteristic word of yours, spoken with 
a lightness that is already on the border of play­
fulness, a word which I cannot pass by in silence. 
You say : 
' "\Vhether this be so or no, two centuries have 
already passed since we have been under the in­
fluence of European enlightenment, which acts 
extremely strongly upon us by reason of the 
" universal sensitiveness " of the Russian, which l\1. 
Dostoevsky acknowledged to be our national trait. 
There is no way of escape from this enlightenment ; 
neither is there any need to escape. 
It is a fact, 
against which we can do nothing for this simple 
reason, that every Russian who desires to be en­
lightened, must get this enlightenment from a 
western European source, because of the absolute 
lack of sources in Russia.' 
Certainly it is playfully expressed, but you have 
also uttered an important word : enlightenment. 
Let me ask you then what you mean by it. 
The 
sciences of the 'Vest, the useful sciences and crafts, 
or spiritual enlightenment ? 
The former, the 
1 A type of cunning, petty swindler, taken from Gogol. 

72 
PUSHKIN 
sciences and crafts, must not pass by us unheeded : 
assuredly we must not avoid them, neither is there 
any need. 
I also agree fully that there is no source 
whence we may obtain them save in 'Vestern 
Europe, for which our praise and gratitude to 
Europe shall be eternal. 
But by enlightenment I 
understand (I think that every one is bound to 
understand) that which is literally expressed in the 
very word : enlightenment-a spiritual light which 
shines upon the soul and illumines the heart, which 
directs the mind and reveals to it the way of life. 
If this be so, then allow me to observe that for this 
enlightenment we have no need to go to 'Vestern 
European sources because of the absolute sufficiency 
(not the absolute lack) of sources in Russia. You 
are surprised ? 
You see, in discussion I love to 
begin with the very substance of the matter, 
and at once to grapple with the most disputable 
point. 
I assert that our people became enlightened long 
ago, by taking into its essential soul Christ and His 
teaching. 
I may be told it has no knowledge of 
Christ's teaching, for no sermons are preached to it. 
But this is an empty objection. It knows indeed 
everything that it needs to know, though it cannot 
pass an examination in the catechism. 
It came to 
know this in temples where for centuries it had 
heard prayers and hymns which are better than 
sermons. The people repeated and sang these 
prayers while they were still in the forests, in hiding 
from their enemies ; perhaps as long ago as the 
invasion of llatu-Khan they sang : 
' Lord of 
Powers, be with us ! ' and then perhaps they won a 
firm knowledge of that hymn, because iiothing was 

PUSHKIN 
73 
left to them but Christ, and in that one hymn is all 
the Christian truth. What of it that the people 
hear no sermons and the clerks mumble indistinctly, 
which is the greatest accusation levelled against our 
Church, an accusation invented by the Liberals 
together with the inconvenience of the ecclesiastical 
Slavonic language, which is supposed to be incom· 
prehensible to the common people ? What of it ? 
Instead, the priest stands forth and reads : ' Lord 
Sovereign of my life '___:in this prayer is the whole 
essence of Christianity, all its catechism, and the 
people know this prayer by heart. They also know 
by heart many Lives of the Saints ; they tell them 
over and over again and listen to them with deep 
emotion. 
But the greatest school of Christianity 
through which they have passed are the centuries 
of innumerable and unending sufferings which they 
have endured through their history when, deserted 
by all, trodden down by all, working in all places 
and for all men, they remained with Christ alone, 
Christ the Consoler whom they had taken into their 
soul for ever, and who in return had saved their 
souls from despair ! 
But why do I tell you all this ? 
Do I desire to convince you ? 
l\Iy words will 
assuredly appear to you childish, almost indecent. 
But for the third time I say : it is not for you that 
I 
am writing. 
And the matter is important. 
Concerning it I must speak particularly and at 
length, and so long as I can hold a pen in my fingers, 
I will speak. 
But now I will only express the funda­
mental basis of my thought. 
If our people have 
already been enlightened long ago by having re­
ceived into their essential soul Christ and His teach­
ing, then with Him, with Christ, they assuredly 

74 
PUSHKIN 
have received the true enlightenment also. 
Com­
bined with such a deep store of enlightenment the 
sciences of the 'Vest will of course become a true 
blessing to the people. 
Christ Himself will not be 
eclipsed by the sciences, as in the 'Vest, where, how­
ever, He was not eclipsed by the sciences, as the 
Liberals assert, but long before the advent of science, 
when the ·western Church herself distorted the 
image of Christ, changing herself from a Church 
into a Roman State, and again incarnating the State 
in the form of the Papacy. 
Yes, in the \Vest 
Christianity and the Church truly exist no longer, 
though there are still many Christians, nor will they 
ever disappear. 
Catholicism is truly Christianity 
no longer ; it degenerates into idolatry : and Pro­
testantism with giant strides runs down the steep 
into Atheism and into a "·avcring, fluid, fickle, 
instead of an eternal, morality. 
Oh, of course, you will instantly reply that 
Christianity and the worship of Christ does by no 
means comprise in itself and by itself the whole cycle 
of enlightenment, that it is only one rung of the 
ladder, that there is need besides of science, of social 
ideals, of progress und the rest. 
To that I have 
nothing to reply ; moreover it "·ould be indecent to 
reply, for though you arc right in part, concerning 
science, for instance, you will never agree that the 
Christianity of our people is and must for ever remain 
the chiefest and most vital basis of its enlighten­
ment. 
In my ' Speech ' I said that Tatiana, by her 
refusal to follow Onyegin acted like a Russian, 
according to the Russian national truth. 
One of 
my critics, offended at finding that the Russian 
people has a truth of its own, replied with the ques-

PUSHKIN 
75 
tion : ' What about promiscuity ? ' 
Can such a 
critic be answered ? 
The chief cause of his taking 
offence is that the Russian people should have a 
truth of its own, and therefore should be really en­
lightened. 
But does promiscuity exist throughout 
the whole of our people, and does it exist as a truth ? 
Does the whole people take it for a truth ? 
Yes, 
the people are coarse, though by no means all, by 
no means all. This I can swear upon oath, because I 
have seen the people and known them. I have lived 
with them years enough, I have eaten and slept with 
them and I myself have been ' reckoned with the 
transgressors ' ; with them I worked real work and 
hard, while others ' whose hands were washed in 
blood,' playing the liberal and sniggering at the 
people, settled in lectures and magazine articles 
that our people is of ' the likeness and the seal of the 
Beast.' Don't tell me, then, that I do not know the 
people ! 
I do know them. From them I received 
Christ into my soul once more, whom I knew in the 
home of my childhood, and whom I all but lost 
when in my turn I changed into ' a European 
Liberal.' But let us grant that our people is sinful 
and coarse, let us grant that his likeness is still the 
likeness of the Beast. 
The son rode his mother, 
His young wife the trace horse. 
There must be a reason for this people's song ? All 
Russian songs are built upon some actual event, 
you have observed that ? 
But be just, only for 
once, you liberal minds. Remember what our 
people has endured through so many centuries ! 
Remember who is chiefly to blame for the likeness 

76 
PUSHKIN 
of the Beast, and do not condemn I 
But it is ludi­
crous to condemn the peasant because he does not 
have his hair cut by the coiffeur on the Great 
1\lorskaia. 
Yet to such heights of accusation do our 
European Liberals almost reach when they rise up 
against the Russian people and begin to deny them. 
They have not developed an individuality. They 
have not even a national character. 
And in the 
\Vest, by God, wherever you will, in 'vhatevcr nation 
you choose-is there less drunkenness and robbery, 
is there not the same bestiality, and into the bargain 
an obduracy which is not to be found in our people, 
and a true and veritable ignorance, a real unen­
lightenment, because it is often connected with a 
lawlessness which is there no longer considered as 
sin, but has begun to be held for truth ? Let there 
be bestiality and sin among our people, but what 
there is incontestably within them is that they, at 
least as a whole, and not only in the ideal, but in the 
very real reality, neither accept nor desire to accept 
their sin for truth ! 
Our peasant may sin, but he 
will always say sooner or later : ' I did falsely.' 
If 
the sinner will not say it, then another will say it for 
him, and the truth will be fulfilled. 
Sin is a stench, 
and the stench will pass away when the sun shines 
fully. Sin is passing, Christ is eternal. The people 
sins and defiles itself daily, but in its best moments, 
in its Christian moments, it will never mistake the 
truth. It is indeed important, in what the people 
believes as its truth, in what it finds her, how it 
represents her to itself, what it holds for its best 
desire, what it has come to love, what it asks of God, 
for what it prays and weeps. 
And the ideal of the 
people-is Christ. And surely with Christ is en-

PUSHKIN 
77 
lightenment ; and in its highest and most crucial 
moments our people always decides and always has 
decided every matter of their commonweal absol­
utely according to Christ. You will jeer and say : 
' It is not enough to cry, neither to sigh ; one must 
also do, one must also be.' And among yourselves, 
you Russian enlightened Europeans, are there 
many righteous ? 
Show me your righteous, whom 
you prefer before Christ ? 
But know that among 
the people there are righteous. 
There are positive 
characters of unimaginable beauty and power whom 
your observation has not yet touched. 
These 
righteous and martyrs for truth do exist, whether 
we see them or not. 
He who has eyes to see, he will 
see them ; but he who has eyes only for the likeness 
of the Beast, he of course }Viii sec nothing. 
But our 
people at least knows that there are righteous and 
martyrs among them, and believes that they are 
there. The people is strong with this knowledge 
and with the hope that in the moment of common 
need they will save them. And how many times 
has the people saved the country ? And but lately, 
defiled in sin, drunkenness and depravity, the 
spirit of the people, of all the people as one whole, 
rejoiced at the recent war for the faith of the Chris­
tian Slavs which had been trampled underfoot by 
the Turks. 
The people embraced the war, and took 
it as a sacrifice in expiation for its unrighteousness 
and sin ; it sent its sons to die for a sacred cause, 
and did not wail because the rouble was falling and 
the price of food was rising. 
I know the elevation 
of the spirit of our people in the last war ; but the 
Liberals do not recognise the causes of that elevation, 
they laugh at the idea : ' This canaille with a collec-

78 
PUSHKIN 
tive ideal, a social sense, a political idea-impos­
sible ! '  And why, why is our European Liberal so 
often the enemy of the Russian people ? 
'Why is it 
that in Europe those who call themselves democrats 
always stand for the people, or at any rate always 
rely on the people, while our democrat is often an 
aristocrat, nearly always supports that which 
oppresses the power of the people and ends by 
becoming a despot. 
Oh, I do not assert that they 
are consciously the enemies of the people ; the 
tragedy is that it is not conscious. 
You will be 
exasperated by these questions ? 
Well, all these 
things arc axioms to me, and of course I shall go on 
demonstrating and proving them so long as I can 
write and speak. 
Let me finish thus : sciences, certainly, but en­
lightenment we have no need to imbibe from any 
Western European source, or we may imbibe such 
social formulx as, for instance, Cltacun 1Jour soi et 
Diett pour tous or Apres moi, lc deluge. 
Oh, it will 
be said instantly : ' Haven't we such sayings of our 
own : "The taste of a man's salt is always forgotten," 
and hundreds of other proverbs of that kind ? ' 
Y cs, there arc a host of sayings of all kinds among 
the people. 
The mind of the people is broad, its 
humour too ; the developed consciousness always 
whispers a negation. But all these are only sayings : 
our people does not believe in their moral truth, it 
laughs at them and mocks them, and as a body, at 
least, it denies them. 
But will you venture to assert 
that Chacun pour soi ct Dictt pour tous is only a 
saying, and not an established social formula, 
accepted by everybody in the West, which all 
Westerners serve and in which they all helicvc ? 

PUSHKIN 
79 
At least, all those who stand above the people, who 
keep the people in check, who are masters of the 
land and the proletariat, and who stand sentinel 
over ' European enlightenment.' 
Of what use to 
us is that enlightenment ? 
Let us search for a 
different enlightenment among ourselves. Science 
is one thing ; enlightenment another. By hope 
in our people and its powers we will perhaps at 
some time develop in fulncss, in perfect radiance 
and illumination, this Christian enlightenment of 
ours. 
You will of course tell me that this long discourse 
of mine is not an answer to your criticism. Granted. 
I myself consider it only a preface, but a necessary 
one. 
Just as you discover and indicate in me, in 
my ' Speech,' the points wherein I differ from you, 
which you consider the most important and para­
mount, so have I first of all indicated and displayed 
the point in you where I consider our most funda­
mental discord lies, which more than all else pre­
vents our coming to an agreement. 
But the preface 
is over. Let me proceed to your criticism, hence­
forward without digressions.

ALEKO 
AND 
DERZHDIORDA. 
ALEKO's 
YEARNINGS 
AFTER TilE SERFS. 
AqECDOTES 
You write in criticism of my ' Speech ' : 
' But Pushkin, in portraying Aleko and Onyegin 
with their denial, did not show exactly what they 
" denied," and it would be extremely rash to assert 
that they denied " the national truth," the funda-

80 
PUSHKIN 
mental principles of the Russian conception of the 
world. 
This is nowhere evident.' 
• 
Well, whether it is evident or not, whether it is 
rash to assert it or not-to that question we shall 
return immediately ; but first, this is what you say 
of the Dmuhanovskys from whom Aleko is supposed 
to have run to the Gipsies. 
' But really the world ofthosc old wanderers,' you 
write, ' was a world which denied another world. 
To explain these types other types are necessary, 
and these Pushkin did not create, though he turned 
towards them at times with burning indignation. 
The nature of his genius prevented him from de­
scending into this darkness and from making " a  
gem of creation " out of the owls and bats which 
crowded the basements of the Russian House [and 
not the upper floors as well ? (Dostoevsky)]. This 
Gogol did, Gogol the great reverse of Pushkin. He 
told the world why Aleko ran to the Gipsies, why 
Onyegin was weary, why " superfluous people " had 
come into the world, the men whom Turgeniev was 
to immortalise.

kin-thcse are the dark side of Aleko, Beltov, Rudin 
and many others. 
These arc the background with­
out which the latter figures arc not to be understood. 
And these Gogol heroes were Russians ; how very 
llussian they were ! 
Korobochka had no world­
sorrow, Skvoznik-Dmuhanovsky could deal splen­
didly with tradesmen, Sobakievich saw through his 
peasants and they saw through him as well. 
Cer­
tainly Aleko and Rudin did not see all this fully, nor 
did they understand it ; they simply ran away 
I All these are realistic types from Gogol, 

PUSHKIN 
81 
wherenr they could, Aleko to the Gipsies, Rudin to 
Paris, to die for a cause completely foreign to him.' 
You see ' they simply ran away.' Easy solution, 
like a feuilleton ! 
And how simply you put it, how 
beautifully prepared and settled everything is with 
you ! 
Truly the words are ready to your tongue. 
But, by the way, why did you let drop that all these 
Gogo! heroes were Russians, ' Oh, how very Russian 
they were ! '  It has nothing at all to do with our 
discussion. \Vho does not know that they were 
Russians ? Aleko and Onyegin were also Russians, 
you and I arc also Russians ; Rudin also was 
Russian, thoroughly Russian-Rudin who ran away 
to Paris to die for a cause, as you say, completely 
foreign to him. 
But for this very reason he is super­
latively Russian, because the cause for which he died 
in Paris was by no means so foreign to him as it 
would have been to an Englishman or a German ; 
for a European cause, a world-cause, a universal 
human cause, has long since not been foreign to a 
Russian. 
That is Rudin's distinctive characteristic. 
Rudin's tragedy strictly was that he could find no 
work in his native fields, and he died on another's 
fields, which were, however, nothing like so foreign 
to him as you say. 
However, the point is this : all 
these Skvoznik-Dmuhanovskys and Sobakieviches, 
though Russians, are Russians spoiled, torn from 
the soil ; and though they know the life of the 
people on one side, knowing nothing of the other, 
and not even suspecting that the other side does 
really exist-this is the whole point. 
The soul of 
the people, that for which the people thirsts, for 
which the people asks in a spirit of prayer, this 
they did not even suspect, because they terribly 

82 
PUSHKIN 
despised the people. 
They even denied. his soul, ex­
cept perhaps for the purpose of the census.1 ' Soba­
kievich saw through his peasants,' you assert. That 
is impossible. Sohakievich saw in his Proshka only 
so much labour, which he could sell to Chichikov. 
You assert that Skvoznik-Dmuhanovsky could 
manage tradesmen splendidly. Heavens above ! 
Read once more the monologue of the pl'Ovost to the 
tradesmen in the fifth act. 
Only dogs are treated 
in that way, not men. 
Is this to manage a Russian 
splendidly ? 
Do you really praise it ? 
It would 
be far better to give them a blow in the face or drag 
them by their hair. In my childhood I once saw 
on the high road a IGng's 1\Icssenger, in a uniform 
with revers, and a three-cornered hat with a feather, 
who never stopped beating the driver with his fist, 
while the driver madly lashed. his sweating, galloping 
troika team. The King's Messenger was, of course, 
a Russian born, but so blinded, so far torn from out 
the people, that he had no other way of dealing 
with a Russian than by his huge fist, instead of any 
human speech. 
Yet he had passed his whole life 
with post-boys and all sorts of Russian peasants. 
But the revers of his uniform, his feathered hat, his 
rank as an officer, his patent-leather Petersburg 
boots, were dearer to him, psychologically and 
spiritually, not only than the Russian peasant, but 
perhaps than the whole of Russia, which he had 
galloped over far and wide, but in which he probably 
found nothing worthy of remark or of any other 
1 In official returns in Russia an i ndh·idual is referred to as 
' a  soul.' 
Thus, a town of ten thousand inhabitants is in the 
Russian census, a town of ten thousand souls. 
It is significant 
of the English temperament that the corresponding use of the 
word is chiefly coufined to those who go <I own to the sea in ships. 

PUSHKIN 
83 
attention save a blow of his fist or a kick with his 
patent-leather boot. 
All Russia was to him repre­
sented only by his superiors ; outside them every­
thing was almost unworthy to exist. 
How could 
such an one understand the people or their soul ? 
Though he was a Russian, he was a ' European ' 
Russian, who had begun to be European, not for 
enlightenment, but for debauchery, as many, very 
many, began. 
Yes, debauchery of this kind has 
more than once been held with us to be the surest 
way of remaking Russians into Europeans. 
The 
son of such a King's l\Iessenger will perhaps be a 
professor, that is a European by letters patent. 
So do not talk of those Gogol types understanding 
the essence of the people. 
A Pushkin, a Khomia­
kov, a Samarin, an Aksakov were needed before 
one could begin to speak of the real essence of 
the people. 
(It had been discussed hcforc them, 
indeed, but in a classical and theatrical way.) 
And when they began to speak of ' the national 
truth,' every one looked upon them as epileptics 
and idiots, whose ideal was ' to cat radishes and 
write secret informations.' 
Yes, informations ! 
Their appearance and their opinions so much 
astonished everybody at first that the Liberals 
began even to suspect, ' Surely they want to lay 
informations against us ? ' 
And tell me, please, 
how far mollcrn Liberals have advanced beyond 
this silly conception of the Slavophiles. 
But to get to business. 
You assert that Aleko 
ran to the Gipsies to get away from a Derzhimorda. 
Let us suppose that it is true. 
But the worst of all, 
l\1. Gradovsky, is that you yourself quite convinc­
ingly admit Aleko's right to all his aversion. 
' He 

84 
PUSHKIN 
could not help running away to the Gipsies, for a 
Derzhimorda was too disgusting.' 
And I assert 
that Aleko and Onyegin were also Derzhimordas in 
their way, and in certain respects even worse. 
The 
only difference is that I do not in the least blame 
them for it, for I know perfectly well the tragedy of 
their fate, while you praise them for running away. 
' Could such great and interesting men really live 
with those monsters ? ' 
You are profoundly mis­
taken. You conclude that Aleko and Onyegin did 
not tear themselves away from the soil at all, and 
did not at all deny ' the national truth.' 1\Ioreover, 
' They were not proud at all '-you go so far as to 
assert that. But pride is here the direct, logical and 
inevitable outcome of their abstraction and detach­
ment from the soil. You cannot deny that they did 
not know the soil ; they grew and were brought up 
like children in a convent school ; they got to know 
Russia in their office in Petersburg ; their relations 
with the people were those of a landlord with a serf. 
And suppose even that they had lived in the country 
with the peasants. 
l\Iy King's Messenger had 
mixed with post-boys all his life long, and he found 
in them only stuff for his clenched fist. 
Alcko and 
Onycgin were haughty and impatient with Russia, 
like all who live in a separate coterie apart from the 
people, with all fouml, who live, that is, on the 
labour of the peasants alHl on European enlighten­
ment which they also got for nothing. 
Indeed, the 
fact that all our intellectuals for almost the whole of 
two centuries of our history, as the result of a certain 
stage in their evolution, became merely idlers, 
explains their abstraction and detachment from 
their native soil. 
Aleko perished not because of 

PUSHKIN 
85 
Derzhimorda, but because of his inability to under­
stand Derzhimorda and his genesis. 
For that he 
was too proud. 
Since he was unable to under­
stand, he found it impossible to work in his native 
field. And he considered those who did believe in 
that possibility, as fools or as Derzhirnordas also. 
And not only with Derzhimorda was our wanderer 
proud, but with Russia as well, since his final con­
clusion was that Russia contained only serfs and 
Derzhimordas. 
If there were any nobler element in 
her, then it was they, the Alckos and Onyegins, and 
no one besides. After that, pride comes of itself : 
living in abstraction they naturally began to be 
amazed by their own nobility and their superiority 
over the disgusting Dcrzhimordas, in whom they 
could understand nothing at all. 
Had they not 
been proud, they would have seen that they also 
were Derzhimordas, and seeing this they might 
perhaps have found in that very vision a way of 
reconciliation. Towards the people they felt not 
pride so much as utter loathing. 
You will not believe all this. On the contrary, 
when you say that certain traits of the Alckos and 
Onyegins arc uncomely, you presumptuously begin 
to reprove me for the narrowness of my outlook, 
because ' it is hardly reasonable to cure the symp­
toms and neglect the cause of the disease.' 
You 
assert that when I say ' Humble thyself, proud 
man,' I am accusing Aleko for his personal qualities 
merely, and am leaving out of account the root of 
the matter, ' as if the whole point in question were 
the personal qualities of those who are proud and do 
not desire to humble themselves.' 
' The question is 
not settled,' you say, ' on what the wanderers did 

86 
PUSHKIN 
pride themselves ; and the other question is also 
unanswered-before what should they humble 
themselves ? ' 
This is all very presumptuous. I thought that I 
concluded in so many words that the ' wanderers ' 
arc a product of the historical evolution of our 
society. 
Therefore I do not throw all the blame on 
them alone personally and on their personal qualities. 
You have read it ; it is written and printed. 
Why 
then do you misrepresent me ? 
You quote the 
passage ' Humble thyself,' and write : 
' In these words l\1. Dostoevsky expressed the 
holy of holies among his convictions, that which is 
at once the strength and weakness of the author of 
The Brothers Karamazov. 
In these words is con­
tained a great religious ideal, a mighty charge to 
personal morality, but there is not even an allusion 
to social ideals.' 
After these words you instantly begin to criticise 
the ideal of ' personal perfection in the spirit of 
Christian love.' 
I will deal with your opinion of 
' personal perfection ' presently, but I will first turn 
inside out before your eyes all the lining of your soul 
which you apparently would like to hide. And that 
is : you arc angry with me not merely because I 
accuse the ' wanderer,' bnt because I do not acknow­
ledge him as the ideal of personal perfection, as a 
healthy Russian, which he alone could, and ought 
to, be I 
You admit that there are uncomely traits 
in Aleko and Onyegin, but you are only dodging. 
In your inner belief, which for some reason you do 
not wish to reveal fully, the ' wanderers ' arc normal 
and excellent, excellent by this alone that they ran 
away from the Dcrzhimordas. 
You look indig-

PUSHKIN 
87 
nant if any one ventures to detect even the 
slightest fault in them. You say immediately : ' It 
would be absurd to assert that they were destroyed 
by their pride, and they did not want to humble 
themselves before the national truth.' And finally 
you hotly assert and insist that it was they who 
liberated the serfs. You write : 
' I will say more : if in the soul of the best of these 
wanderers some great idea was preserved, then it 
was the care for the people ; their most burning 
hatred was directed against serfdom, which lay 
heavy on the people. 
Grant that they loved the 
people and hated serfdom in their own way, grant 
that it was a European way. 
But who else than 
they prepared our society for the abolition of 
serfdom ? 
In what they could they too served 
" the native field," first as the apostles of libera­
tion and then as arbiters of peace.' 
The point is that ' the wanderers ' hated serfdom 
in their own way, in ' the European way.' 
The 
whole value of the argument is there. 
It is that 
they hated serfdom not for the sake of the Russian 
peasant, who worked for them, and fed them, and 
was therefore oppressed by them no less than others. 
If their social sorrow had indeed so strong a hold 
on them that they had to run away to the Gipsies 
or the barricades in Paris, what prevented, what 
hindered them from purely and simply liberating 
their own peasants and giving them their land, and 
thus removing the social sorrow, in so far at least as 
they were themselves responsible ? But one heard 
too little of such liberations, and too much of social 
rhetoric. 
' Their environment ruined them ; more­
over: why should they lose their capital ? ' 
But 

88 
PUSHKIN 
why should they not lose it if they had come to such 
a pitch- that from sorrow for the peasants they had 
to run away to the barricades ? 
And that is the 
root of the matter. 
In the cosy corners of Paris a 
man still needs money, even though he stands sentry 
on a barricade, and the serfs had to forward their 
poll-taxes. 
Or ' the wanderers ' took a still simpler 
course : they mortgaged, sold or exchanged-isn't 
it all the same ?-their peasants, and when they had 
realised them, they went off to Paris to help in pub­
lishing French radical papers, and reviews for the 
salvation of all mankind, not merely of the Russian 
moujik. 
You assure me that they were devoured by 
sorrow for the serf ? 
Not by sorrow for the serf, 
but by an abstract sorrow for slavery in mankind : 
it must not be, it is uncivilised. Liberte, Egalite, 
Fraternite. 
And as for the Russian peasant person­
ally, perhaps sorrow for him did by no means inflict 
such terrible torments upon those great hearts. 
I 
know and remember many of the intimate opinions 
of very, very ' enlightened ' men of the good old 
days. 
' Undoubtedly slavery is a terrible evil,' 
they used to whisper intimately among themselves, 
' but if you take it all in all, is our people really­
a people ? 
Well, is it like the people of Paris in '03 ? 
It has grown accustomed to slavery ; it has the face 
and figure of a sla vc. 
Of course a cat-o' -nine-tails 
is an abominable thing, speaking generally, but for 
a Russian, by Jove, the cat 's still a necessity.' . . .  
' You must flog a Russian peasant. 
A Russian 
peasant would pine away if he wasn't flogged­
that 's the kind of nation it is.' That is what I have 
heard, I swear, in my time even from very enlightened 
men. 
That is ' the sober truth.' 
Perhaps Onyegin 

PUSHKIN 
89 
did not flog his domestics, though it 's really hard to 
say, but Aleko-well, I 'm sure that Aleko used to 
give them a flogging, not from cruelty of heart, but 
almost out of compassion, almost for a good pur­
pose. 
' He must have it. 
He can't live without a 
dose of flogging. 
He comes himself and asks : 
'' Give me a flogging, sir ; make a man of me. 
I 've 
been spoiled ! " 
Pray tell me what can be done 
with such u character. 
'V ell, I '11 satisfy him, and 
give him a flogging ! ' 
I repeat, their feeling towards the peasant at 
times reached nausea. 
And what a mass of con­
temptuous anecdotes about the Russian peasant 
circulated among them, contemptuous and obscene 
anecdotes about his slavish soul, his ' idolatry,' his 
priest, his wife-all these were retailed light­
heartedly, sometimes by men whose private life 
was fit for a brothel-oh, of course, not always 
because of an evil soul, but sometimes really only 
from excessive ardour to adopt the latest European 
ideas (a la Lucretia Floriana, for instance) which 
were understood and assimilated in our own way, 
with true Russian impetuosity. Russians had a 
hand in anything ! 
Russian sorrowing ' wanderers ' 
were at times great rogues, 1\I. Gradovsky, and those 
same little anecdotes about the Russian peasant, 
and their contemptuous obiter dicta about him, 
nearly always assuaged the poignancy of their 
hearts' social sorrow for serfdom, by giving to it an 
abstract and universal character. And with the 
abstract and universal kind of sorrow a man can 
easily live in comfort, feeding spiritually upon the 
contemplation of his own moral beauty and the 
elevation of his social thought, and physically-

90 
PUSHKIN 
well, still feeding, and feeding richly, on the rent 
from these same peasants ! 
Quite lately an old eye-witness who had observed 
those days told an anecdote in a review about a 
certain meeting of the foremost men of liberal and 
universal minds of that time with a peasant woman. 
Here we have gathered wanderers par excellence, 
wanderers by letters patent, as it were, who had 
proved their title in the matter of history. In the 
summer of 18·15 a crowd of guests arrived at an 
admirable country house near 1\Ioscow, where, in 
the words of an eye-witness, ' colossal dinners ' 
were given. 
The 
guests comprised the most 
humanitarian professors, the most amazing amateurs 
and connoisseurs of the fine arts and other things 
as well, the most renowned democrats, and finally 
famous political workers of world-wide importance, 
critics, writers, highly educated women. 
Suddenly 
the whole company, probably after a champagne 
dinner, with fish-pies and pigeon's milk-there must 
have been some reason why these dinners were 
called ' colossal '-set out for a walk in the fields. 
In a remote corner of the corn they meet a woman 
harvester. 
Heavy summer work in the fields during 
harvest-time : the peasants and their women-folk 
get up at four o'clock to get in the corn and work 
until night. 
It 's very hard to bend and reap for 
twelve solid hours ; the sun is burning. 
When a 
harvest woman gets into the corn she generally 
cannot be seen. 
And now, here in the corn, our 
company finds a harvest woman-imagine it, in ' a 
primitive costume ' (in her shirt !). It is terrible. 
The universal feelings of humaneness arc offended ; 
an indignant voice is instantly heard. 
' Only the 

PUSHKIN 
91 
Russian woman among all women has no sense of 
shame.' Of course, the inference is inevitable. 
' Only before a Russian woman is one ashamed of 
nothing.' 
A discussion began. 
Advocates of the 
Russian woman also appeared, but what advocates ! 
and with what objections they had to contend. 
And all kinds of opinions and conclusions could be 
heard among the crowd of wanderers-landlords 
who slaked their thirst with champagne, swallowed 
oysters-and who paid ? The woman with her 
labour ! 
It is for you, you universal sufferers, that 
she is working ; her labour paid for your feast. 
And because, while she was in the corn where she 
could not be seen, tormented by sun and sweat, she 
took off her skirt and worked in her shirt alone, she 
is shameless and has offended your sense of modesty 
-' she is of all women most shameless '-oh, you 
chaste gentlemen ! 
'What about your ' cosy corners 
in Paris ' and your pranks in ' the gay little city,' 
and those pleasant little cancans at the Bal l\Iabile, 
only to tell of which makes a Russian leap for joy, 
and that fascinating little chanson, 
:Ma commcre, quaml je danse 
Comment va mon cotillon ? 
with the charming upward flick of the skirt, and the 
twitch of the rump-this does not in the least offend 
our chaste Russian gentlemen ; on the contrary it 
delights them ! 
' By Jove, it 's so graceful, the 
cancan, the fascinating twitch-it's the most ex­
quisite article de Paris of its kind : but there you 
have a hag, a Russian hag, a block, a log ! '  And 
now it 's not even the conviction of the foulness of 
our peasant and our people any more, but it is a 

92 
PUSHKIN 
personal feeling of aversion to the peasant-oh, of 
course, an involuntary, almost unconscious aversion, 
which they themselves hardly even notice. 
But I 
confess I can by no means agree with your very 
fundamental proposition, 1\I. Gradovsky : 
' Who 
else but they prepared our society for the abolition 
of serfdom ? ' 
Perhaps they served the cause only 
with their abstract trivialities, while they shed their 
social sorrow according to all the rules. 
Oh, natur­
ally, it made part of the general economy and had 
its use. 
But the liberation of the peasants was 
furthered, and those who laboured for that liberation 
were helped, rather by men who followed Samarin's 
trend of ideas than by your wanderers. 1\Icn of the 
type, like Samarin,1 a type perfectly unlike the 
wanderers, appeared for the great work of that 
time : they were by no means few, M. Gradovsky, 
but of them, of course, you say not a single word. 
The wanderers, according to all the evidence, were 
very soon bored by the work of emancipation, and 
commenced to turn up their noses again. They 
would not have been wanderers had they acted 
otherwise. 
Upon the receipt of the compensation 
-the Government paid the landlords when it freed 
the serfs-they began to sell the rest of their lands 
and fore;>ts to merchants and speculators to be cut 
down and destroyed ; they emigrated, and intro­
duced absenteeism. . . . Of course, you won't 
agree with my opinion, Herr Professor, but what can 
I do ? 
I cannot possibly agree to accept the picture 
of your darling, the superior and liberal-minded 
Russian, as the ideal of the real and normal Russian, 
as he was, is now, and ever shall be. 
Little good 
I Samarin was a famous Sla\'ophile leadel'. 

PUSHKIN 
93 
work have these men done during the last decades 
in the national field. 
And there is more t!·uth in 
my statement than in your dithyrambs in honour of 
these gentlemen of the good old times. 
§ 3  
TWO . HALVES 
Now I come to your views on ' personal perfection 
in the spirit of Christian love ' and to what you call 
its insufficiency in comparison with ' social ideals,' 
and above all in comparison with ' political institu­
tions.' You yourself begin with the assertion that 
this is the most important point of disagreement 
between us. 
You write : 
' Now we have reached the most important point 
in our disagreement with l\I. Dostoevsky. 
\Vhilc 
he demands humiliation before the national truth 
and the national ideals, he assumes that that truth 
and those ideals arc something ready prepared, 
unshakable and eternal. \V c will allow ourselves 
to assure him of the contrary. The social ideals of 
our people are still in process of formation ancl 
development. 
The people has still much work to do 
upon itself, that it may be worthy of the name of a 
great people.' 
I have already partly replied to you concerning 
' the truth ' and national ideals at the beginning of 
this article, in the first section. 
You find that truth 
and those ideals quite insufficient for the develop­
ment of Russia's political ideals, as though you were 
to have said that religion is one thing and political 
work another. 'Vith your scientific knife you cut 
a whole, living organism into two separate halves 

94 
PUSH KIN 
and assert that these halves must be quite inde­
pendent of each other. J,et us look more closely, 
let us examine each of these two halves separately, 
and perhaps we shall come to some conclusion. 
Let us first investigate the half concerning ' per­
sonal perfection in the spirit of Christian love.' 
You write : 
' l\1. Dostoevsky calls to men to work upon them­
selves and to humble themselves. Personal self­
perfection in the spirit of Christian love is, of course, 
the first premiss of any activity, great or small ! 
But it does not follow that men who are personally 
perfected in the Christian sense will infallibly form a 
perfect society. 
I shall allow myself to put forward 
an instance. 
' Paul the Apostle instructs slaves and masters 
concerning their mutual relations. SlaYcs and 
masters alike could hearken, and usually did hearken 
to the word of the apostle. 
Personally they were 
good Christians ; but slavery was not sanctified 
thereby. 
It remained an immoral institution. 
In 
the same way, l\1. Dostoevsky, like all of us, has 
known splendid Christians, landlords and peasants 
alike. 
But serfdom remained an abomination in 
the sight of God, and the Tsar Liberator appeared as 
the spokesman of the demands not merely of per­
sonal but of social morality as well, of which social 
morality there was no right conception in the olden 
time, although perhaps there "·ere then as many 
good people as there are now. 
' Personal and social morality are not one and the 
same. Whence it follows that no social perfection 
can be attained solely through the improvement of 
the personal qualities of those who form the society. 

PUSHKIN 
95 
Let us take another example. Suppose that, 
beginning from the year 1800, a whole series of 
preachers of Christian love and humility had begun 
to improve the morality of the Korobochkas and 
the Sobakicvichcs. 
Can it he supposed that they 
would have achieved the abolition of serfdom, so 
that the word of authority would not have been 
necessary for the removal of that phenomenon ? 
On the contrary, a Korobochka would have begun 
to demonstrate that she was a true Christian and a 
genuine " mother " of her peasants, and she would 
have remained in this conviction in spite of all the 
arguments of the preachers. 
' The improvement of the people in the social 
sense cannot be effected by work " upon oneself " 
alone and by " humbling oneself." 
To work upon 
oneself and to subdue one's own passions-this can 
be done even in the wilderness or upon a desert 
island. 
llut as social beings, people develop nnd 
improve by work beside one another, for one anotltl'r 
and with one another. 
That is why the social perfec­
tion of a people very greatly depends upon the 
degree of perfection of their political institutions, 
which educate in man the civic, if not the Christian 
virtues . . .  . ' 
You see how much of you I have copied out I 
It 
is all very high and mighty, and ' personal perfection 
in the spirit of Christian love ' gets much the worst 
of it. 
It appears that in civic affairs it is good for 
nothing, or almost so. You have a strange way of 
understanding Christianity. Only imagine that 
Korobochka and Sobakievich should become real 
Christians, already perfect-you yourself speak of 
perfection-can they be persuaded to renounce 

96 
PUSHKIN 
serfdom ? 
That is the artful question which you 
ask, and, of course, reply : 
' No, it 's quite impos­
sible to persuade Korobochka, even if she were to 
become a perfect Christian.' 
To this I will reply 
immediately, that if only Korobochka could become, 
and became, a genuine, perfect Christian, then 
serfdom would no longer exist on her estate at all, 
so that there would be no need to trouble, notwith­
standing that the title deeds and conveyances re­
mained in her strong-box as before. 
But Koro­
bochka was a Christian before and was born a 
Christian ! 
So that when you speak of the r.ew 
preachers of Christianity you understand by the 
word something which is in essence the same as the 
old Christianity, but in a strengthened, perfect form, 
as it were having reached its ideal ? 
'Veil, how 
could there be slaves and masters then ? 
But one must have some small understanding of 
Christianity ! 
What would it matter to Koro­
bochka, already a perfect Christian, whether her 
peasants were serfs or not ? 
She is ' a mother ' to 
them, a genuine mother, and the ' mother ' would 
instantly abolish the ' lady ' that was. 
That would 
come of itself. 
The lady and the slave that were 
would dissolve away like mist before the sun, and 
quite new people would appear, in quite new rela­
tions with one another, relations that had never been 
hca['(l of before. And an unheard-of thing would 
be accomplished. 
Evcry;_chere would appear perfect 
Christians, who, when they "·ere scattered indivi­
duals, were so few that no one was sensible of their 
presence. You made that fantastic supposition 
yourself, 1\i. Gradovsky ; you yourself opened the 
door upon that wonderful fantasy, and since you 

PUSHKIN 
97 
opened the door, then you must take the conse­
quences. 
I assure you, l\1. Gradovsky, that Koro­
bochka's peasants would themselves refuse to leave 
her, for the simple reason that every man seeks 
what is better for himself. 
\'Vould it be better for 
them among your institutions than with the 
mother-lady who loved them ? 
I also venture to 
assure you that if slavery existed in the days of 
Paul the Apostle, it was only because the churches 
which had sprung up in those days were as yet im­
perfect-which we can also see from the epistles of 
the Apostle. And those members of the churches 
who had then attained to personal perfection, no 
longer had nor could have slaves because the slaves 
turned brothers, and a brother who is a true brother 
cannot have his brother as a slave. According to 
you, it follows somehow that the preaching of 
Christianity was impotent. 
At all events, you write that slavery was not 
sanctified by the Apostle's preaching. 
But other 
learned men, particularly European historians as a 
whole, have rebuked Christianity because, as they 
say, it sanctifies slavery. 
Which means that they 
fail to understand the essence of the matter. 
Is it 
possible even to imagine that l\Iary of Egypt could 
have serfs and yet not want to set them free ! 
What absurdity ! 
In Christianity, in true Chris­
tianity, there are and there will ever be, masters and 
servants, but a slave can never be even conceived. 
I speak of a true and perfect Christianity. Servants 
are not slaves. 
The pupil Timothy served Paul 
when they journeyed together ; but read Paul's 
epistle to Timothy. Is it written to a slave, to a 
servant even ? 
He is in truth his ' child Timothy,' 

98 
PUSHKIN 
his beloved son. These, these are indeed the re­
lations that will be between master and servant, if 
master and servant became perfect Christians ! 
Servants and masters there will be, but masters will 
be no longer lords nor servants slaves. 
Imagine 
that there will be a Kepler, a Kant, and a Shake­
speare in the society of the future. They are work­
ing at a great work for all men, and all men acknow­
ledge it and respect them. 
But Shakespeare has no 
time to tear himself away from his work to tidy his 
room, to clean up everything. 
Be sure another 
citizen will infallibly come to wait upon him, of his 
own desire. 
He will come of his own free will and 
tidy up Shakespeare's room. 
Will he be thereby 
degraded ? 
Will be be a slave ? 
By no means. 
He knows that Shakespeare is infinitely more useful 
than himself. 
' Honour and glory to thee,' he will 
say, ' and I am glad to serve thee. 
Thereby I wish 
to do though it be only a little service to the common 
good, for thus I will save thy time for thy great 
work, but I am not a slave. 
Indeed, by confessing 
that thou, Shakespeare, are higher than myself by 
thy genius, and coming to serve thee, by this my 
admission I have. proved that in the moral dignity 
I am not in the least below thee, and as a man, I am 
thy equal.' 
But he will not even say that then, 
for the simple reason that such questions then '"ill 
not arise ; they will not be even thinkable. For 
verily all men will be new men, the children of 
Christ, and the beast of old will be conquered. You 
will, of course, say that this is another dream. 
But 
it was not I who was the first to dream, but you : 
it was you who imagined a Korobochka, already a 
1mfect Christian, holding ' children serfs ' whom 

PUSHKIN 
9!) 
she will not set free. This a worse dream than 
mine. 
Here the clever people will laugh and say : ' After 
that, it 's all very well to worry about self-perfection 
in the spirit of Christian love, when there is no real 
Christianity at all on the earth, or so little of it that 
it is hard to see, because otherwise everything would 
be right in an instant, all slavery would be abolished, 
every Korobochka would be regenerated into a 
shining genius, and one thing alone would be left for 
all to do-to sing a hymn to God.' 
Yes, of course, 
you sneering gentlemen, real Christians are still 
terribly few (though they do exist). 
But how do 
you know how many indeed are wanted that the 
ideal of Christianity should not perish from the 
people, and the people's great hope perish with it ? 
Apply the thought to secular conceptions. How 
many real citizens are wanted that civic virtue 
should not perish from society ? And this you will 
not answer. Here is a strange political economy, 
one of a quite diffel'ent kind and wholly unknown to 
you, even to you, l\I. Gradovsky, wholly unknown. 
It will be said again : ' If there are so few confessors 
of the great idea, what is the good of it ? 
And how 
do you know to what advantage it will lead in the 
end ? 
Hitherto it was evidently necessary that the 
great idea should not perish. It is 
a different 
matter now when a new thing is descending every­
where upon the world and every man should be 
prepared for it. . . . 
And here the point is not one of advantage at all, 
but of truth. 
If I believe that the truth is here, 
here exactly in what I believe, then what do I care 
if even the whole world should refuse my truth, 

100 
PUSHKIN 
mock at me and go its way ? 
In this indeed is the 
strength of a great moral idea, that it unites people 
into the strongest union, that it is not measured by 
immediate advantage, but it guides the future of 
men towards eternal aims and absolute joy. 'Vhere­
with will you unite men for the attainment of your 
civic aims if you have no foundation of a primary, 
great moral idea ? Moral ideas are all of one kind : 
all of them arc based upon the idea of absolute 
personal self-perfection in the future, in the ideal, 
since self-perfection bears in it all things, all aspira­
tions, all yearnings, and from it therefore spring all 
our civic ideals also. Try to unite people into a 
civic society with the one sole aim of ' saving their 
little lives.' Yon will achieve nothing but the 
moral formula : Chacun pour soi et Dieu pour tous. 
By that formula no civic institution will live long, 
M. Gradovsky. 
But I will go further ; I intend to surprise you. 
Know, learned professor, that social and civic ideals, 
as such, in so far as they arc not organically con­
nected with moral ideals, but exist by themselves 
like a separate half cut off from the whole by your 
learned knife ; in so far, finally, as they may be 
taken from the outside and successfully transplanted 
to any other place, in so far as they are a separate 
' institution ' -such ideals, I say, neither have nor 
have had nor ever could have any existence at all ! 
For what is a social ideal and how shall we under­
stand the word ? 
Surely its essence lies in men's 
aspiration to find a formula of political organisation 
for themselves, a possible organisation which shall 
be faultless and satisfactory to all-is it not so ? 

PUSHKIN 
101 
But people do not know the formula. Though they 
have been searching for it through the six thousand 
years of history, they cannot find it. The ant knows 
the formula of the ant-hill, the bee of the hive­
though they do not know it after the manner of 
human knowledge, they know it in their own way 
and desire nothing beyond-but man does not know 
his formula. If this be so, whence could the ideal of 
civic organisation appear in human society ? 
Ex­
amine the question historically and you will im­
mediately see whence it comes. You will see that is 
nothing else than the product of the moral self­
perfection of the individual units. 
Thence it takes 
its rise, and it has been so from time immemorial 
and it will be so for ever and ever. 
In the origin of 
any people or any nation, the moral idea has always 
preceded the birth of the nation, because it was the 
moral idea which created the nation. 
This moral 
idea always issued forth from mystical ideas, from 
the conviction that man is eternal, that he is more 
than an earth-born animal, that he is united to other 
worlds and to eternity. Those convictions have 
always and everywhere been formulated into a 
religion, into a confession of a new idea, and always 
so soon as a new religion began, a new nationality 
was also created immediately. Consider the Jews 
and the l\Ioslcms. 
The Jewish nationality was 
formed only after the law of 1\Ioscs, though it began 
with the law of Abraham, and the l\Ioslcm nation­
alities appeared only after the Koran. 
In order to 
preserve the spiritual treasures they had received 
men instantly began to draw towards each other, 
and only then, jealously and avidly, working ' beside 
one another, for one another, and with one another,' 

102 
PUSHKIN 
as you so eloquently express it, only then did men 
begin to seek how they should organise themselves 
so as to preserve without loss the treasures they had 
received, how they should find a civic formula of 
common life that would really help them to exhibit 
in its full glory to the whole world the moral treasure 
which they had received. 
And observe that so soon as the spiritual ideal­
after times and centuries had passed-had begun to 
be shaken and weakened in a particular nationality, 
the nationality itself also began to decline, and at 
the same time her civic organisation began to fall 
and all the civic ideals which had formed in her 
began to be obscured. According to the mould in 
'vhich a nation's religion was being cast, the social 
forms of the people were also engendered and for­
mulated. Therefore civic ideals are always directly 
and organically connected with moral ideas, and 
generally the former are created by the latter alone. 
They never appear of themselves, for when they 
appear they have one aim alone, the satisfaction of 
the moral aspirations of the particular people to the 
exact degree to which those moral aspirations are 
being formed. 
Therefore ' self-perfection in the 
spirit of religion ' in the life of nations is the founda­
tion of everything, since self-perfection is the con­
fession of the religion which they have received, and 
' civic ideals ' never appear nor can they be en­
gendered without the aspiration to self-perfection. 
You will perhaps reply that you yourself said that 
' personal self-perfection is the beginning of every-
. thing ' and that you severed nothing at all with your 
knife. But this is the very thing that you severed ; 
you cut the living organism into two halves. 
Self-

PUSHKIN 
108 
perfection is not only ' the beginning of everything,' 
it is the continuation and the issue as well. It, and 
it alone, includes, creates and preserves the organism 
of nationality. 
For its sake does the civic formula 
of a nation live, since it was created only in order to 
preserve it as the treasure primarily received. 
But 
when a nationality begins to lose the desire within 
itself for a common self-perfection of its individuals 
in the spirit which gave it birth, then all the ' civic 
institutions ' gradually perish, because there is 
nothing left to be preserved. 
Thus it is quite im­
possible to say what you say in the following phrase : 
' That is why the social perfection of a people very 
greatly depends upon the degree of perfection of 
their political institutions, which educate in man 
the civic, if not the Christian virtues.' 
' The civic, if not the Christian virtues ' ! 
Can 
you not see here the learned knife which divides the 
indivisible, which cuts the whole and living organism 
into two separate, dead halves, the moral and the 
civic ? You will say that the most lofty moral idea 
may be contained in ' political institutions ' and the 
title of ' citizen,' that in mature and developed 
nations the ' civic idea ' always takes the place of 
the original religious idea, which degenerates into 
the former, and to which the civic idea succeeds by 
right. Yes, there are many who assert this thing ; 
but we have not yet seen this dream in realisation. 
When the moral and religious idea of a nationality 
is spent, there is always revealed a panic and 
cowardly desire for a union, whose sole purpose is 
' to save men's bellies '-there are no other purposes 
left for a civic union. 
At the present moment the 
French bourgeoisie is actually uniting itself with this 

104 
PUSHKIN 
purpose ' of saving their bellies ' from the fourth 
estate which is already battering at its doors. 
But 
' the saving of bellies ' is the last and most im­
potent idea of all those which unite mankind. 
This 
is already the beginning of the end, the omen of 
annihilation. 
They are uniting themselves and 
keeping a sharp eye open for the first moment of 
danger when they will scatter like lightning. And 
what can save ' the institution ' as such, taken by 
itself ? 
If these are brothers, there will be brother­
hood. 
If there are no brothers, you will not achieve 
brotherhood by any ' institution.' What is the 
sense of erecting an ' institution ' and carving upon 
it Liberte, Egalite, Fratendte ? 
You will get no 
good from an ' institution ' and you will be driven, 
necessarily and infallibly you will be driven, to add 
to the three constituant words the fourth also : ou la 
mort. Fratemite ou la mort : and brother will begin 
to chop ofJ' the head of brother in order to attain 
brotherhood by means of a '  civic institution.' This 
is only an example, but it is a good one. 
You, 1\f. Gradovsky, like Alcko, look for salvation 
in things and in external phenomena. 
Grant that 
we have fools aud rogues in Russia. 
'Ve have only 
to transplant some institution from Europe and­
according to you-' everything will be saved.' 
The 
mechanical transportation of European forms into 
Russia (which will be shattered in Europe to­
morrow), which are foreign to our people and con­
tt·ary to the popular will, is we know well the all­
important word of Russian Europeanism. 
And by 
the way, l\I. Gradovsky, when you censure our lack 
of organisation, blaming Russia and pointing to 
Europe with admiration, you say : 

PUSHKIN 
105 
' And in the meanwhile we cannot get rid of the 
inconsistencies and contradictions of which Europe 
got rid long ago.' 
Has Europe got rid of them ? 
Where did you 
learn this ? 
She is on the eve of ruin, your Europe, 
of a general, universal and terrible catastrophe. 
The ant-hill which has long been in course of forma­
tion within her, without a Church and without Christ 
(for the Church, having muddied her ideal, was long 
ago embodied in the State}, with a moral principle 
shattered ta its foundations, having lost all that it 
had of universal and of absolute,-that ant-hill, I 
say, is wholly undermined. 
The fourth estate is 
coming ; it knocks and batters at the door, and if 
the door be not opened, it will be broken down. 
The fourth estate docs not want the ideals of old ; 
it denounces all that has been up till now. It will 
not make little compromises, little concessions ; 
you "·ill not save the building by little supports. 
Something will come which none imagine. All 
these parliamentarisms, all the social theories nowa­
days professed, banks, science, Jews-all will be 
annihilated in a single instant and leave no trace, 
except perhaps the Jews, who will even then devise a 
method of action by which the work of destruction 
may be profitable to them. 
All these things are 
ncar, ' at the gate.' 
You laugh ? 
Blessed arc they 
that laugh. 
God grant you years that you may 
yourself behold it. 
You will be surprised in that 
day. 
You will laugh and say : ' How well you love 
Europe if you prophesy this of her ! ' 
Am I glad ? 
I have only the feeling that the reckoning is made. 
The final account, the payment of the bill, may come 
to pass much sooner than the quickest imagination 

106 
PUSH KIN 
can conceive. The symptoms are terrible. Alone, 
the inveterately unnatural political situation of the 
powers of Europe may serve for a beginning to any­
thing ! 
How could they be natural, if their forma­
tion was unnatural and the abnormality has accumu­
lated for centuries ? 
One small portion of mankind 
shall not possess the rest as a slave ; 
yet it was 
solely for this purpose that all the civic institutions 
of Europe (long since un-Christian, which are now 
perfectly pagan) have hitherto been formed. This 
unnaturalness and these ' insoluble ' political ques­
tions (which are, by the way, familiar to everybody) 
must infallibly lead to one huge, final, disintegrating, 
political war, in which all Powers will have a share, 
and which will break out in our century, perhaps 
even in the coming decade. And do you think that 
society now can endure a long political war ? 
The 
capitalists are cowardly and timorous, the Jews also; 
all the factories and banks will be closed as soon as 
the war begins to be protracted or threatens to be a 
long one, and millions of hungry mouths, of miser­
able proletarians, will be thrown into the street. 
Do you rely upon the wisdom of statesmen and upon 
their refusal to undertake a war ? 
"Then was it 
possible to place any reliance upon that wisdom ? 
Do you put your trust in Parliaments, and believe 
that they will foresee the results and refuse the m,oney 
for the war ? 
But when have Parliaments foreseen 
results and refused money to the slightest insistence 
of a man in power ? 
But the proletarian is in the 
street. 
Do you think he will wait and starve in 
patience as he used ? Mter he has tasted political 
socialism, after the International, after the Socialist 
Congresses and the Paris Commune ? 
No, it will 

PUSHKIN 
107 
not now be as it used to be. They will hurl them­
selves upon Europe and all the old things will 
crumble for ever. 
The waves ,,.ill be broken by our 
shore alone, since only then will it he palpably and 
evidently revealed how greatly different is our 
national organism from the European. 
Then, even 
you, messieu1's les dvct1'inaires, will perhaps bethink 
yourselves and begin to search in our people for 
' national principles ' at which you only laugh now. 
And now, gentlemen, now you point us to Europe 
and appeal to us to transplant those very institutions 
which will crumble there to-morrow, as absurdities 
which have had their day anrl in which a great 
many clever people even there no longer believe, 
which maintain themselves and exist only by the 
force of inertia. "rho but an abstract rloctrinaire 
could seriously take the comedy of the union of the 
bourgeoisie, which we see in Europe, as the normal 
formula of the union of men upon the earth ? 
"\Ve 
arc told that they got rid of contradictions long ago 
-and this after twenty constitutions in less than a 
century, and after well-nigh a dozen revolutions ? 
Oh, perhaps, it will only be then that we shall be 
freed for a while from Europe, and ourselves engage, 
without European tutelage, in the pursuit of our 
own social ideals \Yhich inevitably spring from 
Christ and personal self-perfection, l\f. Gradovsky. 
You. will ask : ' What social and political ideals 
of our own can we have to save Europe ? '  'Yhy, 
social ideals better than the European, stronger than 
the European, stronger than yours and even-oh, 
horror-more liberal than yours ! Yes, more liberal 
because they spring directly from the organism of 
our people and are not a servile and bloodless im-

108 
PUSH KIN 
portation from the \Vest. 
I cannot of course say 
much upon this subject, if only because this paper is 
already too long. 
But in this connection, remember 
what was the ancient Christian Church and what it 
aspires to be. 
It began immediately after the death 
of Christ, with a handful of people, and instantly, 
almost in the very first days after the death of 
Christ, it attempted to discover its ' civic formula,' 
which was wholly based upon the moral expectation 
of satisfying the spirit by the principles of personal 
self- perfection. 
Then arose the Christian com­
munities-Churches ; then speedily began to be 
created a new and hitherto unheard-of nationality, 
a nationality of universal brotherhood and humanity, 
in the shape of the catholic ceeumenical Church. 
But the Church was persecuted, and the ideal grew 
beneath the earth, and above it, on the face of the 
earth, an immense building was also being formed, 
a huge ant-hill, the old Roman empire, which was 
also the ideal and the outcome of the moral aspira­
tions of the whole ancient "·orld. 
But the ant-hill 
did not fortify itself ; it was undermined by the 
Church. Then occurred the collision of the two 
most opposite ideas that could exist in the world. 
The 1\Ian-God met the God-1\Ian, the Apollo Bel­
vedere met the Christ. 
A compromise arose : the 
Empire accepted Christianity, and the Church ac­
cepted Roman law and the Homan state. 
A small 
part of the Church went into the desert and began to 
continue its former work. 
Christian communities 
once more appeared, then monasteries ; and there 
were only attempts, attempts that have lasted even 
unto our day. 
The large remaining part of the 
Church was subsequently divided, it is well known, 

PUSH KIN 
109 
into two hnlves. 
In the Western half the State 
ultimately completely overcame the Church. 
The 
Church was destroyed and finally transformed into 
the State. 
The Papacy appeared-the continuation 
of the ancient Roman Empire in a new incarnation. 
In the Eastern half the State was subdued and 
destroyed hy the sword of Mahomet, and there 
remained Christ alone, already separated from the 
Church. 
And the State, which had accepted and 
exalted Christ anew, suffered such terrible and un­
ending sufferings at the hands of its enemies, from 
the Tartar kingdoms, from disorganisation, from 
serfdom, from Europe and Europeanism, and endures 
so much until this day, that a real social formula in 
the sense of the spirit of love and Christian self­
perfection has not yet been evolved in it. You, 
l\1. Gradovsky, mercilessly reproach Russia with 
her disorganisation. But who was it that hindered 
her from organising herself well during the whole of 
the last two centuries and especially during the last 
fifty years ? 
Just such people as yourself, l\1. 
Gradovsky, Russian Europeans who were always 
with us for the two centuries and now have settled 
upon us particularly. 
Who is the enemy ofHussia's 
organic and independent development upon her 
own national principles ? 
'Vho sneers and will not 
admit even the existence of those principles and does 
not even want to see them ? 
'Vho wanted to re­
make our people, by fantastically ' raising them up 
to himself '-simply in order to manufacture little 
Europeans, like themselves, by occasionally break­
ing off from the mass of the people a single indivi­
dual and corrupting him into a European, if only by 
virtue of the revers of his uniform ? 
By that I do 

ድ10 
PUSHKIN 
not mean that a European is corrupt ; I say only 
that to remake a Russian into a European in the 
way in which the Liberals do, is often real corrup­
tion. 
Yet in this lies the whole ideal of their pro­
gramme of activity, in just paring off single indivi­
duals from the general mnss. 
What absurdity ! 
Did they really want to tear off and remake in 
exactly this way all the eighty millions of our 
people ? 
Do you seriously believe that all our 
people, as a whole, in its great mass, will consent to 
become such an impersonality as these gentlemen, 
these Hussian Europeans ? 
§ 4 
TO ONE-HUMBLE THYSELF, 
AND TO AXOTHER-BE 
PROUD. 
A 
STORl\1 
IN 
A 
TEA-CUP 
HITHERTO I have only been debating with you, l\'1. 
Gradovsky ; but now I wish to accuse you for your 
deliberate distortion of my thought, of the chief 
point of my ' Speech.' 
You write : 
' There is still too much untruth, the residue of 
long years of slavery, in our people, for it to demand 
worship for itself, and to pretend, moreover, to the 
task of converting all Europe to the true path, a'l 
l\L Dostoevsky predicts. . 
. 
. 
' A  strange phenomenon ! The man who punishes 
pride in the persons of individual wanderers invites 
a whole people to be proud, because he sees in them 
a universal apostle. To the one he says, " Humble 
thyself ! " ; to the other he says, " Exalt thyself ! " ' 
And further : 
• Not yet having become a nation, suddenly to 

PUSHKIN 
111 
dream of a universal role ! 
Is it not too early ? 
1\1. Dostoevsky is proud of the fact that we have 
serverl Europe for two hundred years. 
'Ve must 
confess that the thought of this " service " excites no 
feelings of pleasure in us. 
Can the time of the Con­
gress of Vienna and the age of Congresses in general 
be an object of pride to us ? 
Is it by chance the 
time when we, serving 1\Ietternich, suppressed the 
national movement in Italy and Germany and 
lookerl askance even at our co-religionists, the 
Greeks ? 
What undying hatred we have gained in 
Europe for that very " service " ! ' 
First, I will dwell for a moment on this last, 
almost innocent, little misrepresentation. Did I, 
when I said that ' we had served Europe during the 
last two hundred years perhaps even more than we 
served ourselves,'-did I praise the manner of our 
service ? 
I only wanted to point to the fact of our 
service, and the fact is true. 
But the fact of our 
service and the manner of our service are two 
utterly different things. 
We may have made many 
political blunders, as the Europeans make them 
every day, but it was not our blunders which I 
praised. I only pointed to the fact of our almost 
always disinterested service. Do you really not 
understand that these are two different things ? 
' 1\1. Dostoevsky is proud because we served 
Europe,' yon say. 
I was not priding myself at all 
when I said that. 
I was ouly pointing out a char­
acteristic of our national spirit, a very significant 
characteristic. 
Does it mean that one is proud if he 
should find an admirable and healthy characteristic 
in the national spirit ? 
And why do you talk of 
l\Iettcrnich and the Congresses ? 
Are you going to 

112 
PUSHKIN 
give me instruction in history ? 
When you were 
still a student I spoke of our service to Metternich in 
language much stronger than yours, and for my 
words concerning our ill-omened service to 1\Ietter­
nich (among other words, of course)-! paid, as you 
know now, thirty years ago. \Vhy did you distort 
my words ? 
To show everybody : ' See what n 
Liberal I am, and now listen to the poet, the en­
thusiastic lover of the people, and hear what reaction 
he is babbling, priding himself on our service to 
Metternich I '  That is conceit, l\:L Gradovsky. 
This is of course a trifle, but what follows is no 
trifle at all. 
So, to say to the people, ' Exalt thy spirit ! ' is 
the same as to say ' Be proud ! ' ; is the same as 
inciting to pride, as teaching pride. 
Imagine, l\1. 
Gradovsky, that you should say to your own 
children : ' l\Iy children, exalt your spirit, be nol?le ! '  
-does it indeed mean that you teach them pride, or 
that you, in teaching them, are proud ? 
And what 
did I say ? 
I spoke of the hope of ' at the last 
becoming brothers of all men,' begging that my 
hearers should underline the words ' at the last.' 
Is the bright hope that some day brotherhood will 
be realised in our suffering world, and that ""e may 
be allowed to become brothers of all men-is that hope 
pride, and an incitement to pride ? But I said 
directly, in so many words, at the conclusion of 
my ' Speech ' :  
' Do I speak of economic glory, of the glory of 
the sword or of science ? 
I speak only of the 
brotherhood of man ; I say that to this uni,'ersal 
omni-human union the heart of Russia, perhaps 
more than all other nations, is predeዦtincd.' 

PUSHKIN 
113 
These were my words. And do they contain an 
incitement to pride ? 
Immediately after the words 
I have quoted from my ' Speech ' I added : 
' Let our country be poor, but this poor land 
" Christ traversed with blessing in the guise of a 
serf." 
"Why then should we not contain his final 
word ? '  
Does this word of Christ imply an incitement to 
pride ; and is the hope of containing this word, 
pride ? You write indignantly : ' It is too early for 
us to demand worship for ourselves.' 
But where, 
pray, is the demand for worship ? 
Is it the desire 
for universal service, the desire to become servants 
and brothers of all men and to serve them with love 
-does that mean to demand worship from all ? If 
there be here any demand for worship, then the 
sacred, disinterested desire for universal service 
instantly becomes an absurdity. 
One does not bow 
down to servants, ancl a brother docs not want his 
brother to kneel before him. 
Imagine to yourself, l\1. Cradovsky, that you 
have done or are about to do a good deed, and on 
your way in the elation of your good feelings yon 
think to yourself : 
' How glad the poor fellow will 
Le at the unexpected help I am bringing him ; how 
his spirits will be raised, how he will revive, how 
he 'll tell of his good fortune to his friends and his 
children, how he 'll weep with them . . .  .' 
As you 
think all this to yourself, you will naturally have a 
feeling of elation, and sometimes tears will even 
come to your eyes-have you really never ex­
perienced that ?-and then comes a clever voice 
beside you, whispering into your car : ' You arc 
being proud of yourself, thinking nil this to yourself.

You are weeping tears of pride.' 
But now, the 
mere hope that we Russians may have some small 
significance for mankind, and that we may ulti­
mately be worthy of doing it brotherly service­
this mere hope roused enthusiasm, and enthusiastic 
tears, in the thousands who listened to me. 
I do 
not recall this for boasting's sake, or for pride ; I 
only wish to mark the seriousness of the moment. 
There was given only the bright hope that we too 
may be something for mankind if only as brothers to 
other men, and that passionate hint alone sufficed to 
unite all in one thought and one feeling. 
Strangers 
embraced and vowed to be better men. 
Two old 
men came up to me and said, ' For twenty years 
we were enemies and did each other wrong. 
Your 
words have reconciled us.' 
A certain newspaper 
made haste to remark that all this enthusiasm 
meant nothing. 
The mood was already there, and 
it was idle for the orators to speak and make 
perorations. 
\Vhatever they said the enthusiasm 
would be the same, for the benign mood was pre­
valent in Moscow. 
The journalist should himself 
have come to Moscow and have made a speech. 
\Voulcl men rush to hear him, as they rushed to me, 
or not ? Why was it that when speeches were made 
three days before, great ovations were given to the 
speakers, but to none of them happened what 
happened to me ? That was the only moment in 
the Pushkin celebrations, and it was not repeated. 
God is my witness that I tell this not to my own 
pt·aise. 
But the moment was too serious to be 
passed by in silence. Its seriousness consisted 
exactly in that new elements in society were brightly 
and clearly revealed ; there appeared new men who

long for heroic action, for the consolation of an idea, 
for a labour of devotion. 
It meant that society is 
no longer ready to be satisfied with our liberal 
sniggering at Russia. It meant that the doctrine of 
Russia's perpetual impotence already stinks in the 
nostrils. 
Only a hope, only a hint, and men's 
hearts were kindled by the sacred longing for an 
omni-human task, for a service and an action of 
universal brotherhood. ·were those tears the tears 
of pride ? 
Was that an incitement to pride ? 
Ah, 
you ! 
You see, M. Gradovsky, the seriousness of the 
moment suddenly terrified a great many people in 
our liberal tea-cup, the more so, seeing it was so 
unexpected. 
' What ! Hitherto we sniggered at 
and bespattered everything -- so pleasantly and 
profitably-and then comes this speech. . . . 
But 
it 's a riot. . . . 
Call the police ! ' 
Several 
frightened gentlemen sprang up : 
' What will 
happen to us now ? 'Ve used to write, too . . . 
what are we to do now ? 
'Ve must smother all 
this as quickly as we can, so that not a trace shall 
be left, and we must instantly proclaim to the four 
corners of Russia that it was only due to a hcnign 
mood that happened to he prevalent in hospita blc 
Moscow, a pleasant little moment after a series of 
dinners, no more than that-and as for the riot, 
well, we 'll have the police in ! ' 
And they have begun. They say I am a coward 
and a poet, and a mere nobody. 
1\iy speech is quite 
valueless. 
In a word, in the heat of their passion 
they have even acted imprudently. 
The public 
might not believe them. The thing ought to be 
done skilfully. 
It should be taken in colder hlood.

Something in my ' Speech' ought even to be praised. 
' Stil1,' they should say, ' there is a sequence of ideas 
in his " Speech,'' ' and then little by little they should 
spit on it all, and smother it to the general satisfac­
tion. 
In brief, they have not been so very clever. 
There was a blank space : it had to be filled quickly, 
and then and there appeared a solid, serious critic 
who combines a recklessness in attack with the 
proper blend of comme il faut. 
You were that critic, 
l\1. Gradovsky. 
You wrote : every one read : and 
al1 was quiet. 
You have at least served a common 
and an admirable cause. 
You were reprinted 
everywhere : 
' The poet's speech wil1 not bear 
serious criticism. 
Poets are poets, but wise men 
are on their guard and at the appointed time will 
always pour cold water on the dreamer.' 
At the 
very end of your article you ask me to forgive such 
expressions as I may consider hard in your article. 
As I finish my article, I will not offer you an apology 
for my sharp expressions, l\1. Gradovsky, if there are 
any in my article. 
I am not speaking personally to 
A. D. Gradovsky, but to the publicist A. Gradovsky. 
PersonaHy I have not the least reason for not 
respecting you. 
But if I do not respect your 
opinions, and insist upon it, how can I smooth 
matters by apologising ? 
It gave me pain to see 
that a very serious and critical moment in the life of 
our society was misrepresented and wrongly ex­
plained. 
It gave me pain to see the idea which I 
serve dragged about the street. 
It was you who 
dragged it there. 
I know, and every one will tell me, that it was not 
worth while, that it was ridiculous to ·write this long 
an<;wcr to your article, whieh wns rather short com-

pared with mine. 
lut I repeat, your article served 
only as a pretext : 
I wished to say some things 
generally. 
I am going to begin 1'he Journal of an 
Author again next ycar.1 
Let the present number 
serve as a profession of faith for the future, a 
specimen copy, so to say. 
It may perhaps still be said that by my answer I 
have destroyed the whole sense of the ' Speech ' 
which I delivered in Moscow, wherein I myself 
called upon both Russian parties to be united and 
reconciled, and admitted the justification of them 
both. 
No, no, no ! 
The sense of my ' Speech ' is 
not destroyed; 
on the contrary, it is made still 
stronger, since in my answer to you I point out that 
both parties, estranged one from the other, in 
hostility one to the other, have put themselves and 
their activity into an abnormal situation, whereas 
in mutual union and agreement, they would perhaps 
exalt everything, save everything, awaken endless 
powers and summon Russia to a new, healthy, and 
mighty life, hitherto unseen.
