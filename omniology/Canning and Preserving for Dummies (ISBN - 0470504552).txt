Conventions Used in This Book
The recipes in this book include preparation times, cooking times, processing 
times, and the yield you should expect from your efforts. Here are some 
details that apply to all of the recipes but aren’t repeated each time:
 
✓ Use a vinegar with 5 percent acidity.
 
✓ Use pure salt with no additives. (Canning or pickling salt is best.)
 
✓ Cook all food in heavy-bottomed pots and pans.
 
✓ Use nonreactive equipment and utensils (items made from glass, 
stainless steel, or enamel-coated steel or iron).
 
✓ Use glass jars and two-piece caps approved for home-canning.
 
✓ Always use new lids for canning.
 
✓ Start counting your water-bath processing time when the water reaches 
a full, rolling boil.
 
✓ Begin counting your pressure-canner processing time after releasing air 
in the canner and achieving the required pressure.
Also, all temperatures are Fahrenheit. All recipes and processing times are 
developed for altitudes at sea level to 1,000 feet above sea level. (For higher 
altitudes, refer to the altitude adjustment charts for water-bath canning in 
Chapter 4 and for pressure canning in Chapter 9.)
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, we made some assumptions about you:
 
✓ You know your way around a kitchen. You’re familiar with basic cooking 
techniques and food preparation methods.
 
✓ You’ve never canned or preserved food before or have relatively 
little experience with food preservation methods and want basic, 
easy-to-understand-and-follow instructions.
 
✓ If you have canned and preserved food before, it was long enough 
ago that you want to find out more about the newer, safer, and easier 
techniques that are recommended today. 
 
✓ Perhaps most importantly, you want to stock your kitchen with more 
natural, healthier, homemade alternatives to standard supermarket fare.

 Introduction
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into parts. The first part gives you basic information 
about canning and preserving, filling you in on terminology, equipment, 
and food safety. The next four parts show you the techniques for different 
preserving methods. Each of these parts includes tried-and-true, tested reci-
pes and preserving tips that offer you a lot of practice for each technique. 
Motivation for trying each technique won’t be a problem. 
Part I: Getting Started
With so many misconceptions about canning and preserving, this book 
begins with an explanation of each food preservation method and dispels any 
fears you may have about each technique. This part is a good starting point 
if you’re new to canning and preserving, or if you’ve been away from any of 
these techniques for a while. You’ll find information on specialty equipment 
and utensils for each method. Don’t overlook the chapter on food safety. It’s 
important to know what dangers may occur — and how to recognize them — 
if you skip any processing step, make adjustments to your recipe, or change 
a processing method and time.
Part II: Water-bath Canning
If you like sweet spreads, relishes, or pickled food, start with this part. 
Water-bath canning is the most popular food-preserving method and the 
easier of the two approved canning methods. This part leads you step by 
step through the process while explaining what foods are suitable for this 
preserving method. You can try dozens of recipes, from jam and jelly to 
chutney and relish.
Part III: Pressure Canning
Pressure canning is the approved method for processing food that’s naturally 
low in acid, like vegetables, meat, poultry, and seafood. These foods contain 
more heat-resistant and hard-to-destroy bacteria than food that’s safely 
water-bath processed. This part carefully describes the procedure and steps 
for canning these foods, whether it’s vegetables or meals of convenience.

Part IV: Freezing
In this part, you discover that your freezer is more than a place for leftovers 
and ice cream. Utilize this cold area for planning and preparing your meals 
with a minimum of time and effort. After reading this part, you’ll understand 
why the proper freezer containers and packaging methods, combined with 
correct thawing practices, prevent damage to your food while preserving its 
quality, flavor, and color.
Part V: Drying and Storing
Drying, which preserves food by removing moisture, is the oldest and 
slowest method for preserving food, and this part explains how to dry a 
variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs for future enjoyment. And you won’t 
want to miss the instructions for making fruit leathers. Who doesn’t like to 
unroll the dried sheets of puréed fruit? This is one time your kids can play 
with their food and get away with it.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part includes short chapters highlighting canning problems that you 
may encounter and fun places to shop online or by catalog to satisfy your 
canning and preserving needs.
Appendix
Near the back of the book, you find a metric equivalent chart that’s a handy 
reference guide for converting any measurements.
Icons Used in This Book
The following four icons appear throughout this book and point out specific 
points or remind you of items you’ll want to be sure not to miss.
 
This icon directs you to tips or shortcuts we’ve picked up over the years. The 
information here makes your work easier and more hassle free.
 
This icon means, “Okay, you’ve heard this stuff before, but the information is 
important and bears repeating.”

 Introduction
 
When you see this icon, pay special attention. The information tells you about 
a potential problem and how to overcome or avoid it.
 
These bits of technical information are interesting, but you can skip them if 
you want to. Of course, the info contained in these paragraphs makes you 
seem like you’ve been canning and preserving since you’ve been walking.
Where to Go from Here
Although you can start in any portion of this book, don’t skip Chapter 3. It 
describes safe processing methods and tells you how to identify spoiled 
food. If you have any doubts about canning and preserving safety, this 
chapter puts your fears at ease.
If you want to know about a particular food-preservation method, go to the 
part devoted to that method. Each one begins with a chapter that explains 
the technique. Review these initial chapters before selecting a recipe to make 
sure you have a decent idea what that particular food preservation method 
requires. If still can’t decide where to start, review the recipes and start with 
one that sounds good to you! Then just back-track to the general techniques 
chapter as you need to. If you’d like to make the Dilly Beans recipe in 
Chapter 8, for example, check out Chapter 4 for the basics on water-bath 
canning. If you want to dry strawberries (you find the recipe in Chapter 17), 
check out Chapter 16 for general drying information.
And if you want to jump right in? Go the Recipes at a Glance page to find a 
recipe that sparks your interest.

▶ Preparing yourself for safely canning and preserving your foods
▶ Becoming a successful food canner and preserver
O
ver the years, because of our busy lifestyles and the convenience of 
refrigeration and supermarkets, the art of canning and preserving 
has declined. Other than jams and jellies, many people started thinking of 
canning as sort of a novelty hobby. But today, many people have a renewed 
interest in learning this art. With the decline in the economy, more people 
are finding that canning and preserving foods is an inexpensive and easy way 
to have a full pantry. 
This chapter gives you an overview of the four canning and preserving 
techniques presented in this book — water-bath canning, pressure canning, 
freezing, and drying — and explains the benefits, both practical and emotional, 
that canning and preserving your own foods can provide.
If you’re new to canning and preserving, don’t be overwhelmed or scared off 
by the rules. This book walks you through easy, step-by-step instructions for 
each technique. After you understand the basic procedures for a method, 
like water-bath canning, it’s just a matter of concentrating on preparing your 
recipe.

Part I: Getting Started 
Knowing the Benefits of Canning 
and Preserving Your Own Food
Canning and preserving are ways to protect food from spoilage so you can 
use it at a later time. Some preserving methods, like drying, date back to 
ancient times; others, like canning, are a little more recent. There’s no doubt 
that being able to offer fresh-tasting, home-canned or -preserved foods to 
your family and friends throughout the year is definitely one of life’s luxuries. 
Whatever food-preservation method you choose (this book covers canning, 
freezing, and drying), your efforts will give you 
 
✓ A pantry full of fresh, homegrown foods. Having a stocked pantry 
offers a cushion against the fluctuating cost of healthy foods. If you 
enjoy specialty foods from gourmet stores but dislike the high prices, 
home-canning is a safe and economical way to preserve large or small 
quantities of high-quality food.
 
✓ Convenience: You can build a pantry of convenience foods that fit into 
your busy lifestyle and that your family will enjoy. 
 
✓ Confidence in the ingredients that go into your food. If you love fresh 
ingredients and like to know what goes into your food, doing your own 
canning and preserving is the answer.
 
✓ Protection against rising food costs. The whole idea of canning and 
preserving is to take advantage of fresh food when it’s abundant. And 
abundant food generally means lower cost.
 
✓ A sense of relaxation and accomplishment: For many people working 
in the kitchen and handling food provides a sense of relaxation, and 
watching family and friends enjoy the products of your efforts gives you 
a great sense of accomplishment. Taking the time to select your recipe, 
choosing and preparing your food, and packaging and processing it for 
safety is fulfilling and a source of pride for you, the home-canner.
 
✓ A good time: Producing canned and preserved food in your kitchen is 
fun and easy — and who doesn’t like fun?
 
The price of food has skyrocketed in the last few years. Food safety has 
become a concern for everyone. Canning is the answer to both the price 
dilemma and the desire to offer nutritious foods throughout the year. 
Home-canning and -preserving instantly rewards your efforts when you 
follow the proper steps for handling and processing your food.

11
 Chapter 1: A Quick Overview of Canning and Preserving
Meeting Your Techniques: Canning, 
Freezing, and Drying
The techniques discussed in this book are safe for home use and produce 
superior results when you follow all the steps for each method. You 
compromise the quality and safety of your food if you make your own rules. 
An example of this is shortening your processing period or not timing it 
correctly. Either of these adjustments can cause food spoilage because the 
food doesn’t heat long enough to destroy all of the microorganisms in it.
 
Review the basic techniques for your type of food preserving before you 
begin — and if you’re already familiar with the techniques, review them 
annually just to refresh your memory. You’ll experience fewer interruptions 
in your food-preserving process. Always do a trial run before canning. This 
ensures you have all your supplies and steps in order so that you can work 
quickly and efficiently. 
You’ll have no doubts about preparing safe home-canned and -preserved 
food after you discover what each method does, which method is best for 
different foods, the rules for the technique you choose, and safe food-
handling techniques. The pages that follow introduce you to the ancient 
and modern-day techniques that will help you can and preserve with ease.
Who’s canning today?
Although home-canning and -preserving has 
skipped one or two generations, one thing is 
certain: It’s on the rise. Men and women of all 
ages practice the art of home-canning. It no 
longer matters whether you live in the country 
or in the city or if you grow your own food. Fresh 
ingredients are available just about every-
where. Farmer’s markets are commonplace in 
many cities and towns, making it easy to find 
the perfect foods to preserve for an affordable 
price.  
Exact statistics regarding home-canning vary, 
but according to the largest manufacturer of 
home-canning products, Alltrista, approxi-
mately one out of four households in the United 
States cans food. Today, most home-canned 
products are used in the home where they’re 
produced. In addition, a rising number of people 
are committed to eating locally, and these folks 
want to know what is in the foods they eat. By 
preserving their own foods, they can find the 
freshest food available and control what goes 
in their food.

Part I: Getting Started 
 
Put by or putting up are terms that describe canning years ago, before there 
was refrigeration. They meant, “Save something perishable for use later when 
you’ll need it.”
About canning food
Canning is the most popular preserving method used today. Don’t let anyone 
tell you that home-canning is complicated and unsafe. It’s simply not true. 
Canning is the process of applying heat to food that’s sealed in a jar in order 
to destroy any microorganisms that can cause food spoilage. All foods contain 
these microorganisms. Proper canning techniques stop this spoilage by 
heating the food for a specific period of time and killing these unwanted 
microorganisms. Also, during the canning process, air is driven from the 
jar and a vacuum is formed as the jar cools and seals. This prevents 
microorganisms from entering and recontaminating the food. 
Approved methods
Although you may hear of many canning methods, only two are approved by 
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). These are water-bath 
canning and pressure canning:
 
✓ Water-bath canning: This method, sometimes referred to as hot water 
canning, uses a large kettle of boiling water. Filled jars are submerged 
in the water and heated to an internal temperature of 212 degrees for a 
specific period of time. Use this method for processing high-acid foods, 
such as fruit, items made from fruit, pickles, pickled food, and tomatoes. 
Chapter 4 explains this method in detail.
 
✓ Pressure canning: Pressure canning uses a large kettle that produces 
steam in a locked compartment. The filled jars in the kettle reach an 
internal temperature of 240 degrees under a specific pressure (stated 
in pounds) that’s measured with a dial gauge or weighted gauge on the 
pressure-canner cover. Use a pressure canner for processing vegetables 
and other low-acid foods, such as meat, poultry, and fish. For more 
information about pressure canning, see Chapter 9.
 
 Don’t confuse a pressure canner with a pressure cooker, which is used 
to cook food quickly. A pressure cooker does not have adequate room 
for both the canning jars and the water needed to create the right 
amount of pressure to preserve foods. 
 
In both water-bath canning and pressure canning, you heat your filled jars of 
food to a high temperature in order to destroy microorganisms and produce 
an airtight, vacuum seal. The only way to reliably produce a safe canned 
product is to use the correct method for your type of food, follow your recipe 
instructions to the letter, and complete each processing step. For all the 
details you need about canning and a plethora of recipes, head to Parts II and 
Part III.

 Chapter 1: A Quick Overview of Canning and Preserving
Canning methods to avoid
Older canning methods are unreliable and, for that reason, aren’t used or 
recommended today for home-canning. Occasionally, these methods are 
“revived” as being faster and easier than water-bath or pressure canning, 
but using any of the following methods is like playing Russian roulette with 
your food safety. Just because your grandmother used one of the following 
methods doesn’t make it safe to use today. If you see instructions that 
require you to use any of the following methods, do yourself a favor and pass 
by that recipe.
 
✓ Oven method: In this method, filled jars are placed in a hot oven. The 
method is unsafe because your food’s internal temperature most likely 
won’t become hot enough to destroy microorganisms and other bacteria 
that cause spoilage. There’s just no guarantee that the food in the jars 
will reach the temperature you set your oven at. There’s also a chance 
that your jars may explode from the sudden temperature change when 
your oven door is opened.
 
✓ Open-kettle method: In this method, food is cooked in an open pot and 
transferred to sterilized jars. The two-piece caps are quickly added in 
hopes of sealing the jars as the food cools. This process produces a 
low vacuum seal that may be broken as gas from spoiling food builds 
up in the jar. This occurs because your food isn’t heated to destroy 
microorganisms. There’s also a chance your food may become 
contaminated when transferring it into the jars.
 
✓ Steam method: This method uses a shallow, covered pan with a rack in 
the bottom. After the filled jars are placed in the pan, steam circulates 
around the jars. This method is unsafe because the jars aren’t evenly 
heated and the steam isn’t pressurized to superheat the food and 
destroy microorganisms. Don’t confuse this method with pressure canning.
 
✓ Microwave oven: All microwave ovens heat differently. Because of this, 
there’s no way to set standards for processing times that achieve a high 
temperature to penetrate the jars and destroy microorganisms that 
cause food spoilage.
 
✓ Dishwasher: Because there’s no way to know the exact temperature of 
different dishwashers and because temperature fluctuates throughout 
the cleaning cycle, dishwasher canning is a no-no. You can’t rely on it to 
produce a safely canned product. You can, however, use a dishwasher 
to wash your jars and let them sit in the hot dishwasher until you’re 
ready to fill them. 
 
✓ Aspirin: Don’t laugh at this, but at one time, aspirin was used as a 
substitute for heat processing. It does contain a germicidal agent that 
acts as a preservative, but this agent doesn’t destroy the enzyme 
that causes deterioration in food and food spoilage.
 
✓ Wax or paraffin seal: Using wax or paraffin was once thought of as a 
safe way to seal canned goods. It has been proven to be unreliable. and 
dangerous botulism spores can still develop.

Part I: Getting Started 
About freezing food
Freezing foods is the art of preparing and packaging foods at their peak of 
freshness and plopping them into the freezer to preserve all that seasonal 
goodness. Freezing is a great way to preserve foods that can’t withstand the 
high temperatures and long cooking of conventional canning methods. 
The keys to freezing food are to make sure it’s absolutely fresh, that you 
freeze it as quickly as possible, and that you keep it at a proper frozen tem-
perature (0 degrees). 
 
The quality won’t get better just because you throw it in the freezer. Properly 
packaging food in freezer paper or freezer containers prevents any deterioration 
in its quality. Damage occurs when your food comes in contact with the dry 
air of a freezer. Although freezer-damaged food won’t hurt you, it does make 
the food taste bad. Here are three things to help you avoid freezer burn:
 
✓ Reduce exposure to air: Wrap food tightly.
 
✓ Avoid fluctuating temperatures. Keep the freezer closed as much as 
possible. Know what you want to remove before opening the door. 
 
✓ Don’t overfill your freezer. An overly full freezer reduces air circulation 
and speeds freezer damage. 
For information and instructions on freezing a variety of foods, go to Part IV. 
About drying food
Drying is the oldest method known for preserving food. When you dry food, 
you expose the food to a temperature that’s high enough to remove the 
moisture but low enough that it doesn’t cook. Good air circulation assists in 
evenly drying the food.
An electric dehydrator is the best and most efficient unit for drying, or 
dehydrating, food. Today’s units include a thermostat and fan to help 
regulate temperatures much better. You can also dry food in your oven or by 
using the heat of the sun, but the process will take longer and produce infe-
rior results to food dried in a dehydrator. Go to Part V for drying instructions 
for fruits, vegetables, and herbs.

Key Tricks to Successful 
Canning and Preserving
Canning and preserving methods are simple and safe, and they produce 
food that’s nutritious, delicious, and just plain satisfying to your taste buds. 
Becoming a successful food preserver takes time, effort, and knowledge of 
the rules. Follow these tips for achieving success as a home canner and 
preserver:
 
✓ Start with the freshest, best products available. Preserving doesn’t 
improve food quality. If you put garbage in, you get garbage out.
 
✓ Know the rules and techniques for your canning or preserving method 
before you start your work. Don’t try to learn a technique after you’ve 
started your processing.
 
✓ Work in short sessions to prevent fatigue and potential mistakes. 
Process no more than two items in one day, and work with only one 
canning method at a time. 
 
✓ Stay up to date on new or revised guidelines for your preserving 
method. This book is a great start. You can also go to Web sites like 
www.freshpreserving.com, created by the makers of Ball canning 
supplies. Here you can find tips and directions for canning just about 
anything. 
 
✓ Use the correct processing method and processing time to destroy 
microorganisms. The recipe will tell you what method to use, but it 
helps if you understand the difference between high- and low-acid 
foods and how the canning methods for each differ. Go to Chapter 3 for 
details.
 
✓ Know the elevation you’re working at. Adjust your processing time or 
pressure when you’re at an altitude over 1,000 feet above sea level. 
For accurate information on how to adjust for your altitude, refer to 
Chapter 4 for water-bath canning conversions and Chapter 9 for pressure 
canning conversions.
 
✓ Put together a plan before you start your preserving session. Read 
your recipe (more than once). Have the proper equipment and correct 
ingredients on hand to prevent last-minute shortages and inconvenient 
breaks (make a list of what you need and check off items as you gather 
them). 

16
Part I: Getting Started 
 
✓ Test your equipment. If you’re using a pressure canner or an electric 
dehydrator, test out the equipment to ensure everything’s working 
properly. And always check the seals on your jars. 
 
✓ Use recipes from reliable sources or ones that you’ve made 
successfully before. Follow your recipe to the letter. Don’t substitute 
ingredients, adjust quantities, or make up your own food combinations. 
Improvisation and safe food preservation aren’t compatible. This also 
means you can’t double your recipe. If you require more than what the 
recipe yields, make another batch. Always use the size jars that are 
recommended in the recipe as well. Trying to use a larger or smaller jar 
may throw off the yield and final result.
Now you’re ready to take your food to its final destination in the preservation 
process. Whether you choose canning, freezing, or drying, proceed down 
your canning and preserving road with confidence.

H
ow many times have you heard the phrase, “Use the right tool for the 
job”? At no time is this truer than when you’re canning and preserving. 
The majority of the items discussed in this chapter won’t break the bank, but 
they’ll make your canning and preserving tasks more efficient. The faster you 
process your fresh ingredients, the better the quality and flavor of your final 
product.
In this chapter, you find a list of the tools and utensils you need to complete 
your tasks. Some tools, like a jar lifter or a lid wand, are only used for canning. 
Other tools, like pots, pans, and knives, are used throughout the year for 
everyday tasks. Purchase good-quality tools and equipment; their quality and 
durability will pay for themselves many times over.
If your local stores aren’t familiar with the canning and preserving items 
you’re looking for or you’re having trouble locating them, head to Chapter 22, 
where you can find a list of sources for canning and preserving supplies.
Assorted Basic Tools 
The tools that make canning and preserving easier are many of the very same 
tools that are in most well-stocked kitchens. When a recipe recommends a 
tool for canning, there’s a practical reason for doing so. Using the proper tool 
for the job decreases the chance of a jar failing to seal or being able to harbor 
bacteria. It can also reduce the chance of mishaps and injuries. 

18
Part I: Getting Started 
Key basic tools and utensils
If you’re serious about any work in the kitchen, these basic tools are 
indispensable. Purchase the best quality you can afford. Good-quality 
items will grow old with you.
 
✓ Knives: You need three basic knives: a paring knife, a multipurpose knife 
with a 6-inch blade, and an 8-inch (some people prefer a 10-inch) chef’s 
knife. When purchasing quality knives, look for two options: stamped 
or forged blades and blades made of stainless or high carbon steel 
(tempered steel knives are no longer the epitome of high quality cutlery). 
Ceramic is another high quality knife, but these high priced knives are 
easier to damage than their steel counterparts. Also, if you select knives 
that are balanced, the knife will do the work for you.
 
 Properly caring for your knives protects your investment. Keep your 
knives razor-sharp. Store them in a block or a magnetic knife storage 
strip so they don’t touch each other. Hand-wash them (dishwashers are 
notorious for being hard on dishes, and knives take the brunt of banging 
around with the other silverware). 
 
✓ Measuring cups: Accuracy in measuring ingredients is essential to 
achieve the correct balance of ingredients for canning. There are two 
types of measuring cups: those for measuring dry ingredients, like flour, 
sugar, and solid fats, and those for measuring liquid ingredients (see 
Figure 2-1).
 
 Liquid measuring cups are made from glass, plastic, or metal. With glass 
measuring cups, you can easily see the amount of liquid in the cup.
 
✓ Measuring spoons (see Figure 2-2): These come in graduated sizes from 
1⁄8 teaspoon to 2 tablespoons. Note: Don’t use adjustable measuring spoons 
for canning foods; they move too easily and could give the wrong 
measurement.
 
 To avoid having to stop and clean your measuring spoons whenever 
you measure the same amount of wet and dry ingredients, have two sets 
handy, one for dry ingredients and the other for wet ingredients.

cups for dry 
and liquid 
food 
products.
 

19
 Chapter 2: Gathering Your Canning and Preserving Gear
 
✓ Spoons: You need at least a couple of cooking spoons made of nonreactive 
metal (like stainless steel) that won’t change the taste of acidic foods 
they come in contact with. Some choices for nonreactive metals are 
stainless steel, anodized aluminum, glass, or enameled cast iron. You 
can also use an assortment of different-sized wooden spoons (see 
Figure 2-2).
 
✓ Rubber spatulas (refer to Figure 2-2): These are available in a variety of 
colors and sizes, from flat to spoon-shaped. Use heat-resistant ones for 
cooking items containing sugar. Check that the end does not easily come 
off the handle, a common problem with less-expensive spatulas. 
 
✓ Tongs: Tongs are handy for all types of kitchen chores, especially 
moving large pieces of food into and out of hot water. Try the spring-
loaded variety in different lengths. Don’t overlook a locking mechanism. 
It keeps the tongs closed when you’re not using them.
 
✓ Ladle: Use a ladle that’s heatproof with a good pouring spout.
 
✓ Potholders: Protect your hands from hot items. Have twice the amount 
of potholders available that you think you’ll need. 
 
 Potholders often get wet during canning. Have enough on hand so that 
you don’t have to use wet potholders. Heat quickly transfers through a 
wet potholder (in the form of steam), causing a severe burn. 
 
✓ Kitchen towels and paper towels: Use these for cleaning your jar rims 
and as a pad for your cooling jars.

20
Part I: Getting Started 
 
✓ Graters: A box grater (refer to Figure 2-2) gives you four or more options 
for shredding and grating. A microplane grater (see Figure 2-3) is an 
updated version of a rasp (a woodworking tool) that’s perfect for removing 
the zest from citrus fruit.
 
✓ Zester (see Figure 2-3): Before the microplane grater, a zester was the 
tool for removing citrus fruit zest (just the skin without the bitter white 
part). It’s still an asset when you need a small amount of zest (a teaspoon 
or less), but for larger amounts, use a microplane grater.
 
✓ Scissors: Use scissors instead of knives to open food packages. Avoid 
cross-contaminating bacteria by washing your scissors after opening 
meats.
 
✓ Timer (refer to Figure 2-2): Choose a timer that’s easy to read, easy to 
set, and loud enough to hear if you leave the room. Consider getting two 
to ensure accuracy. 
 
✓ Waterproof pens and markers: Select ones that don’t rub off.
 
✓ Labels: You can make labels from masking or freezer tape, customize 
your own on your home computer, or order small quantities from a 
company like My Own Labels (see Chapter 22).
 
✓ Cutting board: A good cutting board protects your knives while 
providing you with a movable work surface.
 
✓ Candy thermometer: A candy thermometer accurately registers the 
temperature of candy and sugar. In canning, it’s used to check the 
temperature of cooked items. Some candy thermometers have marks 
indicating the gel point for jelly (220 degrees). Purchase a candy 
thermometer that’s easy to read with a base to support the thermometer 
so the bulb portion doesn’t touch the bottom of your pan. If this occurs, 
your temperature reading won’t be accurate. Many come with a clip 
attached to keep the bulb off of the bottom.

21
 Chapter 2: Gathering Your Canning and Preserving Gear
 
 If you can, store a second thermometer in a handy location. If you 
accidentally break one while canning, you will have a backup. 
The following items aren’t absolutely mandatory, but they’re certainly nice to 
have. If you don’t already have these items in your kitchen, add them as 
you find the need for them. They don’t take up a lot of room, and you’ll find 
yourself constantly reaching for them when you can.
 
✓ Vegetable peeler: Use this for peeling carrots, potatoes, and apples.
 
✓ Potato masher: This makes quick work of smashing your cooked fruits 
or vegetables.
 
✓ Lemon juicer (refer to Figure 2-2): This tool works on any citrus fruit 
and allows you to extract the juice in a hurry. Just cut your fruit in half, 
insert the juicer point into the fruit, and press away.
 
 Measure your juice and keep seeds and pulp out at the same time by 
squeezing your fruit into a mesh strainer resting on the edge of a 
measuring cup.
 
✓ Melon baller: With a melon baller, you can easily remove the seeds 
from a halved cucumber without having the seeds end up all over your 
kitchen.
 
✓ Corer: This tool removes apple cores without damaging the fruit. This is 
a real timesaver when you’re handling pounds of apples.
 
✓ Cherry/olive pitter: There’s nothing better for removing cherry and 
olive pits. Purchase the size of pitter that holds your fruit size.
Pots, pans, mixing bowls, and more
You probably already have an assortment of pots, pans, and mixing bowls. 
If not, don’t worry: You don’t need to purchase everything at one time. Start 
with a good basic assortment and add pieces as you find a need for them.
 
✓ Pots: Pots have two looped handles (one on each side of the pot), range 
in size from 5 to 8 quarts, are deep, and allow ample space for the 
expansion of your food during a hard-rolling boil. A good-quality, 
heavy-bottomed pot provides even heat distribution for cooking jams, 
jellies, or other condiments.
 
✓ Saucepans: Saucepans range in size from 1 to 3 quarts. They have a long 
handle on one side of the pan and usually come with a fitted lid.
 
✓ Mixing bowls: Keep a variety of mixing bowl sizes in your kitchen. Look 
for sets in graduated sizes that stack inside each other for easy storage. 
Bowls made from glass and stainless steel are the most durable.

22
Part I: Getting Started 
 
 Purchase mixing bowls with flat, not curved, bases. They won’t slide all 
over your kitchen counter while you work. When mixing vigorously, 
place a damp dishtowel under the bowl. This prevents the filled bowl 
from sliding. 
 
✓ Colander: Colanders aren’t just for draining pasta. They’re perfect for 
washing and draining fruits and vegetables. Simply fill your colander 
with food and immerse it in a sink full of water. Remove the colander 
from the water and let your food drain while you move on to other tasks.
 
✓ Wire basket: A collapsible wire or mesh basket with a lifting handle 
makes blanching a breeze. Place your filled basket of food into your pot 
of boiling water. When the blanching time is up, lift the food-filled basket 
out of the boiling water.
Specialty equipment to make work easier
All the items in this list are indispensable for your canning chores. They all 
save you loads of time.
 
✓ Food processor: Purchase the best-quality food processor you can 
afford. It should be heavy and sturdy so that it doesn’t bounce around 
on your kitchen counter as it’s processing away. Figure 2-4 is one 
example of a food processor.
 
✓ Food mill: A food mill (see Figure 2-5) purées fruits and vegetables as it 
removes the peel and seeds. You accomplish this by manually cranking 
the blade, which forces the pulp through the mill. Look for a food mill that 
rests on the edge of your bowl or pot, which enables you to use one hand 
to stabilize the mill while you crank the blade with your other hand.
 
Figure 2-4: 
A food 
processor.
 

23
 Chapter 2: Gathering Your Canning and Preserving Gear
 
Figure 2-5: 
Food mill.
 
 
✓ Blender: A blender purées fruits and vegetables in a hurry, but you need 
to remove the peel and seeds first. Be cautious of incorporating too 
much air into your food.
 
✓ Food scale: A food scale is essential when your canning recipe lists 
your fruit or vegetables by weight. The two most common types of 
food scales are spring and electronic. Examples of these are shown in 
Figure 2-6.
 
A food scale with metric quantity markings makes converting recipe ingredients 
a breeze.
 
✓ A spring scale (sometimes referred to as a manual scale) allows you to 
place a bowl on the scale and manually adjust the weight setting to 0 
before weighing your food. After placing your food on the scale, read the 
indicator on the dial to determine the weight.
 
✓ An electronic scale is battery operated with a digital readout. It’s more 
costly than a spring scale but easier to read. Look for one with a tare 
feature. This allows you to set the scale to 0 if you add a bowl to hold 
your food. If you have a choice, choose an electronic or digital scale.

24
Part I: Getting Started 
 
✓ Vacuum-sealing machines: A vacuum sealer is the most efficient appli-
ance around for removing air from food-storage bags. Use vacuum seal-
ers for packaging dried foods or for storing raw or cooked foods in the 
freezer. Although it takes up room and can be costly, you’ll realize its 
full value after you own one. New on the market are hand-held vacuum 
sealers. They can provide a less-expensive alternative to purchasing an 
electric version. 
Canning Equipment
The equipment in this section is especially designed for canning, which 
means you’ll use it during canning season but not much otherwise. Make sure 
you store these items in a safe, clean location. And be sure to look over every 
piece each time you use it to check for wear and tear. 
Canning vessels
The kind of food you’ll be canning determines the type of vessel you’ll be 
using: a water-bath canner or a pressure canner. Refer to Chapters 4 and 9, 
respectively, for detailed information on using each of these vessels.
Water-bath canner
A water-bath canner, also referred to as a boiling-water canner, is a kettle 
used for processing high-acid foods (primarily fruits, jams, jellies, condiments, 
and pickled foods). The canner consists of a large enamelware or stainless-
steel pot with a tight-fitting lid and a jar rack. Check out Chapter 4 for an 
illustration of a water-bath canner and instructions on how to use one.
Pressure canner
A pressure canner, sometimes referred to as a steam-pressure canner, is 
used for canning low-acid foods (primarily vegetables, meats, fish, and 
poultry) in an airtight container at a specific pressure. A weighted gauge or a 
dial gauge measures steam pressure in the canner. This ensures that the high 
temperature of 240 degrees is attained to safely process your food. Pressure 
canners and how to use them are described (and illustrated) in Chapter 9.
Canning tools 
These tools are must-haves for water-bath or pressure canning. Safety in the 
kitchen is number one, and the right tools for handling hot, filled jars and 
other large canning equipment are indispensable.

25
 Chapter 2: Gathering Your Canning and Preserving Gear
Jar lifter
A jar lifter is one tool you don’t want to be without. It’s the best tool available 
for transferring hot canning jars into and out of your canning kettle or pressure 
canner. This odd-looking, rubberized, tonglike item (check out Figure 2-7) 
grabs the jar around the neck (the area just below the threaded portion at 
the top of the jar) without disturbing the screw band. 
 
Figure 2-7: 
Jar lifters.
 
Foam skimmer
A foam skimmer, shown in Figure 2-8, makes removing foam from the top of 
hot jelly, jam, or marmalade easy while leaving any pieces of fruit or rind in 
the hot liquid. (The openings in slotted spoons are too large to achieve quick 
and efficient foam removal.)
 
Figure 2-8:

Part I: Getting Started 
Home-canning jars
Over the years, many types of jars with many varieties of seals have been 
used for home-canning. The most commonly used jars bear the names of Ball 
and Kerr and are commonly referred to as Mason jars. They use a two-piece 
cap to produce a vacuum seal in the jar after heat processing.
 
To ensure safe home-canning today, use only jars approved for home-canning 
and made from tempered glass. Tempering is a treatment process for glass 
that allows the jars to withstand the high heat (212 degrees) of a water-bath 
canner, as well as the high temperature (240 degrees) of a pressure canner, 
without breaking.
Home-canning jars come in many sizes: 4-ounce, half-pint, 12-ounce, 1-pint, 
and 1-quart (see Figure 2-9). They offer two widths of openings: regular-
mouth (about 2
1⁄2 inches in diameter) and wide-mouth (about 3
1⁄8 inches in 
diameter). Regular-mouth jars are used more frequently for jelly, jam, relish, 
or any other cooked food. Wide-mouth jars are mainly used for canning 
vegetables and pickles and meats, because it’s easier to get the large pieces 
into the wide opening.
 
Figure 2-9: 
Varieties 
of canning 
jars: wide-
mouth, 
regular-
mouth, and 
jelly jars.
 
Two-piece caps
Two-piece caps consist of a lid and a metal screw band (see Figure 2-10). 
They’re made specifically for use with modern-day home-canning jars.

27
 Chapter 2: Gathering Your Canning and Preserving Gear
 
✓ Lids: The underside edge of the lid has a rubberlike sealing compound 
that softens when it’s heated. This compound adheres to a clean jar rim 
and creates an airtight seal after the heat-processing period. Lids aren’t 
reusable. 
 
✓ Screw bands: The screw band holds the lid in place during the processing 
period and secures it in place when storing an opened jar in the refrigerator. 
After verifying that your cooled jars have successfully sealed (refer to 
Chapter 4), you remove the screw band before you store the canned 
food. The screw bands may be used many times as long as there are no 
signs of corrosion or rust and they aren’t bent or dented.
 
Figure 2-10: 
Two-piece 
caps: lids 
and screw 
bands.
 
Mason jars
If the most commonly used glass home-canning 
jars bear the names of Ball and Kerr, why do 
we call them Mason jars? The Mason jar is 
named for its creator, James Landis Mason. 
He designed and patented a unique glass jar 
that uses a screw-top lid to create an airtight 
seal for food. This easy-to-seal jar replaced the 
large stoneware vessels that had previously 
been used for food storage.
The tapered jars we use today were introduced 
after World War II. They use a two-piece cap 
consisting of a lid and a metal screw band 
that fits the threaded jar top. Today, all home-
canning jars are generically referred to as 
Mason jars. Thank you, Mr. Mason, for making 
the task of home-canning easy with the use of 
screw-top closures.

28
Part I: Getting Started 
Lid wand
A lid wand (see Figure 2-11) has a magnet on one end of a heat-resistant stick. 
With it, you can take a lid from hot water and place it on the filled-jar rim 
without touching the lid or disturbing the sealing compound.
 
Place your lids top to top and underside to underside to prevent them from 
sticking together in your pan of hot water. If they do stick together, dip them 
into a bowl of cold water to release the suction. Reheat them in the hot water 
for a few seconds before using them. Also offset the lids as you place them in 
the water. This keeps them fanned out and easier to pick up singly. 
 
Figure 2-11: 
A lid wand.
 
Thin plastic spatula
A thin, flexible plastic spatula is the right tool for releasing air bubbles 
between pieces of food in your filled jars (check out Figure 2-12). Buy a 
package of chopsticks for an inexpensive alternative. 
 
Don’t use a metal item or a larger object for this job because it may damage 
your food and crack or break your hot jar.

 Chapter 2: Gathering Your Canning and Preserving Gear
Wide-mouth canning funnel
A wide-mouth funnel (see Figure 2-13) fits into the inside edge of a regular-
mouth or a wide-mouth canning jar and lets you quickly and neatly fill your 
jars. This is an essential tool for canning. 
 
Figure 2-13: 
A wide-
mouth

funnel.
 
Jelly bag or strainer
A jelly bag is made for extracting juice from cooked fruit for making jelly. 
These bags aren’t expensive, but if you’d rather not purchase one, make your 
own using a metal strainer lined with cheesecloth. Use a strainer that hangs 
on the edge of your pot or mixing bowl and doesn’t touch the liquid. Head to 
Chapter 6 for instructions on making jelly.
Stoneware crocks
Stoneware crocks are available in sizes from 1 gallon to 5 gallons, usually 
without lids. They’re nonreactive and are used for making pickles and olives. 
Make sure you use only crocks that are glazed on the interior and certified 
free of lead and cadmium, a form of zinc ore used in pigments or dyes.

30
Part I: Getting Started 
 
Be wary of using secondhand stoneware crocks. These crocks were often 
made with leaded glaze that will leach into your foodstuff. Because you do not 
often know the history of used items, this is an item that is best purchased 
new and not secondhand. 
Tools and Equipment for Freezing Food
Some of the items required for this simple form of food preservation are 
already in your kitchen. For a more detailed list, check out Chapter 13.
 
✓ A freezer: Usually, the freezer attached to your refrigerator is large 
enough for freezing food. But if you’re serious about freezing lots of 
food, you may want to invest in a separate freezer unit.
 
✓ Rigid containers: These can be made of plastic or glass. Use only 
containers approved for the cold temperatures of a freezer. Plastic 
containers should be nonporous and thick enough to keep out odors 
and dry air in the freezer. Glass containers need to be treated to endure 
the low temperature of a freezer and strong enough to resist cracking 
under the pressure of expanding food during the freezing process.
 
✓ Freezer bags: Use bags made for freezing in sizes compatible with the 
amount of your food.
 
✓ Freezer paper and wraps: This laminated paper protects your food from 
freezer burn, which results when air comes in contact with your food 
while it’s in the freezer. Tape this paper to keep the wrap tightly sealed. 
Heavy-duty aluminum foil is another great freezer wrap and requires no 
taping.
 
For extra protection against freezer damage, wrap food items in foil and place 
them in a freezer bag. 
Tools and Equipment for Drying Food
Dehydrating food is a long, slow process of removing moisture from your 
food while exposing it to low heat. Here are some items you’ll want to have 
for this process, which is explained in Chapter 16:
 
✓ An electric dehydrator: This machine dries your food in an enclosed 
chamber while it circulates warm air around your food.
 
✓ A conventional oven: If your oven maintains a low temperature and you 
can stand to be without it for up to 24 hours, use it for drying before 
making the investment in an electric food dehydrator.

31
 Chapter 2: Gathering Your Canning and Preserving Gear
 
✓ Oven thermometer: An oven thermometer tells you if your oven 
temperature is low enough to dry your food without cooking it (see 
Chapter 16 for detailed instructions for checking your oven’s temperature).
 
✓ Trays and racks: These are used for holding your food while it’s drying. 
They’re included with an electric dehydrator. For oven-drying, use 
mesh-covered frames or baking sheets. For sun-drying, clean screens 
are necessary, along with clean cheesecloth to keep hungry bugs off the 
food as it dries.

The Road to Safe Canning 
and Preserving
In This Chapter
▶ Putting your fears of home-canned food to rest
▶ Determining your processing method by your food’s acidity
▶ Making the acquaintance of food-spoiling microorganisms and enzymes
▶ Recognizing the signs of food spoilage
T
he desire and determination to produce a delicious, safe-to-eat product 
without the risk of food poisoning is one thing longtime canners and 
people new to canning have in common. The canning and preserving 
techniques used today provide you with these results as long as you follow 
the proper steps and procedures for preparing, processing, and storing your 
food.
Before you begin your canning and preserving journey, take a stroll through 
this chapter, which introduces you to microorganisms, enzymes, and other 
potentially dangerous situations that cause food spoilage. You can also find 
info on how to prevent and identify food spoilage. The technical portion of 
this chapter shouldn’t deter you from canning. Rest assured, after reading 
this information, you’ll have no fear about preparing and serving your 
home-canned and -preserved food.

Dispelling Your Fears of Home-Canned 
and -Preserved Food
Preventing food spoilage is the key to safe canning. Over the years, home-
canning has become safer and better. Scientists have standardized processing 
methods, and home-canners know more about using these methods. When you 
follow up-to-date guidelines exactly, you’ll experience little concern about the 
quality and safety of your home-canned and -preserved foods.
The following sections offer some tips for handling, preparing, and processing 
your food.
Preparing your food properly
Use fresh, firm (not overripe) food. Wash and prepare your food well to 
remove any dirt and bacteria: Wash it in a large bowl filled with water and a 
few drops of detergent and then rinse it in a separate bowl of fresh water (see  
Figure 3-1). Can fruit and vegetables as soon as possible after they’re picked.
 
No, you don’t have to wash berries individually: Put them in a colander and 
submerge the colander, berries and all, in the wash bowl; then rinse them off 
with a running spray of water.

wash fruit 
and

 Chapter 3: On Your Mark, Get Set, Whoa! The Road to Safe Canning and Preserving
Packing your jars with care
How you fill the canning jars is also important:
 
✓ Don’t overpack foods. Trying to cram too much food into a jar may result 
in underprocessing because the heat can’t evenly penetrate the food.
 
✓ Make sure your jars have the proper headspace. Headspace is the air 
space between the inside of the lid and the top of your food or liquid in 
your jar or container (see Figure 3-2). Proper headspace is important to 
the safety of your preserved food because of the expansion that occurs 
as your jars are processed or your food freezes.
 
✓ Make sure you release the air bubbles from the jar before sealing the 
lid. No matter how carefully you pack and fill your jars, you’ll always 
have some hidden bubbles. 
 
Figure 3-2: 
Headspace.
 
The all-important headspace
When you’re canning food, too little headspace in your canning jars restricts 
your food from expanding as it boils. Inadequate space for the expanding 
food may force some of it out of the jar and under the lid, leaving particles of 
food between the seal and the jar rim. If this occurs, your jar won’t produce a 
vacuum seal.
Leaving too much headspace may cause discoloration in the top portion of 
your food. Excess headspace can keep your jar from producing a vacuum seal 
if the processing time isn’t long enough to exhaust the excess air in the jar.
Always use the headspace stated in your recipe. If your recipe doesn’t give 
you a headspace allowance, use these guidelines:
 
✓ For juice, jam, jelly, pickles, relish, chutney, sauces, and condiments, 
leave headspace of 
1⁄4 inch.
 
✓ For high-acid foods (fruits and tomatoes), leave headspace of 
1⁄2 inch.
 
✓ For low-acid foods (vegetables, meats, fish, and poultry), leave head-
space of 1 inch.

36
Part I: Getting Started 
 
Headspace is also important when you’re freezing food because frozen food 
expands during the freezing process. If you fail to leave the proper headspace 
in your freezer container, the lid may be forced off the container, or the 
container may crack or break. When your frozen food comes in direct contact 
with the air in your freezer, the quality of your food deteriorates and the food 
develops freezer burn (go to Chapter 13 for more on freezing food). On the 
other hand, too much air space allows excess air in your container. Even 
though your food doesn’t come in direct contact with the air in the freezer, 
the excess space in the top of the container develops ice crystals. When your 
food thaws, the excess liquid reduces the food’s quality.
 
If you don’t trust yourself to eyeball the headspace, use a small plastic ruler 
(about 6 inches long) to measure the correct headspace in the jar.
Releasing air bubbles from your jars 
The most important thing to do when you’re filling your jars is to release 
trapped air bubbles between the food pieces. This may seem unimportant, 
but air bubbles can play havoc with your final product:
 
✓ Jar seals: Too much air in the jar from trapped air bubbles produces 
excessive pressure in the jar during processing. The pressure in the jar 
is greater than the pressure outside the jar during cooling. This imbalance 
interferes with the sealing process.
 
✓ Liquid levels: Air bubbles take up space. When there’s trapped air 
between your food pieces before sealing the jars, the liquid level in the 
jar drops when the food is heated. (For releasing air bubbles, see 
Figure 3-3.) In addition, floating and discolored food results from packing 
your food without the proper amount of liquid in the jars. Snuggly 
packed food eliminates air and allows enough liquid to completely cover 
the food with proper headspace (refer to Figure 3-2).
 
Never skip the step of releasing air bubbles. 
Choosing the right canning method and 
following proper procedures
Always use the correct processing method for your food. Process all high-
acid and pickled food in a water-bath canner. Process all low-acid food in a 
pressure canner. To find out how to determine whether a food has a low or 
high acidity level, head to the next section. (You can find out about the 
different canning methods in Chapters 4 and 9.) In addition to choosing the 
right canning method, follow these steps to guard against food spoilage:

filled jars.
 
 
✓ Don’t experiment or take shortcuts. Use only tested, approved methods. 
 
✓ Never use an outdated recipe. Look for a newer version. Do not update the 
directions yourself. Check the publishing date at the beginning of the 
recipe book. If it is more than 5 years old, find a newer version. 
 
✓ If your elevation is higher than 1,000 feet above sea level, make the 
proper adjustments in processing time and pressure for your altitude. 
See the section “Adjusting your altitude” for information on altitudes 
and processing times.
 
✓ If you’re pressure canning, allow your pressure canner to depressurize 
to 0 pounds pressure naturally; don’t take the lid off to accelerate the 
process. 
 
✓ Allow your processed jars to cool undisturbed at room temperature.
 
✓ Process your filled jars for the correct amount of time and, if you’re 
pressure canning, at the correct pressure (both will be stated in your 
recipe). Make adjustments to your processing time and pressure for 
altitudes over 1,000 feet above sea level.
 
✓ Test each jar’s seal and remove the screw band before storing your food.

38
Part I: Getting Started 
Checking your equipment
To prevent spoilage, your equipment must be in good shape and working 
properly:
 
✓ Have the pressure gauge and seal on your pressure canner tested every 
year for accuracy. (Weighted gauges don’t require testing.) This is often 
offered for free at your local extension office. 
 
✓ Use jars and two-piece caps made for home-canning. Discard any jars 
that are cracked or nicked.
 
✓ Never use sealing lids a second time. Always use new lids. The sealant 
on the underside of the lid is good for only one processing. If your jars 
do not seal the first time, always replace the lid with a fresh one. There 
may be a problem with the sealant, despite starting with a new lid. 
Knowing the Acidity Level of Your Food
Knowing the acidity level of the food you’re processing is important because 
the pH, the measure of acidity, determines which canning method you use: 
water-bath or pressure canning. For canning purposes, food is divided into 
two categories based on the amount of acid the food registers:
 
✓ High-acid foods include fruits and pickled foods. (For detailed information 
on identifying and processing high-acid food, refer to Chapter 4.) Foods 
in this group have a pH of 4.6 or lower. Processing them in a water-bath 
canner destroys harmful microorganisms. 
 
 Tomatoes are considered a low-high acid food. With all of the new 
varieties of tomatoes, it is now recommended that the home canner 
add an acid to the canning process, to ensure that the proper acidity is 
reached every time. 
 
✓ Low-acid foods, primarily vegetables, meat, poultry, and fish, contain 
little natural acid. Their pH level is higher than 4.6. (Check out Chapter 
9 for detailed information on identifying and processing low-acid food.) 
Process these foods in a pressure canner, which superheats your food 
and destroys the more heat-resistant bacteria, like botulism.
 
If you want to feel like you’re back in science class all over again, you can buy 
litmus paper at teacher- or scientific-supply stores and test the acidity level of 
your food yourself. Also referred to as pH paper, litmus paper is an acid-sensitive 
paper that measures the acid in food. When you insert a strip of pH paper into 
your prepared food, the paper changes color. You then compare the wet strip 
to the pH chart of colors that accompanies the litmus paper. 

39
 Chapter 3: On Your Mark, Get Set, Whoa! The Road to Safe Canning and Preserving
 
The pH, or potential of hydrogen, is the measure of acidity or alkalinity in 
food. The values range from 1 to 14. Neutral is 7. Lower values are more 
acidic, while higher values are more alkaline. The lower the pH value in your 
food, the more acidic it is.
Avoiding Spoilage
Food spoilage is the unwanted deterioration in canned or preserved food 
that makes your food unsafe for eating. Ingesting spoiled food causes a wide 
range of ailments, depending on the type of spoilage and the amount of food 
consumed. Symptoms vary from mild, flulike aches and pains to more-serious 
illnesses or even death.
But having said that, the potential for spoiled food shouldn’t stop you from 
canning. When you understand the workings of these microscopic organisms 
and enzymes, you’ll know why using the correct processing method for the 
correct amount of time destroys these potentially dangerous food spoilers. 
And you’ll have nothing to worry about.
Meeting the spoilers
Mold, yeast, bacteria, and enzymes are the four spoilers. Microorganisms 
(mold, yeast, and bacteria) are independent organisms of microscopic size. 
Enzymes are proteins that exist in plants and animals. When any one or more 
of the spoilers have a suitable environment, they grow rapidly and divide 
or reproduce every 10 to 30 minutes! With this high-speed development, it’s 
obvious how quickly food can spoil. Some of these create spoilage that can’t 
be seen with the naked eye (like botulism), while others (like mold) make 
their presence known visually.
 
Living microorganisms are all around — in your home, in the soil, and even in 
the air you breathe. Sometimes microorganisms are added to food to achieve 
a fermented product, like beer or bread (for leavening). They’re also impor-
tant for making antibiotics. The point? Not all microorganisms are bad, just 
the ones that cause disease and food spoilage.
Mold
Mold is a fungus with dry spores. Poorly sealed jars of high-acid or pickled 
foods are perfect locations for these spores to set up housekeeping. After 
the spores float through the air and settle on one of their favorite foods, they 
start growing. At first you see what looks like silken threads, then streaks of 
color, and finally fuzz, which covers the food. Processing high-acid and 
pickled food in a water-bath canner destroys mold spores.

40
Part I: Getting Started 
 
Don’t eat food that’s had fuzz scraped off of it. This was thought safe at one 
time but not anymore. Mold contains carcinogens that filter into the remaining 
food. Although the food appears to be noninfected, ingesting this food can 
cause illness.
Yeast
Yeast spores grow on food like mold spores. They’re particularly fond of 
high-acid food that contains lots of sugar, like jam or jelly. They grow as a 
dry film on the surface of your food. Prevent yeast spores from fermenting in 
your food by destroying them in a water-bath canner.
Bacteria
Bacteria are a large group of single-celled microorganisms. Common bacteria 
are staphylococcus and salmonella. Botulism, the one to be most concerned 
with in canning, is the most dangerous form of bacteria and can be deadly. 
It’s almost undetectable because it’s odorless and colorless. Botulism spores 
are stubborn and difficult to destroy. 
Botulism spores hate high-acid and pickled foods, but they love low-acid 
foods. When you provide these spores with an airless environment containing 
low-acid food, like a jar of green beans, the spores produce a toxin in the food 
that can kill anyone who eats it. The only way to destroy them in low-acid 
food is by pressure canning.
 
For safety’s sake, before eating any home-canned, low-acid food, boil it for 
15 minutes from the point of boiling at altitudes of 1,000 feet or lower. For alti-
tudes above 1,000 feet, add 1 additional minute for each 1,000 feet of elevation. 
 
Boiling does not kill the botalism bacteria. Symptoms from ingesting botulism-
infected food occur within 12 to 36 hours after eating it. Symptoms include 
double vision and difficulty swallowing, breathing, and speaking. Seek medical 
attention immediately if you believe you’ve eaten infected food. Antitoxins are 
available to treat this poisoning, but the sooner, the better.
Enzymes
Enzymes are proteins that occur naturally in plants and animals. They 
encourage growth and ripening in food, which affects the flavor, color, 
texture, and nutritional value. Enzymes are more active in temperatures of 85 
to 120 degrees than they are at colder temperatures. They’re not harmful, but 
they can make your food overripe and unattractive while opening the door 
for other microorganisms or bacteria.
An example of enzymes in action occurs when you cut or peel an apple. After 
a few minutes, the apple starts to brown. Stop this browning by treating the 
cut apple with an antioxidant solution (see Chapter 5). Other methods for 
halting the enzymatic action in your food are blanching and hot packing.

41
 Chapter 3: On Your Mark, Get Set, Whoa! The Road to Safe Canning and Preserving
Adjusting your altitude
Properly processing your home-canned foods destroys microorganisms. 
Knowing your altitude is important because the boiling point of water and 
pressure in a pressure canner changes at altitudes over 1,000 feet above sea 
level. This occurs because the air is thinner at higher elevations. With less air 
resistance, water boils at a temperature below 212 degrees.
To produce food free from microorganisms at higher elevations, adjust your 
processing time and pressure to compensate for your altitude. Use the altitude 
adjustment charts in Chapter 4 (for water-bath canning) and in Chapter 9 (for 
pressure canning). These adjustments ensure that your food is heated to the 
correct temperature for destroying microorganisms.
 
If you don’t know the elevation of your city, check with your city offices, your 
public library, or your state or county cooperative extension service listed in 
your local telephone directory. Or check out http://national4-hhead
quarters.gov/extension/index.html on the Internet. Just enter your city 
and state in the box at the bottom of the page, click Submit, and scroll down to 
find the elevation of your city.
Detecting Spoiled Foods
No one can’t promise you that your home-canned foods will always be free 
from spoilage, but you can rest assured that your chances for spoiled food 
are greatly reduced when you follow the precise guidelines for each preserving 
method. If you suspect, for any reason, that your food is spoiled or just isn’t 
right, don’t taste it. Also, just because your food doesn’t look spoiled, doesn’t 
mean that it’s not.
The best way to detect food spoilage is by visually examining your jars. 
Review the following checklist. If you can answer “true” for each of the 
following statements, your food should be safe for eating:
 
✓ The food in the jar is covered with liquid, is fully packed, and has 
maintained the proper headspace.
 
✓ The food in the jar is free from moving air bubbles.
 
✓ The jars have good, tight seals. 
 
✓ The food has maintained a uniform color.
 
✓ The food isn’t broken or mushy.
 
✓ The liquid in the jar is clear, not cloudy, and free of sediment.

42
Part I: Getting Started 
After your food has passed the previous checklist, examine your jars more 
closely. If you discover any spoilage during any step of this process, don’t 
continue your search, but properly dispose of your product.
 
1. Hold the jar at eye level.
 
2. Turn and rotate the jar, looking for any seepage or oozing from under 
the lid that indicates a broken seal.
 
3. Examine the food surface for any streaks of dried food originating at 
the top of the jar.
 
4. Check the contents for any rising air bubbles or unnatural color.
 
 The food and liquid should be clear, not cloudy.
 
5. Open the jar.
 
 There shouldn’t be any spurting liquid.
 
6. Smell the contents of the jar.
 
 Take note of any unnatural or unusual odors.
 
7. Look for any cottonlike growth, usually white, blue, black, or green, 
on the top of your food surface or on the underside of the lid.
 
Spoiled low-acid food may exhibit little or no visual evidence of spoilage. 
Treat any jars that are suspect as if they contained botulism toxins. Follow 
the detailed instructions for responsibly disposing of spoiled, low-acid food in 
Chapter 9. Never use or taste any canned food that exhibits signs of spoilage 
or that you suspect is spoiled.
 
Removing the screw bands from your cooled, sealed jars before storing them 
allows you to easily detect any broken seals or food oozing out from under the 
lid that indicates spoilage.

In This Chapter
▶ Discovering water-bath canning

▶ Knowing the proper processing procedures
W
ith water-bath canning you essentially use a special kettle to boil 
filled jars for a certain amount of time. Common foods for water-bath 
canning include fruits and tomatoes, as well as jams, jellies, marmalades, 
chutneys, relishes, pickled vegetables, and other condiments. 
You’re probably wondering whether water-bath canning is safe for canning 
food at home. Rest assured: The answer is a most definite “Yes!” — provided 
that you follow the instructions and guidelines for safe canning.
In this chapter, you discover which foods are safely processed in a water-bath 
canner and step-by-step instructions for completing the canning process. In 
no time, you’ll be turning out sparkling jars full of homemade delicacies to 
dazzle and satisfy your family and friends.
Water-bath Canning in a Nutshell
Water-bath canning, sometimes referred to as the boiling-water method, is the 
simplest and easiest method for preserving high-acid food, primarily fruit, 
tomatoes, and pickled vegetables. 
To water-bath can, you place your prepared jars in the a water-bath canner, 
a kettle especially designed for this canning method (see the section “Key 
equipment for water-bath canning” for more on the canner and other necessary 
equipment); bring the water to a boil; and then maintain that boil for a certain 

46
Part II: Water-bath Canning 
number of minutes, determined by the type of food and the size of the jar. 
Keeping the water boiling in your jar-filled kettle throughout the processing 
period maintains a water temperature of 212 degrees. This constant temperature 
is critical for destroying mold, yeast, enzymes, and bacteria that occur in 
high-acid foods.
 
Water-bath canning is one of the two recommended methods for safely home-
canning food (the other method is pressure canning, covered in Chapter 9). 
Although each processing method uses different equipment and techniques, 
the goal is the same: to destroy any active bacteria and microorganisms in 
your food, making it safe for consumption at a later time. This is accomplished 
by raising the temperature of the food in the jars and creating a vacuum seal.
 
Water-bath canning and pressure-canning methods aren’t interchangeable 
because the temperature of a water bath only reaches 212 degrees while the 
temperature of a pressure canner reaches 240 degrees, the temperature nec-
essary to safely process low-acid foods. For more on pressure canning, go to 
Chapter 9.
Foods you can safely water-bath can
You can safely water-bath can only high-acid foods — those with a pH factor 
(the measure of acidity) of 4.6 or lower. So just what is a high-acid food? 
Either of the following:
 
✓ Foods that are naturally high in acid: These foods include most fruits.
 
✓ Low-acid foods that you add acid to, thus converting them into a 
high-acid food. Pickled vegetables fall into this category, making them 
safe for water-bath canning. You may change the acid level in low-acid 
foods by adding an acid, such as vinegar, lemon juice, or citric acid, a 
white powder extracted from the juice of acidic fruits such as lemons, 
limes, or pineapples. Some examples of altered low-acid foods are 
pickles made from cucumbers, relish made from zucchini or summer 
squash, and green beans flavored with dill. Today, tomatoes tend to fall 
into this category. They can be water-bath canned, but for safety’s sake 
you add a form of acid to them. 
 
If your recipe doesn’t tell you which processing method (water-bath canning 
or pressure canning) is appropriate for your food, don’t guess. Instead, use 
litmus paper to test the pH level of your food (see Chapter 3). If your food has 
a pH of 4.6 or lower, use the water-bath canning method; if it has a pH of 4.7 or 
higher, use the pressure-canning method.

47
 Chapter 4: Come On In, the Water’s Fine! Water-bath Canning
Key equipment for water-bath canning
Just as you wouldn’t alter the ingredients in a recipe or skip a step in the 
canning process, you don’t want to use the wrong equipment when you’re 
home-canning. This equipment allows you to handle and process your filled 
jars safely.
The equipment for water-bath canning is less expensive than the equipment 
for pressure canning (check out Chapter 9 to see what equipment pressure 
canning requires). Water-bath canning kettles cost anywhere from $25 to $45. 
In some instances, you may purchase a “starter kit” that includes the canning 
kettle, the jar rack, a jar lifter, a wide-mouth funnel, and jars for about $50 to 
$60. (If you don’t have a supplier near you, check out Chapter 22.)
Following is a list of the equipment you must have on hand, no exceptions or 
substitutions, for safe and successful water-bath canning:
 
✓ A water-bath canner: The water-bath canner consists of a large kettle, 
usually made of porcelain-coated steel or aluminum, that holds a maximum 
of 21 to 22 quarts of water, has a fitted lid, and uses a rack (see the next 
item) to hold the jars (see Figure 4-1). Do not substitute a large stock pot 
for a water-bath canner. It is important for the jars to be sitting off the 
bottom of the canner, and there are racks that fit this purpose, included 
in your canner kit. 
 
 Although aluminum is a reactive metal (a metal that transfers flavor to 
food coming in direct contact with it), it’s permitted for a water-bath 
canner because your sealed jar protects the food from directly touching 
the aluminum.
 
Figure 4-1: 
A water-
bath

kettle with 
the rack 
hanging on 
the edge of 
the kettle.
 

48
Part II: Water-bath Canning 
 
✓ A jar rack: The jar rack for a water-bath canner is usually made of 
stainless steel and rests on the bottom of your canning kettle. It keeps 
your jars from touching the bottom of the kettle, or each other, while 
holding the filled jars upright during the water-bath processing period. 
The rack has lifting handles for hanging it on the inside edge of your 
canning kettle (refer to Figure 4-1), allowing you to safely transfer your 
filled jars into and out of your kettle. 
 
✓ Canning jars: Canning jars are the only jars recommended for 
home-canning. Use the jar size recommended in your recipe. For more 
on canning jars, refer to Chapter 2.
 
✓ Two-piece caps (lids and screw bands): These lids and screw bands, 
explained in detail in Chapter 2, create a vacuum seal after the water-bath 
processing period, preserving the contents of the jar for use at a later 
time. This seal protects your food from the reentry of microorganisms.
 
 The older-style rubber rings are no longer recommended. Although they 
are sometimes still available secondhand, the seal is no longer dependable 
enough to result in a safe product. You can find these rubber rings in 
some specialty canning stores; however, due to their novelty, they are 
very expensive and sold in small quantities. Reserve this type of canning 
jar and kitschy design for your fun food gifts, not canning for a family’s 
pantry.
 
In addition to the must-have items listed in the preceding, you may also want 
the following things. These items aren’t critical to the outcome of your product, 
but you’ll discover a more streamlined, efficient level of work if you use them 
(you can find out more about these and other helpful but not necessary tools 
in Chapter 2): 
 
✓ A teakettle or saucepan filled with boiling water to use as a reserve.
 
✓ A ladle and wide-mouth funnel to make transferring food into your jars 
easier. The funnel also keeps the rims of the jars clean, for a better seal. 
 
✓ A lid wand so that you can transfer your lids from the hot water to the 
jars without touching them and a jar lifter so that you can safely and 
easily lift canning jars in and out of your canning kettle.
 
✓ A thin plastic spatula to use for releasing air bubbles in the jar.
The Road to Your Finished Product
Every aspect of the canning procedure is important, so don’t skip anything, 
no matter how trivial it seems. When your food and canning techniques are 
in perfect harmony and balance, you’ll have a safely processed product for 
use at a later time.

49
 Chapter 4: Come On In, the Water’s Fine! Water-bath Canning
The following sections guide you through the step-by-step process for creating 
delicious, high-quality, homemade treats for your family and friends.
 
Always practice proper kitchen sanitation and cleanliness, carefully handle 
your food, and follow your recipe to the letter. Don’t alter your recipe or skip 
any processing step.
Step 1: Getting your equipment ready
The first thing you do when canning is to inspect your equipment and get 
everything ready so that when you’re done preparing the food (Step 2 in the 
canning process), you can fill your jars immediately.
Inspect your jars, lids, and screw bands
Always review the manufacturer’s instructions for readying your jars, lids, 
and screw bands. Then inspect your jars, lids, and screw bands for any 
defects as follows:
 
✓ Jars: Check the jar edges for any nicks, chips, or cracks in the glass, 
discarding any jars with these defects. If you’re reusing jars, clean any 
stains or food residue from them and then recheck them for any defects. 
 
✓ Screw bands: Make sure the bands aren’t warped, corroded, or rusted. 
Test the roundness of the band by screwing it onto a jar. If it tightens 
down smoothly without resistance, it’s useable. Discard any bands that 
are defective or out of round (bent or not completely round). 
 
 You can reuse screw bands over and over, as long as they’re in good 
condition. And because you remove them after your jars have cooled, 
you don’t need as many bands as jars. 
 
✓ Lids: All lids must be new. Lids aren’t reusable. Check the sealant on 
the underside of each lid for evenness. Don’t use scratched or dented 
lids. Defective lids won’t produce a vacuum seal. Don’t buy old lids from 
secondhand stores. Older lids will not seal properly.
Wash your jars, lids, and screw bands
After examining the jars for nicks or chips, the screw bands for proper fit and 
corrosion, and the new lids for imperfections and scratches, wash everything 
in warm, soapy water, rinsing the items well and removing any soap residue. 
Discard any damaged or imperfect items. 

50
Part II: Water-bath Canning 
Get the kettle water warming
Fill your canning kettle one-half to two-thirds full of water and begin heating 
the water to simmering. Remember that the water level will rise considerably 
as you add the filled jars. Be sure to not overfill at this point. 
 
Heat extra water in a teakettle or saucepan as a reserve. You want to make 
sure that the jars are covered with at least 1 to 2 inches of water. By adding 
preheated water, you don’t have to wait for the entire canner to reheat before 
continuing.
Keeping your equipment and jars hot while you wait to fill them
While you’re waiting to fill your jars, submerge the jars and lids in hot, not 
boiling, water, and keep your screw bands clean and handy as follows:
 
✓ Jars: Submerge them in hot water in your kettle for a minimum of 10 
minutes. Keep them there until you’re ready to fill them.
 
✓ Lids: Submerge them in hot, not boiling, water in a saucepan. Keeping 
them separate from your jars protects the lid sealant.
 
✓ Screw bands: These don’t need to be kept hot, but they do need to be 
clean. Place them where you’ll be filling your jars.
Step 2: Readying your food
Always use food of the highest quality when you’re canning. If you settle for 
less than the best, your final product won’t have the quality you’re looking 
for. Carefully sort through your food, discarding any bruised pieces or pieces 
you wouldn’t eat in the raw state. 
Follow the instructions in your recipe for preparing your food, like removing 
the skin or peel or cutting it into pieces. 
Similarly, prepare your food exactly as instructed in your recipe. Don’t make 
any adjustments in ingredients or quantities of ingredients. Any alteration 
may change the acidity of the product, requiring pressure canning (see 
Chapter 9) instead of water-bath canning to kill microorganisms.
 
If your recipe states something specifically, it’s there for a reason. If you don’t 
follow the recipe instructions to the letter, your final results won’t be what the 
recipe intended.

51
 Chapter 4: Come On In, the Water’s Fine! Water-bath Canning
Step 3: Filling your jars
Add your prepared food (cooked or raw) and hot liquid to your prepared jars 
as soon as they’re ready. Follow these steps:
 
1.  Transfer your prepared food into the hot jars, adding hot liquid or 
syrup if your recipe calls for it, and being sure to leave the proper 
headspace. 
 
 Use a wide-mouth funnel and a ladle for quickly filling your jars. You’ll 
eliminate a lot of spilling and have less to clean from your jar rims. It 
also helps cleanup and prevents slipping if you place your jars on a 
clean kitchen towel before filling. 
 
2.  Release any air bubbles with a nonmetallic spatula or a tool to free air 
bubbles. Add more prepared food or liquid to the jar after releasing 
the air bubbles to maintain the recommended headspace.
 
 Before applying the two-piece caps, always release air bubbles and 
leave the headspace specified in your recipe. These steps are critical 
for creating a vacuum seal and preserving your food.
 
3. Wipe the jar rims with a clean, damp cloth.
 
 If there’s one speck of food on the jar rim, the sealant on the lid edge 
won’t make contact with the jar rim and your jar won’t seal. 
 
4.  Place a hot lid onto each jar rim, sealant side touching the jar rim, and 
hand-tighten the screw band. 
 
 Don’t overtighten because air needs to escape during the sealing process. 
Step 4: Processing your filled jars
With your jars filled, you’re ready to begin processing. Follow these steps:
 
1. Place the jar rack in your canning kettle, suspending it with the 
handles on the inside edge of the kettle.
 
2. Place the filled jars in the jar rack, making sure they’re standing 
upright and not touching each other.
 
 Although the size of your kettle seems large, don’t be tempted to pack 
your canner with jars. Only place as many jars as will comfortably fit yet 
still allow water to move freely between them. And always process jars 
in a single layer in the jar rack. 

52
Part II: Water-bath Canning 
 
 Never process half-pint or pint jars with quart jars because the larger 
amount of food in quart jars requires a longer processing time to kill any 
bacteria and microorganisms. If your recipe calls for the same processing 
times for half-pint and pint jars, you may process those two sizes 
together.
 
3. Unhook the jar rack from the edge of the kettle, carefully lowering it 
into the hot water, and add water if necessary.
 
 Air bubbles coming from the jars are normal. If your jars aren’t covered 
by at least 1 inch of water, add boiling water from your reserve. Be 
careful to pour this hot water between the jars, instead of directly on 
top of them, to prevent splashing yourself with hot water. 
 
 Make sure the tops of the submerged jars are covered with 1 to 2 inches 
of hot water. Add additional water from your reserve teakettle or saucepan 
to achieve this level.
 
4. Cover the kettle and heat the water to a full, rolling boil, reducing 
the heat and maintaining a gentle, rolling boil for the amount of time 
indicated in the recipe.
 
 Start your processing time after the water boils. Maintain a boil for the 
entire processing period.
 
 If you live at an altitude above 1,000 feet above sea level, you need to 
adjust your processing time. Check out “Adjusting Your Processing 
Times at High Altitudes” later in this chapter for details. 
Step 5: Removing your filled 
jars and testing the seals
After you complete the processing time, immediately remove your jars from 
the boiling water with a jar lifter and place them on clean, dry, kitchen or 
paper towels away from drafts, with 1 or 2 inches of space between the 
jars — don’t attempt to adjust the bands or check the seals — and allow 
them to cool completely. The cooling period may take 12 to 24 hours. Do not 
try to hurry this process by cooling the jars in any way. This may result in 
unsealed jars or cracked glass. 
After your jars have completely cooled, test your seals by pushing on the 
center of the lid (see Figure 4-2). If the lid feels solid and doesn’t indent, you 
have a successful vacuum seal. If the lid depresses in the center and makes 
a popping noise when you apply pressure, the jar isn’t sealed. Immediately 
refrigerate unsealed jars, using the contents within two weeks or as stated in 
your recipe.

Testing your 
jar seal.
 
Reprocessing unsealed jars
Jars may not seal for several reasons: You may 
have miscalculated the processing time, pieces 
of food may not have been cleaned from the jar 
rim, you may have left an improper amount of 
headspace, or the sealant on the lids may have 
been defective. The safest and easiest method 
for treating processed jars that didn’t seal is 
to refrigerate the jar immediately and use the 
product within two weeks.
If you want to reprocess jars that didn’t seal, 
you can do that. But keep in mind that repro-
cessing your food takes almost as much time as 
making the recipe from the beginning. The only 
time to consider reprocessing jars is if every jar 
in the kettle doesn’t seal.
To reprocess unsealed jars, follow these 
steps:
 1. Remove the lid and discard it.
 2. Check the edge of the jar for damage.
 
 If the jar is damaged, discard the food in case 
a broken piece of glass fell into the food.
 3. Discard any damaged jars.
 4. Reheat the food.
 5. Follow the step-by-step instructions in this 
chapter for filling your jars, releasing air 
bubbles, and processing your sterilized, 
filled jars.
 6. Reprocess the filled jars for the recom-
mended time for your recipe.
 7. Check the seal after your jars have com-
pletely cooled.

54
Part II: Water-bath Canning 
Step 6: Storing your canned food
After you’ve tested the seal and know that it’s good (see the preceding 
section), it’s time to store your canned food. To do that, follow these steps:
 
1. Remove the screw bands from your sealed jars.
 
2. Wash the sealed jars and the screw bands in hot, soapy water.
 
 This removes any residue from the jars and screw bands.
 
3. Label your filled jars, including the date processed.
 
4. Store your jars, without the screw bands, in a cool, dark, dry place.
Adjusting Your Processing 
Times at High Altitudes
When you’re canning at an altitude higher than 1,000 feet above sea level, 
you need to adjust your processing time (see Table 4-1). Because the air is 
thinner at higher altitudes, water boils below 212 degrees. As a result, you 
need to process your food for a longer period of time to kill any microorganisms 
that can make your food unsafe. 
If you live higher than 1,000 feet above sea level, follow these guidelines:
 
✓ For processing times of less than 20 minutes: Add 1 additional minute 
for each additional 1,000 feet of altitude. 
 
✓ For processing times of more than 20 minutes: Add 2 additional 
minutes for each 1,000 feet of altitude.

Simply Fruit
In This Chapter
▶ Preserving freshly picked fruit for optimum flavor
▶ Preventing fruit from lightening and darkening
▶ Choosing jar-filling liquids
▶ Making easy fruit pies and side dishes
C
anning fresh fruit is a great way to preserve 
large quantities of ripe fruit in a short 
period of time. Buying fruit when it is in season 
saves money, and you can be assured of the best-
flavored fruit. Canning fruit is easy to do: Just 
fill your jars with fruit and hot liquid and then 
process them! With canned fruit readily available, 
you have an easy snack or a quick side dish.
This chapter explains the importance of using 
freshly picked, perfectly ripe fruit and keeping your fruit looking and tasting 
its best. In addition to the instructions for canning a variety of popular fruits, 
you’ll also find tomatoes in this chapter. Often considered a vegetable, they 
are actually a fruit, and can be canned using the same technique. 
Picking and Preparing Your Fresh Fruit
When selecting your fruit, think fresh, fresh, fresh! The best fruit for canning 
is freshly picked, ripe fruit. You’re lucky if you grow your own fruit or have 
a friend who shares hers with you. Some growers offer a “pick your own” 
option in their growing area for a fee. (Ask growers at farmer’s markets or 
check your local phone directory for locations in your area.) You’ll need to 
bring your own containers for the fruit.
Fruit from your supermarket isn’t the best choice because it’s often picked 
before it’s fully ripened in order to compensate for the time it takes to get the 
fruit from the field to the store shelf. Don’t boycott your supermarket, just be 
finicky when selecting your fruit for canning.

Part II: Water-bath Canning 
The sooner you process your picked fruit, the better the texture and flavor 
of your final product. Your fruit can wait a few hours or overnight before you 
process it, but be sure to refrigerate it until you’re ready. 
 
Almost all fresh fruits can well with these exceptions: bananas, lemons, limes, 
melons, persimmons, and strawberries.
Identifying the proper degree of ripeness
How do you know if your fruit is ripe? Ripe fruit is defined as being fully 
developed, or mature, and ready for eating. If you grow your own fruit, you 
can check its development and maturity daily. 
To check the fruit’s ripeness 
 
✓ Hold the fruit in the palm of your hand and apply gentle pressure with 
your thumb and fingers. The fruit should be firm to the touch. If there’s 
an impression in the fruit that doesn’t bounce back, the fruit is overripe. 
If it’s hard as a rock, it’s underripe. Neither should be canned. If you’re 
picking your fruit for canning, you can perform the same test, with a 
slight difference: Do it while the fruit’s still attached to the tree.
 
✓ Smell the fruit. Ripe fruit has a rich, full fruit aroma. A peach should 
smell like a peach; an apple should smell like an apple. The fragrance 
should be strong enough to entice you to devour the fruit on the spot.
 
Always use fruit picked directly from the bush or tree. Fruit collected from the 
ground (referred to as dropped fruit or ground fruit) is an indication that the 
fruit is overripe. Don’t use it for canning.
Cutting and peeling: Necessary or not?
When you can fruit, should you leave the skin on or take it off? Depends on 
the recipe. Sometimes leaving the skin on your fruit is optional. Other times, 
the peel must be removed. Always follow your recipe for specific guidelines.
Similarly, you may wonder whether cutting your fruit is necessary. The 
answer here depends on the fruit. The fruit you select dictates using it whole 
or cutting it into pieces. For example, fitting whole apples into a canning jar 
is difficult, but peeled apples cut into slices easily pack into a jar. You leave 
small fruit, like berries, whole.

59
 Chapter 5: Simply Fruit
Deterring discoloration
There’s probably nothing more unattractive than a piece of perfectly ripe 
cut fruit that’s oxidized or discolored, dark or brown. Discoloration primarily 
occurs in apples, apricots, nectarines, peaches, and pears but may occur in 
other fruits.
You can protect your fruit from oxidation by slicing it directly into one of the 
following antioxidant solutions, a liquid to keep your fruit from darkening:
 
✓ An ascorbic acid or citric solution: Make a solution with 1 teaspoon of 
lemon or lime juice in 1 cup of cold water, or use a commercial product, 
like Ever-Fresh or Fruit-Fresh, available in most supermarkets. When 
using one of these products, follow the instructions on the container.
 
 Ascorbic acid or citric acid is simply vitamin C. It doesn’t change the 
fruit flavor. It’s sold in powder form and is usually found in drugstores.
 
✓ Vinegar, salt, and water: Make this solution with 2 tablespoons of vinegar 
(5 percent acidity), 2 tablespoons of salt (pickling or kosher), and 1 
gallon of cold water. Don’t leave your fruit in this solution longer than 
20 minutes because the solution extracts nutrients from your fruit and 
changes its flavor.
After its dip in your antioxidant solution, you just rinse and drain your fruit 
before packing it into your prepared jars.
Raw pack and hot pack
Raw pack and hot pack refer to two methods of getting the product into the 
jars. Generally, both methods can be used for either water-bath canning 
(covered in Chapter 4) or pressure canning (covered in Chapter 9). Whether 
you use one or the other is determined by the texture of the food and its 
tendency (or not) to not fall apart from a lot of cooking. Whether you raw-
pack or hot-pack also affects the processing times of the foods. Always refer 
to your recipe for guidance. 
 
✓ Raw pack: A raw pack is the preferred method for fruits that become 
delicate after cooking, such as peaches and nectarines. This method is 
what it says: packing raw fruit into hot jars. 

60
Part II: Water-bath Canning 
 
✓ Hot pack: Hot packing heats your fruit in a hot liquid before packing it 
into your prepared jars. The advantages of hot packing over raw packing 
include fitting more fruit into the jars because the fruit’s softer and more 
pliable, using fewer jars because you can fit more fruit into the jars, and 
spending less time waiting for the water in your kettle to boil because 
the filled jars are hot in the middle.
With a few exceptions, most fresh fruits may be packed raw or hot. Always 
start with clean, ripe fruit and follow your recipe instructions.
Lining your jars with liquid
You always add liquid when canning fresh fruit. Your options are boiling 
water, sugar syrup, or fruit juice. Determining which liquid you use is up to 
you, but consider the final use for your canned fruit. For instance, if you’re 
using your canned berries in a fruit cobbler, boiling water may be the better 
choice because you’ll add sugar to the cobbler. If you’ll be eating your 
canned fruit out of the jar, use a sugar syrup or fruit juice.
 
After adding the hot liquid to your filled jars, you release any trapped air 
bubbles in the jar. If the headspace drops after releasing the air bubbles, add 
more liquid to maintain the proper headspace (refer to Chapter 3 for information 
about headspace). If the fruit level drops, you need to add fruit.
Sugar syrups
Sugar syrup is simply a mixture of sugar and water. It adds flavor to your 
canned fruit, preserves its color, and produces a smooth, firm texture. Other 
sweeteners, such as honey, may be added in addition to or without the sugar.
Use these guidelines for making your sugar-syrup choice:
 
✓ Super-light syrup: This syrup adds the least amount of calories. The 
sweetness level is the closest to the natural sugar level in most fruits.
 
✓ Extra-light syrup: Use this syrup for a sweet fruit, such as figs.
 
✓ Light syrup: This is best with sweet apples and berries.
 
✓ Medium syrup: This syrup complements tart apples, apricots, nectarines, 
peaches, and pears.
 
✓ Heavy syrup: Use this with sour fruit, such as grapefruit.

61
 Chapter 5: Simply Fruit
Table 5-1 offers you five concentrations of sugar syrup. Allow 
1⁄2 to 
3⁄4 cup of 
liquid for each filled pint jar and 1
1⁄2 cups of liquid for each filled quart jar of 
fruit. Bring your syrup ingredients to a boil in a saucepan over high heat; stir 
to dissolve the sugar.

Sugar syrup recipe alternatives
Although syrup of sugar and water is the most 
common liquid used when canning fresh fruit, 
you may use honey in place of or in addition to 
granulated sugar. Use a mild-flavored honey 
that won’t detract from the natural flavor of your 
fruit. Here are some suggestions:

Combine the syrup ingredients in a saucepan

If you refrigerate your syrup, reheat it to a boil 
before adding it to your filled jars.
Remember: Honey and canned goods made 
with honey should never be fed to children 
under 1 year of age due to the danger of infant 
botulism. 

62
Part II: Water-bath Canning 
Water or fruit juice
Packing fresh fruit in boiling water or fruit juice produces fruit with a soft 
texture. Two good choices for fruit juices are unsweetened pineapple juice or 
white grape juice. Use water you like to drink, without minerals and not the 
sparkling variety. 
 
Always use the hot-pack method (see the section “Raw pack and hot pack” 
earlier in this chapter) when using water or unsweetened fruit juice for your 
canning liquid.
Fresh Fruit Canning Guidelines
The following sections list foods that are commonly grown in home 
gardens. The quantity guide for each fruit fills a 1-quart jar. If you’re using 
pint jars, cut the quantity in half. 
The recipes in the following sections use the water-bath canning method. 
For detailed instructions on water-bath canning, filling and processing your 
jars, and releasing air bubbles, refer to the step-by-step guidelines in Chapter 
4. And for a more extensive list of fruits, refer to the Complete Guide to 
Home Canning and Preserving, Second Revised Edition, by the United States 
Department of Agriculture.
Apples
Choose apples suitable for eating or making pies. Prep is easy: Just peel and core 
the apples and then cut them into slices or quarters. To prevent discoloration, 
treat the fruit with an antioxidant (refer to “Deterring discoloration,” earlier in 
this chapter).

63
 Chapter 5: Simply Fruit
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on 
preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Wash, core, and peel your apples; then slice them into 
1⁄4-inch pieces or cut them into 
even chunks. Meanwhile, bring the sugar syrup to a boil.
 3 Pack apples firmly into hot jars and pour boiling hot sugar syrup over the apples, leaving 
1⁄2-inch headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-
tightening the bands. 
 4 Process the filled jars in a water-bath canner for 20 minutes for pints and quarts from 
the point of boiling.
 5 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (see Chapter 4). If you 
find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks.
Vary It! For a sweeter canned apple, try a medium syrup instead.

Canned Apples
Canned apples are wonderful for apple crisp, breads, and other recipes calling for slices 
or chunks of fruit. Use any crisp, tart apple that ripens in the fall. Summer-ripened 
apples tend to be softer and won’t hold up well to canning. Try making them with a light 
sugar syrup for a fresh-tasting treat.

Apricots, nectarines, and peaches
Peaches are a wonderful fruit, and by canning them yourself you can save 
a lot of money. Use a light syrup so that you can enjoy the full flavor of the 
peach. Trust us: Home-canned peaches are much nicer than the heavy sweet-
ness you find in store-canned varieties. 
Nectarines and apricots are just as tasty as peaches and have the benefit of 
not needing to be peeled, making them even easier to can. For a quick guide 
to peeling fruit, see Figure 5-1. 
 
Apricots make a sunny-flavored addition to the winter meals. They make 
a great substitute for apples in an apple crisp recipe, too — you’ll love the 
results!
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on 
preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Wash your fruit. To prepare peaches, peel them; then cut them in half and remove the 
pits (see Figure 5-1). To prepare nectarines or apricots, simply cut them in half and 
remove the pits. Meanwhile, bring the sugar syrup to a boil.
 3 Pack the fruit firmly into hot jars and pour boiling hot sugar syrup over fruit, leaving 
1⁄2-inch headspace. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3). 
Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands.
 4 Process the filled jars in a water-bath canner for 25 minutes (pints) or 30 minutes 
(quarts) from the point of boiling.
 5 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (see Chapter 4). If you

Berries (except strawberries)
Canned berries have so many uses! You can use them to make smoothies or 
pies and as a sweet addition to your oatmeal. If your pantry is like ours, your 
berries will be the first things used up, 
For canning, you want perfect, not soft or mushy, berries. Leave them whole. 
Wash and drain the berries (handling them as little as possible); remove any 
stems or hulls. 

68
Part II: Water-bath Canning 
 
Strawberries don’t can well. During the processing, they turn mushy and lose 
their taste and red color. They do, however, freeze very well. See Chapter 13 
for complete instructions. 
Depending on the type of berry, you’ll use either the raw or hot pack method:
 
✓ Raw pack: Raw packing is best for soft berries, like blackberries, 
boysenberries, and raspberries. 
 
✓ Hot pack: Use this method for firmer berries, such as blueberries, 
cranberries, and huckleberries. 
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on 
preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Wash the berries gently in cold water to firm them and remove any stems or hulls. 
Meanwhile, bring the sugar syrup to a boil.
 3 Pack berries loosely into your prepared jars and pour boiling hot sugar syrup over 
them, leaving 
1⁄2-inch headspace. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil 
(refer to Chapter 3), adding more sugar syrup as necessary to maintain the proper 
headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the 
bands. 
 4 Process the filled jars in a water-bath canner for 15 minutes (pints) or 20 minutes 
(quarts) from the point of boiling.
 5 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (see Chapter 4). If you 
find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks.
 
Canned Raspberries 
With soft berries, like raspberries, boysenberries, and blackberries, you don’t have to 
cook the berries before canning. Simply place them in your canning jars and pour hot 
syrup over them. This recipe explains how to can raspberries, but you can use it to can 
any other soft berry the same way.

1⁄2 cup sugar for each quart of berries. Bring 
the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat and stir occasionally to prevent sticking. In a 
large pot, bring water for your reserve to a boil.
 4 Ladle the hot berries and liquid into your prepared jars, adding boiling water if there 
isn’t enough liquid to fill the jars, leaving 
1⁄2-inch headspace. Release any air bubbles 
with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3), adding more berries and water as 
necessary to maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the 
two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 5 Process the filled jars in a water-bath canner for 15 minutes (pints) or 20 minutes 
(quarts) from the point of boiling.
 6 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (see Chapter 4). If you find 
jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks.
Vary It! For sweeter canned berries, use medium syrup.

Canned Blueberries 
To can hard berries (like blueberries and cranberries), you follow the same general steps 
you do for soft berries, with one exception: Instead of packing the jars and adding sugar 
syrup, you boil the berries and sugar together before filling the jars. This recipe shows 
you how to can blueberries. Follow the same directions for any other type of hard berry.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Processing time: Pints, 15 minutes; quarts, 20 minutes
Yield: 8 pints or 4 quarts
10 pounds blueberries 
Sugar syrup, light

Pears
All varieties of pears can well, so use your favorite variety. After cutting and 
peeling the pears, treat your fruit with an antioxidant to prevent discoloring 
(refer to the “Deterring discoloration” section of this chapter).
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on 
preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Wash, peel, and core the pears. Slice the pears into 
1⁄4-inch pieces or cut them into 
even-sized chunks. Bring your sugar syrup to a boil.
 3 Pack the pears firmly into the hot jars and pour the boiling hot sugar syrup over them, 
leaving 
1⁄2-inch headspace. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to 
Chapter 3), adding more sugar syrup as necessary to maintain the proper headspace. 
Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 4 Process the filled jars in a water-bath canner for 20 minutes (pints) or 25 minutes 
(quarts) from the point of boiling.
 5 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (see Chapter 4). If you 
find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks.

Rhubarb
Rhubarb looks like red celery but isn’t related to celery. It can be mixed 
with strawberries for a pie filling and is delectable when combined with tart 
apples. Because of its tart taste, rhubarb is always canned with sugar and 
makes a great pie filling.
 
Rhubarb leaves are toxic. Always remove and discard any leaves from the 
stalks before preparing your rhubarb.
 1 Wash, trim, and remove the leaves from the rhubarb. Cut the stalks into 
1⁄2-inch pieces. 
Place the rhubarb pieces in a 6-quart pan. Add sugar to the cut pieces and let them 
stand for 4 hours to draw out the juice. Taste the mixture with a clean spoon to check 
that it is sweet enough. If not, add more suger, to taste.
 2 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on 
preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 3 When the standing time is complete, heat the rhubarb and sugar mixture to boiling over 
high heat.
 4 Pack the hot rhubarb mixture into your canning jars, leaving 
1⁄2-inch headspace. Release 
any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3), adding more of the rhu-
barb mixture as necessary to maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal 
the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands.
 5 Process the filled quart jars in a water-bath canner for 20 minutes from the point of boiling.
 6 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel away 
from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (see Chapter 4). If you find jars that 
haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks.

 Chapter 5: Simply Fruit
Tackling Tomatoes
Tomatoes are misunderstood. Are they a fruit or a vegetable? By definition, 
a fruit is a sweet, edible plant containing seeds inside a juicy pulp — which 
defines tomatoes perfectly. Each tomato variety has its own color, flavor, 
and texture. Roma or paste tomatoes and slicing varieties are all used for 
canning. Paste varieties simply have less juice and, therefore, require less 
cooking to remove excess water for paste and thick sauces. You can use both 
interchangeably, but cooking times will vary. 
 
Not all tomato varieties are suitable for canning due to their lack of taste and 
mass-production genetics. Stick with those that boast good canning results on 
the plant’s tag or use a proven Heirloom variety. Some varieties that work well 
include Ace, Amish paste, Homestead 24, and Rutgers.
As always, choose nice, ripe, unblemished tomatoes. And to ensure the 
proper acidity level for your variety (4.6 or lower), add an acid, like bottled 
lemon juice or powdered citric acid: Add 2 tablespoons lemon juice per 
quart jar or 1 tablespoon lemon juice per pint. If you’re using citric acid, 
add 
1⁄2 teaspoon per quart and 
1⁄4 teaspoon per pint. 
Just what do tomatoes taste like?
Tomatoes were the first thing I (Amy) ever 
remember canning. My grandmother would 
have me stand on a milk crate, and I would help 
her peel off the skins and add more ice to the 
water when it was needed. 
My grandmother made canning and preserv-
ing seem second nature. She never rushed, but 
always kept moving. Before you knew it, there 
were dozens of jars of bright, red tomatoes sit-
ting on the shelf. 
I owe my addiction to canning to my grand-
mother’s talent and my grandfather’s taste for 
homemade foods. To me, canned tomatoes 
taste like sunshine, happy memories, and love.

74
Part II: Water-bath Canning 
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on 
preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Wash and peel the tomatoes. (To make peeling tomatoes easier, blanch them first to 
loosen the skins: Dip them in boiling water for 30 seconds and then into cold water.) 
After peeling, cut the larger tomatoes into halves or quarters. 
 3 Place the tomatoes into your prepared canning jars, pressing them to release their 
juice. (Use a canning funnel to keep the rims clean.) To each pint jar, add 1 tablespoon 
lemon juice or 
1⁄4 teaspoon citric acid and, if desired, 
1⁄2 teaspoon salt. To each quart jar, 
add 2 tablespoons lemon juice or 
1⁄2 teaspoon citric acid and, if desired, 1 teaspoon salt. 
If there’s not enough juice to cover the tomatoes, add boiling water to the jars, leaving 
1⁄2-inch headspace. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 
3), adding more tomatoes as necessary to maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the jar 
rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands.
 4 Process the filled jars in a water-bath canner for 35 minutes (pints) or 45 minutes 
(quarts) from the point of boiling.
 5 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (see Chapter 4). If you 
find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks.
Tip: Use wide-mouth pints or quart jars for ease in filling. Although not necessary, they will 
make the entire process go faster and with less mess.

 Chapter 5: Simply Fruit
 1 Combine all ingredients in a 6-quart pot and cook slowly over medium heat for 1 hour, 
stirring frequently to prevent sticking. Remove the bay leaves and press the mixture 
through a food mill or sieve. Return the mixture to the pot and continue to cook for 
another 3 hours over medium-low heat, stirring often. 
 2 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on 
preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 3 Pour the hot mixture into your canning jars, leaving 
1⁄4-inch headspace. Add 
1⁄2 table-
spoon lemon juice or 
1⁄8 teaspoon citric acid to each half-pint jar. Release any air bub-
bles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3), adding more of the mixture as 
necessary to maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the 
two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands.
 4 Process the filled half-pint jars in a water-bath canner for 30 minutes from the point of boiling. 
 5 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel away 
from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (see Chapter 4). If you find jars that 
haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks.
Tip: To check for sauce thickness, put a spoonful of sauce onto the center of a plate. Wait 
for 60 seconds and see if water seeps from it. If so, cook for 30 minutes more and recheck.

Tomato Paste
Tomato paste is packed with flavor, and if you’re overrun with tomatoes, this recipe is 
the answer because it uses a lot of fruit! You can use this thick paste as-is for pizza (it’s 
only slightly less thick than store bought but just as rich and fabulous); simply add 
your seasonings right on top. Your family will love the extra tomato taste. You can also 
add this paste to soups for amazing flavor and extra vitamins. For this recipe, use paste 
or plum tomatoes, which have much less extra water to cook off. This thick, rich sauce 
is canned in half-pint jars.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour, and then 3 hours more
Processing time: 30 minutes 
Yield: 16 half-pints
16 pounds plum or paste 
tomatoes, cubed
3 cups sweet pepper, chopped
2 bay leaves
2 tablespoons salt
3 cloves garlic 
Bottled lemon juice or citric acid

 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on 
preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Wash and core tomatoes. Roughly chop them into chunks. Place the tomatoes in a 
large pot and bring them to simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent 
scorching. Cook the tomatoes until they’re soft, about 25 to 30 minutes.
 3 Strain the tomatoes through a food mill to separate the juice from the skins and seeds. 
Return the juice to the pot and bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Allow it to 
simmer 5 minutes.
 4 Ladle the hot juice into your canning jars. To each quart jar, add 2 tablespoons of 
lemon juice or 
1⁄2 teaspoon citric acid. To each pint jar, add 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
or 
1⁄4 teaspoon citric acid. Leave 
1⁄2-inch headspace. Release any air bubbles with a 
nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3), adding more juice as necessary to maintain 
the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-
tightening the bands. 
 5 Process the filled jars in a water-bath canner for 40 minutes (pints) or 45 minutes 
(quarts) from the point of boiling.
 6 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel

S
weet spreads are our most favorite items 
to can. Think outside of the box for ways 
to serve your homemade creations. For some of our favorite serving ideas, 
check out the introductory notes in the recipes. We hope you’ll come up 
with even more ideas. You can make combinations of ingredients that aren’t 
commercially available. Sweet spreads aren’t just for toast anymore!
In this chapter, we include a variety of our favorite recipes with unique flavor 
combinations. The recipes utilize a variety of preparation techniques that 
take you step by step through each process. In addition to fresh fruit, some 
recipes use frozen fruit and fruit juice.
Understanding Your Sweet Spreads
Making sweet spreads is basic chemistry, using exact proportions of fruit and 
sugar, cooking the two, and sometimes adding acid or pectin. Don’t worry if 
chemistry wasn’t your strong suit in school. Good recipes do the homework 
for you. Your responsibility is to follow the recipe exactly, using the correct 
ingredients and measuring them accurately.

Part II: Water-bath Canning 
 
Never double a sweet spread recipe or adjust the sugar amount. Recipes are 
balanced to achieve a specific consistency and texture. Any alteration or 
adjustment to the recipe upsets the perfect chemical balance and adversely 
affects your spread by producing inferior results. If you want more of the same 
recipe, make it twice. If you would like to use less sugar, find another recipe 
that uses your desired amount. 
Sweet spreads, generically referred to as preserves, come in many forms and 
textures. The various types of sweet spreads are as follows:
 
✓ Jam: Jam is a combination of fruit (crushed or chopped), sugar, and 
sometimes pectin and acid, cooked until the pieces of fruit are soft and 
almost lose their shape. Common uses for jam include bread spreads, 
cookie and pastry fillings, and a topping for cheesecake.
 
✓ Jelly: This mixture combines fruit juice, sugar, and sometimes pectin. 
It’s transparent with a bright color and should be firm, yet jiggly. If you 
use fresh fruit, you may be instructed to strain it. Use jelly as a bread 
spread or as a filling for cakes and cookies.
 
✓ Marmalade: These are soft jellies with pieces of fruit rind, usually citrus 
fruit, suspended in them. In addition to bread spread, marmalades are 
great as a glaze on a baked ham (use your favorite flavor!).
 
✓ Preserves: In addition to the generic term representing all sweet 
spreads, preserves have a definition of their own. They contain cooked 
fruit, sugar, and sometimes pectin and have a jamlike consistency, but 
with whole or large pieces of fruit. The fruit maintains its shape during 
the cooking process.
 
✓ Butter: This smooth, thick spread is made from fruit purée and sugar 
cooked for a long period of time. The results are a thick spread. Butters 
normally use less sugar than other sweet spreads and may have spices 
added to enhance the flavor of the fruit.
 
✓ Conserves: These usually contain two fruits mixed with sugar and 
nuts and cooked to achieve a consistency similar to jam. Traditionally, 
conserves were used as a spread on biscuits and crumpets.
Choosing Fruit for Sweet Spreads
Always select the freshest fruit available to you. Everyone has his or her 
favorite. Know when your favorites are in season for the best selection, the 
highest quality, and, usually, the most reasonable pricing. (For detailed 
information on selecting fresh fruits, check out Chapter 5.)

79
 Chapter 6: Sweet Spreads: Jams, Jellies, Marmalades, and More
Local growers are good indicators of the types of fruit grown in your area. 
Check out your local farmer’s markets and ask the sellers about their fruit. 
People love to talk about their passion, and who better to learn from than the 
person who grows the food you’re buying? Ask questions about the fruit you 
see, how they determine ripeness, and how a particular fruit tastes. If they’re 
not passing out samples, they’ll probably be happy to cut you a taste.
 
Carry copies of your favorite recipes when you’re visiting local growers or 
farmer’s markets. That way, you’ll always buy the right amount of fruit for 
your favorite recipe.
Getting Up to Speed with Fruit Pectin
Pectin is a natural, water-based substance that’s present in ripe fruit. It’s 
essential for thickening jams, jellies, and other types of preserves. Some 
recipes add commercial fruit pectin when more than the naturally occurring 
amount of pectin is needed (like when you want to thicken a fruit juice into 
a jelly). If your recipe does include such an ingredient, you’ll see the kind of 
pectin (powdered or liquid) listed. 
 
Never alter the amount of sugar your recipe calls for or use sugar substitutes. 
Exact amounts of sugar, fruit, and pectin are a must for a good set — that is, a 
consistency that isn’t too thick to spread or too runny. 
Commercial pectin basics
Commercial pectin is available in most supermarkets or where canning 
supplies are sold. Pectin may be in short supply in the spring and summer 
months because these are such popular times of year for canning. So be sure 
you have enough on hand before you start preparing your recipe.
Inspect the pectin container for water stains, holes, or any other sign that it’s 
come into contact with food (like food stuck to the package). Check to make 
sure the package is sealed and that it’s not past the use-by date. 
 
Using pectin after the date on the package may affect your final product 
because the quality of the pectin may have deteriorated. Pectin wasn’t always 
marked with a date. If your pectin container doesn’t provide an expiration 
date, don’t use it; it may be a sign that your product is extremely old.

80
Part II: Water-bath Canning 
Types of commercial fruit pectin
Pectin is available in two forms: liquid and powdered (dry). Although both 
products are made from fruit, they’re not interchangeable. Be sure to use the 
correct type and amount of pectin your recipe calls for.
Using liquid fruit pectin
Liquid pectin is usually made from apples. Today, a box contains two 3-ounce 
pouches. The most common brand is Certo. 
 
Liquid fruit pectin was originally sold in 6-ounce bottles. Older recipes may 
call for “one-half of a bottle.” If you read a pouch of liquid pectin today, it 
states, “1 pouch equals 
1⁄2 bottle.” 
Because you have to add your liquid pectin at the specified time and 
temperature, have it at the ready: Cut off the top of the pouch and stand it 
in a measuring cup or other container to keep it from spilling (see Figure 6-1). 
Then, when it’s time to add the liquid pectin, add it all at the same time, 
squeezing the pouch with your fingers like you do to get the last bit of 
toothpaste out of the tube. 
 
Figure 6-1: 
Getting a 
pouch of 
liquid 
pectin 
ready.
 
Using powdered (dry) fruit pectin
Powdered pectin is made from citrus fruits or apples. It comes in a box 
similar to a gelatin- or pudding-mix box and contains 1
3⁄4 ounces (the most 
commonly used size) or 2 ounces. Use the size stated in your recipe ingredients, 
and add it before you heat the fruit mixture. 
In addition to different sizes, powdered pectin comes in two varieties: 
fruit pectin for homemade jams and jellies, and fruit pectin for lower-sugar 
recipes. Use the variety your recipe calls for; they’re not interchangeable.

81
 Chapter 6: Sweet Spreads: Jams, Jellies, Marmalades, and More
Setting Up without Adding Pectin
Not all recipes require the addition of extra pectin. Some recipes cook the 
fruit mixture for a long period of time, which reduces the liquid in the mixture 
to achieve the desired consistency. 
For this process, you need patience and the knowledge of what to look 
for when testing your cooked product. Basically, you need to know what 
the spread’s gel point is. (Gel point is the cooking point at which jelly is 
considered done.) 
 
The gel point temperature is 8 degrees above boiling at an elevation of 1,000 
feet above sea level or lower (220 degrees). If you’re at an altitude higher 
than 1,000 feet above sea level, you can determine the temperature of your 
gel point by bringing a pot of water to a boil. When the water boils, check the 
temperature on your thermometer and add 8 degrees. This is the gel point for 
your altitude.
Use one of the following methods for testing the gel point:
 
✓ A candy thermometer: This is the most accurate method for testing the gel 
point of your spread. Use a thermometer that’s easy to read. One degree 
over or under the gel point makes a difference in your final product. 
 
 It’s a good idea to have two candy thermometers. They are inexpensive 
and critical for perfect jelly making. If one breaks, you’ll have a second 
one for backup during canning. 
 
✓ The spoon, or sheet, test (see Figure 6-2): Dip a cool metal spoon into 
your cooked fruit and hold it so the fruit runs off the spoon. When the 
temperature of the fruit approaches the gel point, it falls off in a couple 
of drops. When it slides off the spoon in one sheet, the fruit’s done. 
Proceed with your next step.
 
 This test takes a bit of practice to master. Until you master it, use a 
candy thermometer in conjunction with this test. When the temperature 
of the fruit climbs toward the gel point, you’ll be able to see the changes 
in the liquid and compare it to the sheeting from the spoon.
 
✓ The plate test (see Figure 6-2): Place about 1 tablespoon of cooked fruit 
onto a chilled plate. Put the plate in the freezer and cool the spread to 
room temperature. If the fruit is set and doesn’t roll around on the plate, 
the mixture is done. Proceed to your next step.

The Road to Sweet Canning Success
The only method for safely processing your sweet spreads, as approved by 
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is water-bath canning. The 
harmful bacteria and microorganisms living in high-acid foods are destroyed 
at the temperature of boiling water (212 degrees at 1,000 feet or lower above 
sea level) by sterilizing the food and vacuum-sealing the jar. For that reason, 
the recipes in the following sections all use water-bath canning. For complete 
details on water-bath canning, refer to Chapter 4.
Here are a couple of other tips to help you ensure your canning success:
 
✓ Stick with tested recipes. They’re always the best. Don’t experiment 
with different quantities of ingredients in any canning method. Quantity 
adjustments to your fruit or your sugar can seriously change the acid (pH 
level) in your food. And if the acidity changes, you may not use the correct 
home-canning method to produce a safe product, free from microorganisms.
 
✓ Always practice safe food-handling procedures. Complete each recipe, 
start to finish, without interruption. Any break between cooking your 
fruit to filling the jars and processing them may produce a product of 
inferior quality and one that may be unsafe for eating.
Jamming and canning
Jam is fun to make. It takes me (Karen) back to my childhood days when I 
created my own daily specials from crushed leaves, flowers, dirt, rocks, and 

83
 Chapter 6: Sweet Spreads: Jams, Jellies, Marmalades, and More
water. I’ve grown up, but I still love playing with food. My husband is pleased 
to report that I now use real food instead of dirt and rocks!
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on 
preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Hull and crush the strawberries. Clean the rhubarb; trim the ends and remove the 
leaves. Cut the rhubarb into 
1⁄2-inch pieces. 
 3 Combine the strawberries, rhubarb, lemon juice, and pectin powder in a large saucepan. 
Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the sugar, stirring to dissolve. 
Return the mixture to a full, rolling boil and boil hard for 1 minute. Remove the saucepan 
from the heat. Skim any foam from the surface with a foam skimmer, if necessary. 
 4 Ladle the boiling-hot jam into your hot jars, leaving 
1⁄4 inch headspace. Release any air 
bubbles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3), adding more jam as necessary 
to maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece 
caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 5 Process the filled pint jars in a water-bath canner for 20 minutes from the point of boil-
ing. (Note: It doesn’t matter if you have a less-than-full canner. Simply arrange the jars 
so that they’re evenly spaced, if possible.)
 6 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals. If you find jars that 
haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks.

Strawberry-Rhubarb Jam 
Strawberries and rhubarb go together famously. This jam is a great way to get your 
family to try rhubarb, and it makes a great gift. You can make it throughout the year 
because frozen rhubarb works just like fresh. 
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Processing time: 20 minutes
Yield: 3 pints
4 cups strawberries, crushed
2 
1⁄2 cups chopped rhubarb
1⁄4 cup lemon juice
One 1.75-ounce package pectin powder 
6 cups sugar

Jiggling with jelly
Jelly always has such a bright, cheerful look. It’s a great last-minute appetizer 
that doesn’t taste last-minute. Spoon a tart jelly, such as cranberry, over a 
block of cream cheese, allowing it to cascade over the sides. Serve it with 
rich, buttery crackers.
In order to achieve a bright, crystal-clear jelly, you need to properly strain 
your fruit. You can use a commercially manufactured stand and a jelly bag, or 
you can make your own by using a mesh strainer lined with several layers of 
cheesecloth (see Figure 6-3).
 
Dry fabric absorbs flavor from your fruit, weakening the flavor of your final 
product. Moisten your jelly bag (or cheesecloth) with cold water, wringing out 
any excess moisture before straining your liquid through it.

Herb Tea Jelly
Take your favorite herb teas one step further. Make them into jelly! This is a thin jelly, not 
thick like jam. Try your favorite herb tea blends and substitute a complimentary juice.

 1 Bring the water to a boil in a 3-quart saucepan over high heat. Remove the pan from the 
heat and steep the tea bags, covered, for 30 minutes.
 2 While the tea is steeping, prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw 
bands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For 
detailed instructions on preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 3 After your tea has steeped for 30 minutes, remove the tea bags from the water and stir 
in the sugar and apple juice. Boil the mixture for 2 minutes; then remove the pan from 
the heat and stir in the pectin. Boil for 2 more minutes. 
 4 Fill the prepared jars with boiling liquid, leaving 
1⁄4-inch headspace. Release any air bub-
bles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3), adding more liquid as necessary to 
maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, 
hand-tightening the bands.

Kumquat Marmalade
Kumquats have a thin, sweet skin and a very sour flesh. Eat a kumquat by popping the 
whole thing into your mouth and chew (watch out for the seeds). You have to slice the 
fruit by hand, but it’s worth the effort when you taste the fabulous flavor.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes

Condiments and Accompaniments: 
Chutneys, Relishes, and Sauces
In This Chapter
▶ Expanding your world of condiments and accompaniments
▶ Celebrating chutney
▶ Relishing your fruits and vegetables
▶ Spicing up your sauces
C
ondiments and accompaniments are to food what accessories are
 to clothing. They’re not necessary, but they enhance what’s there. 
They cover a wide range of flavors including savory, spicy, salty, sweet, or 
a combination. Think of them as the bright spot on an otherwise dull winter 
plate. 
In this chapter, we open the door to flavors and tastes from around the 
world. Chutneys are common in Asia and Middle Eastern countries, salsas are 
native to Mexico, and relish is very popular in North America. Expand your 
taste experience as you visit the world of fascinating and enticing flavors.
 
The water-bath canning principles and step-by-step instructions explained 
in Chapter 4 (and used in Chapters 5 through 8) apply to the recipes in this 
chapter. As always, use the freshest fruit and other products you need to 
make your recipes.

Complementing Your Chutney
Chutney is a condiment that contains fruit, vinegar, sugar, and spices. 
Chutneys range in flavor from sweet to spicy and mild to hot and have 
textures ranging from smooth to chunky. It usually accompanies curry 
dishes, but don’t limit it to that. Use chutney as a bread spread or with a 
slice of cheddar cheese on a cracker.
The first time I (Karen) heard the word chutney, I cringed. I thought, “What an 
awful name for a food.” Then I closed my eyes and took a bite. My taste buds 
didn’t believe the flavors they were sensing — sweet and spicy, no, tart, and 
a toasted nut? What was going on? From this early food experience, I vowed 
never to prejudge any food. I gladly welcome all new taste opportunities. 
A word about herbs
Dried herbs and spices are used extensively 
in this chapter. The best way to guarantee the 
freshness and quality of your herbs is to grow 
your own. It’s easy and doesn’t take much 
space, because herbs grow very well in pots 
or small areas. To preserve this bounty, dry or 
freeze your herbs. For information on drying, 
head to Chapter 19. Chapter 15 explains how to 
freeze herbs. But if you can’t — or don’t want 
to — grow your own, here are some tips for 
purchasing the best quality dried herbs 
possible:
 ✓ Buy small amounts. Purchase an amount 
you’ll use within six months to one year. 
Flavors deteriorate over time.
 ✓ Buy the amount you need. Stores that offer 
herbs and spices in containers where you 
can scoop out what you need are a great 
option. Check out the turnover rate; you 
don’t want to buy old products.
Whether you’re growing and drying your own 
herbs or buying them from a store, follow these 
storage and usage guidelines:
 ✓ Store dried herbs and spices in airtight 
containers. Glass or plastic jars are good 
choices, but make sure you screw the 
lid all the way back on. If you purchase 
cans, snap the lid in place to seal in the 
freshness.
 ✓ Keep your dried herbs and spices in a cool, 
dark, dry location. Sunlight and heat destroy 
flavor. Store your containers in a cabinet. 
(Don’t freeze them. The warming and cooling 
that happens when you take the herbs in and 
out of the freezer can lead to condensation 
and deteriorating of the herb.) 
 ✓ Inventory your dried herbs and spices at 
least once a year. Write the purchase date 
on the container. Discard any over one 
year old.

Green Tomato Chutney
This recipe is a great way to use your green tomatoes. It produces a super-thick chut-
ney that makes a great gift and looks lovely on the shelf. Although you’ll be eager to try 
the chutney as soon as it’s done, let it sit for one month before you use it, longer if you 
can to help develop the fine flavor. This recipe uses half-pint jars — the perfect size for 
a picnic basket! 
Preparation time: 1 hour 15 minutes
Processing time: 10 minutes
Yield: 8 half-pints
4 pounds green tomatoes, chopped
2 medium onions, chopped
1
1⁄2 green apples, peeled, cored, and chopped
1 cup golden raisins
1 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon ground red pepper 
1 teaspoon allspice
1 teaspoon curry, or to taste
1 cup brown sugar
2 cups cider vinegar

Reveling in Your Relish
Relish wears many hats and complements a wide variety of foods, from 
hamburgers and hot dogs, to meat and poultry. Relish is a cooked mixture of 
fruit or vegetables preserved with vinegar. Flavor can be sweet to savory and 
hot to mild with textures ranging from smooth to finely chopped or chunky. 
My family and I (Amy) like our relish to be a bit on the chunky side. That way, 
pieces of individual ingredients can still be seen. Either way, relish is a must-
have for your pantry. 
Toasting nuts
Toasted nuts are delicious and simple to 
make. Pay close attention during the toasting 
process. If the nuts become over toasted (very 
dark), there’s no going back. You have to start 
over. Toast more nuts than your recipe calls for 
and use them in salads. Store cooled nuts in an 
airtight container in the refrigerator.
This process takes only minutes (literally), so 
stay right by the oven.
 1. Spread your nuts evenly on a baking sheet 
and place it in a preheated 350-degree 
oven. 
 2. Set your timer for 3 minutes.
 
 The size of the nut determines the toasting 
time. Three minutes will be enough for 
some nuts, not enough for others. 
 3. After 3 minutes, check the nuts for 
doneness; shake or stir them. 
 
 If they’re a color you’re looking for, usually 
a light golden brown, remove them from the 
oven and cool them on the baking sheet. 
 4. If the nuts aren’t quite done, return them 
to the oven, checking them again in 2 
minutes. 
 
 Toasting takes place quickly. Your nuts are 
done, or close to being done, when you can 
smell their wonderful aroma. If the skin is 
on the nut, it’ll split to show you the color of 
the nut.
 5. Remove the finished nuts from the baking 
sheet to cool (if left on the sheet, they’ll 
continue to cook).
 
Summer Squash Relish
I (Karen) discovered this tasty relish when my best friend, Judy, planted six zucchini 
plants in her garden. At that time, we had no idea of the amount of squash those plants 
would produce! Including an overnight soak, this recipe takes two days to make.
Preparation time: 45 minutes plus 12 hours soaking time
Processing time: 15 minutes
Yield: 6 pints

95
 Chapter 7: Condiments and Accompaniments: Chutneys, Relishes, and Sauces
 1 On the first day, finely chop the zucchini and onions. (If you’re using a food processor, 
chop them in three batches.) Place the vegetables in a 5- to 6-quart mixing bowl and 
sprinkle them with the salt. Add water to cover them, place a cover on the bowl, and 
refrigerate overnight or at least 12 hours.
 2 On the second day, drain the vegetables in a colander. Rinse well with running water; 
drain. Transfer the vegetables to a 5- to 6-quart pot. Add the vinegar, sugar, pimientos, 
celery seed, mustard, cinnamon, nutmeg, and pepper. Stir to combine.
 3 Bring the vegetables to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce 
the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the mixture reduces to 3 quarts, about 30 to 40 
minutes. Stir the vegetables every 10 minutes to prevent sticking. The zucchini color 
turns a dull shade of green.
 4 While your relish is cooking, prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and 
screw bands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. 
(For detailed instructions on preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 5 Spoon the hot relish into your prepared jars, leaving 
1⁄4-inch headspace. Compact the 
relish with a spoon to release any air bubbles. Add more relish as necessary to maintain 
the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-
tightening the bands. 
 6 Process your filled jars in a water-bath canner for 15 minutes from the point of boiling. 
 7 Remove the jars from the boiling water with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen 
towel away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4 
for instructions). If you find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them 
within 2 months.
Vary It! Use 3 pounds of zucchini and 2 pounds of patty pan or yellow crookneck squash.

Satisfying Your Sassy Salsas and Sauces
Salsa is the Mexican word for “sauce.” Traditionally, salsa was made with 
tomatoes, cilantro, chilies, and onions and served at room temperature. 
Today, it’s readily available in most supermarkets in mild, hot, or fiery 
intensities and is used on almost any food.

heat, stirring to combine. Reduce the heat to low; simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
 3 Ladle your hot salsa into the prepared jars; leaving 
1⁄4-inch headspace. Release any air 
bubbles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3), adding more salsa as necessary 
to maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece 
caps, hand-tightening the bands.

 1 Place the raspberries in a 4- to 5-quart pot. Crush the berries with a potato masher. Add 
1
1⁄2 cups of the water and the lemon zest. Bring the mixture to a boil; reduce the heat 
and simmer 5 minutes. Strain the hot mixture through a jelly bag or a cheesecloth-lined 
mesh strainer.
 2 While the berries drain, prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw 
bands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For 
detailed instructions on preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 3 Place the sugar and the remaining 1
1⁄2 cups of water in a 4-quart saucepan. Bring the 
mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cook the mixture until 
the temperature registers 260 degrees on a candy thermometer. Add the strained ber-
ries and the corn syrup and return the mixture to a boil, boiling the syrup for 4 minutes. 
Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Remove any foam from the 
surface with a foam skimmer.
 4 Ladle your hot syrup into the prepared jars, leaving 
1⁄4-inch headspace. Release any air 
bubbles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3), adding more syrup as necessary 
to maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece 
caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 5 Process the filled jars in a water-bath canner for 10 minutes from the point of boiling. 
 6 Remove the jars from the boiling water with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen 
towel away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4 
for instructions). If you find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them 
within 2 months.
Vary It! Substitute other berries, or a combination of berries, for different syrup flavors.

P
ickling is used for a wide range of foods, 
including fruits and vegetables. Although 
pickling isn’t practiced much today, don’t overlook this rewarding process. 
This chapter gives you an overview of pickling, describing the ingredients, 
the utensils, and the methods used. In no time, you’ll be making easy-to-
prepare pickled food and condiments to wow your taste buds.
The Art of Pickling
Pickling preserves food in a brine solution, a strong mixture of water, salt, 
vinegar, and sometimes sugar or another sweetener, like corn syrup. Brining 
is what gives the vegetables the pickled texture and flavor you’re going for.
Some recipes (usually older ones) include a brining step before the actual 
canning. Other pickling recipes add the brine solution to the raw vegetable 
and the brining happens in the sterile canning jar as it sits on your shelf. 
These recipes generally have a recommendation for how many weeks to wait 
for best flavor.
The ingredients
The four basic ingredients for pickling are salt, vinegar, water, and herbs and 
spices. Use high-quality ingredients for the best results.

Part II: Water-bath Canning 
 
The perfect balance of salt, vinegar, water, and herbs and spices safely 
preserves your pickled food. You can achieve this balance by precisely 
measuring your ingredients and following each step in your recipe.
Salt
Salt is used as a preservative. It adds flavor and crispness to your food, 
especially pickles. Use a pure, additive-free, granulated salt. Acceptable salts 
are pickling and canning salt (a fine-grained salt containing no additives), 
most kosher salt, and sea salt, salt produced from evaporated seawater.
 
Additives in salt cause cloudy liquid. Always read the ingredient label on your 
salt container to ensure it’s additive-free. Salts not suitable for brining and 
pickling solutions are
 
✓ Table salt and iodized salt: These contain anti-caking agents, additives 
that keep the salt from sticking together. These cloud your liquid. Iodine 
darkens food.
 
✓ Rock salt: Rock salt keeps roads free of ice and isn’t made for use with 
food. It’s okay in an ice-cream freezer because it never touches the food.
 
✓ Salt substitutes: These products contain little or no sodium. 
Vinegar
Vinegar is a tart liquid that prevents the growth of bacteria. For pickling, you 
must use a vinegar with an acidity level of 5 percent. If the level of acidity 
isn’t on the label, don’t use the vinegar — the strength of the acid may not be 
adequate for safe food preservation. 
The preferred vinegar for pickling is distilled white vinegar, which has a 
sharp, tart flavor, maintains the color of your food, and is relatively inexpensive. 
For a milder flavor, you can substitute apple cider vinegar. Keep in mind, 
though, that using cider vinegar will change the overall color of your finished 
foods, not always for the better. You may get unappetizing gray or brown 
results from using the wrong type of vinegar. 
To avoid cloudy pickles, use a vinegar that’s clear from sediment. Cider and 
wine vinegars often have sediment, and you may even be able to see things 
floating around. What causes the sediment? Vinegars that still contain the 
mother, a harmless bacterium that creates the vinegar but also causes 
sediment to form on the bottom of the bottle. 
 
Never dilute or reduce the amount of vinegar in a recipe. To ensure a safe 
product, the brine must have the right acidity level. Never use a vinegar with 
less than 5 percent acidity.

101
 Chapter 8: Pickle Me Timbers!
 
If the flavor’s too tart, add 1/4 cup granulated sugar for every 4 cups of vinegar. 
Treating flavors in this manner won’t upset the balance of your vinegar. If you 
don’t like the flavor when you make the recipe, try another recipe. Don’t forget 
to jot down your changes on your recipe card! 
Water
Soft water is the best water for your brine solution. Too much iron in your 
water can cause discoloration of the finished product. Distilled water, water 
with all minerals and other impurities removed, is also a good choice. If you 
use tap water, make sure it’s of drinking quality; if it doesn’t taste good to 
you, it won’t taste better in your food. Also, avoid using sparkling water.
Herbs and spices
Use the exact amount of herbs or spices called for in your recipe. If your 
recipe calls for a fresh herb, use the fresh herb. If your recipe calls for a dried 
spice, use one with a strong aroma. (For more information on drying herbs 
and spices, check out Chapter 19.)
Pickling spices are blends of many spices including allspice, bay leaves, 
cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, ginger, mustard seed, and 
peppercorns. They’re mixed by the manufacturer and vary in flavor. Although 
these spices are generally whole and therefore good keepers, it is best to buy 
fresh, new spices each year, before you start canning. 
Brining education
The brining process is a key part of the pickling process because it does 
these important things:
 
✓ Chemically, it draws out the natural juices and replaces them with 
salty/vinegar solution, giving your veggies that familiar pickled flavor 
and texture. 
 
✓ It extracts juice and sugar from your food, forming lactic acid, a 
bitter-tasting tart acid. This lactic acid serves as the preservative in 
your pickled food.
 
✓ Because the brining solution typically includes vinegar (an acid), it 
safely converts your low-acid foods (those with a pH level over 4.6)
to high-acid foods (with a pH level of 4.6 or less), making it safe for 
water-bath canning. (This is why you must prepare your recipe as it’s 
written and not modify the amounts.).

102
Part II: Water-bath Canning 
As mentioned previously, sometimes you brine your vegetables before 
canning; other times, you add the brine solution to the raw vegetables and 
let the brining occur in the canning jar. The following sections explain how to 
prepare your veggies for each.
Fresh (or raw) packing: Adding brine to the raw veggies
In this method, you place fresh raw vegetables in prepared jars and then 
cover them with hot flavored liquid, usually a spicy vinegar, and process 
the filled jars in your water-bath canner. To ensure the pickling process can 
occur uniformly, make sure your vegetables are completely submerged in the 
brining solution. Most of the recipes in this chapter require raw packing. 
Complete precooking
In this method, you cook your food completely before filling your jars. The 
following relish recipe is precooked before canning. The taste of the relish is 
present before you add it to the jars, and it’s ready to eat once it is cooked. 
Brining before canning
When brining your vegetables beforehand, how long you let your vegetables 
soak can vary anywhere from a few hours to several weeks. Your recipe 
provides the details. Here’s what you need to know about these long or short 
brines:
 
✓ Long brine: This process is primarily used for making pickles from 
cucumbers. The veggies stay in the brine anywhere from 5 days to 6 
weeks. The brine solution is quite heavy with salt and may contain some 
vinegar and spices. None of the recipes in this chapter require a long 
brine.
 
✓ Short brine: The soaking period for this method is 24 hours or less. 
Follow your recipe for the correct proportions in your brine solution. 
You use a short brine for the Sweet Pickle Relish and Zucchini Bread and 
Butter Pickles.
In both cases, you submerge the food in the brine solution, where it ferments 
(stays in the solution) for the recommended period of time. (Your recipe 
gives you the details.) After fermenting, follow your recipe and make a fresh 
brine solution for filling your jars.
 
Be sure to keep your food completely submerged in the brine solution, 
whether it’s for a few hours or longer. To do this, place a sealed, water-filled 
glass jar on top of your food. The jar applies pressure to keep the foods 
submerged when you cover your brining container. 

103
 Chapter 8: Pickle Me Timbers!
Stoneware crocks are excellent choices for brining food. You can find them at 
specialty cookware stores or where canning supplies are sold. But there’s an 
important caveat: Don’t use a crock that you’ve gotten from a thrift store or 
other secondhand store. Without the original packaging, you have no way of 
knowing whether it’s lead-free and suitable for brining. 
 
Old-time canning recipes may instruct you to “soak your pickles in salt brine 
strong enough to float an egg.” This equates to a 10-percent brine mixture of 1 
pound (about 11/2 cups) of salt dissolved in 1 gallon of water.
Adding crunch to your food
The best method for maintaining crispness, crunch, and firmness in your 
vegetables during the soaking period is to add ice, preferably crushed ice, to 
your soaking solution. This works best for short brine soaking.
After the soaking period, drain your vegetables in a colander, following 
your recipe instructions for any rinsing. Some recipes instruct you to roll 
the drained food in clean kitchen towels to dry it. This works well for larger 
pieces of food (it isn’t for finely chopped relishes).
Note: In older pickling recipes, you may see the addition of alum or pickling 
(slaked) lime. The recipes in this chapter don’t add either of these products 
because they aren’t necessary when you’re using modern canning methods.
 
For the best tasting pickles, follow these four tips:
 
✓ Pick produce that is blemish free and pickle your produce within 24 
hours of harvesting. Never use vegetables that you have to trim off 
spoiled or moldy parts. 
 
✓ To ensure that every piece is pickled at the same time, always pack your 
jars with uniformly sized vegetables.
 
✓ Scrub the vegetables well to get rid of any dirt, which contains bacteria, 
and trim 
1⁄8 inch from the blossom and stem ends of cucumbers. These 
ends may have enzymes that will spoil or soften your pickles. 
 
✓ Pack your jars tightly. Because pickling causes vegetables to shrink 
slightly, having them tightly filled helps prevent them from floating. 

104
Part II: Water-bath Canning 
Pickling Equipment and Utensils
In addition to the basic equipment for water-bath canning (refer to Chapter 4), 
you need nonreactive utensils and equipment for handling, cooking, and 
brining your food. Nonreactive items are made of stainless steel, nonstick-
surfaced items (without a damaged nonstick surface), enamelware, or glass.
 
Don’t use enamelware with chips or cracks or equipment or utensils made 
from or containing copper, iron, or brass. These items react with the acids 
and salt during the pickling process, altering the color of your food and giving 
the finished product a bad taste. Definitely don’t use galvanized products, 
which contain zinc. These produce a poison when the acid and the salt touch 
the zinc, which is transferred to your food causing serious illness (or worse).
Pickled Toppers
Relish is a staple in many kitchens. Use this pickled treat anytime you’d use a 
relish, on a hamburger or hot dog, in tuna salad, or anytime you want to add 
flavor to a sandwich.
 
Sweet Pickle Relish
One advantage of homemade relish is mixing flavors you don’t find in commercially 
produced relishes. Make more than you believe your family will consume in a year 
because this relish has a way of disappearing. Try it in homemade Thousand Island 
dressing. 
Preparation time: 55 minutes plus 2 hours soaking time
Processing time: Halp-pints and pints, 10 minutes
Yield: 7 half-pints or 3 pints
5 to 6 medium cucumbers
3 to 4 green and/or red bell peppers
3 to 4 medium onions
1⁄4 cup kosher or pickling salt
Cold water, about 4 to 6 quarts
3 cups granulated sugar
2 cups cider vinegar
2 
1⁄2 teaspoons celery seeds
2 
1⁄2 teaspoons mustard seed
1⁄2 teaspoon turmeric

105
 Chapter 8: Pickle Me Timbers!
 1 Peel the cucumbers, cut them in half lengthwise, and remove the seeds (see Figure 8-1). 
Finely chop the cucumbers in a food processor fitted with a metal blade, to measure 6 
cups. Remove the stems and seeds from the bell peppers. Finely chop them in a food 
processor fitted with a metal blade, to measure 3 cups. Remove the skin of the onions. 
Finely chop them in a food processor fitted with a metal blade, to measure 3 cups.
 2 Combine the vegetables in a 5- to 6-quart bowl. Sprinkle them with salt and add cold 
water to cover them. Cover the bowl; let the veggies stand at room temperature for 2 
hours. Rinse the vegetables with running water in batches in a colander. Drain well.
 3 Combine the sugar, vinegar, celery seeds, mustard seeds, and turmeric in a 5- to 6-quart 
pot. Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. 
Add the drained vegetables and return the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to 
medium-high and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 30 minutes or until 
most of the excess liquid has evaporated.
 4 While your relish is cooking, prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and 
screw bands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. 
(For information on preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 5 Spoon and lightly compact the hot relish into the prepared jars. Release any air bubbles 
with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3), adding more relish and liquid as necessary 
to maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece 
caps, hand-tightening the bands.
 6 Process your filled jars in a water-bath canner for 10 minutes from the point of boiling. 
 7 Remove the jars from the boiling water with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (see Chapter 4). If you find jars 
that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two months.
Tip: This recipe is ready to eat as soon as you’re done precooking it. So save one jar to 
cool for dinner the night you make it.

Part II: Water-bath Canning 
Pickled Cucumbers Are Just Pickles
So what’s so important about what kind of cucumber you use for pickles? 
After all, a cucumber is a cucumber, right? This is definitely not the case. The 
common salad cucumber has a thick, dark-green, waxy skin. Don’t use this 
cucumber for making pickles because the brine solution won’t penetrate the 
waxy coating. Use this cucumber when your recipe doesn’t specify “pickling 
cucumbers.” 
 
A pickling cucumber is the only cucumber to use for making pickles. The skin 
of a pickling cucumber is thin, not waxy, and is left on the cucumber. Pickling 
cucumbers are about 4 inches in length, smaller than salad cucumbers. Don’t 
eat pickling cucumbers raw; their flavor can be extremely bitter. Some varieties 
are now sold for both pickling and slicing. These are fine to use. For pickling, 
use the smaller size of this variety; for slicing, use the larger size. Always look 
for cucumbers that are recommended for pickling, such as Kirby or Boston 
Pickling. 
 
Speedy Dill Pickles
This recipe makes an old-fashioned dill pickle in almost the blink of an eye. It’s an 
excellent confidence-builder for the beginning canner. Try it! 
Preparation time: 35 minutes 
Processing time: Pints, 10 minutes; quarts, 15 minutes
Yield: 6 pints or 3 quarts 
4 pounds pickling cucumbers
6 tablespoons kosher or pickling salt
3 cups distilled white vinegar
3 cups water
1 tablespoon whole mixed pickling spices
18 black peppercorns
3 tablespoons dill seed
Fresh dill springs (optional)

107
 Chapter 8: Pickle Me Timbers!
 1 Wash your cucumbers. Leave them whole if they’re smaller than 4 inches in diameter. 
For larger cucumbers, cut them into slices or lengthwise, in halves or quarters.
 2 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For information on preparing 
your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 3 Combine the salt, water, and vinegar in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan. Bring the liquid to a 
boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Keep the liquid hot over 
medium heat.
 4 Snuggly pack the cucumbers into your prepared jars. To each pint jar, add 
1⁄2 teaspoon 
of pickling spices, 3 peppercorns, and 1
1⁄2 teaspoons of dill seed. To each quart jar, add 
1 teaspoon of pickling spices, 6 peppercorns, and 1 tablespoon of dill seed. If you’re 
using fresh dill, add a sprig or two to each pint or quart jar in between the inside edge 
of the jar and the cucumbers.
 5 Ladle the hot liquid into your filled jars, leaving 
1⁄4-inch headspace in the pint jars and 
1/2-inch headspace in the quart jars. Completely submerge the cucumbers in the liquid. 
If they protrude from the jar, adjust them until you have the proper headspace, because 
the lids may not properly seal from the internal pressure. Release any air bubbles with 
a nonreactive tool (refer to Chapter 3), adding more liquid as necessary to maintain 
the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-
tightening the bands.
 6 Process your filled jars in a water-bath canner for 10 minutes (pints) or 15 minutes 
(quarts) from the point of boiling. 
 7 Remove the jars with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel away from drafts. 
After the jars cool completely, test the seals (see Chapter 4). If you find jars that haven’t 
sealed, refrigerate and use them within two months.
 8 Keep the pickles on the pantry shelf for at least two weeks for the taste to develop.
Vary It! For kosher-style dill pickles, add 2 cloves of peeled, halved garlic to each jar of 
pickles.

Part II: Water-bath Canning 
 1 Slice the zucchini into 
1⁄4-inch thick rounds. Peel the onions and cut them in half length-
wise from the tip to the bottom core. Lay them on a cutting board, cut side down; then 
slice them, starting at the top of the onion, to a thickness of 
1⁄4 inch. 
 2 Place the zucchini and onion slices in a 12-quart nonreactive stock pot. Sprinkle them 
with salt. Add ice water to cover the vegetables. Stir them once; then cover the bowl and 
let the veggies stand at room temperature for 3 hours. Transfer the veggies to a colander 
and rinse them thoroughly with running water (you may need to do this in more than one 
batch). Drain well. Roll the pieces in a clean, dry kitchen towel to partially dry them.
 3 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For information on preparing 
your jars, see Chapter 4.)

Pickled Vegetables
Pickled vegetables are delicious additions to green salads or a relish plate. 
Enjoy these treats for a change of pace from plain, raw vegetables. They still 
retain their crisp texture, but with an extra added bite from the brine.
 
Avoid long boiling periods for your vinegar solution. Lengthy boiling reduces 
the acetic-acid level in vinegar, changing the pH level of the food. This change 
may compromise the safety of your pickled food.

110
Part II: Water-bath Canning 
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the

 2 Combine the vinegar, water, and salt in a 6- to 8-quart pot. Bring the liquid to a boil over 
high heat; boil for 1 minute, stirring to dissolve the salt. Reduce the heat to low and 
keep the mixture hot.
 3 Pack the beans into the prepared jars (see Figure 8-2), leaving 
1⁄4-inch headspace (trim 
the tops of the beans, if necessary). Add the following to each jar: a sprig of dill, 1 garlic 
clove, 1 dried red chile pepper, 
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and 
1⁄4 teaspoon dill seed.
 4 Ladle the hot liquid over the beans, leaving 
1⁄4-inch headspace, covering the tops of the 
beans. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive tool (refer to Chapter 3), adding 
more liquid as necessary to maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the 
jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands.

 1 Trim your beets, leaving the taproots and 2 inches of the stems. Wash and drain the 
beets, using a stiff brush to remove any clinging soil. Cover the beets with water in a 
5- to 6-quart pot. Bring the water to a boil over high heat and cook the beets until they 
pierce easily with a fork, about 20 to 30 minutes. Drain the beets. Run cold water over 
them and remove the skin. Remove the stem and taproot. Slice the beets into 
1⁄4-inch-
thick slices. Place the beets in a bowl; set them aside.
 2 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the

your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 3 Place the onions, vinegar, water, sugar, salt, mustard seed, allspice, cloves, and cinna-
mon sticks in the pot. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat; reduce the heat and 
simmer for 5 minutes. Add your beet slices and simmer the mixture to heat the beets, 
about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the cinnamon stick pieces.
 4 Pack the hot beets and onions into the hot jars and ladle the hot liquid over the beets, 
leaving 
1⁄4-inch headspace. Release any air bubbles (refer to Chapter 3), adding more 
beets and liquid as necessary to maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal 
the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands.
 5 Process your jars in a water-bath canner for 30 minutes from the point of boiling. 
 6 Remove the jars with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel away from drafts. 
After the jars cool completely, test the seals (see Chapter 4). If you find jars that haven’t 
sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two months.

Spiced Pickled Beets
Use beets that are small and tender, not larger than 2 inches in diameter. Purchase beets 
with the top leaves attached. If the leaves are wilted and quite dark, the beets aren’t fresh; 
continue your search for fresher beets. Note: Once canned, these beets are ready for eating.

Processing time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 to 5 pints
4 pounds beets
3 cups thinly sliced white or yellow onions 
(about 3 medium)
2 
1⁄2 cups cider vinegar
1 
1⁄2 cups water
2 cups granulated sugar
1 teaspoon kosher or pickling salt
1 tablespoon mustard seed
1 teaspoon whole allspice
1 teaspoon whole cloves
3 cinnamon sticks, broken into pieces

Part II: Water-bath Canning 
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For information on preparing 
your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Wash the Brussels sprouts and remove any outer leaves that have insect damage or 
brown edges. Cook the sprouts for 5 minutes in boiling water and then dip them 
immediately into cold water. Drain.
 3 Pack the sprouts into your hot pint jars, leaving 
1⁄2-inch headspace. To each jar, add 
1
1⁄2 teaspoons dill weed. Combine the vinegar and salt and pour this solution over the 
sprouts, leaving 
1⁄2-inch headspace. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil 
(refer to Chapter 3), adding more liquid as necessary to maintain the proper headspace. 
Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands.
 4 Process the filled jars in a water-bath canner for 10 minutes from the point of boiling. 
 5 Remove the jars from the boiling water with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen 
towel away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (see Chapter 4). If 
you find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks.
 6 Let your pickled Brussels sprouts sit for two weeks so that the flavors can develop.

Part III
Pressure Canning

In this part . . .
T
he chapters in this part explore the world of pressure 
canning, the canning method you use to preserve 
vegetables, meat, poultry, seafood, and other low-acid 
foods. Preserving low-acid foods requires more care than 
processing high-acid foods (discussed in Part II), but the 
rewards are well worth the additional effort. With this 
part, you’ll safely be preserving your favorite low-acid 
foods in no time.

Chapter 9
Don’t Blow Your Top: 
Pressure Canning
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring pressure canning
▶ Selecting a pressure canner
▶ Understanding low-acid foods
▶ Processing low-acid foods to perfection
P
ressure canning is a process for preserving food with a low-acid content 
by exposing the food to a high temperature (240 degrees) under a spe-
cific pressure for a specific period of time in a specific type of pot: the pres-
sure canner. 
People who hear someone talking about pressure canning often ask, “Is it 
safe?” or “Won’t the pressure canner explode?” These concerns are certainly 
valid ones, but rest assured, when you know the right way to use a pressure 
canner, you can safely process a variety of low-acid foods. While pressure 
cookers and canners of the past may have once exploded if not closed prop-
erly, the new generation of canners and cookers are much lighter in weight 
and have built-in safety features that release steam if the pressure gets too 
high. None of your grandparents’ pressure cooking equipment had this. 
This chapter leads you step by step through the pressure-canning process, 
including an explanation of pressure canning, what to look for when purchasing 
a pressure canner, and how to fill your canner and safely process your 
filled jars.
 
Only one form of canning — pressure canning — is approved for safely 
processing low-acid foods. And only one piece of equipment — a pressure 
canner — is approved for safely processing low-acid foods. Don’t allow 
yourself to think you can use a substitute process or piece of equipment.

118
Part III: Pressure Canning 
Understanding the Fuss 
about Low-Acid Foods
Low-acid foods contain little natural acid and require more care during the 
canning process than other types of foods. (If you’re a techie, note that 
low-acid foods are foods with a pH factor — that’s a measure of acidity in 
food — higher than 4.6.) Foods in this category include vegetables, meats, 
poultry, seafood, and combination foods (like soups, meat sauces, and 
salsas) that contain low-acid and high-acid ingredients. Exceptions to these 
low-acid foods sometimes include tomatoes, which are really a fruit and 
can be water-bath canned (although for safety’s sake, you still add acid to 
tomatoes) and vegetables converted to high-acid foods such as sauerkraut, 
pickles, or pickled vegetables (discussed in Chapter 8).
 
Low-acid foods require pressure canning to kill microorganisms that are 
harmful if not destroyed before ingesting the food. Pressure canning at 240 
degrees kills the botulism bacteria. If this temperature isn’t achieved and the 
bacteria isn’t destroyed, one taste of this spoiled food can kill you. And to 
make matters worse, these botulism-causing bacteria are odorless, have no 
taste, and actually thrive in low-acid foods that are in a moist environment and 
not in contact with air — the exact condition provided in a jar of canned food. 
Simply boiling food on the stovetop will not kill any botulism and should not 
be considered a safety step. 
 
In a water-bath canner, the temperature of boiling water never increases 
above 212 degrees (the boiling point for water). While 212 degrees is fine for 
water-bath canning high-acid foods, it’s not sufficient to safely can low-acid 
foods. For that, you need to superheat your filled jars to a temperature of 240 
degrees, which only a pressure canner can achieve. Be sure to use a pressure 
canner that’s approved for pressure canning by the United States Department 
of Agriculture (USDA).
Choosing Your Pressure Canner
A pressure canner, shown in Figure 9-1, is a heavy kettle made for processing 
home-canned food. It includes a locking, tight-fitting cover that makes the 
kettle airtight. The purpose of pressure canning is to sterilize the food by 
destroying hard-to-kill microorganisms, especially the bacteria that cause 
botulism (see Chapter 3).

119
 Chapter 9: Don’t Blow Your Top: Pressure Canning
 
Figure 9-1: 
A pressure 
canner.
 
 
Don’t confuse pressure canners with pressure cookers. A pressure canner is 
used to process and sterilize home-canned, low-acid foods. The purpose of a 
pressure cooker is to cook food fast. Check out Pressure Cookers For Dummies, 
by Tom Lacalamita (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), for the low down on pressure cook-
ing. Pressure canners and pressure cookers are not interchangeable. Pressure 
cookers are not large enough to hold the jars and the amount of water neces-
sary to can properly. They also do not have pressure gauges that allow you to 
maintain the constant pressure required. 
When shopping for a pressure canner, keep these things in mind:
 
✓ Size: Pressure canners come in many sizes, holding from 4- to 19(!)-quart 
jars. For the home canner, however, a pressure canner with a capacity 
of 16 to 22 quarts is fine. This size holds seven 1-quart jars and permits 
good air circulation during processing. 
 
✓ Price: The cost of a pressure canner may vary from $100 on the low end 
to upward of $600. Some reasons for the variance are size, features, and 
reputation of the manufacturer. 
 
 When making your purchasing decision, study your options and estimate 
how frequently (or infrequently) you plan to pressure-can. You may 
even consider co-owning a pressure canner with a friend. If you’re 
buying a pressure canner secondhand, take it to your local county 
extension office to have it checked for proper seal and be sure it’s still 
safe to use. 

120
Part III: Pressure Canning 
 
✓ Features: All pressure canners — regardless of features — safely 
process your filled jars of low-acid food in the same manner because 
a pressure canner operates in only one way. Each pressure canner 
has a locking cover, a pressure gauge, and an overpressure plug. 
Manufacturers of pressure canners, however, slightly vary the same 
features and add accessories in much the same way car manufacturers 
add extras to a basic car model. 
The following sections explain the different features various pressure canners 
offer so that you can determine which features you prefer. The type of pres-
sure canner you choose doesn’t matter as long as the model is made and 
approved for processing home-canned foods.
 
No matter which type or size of pressure canner you choose, the goal is 
always the same: to superheat and process low-acid food at a high temperature 
(240 degrees) that destroys microorganisms.
Cover: With a gasket or without
You can find two types of covers for pressure canners: a lock-on cover and 
a metal-to-metal cover that’s attached with wing nuts. The difference is that 
one has a rubber gasket to ensure an airtight seal; the other one doesn’t. For 
a beginner, a lock-on cover is the easiest and most fail-proof to use. 
Lock-on cover
A lock-on cover (see Figure 9-2) usually has a rubber gasket between the 
cover and the base unit to ensure to the airtight seal. To securely fasten the 
cover to the pressure canner, rotate the cover on the base to the locked 
position (matching up the handles or matching arrows or other markings 
on the unit) or with a type of clamping handle. To ensure that the pressure 
canner is properly closed, refer to your owner’s manual for precise instructions.
 
Figure 9-2: 
A lock-on 
cover and 
rubber 
gasket.
 

121
 Chapter 9: Don’t Blow Your Top: Pressure Canning
 
Over time, the rubber gasket may stretch out of shape or begin to rot and 
deteriorate (indicated by cracking or splitting). If your gasket is in this 
condition, don’t use your pressure canner until you’ve replaced the gasket. A 
gasket in poor condition may prevent the canner from reaching the pressure 
required to superheat the food and kill microorganisms.
 
After each use, carefully remove the gasket from the cover. Thoroughly wash 
the gasket in hot, soapy water and dry it well. After the gasket is completely 
dry, put it back on the cover so that your pressure canner is always ready for 
use. Some manufacturers suggest lightly coating the gasket with cooking oil, 
but check your owner’s manual before doing this.
Metal-to-metal cover with wing nuts
A metal-to-metal cover (see Figure 9-3) doesn’t require a gasket to create a 
tight seal; instead, this pressure canner uses wing nuts. To secure a cover 
with wing nuts, tighten two wing nuts on opposite sides of the canner at the 
same time by hand (don’t use a tool and don’t tighten one side at a time). 
Repeat this process for the remaining wing nuts. 
 
Never tighten one nut at a time because uneven results will occur. If your wing 
nuts aren’t tightened properly, as soon as the pressure starts to rise, water 
leaks out. You then have to carefully remove the canner from the heat and 
wait for the pressure to subside before untightening and retightening all over 
again.
 
Figure 9-3: 
A metal-to-
metal cover 
with wing 
nuts.
 
Every year, check for nicks and dents in the rim of both the lid and the 
canner itself. These imperfections will prevent the canner from making a seal. 

122
Part III: Pressure Canning 
Gauges
Gauges are located on the top of the pressure canner cover and regulate 
pressure within the canner. Two types of gauges are available: a weighted 
gauge and a dial gauge (see Figure 9-4). A dial gauge indicates the pressure 
of the canner, while a weighted gauge indicates and regulates the pressure of 
the contents. If you’re a beginner, go with the weighted gauge.
 
Figure 9-4: 
The two 
types of 
gauges 
available 
on pressure 
canners: A 
dial gauge 
and a 
weighted 
gauge.
 
Weighted gauge
A weighted gauge is simple and accurate. It’s sometimes referred to as an 
automatic pressure control or a pressure regulator weight. This gauge allows 
you to cook without looking: The weighted gauge automatically controls the 
pressure by jiggling as the canner reaches the correct pressure. When the 
pressure in the canner is too high, the weighted gauge jiggles faster, and may 
hiss, as it releases excess steam from the canner.
A weighted gauge has a preset control that needs no service or testing to 
ensure an accurate pressure measurement. The pressure settings are indicated 
by three numbers marked on the gauge (refer to Figure 9-4): 5, 10, and 15. 
The numbers represent the pounds per square inch (psi) of pressure created 
by the trapped steam from the boiling water in the pressure canner. 
 
The most common pressure used in pressure canning is 10 pounds, but never 
guess — always refer to your recipe.

123
 Chapter 9: Don’t Blow Your Top: Pressure Canning
Dial or steam pressure gauge
A dial or steam pressure gauge (refer to Figure 9-4) is a numbered instrument 
that indicates the pressure in the canner. You have to watch dial gauges 
carefully to be sure they don’t rise too high, and you have to turn the heat up 
or down to keep the pressure in the right area.
Unlike the weighted gauge that requires no service, you must check this 
control for accuracy each season or at least once every year of use. To obtain 
service, refer to your owner’s manual for service locations, check with the 
store where you purchased the canner, or contact your local cooperative 
extension services (see Chapter 22).
 
If your annual service shows that your dial gauge is off by 5 or more pounds, 
replace the gauge. An inaccurate reading may not produce the temperature 
required to kill all microorganisms. You can have your canner checked for 
a nominal fee, if not free, at your local hardware store or county extension 
office. 
Vent tube, pipe vent, or petcock
Whatever the name of this feature — vent tube, pipe vent, or petcock — the 
function is the same (see Figure 9-5). These terms refer to an opening in the 
pressure-canner cover for emitting steam. Sometimes the weighted gauge sits 
on the vent tube.
 
Figure 9-5: 
A vent tube.
 

124
Part III: Pressure Canning 
 
To work properly, the vent tube opening cannot be obstructed with food or 
other matter. Obstructions restrict the optimum pressure and temperature 
required for your recipe. To check the vent for obstructions, hold it up to the 
light. If the vent appears to be clogged, insert a piece of wire (or other item 
suggested in your owner’s manual) into the tube. Rinse the vent with hot 
water. Repeat the procedure if you still see an obstruction.
Overpressure plug
An overpressure plug (see Figure 9-6) releases (pops up) if too much pressure 
exists in your pressure canner due to a blocked vent tube. The overpressure 
plug is a safety feature that’s solely for your protection. If you follow the 
instruction manual for your pressure-canner operation, chances are this plug 
will never be used. 
 
Figure 9-6: 
An 
over-
pressure 
plug.
 
Rack
Your pressure canner should come with a rack. (If the rack is missing, contact 
the store where you made your purchase.) The perfect rack lies flat in the 
bottom of your canner and has lots of holes and openings that allow steam to 
circulate around your filled jars. Figure 9-7 is an example of a canner rack.
 
Figure 9-7: 
A rack for 
holding jars 
in the 
bottom of 
your 
pressure 
canner.
 

125
 Chapter 9: Don’t Blow Your Top: Pressure Canning
 
Make sure your rack is stable when you place it in the bottom of the canner. A 
stable rack holds jars in place, thus preventing the jars from tipping, touching 
other jars, or touching the sides of the canner.
A-Canning You Will Go: Instructions 
for Successful Pressure Canning
In order to ensure a processed product of high quality, free from microorganisms, 
be sure to follow each step in this section. Don’t omit or modify any part. You 
may spend a bit more time canning low-acid foods with a pressure canner 
than you would canning high-acid foods in a water-bath canner, but the end 
result is worth the extra effort.
 
In this section, you begin your journey of pressure-canning low-acid foods. 
Avoid any temptation to omit any step or portion of any step in the process. 
Each step is important to produce safe, home-canned foods.
 
If you’ve never used a pressure canner before, do a trial run with no jars: Heat 
up the canner and go through the steps of pressurizing and depressurizing to 
familiarize yourself with the sounds the pressure canner makes as it builds 
and then releases pressure. You’ll hear the steam escaping, the weight gauge 
shaking, and the ticking of the canner as it heats and cools; if you don’t know 
what to expect, you could misinterpret these noises as scary or wrong.
Step 1: Gearing up
At least a couple of weeks before you want to use it, check your pressure 
canner and replace any gasket or missing part, have a dial gauge checked 
professionally, and replace a missing manual. Also count your jars and 
two-piece caps and examine the jars for nicks or chips, the screw bands for 
proper fit and corrosion, and the new lids for imperfections and scratches. 
It’s also a good idea to select your recipe, and inventory your pantry for any 
nonperishable ingredients, adding any needed items to your shopping list. 
Your goal is to have all the supplies you need and your pressure canner in 
good working order on the day you’re ready to can.
 
Preparing your pressure canner before the actual canning season means you 
will not find the store out of supplies and the extension agent too busy to 
check your gauge in time to begin canning when the produce is ripe.

126
Part III: Pressure Canning 
On the actual canning day, get your tools ready by following these steps:
 
1. Assemble your prechecked equipment and utensils.
 
 In addition to your pressure canner and the standard canning supplies 
(jars with two-piece lids), other items can make your canning easier: 
things like a food scale, extra pans for cooking your veggies and keeping a 
water reserve on hand, a wide-mouth funnel, and so on. Head to Chapter 
2 for a list of canning supplies.
 
2. Wash your jars and screw bands in warm, soapy water, rinsing well to 
remove any soap residue. 
 
 Double-check for nicks and dents and discard any damaged items.
 
3. Place your clean jars and lids in a kettle of hot — not boiling — water 
until you’re ready to fill them.
 
 Never boil the lids because the sealant material may be damaged and 
won’t produce a safe vacuum seal.
 
4. Ready your canner by filling it with 2 to 3 inches of water and heating 
the water.
 
Always read the manufacturer’s instructions for your pressure canner and 
follow them to the letter.
Also, assemble the other canning items you need. You can find a complete 
list in Chapter 2.
Step 2: Preparing your food
Always start with food of the highest, freshest quality. Food that’s spoiled or 
bruised doesn’t improve in quality during the pressure-canning process! To 
prepare your food for pressure canning, follow these steps:
 
1. Wash all food prior to packing it in the jars or precooking it. 
 
 For detailed instructions on washing your food, refer to Chapter 3.
 
2. Thoroughly cut away all evidence of spoilage or discard any inferior 
products.
 
3. Prepare the food by precisely following your recipe.
 
 Some recipes call for you to fill your jars with raw food; others may want 
you to precook the food. If you’re precooking your low-acid food before 
filling your jars, don’t discard the cooking liquid; use this liquid for filling 
your jars.

127
 Chapter 9: Don’t Blow Your Top: Pressure Canning
 
Work in manageable batches. To determine just what a “manageable batch” is, 
consider how much food fills one canner load at a time. Most recipes are 
geared for manageable batches, but if you’re in doubt, check the yield for the 
recipe.
Step 3: Filling your jars
Always place your product into hot jars (you keep them hot by leaving them 
in a kettle of hot water, as explained in the earlier section “Step 1: Gearing up.”) 
To fill your jars, follow these steps:
 
1. Remove a jar from the kettle and pack the food into the jar so that the 
food is snug, yet loose enough for liquid to circulate into the open 
spaces.
 
2. Ladle boiling water (or the liquid from precooking the vegetables) 
into the jars, leaving the amount of headspace stated in your recipe. 
 
 If you’re adding cooking liquid, divide the cooking liquid evenly among 
the jars and finish filling the jars with boiling water, if necessary. That 
way, if you run short of the cooking liquid, you won’t have one jar filled 
with only boiling water.
 
3. Release any air bubbles with a nonmetallic spatula or a tool to free 
bubbles.
 
 If the headspace drops, add additional food and liquid to the jar.
 
4. Wipe the jar rims with a clean, damp cloth. 
 
 Have a few rags handy to be sure you’re using a clean one every time. 
 
5. Place a lid on the jar (seal side down) and secure the lid in place with 
a screw band.
 
 Hand-tighten the band without overtightening it.
 
Always work quickly, stopping for nothing. Time is of the essence! Your hot 
foods need to remain hot, your lids seal best if placed on the jars while hot, 
and your food needs to be processed as quickly as possible to preserve the 
most flavor and quality.
Step 4: Placing the jars in the canner
Place your filled and closed jars carefully on the rack in the pressure canner, 
making sure you have the recommended amount of simmering water in the 

128
Part III: Pressure Canning 
bottom of the canner. Don’t crowd the jars or place more jars in the canner 
than is recommended for your size of pressure canner. Place them so that 
they’re stable, won’t tip, and don’t touch each other or the side of the canner. 
 
If your recipe makes more jars than your canner can hold, only fill enough jars 
for one canner load and do the rest in the next batch. Do not fill all the jars 
and leave a few waiting for the next canner load. 
 
Unlike water-bath canning (see Chapter 4), you can process a second layer of 
pint or half-pint jars at the same time as long as your canner accommodates 
the height of the two layers. To build the second layer, place a second rack 
on top of the first layer of jars. Stagger the second layer of jars so they aren’t 
directly above the bottom layer. This permits proper air circulation for 
achieving the proper pressure and temperature. After you have a few simple 
canning sessions successfully under your belt, try this technique to save a 
little time. 
Step 5: Closing and locking the canner
For optimum performance, steam must be allowed to steadily escape from 
the canner for a specified period. This process is called exhaustion. Properly 
closing and locking your pressure canner ensure that exhaustion can take 
place. Closely follow your owner’s manual when closing and locking the 
pressure canner. (If not sealed properly, the canner won’t build pressure 
and/or hot water will spit out.)
Step 6: Processing your filled jars
Once your canner lid is locked on, you’re ready to beginning processing your 
filled jars. Follow these steps:
 
1. Allow a steady stream of steam to escape from the pressure canner for 
10 minutes or the time recommended in your manual.
 
2. Close the vent, bringing the pressure to the amount specified in your 
recipe.
 
 If you live in higher altitudes, see the section “Pressure Canning at 
Higher Altitudes” for information on how to adjust the pounds of pres-
sure used during processing.
 
 Processing time starts when your canner reaches the required pressure. 
The pressure must remain constant for the entire processing time.  
If your pressure drops at any time during processing, so will your tem-
perature. To remedy this problem, return the pressure to the specified 
amount by increasing the heat. After your pressure has been regained, 
start your processing time from the beginning.

129
 Chapter 9: Don’t Blow Your Top: Pressure Canning
 
3. After the processing time has passed, turn the heat off and allow the 
pressure to return to 0.
 
 Allowing the pressure to return to 0 may take as long as 30 minutes. 
Don’t disturb the canner; jars that are upset may not seal properly.
Step 7: Releasing the pressure 
after processing
Approximately 10 minutes after the pressure returns to 0, or at the time 
stated in the manual, remove the lid, opening the cover away from you and 
allowing the steam to flow away from you.
We can’t emphasize enough the importance of following the instructions in 
your owner’s manual, step by step, for releasing the pressure in the canner 
after your processing time is concluded. There’s no quick-release method for 
a pressure canner as there is for a pressure cooker. Don’t confuse the two!
 
Running water over your pressure canner to reduce the pressure is a definite 
no-no. The sudden change in temperature can cause the jars to burst.
Step 8: Removing and cooling the jars
Ten minutes after you release the pressure (Step 7), remove the jars from 
the pressure canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean towel, away from 
drafts with 1 to 2 inches of space around the jars.
The jars may take as long as 24 hours to completely cool. Don’t be tempted 
to play with the lids or adjust the bands. 
 
As your jars cool, you’ll hear a popping noise coming from them, indicating a 
vacuum seal. You will soon learn to look forward to these tiny pings and dings. 
My children (Amy’s) often give a shout each time they hear one. This canning 
music means you have successfully saved your summer bounty. 
Step 9: Testing the seal and 
storing your bounty
The final pressure-canning step is to test the seals on your completely 
cooled jars: Push on the center of the lid. If the lid feels solid and doesn’t 
indent, you’ve produced a successful seal. If the lid depresses when applying 
pressure, this jar isn’t sealed. Refrigerate any unsealed jars immediately, 
using the contents within two weeks or the period stated in your recipe. 

130
Part III: Pressure Canning 
To store jars, do the following:
 
1. Remove the screw bands of the sealed jars.
 
2. Remove any residue by washing the jars, lids, and bands in hot, soapy 
water; then dry them.
 
3. Label your jars with the content and date of processing.
 
4. Store the jars without the screw bands, in a cool, dark, dry place.
Disposing of Spoiled Products
Although you may follow all the steps and procedures for pressure canning 
low-acid foods (see the preceding section), you still have a chance for spoilage. 
Knowing the signs to look for is part of the food-preservation process. 
Here are some visual signs that may indicate a spoiled product:
 
✓ A bulging lid or a broken seal
 
✓ A lid that shows signs of corrosion
 
✓ Food that has oozed or seeped under the lid
 
✓ Gassiness, indicated by tiny bubbles moving upward in the jar
 
✓ Food that looks mushy, moldy, or cloudy
 
✓ Food that gives off an unpleasant or disagreeable odor when the jar is 
opened
 
✓ Spurting liquid from the jar when the seal is broken
 
Storing your sealed jars without the bands allows you to see any signs of food 
seepage that indicates a potentially spoiled product.
 
As discussed in Chapter 3, botulism poisoning can be fatal. Because botulism 
spores have no odor and can’t be seen, you can’t always tell which jars are 
tainted. If you suspect that a jar of food is spoiled, never, never, never taste it. 
Instead, dispose of the food responsibly.
When you need to dispose of spoiled low-acid foods, use one of the two dis-
posal methods described in the following sections. The first method is for 
sealed jars and second is for jars with broken seals.

131
 Chapter 9: Don’t Blow Your Top: Pressure Canning
If your jar is still sealed
If the jar has the seal intact, you can simply place your container in a garbage 
bag, tie it tightly, and discard it in the trash. This keeps the product from 
coming in contact with any human or animal and eliminates the transfer of 
bacteria. Be sure to thoroughly wash your hands and any surface that may 
have come in contact with spoiled food or its juices.
If your jar has a broken seal
If you see signs that the seal is broken or not tight, place the jar, the lid, the 
screw band, and the contents of the jar in a deep cooking pot. Cover the 
items with 1 to 2 inches of water, taking care not to splash any of the 
contents outside of the pot (this can cause cross-contamination with other 
foods in your household).
Cover the pot with a tight-fitting cover. Bring the contents to a boil. Keep the 
contents boiling for 30 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the contents to 
cool while remaining covered. Discard the contents in a sealed container in 
the trash or bury them deeply in the soil. 
 
Never pour the contents into a water source, a sink or garbage disposal, or 
down the toilet, because the contents may come into contact with humans or 
animals through a water-reclamation process.
Using a solution made up of one part household chlorine bleach to four 
parts tepid (lukewarm) water, thoroughly wash all equipment, working 
surfaces, clothing, and body parts that may have come in contact with the jar 
or spoiled food. You may also add dishwashing soap. Dispose of the jar, the 
lid and screw band, and any sponges or dishcloths used in any phase of this 
process by wrapping the items in a trash bag, sealing the bag, and placing it 
in the trash. 
Pressure Canning at Higher Altitudes
If you’re canning at an elevation higher than 1,000 feet above sea level, adjust 
the pounds of pressure used during processing, according to Table 9-1. Your 
pressure-canner processing time will remain the same.

In This Chapter
▶ Organizing your vegetables
▶ Filling your jars: raw packing versus hot packing
▶ Processing vegetables perfectly
▶ Preparing nutritious meals from your canned vegetables
D
on’t you just love the time of year when 
you’re starting your garden — preparing 
the soil, sowing seeds, pulling weeds, looking for 
pests, and asking the gardening gods for perfect 
weather and an abundant harvest? Then, after 
months of hard work and dirty fingernails, you’re 
rewarded with fresh vegetables. At first, your 
garden produces enough each day for one or two 
meals, and then the explosion starts. Tomatoes, 
zucchini, and beans, to name a few, abound. You 
wonder, “How can just a few plants produce so 
many vegetables?” You’re proud to share your 
bounty with friends, neighbors, and coworkers, 
but there’s a limit to how much you can give away!
Now, reality sets in. You have to do something 
with this harvest or it will go to waste! It’s time to get out your pressure 
canner, check your equipment, and get busy pressure canning. You must 
act quickly if you plan to preserve these vegetables for use in the winter and 
spring.
This chapter gives you basic information on selecting and preparing your 
vegetables, understanding which packing method (raw or hot) works best, 
knowing the correct pressure and processing times, and using the proper jar 
sizes for your vegetables.

Part III: Pressure Canning 
Selecting Your Vegetables
When choosing your vegetables, be picky. The quality of your final product 
is affected by the quality of the food you start with. You can find specific 
guidelines of what to look for for each particular vegetable in the “Pressure 
Canning Vegetables” section of this chapter. 
Picking the perfect produce
Whether harvesting your vegetables from the garden or shopping at a farmer’s 
market or your local supermarket, select vegetables that are free of bruises 
and imperfections. These marks could encourage the growth of bacteria in 
your food. Follow this basic rule for evaluating damage on vegetables for 
canning: If you won’t eat that portion of the vegetable, don’t buy it and can it.
The key to keeping all this wonderful, perfect freshness? Process the 
vegetables the day of harvesting or purchasing — the sooner the better. If 
you need to wait a day, store the items in your refrigerator to preserve the 
quality and prevent deterioration of your food. Don’t make your vegetables 
wait longer than one day! For more information on how to successfully 
process your canned vegetables, head to the section “Processing Tips for 
Successful Results.”
 
Even if you don’t have a garden (or access to one), you can find vegetables 
of high quality at your local farmer’s market or supermarket. Purchasing 
vegetables in season (when they’re abundant) is usually the best time to find 
the best pricing. Look for vegetables that are locally grown — they’ll taste 
fresher and won’t be covered with wax that prolongs the life of veggies.
Vegetables not recommended 
for pressure canning
Some vegetables shouldn’t be preserved by pressure canning because the 
food may discolor, produce a stronger flavor when canned, or just lose its 
look (meaning it disintegrates or falls apart when placed under high heat and 
high pressure). Other methods, such as pickling (see Chapter 8) or freezing 
(see Chapter 13), may be better preserving choices for these foods. Table 10-1 
lists some vegetables you may be tempted to pressure-can but that will 
preserve better in other ways.

Prepping Your Veggies
You can prepare your clean vegetables for filling your jars in two ways: raw 
pack or hot pack. Not all vegetables are suited for both methods. Follow your 
recipe instructions or check out the “Pressure Canning Vegetables” section in 
this chapter.
Cleaning your vegetables
Properly cleaning your vegetables is important to your finished product 
(refer to Chapter 3 for more on cleaning vegetables). The method and 
amount of cleaning required is determined by where the vegetables were 
grown: above the ground (like beans or squash) or in the ground (like 
carrots or beets).
 
✓ Vegetables growing above the ground: These vegetables usually have a 
thinner, more tender skin than vegetables grown in the ground. Remove 
any stems and leaves. Run water over them, gently rub the skin with your 
fingers and remove any dirt. Shake off the excess water and place 
your food on clean kitchen or paper towels.

136
Part III: Pressure Canning 
 
✓ Vegetables growing in the ground: Root vegetables, such as carrots 
and beets, may require soaking to loosen any clinging soil. After first 
rinsing the vegetables, immerse them in a basin of cool water. Using a 
stiff brush (a new toothbrush works well), scrub the surface of the 
vegetables, removing any clinging soil. Rinse thoroughly with running 
water, placing the vegetables on clean kitchen or paper towels to drain.
Raw packing versus hot packing
Raw packing and hot packing foods refers to the way the food is treated 
before it is placed in the jars. In raw packing, you don’t cook the food prior 
to processing. In hot packing, you do. The following sections go into more 
details on which method is preferable when you’re canning vegetables. 
 
Packing food raw or hot doesn’t change your processing time. Reaching the 
required pressure in your canner, usually 10 pounds, takes the same amount 
of time, regardless of the temperature of your raw- or hot-packed jars.
Raw (cold packing)
The raw packing (also called cold packing) method uses raw, unheated 
vegetables for filling your prepared jars. Filling the jars with raw vegetables 
keeps them firm without being crushed during processing. Refer to your 
recipe instructions to decide whether to remove the skin or cut the vegetables 
into pieces.
Disadvantages of using raw vegetables include the following:
 
✓ Floating food: During the pressure-canning process, air is removed from 
the vegetable fiber, causing the food to shrink. With more room in the 
jars, the vegetables have room to float toward the top of the jar (this is 
called floating food). Floating food doesn’t affect the quality of your final 
product, but it may be unattractive.
 
✓ Discoloring: Discoloring occurs when the food comes in contact with air 
in the jar, causing a color change in your food after two or three months 
of storage. The flavor of your product is not affected, but the change in 
color in a portion of the food may appear odd.

137
 Chapter 10: Preserving the Harvest: Just Vegetables
To fill your jars using a raw packing method, follow these instructions:
 
1. Wash your vegetables.
 
2. Prepare the hot liquid (refer to your recipe) for filling your jars.
 
3. Fill the hot, prepared jars with your raw vegetables.
 
4. Add the hot liquid and canning salt, if required.
 
5. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive tool (refer to Chapter 3).
 
 If the headspace in your jar drops, add additional food and liquid to 
maintain the headspace stated in your recipe.
 
6. Wipe the jar rims; add the two-piece caps, and process the filled jars 
in a pressure canner (see Chapter 5).
Hot packing 
When you hot pack, you precook or heat your vegetables prior to placing 
them in your prepared canning jars. It’s the preferred method for the majority 
of vegetables, particularly firm ones, such as carrots and beets. Using 
precooked vegetables improves the shelf life of the processed food by 
increasing the vacuum created in the jar during the pressure-canning period.
Precooking your vegetables in a boiling liquid, usually water, preshrinks the 
food and makes it more pliable, which allows you to pack more food into 
your jars. This results in using fewer jars. The method is a simple one:
 
1. Wash your vegetables.
 
2. Heat your liquid to a boil in a large pot and add the vegetables, 
precooking them as directed in your recipe.
 
3. Immediately fill your prepared jars with the hot vegetables, followed 
with the hot cooking liquid.
 
4. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive tool.
 
 If the headspace in your jar drops, add additional food and liquid to 
maintain the headspace stated in your recipe.
 
5. Wipe the jar rims, add the two-piece caps, and process the filled jars 
in a pressure canner (see Chapter 9).

138
Part III: Pressure Canning 
Processing Tips for Successful Results
Because vegetables are low-acid foods, you must use the pressure-canning 
method outlined in Chapter 9. In addition to the pressure-canner-processing 
steps there, use these tips for producing a product of high quality that’s safe 
for eating.
 
✓ Get your supplies ready ahead of time. About one week before you 
begin pressure canning, assemble and check your equipment (see 
Chapter 9). Locate your recipe and review the ingredients you need to 
have on hand. Stopping at any stage of food preparing or processing 
adversely affects the quality of your final product.
 
 During the canning season (summer), canning supplies may be in short 
supply and challenging to find. Inventorying your products early and 
purchasing missing items keeps you ready to can on a moment’s notice. 
Jars, lids, and screw bands don’t have a shelf life or expiration date.
 
✓ If you add salt, use pickling or canning salt, which doesn’t have 
preservatives, to eliminate cloudiness in the liquid.
 
 Using or not using salt in your vegetables is a personal preference. 
Add 
1⁄2 teaspoon to each pint jar and 1 teaspoon to each quart jar before 
adding the hot liquid.
 
✓ Cover the vegetables with liquid, allowing the proper headspace. 
This prevents discoloration and spoilage. Head to Chapter 3 for detailed 
information on why headspace is important.
 
✓ Release air bubbles. Releasing all trapped air bubbles between the 
food pieces prevents a decrease in the liquid level of your final product, 
keeping the correct air space in the jar. After releasing air bubbles, you 
may need to add additional food or liquid to the jar. Go to Chapter 3 for 
more information how to release air bubbles.
 
✓ Be ready to process your jars immediately after filling them and 
process them exactly as the recipe indicates. This decreases the 
opportunity for microorganisms to reenter the jars.
 
✓ Cool your jars. Let your jars cool naturally. This may take as long 
as 24 hours.

 Chapter 10: Preserving the Harvest: Just Vegetables
Pressure Canning Vegetables
This section offers instructions and guidelines for pressure canning some 
of the more common fresh vegetables. Included are tips for selecting your 
vegetables, determining the approximate amounts of fresh vegetables for 
yielding 1 quart of a finished product, and which method is preferred. 
 
Before you begin, take a few minutes to acquaint yourself with the steps for 
pressure-canner processing in Chapter 9. Always check your recipe to ensure 
you’re processing your food for the correct time, pressure, and jar size. Also 
keep in mind the following:
 
✓ When canning at altitudes over 1,000 feet above sea level, refer to the 
altitude chart in Chapter 9 for pressure adjustments.
 
✓ If it’s safe to use either quart jars or pint jars for your vegetables, the 
correct processing time for each size is listed. Quarts typically take 
longer to process than pints because there’s a larger amount of food to 
heat to properly destroy all microorganisms. If only one size jar is listed, 
that food may not be suitable for canning in the alternative-size jar due 
to the thickness of the finished product.
 
✓ Use only one size jar (pints or quarts) for each batch of food. This allows 
you to complete the correct processing time required to evenly heat the 
jars and destroy microorganisms.
 
✓ When using low-acid, pressure-canned vegetables, always boil your food 
for 15 minutes before you taste the food. For altitudes over 1,000 feet 
above sea level, extend the boiling period 1 minute for each increase of 
1,000 feet.
Asparagus
Select firm, bright-green stalks with tightly closed tips. Stalks with small 
diameters indicate a young, tender vegetable. Cut stalks into 1-inch pieces 
or can them whole, placing the tips of the stalks toward the top of the jar (be 
sure to trim them from the bottom to maintain the headspace indicated in 
the recipe).

140
Part III: Pressure Canning 
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on 
preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Wash the asparagus spears. Cut them into 1-inch pieces. In a 12-quart pot, bring water 
to a boil. Heat the asparagus pieces in the boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes, until the 
spears are bright green but still firm inside. Do not drain.
 3 Loosely pack the cut spears into jars (don’t press them down). Pour the boiling cooking 
liquid over the pieces, leaving 1-inch headspace. Add 
1⁄2 teaspoon salt to each pint jar or 
1 teaspoon salt to each quart jar. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil, 
adding more liquid as necessary to maintain the proper headspace (refer to Chapter 3). 
Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 4 Process the filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 30 minutes (pints) 
or 40 minutes (quarts). When the processing time is done, allow the pressure to return 
to 0, wait an additional 10 minutes, and then carefully open the canner lid. (Head to 
Chapter 9 for detailed processing instructions for pressure canning.)
 5 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). If 
you find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks. Prior 
to eating or tasting, boil the food for 15 minutes.

Canned Asparagus
Canning asparagus is a great way to preserve this delicate vegetable. With only one 
short season, it is usually a special treat or pricy delicacy during the rest of the year. 
Keeping plenty on hand will ensure that your family can enjoy this treat any time it 
wants. In Chapter 8, you can find a recipe for Pickled Asparagus.

Beans
You can put up either fresh or dried beans. Regardless which type of beans 
you use, be sure to thoroughly examine them:
 
✓ Fresh beans: Select only those that are free from bruising, rust, or 
mushiness; discard any beans fitting this description. 
 
✓ Dried beans: Examine dried beans for any nonbean material, such as 
stems or stones. 
Green (pole or bush), string, Italian, or wax
When you can green, string, Italian, or wax beans, select ones that are 
tender and small. Remove the ends and strings from the beans, as shown in 
Figure 10-1. Can them whole or cut them into 1- to 2-inch pieces.

Part III: Pressure Canning 
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For information on preparing 
your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 In an 8-quart pot, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. While water is boiling, trim off the 
ends of the beans and cut them into 2-inch pieces.
 3 Tightly pack the cut beans into the prepared jars. Pour the boiling water over the 
beans, leaving 1-inch headspace. Add 
1⁄2 teaspoon salt to each pint jar or 1 teaspoon salt 
to each quart jar. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil, adding more water 
as necessary to maintain the proper headspace (refer to Chapter 3). Wipe the jar rims; 
seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 4 Process the filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 20 minutes (pints) 
or 25 minutes (quarts). Allow the pressure to return to 0, wait an additional 10 minutes, 
and then carefully open the canner lid. (Head to Chapter 9 for detailed processing 
instructions for pressure canning.)
 5 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). If 
you find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks. Prior 
to eating or tasting, boil the food for 15 minutes.

Dried beans (kidney, navy, pinto, split peas, and so on)
Rinse the dried beans before you soak them to remove any dust or dirt 
particles: Do this by placing the beans in a colander and running cold water 
over them while stirring them with your hands or a spoon. 
 
Canned Fresh Green Beans
Garden fresh green beans are a staple for any pantry. This is a great first recipe for the 
beginning pressure canner. Although this recipe specifically uses green beans, all 
colors of beans — green, yellow or purple — work equally well.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Processing time: Pints, 20 minutes; quarts, 25 minutes 
Pressure level: 10 pounds 
Yield: 16 pints or 8 quarts 
4 pounds fresh green beans
Boiling water

143
 Chapter 10: Preserving the Harvest: Just Vegetables
 1 Rinse the beans in a colander and remove any stones or broken bean pieces. Place 
them in a 12-quart pot and cover them with cold water. Let the beans soak at least 12 
hours (set them to soaking overnight). 
 2 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For information on preparing 
your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 3 Pour out the soaking water and add more cold water to cover the beans. Bring the 
covered beans to a boil and allow them to boil for 30 minutes, or until they’re tender. 
Do not drain.
 4 Using a slotted spoon, loosely pack the hot beans into your canning jars, leaving 1-inch 
headspace. Pour the cooking liquid over the beans, maintaining the proper headspace. 
Add 
1⁄2 teaspoon salt to each pint jar or 1 teaspoon salt to each quart jar. Release any air 
bubbles with a nonreactive utensil, adding more liquid as necessary to maintain the 
proper headspace (refer to Chapter 3). Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-
piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 5 Process the filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 40 minutes (pints) 
or 50 minutes (quarts). Allow the pressure to return to 0, wait an additional 10 minutes, 
and then carefully open the canner lid. (Head to Chapter 9 for detailed processing 
instructions for pressure canning.)
 6 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). If 
you find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks. Prior

Canned Dried Beans 
Dried beans are a great way to add protein and richness to many dishes. Beans are 
inexpensive and work well blended as a thickener, a recipe-extender, and a plain stick-
to-your-ribs addition to any meal. Add rice to beans and you have complete protein. 
Delicious! Dried beans suitable for canning include peas, soy, lima, and so on.

Part III: Pressure Canning 
Beets
Select beets with a deep red color. A beet with a diameter of 1 to 2 inches is 
the most desirable size for pressure canning. Larger-size beets are best pickled 
(head to Chapter 8 for information on pickling and a Spiced Pickled Beets 
recipe).
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For information on preparing 
your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Scrub your beets clean of dirt and remove the tap roots (see Figure 10-2). Place the 
cleaned beets in a 12-quart pot and cover them with water. Boil the beets for 15 to 20 
minutes. When beets are cool enough to handle, the skins will peel off easily. Remove 
them from the water and peel. Trim the remaining root and stem. Leave small beets 
whole, and cut larger beets in half for a better fit in the jar. Reserve the cooking liquid.
 3 Pack the beets into your prepared jars. Pour the cooking liquid over the beets, leaving 
1-inch headspace. Add 
1⁄2 teaspoon salt to each pint jar or 1 teaspoon salt to each quart 
jar. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil, adding more liquid as necessary 
to maintain the proper headspace (see Chapter 3). Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with 
the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 4 Process the filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 30 minutes (pints) 
or 35 minutes (quarts). Allow the pressure to return to 0, wait an additional 10 minutes, 
and then carefully open the canner lid. (Head to Chapter 9 for detailed processing 
instructions for pressure canning.)
 5 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). If 
you find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks. Prior 
to eating or tasting, boil the food for 15 minutes.
 
Canned Beets
To preserve the bright, red color of the beet, add 1 tablespoon of vinegar (with an 
acidity of 5 percent) to each quart of liquid before sealing the jars. 
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Processing time: Pints, 30 minutes; quarts, 35 minutes 
Pressure level: 10 pounds 
Yield: 14 pints or 7 quarts

Bell peppers (green, red, orange, yellow)
Sweet, firm bell peppers produce the best results. With so many beautiful 
colored peppers available, a jar of canned bell peppers could turn into a 
lovely gift. 
 
Because of the extremely low acid level in this vegetable, you must adjust the 
acidity level of the bell peppers by adding bottled lemon juice. Use only pint 
or half-pint jars for this extremely low-acid vegetable.
To peel peppers easily, heat them in a 400-degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes, or 
until the skin blisters. Then cover them with a damp cloth and let them cool. 
Voilá! You can now easily remove skins with a knife or simply by rubbing 
them with your hands as you run cool water over the pepper.

146
Part III: Pressure Canning 
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For information on preparing 
your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Wash the peppers and cut them into quarters and remove the stem and seeds. 
Meanwhile bring 2 quarts of water to a boil.
 3 Pack flattened peppers firmly into jars. Pour the boiling water over the peppers, leaving 
1-inch headspace. Add 
1⁄2 tablespoon lemon juice and 
1⁄4 teaspoon salt to each half-pint jar or 
1 tablespoon lemon juice and 
1⁄2 teaspoon salt to each pint jar. Release any air bubbles with a 
nonreactive utensil, adding more water as necessary to maintain the proper headspace (see 
Chapter 3). Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 4 Process the filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 35 minutes (half-pints) 
or 40 minutes (pints). Allow the pressure to return to 0, wait an additional 10 minutes, and 
then carefully open the canner lid. (Head to Chapter 9 for detailed processing instructions 
for pressure canning.)
 5 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). If 
you find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks. Prior 
to eating or tasting, boil the food for 15 minutes.

 2 Rinse and scrub the carrots with a brush to remove any dirt. Alternatively, remove the 
skin with a vegetable peeler. Remove the carrot tops. Cut the carrots into 
1⁄4 -inch slices or 
dice the carrots, being sure that all the diced pieces are approximately the same size.
 3 Place the sliced or diced carrots in a 12-quart pot and cover them with water. Bring 
them to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and allow the carrots to simmer for 5 minutes, 
or until they’re still slightly firm in the center but tender on the outside. Do not drain.
 4 Pack the hot carrots into your prepared jars. Pour the cooking liquid over them, leaving 
1-inch headspace. Add 
1⁄2 teaspoon salt to each pint jar or 1 teaspoon salt to each quart 
jar. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil, adding more liquid as necessary 
to maintain the proper headspace (see Chapter 3). Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with 
the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 5 Process the filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 25 minutes (pints) 
or 35 minutes (quarts). Allow the pressure to return to 0, wait an additional 10 minutes, 
and then carefully open the canner lid. (Head to Chapter 9 for detailed processing 
instructions for pressure canning.)
 6 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). If 
you find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks. Prior 
to eating or tasting, boil the food for 10 minutes.

Corn
Starting with corn that has the husks on and the silk attached allows you to 
assess the freshness of the corn. Choose ears with brightly colored husks 
that are free of spots and moisture; silks should be golden, not matted or 
brown.
 
Here’s a surefire way to select corn that is sure to be juicy and tender (see 
Figure 10-3): Slightly peel back the husk to check for any pests. If all is clear 
(no bugs or mold), use your thumbnail to depress a kernel about an inch 
below the top of the corn. If the ear has adequate moisture, liquid will squirt 
out. Buy this ear! If no spitting occurs, select another ear and repeat the test.

 Chapter 10: Preserving the Harvest: Just Vegetables
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For information on preparing 
your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Remove the husk and silk from the corn. Using a sharp knife, slice the corn from the 
cob, measuring the corn as you go so that you know how many total pints or quarts of 
corn kernels you have. Meanwhile, bring 1 gallon of water to a boil in an 8-quart pot 
(you’ll use this as a reserve).
 3 Place the corn in a 12-quart pot. For each pint of corn, add 1 cup of boiling water; for 
each quart of corn, add 2 cups of boiling water. Place the pot over medium-high heat 
and bring to a simmer. Then reduce heat to medium and allow the corn to simmer for 5 
minutes.
 4 Ladle the corn into your prepared jars and pour additional boiling water over it if neces-
sary, leaving 1-inch headspace. Add 1 teaspoon salt to each quart jar or 
1⁄2 teaspoon salt 
to each pint jar. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil, adding more water 
as necessary to maintainthe proper headspace (see Chapter 3). Wipe the jar rims; seal 
the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 5 Process the filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 55 minutes (pints) 
or 1 hour 25 minutes (quarts). Allow the pressure to return to 0, wait an additional 10 
minutes, and then carefully open the canner lid. (Head to Chapter 9 for detailed pro-
cessing instructions for pressure canning.)
 6 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). If 
you find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks. Prior 
to eating or tasting, boil the food for 15 minutes.

Part III: Pressure Canning 
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For information on preparing 
your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 In a 12-quart pot, bring 2 gallons of water to a boil. Remove the husk and silk from the 
corn. Blanch the corn on the cob for 4 minutes in the boiling water. Allow the corn to 
cool enough to handle. Slice the corn kernels from cob with a sharp knife. Then run the 
knife blade along the ear again to remove the extra juice or milk. Measure the corn as 
you go so that you know how many pints of corn and corn milk you have. 
 3 Place the corn and corn milk in a 12-quart pot. For each pint of corn and corn milk, add 
2 cups of water. Heat the corn to boiling.
 4 Using a canning funnel, pour the corn and corn milk mixture into your prepared jars, leav-
ing 1-inch headspace. Add 
1⁄2 teaspoon salt to each jar. If necessary to attain the required 
headspace, add boiling water to the jars. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive 
utensil, adding more water as necessary to maintain the proper headspace (see Chapter 3). 
Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 5 Process the filled pint jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 1 hour 35 
minutes. Allow the pressure to return to 0, wait an additional 10 minutes, and then 
carefully open the canner lid. (Head to Chapter 9 for detailed processing instructions 
for pressure canning.)
 6 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel or 
paper towels away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to 
Chapter 4). If you find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within 2 
weeks. Prior to eating or tasting, boil the food for 10 minutes.
 
Canned Creamed Corn
Creamed corn doesn’t actually contain cream. Its creaminess comes from the naturally 
sweet juice, or milk, of the kernel. To obtain the creaminess, simply cut off the kernels 
and run your knife against the cob a second time, even closer to release the milk. 
Creamed corn is a great base for soups and makes a classic comfort food. This recipe 
uses pints (quarts aren’t recommended).
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Processing time: Pints, 1 hour 35 minutes 
Pressure level: 10 pounds

Greens
Greens is a catchall term that refers to the green, leafy portions of a variety 
of plants that, when cooked (traditionally simmered in water with some type 
of pork fat), creates a delicious addition to many meals. You can use any 
combination: beets, collard, kale, mustard, spinach, Swiss chard, and turnip. 
Select tender stems and leaves to produce a superior product after cooking and 
pressure canning. Large, older stems and leaves tend to produce a strong-
tasting or stringy product.
Corn, glorious corn!
Corn is a wonderful vegetable to get to know. 
It has a traceable history of nearly 7,000 years! 
From the Aztecs to Native Americans to the 
modern world of today, corn has a multi-faceted 
place in our society.
In addition to eating corn one the cob or off, 
here are a variety of other traditional dishes 
made from corn:
 ✓ Spoon bread: A pudding-like bread made of 
corn mush mixed with eggs, butter, and milk 
that you eat with a spoon or fork. 
 ✓ Hoecakes: Thin cornmeal batter fried in a 
griddle 
 ✓ Corn pone: An eggless corn bread batter 
cooked in a skillet
 ✓ Hushpuppies: Deep-fried cornmeal bread. 
 ✓ Hominy: Corn without the germ that is tra-
ditionally boiled and served with butter or 
syrup
 ✓ Grits: A maize-based porridge
 ✓ Succotash: A dish consisting primarily of 
corn mixed with a variety of other beans
Corn isn’t just for human consumption, however. 
Corn and all its parts are used for everything 
from animal feed to making nylon, plastics, and 
lubricating oils. In fact, about 60 percent of the 
corn grown in the United States is grown for 
animal feed. Although edible, animal feed corn 
is nothing like the super sweet corn we all know 
and love.

 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For information on preparing 
your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Thoroughly wash the greens, changing the water in the sink once or twice to be sure all 
the grit is removed. Place the greens in a 12-quart pot and add enough water to cover. 
Heat the greens on medium-high until they’re wilted, about 5 to 7 minutes. Using a slot-
ted spoon, remove the greens from the water and cut them into small pieces (about 1 
inch). Reserve the cooking liquid.
 3 Loosely pack the greens into jars (don’t press down) and pour the boiling hot cooking liquid 
over them, leaving 1-inch headspace. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil, 
adding more liquid as necessary to maintain the proper headspace (refer to Chapter 3). Wipe 
the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands.

Potatoes
The only potatoes recommended for pressure canning are sweet potatoes, 
yams, and white, or Irish, potatoes. Using any other potatoes yields inferior 
results because of their chemical makeup (texture and composition).
 
✓ White or Irish: These potatoes are round and white with a thin skin. 
Peel the potatoes prior to precooking. Small potatoes (2 to 3 inches in 
diameter) may be left whole; cut larger potatoes into quarters before 
precooking. 
 
✓ Sweet potatoes and yams: Sweet potatoes are roots and yams are 
tubers — so they’re actually from two different plant species. Even 
though sweet potatoes and yams are unrelated, they’re suitable for the 
same uses. Sweet potatoes have skin colors ranging from light yellow to 
dark orange and flesh colors ranging from pale yellow to medium orange 
and are sweeter than yams. Yams contain more natural sugar and have a 
higher moisture content than sweet potatoes; they’re white to deep red 
in flesh color with skin colors ranging from creamy white to deep red. 
Small potatoes may be left whole; cut larger ones into quarters before 
removing the skins.

Sauerkraut
Sauerkraut is a tangy, fermented food that sometimes has to grow on you. 
Once you enjoy the taste, you find different ways to bring this delicious treat 
into your diet. Sauerkraut in fits simplest form is nothing more than cabbage 
and salt. There are many variations, however. Some recipes add dill or cara-
way seed. I (Amy) have had much luck adding onion and garlic to mine. Once 
you have made plain sauerkraut a few times, try adding your own spices and 
create your favorite version.
Here’s an easy sauerkraut you can use in the Canned Sauerkraut recipe:
 
1. Finely shred the cabbage and layer it with salt, in a glass or stoneware 
crock until full. 
 
 Use 1 tablespoon salt for every 5 pounds of cabbage. 
 
2. Make an airtight seal by using a food-safe plastic bag of water to seal 
the top. 
 
 Just fill a plastic bag with water and place it over the top of the container. 
It doesn’t have to overlap; it just sits on top like a plug.
 
3. Allow the cabbage to ferment at room temperature (68 to 72 degrees) 
for five to six weeks.
Cabbage’s health benefits
Cabbage is an ancient vegetable and has had 
a long history in European and Asian diets. 
Even the Greeks and Romans appreciated it for 
what they considered its medicinal qualities. 
But somewhere along the line, cabbage got a 
bad wrap. It became the food that stunk up the 
house when cooked and, let’s be honest, stunk 
up other things after being eaten. 
The reputation of cabbage and the other veg-
etables in the Brassica genus (including bok 
choi, cauliflower, broccoli, turnips, Brussels 
sprouts, and more) has finally been redeemed. 
Among the good things eating these veggies 
can do for you: increase your dietary fiber, pro-
vide you with necessary vitamins and minerals 
(especially Vitamin C), lower your cholesterol, 
and prevent certain types of cancer.

Winter squash and pumpkins
Winter squash is also good for canning. Winter squash varieties include 
banana, butternut, Hubbard, spaghetti, and turban squash. Because pumpkins 
are similar in texture to winter squash, you can use these instructions to can 
pumpkin also. Canning winter squash and pumpkins is a bit labor-intensive — 
some of these winter vegetables can be difficult to peel and clean — but the 
rewards are oh, so good!
Squash blossoms
If you’ve ever seen a field of squash grow, you 
know that the vine produces lovely, orange-to-
yellow trumpet-shaped flowers. These flowers, 
when pollinated, produce the squash you’re so 
fond of eating. What you may not know is that 
the flowers themselves are edible. 
Blossoms from summer and winter varieties 
of squash are considered a delicacy by many. 
Simply pick them when they’re wide open and 
use them within two days—the sooner the 
better. 
You can eat them off the vine, chop them up 
and add them to dishes, or sauté them, but the 
most popular way to serve squash blossoms is 
to deep fry them.
To prepare the blossoms for consumption, 
follow these steps:
 1. Remove the stamen and sepals (the small, 
sharp leaves attached to the buds). 
 2. Fill the blossom with your choice of cheesy 
filling and twist the petal tops to seal.
 
 I (Amy) use my homemade goat cheese.
 3. Coat the filled blossoms with a light 
batter.
 4. Deep fry them until the batter is golden 
brown. 
These treats are truly a fantastic and an utterly 
unique way to add a fresh food to your diet. 
Plus they really impress your guests!

Part III: Pressure Canning 
 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For information on preparing 
your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Cut the winter squash into 3-by-5-inch pieces. Scrape out the fiber and seeds. Place the 
squash in a 12-quart pot and cover it with water. Bring the squash to a simmer on 
medium-high heat, and allow it to simmer until soft, approximately 10 to 30 minutes, 
depending on the variety. 
 3 Carefully remove the squash from the cooking liquid and discard the liquid. Scrape the 
pulp from the softened skin and place it in a sturdy mixing bowl. Using a potato masher, 
mash the pulp until smooth. Return the mashed pulp to the empty pot and bring it to a 
boil over medium-high heat. Boil for 10 minutes, stirring often to prevent sticking. 
 4 Pack the boiling hot pulp into the prepared jars, leaving 1-inch headspace. Add 
1⁄2 tea-
spoon salt to each pint jar or 1 teaspoon salt to each quart jar. Release any air bubbles 
with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3), making sure that no air is trapped inside 
the thick pulp. Add pulp as necessary to maintain the proper headspace.
 5 Process the filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 55 minutes (pints) 
or 1 hour 25 minutes (quarts). Allow the pressure to return to 0, wait an additional 10 
minutes, and then carefully open the canner lid. (Head to Chapter 9 for detailed pro-
cessing instructions for pressure canning.)
 6 Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel 
away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). If 
you find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks. Prior 
to eating or tasting, boil the food for 15 minutes.

Using Canned Vegetables
Seeing a shelf lined with pressure-canned vegetables is quite rewarding, 
knowing all the care and effort applied to the process. Are you wondering, 
though, what you can do with all this nutritious food? Try the following:
 
✓ Serve a canned vegetable as a side dish: Use vegetables that have a 
firm texture such as corn or carrots for a side dish. Softer vegetables 
like squash and onions are better used as a flavor ingredient in a recipe.
 
✓ Combine your canned vegetables with meats and other ingredients to 
create easy, nutritious meals. The following recipes offer a few suggestions.
 
When using low-acid, pressure-canned vegetables, always boil your food for 15 
minutes before you taste the food. For altitudes over 1,000 feet above sea level, 
extend the boiling period 1 minute for each increase of 1,000 feet.
 1 Combine one jar each of corn, carrots, peas, and bell peppers (or your favorite vegetable 
mix) along with their canning liquids into a large soup pot. Add enough additional water 
to cover the ingredients by an inch. Bring the vegetables to a boil over medium-high 
heat and boil for 15 minutes.
 2 Add the dried pasta and Italian seasoning to the boiling vegetables. Continue boiling the 
soup until the pasta is tender, about 15 minutes longer. 
 3 Ladle the soup into four large serving bowls and sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon 
Parmesan cheese.

seafood

meals 
C
anning meats is an often forgotten area of home canning, which is a 
shame. Canning a variety of meats is a great way to add a protein 
component to your pantry and build up a quantity of the most expensive 
part of your grocery bill as you can afford to. In this chapter, you discover 
how to safely can meat, game, poultry, and fish and seafood. These items 
will add variety to your pantry and give you delicious dinner foods that your 
whole family will want to eat. 
The Lowdown on Canning Meats
Canning meat results in a tender product. Since canning meat draws out, but 
keeps, the natural juices, the meat is succulent and delicious naturally. Often, 
no additional seasoning is necessary, meaning you can rest assured that your 
family is eating only healthy food and not flavor-enhancing additives and pre-
servatives. 
 
Without fail, canning meat, as well as poultry and seafood, means using the 
pressure canner. These foods are low-acid foods and are unsafe to can using 
the water-bath canning method. Meats cannot be successfully canned using 
any method other than pressure canning, regardless of stories you may have 
heard to the contrary.

Part III: Pressure Canning 
Canning meat and poultry can be done either hot pack, lightly cooked and 
then put into the jars while still hot, or cold packed, placed into jars raw so 
the canning pressure cooks the meat thoroughly (refer to Chapter 5 for more 
on these techniques) As a rule, cold pack recipes are generally for delicate 
meats and seafood that may fall apart from too much handling. Hot pack is 
usually used for partially cooked meats that are a bit firmer and won’t fall 
apart so readily. You can, however, find both hot and cold pack recipes for 
any type of meat. Each results in a different end product. You may find that 
your family likes the results from one method over another. 
 
Be sure to follow the directions of the recipe carefully. Making changes can 
result in serious illness. 
Tips for safety and efficiency
Meats need to be cut and canned as quickly as possible. Because bacteria 
can grow quickly in meat and poultry, your goal is to can the meat before it 
reaches room temperature, and not to allow your cut-up meat to sit out for 
any length of time between cutting and canning. 
 
If you find that you have more meat cut than you can possibly process in one 
day, keep the extra in a refrigerator at 32 – 38 degrees Fahrenheit, and can that 
meat first the next day, before cutting more. Keep canning all the meat until 
finished, even if it means working for more than one day. (Although you can 
freeze meat as soon as you purchase it for canning later, you risk canning an 
inferior product. Better to buy it the day you plan to can it.)
Usually when canning meats, you will be processing a large portion at a time. 
To can meat in the safest and quickest way possible, follow the advice in the 
next sections.
Practice first
Every time you can — and no matter how many times you’ve canned in the 
past — set up all the necessary equipment and supplies and do a dry run to 
be sure you have everything ready and in the right place. 
Be sure that you know how to close the canner properly and quickly; do it 
a few times if you need to. Once it’s filled with steaming hot water and filled 
jars, closing it is a bit harder. If your canner doesn’t get closed properly, you 
may not know it until after it’s been filled and is coming to a rolling boil, at 
which point the canner may leak steam, hiss, and spit hot water. Then you’ll 
be forced to wait until the canner cools and the pressure gauge returns to 
normal before you can reopen and reclose it. This is wasting valuable time 
that your raw meat is not being processed. 

169
 Chapter 11: Don’t Forget the Meats!
Stick to the plan
Canning meat is not the time to experiment with a recipe. Follow the recipe 
to the letter, making notes on your experience, so you can then see how to 
change your technique, if desired, the next time. 
Check everything twice
Make sure your pressure canner is in excellent condition (refer to Chapter 9 
for what constitutes “excellent condition”). Before using the pressure canner, 
be sure to check its safety valve. You can do this with a string or fine wire. 
A sure way to know that the safety valve is clean is to hold the lid up to the 
light. When clean, you will be able to see light through the hole. Check the 
safety valve every time you can. Check it between loads of jars during a single 
canning session as well. It only takes a couple of seconds and can eliminate 
any major accidents.
Also make sure to check all your jars for nicked rims before and after sanitizing 
(glass jars with lids and bands are recommended). Sometimes a jar will be 
perfect when coming out of storage but will get a small nick or crack in the 
cleaning process. A nicked rim won’t keep a jar sealed. 
Be as clean as a whistle
Wash all your work surfaces with hot soapy water and rinse well. You may 
want to add bleach to the rinse water and let the surfaces dry on their own. 
This ensures you have a sanitary work surface to sit your jars and utensils 
on. Note: You don’t have to sanitize the entire kitchen, just the area that you 
will be working at (doing a trial run lets you know exactly where your work 
surfaces are). You also need to ensure that your jars, rims, and lids are sanitized 
(go to Chapter 4 for details). 
Selecting and preparing the meat
When canning meat, use only the best meat you can buy. This means the 
freshest meat that has been raised and handled properly. Here are some 
ways to ensure that you are starting out with the best meat. 
 
✓ Raise your own food animals
 
✓ Buy from a local small farmer
 
✓ Buy from a local butcher
You can certainly use meat from the local big-chain grocery store, but note 
that they won’t have the freshest meat available, and the meat itself may be 
raised in a way that you may not want to support. 

170
Part III: Pressure Canning 
When preparing meats to can, you remove as much bruising, gristle, and 
fat that you can. You remove the first two because they’re blemishes that 
don’t can well. You remove the fat because fatty meat shouldn’t be canned; 
it increases the chance of spoilage and can lend an off flavor to the finished 
product. You won’t be able to remove every trace of fat, but cut off as much 
as possible during preparation. 
How you cut the meat — into cubes, strips, and so forth — depends on the 
type of meat you’re canning. You can find specific guidance for the various 
types of meats in the upcoming sections. 
 
Only prepare enough meat for one canner full of jars at a time. You do not 
want meat to sit out at room temperature for any longer than necessary. Meat 
is more susceptible to bacterial growth than other foods and must remain as 
cold as possible until used. 
Meat canning, step by step
Your equipment and supplies are checked and assembled, and you’re ready 
to begin. The following steps provide a general overview of the process for 
canning meat; for detailed instructions on canning low-acid foods, refer to 
Chapter 9. 
 
1. Place the wire jar rack into the canner and add the water to the 
canner following your canner’s manufacturer’s instructions. 
 
2. Fill the jars following the recipe’s instructions and close them hand 
tight. 
 
 For info on preparing your meat, refer to the earlier section “Selecting 
and preparing the meat.”
 
 Don’t overtighten the jars. By hand-tightening them, you leave a miniscule 
amount of room between the rim and the lid, enabling the pressure of 
the canner to force air out of each jar as it becomes pressurized during 
the canning process. As the pressurized cans then cool, the lids will be 
sucked tightly onto the jars, providing an airtight seal. 
 
3. Place the hand-tightened jars in the canner and then place the lid 
on the canner and fasten, following the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Begin processing.
 
 When the water comes to a boil, vent the steam for at least 10 minutes 
to ensure that the pressure gauge has an accurate reading. 

171
 Chapter 11: Don’t Forget the Meats!
 
4. After the 10 minutes venting time, close the vent and watch the 
pressure build; then maintain the pressure specified in the recipe for 
the recommended period of time. 
 
 Stay nearby because you need to adjust the heat source so that the 
pressure builds high enough but not too high. Read your particular 
pressure canner’s instructions to be sure of the technique the 
manufacturer recommends for your unit. If at any time your pressure 
falls below the recommended level during the canning process, you 
must bring it back up to the correct pressure and start timing all over 
again. 
 
5. After the specified cooking time has elapsed, allow the pressure to 
return to 0. Then remove the jars from the canner, allow them to cool 
completely, and then store.
 
6. Before tasting or eating, boil the contents of each jar for 15 minutes.
The following sections provide specific instructions for various types of 
meats.
Canning Beef and Pork: Cubed Meat
Cubed meats, such as beef, pork, goat, and sheep, are easy to can and can be 
the main ingredient of many delicious dishes. You can use strips, cubes, and 
ground meats (covered in the next section) in any recipe that calls for that 
type of meat.
 
Canning is an excellent way to use the less expensive cuts of meat and still end 
up with a delicious dish. When you preserve meat this way, your family will 
never know that you started with a tougher cut of meat, and children often 
prefer canned meat to the noncanned version.
Preparing the meat
Before placing the meat into the jars, cut it into bite-sized pieces, about 
1-inch square, and cook it in a frying pan on high heat until it’s about half-
way done and lightly browned on each side. Meats that have a strong flavor 
can be soaked in salted water for an hour before cooking. You can also use 
a tomato-based liquid in these strong-flavored meats (as the Wild Game in 
Gravy recipe does later in this chapter). 

172
Part III: Pressure Canning 
You can also cut strips of your desired meats from roasts and steaks. If you 
do so, make sure you cut with the grain of the meat so that it will fit the 
length of the jar. Cutting in this way results in a more tender and aesthetic-
looking piece of meat. Cutting across the grain can cause the meat to fall 
apart and result in a stringy texture.
Filling the jars
Pack the cubed meat while still hot into hot jars. (When canning chunky 
meats, use wide-mouthed jars; this makes it easier to fill the jars when you’re 
canning and easier to remove the foods later on.) Leave 1-inch headspace. 
 
Fill the jars until they’re full but not overly packed. By leaving a bit of room, 
you allow all the air to be driven out of the meat. If packed too tightly, some 
air may become trapped, and your resulting meat won’t be safe to use.
Pour your hot liquid of choice (tomato juice, boiling water, or stock) over 
the meat. This additional liquid fills in any air spaces that remain. (Don’t use 
thickened gravy because it becomes gooey or too thick during the canning 
process and you’ll end up with an unsatisfactory product.) 
Using a plastic or nonreactive utensil (not metal), release any air bubbles and 
add liquid as necessary to maintain the proper headspace. Then hand-tighten 
lids and process according to the recipe’s instructions. 
 
Chopped or Cubed Meat
Cubed meat is tender and delicious and is guaranteed to be one of the first things you 
reach for when you need a fast meal maker. Whenever a recipe calls for cubed or 
chopped meat, use this and cut out a major portion of the work. Serve this meat over 
biscuits in wintertime for a stick-to-your-ribs meal that really tastes great. 

173
 Chapter 11: Don’t Forget the Meats!
 1 Cut meat into cubes and brown lightly in dry skillet until the meat is about halfway 
done (the canning process finishes the cooking). While the meat is browning, heat up 
your choice of liquid until boiling. 
 2 Prepare the canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on 
preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 3 Ladle the cooked meat and your choice of boiling liquid into hot jars, leaving 1-inch 
headspace. Add a bouillon cube or 
1⁄4 teaspoon salt to each pint jar or 
1⁄2 teaspoon salt to 
each quart jar, if desired. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to 
Chapter 3). Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the 
bands.
  4 Process your filled jars in pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 1 hour 15 minutes 
(pints) or 1 hour 30 minutes (quarts). When the processing time is done, allow the pres-
sure to return to 0, wait an additional 10 minutes, and then carefully open canner lid. 
(Head to Chapter 9 for detailed processing instructions for pressure canning.)
 5 Remove the hot jars with a jar lifter. Place the jars on a clean kitchen towel in a draft-
free area. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). (If you find 
jars that haven’t sealed, immediately refrigerate them and use them within one week.) 
Boil the contents of each jar for 15 minutes before tasting or eating.

 1 Cut your meat into 1-inch chunks. In a large nonreactive bowl, cover the meat with a 
brine solution made up of 1 tablespoon of salt per quart of water. Leave the meat in the 
brine for 1 hour. Then rinse thoroughly. In a 8-quart pot, brown the game over medium 
or medium-high heat until it is about two-thirds done. While meat is browning, bring 
your choice of liquid to a boil. 
 2 Prepare the canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on

Wild game is inexpensive, and the unique taste is often a welcome change. You can use 
this recipe for venison and rabbit, as well as any goat that might have a stronger-than-
normal flavor. Although this recipe works well with strong flavored meats, it is still 
imperative to start with fresh, clean meat.

Canning Ground Meat
Ground meat is a family favorite. Canning it makes this handy staple even 
faster and easier to use. When canning ground meat, use any that your family 
enjoys. From poultry to red meat, all of it tastes wonderful when preserved 
this way. Use canned ground meat in the same way as you normally would — 
in any recipe that calls for already-cooked ground meat. You may find that 
your family prefers ground meat cooked this way, as it is far more flavorful 
than cooking in a frying pan. 
When canning ground meat, keep these points in mind: 
 
✓ Preparing the ground meat: Brown the meat just until it loses its pink 
color. 
 
✓ Filling the jars: Using a wide mouth canning funnel, carefully fill the jars 
with ground meat, leaving 1-inch headspace. It is not necessary to add 
any additional liquid because the canning process forces out the meat’s 
natural juices. This juice is rich in natural meat flavor.

Part III: Pressure Canning 
 1 Lightly brown ground beef in a dry skillet. While the beef is browning, bring your water, 
tomato juice, or beef broth to a boil. 
 2 While the meat is cooking and your liquid is coming to a boil, prepare the canning jars 
and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on preparing your jars, see 
Chapter 4.) 
 3 Ladle the ground beef into each prepared jar and cover with boiling liquid, leaving 
1-inch headspace. Add 
1⁄4 teaspoon salt to each pint jar or 
1⁄2 teaspoon salt to each quart 
jar, if desired. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3). 
Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 4 Process your filled jars in the pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 1 hour 15 
minutes (pints) and 1 hour 30 minutes (quarts). When the processing time is done, 
allow the pressure to return to 0, wait an additional 10 minutes, and then carefully 
open the canner lid. (Head to Chapter 9 for detailed processing instructions for pres-
sure canning.)
 5 Remove the hot jars with a jar lifter. Place the jars on a clean kitchen towel in a draft-
free area. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). (If you find 
jars that haven’t sealed, immediately refrigerate them and use them within one week.) 
Boil the contents of each jar for 15 minutes before tasting or eating.
Vary It!: Add a single bouillon cube per quart in place of the salt for a slightly different 
flavor.

Canned Ground Beef
This basic canning recipe makes the most of a common food: burger! Use this tasty food 
in any recipe that calls for ground beef. You may find the texture to be a little finer, but 
the flavor is outstanding. Remember, you may have to use a spoon to remove the 
ground meat from jars. No worries — once it’s heated, it’ll again be the crumbly texture 
you know.

Poultry 
Poultry is chicken, turkey, and other birds. To can fresh chickens (those that 
haven’t been frozen), you use the cold pack method. To can chickens that 
have been previously frozen, you use the hot pack method. 
 
Canning is the perfect way to use roosters and older hens. (An older hen, 
known as a stewing hen, is one that is older than 1
1⁄2 years.) These traditionally 
tougher birds are made tender and succulent through the canning process. 
The younger chickens tend to become too soft and are better if frozen. 
Canning fresh chicken: Cold packing
Cold packing is recommended for poultry that has never been frozen and 
makes a fast and efficient way to preserve poultry for your pantry.
 
✓ Preparing the chicken: If you have whole chickens, remove the breasts 
to freeze separately and can the remaining parts of the bird. Separate 
the leg pieces at the joint, so you have a thigh and drumstick for each 
leg. Place the pieces of cold chicken in a large bowl, only preparing 
enough chickens for a full canner load. 
 
 Make sure that the drumstick bone is not too tall for a lid to sit flush on 
the rim of the jar. If so, chop off the excess bone with a cleaver, or refit. 
 
✓ Filling the jars: When canning chicken, fit one chicken per quart. Cold-
pack chicken pieces into each quart jar. Place the pieces close together, 
but not jammed in, fitting them like a puzzle, working around the jar 
until no more room is left (see Figure 11-1). Add one bouillon cube into 
each jar before hand-tightening the lid. Don’t add any additional liquid 
to cold pack chicken because the canning process yields a surprising 
amount of liquid. 
The natural gelatin in the chicken bones gives the cooled liquid a jellylike 
consistency. Once heated, this jelly will liquefy and be full of flavor.

Canning prefrozen chicken: Hot packing
You may also can prefrozen chickens. Say you have a freezer full of chicken 
and your freezer suddenly breaks down. Now you need to process a large 
amount of poultry, and fast. You can successfully can prefrozen poultry as 
long as it’s not freezer damaged and you thaw it slowly in a refrigerator. (This 
is not a technique to use on old, forgotten chicken that you suddenly found 
at the bottom of your freezer.) A good rule of thumb: Can chicken that’s been 
frozen for 4 months or less. 
 
✓ Preparing the chicken: To can prefrozen chicken, you use the hot pack 
method: Cut up the chicken and separate the pieces at all the joints so 
that you end up with thighs and drumsticks. Save the more desirable 
breast pieces for a separate meal. Remove the skin if you like (doing so 
reduces the amount of fat in the jar). Then cook the pieces about two-
thirds of the way through. The meat finishes cooking in the canner.
 
✓ Filling the jars: Fill hot jars with hot chicken pieces, fitting them 
together like puzzle pieces, until the jar is full, leaving 1-inch headspace. 

179
 Chapter 11: Don’t Forget the Meats!
 1 Cut each chicken into parts, separating legs into thigh and drumstick pieces. Place the 
pieces in a large bowl, keeping them cold as you continue to cut. Remove the skin, if 
desired. Remove the breasts and use or freeze them separately.
 2 Prepare the canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on 
preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.) 
 3 Fill the prepared jars with the chicken pieces until full, leaving 1-inch headspace. Add 1 
bouillon cube or 
1⁄2 teaspoon canning salt to each quart jar, if desired. Release any air 
bubbles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3). Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars 
with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. (Note: Due to the each chicken 
being a little different, you may find that you fit different numbers of pieces into each jar.)
 4 Process your filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 1 hour 15 min-
utes. When the processing time is done, allow the pressure to return to 0, wait an addi-
tional 10 minutes, and then carefully open the canner lid. (Head to Chapter 9 for 
detailed processing instructions for pressure canning.)
 5 Remove the hot jars with a jar lifter. Place the jars on a clean kitchen towel in a draft-
free area. After the jars cool completely, test the seals. (If you find jars that haven’t 
sealed, immediately refrigerate them and use them within one week.) Boil the contents 
of each jar for 5 minutes before tasting or eating.
Vary It! If you are canning chicken that has been previously frozen and then thawed, cook 
it two-thirds of the way through before filling the canning jars.

Never Fail Canned Chicken
Canned fresh chicken is probably the most superbly flavored way to cook poultry. It’s 
canned in the simplest manner as well: cold packed into hot jars. This chicken is perfect 
for any recipe calling for cooked or shredded chicken. Once canned, the chicken falls 
off the bone, making cleaning it a snap. 
Preparation time: 30 minutes 
Processing time: 1 hour 15 minutes
Pressure level: 10 pounds
Yield: 7 quarts (each containing one 3-pound chicken)

Part III: Pressure Canning 
Fish and Seafood
Many people are surprised to know that both fish and seafood can be canned 
successfully. Doing so is great if you’re a sportsman or sportswoman and 
often end up with bags of frozen fillets you don’t know what to do with. You 
can add seasoned broth or tomato juice to the jars, and the resulting food is 
delicious as well as a unique addition to your pantry. 
 
Both fish and seafood fall into the delicate category. Both should be cold 
packed, and you must follow the recipe closely and handle the food with care 
throughout the process. But because they make wonderful additions to savory 
pies and soups or stews, they’re worth the extra effort and care it takes to 
make a healthy and delicious product.
 
Fish and seafood differ from other meats because they are extremely low in 
acidity, which means that there is an even greater chance of error if you don’t 
follow the recipe carefully. Because of the increased chance of error, canning 
fish is not the best project for a beginner. Try canning some other foods first. 
When you feel proficient with canning easier items (like fruits and vegetables), 
move up to meats, and then to fish and seafood. 
Picking your fish
When canning fish, use a mild-flavored fish from clean waters. With fishing 
being a sport that requires an inexpensive license and a worm on a pole, you 
may find that fishing can fill a pantry for little to no cost. 
 
Check with your local health department for official warnings and recommen-
dations about eating freshly caught fish in your area.
Preparing fish and seafood
To prepare fish, you clean and scale it, but you don’t remove the skin. You 
don’t have to remove the tiny bones, either (they’ll become soft and edible 
when canned). Then you cut it into pieces long enough to fill the jar and 
leave 1-inch headspace. If cutting chunks is desired, simply cut into pieces 
roughly the same size, again leaving 1-inch headspace.

181
 Chapter 11: Don’t Forget the Meats!
 
To measure how long to cut your fish pieces, place the size jar you are using 
alongside a fillet of fish. 
Filling the jar
Place the fish pieces into pint jars, skin side facing out (for a prettier finished 
jar), and leave 1-inch headspace, as shown in Figure 11-2. (Fish is not suitable 
for quart canning.) 
 
Figure 11-2: 
Place fish 
skin side 
out in jar.
 
 
Fish and seafood need to be canned as quickly as possible — preferably 
the day it’s caught. If you want to can either of these foods, make a plan 
that includes the actual trip out to catch them. That way, your supplies are 
organized and ready to use when you return to the kitchen. When you have 
a basket of fish waiting to be canned, that is no time to be looking for your 
canning tongs. 

182
Part III: Pressure Canning 
 1 Prepare the canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For detailed instructions on 
preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.) 
 2 Clean the fish, removing the entrails, scales, head, tail, and fins. Leave the skin intact. 
Cut the pieces of cleaned fish to fit the jars minus 1 inch for the required headspace; 
see Figure 11-2. 
 3 Fill the hot jars with fish, skin side out (refer to Figure 11-2) and add 1 teaspoon salt to 
each jar. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the 
bands.
 4 Process the filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 1 hour 40 minutes. 
When the processing time is done, allow the pressure to return to 0, wait an additional 
10 minutes, and then carefully open the canner lid. (Head to Chapter 9 for detailed pro-
cessing instructions for pressure canning.)
 5 Remove the hot jars with a jar lifter. Place the jars on a clean kitchen towel in a draft-
free area. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). (If you find 
jars that haven’t sealed, immediately refrigerate them and use them within one week.)

 Chapter 11: Don’t Forget the Meats!
Including Meats in Other Canned Mixes
When thinking about your pantry contents, don’t forget to add a few canned 
dishes that contain both vegetables and meats. These complete meals in a 
jar not only taste better than convenience food you can buy in a store, but 
they’re also fresher and definitely more healthy. 
Canning a soup or stew gives you a little more breathing room for 
experimentation. Because you are canning based on the meat — the item 
that needs to be pressurized the longest — any other vegetable will be safely 
canned right along with it. When you are designing these soups and stews 
for your family, you can easily substitute vegetables or add more of another 
veggie that your family especially enjoys. 
Following are some pointers:
 
✓ When using strongly flavored vegetables, remember a little goes a 
long way. Strongly flavored veggies, like those in the Brassica family 
(cabbage, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cauliflower, for example) tend 
to have an even more pronounced flavor after canning. If you are adding 
any of these vegetables, use a light touch. You can add cabbage to any 
soup you make, for example, but add only about half the amount you 
add of the other vegetables. 
 
✓ Leave out the noodles or rice when canning. Otherwise, your noodles 
end up overcooked and too soft. Rice seems to do fairly well; brown 
holds up better than white rice, but again it may become too soft for 
your family to enjoy. 
 
 Since you are going to bring the canned product to a boil for at least 15 
minutes before eating, that’s the perfect time to add your noodles or 
rice. The noodles can cook as the canned ingredients heat. 
When you open a can of homemade soup or stew, you may find that it’s 
thicker (in the case of the stew) or that the vegetables have gathered 
together at the bottom of the jar. This is harmless. After warming, it will thin 
and combine into the soup or stew you started out with. For recipes that 
combine meats and other ingredients, go to Chapter 12.

N
ot all canned foods are simply one ingredient. 
Canning combinations of foods gives you 
meals that are as fast and easy as store-bought 
heat-and-eat varieties. With a little bit of advanced planning during the 
growing season, you’ll keep your shelves stocked with a variety of meals for 
people on the go. In this chapter, you get tips for combining high- and low-
acid foods into savory soups, delectable sauces, or hearty one-pot meals. 
After your family gets a whiff of the aroma coming out of the kitchen, they’ll 
think you’ve been slaving over the stove all day!
 
Whenever you combine low- and high-acid foods, as the recipes in this 
chapter do, always use pressure canning. For complete details on pressure 
canning, refer to Chapter 9. 
The Lowdown on Canning 
Combined Foods
Pressure canning soups, sauces, and one-pot meals is the answer for healthy, 
quick meals without filling up your freezer. Pressure canning is a major 
timesaver in the long run: If you spend one day (or even a weekend) preparing 
soups, sauces, and other hearty meals, you can get a hot meal on the table in 
a flash and keep your freezer for ice cream and other treats!

Part III: Pressure Canning 
But you have to think about more than which food combos go well together: 
You also have to know which processing method to use to safely preserve 
combined foods, which may contain both high- and low-acid foods. 
Choosing a processing method
As we’ve mentioned elsewhere in this book, the only processing methods 
approved by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for safely 
home-canning food are
 
✓ Water-bath canning: For canning high-acid foods (like fruit and tomatoes)
 
✓ Pressure canning: For canning low-acid foods (including vegetables and 
meat) and for canning high- and low-acid foods combined.
Mixing low-acid foods and high-acid foods
Knowing that a pot of chili or spaghetti sauce contains both high-acid and 
low-acid foods (the chili contains tomatoes and vegetables, and the spaghetti 
sauce contains meat, tomatoes, and vegetables), how do you determine 
which method is right while still ensuring a safe product? Follow this rule: 
 
Whenever you combine low- and high-acid foods, process the food as though 
it were low-acid: Use the pressure-canning method. For the same reason, 
whenever you include meat, fish, poultry, or seafood in your canned product, 
use pressure canning.  Pressure canning, explained in detail in Chapter 9, is 
the only safe processing method to use when combining low-acid and high-
acid foods. (For detailed instructions for pressure canning meat, fish, poultry, 
or seafood, refer to Chapter 11.)
 
Quite simply, adding low-acid foods to high-acids foods raises the acidity level 
of the food being processed above 4.6 pH (see Chapter 3), and the  higher the 
acidity number, the less acidic a food is. 
Mixing like foods with like
When you mix like foods with like (high-acid foods with other high-acid 
foods, for example, or low-acid foods with other low-acid foods), you process 
them in the manner suggested for their acidity level. Two high-acid fruits can 
be processed in a water-bath canner, and two low-acid foods can be pressure 
canned together. Always follow a recipe and make no changes.

187
 Chapter 12: Combining the Harvest: Soups, Sauces, and Beans
Tips for a successful meal
Obviously, the most important thing to know about processing combined 
products is to use the right processing method (as explained in the preceding 
section). Beyond that, there are other things you can do to ensure a successful 
product and a delicious (and easy) meal, explained in the following sections. 
Cut all ingredients uniformly to ensure even heating 
Make sure all your fruits, vegetables, and meat pieces are as even as possible, 
the same as you would for regular stove cooking. 
Use the longest processing time given when combining foods 
For example, the processing time for corn alone in a 1-quart jar is 1 hour 25 
minutes. The processing time for lima beans alone in a 1-quart jar is 50 min-
utes. Therefore, the correct processing time for combining corn and lima 
beans in a 1-quart jar is 1 hour 25 minutes.
Follow the recipe exactly
 
Don’t be tempted to add or adjust the ingredients in your recipe. Any variation 
changes the acidity level as well as the processing time (and sometimes the 
processing method) needed to destroy the microorganisms that cause botu-
lism, the most serious form of food poisoning (refer to Chapter 3).
And always use the jar size recommended in your recipe. Some combination 
foods may be canned in either pints or quarts; other foods may be suited 
only for pints. 
Don’t add uncooked pasta or rice to your food before canning your jars 
While these are wonderful additions to soups, the intense heat of pressure 
canning disintegrates your pasta or rice. For example, if your pasta cook-
ing time in boiling water is 8 to 10 minutes and you extended the period to 
30 minutes or longer at a temperature higher than boiling water (as occurs 
in the pressure canner), you end up with something that doesn’t resemble 
pasta or rice. For best results when adding uncooked pasta or rice to your 
soup, do the following:
 
1. Complete the 15-minute boiling period for your canned food.

188
Part III: Pressure Canning 
 
2. Add the pasta (or rice) to the boiling soup, cooking it for the time rec-
ommended on the package.
 
3. Test the pasta (or rice) for doneness.
Getting your meal on the table
After selecting a jar from your pantry, follow these simple steps for quick, 
timesaving meals:
 
1. Bring your canned food to a boil in a large pot, boiling the food for 15 
minutes.
 
 Don’t be tempted to taste your food until after the boiling period has 
elapsed.
 
2. Add your seasonings, such as salt, pepper, and fresh herbs.
 
3. Serve and enjoy!
 
Whenever you pressure-can, you must boil the contents of the jar for 
15 minutes before tasting or eating. Refer to Chapter 3 for safety information.
Stocking Up on Soup
Soup is the ultimate comfort food. The road to great soup starts with a 
flavorful stock, which is water infused with the flavors of vegetables and/
or the bones from beef, poultry, or fish. A reduced stock is boiled rapidly, 
thus reducing the amount of liquid by evaporation and producing an intense 
flavor.
 
Chicken Stock
You can either purchase chicken and reserve the meat for another use or use the parts 
you may not normally eat, such as the neck, the back, the wings, or the less-often used 
heart, liver, and gizzards. These pieces are packed with flavor, but using or not using 
them is up to you.
Preparation time: 2 hours
Processing time: Pints, 20 minutes; quarts, 25 minutes

189
 Chapter 12: Combining the Harvest: Soups, Sauces, and Beans
 1 Combine the chicken and water in a 6- to 8-quart pot; bring the mixture to a boil over 
high heat. Add the celery, onions, peppercorns, bay leaves, and salt. Reduce the heat; 
simmer, covered, about 2 hours or until the chicken is tender. Remove from the heat; 
skim off any foam. Remove the chicken pieces, reserving the chicken for another use.
 2 While the stock is simmering, prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and 
screw bands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. 
(For information on preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 3 Strain the stock through a mesh strainer or several layers of cheesecloth into a large 
bowl. Once the stock has cooled enough to place it in the refrigerator, chill the stock 
until you can easily remove the fat. 
 4 Once the fat is removed, return the stock to the pot and bring it to a boil.
 5 Ladle the boiling hot stock into your prepared jars, leaving 1-inch headspace. Wipe the 
jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 6 Process your filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 20 minutes 
(pints) or 25 minutes (quarts). After the pressure in the canner has returned to 0, wait 
an additional 10 minutes, and then carefully open the canner lid. (Head to Chapter 9 for 
detailed processing instructions for pressure canning.)
 7 Remove the hot jars with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel away from 
drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). (If you find jars 
that haven’t sealed, immediately refrigerate them and use them within one week.) Boil 
the contents of each jar for 15 minutes before tasting or eating.

 1 Combine the water and turkey carcass in a 10- to 12-quart pot. Bring the mixture to a 
boil over high heat. Reduce the heat; simmer, covered, for 2 hours. Remove the lid and 
continue cooking for 2 hours more.
 2 Strain and remove the bones from the stock. Check the broth for seasoning, taking note 
that there may be salt and seasoning in the broth from the previous roasting of the 
turkey. Add additional seasonings to taste. 
 3 Add the beans, tomatoes, corn, cabbage, onions, carrots, and celery to the strained 
stock and return it to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes. (Your goal is simply to heat the soup to 
a boil so that it’s as hot as possible for canning. Your goal is not to completely cook 
your vegetables.)
 4 While the stock is simmering, prepare the canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and 
screw bands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. 
(For information on preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 5 Ladle the hot soup into your prepared jars, leaving 1-inch headspace. Release any air 
bubbles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3), adding more stock as necessary 
to maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the rims; seal the jars with the two-piece caps, 
hand-tightening the bands.

Teaming Up with Tomatoes
Although tomatoes alone can be water-bath canned (see Chapter 5), if you 
combine them with low-acid vegetables, it changes the pH (acidity level). 
These combined foods must be treated and processed as low-acid foods — 
that means with a pressure canner.
Heirloom tomatoes and a bit of tomato trivia
If you have only ever eaten the round, red vari-
ety of tomato  from the supermarket, you must 
go out and find a local market or roadside stand 
and feast on some heirloom varieties.  
Unlike commercial tomatoes, which have 
been bred to enhance characteristics other 
than taste (like disease resistance or tougher 
skins), heirloom tomatoes haven’t been scien-
tifically engineered in any way. They have the 
same characteristics as their ancestors, whose 
seeds have been passed down from generation 
to generation.  In addition, heirloom tomatoes 
are an “open-pollinated” tomato plant, mean-
ing that they’re pollinated naturally rather than 
artificially. 
Heirloom tomatoes come in a surprising vari-
ety of colors: striped, pink, red, yellow, orange, 
black, and even white. Some heirloom toma-
toes are perfectly ripe and yet remain perfectly 
green!  
Once you bite into the rich, juicy taste of one of 
these homegrown beauties, you’ll scoff at the 
perfectly shaped but tasteless varieties that 
seem to be available all the time in the produce 
aisle of big grocery stores. 
Here’s a bit of trivia: You may have learned in 
elementary school that earlier American set-
tlers avoided tomatoes because they thought 
they were poisonous. Know why? Some people 
speculate their hesitation was the result of 
two things: the tomato plants rank smell and 
the fact that tomatoes are related to “deadly 
nightshade” (also called henbane), a poison-
ous herb.

 1 Prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and screw bands) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. (For instructions on preparing 
your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 2 Combine the tomatoes, celery, onions, bell pepper, sugar, and salt in a 5- to 6-quart pot. 
Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and 
simmer for 10 minutes, stirring to prevent sticking.
 3 Ladle the hot tomatoes into the prepared jars, leaving 1-inch headspace. Release any air 
bubbles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3), adding more tomatoes as neces-
sary to maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-
piece caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 4 Process your filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 15 minutes 
(pints) or 20 minutes (quarts). After the pressure in the canner has returned to 0, wait 
an additional 10 minutes, and then carefully open the canner lid. (Head to Chapter 9 for 
detailed instructions on pressure canning.)
 5 Remove the hot jars with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel away from 
drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). (If you find jars 
that haven’t sealed, immediately refrigerate them and use them within one week.) Boil 
the contents of each jar for 15 minutes before tasting or eating.

away from drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (see Chapter 4). If you 
find jars that haven’t sealed, refrigerate them and use them within two weeks. Boil the 
contents of each jar for 15 minutes before tasting or eating.

 3 While the sauce is simmering, prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and 
screw bands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. 
(For instructions on preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 4 Ladle the hot sauce into the prepared jars, leaving 1-inch headspace. Release any air 
bubbles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3), adding more sauce as necessary 
to maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece 
caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 5 Process your filled pint jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 1 hour 5 
minutes. After the pressure in the canner has returned to 0, wait an additional 10 min-
utes and then carefully open the canner lid. (Head to Chapter 9 for detailed instructions 
on pressure canning.)
 6 Remove the hot jars with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel away from 
drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). (If you find jars 
that haven’t sealed, immediately refrigerate them and use them within one week.) Boil 
the contents of each jar for 15 minutes before tasting or eating.
Vary it! For a meatless sauce, follow all the recipe instructions, omitting the sausage and 
meat. Process your pints for 25 minutes at 10 pounds pressure.

Rounding Out Your Meals with Beans
Beans are high in protein, calcium, phosphorus, and iron, and are a good 
source of fiber. The more your family eats them in their regular diet, the less 
they will suffer from any gassiness. There are very effective over-the-counter 
remedies that can be used in the meantime. 

196
Part III: Pressure Canning 
 1 Place the beans in a 6- to 8-quart pot. Add 3 quarts of water to cover the beans; allow 
them to soak, covered, for 12 to 18 hours. Drain the beans, but don’t rinse.
 2 Return the beans to the pot; cover with the remaining 3 quarts of water; bring the mix-
ture to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat; cover and simmer until the bean skins 
begin to split. Drain the beans, reserving the liquid.
 3 Transfer the beans to a 4-quart or larger covered baking dish. Add the bacon and 
onions. Combine the brown sugar, salt, mustard, and molasses in a large mixing bowl. 
Add 4 cups of the reserved bean liquid (if needed, add water to make 4 cups). Pour the 
sauce mixture over the beans. Don’t stir. Cover the beans and bake them in a preheated 
350-degree oven for 3 to 3
1⁄2 hours. The consistency should be like a thick soup. Add 
more liquid if the beans become too dry.
 4 While the beans are baking, prepare your canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and 
screw bands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. 
(For instructions on preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 5 Ladle the hot beans into your prepared jars, leaving 1-inch headspace. Release any air 
bubbles with a nonreactive tool (refer to Chapter 3), adding more beans as necessary to 
maintain the proper a headspace. Wipe the jar rims; seal the jars with the two-piece 
caps, hand-tightening the bands. 
 6 Process your filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 1 hour 20 min-
utes (pints) or 1 hour 35 minutes (quarts). After the pressure in the canner has 
returned to 0, wait an additional 10 minutes, and then carefully open the canner lid. 
(Head to Chapter 9 for detailed instructions on pressure canning.)
 7 Remove the hot jars with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel away from 
drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). (If you find jars 
that haven’t sealed, immediately refrigerate them and use them within one week.) Boil 
the contents of each jar for 15 minutes before tasting or eating.

Beans with Salt Pork
This basic staple item combines plain beans with the light taste of salt pork. You can 
use these as an add-in for any soups or stews. You’ll find them handy to keep on hand 
year round for those unexpected guests who arrive just at mealtime.
Preparation time: 30 minutes plus 12 hours soaking time
Processing time: Pints, 1 hour 20 minutes; quarts, 1 hour 35 minutes
Pressure level: 10 pounds 
Yield: About 6 pints or 3 quarts 
1 pound dried beans
4 ounces salt pork, cut into the number of jars 
you are using (optional)
Canning salt (optional)
 1 Cover the dried beans with cool water and let them sit for 12 hours. (This is perfect task 
right before bed, letting the beans soak all night.) Drain the beans; then cover them 
with fresh water and bring them to a boil. Allow the beans to boil for 30 minutes. 
 2 While the beans are boiling, prepare the canning jars and two-piece caps (lids and 
screw bands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the jars and lids hot. 
(For instructions on preparing your jars, see Chapter 4.)
 3 Place one piece of salt pork (if desired) into each prepared jar and ladle the hot beans 
and the resulting bean broth into the jars. If you’re not adding salt pork, add 
1⁄2 teaspoon 
canning salt to each pint jar or 1 teaspoon salt to each quart jar, leaving 1-inch head-
space. Release any air bubbles with a nonreactive utensil (refer to Chapter 3), adding 
more beans and broth as necessary to maintain the proper headspace. Wipe the rims 
and adjust the caps.
 4 Process your filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure for 1 hour 20 min-
utes (pints) and 1 hour and 35 minutes (quarts). After the pressure in the canner has 
returned to 0, wait an additional 10 minutes, and then carefully open the canner lid. 
(Head to Chapter 9 for detailed instructions on pressure canning.)
 5 Remove the hot jars with a jar lifter. Place them on a clean kitchen towel away from 
drafts. After the jars cool completely, test the seals (refer to Chapter 4). (If you find jars 
that haven’t sealed, immediately refrigerate them and use them within one week.) Boil

elcome to freezing, the simplest and least time-consuming method 
for preserving food. Freezing works well for almost any food. With 
a minimum of planning and equipment (you may already have most of it), 
proper storage containers, and basic freezing techniques, keeping food from 
spoiling and tasting as if you just took it out of the oven or brought it home 
from the store is a piece of cake. This chapter gives you the basics. The 
remaining chapters in this part give detailed instructions on freezing 
particular foods.
Defining Freezing
Since the advent of home refrigeration, people have discovered the joys of 
prolonging the life of fresh food by freezing. Freezing food is easy, convenient, 
and relatively inexpensive. The results produced from freezing food are 
superior to canning or drying. When food is properly prepared, packaged, 
and quickly frozen, there’s no better method for retaining its natural color, 
flavor, and nutritive value. The process of freezing lowers the temperature of 
the food to 0 degrees or colder. This low temperature halts microorganism 
activity by slowing the growth of enzymes. Freezing doesn’t sterilize food or 
destroy the microorganisms; it only stops the negative changes in the quality 
of your frozen food. The goal with freezing is to preserve the fresh quality of 
your food.

202
Part IV: Freezing 
 
Follow these tips for best freezing results:
 
✓ Prepare your food quickly. This means be ready to freeze your foods 
the same day you pick them or purchase them. Have your supplies 
ready, and the time set aside to freeze at the peak of freshness. 
 
✓ Package your food in moisture- and vapor-proof wrappings. These 
products don’t permit the penetration of air or moisture, two common 
spoilers. (To find out about other spoilers, head to the next section.)
 
✓ Keep your freezer at 0 degrees or colder. Frozen food stored at 15 to 20 
degrees may appear as solid as food stored at 0 degrees or colder, but 
the quality of your thawed food stored at the warmer temperature 
is lower than food stored at 0 degrees or colder.
 
✓ Properly thaw your food to preserve its quality and eliminate bacteria 
growth. For thawing instructions, head to the later section “Thawing 
Out Your Frozen Food.”
Meeting the Spoilers of Frozen Foods
Before getting started, you need to recognize the spoilers of frozen food. 
These spoilers reduce the quality, flavor, and freezer life of frozen foods. 
One or more of these may occur before, during, or after freezing. For detailed 
information on the spoilers, refer to Chapter 3.
Bacteria, molds, and yeast
All fresh food contains microorganisms or bacteria. When active microorganisms 
are present in food, they multiply quickly and destroy the quality of your 
food, sometimes right before your eyes. The best example of this is a loaf of 
bread that becomes covered with green mold.
Prevent the growth of bacteria, mold, or yeast in your food by following these 
guidelines:
 
✓ Select food of the highest quality.
 
✓ Freeze your food at a temperature of 0 degrees or colder.
 
✓ Use sanitary conditions when handling and preparing your food.
 
Bacteria are microorganisms that have no chlorophyll. Some bacteria may 
cause disease; other bacteria are actually good and are required for the fer-
mentation process, such as that used for making beer.

203
 Chapter 13: Baby, It’s Cold Inside! Freezing Food
Enzymes
Enzymes speed up the ripening process and change the color and flavor of 
your food. Use these methods to retain the colors and the flavors in fresh 
fruits and vegetables before the freezing process:
 
✓ Add sugar and antioxidants, a commercial anti-darkening agent (see 
Chapter 5). These keep fruit from darkening in color.
 
✓ Blanch your veggies: Briefly plunge them into boiling water and then 
into cold water to stop the cooking process. 
 
Not all enzyme reactions are bad: When beef is aged, it sits in a chilled room 
for about one week. The enzymes naturally tenderize the meat, making it more 
desirable to consume. Fermenting foods, that is, allowing good enzymes to 
change a food’s basic makeup, creates healthy and delicious new foods. 
Freezer burn and oxidation
Freezer burn and oxidation result from air coming in contact with your frozen 
food. Freezer burn is a change in color, texture, and flavor in the food during 
the freezing period because the air in the freezer removes moisture from the 
food and dries it out.
Oxidation is a chemical change in your frozen food. The technical term is 
lipid oxidation, which occurs on an atomic level and has to do with hydrogen 
atoms and free radicals. What is important to know is that enzymes have a lot 
to do with oxidation. By blanching foods (most commonly vegetables) before 
freezing, you stop or at least slow down the enzymes’ actions and delay 
oxidation. Other steps you take to prevent oxidation are to properly wrap 
foods, use suitable containers, and follow correct storage times. (Check out 
“Packaging Is Everything” later in this chapter.) Oxidized foods have a funny 
or off taste and color. 
Ice crystals
When you think of ice crystals, you probably think of winter and snowflakes. 
But in the world of freezing, ice crystals aren’t charming at all. They cause 
your frozen food to lose liquid and darken. Because the freezing process 
essentially turns the water in food to ice, the way to eliminate destructive ice 
crystals is to keep them as small as possible. This is accomplished by a fast 
freeze and keeping foods as cold as possible at a temperature of 0 degrees or 
lower.

204
Part IV: Freezing 
Gearing Up to Fill Your Freezer
Whether food is fresh from your garden or fresh from a store, the selection 
choices you make have an effect on the quality of your food after it’s thawed. 
Of course, packaging materials, packaging procedures, and thawing methods 
play an important role in your frozen-food quality, as well.
Knowing what should (and 
shouldn’t be) frozen
In practice, any food can be frozen. In reality, not all foods freeze well 
because of their texture or composition. The key to being happy with the 
results of freezing is to make sure you select foods that freeze well. There are 
almost too many categories of good foods for the freezer, but in general, you 
can freeze most fresh vegetables and fruits, meats and fish, breads and cakes, 
and clear soups and casseroles.
Here’s a list of foods that don’t freeze well:
 
✓ Cooked frostings and frostings made with fluffy egg whites and 
whipped cream. These types of frostings become soft and weep (emit a 
thick liquid). Note: Butter-based frostings freeze well.
 
✓ Cooked pasta: Reheated cooked pasta is soft, mushy, and shapeless.
 
✓ Custards and cream-pie fillings: These foods turn watery and lumpy.
 
✓ Egg whites and meringues: These crack, toughen, and turn rubbery.
 
✓ Mayonnaise: This condiment breaks down and separates.
 
✓ Raw fruits or vegetables with a high water content: Foods with a high 
water content break down when frozen and become mushy beyond 
recognition when thawed. Some examples are lettuce, watermelon, 
citrus fruit, and cucumbers. Tomatoes are an exception to this if you’re 
using them in cooked dishes, like stews. Tomatoes also become soft 
and watery, but usually this texture is desired in a soup or other cooked 
dish.
 
 When freezing fresh tomatoes, cut them into quarters. Package them in 
one-cup portions for quick freezing and easy measuring. 
 
✓ Sauces and gravy: Thickened sauces and milk gravies separate when 
they’re frozen. Freeze your pan drippings; the juices produced from 
cooking a roast or turkey freeze without adding a thickener. 
 
✓ Yogurt, cream cheese, and sour cream: These tend to separate.
 
✓ Soft cheeses, ricotta, and cottage cheese: These tend to break down and 
separate when frozen. 

205
 Chapter 13: Baby, It’s Cold Inside! Freezing Food
 
✓ Potatoes: These become watery and grey when thawed. You could use 
them in a cooked dish, but even then the texture is so mealy that they’re 
not recommended in your frozen foods list. 
Evaluating your freezer
Before you embark of a freezing frenzy, you need to make sure your freezer 
is in good working order: that is, frost free and maintains a constant tempera-
ture of 0 degrees or lower. 
 
✓ Getting rid of frost: Today, most freezers are frostfree, automatically 
defrosting any buildup of ice in the freezer. Freezers that don’t automati-
cally defrost require defrosting when the ice buildup is 
3⁄4 inch, or at least 
once a year. You need to empty your freezer before defrosting it. (Refer 
to your owner’s manual for instructions for defrosting your freezer.)
 
 Keep your freezer operating in top-notch condition with proper care and 
maintenance according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (refer 
to your owner’s manual). If you’ve misplaced your manual or have 
questions regarding maintenance or usage, contact your local appliance 
company or search on the Internet for the manufacturer’s Web site.
 
✓ Checking your freezer’s temperature: Adjust your freezer thermostat, 
as needed, to maintain a temperature of 0 degrees or colder. Purchase 
a freezer thermometer to monitor the internal temperature of your 
freezer.
 
 Add no more food to your freezer than can freeze solid in 24 hours, 
about 2 to 3 pounds of food for each cubic foot of freezer space. 
Adding a large quantity of food to your freezer at one time may raise the 
temperature in the freezer above 0 degrees. This stops the quick-freezing 
process and may affect the quality of your frozen food. 
Types of freezers
Select a freezer based on your needs, the size 
of your family, the space available to you, your 
budget, and the cost required for running the 
freezer.
Refrigerators with freezer compartments are 
the most common units in homes today. The 
preferred model has a separate door for the 
refrigerator and the freezer. This allows you to 
regulate the temperature in each compartment 
with individual built-in thermostats.
Upright freezers and chest freezers are made 
for freezing only. Upright freezers have a door 
on the front with shelves inside, while a chest 
freezer opens from the top and you reach into 
it. Sizes vary from 6 cubic feet of storage to 32 
cubic feet of storage.

206
Part IV: Freezing 
Packaging Your Food and 
Filling Your Freezer
Proper packaging is important for preserving the quality of your frozen food 
both during the freezing process and after it’s thawed. Any excess air in your 
container may compromise the quality of your thawed food. Remove as much 
air as possible in bags and wraps, and allow the recommended headspace in 
rigid freezer containers.
Similarly, how you fill your freezer is also important. Put too much unfrozen 
food in at once and the temperature may rise above 0 degrees. Fail to rotate 
your food and you’re more likely to use newer food before older food. The 
following sections explain how to package your food, pack your freezer, and 
keep everything organized.
It’s a wrap! Choosing a container
Protecting foods during the storage period requires containers that are easy 
to seal, suitable for low temperatures, and, most importantly, moisture and 
vapor proof. Three types of packaging materials meet the criteria for properly 
freezing food: rigid containers, freezer bags, and freezer paper and wrap.
Rigid containers
Rigid containers are the perfect solution for freezing any soft or liquid food, 
such as casseroles and soups, and they’re reusable. The most desirable 
material for rigid containers is plastic, although some glass jars are made for 
freezing. Container sizes range from 
1⁄4 of a cup to 1 quart with a variety of 
sizes in between. Purchase container sizes that fit your freezing needs.
 
Choose square- or rectangular-shaped containers. They save space and fit 
better in your freezer than round containers.
 
Rigid containers approved for freezing prevent the spoilers from attacking 
your food as well as stopping moisture and vapors from penetrating your 
food. When you use them, be sure to allow the proper headspace so that your 
food or liquid can expand without forcing the top off (you can find a table 
listing headspace guidelines in Chapter 15). A good rule: Allow 
1⁄2 inch of head-
space for shallow containers and 1 inch for tall  containers. For freezing in 
freezer bags, always press all the air possible out of the bag. 

207
 Chapter 13: Baby, It’s Cold Inside! Freezing Food
Freezer bags
Freezer bags are readily available, reasonably inexpensive, require a mini-
mum amount of storage space, and come in a variety of sizes. When using 
freezer bags (we prefer the locking zipper variety), purchase bags labeled for 
freezing, because the thickness is moisture proof and protects the flavor of 
your food. 
 
After placing your food in the bag, force out as much air as possible by folding 
the filled part of the bag against the nonfilled portion of the bag, pressing the 
air out while sealing the bag.
Freezer paper and wraps
Freezer paper comes coated or laminated and protects your wrapped food 
from air and freezer burn. Other freezer papers include heavy-duty foil, clear 
plastic wrap, waxed paper, and polyethylene (plastic) sheets.
Vacuum sealing machines
A vacuum sealing machine is a handy appliance 
that’s great for packaging foods for the 
freezer. Air is almost completely removed from 
the package through a suction process, the 
trademark of this appliance. Most vacuum 
sealing machines use materials that are freezer
safe or even microwavable and boil-proof. (This 
is handy for single-serving meals for home or 
at work.)
Consider these additional items when you’re 
purchasing a vacuum sealing machine:
 ✓ Cost: Electric plug-in types range from a 
low of $50 to upward of $300. There are 
new battery or hand-powered vacuum 
sealers that are available for as little as $10. 
Although relatively new to the market, the 
reviews look promising. 
 ✓ Replacement bags: Most machines include 
bags to get you started. Consider the cost 
of replacement bags and the reputation of 
the manufacturer. Investing in a vacuum 
sealer that is limited by a certain make of 
bags may limit use of your machine in years 
to come.
 ✓ Storage requirements: Depending on the 
size of your kitchen, storing a vacuum sealing 
machine may or may not be an issue. 
The ideal location for a vacuum sealer is 
usually on a counter, where you can use it 
at a moment’s notice.
To extend the life of your vacuum sealing bags, 
cut them larger than necessary and reseal them 
each time you remove some of the food inside. 
This works well for dry products. You can also 
refill and reseal the bags if the item inside 
was dry and fresh. This technique is not 
recommended for juicy foods or meats. 

208
Part IV: Freezing 
These papers and wraps are especially useful when packaging irregularly 
shaped foods, such as steaks and roasts. Freezer paper is primarily used for 
meat, because tight wrapping forces out excess air. To freezer-wrap something, 
follow these steps (see Figure 13-1):
 
1. Tear off a piece of freezer paper about double the size of your food (to 
ensure there are no exposed areas).
 
2. Place the food on the paper as close to a corner as you can get it 
without overlapping the paper.
 
3. Fold the corner tightly over the meat.
 
4. Fold the sides tightly over the center, one at a time.
 
5. Roll the package over until you reach the end of your freezer paper.
 
6. Securely tape the ends with freezer tape, a tape suited for cold 
temperatures.
Alternatively, you can use drugstore wrap, also shown in Figure 13-1.

Tracking your frozen food trail
How many times have you looked in your freezer in astonishment that it’s 
full and yet you have no idea what’s taking up so much space? Have you ever 
defrosted what you thought was soup, only to discover you’re now having 
stewed tomatoes for dinner? Solve the dilemma of freezer mystery food by 
following these simple tips:
 
✓ Label each package with the item and the date before placing your 
food in the freezer. Also include the weight of a roast, the quantity of 
cut-up tomatoes, your preparation method, or the number of servings. 
Use an indelible marker or a waterproof pen, which won’t rub off.
 
✓ Keep an up-to-date written record of food in your freezer to help with 
your meal planning. Any sheet of paper works well. Make columns with 
the following headings: date, item (roast, spaghetti sauce, and so on), 
quantity or weight (1 cup or 3 pounds, for example), and any recipe or 
preparation ideas. Keep the list on your freezer door, crossing off items 
as you use them.
Packing your freezer
How you pack your freezer has an impact on the quality of your frozen foods. 
Follow these guidelines:
 
✓ Cool your food to room temperature or chill it slightly before putting 
it in the freezer. Doing this speeds up the freezing process (the freezer 
doesn’t have to work so hard to get the prechilled food down to 0 or 
lower) and it uses less energy. 
 
✓ When you first place your foods in the freezer, pack them loosely. 
Once they’re frozen solid, you can pack them tightly. The extra space 
initially lets the cold air circulate and freeze the foods more quickly.
 
✓ Rotate your food. To rotate your food, simply add new frozen foods 
to the back of the freezer and bring the older foods up front. That way 
you can reach for the front of the group and get the oldest frozen food. 
Remember this acronym: FIFO (First In, First Out).
 
✓ Use your frozen food within one year of freezing. Table 13-1 lists 
approximately how long you can keep food in the freezer.

Thawing Out Your Frozen Food
Following the guidelines for freezing won’t guarantee a great product without 
practicing proper thawing methods. So what’s the big deal about thawing? 
Freezing only halts the growth of microorganisms. After thawing, bacteria 
and enzymes in your food are free to multiply as if they hadn’t been frozen. 
Keep this growth at a standstill by thawing your food at a low temperature, 
preferably in a refrigerator, in its freezer container or packaging.
Thaw only what you need, using your food immediately upon thawing. If your 
food tastes funny or smells odd, harmful microorganisms may be present. 
Don’t hesitate to dispose of any questionable food.
 
You don’t need to thaw vegetables before adding them to a dish you’re cooking. 
Instead, you can add them directly to the dish in the last 10 minutes of 
cooking. You can also place frozen unbaked goods directly into the oven to 
bake. Many previously prepared foods can be placed directly into the oven to 
reheat and bake as well. 
Choices for thawing
Heat makes the spoilers grow faster, so the lower the temperature during the 
thawing period, the better for you and the quality of your food. Here are your 
best options for safely thawing and maintaining the quality of your food:
 
✓ Thawing in your refrigerator: This is the best and safest process for 
thawing your food because of the low temperature. Plan your meal the 
night before and place your choice in your refrigerator to thaw.

211
 Chapter 13: Baby, It’s Cold Inside! Freezing Food
 
✓ Thawing at room temperature: Leave your frozen food at room 
temperature for 2 hours; then immediately place it in the refrigerator for 
the remainder of the thawing process. This option is a great alternative 
if you forgot to take your food out of the freezer the night before.
 
✓ Thawing in the microwave: Use this method only if your microwave has 
a defrost cycle. This is important because you want the food to defrost 
evenly, not be cooked in one portion and frozen in another part.
 
✓ Thawing in water: Immerse your packaged food in cold water, never hot 
or warm water. By maintaining the lowest temperature possible when 
thawing your food, you’ll inhibit bacteria and enzyme activity.
Unplanned thawing
No matter how good technology is, everyone experiences a power failure at 
one time or another. This may be for a few minutes, a few hours, or, in the 
worst-case scenario, a few days. Don’t panic, keep the freezer door closed, 
and resist the temptation to open the door to check the temperature.
 
A fully loaded freezer at 0 degrees or colder usually stays cold enough to keep 
your food frozen for up to two days. A freezer that’s half-full may not keep your 
food frozen for more than a day because air space doesn’t maintain a constant 
temperature as efficiently as a piece of solidly frozen food.
If you do have a power outage, follow these tips for saving the contents of 
your freezer:
 
✓ Check with your electric company to estimate the length of your 
power outage.
 
 If you find that your freezer is the only electric appliance that isn’t 
operating, check the electrical cord and plug for a good connection. If 
this isn’t the problem, check your electrical panel for a blown fuse.
 
✓ If you receive advance warning that your electricity will be off, set 
your freezer temperature to its coldest setting. The colder temperature 
delays thawing during the time the electricity is off.
 
✓ In the worst-case scenario, your freezer may be out long enough for 
your food to defrost. Locate a supplier of dry ice and pack your food in 
the dry ice before it defrosts completely. (Ask your dry-ice supplier for 
safe packing and handling instructions.)
 
 Dry ice is a refrigerant of solid carbon dioxide. Handle dry ice with care 
and never touch it with your bare hands. Even a short exposure to dry 
ice may cause frostbite.

Part IV: Freezing 
To refreeze or not to refreeze thawed food
From time to time, even the best-laid plans change and your defrosted food 
doesn’t get used when you planned. If your food is only partially defrosted, 
indicated by the presence of ice crystals, it may be refrozen.
We don’t suggest refreezing food as a regular practice, but if you’re 
considering it for any reason, keep these things in mind:
 
✓ Don’t refreeze completely defrosted low-acid foods, such as vegetables 
or meat sauces, after they reach room temperature. These foods may 
not be safe to eat.
 
✓ You may refreeze high-acid foods and most fruits and fruit products if 
they’re still cold.
 
✓ You may safely refreeze partially thawed foods containing ice crystals if 
the food was thawing in your refrigerator.
 
Refrozen foods have a shorter shelf life than when first frozen. They may also 
taste different. If you refreeze an item, make a note on the package including 
the refreezing date. Use refrozen food as soon as possible. Follow this simple 
rule when evaluating refrozen, thawed food: When in doubt, throw it out! 
Eating spoiled food can be quite dangerous.

W
ork, children, school, after-school activities, and more! If you’re like 
most people, you may struggle to get everything done and get a 
nutritious meal on the table. Filling your freezer with already-prepared or 
prepackaged meals and snacks allows you plenty of nutritious choices.
Freezing is a great option for taking advantage of buying food in large 
quantities at bargain prices, making large quantities of food, or saving leftovers. 
Taking a few minutes to package your food in meal-sized portions allows you 
flexibility in the amount of food you thaw. In this chapter, you get great tips 
on freezing food and hints for planning your meals.
The Whys and Wherefores 
of Freezing Food 
There are many benefits of freezing food purchased from your supermarket 
or foods prepared in your home. These include:
 
✓ Time saving: Freezing food saves you time twice: First, when you plan 
to freeze a portion, you make extra. Making a double batch of some-
thing (like soup or spaghetti sauce, for example) takes less time than it 
takes to make the same recipe at two different times. Second, getting an 
already-made and previously frozen food on the table or in the cookie 
jar takes less time (and effort) than making the item from scratch.

214
Part IV: Freezing 
 
 If you make soup or a casserole, double your recipe and put one in the 
freezer. If you’re baking cookies, freeze some for another day or freeze 
some of the raw dough and bake it later.
 
✓ Cost saving: By taking advantage of sale pricing and purchasing 
perishable food in large amounts, you can reduce your food costs.
Watch your weekly food ads for specials, buy those items in bulk, and 
freeze them. This is a great way to keep the foods you enjoy on hand 
and protect your budget at the same time.
 
✓ Convenience: You’ll always have a quick meal or quick dessert at hand 
for reheating, partial cooking, or complete cooking, depending on your 
time allowance.
 
Not enough pans? Here is a frugal tip:  Line your pan with heavy-duty foil, 
prepare the dish and cover tightly with more foil. Freeze and then pop out the 
frozen meal. Label with name, date, and heating instructions. When you’re 
ready to cook the frozen dish, just place it back into the original pan! 
A guide to planning your meals
The best way to budget and be able to serve healthy foods is to plan your 
meals. No more coming home from a busy day to find something to throw 
together. With a meal plan, you’ll never have to wonder what to fix, and 
everyone benefits from a home-cooked meal. Here are some tips for meal 
planning:
 
✓ Review your schedule for the upcoming week to determine your time 
available for preparing meals. Use prepared meals, like soups or stews, 
on busy days. Cook meat or bake casseroles on not-so-busy days.
 
✓ Make a list of your planned meals, including snacks. Keep a second list 
with a complete inventory of food in your freezer. 
 
 Create a basic list of 14 meals that are sure hits for your family. As long 
as you can pull out one of these favorites, you will always have a meal 
on hand.
 
✓ Keep your lists (planned meals and freezer inventory) on the front of 
the refrigerator. Cross off items as you use them and the meals as you 
make them. 
 
✓ Get your family involved in meal planning and meal making. I (Amy) 
like to offer each person two or three choices for their meals. Once 
everyone chooses, I have plenty of ideas to rotate through the week 
and everyone feels like they have something special coming up.

215
 Chapter 14: Meals and Snacks in a Snap: Freezing Prepared Foods
 
 A great way to allow children get involved with mealtime is to include 
reheating directions when you freeze your foods. Then all they have to 
do is follow the directions to be the cook!
The key to delicious frozen 
prepackaged food
Just as with any other food-preservation method (like canning or drying, for 
example), the quality of the food you choose and the care you take when 
storing it have a big effect on the quality of the final product. So keep these 
points in mind:
 
✓ Check your purchased foods for a sell-by or a use-by date. If the food is 
still on the shelf after the date, don’t buy it. Just like fresh foods for 
canning, you want the freshest foods to go into the freezer as well. (Not 
all foods are dated. If you have a product that has no sell-by date, use 
the first in, first out plan and work these foods into your meal plan as 
soon as possible.)
 
✓ As Chapter 13 explains, excess air left in your freezer packaging is the 
number-one enemy causing damage in frozen food. Preserving the qual-
ity of your food during freezing requires quick freezing at a temperature 
of 0 degrees or colder. Unfortunately, packaged food from your store is 
rarely in moisture- and vapor-proof packaging. To preserve the quality 
of store-bought food, repackage your food following the guidelines in 
Chapter 13.
 
How you thaw your food also matters. (Yes, there’s a correct process for 
thawing frozen food.) The preferred method is in the refrigerator, but there 
are exceptions. Some prepared frozen foods may be used in their frozen state; 
other foods may be used partially frozen. Check out Chapter 13 for details. 
(Note: If there are special thawing instructions for the foods listed in this 
chapter, they’re described within the section for that food.)
Freezing Convenience Meals
Meals of convenience include casseroles, soups, and sauces. Freezing them 
in family-sized portions or as single servings provides options for meals later. 
Always use masking tape or freezer tape, label the food, and write reheating 
instructions right on the container. This makes it easy for you or anyone else 
to pull out a meal and know how to prepare it without looking up the basics 
in a cookbook. 

216
Part IV: Freezing 
Main dishes
Prepare your recipe and transfer your food to rigid freezer containers. If 
you’re making a casserole, prepare it in a baking dish (approved for the 
freezer) up to the point of baking. Wrap it in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Thaw 
the unbaked casserole in the refrigerator and bake it according to your 
recipe. These dishes stay fresh one to two months in the freezer. If freez-
ing noodle dishes, undercook the noodles slightly for a better finish to the 
reheated product. 
Soups, stews, and sauces
Ladle hot soup, stew, or sauce into rigid freezer containers, based on the por-
tion you’ll be using. Allow headspace of 
1⁄2 inch for your pints and 1 inch for 
your quarts (head to Chapter 3 for more information on headspace). These 
items freeze well for 3 to 4 months. Here are some freezing tips:
 
✓ Soups: Use freezer containers no larger than 1 quart for quickly freezing 
your soups and preventing loss of flavor in your thawed product. If your 
workplace has a breakroom with a stove or microwave, freeze portions 
in single-serving containers and enjoy a hot lunch. 
 
 Potatoes frozen in soup and stew may darken or become mushy or 
mealy after freezing. You can still use them if you don’t mind this, or 
simply leave them out and add them when you reheat.
 
✓ Stocks: Use rigid freezer containers to store larger portions of stock; use 
ice-cube trays to store smaller portions (each cube is roughly equivalent 
to 1 ounce). Transfer the frozen stock cubes to a freezer bag for storing. 
Add one to a soup or sauce for added flavor. You can find a couple of 
delicious stock recipes in Chapter 12.
 
✓ Sauces: Package your sauces in rigid freezer containers in quantities 
suited to your family’s usage. 
 
 Clear soups and unthickened sauces freeze better than milk-based and 
thickened gravy dishes because the milk or thickener may separate 
during thawing. Make a note to add thickener to gravies when you 
reheat them or any other ingredients (like milk or cream) that you need 
to add before the meal is finished.
 
 Don’t add cooked pasta to your spaghetti sauce before freezing or freeze 
liquids with cooked grains and rice; their flavor and texture will be lost.

 Chapter 14: Meals and Snacks in a Snap: Freezing Prepared Foods
Freezing Bread, Snacks, and Other Treats
Have your ever felt like you had to finish a birthday cake before it went bad 
or had a partial loaf of bread grow fuzzy, green mold? Well, here’s the answer 
to these (and other) challenges: Freeze these foods to save them.
Bread, buns, muffins, and rolls
Bread and bread products freeze well. Repackage them in moisture- and 
vapor-proof paper or freezer bags. Divide your loaves into the number of 
slices that your normally use in a meal to prevent thawing and refreezing of 
the entire loaf. Bread can be frozen for 2 to 3 months and still remain fresh 
tasting when thawed. 
 
When you’re making muffins at home, make two or three varieties at the same 
time, wrapping them individually.
When making bread, prepare your loaves to the point of baking, including all 
of the rising periods. Place your dough into a baking container approved for 
the freezer; wrap it for freezing. To bake your bread, remove the wrapping, 
place the container of frozen dough into a preheated 250-degree oven for 45 
minutes, and then bake your bread as stated in your recipe. 
Cakes
Cakes with or without frosting may be frozen, but fillings can make your cake 
soggy. Butter-based frostings freeze well. Remove other types of frosting, 
including whipped-cream frosting, before freezing your cake. Cakes freeze 
well for two to three months. 
Cheesecakes, whole or leftover, are a favorite for freezing. They keep about 
four months in your freezer. Thaw the wrapped, frozen cheesecake in your 
refrigerator for 4 to 6 hours and serve it chilled. 
 
Freezing leftover cake in single-serving sizes keeps you from thawing more 
cake than you may want available to you at one time.

218
Part IV: Freezing 
Cookies
Who can resist warm cookies fresh from the oven? You can freeze cookies in 
many forms: store purchased or home baked or raw dough to bake later. Use 
all of these within three months.
 
✓ Store- or bakery-bought cookies: Most purchased cookies freeze well, 
except cream- or marshmallow-filled cookies. Laying sheets of wax 
or parchment paper between your cookies keeps them from sticking 
together. Thaw them at room temperature.
 
✓ Homemade cookies, baked: Store cooled cookies in rigid freezer 
containers, placing layers of wax or parchment paper between the 
cookies. Thaw them at room temperature or place them on a baking sheet 
in a preheated 350-degree oven for two to three minutes to warm them.
 
✓ Homemade cookies, raw dough: Freeze raw dough in rigid freezer 
containers, freezer paper, or freezer bags. 
 
• For slice-and-bake cookies: Form your cookie dough into a log, 
wrap the dough in freezer paper, and freeze it. Thaw your dough 
slightly for easy slicing. Bake according to your recipe instructions.
 
• For drop cookies: Drop your cookie dough onto a baking sheet, 
leaving 1 inch between each cookie. Place the baking sheet in your 
freezer and quick-freeze the dough. Place the frozen cookies in 
freezer bags for storage. To bake your cookies, place them (frozen 
is okay) on a baking sheet and bake them as your recipe states.
 
Label bags of frozen cookie dough with the baking temperature and time.
Pies
You may freeze pies at almost any stage in the preparation process. (Check 
out Chapter 6 for pie-filling recipes.)
 
✓ Whole baked pies: Wrap your pie with freezer wrap or place it in a 
freezer bag. Thaw it, wrapped, at room temperature for 2 hours; serve. 
 
✓ Whole unbaked pies: This works best for fruit, mince, and nut pies. 
Prepare your pie in the pie pan you’ll bake it in.
 
 To reduce sogginess in your crust: Brush the inside of the bottom crust 
with shortening, add your filling, and brush the top crust with shortening. 
Cut vents and glaze the top; then wrap it for freezing.

219
 Chapter 14: Meals and Snacks in a Snap: Freezing Prepared Foods
 
 For baking: Remove the freezer wrap and place your frozen pie on 
a baking sheet in a preheated 450-degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes. 
Reduce the temperature to 375 degrees; bake 20 to 30 more minutes or 
until the top is golden brown.
 
✓ Pie fillings: If you love homemade pies, you’ll find having frozen filling 
on hand a real timesaver for assembling pies, especially when you have 
a pie shell in the freezer, too. Simply prepare your favorite pie filling, 
ladle the hot filling into rigid freezer containers, allowing 
1⁄2-inch head-
space. Allow the filled containers to cool on your kitchen counter up to 
2 hours. Then seal and freeze.
 
✓ Pie shells, baked or unbaked: Place your bottom piecrust in a pie pan 
for baking. Wrap the dough-lined pan in freezer wrap or place it in a 
freezer bag, stacking multiple filled pie pans on top of each other.
 
✓ Pie dough, unrolled: Form your pie dough into a flat, round disc. Wrap 
it tightly in a piece of plastic wrap and place it in a freezer bag.
 
 When making dough for a double-crusted pie, separate it into two 
rounds before wrapping and packaging them for freezing.
 
 To use your dough: Thaw it slightly in the refrigerator and roll it out 
while it’s still chilled. This keeps your dough tender after baking.
 
Cream pies and meringue pies aren’t suitable for freezing.
Freezing Dairy Products and Nuts
Buying butter and nuts at special prices can keep your food costs in line. Not 
all dairy products are suitable for freezing. Here are your best choices:
 
✓ Butter: Unsalted and salted butter freeze well. Use salted butter within 
three months because the salt flavor disappears during the freezing process.
 
✓ Hard cheese: Freeze hard cheese as a last resort because it crumbles 
after freezing. Use this cheese within six months. 
 
✓ Soft cheese (like blue cheese): Soft cheese freezes better than hard 
cheese. Use soft cheese within one month.
Freezing is perfect for keeping nuts fresh and ready to use. Freeze any size of 
shelled nut, raw or toasted, in rigid freezer containers or freezer bags. The 
bags that nuts come in are usually not suitable for freezing. If toasted nuts 
are desired, toast them and let cool to room temperature before freezing. 

220
Part IV: Freezing 
Freezing Meat, Poultry, and Fish
Purchase meat, poultry, and fish from stores that practice sanitary handling 
procedures. If you’re buying at a butcher store or fish market, ask them 
to wrap it for the freezer. If your food is prepackaged, repackage it for the 
freezer.
Packing hints
Divide your meat into meal-sized portions, always packaging steaks, chops, 
and chicken parts individually. Even though you may use more than one 
piece at a time, freezing and thawing time is less because you’re working 
with a smaller mass. Freezer bags or freezer wrap are your best packaging 
materials for these foods.
 
Never freeze a whole stuffed bird because freezing time is increased and 
microorganisms may be passed from the poultry to the stuffing. If the stuffing 
doesn’t reach a high enough temperature during cooking to kill the bacteria, it 
may be passed to your consumers, making them ill.
Fish and shellfish must be kept chilled from the time they’re caught. Ideally, 
clean and freeze them immediately if you aren’t using them within 24 hours. 
Prepare your fish for your freezer based on its size:
 
✓ If it’s under 2 pounds, remove the tail, head, fins, and internal organs; 
freeze it whole.
 
✓ If it’s over 2 pounds, clean it as above. Cut it into fillets or steaks and 
wrap each piece separately for freezing.
Thawing tips
Thaw your food in its freezer packaging in the refrigerator. For meat, allow 
5 hours for each pound; for poultry, allow 2 hours for each pound; and for 
fish, allow 8 hours for each pound. If your time is limited, thawing it on the 
kitchen counter at room temperature will take about half the time of thawing 
it in the refrigerator, but this isn’t the preferred method because bacteria 
may start to multiply at room temperature.

Preparing and processing fresh fruits and 
vegetables for the freezer takes about one-third 
of the time of water-bath or pressure canning. 
You can also preserve fresh herbs in your freezer.
The equipment required for freezing food is more 
than likely already in your kitchen: a freezer, 
packaging materials (check out Chapter 13), pots, 
a colander, measuring cups, measuring spoons, 
and a food scale. After your equipment and food is 
in order, start freezing!

2. Work with small, manageable quantities, about 8 to 12 cups of fruit, 
which yields about 2 to 3 quarts frozen. 
 
 Note: Most of the recipes in this chapter use about 2 cups of fruit, which 
yields 1 pint. You can easily do multiple batches at a time to get the 
yield you want.
 
3. Wash your fruit before packing it for freezing.
 
4. Prepare your fruit for freezing based on your final use.
 
5. If called for in your recipe, add an antioxidant (refer to Chapter 5).
 
6. Fill your container, allowing the proper headspace (refer to Table 
15-2).
 
7. Label the package and let your freezer do the rest!
The following sections offer more information on each step in freezing fruit.
Selecting your fruit
The key to a great frozen product starts with perfect, ripe fruit. Choose only 
perfect fruit, free of bruises and not overly ripe. Be prepared to process your 
fruit the day it’s picked or immediately after bringing it home from the store. 
 
Don’t feel like you have to grow your own fruits and vegetables to get the best 
produce. Local farmer’s markets, food producers, and your supermarket can 
assist you with selecting your food, telling you when it was harvested or how 
long it’s been on the shelf.
Preparing your fruit
Fresh fruits require a minimum of preparation before packaging them for the 
freezer. First you need to wash them and then choose a packing method. 
Fruits may be frozen raw, with added sugar, or with added syrup (a mixture 
of sugar and water). Although adding sugar to your fruit isn’t necessary, it’s 
preferred. Occasionally, you’ll add an antioxidant (an anti-darkening agent) to 
the liquid to keep your fruit from discoloring. 

223
 Chapter 15: Freezing Fruits, Vegetables, and Herbs
Following are your packing choices:
 
✓ Dry or unsweetened pack: When you’ll be eating the fruit or using it for 
pies, jams, or jellies, use this method. No sugar or liquid is added. There 
may be minor changes in the color, flavor, or texture of your fruit.
 
✓ Dry sugar pack: This is preferred for most berries unless you’re making 
pies, jams, or jellies (see the preceding bullet). Place your washed fruit 
on a shallow tray or a baking sheet. Evenly sift granulated sugar over the 
fruit (a mesh strainer works well). Then transfer the berries to a bowl or 
a rigid freezer container and allow them to sit. The longer the berries sit, 
the more juice is drawn out. (It’s not necessary for the sugar to dissolve 
as in the wet-pack-with sugar method, below.) When your berries are 
as juicy as you want them, transfer the berries, including the juice, to a 
rigid freezer container, allowing the recommended headspace (refer to 
Table 15-2).
 
✓ Wet pack with sugar: Place your fruit in a bowl and sprinkle it with 
granulated sugar. Allow the fruit to stand until the natural fruit juices 
drain from the fruit and the sugar dissolves. Transfer your fruit and the 
juice to a rigid freezer container, allowing the recommended headspace 
(refer to Table 15-2).
 
✓ Wet pack with syrup: Place your fruit in a rigid freezer container, 
adding syrup (see Table 15-1 for a variety of syrup concentrations) to 
completely cover the fruit and allowing the recommended headspace 
(listed in Table 15-2). Your fruit needs to be fully submerged in the syrup 
before sealing the containers.
 
 To solve the problem of floating fruit, fruit rising to the top of the liquid 
in the jar, wad a piece of moisture-proof paper (foil works well) into a 
ball. Place it on top of the fruit to force the fruit to stay completely 
submerged when the container is sealed. Remove the paper after 
thawing your fruit.
 
Not all packing methods are suitable for all fruits. Only methods recommended 
for each fruit are supplied in the recipes in this chapter.
Selecting a storage container
Select your storage container size and fruit-packing method based on how 
you intend to use your final product. The best choices for fruit packaging 
materials are rigid freezer containers and freezer bags (see Chapter 13). Use 
rigid freezer containers when you add liquid to the fruit. Use freezer bags 
when no liquid is added to your fruit. 

224
Part IV: Freezing 
Syrup concentrations at a glance
As mentioned previously, syrup is a sugar-and-water combination. Table 15-1 
lists the different types of syrups. To make the syrup, you simply dissolve 
the appropriate amount of sugar into water. You can use either cold or hot 
water. If using hot water, let the sugar syrup cool to room temperature before 
adding it to fruit.
 
The concentration of sugar syrup is up to you, but usually, a thin syrup is 
used to prevent a loss of flavor, especially if the fruit is naturally sweet or 
mild flavored. A medium to heavy syrup is used for sour fruits, such as 
sour cherries or grapes. Different recipes may call the syrup concentrations 
different things. Simply follow the concentrations as specified in the recipe 
you are using.

container
 
✓ Halved fruit: 
3⁄4 to 1 cup of syrup for 1
1⁄2 cups of fruit in a 1-pint container
Headspace guidelines
Headspace is very important when freezing foods. Food expands when 
frozen, and you need the extra space to allow for this. In addition, if you’re 
using glass jars and don’t have enough headspace to accommodate the 
expanding food, the jars can break. To avoid this problem, use the headspace 
recommendation for the size containers you have (see Table 15-2).

 1 Peel, core, and slice your apples into 12 or 16 pieces, dropping the slices into 
1
1⁄2 tablespoons of lemon juice to 8 cups of water to keep them from turning brown as 
you finish them all. (If you prefer, you can use an ascorbic or citric acid solution instead 
of the lemon juice and water.)
 2 Remove the apples from the antioxidant solution and place them in a shallow dish or on 
a baking sheet. Sprinkle the apple slices with granulated sugar, one part sugar to four 
parts apples. Let your apples be the guide here: Taste a slice with sugar to see if it is to 
your liking.
 3 Fill your container and allow the proper headspace (refer to Table 15-2) and freeze.
Vary It! You can also pack your apples in syrup. To do so, place your drained apple slices 
in rigid freezer containers, filling them with a cold heavy syrup (refer to Table 15-1), 
adding 
1⁄2 teaspoon of an antioxidant solution to each container and allowing the proper 
headspace (refer to Table 15-2).

Quick-Frozen Blueberries
Jams, jellies, and preserves made with frozen berries produce a product superior in 
color, flavor, and texture to one made with fresh berries. This recipe uses blueberries, 
but you can use any type of berry (except strawberries); they all freeze well with this 
method (the best way to freeze strawberries is to pack them in sugar, as explained in 
the later Frozen Strawberries Packed in Sugar recipe). Whatever berries you choose, 
make sure they’re firm. 
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 1 pint 
1 to 1
1⁄2 pounds blueberries
 1 Gently wash the berries, removing any stems. Spread the washed berries onto a towel-
lined cookie sheet and allow them to air dry (about 15 to 20 minutes) to prevent them 
from sticking together while freezing.

 2 Spread your washed berries on a baking sheet, placing it in your freezer. (This process 
is known as quick-freezing or flash-freezing.) When the berries are frozen, transfer them 
to freezer bags or rigid freezer containers.
Vary It! To pack your berries in syrup, place the berries into rigid freezer containers, 
covering them with cold medium syrup (refer to Table 15-1), allowing the proper head-
space (refer to Table 15-2). If the berries float, add a ball of moisture-proof paper to keep 
the berries submerged.

 1 Wash, hull, and slice the strawberries. Place them in a 2-quart saucepan. Add the water 
to prevent the berries from sticking. Cook the berries on medium heat until soft (about 
20 minutes). Remove the pan from the heat and let the fruit cool.
 2 Process the cooled fruit in a food processor fitted with a metal blade until pureed, or 
run it through a food mill. Add the granulated sugar and lemon juice to taste. 
 3 Return the mixture to the saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat, 
stirring constantly. Remove immediately from the heat.
 4 Ladle the puree into 1-cup or smaller rigid freezer containers, allowing the proper 
headspace (refer to Table 15-2). Alternatively, freeze small amounts of fruit purée in 
ice-cube trays. Remove the frozen cubes from the trays and transfer them to a freezer-
storage bag.

Frozen Strawberry Purée
Use frozen fruit purées for making fruit leathers (see Chapter 17), fruit sauces (by adding 
water, fruit juice, or a teaspoon of your favorite liqueur), as a concentrated flavor in fruit 
smoothies, or as a topping for your favorite ice cream. This recipe makes a strawberry 
purée, but you can make any kind of purée. Just use any amount of fruit you have on 
hand; 2 to 4 cups of raw fruit is a good working quantity, and add sugar to taste.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Yield: 1
1⁄2 pints
2 to 4 cups strawberries
1⁄4 cup water
2 tablespoons granulated sugar (or to taste)
1 tablespoon lemon juice (or to taste)

 1 Squeeze the juice from the lemons into a measuring cup.
 2 Pour the juice into 1-ounce freezer containers or ice-cube trays. After the cubes freeze, 
remove them from the ice-cube trays and store them in freezer bags.
Tip: If you prefer juice without pulp in it, place a small mesh strainer over the edge of your 
measuring cup; juice your fruit over the strainer.

Frozen Lemon Juice
Lemons (and limes) produce a superior juice that retains its flavor after juicing. Use 
freshly picked, fully ripe fruit. Because this recipes requires so little (just squeezing), 
you can make as much or as little as you prefer (or have on hand to do). You freeze 
lime juice the same way, so consider this recipe a two-fer.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 cups
8 lemons 
 1 Peel the skin from the fruit, slicing the flesh away from the seed (see Figure 15-1).
 2 Measure 
1⁄2 cup cold light syrup (refer to Table 15-1) into a rigid pint container. Slice the 
fruit directly into the container. Press the slices to the bottom of the container, adding 
additional syrup to achieve the proper headspace (refer to Table 15-2).

Frozen Pineapple Packed in Syrup
Selecting a ripe pineapple can be challenging because of the thick peel. Start by smelling 
the skin. A strong sweet pineapple aroma, with no alcohol undertones, means the fruit 
is ripe. Here’s a little tip: The stem end develops sugar first, so check for yellow eyes 
around the base. Although it might seem tricky, getting the ripest pineapple is essential 
for a sweet juicy flavor.

 Chapter 15: Freezing Fruits, Vegetables, and Herbs
 
✓ Open your container when a few ice crystals remain in your fruit.
 
✓ Use your fruit immediately after thawing.
 
✓ When cooking with sweetened, thawed fruits, you may need to reduce 
the amount of sugar your recipe calls for.
 
✓ Use your frozen fruit within one year.
Freezing Vegetables Like a Pro
Like fresh fruit, fresh vegetables are quick and easy to freeze. The key to 
great frozen vegetables is a process called blanching. Blanching scalds the 
vegetables in boiling water, slows down the enzymes and the spoiling process, 
and preserves the color, flavor, texture, and nutritive value.
 
Blanching isn’t necessary if you’re using your frozen vegetables, like onions, in 
foods when you’re only concerned with flavor and not color.
Blanching perfect vegetables
Blanching requires 100 percent of your attention. Vegetables blanched 
for too short of a time won’t stop the enzymes in the vegetables, and 
microorganisms start where they were stopped after the vegetables thaw. 
Vegetables left in the boiling water too long start cooking and may become limp.
Follow these steps for successful blanching:
 
1. Wash and drain your vegetables; then remove any peel or skin, if 
needed. If you’re not freezing your vegetables whole, cut them now.
 
2. Bring a 5- to 6-quart pot of water to a boil and fill a large mixing bowl 
with ice water.
 
 Add ice cubes to the mixing bowl because the hot vegetables increase 
the temperature of the ice bath. Cold stops the cooking process.
 
3. Add your prepared vegetables to the boiling water for the amount of 
time specified in the recipe.
 
 Begin timing your vegetables as soon as they’re in the boiling water; 
don’t wait for the water to return to a boil.
 
 Blanch your vegetables in batches, no more than 1 pound of vegetables 
in 1 gallon of water.
 
4. Remove your vegetables from the boiling water and plunge them 
into the ice-water bath, stirring the vegetables and circulating the ice 
water to stop the cooking process as quickly as possible.

232
Part IV: Freezing 
 
 Don’t leave your vegetables in the ice-water bath longer than they were 
in the boiling water.
 
5. After the vegetables are chilled all the way through, remove them 
from the ice-water bath and drain them in a colander. If you’re dry- 
packing them, roll them in or lay them on clean, dry kitchen towels to 
remove excess moisture.
Packing your vegetables
Pack your vegetables immediately after preparing them. Moisture-proof, 
vapor-proof freezer bags are the best choice for your vegetables. Don’t 
season them before freezing them.
Removing all excess air is important to avoid the spoilers, such as freezer 
burn (refer to Chapter 13). To remove air from your containers, follow these 
guidelines:
 
✓ Freezer bags: Package your vegetable pieces as close together as 
possible at the bottom of the bag, without bruising or squashing the 
vegetables. Fold the unfilled upper portion of the bag over the vegetables, 
gently pushing any air out of the bag. Seal the bag.
 
✓ Rigid containers: Use reusable containers when you’re adding 
liquid to the vegetables. Allowing the proper headspace exhausts the 
air because the liquid in the container expands when it freezes. For 
headspace allowances, refer to Table 15-2.
After filling your bags, place them in a single layer in your freezer. Quick 
freezing is important to the thawed quality of your vegetables. After the 
packages are frozen solid, you may stack them on top of each other. 
Step-by-step instructions 
for freezing vegetables
Follow these steps for freezing vegetables:

233
 Chapter 15: Freezing Fruits, Vegetables, and Herbs
 
1. Choose only perfect vegetables, free of bruises and imperfections, not 
overly ripe.
 
2. Work with small, manageable quantities, about 2 pounds at a time.
 
3. Wash and drain your vegetables and prepare them according to your 
recipe (which usually specifies blanching the vegetables). 
 
 Be sure to allow the vegetables to dry thoroughly before freezing to 
prevent them from sticking together when frozen. 
 
4. Chill your vegetables before packing them for freezing.
 
5. Fill your container, allowing the proper headspace if you’re using 
rigid containers (refer to Table 15-2), or removing all of the excess air 
from freezer bags.
 
6. Label your package, adding it to your freezer.
 1 Wash and drain the asparagus spears. Leave the spears whole or cut them into 1-inch 
pieces.
 2 Blanch the spears or pieces for 1 to 4 minutes, depending on the size (thinner spears 
take less time). Take the time to test your spears after each minute to check for a 
slightly crisp texture. Cool the asparagus immediately in an ice bath. (See the earlier 
section “Blanching perfect vegetables” for complete blanching instructions.)
 3  Place the cooled asparagus in quart-sized freezer bags — 1 pound of asparagus fits 
nicely into a quart bag — removing all excess air before sealing the bag and placing it in 
the freezer.

Thawing and using your vegetables
Properly thawing your vegetables completes the cycle of preserving your 
fresh vegetables by freezing. Thawed vegetable results are best when 
thawed in your refrigerator rather than on your kitchen counter. A package 
of vegetables containing a single serving size takes less time to thaw than a 
package containing 1 pound of vegetables. 
Of course, you don’t have to thaw your vegetables. You can always add them 
directly to hot water or a recipe and allow them to thaw and cook with the 
rest of the ingredients.
Freezing Fresh Herbs
The flavors fresh herbs impart in just about any dish are truly a gift from 
nature. Frozen herbs are a great compromise when fresh herbs aren’t available.
 
Thawed herbs are great in cooked dishes, but they aren’t suitable as a garnish 
because they’re limp after freezing and thawing. If you grow your own herbs, 
harvest them early in the day before the sun wilts the leaves. Some herbs that 
freeze well include basil, chervil, chives, cilantro, comfrey, dill, lovage, mint, 
parsley, savory, sweet fennel, and thyme.
To prepare fresh herbs for the freezer, follow these steps (see Figure 15-3):
 
1. Clean the herbs. 
 
 Hold the bottom of the stems (don’t remove the leaves from the stems) 
and swish the herbs in a bowl of cool water.
 
2. Drain and dry the herbs, gently shaking off any excess water.
 
3. Lay the herb sprigs flat, not touching each other, on a piece of wax 
paper.

244
Part IV: Freezing 
 
4. Starting at one end, roll the wax paper snuggly over the herbs.
 
 This keeps the herbs separate and easy to use one sprig at a time.
 
5. Place the rolled herbs in a freezer bag, label the package, and freeze.
 
 There’s no need to thaw the herbs before using them.
 
Some herbs, like basil, mint, parsley and cilantro, turn black if you freeze the 
leaves directly. For these herbs, purée them in just enough olive oil to make a 
paste and then freeze them in ice cube trays. They keep their fresh flavor and 
color. 
 
Figure 15-3: 
Wrapping 
herbs for 
freezing.
 
 
If you’re still stumped for more ways you can freeze fresh herbs, try the 
following: 
 
✓ Herb cubes: After washing the herbs, remove the leaves from the stem 
and cut them into pieces. Place 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of herbs 
in each opening of an ice-cube tray. Pour boiling water into the tray 
and freeze the herb cubes. After the cubes are frozen solid (usually 24 
hours) pop them out of the tray and into a plastic freezer bag. When 
your recipe calls for 1 teaspoon or 1 tablespoon of an herb, add the ice 
cube to the dish and continue cooking!

245
 Chapter 15: Freezing Fruits, Vegetables, and Herbs
 
✓ Herbed butter: Add chopped fresh herbs to one cube of softened, 
unsalted butter. For a mild herb flavor, start with 
1⁄4 cup of herbs, 
adjusting the amount to your personal taste. Transfer the flavored 
butter to an ice-cube tray sprayed with no-stick cooking spray and 
freeze the butter. After the butter is frozen (about 24 hours), remove 
the butter cubes, placing them in a labeled freezer bag. Serve the 
flavored butter with bread or add one to a casserole.
 
✓ Herbed butter logs: Flavor the butter as stated in the previous paragraph. 
Form the flavored butter into a log in a sheet of wax or parchment 
paper. Twist the ends, place the log in a freezer bag, and freeze it. Slice 
off what you need and return the log to the freezer.

I
n the world of food preservation, sun-drying is the oldest method known. 
Although canning and freezing require exact applications of processing 
procedures, drying food isn’t exact or precise. Don’t be surprised if you find 
yourself working by trial and error when it comes to knowing how long it 
takes for your food to reach its degree of doneness. Just follow the general 
guidelines provided and make adjustments. Remember, drying isn’t exact.
In this chapter, you can find basic techniques for drying food, the best drying 
methods, and how drying food prevents spoilage. Drying is simple and easy 
to do in your home. Most of the equipment and tools you need, except an 
electric dehydrator, are probably just waiting for you in your kitchen.
Opening the Door to Successful 
Food Drying
Drying food is also referred to as dehydrating. The goal in this technique is 
to remove moisture from your food. Achieving a successfully dried product 
requires removing 80 to 95 percent of the food’s moisture. Removing moisture 
inactivates the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms but doesn’t kill 
them.

250
Part V: Drying and Storing 
Key factors in drying food
The following factors affect your finished product:
 
✓ Heat: The correct temperature is important in drying food. It must be 
high enough to force out moisture but not so high that it cooks the food. 
If your temperature is too high, your food exterior cooks or hardens 
before the interior of the food dries, trapping moisture in your food — 
known as case hardening. If your temperature is too low or the humidity 
too high, your food dries too slowly. Both of these dilemmas may cause 
your food to spoil before you consume it.
 
 The temperature guidelines for drying food are as follows: 125 degrees 
for vegetables, 135 degrees for fruit, and 145 degrees for meat. Always 
follow the instructions for the correct drying temperature for your food 
in your recipe or the owner’s manual for your dehydrator.
 
✓ Dry air: Dry air absorbs moisture leaving the food in the drying process. 
The higher the humidity, the longer foods takes to dry because of the 
additional moisture in the air.
 
✓ Air circulation: Circulating air carries away moisture absorbed by dry 
air. This keeps the humidity level constant in the drying chamber.
 
✓ Uniform size: Pieces of food uniform in size and thickness contain about 
the same amount of moisture and therefore dry in the same general 
time, preventing some pieces from not being completely dried and 
spoiling the entire batch when stored. 
Necessary equipment
After you decide which drying method you want to use, assemble your basic 
tools to aid you in completing the drying process. In addition to the basics 
every kitchen should have (knives, cutting board, vegetable peeler, grater, 
and so on; go to Chapter 2 for a whole list of basic supplies), consider the 
following, which are particularly useful when you’re drying food:
 
✓ Blender: Use this for puréeing fruit. For a great fruit purée recipe, head 
to Chapter 17.
 
✓ Food processor: You’ll make uniform slices in a blink of the eye.
 
✓ Oven thermometer: For safely drying food in your oven, it’s critical to 
know the exact temperature of your oven chamber.

251
 Chapter 16: Dry, Light, and Nutritious: Drying Foods
 
✓ Racks and tray: Your electric dehydrator provides the correct size of 
trays for your unit. For oven- or sun-drying, you can use oven racks, 
net-covered racks, or baking sheets. Racks with mesh bottoms or oven 
racks work well and provide air circulation. To prevent food from falling 
off the racks, tightly stretch and pin layers of cheesecloth or nylon 
netting over the racks. If you use baking sheets, you need to rotate 
the sheets and turn the food over for even drying.
Other tips for successful drying
Drying is one of the easiest ways to preserve food. Still, following a few 
suggestions can ensure your success:
 
✓ Pick quality food: Food of high quality that’s ripe, mature, and in top 
condition is the best for drying. If you dry food during the peak of its 
season, you get high-quality food at a lower price because the food is 
more abundant.
 
✓ Wash and eliminate blemishes. Always wash your food to remove 
dust, dirt, grime, or insects. When you clean your food, start with a 
clean sink and clean utensils. Any residue from previous use may cross-
contaminate your food. (For detailed information on bacteria and safe 
food handling, check out Chapter 3.)
 
✓ Strive for uniform size. It’s important to prepare your food in uniform 
size and thickness for the food to be done about the same time. If you 
have two different-size pieces of the same fruit, spread like sizes on one 
tray. Because one tray of food with smaller or thinner pieces will finish 
drying before the other tray with larger pieces, you won’t spend time 
sorting through the food and disrupting the drying process.
 
✓ Place your food carefully on the drying trays. Whether you’re using 
an electric dehydrator, a conventional oven, or Mother Nature, make 
sure you arrange the food in a single layer and leave spaces between 
the pieces of food so that they’re not touching each other or the edge 
of the tray.
 
✓ Watch for spoilage while the food’s drying. The shorter the drying 
period, the less opportunity there is for mold to develop on your food. 
If mold does develop, remove the moldy pieces and then clean the area 
with a cloth moistened with distilled white vinegar with an acidity level 
of 5 percent to kill mold spores. 

252
Part V: Drying and Storing 
 
✓ Test your food for doneness. The length of time required for drying 
your food varies with the quality of your food, whether you’re using 
a pretreating method, your climate and humidity, the size of the food 
pieces, the moisture content of the food, and the drying temperature. 
This all means you can’t blindly follow the recommended drying time. 
Instead, you have to test your food for doneness. Here’s how: Remove 
a piece from the tray and allow it to cool completely. Then check to see 
whether it matches the recipe’s description of how the food should look 
and feel when what properly dried.
 
 The easiest method for checking your dried food for doneness is touching 
and tasting it. This may sound overly simplified, but there’s nothing like 
using your senses. 
 
✓ Store your cooled food in plastic bags, glass containers, or rigid 
plastic containers with airtight seals. Make sure to label the container 
with contents and date. For more on storage containers and how to 
make your dried food last, head to the later section “Protecting the Life 
of Your Dried Food.”
Choosing a Drying Method 
The three approved methods for drying food are using an electric dehydra-
tor, using a conventional oven, and drying in the sun. All methods work well 
when you follow basic food-drying procedures, use high-quality fresh food, 
and practice good sanitation for food preparation. 
An electric dehydrator
If you dry a lot of food, an electric dehydrator is a great investment (see 
Figure 16-1). It’s the most reliable method for achieving the most consistent 
results each time you dry food. This method dries your food evenly and 
quickly, doesn’t tie up your oven, and produces great results in any weather.
An electric dehydrator dries your food by heating the air inside the chamber 
to a low temperature and circulating the warm air through the chamber with 
a fan, passing the heat evenly over your food for the entire drying process. 
After you place your food in your dehydrator, it needs little or no attention. 
To use an electric dehydrator, follow these steps:

253
 Chapter 16: Dry, Light, and Nutritious: Drying Foods
 
1. Prepare your food according to the recipe and arrange it carefully on 
the drying trays.
 
2. Following the instructions for using your dehydrator, allow the food 
to dry for the specified period of time.
 
 Turn the pieces of food and rotate the trays from bottom to top to 
ensure even drying of all the food in the dehydrator. 
 
3. Test your food for doneness and then label and store it in an airtight 
container.
 
Each time you use your dehydrator, review the operating instructions including 
preheating the unit, filling the trays, setting the temperature, and the time 
recommended for drying your food. If you have any questions regarding the 
use or operation of your unit, contact the manufacturer. You can find this 
information in your owner’s manual or check with the store you purchased it 
from.
 
Figure 16-1: 
Two 
examples 
of electric 
dehydrators.
 
If you’re purchasing a dehydrator, carefully assess your needs. Then 
consider the following factors when making your final decision:

254
Part V: Drying and Storing 
 
✓ Overall construction: Purchase a unit that’s approved for safe home 
use by the Underwriters Laboratory (UL). If the unit isn’t UL approved, 
don’t buy it — it may not be safe for use in your home. Choose one with 
insulated walls that’s easy to clean and drying trays that you can move 
easily in and out of the dehydrator without disturbing the food.
 
✓ Capacity: Purchase a dehydrator big enough to hold the amount of 
food you’ll dry at one time. Typically, the most common-sized food 
dehydrator has four trays. Each tray holds about 
3⁄4 to 1 square foot 
of food. Some dehydrators expand to utilize 30 trays at one time. 
Snack-size dehydrators with two trays are also available.
 
✓ Heat source: Select one with an enclosed heating element. Wattage 
needs to accommodate about 70 watts for each tray the unit holds.
 
✓ Fan: The fan circulates the heated air around your food. Purchase a 
dehydrator with a quiet fan, because it runs for long periods of time. 
If your unit isn’t equipped with a fan, you need to rearrange the trays 
more often during the drying period for an even drying.
 
 When buying a dehydrator secondhand, always plug it in to hear how it 
sounds when running. The level of noise is not an indicator of quality, 
but a loud dehydrator needs an out-of-the-way place to run, or it’ll be 
too inconvenient to use. 
 
✓ Thermostat: Purchase a dehydrator with an adjustable thermostat. Your 
temperature options need to range from 85 to 160 degrees.
 
✓ Drying trays: Check for trays that are sturdy and lightweight; made 
from a food-safe product like stainless steel, nylon, or plastic; and easy 
to clean. Some manufacturers offer dehydrator accessories like extra 
drying trays and trays for drying fruit leather and herbs.
 
✓ Cost: Dehydrator prices may start as low as $65 and go up to $200 or 
more.
 
✓ Warranty: Check out the warranty term (one year is a good average) 
and any restrictions the manufacturer has for your dehydrator.
A conventional oven
If you have an oven — gas or electric — that maintains a temperature 
between 130 and 150 degrees with the door propped open, you can use your 
oven to dry food.

255
 Chapter 16: Dry, Light, and Nutritious: Drying Foods
 
Your oven must maintain a temperature of 130 to 150 degrees for 1 hour to 
safely dry food; maintaining these acceptable temperatures is difficult unless 
your oven can be set at less than the standard 200 degrees as the lowest temp. 
The problem with higher temperatures is that they cook — they don’t dry — 
the food. To test your oven’s temperature, put an oven thermometer in the 
center of your oven with the door propped open. 
Oven-drying takes longer than using a dehydrator and costs more because 
the oven uses a greater amount of electricity than an electric dehydrator 
does. In addition, if you use your oven for drying, it isn’t available for any 
other use during that time. 
To dry food in a conventional oven, follow these steps:
 
1. Preheat your oven to the temperature setting in your recipe. 
 
 Use a separate oven thermometer to check for accuracy. Check the oven 
frequently to be sure food isn’t over- or underdried. 
 
2. Wash and prepare your food as directed in your recipe.
 
3. Place your filled trays in the oven and leave the door propped open to 
allow moisture to escape during the specified drying time.
 
 If you use baking sheets or other trays without holes or openings in the 
bottom, you must turn your fruit to achieve an evenly dried product. 
After the first side of the fruit has absorbed all the liquid on the top of 
the food, turn it over and repeat this for the other side. After this has 
been done on both sides, turn the food occasionally until it’s done.
 
4. Test your food for doneness and then label and store it in an airtight 
container.
The sun
Sun-drying is the oldest and least expensive of the three methods and it lets 
you dry large quantities of food at one time. But — and these are big buts — 
it’s dependent on perfect weather conditions to produce a safely dried 
product and it can take days compared to hours in a dehydrator or a 
conventional oven.

256
Part V: Drying and Storing 
 
Weather conditions must be perfect for sun-drying, making only a few climates 
suitable for this method. The ideal temperature for sun-drying fruit is 85 
degrees or hotter for many consecutive days, with the humidity level low to 
moderate. If your temperature drops more than 20 degrees below your highest 
temperature during the drying period, your conditions are not suitable for this 
method. You also need good air circulation, a minimum of air pollution, and 
insect control around the food. Sun drying is even less attractive for drying 
vegetables because the temperature needs to be at 100 degrees or above for a 
number of days with the lowest evening temperature never dropping below 
80 degrees (even at night) and the humidity level needs to be low.
 
Sun-drying isn’t safe for meats and fish because the low-acidity level of the 
food, the low drying temperature, and the long drying period (taking many 
days) don’t destroy the bacteria that cause your food to spoil.
If you’re willing to deal with the variances in weather conditions and the 
lengthy drying time, follow these step-by-step instructions:
 
1. Wash and prepare your food as specified in your recipe.
 
2. Line your drying trays or racks with a double layer of cheesecloth or 
nylon netting.
 
3. Place your food on the tray and cover your trays with a single layer 
of cheesecloth or nylon netting to protect your food from insects and 
dust.
 
 Stretch the cover tightly over the trays, but don’t let it touch the food.
 
4. Place your filled trays on benches or tables in full sunlight and check 
regularly.
 
 Check your trays at different times of the day, keeping them in full sun 
at all times. If your nighttime temperature varies more than 20 degrees 
from the temperature at the hottest part of the day, move your trays to a 
warmer area (indoors or an enclosed patio area) for the evening, returning 
them outside when they can be in full sunlight. Relocate the trays if it 
rains, regardless of the temperature.
 
 If you use baking sheets or other trays without holes or openings in the 
bottom, you must turn your fruit to achieve an evenly dried product. 
After the first side of the fruit has absorbed all the liquid on the top of 
the food, turn it over and repeat this for the other side. After this has 
been done on both sides, turn the food daily until it’s done.
 
5. Check your fruit daily for evidence of mold (refer to “Other tips for 
successful drying” earlier in this chapter).

257
 Chapter 16: Dry, Light, and Nutritious: Drying Foods
 
6. Test your food for doneness and then label and store it in an airtight 
container.
 
 If one day is hot and sunny, yet the next is cloudy, you have a problem 
because mold can develop on partially dried foods before the weather 
turns back to hot and sunny again. In this situation, you need to use an 
alternative to sun-drying to finish the foods. 
Protecting the Life of Your Dried Food
You’ll receive many months of rewarding flavor from your dried foods when 
they’re protected from air, moisture, light, and insects. Generally speaking, 
food dried and stored properly can be kept from six months to one year.
Cooler air provides a longer shelf life for your food. The best storage 
temperature is 60 degrees or colder. This will hold your food for at least one 
year. Temperatures between 80 and 90 degrees preserve the quality of your 
dried food for only about three to four months.
 
Check your unused dried food from time to time for any visible moisture or 
spoilage. If the food has signs of moisture, such as droplets of liquid in the 
containers, your food isn’t completely dried. Use it immediately or repeat the 
dehydrating process and repackage it.
Suitable storage containers include the following:
 
✓ Glass: Home-canning jars with two-piece caps (see Chapter 2) are a 
perfect choice for storing dried food. Wash them with hot soapy water 
and rinse them well or wash them in a dishwasher. Dry and cool your 
jars completely before filling them and adding the two-piece caps. 
Reusing glass jars with lids also works well. Remove the cardboard liner 
that sometimes lines the underside of the plastic lid before washing and 
filling with herbs. 
 
✓ Plastic: Heavy-duty (freezer) plastic bags with locking zipper-style 
seals work well. After placing your dried food in the bag, roll the bag 
to remove any extra air and press the seal together, making the bag 
airtight.
 
✓ Metal: If you buy coffee in cans, line the inside of a clean can with heavy 
plastic wrap, place your food inside, and add the tight-fitting lid.
 
✓ Vacuum sealers: If you own one of these units, now’s the time to use 
it. Check your owner’s manual for operating instructions and start 
packaging your dried food.

258
Part V: Drying and Storing 
Always label your container with the type of food it contains, the date of 
processing, and, if you measure your food before placing it into the storage 
container or bag, list the amount.
 
Because some pieces of fruit contain more moisture than others, be sure all 
your fruit is dried the same for storage. Try this tip from the Oregon State 
Extension Office: Fill a plastic or glass container with cooled, dried fruit about 
2/3 full. Cover or seal tightly. Shake the container daily for two to four days. 
The excess moisture in some of the fruit will be absorbed by the drier pieces. 
Vegetables dry almost completely, so you don’t have to do this with them.

▶ Returning life to your dried fruit
T
his chapter discusses the rewarding process 
of drying fruit. Dried fruit has many uses — 
from snacks to sauces, dessert toppings to baked-
good fillings. Many of the best fruits for this 
method oxidize and brown easily when their flesh 
is exposed to air. This chapter introduces you to 
the options available to you to prevent any color 
change in your fruit.
The times required for drying fruit may take 
anywhere from a few hours to many days. An elec-
tric dehydrator provides you with the shortest 
drying time and produces the best dried fruit of the three methods discussed 
in Chapter 16. Sun-drying is the lengthiest process and requires a lot of your 
attention as well as perfect weather conditions.
Putting Your Fruit in Order
Using the best, perfectly ripe fruit for drying is important for a dried fruit 
that’s worthy of high marks and rave reviews. Most fruit is suited for this 
process with a few exceptions. Fruits not recommended for drying include 
avocados, citrus fruits (except for the peel), crab apples, guavas, melons, 
olives, pomegranates, and quinces.

Part V: Drying and Storing 
Sizing up your preparation options
Drying time is determined by the moisture in your fruit, the size of your fruit 
pieces, the moisture in the air (even if you’re using a dehydrator or an oven), 
and the pretreating method you choose. Larger pieces of fruit take longer 
to dry than smaller pieces of the same fruit. So the smaller you cut your 
peaches or the thinner you slice your bananas, the less time you need to 
produce a safely preserved dried product.
Pretreating your fruit
Pretreating makes your fruit look good by preventing oxidation and discoloration, 
the darkening of the fruit flesh after it’s exposed to air. This process retards 
the enzyme activity in the fruit that causes it to ripen.
 
Pretreating only slows down the ripening process in fruit; it doesn’t stop it.
Using a pretreating method before drying your fruit isn’t as important as 
when you’re canning fresh fruit. In fact, it’s not necessary at all, but it does 
assist you with the drying process by shortening the drying time. 
The following section explains your pretreating choices.
 
At one time, sulfuring fruit was popular for preserving fruit color and vitamins 
in dried fruit. Sulfur is unsafe for any drying method other than sun-drying 
because the sulfur produces dangerous fumes of sulfur dioxide when it’s 
heated, which occurs when you dry fruit in an oven or a dehydrator. People 
with asthma or other allergies should avoid this product.
Water blanching
Water blanching is the best for maintaining the bright fruit color. Immerse 
the fruit in boiling water for a short period of time and then immediately 
plunge it into ice water to stop the cooking process started from the boiling 
water. Drain the fruit well.
Steam blanching
Steam blanching is the most common method used for fruit. The steam 
quickly heats the fruit, shortens the drying and rehydrating times, sets the 
color and flavor, and slows down the enzyme activity, in some cases killing 
microorganisms (refer to Chapter 3). In fact, fruit retains more of its water-
soluble vitamins and minerals from steam blanching than water blanching.

261
 Chapter 17: Snacking on the Run: Drying Fruit
To steam blanch, hang a colander on the inside edge of a pot of boiling water, 
making sure the colander doesn’t touch the water. Place your fruit in the 
colander and heat it as directed in your recipe. Cool your fruit quickly in a 
bowl of ice water. Drain the fruit well.
Dipping in a solution
With this method, you immerse your fruit into a liquid or a solution to control 
darkening. Dipping the fruit helps it retain vitamins A and C that are lost 
during the oxidation process. You can use any of the following liquids:
 
✓ Lemon or lime juice: Fresh citrus juice is the most natural of the dipping 
solutions. Mix 1 cup of juice with 1 quart of water. Soak the fruit no 
longer than 10 minutes; drain thoroughly before drying.
 
✓ Ascorbic acid: This white, powdery substance is available in drugstores. 
Its common name is vitamin C. Dissolve 1 tablespoon of powder in 1 
quart of water. Don’t soak your fruit longer than 1 hour; drain it well 
before drying.
 
✓ Commercial antioxidants: These products are found in supermarkets or 
where canning supplies are sold. Some common brand names are Fruit-
Fresh and Ever-Fresh. Follow the directions on the product package for 
making your solution and determining the soaking time.
Detailing Your Fruit-Drying Expertise
Properly dried fruit produces a superior product for use at a later time. After 
your fruit is dried, labeled, and stored (check out Chapter 16), you’ll have 
delicious and healthful fruits at your fingertips all year round. 
 
Fruit contains a lot of water, and you may be surprised at just how much 
volume you lose when you dry it. So don’t be put off by the amount of fruit you 
start with, wondering where you’re going to store it all. Four pounds of fresh 
blueberries, for example, makes 1
1⁄4 cup dried blueberries. And the best news? 
All the taste and nutrition is still there. The only thing missing is the water.
Evaluating dryness
Knowing when your fruit is properly dried is important. Normally, touching 
and tasting a cooled piece of fruit gives you the answer, but when you’re in 
doubt and you positively, absolutely need to know the moisture in your fruit 
has reduced enough, follow these basic steps:

262
Part V: Drying and Storing 
 
1. Prepare your fruit and weigh the portion you’ll be drying.
 
2. Look up the amount of moisture (water content) in your fruit.
 
 You can find this information in the recipes list in this chapter.
 
3. Determine the total water weight of your fruit.
 
 Multiply the weight of your prepared fruit before drying by the water 
content percentage. For example, you have 20 pounds of prepared 
peaches with a water content of 89 percent: 
 
 20 pounds of peaches × 0.89 water content = 17.8 pounds of water
 
4. Calculate the amount of water (by weight) that needs to be removed 
from the fruit during the drying process.
 
 Multiply your total water weight (your answer from Step 3) by 0.8 (the 
minimum amount of water you want to remove from your fruit during 
the drying process). Using the peaches example
 
 A total water weight of 17.8 × 0.8 = 14.24 pounds of water to remove
 
5. Determine how much the fruit should way after drying.
 
 Subtract the amount of the water you want removed (your answer from 
Step 4) from the total weight of the fruit you prepared for drying (your 
answer from Step 1). Example
 
 Twenty pounds of prepared fruit – 14.24 pounds of water to remove = 
5.76 pounds of dried fruit as your goal
 
6. Weigh your fruit when you think it’s done.
 
 If your fruit weighs the amount you calculated in Step 5 or less, your 
processing is successful. If your fruit weighs more than this amount, 
return it for more drying.
 
Properly dried fruit has 80 to 95 percent of its moisture removed, which 
means leathery, not crispy, results. 
Drying fruit step by step
This procedure is simple and is detailed in Chapter 16 for the three drying 
methods. Here’s a summary for drying fruit in a dehydrator or an oven:

263
 Chapter 17: Snacking on the Run: Drying Fruit
 
1. Preheat your oven or dehydrator and prepare your trays.
 
2. Prepare your fruit as directed in your recipe.
 
3. Place your fruit on your prepared trays or racks.
 
4. Place the filled trays in your dehydrator or oven and begin the drying 
process.
 
5. Check fruit and rotate the trays periodically to ensure even drying of 
the entire batch.
 
6. At the end of your drying time, check your fruit for the proper degree 
of doneness as stated in your recipe. 
 
7. Package your fruit in temporary containers, like plastic bags, and 
allow them to condition or mellow.
 
 This process distributes any moisture left in the fruit pieces to other, 
drier pieces, reduces the chance of spoiled fruit, and may take up to one 
week.
 
8. Package and label your product for storage.
 
Don’t add fresh fruit to partially dried trays of fruit. The fresh fruit increases 
the humidity in the drying chamber and adds moisture back to your drying 
fruit. This adjustment in the humidity level affects drying and increases the 
drying time for both fruits.
Drying a Variety of Fresh Fruits
Patience is the key to successful drying. Preparation may take you less than 
an hour, but that’s just the beginning of many hours until you have dried 
fruit.
 
If you’re using an electric dehydrator, verify the correct drying temperature 
for your fruit in your owner’s manual. If it differs from the guidelines given in 
your recipe or this section, use the temperature in your manual.

 1 Wash, peel, and core your apples. Slice the apples into 
1⁄4- to 
1⁄2-inch thick rings (see 
Figure 17-1). Dip the apple slices in your choice of dipping solution (refer to 
“Pretreating your fruit” in this chapter for your options and detailed instructions).
 2 Arrange the apple slices on your trays and dry in a conventional oven or dehydrator for 
6 to 8 hours at 130 to 135 degrees, rotating the trays occasionally to facilitate even 
drying. (Sun-dry for 2 to 3 days.)

Dried Grapes
Everyone loves raisins! Making your own is a fun way to get kids involved with healthy, 
delicious eating. Try different varieties to see which ones you like the best. Thompson 
seedless grapes make the best-tasting raisins. Note: If you use seeded grapes, cut them 
in half and remove the seeds before drying. If you’re using seedless grapes, you need to 
split the skins to allow the grapes to dry more quickly (otherwise, the skin holds the 
moisture in).

Enjoying the Labors of Your Drying
Most dried fruit is used just as it’s stored after the drying process. It’s great 
added to hot or cold cereal or baking batters. It’s perfect if you’re always on 
the go: It travels well and can be eaten right out of the container. For a fun 
twist to your teas, add a few dried berries to your teapot before steeping. The 
berries will lightly infuse the pot of tea with sweetness. 
If you prefer your dried fruit a bit chewier, soften or rehydrate it. Rehydrating 
is the process of adding moisture back to the fruit. Use rehydrated fruit right 
away because it’s not dry enough to go back on the shelf without spoiling.
Your rehydrating options are
 
✓ Boiling water: Place the desired amount of fruit in a bowl. Cover the 
fruit with boiling water, allowing it to stand for 5 to 10 minutes to plump, 
or add moisture, to your fruit. Use this method when adding fruit to 
jams, chutney, or baked goods. Substitute fruit juice or wine for water.
 
✓ Steaming: Place your fruit in a steamer or a colander over a pot of boiling 
water (refer to steam blanching earlier in this chapter). Steam your fruit 
for 3 to 5 minutes or until the fruit plumps.
 
✓ Sprinkling: Put your fruit in a shallow bowl. Sprinkle the fruit with water 
or fruit juice. Allow it to soak in the moisture. Repeat the process until 
the fruit reaches the level of moistness you desire.
 
When chopping dried fruit, spraying your knife with no-stick cooking spray 
keeps the fruit from sticking to your knife.

Fruit Leather
Fruit leather is dried puréed fruit rolled up in plastic (see Figure 17-2). The result is a 
chewy, fruity, taffylike treat. Some good choices for fruit leathers are apples, apricots, 
berries, cherries, nectarines, peaches, pears, pineapple, and plums. If you try drying 
nothing else, fruit leather is a must have. It is so delicious, your family will never guess 
how nutritious it actually is. 
Preparation time: 20 minutes or longer, depending on the amount and type of fruit 
Drying time: Depends on the amount of moisture in your fruit; allow 6 to 8 hours in an 
electric dehydrator or up to 18 hours in a conventional oven. Sun-drying isn’t 
recommended.
Yield: 4 cups of fruit purée makes 8 to 12 servings; 2
1⁄2 cups covers an 18-x-14-inch area, 
1⁄4-inch thick 
One of any of the following fresh fruits:
 
2 to 3 pounds apples (about 8 to 12)
 
3 to 4 pound apricots (about 24)
 
3 to 4 pound peaches (about 8 to 12)
 
4 pints strawberries
Water or fruit juice (optional)
Corn syrup or honey (optional)
1⁄8 teaspoon ground spices (optional): choose from 
allspice, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, mace, nutmeg, 
or pumpkin pie spice 
1⁄4 to 
1⁄2 teaspoon pure extract flavors (optional): 
choose from almond, lemon, orange, or vanilla 
 1 Cover your drying trays or baking sheets with a heavy-duty, food-grade plastic wrap. If 
your dehydrator comes with special sheets for your trays, use those.
 2 Wash your fruit and remove any blemishes. Prepare your fruit as directed in the 
guidelines for preparing fruit in this chapter.
 3 Purée the fruit in a blender until smooth. Strain out any small seeds, if desired, with 
a mesh strainer or a food mill. If your purée is too thick, add water or fruit juice, 
1 tablespoon or less at a time. If your purée is too tart, add corn syrup or honey, 
1 teaspoon at a time. If you’re adding spices or other flavorings, add them now.
 4 Spread the purée onto the prepared trays to a thickness of 
1⁄8-inch in the center and 
1⁄4-inch-thick around the edges (you want the edges thicker than the center because the 
edges dry faster). If you use cooked fruit, it must be completely cool before spreading it 
on the trays.
 5 Dry your fruit leather at a temperature of 135 degrees in a dehydrator or 140 degrees in 
a conventional oven. Dry the fruit until it’s pliable and leatherlike with no stickiness in 
the center.
 6 Roll the warm fruit leather, still attached to the plastic, into a roll. Leave the rolls whole, 
or cut them into pieces with scissors. Store the rolls in a plastic bag or an airtight 
container.

D
rying foods is a super way to store a large 
amount of food in a surprisingly small space. 
If you are short on pantry space or lack more than 
a small freezer in the kitchen, drying may be the 
perfect storage solution for you.
In this chapter, you find out how to choose the best
vegetables for drying, what they look like, and how 
they appear when fully dried. You will be able to 
mix and match your family’s favorite vegetables 
and create easy to store and use vegetables for 
your pantry. 
Note: The per serving nutrition analyses in this 
chapter represent the nutrition information 
for the food before it’s been rehydrated. Once 
rehydrated, the vegetables plump up again and the quantity at least doubles.
Your Vegetable-Drying 
At-a-Glance Guide
Traditionally, drying meant using the sun’s warmth and a lot of time. You 
would bring in the screen-covered trays at night, before the cool night air 
could cause condensation. Flies and other wildlife were a cause for concern,

and you had no way to know whether airborne bacteria were present until 
you ate the food and got sick because of it. Of course, you can still dry foods 
that way, but there are easier ways: in an oven or with a dehydrator (refer to 
Chapter 16 for a basic explanation of these drying methods).
For vegetables, a food dehydrator is your best bet because a controlled, 
clean heat combined with constantly moving air results in a completely 
dried vegetable. To use a dehydrator, you simply layer your vegetables onto 
stacked trays and turn on the unit. Some dehydrators have fans that blow the 
warmed air over the drying food. Other units have a heating element at the 
bottom, and as the warm air rises, it filters through all the trays, drying the 
produce in the process. If you’re serious about drying vegetables, look for 
one that has both a fan and heating element, as well as a thermostat that you 
can set at just the right temperature. 
Drying know-how
Although drying seems pretty, well, cut and dried (pick the freshest vegeta-
bles you can find, prepare them as necessary, and put them in a food dehy-
drator for the required time and temperature), you can ensure that you’ll end 
up with a tasty, edible veggie by following some basic rules: 
 
✓ Not all vegetables need to be peeled before drying. Leaving on clean, 
washed skin increases the final nutritional content. Peels often contain 
fiber and other nutrients that only add to the overall benefit of the 
vegetable. You can find the best prep method in the drying instructions.
 
✓ While your vegetables are drying, switch the trays around to ensure 
they all get even heat. For best results, be sure to cut all the food into 
evenly sized pieces and spread the pieces in a thin layer on the drying 
trays. 
 
✓ Some vegetables dry faster than others due to the water content of 
the vegetable while fresh. When setting up your trays, don’t mix juicy 
vegetables with those that are drier. 
 
 Vegetables with different water content can have much different drying 
times. If you dry them all together, you can end up with mildew because 
some may not get completely dehydrated. 
 
✓ Make sure the vegetables are completely dried before sealing. To know 
that, you need to know what a properly dried vegetable looks and feels 
like. Not all are crispy when dried. Often, a vegetable is dried properly 
and yet remains pliable. (You can find out how to tell whether a vegetable 
is properly dried in the vegetable-specific sections that appear later in 
the chapter.)

 Chapter 18: Drying Vegetables for Snacks and Storage
 
The drying process involves many factors: moisture in the food that is being 
dried, the accuracy of the thermostat in the dehydrator, how full the trays are, 
and the humidity on the day you are drying. You may have to experiment a bit 
to figure out what works best. The drying process is not as accurate as other 
methods in this book, like canning and freezing. The final goal is to remove 
enough moisture so that organisms that spoil food cannot grow. 
Storing and using your dried produce
When you take the vegetables from the dehydrator, they’re ready to be 
stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight. 
 
For best results, store batches of vegetables together, but keep them in 
separate containers. For example, keep all dried tomatoes in a gallon jar, but 
inside the jar, divide them into separate storage bags, with each bag holding 
tomatoes dried on different days. This way, if something isn’t quite right about 
a particular batch of vegetables, your entire season’s storage isn’t ruined. 
You can store dried vegetables for up to a year as long as they are kept dry 
and out of sunlight.
Dried vegetables can be used for snacking and adding to soups and stews 
in the last few minutes of cooking. To rehydrate your dried vegetables add 
1
1⁄2 cups boiling water to 1 cup of dried vegetables. Let them stand for 20 to 
30 minutes to absorb the water. If all the water is absorbed and they’re not 
as plump as you’d like, add about 2 cups additional water and let them stand 
until most of the water is absorbed. Use the vegetables as you would raw 
ones; cook them or add them to a soup or stew. A good rule of thumb is 1 cup 
of dried vegetables equals two cups of reconstituted vegetables. 
 
Avoid pouring or sprinkling vegetables over a steaming pot, straight from 
the storage container. Doing so can cause the moisture from the steam to 
condense in the container and promote mold. Always pour dried vegetables 
into a separate dish or your hand before adding to your recipe.
Signs of trouble: Good 
vegetables gone bad
Although it doesn’t happen often — especially if you follow instructions 
carefully — sometimes your vegetables don’t dry properly. Or maybe they 
dried all right, but something happened during storage. Here are the warning 
signs for dried vegetables that aren’t safe to eat:

282
Part V: Drying and Storing 
 
✓ Black or brown specks suddenly showing up on food. This is mildew 
on the surface that can make you sick. 
 
✓ Moisture building up inside the storage container. Whether you store 
your dried produce in a bag or glass jar, no moisture should ever be 
inside the container, even when the food’s been stored for a long time.
 
✓ An off odor to the vegetables. You can detect this when first opening 
the storage container or by holding a handful of vegetables up to your 
nose and sniffing. This is a sign of mildew, due to moisture being present. 
 
✓ Vegetables sticking together after being stored. There should not be 
any stickiness to the vegetable pieces when stored; they should remain 
loose and easily separated throughout the storage life. 
Drying Common Vegetables
Having dried vegetables in your pantry makes good sense. They are quick 
to fix, and they let you keep that summer-fresh flavor year round. Dried 
vegetables take up much less room, too, than their nondried counterparts. 
Your family will marvel at these fresh-tasting foods when the snow is flying!
 
The recipes in this section assume you have an electric dehydrator with an 
adjustable temperature gauge. If your dehydrator doesn’t have a thermostat, 
check your vegetables periodically for doneness and evaluate their appearance, 
using the information in the recipes as a guide.
Beans, shelled
Shell beans are those that grow all season and are picked at the same time. 
The beans in this category can include soybeans, navy beans, kidney beans, 
lentils, and more. All require the same drying process. 
Dried beans are a wonderful addition to the pantry. They add protein and 
bulk to many types of foods and make recipes go farther with little change in 
the overall taste. Once cooked, dried beans can be made into thick, creamy 
dips and sandwich spreads.

 Chapter 18: Drying Vegetables for Snacks and Storage
 1 Remove the pods and collect the beans. Place the beans on the dehydrator tray(s) in a 
single layer, adding enough to fill, but be sure that the beans are in a single layer on the 
trays.
 2 Set your dehydrator temperature to 120 degrees and dry the beans for 6 to 8 hours, or 
until you can break a bean in half by hitting it with a hammer or other heavy object. 
Rotate the trays occasionally to facilitate even drying.
 3 Remove your dried beans from the trays, place them in a tightly sealed container, and 
freeze them overnight to kill any tiny bug eggs that may be hiding in them.
 4 Store your dried beans for up to one year.

Dried Shell Beans
Dried shell beans take up little room on the pantry shelf. Store yours in quart-sized jars 
because they look so pretty and are easy to pour from. 
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Drying time: 6 to 8 hours
Yield: 11/2 cups 
1 pound of shell beans of your choice 
 
Leave these beans on the vine until the pods are dry and shriveled. When you 
can hear the beans rattling inside the dry pods, it’s time to pick them. Many 
times, dried beans in the pod are available at your local farmer’s market, 
where you can buy them inexpensively by the pound.

 1 Cut off the leaf and root ends of your beets and cook the beets in boiling water just long 
enough to slip the skins off easily (this may take from 5 to 15 minutes). Thinly slice the 
beats and arrange them in a single layer on your dehydrator trays. 
 2 Set your dehydrator temperature to 120 degrees and dry the beets for 8 to 10 hours, or 
until the slices are hard. Rotate the trays occasionally to facilitate even drying.
 3 Place the dried beets in an airtight container and store for six months in a cool dry 
place, out of direct sunlight.
Tip: An easy way to get the skin off a beet is to drop each boiled beet into ice water for a 
few seconds before pulling off the skins.

Dried Beets
For drying beets, choose young, firm beets. Avoid large ones that can be fibrous. To use 
dried slices, eat them as-is or boil for 30 minutes in plain water, until soft once again. 
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Drying time: 8 to 10 hours
Yield: 2 cups 
2 pounds of beets
Beets
Beets are naturally sweet and even more so when dried. They are great to 
eat out of hand, or dipped in a vegetable dip. Beets are also wonderful when 
reconstituted in boiling water.

 1 Remove any tough outer leaves; then core and shred the cabbage. Blanch the shredded 
cabbage for 2 minutes in boiling water and cool immediately in ice water. Drain well. 
Place the cabbage shreds in a thin layer on the dehydrator trays.
 2 Set your dehydrator temperature to 120 degrees and dry the cabbage shreds for 6 to 10 
hours, stirring every few hours to keep them from sticking together and rotating the 
trays occasionally to facilitate even drying. Start checking for doneness after 4 hours. 
Completely dried cabbage will shrink quite a bit and feel brittle. 
 3 Store the dried cabbage in glass jars or plastic bags, in a cool, dry place.

Select the brightest and heaviest cabbage heads to dry. To use the dried cabbage, 
measure out the amount desired and sprinkle it directly into boiling soups or stews.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Drying time: 6 to 10 hours
Yield: 2 cups 
11/2 pounds fresh cabbage 
Cabbage
Dried cabbage is a great way to add bulk and flavor to soups and stews. You 
can use cabbage in everything from tomato-based to clear broth soups. Your 
family probably won’t know what that filler in the soup is, but they’ll know 
that it tastes great.

Carrots
Carrots are a well-known vegetable, loved by everyone. They are also prolific 
in the garden and easy to find at farmer’s markets. If you’re lucky enough to 
buy or grow bunches of them, drying carrots is easy and works very well. 
 1 Scrub the carrot skin with a vegetable brush to remove any trace of dirt. Cut off the 
tops and about 
1⁄4 inch of the carrot itself to remove any of the green, bitter part of the 
carrot. Then cut the carrots into 
1⁄8-inch slices or shred finely. Blanch the slices or 
shreds for 2 minutes in boiling water and then cool immediately in ice water. Drain well. 
Layer carrot slices or shreds in a single layer on your dehydrator trays. 
 2 Set the temperature on your dehydrator to 120 degrees and dry the carrots for 8 to 10 
hours, or until they’re tough and leathery, stirring at least once to ensure that the 
pieces don’t stick and rotating the trays periodically to facilitate even drying.
 3 Store the dried carrots for up to one year in a tightly sealed container.
Tip: To remove as much water as possible from the blanched carrots, especially for shreds, 
use paper towels.

Dried Carrots
The best carrots for drying are young and tender. You can add dried, shredded carrots 
as-is to sweetbreads and cakes for added fiber and natural sweetness; they’ll absorb 
moisture and become delicious during the cooking process. You can also add dried 
slices to any soup or stew and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes. Or try sprinkling 
shredded carrot directly into eggs when making omelets. They’ll cook as the eggs do 
and add a colorful look to the dish.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Drying time: 8 to 10 hours
Yield: 1 cup 
1 pound fresh carrots 

287
 Chapter 18: Drying Vegetables for Snacks and Storage
Corn
Corn is another popular vegetable. It is not often dried at home, due to the 
availability of it frozen. Yet drying corn is an easy way to take advantage of 
the abundance in spring. 
 1 Husk the corn ears and blanch them in boiling water for 3 minutes. Cool immediately 
and drain. Cut the kernels from the cob, taking care to cut cleanly and not go over the 
same area more than once with your knife. (This keeps the cut corn from becoming too 
sticky with corn milk.) Layer the kernels in a single layer on trays.
 2 Set the temperature on your dehydrator to 120 degrees and dry the corn for 5 to 7 
hours, stirring every 2 hours to prevent sticking and rotate the trays to facilitate even 
drying. Dried kernels will be hard and brittle throughout. 
 3 Store the dried corn up to one year in a tightly sealed container.

 1 Wash and trim the beans as you usually would to eat. Blanch them for 2 minutes in boil-
ing water and then chill immediately in cold water and drain well. Arrange the beans in 
a single layer on your drying trays. 
 2 Set the temperature on your dehydrator to 120 degrees and dry the beans for 8 hours, 
stirring at least once to prevent sticking and rotating the trays occasionally to facilitate 
even drying. Properly dried beans are leathery and shriveled.

Dried Green Beans
Select young, smooth beans; avoid those that have grown enough to develop seeds 
inside. To use dried green beans, drop dried beans into simmering soup and cook until 
softened, about 30 minutes. Although there are recipes for it, we don’t recommend 
rehydrating plain green beans. The results are always mushy. 
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Drying time: 8 hours
Yield: 
1⁄2 cup 
2 
1⁄2 pounds fresh green beans 
Green Beans
Green beans have a special place in my pantry. I (Karen) remember when I 
lived in my cabin, and dried my beans, strung like beads onto string, over my 
woodstove. They were a staple vegetable for my winter meals. I now use my 
dehydrator and although not as interesting a story, they still come out perfect.

Greens
Greens are powerhouses of nutrition in a small package. If your family is not 
used to eating greens, you can use them as a flavorful addition to any soup or 
stir fry. You can add dried greens to your tomato sauce to add a lot of nutri-
tion. Your family will not even notice. 
 1 Trim and wash the greens thoroughly to remove any fine grit. Blanch the greens until 
they are limp, about 2 minutes. Spread them in a thin layer onto your drying trays. 
 2 Set the temperature on your dehydrator to 120 degrees and dry the greens for 4 to 6 
hours, or until the greens are crispy, stirring once to keep them from sticking together 
and rotating the trays occasionally to facilitate even drying. 
 3 Store your dried greens for up to one year in a tightly sealed container.
Note: Check drying greens carefully to ensure they are layered loosely enough to fully dry. 
Greens that are stuck together may hold moisture and develop mold. 
Vary It!: You can create a powder to add as-is to any sauce or baked good. Simply pulverize 
the dried greens in a food processor and then dry them in your dehydrator for at least 4 
hours.

Onions
Onions are a familiar vegetable, even dried. They are a tasty addition to many 
foods, and if added in dried, tiny pieces, often are overlooked by those who 
claim to not like them. 
 
Dry onions separately from other vegetables or their strong odor will permeate 
throughout. Once dried, they don’t overpower other foods and can be mixed 
with other vegetables when making your own blends. You may also want to 
dry them in an out-of-the-way area. The drying process makes the onions 
smell quite strong. 
 1 Thinly slice your onions or chop them evenly so that the pieces are of uniform size to 
facilitate even drying times. Arrange the onion slices or chunks in a thin layer on your 
drying trays. 
 2 Set the temperature on your dehydrator to 120 degrees and dry until brittle, about 12 
hours, rotating the trays every 4 hours or so to ensure even drying. 
 3 Store your dried onions for up to one year in a tightly sealed container.

Dried Onions
Select firm, unblemished onions for drying. You can add dried onions to any dish that 
you normally use onions in. If needed, simply add hot water to dried onion, soaking for 
15 minutes, before adding to your dish.

Peas
Peas make a great addition to your dried pantry. They blend well in many 
recipes and add a bright pop of color and flavor. Peas are one vegetable that 
many children love. 
 1 Shell and blanch your peas for 2 minutes in boiling water; then chill in ice water and 
drain. Arrange the peas in a thin layer on your drying trays.
 2 Set the temperature on your dehydrator to 120 degrees and dry until the peas are shriv-
eled and hard, about 9 to 12 hours, stirring at least once to prevent sticking and rotat-
ing the trays periodically to facilitate even drying.

Peppers, sweet
Drying peppers is a great way to add this tasty vegetable to your cooking. It 
only takes a few pieces to really turn up the flavor. Another nice thing about 
drying peppers is that when dried, they take up only a tiny portion of space, 
versus freezing. Be sure to dry at least one batch of these for your winter 
pantry. 
 1 Wash, core, and remove all of the white membrane and seeds from your green peppers. 
Chop or slice the peppers, making sure that the pieces are of uniform size for even 
drying. Arrange the peppers in a single layer on your drying trays. 
 2 Set the temperature on your dehydrator to 120 degrees and dry the peppers until they 
are leathery and dry throughout, about 8 to 10 hours, stirring at least once and rotating 
the trays to facilitate even drying. 
 3 Store the dried peppers for up to one year in a tightly sealed container.
Tip: Depending on the size of the dehydrator, you may need to divide and dry the bell pep-
pers into two batches.

Dried Sweet Peppers
Select heavy, unblemished peppers for drying. To use, add peppers directly to any dish 
calling for pepper, without rehydrating. If desired, soak pieces in boiling water for 30 
minutes, until soft. Use the same as fresh.

Potatoes, white or sweet
Potatoes are a great dried vegetable. Having these on hand and ready saves 
time and work by cutting out almost all of the prep time taken in peeling and 
slicing.
 
When you dry potatoes, make sure that they’re completely dry; otherwise, 
they’ll mildew during storage. 
 1 Wash and peel the potatoes. Cut them into 
1⁄2-inch strips for shoestring potatoes, or 
1⁄8-inch slices, making sure all pieces are of uniform size for even drying. Blanch the 
potatoes for 5 minutes and drain. Arrange them in an single layer on your drying trays. 
 2 Set the temperature on your dehydrator to 120 degrees and dry the potatoes until 
they’re hard and brittle, at least 10 to 12 hours, stirring after the first 4 hours to prevent 
sticking. Rotate the trays occasionally to facilitate even drying.
 3 Store the dried potatoes for up to one year in a tightly sealed container or in plastic 
freezer bags.
Tip: To prevent your potatoes from turning brown during drying, dip them in a mixture of 2 
tablespoons lemon juice to 1 quart of water prior to drying.

Dried Potatoes
Select young, unblemished potatoes for drying. Because they have such a long drying 
time, plan on drying potatoes overnight. To use dried potatoes, cover them with water 
and bring to a simmer until soft again — about 45 minutes. Dried sweet potatoes make a 
great snack as-is.

 1 Blanch the shoestring sweet potatoes in boiling water for 5 minutes and dip in ice cold 
water. Drain well. Dry the potatoes on paper towels to remove any outside moisture. 
 2 Place the sweet potatoes in an 8-quart bowl and add olive oil. Toss well to coat. Spread 
the shoestring pieces in a single layer on your drying trays. Sprinkle with salt. 
 3 Set the temperature on your dehydrator to 120 degrees and dehydrate the shoestring 
potatoes until they’re crispy, at least 12 hours. Rotate the trays occasionally to facilitate 
even drying.
 4 Store (if you can!) in a cool, dry place. 
Vary It! For a slightly different flavor, add an additional seasoning you like at Step 2.

Pumpkin
Pumpkin is a great item for your pantry. Its naturally sweet flavor is also 
rich in vitamins. Try using pumpkin in place of zucchini for sweetbread, in 
muffins and cakes, as a side dish, with cinnamon and sugar for the holidays, 
and as a creamy base for soups. Drying pumpkin is a great way to have 
enough on hand all year. 
1 pound sweet potatoes, washed, peeled and 
sliced into shoestrings
1 tablespoon olive oil
1⁄2 teaspoon sea salt
 
Sweet Potato Crunch Sticks
These potatoes are a kid-friendly favorite. If you are looking for a fun, healthy alterna-

 1 Cut the pumpkin in half, remove the seeds, and slice it into workable-size pieces. Peel 
each piece and cut into 1-inch pieces. Blanch the pieces in boiling water for 2 minutes and 
then dip in cold water. Drain well. Spread the blanched pieces in a single layer on trays. 
 2 Set the temperature on your dehydrator to 120 degrees and dry the pumpkin for 
12 to 18 hours, turning the pieces at least once to prevent them from sticking and 
rotating the trays to facilitate even drying. Pumpkin is dried enough when it is leathery 
throughout the entire piece.
 3 Store for up to one year in a tightly sealed container.
Vary It! Make a pumpkin purée: Cook cubes in boiling water until tender and mash until 
smooth. Spread the mashed pumpkin on trays covered with plastic wrap to prevent drip-
ping. Dry for 6 hours, or until you can easily peel off the plastic layer from the pumpkin 
purée. Flip over the purée, and dry it until the pieces are brittle enough to snap when bent. 
You can use this dried purée as an ingredient in any recipe that calls for puréed pumpkin. 
To rehydrate, pour 1 cup boiling water over 1 cup of dried pumpkin purée and let stand for 
30 minutes or until soft.

Tomatoes
Once again, tomatoes are the highlight of the dried food pantry. They are 
loved by almost everyone, dry easily, taste delicious, and have the ability to 
add a tasty kick to any dish. Great for many a meal, try drying as many toma-
toes as you can. You will be surprised at how many you use! 
 
You can also season plain tomatoes to work with either Italian- or Mexican- 
flavored dishes. Prepare a jar of both flavors, using the Tomato Two Way 
recipe. You will always have a quick meal on hand if you keep these in your 
pantry.  
 1 Dip tomatoes in boiling water for 1 minute, and then plunge them into icy water for 30 
seconds. Slip off the skins and core. (Note: If you’re using slicing tomatoes, remove the 
seeds.) Cut the tomatoes into 
1⁄8-inch slices or 
1⁄4-inch cubes. Take care to cut uniform 
pieces. Place slices or cubes onto trays, in a single layer. 
 2 Set the temperature on your dehydrator to 120 degrees and dry your tomatoes for 14 to 
16 hours. Remove the trays, flip all slices over or stir the cubes well, and dry again for 
another 6 to 8 hours or until brittle. Rotate the trays occasionally to facilitate even 
drying.

Zucchini
Zucchini is always plentiful in any garden. The trick is to pick it often and do 
not let it grow to gigantic proportions. Young zucchini has a tender skin and 
doesn’t need to be peeled before drying. One fun way to enjoy zucchini is to 
make zucchini chips.
 
Because dried zucchini is virtually tasteless in your dishes, you can easily add 
nutrients to a dish without changing the flavor.

place the cubes or slices in single layer on your drying trays. 
 2 Set the temperature on your dehydrator to 120 degrees and allow the zucchini to dry 
for 8 hours, stirring at least once to prevent sticking. Rotate the trays occasionally to 
facilitate even drying. Properly dried zucchini is crisp. 
 3 Store the dried zucchini for up to one year in a tightly sealed container.

Dried Zucchini
Select young, small- to medium-size zucchini. To use, sprinkle directly into your soup or 
stew and cook until tender. Add shredded zucchini directly into any baked goods with-
out rehydrating.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Drying time: 8 hours
Yield: 1
1⁄2 cup
10 pounds fresh zucchini (about 30 medium)
 1 Wash and slice the zucchini into 
1⁄8-inch thin slices. Place the slices in a large bowl or 
gallon-size plastic, sealable storage bag. Pour the Italian-style dressing over the slices 
and toss to coat. Marinate the zucchini in the dressing for 15 minutes. Place marinated 
slices in a single layer on your drying trays.
 
Zucchini Chips
These crispy chips are the perfect way to use up the piles of zucchini you always end 
up with during the summer. Keep in mind, though, that they absorb moisture from the 
air quickly. Once opened, use them as quickly as possible to avoid them becoming soft.
Preparation time: 10 minutes for preparing, 15 minutes for marinating
Drying time: 12 hours, or until crisp
Yield: 4 servings
1 pound zucchini (about 3 medium)
1⁄4 cup Italian-style salad dressing

D
rying herbs is a wonderful way to be sure 
you have the freshest seasoning possible for your cooking. Because you 
pick herbs throughout the growing season, you can collect the finest herbs 
again and again, drying them as you go. Drying herbs is also an easy way to 
create your own signature blends for cooking and herbal tea. You will always 
have your favorites on hand if you dry them yourself. 
This chapter shares the most common herbs that dry well and some recipes 
for making herbal blends that everyone can enjoy.
Drying Common and Not-So-Common Herbs 
Herbs are one of the most important and expensive ingredients in any dish. 
Drying them can save you a lot of money and give you much fresher and 
fuller flavor than any found on a store shelf. 
The best herbs for drying are those that are resinous, or contain the most 
oils. The oils are where the scents and flavor come from. Herbs that have 
very juicy stems and overly thick leaves don’t dry well.
 
If you find that your herb of choice seems to become tasteless or dries to a 
black mess, try freezing that herb instead. Two herbs that are commonly used 
in cooking but do not dry well are chives and basil. Some have luck drying 
basil at a low temperature, but we don’t recommend it for those just starting 
out. Blend in a little olive oil with these too fussy herbs and freeze instead (go 
to Chapter 15 for details).

Part V: Drying and Storing 
The best herbs for drying are those you grow in your own garden. If you 
don’t have a green thumb, the next best thing is to buy your herbs from 
a farmer’s market that sells produce grown without chemical sprays and 
picked as recently as the day you buy it.
 
✓ If you grow your own herbs: Start small, growing only what you can 
easily care for because you’ll have to pick your herbs many times over 
the gardening season. You can simply dry them as they become ready, 
and combine the fully dried herbs with the ones dried before. 
 
 Harvest your herbs just after the morning dew has dried, but before 
the hot, noonday sun has hit them. The heat from the sun drives the 
fragrant oils out of the leaves and blossoms, so the herbs have less 
flavor. 
 
✓ If you choose herbs from a farmer’s market: Look for fresh, vibrant 
leaves, a strong smell, and clean, healthy-looking plants. Avoid buying 
wilted or shriveled herbs, as they have been picked too long ago. Don’t 
hesitate to ask for a taste of a leaf. You may also want to crush a piece of 
leaf in your hand, to see if it smells strongly of the fresh herb. 
The following sections outline several herbs that are easy to dry. When 
selecting your herbs, choose those that you’re familiar with first.
 
You can use either an oven or a dehydrator set between 115 and 125 degrees. 
This temperature is just high enough to heat but not cook the herbs. Don’t set 
the temperature any lower than 115 degrees though, because it takes too long 
and sometimes allows mildew.
Store your dried herbs in small containers. Glass jars with tight-fitting lids 
work best. For your herbs to maintain the best flavor during storage, keep 
them away from heat, light, and your refrigerator.
Air-drying fresh herbs
An electric dehydrator and oven aren’t your 
only options when it comes to drying herbs. 
Air-drying them is an easy alternative. Follow 
these steps to air-dry herbs and check out the 
figure as well:
 1. If you’re harvesting herbs from a garden, cut 
the stems, don’t pick them, leaving an extra 
inch or two for tying them in bunches.
 
 Harvest the herbs in the morning after any 
moisture on the leaves has dried.
 2. Rinse your herbs quickly by dipping them 
in a bowl of cool water and shaking off the 
excess water.
 
 Pat them dry with a paper towel, making 
sure they’re completely dry to prevent 
mildew.
 3. Tie the herb stalks near the cut part of the 
stem in small bunches (no more than five or 
six stems) with cotton string or thread.

303
 Chapter 19: Drying Herbs
 
 Don’t mix your herb bunches because fla-
vors transfer during the drying process.
 4. Either hang the herbs upside down in a 
warm room (the kitchen works well) near 
a south-facing window and out of direct 
sunlight or place the tied herb bundle in a 
paper bag with holes or slits cut in it for 
air circulation before hanging the bag in a 
warm room. Place the herb bundle upside 
down in the bag with the stems toward 
the top opening of the bag. Tie the top of 
the bag closed. The bag protects the herbs 
from light and catches any loose seeds for 
replanting your herbs.
 
 Your herbs will dry in two to three weeks 
with good air circulation.
Herbs are dry when they crumble easily. 
Remove the leaves from the stems. Crush soft 
leaves (like basil, sage, and oregano) by hand. 
Store harder leaves (like rosemary, tarragon, 
and thyme) whole, crushing them with a rolling 
pin before using them.
Chamomile
Chamomile is a delicate flower that is as lovely as it is useful. Harvesting 
chamomile, however, is difficult in a major scale, making it loved by home 
gardeners but expensive as an herb farm crop. 
 
Chamomile has a lightly fruity taste. Because the taste differs slightly from 
variety to variety, tasting is the best way to find the right chamomile for your 
garden.
To harvest chamomile for drying, pick the individual chamomile flowers 
as they bloom and just after the dew has dried in the morning. This is very 

304
Part V: Drying and Storing 
important because chamomile’s delicate scent is easily lost if you’re not 
careful. Some leaves are fine to include because they also have some 
chamomile flavor.
To dry chamomile, follow these steps:
 
1. Lay the flowers in a single layer on trays. 
 
2. Set your oven or dehydrator temperature to between 115 and 125 
degrees and dry for 3 to 5 hours, checking carefully after 4 hours and 
rotating the trays periodically to facilitate even drying.
 
 You don’t want to overdry them. Flowers are fully dry when the tiny 
petals curl inward, and the center of the blossom is totally dry. 
 
3. Store in a airtight container, out of sunlight. 
To use your dried chamomile, pour 1 cup of boiling water over 1 tablespoon 
dried flowers; then cover and steep for 3 minutes. (Don’t steep chamomile 
too long; it can produce a bitter taste.) 
Dill
Dill, an herb that grows anywhere, has tiny leaves and a large, flowering seed 
head. Harvest the leaves any time you want. Use dill leaves in dressings and 
pickle mixes. It makes a refreshing dip for vegetables and tastes great added 
to your summer salads.
 
Dill can quickly become an invasive plant. Once the plant goes to seed, it starts 
popping up everywhere. Be sure to keep it in check by trimming off the flowers 
and seeds before the plant makes itself a permanent member of your garden. 
Drying dill is super easy. Follow these steps:
 
1. Lay the dill leaves in a single, loose layer on trays. 
 
2. Set your oven or dehydrator temperature to between 100 and 115 
degrees and dry 3 to 5 hours, rotating the trays periodically to facilitate 
even drying.
 
 Properly dried dill leaves are crispy.
 
3. Store dried dill in airtight containers, out of light. 
 
 This herb loses its delicate flavor quickly if left in sunlight for too long. 
 
Chewing a few dill seeds can help with indigestion. Historically, dill was an 
ingredient in gripe water for colicky infants. 

305
 Chapter 19: Drying Herbs
Marjoram
Marjoram is sometimes mislabeled as oregano, and the two do look surprisingly 
similar. Marjoram, sometimes called sweet marjoram, is the perfect addition 
to any recipe that calls for oregano. Many people dislike the bitter taste that 
oregano can have, and using marjoram takes care of this problem. I (Amy) 
find that marjoram’s taste has much more depth than oregano, too. (I am a 
true convert to this delicious herb!)
If you’re growing your own marjoram, harvest its leaves when they are 
young. Cut the soft stems in the morning, after the dew has dried and before 
the sun becomes too hot. If you’re buying marjoram at a farmer’s market, 
look for young, small leaves with a bright green color and aromatic scent. 
To dry marjoram, follow these steps:
 
1. Lay the marjoram stems on trays, allowing room between them for 
proper air circulation. 
 
2. Set your dehydrator’s temperature to between 115 and 125 degrees 
and dry your marjoram for 3 to 5 hours, checking carefully after 3 
hours and rotating the trays periodically to facilitate even drying.
 
 Properly dried marjoram leaves crumble easily. 
 
3. Store the stems, whole, in a cool dry place, away from sunlight. 
To use dried marjoram, crumble leaves in your hand before adding to the 
dish and add the herb in the last 10 minutes of cooking to keep its flavor. 
 
For the best flavor, remove flowering tops of marjoram as they appear. Once it 
flowers, the scent and flavor fade. Harvesting just before flowering, however, 
produces the strongest flavor of all. 
Mint
Mint is arguably the herb most people are familiar with and also the easiest 
herb to grow. It only requires sunlight and water to thrive. Yes, you can grow 
mint on a counter in a glass of water — forever! 
Mint comes in dozens of flavors, with more being created all the time. From 
citrus to chocolate, mints are available for any palate. Grow as many varieties 
as you want, but keep them contained! And harvest them often, throughout 
the growing season, for drying. 

306
Part V: Drying and Storing 
 
Mint is a highly invasive herb and will overtake a garden within one growing 
season if left to spread on its own. Plant mint in a container to keep from 
having it go wild (literally). If you grow more than one variety of mint, plant 
them at least 10 feet apart to avoid cross-pollination. Although you will still 
get mint, it will no longer be true to the original scent you planted, if cross-
pollinated. 
To dry mint, follow these steps:
 
1. Cut the stems that seem to want to straggle, and lay them on a drying 
tray. 
 
2. Set your dehydrator or oven temperature to between 115 and 125 
degrees and dry for 3 to 5 hours, rotating the trays periodically to 
facilitate even drying.
 
 Properly dried mint leaves easily crumble in your hand. 
 
3. Store mint in airtight containers. 
 
Try  making it into tea or adding a few leaves, crumbled, to boiled potatoes. 
Oregano
Oregano is another easy-to-dry herb. Used in any tomato-based dish, oregano 
adds a distinct flavor to your meals. By drying oregano, you ensure that you 
have plenty of this popular flavoring available throughout the winter months. 
Use only young leaves, as older oregano has a tendency to taste bitter. 
To dry oregano, pick the young leaves once the dew has dried in the morning 
and then follow these steps:
 
1. Remove any leaves that have insect damage or have been crushed 
while harvesting. 
 
 These sometimes turn an unappealing black when drying. 
 
2. Arrange in a single layer on trays, but don’t fill them too full. You 
want air to flow around them. 
 
3. Set the temperature on your dehydrator to between 115 and 125 
degrees and dry the oregano for 3 to 5 hours, rotating the trays 
periodically to facilitate even drying.
 
 Properly dried oregano is dry and crumbly. 
 
4. Store dried oregano in its whole form until ready to use. 
To use dried oregano, crush the leaves in your hand just before adding to the 
dish. Add oregano to the dish in the last 10 minutes of cooking to preserve 
the flavor.

307
 Chapter 19: Drying Herbs
Rosemary
Rosemary is a centerpiece to any herb garden. Its scent is recognizable by 
nearly everyone, and its lovely bluish flowers are truly special. Rosemary 
can be harvested throughout the season. To dry, cut the smaller, side stems 
where they branch off from the main stem and then follow these steps:
 
1. Lay the whole stems onto the drying trays. 
 
2. Dry the herb for 6 to 8 hours at a temperature between 110 and 115 
degrees, rotating the trays periodically to facilitate even drying.
 
 They’re done when the leaves slightly shrivel and release from the stem 
easily. 
 
3. Remove the leaves by holding the stem over a dish or container and 
running your fingers along the stem. 
 
 The leaves come off with a gentle touch and you are left with a clean 
stem. 
 
4. Store rosemary leaves whole, and only break them up right before 
adding to your recipe. 
 
 This keeps most of the flavor inside until needed. 
 
Save the dried rosemary stems for making kabobs. They contain plenty of the 
rosemary flavor, and make a unique presentation. Use the stems as you would 
skewers.
Sage
Sage is an easy-to-grow herb that is available as seeds or plants that quickly 
grow into small, lovely bushes. You can use any variety of garden sage for 
drying. Some offer a stronger flavor than others, so be sure to taste it before 
purchasing to find your favorite. To dry sage leaves, harvest them as they 
become large enough (
1⁄2 inch or more in length) and then follow these steps:
 
1. Lay out your sage leaves in a single layer on your drying trays.
 
 Be sure to leave room between the leaves for even drying. 
 
2. Dry the herb for 6 to 8 hours at a temperature between 115 and 125 
degrees, rotating the trays periodically to facilitate even drying.
 
 It’s dry enough if a leaf crumbles in your fingers. 
 
 Be careful to dry these leaves thoroughly; they are slightly thicker than 
many other herbs and require careful attention. 
 
3. Store the dried leaves in their whole form until needed. 

308
Part V: Drying and Storing 
 
 If you find that you use rubbed sage often, dry the whole leaves and rub 
them through a mesh strainer to create a fluffy sage powder perfect for 
cooking. 
Stevia
Stevia may not be as widely known as some of the others in this list, but it is 
a very useful herb. It’s been used for hundreds of years in other parts of the 
world as a replacement for sugar. Stevia users have found that it has a slight 
licorice aftertaste. You may find that your family enjoys stevia as much as 
sugar! 
To dry, pick the stevia leaves as needed throughout the growing season and 
then follow these steps:
 
1. Lay the leaves on your drying trays in a single layer. 
 
 Be careful to not overlap, as they can mold quickly if left in a warm place 
without adequate circulation. 
 
2. Set your oven or dehydrator temperature to between 115 and 125 
degrees and dry for 4 to 6 hours, rotating the trays periodically to 
facilitate even drying.
 
 Properly dried stevia leaves crumble easily in your hand. 
 
3. Store in an airtight container, away from direct sunlight. 
To make stevia sweetener, steep the dry leaves in boiling water and leave 
them to cool. You can then measure the resulting “tea” by the drop into any 
drink that requires a sweet taste. Be warned, it is extremely sweet — 300 times 
sweeter than table sugar, in fact — so start with a drop at a time. 
 
If you find that you always sweeten a particular herb tea, try adding 
1⁄2 teaspoon 
of dried stevia to the original recipe. Taste the sweetness of the tea and adjust 
the dried herb as needed.
Tarragon
Tarragon is an herb that, sadly, many people overlook. Tarragon has a slight 
anise flavor, dries well, and makes any chicken, egg, or cheese dish sing. The 
next time you serve a meal including this beautiful herb, your family will ask 
what that secret flavor is. 
To dry tarragon, pick young tarragon leaves throughout the growing season 
and then follow these steps:

309
 Chapter 19: Drying Herbs
 
1. Remove the stems that have become woody and place leaves in a 
single layer on your drying trays. 
 
 If you find that the leaves slip through the holes in your trays, leave the 
stems on during drying to prevent this.
 
2. Set your oven or dehydrator temperature to between 115 and 125 
degrees and dry for 4 to 6 hours, rotating the trays periodically to 
facilitate even drying.
 
 Properly dried tarragon leaves crumble easily in your hand.
 
 Be careful not to overdry. Check carefully after the first 2 hours, and 
every 30 minutes after that.
 
3. Store in a cool, dry place, out of direct sunlight. 
 
 Tarragon loses its flavor rapidly, so be sure to dry just what you need 
for the winter months. 
 
To avoid tarragon leaves becoming an unappetizing black, pick them quickly 
and dry them right away. 
Thyme
Thyme has many uses: It tastes great mixed with other herbs for flavoring 
Italian dishes and it can hold its own when paired with poultry. Thyme comes 
in many varieties, but the drying technique is the same. Follow these steps:
 
1. Snip off stems as soon as your plants are large enough for drying and 
lay them whole, in a single layer, on your drying tray. 
 
2. Set your oven or dehydrator temperature to between 110 to 115 
degrees and dry the thyme for 4 to 6 hours, rotating the trays 
periodically to facilitate even drying.
 
 Properly dried thyme leaves are dry and crisp. 
 
3. Store dried thyme, stems and all, in a cool, dry place away from 
sunlight. 
 
 Thyme loses its flavor quickly when left in sunlight. 
When it comes time to use your dried thyme, crush the tiny stems right along 
with the leaves. If stems are too woody, strip leaves off, right before use.
 
The next time you have a cough or cold, make a tea out of dried thyme leaves. 
Thyme tea tastes very soothing when you are congested.

Getting Creative with 
Herb Cooking Blends
Creating herbal blends for cooking is a matter of using your senses to choose 
what smells and looks best. If you match the types of foods you eat most 
often with herbs that compliment these foods, you will be able to create your 
own signature blends. 
Dry each herb separately as explained in the preceding sections before 
combining. Once your herbs are dry, you can experiment with different 
combinations of flavors to see what tastes the best. 
 
Freshly dried herbs have far more flavor and aroma than those dried and sold 
in a grocery store. So use a light hand when you season with freshly dried 
herbs. Add your herbs at the end of the cooking process to make the most of 
the flavor. 
 
In addition to the herb mix recipes that follow, try creating an herb-butter 
blend: Combine your favorite herbs and roll a cube of butter in them to coat 
the stick, or soften the butter to room temperature and mix the dried herbs 
directly into the butter. Chill the butter; cut it into slices or make rounds with 
a melon baller for serving.
 
Italian Herb Mix
From pizza to salad dressing, this mix is the taste that gets used the most in my (Amy’s)

Herbs for Teas
Nothing is more enjoyable or relaxing than a cup of steaming hot tea. Nothing, 
that is, except relaxing with a special herbal tea you’ve made yourself. In this 
section, you find out how to create your own tea blends. Make distinct recipes 
for any occasion, and pick the perfect herb for the job.
 
Rice Mix
A great way to use dried herbs is to use them in ready-to-make mixes. These are much 
better than the standard mixes you find at the store. To prepare the rice, add the rice 
mix to 2 cups of water in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan. Bring the rice to a boil over high heat, 
stir, cover, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook for about 30 minutes (don’t lift 
that lid to peek). Remove the rice from the heat and let the rice stand for 30 minutes. 
Fluff the rice with a fork and serve immediately.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 1
1⁄4 cups rice mix
1 cup long-grain rice
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
2 to 3 teaspoons dried herbs of your choice
1⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt

 Chapter 19: Drying Herbs
Like seasoning a dish, herbal tea is a matter of blending herbs that taste great 
together to create a new flavor you love. The same recipes that you use for 
hot tea work equally well for cold tea. You can keep a pitcher of iced, herbal 
tea in the refrigerator for the family during the summer and serve it hot in 
the winter. Mix up your favorite tea blends and keep them on hand for quick, 
tasty drinks when the kids want something other than water. They are fast to 
make and naturally sweet. 
 
Make ice cubes from your leftover hot tea. Use these frozen tea cubes to cool 
down another ice tea. You will not dilute your delicate tea while cooling it, and 
using a second flavor to make your ice cubes with makes the entire glass taste 
great!
Cover steaming tea while it steeps to contain the volatile (and tasty) oils that 
make the tea so delicious.

Before refrigeration and artificial preservatives, cold storage was the way 
to go if you needed to store produce over the winter. The basic idea behind 
cold storage is that you can prolong the shelf life of both fresh and canned 
produce by keeping them in a cool, dark place under just the right conditions. 
By combining the perfect mix of temperature and humidity, you can expand 
your storage to a large variety of foods. Temperature and humidity aren’t 
the only considerations, however. An area used for cold storage also needs 
to have proper ventilation to keep the food as fresh as possible. And ease of 
access is vital, too.

Part V: Drying and Storing 
 
✓ Temperature: Cold storage temperatures range from 32 to 60 degrees. 
The right temperature for any given food is one that slows the enzymes 
responsible for decay. Different foods require different storage 
temperatures. Beets, for example, need temps just above freezing; 
pumpkins and squashes, on the other hand, need temps in the 50- to 60- 
degree range. 
 
✓ Humidity: Depending on the foods you want to store, your root cellar 
or alternative cold storage area needs a humidity range from 60 to 95 
percent. Foods such as carrots, parsnips, and turnips store best at 90 to 
95 percent humidity. Sweet potatoes and onions, on the other hand, do 
much better at a humidity of no more than 70 percent. 
 
 If you plan to store foods that require very different humidity and 
temperature levels, you need to use more than one storage area. It’s not 
uncommon to have a dry cold storage area with lower humidity (like 
you’d get in an area that has a cement floor) and a higher humidity area 
(which you get in an area with a dirt or gravel floor)
 
 To keep track of temperature and humidity level in the air, buy a simple 
thermometer unit, called a hydrometer (see Figure 20-1). 
 
✓ Ventilation: No matter what type of storage area you choose, it must be 
able to let warm air out and cool air in. 
 
✓ Ease of access: Because you have to regularly check your stored food, 
you need a place that is easy to get into and that allows you to easily 
move things around.
Read on to find out what your cold-storage options are, and head to the 
section “Preparing Foods for Cold Storage” to discover the optimum humidity 
levels and temperatures required for specific foods.
Tried and true: The traditional root cellar
Root cellars have had a long and important place in the history of food storage. 
Root cellars were most often the actual cellar of old homes and farmhouses. 
These older houses had cellars with dirt floors, perfect for keeping foods 
cool and the humidity higher than average.
If you’re lucky enough to have an actual dirt-floor root cellar, all you need to 
do to store your produce there is provide sturdy shelving and rodent-proof 
the area by covering any holes or potential rodent-friendly entryways with 
wire mesh. You can also place rodent bait in out-of-the-way areas and check 
often for rodent activity. 
 
A preexisting root cellar usually contains some sort of air vent or pipe located 
at the top of the area to allow warm air to rise and escape. If you don’t have 
a preexisting air vent, periodically open a window or door to the outside to 
allow warm air out and fresh air in.

temperature 
and 
humidity.
 
 
In modern homes, cellars (or basements) often have concrete floors and 
are generally too warm and dry for food storage. Carefully measure your 
temperature and moisture content before placing your produce in a cellar that 
may not have optimum conditions. 
DIY storage spaces
If you don’t have a cellar with a dirt floor, there are alternatives. Take a look 
at your cellar layout and consider the areas suggested in the following sections.
Stairwells 
Does a stairwell lead from your basement to the outside? If so, add an insulated 
door to separate the stairwell from the main room, and voilá, you have a cold 
storage space that has built-in shelves: the stairs! Just place bins of produce 
on each step and pans of water under the stairs for moisture, and you have 
an efficient storage area (see Figure 20-2). 
A stairwell is particularly good because the stairs create areas with varying 
temperatures, allowing for a wide array of conditions that can benefit many 
different kinds of foods. 

318
Part V: Drying and Storing 
 
Figure 20-2: 
A stairwell 
converted 
into a cold 
storage 
area.
 
 
Be sure to place a hydrometer in this area, as well as a few, inexpensive 
thermometers on different steps, to gauge the best conditions for your stored 
foods. There will be quite a variation in temperature as you go up the stairs. 
Storm shelters
Do you have a storm shelter (also called a storm cellar)? In the Midwest, 
storm shelters are often underground cellars separate from the house or 
basement. (Think of Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, when she runs through the 
yard to get to the storm cellar during the tornado.) These shelters are perfect 
for adding some shelves and neat bins of produce. They’re below the frost 
line, have adequate ventilation, and are weatherproof. Whether your home 
had a storm shelter when you moved in or you decided to build one yourself, 
be certain to block any ventilation pipes with fine screen to keep out rodent 
activity.
 
Your stored foods will be used up long before the storm season approaches. 
Even so, keep your cold storage organized and neat. 
Straw-bale storage
If you have a small area in your yard, you can construct a simple straw-bale 
storage area (see Figure 20-3) to hold your root crops, like potatoes, rutabagas, 
turnips, and parsnips. 

319
 Chapter 20: Root Cellars and Alternative Storage Spaces
The best location for straw-bale storage is one that tends to stay dry. Don’t 
place these storage areas in high moisture areas (where you generally have 
a buildup of snowdrift, for example, or where water tends to puddle after 
storms). Also, don’t build one close to buildings that protect the area from 
winter temperatures. You want the straw bales to be able to stay freezing 
cold on the outside and yet insulate the produce inside. 
 
Figure 20-3: 
Straw-bale 
storage
 
Once you’ve found a suitable location, follow these steps to build your storage 
area:
 
1. Place two bales of straw in a line, with the ends touching; about 16 
inches away, place two more bales parallel to the first two. 
 
 The spacing is adequate for the bales that are laid on top to cover the 
open space completely. 
 
2. Place one straw bale on each of the remaining ends to enclose a box 
shape in the center.
 
 You’ve just made a large square in the center.
 
3. Cover the ground in the center of the square with a screen. 
 
 You don’t have use the screen, but doing so helps keep your produce 
protected from critters that may be inclined to dig under the whole thing. 

320
Part V: Drying and Storing 
 
4. Layer some soft straw on the bottom of the square to cushion the 
produce.
 
 If you put a screen in the center, place the straw over the screen.
 
5. Layer your root crops, very gently, into the bin. 
 
 Take care to not dump or toss your vegetables. Bruised food quickly 
turns to spoiled food. 
 
6. When the bin is full, layer another couple of inches of straw onto the 
food. 
 
7. Place bales of straw across the top of the now-filled bin. 
 
 Your food is now protected from winter in a breathable storage bin. 
To check on or access the food inside, simply remove the top two bales. 
Replace the bales carefully and evenly to cover the hole each time. In the 
late spring, or when the straw-bale storage area is empty, simply take the bin 
apart, and use the straw as mulch for your garden. 
 
Some people use hay bales for these storage bins, but we don’t recommend 
it. Hay molds rather quickly, sometimes spoiling the produce inside. Hay 
bales also seem to absorb more moisture than straw bales. If you use hay, 
check periodically for moisture damage, and remove the offending produce 
immediately. 
Rubber trash cans 
You can bury these up to their rims in the ground, place your produce inside, 
put on the lid, and then cover the whole thing with a thick layer of straw for 
a simple cold storage arrangement. These bins are easy to wash and the tight 
lids keep the foods fresh and sanitary and keep rodents out.
Following Simple Storage Rules
Underground storage is the fastest and possibly easiest way to store foods. 
There are, however, some rules to follow, no matter what variety of food you 
want to keep over the winter: 
 
✓ Be careful about the quality of the food you store: Foods must be in 
perfect condition — not too ripe or picked too early. Overly ripe fruit is 
extremely fragile and in the last stage before naturally decaying. Food 
that’s too green doesn’t do particularly well, either. These foods may 
change color or become agreeably soft in storage, but they won’t truly 
ripen and develop their best flavor in these conditions.

321
 Chapter 20: Root Cellars and Alternative Storage Spaces
 
 Make sure you pick your food at just the right ripeness, as fresh 
as possible, and store it immediately. Don’t allow it to sit at room 
temperature while you decide what you are going to do with it.
 
✓ Be careful about how you pair foods: Some foods produce gases that 
make other foods spoil. For instance, apples produce a gas that makes 
potatoes start to sprout. Put these two together, and you’ll end up with 
potatoes that are soft and inedible. Cabbage is a very strongly scented 
food that is better stored in an outside area, away from more delicately 
flavored items. 
 
✓ You must care for the foods, even while in storage. Weekly checking 
for bruising, decay, dryness, and mold is essential. The old adage about 
a rotten apple spoiling the barrel definitely applies here. As the winter 
progresses, remove any produce that has blemishes. Your remaining 
foods will continue to last longer. 
 
 Rearrange your produce carefully. If you’re like me (Amy), after a month, 
you may discover that you’ve used enough of your stored produce to 
enable you to bring the bottom layer up to the top. Be careful of excess 
handling though; gently place each food back in place to avoid bruising. 
 
✓ Pick the right storage container: Choose containers that let you keep 
things neat and very organized. Some ideas:
 
• Rubbermaid-style tubs: These can be stacked when not in use, 
their covers fit tightly, and they can easily be filled with damp 
sand for foods needing increased humidity. Use clear bins to avoid 
colors leaching into foods and so that you can easily see all the 
produce inside.
 
• Wooden bins or boxes: Recycle these from thrift stores and some 
grocery stores. Even if you have to pay a few dollars each, they will 
give years of service and allow for neat, tidy stacking. If stacking 
wooden boxes, place the first row in a line, place a couple of sticks 
across the boxes for air circulation, and then place the next boxes. 
You want to let the moisture and gases escape, which allows the 
food to last longer.
 
• Five-gallon pails: You can find these for next to nothing from 
bakers and other restaurants. You don’t need to include the lid; 
in fact, for cold storage, it is best not to. Fill the clean, dry bucket 
with produce, layer a damp cloth on the top and you can stack 
these buckets in a pyramid shape, allowing plenty of airflow 
between.
 
• Old dressers: You can arrange these unconventional pieces 
against a wall and use the drawers to keep your produce in a dry 
and safe place. Line the drawers with newspaper for easy cleaning. 
Keep them slightly ajar for proper air circulation.

Part V: Drying and Storing 
Preparing Foods for Cold Storage
Foods that store well are generally the less juicy and delicate things, like 
root vegetables and firm fruits. The following sections list several fruits and 
vegetables that keep very well in cold storage. They are foods that many 
families enjoy; they provide a fresh taste when bland winter fare abounds; 
and they extend your food pantry to include fresh, tasty choices. (Note: You 
may be able to extend the life of more tender foods, like eggplant or broccoli, 
but don’t count on them lasting for months as the other foods will. You can 
keep these treats in storage about two weeks, but no longer.) 
 
As a general rule, harvest root crops as late as you can in the season and don’t 
wash the dirt from the roots. Simply use your hand or a rag to remove some of 
the loose soil. 
Apples
Apples store very well. Choose a variety that is known for storage. Kept well, 
apples can last throughout the entire winter — four to six months! Toward 
the end of that time, a perfectly good apple may become slightly shriveled. 
This is simply from the loss of moisture, not nutrition. 
Choose apples that are unblemished and firm (they shouldn’t give at all when 
pressed). Check in bright light for dents and soft spots. 
To store, layer the apples carefully in very cold temperatures (between 30 
and 35 degrees), with a high humidity between 80 and 90 percent. (Place a 
pan of water in the area where they’re stored.) 
 
Try covering your bin of apples with a damp (not dripping) cloth, which  
remains damp for at least a day. And make it a habit to replace the cloth every 
couple of days when you check other stored produce. 
Beets
Beets are prolific and inexpensive to grow, meaning you’ll end up with plenty 
for storage if you plant a few rows. Harvest beets late in the season, after the 
nights become freezing cold. If you’re buying beets at a farmer’s market, look 
for fresh, crisp tops. This is the best indication that the beets are just picked. 
To prepare the beets for storage, cut off the tops, leaving the beet itself intact 
(don’t wash them). Then place the beets in your coldest storage, temperatures 
just above freezing, 32 to 40 degrees, with 90 to 95 percent humidity. To 
increase humidity naturally, place the beets on moist sand. 

323
 Chapter 20: Root Cellars and Alternative Storage Spaces
Some gardeners recommend leaving beets in the ground, covered with a 
thick layer of straw. They say beets and other root crops can be harvested 
directly from the ground into the coldest part of the winter. Be aware, 
though, that rodents may destroy root crops before you get a chance to 
harvest them. So before you follow the advice of the “leave ’em in the 
ground” crowd, make sure you — and not rodents — will be the benefactors.
Cabbage
Cabbage adds bulk and crunch to many winter dishes. Keeping cabbage in 
storage requires a few extra precautions, however, to ensure that it remains 
useable throughout the winter and doesn’t ruin other food nearby. 
First, cabbage gives off a strong odor while in storage, which is normal (don’t 
confuse this smell with spoilage). The problem with the smell is that apples 
and other fruits can absorb the flavor of cabbage. The key is to make sure 
you don’t store cabbage too closely to these other types of foods. If you must 
store cabbage close to other foods, wrap individual heads with newspaper to 
contain the odor. 
 
The longer cabbage remains in storage, the stronger the taste when it’s 
cooked. If your family does not like the stronger taste, plan on using up 
cabbage early in the storage season. 
Second, cabbage needs to be stored in a damp area. If you store cabbage in a 
place that’s too dry, the heads dry out, and the dry, wilted leaves are wasted. 
Fortunately, you can take care of this tendency with a simple pan of water.
To prepare cabbage for storage, choose unblemished cabbage that has not 
been picked for long. Remove the tough outer leaves. Wrap each head in 
newspaper and store it where temperatures are just above freezing, 32 to 40 
degrees, and the humidity levels are between 80 to 90 percent. Place a pan of 
water near the cabbage to provide enough moisture during storage. 
Carrots
Carrots are another root vegetable that stores well and tastes sweet and 
crisp throughout the winter months. Just as you do with beets, pick carrots 
as late as possible in the season. Avoid any that have grown too large and 
pithy, however, because these carrots have used up their natural sweetness 
and will taste bitter. 
To prepare carrots for storage, trim off the tops, leaving the carrot itself 
intact. Don’t wash them; simply brush off excess soil if you want to. Place 

324
Part V: Drying and Storing 
carrots with beets in coldest storage of 32 to 40 degrees with high humidity 
of 90 to 95 percent. Carrots do especially well in moist sand. 
Garlic 
You can never have enough garlic, especially since garlic is so easy to 
store. If you’re growing your own garlic, simply pull the bulbs once the tops 
have dried and fallen over. Allow the garlic bulbs to dry thoroughly out of 
direct sunlight until the outside of the bulbs has become dry and papery. 
Purchased garlic bulbs have already been dried. Look for the papery outer 
layer that you always see on a store-bought bulb. 
Dry bulbs on newspaper outside during the warm summer days, but bring 
them in during the cool nights to prevent condensation. Repeat this process 
for a few days, until the garlic is completely dry. 
When the garlic is thoroughly dry, tie bunches of tops together, braid in 
attractive garlic braids. Alternatively, do what I (Amy) do: Trim tops from 
bulbs and place them in women’s stockings, tying a knot between bulbs. You 
can hang this long chain of bulbs on a nail in a cool and slightly damp area. 
I have luck placing my garlic in a cool coat room, instead of an actual root 
cellar. They are in a convenient location for cooking, and let’s face it, they 
make quite a conversation piece! If you do keep them in cold storage, place 
them in 30 to 45 degrees with a humidity level of 60 to 70 percent.
Onions
Most onions keep very well in cold storage. Some varieties, such as the extra 
sweet onions, however, don’t last long. When planting, choose varieties that 
say they work well for storage (you’ll see the term “good keeper”). These 
onions last throughout the storage season. 
Harvest onions the same as garlic. Pull them when the tops turn brown and 
fall over. Once pulled, they must also be cured, like garlic: Place them on 
newspaper to dry during the warm days, bringing them in during the cool 
night hours to avoid condensation buildup. When storing purchased onions, 
you don’t have to worry about this step. They are already dried for you. 
To store, gently place onions in a crate, loose mesh bag, or ladies’ stockings, 
tying a knot between each onion. To prevent mildew on onion skins, air 
circulation is vital, so make sure your cold storage has adequate ventilation 
(see the earlier section “Finding the Perfect Place for Cold Storage”). The 
ideal storage conditions are temperatures of 35 to 40 degrees and humidity of 
60 to 70 percent. If, throughout the season, you find onions with some mildew 

325
 Chapter 20: Root Cellars and Alternative Storage Spaces
on them, simply use those onions first. Generally the mildew is on the outer 
layers, leaving the inside onions fresh. 
Pears
Pears store very well and make a nice change from apples. In years when 
apples are affected by blight or scald and are too expensive, pears can be 
more available. 
Pick pears you plan to store when they’re just ripened. (Don’t choose pears 
that are too ripe, or soft; simply leaning against each other can cause them 
to bruise.) To help protect the fruit, wrap each pear in a sheet of newspaper 
before storing. Keep temperatures cold, 30 to 35 degrees, with high humidity 
(80 to 90 percent). Pears can keep for several months in this manner. 
Potatoes
Potatoes are the easiest of all fruits and vegetables to store. To prepare for 
storage, harvest late in the season. Don’t wash the potatoes; instead remove 
excess soil with your hand or a soft rag. Inspect them carefully for bruising 
or nicks in the skin (fresh potatoes have a more delicate skin than those that 
have been harvested for a few days). If you find any bruising or nicks, keep 
these potatoes out of storage and use them within a few days. 
Store potatoes in complete darkness at 32 to 40 degrees and 80 to 90 percent 
humidity. Every week, check them for damage. At least once a month, turn 
and rearrange them. Finally, don’t let them freeze. A frozen potato is a ruined 
potato; it can’t be saved.
 
The most important rule for storing potatoes is to store them in complete 
darkness. First, the darkness signals dormancy for the potato, and it won’t 
sprout. Second, potatoes subjected to light become bitter over time. Other 
than perfect darkness, potatoes really do well in almost all storage conditions. 
Turnips
Turnips are an underappreciated root crop. They are easy to grow: You 
simply plant them early in the season, weed them a few times, and harvest 
them late in the season, after the nights become freezing cold, sometime in 
November. 
To prepare turnips for storage, don’t wash them. Simply brush off any excess 
soil with your hand or a rag, and trim off the turnip tops. 

326
Part V: Drying and Storing 
Store them in your coldest storage area; just above freezing is ideal 
(temperatures of 30 to 40 degrees). The humidity should be high; between 
90 to 95 percent is optimal. Turnips are another food that stores well in 
damp sand. 
 
Consider turnips a crop that provides two separate foods: the greens and 
the root. So, after you trim the tops to prepare the root for cold storage, 
don’t throw away the greens. You can dry them for use later. To see how to 
keep turnip tops, head to Chapter 10 for instructions for canning greens and 
Chapter 18 for info on drying greens. 
Tomatoes
You may be surprised to see tomatoes, which are both fragile and juicy, in 
this list of good cold-storage vegetables. Tomatoes can, however, be kept for 
a limited period of time in cold storage. 
When you store tomatoes, you store the whole plant, not just the individual 
tomatoes. So at the end of the growing season, select any tomato plants that 
have fruit with the slightest hint of ripening (any color change, from slight 
yellow to orange) and follow these steps:
 
1. Remove any fruits from the plant that are still fully green or too small 
to ever ripen.
 
2. Pull the entire plant out of the ground and hang it upside down in 
temperatures between 55 and 70 degrees, with moderate humidity of 
60 to 70 percent.
 
 An unheated garage or cellar stairwell works great for this. 
The tomatoes will ripen slowly over time, right on the vine. You will be 
amazed at the vine-fresh flavor.

Ten (Or So) Troubleshooting Tips 
for Your Home-Canned Creations
In This Chapter

▶ Explaining less-than-perfect pickles
▶ Comprehending changes in your fruit and vegetables
C
anning and preserving is a science and, like any science, you must be 
precise when working in your lab, which in this case, is your kitchen. 
Although you follow your recipe instructions to the letter, accurately measure 
your ingredients, and properly process your filled jars, you aren’t guaranteed 
a perfect product.
This chapter fills you in on some problems you may encounter in canning 
and what you can do to remedy the situation and avoid these troubles in the 
future.
Jars That Don’t Seal Properly
There may be several reasons your jar didn’t seal after processing: Maybe 
you didn’t follow the manufacturer’s instructions for using the jars and 
two-piece caps; maybe a particle of food was left on the jar rim; maybe a 
piece of food was forced out of the jar during processing; maybe the 
processing timing was calculated incorrectly; or maybe your filled jars 
weren’t covered by 1 to 2 inches of water in your water-bath canner.
Eliminate these problems by reviewing and following the manufacturer’s 
instructions for preparing and using your jars and two-piece caps, cleaning 
the rims after filling your jars, leaving the proper headspace in the jar, timing 
your processing after reaching a boil or the correct pressure, and covering 
your filled jars with 1 to 2 inches of water in your water-bath canner.

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
But what if your jar seals and then comes open? If this happens, check for 
hairline cracks in the jar. If you find a crack in the jar, discard the food (just 
in case there’s a piece of glass in it) and the jar. If your food wasn’t processed 
correctly, microorganisms may be active. They’ll produce a gas in the jar that 
expands and forces the seal to break loose. Because this indicates food 
spoilage, don’t taste the food or use it; dispose of it properly (refer to 
Chapter 9 for instructions).
Jars That Lose Liquid During Processing
Starchy food absorbs liquid — this is normal, and there’s no way to correct 
it. Raw, unheated food also absorbs liquid during processing. Eliminate liquid 
absorption by using the hot-pack method.
Trapped air bubbles released during processing increase the air space in the 
jar while lowering the liquid level. Always release air bubbles before sealing 
and processing your jars (refer to Chapter 3).
Longer-than-suggested processing times cause a loss of liquid in your jars. 
If you’re water-bath canning, prevent this by covering your jars with 1 to 2 
inches of water for processing. If you’re pressure canning, keep the 
pressure constant during processing; then let the pressure drop to 0 and wait 
10 minutes before opening the canner.
Jars with Cloudy Liquid 
Cloudy liquid occurs from using water with lots of minerals, salt containing 
additives, or ground spices. Remedy these problems by using soft water, 
pure salt (like canning and pickling salt), and whole spices.
If you used the right kind of water, salt, and spices and your jar’s liquid is still 
cloudy, you probably have spoiled food. Dispose of it without tasting it.
Dark Spots on Your Jar’s Lid
Occasionally, naturally occurring compounds (like acids and salts) in some 
food cause a brown or black deposit, along with some corrosion, on the 
inside of the lid. This deposit is harmless and doesn’t spoil your food. You 
can go ahead and eat the food, and, because you dispose of the lids anyway, 
the spots won’t matter in the future.

331
 Chapter 21: Ten (Or So) Troubleshooting Tips for Your Home-Canned Creations
Jelly with the Wrong Consistency
Although you can still safely eat a batch of jelly that didn’t set up or is too 
stiff, you obviously want to avoid the same problems in the future. 
If your jelly is soft, runny, or syrupy
 
✓ The proportions of sugar, acid, and juice may not be correct. 
Accurately measure your ingredients. 
 
✓ Work with smaller amounts of juice, no more than 4 to 6 cups at one 
time. Working with larger amounts of juice won’t allow the juice to heat 
fast enough to reach its gel point, which can result in runny jelly.
 
✓ Store your sealed jars in a cool, dark place with a temperature 
between 50 and 70 degrees. Jelly may break down (become runny) in 
less-than-ideal storage conditions.
Stiff jelly, on the other hand, results from using too little sugar or cooking the 
jelly too long before it reaches the gel point. When your recipe doesn’t call 
for adding pectin, your proportion guideline for sugar and juice (for most 
fruit) is 
3⁄4 cup of sugar to 1 cup of fruit juice.
Cloudy Jelly or Jelly with Bubbles
There’s no solution for fixing cloudy jelly, but rest assured, it’s safe to use. 
Poor straining is the most common cause of cloudy jelly. In the future, 
carefully strain your fruit through a damp jelly bag (or cheesecloth). This 
keeps pulp out of the juice. Don’t squeeze the jelly bag; let it drain slowly 
by gravity.
Another likely cause is overcooking. Overcooking fruit breaks down fruit 
pulp, and broken pulp is small enough to pass through your strainer. Be sure 
to cook your fruit just until it’s tender.
And finally, don’t allow your jelly to cool before filling your jars.
 
Although cloudy jelly isn’t anything to worry about, moving bubbles (bubbles 
that actually move through the product) in jelly indicates spoilage. This occurs 
when living microorganisms in the jar break the vacuum seal during storage. 
Discard your food without tasting it. Review the step-by-step instructions for 
preparing your food, readying and filling your jars, and processing your food. 
(Note: It’s not uncommon to see a few small air bubbles lodged in a thick jam 
or butter. It’s the moving bubbles you need to be concerned about.)

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Moldy Jelly
Mold on your jelly indicates an improper or a broken seal. Don’t use or taste 
the jelly — just throw it out (see Chapter 9 for disposing of spoiled food). To 
avoid this problem in the future, always clean your jar rims, allow the proper 
headspace, and process your jars for the correct amount of time.
Jelly with Very Little Fruit Flavor
Jelly with weak flavor results from using fruit that’s not ripe or fruit that’s 
been stored too long after being picked. You can’t add flavor to your jelly, 
but the next time, use tree-ripened fruit; store your sealed jars in a cool, dark, 
dry location; and consume your jelly within one year.
Glasslike Particles in Your Jelly
As long as your jar didn’t break, you can safely use your jelly. What you’re 
seeing isn’t actually glass but undissolved sugar. Slow cooking evaporates 
liquid and allows particles to form in the jelly. Quickly heat the jelly to its gel 
point; then ladle, don’t pour, your jelly from the pot into the jars. Pouring 
transfers any undissolved sugar crystals from the inside edge of the pot into 
your jars.
Hollow, Shriveled, Discolored, 
or Slippery Pickles
Occasionally, pickling cucumbers develop hollow interiors as they grow or 
if they wait too long between harvesting and pickling. You can’t fix hollow 
pickles, but you can identify them because they float when they’re put in 
a sink of water. (Don’t throw out the hollow pickles; use them for making 
relish.)
If your pickles are shriveled, too much salt, sugar, or vinegar was added at 
once to the cucumbers. Start with a weaker solution and gradually add the 
full amount of ingredients called for in your recipe.

333
 Chapter 21: Ten (Or So) Troubleshooting Tips for Your Home-Canned Creations
Discolored pickles may be from using hard water with minerals in it. Use 
soft water for your brine solution as well as for the liquid for filling your jars. 
Reactive metals like brass, iron, copper, aluminum, or zinc in pots and uten-
sils cause darkening as well. Use nonreactive equipment such as enamelware 
with no chips or cracks, glass, stainless steel, or stoneware. Finally, your 
pickles may have absorbed ground spices. Prevent this by using whole spices 
rather than ground ones. These problems don’t indicate spoilage, but your 
pickle flavor may be altered slightly.
 
Mushy or slippery pickles indicate spoilage. Discard the pickles without tasting 
them. Prevent these problems by accurately measuring your salt, using a 
vinegar with 5 percent acidity, and completely covering your pickles with 
liquid during the brining process and in your filled jars.
 
Remove the scum from your brining solution daily, use a modern-day recipe, 
follow your recipe to the letter, and use a heating period long enough to 
destroy any microorganisms.
White Sediment at the Bottom 
of the Pickle Jar
Soft pickles in a jar with white sediment indicate spoilage. Don’t taste these; 
simply discard them. But, if the pickles are firm, they’re safe to eat. The sedi-
ment is a harmless lactic acid or yeast that develops in the jar and settles to 
the bottom.
Food That Floats in the Jar
Fruit weighs less than the syrup you pack it in. If your fruit isn’t packed snuggly, 
it’ll float to the surface. Use ripe, firm fruit, and pack it tightly — but don’t 
crush it. Fill your jars with a light to medium syrup. You can’t sink floating 
fruit, but with practice, you can improve your packing skills.
Raw-packed vegetables shrink during processing. This doesn’t indicate food 
spoilage. Reduce shrinkage by packing your vegetables tightly or blanching 
or precooking them prior to packing them in the jars. Floating food is still fine 
to eat, however.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Food with an Off Color 
Fruit near the top of the jar may darken if it’s not covered with liquid. This 
doesn’t indicate food spoilage. Completely cover your fruit with liquid using 
the correct headspace for the fruit and the liquid. Too much headspace seals 
excess air in the jar. Trapped air bubbles change the liquid level in sealed 
jars when they’re released during processing. Next time, leave the correct 
headspace and release any trapped air bubbles in the jar before sealing it.
If your fruit darkens after removing it from the jar, active enzymes may be to 
blame. You can still eat the fruit because it’s in a sterile environment until 
you open the jar. But to avoid this problem in the future, make sure you 
process your filled jars for the required length of time stated in your recipe 
to inactivate these enzymes. Start counting your processing time when the 
water in your kettle reaches a full, rolling boil, with your jars covered by 1 to 
2 inches of water.
You may notice your apples, pears, or peaches turning color during 
processing. Heat causes chemical changes in fruit that may alter the color 
of the food. Don’t be surprised if these fruits turn pink, blue, red, or purple — 
there’s no way to avoid it. So just sit back, admire the colors, and enjoy your 
food.
Fruits and vegetables turn dark when the natural chemical substances in 
food (such as acids, tannins, or sulfur compounds) react with minerals in the 
water. Food making direct contact with reactive utensils (utensils made from 
brass, copper, iron, aluminum, zinc, or chipped enamelware) experiences a 
color change. Prevent this by using soft water and nonreactive equipment, 
like stainless steel, glass, or enamelware with no chips or cracks.
Heating green vegetables breaks down chlorophyll, the green coloring in plant 
materials. If your green vegetables lose their bright-green color, you can’t do 
anything about it. You have to expose your canned food to heat to produce a 
safe vacuum seal.
Green vegetables can turn brown if they’re overcooked before they’re heated 
again during processing. Accurately monitor your precooking time.
