A VISUAL TOUR OF MUSIC FUNDAMENTALS: A BALANCED
APPROACH
Pedagogical Features
Music Fundamentals: A Balanced Approach, Third Edition offers a number of features to help students in this
introductory course in music theory. 
CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL NOTES
Throughout the text you will ﬁnd shaded boxes indicating a note of cultural or historical information. These
are intended to provide cultural and historical context to the theory, giving a more rounded and engaging
approach for those encountering music learning for the ﬁrst time. 
VOCABULARY NOTES AND IN-TEXT EMBOLDENED TERMS
Boxed vocabulary notes explain common music terms and directions. Terms emboldened in the text indicate
where further explanatory notes can be found at the back of the book. 
IN-TEXT EXERCISES
Exercises illustrate and reinforce topics as students progress through the book.
X
The title of this piece is written in old English. Here, the “rownde” is not a musical “round” as known today (for example, songs
like “Sumer Is Icumen In” or “Are You Sleeping?”). Instead, the rownde is a multi-sectional piece where the ﬁrst section repeats
after the second section is played; that is, the piece “goeth rownde.”
This keyboard piece is part of the earliest known collection of English Renaissance music (1450–1600), and like a few other
pieces in the group is attributed to Hugh Aston a composer known for his progressive keyboard writing
Historical note: English “rownde”
Vocabulary note
PENTATONIC
A pentatonic melody only uses ﬁve different pitches. Many melodies from around the world are pentatonic, including folk melodies
from Japan, China, Korea, Hungary, Indonesia, Greece, and African countries. Many American folk songs, blues melodies, and
spirituals are also pentatonic.
Exercise 10
Name the notes below.
1.
Write the letter names below the staff.
2.
Then cover your answers and say the note names out loud. Work for speed and accuracy.
3.
Starting with the given note, name the two additional ascending notes, skipping every other letter. For
example, beginning on C, the names of the two notes skipping up will be C E G.

PREFACE
A “Balanced Approach”
Welcome to the study of music fundamentals! This book is designed for the semester or quarter-long course in
the college curriculum that concentrates on learning how to read and write music. All introductory music theory
books begin with the study of two basic rudiments: rhythm and pitch. They proceed through the study of the
major and minor scales, intervals, triads and seventh chords, and conclude with the study of musical form and
harmonizing melodies. However, there are many differences in emphasis in the available books, with one veering
toward drill work with very little explanatory text, another toward a reliance on outside sources with few
exercises in the textbook, and another emphasizing keyboard, singing, and ear training drills to help explain
concepts. 
How does Music Fundamentals provide a balanced approach? This book balances textbook with drills,
and provides media tools that are integral to the process. It is balanced as a combination textbook, workbook
and interactive instructional website in order to address the needs of different kinds of learners. Written for the
non-music major wanting to “learn about music,” and the ﬂedging music major, Music Fundamentals serves 
the student with little or no prior knowledge of music, as well as the music student needing review. By rein-
forcing musical concepts with numerous written examples, offering a more balanced mixture of global, classical,
and popular music, and providing a comprehensive, interactive website, Music Fundamentals: A Balanced
Approach, Third Edition is a great ﬁt for today’s more diverse, technology-savvy students. 
I am a teacher “in the trenches.” As a piano and music theory instructor for over 20 years, I have taught
preparatory students, serious music majors at the university level, and retired senior citizens stretching their
intellectual horizons. My current college classes include a diverse ethnic and cultural mix of students. Finding
an engaging textbook for all these students—with the appropriate presentation and manner of delivering
content—has been challenging. My background puts me in a unique position to draw from a global perspective.
I am a Japanese-American, born and raised in Hawaii, schooled in Boston, and teach in a Los Angeles com-
munity college. As in many American colleges, my students come from a variety of backgrounds: they are young
and old, immigrants, working parents, and those intending to transfer to a four-year university. It is not only
possible, but also critical, to connect with students by presenting music in a new and different way, drawing
from as many types of music as possible, and providing ample music examples. I chose to create this textbook
to address the changing needs of my students. Not infrequently I hear beginning theory students exclaim: “Oh,
that’s how it’s supposed to be played (or sung)!” It is for these students that I wrote this book.
Features of Music Fundamentals
Music Fundamentals features a combination of modular text with drills, supplemented by a pull-out keyboard,
an interactive website, and access to audio examples that relate directly to the text. It includes: 
XIII

•
Explanations of musical concepts and deﬁnitions, followed by a variety of exercises which help students
transform knowledge into practice. 
•
An understanding of pitch, scales, intervals, and chords, whereby students also listen and sing to train their
ears. 
•
Keyboard drills, constructed to be played on an electronic keyboard, or a piano, or if neither is available,
on a “true” sized 50-key paper keyboard, provided in the inside cover. References to the keyboard give
students a better visual understanding of what can be the “dry” theoretical basis of music.
•
Numerous clapping and counting exercises so that students not only have a cerebral understanding, but
also a visceral feeling for pulse and rhythm. 
•
Workbook exercises are given at the end of each module to facilitate progress to the next module. The 
review also includes exercises from previous modules, reinforcing the idea that repeated review reinforces
learning. 
•
Vocabulary words are interspersed throughout the text to assist students in the study of music examples.
For example, in Module 1 (Pitch), “pentatonic” is introduced to identify songs that students hear. In Module
2 (Rhythm), students learn about “motives.” Later, various repeat signs and articulation signs are discussed.
New words are integrated into the text to give students a richer understanding of musical concepts. 
•
A good mix of music examples: approximately 45% classical music, 20% American pop, rock and jazz, and
35% global music. They range from Stevie Wonder songs to Beethoven symphonies, from rhythmically
challenging African and syncopated Brazilian choro songs, to humorous Filipino ballads and Schubert
lieder.
Organization
This book is constructed in modules, each with discrete units that allow the instructor ﬂexibility to organize
the course. The modules alternate between pitch and rhythm studies. The book may be taught in a variety of
ways. For example, in a 16-week course, the book could be divided into four sections:
1.
Modules 1–4 
2.
Modules 5–8 
3.
Modules 9–12 
4.
Modules 13–16
In a ten-week course, the book could be divided into units of three to four modules. Module 16 is included to
round out a student’s understanding of how music is “put together” and also may be introduced earlier at the
instructor’s discretion.
An instructor may wish to complete one module in its entirety before going on to the next. I integrate 
the modules so that pitch or scale material is studied in tandem with rhythmic material, or concepts from 
earlier modules are postponed and discussed later, and vice versa. For example, I postpone the introduction 
of the double sharp and double ﬂat (Module 4) until those accidentals are used in minor scales (Module 9) or
augmented and diminished triads (Module 11). Likewise, I introduce perfect and major intervals (Module 10)
and major triads (Module 11) earlier during the second quarter of the course. The modular nature of the book
allows for this ﬂexibility. 
P R E F A C E
XIV

Pedagogy
All sets of exercises begin from the relatively easy to those requiring more thought. For example, beginning
exercises for note reading in Module 1 include alphabet drills; those for counting in Module 2 include drawing
stems. By the end of Module 2, students are composing their own rhythms, as well as singing and clapping
Western music, such as that of J.S. Bach, and global music, such as music from the Philippines. Drills are included
throughout the modules and on the website to ensure that students are given sufﬁcient repetitive practice.
The book provides three other kinds of notes, as shown in the “Visual Tour” section:
1.
Cultural notes discuss musical genres or place musical examples in a cultural context; 
2.
Historical notes place material in a historical context (for example, the development of the natural); 
3.
Vocabulary notes discuss musical signs or terms. These notes provide contextual background and give
students a richer appreciation and understanding of what may otherwise be “dry” information.
Appendices
These can be found in two places. At the end of the textbook, you will ﬁnd an appendix of Musical Terms that
includes additional musical concepts and exercises, as well as appendices on Acoustics, C Clefs, Modes, Other
Seventh Chords, and Basic Guitar Chords. Other appendices—which include Keyboard Exercises and several
musical analyses of short, complete examples of music from the eighteenth to twentieth centuries, and an African
piece that uses 8/8 meter—are placed on the companion website. Questions on scales, intervals, triads, form,
and rhythm are provided. Instructors may choose to use these as discussion topics, or ask students to submit
their answers as homework assignments or quizzes.
Ancillaries
The companion website to Music Fundamentals is a wonderful tool for students. We worked hard to
create a dynamic, interactive site. The web address is:
www.routledge.com/cw/takesue
The Routledge Music Theory Trainer has been redeveloped to be compatible with modern web browsers
and accessible on mobile devices. It includes:
1. Exercises of progressive difﬁculty
2. Customized drills where students work on one or more parameters; for example, students may select
to be quizzed on diminished triads, or on up to all four triad qualities. New exercises include notating
compound intervals, and exercises utilizing the grand staff
3. Rhythm exercises for one or two hands allowing students to listen to a correct playback and have their
tapping graded. Students may select their own tempo
4. Listening drills test scales, rhythms, and triads. Interval exercises begin by quizzing ascending and
descending “steps” and “skips” (corresponding to Module 1); later exercises examine all qualities of
intervals (Modules 10)
5. Keyboard quizzes to reinforce students’ knowledge of the grand staff, accidentals, whole and half steps,
scales, and triads
6. Email submission of scores directly from student to instructor, with the option to print them out
P R E F A C E

7. Audio excerpts of music examples—classical, pop, and global music is streamed to the companion
website. Other audio ﬁles reinforce singing and tapping exercises presented in the book
8. Additional appendices, as noted in the above section describing the appendices. An instructor’s access
code to audio ﬁles and information on the website is available through the sales ofﬁce.
9. The site content is available in the major Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), such as Blackboard
or Moodle, upon request to the sales ofﬁce. 
•
An Instructor’s Manual is available on the website. Sample tests and accompanying answers are now
provided for every module.
New to this Edition
•
New vocabulary exercises and review exercises have been added to every module.

To the Instructor
Music Fundamentals is written as a fresh approach to America’s changing student demographics. Many students
are recent immigrants or the children of immigrant parents, and some are older students returning to school.
Younger students have been raised with laptops, smart phones and MP3 players. Because of the varied
population, students have a wide range of math, reading and writing backgrounds. Fewer have had music
instruction in the lower grades or heard American folk songs or classical music. 
With this diverse student body in mind, this book presents concepts using simple, clear and concise lan-
guage. Using a wide range of music examples, students are challenged to count, clap, sing, and compose. Review
exercises are given at the end of every module. These may be used to measure students’ knowledge, prepare
them to move onto the next module, or assigned as additional exercises to augment those given earlier in the
module. The accompanying audio ﬁles offer audio samples of classical, pop and global music that students may
listen to or sing along with, and this can be done at home or in class. The Routledge Music Theory Trainer on
the companion website is interactive so that students are drilled and immediately corrected. If you wish to track
their progress, they may print out their scores or email them to you. The Instructor’s Manual offers suggestions
for classroom exercises.  
Not all concepts in the book need be covered. For example, one reviewer felt that dominant seventh chords
should be taught at the next theory level, while another wanted more discussion of all seventh chords. One
reviewer felt that singing should not be included at this level; several were pleased that it was. But should one
teach solfège? Numbers? Or sing “La”? I have tried to balance the numerous musical concepts with the demands
placed on the student, and to provide a variety of material to give the instructor more options and greater ﬂexibility.

A word on rhythm: this may be the most difﬁcult component of music for students to grasp, especially for
those who haven’t worked sufﬁciently with simple math functions. I help students with rhythm in three ways. 
1.
When ﬁrst discussing rhythm, students are asked to write the note value above each note, dot, or rest (for
example: “1” for quarter note in 3/4 time). They are instructed to write the consecutive counts below the
notes (such as “1 2 3”). Some students may not need to “show their work” above the music, while others
ﬁnd it helpful to write the note values. I have found that this process is especially helpful to students when
the pulse note changes or when students begin to work with syncopated rhythms. 
2.
When dealing with compound meter, I give two methods of counting (neither of which is “l la le 2 la le”). 
3.
In the instructor’s manual, suggested classroom exercises may incorporate rhythm instruments. One
reviewer stated it was a grade school exercise to use percussion instruments. If you ﬁnd this to be the case,
you may want to use any “found” instrument: tapping with pens or on different parts of the body, clapping,
and foot stamping. In my own classroom, I have noticed that students are intrigued by the sounds created
by percussion instruments, particularly finger cymbals, guiros, drums and maracas, and are especially
attentive when a fellow student conducts the ensemble. (Be prepared for disaster as well, which is also part
of the fun of creating music.)
A note about the choice of music examples: I had hoped to include more music from around the world, but the
rhythms did not always work to illustrate basic “Western” concepts. Additionally, I wished to include more
contemporary jazz, pop/rock and classical selections, but permissions were sometimes denied, or the fees were
outside our budget; the publisher and I had vowed to price the book as low as possible, lower than other major
books on the market. 
To the Student
As Edgard Varèse said, “Music is organized sound.” Music is everywhere: it comes to you blaring out of open
car windows, or piped from loudspeakers in supermarkets and elevators. As you walk around campus you’re
plugged into your devices that are smaller than a deck of cards; as you do your homework you listen to 
music streaming from your laptop. You listen (and perhaps sing along with) your favorite pop singers: you ask
yourself, how did they get started? You may also want to compose your own music but ask yourself: how do I
get started?
Music Fundamentals: A Balanced Approach, Third Edition is written for you. It is a “hands on” book 
that includes music examples from all genres: pop, spirituals, classical, songs from around the world, many of
which may be familiar to you. You will learn to read and perform music and begin to compose your own music.
Every musical concept, whether it’s reading, writing, counting or singing, is followed by exercises that begin
with easy drills and progress to more challenging ones. Additionally, you can go online to the website at
www.routledge.com/cw/takesue and listen to or sing with the tracks that are provided, or complete the
interactive exercises.The book is designed for you to play exercises such as scales or triads on your own keyboard
or on the 50-key pullout paper keyboard. As in learning any new language, the more you involve yourself in
these activities, the better you will master the language of music.
By the end of the book, you will have the tools to read, write, and perform music. With a better understanding
of music theory, I hope you will have a better appreciation and understanding of music when you hear it, perform
it, or compose it yourselves.

The Musical Alphabet
Music is a language consisting of sounds and silences. When learning a new language, one must learn grammar,
pronunciation, vocabulary, and sometimes a different alphabet. Music is written with an alphabet consisting
of the letters A through G. Each letter represents a different sound or pitch. Just as words consist of letters,
musical melodies consist of pitches.
•
When melodies ascend to higher pitches, the alphabet moves forward from A to G.
A B C D E F G
Listen to the track or your instructor playing these pitches for you. Then sing the pitches, using the ﬁrst seven
letters of the alphabet. Notice that the pitches are ascending consecutively; we call this singing “ascending by
steps.”
TRACK 1
1. Ascending pitches by steps: A B C D E F G 
Melodies may ascend, sometimes by steps or larger leaps. Listen, then sing the beginning of the melody “Oh
When the Saints” and notice how the ﬁrst four words (and the pitches) ascend; only the last three pitches move
by step. Also sing the opening of the Hawaiian melody “Aloha Oe;” the pitches of the ﬁrst four syllables also
ascend but only the ﬁrst two pitches move by step.

•
When melodies descend to lower pitches, the musical alphabet moves backward through the ﬁrst seven
letters of the alphabet.
G F E D C B A
Listen to the track or your instructor playing these pitches for you. Then sing the pitches, using the ﬁrst seven
letters of the alphabet backward from G to A. Notice that the pitches are descending consecutively; we call this
singing “descending by steps.” We are comfortable saying our alphabet forward from beginning to end, but we
rarely say it in the opposite direction.  
TRACK 4
4. Descending pitches by steps: G F E D C B A
Listen, then sing the beginning of the melody “Joy to the World.” Notice how the pitch of the ﬁrst eight words
descends, all by steps. In the Mexican folk song “La Bamba,” after the repeated “La’s,” the pitch descends, but
only the ﬁrst two pitches descend by step.  
TRACKS 5–6
5. “Joy to the World”
6. “La Bamba”
Listen, then sing the ﬁrst line of “Deck the Halls with Boughs of Holly.” After ﬁrst descending by steps, the
music ascends. Because music ascends and descends, it is important to know and say the alphabet in both
directions with ease.
TRACK 7
7. “Deck the Halls with Boughs of Holly”
Exercise 1 Class Exercise
Say the musical alphabet backwards as quickly as you can, by memory.
It is useful to be able to skip every other letter. (See the section on the names of lines and spaces on the
staff later in this module, and triads in Module 11.)
To skip every other letter beginning from F, you will skip over the G when going from F to A, skip B when
going from A to C, and skip D when going from C to E.
M O D U L E  1

These letters together, which spell “FACE,” will be useful later in this module.
We can also skip down every other letter.
Exercise 2 Class Exercise
Going up from the given letter, skip every other letter of the alphabet two times. Repeat this exercise several
times so that your answers ﬂow easily and quickly, and are memorized. For example, to skip every other letter
from D, you will say “D F A.”

The Keyboard
Knowledge of the keyboard is very helpful for the study of music theory. It is not necessary to be able to perform
on the keyboard, but access to a keyboard can assist in the study of note names because it has a wide range and
is capable of sounding notes simultaneously. Using a keyboard also helps one to hear and visualize many musical
concepts since all notes and their relationship to each other are exposed. Exercises utilizing the keyboard will
be given throughout this book to assist in your study. (The guitar is also a helpful instrument because it is
capable of producing several notes at the same time.)
•
The keyboard consists of white and black keys.
•
The black keys are grouped alternately by twos and threes.
•
This arrangement of black keys can assist in identifying the white keys.

White Keys
The groups of two black keys make it easy to ﬁnd the note C. The white keys immediately to the left of the
group of two black keys are named C. The white keys to the right of the two blacks are named E; the white keys
in the middle are D. (The names of the black keys will be discussed in Module 4.)
Exercise 3
1.
On the keyboard below, locate and label the keys C D E in relationship to any group of two black keys.
2.
On a keyboard or the paper keyboard provided with this book, play these white keys. When ascending, play
C D E. When descending, play the notes in the opposite direction: E D C.
The groups of three black keys make it easy to ﬁnd F. The white keys immediately to the left of each group of
three black keys are named F. The white keys to the right of each group are named B. The white keys G and A
are in the middle.

• Do the following keyboard exercises. (If you do not have a keyboard, use your paper keyboard.)
1.
Beginning with the lowest note on the left, play up the keyboard (to the right).
•
Point to or play each white note and name it, saying the alphabet forward.
•
If you are playing a full-sized piano, begin at the left end of the keyboard with the letter A.

The Staff
A system for notating pitch developed in the West during the Middle Ages (sixth century CE–1450). The devel-
opment of a precise system of notation enables a person to read and perform music without hearing it ﬁrst.
In modern notation, pitch is written as notes on a staff. Initially (around the ninth century), only one line was
used and higher pitches were placed above this line, and lower pitches were placed below the line. By the
eleventh century, four lines were utilized with one line designated F or C. The staff today (plural: staves) consists
of ﬁve lines and four spaces numbered from the bottom to the top.
The seven letters of the musical alphabet represent pitches in ascending order from lowest to highest. The staff
lines and spaces may represent any letter as determined by the clef, but the letters must always be in their
consecutive order.
Clefs
A clef sign drawn at the beginning of each staff indicates the letter name of each line and space. These clef signs
represent the pitches F and G. An additional clef sign, less frequently used, will be discussed in Appendix 3.
M O D U L E  1
6
The use of notation in Western Classical music contrasts with the absence of precise musical notation in genres like jazz, blues,
and global music, which frequently are not notated. If the music is written down, the notation may specify only the contour of the
melody, previously known by the performer.

The G Clef (Treble Clef) (  )
When the G clef (usually called the treble clef) is placed at the beginning of the staff, the second line from the
bottom of the staff represents the pitch G. All other pitches follow in alphabetical order, ascending (forward)
or descending (backward) from G. The G clef is usually used to indicate higher sounding pitches.
The following is an example of pitches written on the staff as whole notes (   ). Whole notes are discussed
in Module 2.
Exercise 7
Draw G clefs on the staff below. Notice how the G clef circles around the second line, therefore indicating that
the second line represents the pitch G.
The Octave
The octave (octa = eight) spans eight notes, beginning and ending with the same letter name. (See Appendix 2
for a detailed discussion of frequency and pitch, including octaves.)
Ledger Lines
The ﬁve lines and four spaces of one staff can represent only nine letter names. In order to extend the range of
the staff, notes above and below the staff are written using ledger lines.

Ledger Line

•
Ledger lines are short. The ledger line for one note does not connect to the ledger line of another note.
•
The distance between the lines and spaces of ledger lines is the same as those of the staff.
•
Ledger lines are used only when needed. For example, notes written above the staff only use the ledger
lines that pass through or below the note; conversely, notes written below the staff only use ledger lines
that pass through or above the note.
•
The note C written on a ledger line below the treble clef is “middle C.”
Exercise 8 Class Exercise

The title of this piece is written in old English. Here, the “rownde” is not a musical “round” as known today (for example, songs
like “Sumer Is Icumen In” or “Are You Sleeping?”). Instead, the rownde is a multi-sectional piece where the ﬁrst section repeats
after the second section is played; that is, the piece “goeth rownde.”
This keyboard piece is part of the earliest known collection of English Renaissance music (1450–1600), and like a few other
pieces in the group, is attributed to Hugh Aston, a composer known for his progressive keyboard writing.

Relating the Treble Clef to the Keyboard
Each note on the staff corresponds to one key on the keyboard. The G clef at the beginning of the staff determines
which specific keys of the keyboard represent the notes of that staff. In the G clef, the ledger line middle C
corresponds to the fourth highest C on a standard keyboard of 88 keys.
Study the relationship between each note of the treble clef with the note on the keyboard.

Introduction to Singing—Why Sing?
Singing, next to speaking, is the second most important means of verbal communication.
•
Singing is important in all cultures around the world; melodies run the gamut from religious songs to
popular songs, including songs about love, work, nature, and family life. Songs are used to inspire (national
anthems or college school songs) and to teach (how to count). Songs mark celebrations like weddings, rites
of passage like bar and bat mitzvahs, as well as funerals and processions.
•
Singing is an important expressive form of art along with painting, dancing, drama, poetry, and literature.
Singing, with its use of language, gives music a distinctive artistic dimension. Singing, however, may be
expressive, even without the use of words (for example, jazz scat singing).
•
Singing is an important aid in the study of music theory and does not require additional resources for
practice.
Singing exercises will be included throughout this book. It is not important that one’s singing be “beautiful”—
“beauty” is culturally determined. Instead, it is important to listen carefully to match one’s pitch with the pitch
on the track or played by the instructor. Your instructor may use one of several methods for singing: solfège
(the use of syllables), numbers, letter names, or perhaps a repeated syllable like “La.”
Singing in the Treble Clef
Musicians in many countries do not use the alphabet to name pitches; instead, they use syllables, called solfège,
or solfeggio. Guido d’Arezzo, a medieval monk, devised a syllabic system (or possibly codiﬁed it) around the
eleventh century. He used the ﬁrst syllable of each line of a Latin hymn to name consecutive ascending pitches.
Originally only six syllables were used and the seventh (Ti or Si, pronounced “See”) was added later.
•
For these ﬁrst singing exercises we are using the pitch C as the central note, also called the “tonic.” If C is
the tonic then it is called “Do” (originally “Ut” in the Middle Ages), D is named “Re” and so forth.
•
The word “solfège” is a combination of the two syllables, Sol and Fa.

Exercise 1c Listen to three notes and identify ascending or descending steps or skips.
The F Clef (Bass Clef) (   )
The F clef, usually called the bass clef, is used to indicate voices or instruments that sing or play low pitches
including male voices, the cello, and the tuba. When the F clef is placed at the beginning of the staff, the fourth
line from the bottom is named F. All other pitches follow in alphabetical order above or below the F.
Exercise 17
Draw F clefs on the staff below. Notice how the F clef begins on the fourth line. In modern notation, the two
dots are always placed above and below the F line in the third and fourth spaces.
Exercise 18 Class Exercise
Draw an F, or bass clef and the ascending notes on the staff from the ﬁrst line (G) to the middle C ledger line.
Use whole notes (   ). Write the letter names below each note. Repeat the exercise on your own staff paper.

Remember that:
•
The F clef begins on the fourth line and curves around like a backwards C.
•
Two dots are placed in the third and fourth spaces.
•
The F clef gives the fourth line its name: F.
•
The letters of the alphabet will be written ascending beginning with the bottom line: G A B C D E F G
etc.
Exercise 19
Draw a bass clef and the descending notes on the staff from the middle C ledger line down to the ﬁrst line (G).
Use whole notes (   ). Write the letter names below each note.
Note Reading in the F Clef
Study the names of the lines and spaces in the F clef.
Letter names of the lines:
The names of the ﬁve lines of the bass clef can be remembered by the mnemonic: “Good Boys Do Fine Always.”
The ledger line above the staff is middle C.
Letter names of the spaces:
A mnemonic for these space notes is: “All Cows Eat Grass.”

The Grand Staff
The Grand Staff combines both the treble and bass clefs.
Notice that:
•
Middle C names the ledger line just below the treble clef and the ledger line just above the bass clef.
•
In music written for the keyboard, the right hand usually plays middle C when it is written in the treble
clef, and the left hand usually plays middle C when it is written in the bass clef. In “Sonata X” by Georg
Benda, middle C is ﬁrst played by the left hand before being switched to the right hand and so on.

This song is a duet written for two voices (or two groups of voices). As a class, ﬁrst sing the letter names of the
notes in the top lines from beginning to end, followed by those of the lower lines. Then sing the lines together,
with half the group singing the top lines and the other half singing the bottom lines. Sing this again with the
performers switching parts.

Further Study of Ledger Lines
Ledger lines can extend the range of the grand staff higher than the F line of the treble clef, lower than the G
line of the bass clef, and can accommodate notes between the treble and bass clefs. Middle C can be written
both as a ledger line below the treble staff and as a ledger line above the bass staff.
Pitches normally written in the treble clef may also be written in the bass clef using ledger lines. Likewise,
pitches normally written in the bass clef may also be written in the treble clef using ledger lines.

Exercise 1a Find white keys on the staff (both clefs).
Exercise 1b Find white keys on the keyboard (both clefs).
Octave Higher (8va) or Octave Lower (8vb)
The symbols 8va and 8vb are used when too many ledger lines are needed to notate a note and it becomes
difﬁcult to read. The sign 8va (Italian: all’ ottava, or “at the octave”) tells you to play a note or a series of notes
an octave higher than written. The 8va is notated above the note or notes to be played an octave higher and is
followed by a dotted line ending with a downstroke.
When 8vb (Italian: ottava bassa, or “at the octave below”) is notated below the note or notes to be played
an octave lower, it is followed by a dotted line ending with an upstroke. The sign 8va may be used in place of
8vb; it will be placed below the note or notes and will be followed by the dotted line ending with the upstroke.
Your instructor will tell you which sign to use.
The examples below show three notes on the left, which are to be played an octave higher than written.
Their sounding pitches are drawn on the right.
On the keyboard below, the sounding pitches (S) are an octave higher than the written pitches (W).

Pulse: Feeling the Beat
We have been studying music as the organization of sound. In this module, we will add the important dimension
of time, which is the duration of sounds or silences. This organization of sound in time is called rhythm.
Rhythm plays an organizing role in dance, poetry, and theatre—even comedy routines. Our bodies
experience rhythm with our heartbeats, breathing, and locomotion. In music, when you tap your foot to a song,
you are responding to its rhythm, or “feeling the beat.”
Beat is the regularity of a pulse. This can be shown as equidistant lines:
Tempo is the rate of speed of the beat. Many composers use Italian words to indicate the tempo of a piece. For
example, Allegro (happy or cheerful in Italian) is used for a fast tempo, Moderato means medium speed, and
Adagio is used for a slow tempo. If musicians who are performing together do not agree on the same tempo, to
maintain a steady beat, and to accelerate or decelerate at the same time, they will not play together and the
result will be cacophony (from the Greek language meaning “bad sounds”).

Types of Rhythmic Values
Rhythmic values are the duration of pitches. When we study rhythmic values, we are studying their mathe-
matical relationships, which are not affected by the tempo.
Beginning with the whole note, each note divides into two smaller parts.
•
Notice that each note is one-half the value of the note in the line immediately above it. For example, the
half note (  ) is half the value of the whole note (  ):
Likewise, the quarter note (  ) is one half the value of the half note (  ):
•
Notice that each note is one-fourth the value of the note two lines above it. For example, the quarter note 
( ) is one-fourth the value of the whole note ( ):

Exercise 3
1.
Begin drawing notes with the note head, which is elliptical in shape. This is similar to the whole note
which is round rather than elliptical.
2.
Add stems to the following note heads to change whole notes to half notes. Alternate stemming notes on
the right and above the note head, and on the left and below the note head as shown.
3.
Fill in the note heads and add stems to change whole notes to quarter notes, alternating stems up and down.
4.
Fill in the note heads, add stems and ﬂags to change whole notes to eighth notes. Notice that ﬂags are always
drawn to the right of the stem.
5.
Fill in the note heads, add stems and two ﬂags to change whole notes to sixteenth notes. As with eighth
notes shown earlier, ﬂags are always drawn to the right of the stem.
Additional ﬂags may be added to note heads, resulting in thirty-second notes (   ) and sixty-fourth notes (   ) and
others.
The direction of the stem is determined by the placement of the note on the staff, regardless of the clef.
Notes that are drawn through the third line of the staff usually stem down, but they can stem in either direction,
regardless of the clef.
50
M O D U L E  2
q Q
Adjacent eighth notes may be connected with beams (
or         ) instead of using ﬂags for each note. This will be discussed
later in the module.

Notes that are drawn below the third line of the staff stem up on the right. Notes above the third line stem down
on the left of the notes, regardless of the clef.
Exercise 4
Add stems to these note heads to change them to half notes. Write the letter name below each note. The ﬁrst
one is done for you.
Fill in the note heads and add stems to these note heads to change them to quarter notes. Write the letter name
below each note.
Rhythmic Patterns with Beams
Stems with ﬂags can be added only to note heads that are ﬁlled in: single eighth notes are drawn with a stem
and one ﬂag (  ) and single sixteenth notes have a stem and two ﬂags (    ). Several adjacent eighth or sixteenth
notes frequently are linked together with thick, straight lines called beams. Because beams replace ﬂags, eighth
notes have one beam and sixteenth notes are drawn with two beams.

Beams

Beams facilitate note reading and counting by grouping notes into units reﬂecting the beat. In older editions of
vocal music it was common to use individual notes with ﬂags, instead of beams, to match each syllable of the
lyrics with a speciﬁc pitch; this practice is not in use today.
When beaming groups of notes together, the direction of the stems will be determined by the placement on the
staff of the majority of the notes.
If a majority does not exist, one usually stems the notes away from the note that is farthest from the middle line
of the staff.
Exercise 5
In the following exercises, rewrite the single eighth notes by using beams. Group notes by two as needed.

Time Signature, Bar Line, Double Bar Line
The time signature indicates the recurrent grouping of accented and unaccented beats. The time signature is
found at the beginning of a piece of music just after the clef sign (not at the beginning of every staff of music).
Vertical lines called bar lines are placed at the end of each grouping of beats and separate the groups into
measures. A double bar
is placed at the end of a section of music (not at the end of every staff). The end of
a piece is indicated by a ﬁnal double bar       .
The upper number of the time signature indicates the number of beats or counts in each measure. In this module,
the upper number will be 2, 3, or 4.
The lower number of the time signature indicates the type of note that receives one beat (sometimes called
the pulse note), and subsequently determines the number of beats that each note receives. When the lower
number of the time signature is 4, as in the example above, the quarter note is the pulse note and receives one
count. We will be using 4 as the lower number of the time signature in this module. The lower number will
change in subsequent modules.

Meter
Meter refers to the stresses of strong and weak beats. An example of the stressing of accented words may be
heard in the opening line of Edgar Allan Poe’s narrative poem “The Raven”:
/

/
/
/

/
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
In music, the ﬁrst beat of each measure is normally the strongest and is given an accent (>). The repeating pattern
of strong beats followed by weaker beats is called the metric accent.
Simple Meter
When the top number of the time signature is a 2, 3, or 4, this is called simple meter. In simple meter, the pulse
note is divided into two or four equal parts.

Meter: Simple quadruple
In simple quadruple meter, the ﬁrst beat is the strongest and is given an accent; the third beat is slightly stressed
(–). The second and fourth beats are the weakest beats.
The time signature    can also be written as     which stands for “common time.”
For example: “Qing Hai Min Ge” (“Boys and Girls Working Together to Plant Rice”) Chinese folk song

Conducting Patterns
Conducting patterns can help to demonstrate meter. Notice that the strong beat (beat one) is always a downward
motion, also known as the downbeat. The last beat of each pattern is always an upward motion, also known as
the upbeat.

Exercise 9
Identify the meter for the following exercises. Write the number of beats for each note value above the note and
place the counts and accents below. Be sure that:
•
Above the exercise, the total number of beats in each measure should equal the upper number of the time
signature.
•
When counting, all numbers should be consecutive; begin every measure with 1. For example: 1 2 3 4.
•
While clapping the rhythm, count out loud, emphasizing the beat that gets the accent.

Vocabulary note
MOTIVE
A motive is a short musical idea consisting of a melodic contour in a particular rhythmic pattern. A composer uses motives to
give unity to a piece of music through repetition of the motive, and to create variety by varying the motive in pitch and/or rhythm.
(See “Sakura” and “Sliding Around the Block.”)
PHRASE
A phrase is the musical equivalent of a sentence, usually between four and eight measures long. (See “Zum Gali Gali.”)
GLISSANDO
The glissando instructs the performer to “slide,” singing all pitches between the two notes. This technique is used by guitarists
in rock bands to timpani players in symphony orchestras, as well as jazz, blues and Chinese opera singers. (See “Sliding Around
the Block.”)

1.
“Sakura,” Japanese pentatonic folk song
Meter 
The ﬁrst three notes of this piece form a motive; a bracket is placed above these notes. Locate and bracket
repetitions of the motive. Find a different motive; bracket and label each occurrence “Motive 2.”

Tied Notes: Extending Duration
Note values may be extended through the use of a tie:
or      . Ties connect two or more notes of the same
pitch by adding together the note values of each tied note. Ties must be drawn from note head to note head and
must connect each note.
Tied notes are played only once and continue to sustain for the duration of all tied note values. For example:
Ties may be used to hold a note into the next measure. For example:

Here, a whole note in the ﬁrst measure exceeds the number of beats allowed in a 2/4 time signature. In order to
hold the ﬁrst note for four beats, a half note would be tied to another half note.

notes of different pitches. Slurs should be played smoothly and connected. Following are some examples of
ties and slurs:

Vocabulary note
A dotted note should not be confused with the staccato, which is a dot that is placed above or below a note.  Staccato notes are
played in a disconnected or unconnected manner.

Below, “I Believe” is rewritten using ties to replace the dots in mm. 3, 9, and 11. Consecutive counts are written
below those measures.

Anacrusis
Music compositions do not always begin on the ﬁrst beat of the measure. An incomplete measure at the beginning
of a piece is called an anacrusis (from the Greek word, anákrousis, meaning “to strike, push back”). An
incomplete measure at the end of the piece together with the anacrusis measure at the beginning will usually
total the correct number of beats signiﬁed by the top number of the time signature.
The anacrusis is sometimes called a pick-up or upbeat. Do you recall that the conducting pattern for the
ﬁrst beat is always a downbeat, and that the last beat of the measure is always an upward motion? The term
“upbeat” is derived from this upward motion. In “Oh, Susanna,” the ﬁrst two notes form an anacrusis measure:
“Oh, Susanna” (S. Foster)

Rests
Rests are symbols for silence; for every note value there is a corresponding symbol to rest.
Whole rest        Half rest        Quarter rest        Eighth rest        Sixteenth rest
Rests may be dotted, but they may not be tied. For example, a complete measure of silence in 3/4 may be written
as a dotted half rest; it also may be written as a whole rest.

Tracks 48 and 49—The whole rest, unlike the whole note, extends through the entire measure; the number
of counts it receives is dependent on the upper number of the time signature.
In the ﬁrst example below, you will ﬁnd an assymetrical time signature where there are ﬁve beats in
every measure. (For example, the jazz piece “Take Five,” made famous by Dave Brubeck, is in 5/4.)

Born Alberto Aguilera Valadez (1950–), Juan Gabriel is one of the most popular Mexican singer/songwriters. Naming himself “Juan”
in honor of the man who was his ﬁrst music teacher and mentor, and “Gabriel” for his father, a ﬁeld laborer who died tragically,
Gabriel has written and recorded over a thousand songs in a variety of genres: Latin-Mexican pop, mariachi, and ranchera. 
In this song, Gabriel sadly mourns the Mexico that he knew and loved, but is no longer. “There are no women with shawls,
men are no longer farmers, and the pitcher does not go to the well. Industrialism broke it.”

In music of the West, the octave is divided into 12 equal parts called half steps, or semitones. In non-Western
music (for example, as in Middle Eastern music), the octave may be divided into 24 units (quartertones). In
some more modern Western music, it may be divided into even smaller units (microtones), as in the 43-unit
music by American composer Harry Partch.

In Module 1 we discussed the white keys of the piano; in this module we will discuss the black keys. On the
keyboard below, each key is numbered from 1 to 12. Notice that the white keys are separated by black keys
except for E to F (5–6) and B to C (12–1). All adjacent numbered keys are called half steps (HS). Half steps are
paired white to black keys, or black to white keys, like steps 1–2 or 9–10, except for the two adjacent pairs of
white keys (E to F and B to C).

Five symbols called accidentals may be used to name all of the keys. We will begin our study with the ﬁrst
three accidentals shown in the box below; the last two will be discussed beginning on page 119.
Notice that:
•
The black key C sharp (key 2) is a half step higher in pitch than the white key C (key 1).
•
The white key E sharp (key 6) is a half step higher in pitch than the white key E (key 5).
•
The black key A sharp (key 11) is a half step higher in pitch than the white key A (key 10).
•
There are two notes with sharps that are white keys: E sharp (E♯) and B sharp (B♯). Note that B♯corresponds
to C, and E♯corresponds to F. When a note has more than one spelling, this is called an enharmonic spelling.
(See page 110 for further discussion on enharmonic spellings.)
Exercise 1
Using sharps to name the note, write the letter name of the keys in the boxes below. The ﬁrst answer is given.
Sharp 
–
Raises a note a half step
Flat 
–
Lowers a note half a step
Natural –
Cancels a previous accidental
Double sharp   –   Raises a note two half steps
Double flat   –   Lowers a note two half steps
The sharp raises a note a half step; the
letter name of the note remains the same.
On the keyboard, move to the nearest
note to the right.

Exercise 4a Find white/black keys on the staff.
Drawing Accidentals on the Staff
Accidentals are used within the body of a piece of music to raise or lower the pitch of a note.
•
Accidentals drawn on the staff are placed precisely on the same line or in the same space as the note being
modified and directly in front of the note. However, when labeling a note, accidentals follow the letter
name: we draw “sharp F” and say “F sharp.”
•
An accidental lasts for one complete measure or until another accidental cancels it. In both measures below,
the ﬁrst and second E’s are ﬂatted, but the third E is not.
•
Bar lines cancel previous accidentals. In the example below, the sharps must be drawn in mm. 1, 2 and 4
to raise the D to D sharp; in the third measure, the D returns to D natural.
•
An accidental applies only to a note on one line or space; notes an octave higher or lower are not affected
by previous accidentals. For example, the third C is a natural but the last C is sharped.
During the Middle Ages (approximately AD 475 to 1450) a squared shaped “   ” was used to raise the B ﬂat to B natural. Eventually,
the shape for any natural was altered to its modern-day design and now cancels a previous accidental. To draw a natural, combine
an “L” with a “  ”.

•
A “courtesy” accidental may be placed in front of a note as a reminder. For example, in “Call Me
Irresponsible,” the natural in front of the last D is a courtesy accidental, reminding the musician that the
bar line had cancelled the D ﬂat in the previous measure.

Enharmonic Spellings
All notes have at least two letter names called enharmonic spellings. Enharmonic pitches sound the same but
have different names. Enharmonics may be compared to homonyms in English, words that sound the same, but
have different meaning and spelling. For example, the words “ate” and “eight” are homonyms: the two words
are pronounced the same, but have different meaning and spelling.
Two examples of enharmonic pitches are given below.
•
F sharp and G ﬂat are enharmonic names for the same black key.
•
B sharp and C are enharmonic names for the same white key.
•
Later in this module we will discuss all possible “spellings” and their uses.

Diatonic and Chromatic Half Steps
Notes forming a half step may be written in two ways: both notes may be written using the same letter name or
the notes may be written with two consecutive letter names. For example, the half step F to F♯may also be
written F to G♭. If the letter names are different consecutive letters, the half step is called a diatonic half step
(di = two). If the letter names are the same, this is called a chromatic half step (chroma = color).

•
All pitches are a half step apart.
•
When notating an ascending chromatic scale, sharps are usually used to identify black keys. When descend-
ing, ﬂats are usually used.
•
There are 12 different pitches in a chromatic scale; the thirteenth pitch is the octave note.
•
Although this is called a chromatic scale, both chromatic half steps (C–C♯) and diatonic half steps (C♯–D)
are used. Note that diatonic spellings usually are used for the two pairs of white key half steps, E–F and
B–C.

There are ﬁve accidentals: sharp, ﬂat, natural, double sharp, and double ﬂat. Although the sharp, ﬂat, and natural were used 
as early as the Middle Ages, the double sharp and double flat began to be used later in the Baroque period (1600–1750) to
accommodate the harmonic demands created by music using a greater number of sharps and ﬂats.

The étude (French for “study”) is an instrumental composition that addresses one or more technical difﬁculties. Études achieved
heightened popularity in the nineteenth century with compositions such as those by Chopin and Liszt; twentieth-century composers
including György Ligeti and John Cage continued to expand the range of technical demands.
Chopin composed two sets of études for piano that required both technical and musical mastery: Opp. 10 and 25. In the
excerpt below, Chopin begins the ﬁrst measure without a time signature and creates a rhapsodic, improvisatory melody.

Subdividing the Quarter Note
In the musical example below, eighth notes and sixteenth notes are beamed together to form unit beats. Notice
that the counts written below the notes are placed at the beginning of each new beam that connects the notes.
As we discussed in Module 2, a beam is a thick line that connects the stems of two or more notes and substitutes
for individual ﬂags.
“James Bond Theme” (M. Norman)
The “James Bond Theme” has been rewritten below without beams connecting the eighth or sixteen notes. The
counts are written below the same pitches as in the example above. 
Notice in the ﬁrst “James Bond” example how beams have replaced ﬂags to indicate the four main beats in each
measure. When the quarter note is subdivided into smaller units, notes with ﬂags may be connected with beams.

•
When combining note values smaller than a quarter note, each beat is indicated by a new beam.
•
Use beams connecting values smaller than a quarter note to form one beat.
Counting Sixteenth Note Patterns
When reading music, we read rhythms as a combination of long and short notes that form patterns. Similarly
when you are reading this book, words are read as a combination of letters, not individual letters.
When the lower number of the time signature is four (2/4, 3/4, 4/4, or C) the quarter note is the pulse note
(   = 1). The quarter note may be divided into a combination of eighth or sixteenth notes as shown in the following
exercise.
Exercise 1
Use the chart below to count and clap the following patterns. Before you begin clapping, count three beats aloud
to establish the tempo.
Quarter note as pulse note
Practice each pattern separately. Then tap Pattern 1 with your foot. While continuing to tap, clap patterns 1
through 6. Be sure to count aloud.

KUNDIMAN SONGS
Kundiman songs are traditional Filipino serenades in the Tagalog (pronounced “Ta-ga’log”) dialect. Rhythms are gentle and
ﬂowing, and the melody is characterized by big leaps.
This particular song is humorous; the ﬁrst line of the song translates, “They killed a mosquito once in our poor town.”

Exercise 5 Class Exercise
Using the instructions given in Exercise 4, tap the following rhythms.
Notice:
•
The lower voice establishes the regularity of the strong beats on 1 and 3—until the end of the third measure.
•
The upper syncopated voice (indicated with arrows) taps on the weak beats 2 and 4.
•
In the third measure, the regularity of the two voices is affected when a rest occurs in the lower voice on
the ﬁrst half of beat 3. This creates a further push or “drive” to the fourth beat that normally is the weakest
beat of the measure.
Tap another two-hand syncopated rhythm. Be sure to accent beats 2 and 4 by tapping and counting louder on
those beats. Can you feel the “drive” to the fourth beat in the second measure?
Composers of rags, blues, gospel songs, and jazz are known for their use of syncopation. The following are
examples of syncopated rhythms:
•
The second eighth note may be emphasized:

“He’s Got the Whole World,” Gospel song
In the ﬁrst example, ties are used to show the quarter note subdivision into eighth notes.
The second example does not use ties. Although both examples will sound the same and either notation is
correct, using ties as in the example above may make it easier to see the main beat.
Western Classical composers also used syncopated rhythms, although not as extensively as jazz and blues
musicians.
4.
Fugue in D minor, BWV 875 (J.S. Bach)
In the ﬁrst example, ties are not used.
In the second example below, the composer’s original notation of the syncopated quarter note rhythms is
changed to pairs of tied eighth notes. Complete the counts below each example and tap the rhythms; both
examples should sound the same. Which notation is easier for you to read?

Although the notation with ties may make it easier for one to see the main beat, composers usually notate
syncopated rhythms without ties, necessitating the importance of “feeling the beat.” Return to the earlier
examples without ties and clap the rhythms; count the main beats out loud with heightened emphasis.

Changing the Pulse Note in Simple Meter: The Half Note
When the lower number of the time signature is 2 (2/2 or   , 3/2 or 4/2), the half note becomes the pulse note 
(   = 1).
Exercise 7 Class Exercise
Compare the two charts below; the one on the left uses the half note as the pulse note, the one on the right uses
the quarter note as the pulse note. Notice in both charts, two quarter notes equal one half note (           ); the
difference between the charts is the value of the quarter note and all subsequent notes.
Use the chart on the left below to count and clap the six patterns that follow. Before you begin clapping,
count three beats out loud to establish the tempo.

What Is a Major Scale?
The major scale (from scala, Italian for “ladder”) developed from the modal system of the Middle Ages and
Renaissance (see Appendix 4). Along with the minor scale (Module 9), these scales are the foundation for
Western harmony and our study of intervals (Module 10) and chords (Modules 11, 13, 14).
The pattern for the Western major scale can be shown by the white keys from C to C. Notice the arrangement
of whole steps (W) and half steps (H) between each pair of keys.
As early as 500 BCE, understanding about how pitches may be organized developed in Greece and subsequently inﬂuenced the
development of Western scales, perhaps through Roman or Arabic scholars. Greek ideas included:
•
Acoustical theory (the science of sound), which is founded on mathematical principles of physics.
•
Scales formed by joining two four-note groups of notes called tetrachords. (See page 166 for a further discussion on
tetrachords.)
Greek words were used to name the seven medieval modes. The medieval Ionian mode has the same construction as the present-
day major scale, and the Aeolian mode has the same construction as the minor scale.  
Other scales were created in countries around the world, varying the number of notes in the scale and the distance between
adjacent notes of the scale. These include:
•
Indian ragas (from Sanskrit for “color” or “aura’), which are sometimes deﬁned as melodic modes; 
•
The six-note hexatonal or whole tone scale (comprising only whole steps);
•
The ﬁve-note pentatonic scales of Japan, China, and early American blues.

MAJOR SCALE
165

Elements of the major scale:
•
Has eight diatonic notes (adjacent letter names)
•
Spans one octave, beginning and ending with the same letter name
•
Lowest note gives the scale its name
•
Consists of two tetrachords
•
Has adjacent notes which are whole steps except for half steps between 3 and 4 and between 7 and 8.
•
This pattern may begin on any note; when one changes the starting pitch while keeping the same arrange-
ment of whole and half steps, this is called transposition. Each resulting scale will sound similar because
the interval distance between each of the notes remains the same. All major scales except C major will need
at least one accidental.
•
Use sharps or ﬂats exclusively in a major scale
Writing Major Scales: Using Tetrachords
The word “tetrachord” comes from the Greek words tetra (meaning “four”) and chord (from the Greek word
chorde¯ meaning “string”). There are several kinds of tetrachords, but we will study the tetrachord pattern that
is used in the major scale, that of a whole step, whole step, followed by a half step.

Changing the Tonic—Singing
Let’s compare the letter name, scale degree name, and solfège syllable of each note in the D major scale.
When we sing in the key of D, our tonic note is D, which becomes “Do.”
In “Jingle Bells” below, the scale of this piece is D major; therefore the tonic is D, and D becomes “Do,” E
becomes “Re” and so forth. The piece begins on F sharp which is the third degree of the D major scale, or “Mi.”
We call this singing “in D major” or singing “in D”.

Exercise 5 Class Exercise
If your instructor prefers to equate “C” with “Do,” then you will be singing in the “ﬁxed Do” system. If your
instructor moves “Do” to correspond with a scale’s tonic note, you will be singing in the “movable Do” system.
If this is the case, write the letter name, solfège syllable and corresponding scale number for the remainder of
“Jingle Bells.” Then sing with letter names, solfège syllables and/or scale degree numbers.
Then sing “Someone to Watch Over Me” by George Gershwin. Draw the A major scale. Label the solfège
syllable and/or scale degree number below each scale note and in the music below. Sing with syllables or
numbers, then with the lyrics.

Vocabulary note
SOLFÈGE (or solfeggio)
The system of singing with syllables devised by an 11th-century medieval monk, Guido d’Arezzo, who used the ﬁrst syllable of
each line of a Latin hymn to name consecutive ascending pitches. At ﬁrst, only six syllables were used; a seventh was added in
the 17th century. Today, the syllables are as follows: Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti (or Si). 
SOLFÈGE—“FIXED DO”
When “Do” is equated with “C”, “Re” is “D,” and so forth.
SOLFÈGE—“MOVABLE DO”
When “Do” is equated with the tonic (the ﬁrst note of the scale), “Re” is the supertonic, and so forth.

Transposition
Transposition in music occurs when a melody or piece is played or sung higher or lower than the original. We
see this at the beginning of Module 7 on page 193 when “You Are the Sunshine of My Life” is written ﬁrst in
C major and then transposed to E major. The transposed melody will sound “the same” as the original because
the relationship between the pitches is the same. Transposition may be accomplished by using the scale degree
number or solfège symbol of the original scale of the melody.  
Exercise 6 Class Exercise
The piece “Galop” by Jacques Offenbach was originally composed in G major. Below the original version in G
major, transpose the melody to E major.
•
Begin by drawing the G and E major scales.  
•
Write the solfège symbols and/or numbers below each scale note and in the music below.  
•
Then transpose “Galop” from G to E major; be sure to maintain the rhythms of the original. The ﬁrst notes
of the melody in E major are given. Locate the entire descending major scale in both melodies.  
•
Sing the original and transposed melody using solfège or numbers. Does it sound “the same”?

ENHARMONIC SCALES
Scales that sound the same pitches but are notated differently, using different letter names and accidentals. Note: Scales must
be notated with either sharps or ﬂats, never a combination of the two. There are three pairs of enharmonic scales: B and C♭, F♯
and G♭, and C♯and D♭. 
SCALE

Chromatic scale
A scale consisting only of half steps
Major scale
A pattern of eight diatonic notes, including the octave, made of whole and half steps with the half
steps occurring between 3 and 4, and between 7 and 8
Pentatonic scale
A pattern of ﬁve notes within the octave; for example, the ﬁve black keys comprise a pentatonic
scale
Whole tone scale
A six-note scale consisting only of whole steps; also called a hexatonal scale
SCALE DEGREE NAME
Names given to speciﬁc notes of a major scale
Tonic
The ﬁrst note of a scale; also names the key of a piece
Supertonic
The second note of a scale; the preﬁx, “super,” meaning “above” the tonic
Mediant
The third note of a scale, midway between the tonic and dominant
Subdominant
The fourth note of a scale; the preﬁx “sub” meaning “below” the dominant as well as ﬁve notes
below the tonic
Dominant
The ﬁfth note of a scale; the second note of importance after the tonic
Submediant
The sixth note of a scale, also three notes below the tonic
Leading tone
The seventh note of a scale, also a half step below the tonic; the leading tone “leads” up to the
tonic and is sometimes called a tendency tone.
SOLFÈGE
Singing with syllables; “solfège” is a combination of the two syllables, Sol and Fa.
Fixed Do
When “Do” is equated with “C,” “Re” is “D,” and so forth
Movable Do
When “Do” is equated with the tonic note of a scale, “Re” is the supertonic, and so forth

Notes in a scale or chord that “tend” to lead to up or down to another note; for example, the leading tone “leads” up to the tonic.
TETRACHORD
Four diatonic notes consisting of two whole steps followed by a half step (WS WS HS); from the Greek word tetra (“four”) and
chorde¯ (“string”). Two tetrachords connected by a whole step form a major scale.
TRANSPOSE
Changing a piece or section of music from one key to another. All pitches retain the same intervallic relationship throughout.

Exercise 6.1
Beginning with C major, draw the 15 major scales in both clefs using tetrachords. Indicate tetrachords with a
bracket.
Note:
•
A major scale consists of two tetrachords.
•
Each tetrachord pattern consists of: whole step, whole step, half step. The second tetrachord of a scale begins
a diatonic whole step above the last note of the ﬁrst tetrachord.
•
As shown below, the second tetrachord of C major becomes the ﬁrst tetrachord of the following scale, G
major. The same principle applies to each subsequent scale.
•
The three pairs of enharmonic scales are C♯–Db, F♯–G♭and B–C♭.
•
There are at most seven different sharps or seven different ﬂats in a major scale.
•
The number of sharps increases from one sharp in G major up to seven sharps in C♯major.
•
The number of ﬂats decreases from seven ﬂats in C♭major to one ﬂat in F major.

Major Scale Key Signatures
The song below, “You Are the Sunshine of My Life” (Stevie Wonder), may appear to be easy to sing or play
because it is written in C major and does not have any sharps or ﬂats in the music. However, it may be difﬁcult
for many to sing because the composer requires the performer to sing relatively high pitches.
“You Are the Sunshine of My Life” (Stevie Wonder) in C major
A soprano, who has the woman’s highest voice range, could sing this piece as written in C major where C is the
tonic note. An alto, who has a lower voice range, would probably prefer singing the piece starting on a lower
note and perhaps use the E major scale. When E is the tonic note, the highest pitch in the piece is a “B” which
would be more comfortable for the alto to sing.

MAJOR SCALE KEY SIGNATURES

“You Are the Sunshine of My Life” (Stevie Wonder) in E major using accidentals
In the second example, there are many sharps drawn in the music because E major has four sharps in the
scale. In order to avoid having to draw these sharps in front of every F, C, G, and D, a composer uses a key
signature. Notice:
•
The key signature is placed after the clef sign at the beginning of each line of music and lists all of the sharps
or ﬂats that occur in the scale of a piece. The sharps or ﬂats are always placed in a speciﬁc order.
•
The sharps or ﬂats in a key signature apply to all notes, regardless of the octave; in contrast, an accidental
written outside of the key signature applies only to the note in that octave.
•
The sharps and flats in a key signature apply to the entire line of music; accidentals apply only to the
measure in which they are placed.
“You Are the Sunshine of My Life” (Stevie Wonder) in E major using a key signature
The circled notes above are pitches that will be sharped because of the key signature. Compare this version with
the previous example using accidentals.
Composers decide to write in different keys for a variety of reasons: (1) to accommodate the range of the
singer or instrument; (2) the key of a particular instrument may lend itself to certain scales (for example, a
performer on an alto sax in E ﬂat, or a trumpet in B ﬂat may be more accustomed to playing in a key with ﬂats);
(3) a particular key may have a “brighter” sound, another may be “darker”; or (4) because the composer is able
to and wants to use a particular key, as when J.S. Bach composed 48 Preludes and Fugues for the keyboard
because a new tuning system enabled him to do so.

Major Scales with Sharps
In Module 6, scales were drawn with adjoining tetrachords beginning with C major. When the dominant (ﬁfth
note) of C major becomes the tonic note of the G major scale, one sharp is added to the scale and likewise to the
subsequent key signature. An additional sharp is added with each succeeding scale.
On p. 196 is a chart showing the key signatures for C major and the seven scales with sharps. Notice:
•
The order of the sharps in the key signature is always the same (F♯C♯G♯D♯A♯E♯B♯) even if the sharps do
not appear in the same order or octave in the scale. For example:
In E major, the order of the four sharps in the key signature is F♯C♯G♯D♯; in the scale, the order of the notes
with sharps from the lowest to the highest pitches is F♯G♯C♯D♯. The F sharp and G sharp in the key signature
will affect the F and G in the lower octave of the scale because a sharp in the key signature applies to all
octaves of that pitch.

•
The placement of the sharps from left to right on the staff begins with a down-up-down-pattern. However,
the placement of the ﬁfth sharp (A♯) changes direction and does not move up from the previous D sharp.
This is to avoid the use of a ledger line above the treble clef for the A sharp.
Likewise, the last sharp, the B sharp, is not placed above the ledger line in the treble clef. In order to maintain
visual symmetry for the clefs, the placement of sharps in bass clef key signatures will parallel those in the
treble clef.

Finding the Tonic Note in a Major Scale with Sharps
The tonic note of a scale with sharps (also called the key or the key tone) is easy to determine using the key
signature: locate the half step above the last sharp. This note is the tonic, or key. (The tonic may be drawn in
any octave.) Be sure to notice if a sharp in the key signature will affect the pitch of the tonic note.

Major Scales with Flats
Just as there are seven scales with one to seven sharps in their key signatures, there are seven scales with one
to seven ﬂats in their key signatures. When we draw adjoining tetrachords for scales with ﬂats we begin with
C ﬂat major with seven ﬂats.
When the dominant note in C ﬂat major (G ﬂat) becomes the tonic note of G ﬂat major, one ﬂat is subtracted
from the scale and its subsequent key signature. Similarly, one ﬂat is subtracted from each succeeding scale.
The key signatures for C major and the seven scales with ﬂats are given on the following page. Notice:
•
The order of the ﬂats is always the same in the key signature (B♭E♭A♭D♭G♭C♭F♭) even if the ﬂats do not
appear in the same order or octave in the scale. For example:
In D ﬂat major, the order of the ﬂats in the key signature is B♭E♭A♭D♭G♭; in the scale, the order of the ﬂatted
notes from the lowest to the highest pitches is D♭E♭G♭A♭B♭. The D ﬂat and E ﬂat in the key signature will
affect the D and E in the lower octave of the scale because a ﬂat in the key signature applies to all octaves
of that pitch.

Finding the Tonic Note in a Major Scale with Flats
The tonic note of a scales with ﬂats (the key, or the tonic note) is easy to determine using the key signature: the
second-to-the-last ﬂat names the tonic or key. (The tonic note may be drawn in any octave.) In the exceptional
case of the scale with only B ﬂat, it is necessary to memorize that as the key of F major. Be sure to notice if a
ﬂat in the key signature will alter the pitch of the tonic note. For example:

The sign      directs the performer to repeat back to the beginning of the section.
In the preceding piece, there are two repeat signs. Begin with the anacrusis measure and play until the ﬁrst repeat sign in measure
8. Repeat back to the beginning and play to the end of the piece where there is a second repeat sign. Repeat back to the double
bar in measure 8 and play until the end of the piece. (Play A (anacrusis), 1–8 two times, then (A), 9–16 two times.)
Workbook Exercises 7.1–7.3

Circle of Fifths—Major Keys
The Circle of Fifths shows the 15 major scales with their increasing number of sharps or ﬂats. The scales with
sharps begin clockwise to the right of C major and the scales with ﬂats begin counterclockwise to the left of C
major.
When moving clockwise around the circle from C major the number of sharps increases from G major with one
sharp to C♯major with seven sharps. When moving counterclockwise from C major, the number of ﬂats increases
from F major with one ﬂat to C ﬂat with seven ﬂats. Notice that the three pairs of enharmonic scales consist of
five, six, or seven sharps or flats (C♭/B, G♭/F♯, D♭/C♯). Although other tonics around the Circle also have
enharmonic equivalents, major keys do not exist for them—for example, D♯or F♭. 
When moving ﬁve notes up from C (the major scale without any accidentals) to the G major scale, we add
one sharp, F sharp. This is called moving by a “perfect ﬁfth”: 
When we move up a perfect ﬁfth from G to the D major scale, we will add a second sharp for a total of two
sharps (F sharp and C sharp), and so forth. Hence the term “Circle of Fifths.”
Notice (on the next page) that:
•
The sharps move up by ﬁfths: F C G D A E B. Look for these letters on the circle overleaf.
•
The ﬂats move down by ﬁfths: B E A D G C F. This is the reverse order of the sharps.
205
Vocabulary note
CIRCLE OF FIFTHS
The Circle of Fifths was ﬁrst discussed by the German Baroque composer Johann David Heinichen in a theory treatise written
in the early 1700s when it ﬁrst became possible to compose and perform pieces in all 15 major keys.

Exercise 7 Class Exercise
Identify the key (the tonic) of the following key signatures. Use any of the following methods to determine the key:
•
Use the Circle of Fifths: move clockwise to the right from C major for scales with sharps, move coun-
terclockwise to the left from C major for scales with ﬂats.
•
Use the key signature: for a scale with sharps, go up a half step from the last sharp in the key signature to
name the key. For a scale with ﬂats, name the second-to-the-last ﬂat.

“Courtesy” Accidentals
Earlier, we discussed that an accidental placed within a measure applies to the appropriate pitch or pitches
within that measure or until another accidental cancels it. When a sharp or ﬂat in a key signature needs to be
cancelled, an accidental is added just in front of the note to be altered. For example, in the song “Blue Hawaii”
a natural sign appears in the ﬁrst complete measure to cancel the B ﬂat in the key signature.
“Blue Hawaii” (L. Robin, R. Rainger)
The ﬂat shown in the third complete measure is added as a “courtesy” accidental reminding the performer that
the previous natural sign applies only to the B in the ﬁrst measure, and returns to Bb in m. 3 again. Courtesy
accidentals are placed in the music to remind performers of the correct pitches.
Exercise 9

“Call Me Irresponsible” (S. Cahn, J. Van Heusen)
Transposition: Using a Key Signature
In Module 6, we transposed a melody by shifting all pitches the same distance higher or lower using the
corresponding scale number or solfège symbol of the original scale and the transposed scale. We may also
transpose a melody by shifting all pitches the same distance higher or lower and applying the key signature of
the new scale.
Exercise 10 Class Exercise
The melody “What a Wonderful World” was originally composed in F major. It begins on the dominant (ﬁfth
note of the scale) and ends on the tonic (ﬁrst note of the scale). Below the original written in F major, notate the
transposed melody in A major and then B♭major.
•
Begin by drawing the A major and B♭major scales using a key signature.  
•
Circle the tonic and dominant notes of each scale. (The F major scale is done for you.)
•
Transpose “What a Wonderful World” from F major to both A major and B♭major. First, draw the key
signature and time signature after the treble clef. Begin on the dominant pitches of each respective scale;
end on the tonic notes. The ﬁrst three notes in A major are done for you.
•
Sing the original and transposed melodies. Do they sound “the same”?

PHRASE
A phrase is a musical sentence, usually between four and eight measures in length. Frequently, a melody will divide into two
phrases, the ﬁrst ending with the dominant (the antecedent phrase) and the second ending with the tonic (the consequent phrase).
Phrase endings are often signaled by a rest or a longer note value.

Q.

TRACK 70—CLASS EXERCISE
Listen to “A Little Hunting Song” by Schumann or another piece in 6/8. Discuss accents, staccatos, and
the grouping of the three eighth notes in the last two measures of “A Little Hunting Song.” Listen to the
piece again; clap the two main beats along with the music while emphasizing the ﬁrst beat slightly louder
than the second.
Meter is the regular grouping of strong and weak beats or pulses. Earlier, we studied simple meter where the
upper number of the time signature is 2, 3, or 4; the division of the main pulse is into groupings of two or
multiples of two and the lower number of the time signature represents the pulse note. (For example, the lower
number four is used to represent the quarter note.)
In compound meter, the pulse note is a dotted note which divides equally into groups of three or multiples
of three. Therefore the upper number of a compound time signature is divisible by three: 6, 9, 12.
•
6 signiﬁes compound duple.
•
9 signiﬁes compound triple.
•
12 signiﬁes compound quadruple.
In compound meter, the lower number in a time signature cannot represent the pulse note since the pulse note
is a dotted note. Therefore, the lower number represents the subdivision of the dotted note.
Note: Although the number 3 in the time signature 3/4 is a multiple of three, 3/4 is a simple meter because the
main pulse, the quarter note, is divided into groups of two, NOT groups of three. This will be discussed later
in this module.
We will begin our study of compound meters by comparing the most common compound meter time
signatures, 6/8, 9/8, and 12/8, with comparable time signatures in simple meter, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4.
The chart opposite compares simple and compound meters and their corresponding time signatures.
In the left column showing simple meters, the main pulse is a quarter note, which can be divided into groups
of two eighth notes. In the right column showing compound meters, the main pulse is a dotted quarter note,
which can be divided into groups of three eighth notes.
In a 6/8 compound time signature, we may count six eighth notes in one measure. These six eighth notes
are beamed into groups of three; we therefore count (and feel) two groups of three eighth notes (             ), or
two dotted quarter notes (       ).
Consequently, there are two simultaneous rhythms in compound music: one is the main dotted note pulse,
and the other is the division of the dotted note into three equal parts.
222
M O D U L E  8
Vocabulary note
COMPOUND METER
In compound meter, the upper number of the time signature is 6, 9, or 12 (all multiples of three).  To determine the meter of a
compound rhythm, divide the upper number of the time signature by 3. Therefore, when the upper number is a 6, this is
compound duple; when the upper number is a 9 this is compound triple, and when the upper number is 12 this is compound
quadruple.

As a result of these two concurrent rhythmic patterns, there are two ways of counting compound time
signatures.
•
The ﬁrst method of counting utilizes the main beats in each measure.
•
The second method utilizes the divided beat.
Your instructor will determine which method of counting to use for compound meters. Some musicians use
both methods: the ﬁrst method for melodies with larger note values that are played at faster tempos, and the
second method for melodies with smaller note values that are played at slower tempos. Both methods should
emphasize the main beats in each measure—and both should “sound the same.”
First Method of Counting Compound Meter
We can look at the grouping of three eighth notes in the treble clef of Ross Lee Finney’s “Mirrors” to demonstrate
the ﬁrst method of counting compound meter.

Notice:
•

•
The main pulse is the dotted quarter note (          =     = 1).
“Mirrors” (R.L. Finney)
Meter: Compound duple
TRACK 71
Listen to “Mirrors” by Ross Lee Finney. To establish the tempo, two measures will be given before the
piece begins: count “1—2—1—2”. Continue to count out loud as you listen to the piece. Can you feel the
underlying division of the main beats into three smaller units?
In 6/8 there are six eighth notes in a measure, with the grouping of the eighths into two groups of three,
resulting in two dotted quarter notes. Therefore, the meter of 6/8 is compound duple. Likewise, 9/8 is compound
triple meter (9 divided by 3). It consists of three main beats, each a dotted quarter note which can be divided
into three eighth notes. The same applies to compound quadruple meter, with four beats.

Second Method of Counting Compound Meter
In the second method of counting rhythms in compound meter, the lower number of the time signature indicates
the type of note serving as each beat. In a 6/8 time signature where the main beat is an eighth note, there are six
eighth notes. Beginning with the ﬁrst eighth note, every fourth eighth note is accented:
Let’s look again at “Mirrors” by Ross Lee Finney to count using the eighth note beat. Notice that each of the
eighth notes forming the two main beats is given one count, and the ﬁrst and fourth counts are accented.
TRACK 72
Listen to “Mirrors” by Ross Lee Finney. To establish the tempo, two measures will be given before the
piece begins: count “1—2—3—4—5—6.” Continue to count out loud as you listen to the piece. Feel the
two stronger main beats in each measure. Notice that counting “Mirrors” using the second method will
result in a performance identical to that using the ﬁrst method of counting the main beats.
In compound duple meter there are six eighth notes in a measure with the ﬁrst and fourth eighth notes
accented, creating two main beats. In compound triple meter, beats 1, 4, and 7 are accented; in compound
quadruple meter, beats 1, 4, 7, and 10 are accented.
Exercise 2 Class Exercise
Utilizing the eighth note beat, count and clap the rhythms below. Count one measure before beginning to clap.
At ﬁrst, do this at a slow tempo. Then count at a faster tempo.

to represent a dotted rest in order to maintain the grouping of three eighth notes. For example:

Beams
To show the pulse note in compound meter, notes are beamed into groups in the following ways:
•
Beam notes of similar value together to equal one main pulse.
•
Beam different note values together into groups to equal one main pulse.
•
Do not beam notes together from different main beats; only beam notes together that occur in the same main
pulse.
Exercise 3
In the following exercises, write the time signature on the empty staff below and rewrite the melody, changing
the ﬂags of single eighth notes to beams when appropriate. Group eighth notes so that they equal the dotted

Dividing the Dotted Quarter
Use one of the two methods below to count and clap the following patterns in 6/8. Your instructor may prefer
one method over the other—use the method that is assigned.
Exercise 4
Practice each pattern separately. Count out loud, always emphasizing the two main beats.
To the instructor: You may wish to use percussion instruments to give students a more varied aural experience.
Method 1: Count the dotted quarter as the pulse note. (Use the left column.) This method works better for pieces
in faster tempos.
Method 2: Count the eighth note as the pulse note. (Use the right column with the shaded box.) This method of
counting works better for slower tempos and for smaller note values.

Exercise 8a Rhythm tapping in compound meter.
Exercise 8b Compound rhythm tapping with rests
Comparing 6/8 and 3/4
Measures written in 6/8 and 3/4 time signatures have the same number of eighth notes. However, the metric
accents are different.
Exercise 7 Class Exercise
Clap the subdivided eighth notes drawn below, keeping the eighth notes in each time signature at the same
speed—feel the change in the placement of the accents.
Before you begin clapping, count one measure out loud, emphasizing the beats that get the accents.
•
For compound duple count: 1 1 a 2 1 a
OR    1 2 3 4 5 6
•
For simple triple count: 1 1 2 1 3 1
Keep the speed of the eighth notes the same for both the compound and simple meters.

HEMIOLA
A rhythmic device that utilizes two beats in the time of three, or three beats in the time of two; for example, going from 6/8 to
3/4, or 3/4 to 6/8 without changing the time signature. In “Touch the Sky,” although the time signature for the piece is 6/8, the
rhythm for m. 10 is in 3/4. 

Exercise 8 Class Exercise
Clap the main pulses (beats) of each time signature drawn below—feel the change in the placement of the accents.
To establish the tempo, count one measure out loud. Students may take turns counting out loud before
beginning the exercise.
•
For compound duple count: 1 1 a 2 1 a
OR     1 2 3 4 5 6
•
For simple triple count:
1 1 2 1 3 1
Keep the speed of the underlying subdivided eighth notes constant.
Notice that the half note may be used in music written in 3/4 but not in 6/8; to use the half note in 6/8 would
obscure the main pulse. Following are examples showing the correct and incorrect usage of the half note.

The eighth note, like the quarter note, is commonly dotted. For example:
Exercise 12 Class Exercise
Practice each pattern separately. Count out loud, always emphasizing the two main beats.
To the instructor: Assign the method to be used by the class. You may wish to use percussion instruments or
instruments “found” in students’ backpacks.
Method 1: Count the dotted quarter as the pulse note. (Use the ﬁrst line of counting.) This method works better
for pieces in faster tempos.
Method 2: Count the eighth note as the pulse note. (Use the counts in the shaded box.) This method of counting
works better for slower tempos and for smaller note values.

Minor Key Signatures
Looking at the “James Bond Theme,” it might appear that the piece is in the key of C major because there are
no sharps or ﬂats in the key signature.
“James Bond Theme” (M. Norman)
However, the melody centers on A and the downbeat, the strongest beat of every measure, is an A. This piece
is not in C major but in the key of A minor. Every key signature can signify either a major or a minor key. In
this module we will explore pieces written in minor keys and how they compare with those written in major
keys. (Note: The key of a piece written in major may be labelled “C major” or simply “C.” The key of a piece in
minor should always state “minor” as in “A minor.”)
TRACKS 73–78—CLASS EXERCISE
Discuss the “quality” of major versus minor keys: does a piece written in major sound brighter and
happier, and a piece written in minor sound sadder or more mysterious? Can a piece written in a minor
key sound happy—and why or why not?

Relative Major and Minor Key Signatures
Major and minor keys that share the same key signature are called relative keys. Neither C major nor A minor
has any sharps or ﬂats in the key signature; they are relative keys. Because the notes of each scale are the same
but the scales begin with different tonic notes, the half step and whole step arrangement for each scale will not
be the same.
C major
A minor
The distance between the tonic notes of relative minor and major keys is three half steps. For example:
3 – 4
7 – 8
2 – 3
5 – 6

Finding the Tonic Note in a Minor Key with Sharps
To ﬁnd the tonic note (also called the key or key tone) for a minor scale key signature with sharps, count three
half steps below the major tonic note, or name the note a whole step below the last sharp.
Notice:
•
The tonic note may be affected by the key signature. In the ﬁrst example with three sharps, the F is sharped
owing to the F sharp in the key signature. In the second example with four sharps, the C is sharped owing
to the C sharp in the key signature.
•
On the staff, if the major tonic note is written on a line, the minor tonic note is also written on a line (F
sharp minor and A major). Or both major and minor tonic notes may be written on spaces (C sharp minor
and E major). However, the tonic note may be drawn in any octave as shown below.
Below is a chart showing the key signatures for A minor and the seven minor scales with sharps. Notice:
•
The order of the sharps is the same as for the major scales with sharps (F♯C♯G♯D♯A♯E♯B♯).

Parallel Major and Minor Key Signatures
Major and minor keys that share the same tonic notes are called parallel keys. Notice:
•
Parallel keys do not have the same key signature.  For example:
•
Not every major and minor key has a parallel key. For example, D sharp minor does not have a parallel D
sharp major key, and G ﬂat major does not have a parallel G ﬂat minor key.
Circle of Fifths—Minor Keys
The minor Circle of Fifths shows the 15 minor scales with their increasing number of sharps or ﬂats. As in the
major Circle of Fifths, the sharped minor scales begin clockwise around the circle (this time from A minor) and
the ﬂatted scales begin counterclockwise. Moving clockwise from A minor, the number of sharps increases from
E minor with one sharp to A sharp minor with seven sharps. When moving counterclockwise from A minor,
the number of ﬂats increases from D minor with one ﬂat to A ﬂat minor with seven ﬂats. Notice:
•
The sharps in a key signature move by ﬁfths: F♯C♯G♯D♯A♯E♯B♯.
•
The ﬂats in a key signature move by ﬁfths: B♭E♭A♭D♭G♭C♭F♭.
•
The three pairs of enharmonic scales consist of 5, 6, or 7 sharps or ﬂats (A♯/B♭, D♯/E♭, G♯/A♭).
•
Every key on the minor Circle of Fifths has a relative major; however, not every key will have a parallel
major. For example, G♯minor and B major are relative keys. However, G♯minor does not have a parallel G♯
major key.
•
Letter names for minor keys are sometimes written with lower case letters, especially when the word
“minor” is omitted. This style is used here as an example (overleaf).
Exercise 5
Identify the minor key for the following key signatures. Use any of the following methods to determine the key:
•
Use the minor Circle of Fifths: move clockwise to the right from A minor for scales with sharps, move
counterclockwise to the left from A minor for scales with ﬂats.
•
Use the key signature: move three half steps down from the major key (tonics will both be notes on lines
or notes on spaces). 
•
Memorize the key signatures for all 15 minor keys.

Three Forms of Minor Scales
Every minor scale has three forms:
•
Natural (or pure)
•
Harmonic
•
Melodic
Each form has the same tonic note and key signature but its speciﬁc arrangement of whole steps and half steps
is different. Each form begins with the same ﬁve notes ascending from the tonic.
The natural (or pure) form of the minor scale, like the major scale, will utilize the sharps or ﬂats (never
both) of the key signature. The natural minor scale may be drawn using three methods.
Method 1: The arrangement of whole and half steps is W H W W H W W. Notice that the half steps are
between notes 2 and 3, and 5 and 6. For example:
Method 2: Using the minor Circle of Fifths, locate the letter name of the tonic and apply the accidentals of the
key signature, if any, according to the scale’s placement clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle.

Method 3: Memorize the number of sharps or ﬂats, if any, in the minor key signatures. As we saw earlier, A
minor is the only minor scale that has no accidentals.
The harmonic form of the minor has the same key signature as the natural minor. However, in the harmonic
form, the seventh note is raised a half step, which emphasizes harmonic tendencies by creating the leading
tone—hence the name of this form.
In the harmonic form, there are three half steps between 2–3, 5–6, and 7–8.
•
Note that the key signature does not reﬂect the raised G sharp.
•
By raising the seventh note, there will be 11⁄2 steps between notes 6 and 7 from F to G sharp. This is what
makes this form of the minor difﬁcult to sing or play; this also gives the scale its distinctive sound.

The melodic form also has the same key signature as the natural and harmonic forms; unlike the other two forms,
the ascending melodic scale is different from the descending scale. In the harmonic form, the raised seventh
note makes it difﬁcult to sing or perform the larger 11⁄2 steps between the sixth and seventh notes. To facilitate
singing or playing a melody, the melodic form was developed—hence the name of this form. When ascending,
both the sixth and seventh notes are raised a half step, so half steps are now between 2 and 3, and 7 and 8.
Note that the key signature does not reﬂect the raised sixth and seventh notes.
In the descending form of the melodic minor, the sixth and seventh notes that had been raised are now
lowered a half step, which returns the scale to the natural form.

Musical Examples in the Three Forms of Minor Scales
Following are musical examples in the three forms of the E minor scale.
To study pieces in minor scales:
1.
Locate the minor scale on the Circle of Fifths. Is the scale a sharped or a ﬂatted scale? What is its relative major?
2.
Draw the three forms of the scale using either accidentals or a key signature.
3.
Determine the form of the minor scale that is used in the musical example:
•
Are accidentals used in the example?
•
If so, are they the sixth or seventh notes of the scale?
E natural (pure) minor (relative is G major)
“O Come, O Come, Immanuel,” Gregorian chant, eighth century
Only the notes in the E natural minor are used in “O Come, O Come, Immanuel”—the F sharp is shown in the
key signature.
E harmonic minor: Raise the seventh note
266
D sharp
M O D U L E  9
Elements of the MELODIC MINOR
•
Consists of eight diatonic notes.
•
The ascending and descending forms of the melodic minor have different arrangements of whole and half steps.
•
To ascend: from the natural minor scale (using the key signature), raise the sixth and seventh notes a half step keeping the
letter names the same. Arrangement of whole and half steps: W H W W W W H. To descend: lower the sixth and seventh
notes a half step, returning the scale to the natural form. Do not change the key signature when ascending or descending.

Using a key signature just after the clef, draw the three forms of the following minor scales. Indicate half steps.
Notice:
•
When drawing the natural minor scale using a key signature, accidentals do not need to be placed in the
scale. (If you do, you will be adding courtesy accidentals.)
•
When drawing the harmonic minor using a key signature, the raised seventh note must have an accidental.
•
When drawing the melodic minor using a key signature, the sixth and seventh notes ascending and
descending must have accidentals.

Comparing Pieces in Major and Minor Keys
It is important to distinguish whether a piece is written in a major or a minor key because every key signature
has two tonics, one major and one minor. In addition, the minor scale also has three different forms. Therefore:
(1) how do we determine the key; and (2) if the piece is in a minor key, what is the form of minor?
1.
Begin by identifying the relative major and minor keys. Draw the two scales.
2.
Locate the tonic (ﬁrst) and dominant (ﬁfth) notes of each scale.
3.
Identify the ﬁrst and last pitches of the piece. Almost always the last pitch in a melody will be the tonic.
Frequently, the ﬁrst pitch will be tonic or the dominant note of the scale.
4.
Accidentals in the piece may indicate the harmonic or melodic forms of the minor. (Look for sharps, ﬂats,
naturals, double sharps on the sixth or seventh notes of the scale.) (Double ﬂats are not used in minor scales.)

Exercise 7
Using the four steps outlined above, draw the relative major and minor scales for each piece. Circle the tonic
and dominant pitches. Identify the key of the piece; if in minor, determine the form. Finally, notate the counts
for each piece, sing and clap. The four scale options are: major, natural minor, harmonic minor, and melodic
minor.
Example: “Go Down, Moses,” Spiritual
•
Relatives are B♭major and G minor.
•
First pitch of the piece is D and the last pitch is G; these are the tonic and dominant notes in G minor.
•
The altered F sharp is the seventh note in G harmonic minor.

Scale Degree Names in Minor
Each of the seven notes of a minor scale is given a scale degree name. In the harmonic and melodic minor forms,
the scale degree names are the same as for the major scale. For the natural minor, the seventh note is a whole
step below the tonic and therefore is called the subtonic.
Following are the scale degree names for the A natural minor. Notice: only the seventh scale degree is
changed from those in a major scale. (Review Module 6.)
The scale degree names for the harmonic and melodic minors remain unchanged from the major scale.

PENTATONIC SCALES
Pentatonic scales consist of ﬁve notes, either utilizing half steps (“hemitonic”) or without half steps (“anhemitonic”). Those
without half steps are called either major pentatonic scales or minor pentatonic scales. For example:
•
Major pentatonic scale: consists of notes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 of a major scale.
•
Minor pentatonic scale: consists of notes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 of a natural minor scale.

Identifying Intervals
Intervals are the distance between two pitches and are the building blocks of melody and harmony. While
intervals may be expressed as acoustic ratios of frequencies (see Appendix 2), we will study intervals expressed
as the distance between pitches on the staff and the keyboard. Remember to also sing and listen to them. We
have already discussed three intervals in Modules 1 and 4:  the octave, whole step, and half step.  
Intervals may be drawn and performed in two ways:
•
Harmonically, or blocked—notes sounding simultaneously, forming harmony.
•
Melodically, or broken—notes sounding consecutively, forming melody.
An interval consists of two parts: an interval quantity and an interval quality.
•
The interval quantity (expressed as a number) is determined by counting the inclusive adjacent letter names
between two pitches. For example, the interval from C ascending to E is a third.

INTERVALS

Count:
•
Interval quality speciﬁes the exact size of the interval number, which is determined by the number of half
steps between the two pitches. Quality determines the “color” of the interval. There are ﬁve qualities: perfect,
major, minor, augmented, and diminished. Quality will be discussed in more depth later in this module.
We will begin our discussion with interval number or quantity. Following are the ascending intervals from
C, counting the ﬁrst note “C” as “1”. This interval “1” is also called the unison (“one sound”). The interval of
a second (written as “2”) is determined by counting from C (as 1) to D (which is 2). The interval from C to E, as
shown earlier, is called a “third” and written as “3”. All other intervals follow similarly, up to the octave from
C to C which is written as “8.”

one written on a line, or a pitch written on a line and another written on a space.
Let’s relate intervals written on the staff to the keyboard. Count interval numbers beginning with the ﬁrst pitch
(key); count all ascending consecutive letter names up the staff (keyboard). (Notice we are counting adjacent
letter names of the alphabet, not all adjacent white and black keys.)

Consonance and Dissonance
Cultural and historical perspectives help to deﬁne the concepts of consonance and dissonance. What is con-
sidered to be consonant (sounds that are pleasing to the ear) and what is considered to be dissonant (sounds
displeasing to the ear) are usually learned responses, dependent on the sounds to which an individual has been
exposed. There are two intervals, the unison and the octave, that all cultures consider to be a consonance; when
men and women sing together they will most often sing an octave apart.
Principles of acoustics may also assist in deﬁning consonance and dissonance. The simpler ratios of sound
frequencies of notes are usually labeled “consonant” (for example, octave pitches C to the next C vibrate at a
ratio of 2:1). However, more complex ratios are usually labeled “dissonant” (for example, the seventh C to B
vibrates at a ratio of 17:9). For further study, see Appendix 2 on Acoustics.
TRACKS 84–90—CLASS DISCUSSION
Listen to the following selections. Discuss what sounds consonant and dissonant to you—and why.
84. “Ting Song,” Chinese erhu (a two-stringed bowed instrument, popular in China)
85. Water Music, Suite No. 2 in D (G.F. Handel), suite for winds
86. “True Life Blues” (B. Monroe), American blues

88. “Heartsong Aria” (F. Ho, R. Margraff), opera
89. “Sabá Medley,” Arab folk improvisation
90. “Benedicamus Domino,” Gregorian Chant, performed by Schola Cantorum of Amsterdam

Workbook Exercises 10.1 and 10.2

Defining Quality
In music of the West where the octave is divided into twelve equal semitones, the interval numbers of the unison
(1) to the octave (8) may be further deﬁned by ﬁve qualities:
•
Perfect
•
Major
•
Minor
•
Diminished
•
Augmented
The quality of an interval may be determined in two ways: (1) by relating the interval to a major scale; or (2) by
counting the number of half steps between the two pitches forming the interval. Your instructor may have a
preference; use the method that is assigned to determine the interval number and quality.
Intervals of the Major Scale: Perfect and Major
Method 1: Using the major scale to determine perfect and major intervals
Intervals formed from the tonic pitch up to each note of a major scale are either perfect or major.
•
Perfect intervals are 1, 4, 5, 8.
•
Major intervals are 2, 3, 6, 7.
•
Use the diagram to help you visualize this. (Note: the overlapping section of the circles will be discussed
later in this module.)
For example, let’s look at the A major scale with three sharps in its key signature.
The quality for intervals 1, 4, 5, 8 is perfect (abbreviated to “P”). These intervals may also be expressed as a
ratio of sound frequencies of 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, and 2:1, respectively. (See Appendix 2 for a further discussion on
acoustics and sound frequencies.)
296
Perfect
Major
1 4 5 8
2   3   6   7
M O D U L E  1 0

Perfect intervals for the key of A major are shown below, ﬁrst melodically, then harmonically.
The quality for intervals 2, 3, 6, 7 is major (abbreviated to “M”).
Notice:
•
The A major key signature affects the C, F, and G by raising the note half step, resulting in the M3, M6, and
M7 as shown by the arrows above.
•
If the appropriate major key signature is applied to a scale, the resulting interval qualities are either perfect
or major. Always apply the key signature of the lower pitch of an interval.
Exercise 5
Using accidentals, draw each note of a major scale above its tonic note, forming all major and perfect intervals.
In this exercise, do not use a key signature. Write the interval quantity and quality below the notes. If you have
access to a keyboard, play the intervals drawn below. In music of the West, the M2 and M7 are considered to
be dissonant. Do you agree?

Changing Major Intervals: Minor
To change a major (M) interval to minor (m), lower the upper note by a half step without changing the letter
name of the notes. For example:
•
In the ﬁrst example, the M3 is decreased in size by moving the C sharp down a half step to C natural.
•
In the second example, the M6 is decreased in size by moving the F sharp down a half step to F natural.
Method 1: Determining a minor interval using a key signature: 2, 3, 6, 7
•
Determine the interval number: 2, 3, 6, or 7.
•
Use the key signature of the lower pitch to determine the major interval.
•
The minor interval is a half step smaller than the major interval. Do not use the key signature of the minor
scale to determine the minor interval. (To do so would result in an incorrect interval of the minor second.)

Workbook Exercises 10.3–10.5

For example, let’s determine the interval and quality of the following two pitches:
•
Determine the interval number: is the interval an “even” numbered interval (line to space) or “odd”
numbered interval (line to line or space to space)?
•
Determine the major key signature of the lower note: the lower note E has four sharps in its key signature:
F♯C♯G♯D♯.
•
The D sharp belongs to the E major scale, so E to D sharp is a M7. However, our second pitch is a D natural.
Because this is a half step lower, the interval is smaller. The answer is: m7.
Method 2: Determining a minor interval by counting half steps: 2, 3, 6, 7
•
Determine the interval number: 2, 3, 6, 7.

TANGO
The tango originated in Argentina and Uruguay in the late nineteenth century, ﬁrst as a style of music and later as a distinctive
dance. Spanish, African, and Cuban musical styles and rhythms mixed together. Eventually, the dance was characterized by a
sudden stop followed by various gestures, and also by gyrations of the hips.

Changing Perfect Intervals: Augmented, Diminished
A perfect interval may be either increased in size by a half step to form an augmented interval (written “Aug”

Note: Diminished and augmented intervals may be respelled enharmonically: the interval number and
quality will change. For example, A to C   . is an Aug 3. Respelled as A to D, the interval is a P4. If you count
half steps to determine the interval quality, it is especially important to ﬁrst determine the interval number.

The Tritone
Tritone (or “three tones”) is the term used to describe both the augmented fourth (A4) and the diminished ﬁfth
(d5). The tritone, because of its dissonance, will be discussed in Module 15 along with the dominant seventh
chord. The tritone consists of three whole steps, hence the term “tritone.” For example:
Sing the opening notes to “Maria” from West Side Story, or the beginning of “The Simpsons.” Both songs begin
with the tritone. Notice also how the tritone resolves up in both songs.

Exercise 10a Identify intervals by ear: All qualities.
Simple and Compound Intervals
We have been studying simple intervals, or those that are an octave or smaller. Compound intervals are larger
than an octave. For example:
313
I N T E R V A L S
Aug 4
6 half steps
dim 5
6 half steps
A
D♯
6 half steps = 3 whole steps
E♭
The tritone is considered to be one of the most dissonant intervals. Before 1600 it was originally termed the “devil in music”
(Diabolus in musica) and was forbidden to be used melodically.

Workbook Exercises 10.8–10.11

To identify the quality of a compound interval, bring the upper note down an octave while retaining the lower
note. Doing so does not change the quality of the interval.
Notice:
•
The compound interval and its corresponding simple interval share the same quality.
•
Although we are moving the upper note down an octave (eight notes) we will subtract seven from the
compound interval to get the comparable simple interval.
•
You may also move the lower note up an octave while retaining the upper note.
Exercise 21
Draw the simple interval by moving the upper note of the compound interval down an octave (or moving the
lower note up an octave). Identify the compound interval and its comparable simple interval.
Example: In the ﬁrst answer, the upper G is moved down an octave; in the second answer, the lower E is
moved up an octave. Notice that the resulting notes in both answers are the same (E to G); they are only written
in different octaves. Example:

Descending Intervals (Interval Inversion)
We have been drawing simple intervals above notes. To draw a simple interval below a given note, begin by
inverting the interval to be drawn (one of the notes will move up or down an octave; the other note remains
unchanged).
Notice:
•
The inverted interval consists of the same pitches in a different octave.
•
When intervals invert, the two interval numbers will total nine.
Note: use either of the following diagrams to visualize this concept.
•
Qualities of inverted intervals will change in this manner:
For example:

M2      m7               m3       M6                  P4        P5               d5        A4

Defining and Drawing Triads
In the first 10 modules we discussed two basic musical elements: melody (pitch and intervals) and rhythm
(simple and compound meter). In this module we will discuss a third musical component, harmony, which is
the deﬁning element in Western music. Let’s listen to “Love Me Tender” while reading the music given on the

HARMONY
From the Greek word “harmonia” or “agreement.” Harmony is the relationship between consecutive groupings of simultaneous
(vertical) sounding pitches. In Western music beginning around 1600, the vertical sounding of notes a third apart (called “tertian”
harmony) became the foundation of chords.
CHORD
Three or more notes that sound simultaneously. (When only two notes sound, they form an “interval.”)
•
Blocked chord: Three or more different pitches sounding simultaneously (harmonically); notes may be drawn in one or more
clefs.
•
Broken chord:  Notes of a chord played successively (melodically).
•
Implied chord: An incomplete chord where the third or the ﬁfth of the chord is missing; the chord may be blocked or broken.
TRIAD
In its simplest form, a triad has three notes, each a third apart.

Listen to “Love Me Tender.” 
Discuss the different way chords are written and performed in this song: blocked, broken and implied.
“Love Me Tender” (E. Presley and V. Matson)
Notice that the bass clef notes below the melody provide the harmony, which may be “blocked” chords as in
the ﬁrst three measures, “broken” chords as in mm. 5 and 6, or “implied” chords as in mm. 7 and 8.
TRACKS 92–94
Listen to three musical examples which represent the following: a melody accompanied by a variation
of the same melody, a melody accompanied by a harmony, or a melody alone.

94. Vai Call to Prayer, Liberian music
“Broken” chords
“Implied” chords
“Blocked” chords

Exercise 1 Class Exercise
Listen to your instructor play each of the chords written below. Discuss whether or not the chords sound
consonant or dissonant.
In this module, the chord we will be discussing is the triad. In the Module 1 exercises, we practiced skipping
every other letter of the alphabet. A triad is formed when we combine three pitches, each a third apart (“skips”).
These three notes (A C E) form the “A” triad. Notice:
•
On the staff, triads may be written in either staff and in any octave; the three notes of the triad will be written
all on lines or all on spaces.
•
The lowest note gives the triad its name. This note (the ﬁrst) is also called the “root.” The middle note is
the “third” and the top note is the “ﬁfth.”
•
A triad may be written harmonically (all of the notes sound simultaneously) or melodically (notes are played
in succession, as in a melody).

Qualities of Diatonic Triads
Triads may be classiﬁed by quality, which is determined by measuring the interval size of each of the thirds of
the triad. There are four qualities of triads: major, minor, diminished, and augmented. We will begin our study
with the major triad.
Major Triad
A major triad consists of the ﬁrst, third, and ﬁfth pitches of a major scale. For example:

Constructing Major Triads
There are three methods for constructing a major triad. Your instructor will tell you which method(s) to use.
Method 1: Use the intervals of a major triad
•
A triad may be deﬁned as a combination of intervals. A major triad consists of notes a major third (M3) and
a perfect ﬁfth (P5) above the root. A minor third (m3) occurs between the upper two notes.
Method 2: Use tetrachords
•
Determine the accidentals used in a major scale by joining tetrachords (see Module 6).
•
The ﬁrst, third, and ﬁfth notes of the scale form a major triad.
Method 3: Use the major key signature
•
Determine the key signature of a major scale by using the Circle of Fifths (see Module 7). E major has four
sharps: F♯, C♯, G♯, and D♯.
•
G becomes G sharp because of the E major key signature.

Harmonizing Music Using Major Triads
Triad letter names (called “chord symbols”) may be written above a melody line; the letter names are the root
of the triads used to accompany the melody.
Listen to your instructor or another class member play “Ye Banks and Braes O’Bonnie Doon.” Listen ﬁrst
to the treble clef melody and then the bass clef triads, and ﬁnally both parts together. Notice that:
•
Triads may be written in any octave; here, the treble clef range may determine the octave placement of the
triads below.

CHORD SYMBOL
Letter name of the root of a chord frequently placed above a melody line, used to accompany the melody.
HARMONIZATION
The use of chords (harmony) to accompany a melody.
NON-HARMONIC TONE
A note that is not a member of a chord; for example, “D,” which does not belong to a C major triad (C E G), is a non-harmonic
tone of CM. 

•
All triads are placed directly below the melodic note that is sounded or played with the triad; all measures
have the correct number of counts.
•
When the letter name does not change across a bar line as in m. 4, the triad remains the same.
•
Some melodic notes do not belong to the given triad; these notes are called “non-harmonic” tones. The ﬁrst
two non-harmonic tones are circled.

from the eighteenth century

No chord change
“Ye Banks and Braes O’Bonnie Doon” (“The Banks and Hillsides of the Pretty River Doon”) is one of the most popular
Scottish folk songs. It sets to music the poem written by Robert Burns, the famous Scottish poet. According to popular lore,
the poem tells the story of Miss Kennedy who was spurned by her lover and thus her heart was broken. “Ye Banks and braes
o' bonnie Doon, how can ye bloom sae fresh and fair? . . . Wi’ lightsome heart I stretch’d my hand, and pu’d a rosebud from
the tree. But my fause lover stole the rose, and left the thorn wi’me.”
Notice the “Scotch snap” rhythm in m. 3:

cultural background. Listen to the four pairs of triads drawn below; the ﬁrst one is major and the second one is
minor. Listen for their different quality.

To construct a minor triad, lower the third (the middle) note of a major triad a half step, keeping the original
letter names. For example:
Method 3: Use the minor key signature
•
Determine the key signature of a minor scale by using the minor Circle of Fifths (see Module 9). E minor
has one sharp: F♯.
•
Although there is an F♯in the key signature, it does not affect the triad (E G B).

Diminished Triad
The diminished triad consists of two ascending consecutive minor thirds from the root. This creates a diminished
ﬁfth between the root and the ﬁfth, hence the name “diminished” which means to “make smaller.”
When labeling the quality of a diminished triad, frequently the “degree” sign ° is used. It is preferable either to
label a diminished triad using the “°” or to write “dim” to avoid any confusion with the letter “D.”
T R I A D S
In this traditional Japanese song, “To¯ryanse” (“Let Me Pass”), pilgrims ask permission to pass through the narrow gate to the
castle housing the Tenjin Shrine. Long ago, children’s third, ﬁfth, and seventh birthdays were celebrated. “Please allow me to
pass through . . . to celebrate this child’s seventh birthday. I’ve come to dedicate my offering . . .” Today, this song is heard at
many street crossings to tell blind people when to cross.

Constructing Diminished Triads
There are two methods for constructing a diminished triad.
Method 1: Use the intervals of a diminished triad
•
A diminished triad consists of a minor third (m3) and a diminished ﬁfth (d5) above the root. A minor third
(m3) occurs between the upper two notes.
Method 2: Change a major triad to a diminished triad
•
To construct a diminished triad, lower the third (the middle) and the ﬁfth (the top) notes of a major triad
each a half step without changing the letter names. For example:

Augmented Triad
The augmented triad consists of two ascending consecutive major thirds from the root. This creates an aug-
mented ﬁfth between the root and the ﬁfth, hence the name “augmented” which means “made bigger.”
When labeling the quality of an augmented triad, frequently the “plus” sign + is used. It is preferable to either
label an augmented triad using the “+” or to write “Aug” to avoid any confusion with the letter “A”.

Musical note: Liebestra¨ ume
Franz Liszt composed a set of three solo piano pieces collectively called “Liebesträume” (“Dreams of Love”) which were
published in 1850. Originally, the pieces were written for soprano and piano and later transcribed for both piano duet and solo
piano. Liebesträume No. 3, which is the most popular of the solo piano collection, looks at mature love that mourns death: “Love
as long as you can. The hour will come when you will stand at graves and mourn.” Note that the tempo marking, “con affetto”
translates to “with tenderness.”

TOMBEAU
Le Tombeau de Couperin (tombeau is French for “tomb”) is a suite of six pieces written by Maurice Ravel between 1914 and
1917, each piece commemorating a friend who had died in World War I. (Ravel served during the war as a driver.) Rather than
paying homage to the famous seventeenth-century French composer Francois Couperin, Ravel was honoring the Baroque
keyboard suite which is a collection of dances. This Tombeau opens with a Prelude dedicated to Lieutenant Jacques Charlot who
had transcribed one of Ravel’s duets for solo piano.

The Triplet
In simple meter, the beat may be divided into three equal parts by use of the triplet. Note that:
•
The triplet divides the beat into three equal parts where you normally have two equal parts.
•
Triplets are commonly identiﬁed by a “3” placed above or below the group of notes, sometimes with the
addition of a bracket.
•
In a series of triplets, only the ﬁrst groups may have the “3” and the bracket.

Any note value may be divided into triplets; the most common is the eighth note triplet. For all triplets, the
combined value of the triplets is equal to the next larger note value.
•
Triplets are used for short segments of music when the normal division into groups of two is changed
momentarily to three. For an extended section using a division into groups of three, the music is usually
written in compound meter.

Triads of the Major Scale: Use of Roman Numerals
Each note of a major scale may be used as the root of a triad. There are three ways of labeling these triads. In
Module 11, we used chord symbols to discuss the four qualities of triads: the letter name of the root and the
triad quality. For example, EM tells us that the root is E and the triad is major. There are two other ways of
labeling triads: roman numerals and scale degree names. Because many musicians use any of these three ways
to label and discuss triads, it is important to know these methods of labeling.

Exercise 1 Class Exercise
Listen to your instructor play the triads formed from each note in the C major scale. Since the scale does not
have any sharps or ﬂats, the triads also do not have any accidentals.
Notice:
•
The key of the scale is identiﬁed at the beginning just below the clef sign.
•
The quality of the triad (major, minor, or diminished) is indicated by the use of upper case or lower case
roman numerals (or °).
Major triads are indicated by upper case roman numerals. In a major scale there are three major triads.
Minor triads are indicated by lower case roman numerals. In a major scale there are three minor triads.
Diminished triads are indicated by lower case roman numerals accompanied by the “degree” sign. In a major
scale there is one diminished triad.
•
The roman numerals, triad qualities, and scale degree names are the same for every major scale. Only the
triad letter names (A, B, C) change with each key.

Calypso is a type of music that arose in the early 1900s in Trinidad and Tobago (islands in the West Indies about seven miles
northeast of Venezuela.) Its roots (called “Creole”) were African mixed with Spanish, French, and English musical traditions. Its
lyrics, sometimes satirical, were originally useful as a means to discuss politics and news of the day. (In “Matilda, Matilda” the
lyrics bemoan a jilted man’s loss of his girlfriend. Not only does she take his money, she takes his horse and cart and runs away
to Venezuela!)
Calypso rhythms are noted for their syncopations.

Triads of the Harmonic Minor Scale: Use of Roman Numerals
As with the major scale, each note of the harmonic minor scale may be used as the root of a triad. Triads may
be formed from each note of the natural and melodic minor scales as well, but the harmonic form is most useful
when discussing the harmonies used in pieces written in minor keys (hence the designation “harmonic” minor).
The quality of the triads formed on each note of the harmonic minor scale are the same for every minor key.
In addition to the sharps or ﬂats (if any) in the key signature, the seventh note is always raised a half step. The
seventh note is found in three triads: the mediant, dominant, and leading tone.
Exercise 6
Play and listen to the triads formed from each note in the A minor scale, harmonic form. Although A minor
does not have any sharps or flats in its key signature, the seventh note (G♯) will be raised in the mediant,
dominant, and leading tone triads.
Notice:
•
The key of the scale is identiﬁed at the beginning.
•
The quality of the triad (major, minor, augmented, or diminished) is indicated by the use of upper case or
lower case roman numerals; there are two major, two minor, two diminished, and one augmented triad in
the harmonic minor scale.

Exercise 7 Class Exercise
1.
Using accidentals, draw the triads of the E harmonic minor scale. Below each triad, label the roman numeral

the seventh note of the scale.
2.
After the clef, draw the key signature and triads for the D harmonic minor scale. Below each triad, label
the roman numerals and chord symbols. When using a key signature, the only accidental that is needed is
the raised seventh; three triads will be affected (III+, V, and vii°).

Major triads are V and VI.

The augmented triad (III+) is indicated by an upper case roman numeral followed by a + sign. Composers of the Common Practice
period (approximately the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries) did not use the augmented form of the mediant triad except in
passing. Even today, the mediant is usually a major triad which is formed from the natural minor form of the scale.

Triads of a minor scale can be divided into primary and secondary triads. Just as in the major scale, the primary
triads are the tonic, subdominant, and dominant. The secondary triads are the supertonic, mediant, submediant,
and leading tone.

Defining Inversions: Root Position, First Inversion, and 
Second Inversion
We have been discussing triads in their simplest form: three notes that form consecutive thirds.
Triads may also be written as inversions (“invert” means “turn upside down”). There are three positions: root,
first inversion, and second inversion. In all positions, the notes and therefore the quality (major, minor,
augmented, diminished) remain the same; only the sequence of the notes from bottom to top changes. Composers
use inversions to vary the harmonic sound and to create a smoother linear motion of the notes from chord to
chord (called “voice leading.”)
•
In root position, the root is the lowest, or bass note.

Triads in Open and Close Position
Triads may be written in two different positions: close or open.
•
Close position occurs when the distance between the lowest and highest notes in a triad is less than an octave.
•
Open position occurs when the notes exceed an octave in range. The triads in close position shown above
are rewritten below in open position.
As we have seen with inversions, composers use triads in open and close position to vary the sound and to
assist with smooth voice leading. Notes of a triad may also be duplicated, and non-triad notes (“non-chord” or
“non-harmonic” tones) may be added to expand the “color” of a harmony.

Figured Bass Symbols
Figured bass symbols are interval numbers written below the bass staff to indicate triad quality and inversion,
and were ﬁrst used in published music starting around 1600. Musicians continue to use them today.
The following is an example of the use of ﬁgured bass symbols from Corelli’s “Trio Sonata.” Notice the
numbers and naturals written below the bass clef of the “organo” (keyboard) part. Using these symbols, the
performer would improvise the right hand above.

Constructing and Identifying Triads Using Figured Bass Symbols
Figured bass symbols are numbers (“ﬁgures”) that represent the intervals created above a bass (or “bottom”)
note. Here, the root of the triad is G.
402
A triad in root position consists of a ﬁfth and a third above the lowest note.
A triad in ﬁrst inversion consists of a sixth and a third above the lowest note.
A triad in second inversion consists of a sixth and a fourth above the lowest
note.

A harpsichordist (most popular keyboard instrument during seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) used these ﬁgured bass symbols
to improvise above a given bass line (called “realizing” a figured bass). This is similar to a jazz performer today using chord
symbols/progressions to improvise.
Historical Note: Figured bass

These symbols may be reduced even further as follows. Here, the root of the triad is F.
•
In root position, the ﬁgured bass is left blank; the ﬁfth and the third above the bass are assumed.
•
In ﬁrst inversion, only the number “6” is given to represent “6/3”; the third above the bass is assumed.
•
In second inversion, both numbers are written (“6/4”) in order to differentiate this inversion from the ﬁrst
inversion.
Exercise 10 Class Exercise
Complete the triad above the given note using the ﬁgured bass symbols written below the staff. Identify the
letter name and quality of the triad. For this exercise do not add accidentals.
Note: a “6” written below the staff should not be confused with the jazz label “6” where the interval of the
sixth is added to a root position triad.

Harmonizing Music Using Roman Numerals and Figured 
Bass Symbols
In the previous section, we harmonized pieces using chord symbols (letter name and quality) written above the
melody. We may also use roman numerals and ﬁgured bass symbols to harmonize a melody and to analyze the
harmonies used by a composer.
Let’s look at the ﬁrst measures of J.S. Bach’s “Prelude in F Major.” We may analyze the harmonies that Bach
uses in this Prelude and assign roman numerals and ﬁgured bass symbols to them.
•
Broken triads use the same ﬁgured bass rules as blocked triads.
•
Blocked triads have been written in the bass clef below the Bach piece to represent the broken triads.
Prelude in F Major, BWV 927 (J.S. Bach)
•
We begin by assigning roman numerals to each triad of the F major scale, as shown below. Circle the letter
name of the triads that are used in Bach’s Prelude in F.

The position of a triad is determined by the lowest note: in root position, the root is the lowest note; in ﬁrst
inversion the third is the lowest note; in second inversion the ﬁfth is the lowest note. Assign the ﬁgured
bass accordingly. For example, locate the triad marked “B♭2nd” in the Bach piece above and find its
corresponding roman numeral and ﬁgured bass symbols below.
•
Draw the inversions for the E˚ triad. Label each triad with roman numeral and ﬁgured bass symbols. Locate

Drawing Chord Progressions in Close Position
A chord progression is a series of chords (or triads). Music of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, jazz,
and many popular songs use chord progressions as their harmonic basis. To see how the 12-bar blues progression
uses a series of triads in a set order, refer to p. 453 in Module 16. Another chord progression that also uses
primary triads is I IV V I. For example:
Below, the same chord progression is written using inversions. Notice how inversions allow the triads to progress
more smoothly, without leaping from triad to triad.

The mambo (or “conversation with the gods” in Yoruba, the language of the Cuban slaves from Africa) is a Cuban style of music
and dance form. The Cuban band director and composer Dámasco Pérez Prado created the mambo dance steps in 1943, resulting
in the mambo craze that swept New York City in the 1950s. The music was rhythmic with syncopations and full of energy.

421
In Modules 11 and 13 we studied three-note chords called triads and used them to harmonize melodies, a
deﬁning feature of Western music called “tertian harmony,” or harmonies built on the interval of the third. In
addition to triads, composers have harmonized melodies using “tertian” chords made of four notes, and even
ﬁve or more notes.
The four-note chord is called the seventh chord, named for the interval of the seventh created between the
lowest and highest notes of the chord. Subsequent chords with more notes are named from the interval number
between their root and highest notes.
S E V E N T H  C H O R D S
Originally, composers used sevenths as added notes to a melody and its harmony—they were non-chord tones that created
dissonances (intervals that required a resolution). By the eighteenth century, sevenths became an accepted part of a composer’s
harmonic vocabulary; eventually, they were used extensively by some composers (such as Claude Debussy) and in jazz and some
popular music.

SEVENTH CHORDS

Exercise 1 Class Exercise
TRACK 100
Listening: “That’s All” harmonized with seventh chords.
“That’s All” (A. Brandt and B. Haymes)
Notice how “That’s All” is harmonized with just one triad (C major) and many seventh chords. Listen to Track
100 or to your instructor perform the excerpt and pay attention to the sound of the chords created by the addition
of a fourth note above the triads.  
TRACK 101
Listening: “That’s All” harmonized with triads.  
Listen to Track 101 where only triads are used to harmonize the piece. Discuss the differences between the two
performances: does one sound more “colorful?” More dissonant? More “interesting?”  
Qualities of Seventh Chords
There are ﬁve qualities of seventh chords that can be created by drawing three notes above the pitches of a major
scale or the three forms of a minor scale.  
422
M O D U L E  1 5

Note:
•
In root position, the seventh chord consists of four notes, all consecutive thirds apart.
•
The interval of the seventh is created between the root and the highest note.
•
The quality of the seventh chord is determined by the quality of the triad (the lowest three notes) and the
quality of the seventh (from the root to the highest note).
Following are the seventh chords for C as the root:
C major7
C dominant7
C minor7
C half diminished7
C diminished7
M triad + M7 
M triad + m7
m triad + m7
dim triad + m7
dim triad + d7
(MM7)
(Mm7)
(mm7)
(ø7)
(°7)
We will discuss the seventh chord that is most commonly used in tonal music: the dominant seventh. (See
Appendix 5 to learn more about the four other qualities of seventh chords.)
Dominant Seventh Chords
In Western tonal music the dominant seventh chord is the most frequently used seventh chord.
Note:
•
The dominant seventh, written V7, is constructed on the fifth scale degree of a scale—hence the name
dominant seventh.
•
When the dominant seventh is identiﬁed by letter name, the letter name and a “7” are commonly used, for
example, D7.
•
The dominant seventh chord consists of a major triad with the addition of a fourth note a minor seventh
(m7) above the root. Jazz musicians might call this quality “Major-minor.” For example:
423
S E V E N T H  C H O R D S
I
V7
Key: G
D7
D major triad with m7 above (Mm7)

Two Methods of Writing Dominant Seventh Chords
Method 1: Using the major key signature to draw a dominant seventh chord
Locate the dominant note of a major scale by counting up ﬁve notes from the tonic; construct the dominant
seventh chord by drawing four notes above the dominant note. For example:
The key signature of E♭major (B♭E♭A♭) provides the accidentals B♭and A♭in the dominant seventh chord.
Exercise 2
Draw dominant seventh chords using the major key signatures given below. Identify the key and letter name of
the V7 chord.

•
One may also draw a dominant seventh chord by adding a minor third (m3) above a major triad.
Exercise 3
Draw dominant seventh chords from the given root.
Note: One may also use the major key signature to assist in constructing a dominant seventh chord from a given
root. To do this, descend a perfect ﬁfth (P5) from the given chord root (the V) to the tonic (I) to determine the
key signature. Apply the sharps or ﬂats of the key signature to the chord.

Inversions of Dominant Seventh Chords
Dominant seventh chords, like triads, may be inverted.
Notice:
•
The seventh chord has four positions: root position and three inversions. (The triad, with only three notes,
has three positions: root position and two inversions.)
•
Unlike triad inversions, seventh chord inversions in close position will have an interval of a second at the
top, the middle, or the bottom of the chord. It is this interval relationship of a major second in the inverted
chords (the whole step between F and G), and the interval of the seventh in the root position chord, that
provide the important dissonance which is essential and characteristic of a seventh chord.
In this example, the root is G, which is colored in. The interval of the second is circled. The root of the seventh
chord (G) is the upper note of the second; you may use the interval of the second to identify the inversion and
the root of the chord.
•
In root position, notes are thirds apart.
•
In ﬁrst inversion, the interval of the second is at the top of the chord.
•
In second inversion, the second is in the middle.
•
In third inversion, the second is at the bottom.
Figured Bass Symbols for Seventh Chords
Following are the ﬁgured bass symbols of the dominant seventh chord and its inversions. Numbers are for all

The subdominant (IV) and dominant (V) are inverted to create a smooth voice leading between the chords.
•
The V6/5 adds the seventh tone above the dominant to the triad. In the preceding chord progression, the
added note is the G.
•
Frequently the ﬁfth of the dominant seventh chord may be omitted. Your instructor will play the following
examples for you: listen for whether or not the chord is complete.
Exercise 8 Class Listening Exercise
Compare two similar chord progressions; the ﬁrst one uses the dominant seventh chord while the second one
uses a dominant triad. Your instructor will play the two progressions for the class. Notice the added tension in
the V7 chord that does not exist in the dominant triad. Can you identify the notes that create this tension? 
For example:

The French composer Claude Debussy (1862–1918) frequently used fourths, ﬁfths, octaves, or seventh chords in succession
(called “parallel motion” or “planing”). In “Soirée dans Grenade,” Debussy wrote dominant seventh chords in an ascending series.
Notice the omission of the ﬁfth in the chords.

Dominant Seventh Chords in Minor Keys
The harmonic form of the minor scale is used to construct the dominant seventh chord in minor keys.
•
By raising the seventh note in the minor scale, the dominant triad becomes major.
•
The dominant seventh chord is the same for parallel keys (keys that have the same tonic).

In previous modules, we studied the basic components of music: melody (pitch), rhythm (meter), and harmony.
These aspects of music give one the tools to study and create music, just as understanding grammatical rules
gives one the tools to write sentences. In this module we will discuss how to use this knowledge to understand
a musical composition or to create one of your own.
Phrase Structure: Antecedent, Consequent
Musical lines or melodies are often compared to sentences. Just as a sentence may divide into clauses, a musical
line may divide into antecedent and consequent phrases. A phrase may be deﬁned as a “musical sentence.”
Just as a comma or a semicolon is used in a sentence to separate clauses, or a period is used at the end of a sen-
tence, cadences are used in music to mark or delineate phrases. (Cadences will be discussed later in the module.)
For example, in the Trio of Mozart’s “Menuette,” we hear the melody divide into two four-measure phrases.

Listen to the Mozart excerpt, noticing that:
•
Beginning with an anacrusis (“pick-up”) note and ending in measure 4, the ﬁrst phrase is an antecedent
phrase. Although the phrase ends on a longer note value (a half note), it has an unﬁnished or incomplete
quality to it because it does not end on a note of the tonic triad.
•
Beginning on the third beat of measure 4 until measure 8, the second phrase is a consequent phrase. It is
almost identical to the ﬁrst phrase; however, it ends on an F tonic note in both the bass and the melody.
This gives the phrase a feeling of completion.
•
The two phrases together form a period. When two phrases begin identically as in this song, they form a
parallel period.
Exercise 1 Class Exercise
Sing the following melodies.
•
The combination of lyrics and music contributes to the phrase structure of a melody; begin by looking for
repetition and contrast in the lyrics and the melody. Say the words aloud and then sing the words with the
melody.
•
Each of the melodies divides into two phrases. Identify the phrases and then label them “antecedent” or
“consequent.”
•
The two phrases form a period. Name the type of period: parallel or contrasting.
Musical note: Phrase structure
PHRASE
A “musical sentence” usually 4–8 measures long that is concluded by a cadence (to be discussed beginning on page 441).
ANTECEDENT PHRASE
The “question,” with an ending that sounds momentary. The antecedent phrase usually does not end on the tonic note.
CONSEQUENT PHRASE
The “answer,” with an ending that sounds ﬁnal. The consequent phrase usually ends on the tonic note.
PERIOD
Two phrases, the antecedent followed immediately by the consequent. The phrases may be parallel (phrases begin alike) or
contrasting (phrases begin differently).

1.
“Georgia on My Mind” (words by S. Gorrell, music by H. Carmichael)
2.
“Cielito Lindo” (Q. Mendoza y Cortés)
Cadences: Authentic, Half, Plagal, Deceptive
Phrase endings, called cadences, are identified by the last two different kinds of chords that are used to
harmonize the ﬁnal notes of a phrase. If we compare cadences in music to the punctuation marks that are used
in sentences, cadences may correspond to commas, periods, question marks, or exclamation marks. We will
study four cadences: the authentic, half, plagal, and deceptive cadence.
Authentic Cadence
When the last two chords of a phrase are V–I, the result is an authentic cadence. This gives a conclusive ending
to a phrase, much like a period marks the end of a sentence. The consequent phrase of a musical period
frequently ends with an authentic cadence. Listen to your instructor play the following authentic cadences.
441

pret-ty dar-ling, there

scend-ing –

struck my heart.

Notice:
•
In a major key, the authentic cadence is V–I.
•
In a minor key, the authentic cadence is V–i. In E minor the raised seventh from the harmonic minor creates
the leading tone, D♯, and the dominant triad becomes a major triad.

Notice that:

This melody forms a period; the ﬁrst phrase is an antecedent phrase and the second is the consequent phrase.
•
Not every V–I (or V7–I) chord progression forms an authentic cadence; only the last two chords at the end
of a phrase establish a cadence.
•
Both phrases end with an authentic cadence, but the ﬁnal melodic notes are different. The ﬁrst phrase ends
on the dominant (C), while the second phrase ends on the tonic (F), giving the ﬁnal cadence a feeling of
completion or ﬁnality. Listen to the example again to hear the difference.

Notice that:
•
This melody consists of two dissimilar phrases that form a contrasting period.
•
The first phrase ends with a half cadence (ii V), creating the antecedent phrase. This phrase sounds
inconclusive; if you play only the antecedent phrase, it will sound incomplete.
•
The second phrase ends with an authentic cadence (V I), creating the consequent phrase. Because the last
chord is the tonic triad with the tonic G in the melody and the bass, the phrase sounds complete, or ﬁnal.

Plagal Cadence
Plagal cadences are used less frequently as ﬁnal cadences in a piece or a large section of music. The ﬁnal chord
is the tonic preceded by the subdominant (IV–I). This is sometimes called the “Amen” cadence because of its
use at the end of hymns. Listen to your instructor play the following plagal cadences.
Notice:
•
In a major key, the plagal cadence is IV–I; both chords are major.
•
In a minor key, the plagal cadence is iv–i; both chords are minor.

Exercise 16a Cadence drawing: authentic, half and plagal cadences.
Deceptive Cadence
In a deceptive cadence, the dominant chord resolves to an unexpected chord, rather than the tonic. In the second
example (a deceptive cadence), the dominant (V) resolves to the submediant (vi or VI), the most common resolution.
Listen to your instructor play the following authentic and deceptive cadences.
Notice that:
•
In the above examples, the last triads in both cadences share two notes; only the bass clef note (the root of
the triad) is different. This is because the tonic and submediant triads have two notes in common.
•
In a major key, the deceptive cadence is V–vi (the submediant is minor).
•
In a minor key, the deceptive cadence is V–VI (the submediant is major).

Forms
Form is the organizing structure of a piece, which is determined by musical elements such as melody, harmony,
rhythm (meter), and character (mood). We will discuss four forms: binary, ternary, the 32-bar form, and 12-bar

blues. These forms divide into sections, each of which will each be given identifying letter names like “A” and
“B.”
Binary Form: Two-part Form
Binary form consists of two sections of similar lengths which repeat.
The melodic material in the B section may be similar to that of the A section, but the key in the B section may
change to a related key, such as the dominant. For a piece in a minor key, the B section may change to the
relative major. This key change, called a modulation, occurs without a change in key signature. The composition
will return to the tonic key before the end of the piece.

The A section begins in C major and modulates to the dominant (G). The C♯and D♯in mm. 2, 4, and 6
embellish the melody, while the F♯in mm. 5, 7, and 8 indicates a modulation to G major.
•
The B section uses identical melodic and rhythmic material as the A section, but begins in G major and
returns to C major before the end of the piece.
Ternary Form: Three-part Form
Ternary form is a three-part form (ABA) where the A and B sections are contrasting in key and frequently in
mood or character. A change in the key signature may accompany the change in key.

32-Bar Form (AABA)
The 32-bar form, so-called because of the number of measures (bars) in the song, is an AABA pattern. It is one
of the most common forms used for songs, including popular, folk, and rock. In its simplest form, it consists of
four eight-measure segments. The first A section ends on the tonic and repeats. The B section, which is
sometimes called the bridge in pop songs, may be contrasting in key and mood; it ends with a half cadence,
which leads back to the ﬁnal A section.

12-Bar Blues
The 12-bar blues is a chord progression used not only in many blues songs (for which it is named) but is also
the harmonic basis of many popular songs. In its simplest form, it uses the primary triads in a key (I IV V).
Following is a common blues progression.

Exercise 16.5 Class Exercise
Improvise a melody to a 12-bar blues progression in C major; perform this for the class.
There are only three rules:
•
Play notes of the scales that have been notated.
•
Always maintain a steady beat. (If a “wrong” note is played, do not stop.)
•
For the bass, play the 12-bar blues progression. (You may also use Track #111.)
1.
Notate the triads using a C major blues progression. The ﬁrst measure is done for you.
2.
Using the blues scale patterns shown in the box below, notate the blues scale of your choice (or the
instructor’s) on the staff below for the tonic, subdominant, and dominant keys.
Blues scale on tonic: C
Blues scale on subdominant: F
467
The 12-bar blues pattern may use just the primary triads of the scale: I, IV, V. The melody may use a variety of blues scales
including the ﬁve-note (pentatonic) scale, the six-note (hexatonic) scale, or ten-note chromatic scale.

Exercise 16.6
Analyze the pieces in Appendices 8–11 on the website. Discuss how cadences, phrase structure, the melodic
line, and underlying harmony contribute to the form of the piece.
Exercise 16.7
Using your knowledge of keys, scales, rhythm, and phrase structure, compose your own melodies in binary,
ternary, 32-bar, and 12-bar blues forms. Lyrics may be added to the 32-bar song or 12-bar blues. (Some composers
prefer to write the lyrics ﬁrst, and compose a melody to accompany the words.) Harmonize your melodies using
your knowledge of triads and seventh chords. Share your compositions with the class.

APPENDIX 2
ACOUSTICS
Acoustics (from the Greek verb akouo or “to hear” or “to listen”) is a branch of science that studies sound. In
music, sound is deﬁned in four ways: pitch, duration, volume and timbre. We studied these musical components
in the earlier modules; in this appendix we will brieﬂy discuss the science of these components.
Pitch (Frequency)
Sound is determined by the number of vibrations per second (frequency) created by a vibrating object. If the
vibrations are regular, a pitch is produced. Random vibrations produce non-pitched sounds, for example, 
the sound of a jet or a tambourine. 
Note:
•
Frequency may be deﬁned as the number of times a pattern repeats (or cycles); frequency is measured 
in Hertz (Hz), which is the number of cycles per second. Humans hear sounds between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. 
•
Frequency determines pitch; the higher the frequency, the higher the pitch. Today we use 440 Hz (the A
above middle C) as the pitch for tuning.
•
Octave pitches are created by doubling or halving a frequency. For example, a piano string vibrating at 220
Hz will produce the A below middle C. A string half as long will vibrate at 440 Hz, or twice the frequency,
and produce the A above middle C, or an octave higher. In fact, all octave pitches vibrate at a ratio of 2:1;
therefore all A’s will be a multiple of 440.
•
All intervals may be expressed as the ratio of the frequency of vibration from one pitch to another; notice
that the harmonic series shown below is derived from these ratios. For example, octaves vibrate at the ratio
of 2:1. The perfect ﬁfth vibrates at the ratio of 3:2.

* Note: The A♭is particularly out of tune with tempered tuning; other discrepancies include the seventh (B♭) and eleventh
(F♯) partials, or “parts” of the fundamental pitch.

•
Intervals may be described as consonant (sounds that are stable, “pleasing” to the ear) or dissonant (sounds
that are needing to be resolved, “displeasing” to the ear). As described in frequency ratios, consonant
intervals are expressed in simpler ratios (for example, 2:1 is an octave, and 3:2 is a P5), and dissonant
intervals are expressed in more complex ratios, (for example, 15:8 is a M7, and 16:15 is a m2).
•
Each pitch consists of the lowest frequency (the fundamental) and a series of higher frequencies (harmonics
or overtones). The entire series is called a harmonic series (or overtone series). It is the relative strength, or
“amplitude,” of each of the frequencies that determines the “color” or “timbre” of an instrument.
Duration
Musicians refer to rhythmic values when speaking of duration: how long does a note (or silence) last? Duration
also may be affected by the attack, decay, sustain and release of the note.
•
The attack is the initial creation of the sound. For example, is the ﬂute “tongued” giving the note a sharp
attack? How does the pianist strike the key: with a sharp accent or a gentle drop?
•
The decay is the decrease in volume after the attack. Some instruments like wood blocks have an immediate
decay and the sound disappears immediately after the attack. Other instruments like the organ can maintain
their volume indeﬁnitely.
•
The sustain is the length of time before the sound becomes inaudible. This aspect of duration is different
from the rhythmic value of a note. For example, the quarter note receives one beat.
•
The release is the end of the note. On a piano, the key is released; the ﬂutist stops the ﬂow of air.
Volume (Intensity)
When a sound is created, air molecules are set in motion, resulting in vibrations; the higher the frequency of
vibrations, the higher the pitch. The volume of the sound, however, is determined by how much the air mole-
cules expand and compress (the amplitude), which affects the air pressure. The greater the increase and decrease
in air pressure, the greater the sound’s intensity. A sound wave’s intensity is related to its amplitude. Musicians
use the term dynamics when talking about intensity.  
Note:
•
Intensity is measured in decibels (dB) beginning with 0 dB, which is the softest sound that humans can hear. 
•
Examples of sounds measured in dB include a whisper (20 dB) to the sound of a large orchestra (98 dB).
Sounds at 160 dB will cause instant and irreparable hearing loss.
Color (Timbre)
Each sound created by an instrument consists of more than one frequency. These frequencies are not heard as dis-
crete ones, but as a combination of the frequencies. The instruments from around the world are classiﬁed by type:

Similar instruments within each classiﬁcation have a similar series of frequencies. This aspect of sound is called
timbre, or color; for example, a trumpet has a distinctly different sound from a violin, and a singer sounds
noticeably different from a sitar.

APPENDIX 3
C CLEFS (ALTO AND TENOR)
Beginning in the Middle Ages, C clefs, in addition to F and G clefs, were used. Today, music continues to be
written using C clefs in order to avoid the excessive use of ledger lines and octave signs. The most common 
C clefs are the alto and tenor clefs, which are used by instruments such as the viola (alto clef) and, for higher
passages on the cello (tenor clef). Notice that middle C is the third line in the alto clef, and the fourth line in
the tenor clef.
Following is an excerpt from Franz Schubert’s String Quartet in D, D. 74. Here, the viola part is written in the
alto clef, where the third line is middle C. Unlike the two violins that play the melody an octave apart, the viola
and cello play in unison for the ﬁrst two measures. In mm. 3–4, the viola plays an octave higher than the cello.
In writing the viola part in the alto clef, the range of the music may be more easily notated within the staff.

APPENDIX 4
MODES
The music of Europe from the Middle Ages to the end of the Renaissance (from the Fall of Rome in 476 to around
1600) was based on a system of scales called modes; we identify this music as “modal music.” Two of these
modes, the Ionian and Aeolian modes, continued to be used in Western music from around 1600 through much
of the nineteenth century, creating the major-minor system; we identify this music as “tonal music.” Beginning
in the late nineteenth century, composers began to use modes again as the basis of their pieces. Popular music
from the Middle Ages to the present, including folk and some jazz melodies, has roots in the modes.
There are seven modes. Notice that: 
•
Modes span an octave, beginning and ending on the same pitch. 
•
Each mode consists of a different arrangement of whole steps and half steps. 
•
Medieval theorists gave Greek names to the modes although they do not resemble Greek modes. 
•
The modes are written without accidentals. In practice, Medieval musicians added the Bb and later, other
accidentals, to avoid the tritone (A4 or d5). Adding accidentals contributed to the eventual breakdown of
the modal system. 
Ionian mode (presently the major scale); has half steps between 3–4 and 7–8. 
Dorian mode has half steps between 2–3 and 6–7. 
Phrygian mode has half steps between 1–2 and 5–6.

Locrian mode has half steps between 1–2 and 4–5.

Gregory the Great, the ﬁrst great pope of the Middle Ages, solidiﬁed papal power (c. 590–604). He is credited with composing
much of the music used in the Roman liturgy, resulting in the label “Gregorian chant.” It is more likely that Pope Gregory codiﬁed
these chants, rather than composing them. To the original four modes described by St. Ambrose, the fourth century theorist, Pope
Gregory added four others.
Historical note

Exercise 1 
Following are two examples of Gregorian chant from the 11th–13th centuries. In these examples, the ﬁrst and
last pitch of each example is the ﬁrst note of the mode of the piece. Medieval theorists called this note the ﬁnalis
(comparable to our tonic). Notice that the chants are written without time signatures or barlines.

Kyrie, Easter Mass (Mixolydian mode) 
2.
Alleluia (Dorian mode) 
A P P E N D I X  4

Exercise 2 
Many folk songs are modal; frequently, composers wrote melodies based on folk song or dance elements. Identify
the mode of the following examples. 
1.
“Wayfaring Stranger,” American spiritual 
2.
“D’ror Yikra,” Middle Eastern folk song 
Notice the changing time signatures. Keep the quarter note beat constant throughout the song.

3.
Mazurka, Op. 24, No. 2 (F. Chopin) (Originally written an octave higher.)
Transposing Modes
Modes originally were sung without any accidentals; on the keyboard, we would only use the white keys from
C to C (Ionian), D to D (Dorian), and so forth. Just as major and minor scales may be played beginning on any
note (called transposition), modes may also be transposed to different pitches. There are two methods to
transpose modes: 1) using the arrangement of whole and half steps; 2) using the key signature. 
First Method of Modal Transposition: Using Whole 
and Half Steps
Begin by reviewing the arrangement of whole and half steps for each mode given at the beginning of this
appendix. For example, the Phrygian mode has half steps between 1–2 and 5–6. Notice the accidentals that
would be needed to create these half steps when the Phrygian mode begins on G, rather than E.

Vocabulary
MAZURKA
A mazurka (“mazurek” in Polish), is a Polish dance in triple meter, usually with an accent on the second or third beat. It frequently
uses trills, triplets, two eighth notes followed by two quarter notes, or a dotted eighth followed by a sixteenth note. Like many
Polish folk songs, mazurkas are modal, usually Lydian. Chopin, whose mother was Polish, composed over 50 stylized mazurkas. 
RITEN
(Italian: ritenuto) means ’held back’, to suddenly slow the tempo.
riten.
riten.

G Phyrgian mode 
The Mixolydian mode has half steps between 3–4 and 6–7. To transpose the Mixolydian mode from G to F, two
ﬂats would be needed as shown below. 
F Mixolydian 
Second Method of Modal Transposition: Using the 
Key Signature
When only the white keys of the keyboard are used to write the modes, the Ionian mode begins on C. When we
transpose the Ionian mode to a different note, we can use the key signature of the corresponding major scale of
the Ionian mode. For example, if the Ionian mode begins on E♭, the major key signature for E♭is three ﬂats: B♭,
E♭and A♭. All other modes now begin on subsequent notes of the E♭major scale as shown below. 
E♭Ionian mode: half steps between 3–4 and 7–8.

To write the G Phrygian mode, we begin on G and use three ﬂats in the key signature. (Note that the Phrygian
mode is a M3 above the Ionian mode; G is a M3 above E♭.) Compare this with G Phrygian written using the ﬁrst
method of constructing modes using whole and half steps. 
G Phrygian mode with a key signature 
To write the B♭Mixolydian mode, we begin on B♭and use three flats in the key signature. (Note that the
Mixolydian mode is the ﬁfth note (P5) above the Ionian mode; B♭is a P5 above E♭.) Compare this with the B♭
Mixolydian written using whole and half steps. 
B♭Mixolydian mode with a key signature 
Notice: 
•
In order to use a key signature to determine the accidentals in a mode, establish the interval of the ﬁrst note
of the mode (which we will call the “tonic”) in relation to the “tonic” of the Ionian mode. 
•
Study the following list. 
Ionian
Tonic note of a major scale. 
Dorian
Second note of a major scale, M2 above the tonic 
Phrygian
Third note of a major scale, M3 above the tonic 
Lydian
Fourth note of a major scale, P4 above the tonic 
Mixolydian
Fifth note of a major scale, P5 above the tonic 
Aeolian
Sixth note of a major scale, M6 above the tonic 
Locrian
Seventh note of a major scale, M7 above the tonic 
Exercise 3 
Using the list given above, you can determine the mode of a song by determining the interval of tonic of the
major scale to the tonic of the mode.

Modes and Blues Harmony 
Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, jazz, rock and blues musicians began to use modal harmonies in their songs.
Listen to Miles Davis (including “So What” and the album “Kind of Blue”), The Rolling Stones (“I’m Crying”),
The Who, or Crosby, Stills and Nash for examples of modal inﬂuences in jazz, rock, or blues music.

OTHER SEVENTH CHORDS (MAJOR, MINOR, 
HALF DIMINISHED, DIMINISHED)
There are ﬁve qualities of seventh chords. In Module 15 we studied the dominant seventh chord. In this appen-
dix, we will study the other four seventh chords: major seventh, minor seventh, half diminished seventh, and
diminished seventh.
In their simplest form, seventh chords have four notes, consecutive thirds apart. It is the quality of each of
the thirds that determines the quality of the seventh chord. Additionally, determining the quality of the triad
of the lowest three notes of the seventh chord and the quality of the seventh (from the lowest to the highest
note) helps to determine the quality of the seventh chord.
The seventh chords for C as the root are shown below.
Major Seventh Chords
Major seventh chords consist of a major triad and a major seventh (M7) from the root of the chord up to the
seventh.
In a major scale, major seventh chords are formed on the tonic and subdominant notes.
C major 7
C dom 7
C minor 7
C half dim7

Exercise 1
Draw major seventh chords from the given root.
Minor Seventh Chords
Minor seventh chords consist of a minor triad and a minor seventh (m7) from the root of the chord up to the
seventh.
In a major scale, minor seventh chords are formed on the supertonic, mediant, and submediant notes.
Exercise 2
Draw minor seventh chords from the given root.
Half Diminished Seventh Chords
Half diminished seventh chords consist of a diminished triad and a minor seventh (m7) from the root of the
chord up to the seventh. The half diminished seventh chord may also be identiﬁed by the “degree” sign slashed
with a forward stroke (for example Gø7).

Exercise 3
Draw half diminished seventh chords from the given root.
Diminished Seventh Chords
Diminished seventh chords (also called “fully diminished” seventh chords), consist of a diminished triad and
a diminished seventh (d7) from the root of the chord up to the seventh. The diminished seventh chord may also
be identiﬁed with the “degree” sign (for example Gø7).
Diminished seventh chords are formed on the leading tone of the harmonic minor scale. In a major scale, half
diminished seventh chords are formed on the leading tone note; in a harmonic scale, half diminished seventh
chords are formed on the supertonic note.
Exercise 4
Draw diminished seventh chords from the given root.

BASIC GUITAR CHORDS
Guitar music may be notated in four ways:
•
Fretboard diagrams (also called chord diagrams) showing the vertical arrangement of the six guitar strings
with numbers indicating the ﬁnger that will play on a speciﬁc guitar string and fret.
•
Chord symbols (for example, G or D7) written above a song.
•
Tablature showing the horizontal arrangement of the six guitar strings where fret numbers are printed on
the speciﬁc string to be played. Music may be notated in the treble clef above the tablature.
•
Treble clef notation where the written notes sound an octave lower than written.
This section will focus on fretboard diagrams to show the chords that are commonly used in musical styles such
as folk, blues, and rock.  
•
In fretboard diagrams, the guitar’s six strings are drawn vertically beginning with the lowest string on the
left (E), and ending two octaves higher on the right (E).
