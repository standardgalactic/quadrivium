Preface 
Welcome to Mastering ArcGIS, a detailed primer on learning the ArcGIS™ software by ESRI®, 
Inc. This book is designed to offer everything you need to master the basic elements of GIS. 
Notice: ArcGIS™, ArcMap™, ArcCatalog™, ArcGIS Desktop™, ArcInfo Workstation™, and the 
other program names used in this text are registered trademarks of ESRI, Inc. The software names

What’s new in the seventh edition? 
The primary goals for this edition included strengthening the data management content and 
placing more emphasis on managing and compiling GIS data, as well as writing metadata. I am 
finding that students these days know less about basic computer file system concepts than I 
expect, and they need more background and instruction to work effectively with GIS data. I 
added a new chapter on GIS data management to cover these concepts, and reorganized the 
chapters to cover data management first, which appears to be the way most instructors like to 
structure their courses. Metadata is more strongly emphasized throughout, first as the simple Item 
Description and later as standards-based metadata in Chapter 14. 
The chapter on data presentation is almost entirely rewritten to present basic map design 
principles and processes from an academic cartographic design perspective. I have also made 
numerous additions and improvements to other chapters, such as adding weighted overlay to 
raster analysis and moving erase and clip to the chapter on queries. 
With the book length fixed by the publisher, however, I had to eliminate material to make room 
for these improvements. The chapters on networks and geocoding have been removed from the 
text, since most people I have talked to don’t use them in an introductory class. However, they 
will remain available on the McGraw-Hill web site in PDF form. The data files needed for these 
chapters remain in the data provided on the book web site. 
I have found welcome stability in the procedures and menus throughout ArcGIS Versions 10.1, 
10.2, and 10.2.2, and this edition will work well with any of them and most likely 10.3 as well.  
I would like to thank the many people who have used and commented on this book, and I hope 
that it continues to serve their needs in the rapidly evolving world of GIS. 
Looking ahead 
ESRI is releasing a completely redesigned ArcGIS Desktop product in late fall 2014, called 
ArcGIS Professional. It has a 64-bit, multithreaded architecture, uses ribbon-style menus, will 
integrate 2D and 3D applications, and is closely tied to ArcGIS Online. The eighth edition of 
Mastering ArcGIS will be written for ArcGIS Professional. It seemed premature to use it for the 
seventh edition because it is still in development, does not yet include all the functionality 
currently available, and requires a 64-bit computer, which may not be standard equipment in all 
campus labs yet. ArcMap and ArcCatalog will exist side-by-side with this new program for many 

Preface

years yet, and we anticipate keeping the seventh edition of Mastering ArcGIS in print as long as 
needed for those continuing to use them.  
Previous experience 
This book assumes that the reader is comfortable using Windows™ to carry out basic tasks such 
as copying files, moving directories, opening documents, exploring folders, and editing text and 
word processing documents. Previous experience with maps and map data is also helpful. No 
previous GIS experience or training is necessary to use this book. 
Elements of the package 
This learning system includes a textbook and web site, including 
¾ Fourteen chapters on the most important capabilities of ArcGIS 
¾ Comprehensive tutorials in every chapter to learn the skills, with each step demonstrated 
in a video clip 
¾ A set of exercises, map documents, and data for practicing skills independently 
¾ Reference sections on skills with video clips demonstrating each one 
This book assumes that the student has access to ArcGIS Desktop Basic (formerly ArcView). A 
few optional topics are introduced that require an ArcGIS Desktop Standard (formerly ArcEditor) 
license. The Spatial Analyst extension is required for Chapter 11.  
Philosophy 
This text reflects the author’s personal philosophies and prejudices developed from 20 years of 
teaching GIS at an engineering school. The main goal is not to train geographers but to provide 
students in any field with GIS skills and knowledge. It is assumed that most students using this 
book already have a background of discipline-specific knowledge and skills upon which to draw 
and are seeking to apply geospatial techniques within their own knowledge domains. 
¾ GIS is best learned by doing it, not by studying it. The laboratory is THE critical 
component of the book, and theory is introduced sparingly and integrated with 
experience. Hence, this book is heavy on experience and lighter on theory. 
¾ Independent work and projects are critical to learning GIS. This book includes a 
wealth of exercises in which the student must find solutions independently without  
a cookbook recipe of steps. A wise instructor will also require students to develop an 
independent project. 
Chapter sequence 
The book contains an introduction and 14 chapters. Each chapter includes roughly one week’s 
work for a three-credit semester course. This book intentionally contains more material than the 
average GIS class can cover during a single semester; instructors may choose what to emphasize. 
An introductory chapter describes GIS and gives some examples of how it is used. It also 
provides an overview of GIS project management and how to develop a project. Chapters 1–11 
follow a roughly project-based sequence: data compilation, data exploration and mapping, tables 
and basic editing, and analysis. These chapters are the core of an introductory GIS class and, by 

Preface 
ix 
the end of it, students should have little difficulty developing and carrying out an independent 
GIS project. The final chapters introduce several more advanced topics in data management. 
Chapter layout 
Each chapter is organized into the following sections: 
¾ Concepts: provides basic background material for understanding geographic concepts 
and how they are specifically implemented within ArcGIS. Most chapters have two 
sections, one (GIS Concepts) covering general GIS concepts and theory, and another 
(About ArcGIS) covering the specific implantation of those concepts within ArcGIS 
Desktop. A set of review questions and important terms follows the concepts section. 
¾ Tutorial: contains a step-by-step tutorial demonstrating the concepts and skills. The 
tutorials begin with detailed instructions, which gradually become more general as 
mastery is built. Every step in the tutorial is demonstrated by accompanying video clips. 
¾ Exercises: presents a series of problems to build skill in identifying the appropriate 
techniques and applying them without step-by-step help. Through these exercises, the 
student builds an independent mastery of GIS processes. Brief solution methods are 
included for all exercises, and maps of the results are shown when applicable. A full 
answer and methods document is available for instructors at the McGraw-Hill Instructor 
web site. 
The web site also contains all the data needed to follow the tutorials and complete the exercises. 
Instructors should use judgment in assigning exercises, as the typical class would be stretched to 
complete all the exercises in every chapter. Very good students can complete the entire chapter in 
3–6 hours, most students would need 6–8 hours, and a few students would require 10 or more 
hours. Students with more computer experience generally find the material easier than others. 
Using this text 
In working through this book, the following sequence of steps is suggested:  
¾ READ through the Concepts sections to get familiar with the principles and techniques. 
¾ ANSWER the Chapter Review Questions to test comprehension of the material. 
¾ WORK the Tutorial section for a step-by-step tutorial and explanation of key techniques. 
¾ REREAD the Concepts section to reinforce the ideas.  
¾ PRACTICE by doing the Exercises. 
Using the tutorial 
The tutorial provides step-by-step practice and introduces details on how to perform specific 
tasks. Students should be encouraged to think about the steps as they are performed and not just 
race to get to the end.  
It is important to follow the directions carefully. Skipping a step or doing it incorrectly may result 
in a later step not working properly. Saving often will make it easier to go back and correct a 
mistake in order to continue. Occasionally, a step will not work due to differences between 

Preface 
x 
computer systems or software versions. Having an experienced user nearby to identify the 
problem can help. If one isn’t available, however, just skip the step and move on without it. 
Using the videos 
The web site contains two types of videos. The Tutorial Videos demonstrate each step of the 
tutorial. They are numbered in the text for easy reference. The Skills Reference Videos show how 
to perform generic tasks, such as deleting a file. The videos are intended as an alternate learning 
strategy. It would be tedious to watch all of them. Instead, use them in the following situations: 
¾ When the student does not understand the written instructions or cannot find the correct 
menu or button 
¾ When a step cannot be made to work properly 
¾ When a reminder is needed to do a previously learned skill in order to complete a step 
¾ When a student finds that watching the videos enhances learning 
As you work through a chapter, keep the web site video listing on the screen, and click the 
appropriate link to see a video. The tutorial clips are distinguished by numbered steps and the 
Skills Reference Videos by their headings. 
Using video and data components 
Using the videos: 
The videos are available for download from the book web site. Each chapter may be downloaded 
separately. The videos for Chapter 1 must be downloaded first, for they contain the instructions 
and folder hierarchy needed for the subsequent chapters. Please review the instructions in the 
Chapter 1 download before downloading the rest of the videos. 
To install the training data: 
The mgisdata.exe archive contains a folder with the documents and data needed to do the 
tutorials and exercises. The student must copy this folder to his own hard drive. If more than one 
person on the computer is using this book, then each person should make her own copy of the 
data in a separate folder. The data in the exe archive are a self-extracting zip file that requires 
approximately 350 MB of disk space. Follow these instructions to install the data: 
¾ Click on the link to Install Data. If a dialog window appears asking whether to Run or 
Save the data, choose Run. 
¾ When a dialog box 
appears asking whether to 
Open or Save the data, 
choose Open. Don’t 
choose Save because it 
will only copy the data 
archive instead of 
extracting it.  
¾ Click the Browse button to 
set the folder to which to 
extract the data (a). The 
data will be placed in a 
Installing the training data 
a 

Preface 
xi 
folder called mgisdata in whatever location you choose. In other words, if you select 
C:\gisclass as the target folder, then the data will be placed in C:\gisclass\mgisdata. 
¾ Click Start to begin installing the data. It may take several minutes. Wait until you see the 
Finished window and then click OK. 
System requirements 
To use the tutorials and do the exercises in this book, the student must have access to a computer 
with the following characteristics: 
Minimum hardware:  
 
PC-Intel™-platform computer with 2.2-GHz processor or better and 2 GB RAM

Acknowledgments 
I would like to thank many people who made this book possible. Governor Janklow of South 
Dakota funded a three-month summer project in 2000 that got the book started, as part of his 
Teaching with Technology program. Many students in my GIS classes between 2000 and 2014 
tested the text and exercises and helped immensely in making sure the tutorials were clear and 
worked correctly. Reviewers of previous editions, including Richard Aspinall, Joe Grengs, Tom

What is GIS? 
GIS stands for Geographic Information System. In practical terms, a GIS is a set of computer 
tools that allows people to work with data that are tied to a particular location on the earth. 
Although many people think of a GIS as a computer mapping system, its functions are 
broader and more sophisticated than that. A GIS is a database that is designed to work with 
map data. 
Consider the accounting department of the local telephone company. They maintain a large 
computer database of their customers, in which they store the name, address, phone number, type 
of service, and billing information for each customer. This information is only incidentally tied to 
where customers live; they can carry out most of the important functions (billing, for example) 
without needing to know where each house is. Of course, they need to have addresses for mailing 
bills, but it is the post office that worries about where the houses actually ARE. This type of 
information is called aspatial data, meaning that it is not tied, or is only incidentally tied, to a 
location on the earth’s surface. 
Employees of the service department, however, need to work with spatial data to provide the 
telephone services. When hundreds of people call in after a power outage, the service 
department must analyze the distribution of the calls and isolate the location where the outage 
occurred. When a construction company starts work on a street, workers must be informed of 
the precise location of buried telephone cables. If a developer builds a new neighborhood, the 
company must be able to determine the best place to tie into the existing network so that the 
services are efficiently distributed from the main trunk lines. When technicians prepare lists 
of house calls for the day, they need to plan the order of visits to minimize the amount of 
driving time. In these tasks, location is a critical aspect of the job, and the information is 
spatial. 
In this example, two types of software are used. The accounting department uses special software 
called a database management system, or DBMS, which is optimized to work with large volumes 
of aspatial data. The service department needs access to a database that is optimized for working 
with spatial data, a Geographic Information System. Because these two types of software are 
related, they often work together, and they may access the same information. However, they do 
different things with the data. 

Introduction

A GIS is built from a collection of hardware and software components.  
¾ A computer hardware platform. Due to the intensive nature of spatial data storage and 
processing, a GIS was once limited to large mainframe computers or expensive 
workstations. Today, it can run on a typical desktop personal computer. 
¾ GIS software. The software varies widely in cost, ease of use, and level of functionality 
but should offer at least some minimal set of functions, as described in the next few 
paragraphs. In this book, we study one particular package that is powerful and widely 
used, but others are available and may be just as suitable for certain applications. 
¾ Data storage. Some projects use only the hard drive of the GIS computer. Other projects 
may require more sophisticated solutions if large volumes of data are being stored or 
multiple users need access to the same data sets. Today, many data sets are stored in 
digital warehouses and accessed by many users over the Internet. Compact disc writers 
and/or USB portable drives are highly useful for backing up and sharing data.  
¾ Data input hardware. Many GIS projects require sophisticated data entry tools. Digitizer 
tablets enable the shapes on a paper map to be entered as features in a GIS data file. 
Scanners create digital images of paper maps. An Internet connection provides easy 
access to large volumes of GIS data. High-speed connections are preferred, as GIS data 
sets may constitute tens or hundreds of megabytes or more. 
¾ Information output hardware. A quality color printer capable of letter-size prints 
provides the minimum desirable output capability for a GIS system. Printers that can 
handle map-size output (36 in. × 48 in.) will be required for many projects. 
¾ GIS data. Data come from a variety of sources and in a plethora of formats. Gathering 
data, assessing their accuracy, and maintaining them usually constitutes the longest and 
most expensive part of a GIS project. 
¾ GIS personnel. A system of computers and hardware is useless without trained and 
knowledgeable people to run it. The contribution of professional training to successful 
implementation of a GIS is often overlooked.  
GIS software varies widely in functionality, but any system claiming to be a GIS should provide 
the following functions at a minimum: 
¾ Data entry from a variety of sources, including digitizing, scanning, text files, and the 
most common spatial data formats; ways to export information to other programs should 
also be provided 
¾ Data management tools, including tools for building data sets, editing spatial features 
and their attributes, and managing coordinate systems and projections 
¾ Thematic mapping (displaying data in map form), including symbolizing map features in 
different ways and combining map layers for display 
¾ Data analysis functions for exploring spatial relationships in and between map layers 
¾ Map layout functions for creating soft and hard copy maps with titles, scale bars, north 
arrows, and other map elements 
Geographic Information Systems are put to many uses, but providing the means to collect, 
manage, and analyze data to produce information for better decision making is the common goal 
and the strength of each GIS. This book is a practical guide to understanding and using a 
particular Geographic Information System called ArcGIS. Using this book, you can learn what a 
GIS is, what it does, and how to apply its capabilities to solve real-world problems. 

Introduction

A history of GIS 
Geographic Information Systems have grown from a long history of cartography begun in the lost 
mists of time by early tribesmen who made sketches on hides or formed crude models of clay as 
aids to hunting for food or making war. Ptolemy, an astronomer and geographer from the second 
century B.C., created one of the earliest known atlases, a collection of world, regional, and local 
maps and advice on how to draw them, which remained essentially unknown to Europeans until 
the 15th century. Translated into Latin, it became the core of Western geography, influencing 
cartographic giants such as Gerhard Mercator, who published his famous world map in 1569. The 
17th and 18th centuries saw many important developments in cartography, including the 
measurement of a degree of longitude by Jean Picard in 1669, the discovery that the earth flattens 
toward the poles, and the adoption of the Prime Meridian that passes through Greenwich, 
England. In 1859, French photographer and balloonist Gaspard Felix Tournachon founded the art 
of remote sensing by carrying large-format cameras into the sky. In an oft-cited early example of 
spatial analysis, Dr. John Snow mapped cholera deaths in central London in September 1854 and 
was able to locate the source of the outbreak—a contaminated well. However, until the 20th 
century, cartography remained an art and a science carried out by laborious calculation and hand 
drawing. In 1950, Jacqueline Tyrwhitt made the first explicit reference to map overlay techniques 
in an English textbook on town and country planning, and Ian McHarg was one of the early 
implementers of the technique for highway planning. 
As with many other endeavors, the development of computers inspired cartographers to see what 
these new machines might do. The early systems developed by these groups, crude and slow by 
today’s standards, nevertheless laid the groundwork for modern Geographic Information Systems. 
Dr. Roger Tomlinson, head of an Ottawa group of consulting cartographers, has been called the 
“Father of GIS” for his promotion of the idea to use computers for mapping and for his vision and 
effort in developing the Canada Geographic Information System (CGIS) in the mid-1960s. 
Another pioneering group, the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, 
was founded in the mid-1960s by Howard Fisher. He and his colleagues developed a number of 
early programs between 1966 and 1975, including SYMAP, CALFORM, SYMVU, GRID, 
POLYVRT, and ODYSSEY. Other notable developers included professors Nystuen, Tobler, 
Bunge, and Berry from the Department of Geography at Washington University during  
1958–1961. In 1970, the US Bureau of the Census produced its first geocoded census and 
developed the early DIME data format based on the CGIS and POLYVRT data representations. 
DIME files were widely distributed and were later refined into the TIGER format. These efforts 
had a pronounced effect on the development of data models for storing and distributing 
geographic information. 
In 1969, Laura and Jack Dangermond founded the Environmental Systems Research Institute 
(ESRI), which pioneered the powerful idea of linking spatial representation of features with 
attributes in a table, a core idea that revolutionized the industry and launched the development of 
Arc/Info, a program whose descendants have captured about 90% of today’s GIS market. Other 
vendors are still active in developing GIS systems, which include packages MAPINFO, MGA 
from Intergraph, IDRISI from Clark University, and the open-source program GRASS. 
What can a GIS do? 
A GIS works with many different applications: land use planning, environmental management, 
sociological analysis, business marketing, and more. Any endeavor that uses spatial data can 
benefit from a GIS. For example, researchers at the US Department of Agriculture Rocky 
Mountain Research Station in Rapid City conducted a study of elk habitat in the Black Hills of 

Introduction 
4 
South Dakota and Wyoming by placing 
radio transmitter collars on about 70 elk 
bulls and cows (Fig. I.1c). Using the 
collars and a handheld antenna, they 
tracked the animals and obtained their 
locations. Several thousand locations 
were collected (Fig. I.1a), allowing the 
scientists to study the characteristics of 
the habitat where elk spend time. 
The elk locations were entered into a 
GIS system for record keeping and 
analysis. Each location became a point 
with attached information, including the 
animal ID number and the date and time 
of the sighting. Information about 
vegetation, slope, aspect, elevation, 
water availability, and other site factors 
were derived by overlaying the points on 
other data layers, allowing the biologists 
to compare the characteristics of sites utilized by the elk. Figure I.1b shows a map of distances to 
major roads in the central part of the study area. The elk locations clustered in the darker roadless 
areas, and statistical analysis demonstrated this observation empirically. 
There are many applications of GIS in almost every human endeavor, including business, defense 
and intelligence, engineering and construction, government, health and human services, 
conservation, natural resources, public safety, education, transportation, utilities, and 
communication. In August 2014, the Industries section of the ESRI web site at www.esri.com 
listed 62 different application areas in these categories, each one with examples, maps, and case 
studies. Instead of reading through a list here, go to the site and see the latest applications. 
New trends and directions in GIS 
The GIS industry has grown exponentially since its inception. Starting with the mainframe and 
then the desktop computer, GIS began as a relatively private endeavor focused on small clusters 
of specialized workers who spent years developing expertise with the software and data. Since 
then, the development of the Internet and the rapidly advancing field of computer hardware have 
been driving some significant changes in the industry. 
Proliferation of options for data sharing 
Instead of storing data sets locally on individual computers or intra-organization network drives, 
more people are serving large volumes of data over the Internet to remote locations within an 
organization, across organizations, and to the general public. In the past, large collections of data 
were hosted by various organizations through clearinghouses sponsored by the National Spatial 
Data Infrastructure (NSDI) organization. The data usually existed as GIS data files in various 
formats and required significant expertise and the right software to download and use. Today, GIS 
Servers are designed to bring GIS data to the general public within a few clicks. Another class of 
data providers that give wide access to spatial data, although not specifically GIS applications, 
include web sites such as GoogleEarth, MapQuest, and Microsoft Virtual Earth.

Like many other computer industries, GIS is heading for the clouds. A cloud is a gigantic array of 
large computers that customers rent pieces of by the hour, instead of purchasing their own 
physical hardware. ArcGIS Online is a cloud-based platform for users to collaborate and share 
GIS data with one another, making it suddenly very easy to share data with a colleague, or with 
the world, even for those with no particular GIS expertise.  
Proliferation of options for working with GIS data 
In the early days, people who wanted to do GIS had to purchase a large, expensive program and 
learn to use it. Now, a wide variety of scaled applications permits different levels of use for 
different levels of need. Not every user must have the full program. There are map servers for 
people who just need to view and print maps, free download software for viewing interactive map 
publications, and scaled-down versions of the full program with fewer options.  
Many organizations are turning to Server GIS as a less expensive alternative to purchasing large 
numbers of GIS licenses. Many workers need GIS, but they only use a small subset of GIS 
functions on a daily basis. A Server GIS can provide both data and a customizable set of viewing 
and analysis functions to users without a GIS license. All they need is a web browser. Because of 
more simple and low-cost ways of accessing GIS data and functions, the user base has expanded 
dramatically. 
Expansion of GIS into wireless technology 
More people are collecting and sharing data using handheld wireless devices, such as handheld 
computers, smartphones, and global positioning system (GPS) units. These units can now access 
Internet data and map servers directly so that users in the field can download background data 
layers, collect new data, and transmit them back to the large servers. Cell phone technology is 
advancing rapidly with new geolocation options, web access, and geo-applications arriving daily. 
Emphasis on open-source solutions 
Instead of relying on proprietary, specialized software, more GIS functions are now implemented 
within open-source software and hardware. GIS data are now more often stored using engines 
from commercial database platforms and utilize the same development environments as the rest 
of the computer industry. This trend makes it easier to have the GIS communicate with other 
programs and computers and enhances interoperability between systems and parts of systems. 
Customization 
With emphasis on open-source solutions, new opportunities have developed in creating 
customized applications based on a fundamental set of GIS tools, such as a hydrology tool or a 
wildlife management tool. Smartphone and tablet applications programming is burgeoning. 
These custom applications gather the commonly used functions of GIS into a smaller interface, 
introduce new knowledge, and formalize best practices into an easy-to-use interface. 
Customization requires a high level of expertise in object-oriented computer programming.  
Enterprise GIS 
Enterprise GIS integrates a server with multiple ways to access the same data, including 
traditional GIS software programs, web browser applications, and wireless mobile devices. 
The goal is to meet the data needs of many different levels of users and to provide access to 
nontraditional users of GIS. The Enterprise GIS is the culmination of the other trends and 
capabilities already mentioned. The costs and challenges in developing and maintaining an 
Enterprise GIS are significant, but the rewards and cost savings can also be substantial.

What do GIS professionals do? 
It’s getting so easy to create a map these days that one may wonder why one should bother to 
learn GIS. However, the easy solutions are based on the work of experts who provide the data and 
the software systems to handle them. It may not be that hard to learn to use a smartphone, but you 
still need the engineers and software developers to build the phones and the infrastructure to 
make them work. GIS is much the same. These days, GIS professionals play a variety of roles. A 
few broad categories can be defined. 
Primary Data Providers create the base data that form the backbone of many GIS installations. 
Surveyors and land-planning professionals contribute precise measurement of boundaries. 
Photogrammetrists develop elevation and other data from aerial photography or the newer laser 
altimetry (LIDAR) systems. Remote sensing professionals extract all kinds of human-made and 
natural information from a variety of satellite and airborne measurement systems. Experts in 
global positioning systems (GPS), which provide base data, are also important. 
Applications GIS usually involves professionals trained in other fields, such as geography, 
hydrology, land use planning, business, and utilities, who utilize GIS as part of their work. 
Specialists in mathematics and statistics develop new ways to analyze and interpret spatial data. 
For these professionals, GIS is an added skill and a tool to make their work more efficient, 
productive, and valuable.  
Development GIS involves skilled software and hardware engineers who build and maintain the 
GIS software itself, as well as the hardware components upon which it relies—not only 
computers and hard drives and plotters but also GPS units, wireless devices, scanners, digitizers, 
and other systems that GIS could not function without. This group also includes an important 
class of GIS developers who create customized applications from the basic building blocks of 
existing GIS software.  
Distributed Database GIS involves computer science professionals with a background in 
networking, Internet protocols, and/or database management systems. These specialists set up and 
maintain the complex server and network systems that allow data services, Server GIS, and 
Enterprise GIS to operate. 
GIS project management 
A GIS project may be a small effort spanning a couple of days by a single person, or it can be an 
ongoing concern of a large organization with hundreds of people participating. Large or small, 
however, projects often follow the generalized model shown in Figure I.2, and most new users 
learn GIS through a project approach. A project usually begins with an assessment of needs. 
What specific issues must be studied? What kind of information is needed to support decision 
making? What functions must the GIS perform? How long will the project last? Who will be 
using the data? What funding is available for start-up and long-term support?  
Without a realistic idea of what the system must accomplish, it is impossible to design it 
efficiently. Users may find that some critical data are absent or that resources have been wasted 
acquiring data that no one ever uses. In a short-term project the needs are generally clear-cut. A 
long-term organizational system will find that its needs evolve over time, requiring periodic 
reassessment. A well-designed system will adapt easily to future modification. The creator of a 
haphazard system may be constantly redoing previous work when changes arise. 

Introduction 
7 
In studies seeking specific answers to scientific or managerial questions, a methodology or model 
must be chosen. Models convert the raw data of the project into useful information using a well-
defined series of steps and assumptions. Creating a landslides hazards map provides a simple 
example. One might define a model such that, if an area has a steep slope and consists of a shale 
rock unit, then it should be rated as hazardous. The raw data layers of geology and slope can be 
used to create the hazard map. A more complex model might also take into account the dip 
(bedding angle) of the shale units. Models can be very simple, as in this example, or more 
complex with many different inputs and calculations. 
Once needs are known and the appropriate models have been designed, data collection can begin. 
GIS data are stored as layers, with each layer representing one type of information, such as roads 
or soil types. The needs dictate which data layers are required and how accurate they must be. A 
source for each data layer must be found. In some cases data can be obtained free from other 
organizations. General base layers, such as elevation, roads, streams, political boundaries, and 
demographics, are freely available from government sources (although the accuracy and level of 
detail are not always what one might wish). More specific data must often be developed in-house. 
For example, a utility company would need to develop its own layers showing electric lines and 
substations—no one else would be likely to have these data.  
The spatial detail and accuracy of the data must be evaluated to ensure that they are able to meet 
the needs of the project. For example, an engineering firm creating the site plan for a shopping 
mall could download elevation contours of the site for free. However, standard 10-foot contours 
cannot provide the detailed surface information needed by the engineers. Instead, the firm might 
contract with a surveying firm to measure contours at half-foot intervals. 
After the data are assembled, the analysis can begin. During the analysis phase, it is not unusual 
to encounter problems that might require making changes to the model and/or data. Thus, the 
steps of model development, data collection, and analysis often become iterative, as experience 
gained is used to refine the process. The final result must be checked carefully against reality in 
order to recognize any shortcomings and to provide guidelines for improving future work.

Finally, no project is complete until the results have been communicated, whether shown 
informally to a supervisor, published in a scientific journal, or presented during a heated public 
meeting. Presentations may include maps, reports, slides, or other media. 
Learning more about GIS 
As you work your way through this text, you will be amazed at all the things that a GIS can do. 
At times, the abundance of tasks and the flexibility of options may be overwhelming. Even so, 
this book gives only a bare introduction to what is possible and covers a small portion of what a 
GIS can do. Moreover, the industry evolves rapidly. Completing the lessons here is only the first 
step; you will find that you need to seek new information and training constantly as you develop 
your skills. How can you do this? 
¾ Read the Help. Maybe you can figure out your cell phone without the manual, but if you 
ignore the Help files you are turning your back on a wealth of information. They don’t 
just have instructions for doing things but also discussions, diagrams, references, and 
other ways to help you understand the concepts behind GIS as well as its implementation. 
¾ Use the Virtual Campus. ESRI has dozens of online courses and seminars to help you 
learn. Many of the basic ones are free. If your campus has a site license, the GIS 
administrator can request others for free as well. Talk to your GIS instructor about getting 
access to these courses. 
¾ Build your GIS library. GIS integrates many disciplines, including geography, 
surveying, cartography, statistics, computer science, spatial statistics, and so on. The 
more you know of these disciplines, the more you will understand, not just the How of 
doing things but also the Why. 
¾ Join a professional organization. Many professional societies cater to GIS and remote 
sensing. They have newsletters and journals, conferences, and lots of professionals who 
can help answer your questions and share their experiences. 
¾ Join an online forum. ESRI has online forums for many aspects of GIS, as well as other 
useful links, at http://support.esri.com/en/. You can search for answers to questions, and 
if nothing is there, you can ask a question and generally someone will answer within a 
few days. It is a great place to go when you get stuck with no one else to ask. You will 
also learn about bugs and workarounds. 
¾ Join ArcGIS Online. Not only is it easy and fun to create maps and share them, but you 
can also search for courses, documents, slideshows, videos, and other GIS-related 
materials.

GIS Concepts 
Representing real-world objects on maps 
To work with maps on a computer requires developing methods to store different types of map 
data and the information associated with them. Map data fall into two categories: discrete and 
continuous. Discrete data are objects in the real world with specific locations or boundaries, such 
as cities, roads, or soils units. Continuous data represent a quantity that is measured and recorded 
everywhere over a surface, such as temperature or elevation. 
Many different data formats have been invented to encode data for use with GIS programs; 
however, most follow one of two basic approaches: the vector model, which is designed to store 
discrete data, or the raster model, which is designed to store continuous data. In either approach, 
the critical task includes representing the information at a point, or over a region in space, using x 
and y coordinate values (and sometimes z for height). The x and y coordinates are the spatial data. 
The information being represented, such as a soil type or a chemical analysis of a well, is called 
the attribute data. Raster and vector data models both store spatial and attribute data, but they do 
it in different ways.  
Both data systems are georeferenced, meaning 
that the information is tied to a specific location 
on the earth’s surface using x-y coordinates 
defined in a standard way: a coordinate system. 
One can choose from a variety of coordinate 
systems, as we will see in Chapter 3. As long as 
the coordinate systems match, we can display any 
two spatial data sets together, and they will appear 
in the correct spatial relationship to each other. 
The vector model 
Vector data use a series of x-y locations to store 
information (Fig. 1.1). Three basic vector objects 
exist: points, lines, and polygons. These objects 
are called features. Point features are used to 

Chapter 1 
10 
Fig. 1.3. Each state is represented by a 
spatial feature (polygon), which is linked to 
the attributes. 
represent objects that have no dimensions, such as a well or a 
sampling locality. Line features represent objects in one 
dimension, such as a road or a utility line. Polygons are used 
to represent two-dimensional areas, such as a parcel or a state. 
In all cases, the features are represented using one or more x-y 
coordinate locations (Fig. 1.1). A point consists of a single x-y 
coordinate pair. A line includes two or more pairs of 
coordinates—the endpoints of the line are termed nodes, and 
each of the intermediate points is called a vertex. A polygon 
is a group of vertices that define a closed area.  
The type of object used to represent features depends on the scale of the map. A river would be 
represented as a line on a map of the United States because at that scale it is too small for its 
width to encompass any significant area on the map. If one is viewing a USGS topographic map, 
however, the river encompasses an area and would be represented as a polygon. 
In GIS, like features are grouped into data sets called feature classes (Fig. 1.2). Roads and rivers 
are different types of features and would be stored in separate feature classes. A feature class can 
contain only one kind of geometry—it can include point features, line features, or polygon 
features but never a combination. In addition, objects in a feature class have information stored 
about them, such as their names or populations. This information is called the attributes and is 
stored in a table (Fig. 1.3). A special field, called 
the Feature ID (FID) or ObjectID (OID), links the 
spatial data with the attributes. Each feature’s 
attributes are stored in one row of the table, and 
each column has a different type of information, 
such as population or area. A river and a highway 
would not be found in the same feature class 
because their information would be different—
flow measurements for one versus pavement type 
for the other—and would need to be stored in 
different tables with different columns. 
When a state is highlighted on the map, its 
matching attributes are highlighted in the table, 
and vice versa. It is this live link between the 
spatial and attribute information that gives the 
GIS system its power. It enables us, for example, to create a map in which the states are colored 
based on an attribute field, such as population (Fig. 1.2). This technique is called thematic 
mapping and is one example of how linked attributes can be used to analyze geographic 
information.  
Feature classes can be stored in several different formats. Some data formats only contain one 
feature class. Others, called feature datasets, can contain multiple feature classes that are in 
some way related to one another. For example, a feature dataset called Transportation might 
contain the feature classes Roads, Traffic Lights, Railroads, Airports, and Canals.  
The benefits of the vector data model are many. First, it can store individual features, such as 
roads and parcels, with a high degree of precision. Second, the linked attribute table provides 
great flexibility in the number and type of attributes that can be stored about each feature. Third,

the vector model is ideally suited to mapmaking because of the high precision and detail of 
features that can be obtained. The vector model is also a compact way of storing data, typically 
requiring a tenth of the space of a raster with similar information. Finally, the vector model is 
ideally suited to certain types of analysis problems, such as determining perimeters and areas, 
detecting whether features overlap, and modeling flow through networks. 
However, the vector model has some drawbacks. First, it is poorly adapted to storing continuous 
surfaces, such as elevation or precipitation. Contour lines (as on topographic maps) can be used to 
represent surfaces, but calculating derived information from contours, such as slope, flow 
direction, and aspect, is difficult. Finally, some types of analysis are more time-consuming to 
perform with vectors. 
Modeling feature behavior with topology 
Two basic vector models exist: spaghetti models and topological models. A spaghetti model 
stores features of the file as independent objects, unrelated to each other. Simple and 
straightforward, this type of model is found in many types of applications that store spatial data. It 
is also commonly used to transfer vector features from one GIS system to another. 
A topological data model stores features, but it also contains information about how the features 
are spatially related to each other: for example, whether two parcels share a common boundary 
(adjacency), whether two water lines are attached to each other (connectivity), whether a 
company sprayed pesticide over the same area on two different occasions (overlap), or whether a 
highway connects to a crossroad or has an overpass (intersection). Although computer 
algorithms can determine whether these spatial relationships exist between features in a spaghetti 
model, storing topology can save time if the relationships must be used repeatedly. 
Another application of topology involves analyzing the logical consistency of features. Logical 
consistency evaluates whether a data model or data set accurately represents the real-world 
relationships between features. For example, two adjacent states must share a common boundary 
that is exactly the same (the real-world situation), even though the states are stored in the data 
model as two separate features with two boundaries that 
coincide (Fig. 1.4). Lines representing streets should connect 
if the roads they represent meet. A line or a polygon 
boundary should not cross over itself. 
Finally, topology can be used to model the real-world 
behavior of features. In a network topology, for example, the 
connections between features are tracked so that flow through 
the network can be analyzed. Applications of networks 
include water in streams, traffic along roads, flights in and 
out of airline hubs, and utilities through pipes or electrical 
systems. 
The raster model 
The raster model has the benefit of simplicity. A set of spatial data is represented as a series of 
small squares, called cells or pixels (Fig. 1.5). Each pixel contains a numeric code indicating a 
single attribute, and the raster is stored as an array of numbers. 
Coincident 
boundary

gets stored twice but is the same 
for both features.

Vector features, such as roads or land use polygons, can be converted to raster format by selecting 
a single attribute to be stored in the cells. In Figure 1.5a, the cells store numeric values 
representing a land cover type, such as 46 for conifer forest or 23 for hardwood forest. Each value 
is given a different color for display. The roads shown in Figure 1.5b were originally vector line 
features with a text attribute indicating a primary, secondary, or primitive road type. When 
converted to a raster, the number (1, 2, or 3) is used to represent each road that passes through a 
cell. The cells that don’t contain roads are given a null value. Rasters that store vector features in 
a raster format are sometimes called discrete rasters.  
However, rasters excel at storing continuous data, which are quantities or variables that change 
over the earth’s surface. A digital elevation model (DEM), for example, stores elevation values 
(Fig. 1.5c). Cells are unlikely to have the same elevation as their neighbors, and the values range 
smoothly into one another, forming a continuous surface (or continuous field). Therefore, they are 
commonly called continuous rasters.  
 
Image rasters (Fig. 1.5d) store brightness values and are commonly used to store aerial 
photographs or satellite images. Images may contain multiple arrays of values, called bands, to 
represent each pixel. Color images often contain a red band, a green band, and a blue band for 
each pixel, and the mixture of values in each band defines the color of the pixel. One can also do 
a digital scan of a paper map and store it as a raster, such as the US Geological Survey 
topographic map shown in Figure 1.5e, known as a digital raster graphic (DRG). Each cell 
stores an index code representing a different color, such as 5 for the brown contours and 1 for the 
white background. 
A raster data set is laid out as a series of rows and columns. Each pixel has an “address” indicated 
by its position in the array, such as row = 3 and column = 6. Georeferencing a map in an x-y 
coordinate system requires four numbers: an x-y location for one pixel in the raster data set and 
the size of the pixel in the x and y directions. Usually the upper-left corner is chosen as the known 
location, and the x and y pixel dimensions are the same so that the pixels are square. From these

rasters: (a) land cover;

four numbers, it is possible to calculate the coordinates of every other pixel based on its row and 
column position. In this sense, the georeferencing of the pixels in a raster data set is implicit—one 
need not store the x-y location of every pixel.  
The x and y dimensions of each pixel define the resolution of the raster data. The higher the 
resolution, the more precisely the data can be represented. Consider the 90-meter resolution roads 
raster in Figure 1.6. Since the raster cell dimensions are 90 meters, the roads are represented as 
much wider than they actually are, and they appear blocky. A 10-meter resolution raster could 
represent the roads more accurately; however, the file size would increase by 9 × 9, or 81 times. 
The raster model mitigates some of the drawbacks of vectors. It is ideally suited to storing 
continuous information because each cell can have a value completely different from its 
neighbors. Many analyses are simple and rapid to perform, and an extensive set of analysis tools 
for rasters far outstrips those available for vectors.  
The drawbacks of rasters lie chiefly in two areas. First, they suffer from trade-offs between 
precision and storage space to a greater extent than vectors do. The second major drawback of 
rasters is that they can store only one numeric attribute per raster. Vector files can store hundreds 
of attribute values for each spatial feature and can handle text data more efficiently. 
Coordinate systems 
Both raster and vector data rely on x-y values to locate data to a particular spot on the earth’s 
surface. The x-y values of the coordinate pairs can vary, however. The choice of values and units 
to store a data set is called its coordinate system. Consider a standard topographic map, which 
actually has three different coordinate systems marked on it. The corners are marked with degrees 
of latitude and longitude, which is termed a geographic coordinate system (GCS). Another set 
of markings indicates a scale in meters representing the UTM, or Universal Transverse Mercator, 
coordinate system. A third set of markings shows a scale in feet, corresponding to a State Plane 
coordinate system. Any location on the map can be represented by three different x-y pairs 
corresponding to one of the three coordinate systems (Fig. 1.7). A global positioning system 
(GPS) unit also has this flexibility. It can be set to record a location in GCS degrees, UTM 
meters, State Plane feet, or other coordinate systems. 
When creating a vector or raster data set, one must choose a coordinate system and units for 
storing the x-y values. It is also important to label the data so that the user knows which 
coordinate system has been selected and what the units for the x-y values are. Thus, every GIS 
data set must have a label that records the type of coordinate system and units used to store the 
x-y data inside it.

the roads more precisely, but it takes 81 times as much space.

In older GIS systems, the 
coordinate systems of different data 
sets had to match in order for them 
to be drawn together in the same 
map. UTM data could only be 
shown with other UTM data, State 
Plane data with other State Plane 
data, and so on. If data were in 
different coordinate systems, they 
would need to be converted to the 
same coordinate system prior to 
display.  
Although it is still true that coordinate systems must match for data to be displayed together, 
many GIS systems can now perform the conversion on the fly. This feature allows data to be 
stored in different coordinate 
systems yet to be drawn together. In 
ArcMap, the user defines a 
coordinate system for the map, and 
all of the data are converted to 
match (Fig. 1.8). The units defined 
for the map coordinate system, 
whether they are meters, feet, or 
degrees, become the map units and 
may differ from the stored units in 
the files. In Figure 1.8, the UTM 
data use meters to store the x-y 
coordinates, the GCS data use 
degrees, and the State Plane data use 
feet. The Oregon Statewide Lambert 
coordinate system uses meters, so 
meters become the map units. 
Map scale 
The act of taking a set of GIS features with x-y coordinate values and drawing them on a screen or 
printing them on paper establishes a map scale. On a paper map, the scale is fixed at the time of 
printing. Within a computer system that allows interactive display, the scale changes every time 
the user zooms in or out of the map.  
What is map scale? 
Map scale is a measure of the size at which features in a map are represented. The scale is 
expressed as a fraction, or ratio, of the size of objects on the page to the size of the objects on the 
ground. Because it is expressed as a ratio, it is valid for any unit of measure. So for a common US 
Geological Survey topographic map, which has a scale of 1:24,000, one inch on the map represents 
24,000 inches on the ground. You can use the map scale and a ruler to determine the true distance of 
any feature on the map, such as the width of a lake (Fig. 1.9). Measure the lake with a ruler and then 
set up a proportion such that the map scale equals the measured width over the actual width (x). 
Then solve for x. Keep in mind that the actual width and the measured width will have the same 
units. You can convert these units, if necessary.

Often people or publications refer to 
large-scale maps and small-scale maps. 
A large-scale map is one in which the 
ratio is large (i.e., the denominator is 
small). Thus, a 1:24,000 scale map is 
larger scale than a 1:100,000 scale 
map. Large-scale maps show a 
relatively small area, such as a 
quadrangle, whereas small-scale maps 
show bigger areas, such as states or 
countries. 
Scales for GIS data 
When data are stored in a GIS, they technically do not 
have a scale because only the coordinates are stored. 
They acquire a scale once they are drawn on the screen 
or on paper. However, a data set has a source scale, or 
the original scale or resolution at which it was 
converted to digital form. A 1:1 million scale paper 
map that is scanned or digitized cannot be used 
effectively at larger scales. The map in Figure 1.10 
shows congressional districts in pink and the state 
outlines in thick black lines. The state boundaries are 
more angular and less detailed than the districts 
because they were digitized at a smaller scale. Thus, 
although it is possible to take small-scale data and 
zoom in to large scales, the accuracy of the data will 
suffer. The source scale of a data set is an important 
attribute and is included when documenting it.  
One should exercise caution in using data at scales very different from the original source scale. 
Zooming in may give a false impression that the data are more precise than they actually are. A 
pipeline digitized from a 1:100,000 scale map has an uncertainty of about 170 feet in its location 
due to the thickness of the line on the paper. Displaying the pipeline on a city map at 1:10,000 
might look all right, but it is likely to be many feet away from the actual location. 
From looking at Figure 1.10, one might conclude that it is desirable to always obtain and use data 
at the largest possible scale. However, large-scale data require more data points per unit area, 
increasing data storage space and slowing the drawing of layers. Every application has an optimal 
scale, and little is gained by using information at a higher scale than needed. 
Data quality 
Representing real-world objects as points, lines, polygons, or rasters always involves some degree 
of generalization, or simplifying the data for digital storage, such as turning a house into a 
rectangular polygon, or even a point. No data file can capture all the spatial or attribute qualities 
of any object. The degree of generalization varies with the map scale. On a standard topographic 
map, a river has a width and can be modeled as a polygon with two separate banks. A city would 
be shown as a polygon area. For a national map, however, the river would simply be shown as a 
line, and a city would be shown as a point.

with different source scales.

Even a detailed representation of an object is not always “true.” Rivers and lakes can enlarge in 
size during a spring flood event or shrink during a drought. The boundary of a city changes over 
time as the city grows. Users of GIS data must never forget that the data they collect and use will 
contain flaws, and that the user has an ethical and legal responsibility to ensure that the data used 
for a particular purpose are appropriate for the task. When evaluating the quality of a data set, 
geospatial professionals consider the following aspects. 
Geometric accuracy describes how close the x-y 
values of a data set correspond to the actual locations 
on the earth’s surface. Geometric accuracy is a 
function of the source scale and of how the data were 
captured. Surveying is one of the most accurate ways 
to position features. GPS units have an accuracy that 
ranges from centimeters to tens of meters. Maps 
derived from aerial photography or satellite imagery 
can vary widely in geometric quality based on factors 
such as the scale of the image, the resolution of the 
image, imperfections and distortions in the imaging 
system, and the types of corrections applied to the 
image. In Figure 1.11, notice that the vector road in 
white is offset in places from the road as it appears in 
the aerial photo. These differences can arise from 
digitizing errors, geometric distortions from the 
camera or satellite, or other factors.  
Moreover, not every boundary can be as precisely located as a road. Imagine that you wish to 
delineate the land-cover types: forest, shrubland, grassland, and bare rock in Fig. 1.11. Where 
would you draw the line between shrub and grassland? At what point does the shrubland become 
forest? Six people given this photo would come up with six slightly different maps. Some 
boundaries would match closely; others would vary as each person made a subjective decision 
about where to place each boundary. 
Thematic accuracy refers to the attributes. Some types of data are relatively straightforward to 
record, such as the name of a city or the number of lanes in a road. Even in this situation, the 
value of a feature might be incorrectly recorded. Other types of information can never be known 
exactly. Population data, for example, are collected through a process of surveying and self-
reporting that takes many months. It is impossible to include every person. Moreover, people are 
born and die during the survey process, or are moving in and out of towns. Population data can 
never be more than an estimate. It is important to understand the limitations and potential biases 
associated with thematic data. 
Resolution refers to the sampling interval at which data are acquired. Resolution may be spatial, 
thematic, or temporal. Spatial resolution indicates at what distance interval measurements are taken 
or recorded. What is the size of a single pixel of satellite data? If one is collecting GPS points by 
driving along a road, at what interval is each point collected? Thematic resolution can be impacted 
by using categories rather than measured quantities: if one is collecting information on the percent 
crown cover in a forest, is each measurement reported as a continuous value (32%) or as a classified 
range (10–20%, 20–30%)? Temporal resolution indicates how frequently measurements are taken. 
Census data are collected every 10 years. Temperature data taken at a climate station might be 
recorded every 15 minutes, but it might also be reported as a monthly or yearly average.

Precision refers to either the number of significant digits used to record a measurement or the 
statistical variation of a repeated single measurement. Many people confuse precision with 
accuracy, but it is important to understand the distinction. Imagine recording your body 
temperature with an oral digital thermometer that records to a thousandth of a degree and getting 
the value of 99.894 degrees Fahrenheit. This measurement would be considered precise. 
However, imagine that you take the reading immediately after drinking a cup of hot coffee. This 
action throws off the thermometer reading so that it does not record your true body temperature. 
Thus, the measurement is precise, but it is not accurate.  
Evaluating the quality of a data set can be difficult, especially if the data were created by 
someone else. Professionals who create data usually also provide metadata, which stores 
information about the data set, such as where it came from, how it was developed, who assembled 
it, how precise it is, and whether it can be given to another person. The user can then decide 
whether a particular data set is suitable based on the information in the metadata.  
Citing GIS data sources 
Ethical and professional considerations require that any map, publication, or report should cite the 
data source(s) used and give proper credit to the originators of the data. The metadata, or the site 
from which the data were obtained, are good sources of information for citations. The best 
practice is to record the citation when the data are obtained so the information is available when 
needed. Generally one cites only data that are publically available (free or purchased). Data 
created internally within the workplace need not be cited, although often the company name or 
logo will appear on the map. A data set provided once in response to a personal request should be 
cited as a personal communication. 
Keep in mind that the place you found the data may not always be its source. Your GIS 
administrator may have placed often-used data sets, such as ESRI Data and Maps, on a workplace 
fileserver for easy access, but the fact that they were obtained internally does not free you from 
the need to cite them, and you must cite the original source, not the local server. 
General format 
The purpose of a citation is to allow other people to find and obtain the data. It is not always 
possible to find all the information needed for a complete citation, but one should do one’s best to 
make it complete as possible. The following general format for citations may be used: 
Data set name (Year published) [source type]. Producer name, producer contact information. 
Resource URL: [Date accessed]. 
Data set name. The name is assigned by the creator or provider of the data. 
Year published. Some data sets are assembled and provided once or at long intervals, and these 
are considered to have a publication date. For example, the ESRI Data and Maps product is 
released in revised form with each version of the software and carries a publication year. Aerial 
photography is flown on a particular date (although mosaics such as Google Earth use multiple 
sources spread over several years). It may take a little hunting or a few questions to find the 
publication date. Some data sets are updated at shorter intervals, or are even live. These can be 
assigned the current year. 
Source type. Indicate the format in which the data are available. Types might include physical 
media (DVD, CD-ROM), a file downloaded from the Internet, or a service that provides live data 

Chapter 1 
18 
on demand. Different types of services exist, such as database service, map service, image 
service, map package, or layer package. New types are being added all the time. 
Producer name. Give the name of the person or agency that makes the data available. In some 
cases, this may be different from the originator of the data. For example, ESRI publishes Data 
and Maps using data from many different sources. ArcGIS Online serves public data. 
Producer contact information. For a company or small agency, the city and state should be 
included. For large agencies, particularly those with many offices but a unified web presence, the 
name itself is sufficient. Indicate a clearinghouse name, such as ArcGIS Online, if appropriate. 
Resource URL. This entry is optional; include when appropriate. Use only static URLs even if it 
means the user has to hunt for the data. (A static URL always has the same form, whereas a 
dynamic URL is generated automatically based on search strings or other information. Dynamic 
URLs generally contain gibberish and/or characters like %.) 
Date Accessed. This entry is optional because it mainly applies to online data sets. Include the 
year and month when you accessed or downloaded the data.

About ArcGIS 
ArcGIS overview 
ArcGIS is developed and sold by Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI). It has a 
long history and has been through many versions. Originally developed for large mainframe 
computers, it has metamorphosed from a system based on typed commands to a user-friendly 
graphical user interface (GUI). Data models, too, have changed over time, so that one is likely to 
encounter data sets in different formats. Knowing this background helps a student of GIS 
understand the nature of the ArcGIS system and its data. 
The old core of the ArcGIS system was called Arc/Info and included three programs: Arc, 
ArcEdit, and ArcPlot (Fig. 1.12), which utilized a data model known as a coverage and 
incorporated a database program called INFO. All of the programs were command based,

meaning that the user typed 
commands to make the 
program work. The difficulty 
of learning Arc/Info 
prompted ESRI to create 
ArcView in 1992, which was 
easier to use but not as 
powerful as Arc/Info. 
ArcView used a simpler data 
model, called the shapefile, 
although it could read 
coverages and convert them 
to shapefiles. 
ArcGIS Desktop, released in 
2001, combines power and 
ease of use. It contains two 
programs. ArcMap provides 
the means to display, analyze, 
and edit spatial data and data 
tables. ArcCatalog facilitates viewing and managing of spatial data files. ArcGIS Desktop also 
contains ArcToolbox, a collection of tools and functions for operations in ArcCatalog and 
ArcMap, such as converting between data formats, managing map projections, and performing 
analysis (Fig. 1.13). Users may create and add their own tools or scripts for special or often-used 
tasks. A program called Model Builder lets users graphically arrange and run sequences of steps, 
and save them to be used over and over. 
ArcGIS Desktop provides different levels of functionality that all 
use the same basic interface. Users can save money by buying only 
the level they need. This book primarily uses the functions 
available in ArcGIS Basic. 
¾ ArcGIS Basic (formerly ArcView) provides a suite of 
mapping, editing, and analysis functions and is the level of 
functionality most users will require on a regular basis. 
¾ ArcGIS Standard (formerly ArcEditor) adds advanced 
editing capabilities, such as topology and network editing, 
as well as additional data conversion tools. 
¾ ArcGIS Advanced (formerly ArcInfo) provides access to 
the full functionality and adds more advanced tools for 
analysis, editing, data handling, and cartography.  
ArcMap documents 
ArcMap creates map documents, a collection of spatial data layers and tables and their 
properties. The document is designed to contain a single map page, called a layout, which is used 
to design a map for printing. However, much of the time the layout is secondary, and the map 
document is used for viewing, analyzing, editing, or managing data for a project.

When a feature class or a raster is added to ArcMap, it becomes a layer. The difference between a 
feature class and a layer is important to grasp. A feature class is a stored set of spatial data. A 
layer points to a feature class and stores information about how to display it and use it 
(Fig. 1.14). A layer is like a cooking recipe—it describes where to find the data file (the 
ingredients) and how to display it (the cooking instructions). The same feature class can be 
accessed by multiple layers to present different views of the same data, even within a single map 
document (Fig. 1.14). Layers are held in memory and stored when the map document is saved. 
The information in the layer, such as which symbols should be used and whether the features 
have labels, are called the layer properties. Creating a map involves manipulating these 
properties in menus to produce the desired result. 
  
A layer may be saved as a layer file. This file stores the location of the data set upon which the 
layer is based and the properties of the layer. Saved layer files can be used to quickly add a layer 
with predefined symbols to a map document. Group layer files can be organized in multiple 
layers with predefined symbols into thematic maps or base maps. 
Map documents organize layers using data frames, 
windows that contain groups of layers that are drawn 
together (Fig. 1.15). Each data frame has its own 
properties, its own data layers, its own geographic extent, 
its own scale, even its own coordinate system. In 
Figure 1.15, the top data frame shows South Dakota with 
its highways, counties, and rivers using a State Plane 
coordinate system. The second frame, showing the 
location of South Dakota within the United States, 
contains only the states, has a much smaller scale, and 
uses the Equidistant Conic coordinate system.  
One frame at a time is designated the active frame. All 
commands and actions, such as adding layers or creating a 
scale bar, occur in the active frame. If you wished to add 
rivers to the lower data frame in Figure 1.15, first you 
would designate it as the active frame, and then you 
would add the rivers feature class to the map. 
Data files in ArcGIS 
ArcGIS can read a variety of GIS file formats (Table 1.1); some are native to ArcGIS and some 
originate from other sources.

density (top) or the vacancy

Description 
 Shapefiles 
Shapefiles are vector feature classes developed for the early 
version of ArcView and have been carried over into ArcGIS. 
 
 Coverages 
A coverage is the vector data format developed for Arc/Info 
and is the oldest of the data formats. 
Geodatabases 
Geodatabases represent an entirely new model for storing 
spatial information with additional capabilities. 
 Database connections 
Database connections permit users to log in to and utilize data 
from an RDBMS geodatabase. 
 Layer files 
A layer file references a feature class and stores information 
about its properties, such as how it should be displayed. 
 Rasters 
Rasters represent map data or imagery using arrays of regular 
cells, or pixels, containing numeric values. 
 Tables 
Tables can exist as separate data objects that are unassociated 
with a spatial data set. 
 GIS servers 
GIS servers provide GIS data over an Internet connection as 
maps, features, or images. 
 TINs 
TINs are Triangulated Irregular Networks that store 3D surface 
information, such as elevation, using a set of nodes and 
triangles. 
 CAD drawings 
Data sets created by CAD programs can be read by ArcGIS, 
although they cannot be edited or analyzed unless they are 
converted to shapefiles or geodatabases. 
Shapefiles 
Shapefiles are spaghetti data models containing a feature class composed of points, lines or 
polygons, but never a mixture. The attributes are stored in a dBase file. Shapefiles can store 
multipart features, in which a single feature includes multiple objects. For example, Hawaii 
requires multiple polygons to represent the different islands, but the state can be stored as a 
multipart feature so that it has one record in the attribute table. 
Although a shapefile appears as one icon in ArcGIS, it is 
actually composed of multiple data files as seen in 
Windows Explorer (Fig. 1.16). The rivers shapefile consists 
of seven different files. The .shp file stores coordinate data, 
the .dbf file stores attribute data, and the .shx file stores a 
spatial index that speeds drawing and analysis. These first 
three files are required for every shapefile to function. 
Additional files may also be present: the .prj file stores 
projection information, the .avl file is a stored legend, and 
the .xml file contains metadata. To copy a shapefile, all of 
these files must be included. ArcCatalog takes care of this 
automatically, but Windows Explorer does not—one reason 
it is wise to manage GIS data using ArcCatalog.

files but appear as single entries in 
ArcCatalog.

In a shapefile attribute table, the first two columns of data are reserved for storing the feature 
identification code (FID) and the coordinate geometry (Shape) field. These fields are created and 
maintained by ArcGIS and cannot be modified by the user. All other fields are added by the user. 
Geodatabases 
A geodatabase can contain many different objects, 
including feature classes, networks, tables, rasters, 
and topology. Figure 1.17 shows a geodatabase 
named oregondata. Feature classes may exist as 
individual objects in a geodatabase (as do the cities 
or counties), or they may be grouped into feature 
datasets, a collection of related feature classes with 
the same coordinate system, such as the 
Transportation feature dataset in Figure 1.17. For 
now, you can think of a feature dataset as a folder 
for organizing data, but they have additional 
capabilities that will be introduced in later 
chapters. Geodatabases can also store rasters like 
the gtopo1km raster in Figure 1.17. 
Three types of geodatabases are used by ArcGIS. Personal geodatabases are designed for use by 
individuals or small workgroups and are stored in a single Microsoft Access file. This file is 
limited to 2 GB in size and works only in the Windows operating system. File geodatabases are 
stored in a system folder, and each file can be up to 1 TB in size. File geodatabases can be 
accessed by multiple operating systems, including Linux or Unix. SDE geodatabases, also known 
as enterprise geodatabases, store GIS data within a commercial relational database management 
system (RDBMS), such as Oracle® or SQLServer®. SDE geodatabases are designed to meet 
security and management needs for large data sets accessed by many simultaneous users. In this 
book we use personal or file geodatabases. Which type is used does not usually matter. 
Coverages 
A coverage is the oldest vector format, developed for Arc/Info. ArcGIS Desktop has limited 
functions for managing coverages, so most users will encounter them simply as an old data 
format that must be converted to a shapefile or exported to a geodatabase. Several things are 
helpful to know in this process.  
Coverages contain multiple feature classes, which may 
store points, arcs, polygons, and polygon labels. 
Coverages also store topology, and the tables have 
several attribute fields reserved for this purpose. Figure 
1.18 shows these fields for a coverage called 
LANDUSE (some fields use the coverage name as part 
of the field name). It makes sense to delete these fields 
during or after the conversion, for they serve no useful 
purpose afterwards. 
Rasters 
Rasters in ArcGIS can take a variety of formats, such as 
JPEG, TIF, GEOTIF, BMP, MrSID, and raw binary 
files (BIP, BIL, and BSQ). A list of supported raster

formats can be found in the ArcMap Help under the index heading “rasters, formats.” Most 
rasters consist of the spatial data plus a header that gives information about the file, such as its 
number of rows and columns and its coordinate system. This information may be stored in a 
separate file or as the first part of the binary raster. Rasters can also be stored inside geodatabases. 
CAD files 
Data sets from CAD programs can be read by ArcGIS, although they cannot be edited or 
analyzed unless they are converted to shapefiles or geodatabases. A CAD file may contain 
multiple feature classes that correspond to layers of the drawing and can be opened separately.  
Database connections 
A user can connect to a database management system (DBMS) on a network through a database 
connection. This connection can be open, or it can require a login and password. Once inside, the 
user can access the tables within the database. Database connections may be available on a local 
network through a mounted drive, but some can be accessed online as database services. 
Internet data services 
Many organizations make data available over the Internet. Free data services, such as 
GoogleEarth and MapQuest, provide access to huge volumes of image and map data. These 
services are used online in a web interface and cannot be viewed in ArcMap. Although the data 
quality and documentation procedures are not designed for professional-level work, the volume 
and popularity of these sites introduce many people to GIS techniques and data. Other sites, such 
as the United States Geological Survey’s National Map, do allow users to download data. 
GIS servers 
GIS servers provide geospatial data over Internet connections. Hosting GIS data on a server 
requires software that responds to requests from users for specific maps or data in the user’s 
current window. Some GIS services are open and free, designed to provide public access to data 
and maps. Others may be locked down to a particular organization or group of users. Many 
organizations use servers to make in-house data available to personnel out in the field, or to allow 
employees in different locations to access the same company data sets. Servers provide data in a 
client-neutral format; as long as the client program knows how to use the service, the data can be 
used in ArcGIS Desktop, in a web application, on a tablet, or on a smartphone. 
Several types of services may be offered. A map service renders map layers as tiles and sends 
them to the user as static images. This type of service is efficient and fast, but the user cannot 
modify how the map is symbolized. A feature service shares the requested data features; it tends 
to be slower, but the user can change how the features look and potentially edit or analyze them. 
A layer package or map package sends the data to the client, where they are stored locally 
during use. An image service provides access to large mosaics of satellite imagery or aerial 
photography. GIS servers can also provide analysis tools in addition to data. A geoprocessing 
service makes available certain computations and functions, so that users can perform the 
designated analysis through a web site, even if they do not have GIS software installed.  
Cloud-based services 
Setting up and managing a GIS server is a complex and expensive task requiring suitable 
equipment, software, and expertise. Cloud-based services are lowering this barrier. A cloud 
consists of warehouses of computers and hard drives managed by a company that rents processing 
power and disk space to clients. Some companies offer space to individuals to back up their 
computers or store movies and music files in a place that is accessible to all of their devices.  

Chapter 1 
24 
Another type of cloud service is the virtual machine, or VM, created by setting aside part of a 
large computer with its own operating system and software, allowing it to be managed and used 
like an ordinary physical computer. The VM can be scaled from a standard desktop to a powerful 
machine capable of running intensive computations or serving thousands of web requests. The 
client rents the VM for an hourly fee. In web applications, cloud services can be configured to 
automatically add more VM units when demand is high and scale back when usage is light. 
Many organizations have moved to the cloud to host their GIS data, either as a complement to or 
even instead of housing their own GIS servers. Advantages of cloud services include the speed 
and ease of deployment, the ability to scale up and down to meet changing demand, and the 
security benefits of hosting public information outside the organizational firewall. 
ArcGIS Online and web maps 
ArcGIS Online is a cloud-based platform that provides an environment to create and share maps. 
It makes data available to people with little to no GIS training, yet it also addresses the needs of 
professional users. Anyone may use the data, and those willing to set up a free account may also 
share data. The user controls whether a published data set is visible to a few selected people or to 
the public. The platform contains easy tools for creating web pages with interactive maps.  
Organizations may purchase a subscription account, which allows them to access additional data 
sets, manage security, designate users allowed to access or publish data, and host data in the 
cloud without needing to configure their own GIS servers. A member of an organizational 
subscription has access to many data sets, geoprocessing services, geocoding services, and 
groups, provided the system administrator has assigned those permissions to the account. 
ArcGIS Online is designed around the web map, an interactive map based solely on GIS 
services. Web maps perform a restricted set of basic functions, such as zoom and query; however, 
they are device independent and can be used in ArcMap, in web browsers, on mobile devices like 
smartphones or tablets, and even within social media sites. They are simple to create and share. 
Using servers and web maps to collect data on smartphones or tablets has become a widespread 
activity. It is relatively simple to set up a feature service and configure it for editing. Users with a 
free account can used the ArcGIS mobile application to access web maps and collect data; some 
students at the South Dakota School of Mines and 
Technology used it to map trees on campus and rate 
damage caused by a blizzard (Fig. 1.19). Users with 
a subscription account can use the more powerful 
Collector application, which is capable of attaching 
photos and editing while out of the range of cell or 
wireless services.  
The growing capabilities of ArcGIS Online are 
turning it into an indispensable tool. ArcGIS Desktop 
will remain the primary engine for creating, mapping 
and analyzing data for quite some time yet, as it is 
far more powerful than the web services, but 
Desktop users certainly benefit from web services.

GIS Data 
25 
Summary 
¾A GIS is a database system that uses both spatial and attribute data to answer questions about 
where things are and how they are related. It has many functions, including creating data, 
making maps, and analyzing relationships. 
¾Raster data employ arrays of values representing conditions on the ground within a square 
called a pixel. The array is georeferenced to a ground location using a single x-y point. 
¾Vector data use sequences of x-y coordinates to store discrete point, line, or polygon features. 
Every feature is linked to an attribute table containing information about the feature. 
¾Every GIS data set has a coordinate system defined for stored x-y coordinate values. Many 
different coordinate systems are used, so each data set must be labeled with information about 
the coordinate system. 
¾Map scale is the ratio of the size of objects in the map to their size on the ground. The source 
scale affects the accuracy and precision of GIS data and for what scales it is suitable. 
¾Every GIS user has a responsibility to ensure that data are suitable for the proposed application. 
Data quality is measured in terms of geometric accuracy, thematic accuracy, resolution, and 
precision. Metadata store information about GIS data layers to help people use them properly. 
¾ArcGIS Desktop employs a menu-based interface for two programs called ArcMap and 
ArcCatalog. It uses many data formats, including shapefiles, coverages, geodatabases, rasters, 
images, TINs, CAD drawings, and Internet-based data services. 
¾ArcMap uses layers and layer properties to manipulate data in a map. Layers point to stored 
data sets and contain properties that indicate how they should be displayed. 
¾GIS services make data available over the Internet and are becoming an increasingly 
important part of GIS.

Chapter Review Questions 
  1. Explain the difference among the terms feature, feature class, and feature dataset. 
  2. Imagine you are looking at a geodatabase that contains 50 states, 500 cities, and 100 rivers. 
How many feature classes are there? How many features? How many attribute tables? How 
many total records in all the attribute tables?  
  3. If the following data were stored as rasters, which ones would be discrete and which would be 
continuous: rainfall, soil type, voting districts, temperature, slope, and vegetation type? 
  4. John and Mary are collecting GPS data together. John’s GPS says their location is at (631058, 
4885805). Mary’s GPS says their location is at (1204817, 663391). Explain what is going on. 
What must be done to make the GPS units agree? 
  5. Would raster or vector be a better format for storing land ownership parcels? Give at least 
three reasons for your choice.  
  6. You measure a football field (100 yards long) on a large-scale map and find that it is 0.5 inch 
long. What is the scale of the map? 
  7. Scott is walking the boundary of a wetland area to map it. His expensive GPS records 
locations to the nearest 0.10 meter. Is the boundary he creates accurate? Is it precise? Explain 
your reasoning. 
  8. Imagine a feature class of agricultural fields with attributes for the crop and the organic matter 
content of the soil. What issues might impact the thematic accuracy of each attribute? 
  9. Explain some ways that GIS services are different from data that reside on your hard drive.

Mastering the Skills 
Preparing to begin 
The tutorials in this book use a data set available for download from the book web site at 
www.mhhe.com/price7e. These data must be installed before you start using the tutorials. Each 
step of the tutorials and all skills learned in this book are illustrated by video clips which can also 
be found on the web site. See the web site for instructions on downloading and using the tutorial 
data and videos. 
As you are working through the tutorials, you will learn better if you think carefully about each 
step. Be sure to follow the directions exactly, or you may find that subsequent steps look or 
behave differently than the book’s instructions. 
A TIP gives useful information about the program or settings that will save time or that are 
important to know. Pay attention to them. 
A SKILL TIP tells about a technique that is not covered in a tutorial but that you may wish to 
learn about later using the Skills Reference at the back of the book. The section of the Skills 
Reference to consult is indicated in parentheses (ArcMap Basics). 
TIP: In these tutorials, values you must enter are shown in this font: type this.  
Teaching Tutorial  
The following examples provide step-by-step instructions for doing basic tasks and solving basic 
problems in ArcGIS. The steps you need to do are highlighted with an arrow Î; follow them 
carefully. Click on the video number in the Video Index to view a demonstration of the steps. 
TIP: This book comes with a folder of data called mgisdata. We suggest that you install it on the 
C:\ drive of your computer in a folder named C:\gisclass. If you installed it elsewhere, move it 
now. If you cannot put it there, for some reason, then write down where it is installed and 
substitute that location in the instructions: __________________________________ 
Adding data to ArcMap 
  1Î Start ArcMap.  
  1Î In the Getting Started window, click the New Maps text on the left side of the 
window, indicating that you want to start with a new, empty map document. 
  1Î Click on the Blank Map template icon, and click OK. 
TIP: If using ArcGIS on a network, you may see a different configuration of toolbars. Choose 
Customize > Toolbars from the main menu, and you will see a list. Only these toolbars should be 
checked: Draw, Standard, and Tools. If you see others checked, click the names to turn them off.  
  2Î Click the Add Data button. 
  2Î Click on the Look in drop-down button to show available data folders (Fig. 1.20).

ArcGIS is able to work with many kinds of data, 
including files on your hard drive as well as online 
data. Data on your local computer, or on a network 
drive mounted on your computer, will be shown in 
Folder Connections, which stores shortcuts to 
locations containing GIS data. 
  2Î Click the Look in drop-down button 
again, if necessary, and select Folder 
Connections.  
If this is the first time ArcGIS has been used on the 
computer, this folder will be empty. Otherwise, it 
may contain connections, which will appear as folder 
entries (Fig. 1.21a). You must add a connection to 
your mgisdata folder to start using the data. 
  2Î To add a connection, click the Connect to Folder button in the Add Data window. 
  2Î Navigate to the directory containing your mgisdata folder and click once on the 
mgisdata folder icon to select it (Fig. 1.21b; yours may be in a different location). Do 
not select any of the subfolders in the mgisdata folder. (You are adding a connection 
right now; you will access the data in a moment.) 
  2Î Click OK to finish adding the connection.  
TIP: Once you add a connection it will remain until you 
disconnect it. Connections tend to build up over time, so 
disconnect older ones no longer in use. 
Now that the connection is added, you are ready to start 
adding data to the map. 
  3Î Click the Look in drop-down button one 
more time to find the connection you added. 
Click on it to open it. 
  3Î Double-click the Oregon folder to open it. 
  3Î Double-click the gray oregondata icon to 
open the geodatabase. 
  3Î Click the counties feature class to highlight 
it; then click Add to add it to the map. 
 
  4Î Click the Add Data button again. This 
time, double-click the Transportation feature 
dataset to open it.  
  4Î Click the airports feature class; then hold 
down the Ctrl-key and click on the highways 
feature class so that both are selected. Click 
Add to add them.

Viewing the map 
Examine the ArcMap window. The area on the left is called the Table of 
Contents. Examine the icons that appear directly below the Table of 
Contents title. These icons control the appearance of the Table of 
Contents and how it arranges the layers. The first icon, List by Drawing 
Order, is currently highlighted.  
  5Î Hover the cursor above the highlighted icon to see the icon name. 
  5Î Examine the names of the other icons as well. 
  5Î You may click on the other options to see what they look like, if you wish, but 
make sure afterward that the first icon is again highlighted. 
The List by Drawing Order icon shows the layers in the order in which they are drawn, from 
bottom to top. Notice that the point and line layers that you just added were on top of the polygon 
layer. The draw order can be changed if needed. 
  6Î Click the counties layer name and drag it to the top of the list. Note that the other 
layers disappear from the map, as the polygons are drawn on top of them now. 
  6Î Move the counties layer back down to the bottom of the list. 
  6Î Place the airports above the highways, if they are not already there. 
The three feature classes you added were placed underneath a heading called Layers. The Layers 
entry is a data frame, which is a box to contain map data to be displayed together. 
We will begin by exploring the Tools toolbar. Figure 1.22 
shows the tools used for zooming and panning the map. 
  7Î Click the Zoom In tool. Place the cursor at 
the upper-left corner of the state, then click 
and hold the mouse button down to drag a box 
around a few counties. When finished, let go 
of the mouse button. 
  7Î Click once in the lower-right corner of the map to zoom in again. 
  7Î To return to the full extent of the map (useful if you made a mistake or do not like 
the area you selected), click on the Full Extent button. 
  7Î Click on the Zoom Out tool and click in the upper-left corner of the state again. The 
view zooms out with the point clicked at the center.  
TIP: You can also draw a box using the Zoom Out tool. If a large box is drawn, the view zooms 
out a little bit. If a small box is drawn, the view zooms out a large amount. 
  8Î Click the Pan tool; then click and drag inside the display window to move the map. 
  8Î Click the Go Back to Previous Extent button. It allows you to undo a zoom that you 
did not intend, or return to an earlier zoom level.  
  8Î Click the Go to Next Extent button. It reverses the effect of the Go Back button. 
  8Î Click the Full Extent button to return to the view of all the counties.

TIP: Hover the cursor over a tool for a moment to find out the tool name and what it does. 
  9Î Find the scale readout on the main toolbar and click the drop-down 
arrow to see a list of preset scales. Choose 1:3,000,000. 
  9Î Click on the Fixed Zoom In button two or three times. It zooms in to the next preset 
scale in the list. 
  9Î Click on the Fixed Zoom Out button two or three times. It zooms to the next scale. 
  9Î Practice these tools until you are familiar with them. When finished, click the Full 
Extent button to return to the full extent of the Oregon data.  
TIP: Use the Bookmarks menu to set and manage bookmarks to areas of interest. 
The Identify tool can be used to examine the attributes of a feature. 
10Î Locate the Identify tool on the Tools toolbar and click on it. 
10Î Place the tool on top of one of the counties, staying away from an airport or a 
highway, and click on it. 
10Î The county will flash on the screen, and the Identify Results box will appear. The 
attributes of the county, from the counties table, are displayed in the Identify window. 
10Î Use the scroll bar to examine the attributes in the Identify window. 
10Î Click another county and examine its attributes. 
1. What is the name of the county in the northeast corner of Oregon? ___________________ 
11Î Click on a highway or airport to examine its attributes. 
11Î In the Identify window, examine the entries in the Identify from drop-down box. 
You can use these to control which layer or layers will be identified. 
11Î Close the Identify window by clicking the X in the upper-right corner. 
SKILL TIP: Learn to use the Measure tool to determine areas, lengths, and perimeters in an 
assortment of different units (ArcMap Basics). 
Viewing attribute tables 
To view the attributes for all of the features in a feature class, you can open the table. 
12Î Right-click the counties layer in the Table of Contents and choose Open Attribute 
Table from the context menu that appears.  
12Î Scroll to the right, to the end of the table and back, noting all of the fields.  
2. How many records (rows) are in this table? _____________________ 
12Î Hold the cursor over the right edge of the NAME field until it turns into a 
double arrow bar. Click and drag the edge to increase or reduce the width of 
the column. 

GIS Data 
31 
Tables have an options button with various tasks, such as finding text or exporting the table.  
13Î Click the Table Options button and choose Find and Replace. Click the Find tab. 
13Î Type Hood in the Find what box and click Find Next. 
13Î The cursor jumps to the record for Hood River and outlines the data cell. 
13Î Examine the other Find options and then close the Find and Replace window. 
A context menu gives access to several commands relating to the individual fields. 
14Î Right-click the field name POP2000 to display a context menu. Choose Sort 
Descending. (Make sure you scroll back to the top of the table to see the most 
populous county, Multnomah.) 
3. Which county has the smallest 2000 population? __________________ 
14Î Right-click the POP2000 field and choose Statistics to see basic statistics and a 
frequency diagram of the values. Close the Statistics window when done looking. 
14Î Right-click the NAME field and choose Freeze/Unfreeze Column. Scroll to the 
right, noting that the NAME field stays put now.  
TIP: More than one field can be frozen at a time. Unfreezing allows the field to scroll again, 
although it remains on the left side until the field settings are reset. 
TIP: You can sort, freeze, and do statistics without changing the source data. 
A table query is used to select features meeting a certain criterion. For example, how many 
counties have more than 100,000 people? 
15Î Click the Select By Attributes button on the Table toolbar to open the Select By 
Attributes window. 
15Î The top panel contains names of fields from the feature class table. Double-click 
the POP2000 field in the upper panel to enter it in the lower panel. 
15Î Click the > button and then type the value 100000. 
15Î The lower panel should now read POP2000 > 100000. Click Apply. 
 
16Î The selected features are highlighted in the table and on the map. Examine the 
bottom of the table to see how many were selected (you should see nine). 
16Î Click the Clear Selection button on the Table menu. 
16Î Close the counties table by clicking the X in the upper-right corner. 
Choosing map symbols 
Feature classes contain only locations and attributes and do not store symbols or labels. When 
a feature class is loaded into ArcMap, it becomes a layer. A layer is a specification for how 
the feature class will look and behave in the map document, and you can set properties to control it. 
17Î Click the Add Data button. You last added data from the Transportation feature 
dataset, so click the Up arrow once to return to the main geodatabase.

17Î Click the volcanoes feature class to select it and click Add. 
17Î Right-click the volcanoes layer to make the context menu appear—it contains 
actions or commands that can be performed on the layer. 
17Î Move the cursor to the Properties entry at the bottom of the menu, and click it to 
open the Layer Properties window. 
The tabs at the top of the window provide access to menus for setting various properties. 
18Î Click on the Symbology tab. 
18Î Click on the Symbol button that shows the current symbol. It opens the Symbol 
Selector window. 
18Î Click on the Triangle 1 symbol to use it. Change the color to a reddish-brown and 
the size to 16. Click OK and then OK again in the Layer Properties window. 
TIP: Clicking Apply in a window applies any changes you have made but keeps the window 
open. Clicking OK applies the change and closes the window. 
19Î Right-click the airports layer and choose Properties. 
19Î Click on the current Symbol button to open the Symbol Selector. 
19Î Scroll down and find the Airplane symbol. Select it. 
19Î Leave the color black, but increase the size to 25 pt, and set the angle to –45. 
19Î Click OK and OK to close both windows. 
SKILL TIP: Learn how to search for and add more symbols to a map than are listed in the 
Symbol Selector by default (Maps and Symbols). 
You don’t have to open the Properties to change the symbols for a layer, however. 
20Î Right-click the highways layer symbol (not the text) to bring up a color context 
menu. Choose the black color.  
20Î Click (left-click) on the counties symbol (not the text) to open the Symbol Selector, 
and choose the Beige symbol.  
20Î Click the Outline Color drop-down button and hold the cursor on top of a color box 
until the color name appears. Set the color to the Gray 20% symbol. Click OK. 
SKILL TIP: Use the Symbol Editor to create and manage new symbols (Maps and Symbols). 
Labels are another property of a layer. You can create a set of labels and turn them on or off as 
you wish. 
21Î Right-click the airports layer and open its properties. Click on the Labels tab.  
21Î Check the box to Label features in this layer. 
21Î The Label Field is preset to NAME, but it could be changed to something else if 
desired. 
21Î Change the symbol to Arial 9pt Bold font. 
21Î Ignore the other options and click OK. The map should look similar to Figure 1.23.

It is a good practice to save the map periodically as you 
work, in case the program crashes. Always be aware of 
where you save things, so you can find them again, and 
give them logical names that express what the file contains. 
22Î Choose File > Save As from the main menu. 
22Î Navigate to the mgisdata\MapDocuments 
folder, if necessary. 
22Î Enter the name Oregonmap and save the 
map document. 
Layer files 
Imagine that you will create a series of maps and want airports on all of them. The symbols and 
labels you just set will appear only in this map. Instead of setting them again each time, you can 
save these settings as a layer file. A layer file stores the location and properties used by the layer. 
23Î Right-click the airports layer name and choose Save As Layer File. 
23Î Navigate to the mgisdata\Oregon folder. 
23Î Enter myairports.lyr as the name of the layer file and click Save. 
Nothing obvious happens, but the layer file has been stored on disk, ready for the next time you 
want the airports symbolized this way on a map. What is the difference between this saved layer 
file and the original data set? Let’s find out. 
TIP: Removing a layer only takes it out of the map. It does not delete it from the hard drive. 
24Î Right-click the airports layer and choose Remove. 
24Î Click the Add Data button. Navigate inside the Transportation feature dataset and 
choose airports again to add it to the map. 
The airplane symbol and labels are gone. You have loaded the original feature class. There are no 
instructions for how to display it, so the layer has a default symbol and no labels. 
25Î Click the Add Data button. Navigate to the Oregon folder where you saved the 
layer file myairports.lyr. Select it and add it to the map.  
25Î Right-click the second airports layer (that has the airplane symbol) and choose 
Properties. Click the Source tab. 
25Î Examine the Data Source box. This layer, although saved in the Oregon folder, is 
accessing the feature class from the original geodatabase. 
25Î Click Cancel to close the Layer Properties window. 
Both of these airports layers use the same feature class. When you saved the layer file, it only 
stored the location and the display properties, not a copy of the original data. 
Now let’s examine some of other properties besides symbols and labels that can be set for layers. 
Instead of starting from scratch, we will examine properties already set and stored in a group 
layer file, which is similar to a layer file but contains properties for multiple layers.

SKILL TIP: Learn to create group layers and store them as group layer files (BASICS: General). 
26Î Click the Save button to save the current map document. 
26Î Click the New Map File button on the main toolbar to open a new map document.  
26Î Scroll down and select the Letter (ANSI A) Portrait template and click OK. 
26Î Click on the small Data View button in the lower left map frame (see Fig. 1.25).  
26Î Click the Add Data button. Navigate to the mgisdata\Usa folder.  
26Î Click on the US Example layer file and choose Add.  
Although only the states show in the 
map window, many layers are listed in 
the Table of Contents. The check boxes 
for these layers are gray and cannot be 
turned on or off. The creator of the 
layer file applied a scale range to these 
layers, defining a specific range of 
scales at which they appear and making 
sure that they appear only when 
appropriate.  
27Î Click the Zoom In tool 
and zoom in to the western 
conterminous United States. 
State capitals and rivers should appear (if they do not, zoom in more). 
27Î Right-click the Capitals layer and choose Properties. Click the General tab. 
27Î Examine the Scale Range property (Fig. 1.24). Capitals will be shown only when 
the user has zoomed in below a scale of 1:40 million. Click Cancel. 
 
28Î Locate the Map Scale box on the main toolbar, indicating the current map scale. 
28Î Click in the Map Scale box and type 40,000,000 (with or without the commas). 
Click Enter. The map zooms to that scale. 
28Î Click the Fixed Zoom Out button. The capitals and rivers disappear. 
28Î Click the Fixed Zoom In button once. They appear again. 
28Î Click the Fixed Zoom In button a few more times until the labels for the capitals 
appear. Labels can have a different scale range than the features they represent. 
 
29Î Click the Fixed Zoom In button until the interstates and the river labels appear. 
29Î Zoom in until the counties appear, symbolized by Native American population. 
29Î Place the cursor on top of a county and wait. A small label pops up to show the 
county name. These labels are called MapTips. 
MapTips are another property of a layer. They can be set to show the contents of a specified field 
when the cursor is on top of the feature. 
TIP: Double-clicking a layer’s name also opens its Properties. 
Fig. 1.24. The scale range property sets the scales at 
which a layer will be displayed.

35 
30Î Double-click the Counties layer to open its properties and click the Display tab. 
30Î Examine the settings on this tab. Find the Show MapTips check box. 
4. What is the name of the field that is being displayed in the MapTips? ________________ 
30Î Click the Symbology tab for the Counties layer properties. 
30Î Instead of a single symbol, this layer is set to display the percentage of Native 
Americans in the counties. Examine the settings but don’t change anything. 
30Î Click Cancel to close the Properties window. 
30Î Use File > Save As to save the map document in the MapDocuments folder, naming 
it USFrames.mxd. 
Working with data frames 
Now we will learn to manage data frames. Our goal is to create a map layout with two different 
maps, one of the United States and one of the world.  
The map window has two view modes. In Data view, the user works with a single data frame. 
The Layout view shows how the map document will look when printed, including titles, scale 
bars, and so on. You are currently in Data View. 
31Î Click the Layout View icon in the lower left of the 
display area to switch to Layout view (Fig. 1.25).  
31Î Click the Select Elements tool on the Tools toolbar 
or the Draw toolbar. This tool is used to select and 
work with graphic elements, such as text or data 
frames. 
31Î Click inside the map frame. Blue square handles 
appear on the border of the data frame, indicating that 
the frame is selected by the Select Elements tool. 
31Î Place the cursor on top of the middle lower blue handle, and click and drag it to size 
the data frame to occupy the top half of the page.  
 
32Î In the Table of Contents, click twice slowly on 
the Layers name to edit it. 
32Î Type United States for the name of the data 
frame and press Enter.  
 
33Î Choose Insert > Data Frame from the main 
menu bar. 
33Î When the new data frame appears, click inside 
it and drag it below the original data frame. Use 
the handles to adjust its size and shape until the 
layout page looks similar to Figure 1.26. 
33Î Click twice slowly on the New Data Frame 
name in the Table of Contents, and change it 
to World.

A map may have many data frames, but one is always the active frame, indicated by boldface 
type in the Table of Contents. Data View shows the active frame. Data added to the map are 
placed in the active frame. 
34Î Make sure that the World data frame is the active frame (its name is in boldface type). 
34Î Click the Add Data button. Navigate to the mgisdata\World  
folder and add the country shapefile. It appears in the World data frame.  
The United States data frame is currently zoomed in further than we would like. To change the 
scale/extent of the map within a data frame, activate the data frame and use the zoom/pan tools. 
35Î Right-click on the United States data frame name in the Table 
of Contents and choose Activate from the context menu.  
35Î Click the Full Extent button to view the entire feature class. 
35Î Click the Zoom In tool and carefully draw a rectangle around 
the lower 48 states to fit it into the data frame.  
 
36Î Click the Data View button in the lower-left corner of the map 
window to return to Data view. You should now see the United 
States map. 
36Î Right-click the World data frame in the Table of Contents and choose Activate. The 
view changes to the World data frame. 
36Î Click the Layout view button to return to the map layout page. 
Data frame coordinate systems 
A data frame has a coordinate system (CS), which defaults to the first layer added to the frame. 
37Î Double-click the World data frame name in the Table of Contents to open its 
properties. 
37Î Click on the Coordinate System tab and examine the coordinate system. Write its 
name and units (angular unit) and then close the window. 
_____________________________________________ Units_____________ 
 
37Î Examine the coordinate system of the United States data frame. Write its name and 
units (linear unit) and then close the window. 
________________________________________ Units______________ 
The data frame coordinate system can be set to any CS desired, and will display all data sets 
added to the frame in that CS. 
TIP: A plus sign by a folder expands its contents. A minus sign 
closes the contents. Use them to open or close folders as needed. 
38Î Open the properties for the World data frame and view 
the Coordinate System tab. 
38Î Expand the Projected Coordinate Systems folder and then the World folder. 

GIS Data 
37 
38Î Find the WGS 1984 Web Mercator (auxiliary sphere) coordinate system, which is 
used by ArcGIS Online. Click to highlight it. 
38Î Examine the coordinate system. What are its units? _____________  
Notice that this coordinate system has both a projection (Mercator Auxiliary Sphere, in this case) 
and a geographic coordinate system, or datum (GCS_WGS_1984). Both items are part of the 
coordinate system name, WGS_1984_Web_Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere.  
38Î Click OK to accept the new coordinate system. 
38Î Use the Pan tool to adjust the position of the world map in the data frame. 
 
39Î Open Help > ArcGIS Desktop Help from the main menu bar. 
39Î Click the Search tab and enter Mercator. 
39Î Click the Mercator entry that it finds and read about the Mercator projection. 
39Î Click on the Contents tab in the Help, then click Locate topic in the Mercator entry. 
Use this to find where in the Help things are located. Here we see an entire “book” 
about map projections. 
39Î Close the Help window (or minimize it for use later). 
TIP: You can reinforce concepts and learn new things by reading Help. An amazing amount of 
information is available, equivalent to many books. Make it a habit! 
A data frame projects all its layers on the fly, so all layers in a data frame are not necessarily in 
the same coordinate system. 
40Î Open the properties for the United States data frame and view the Coordinate 
System tab. 
40Î Scroll to the bottom of the coordinate system folder tree and find the Layers folder. 
40Î Click the plus sign to expand the Layers folder and again to expand its subentries. 
This Layers folder is a useful way to see what coordinate systems are present in a data frame. In 
this frame, the Oregon Highways layer is in a coordinate system called Oregon Statewide 
Lambert. All other layers are in North America Equidistant Conic. 
40Î Click on the Oregon Statewide Lambert coordinate system and click Apply. Move 
the window aside, if necessary, to see the map. 
Oregon Statewide Lambert is, as the name implies, optimized for Oregon, so the United States is 
rotated inappropriately. If you see a rotation like this, check the data frame coordinate system and 
make sure it is set to a more suitable choice. 
41Î Click on the North America Equidistant Conic entry and click Apply to set it to the 
previous option. 
Let’s look at a couple more coordinate systems. 
41Î Scroll up on the Coordinate System tab and find the Geographic Coordinate 
Systems folder. 

Chapter 1 
38 
41Î Expand Geographic Coordinate Systems > North America and select the NAD 1983 
entry (the simple one in a group is usually the right choice).  
41Î The Current coordinate system name in the lower box changes to GCS_North 
_American_1983. Click Apply. 
The shapes of the map features change, stretching in the east-west direction. North-south lines 
that were previously angled become vertical. Changing coordinate systems can dramatically 
affect the appearance of a map. 
41Î Still on the Coordinate System tab, expand the Projected Coordinate Systems 
folder and navigate to the Continental > North America > USA Contiguous Albers 
Equal Area Conic coordinate system. Select it and click OK. 
The map changes again. Every coordinate system causes distortion of areas, distances, shapes, or 
angles. Each one is designed to minimize or eliminate different kinds of distortion, and the name 
often gives a hint. An equidistant coordinate system displays accurate distances. An equal area 
coordinate system displays accurate areas. The best one to use depends on the purpose of the 
map, which is why data are stored and used in many coordinate systems instead of just one. 
TIP: Changing the coordinate system of the data frame only changes the map display. It does not 
affect the coordinate systems used to store the feature classes. 
Using Internet map services 
Your hard drive or office network drive is not the only source of GIS data. Many organizations 
host services that provide maps, imagery, and data, and individuals can share content on the 
ArcGIS Online platform. 
42Î Open the Help window and click the Search tab. 
42Î Type ArcGIS Online into the box at the top and click Ask. 
42Î Click on Adding data from ArcGIS Online and read through the entry. 
42Î Close ArcGIS Help. 
TIP: Use the Search function in Help during a tutorial whenever you’d like to learn more about a 
tool or concept. Your GIS knowledge and skills will improve dramatically. 
Now let’s explore ArcGIS Online. You need a high-speed Internet connection for the next steps. 
If you are not connected, you may end the tutorial here. 
43Î Save your current map. 
43Î Click the New Map File button on the main toolbar and 
start with a Blank Map.  
43Î Click the Data View button (lower-left corner of map window). 
43Î Click the Add Data drop-down triangle and choose Add Basemap.  
43Î Select the Streets basemap and click Add. 

GIS Data 
39 
TIP: If ArcMap crashes when you try to load a basemap, start ArcMap again. Go to Customize > 
ArcMap Options and click the Data View tab. Uncheck the box to Enable hardware acceleration. 
44Î Zoom to your home state and then to your home town. 
44Î Zoom to your home neighborhood and find your street. 
TIP: Be patient when using Internet services because they can take time to draw. Sometimes they 
may not be available. If this one does not work, try another, or try again later. 
Notice that the map becomes more detailed as you zoom in; map services generally employ scale 
ranges to show more detailed layers at larger scales. The basemap is only the beginning. Many 
agencies and individuals provide map data for others to use. 
44Î Zoom back out so that the conterminous United States is being shown. 
 
45Î Click the Add Data drop-down again and choose Add Data from ArcGIS Online. 
45Î Type weather in the search box and click the Search button. Examine the results.  
45Î Examine the US Weather Warnings service, which should be near the top. 
45Î Click on the Details link and review the information.  
5. Which agency provides the data for this service? ________________________________ 
Which agency hosts the GIS server that provides this service? _______________________ 
45Î Click the Add link to add the service to your map.  
45Î Examine the map to find where weather warnings have been issued today. 
This map service is continually updated as new information is posted by the National Weather 
Service. You do not have as much control of a map service as your own layers, but a few display 
options can be set. 
46Î Right-click the US Weather Warnings group layer name and choose Properties. 
46Î Examine the Source tab. Note the service URL and the coordinate system. 
46Î Click the Advanced tab. 
46Î Move the Layer Transparency slider to about 50% and click OK. 
Now you can see the underlying base map showing through the warnings.  
47Î Click the Identify tool and click on one of the warning polygons. 
47Î Examine the attributes of several polygons and then close the Identify window. 
47Î Expand the US Weather Warnings group subheadings in the Table of Contents to 
see legend information. 
Remember the Oregon airports layer file that you created earlier? Let’s add it to this map to see if 
any airports are in a hazard area. 
48Î Click the Add Data button and navigate to the mgisdata/Oregon folder. 
48Î Select the myairports.lyr layer file and click Add. 

Chapter 1 
40 
48Î A warning message about the geographic coordinate system may appear. If it does, 
check the box Don’t warn me again in this session and click Yes. We will learn more 
about this warning later. 
48Î Right-click the airports layer and choose Zoom to Layer. 
 
49Î Right-click the airports layer and choose Remove. 
49Î Zoom in to your home state again. 
49Î Double-click the Layers data frame name to open its properties and examine the 
coordinate system. 
The data frame defaults to the coordinate system of the first layer added, in this case, the base 
map, which uses WGS 1984 Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere. Changing the coordinate system 
works with ArcGIS Online data also (although it may slow drawing time a bit). 
50Î Scroll and collapse folders, if necessary, to find the Projected Coordinate Systems 
> State Plane > NAD 1983 (Meters) folder and look inside it. 
50Î Choose a coordinate system for your state. In many cases there will be more than 
one (for example, Maine East and Maine West). Pick the one that best represents the 
part of the state containing your home town. Click OK. 
50Î The map will redraw to a less distorted view of the state. 
TIP: NAD 1983 stands for North American Datum of 1983. A datum is a correction to the 
coordinate system to make it more accurate. Chapter 3 has more information on datums. 
51Î Click the Add Data drop-down button and choose Add Data from ArcGIS Online. 
51Î Enter your home state’s name in the Search box and search for data. 
51Î Select an interesting map service or layer package and add it to the map.  
TIP: Many ArcGIS Online data sets are contributed by ordinary folks, and not all of them work 
well. If you have trouble getting one to display, remove it and try another.  
Let’s view some imagery now. We will open a new map so that the data frame defaults to the 
coordinate system of the service and does not spend time trying to project the images on the fly. 
52Î Open a new, blank map. You don’t need to save the current one. 
52Î Choose Add Data > Add Data from ArcGIS Online. 
52Î Type the term imagery in the search box. 
52Î Examine the details of the World Imagery map service; then add it to the map. 
 
53Î Click the Find button on the Tools toolbar.  
53Î Click the Locations tab. 
53Î Choose the World Geocode Service (ArcGIS Online) locator. 

GIS Data 
41 
A locator is an example of a geoprocessing service. When you click Find, the string is sent to the 
server, which parses it, finds the location by comparing the string to GIS data located on the 
server, and sends the location back to you. The work is done by the server, not by your computer. 
54Î Type New York City in the Single Line Input box and click Find. 
54Î Right-click the first New York City entry in the bottom of the window and choose  
Zoom To. Move the Find window out of the way but leave it open. 
54Î Set the scale in the Map Scale box to 1:100,000. 
54Î Zoom in more to see greater detail. 
54Î Choose Bookmarks > Create Bookmark and type New York for the name. 
This map service uses a variety of imagery depending on what is available. The resolution in New 
York City is sub-meter, but it will not be that good everywhere. Let’s try locating an address 
instead of a place name. 
55Î Type your full home address in the Single Line Input box, including city and state 
(or equivalent). 
55Î If it finds it, right-click it and choose Zoom To. Right-click again and choose Add 
Point. How well did the service do at finding your house? 
 
56Î Create a bookmark for your house. 
56Î Choose Bookmarks > New York to return to New York City. 
56Î Close the Find window. 
The beauty of GIS servers is that you have access to terabytes of data without having to store 
them, update them, or download more than the portion you need. The disadvantages are that you 
must be online, and you may not have access to features or be able to modify the symbols. 
TIP: Using the Sign in link when searching for data in ArcGIS Online will give you access to 
more data, especially if your account is part of an organizational subscription. Ask your instructor 
about how to create or access an account. 
This is the end of the tutorial.

GIS Concepts 
Characteristics of GIS data 
Data files stored for use in a GIS differ in many ways from data used in other applications, such 
as word processing, spreadsheets, videos, or music. In order to use and manage GIS data 
effectively, you must understand some important characteristics. 
GIS data files may be very large. Some data sets, for example a parcel feature class for a large 
city, can have hundreds of thousands of features and records. Images and rasters especially can 
run to hundreds of megabytes or several gigabytes. 
GIS data are often shared by multiple users. Many data sets are collected and used across 
organizations rather than belonging to one individual. A parcel database must be accessed by 
many clerks and several city departments. Giving each a copy of the data causes problems. First, 
it wastes space. Second, and more important, such databases are frequently updated. Ensuring 
that every person has the most recent copy is a difficult task. Thus, many GIS data sets are 
intended to be shared; one copy is maintained on a central drive or server and everyone uses it. 
GIS data may come from many sources, yet must work together. GIS data may come from 
satellites, GPS units, scanners, paper maps, tables, and other sources. They can use different 
coordinate systems and projections and file types. GIS requires ways to label and keep track of 
how files are stored and which coordinate systems are used. Some GIS systems rely on the user to 
keep track of everything, but more commonly today, GIS applications use headers or other label 
files to keep track of data set characteristics and handle the files correctly. Users need to make 
sure that this additional data information is present and correct. 
GIS data include local files and Internet services. Most people work with data sets that reside on 
the computer being used. If PDF is found on the Internet, the user is likely to make a copy of it on 
the computer for later use. Many GIS data sets work this way also, but GIS data services are 
becoming more prevalent. A GIS service, such as ArcGIS Online or Google Maps, allows the 
data to be used over the Internet, but often does not allow it to be copied to the local computer.  
GIS data formats do not always follow the latest conventions. Computer operating systems have 
become more permissive in the naming of folders and files over time. Originally, computer file 

Chapter 2 
44 
names were restricted to alphanumeric characters (letters or numbers only), and computers used 
the space character to signify the end of one file name and the beginning of another. Uppercase 
letters were not interchangeable with lowercase letters. Nonalphanumeric characters such as 
$ or % or # had special meanings. Very long names could exceed program file name limits. 
Today, operating systems are more flexible, but not all software applications evolve at the same 
rate or follow the same conventions. Even current versions of an application may contain old bits 
of programming code that can fail when they encounter files or folders named according to the 
new rules. GIS users must follow more restrictive rules about where to put data and what to 
name it. 
Organizing data files 
Today’s computers try to do our file management for us—they figure out whether we are saving 
writing, music, or videos and drop them into pre-organized folders. They open recently visited 
folders automatically. They recognize what type of file is being opened and select the right 
application. They even suggest what to name files. These features can be convenient for a casual 
user, but they cause problems in complex applications. A GIS professional must take 
responsibility and learn some precepts of sound file management. These precepts are common to 
many computing fields and are useful guidelines to follow at any time, not just for GIS. 
Be mindful when saving files. Don’t let the computer save files with default names, because the 
names may not reflect what is in the file, or may be too long, or may not follow the proper 
naming conventions. Be careful to note where the computer is trying to save a file; in some cases 
this may be a default location or your last-used folder, rather than the appropriate place. Always 
put files in an organized place where they belong. The Desktop is a terrible place for GIS data. 
Organize files using folders. Finding files is much easier if you have a system of folders to 
organize the files that belong together. Imagine how hard it would be to find things if all the data 
for this class came in one giant folder, rather than organized into folders based on the geographic 
area (Fig. 2.1). Take the time to develop a thoughtful and logical system of folders to contain GIS 
data. There is no one right way to organize a data folder tree, but 
folder names and the structure should make sense and enable you 
to find things easily. However, if you are organizing data for 
multiple users to enjoy, then it is also beneficial to make the 
structure easily understandable to others. 
In GIS, it is helpful to separate static data folders, containing 
finished permanent data, from working folders in which data are 
being downloaded, files are being added and deleted, and 
intermediate results clutter the folder. Separating active work 
folders reduces the chance of accidentally deleting a data set, or 
losing track of which data sets are permanent and which are works 
in progress. Once a project is finished, you can clean up the folder 
and move the data to a static location. 
Be conservative when naming files and folders. To make file systems compatible with any type 
of software, keep folder names short and use only letters, numbers, and the underscore character. 
Avoid spaces and never use nonalphanumeric symbols. Spaces may be used for file names if the 
program accepts them, but it is best to stay away from nonalphanumeric characters for all file 
names.  
Fig. 2.1. Folder 
organization is very 
important for GIS data. 

Managing GIS Data 
45 
VERY IMPORTANT TIP: GIS folders and data set names should not contain spaces or special 
characters, such as #, @, &,*. Use the underscore character _ to create spaces in names if needed. 
Store GIS data in top level drive folders. Windows uses personal Library and Documents folders 
as default locations for user data, but these locations often cause problems when used for GIS 
data. In a network environment, the pathnames 
may contain problematic characters or spaces 
that may prevent the GIS from working 
properly in all situations. It can also be difficult 
to find these locations, and the routes to these 
folders can be tedious to navigate. The best 
practice is to create GIS data folders at the 
topmost level, directly under the drive letter 
designation, for example, C:\gisdata or 
C:\mydata. From that initial point a user can 
create as many subfolders as needed. 
Pay attention to file extensions. Most files on a 
computer have an extension, a three- or four-
letter code that indicates the type of file. A 
Word document has a .doc or .docx extension, 
and a picture might have a .jpg or .png 
extension. Computers use this extension to help 
determine which application should be used 
when a user double-clicks a file to open it. By 
default, the computer hides file extensions from 
the user, but it is often helpful to see them, 
especially when downloading files and working 
with data in unknown formats. You can change 
the default setting in the Folder Options in the 
Control Panel on your computer (Fig. 2.2). 
TIP: File geodatabases are simply folders with files in them, making it possible to store files like 
spreadsheets in them. However, this practice can damage the geodatabase if a user is not careful. 
Never use Windows or other applications to save or manage files inside a file geodatabase. 
Finding data for a project 
Looking for and obtaining data for a project is an open-ended and complex activity, especially 
since the GIS data landscape is continually changing. New data sets emerge; old ones become 
unavailable or are moved to new locations. New methods for discovering and formatting 
information mingle with ancient, nearly forgotten file types. The volume, diversity, and 
complexity of available data are bewildering, but we will begin to develop the skills needed for 
this task. Getting proficient requires flexibility, perseverance, and willingness to experiment, and 
it takes time and practice. A high tolerance for frustration and an experienced mentor are valuable 
assets in the search for data.

Most GIS data sets are organized for a particular geographic area. As explained in Chapter 1, GIS 
data have an intrinsic scale for which they were designed, the source scale. When searching for 
data to use, the source scale must be suitable for the area and intended use of the geodatabase.  
Imagine compiling data for a project focused on the state of 
New Jersey. A typical page-size map of the state would 
have a scale of about 1:2,000,000. Viewing individual 
counties would require a scale of about 1:300,000. 
Examine the three different feature classes in Figure 2.3, 
showing the New Jersey state boundary in the Sandy Hook 
area at a scale of 1:300,000. The purple, orange, and black 
lines represent source scales of 1:25 million, 1:5 million, 
and 1:50,000, respectively. The purple feature class is not 
appropriate for a state geodatabase at all. The orange one 
can be used for state or county-wide mapping or analysis, 
and the black one would be fine for city-level. Sometimes 
one must settle for data with a smaller source scale than 
desired because nothing else is easily available, but the 
user needs to be aware of the consequent limitations on the 
precision of the project results. 
Generally, the larger the scale or more specialized the 
project, the more difficult it can be to find preexisting data. 
General base data for roads, cities, and political boundaries 
are widely available, even at large scales. Very large scale 
data, like utilities, parcels, or building footprints, will generally be found for only small areas at a 
time, and may not be available for download by the public because of privacy or security 
concerns. Specialized data sets, such as land use categories or geologic maps, are most often 
available either at state or national scales or as detailed maps in isolated areas.  
If nothing can be found, then either the project must be revised, or the data must be created in-house. 
Original data can be time-consuming and expensive to create, which is why specialized large-scale 
data is difficult to find. For class projects, it is wise to choose topics and scales for which data may be 
easily located. Sometimes it is easier to find interesting data first and then develop the topic! 
Searching for data can start at an agency web site or a generic clearinghouse. A list of good 
places to start is included at the end of this chapter, but the Internet changes so quickly that some 
of the links may well be obsolete by the time the book goes to press. One can sometimes have 
good luck with general Internet search engines by including the term “shapefile”, “GIS”, or “e00” 
along with a topic or place name; for example, “Wyoming GIS” or “geology shapefile”.  
ArcGIS Online can be a valuable source of data. However, two things must be remembered. First, 
many data sets on ArcGIS Online are designed to be used online and do not allow the user to 
make a local copy. Second, almost anyone can share data on ArcGIS Online. Some of it is 
provided by agencies and companies and is excellent, but some is worthless. As with anything on 
the Internet, let the searcher beware.
Data tables can also be good sources of data, such as text files, Excel spreadsheets, or even a 
copy/paste of tabular data found on a web page and saved in a text file or spreadsheet. If the table 
has fields with x-y values in them, these rows can usually be converted to point data with 
Fig. 2.3. Three New Jersey data 
sets with different source scales 

Managing GIS Data 
47 
attributes. If the table has attributes like county names, state names, or FIPS codes (a federal 
identifier of political units in the United States), then these tables can often be joined to existing 
feature classes and incorporated into a geodatabase as spatial data. Chapter 6 has more 
information about working with tables. 
Importing and exporting data 
After downloading some data, the first step is to ascertain the data format, because some 
additional processing is usually needed before the GIS can work with, or even recognize, the data. 
Always start by examining the downloaded files in Windows Explorer, taking note of the file 
extensions in particular. 
Data downloaded from the Internet is typically zipped, a process that combines many individual 
files into a single file and compresses the information to use less space. A single smaller file is 
easier to download than multiple larger files, but the files must be unzipped before the GIS will 
recognize the data. Zipped files have file extensions of .gz, .zip, .tar, .tgz, or.tar.gz. Many 
different zip utilities are available to “unzip” files, some free, and each one works differently. 
You will need one of them on your computer, so if you are not already familiar with them, ask 
your instructor what is typically used on your campus, or a coworker what is used in your 
organization, and learn how to install and use it. 
The oldest version of ArcGIS, Arc/Info, used a proprietary zipping/conversion format to convert 
coverages into a single text file that could be easily downloaded, known as an Interchange file and 
bearing the file extension .e00. Files with the .e00 extension must be converted back into coverages 
using the Import from E00 tool in the Conversions Tools toolset in ArcToolbox. Afterwards, the 
coverage can be converted to a geodatabase or a shapefile.  
After unzipping, you must ascertain the data format of the new 
files. Sometimes data are already in a geodatabase format and can 
be copied directly to a geodatabase. More commonly though, the 
data need to be converted to the geodatabase format. The 
computer terms import and export usually refer to the process of 
copying a data file to a new location while simultaneously 
converting it from one data storage format to a different one. The 
terms also refer to the direction: an import takes external data and 
converts it to the current format; an export takes the current data 
and converts it to an external format. In practice, either may 
usually be used: one might right-click a shapefile and export it to 
a geodatabase, or right-click a geodatabase and import a 
shapefile—the two operations are equivalent. GIS programs 
typically have a set of conversion tools that allow data sets to be 
changed from one data format to another; which ones and how 
extensive the toolset is will depend on the program. 
About metadata 
Metadata provide the means to discover GIS data when 
searching, and also store valuable information about the 
provenance, handling, and quality of a data set, allowing a user 
to determine whether the data set is fit for a given purpose 
(Fig. 2.4). Once created, metadata usually travels with the data 
set. Data downloaded from ArcGIS Online or the Internet will 
Fig. 2.4. Metadata 

Chapter 2 
48 
often have metadata as part of the file (or in a separate file). When downloading, watch for links 
to metadata and be sure to download them along with the data set. It is a good practice to skim the 
metadata to learn some basic things about it, such as the originator and the source scale. The 
metadata may need to be updated if the user makes any changes to the original files. 
Developing or updating metadata is always needed, but the level of effort can vary. Sometimes 
GIS data is used only by its creator. In this case, the metadata can be minimal, although it is still 
valuable to record some information for future reference, such as a citation documenting the 
source of the data and any information you found on the web site, such as the source scale or the 
year the data were published. In this chapter, we will learn how to quickly document a data set. 
Professionals who create data that will be distributed to clients or the public incur an obligation to 
create more extensive metadata. They must evaluate the quality of the data and provide a report 
that summarizes the spatial and thematic accuracy so that users can determine whether a data set 
is suited to a particular purpose. Producers should also provide information on other aspects of a 
data set, such as what geographic area it covers, what coordinate system it uses, what the 
information in the attribute tables means, how a potential user can access the data, and more. If 
the original data were created or compiled by others, the producer must also give proper credit to 
the originators. This type of metadata creation is covered in Chapter 14.  
Metadata also record access and use constraints. Some GIS data, including most data sets derived 
from federal agencies, can be freely copied and redistributed. Other data are licensed to the 
specific users who purchased it. Every user is responsible for understanding the access constraints 
placed on any data set and for abiding by them. Failure to do so can result in civil and criminal 
penalties against an individual or the organization. 
About ArcGIS 
Map documents and shared data 
As previously discussed, GIS data files are often large and shared by multiple users. The map 
document is designed to support these characteristics. A map document (or a layer file) does not 
store the GIS data files within it. Instead, the map stores the name and disk location of the spatial 
data—its source. When it needs the data, to draw some features for example, it uses the 
information to find and access the data from its original location.  
This treatment is different from what most people are accustomed to. In a word processing or 
slideshow document, an inserted picture is copied and saved again inside the document. If the 
document is e-mailed or copied to a new location, the picture goes with it. The advantage of this 
method is that the picture is always where it needs to be. The disadvantage is that multiple copies 
are created, increasing the size of the document. If you edit the original picture to improve it, the 
changes are not incorporated into any of the files already created. 
In GIS, storing the information separately from the document and using layer properties to 
manipulate it has several benefits. First, it makes it easy for multiple users to share data. Each 
user accesses the same data but can customize how it appears. Figure 2.5 shows a counties feature 
class stored on a network drive; the same feature class has been used by several students in their 
map documents. Second, it saves space. Each student need not store a copy of the data, and the 
map documents will be small files no matter how much data they use. Third, it allows updates of 
a central database to be quickly distributed to every user. If the counties feature class is updated 
with new population estimates, the information will be available the next time the students open 
their maps. 

Managing GIS Data 
49 
However, the practice of storing data separately has its own problems. Propagating updates to all 
users is wonderful, but if someone accidentally damages or deletes some data, many people are 
affected. Furthermore, because the map document only stores the location to the data, it can lose 
track of it if the data are deleted, moved, or renamed. You usually cannot e-mail a map document 
to someone because the data won’t be sent with it. Unless the recipient has access to the same 
data in the original location (on a network drive, for example), the map will show up empty.  
Shared data requires that data managers implement precautions to ensure that an editing mistake 
does not affect dozens of people. Sometimes the files are write-protected and only a small number 
of users are authorized to make changes. In a more complex environment where GIS data must 
have multiple editors, organizations may use an enterprise geodatabase. 
Shared data also raises challenges for small teams working on a joint project. If each person has 
his or her own data, then updates cannot easily be shared. If all team members access the same 
data in one location, it becomes possible for two people to make simultaneous or conflicting edits 
to a feature class, which can potentially corrupt the database. Unless the team has an enterprise 
geodatabase available, it must devise a strategy for data sharing that eliminates the possibility of 
two people editing the same feature class at the same time. 
Map documents and pathnames 
Map documents keep track of the source files by storing the location of each file as a pathname, 
which lists the successive folders traversed to a data set, each separated by backslashes. To 
explore the relationships between documents and pathnames, consider the file system represented 
in Figure 2.6. The blue box is the hard drive C:\, the green boxes are folders, the gray box is a 
geodatabase, and the text entries represent either map documents (.mxd) or shapefiles (.shp). The 
.mxd files that begin with the letters US access data in the Usa folder, and the .mxd files that 
begin with NJ access data from the Njdata geodatabase. The pathname 
C:\mgisdata\Usa\States.shp refers to the feature class States.shp, which resides in the Usa 
folder, which in turn resides in the mgisdata folder, which is found on drive C:\.

counties feature class 
F:\Dept\gisdata\Oregon\oregondata.gdb\counties 
Fig. 2.5. The same feature class can be used in multiple map documents. 

Chapter 2 
50 
The pathname C:\mgisdata\Usa\States.shp 
is termed an absolute pathname because it 
starts at the drive letter and proceeds 
downward to the file. When searching for a 
file using an absolute pathname, the search 
begins at the drive level. A relative 
pathname is used to indicate that the search 
should begin in the folder containing the 
map document. A double dot indicates 
movement up one folder. The pathname 
..\Usa\States.shp indicates a search up one 
folder and then down into the Usa folder and 
then to the States feature class (Fig. 2.6). 
Map documents can store either absolute or 
relative pathnames as chosen by the user, 
with absolute pathnames as the default. 
Imagine that the map document ex_1.mxd in Figure 2.6 is being opened, and it uses the States file 
in the Usa folder. If the document stores absolute paths, it searches for States starting at the C:\ 
drive down through C:\mgisdata\Usa\States.shp in order to locate and draw the states in the map. 
If the document uses relative paths, it goes up one level to the mgisdata folder, then down to the 
Usa folder and the States data. 
If a map document cannot find the data based on the stored path, red 
exclamation points will appear beside the lost data sets when the 
map document is opened (Fig. 2.7). Any time a folder or file name is 
changed or the location is moved, the potential exists to break a 
pathname link and cause the map document to lose track of the data. 
For example, imagine that the owner of this file system decides to 
rename the Usa folder USdata instead. Both types of pathnames 
would lose track of the data, and the map documents Ex_1, USproj, 
and USmap would all have red exclamation points upon being 
opened. 
TIP: What do you suppose happens if you try to remove a space that you accidentally put in a 
folder name, if map documents are already referring to data inside that folder? 
Absolute pathnames are best for map documents that use data residing on a permanent shared 
server to which everyone has access. In this situation, e-mailing map documents within the 
organization even works, because everyone has access to the same data in the same location. 
Absolute paths also work well for referring to data stored on one’s own hard drive, as long as the 
data folders are not moved or renamed. 
Relative pathnames work best for a folder containing maps and data that may be moved to 
different locations. If all of the map documents in Figure 2.6 used relative pathnames, they would 
continue to work whether the mgisdata folder resided on a drive named F:\, K:\, or D:\. The map 
documents on the DVD that comes with this book are stored with relative pathnames so that the 
links to the data layers continue to work no matter where you install the mgisdata folder. In a 
university environment, students commonly use USB thumb or portable drives to save data so

point indicates that the 
pathname link is broken.

that it will be available on any computer. However, these units are not always assigned the same 
drive letter each time they are inserted in a computer. For this reason, relative paths should be 
used for map documents stored on thumb or portable drives.  
TIP: A setting under Customize > ArcMap Options allows the user to set relative pathnames as 
the default for all new map documents. 
Pathnames should NEVER contain spaces. ArcGIS will not permit you to put a space in a GIS 
data file name, but it is particularly insidious about spaces in folder names. They are permitted 
and will work for the most part, but occasionally one tool or function will crash if it is used on 
data with spaces in its pathname. The only way to proceed is to rename the folder—this causes 
the map documents to lose track of the data, and then they must be fixed as well. Experienced 
GIS users FLINCH when they see a space in a folder name, and you should learn to as well. 
Teach yourself never to use them anywhere on your computer, and you will be happier for it. 
Understanding file locks 
When accessing a file, computers distinguish between read access and write access. Read access 
allows a program to take information out of a file without changing it. Write access allows 
changes to be made to the stored file. File systems use access restrictions to protect data. In a 
network file system, a folder may be designated to have read access for most users, to protect it 
from being accidentally (or purposely) damaged. On your own computer, you will generally have 
both read and write access (read-write access) to all files. 
Access rights are important when multiple people use files. You may have had the experience of 
opening a Word document that was in use by another person (or by yourself) and received a 
message that the file was in use, with an offer to let you open a read-only copy. In this case, the 
first person who opened the file had read-write access, but the second person only had read 
access. If the second user made changes, they would have to be saved using a renamed copy. 
Programs keep track of which documents are being used by creating a small lock file in the same 
folder as the document while it is open in an application. When the program releases the file, the 
lock is deleted, and another program is free to access the file. When you open a document, the 
application checks for the file lock. If it is present, you will get the “in use” message. 
Because GIS data are designed to be shared, ArcGIS is more clever about locks. Most operations 
in ArcGIS, such as drawing features in a map, only read the data. The program recognizes this 
fact, so multiple users reading a data set causes no error messages. The first person to access the 
data will cause a lock to be placed on the file, but as long as additional users perform operations 
that require only read access, the presence of the lock does not matter. 
A user must take specific actions to prepare a data set for write access, such as starting an editing 
session or trying to delete a field from a table. ArcMap checks for file locks only when write 
access is needed; if they are present, the user is warned and will be unable to complete the action 
until the lock is gone. Locks are usually deleted by removing the data from the map document or 
closing the program. 
However, ArcGIS is prone to glitches in which it does not recognize that a lock has been removed 
and generates an “in use” error when a user tries a write operation, even when no other 
applications appear to be using the file. The best way to clear the spurious lock is to save the 

Chapter 2 
52 
document and exit ArcMap. Once the program is restarted and the document reopened, the locks 
will be cleared and the write action can proceed. Rarely, a reboot of the computer is required to 
clear the locks and can be attempted if closing and reopening ArcMap does not work. 
TIP: Like other programs, running more than one instance of ArcMap on a single computer may 
cause read-write access problems due to locks. For this reason, and because ArcMap is a large 
program that uses a great deal of memory, it is not recommended to run more than one instance of 
ArcMap at a time. Running ArcMap and ArcCatalog simultaneously can also cause lock issues. 
Using ArcCatalog to manage files 
The ArcCatalog program shares many functions with Windows Explorer, the application used to 
view, copy, rename, delete, and move data files on the computer. However, ArcCatalog 
understands the unique characteristics of GIS data and is better at managing GIS files. For 
example, Chapter 1 described how a single shapefile feature class is composed of multiple files 
with the same prefix and different extensions (roads.dbf, roads.shp, roads.prj …). Windows 
Explorer would allow a user to delete one of these files, thereby destroying the feature class and 
rendering it unusable. ArcCatalog, however, knows that these files form a unit. It shows them as a 
single icon and requires users to save, copy, or rename them as a unit. Always use ArcCatalog to 
manage (copy, move, rename, delete) GIS data. 
VERY IMPORTANT TIP: Do not use Windows to copy or delete coverages, shapefiles, and 
geodatabases. Always use ArcCatalog to delete or copy spatial data sets. 
ArcCatalog has additional functions as well. It offers the ability to preview the contents of GIS 
data sets, both the features and the tables, in order to ascertain what a data set contains. It includes 
an editor for reading and editing metadata. It performs many GIS-specific data management 
functions, such as creating geodatabases or feature classes, adding new columns to a table, or 
editing the coordinate system label of a data set.  
ArcCatalog functions are frequently needed when working on a project. It may be used in two 
ways, as a standalone program or as the Catalog window sitting inside ArcMap. The Catalog tab 
is often more convenient, and it avoids issues with file locks that can occur when running 
ArcMap and ArcCatalog at the same time. Occasionally, using ArcCatalog is easier, especially if 
you are mostly searching for and managing files, or if you are focused on creating metadata. Both 
versions have the same functionality, so which one is used is only a matter of convenience and 
preference. 
In this chapter we explore the functions of ArcCatalog for compiling GIS data for a project. In 
many cases, data already exist but need to be copied or converted to a new geodatabase. We 
tackle the more complicated process of creating data from scratch in Chapter 7. 
An import function copies a data set from one location into the geodatabase, converting formats on 
the way if needed. An export function goes the other direction, copying a data set from the 
geodatabase to another location. In most cases they can be used interchangeably; the only difference 
is where to start the function. Formats that are directly supported by ArcGIS, such as shapefiles and 
geodatabases, can use menus to import or export them in or out of a geodatabase. External formats 
such as Excel tables or KML, however, usually need to be converted using tools in ArcToolbox. A 
perusal of the Conversion Tools toolset (Fig. 2.8) is a good way to get familiar with the different 
data formats that can be converted to ArcGIS files. 

Managing GIS Data 
53 
The import and export tools in ArcGIS can do more than simply copy 
files; they also allow you to modify some aspects of the file as it is copied. 
Imagine creating a geodatabase containing just the state of New Jersey. If 
we start with a feature class containing all 50 states, we can specify that 
only New Jersey be copied during the import process to achieve our goal. 
Examine the import/export tool in Figure 2.9. The input features are a 
states feature class in the mgisdata\Usa folder. The output location is a 
NewJersey geodatabase, and the new feature class will be named 
statepoly. The Expression box uses a query to describe which features to 
include—the feature for which the STATE_NAME in the attribute table 
equals ‘New Jersey.’ Note that the Expression is optional; if nothing is 
entered, then all of the states would be copied to the new location. 
Using ArcToolbox 
ArcToolbox contains hundreds of supporting functions and programs that 
expand the capabilities of ArcGIS Desktop far past what is found in the 
menus and toolbars. It may be used in ArcCatalog or in ArcMap. When a 
tool is opened (Fig. 2.10), required inputs are marked with a green dot (a). 
To enter data sets as inputs or outputs, use the Browse button next to the 
appropriate box (b). If using the tool in ArcMap, you can also select layers 
in the map from a drop-down list as inputs. Optional inputs are marked (c) 
and can usually be left to their defaults. Some tools have input parameters that extend beyond the 
visible pane, and the scroll bar must be used to view and enter them. To get more information about 
the tool or an input, click the Show/Hide Help button (d) for a brief description of the tool’s 
function. For more detailed help, especially on the input/output data, click the Tool Help button (e).  
TIP: When using a tool for the first time, it is 
strongly recommended that you read the 
detailed help information. It may contain 
critical information for making the tool work 
properly. 
The input pane for a tool posts symbols to help 
you use the tool (Fig. 2.11). A green dot next 
to an input parameter indicates that it is 
required and must be entered before the tool 
will run. A yellow exclamation point indicates 
that the user should proceed with caution. 
Placing the cursor over the yellow sign for a 
moment will display a pop-up message 
describing the problem; in Figure 2.11, the 
user is attempting to define a coordinate 
system for a data set that already has one. A 
red X indicates an error that would cause the 
tool to fail; the tool cannot be executed until 
the error is cleared. Again, holding the 
cursor over the X will display the error 
message.

By default, a tool runs in background mode so 
that you can continue working as it runs. 
When the tool begins running, blue scrolling 
text will appear at the bottom of the ArcMap 
or ArcCatalog window. If an error occurs, it 
will be reported in a dialog box. When the tool 
completes successfully, a blue completion 
message will pop up in the lower-right corner 
of your computer screen (Fig. 2.11). The 
message will go away automatically, or you 
can click the X to close it.  
TIP: Background processing is slower to 
start and finish a task, and it may not run as 
reliably as foreground processing. The author 
strongly recommends that you turn off 
background processing in the Geoprocessing 
> Geoprocessing Options window.

With so many functions, finding the right one 
can be difficult. ArcGIS has a Search window 
(Fig. 2.12) that can be used to search for tools as 
well as other items. 
Documenting data 
Compiling data for a project usually requires some 
work with the metadata. ArcCatalog has a Metadata 
Editor used to read and edit metadata for geospatial 
files. By default, it uses a simple format called the 
Item Description (Fig. 2.13), which shows only a 
few entries, even though the actual metadata may 
be far more extensive. The Item Description is 
designed for users to quickly review or enter the 
most important characteristics of a data set. 
The fields of the Item Description, and what they 
need to contain, are as follows: 
Tags record a few terms that can be used for 
searching for the data. 
The Summary is a brief description, a sentence 
or two, describing the purpose of the data, or 
the intentions with which it was developed. 
Use it to quickly give the reader an idea of 
what the data set is designed for. 
The Description can be a more extended 
explanation of the contents of the data set. It 
can include anything that is important to know, 
such as what the data set contains, how it was 
developed, what the attributes mean, and any 
information known about the data quality, such 
as the source scale. The Description may be 
short or it could run to several paragraphs.  
The Credits record the source(s) of the data. It 
may include a formal citation if the data 
originally came from a book, journal article, or 
published map. For downloaded data, it should 
include the URL where the data were obtained. 
If the data originated from an individual or 
agency, the names should be listed. It is a good 
practice to construct a formal citation for any 
data set you download and place it in the 
Credits box; when you need to place the 
citation in a report or on a map, you need only 
copy it.

Chapter 2 
56 
The Use Limitation provides information on any restrictions placed on the data, such as whether 
it can be copied or shared. This statement may be a simple sentence, but some companies use this 
box for an extended legal statement.  
The Appropriate Scale Range suggests the scales at which the data are valid and should be used.  
The Bounding Box is automatically entered by the software from the x-y extent of the features. It 
is always in degrees and is used by geographic-based search engines. 
TIP: You should make a practice of quickly documenting any data set that you intend to keep or 
use again. If you are developing metadata for data to be shared with others, however, it is best to 
learn to create the more extended forms of metadata covered in Chapter 14. 
Sources for GIS data 
There is no one-stop source of GIS data, but these sites should get you started. Doing an Internet 
search for “sources of GIS data” will yield many more lists of sites.

Managing GIS Data 
57 
Summary 
¾ GIS data are different from more common data types such as word processing or spreadsheet 
documents and have special considerations that must be understood and applied. 
¾ GIS data have different naming conventions than many other types of data. Folder names and 
file names should be short and use only numbers and letters and the underscore character.  
¾ GIS users must take responsibility for setting up organized folder trees to store GIS data and 
making sure that files are saved in the appropriate place with descriptive names. 
¾ Data compiled for a project must be taken from data with source scales suitable for the 
geographic area and intended purpose of the geodatabase. 
¾ Finding data for a GIS project requires many general computer skills such as Internet 
searching, downloading, unzipping, and converting between file formats. Building these 
skills through practice, experimentation, and training is important. 
¾ Metadata provide information about data sets and is needed for the user to evaluate its fitness for 
a given purpose. In-house data may use the Item Description for quick documentation; data 
intended for distribution needs to use a standards-based metadata format. 
¾ Map documents store references to feature classes and rasters rather than storing the data. 
Absolute or relative pathnames may be used depending on the situation. 
¾ Moving, renaming, and deleting GIS data has the potential to break links from map 
documents to the data. Care should be taken during these activities to avoid having to fix 
broken links. 
¾ File locks are used by software to prevent multiple users from editing the same file. Shared 
GIS data require planning ahead to ensure that multiple users have the access and permissions 
needed without putting the data at risk.

Chapter Review Questions 
1. What characters should be avoided when naming GIS files, folders, and map documents? 
Explain why these restrictions are necessary. 
2. What is a file extension, and what does the computer use it for? 
3. Although ArcGIS Online is a good source of many types of data, what factors may interfere 
with using it to compile local data for a project? 
4. Which kind of metadata should be used for documenting data created while studying this 
book? Defend your answer. 
5. Which would take more storage space, a layer file showing all the US counties or a layer file 
showing all the US states? 
6. What does it mean if you find a red exclamation point next to a map layer? How would you 
fix it? 
7. Reexamine Figure 2.6 and its description in the text. The following table contains four 
actions. Below each is the list of the map documents in Figure 2.6. For each one, indicate 
whether the pathnames in the map document would still work (yes/no) after the action was 
taken, depending on whether the map document is saved with absolute (Abs) or relative (Rel) 
pathnames.

Mastering the Skills 
Teaching Tutorial  
The following examples provide step-by-step instructions for doing basic tasks and solving basic 
problems in ArcGIS. The steps you need to do are highlighted with an arrow Î; follow them 
carefully. Click on the video number in the Video Index to view a demonstration of the steps. 
TIP: Make sure your computer is set to show file extensions; in Windows this setting is generally 
found in the Control Panel under Folder Options (see Figure 2.2). 
Using ArcCatalog 
  Î Start ArcCatalog. 
1Î Examine the Catalog Tree, normally on the left 
side of the window. This window can be used to 
view and explore data folders.  
1Î Clicking a plus sign expands a folder to show its 
contents; clicking a minus sign collapses it.  
1Î If any folders are expanded right now, click the 
minus signs to close them all. 
1Î You will see exactly the same entries as when 
adding data in the Chapter 1 tutorial.  
 
2Î Expand the Folder Connections entry. You will see the same connections you already 
added in ArcMap (Fig. 2.14). ArcMap and ArcCatalog share this information. 
2Î Examine the viewing area on the right, noting that it has three tabs: Contents, 
Preview, and Description. Make sure the Contents tab 
is currently active.  
2Î Expand the connection to the mgisdata folder to see the subfolders. 
2Î Click on the Oregon folder. The panel on the right updates to show its contents.  
2Î These buttons change how the Contents tab displays the contents. 
Click on each one in turn and examine how the viewing panel 
changes. Leave it on the third setting (Details) when finished. 
You should see a variety of file types in the Oregon folder, including geodatabases, a raster, and 
some Excel spreadsheets (Fig. 2.15). If you have set Windows to show file extensions, you will 
see the extensions listed along with the file type. 
3Î In the Catalog Tree, expand the Oregon subfolder and the oregondata geodatabase 
so you can see the feature classes and feature datasets. 
3Î Click on the cities feature class. The Contents tab updates to show an icon for the 
feature class. 
3Î Click on the Preview tab. The viewing panel now shows the features.  
3Î Use the Zoom and Pan tools to zoom closer to some of the cities.  
3Î Use the Identify tool to get more information about a city.  
Fig. 2.14. The Catalog Tree 

Chapter 2 
60 
These tools help explore data sets to find out what 
is in them. The table can also be displayed.  
4Î Click the Geography drop-down 
button and select Table instead. 
4Î Scroll to the right and examine the 
table attribute fields. 
4Î Click the Table Options button to 
view the commands available, but 
don’t select any at this time. Just click 
the blue bar at the top of the window to 
close the menu. 
 
5Î Let’s preview a different data set. 
Click the gtoposhd raster in the Catalog 
Tree.  
5Î The table is not that interesting, so click the Table drop-down and select Geography. 
5Î If you are still zoomed in, click the Full Extent button to see the entire raster. 
5Î Click on each data set in the oregondata geodatabase in turn, previewing it so that 
you can quickly get an idea of the data sets available. 
 
6Î While the last data set is still highlighted, click the Description tab. It will take a 
moment to open, but it shows the metadata for the data set. 
6Î Click on another feature class to view its Item Description. Note the different types 
of information present. 
6Î Click the Preview tab to return to viewing the data instead of the metadata. 
Data sets have properties that can be viewed and managed in ArcCatalog. Unlike changing layer 
properties in ArcMap, changing properties in ArcCatalog usually makes permanent changes to 
the files. Be very careful when working in ArcCatalog. 
7Î Right-click the parks feature class in the Catalog Tree and choose Properties. 
Examine each tab, but make no changes. Cancel to close the window. 
7Î Right-click the gtoposhd1km raster in the Catalog Tree and choose Properties. 
Examine how raster properties differ from vector properties.  
1. What is the resolution (cell size) of this raster? How many rows and columns does it have? 
SKILL TIP: By default only a brief description is shown. Learn how to make ArcCatalog 
display the complete metadata information (Metadata). 
8Î Close the gtoposh1km properties, if necessary, and collapse the Oregon folder. 
8Î Expand the Rapidcity folder. Inside it, expand the archive folder to examine its 
contents (Fig. 2.16). This folder holds many types of GIS data.  
Fig. 2.15. Data in the Oregon folder 

Managing GIS Data 
61 
2. How many coverages are there in the archive folder? 
_____ How many tables? _____ How many rasters? 
_____ How many layer files? _____ How many 
shapefiles? _____  
8Î Collapse the archive folder and the Rapidcity 
folder.  
Creating and organizing data 
Now we will create a new geodatabase with feature classes 
for New Jersey, placing it outside the mgisdata folder to 
separate our “project work” from the book exercises. 
Chapter 1 suggested placing the mgisdata folder in a 
C:\gisclass folder. The instructions assume you are using 
this folder, but if not, substitute the name of whatever 
folder contains your mgisdata folder. 
9Î Examine the Catalog Tree and find the 
connection to your mgisdata folder, for 
example, C:\gisclass\mgisdata. 
Because we created the connection directly to the mgisdata folder, we cannot access the folder 
above it. We need to create another folder connection. 
9Î Click the Connect to Folder button on the main toolbar. 
9Î Navigate through the tree to the C:\gisclass folder and select it. Click OK.  
9Î Find where the C:\gisclass folder was added under Folder Connections and expand 
it. The mgisdata folder will be in it. 
Now we see two connections to mgisdata, which might get confusing. It can also cause problems 
to have multiple connections to the same folder. So let’s remove the first folder connection.  
10Î Right-click the C:\gisclass\mgisdata connection and choose Disconnect Folder. 
10Î Expand the mgisdata folder again to see the subfolders. 
Now we are ready to compile data for our New Jersey project. 
11Î Right-click the C:\gisclass folder in the Catalog Tree and choose New > Folder. 
11Î A new folder is created, waiting for you to type its name. Enter NJ_Project and 
press Enter. (Always use an underscore instead of a space.) 
11Î Right-click the NJ_Project folder and choose New > File Geodatabase. When it 
appears, name it NewJersey (no spaces!). 
TIP: If you accidentally put a space in the name, right-click the geodatabase and choose Rename. 
Type in the name again without the space and press Enter. 
Of course, the NewJersey geodatabase is empty, and we need to put data in it. We will start by 
importing some data available in our mgisdata\Usa folder.  
12Î Right-click the NewJersey geodatabase and choose Import > Feature Class (single). 
12Î Click the Browse button next to the empty Input Features box (Fig. 2.17). 
Fig. 2.16. Data sets in ArcCatalog 

Chapter 2 
62 
12Î Navigate into the 
mgisdata\Usa\usdata geodatabase 
and click the states feature class. 
Click Add. 
12Î Notice that the Output Location is 
already set to the NewJersey 
geodatabase, because you right-
clicked it to start the import. 
12Î In the Output Feature Class box, 
enter the name to be given to the new 
feature class, newjerseybnd. 
We want only the features for New Jersey, so we must use the Expression box to select the state 
using values from the attribute table. The Query Builder is used to create expressions. 
13Î Click the SQL button next to the Expression box to open the Query Builder. 
13Î The top panel contains fields from the feature class table. Double-click the 
STATE_NAME field in the upper panel to enter it in the lower panel. 
13Î Click the ‘=’ button. 
13Î Click the Get Unique Values button; it will scan the values in the STATE_NAME 
field and allow you to select from them. 
13Î Find the entry for ‘New Jersey’ and double-click it to enter it in the lower panel. 
13Î The lower panel should now read STATE_NAME = ‘New Jersey’.  
13Î Click Verify to make sure the expression is correctly formatted. If it was, click OK 
to continue. If not, clear the expression and try again. 
13Î When the expression is correct, click OK to close the Query Builder. The upper part 
of the Import window should look as shown in Fig. 2.17. 
13Î Click OK to start importing. 
The new feature class appears in the NewJersey geodatabase (you may need to expand the 
geodatabase to see it, or right-click the geodatabase and click Refresh). 
14Î Click the newjerseybnd feature class in the Catalog Tree and make sure the 
Contents tab is selected in the viewing panel. 
14Î Notice that the thumbnail image still shows all of the states; we will fix 
this in a moment. 
14Î Click the Preview tab. The new feature class only has New Jersey. 
14Î Click the Create Thumbnail button to update the icon for the data set. 
14Î Click the Contents tab. The icon shows only New Jersey now.  
When a data set is imported or exported, any metadata it has is copied to the new feature class. 
However, we should update the Item Description when we change a data set. 
15Î Click the Description tab in the viewing panel and click the Edit button. 
15Î Modify the Tags and Summary to better reflect what is in the feature class now. 
Fig. 2.17. Importing New Jersey 

Managing GIS Data 
63 
15Î In the Description box, add this statement at the end: Subset to New Jersey 
from a national data set by <your name> on <current date>. 
15Î In the credits box, construct a citation to document the source of the data: 
Mastering ArcGIS, Tutorial Data, 7th edition by Maribeth Price (2015) 
[DVD-ROM]. McGraw-Hill Higher Ed: Dubuque, Iowa. 
15Î Click Save. 
TIP: It is good practice to update the Item Description whenever you modify a data set. 
Let’s import another feature class—the cities. However, every feature class table is different. The 
expression we used last time, STATE_NAME = ‘New Jersey’ may not work for the cities table. It 
helps to view the table first to make sure we know what expression to use. 
16Î Navigate to the mgisdata\Usa\usdata geodatabase in the Catalog Tree and click on 
the cities feature class. 
16Î Click the Preview tab and set the Preview drop-down to Table. 
3. What do you think the expression should be this time? ____________________________  
Now we will repeat the import steps, making the necessary modifications. These new instructions 
are abbreviated; refer back to Steps 12–13 if you need a reminder. 
TIP: If you receive a script error when you select the Import tool in the next step, and ArcCatalog 
stops responding, close the program and go to page 467 in the Skills Reference. 
17Î Right-click the NewJersey geodatabase and choose Import > Feature Class (single). 
17Î Click the Browse button to set the Input Features to mgisdata\Usa\usdata\cities. 
17Î Name the output feature class njcities. 
17ÎClick the SQL button and use the buttons to enter the expression ST = ‘NJ’. Verify 
it and click OK. 
We should check the output to be sure that the import worked and update the metadata. 
18Î Click the njcities feature class in the NewJersey geodatabase in the Catalog Tree. 
18Î Click the Preview tab to ensure that only the New Jersey cities are present. 
18Î Click the Create Thumbnail button to update the icon. 
18Î Click Description button and Edit the Item Description to update it. Be sure to 
include the citation in the Credits box. 
Perhaps we would like to add highways to this geodatabase. 
19Î Click the majroads feature class in the Transportation feature dataset of the usdata 
geodatabase and click the Preview tab. 
19Î Set the Preview type to Table, if necessary, and examine the fields. 

Chapter 2 
64 
This table does not have a field that designates a state, because roads may not belong to a single 
state. However, without a state field, we cannot extract the New Jersey roads using the techniques 
we have learned so far. We will learn how to do it later. 
Î Close ArcCatalog. 
TIP: We have neglected one important issue when importing the data: the source data is stored in 
a coordinate system suitable for the United States, but a state data set needs one optimized for a 
smaller area. We will address this deficiency later as well. 
Using the Catalog window in ArcMap 
Because of file locks, it is troublesome to run ArcMap and ArcCatalog at the same time. ArcGIS 
developers have created the Catalog window, a version of ArcCatalog that runs inside ArcMap. 
    Î Open ArcMap with a new, blank map. 
20Î Click the Catalog window button on the main toolbar to open it.  
20Î If it opens docked on the right side of the ArcMap window, leave it there.  
20Î If it opens elsewhere, click the bar at the Catalog window’s top and drag it 
to the blue arrow that appears on the right side of the ArcMap window. 
Release the mouse to dock it. 
SKILL TIP: Learn how to move and arrange the toolbars, as well as how to use the docking 
icons and pins to manage windows in ArcGIS (General). 
In ArcMap, only the Catalog Tree is displayed. It works the same way as before in most respects. 
21Î In the Catalog Tree, collapse any expanded folders, leaving only the C:\gisclass 
folder connection visible (as in Fig. 2.14). 
21Î Expand the usdata geodatabase in the mgisdata\Usa folder. 
The Preview and Description tabs from ArcCatalog are not visible, but they can be opened in a 
separate window. 
22Î Right-click the rivers feature class and choose Item Description. It will take a few 
moments to open. 
22Î Move/resize the Item Description so that it and the Catalog window are visible. 
22Î Read through the information provided about the rivers feature class. 
22Î Click the cd111 feature class in the Catalog Tree. The Item Description window 
updates (after a moment) to show information on this feature class.  
4. What kind of data does this feature class contain? ______________________________ 
23Î Click on the Preview tab in the Item Description window. 
23Î Use the Zoom or Pan tool in the Item Description window to get a closer look. 
23Î Change the Geography drop-down to Table to preview the attributes.  

Managing GIS Data 
65 
5. If we wanted to select the New Jersey districts, what would the expression be? 
______________________________________________  
24Î Right-click the STATE_ABBR field and choose Sort Ascending. Scroll down and 
find the district(s) for your state. 
24Î Use the Table Options menu to open Find and Replace. Then search for Boehner. 
The cursor in the table highlights the cell when it finds it. 
24Î Close the Find/Replace and the Item Description windows. 
Now that you know it’s the feature class you want, it is easy to add it to the map. 
25Î Click on the cd111 feature class in the Catalog Tree and drag it into the map 
window. Release the mouse button to drop it in the map. 
25Î Right-click the cd111 layer symbol in the Table of Contents (not the Catalog Tree) 
and choose a pale yellow symbol. 
TIP: Be careful to select the correct window when right-clicking an item. The Table of Contents 
window lists map layers, and making changes only affects how the map appears. The Catalog 
Tree in the Catalog tab lists folders and data sets, and it can permanently change them (usually 
with no Undo). Be especially careful when working in the Catalog Tree. 
Since the Catalog Tree has the potential to change or damage our data if we are not careful, we 
are going to make it less easy to use it by mistake, while keeping it handy for when we need it. It 
will also let us see more of our map. 
26Î Click the Auto Hide button on the Catalog window to hide it, creating a 
Catalog tab where the window was docked.  
26Î Hold the cursor over the Catalog tab (no click needed) to open the Catalog 
window. Move off the window to hide it again. 
TIP: The Auto Hide button is a toggle switch. To keep the Catalog window open, click the Auto 
Hide button again. Try it now, if you like, but leave it hidden when done. 
Using ArcToolbox 
By default, ArcGIS executes tools in background mode to allow the user to keep working while 
the tool runs. However, background processing takes longer than foreground processing, and it 
can cause tools to crash. The author recommends turning off background processing. 
27Î Open Geoprocessing > Geoprocessing Options from the main menu bar. 
27Î Under Background Processing, uncheck the Enable box and click OK. 
Often tasks that we perform using menus can be done using a tool from ArcToolbox instead. 
Let’s import another feature class as an example, this time using a tool. 
28Î Click the ArcToolbox button on the main menu bar. 
28Î Dock the ArcToolbox window on the right side of the ArcMap window and 
use the Auto Hide button to fold it away. When you want a tool, hover over 
the ArcToolbox tab and the toolbox will open.  

Chapter 2 
66 
29Î Open ArcToolbox and expand the Conversion Tools toolset. 
29Î Expand the To Geodatabase toolset. 
29Î Double-click the Feature Class to Feature Class tool to open it. The tool looks 
exactly the same as the one we previously used (Fig. 2.17). 
TIP: You can drag and drop data sets from ArcMap or the Catalog window into tools. 
30Î Drag and drop the cd111 layer from the Table of Contents into the Input Features 
box on the tool. 
30Î Drag and drop the NewJersey geodatabase from the Catalog window to the Output 
Location box on the tool (or use the Browse button to find it, if you prefer). 
30Î Type njdistricts in the Output Feature Class box to name it. 
30Î Click the SQL button and enter STATE_ABBR = ‘NJ’. 
30Î Click OK to start running the tool. It will take a minute or two. Close the reporting 
box when it finishes. 
30Î Note that the new feature class is added to the Table of Contents when a tool 
finishes. Zoom to New Jersey to verify that the import worked correctly. 
 
31Î Right-click the njdistricts feature class in the Catalog Tree and open the Item 
Description window. 
31Î Click the Preview tab to ensure that only the New Jersey districts are present. 
31Î Click the Create Thumbnail button to update the icon. 
31Î Click Description button and Edit the Item Description to update it. Close the Item 
Description window when finished. 
31Î Remove the cd111 layer from the Table of Contents. 
6. Notice that if the term layer is used in the instructions, then you are directed to right-click in 
the Table of Contents. If the term feature class is used, then you must right-click in the 
Catalog Tree. Explain why. 
If you don’t know where a tool is to be found, you can search for it. 
32Î Click the Search button on the main toolbar. Dock it on the right side of the 
ArcMap window and click the Autohide button to fold it away. 
32Î Type clip in the Search box and click the Search button. 
32Î Find the Clip (Analysis) tool. Click it to open it. 
32Î Enter majroads as the Input Features and njdistricts as the Clip Features. Save the 
result as majroadclip in the NewJersey geodatabase. Click OK to run the tool. 
Using ArcMap to export data 
A third way to move data into a geodatabase is to export it from ArcMap. This method has the 
advantage that you can see what is selected before exporting, and you can use the data frame to 
convert from one coordinate system to another. We should be saving our feature classes in the 
NAD 1983 State Plane New Jersey coordinate system (we will learn why in the next chapter), and 
using ArcMap makes it easy. We start by setting the data frame to the desired coordinate system. 

Managing GIS Data 
67 
33Î Right-click the Layers data frame name and choose Properties. 
33Î Click the coordinate system tab and navigate from the top to Projected Coordinate 
Systems > State Plane > NAD 1983 (Meters). Remember to use the plain one. 
33Î Find the NAD 1983 StatePlane New Jersey 
FIPS 2900 (Meters) coordinate system and click 
to highlight it. Click OK. 
We will export earthquakes to our geodatabase next. As before, we need a query to select the 
New Jersey earthquakes, but this time we do it in ArcMap.   
34Î Add the quakehis feature class to the map from the usdata geodatabase.  
34Î Double-click the quakehis layer in the Table of Contents and examine the Source 
tab. What is the coordinate system? Close the Layer Properties window. 
34Î Right-click the quakehis layer in the Table of Contents and choose Open Attribute 
Table. 
 
 35Î Click the Select By Attributes button on the Table toolbar. This opens the Select by 
Attributes window, very similar to the Query Builder in ArcCatalog. 
35Î Enter the expression STATE = ‘NJ’ and click Apply.  
35Î Examine the bottom of the Table window and note that six quakes are selected. 
35Î Close the Table window. The selected quakes in New Jersey are highlighted. 
Now that we have the quakes we need selected, 
we can export. 
36Î Right-click the quakehis layer in 
the Table of Contents and choose 
Data > Export Data. 
36Î Make sure it is set to Export the 
Selected features. 
36Î Fill the button to Use the same 
coordinate system as the data frame. 
36Î Click the Browse button. Set the 
Save as type to File and Personal 
Geodatabase feature classes. 
36ÎNavigate inside the 
C:\gisclass\NJ_Project\NewJersey geodatabase; the newjerseybnd, njcities, and 
njdistricts feature classes will be visible. 
36Î Enter njquakes_sp as the output file name and click Save. 
36Î Check that the Export Data window looks like Figure 2.18 and click OK. 
36Î Click Yes to add the exported data to the map as a layer. 
 
37Î Double-click njquakes_sp in the Table of Contents and examine the Source tab to 
confirm that the new feature class is in the New Jersey State Plane coordinate system. 
37Î Close the properties. Right-click the original quakehis layer and choose Remove. 
Fig. 2.18. Exporting in ArcMap to a 
new coordinate system 

Chapter 2 
68 
38Î Use the Catalog window to update the Item Description for njquakes_sp. 
 
39Î Add the newjerseybnd feature classes to the map from the NewJersey geodatabase. 
Examine the state boundaries closely. Why don’t they match? 
39Î In the Catalog Tree, right-click the njdistricts feature class and choose Item 
Description. 
39Î Scroll down and examine the Scale Range section. Notice that the recommended 
scale for this data ranges from 1:50,000 to 1:5,000,000. 
 
40Î Leaving the Item Description window open, click on the newjerseybnd feature class 
in the Catalog Tree. 
40Î Examine the scale range for this data set, 1:625,000 to 1:50,000,000. (The lower 
bound here is unrealistic; pay attention to the upper bound.) 
40Î Close the Item Description window. 
40Î Examine the scale readout on the main menu bar. If the state of New Jersey fills the 
screen, the scale will be about 1:2 million. 
These two feature classes were designed for use at different scales, about 1:5 million for the 
districts and 1:50 million for the states. The New Jersey geodatabase requires larger scale data 
than the generalized feature class from which the state boundary was exported.  
TIP: Pay attention to source scales when compiling data, and try not to use data sets too far 
outside their intended scale range. 
Using data from ArcGIS Online and the Internet 
Let’s see if we can find other data to add to the New Jersey geodatabase by going online. Perhaps 
we can find a more detailed state boundary. We will continue to use our new technique of 
exporting from ArcMap so that we can save data in the appropriate coordinate system. 
41Î Click the small black arrow next to the Add Data button and choose Add Data 
From ArcGIS Online. 
41Î Enter detailed states in the search window and click the Search button. 
41Î Find the entry USA States, a layer package hosted by ESRI. Read about it in the 
Details link and write down a citation for it (see Chapter 1 examples). 
___________________________________________________________________ 
41Î Add the layer package to the map. If you see a GCS warning, check Don’t warn me 
again in this session and click Close. 
A layer package downloads data to ArcMap, which allows you to select features and export them 
to your database, just as you did previously with the quakehis feature class. Refer to the more 
detailed instructions in Steps 34–36 if needed. 
42Î Open the attribute table for the USA States (below 1:3m) layer. 
42Î Use the Select By Attributes button to select New Jersey. Close the table. 
42Î Export the USA States (below 1:3m) layer, using the selected features and the data 
frame coordinate system, saving it with the name njstate_dtl. Add it to the map.

43Î Use the Catalog window to update the thumbnail and Item Description for the 
njstate_dtl feature class. Include this citation in the Credits box (did yours look like 
this?): USA States (2013) [Layer package] ESRI on ArcGIS Online, URL: 
http://ArcGIS.com [<today’s date>]. 
43Î Right-click the USA States group layer and Remove it from the map. 
TIP: Many ArcGIS Online data sets do not allow you to export them. If you don’t see the Data > 
Export Data function when you right-click a layer, it is not exportable. A layer package or feature 
service is more likely to be exportable than a map service. 
Now that we have a state boundary with a suitable scale and coordinate system, we can delete our 
original attempt, newjerseybnd. 
44Î In the Catalog Tree, navigate to the NewJersey geodatabase if necessary. 
44Î Right-click the newjerseybnd feature class and choose Delete. Click Yes. 
TIP: ALWAYS use ArcCatalog to delete, move, and rename GIS data sets. 
Getting data from the Internet 
Finding and downloading data from the Internet can be challenging, but let’s give it a try. A good 
way to start is to type a search term plus the word GIS or shapefile to find downloadable data. 
45Î Open Internet Explorer and enter the search term New Jersey shapefile. 
45Î Examine the results. Look for URLs that appear to be state-sponsored rather than 
commercial, for example the NJDP GIS – State of New Jersey heading. (URL: 
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/gis/stateshp.html ). Open it. 
45Î Examine the site, which appears to be an excellent source of data for New Jersey. 
Before we continue, let’s organize a folder for the downloads. Downloaded data can be messy, 
and we want to keep it separate from our main working folder for the project. 
46Î Right-click the NJ_Project folder in the Catalog Tree and 
choose New > Folder. Name the folder Downloads.  
 
47Î Select Elevation Contours from the drop-down list on the NJDP-GIS site. 
47Î Click the DOWNLOAD button and use Save As to save the .zip file in the 
NJ_Project/Downloads folder. 
47Î Minimize (do not close!) the web browser for the moment. 
TIP: The data file must be unzipped before ArcGIS can recognize it. The instructions assume that 
you have a zip utility and can use it. If you need one, you can download and install 7zip for free. 
48Î Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the NJ_Project\Downloads folder. 
48Î Use a zip utility to extract the files to the NJ_Project\Downloads folder.

Notice the different files with the same root name stcon and different extensions, and recall from 
Chapter 1 that shapefiles have this format. ArcMap can read this shapefile now. 
49Î Close Windows Explorer.  
49ÎAdd the stcon shapefile to the map from the Catalog window. 
49Î Open the Item Description for stcon in the Catalog window. Click No if you are asked 
to upgrade the metadata—you will learn more about FGDC metadata in Chapter 14. 
You have not changed the file so the Item Description does not need to be updated. However, it is 
a good practice to create a citation in the Credits entry so you can recall where it came from. 
TIP: You will need to search the web site and/or open the metadata link for the data set to find all 
the information you need for the citation. That is why we kept the site page open. 
50Î Use the Preview tab to update the thumbnail. 
50Î Edit the Item Description, adding this citation to the Credits box:

Environmental Protection, URL: http://www.state.nj.us/dep/gis/ 
stateshp.html [<today’s date>]. 
7. Where did the 1987 date for the data set come from?  
51Î Right-click the stcon layer in the Table of Contents and examine its coordinate system. 
8. Does it need to be projected to match our other New Jersey data?  
51Î Right-click the stcon layer in the Table of Contents and export it to the NewJersey 
geodatabase. Use the data frame coordinate system just in case. Save it as njelevcon. 
Let’s clean up a little and save this map document for use later. 
52Î Remove all data layers from the map.  
52Î Click the Add Data button and add all the data in the NewJersey geodatabase. 
To ensure that moving the NJ_Project folder to a different place would not break any data links, 
we will set the map document to store relative pathnames.  
53Î Choose File > Map Document Properties from the main menu bar. 
53Î Check the box to Store relative pathnames to data sources. 
53Î Click OK. Now as long as the map document stays in the same folder relative to its 
source data, the links to the data will stay valid. 
 
54Î Click twice slowly on Layers and change the data frame name to New Jersey. 
54Î Edit each layer name so that it is English instead of a file name, for example, 
Cities, Congress Districts, Earthquakes, and so on.  
54Î Edit the symbols to make a more attractive map. 
54Î Save the map document in the NJ_Project folder as NJMap.mxd. Be sure to save 
it in the right place.

Relative pathnames are usually the right choice for students working in a university setting. We 
will set an option to make relative pathnames the default for all new map documents. 
55Î Choose Customize > ArcMap Options from the main tool bar. 
55Î Click the General tab. Check the box to Make relative paths the default for new 
map documents. Click OK. 
Using ESRI Data and Maps 
ArcGIS Desktop comes with an extensive set of GIS data called ESRI Data and Maps, either as a 
DVD when you purchase the software or a download by your GIS software administrator.  
56Î Open ArcGIS Desktop Help and click the Contents tab. 
56Î Expand the Geodata > Datasets provided with ArcGIS section and explore the 
ESRI Data and Maps book. Look through the data sets provided. 
56Î Examine the Redistribution rights section and make sure you understand what the 
codes 1–4 signify. 
56Î Find out from your instructor if he or she has made this data available and, if so, 
where it is to be found. 
If you have the data, we will bring an additional feature class to the New Jersey geodatabase. If 
not, save your map now and exit ArcMap. 
57Î Search the Data and Maps folders to find a US zip codes polygon feature class. 
57Î Add the feature class to ArcMap. 
57Î Examine the table to determine the correct query expression to select the zip codes 
for New Jersey. 
57Î Export the New Jersey zip codes to the NewJersey geodatabase. Make sure you 
save it in the data frame coordinate system. 
9. What coordinate system do the ESRI Data and Maps feature classes use? _______________

Exercises  
Use ArcMap, the Catalog window, and the mgisdata folder to answer the following questions. Be 
careful not to make any changes to properties when in the Catalog window. 
1. How many feature datasets are there in the oregondata geodatabase in the mgisdata\Oregon 
folder? List their names. How many total feature classes does the geodatabase have? How 
many rasters?  
  2. How many rows and columns does the Landsat image L720021127 have? (Hint: It shows 
Crater Lake in Oregon.) What is the cell size (including the units)? How many bands does it 
have? What is its coordinate system? 
  3. Who created the gtopo1km raster in the oregondata geodatabase? When was it created? In 
what units are the elevation values? 
  4. In the tutorial, you saved the NJMap.mxd file in the NJ_Project folder rather than the 
mgisdata\MapDocuments folder. Explain why the NJ_Project folder is a better place. 
  5. Create a new project folder in your gisclass folder. Within it, create a new, empty file 
geodatabase for your home state. 
  6. Examine each of the feature classes in the usdata geodatabase and decide which ones can be 
exported to your geodatabase using a table query and which require clipping. List each feature 
class and state either “clip” or the appropriate query expression. 
  7. Add each of the data sets from #6 to ArcMap. Set the data frame coordinate system to an 
appropriate State Plane zone in the State Plane > NAD 1983 (meters) folder. If there is more 
than one zone for your state, just pick one, preferably the central one. State which State Plane 
zone you chose to use.

GIS Concepts 
About coordinate systems 
A successful GIS system depends in large part on managing coordinate systems correctly, and a 
person’s skill (or lack of it) can make the difference between usable and trashed data. Coordinate 
systems are also a vast and complex topic. Experience working with coordinate systems and 
regular review of these concepts will ultimately provide a sound basis for effectively working 
with coordinates. 
In order to display and analyze maps on the screen, a GIS system uses coordinate pairs, which 
specify the location and shape of a particular feature. A point is described by a single x-y 
coordinate pair located in space; a line is a series of x-y coordinates. A coordinate space is an 
agreed-upon range of coordinates used to portray the features. 
Imagine that a surveyor is mapping an industrial site using typical surveying instruments that 
measure angles, directions, and distances. He may begin at a fence corner at the lower right of the 
complex and assigns that point the coordinates (0, 0). This is the origin of the coordinate space 
(Fig. 3.1). The surveyor then determines that the southwest corner of building A is 175 meters 
east and 200 meters north of the origin, 
and he assigns that corner the coordinates 
(175, 200). The surveyor uses meters to 
record the distances and determine the 
coordinates, thereby establishing meters 
as the map units. The combination of 
origin and map units becomes the 
coordinate space of this map. In this case 
the coordinate space is arbitrary and 
chosen for convenience. 
Now imagine that the surveyor’s 
colleague is surveying another site across 
town. She also chose the corner of her 
site as the origin, but she is measuring 
distances in feet. The two surveyors take 
their drawings back to the office and

decide to create a map showing the location of both sites, so they each transfer the coordinates 
into a GIS. When they plot the sites, however, the two different sites show up in exactly the same 
spot, even though in real life they are several miles apart. This problem occurs because both 
surveyors used an arbitrary (0, 0) origin unrelated to the other site. Moreover, the woman’s 
buildings look about three times as large as the man’s buildings because she is measuring in feet 
instead of meters. To plot these together the two surveyors would need to define a single common 
origin and convert both sites to the same map units. 
To avoid problems such as this, geographers and map creators usually employ a standard 
coordinate system (CS), a coordinate space whose characteristics are defined and established 
according to cartographic standards. The surveyors could have used a global positioning system 
(GPS) instrument to establish the x-y coordinates of their origins in a common coordinate system, 
such as Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), and then entered their surveyed points relative to 
that base. Then their maps would have been located correctly with respect to each other. 
 
Geographic coordinate systems 
One commonly used coordinate system is based on measuring angles from the center of the earth 
and has units of degrees (Fig. 3.2). Longitude measures horizontal angles east or west of the 
Prime Meridian, which is the line where longitude equals 0 that passes through Greenwich, 
England. Longitudes fall in the range –180 to +180. Latitude measures vertical angles above or 
below the equator, which has latitude equal to 0, and range from –90 at the South Pole to +90 at 
the North Pole. This system of measurement is called a geographic coordinate system, or GCS. 
A GCS location is determined when the vector defined by a latitude-longitude pair intersects the 
surface of the earth. But what surface? Because the earth’s shape is irregular, its surface can only 
be approximated, and the difference between the true shape and the approximate shape is a source 
of positional errors. For this reason, different approximations have been developed to meet 
specific mapping needs, each one representing a slightly different shape for the earth. Such an 
approximation is called a datum. 
How is a datum defined? The earth’s rotation causes it to bulge at the equator, so the first task is 
to model the earth’s surface using a smooth figure called a spheroid, an oblong sphere with a 
Fig. 3.2. Longitude measures E-W angles in the plane of the equator; latitude measures N-S 
angles above or below the plane of the equator.

major and a minor axis. (The bulge in Figure 3.3 is highly exaggerated.) The chosen spheroid 
becomes a part of the datum definition. (Some people use the term ellipsoid rather than spheroid.) 
Different spheroids have been used in the past because estimates of the earth’s major and minor 
axes have varied over time. Clarke 1886 was a common spheroid used in North America, but it is 
being replaced by more recent and accurate satellite-measured spheroids. 
 
However, a spheroid does not adequately represent the shape of the earth either, so a second 
correction is made. The closest approximation to the earth’s shape is the geoid (Fig. 3.3), an 
irregular, equipotential surface based on gravity. Sea level varies from place to place due to 
rotational, topographic, and compositional differences in the earth’s mantle, and the geoid is often 
described as what the shape of the earth would be if there were only seas and no continents. The 
geoid can be modeled mathematically, but the equations are too computationally intensive to 
serve well as the basis for mapping. Instead, the spheroid is shifted relative to the geoid until a 
best-fit solution is obtained (Fig. 3.3). A datum, then, consists of the chosen spheroid and the 
location of its center relative to the geoid center. 
A datum that finds the best fit overall is called an earth-centered datum. The World Geodetic 
Survey of 1984 is an earth-centered datum based on the WGS 1984 spheroid and is commonly 
used for international data sets and web maps. It is the default datum for most GPS units. 
Another approach is to find the best fit of the spheroid to the geoid for a particular region, such as 
North America, to produce a local datum. The improved fit in one place, however, often means a 
poorer fit elsewhere, so a local datum should be used only in the regions for which it was 
developed. The North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 1927) is based on the Clarke 1866 
spheroid. The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 
1983) is based on the more accurate GRS 1980 
spheroid. Both datums use a network of surveyed 
benchmarks to further customize the fit and provide 
more accurate positions; this approach is often 
employed for local datums. Coordinates stored using 
NAD 1927 and NAD 1983 can differ by up to several 
hundred meters, which, although not significant for a 
national map, can cause serious registration issues for 
larger-scale maps. Figure 3.4 shows the offset between 
an image stored using NAD 1983 and roads stored 
using NAD 1927. 
Adjustments of NAD 1983, based on better and better 
surveying of the benchmarks, take place periodically

and may be used for very high-precision surveying applications when 
differences on the order of centimeters are important. Such 
adjustments have names such as CORS96, HARN, and NSRS2007. 
However, unless you have been told that you are using one of these 
specialized NAD adjustments, it is best to choose the standard datum, 
NAD 1983. 
The datum forms the base definition of a geographic coordinate system (GCS) used to store 
locations in degrees of latitude and longitude. The same place will have slightly different values 
of latitude and longitude depending on which datum was used. The GCS typically takes its name 
from its defining datum and, to many, the terms datum and GCS are interchangeable. 
At times it is necessary to convert from one datum to another; the process is called datum 
transformation. It does not always use exact mathematical formulas and may require localized 
estimates and fitting. Often, multiple methods are available. The transformation itself may 
introduce new errors in coordinate locations, on the order of several meters, so it is not desirable 
to transform GIS data back and forth repeatedly and multiply these errors. Usually, one picks the 
datum to be used for a project (or organization) and sticks with it, converting data once at the 
time they are brought into the geodatabase, using the best available transformation. 
Map projections 
A GCS is a three-dimensional coordinate system, but maps need to be flat. Therefore, 
cartography requires converting the locations on a globe to locations on a piece of paper. This 
process is called projection. One starts with a defined GCS and applies a set of mathematical 
formulas that convert degrees of latitude and longitude 
into planar x-y coordinates on the paper. During this 
conversion the three-dimensional GCS becomes a two-
dimensional representation, and degrees are converted 
into feet or meters. The chosen earth shape (the GCS) 
influences exactly where locations end up on the paper, 
so the GCS is inherited by the projection and becomes a 
part of its definition. 
You can imagine the projection process visually as a 
clear globe with the graticules of the earth printed in 
black. If you place a light bulb at the center of the earth 
and wrap a piece of paper around the equator in the shape 
of a cylinder (Fig. 3.5), the graticules will be cast as 
shadows on the paper. Tracing them gives you a map, 
which you can unroll and lay flat. 
Projections are grouped into three major classes, depending on the shape of the surface onto 
which the GCS locations are projected. A cylindrical projection uses a cylindrical surface that 
lies tangent to (touches) the earth at the equator along a great circle (Fig. 3.6). Rotating the 
cylinder sideways and making it tangent to the earth along a line of longitude produces a 
transverse projection. An oblique projection places the tangent at an angle. In each case, 
distortion is absent along the tangent and increases away from it. Cylindrical projections typically 
preserve shape or direction at the expense of area and distance.

to planar coordinates

77 
 
A conic projection is based on setting a cone on the 
sphere (Fig. 3.7). If the cone is tangent to the globe along 
a line of latitude, then the projection is a tangent 
projection. The line of tangency is called a standard 
parallel. One can also place the cone through the sphere 
so that it touches in two places—a secant projection. 
Such projections have two standard parallels. (Cylindrical 
projections may also be tangent or secant.) One can also 
place a plane tangent or secant to the sphere, producing an 
azimuthal projection (Fig. 3.8). Other names for this 
method are stereographic and orthographic projection. 
Typically, these projections are used for displaying the 
earth’s poles, and for that reason they are 
sometimes called polar projections. 
Projecting the earth to a plane always incurs 
distortion of the map. Four properties of 
map features may be distorted: area, 
distance, shape, and direction. Usually map 
projections reduce or eliminate certain 
distortions at the expense of the others. 
Maps based on cylindrical projections 
(Fig. 3.9a) typically preserve direction and 
shape at the expense of distance and area. 
Notice that the longitude lines point north-
south, indicating the correct direction, but 
Alaska and Greenland are enlarged. Conic 
projections typically preserve area or 
distance at the expense of direction and 
shape (Fig. 3.9b). The longitude lines no 
longer point north-south, but the areas are 
better preserved. Maps based on azimuthal 
projections also typically preserve areas or 
distances (Fig. 3.9c). The inside front cover 
of the text summarizes some of the more common map projections along with the properties and 
uses of each; full descriptions are provided in the ArcGIS Help.

Chapter 3 
78 
In any projection, no distortion occurs where the globe touches the 
cylinder, cone, or plane. The standard parallels, or the center of an 
azimuthal projection, are thus undistorted in all four properties, and the 
distortion will increase away from these locations. The standard 
parallels of a projection are often selected to minimize distortion over 
the area of interest by dividing it into thirds—a conic projection for an 
Oregon state map might be given standard parallels of about 43° and 45°. 
Map projections have certain properties that 
are used to customize the projection for a 
particular geographic area and purpose; these 
properties are called parameters (Fig. 3.10). 
One parameter is the line of longitude that 
constitutes the central meridian, or x = 0 line 
on the map. The central meridian is chosen 
based on its position near the center of the 
area being mapped. A map of England would 
have a central meridian close to 0 degrees. A 
map of the United States would have a central 
meridian of about –100 degrees, because that 
meridian is close to the center of the 
continental United States. The latitude of 
origin, also sometimes called the reference 
latitude, is the y = 0 line. The equator is often 
used as the reference latitude. The standard parallels are 
also parameters. Maps may also have a false northing or 
false easting (Fig. 3.10). These are arbitrary numbers 
added to the x-y coordinates in order to translate the map 
to a new location in coordinate space. Most often, the 
false easting and northing are used to ensure that all the 
coordinates of the map are positive. 
Raster coordinate systems 
Rasters have coordinate systems and projections just as 
vector feature classes do. Figure 3.11 shows a South 
Dakota elevation raster in a GCS and in a conic 
projection. The shape of the state is different, and you 
need to know the underlying coordinate system to be able 
to align this raster with other data sets. Like vectors, 
rasters can be projected from one coordinate system to 
another, although the algorithms are more complicated. 
Assigning coordinate systems to rasters 
Many rasters are provided with a coordinate system at the outset. However, sometimes a user 
must assign the coordinate system. A raster that has been assigned a real-world coordinate system 
is said to be georeferenced. Two cases commonly occur. 
Case I involves a raster for which the coordinate system is known, but the information has not 
been stored in accessible form. Some image formats store georeferencing information inside a 
header file or in the image itself. Other formats use a world file, which is a six-line text file

containing the parameters needed to georeference the raster. If the georeferencing information is 
missing, the user can create a world file with the appropriate parameters. A description of the 
contents of the world file can be found in the ArcGIS Help. 
TIP: A world file has the first and third characters of the image file extension plus a “w” on the 
end. A .tif file would have a .tfw world file. A .bil file would have a .blw world file. 
Case II involves a raster without a specified coordinate system, such as saved pictures from the 
Internet or a scanned map. The coordinate system is in pixel units from the screen or the scanner 
rather than real-world coordinates in feet or meters. To georeference this raster, the user must 
create ground control points by matching locations on the image to the same locations on 
another image or feature class that has a real-world coordinate system. Road intersections or other 
distinctive features are typically used. A minimum of three points are required, but additional 
pairs typically give a more accurate result. 
Using the point pairs, a mathematical 
transformation is then applied 
(Fig. 3.12). A first-order (affine) 
transformation can translate, rotate, 
and skew the image to match the 
points. For a scanned map with a 
known projection, the affine 
transformation is usually sufficient 
because the shape of the map is already 
fine; it just needs its coordinates 
converted to a new set of x-y values. 
An air photo or satellite image may 
have geometric distortions due to 
topography, focal effects, or lens 
distortions. A map with an unknown 
projection may not exactly match the 
shape of the coordinate system to 
which it is being georeferenced. In these cases, a second-order or third-order transformation 
allows the image to stretch or contract locally for a better fit (rubbersheeting). Rubbersheeting 
requires additional control points. Generally one should use the lowest order of transformation 
that produces an acceptable result. Using a higher order than needed can actually introduce new 
distortions. 
When the transformation equations are applied to the ground control points, an offset is always 
found between the specified locations and the actual locations, due to slight errors in locating the 
points or to differences in shape between the old and new coordinate systems. This offset is 
evaluated by calculating a root mean square error (RMSE), which serves as a measure of the 
accuracy of the transformation. The RMS error is reported in map units of the new coordinate 
system and should be reported in the image metadata. 
To finalize the georeferencing, the user may either save the information to a world file or rectify
the image to create a new image. During rectification, the raster is being converted from one grid 
of cells to another with potentially different sizes and spacing, forcing the cells to be adjusted, or

resampled, described in Chapter 11. Rasters containing categorical data should be resampled with 
the nearest neighbor method, and continuous rasters should be resampled with the bilinear 
method. 
TIP: Georeferencing as a task is fairly easy to learn, but the concepts behind it are complex and 
difficult to cover adequately in this short discussion. For more information, see the ArcGIS Help 
section Fundamentals of georeferencing a raster dataset. 
Projecting rasters 
Projecting rasters is more complicated than projecting vector data. A GCS elevation raster of 
South Dakota (Fig. 3.11a) has a different shape than the raster stored in a State Plane coordinate 
system (Fig. 3.11b); it is clear that resampling of the grid must occur if projecting from GCS to 
State Plane. The GCS map units are in degrees, and the cell size is 30 arc seconds, or 0.008333 
degrees. During projection, the user must specify a new cell size in meters. A degree of latitude at 
the equator is 111.3 km. Thus, the height of the cell is 
0.00833 degrees × 111.3 km/degree = 0.927 km, or about 900 meters. 
The cell is not square because degrees of latitude are not equal to degrees of longitude except at 
the equator. In this case, the resolution in ground units is no better than 900 meters, so 900 should 
be the minimum cell size specified for the output, although it is fine to round the values to 900 or 
1000 meters. 
Resampling rasters typically degrades the accuracy of the raster and may introduce artifacts, so 
projecting the same raster multiple times should be avoided if possible. For best performance and 
quality when viewing multiple coordinate systems, the data frame should be set to match the 
coordinate system of the raster(s) rather than the vector data. 
Common projection systems 
Several projections deserve special description because they are so commonly used. One, the 
GCS, is not actually a projection but is often treated as one. UTM is a family of coordinate 
systems utilized worldwide. State Plane is another such family used within the United States, and 
other countries have similar national or state systems used for large-scale maps. 
Geographic coordinate systems 
As a three-dimensional coordinate system, a GCS cannot, strictly speaking, be displayed on a flat 
map or screen. However, in practice a simple equirectangular projection can be applied, which 
treats degrees as planar distances rather than as angles (Fig. 3.13). Unfortunately, distortions are 
introduced by this practice. On the globe, the latitude lines get shorter at higher latitudes, going to 
zero at the poles, yet in the planar display, these lines are all the same length. The further north or 
south an area is from the equator, the more the map gets distorted. Analysis functions also treat a 
GCS data set as if it were planar, and if a function uses area or distance in its calculations, then 
the results may be incorrect. The GCS is primarily used for distributing data; once chosen the 
user should project it before incorporating it into databases for mapping or analysis. 
TIP: It is inappropriate to use a GCS to portray maps or do spatial analysis, and doing so may 
cause incorrect results.

The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) system 
The UTM system is based on a secant transverse cylindrical projection. Two lines of tangency of 
the cylinder to the sphere fall about 180 km to each side of the central meridian (Fig. 3.14a). A 
zone is defined to include 3 degrees on each side of the central meridian between the 80S and 
84N latitude lines. Since the projection is true along the lines of tangency, the distortion inside the 
zone is minimal. To map different locations, the cylinder is rotated about the globe in 6-degree 
intervals, producing 60 zones around the world. Areas within a single zone have negligible 
distortion in all four properties of shape, direction, distance, and area. 
Each UTM zone has its own central meridian and splits at the equator into a north and south 
component. In order to eliminate negative x-y coordinates, southern zones have a false northing of 
10 million meters, and both northern and southern zones have a false easting of 500,000 meters. 
UTM is convenient because users need only know the zone number and hemisphere. In the 
United States and in ArcGIS, each zone is indicated by a number and the designation N for the 
northern hemisphere or S for the southern hemisphere, for example, UTM Zone 14N. (The 
worldwide UTM system uses letters C to X to represent different latitudinal zones.) Figure 3.14b 
shows the UTM zones of the conterminous United States.

The UTM system is used extensively for US Geological Survey 1:100,000 and 1:24,000 scale 
publications, for county maps, for maps of states within single zones, and for maps covering 
small areas. If the region of interest lies on the boundary between two zones, the user can choose 
the zone containing the larger area to represent the map. This choice may be acceptable if only a 
small area extends out of the zone. If not, State Plane zones may provide a better alternative. 
The State Plane Coordinate System 
The State Plane Coordinate System 
(SPCS) includes an assortment of 
projections developed in the 1930s by the 
U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey for large-
scale mapping in the United States. To 
maintain the desired level of accuracy, 
most states are broken into zones with 
different parameters used to minimize 
distortion in each zone (Fig. 3.15). Like the 
UTM system, an SPCS is identified by its 
name and zone, and distortion is negligible 
within a single zone. 
The SPCS uses three different projections: 
Lambert Conformal Conic, Transverse 
Mercator, and Oblique Mercator. North-
south oriented zones use a Transverse Mercator projection, as it provides the least distortion. 
East-west oriented zones use a Lambert Conformal Conic projection. A state may use more than 
one projection depending on the size and shape of its zones. Alaska has 10 zones and uses all 
three projections. Zones are formally identified using a FIPS code composed of a two-digit state 
code and a two-digit zone code (e.g., FIPS 0407 for Zone 7 of California). Users may refer to 
them informally by state name and zone, for example, California State Plane Zone 7. 
The original SPCS was based on NAD27 and used units of feet. Improvements in surveying 
necessitated the revision of the SPCS in 1983. At that time, it adopted the NAD83 datum and 
metric units. Certain zones were also revised and in some cases eliminated. Even though the 
official units changed from feet to meters, users may specify either unit for both versions of 
SPCS. Additional information about both the State Plane and UTM systems can be found in the 
ArcMap Help (index headings State Plane Coordinate System and UTM). 
State and National Grids 
Some large states define a special coordinate system for statewide maps because a single State 
Plane zone cannot represent it accurately. The Oregon Statewide Lambert coordinate system is 
one example. Many countries define their own coordinate systems for national maps or their own 
systems of projections (similar to State Plane) for local and regional maps. Examples include the 
New Zealand National Grid and the Canada CSRS98 system. A variety of projections, datums, 
and spheroids are employed. ArcMap maintains a collection of these predefined coordinate 
system definitions for use with state and country data. 
Choosing projections 
At the beginning of every GIS project, one of the first tasks is to establish the projection to be used, 
as best practices dictate that all data sets in a project share the same projection and datum. The 
choice impacts which map properties are preserved, and a poor choice may cause incorrect analysis

results. Some guidelines for choosing projections for a project are described below. Preference 
should be given to one of the standard coordinate systems for the sake of interoperability, but if 
none of the existing systems provide the right properties, a user can define a custom projection. 
Maps of the world. Distortions cannot be avoided in small-scale maps, so they must be managed. 
Consider the applications. If distances or areas are to be analyzed as part of the project, then an 
equidistant or equal area map should be chosen. If navigation or wind/water currents are 
important, then preserving direction is critical. If portraying attractive maps is the main goal, then 
a compromise projection might be best. 
Maps of countries or continents. Many countries or regions have one or more projections 
defined for general mapping purposes, such as USA Contiguous Equidistant Conic or Europe 
Albers Equal Area Conic. Some countries have their own defined mapping systems. Like world 
maps, the application determines which properties of the map are important to preserve. 
Maps of states. Smaller states within a single UTM or State Plane zone can use them. Larger 
states require selecting one of the zones; if desired one can modify the central meridian and/or 
parallels of the zone to work better for the entire state. Some states have a statewide projection 
defined, such as Oregon Statewide Lambert. 
Local and regional maps. Any region that fits inside a single UTM or State Plane zone can use 
either. Many countries, such as Canada and Australia, have defined their own mapping systems 
similar to the State Plane system in the United States. The preferred system would place the 
region to be mapped close to the center of the zone, where the distortion is least. However, other 
factors may take precedence, such as the existing coordinate system of one’s data sources, or the 
decision of the agency that oversees the project. 
Sometimes the region to be mapped falls close to a UTM or State Plane zone boundary or spans 
two zones. In this case, a customized coordinate system is desirable. Typically, one starts with a 
UTM or State Plane zone and adjusts the central meridian and/or the standard parallels to 
minimize the distortion. A good rule of thumb is that the central meridian should bisect the map 
extent, and the parallels for secant 
conic maps should divide the north-
south extent into thirds. 
About ArcGIS 
Labeling coordinate systems 
ArcMap is able to display data together 
even when they have different 
projections. This capability relies on 
every data set having a coordinate 
system label, which records the 
characteristics of the coordinate system, 
including the datum and projection 
(Fig. 3.16). This label serves two 
purposes: it documents this information 
about the coordinate system, and it 
helps GIS display and manage the data. 
Making sure that all data sets have 
Fig. 3.16. Coordinate system extent and label 

Chapter 3 
84 
correct coordinate system definitions is a critical step in building a GIS database. Shapefiles store 
the labels in a separate file with a .prj extension. Geodatabases store it within the feature class. 
Rasters must also have coordinate system labels, storing them in various places depending on the 
raster format. In all cases, the coordinate system label is stored and copied as part of the data set. A 
coordinate system may also be stored separately as a file with a .prj extension. These files may be 
created, saved, copied, and used to define the spatial reference for new data sets. 
Data sets may contain unprojected or projected data. If unprojected, the coordinates are stored in 
decimal degrees of latitude and longitude. The feature class coordinate system label would 
include simply the GCS (datum), such as GCS North American 1983. The stored x-y coordinates 
of a data set on the disk would fall in the range –180 to +180 degrees for x and –90 to +90 
degrees for y. The map units would be degrees. 
Projected data have had a map projection applied to them, converting the GCS latitude-longitude 
values to feet or meters in a planar coordinate system. The map units become meters or feet. 
Typically, the x-y values in a projected coordinate system encompass millions or billions of 
meters. The feature class coordinate system definition includes the GCS/datum plus a description 
of the projection and its parameters, such as the central meridian, reference latitude, standard 
parallels, and false easting and northing, as shown in Figure 3.16. 
The coordinate system is part of a larger description called the spatial reference, which includes 
the coordinate system, the X/Y domain, and the resolution. The X/Y domain is the range of 
allowable x-y values that can be stored in a feature class. Storing a world map in degrees requires 
a small domain, since degree values range at most between –180 and +180. Storing a world map 
in feet requires a large domain, because there are more than 115 million feet in the circumference 
of the earth. The resolution represents the underlying accuracy of the values; a resolution of 
0.001 meter means that coordinate values are stored to the nearest thousandth of a meter. 
The extent of the data layer is the range of x-y coordinates of the features actually in the feature 
class. You can view the extent of a data layer in ArcMap using the Source tab of the layer 
properties, as shown in Figure 3.16. This information can help you decide if the layer is projected 
or unprojected. Values between +180 and –180 indicate an unprojected GCS coordinate system 
with map units in degrees, whereas large values indicate a projected coordinate system with units 
of feet or meters. 
A note on terminology 
Many people use the terms coordinate system and projection interchangeably to refer to the 
spatial reference (the complete label) of a data set. Using the terms this way is not strictly correct, 
as a coordinate system is only part of the spatial reference, and a projection simply is a 
mathematical conversion from a 3D to a 2D coordinate system. However, it is a common 
practice, and usually the intended meaning is clear in context. 
Missing coordinate system labels 
Occasionally, a user will encounter a GIS feature class or raster without a coordinate system 
label, and the coordinate system appears as “Unknown” when viewed in ArcMap or ArcCatalog. 
To use the data, the user must determine the actual coordinate system of the data and create a 
label for it. Finding the coordinate system can be a challenge because it usually cannot be 
determined by looking at the data set. The user must find documentation supplied by the data 
provider, such as a Web page or document at the site where the data were downloaded or a 
separate text or document supplied with the data. The user might have to contact the data supplier 

Coordinate Systems 
85 
to determine this information. As a last resort, the user might have to guess one of the more 
commonly used coordinate systems and test whether it is correct. 
Once the coordinate system is known, the user may create the coordinate system label using the 
Define Projection tool in ArcToolbox or by using the XY Coordinate System tab from the 
feature class properties in ArcCatalog. The Define Projection tool labels a data set with a 
coordinate system and allows the user to specify all the coordinate system properties, including 
the GCS, datum, central meridian, and so on. Once defined, the data set is ready for use in 
ArcMap. The same tool is used to define a label for rasters. 
On-the-fly projection 
A data frame may be assigned any desired coordinate system, and then ArcMap will project all 
data in the frame to match. To do this, ArcMap must know the coordinate system of each data set. 
If the data set coordinate system definition is Unknown, then ArcMap will issue a warning 
message and will display the data with whatever coordinates it has. Sometimes it will fortuitously 
match the other data in the frame, but other times it will appear totally out of place. If it matches, 
then you know that the Unknown layer has a coordinate system that is the same as, or at least 
very similar to, the data frame, and you can create a coordinate system label for it. 
ArcMap can adjust differences in datums on the fly, but the user has to select an appropriate 
transformation method, which many users lack the advanced knowledge to do, and the 
transformation can cause new positional errors up to several meters. Therefore, ArcMap does not 
automatically perform datum transformations. The user is warned if a data set is added with a 
different GCS than the data already in the frame, and he or she can then select a transformation if 
desired. For national- or world-scale data, the differences between datums is small compared to 
the accuracy of the data, so no transformation is necessary. For large-scale data in situations 
where high accuracy is needed, the user should consult an expert on transformation methods. 
There is one exception: ArcMap automatically applies a transformation called NADCON if the 
two datums are NAD 1927 and NAD 1983. 
Projecting data 
Usually, GIS projects choose a single coordinate system 
and convert all data to match it. Many organizations 
establish an official projection for their area of interest 
and use it consistently. Outside data from different 
coordinate systems are always converted to the official 
one at the outset, using the Project tool (or the export 
technique introduced in Chapter 2). 
The Project tool is found under the Data Management 
section of the Toolbox (Fig. 3.17). It converts the x-y 
coordinate values in a feature class to a different 
coordinate system and saves them in a new feature class 
with a new coordinate system label. The original data remain unchanged. The original data set 
must have a correctly labeled coordinate system before it is projected. If the label is Unknown, 
the Project tool cannot work. Rasters have their own set of projection tools. 
Troubleshooting coordinate system problems 
A coordinate system problem occurs when two layers should map on top of each other—but 
don’t. They might be off by a few hundred meters or by thousands of miles. Most of these 
Fig. 3.17. The Projection tools 
 

Chapter 3 
86 
problems result from the mislabeling of a data set with the wrong coordinate system. The usual 
remedy is to determine the correct coordinate system and fix the label. 
ArcMap can be used to troubleshoot 
such problems. In Figure 3.18, the user 
is examining the Source tab of the layer 
properties. The extent shows x-y values 
in the range –103.6 to –103.5 for x and 
44.3 to 44.4 for y. These values are 
clearly degrees. However, the label 
underneath lists NAD 1983 UTM Zone 
13N as the coordinate system, and the 
x-y values are listed with meters as the 
map units. The label does not match the 
x-y extent values. So which is correct? 
The x-y values are always correct 
because they are obtained from the 
values stored in the file. This data set 
really is stored in degrees, and the label 
is incorrect. Imagine adding this feature class to a data frame set to the UTM coordinate system. 
ArcMap reads the label and mistakenly concludes that the x-y values are already in UTM meters 
and don’t need to be projected on the fly. The x-y values are plotted in degrees in the UTM 
coordinate space, so they don’t match the other data and appear in a completely different 
location. 
To fix the problem, you must know the correct coordinate system and use Define Projection to 
modify the label. You will need another data set in the same area that is known to be correct so 
that you can compare the results. If the data set aligns with the known one, then you set the label 
correctly. If it is still misaligned, then a different label is needed. 
Data in a GCS are relatively easy to correct because the choice of possible datums is limited. 
Projected data are virtually impossible to guess unless they are in one of the common projections 
or you have some outside information to narrow down the possibilities. 
Define Projection versus Project 
Why would a data set be mislabeled with the wrong coordinate system? The usual culprit is a user 
who does not understand the tools used to manage coordinate systems, and who makes the 
mistake of using Define Projection when he or she should use the Project tool. 
Imagine Frank has a shapefile with GCS coordinates and wants to convert it to a UTM projection 
to match his other data. He carelessly selects the Define Projection tool from ArcToolbox and sets 
the coordinate system to UTM. However, the tool merely puts a UTM label on the shapefile 
without changing the coordinates inside. So now the shapefile is incorrectly labeled UTM and the 
coordinates inside are still in a GCS. (This situation is analogous to placing an albacore tuna label 
on a can of cat food, with disastrous results to your dinner recipe.) When the data are added to 
ArcMap, it will choose the wrong equations to convert the data to the data frame of the coordinate 
system, and the feature class will no longer appear where it should.

WARNING: Many people get confused about the functions of the Define Projection tool and the 
Project tool. This confusion can ruin data sets, so pay attention to the next two paragraphs and 
then be careful to select the correct tool for the task at hand. 
The Project tool acts on the x-y coordinates of a layer and converts them to a different coordinate 
system, producing a new feature class and leaving the original feature class unchanged. The new 
file has a new coordinate system and label. You use the Project tool if you have a layer in one 
coordinate system and want to convert it to a different one. The Project tool should be used only 
on layers that already work properly and appear in the right location. 
The Define Projection tool changes the coordinate system label of the feature class without 
affecting the coordinates inside. It should only be used on a data set that has an Unknown 
coordinate system or on a data set that was previously mislabeled, does not appear in the right 
location, and needs to be fixed. 
Summary 
¾ All GIS data have coordinate systems, which define the units and axes used to represent map 
features as x-y coordinates. The complete definition is called the spatial reference. 
¾ A geographic coordinate system, or GCS, uses angular measures of latitude and longitude 
with units of degrees. It is based on an approximation of the earth’s shape known as a datum. 
¾ A datum includes a spheroid and its location relative to the earth’s geoid. It is used to reduce 
map errors introduced by differences between the spheroid and the earth’s actual surface. 
Common datums in North America include NAD 1927, NAD 1983, and WGS 1984. 
¾ Data for a project should be stored in a common GCS. Transforming from one datum to 
another should be minimized because the process may introduce new positional errors. 
¾ Map projections are mathematical equations that convert degrees from a GCS into planar x-y 
coordinates of meters and feet so that the map may be portrayed on a flat sheet of paper. All 
map projections introduce distortions of area, distance, direction, and shape. 
¾ Rasters also have coordinate systems. Assigning coordinate systems to rasters may involve 
creating world files for them or georeferencing them based on control points. 
¾ UTM and State Plane are common projection systems in the United States. Each is a family 
of projections designed to minimize distortion over the area covered (a zone). 
¾ Every data set used in ArcGIS should have the correct coordinate system defined and stored 
with the map features. ArcGIS uses these definitions to display data correctly. 
¾ Most coordinate system problems result from missing or incorrect labels on data sets. The 
Define Projection tool is used to update a data set with an undefined or incorrect label. 
¾ Data may be permanently projected from one coordinate system to another using the Project 
tool or Project Raster tool in ArcToolbox. 
TIP: The ArcGIS Help section also has some good material about projections.

Mercator is a cylindrical projection. The central meridian where x = 0 corresponds with the Prime 
Meridian that runs through Greenwich, England. The y = 0 line is the equator and is called the 
latitude of origin. Coordinates west of the central meridian and south of the reference latitude 
have negative values. Florida is west of the central meridian; its x coordinates are negative.

datum transformation for you. Will it do so in 
this case? Why or why not? 
7Î Close the Help window, if necessary, 
and click the Transformations button.

7Î Click the Using: drop-down and examine the long list of transformation choices 
available. 
Converting between datums is more complex than changing projections and requires knowledge 
beyond that of the typical user. This complexity is one reason it is advisable to assemble data 
sets using a single GCS so that the appearance of this window is rare. In this case, however, we 
are looking at world data. The difference between datums is never more than a few hundred 
meters, which would not be noticeable at this scale. Therefore, we will not apply a 
transformation. 
7Î Click Cancel. 
7Î Check the box Don’t warn me again in this session and click Close. 
 
8Î Double-click the states layer and view the Source tab in the layer properties. 
The states feature class is stored in the North America Equidistant Conic projection.  
Even though the CS is different from the other layers, they all align properly because each has a 
correct coordinate system label, so ArcMap projects them on the fly. 
  9. What longitude is the central meridian? _________What is the latitude of origin? _________ 
What are the standard parallels? ________ and ________. 
10. Examine the standard parallels and the latitude of origin, and predict whether any areas of the 
United States have negative y coordinates in this projection. ______ Why or why not? 
11. Is this Equidistant Conic projection a tangent or secant projection? _____________________ 
How can you tell? __________________________ 
8Î Close the layer properties, and open the data frame properties. 
8Î Use the Coordinate System tab to set the data frame to the North America Equidistant 
Conic projection (in the Continental folder). 
The world map looks bizarre, but remember, this CS is designed for North America. 
9Î Zoom in to North America (includes Central America). 
9Î Right-click the latlong layer and choose Label Features. 
9Î Find the central meridian, the standard parallels, and latitude of origin on the map. 
Understanding map distortion 
The circumference of the world at the equator is ~25,000 miles. The circumference at the poles is 
zero. Latitudes in between have intermediate lengths. Let’s look again at the WGS 1984 GCS. 
10Î Open the World data frame properties 
and select the Coordinate System tab. 
10Î Collapse all the folders until only the 
main four are shown. 
10Î Expand the Layers folder. 
 
 

Chapter 3 
92 
The Layers folder shows coordinate systems of layers in the map document. 
10Î Expand the + sign next to GCS_WGS_1984 and North_America_Equidistant_ 
Conic to see which layers have these coordinate systems. 
10Î Click the GCS_WGS_1984 entry to set the data frame to that CS and click OK. 
10Î Click the Full Extent button to show the whole world again. 
10Î Right-click the latlong layer and choose Label Features to turn them off again. 
When a GCS data set is displayed, the angular units are drawn in an equirectangular projection, as 
if the degrees were a planar x-y coordinate system from x = –180 to +180 and y = –90 to +90. 
Distances are increasingly distorted away from the equator. 
11Î Add the circles shapefile from the mgisdata\World folder. 
11Î Drag the circles above the latlong layer in the Table of Contents 
(switch to the List by Drawing Order option, if necessary). 
Each circle has a radius of 5 degrees, and they would appear identical on a globe, but here the 
distance distortion of the GCS map is clearly shown. The areas and distances, if determined from 
these circles, would be incorrect over most of the globe. Any GIS analysis based on distance or 
area measurements would be wrong when data are stored in a GCS. 
12Î Open the World data frame properties. Move the window so that you can leave it 
open and still see the map. 
12Î Collapse/expand the folders to select the Projected Coordinate Systems > World > 
Mercator (world) projection. Click Apply. 
Area and distance are also distorted in this projection, except at the equator where the sphere 
touches the paper. However, Mercator does preserve direction and shape. The circles remain 
circles, and the longitude meridians point north. 
13Î Change the coordinate system of the frame to Robinson (world). Click Apply. 
Robinson is called a compromise projection because it minimizes distortion in all four properties 
but preserves none. Distortion is unavoidable when using small-scale world and national maps. 
14Î Change the coordinate system to Sinusoidal (world). Click Apply. 
Sinusoidal is an equal-area projection, meaning that it preserves area and, to some extent, 
distance. However, it does so at the expense of shape and direction. The longitude lines converge 
toward the poles, and the circles have equivalent areas now, but most are no longer circles. The 
distortion gets worse away from the equator and the central meridian. 
15Î Change the coordinate system to Africa Sinusoidal in the Continental folder. Click 
OK to accept the change and close the window, and then zoom to Africa. 
Although globally the sinusoidal project shows great distortion, when customized for the region 
of Africa it does a pretty good job with area and distance, although a direction distortion is 
apparent. For even smaller areas, UTM is a good choice.

16Î Open the data frame properties again. 
16Î Collapse the Continental folder and expand the UTM folder. Navigate to UTM > 
WGS 1984 > Northern Hemisphere > WGS 1984 Zone 35N and select it. Click OK. 
16Î Add the shapefile utmzone35 from the mgisdata\World folder. Make the symbol 
hollow with a thick orange outline. 
The narrow strip of UTM Zone 35 runs along the tangent of a transverse cylindrical projection. 
Within the zone, the circles remain circles and all four properties of area, distance, shape, and 
direction are preserved. Areas below the equator would use Zone 35S. 
Converting coordinate systems when compiling data 
When compiling data for a project, it is important to ensure that all data are converted to the same 
suitable coordinate system. In Chapter 2, we created a database for New Jersey, but some of the 
feature classes were not converted to New Jersey State Plane, a poor practice. We will take care 
of this conversion now. 
17Î Save your current map document and open a new, blank one. 
17Î In the Catalog Tree, right-click the njcities feature class in your 
NJ_Project/NewJersey geodatabase and choose Properties. 
17Î Click the XY Coordinate System tab. Look, but DON’T change anything. 
TIP: Be VERY careful not to modify this coordinate system. You are looking at a label that 
describes the x-y data stored in the file. Changing the coordinate system here only makes the 
label incorrect, and the file will no longer display properly. 
17Î Click Cancel to close the Feature Class Properties window, just in case you 
changed something by accident. 
The Project tool is used to convert a feature class from one CS to another by creating a copy in 
the new CS (Fig. 3.21). 
18Î In ArcToolbox, expand 
the Data Management 
Tools > Projections and 
Transformations toolsets. 
18Î Open the Project tool 
(NOT Define Projection) 
by double-clicking it. 
18Î Drag and drop the 
njcities feature class from 
the NewJersey 
geodatabase to the Input 
Dataset or Feature Class 
box. The current CS will 
be shown in the box 
below. 
Fig. 3.21. Projecting a feature class to a new CS 

Chapter 3 
94 
TIP: Notice the default save location in C:\Users. Never allow ArcGIS to save data in this folder; 
you will have trouble finding it again. Always save data in the place you have designated for it. 
18Î Click the Browse button, navigate to the NewJersey geodatabase if necessary, and 
enter the output name for the feature class as njcities_sp. Click Save. 
18Î Click the button to select the Output Coordinate System and navigate to Projected 
Coordinate Systems > State Plane > NAD 1983 
(Meters). Use the plain one. 
18Î Find the NAD 1983 StatePlane New Jersey FIPS 2900 
(Meters) coordinate system and click to highlight it. 
Click OK. 
TIP: Unless specifically told otherwise, always use the basic datum, NAD 1983, and not one of 
the specialized ones like (2011) or (CORS96) or (HARN). If you picked one of these by mistake, 
click the button again and select the correct one. 
18Î Check your entries against Fig. 3.21 and then click OK to start projecting. 
 
19Î Use the Project tool to convert the njdistricts and majroadclip feature classes to State 
Plane also. Name them appropriately and place them in the NewJersey geodatabase. 
 
20Î In the Table of Contents, check the coordinate system of all new data sets AND the 
data frame to make sure they are all now set to the desired State Plane CS. 
We no longer need the original files, so we should delete them. Usually all feature classes in a 
geodatabase should have the same coordinate system. 
21Î Right-click the old njcities feature class in the Catalog Tree and choose Delete. Also 
delete the old njdistricts and majroadclip feature classes. 
TIP: Recall that in Chapter 2 we used ArcMap to export and project in one step using the data 
frame coordinate system. Either method may be used, but exporting in ArcMap is more efficient 
and does not leave extra files that need deletion. 
Troubleshooting projection problems 
The previous examples show how one is supposed to convert coordinate systems when compiling 
data. Unfortunately, the proper procedures are not always followed. This section will help when 
you encounter data sets with impaired coordinate systems caused by improper practices. 
Recall that ArcMap relies on coordinate system labels to perform on-the-fly projection. 
22Î Click the New Map File button to start a new, empty map. Don’t save the current map. 
22Î Add the usfsrds feature class from mgisdata\BlackHills\Sturgis83.mdb\Features. 
22Î Open the layer properties for usfsrds, click the Source tab, and write the coordinate 
system and datum of the layer here: _______________________________ 

Coordinate Systems 
95 
22Î Also examine the Extent information, which shows the range of x-y coordinates as 
stored in the file. Close the Properties window. 
You are working on a project near Sturgis, SD, and have downloaded four new shapefiles to import 
to your geodatabase. You must ensure that each one is converted to the geodatabase coordinate 
system, NAD 1983 UTM Zone 13N. Because not all Internet data is trustworthy, you will do this 
carefully, one shapefile at a time, paying attention to the original and final coordinate systems. 
23Î Add the countyline shapefile from the BlackHills\Downloads folder. 
The first problem surfaces with a warning that this shapefile has an unknown spatial reference. 
You need to determine the coordinate system it is stored in and create a correct label for it. 
23Î Click OK on the warning window. The layer appears in the Table of Contents but 
you can’t find the line on the map. Maybe the symbol is too small? 
23Î Change the symbol for the countyline layer to Highway. Still nothing. 
23Î Right-click the countyline layer and choose Zoom to Layer. 
Well, here is the county line, but it doesn’t 
appear in the same coordinate space as the 
other roads. This error generally results 
from an improper or missing coordinate 
system label. 
24Î Open the properties for 
countyline and click the Source 
tab. 
24Î Examine the coordinate 
system and the extent carefully 
(Fig. 3.22). 
This coordinate system is undefined, as you 
already know. The Extent shows the range 
of x-y coordinates as small numbers, less than 180, which is a sure sign that you are dealing with 
an unprojected coordinate system in degrees, or a GCS. 
So you know to assign a GCS label, but you also need to assign a datum. There is no way to 
know for certain, but NAD83 is the most common datum for US data, so you will try it first. 
25Î Close the Layer Properties window. 
25Î Open ArcToolbox > Data Management > Projections and Transformations > Define 
Projection. 
TIP: You can drag and drop a layer from the Table of Contents to a tool input box, or you can 
use the drop-down on the tool to select a layer. 
25Î Set the input dataset to countyline. 
25Î Click the coordinate system browse button to open the Spatial Reference Properties. 
Fig. 3.22. An unlabeled coordinate system 

Chapter 3 
96 
25Î Expand Geographic Coordinate Systems > North America and select NAD 1983. 
25Î Click the Add to Favorites button, as this GCS is very common. 
25Î Make sure that NAD 1983 is still highlighted and click OK. 
25Î Click OK to run the Define Projection tool. 
 
26Î Click the Full Extent button to return to the view of your study area. 
Now the county line appears on the map. You think that you have solved the problem; however, 
to be absolutely sure, you will check the line against a reliable source. 
26Î Click the Add Data drop-down button and select Add Data From ArcGIS Online. 
26Î Search for topo, and add the USA Topo Maps map service (or LPK file). 
26Î Zoom in to the county line and confirm that it lies on or close to the county line 
between Lawrence and Meade counties on the topographic map. 
26Î Click the Full Extent button to return to the larger view. 
Oops—the zoom goes to the full extent of the map service rather than the Sturgis area. However, 
we can fix this using a property of the data frame that controls how the full extent is defined. 
27Î Open the Layers data frame properties and click the Data Frame tab. 
27Î In the middle panel under Extent Used By Full Extent Command, fill the Other 
button and click Specify Extent. 
27Î Fill the button for Outline of Features and select the usfsrds layer from the drop-
down list. Click OK and OK. 
27Î Click the Full Extent button again. Now it shows the area you want. 
27Î Turn off the USA Topo Maps layer for now, but keep it in the map document. 
So countyline is now correctly labeled, but it is still in a GCS. All the files in your geodatabase 
need to be in NAD 1983 UTM Zone 13N. To convert it, use the Project tool. 
28Î Open the ArcToolbox > Data Management > Projections and Transformations > 
Feature > Project tool. 
28Î Set the input dataset to countyline. 
28Î Click the Browse button and navigate 
to the BlackHills\Sturgis83 geodatabase 
and inside the Features feature dataset. 
28Î Name the output lawmeadline. 
28Î Click the Browse button to set the spatial 
reference and expand the Layers folder. 
28Î Select the NAD_1983_UTM_ 
Zone_13N coordinate system. 
28Î Click the Add to Favorites button to be 
able to use it again later, then click OK to 
use it. 
28Î Confirm that the Project tool arguments 
appear as in Figure 3.23, and click OK. 
Fig. 3.23. Projecting countyline 

Coordinate Systems 
97 
TIP: We used the coordinate system listed in the Layers folder to ensure that the county line’s 
new coordinate system matched the data we already had. 
29Î Remove the original countyline layer and give the new lawmeadline layer the 
Highway symbol. 
29Î Add the quadrangles shapefile from the BlackHills\Downloads folder. 
29Î Open the properties for quadrangles and click the Source tab. 
This shapefile is also missing the spatial reference, but in this case the quadrangles appear in the 
right places. Looking at the Extent, you can see that the values are far too large to be degrees, so 
you are dealing with a projected coordinate system. But which one is it? 
Your clue is that the quadrangles are in the right places. If a data set has no label, then ArcMap 
does not attempt to project it on the fly but simply plots the x-y coordinates in the file. Thus, you 
know that the file coordinate system matches that of the data frame, NAD 1983 UTM Zone 13N, 
and that is what needs to go on the label. 
30Î Close the Layer Properties window. 
30Î Open ArcToolbox > Data Management > Projections and Transformations > Define 
Projection. 
30Î Set the input dataset to quadrangles and choose NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_13N from 
the Favorites folder. Click OK and OK to run the tool. 
30Î Zoom in to check the quad corners against the USA Topo Maps layer, and then turn 
the topo layer off and zoom back to the full extent of the map. 
Now the quadrangles coordinate system is labeled, and it already matches our geodatabase 
coordinate system, so we don’t need to project it, only export it to the geodatabase. 
31Î Right-click the quadrangles layer and choose Data > Export Data. 
31Î Navigate to BlackHills\Sturgis83\Features. Enter the output file name fourquads. 
31Î Notice the coordinate system setting and click OK. Add the new feature class. 
31Î Remove quadrangles from the Table of Contents. 
TIP: Recall that a feature dataset has a coordinate system and all the feature classes inside must 
match it. When we export it, the quadrangles feature class is automatically projected to the same 
coordinate system as the feature dataset. 
It’s time for the next shapefile. 
32Î Add the townships shapefile from the BlackHills\Downloads folder. 
32Î Nothing appears in the map. Open its layer properties and examine the Source tab 
(Fig. 3.24). 

Chapter 3 
98 
This one is interesting. According to the 
Data Source, the coordinate system is 
NAD 1983 UTM Zone 13N, but the 
Extent values are small and appear to be 
in degrees (Fig. 3.24). We have a 
disagreement between the extent and the 
label. Which one is correct? 
TIP: The Extent x-y values show the 
values actually in the file and are the best 
guide to the true coordinate system. 
This GCS data set is incorrectly labeled as 
a UTM data set. To fix it, you must re-
label it with a GCS label. 
32Î Close the Layer Properties window. 
 
33Î Open the Define Projection tool. 
33Î Set the input data set to townships. A warning icon appears on the tool because it 
already has a label. Ignore it—you know that the label must be corrected. 
33Î Click the Browse button and select the NAD 1983 coordinate system from the 
Favorites folder. Click OK and OK. 
33Î The townships appear in the map now. Give them a hollow, thick green symbol. 
33ÎCheck them against USA Topo Maps, These are not quite as accurate, but they are 
close enough. They probably had a source scale smaller than 1:24,000. 
Now they are correctly located, but the townships shapefile is still in a GCS, and it needs to be 
projected to UTM. 
34Î Right-click townships and use Data > Export data to save them in the Features 
feature dataset. They will be automatically projected as before. Save them with the 
name townships. Add the new feature class and remove the original one. 
 
35Î Zoom to the full extent and turn off the townships layer. 
35Î Add the benchmarks shapefile from the Downloads folder and give it the Triangle 3 
symbol. You get a warning, but the benchmarks appear on the map. 
35Î Open the properties for benchmarks and click the Source tab. Examine it. 
It is another undefined coordinate system, but it appears to be in UTM because the benchmarks 
show up in the right spots. You just need to set the label as before. 
36Î Close the Layer Properties window. 
36Î Open the Define Projection tool and set the input data set to benchmarks. 
36Î Browse and select NAD 1983 UTM Zone 13N. Click OK and OK. 
36Î Zoom in and compare several benchmarks to the USA Topo Maps layer 
(benchmarks are shown with a small triangle or x and an elevation). 
Fig. 3.24. Incorrectly labeled GCS shapefile 

Coordinate Systems 
99 
This time you notice something odd. These benchmarks appear several 
hundred meters south of the benchmarks in the topo map. Something is 
still wrong. An offset of this magnitude is most likely to be a datum 
mismatch. You surmise that perhaps benchmarks was in the NAD 1927 
datum, and so the label you assigned was not correct. To test your theory, 
you will reassign the label. 
37Î Open the Define Projection tool again and set the input data 
to benchmarks. 
37Î Browse in the Projected Coordinate Systems > UTM > NAD 1927 folder and select 
the NAD 1927 UTM Zone 13N coordinate system. Click OK and OK. 
37Î Compare the benchmark locations to the USA Topo Maps layer again. 
You were right. With the NAD 1927 UTM label assigned, the benchmarks now appear where 
they should. However, you want all your data in the geodatabase to be in the same coordinate 
system, so you still need to project this file from NAD 1927 UTM to NAD 1983 UTM. This time 
we will use the Project tool in order to specify the datum transformation. 
38Î Open the Project tool and set the input to benchmarks. 
38Î Save the output in the Features feature dataset as benchmarks83. 
38Î NAD 1983 UTM Zone 13N is already selected for saving into the feature dataset. 
Notice that this time a transformation method is entered to 
convert the NAD 1927 datum to NAD 1983. The best one is 
chosen for you, NADCON. 
38Î Click OK to run the tool. 
 
39Î Remove benchmarks and give benchmarks83 
the Triangle 3 symbol. 
39Î Zoom to the full extent and turn off USA Topo 
Maps. 
You have successfully solved each coordinate system 
problem encountered and added four feature classes to your 
geodatabase in the appropriate coordinate system (Fig. 3.25). 
These techniques serve you well when you are downloading 
and compiling data for a project and encounter a data set that 
has coordinate system problems. 
Creating a custom coordinate system 
Sometimes you don’t have a predefined coordinate system for the area you are working on and 
need to define a custom one. Imagine creating a geodatabase for Turkey to display the general 
features with no need for equal areas or equal distances. A search of the available coordinate 
systems in ArcMap yields none specific to Turkey. You begin by choosing a suitable projection. 
40Î Start a new, blank map. Save changes to the previous map document. 
40Î Add the country shapefile from the mgisdata\World folder. 
Fig. 3.25. Final layers 

Chapter 3 
100 
 
41Î Open the attribute table for country and use the Select by Attributes button to select 
Turkey. Close the table. 
41Î Right-click the country layer and choose Selection > Create Layer From Selected 
Features. 
41ÎThe layer appears in the Table of Contents. Rename it Turkey and zoom in. 
 
42Î Open the Layers data frame properties and click the Coordinate System tab. 
42Î Type turkey in the search box and click the Search button. 
42Î Expand the Projected Coordinate Systems > Gauss Kruger folder and the Turkey 
subfolder. Seven different zones are suggested. 
42Î Expand the National Grids folder and the Turkey subfolder. A number of coordinate 
systems are in here. Click several of them just to see their parameters. 
42Î Close the data frame properties window. 
The predefined coordinate systems in ArcMap are all based on the Gauss Kruger projection 
(which is another name for Transverse Mercator). We know that this projection is best for north-
south-oriented areas, but Turkey is oriented east-west and is too wide for a single TM zone. Our 
best bet will be to design our own coordinate system based on a conic projection, with a central 
meridian in the center of Turkey, and standard 
parallels that cut it into approximate thirds. 
43Î Find the approximate central 
longitude and range of latitudes of 
Turkey using the cursor and reading the 
values from the location display. 
Central longitude ________ 
Southern latitude ________  
Northern latitude_______ 
Armed with this information, we can now define a 
custom coordinate system, which we will base on 
the Lambert Conformal Conic projection. 
44Î Open the data frame properties and 
click the Coordinate System tab. 
44Î Click the Add Coordinate System 
drop-down button and select New > 
Projected Coordinate System. 
44Î Enter Turkey Lambert Conformal 
Conic WGS84 as the name (Fig. 3.26). 
44Î Choose Lambert_Conformal_ Conic 
from the drop-down list for the 
projection name. 
44Î Carefully change the Central_ 
Meridian to 35 degrees. 
Fig. 3.26. A custom coordinate system 

Coordinate Systems 
101 
44Î Set Standard_Parallel_1 to 37.5 degrees. Set Standard Parallel_2 to 39.5 degrees. 
44Î The Geographic Coordinate System defaulted to the data frame GCS, WGS 1984. 
Leave it. 
44Î Click OK and OK. 
The map looks fine. Now that we are sure that this coordinate system is acceptable, we can save 
the projection file to use again. 
45Î Open the data frame properties again. 
45Î Right-click the new coordinate system in the Custom folder and choose Save As. 
45Î Navigate to the World folder and save the .prj file using the suggested name. 
45Î Close the data frame properties. 
TIP: To use the .prj file, click the Add Coordinate System drop-down and choose Import. You 
can open it in Notepad if you want to see what it looks like—it is a text file. 
Georeferencing a raster 
In this section, you will download an image from the Internet and georeference it. If you don’t 
have Internet access or if you have trouble obtaining an image, use the nwsradar_sample.gif 
image stored in the mgisdata\Usa folder. Your Web browser instructions might be slightly 
different if you are not using the Internet Explorer Web browser. 
46Î Open your Web browser and go to http://www.nws.noaa.gov/radar_tab.php. 
When georeferencing, you want to use a coordinate system that is as close as possible to the one 
in the image. Try to identify this one. Use the inside front cover of the book to make 
comparisons, if you wish. 
12. On what type of projection does the map appear to be based? ______________ 
46Î Click on Full resolution version. 
46Î Right-click the enlarged image and choose Save Picture As. (If a polygon appears 
instead of a menu, right-click again inside the polygon to bring up the menu.) 
46Î Navigate to your mgisdata\Usa folder and save the image as a GIF file. Name it 
nwsradar.gif. 
 
47Î Create an Item Description for the raster, using the information from the web page. 
Remember to include a citation in the Credits section. 
TIP: ArcGIS 10 and 10.1 had a bug in that raster Item Descriptions were not actually saved. If 
the Item Description goes blank again after you save it, don’t worry, and don’t try to do it again. 
48Î Open a new map document and add the states feature class from the 
mgisdata\Usa\usdata geodatabase. You don’t need to save the current one. 

Chapter 3 
102 
To georeference the image, you must set the data frame to the coordinate system the image uses, 
in this case, a GCS. You will assume it is NAD 1983, the most common US datum. 
48Î Change the data frame coordinate system to NAD 1983 from the Favorites folder. 
48Î Zoom to the full extent to see the states layer again, if necessary. 
48Î Switch back to the browser for a moment and compare the shapes of the states in 
ArcMap and in the image. They appear similar. 
48Î Close the browser window and return to ArcMap. 
 
49Î Zoom in to the conterminous states so that the image and the map window are 
showing a similar map extent. This will facilitate finding control points. 
49Î Change the symbol for the states so that it is hollow with a high-contrast outline 
color, such as hot pink. It needs to show up well against the image. 
49Î Choose Customize > Toolbars > Georeferencing from the main menu bar. 
49Î Click on Add Data and add the nwsradar.gif image from the Usa folder. Click OK if 
you get a warning or are asked to build pyramids. 
The image does not appear yet because it is in a different coordinate system than the map. You 
begin by bringing the image into the same map extent as the states, which will make it easier to 
match control points. 
50Î On the Georeferencing toolbar, choose Georeferencing > Fit to Display. The 
ArcMap session should look similar to Figure 3.27. 
The points work best if they are spread around 
the map. You will first add two at diagonal 
corners and then two near the other corners. If 
the state corners or boundaries are obscured by 
the radar colors on your map, choose another 
point that is close by and clearly visible. 
50Î Locate the southwestern corner of 
California and mentally match the 
corner of the state outline on the 
image to the corner of the pink state 
outline on the map. 
50Î Use the Zoom In tool to zoom in 
to an area containing the two 
matching points. 
50Î Click the Add Control Points tool on the Georeferencing toolbar. 
50Î Carefully click the corner on the image first and then click the corresponding corner 
on the states map. ArcMap will help by snapping to the vertex of the state polygon. 
This is your first control point. 
50Î Notice that the map updated after you added the control point so that the corner of 
California is better aligned. 
Fig. 3.27. Ready to begin georeferencing 

Coordinate Systems 
103 
TIP: The pairs of control points must always be added in the same order, starting with the 
ungeoreferenced image, and then the states. 
51Î Zoom to the previous extent, and then zoom in to the New England region. 
51Î Mentally locate a matching point on the Maine state boundary. 
51Î Switch back to the Add Control Points tool. 
51Î Click the location on the image first and then click the corresponding location on 
the states map. Notice that your control points are being numbered. 
The match will already look much better, indicating that you chose an appropriate coordinate 
system. Continue switching between the Zoom and Control Point tools to add the next points, 
even if they are almost identical. You need at least three points for an affine transformation. Be 
careful not to snap to a state vertex when adding an image point. 
52Î Add a control point on the Florida peninsula. Click the image first! 
52Î Add a control point in the Pacific Northwest. Click the image first! 
Examine the map and locate any areas where the state boundaries are still poorly aligned. These 
areas should receive additional control points. If you don’t see any at the national scale, zoom in 
to a couple of locations in the middle of the country to check. 
53Î Zoom to the state corner between Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah. Add a point, if 
necessary (image first). 
53Î Zoom to the western corner of Kentucky. Add a point, if necessary (image first). 
For many maps, you would continue to add more control points in misaligned areas until you no 
longer saw any improvement when new points were added. 
54Î Click on the View Link Table button to see the points you’ve added. 
The points are listed in the order that you added them (Fig. 3.28), and yours will differ from the 
figure. The X and Y Source fields show the coordinates of each control point in the original 
image units (pixels). The X Map and Y Map columns show the point coordinates in map units 
(degrees). The 1st Order Polynomial (Affine) Transformation method is being used. 
Note the residuals for each point and the total RMS error, reported in map units. In Figure 3.28, 
the residuals range between 0.01 and 0.03 degree, and the RMS error is about 0.02 degree. At the 
equator that error would be about 2 km, a reasonable value for a national map. Yours should be in 
the same range if you entered the control points carefully. 
TIP: A few additional buttons on the link table are handy if you need to 
(from left to right) load a saved set of points, save a set of points, zoom to 
a point, delete a point, or add a new empty point. 
54Î On the Link Table, click the Transformation button. It shows the methods currently 
available with the number of control points you have.

TIP: If the RMS error is large and does not improve when more points are added, try a second-
order transformation. Second-order transformations require more control points.

At this point the image is georeferenced, and the control point information has been saved with it 
as a world file. The next time you open the image, it will appear in the correct location. 
SKILL TIP: Learn how to rectify an image, or permanently save it in the georeferenced

Projecting a raster 
You want to place the georeferenced image in the same coordinate system as the other United 
States data, so we must project it. First, however, estimate the expected resolution of the 
projected raster. Looking at the layer properties Source tab would tell you that the cell size is 
0.017979 degree. One degree of latitude is about 111 km, so the cell size in meters should be 
0.017979 × 111,000 = 1995.7, or about 2000 meters. 
    Î Start with a new, empty map. Don’t save changes to the previous map. 
Remember, you can search for a tool if you don’t remember where it is. 
55Î Click the Search tab to open the Search window (or open and dock it from the main 
menu bar, if necessary).

Mastering the Concepts  
GIS Concepts 
Geographic Information Systems are used for many purposes, but creating maps is one of the 
most common. The practice of cartography, or mapmaking, has a long history. Although a 
computer makes the process easier and offers the ability to explore and edit designs, the 
cartographer must still understand the basic principles behind portraying spatial data and the 
aesthetic challenges in designing an effective and attractive way to communicate ideas.  
Choosing symbols for maps 
Cartographers may choose a variety of strategies for symbolizing features in a map. A data layer 
may simply be portrayed using one symbol, or different features can be assigned different 
symbols depending on the value of an attribute field. Point data are shown using marker symbols, 
line features with linear symbols, and polygon features with shaded area symbols (Fig. 4.1).  
 
Cartographers have many ways to signify differences between features in a map: shape, size, 
thickness, line type, color, pattern, and font (Fig. 4.1). Traditionally these variations are used to 
show either changes in category (the type of thing) or in quantity. Shape, line type, pattern, and 
font are typically used to show changes in category, such as different types of wells (points), 
different classes of roads (lines), or different geologic units (polygons). Size and thickness are 
generally used to indicate increases in quantity, such as the population of a city (points) or the 
discharge of a river (lines) (Fig. 4.1). Text symbol variations usually indicate categories (towns

Chapter 4 
108 
versus rivers), although font size can indicate qualitative differences in value, such as town size, 
as long as not too many different sizes are employed. 
Color may be used to indicate either category or quantity. Colors may be designated using one of 
several common methods. The RGB method is based on mixing red, green, and blue light on a 
computer screen. The CMYK method is often used for printing and specifies mixtures of inks 
used in printers or plates (cyan, magenta, yellow, black). The HSV method is instructive for 
discussing the use of color in portraying features on a map. 
HSV stands for hue, saturation, value (Fig. 4.2). Hue 
refers to the shade of color, such as red, blue, or yellow, 
and is established by the wavelength of the light 
observed. Typically it is portrayed as a color wheel so 
that the color values range in degrees from 0 to 360. 
Saturation corresponds to the intensity of the color and 
is measured as a percentage. Imagine mixing a can of 
paint, starting with a white base and adding a single 
pigment—a small amount of pigment yields a low 
saturation but a large amount of pigment results in high 
saturation. Value refers to how light or dark the color 
is, transitioning from the full color to black. Value is 
also measured as a percentage. Any color can be 
defined using a combination of the three properties. 
The set of colors chosen for a map layer should follow 
certain guidelines. Figure 4.3 shows three different sets 
of five colors. A set based on variations in hue should 
be used to depict changes in category, such as different 
soil units (Fig. 4.3a). For categories, the saturation and 
value of the colors should be similar. Quantities are 
generally indicated using differences in saturation and/or 
value, with light or unsaturated colors indicating lower 
quantities and darker or more intense colors indicating 
higher quantities (Fig. 4.3b). Sometimes a divergent color 
set is helpful in showing variation around a significant 
middle value (Fig. 4.3c); for example, a climate change 
map showing increases or decreases of temperature from 
current values. Areas with no significant change are shown 
in the middle neutral color, colder temperatures are shown 
in blue, and warmer temperatures are shown in orange. 
The importance of black and white symbol schemes cannot be neglected. In commercial printing 
or copying, color still costs more than black and white. Publishing figures in professional journals 
or reports may also cost significantly more in color. One should consider, too, how most viewers 
will see the map. Figures in a master’s thesis may look wonderful in color, but some of the people 
reading it may receive a black and white copy version from interlibrary loan. There are many 
reasons why one might wish to design a map in black and white at the outset. In a black and 
white map, only four or five different shades of gray are typically discernible, so selecting 
symbols for such maps relies heavily on variations in shape, size, thickness, line type, or pattern 
rather than value.

Combinations of these factors may also be used when specifying symbols, such as using points 
that change in both shape and color, polygons that change color and pattern, or text that has 
differences in size and font and style. However, combinations should be used sparingly, as the 
more complex and varied the symbols become, the more difficult it may be to interpret them. In 
Figure 4.4, both volcanoes and highways are shown using combinations of color, shape, and size 
(thickness). The combinations serve to accentuate differences within the layer, and could be used 
to emphasize one type of feature, such as using a larger, saturated pink symbol to call attention to 
the stratovolcanoes. However, this strategy would backfire if multiple point layers were being 
displayed, as it would become difficult to interpret which features belong to which point layer. 
 
Color choice is complicated by the fact that about 10% of men and 1% of women are color blind. 
Different types of color blindness are possible, although red-green color blindness is the most 
common. If layers are being symbolized for data exploration by one person, then the user may 
employ any set of colors that aids interpretation of the data. However, if the maps are intended for 
use by many people, it is better to avoid red-green color sets and rely on saturation, value, pattern, 
and shape variations instead. If divergent colors or multiple hues are needed, combinations such 
as brown-purple or orange-blue can be interpreted by most color-blind viewers. 
Cartographers also need to be sensitive to conventions and connotations associated with different 
colors or symbols. A convention refers to the use of a particular color or symbol in a commonly 
understood way; for example, using blue for displaying water, blue-red for contrasting cold-heat, 
or a blue cross to indicate a hospital. Using conventional symbols aids interpretation of the map. 
Connotation is an emotional or psychological impact associated with a particular symbol, such 
as the color red indicating danger, or red-white-blue evoking feelings of patriotism. However, 
connotations are often culturally specific. Red may indicate danger in the United States, but is 
associated with joy in Thailand, or national pride in China. Making maps for an international 
audience demands particular care and knowledge in the choice of colors and symbols. Context 
can matter as well; even in the United States, a red-green map at Christmas might engender more 
joy than fear. 
Types of data and types of maps 
Geographers, statisticians, and others characterize measurements or attributes as belonging to one 
of a set of data types: nominal, categorical, ordinal, interval, or ratio. The type of data affects 
how it should be stored in a database and what types of analyses or statistics are appropriate. In 
mapping, the data type also influences the kind of map used to display the feature attributes. 
Nominal data name or identify objects, such as the name of a state. Nearly every feature will 
have a different name. Nominal data are often text values but they don’t have to be: a parcel 
number or a tax identification number also serves the purpose of uniquely identifying an object. 
Fig. 4.4. Examples of categorical data representation for points, lines, and polygons 

Chapter 4 
110 
The US Census uses such data in its Federal Information Processing Standards Codes, or FIPS 
codes. Each state, county, city, block, and so on is assigned a unique identifying number that is 
consistent from product to product. Nominal data are usually portrayed on a map by labels. Each 
layer typically has one text symbol, but different text symbols may be used to accentuate different 
layers, such as using all uppercase for state names or italic blue text for rivers. 
Categorical data separate features into distinct groups or classes. Figure 4.4 shows examples of 
categorical data for point features (volcano type), linear features (road class), and polygon 
features (land cover). Other examples include soil types, ethnic groups, and geological rock 
formations. Categorical data are often stored as text, but 
it is also possible to represent the categories with 
numeric codes, such as Commercial Services = 20 and 
Industrial = 40. Categorical data are represented by a 
unique values map, which gives each category a 
different symbol based on shape, line type, color, or 
pattern (Fig. 4.5).  
Ordinal data have categories that are ranked based on 
some quantitative measure, although the measure may 
not be linear. For example, urban settlements might be 
classified as villages, towns, or cities. Students are 
assigned grades of A, B, C, D, or F. Soils are designated 
as A, B, C, or D depending on their infiltration. Ordinal 
data must be represented by unique values maps if the 
values are text, but value or saturation should be varied 
rather than hue or pattern so that the quantitative 
increase can be easily interpreted. Numeric ordinal data may be represented either with unique 
values maps or graduated color maps. 
Quantitative data represent phenomena that fall along a regularly spaced measurement scale, such 
as distance or rainfall. Equal changes in interval involve equal changes in the quantity being 
measured. For example, the energy needed to heat a thimble of water from 6 to 7 degrees is the 
same as heating it from 96 to 97 degrees. Ratio data have a meaningful zero point that indicates 
the absence of the thing being measured. Precipitation is an example of ratio data; zero 
precipitation corresponds to a total lack of rain, and two inches of rain is twice as much as one 
inch. Ratio data support all four arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division. Interval data have a regular scale but are not related to a meaningful zero point. 
Temperature data measured in the familiar Celsius or Fahrenheit scale are interval data because a 
temperature of zero does not correspond to a complete lack of temperature (heat energy). Any 
scale that can have negative values, such as elevation, is an interval scale. Interval scales support 
only addition and subtraction. Today’s high temperature of 80 degrees might be hotter than 
yesterday’s high of 40 degrees, but it cannot be said to be twice as hot, except as a figure of 
speech. 
Quantitative numeric data take on values along a continuous scale of possibilities; every state, for 
example, has its own population value. In order to symbolize numeric data, the values must be 
partitioned into groups with specific ranges.These ranges are called classes, and the maps are 
called classified maps. In Figure 4.6, the cities and roads have three classes of values, and 
population density has four classes. Each class is symbolized using variations in symbol size, 
thickness, or color saturation/value.

on geological units

Point or line data are usually displayed by varying symbol size or thickness and are portrayed 
using a graduated symbol map. However, point or line data can also be portrayed using a 
proportional symbol map in which the numeric value is used to proportionally determine the 
size of the symbol. Instead of a few size classes, the map has a continuous range of symbol sizes. 
This style is often referred to as an unclassed map. Figure 4.7 compares graduated symbol and 
proportional symbol maps for the populations of state capitals. 
 
Numeric data classes for polygons are represented using color shaded symbols (Fig. 4.8), called a 
graduated color map, or a choropleth map. The maps are usually symbolized using changes in 
value and/or saturation (monochromatic color ramp) so that the increase in quantity is clear, as 
shown in the county population map in Figure 4.8a. Although rainbow color ramps are popular in 
software packages, using them for graduated color maps is usually a mistake, because it is 
difficult for the mind to interpret hues as representing larger or smaller quantities (Fig. 4.8b). 
Generally the eye cannot distinguish between more than 7–8 levels of the same color, so no more 
than that number of classes should be used. 
The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem 
Data are often summarized, or aggregated, according to arbitrary area units like states or counties, 
and the choice of unit will influence the recorded values. In some cases, such as the number of 
farms or lightning strikes, units with larger areas would tend to have higher values just because they

are larger. In Figure 4.9a, the number of 
farms is greater in the bigger states like Texas 
and California. Certain variables, such as the 
number of home vacancies, are strongly 
linked to population, and maps made from 
them resemble population rather than giving 
insight into underlying causes. In Figure 4.9b, 
the largest and most populous states have the 
most vacancies. 
Another issue that can arise is that larger 
polygons receive greater prominence in  
the map simply because of their size. In 
Figure 4.9, the large western states attract 
more attention than the eastern states. Both of 
these issues are examples of a phenomenon 
known as the Modifiable Areal Unit 
Problem, or MAUP, which occurs when 
measurements are being aggregated over 
arbitrarily defined areas like states. Analyzing 
spatial or statistical patterns becomes more 
difficult, because one is rarely sure how much the 
patterns are affected by the aggregation scheme. 
However, methods to reduce the effects of MAUP 
on maps are available. 
One approach is to normalize the data, dividing 
each value by a specified variable. If one is 
concerned that the size of the aggregation area is 
influencing the magnitude of values, one can divide 
by the feature area as shown in Figure 4.10a, where 
the number of farms is divided by state area 
(compare to Fig. 4.9a). If the values are being 
influenced by population , then one can divide by 
population or other suitable variable, as in 
Figure 4.10b, where the vacancies are divided by 
the number of housing units, giving a far more 
interesting and informative map than Figure 4.9a. 
Another normalization method, less commonly 
used, shows percentages of the total quantity falling 
in each feature; Figure 4.10c shows the percentage 
of Congress controlled by each state, accomplished 
by showing the number of districts in each state as a 
percentage of the total number of districts. 
However, not all attributes need normalization. In 
a precipitation map, each value already represents 
inches of rain falling at any location. The median 
rent for a county does not depend directly on the 
area of the county. These attributes would not be

113 
normalized. Before mapping any attribute, it is important 
to stop and consider how the aggregation unit might 
affect the map and determine whether the values should 
be normalized, and by what. 
The visual MAUP issue, which occurs when large 
polygons dominate the map, can be addressed by 
changing the map type. A graduated symbol map applied 
to polygons places a symbol at the center of each polygon, 
minimizing the visual imbalance, as shown in this 
graduated symbol map of the density of farms (Fig. 4.11a; 
compare to Fig. 10a). A dot density map uses randomly 
placed dots to show the magnitude of a value in the 
attribute table (Fig. 4.11b). Each dot represents a certain 
number; in this map, 2000 farms. Note that the locations 
of the dots, which are randomly placed, do not necessarily 
represent the distribution of farms in the state. 
Chart maps 
A chart map expands the number of attributes that can 
be displayed on a map by replacing a single symbol with 
a chart representing several attributes. The chart could be 
a pie chart, bar chart, or stacked bar 
chart. Figure 4.12 shows a pie chart 
map with the proportions of 
Caucasians, African Americans, and 
Hispanics in each state. The pie sizes 
can be all the same (Fig. 4.12a) or 
proportional to the sum of the three 
categories, thus showing the relative 
number of people in the state as well 
(Fig. 4.12b). Notice how the pie 
colors are chosen to facilitate 
recognition of the classes: cream for 
Caucasians, dark brown for African 
Americans, and reddish for Hispanics. Such details help make maps easier for the reader to 
interpret, and they lessen the need for the reader to look back and forth between the legend and 
the map. 
Displaying rasters  
Recall from Chapter 1 that rasters are a cell-based data model in which an array of cells or pixels 
store numeric values relating to some feature or quantity on the earth’s surface. Rasters may be 
broadly grouped into three main types, each of which is displayed differently: thematic rasters, 
image rasters, and indexed rasters. 
Thematic rasters 
A thematic raster represents features or quantities, such as roads, geology, elevation, or 
vegetation density (Fig. 4.13). When rasters are used to store objects, such as roads or land use 
polygons, they are called discrete rasters. Typically they are created by converting features from

a vector data set to a raster format, using a single attribute field as the value to be placed in the 
cells. Discrete rasters contain groups of adjacent cells with the same value. In contrast, 
continuous rasters store values that represent a continuously varying quantity, such as elevation.  
 
Values in a raster are always stored as numbers and may be characterized as categorical, ordinal, 
or interval/ratio. (Nominal data are usually not stored in rasters—it would be inefficient.) The 
methods used to display thematic rasters are similar to those used for displaying vector data and 
also depend on the data type.  
A raster representing categorical or ordinal data is displayed using a unique values map. Just like 
the unique values map used for feature classes, each value of the raster receives its own color, as 
in the geology map shown in Figure 4.14a. Color schemes for unique values maps have 32 
possible values and work best with data that have relatively few categories. When representing 
ordinal data, a monochromatic color scheme is used to communicate a sense of increase. 
 
A thematic raster containing interval or ratio data must be classified into ranges in one of two 
ways. The classified display method divides the values into a small number of bins, similar to a 
graduated color map. A color ramp is chosen to assign the colors to each bin. The elevation map 
in Figure 4.14b has 12 classes represented by 12 colors from a color ramp. The stretched display 
method scales the image values to a color ramp with 256 shades (Fig. 4.14c). The raster is first 
subjected to a slice, which rescales the elevation values (ranging from 800 to 1600 meters) into 
256 bins, then matches the bins to the 256 shades in the color ramp. You can think of a slice as a 
classification that creates 256 classes.

types. Continuous rasters store data that vary smoothly, such as elevation or rainfall.

The colorful ramps, like those in the elevation rasters in Figure 4.14, ignore the guideline to use 
saturation/value rather than hue to represent quantities, yet the eye has no trouble interpreting the 
elevation increase. Continuous rasters typically represent surfaces with an underlying structure, 
such that low values occur near low values and high ones near high. This structure imposes a 
visual order and allows the eye to interpret the greater number of colors. Such ramps are not 
suitable for features or all rasters, but can be effective when appropriate. 
Image rasters 
Image rasters include aerial photography and satellite data. The pixels represent degrees of 
brightness caused by light reflecting from materials on the surface. The brightness values are 
often placed on a scale of 0–255 DN (digital numbers). A dark shadow would have a low 
brightness and a low DN, and a white cement road would have a high brightness and a high DN. 
 
An image raster may contain one or more bands of information. Imagine a black-and-white 
digital camera that measures brightness and stores a value between 0 and 255 for each pixel on its 
screen. This camera would produce a single-band raster that could be displayed with a grayscale 
color ramp from black to white, as shown in Figure 4.15a. Such images are displayed using the 
same stretched method that is applied to continuous thematic 
rasters. Images based on the 0–255 scale do not need to be 
sliced, but some images contain larger values and do require 
slicing.  
Images typically use the RGB color model to specify colors. 
A color digital camera measures brightness separately for 
three wavelengths of light (red, green, and blue) and stores 
three brightness values for each pixel in three separate bands. 
If the value in the red band is high (close to 255) and the other 
two bands have low values near zero, a bright red color will 
result. If red and green are both high and blue is low, a 
mixture of red and green will create yellow. All colors may be 
represented by varying proportions of red, green, and blue 
light, as dictated by the brightness values in the bands. 
Figure 4.16 shows two possible mixtures and the resulting 
colors.  
To display a multiband color image, an RGB composite method is used. One band is assigned to 
each of the three color guns on the computer monitor (red, green, and blue) to produce a color 
image (Fig. 4.15b) from the brightness levels stored in the three bands.

Many satellites and airborne cameras measure brightness in more than three wavelengths and 
produce more than three bands. Landsat images, for example, have seven or more bands. 
Multiband images also use the RGB composite display method, but any of the bands may be 
applied to the RGB guns on the computer. In Figure 4.15b, the Landsat bands 3, 2, and 1 
representing red, green, and blue light are used, producing a true-color image. In Figure 4.15c, 
bands 7, 4, and 1 are used to contrast green vegetation with dry or urban areas.  
Stretching image values 
Image DN values are often normally distributed. Figure 4.17a shows a typical histogram of cell 
values, with the horizontal axis showing the range of values with the corresponding grayscale 
color ramp, and the vertical axis showing the number of cells for each value (color). The image 
has few values near 0 or 255, with most of the pixels occurring in the middle gray range. The 
image is shown in Figure 4.17b, and it appears dim and featureless with little contrast.  
 
The stretched display method can improve the display of normally distributed values by ignoring 
the tails of the distribution. One method assigns the lowest and highest image values to 0 and  
255, respectively, and stretches the remaining colors along the ramp. This is called a minimum-
maximum stretch. Even greater contrast can be developed using a standard deviation stretch, 
which uses only the values within two standard deviations of the mean (Fig. 4.17c).  
Stretches can be applied to thematic continuous rasters as well as images and can be helpful when 
the image values are not evenly distributed. The RGB composite display method permits the user 
to stretch each individual band. 
Indexed color rasters and colormaps 
The RGB color model is capable of storing 
millions of different colors and is best for 
fine rendering of images. However, it uses 
large amounts of memory. An alternate 
method for storing color identifies a 
restricted set of colors actually appearing in 
the image. It assigns an integer from 0 to 255 
to each color and stores the RGB proportions 
needed to make it. This list of colors is called 
the colormap and is stored with the image. 
Each value in the raster is portrayed using its 
assigned color. Figure 4.18 shows part of a 
Fig. 4.17. The effects of stretching: (a) stretching an image; (b) no stretch applied;

digital raster graphic (DRG). A DRG is a scanned US Geological Survey topographic map. The 
contours are represented by pixels with the value 4 and displayed using the assigned brown color. 
Every pixel value and defined color used in the map is shown in the accompanying colormap: green 
for vegetation, black for text, and so on.  
Indexed color rasters are commonly produced when scanning large color maps. Storing them in 
RGB could use hundreds of megabytes or more. An indexed color map typically uses less than a 
tenth of the space, and the eye cannot easily distinguish between the two. 
Raster pyramids 
Rasters may have a much higher density of cells than can be displayed on a screen at a given 
scale. When this happens, the computer must skim through the raster and pick one cell from a 
larger cluster to display, and this takes time. A common alternative is to build pyramids for the 
raster. A pyramid is constructed by resampling: taking a group of adjacent cells, commonly four, 
merging them to form a single new pixel, and 
selecting one value to represent the original 
group (Fig. 4.19). The resampled cells are used 
to create a raster half the size and with lower 
resolution than the original. The procedure is 
repeated to create another raster of yet lower 
resolution, until an entire set is created, 
appropriate for different scales of display. 
The pyramids speed drawing because the 
computer only needs to select the right scale of 
raster to display, rather than sorting through it to 
choose pixels. The disadvantage of rasters is that 
storing the additional copies increases the size of 
the raster by about 50%. Creating pyramids is 
optional, depending on whether the user is more 
interested in quick display or smaller file sizes. 
Classifying numeric data 
Mapping numeric data, raster or vector, requires classifying a range of values into a small number 
of groups, each of which can be represented by a different color or symbol size. This process is 
called classification. There are many ways to classify data, and the choice of method affects the 
appearance of the map and the message that it portrays. Some common methods are compared in 
Figure 4.20 using the same data set of average farm size by state.  
The Jenks method sets the class breaks at naturally occurring gaps between groups of data 
(Fig. 4.20a). Each class interval can have its own width, and the number of features in each class 
will vary. The Jenks method works well on unevenly distributed data, such as populations of the 
capitals shown in Figure 4.7. There are many low-population and medium-population capitals and 
a few very high-population capitals. The Jenks method works well with almost any data set, 
making it a natural choice for the default classification scheme in ArcMap. 
The equal interval classification divides the values into a specified number of classes of equal 
size (Fig. 4.20b). This method is useful for ratio data, such as income or precipitation, because it 
gives a sense of regularity to the observed increases. However, it is hard to predict how many 
Fig. 4.19. Raster pyramids (Source: 
ArcGIS Desktop Help) 

Chapter 4 
118 
features will end up in each class. Notice in the farm size example that nearly all of the states fall 
into the first class. Compare this map to Figure 4.20a. 
A defined interval classification is similar to an equal interval one, except that the user specifies 
the size of the class interval, and the number of classes then depends on the range of values  
(Fig. 4.20c). This method will create rounded values in the classes that are easy to interpret. 
Defined interval maps are ideal when comparing classes composed of percentages, dollars, 
temperatures, and other values when specific break values are desired (100, 200, etc.). It does, 
however, suffer the same disadvantages as the equal interval classification. 
A quantile classification puts about the same number of features in each class (Fig. 4.20d) and 
enables display of groups, such as quartiles, commonly of interest in statistics. This method will 
create a balanced map with all classes equally well represented, but some of the features in the 
same class could have very different values, and features in different classes could have similar 
values. Quantile classifications are best applied to uniformly distributed data. Notice that a 
quantile classification highlights differences between the eastern states that are hidden in the 
Jenks, equal interval, and defined interval classifications. 
A geometric interval classification (Fig. 4.20e) bases the class intervals on a geometric series in 
which each class is multiplied by a constant coefficient to produce the next higher class. A

(b) Equal interval

(f) Standard deviation

farm size in acres by state 

Mapping GIS Data 
119 
geometric interval classification is designed to work well with continuous data like precipitation 
and to provide about the same number of values in each class range. It works especially well with 
positively skewed data distributions.  
A standard deviation classification apportions the values based on the statistics of the field. The 
user selects the class breaks as the number of standard deviations, and the data range determines 
the number of classes needed. This method excels at highlighting which values are typical and 
which are outliers, especially since a divergent color set is used to accentuate below versus above 
normal values. In Figure 4.20f, the yellow states are close to the mean farm size, several eastern 
states appear to have smaller than average farms, and some western states have much larger farms 
than average. This map is best applied to normally distributed data. 
Finally, if none of the above options gives the desired map, the user can manually set class break points 
to any chosen values. This option works for assigning a logarithmic or exponential scale, as well. 
Choosing the classification method 
The choice of classification method depends on the mapmaker’s purposes and on the type of data. 
Jenks shows the “nearest neighbors” in a distribution, whereas a defined interval or equal interval 
map does a better job of portraying relative magnitude. Notice the difference between the maps in 
Figures 2.20a and 2.20b. The Jenks map gives the impression that many states have large farms 
because the class sizes increase slowly; an equal interval map shows that farms in most states 
actually average 1000 acres or less. Figure 4.20b makes this observation clear at first glance.  
Some data possess the quality that the magnitude of the values has an intrinsic meaning. 
Percentage data, for example, have a physical and a psychological meaning—people have an 
intuitive understanding of the difference between 50% and 100%. Differences in median rent 
occur in dollar values to which people can attach meaning. When 
dealing with such data, it is wise to use a defined interval map to 
choose classes with logical break points, such as 20%, 5 inches of 
rain, or $200, rather than 12.6%, 1.47 inches of rain, or $187. The 
reader can more effectively interpret the classes. 
The distribution of values has impact also. Jenks and geometric 
interval classifications are designed to work well with unevenly 
distributed data. Equal interval, defined interval, and quantile 
maps can be used with any data but show better results with 
evenly distributed data. The statistics behind standard deviation 
maps assume that the data are normally distributed. 
About ArcGIS 
ArcGIS provides an extensive set of tools for symbolizing 
features and rasters. Within the Symbol Selector (Fig. 4.21), the 
user can choose from a variety of predefined symbols and modify 
the properties of those symbols, such as the fill color, outline 
width, and outline color, when the available ones are not suitable. 
An Edit Symbol button opens the Symbol Editor window to 
allow the user complete flexibility to modify individual symbol 
layers and create virtually any symbol desired (see the Skills 
Reference section for more about the Symbol Editor). 
Fig. 4.21. Symbol Selector 

Chapter 4 
120 
Symbols are organized into groups for ease of use. A style contains a set of symbols with a 
related theme and typically includes a wide range of symbol types, including point markers, line 
styles, polygon shades and patterns, color sets, text styles, and even north arrow or scale bar 
symbols. The default style the user sees is called the ESRI style. Dozens of other styles may be 
added by clicking the Style References button on the Symbol Selector, with themes such as 
Geology 24K, Environmental, Civic, Crime Analysis, or Hazmat. Users with very specific 
symbol needs can create their own styles and fill them with symbols copied from other styles, 
modified from other styles, or created ex nihilo. However, most users will find the standard sets 
quite sufficient for their needs. 
Although one typically works with only a few styles in the Symbol Selector at a time, a search 
function in the Selector allows the user to search by keyword for matching symbols in any of the 
installed styles. Searching for tree, for example, yields various symbols from the 3D Trees, 
CADD GIS Center, Caves, Civic, Environmental, Forestry, Ordnance Survey, and Survey styles. 
Once a set of symbols has been established for a layer, it is 
often helpful to save them as a layer file for reuse. 
Geologic map symbols, for example, utilize many specific 
colors and patterns and can take hours to set up. A 
graduated symbol set with manual breaks might be created 
to show arsenic in well water (Fig. 4.22), using specially 
chosen symbols to depict values below the detection limit 
(x), or below or above the EPA limit (blue/orange). By 
saving the finished layer as a layer file, the classification 
scheme can be quickly transferred to many map documents 
or used to ensure that everyone’s maps use the same set of 
values.

Summary 
¾ Differentiating between features on a map requires variations in symbol shape, size, 
thickness, line type, color, pattern, or font. 
¾ Attribute data have a data type designation: nominal, categorical, ordinal, interval, or ratio. 
The data type determines the kind of map and even the types of analysis that may be 
performed on that attribute. 
¾ Nominal data name things or uniquely identify them and may be text or numbers. Each 
feature usually has its own value, and repeats are the exception. 
¾ Categorical data group objects into smaller sets identified by a unique value. Numbers may 
be categorical when they are used as codes. Ordinal data consist of categories that are ranked 
in some way. 
¾ Interval data are measured on a regular scale, and ratio data are measured on a regular scale 
with a meaningful zero point. 
¾ Single symbol maps and labels are used to map nominal data. Unique values maps are used 
for categorical or ordinal data. Interval or ratio data are displayed using graduated color, 
graduated symbol, proportional symbol, dot density, or chart maps. 
¾ Rasters may contain thematic or image data. Discrete thematic rasters can be displayed using 
a unique values method. Continuous thematic rasters may be classified or stretched. Image 
rasters use a stretched or RGB composite display. 
¾ Continuous numeric data are classified before being mapped. Classification methods include 
Jenks natural breaks, equal interval, defined interval, quantile, geometric interval, standard 
deviation, and manual. The best classification method depends on the type of data and the 
data distribution. 
¾ In ArcGIS, symbols are grouped into similar themes called styles. Tools are available to 
allow the user to create virtually any symbol needed for a map.

Mastering the Skills 
Teaching Tutorial 
The following examples provide step-by-step instructions for doing basic tasks and solving basic 
problems in ArcGIS. The steps you need to do are highlighted with an arrow Î; follow them 
carefully. Click on the video number in the Video Index to view a demonstration of the steps. 
Exploring symbols 
The first time we opened ArcMap we started with a default blank map. This time we will use a 
template to specify the size and layout of the map page. We will also set a default geodatabase for 
the map to indicate where most of the data will come from and where it should be saved. 
1Î Start ArcMap. In the Getting Started window, click on the Templates > North 
American entry.  
1ÎScroll down to the Letter (ANSI A) Portrait entry and select it. Do not click OK yet. 
1Î Click the Browse button next to the Default Geodatabase box. 
1Î Navigate to the mgisdata\Oregon folder and click the oregondata geodatabase to 
highlight it. Click Add. 
1Î Click OK to finish opening the new map. 
1Î Save the map document in the MapDocuments folder, and remember to save 
periodically as you work. 
We begin by adding some feature classes from the Oregon geodatabase. 
2Î Click the Add Data button.  
2Î Find the Default Geodatabase button and click it to go directly to the default 
geodatabase, oregondata. 
2Î Add the counties and volcanoes feature classes from the geodatabase.  
 
3Î Add the airports and highways from the Transportation feature dataset.  
3Î Add the rivers feature class from the Water feature dataset. 
 
4Î In the Table of Contents, click twice slowly on the Layers data frame name and 
change it to Geography. 
4Î Make sure that you are in Data view, seeing the map but not the layout page. 
 
5Î Click on the airports symbol to open the Symbol Selector.  
5Î Click the Style References button to view the list of additional styles that could be 
added to the Symbol Selector. Cancel without selecting any. 
5Î Click the Edit Symbol button and take a moment to examine the current symbol in 
the Symbol Property Editor. Explore this window if you wish, but click Cancel to exit 
without incorporating any changes to the symbol. 
SKILL TIP: Use the Symbol Editor to create and manage new symbols (Maps and Symbols). 

Chapter 4 
124 
6Î Still in the Symbol Selector window, type airplane into the 
search box at the top and click the magnifying glass search button. 
6Î Examine the airplane symbols from the different styles. 
6Î Choose the Airplane symbol from the ESRI style; make it 25 pt. and rotate 
it −45 degrees. Click OK. 
 
7Î Right-click the airports layer and choose Copy. Right-click the Geography data 
frame and choose Paste Layer(s). 
7Î In the new layer, assign this Airplane symbol. View each airports layer 
separately, comparing the impact of the symbols. 
7Î Right-click the airports layer with the cartoon symbol and choose Remove. 
TIP: Cartoon symbols are popular in software these days, but they are too visually complex to 
make good map symbols and should usually be avoided.  
Recall that color may be viewed as a combination of three variations: hue, saturation, and value. 
Let us examine how these variations affect the color produced. 
8Î Right-click on the symbol for counties and choose More Colors. 
8Î If necessary, change the dropdown button from RGB or CMYK to the 
HSV (hue-saturation-value) color model.  
8Î Use the sliders to vary the hue, saturation, and value of the current 
color until you understand how these vectors impact the color produced. Click Cancel. 
 
9Î Right-click on the symbol for counties and change the color to light yellow. 
9Î Right-click on the line symbol for rivers and change the color to deep blue. 
The rivers seem to be cluttering the map at this scale, so they would benefit from a scale range. 
9Î Right-click the rivers layer and open its properties. 
9Î Click the General tab and fill the button for Don’t show layer when zoomed out 
beyond and choose the scale 1:3,000,000. Click OK. 
Labeling features 
Nominal data are usually portrayed using labels. Dynamic labels can be created for a layer using 
an attribute field and can be turned on or off for the entire layer. They use an auto-placement 
function to avoid overlaps, and not all labels may be shown. Dynamic labels are redrawn each 
time the map is redrawn and may change as the scale changes or when the map is printed. 
10Î Click twice slowly on the airports layer and rename it Airports. 
10ÎDouble-click on the Airports layer to open its properties and click the Labels tab. 
10Î Check the box to Label features in this layer and leave the method set to Label all 
features the same way. 
10Î Set the Label field is set to NAME and choose Arial 9 pt. bold as the font. 
10Î Click Apply to make the changes, but keep the window open. Move it aside, if 
necessary, to see the labels. 

Mapping GIS Data 
125 
Basic labels are easy to set, but they often are not quite what is wanted. There are several 
additional options to control dynamic labels, such as adding a halo to help them stand out better. 
11Î Click the Symbol button in the Label Properties window. Notice the different pre-
set symbols available, but don’t choose any. 
11Î Click the Edit Symbol button. You can do very detailed editing here, but we just 
want the mask. 
11Î Click the Mask tab. Choose Halo, leave the size at 2 pt., and click OK and OK to 
close the symbol windows. Click Apply to enact the change. 
Some control is given over where the symbols are placed relative to the feature. 
12Î Click the Placement Properties button in the Label Properties window. Make sure 
that the Placement tab is clicked. 
12Î Examine the diagram that shows the placement priority around the 
point. Click Change Location to examine the other options, but don’t 
choose one. Click Cancel. 
12Î Examine some of the other options, such as placing the label on top 
of a point, or placing it at an angle. Click Cancel. 
12Î Click OK to close the layer properties. We are finished with the airports. 
Line features have different placement options.  
13Î Rename the rivers layer Rivers, and open its properties. 
13Î Click the Labels tab, if necessary. Check the box to label the features, and make 
sure that the Label Field is set to the NAME field. 
13Î Change the symbol to Arial 8-pt. dark blue italic, and click OK.  
13Î The Rivers layer has a scale range, so set the map scale to 
1:3,000,000 using the drop-down button on the main toolbar. 
Even at this scale, there are too many rivers to label, and the map is cluttered. You can set a scale 
range for labels separately from that for the layer. 
14Î Open the Rivers properties again. On the Labels tab, click the Scale Range button.  
14Î Change the settings to Don’t show labels when zoomed out beyond 1:1,000,000. 
Click OK to return to the Label properties, and click OK. 
14Î Set the map scale to 1:1,000,000 to examine the rivers.  
It is traditional to curve labels along the rivers instead of using straight text. 
15Î Open the Rivers label properties again. Click the Placement Properties button. 
15Î Choose the Curved orientation button (Fig. 4.23). Check the boxes to place labels 
Above or Below the line. 
15Î Examine the other settings, but leave them alone. Click OK to finish setting the 
placement options, and then OK to finish. 

Chapter 4 
126 
15Î Examine the labels, and then 
use the Full Extent button to 
zoom to all of Oregon.  
SKILL TIP: The Label Manager makes it 
easier to create and edit labels for several 
layers at once (Labels and Annotation). 
Symbols and labels may be combined 
when labeling.  
16Î Rename the highways layer 
Highways, and give it a thick 
brown symbol. 
16Î Open the Highways properties. On the Labels tab, turn on the labels and make sure 
the Label Field is set to HWY_SYMBOL. 
16Î Click the Symbol button. In the Symbol Selector, scroll down and choose the US 
Route HWY symbol. Click OK to return to the Layer Properties window. 
 
17Î Set the Scale Range to not show the symbols when zoomed out beyond 
1:1,000,000. Click OK. 
17Î Click the Placement Properties tab. Choose the Horizontal orientation. Click OK 
and OK. 
17Î Zoom in to 1:1,000,000 to see the labels. Then return to the Full Extent of the map. 
SKILL TIP: You can create classes for labels and label each class differently, such as giving the 
interstates one symbol and the highways another (Labels and Annotation). 
18Î Rename the counties layer Counties. 
18Î Use what you have learned so far to give the counties Arial 8 pt. bold labels with a 
2-pt. halo. Don’t assign a scale range. 
Creating maps from attributes for points 
Currently, each feature class is displayed with a single symbol. Next, we will learn how to create 
maps based on attributes containing categorical, ordinal, interval, or ratio data. (If you need to 
review the data types, go back to the Concepts section.) Let’s examine the fields in the table. 
19Î Rename the volcanoes layer Volcanoes. 
19Î Right-click the Volcanoes layer and choose Open Attribute Table. 
1. What is the data type of these two attribute fields in the volcanoes feature class?  
ELEVATION _______________ TYPE _________________ 
Fig. 4.23. Setting curved labels along rivers 

Mapping GIS Data 
127 
The ELEVATION field contains numeric data, so it must be portrayed using a quantities map, 
and the values must be classified.  
20Î Close the Table window, and open the Volcanoes layer properties. Click the 
Symbology tab. 
20Î Click the Quantities text on the left and choose Graduated colors (Fig. 4.24). 
20Î Set the Value field to ELEVATION. A set of classes appears below with the default 
to five classes and the Jenks Natural Breaks classification. 
20Î Set the color ramp to the one shown in Figure 4.24. Click OK. 
The symbols now show which volcanoes have lower and higher elevations. However, the small 
symbol size makes the colors difficult to see—a common problem with graduated color maps for 
point data. We can edit the base symbol to make the map easier to interpret. We will also change 
the color ramp, because monochromatic color sets that vary saturation/value are better at 
portraying quantitive values than rainbow hues. 
 
21Î Open the Volcanoes layer properties.  
21Î Under the color ramp setting, click on the 
Symbol heading to reveal a menu. Choose 
Properties for All Symbols (Fig. 4.25). 
21Î Choose the Triangle 2 symbol. Click OK. 
21Î Change the color ramp to a monochromatic 
one as in Figure 4.25. Click OK. 
 
22Î Turn off the Airports layer. 
22Î Right-click the Counties layer and choose 
Label Features to turn off the labels for now. 
They will still be there if you want to turn 
them on again later.

128 
You can now see that the eastern volcanoes are generally lower in elevation, and the highest 
volcanoes lie in the north. But let’s try a graduated symbol map instead. 
23Î Open the Volcanoes symbol properties again. 
23Î Change the Quantities map type to Graduated symbols. Keep the Value field set to 
ELEVATION. Circles are the default symbols, but triangles would make more sense. 
23Î Look right and click the Template button, which is used to set the base symbol. 
23Î Choose the Triangle 2 symbol again and set its color to a reddish brown. Click OK. 
23Î The smallest class symbol is barely visible. Change the minimum size value to  
6 pt., the maximum size to 20 pt., and the number of classes to 4. Click OK. 
It is often possible to portray the same data several different ways, and the mapmaker must 
choose the method that best communicates the idea being presented. In your opinion, did the 
graduated color or graduated symbol map do a better job of showing the differences in elevation? 
24Î Rename the Volcanoes layer Volcano Elevation. 
The elevation values in the Table of Contents have many decimal values, which is undesirable for 
two reasons. First, they are pointless because they are all zeros. Second, the significant figures 
used for labels should be consistent with the precision of the values being reported. 
24Î Open the properties for the Volcano Elevation layer again. 
24Î Click on the Label heading to the left of the Template button, 
and choose Format Labels. 
24Î Under Rounding, fill the button for Number of significant digits, 
and set the number to 2. Click OK and OK. 
24Î For a final touch, click twice slowly on the ELEVATION 
heading in the Table of Contents and type (meters).  
TIP: Evenly rounded class labels give a more professional look to a map. 
Next, we will symbolize the volcanoes based on type. However, we don’t want to lose the 
elevation map, so we will create a copy of the layer. One of the advantages of layers is the ability 
to create different views from the same feature class. 
25Î Right-click the Volcano Elevation layer and choose Copy. 
25Î Right-click the Geography data frame name and choose Paste Layer(s). 
25Î Give the new Volcano Elevation layer (above the old one) a new name, Volcano 
Type. Drag it below the Airports layer, if necessary. 
Now let’s consider how to symbolize the volcano TYPE field. It contains repeating entries like 
“Stratovolcano” and “Volcanic field,” which represent categorical data. The proper type of map 
for categorical data is a unique values map.  
26Î Open the Volcano Type symbol properties. Click Categories to change the map type 
and select the Unique values map (Fig. 4.26).  

Mapping GIS Data 
129 
26Î Change the Value field to TYPE. Click the Add All Values button. It will not show 
the categories until you do. 
26Î Notice the <all other values> entry at the top of the categories list. This offers the 
option of grouping small categories together. In this case, there are no features in this 
class, so uncheck the box to turn off display of this category. 
Notice the double entry for Shield volcano(es). A data entry error has separated these two groups, 
which really should go together. We could edit the database, but for now we can work around it. 
27Î Click one Shield volcano symbol, then hold down the Shift key and click the other 
symbol, so that both rows are highlighted. 
27Î Right-click one of the highlighted rows and choose Group Values. 
27Î Click on the Label row containing the double entry and change it to simply Shield 
volcano. Click below all of the symbols to remove the selection. 
Now let’s return to symbolizing the volcano type. 
28Î Click the Symbol heading to access the Properties for All Symbols menu (as shown 
in Fig. 4.25). Set the symbol to Triangle 2 and click OK. 
28Î Change the color ramp to one with dark, bold colors that will show up well. 
28Î Examine the window to make sure it looks like Figure 4.26. Then click OK. 
28Î Turn off the Volcano Elevation layer by unchecking it in the Table of Contents. 
TIP: If you don’t like the color assigned to a volcano, right-click its symbol 
in the Table of Contents to change the color. There is no map type to assign 
different shapes to each type, but you can do it manually using the Symbol 
Selector to set the symbol, size, and color for each one individually.

Creating maps for attributes of lines 
Next we turn our attention to displaying the highways with different symbols for each type. First, 
we need to check the attribute table to see what fields are available.  
29Î Right-click the Highways layer and choose Open Attribute Table. 
29Î Examine in particular the HWY_TYPE field. 
2. What three values are found in this field? ____________________ Can you decipher what 
they mean by examining the other fields for clues? 
Again we have categorical data, and the unique values map type is the appropriate choice. 
29Î Close the table and open the symbol properties for Highways. 
29Î Choose the Categories heading and select the Unique values map type. 
29Î Set the Value field to HWY_TYPE and click Add All Values. 
29Î Click the Count heading above the categories to force it to count the number of 
features in each category. Notice the lone H value and the 58 unlabeled roads. 
It is reasonable to assume that “I” stands for interstates, “S” stands for state highways, and “U” 
stands for US highways, but what could the “H” represent? With only one, there is a chance it is 
simply a data entry error. We also have no idea what to label the blank highways. However, we 
can edit the legend categories to create a clearer legend. 
30Î Click on the row containing the “H” value and click the Remove button. It removes 
the category and places the feature in the <all other values> entry.  
30Î Also click on the row with the unlabeled features and Remove it as well. 
30Î Click on the “U” under the Label heading to highlight it. Type in US Highways. 
30Î Click on the “S” and type in State Highways. 
30Î Click on the “I” and type Interstates. 
30Î Change the HWY_TYPE label to Road Class. 
30Î Change the <all other values> label to Unclassified. 
30Î Click on the US Highways symbol to highlight the row. Then click the Up arrow to 
move it below the Interstates. 
Now we have symbols based on highway type, but the thin colored lines do not distinguish the 
types very well. This classification would benefit from using differences in symbol, thickness, 
and color to distinguish the different road classes. 
31Î Double-click the symbol for the Interstates to open the Symbol Selector.  
31Î Choose the Expressway symbol and click OK. 
31Î Double-click the symbol for the US Highways. Select the Major Road symbol and 
change the color to dark green. Click OK. 
31Î Double-click the symbol for the State Highways. Choose the Major Road symbol 
and set its color to a light brown.  

Mapping GIS Data 
131 
31Î When finished, the legend should look as 
shown in Figure 4.27. Click OK.  
Creating maps for attributes for polygons 
Let’s create maps based on population using the 
counties layer.  
3. What kind of data does population 
represent?____________ What kind of map should 
be used to display it? _______________________ 
32Î Open the symbol properties for the Counties layer. 
32Î Choose Quantities: graduated colors for map type and POP2010 for the Value field. 
Remember, population data are usually normalized to the area of the aggregation unit.  
32Î Choose SQMI as the Normalization field (near the bottom of the list). 
32Î Change the color ramp to a monochromatic one, such as light to dark orange. 
32Î Click on the Label heading above the classes and choose Format labels. Give them 
two significant digits and check the box to Show thousands separators. Click OK and 
OK to view the map. 
We will create new layers for each new map so that we can keep the previous ones. 
33Î Click twice slowly on the counties layer name and rename it Population Density. 
33Î Right-click on the Population Density layer name and choose Copy. 
33Î Right-click on the Geography data frame name and choose Paste Layer(s). 
Next we will map the median age of the counties. Whereas population values may vary in part 
based on the size of the polygon, the median age should be independent of the 
area being measured. This attribute should not be normalized. 
34Î Rename the new layer (on top) Median Age. 
34Î Create a graduated color map based on the MED_AGE field. 
Change the normalization field to none. Format the labels to have two 
significant digits.  
Classifying data 
We have been using the default Natural Breaks classification so far, but it is not always the best 
method. Examine the uneven class ranges for the Median Age layer. The legend might make more 
sense if the age ranges are evenly separated by five years.  
35Î Open the symbol properties of the Median Age layer. 
35Î Click the Classify button. Take a moment to examine the histogram, and note that 
these data are fairly uniformly distributed. 
35Î Change the Classification method to Defined Interval. If you get an error, just close 
the warning and continue. It is a bug. Set the Interval Size to 5. 
35Î Click OK and OK. Examine the new ranges in the Table of Contents.  
Fig. 4.27. Final legend for highways 

Chapter 4 
132 
Most readers would find this classification easier to understand than the uneven classes produced 
by the Jenks method. Next, symbolize the population of the cities.  
36Î Add the cities feature class from the mgisdata\oregondata geodatabase. 
36Î Open the symbol properties for the cities layer and choose the Quantities: graduated 
symbols map type. 
36Î Set the Value field to POP2007 and click the Classify button. 
This data set is skewed, with many small cities and one very large one. The default Jenks Natural 
Breaks is probably the best classification choice. Five classes are a little difficult to distinguish 
based on size, though, so let’s reduce the number to three. 
37Î Change the number of classes to three, and click OK. 
37Î Click the Template button and set the color to a light one. They will show up better 
when the symbols overlap. 
37Î Format the labels to three significant figures with thousands separators. Click OK 
in all of the windows to view the map. 
Let’s look at the activity of the volcanoes now. 
38Î Make a copy of the Volcano Elevation layer and paste it into the Geography data 
frame. Name it Known Eruptions. 
38Î Open the symbol properties. Keep the Graduated symbols map type but change the 
Value field to KNOWN_ERUP. Examine the class values. 
38Î Click the Classify button. 
The -999 values are flags to indicate a missing value, and they are messing up our classification 
statistics. We could use Exclusion to get rid of unwanted values.  
39Î Click the Exclusion button. It will open a window to build a query. We will enter an 
expression for the values to exclude. 
39Î Enter the expression KNOWN_ERUP < 0 in the lower panel. Verify it and click 
OK. You may not be able to see a difference yet. 
This menu has had a bug in it for several versions of software. You have to close and reopen the 
layer and reset the classification to make it work. 
39Î Click OK and OK to close the windows. 
39Î Open the Known Eruptions symbol properties again and click the Classify button. 
39Î Notice that the negative values are gone from the statistics and histogram. 
39Î Set the classification method to Defined Interval and set the Interval Size to 3. 
39Î Click OK and OK to finish symbolizing the layer. Turn off the other volcano layers. 
The classification method can influence the appearance of a layer and thus the message it sends. 
An advantage of unclassed maps, such as proportional symbol maps, is that they don’t require 
classification and present an unbiased view of the data. 
40Î Copy the Known Eruptions layer and paste it in the Geography data frame. 

Mapping GIS Data 
133 
40Î Open the new layer’s symbol properties and set the map type to Proportional 
Symbols. Set the Value field to KNOWN_ERUP. 
40Î Click the Min Value button and change it to a 10-pt. Triangle 2 symbol with a light 
color. Click OK. 
40Î Check the Max Value symbol size to make sure that it is not unreasonably large. 
With a proportional symbol map, you can only set the lower size—the upper is 
determined by the value in the attribute field. Click OK. 
SKILL TIP: Dot density maps are also unclassed maps and can be used for polygons.  
Displaying thematic rasters 
Thematic rasters portray map data, such as soil types, roads, elevation, or precipitation. The 
current data frame is getting busy, so we’ll create a new data frame to experiment. 
41Î Click the minus sign next to the Geography data frame name to collapse it. 
41Î Switch to Layout view. Arrange the data frame in the top half of the page. 
41ÎChoose Insert > Data Frame from the main menu bar and arrange the new one in the 
bottom half of the page. 
41Î Change the name of the new data frame to Rasters in the Table of Contents. 
We will begin with a digital elevation model (DEM), a raster that portrays an elevation surface 
with a pixel size of one kilometer. 
42Î Activate the Rasters data frame, if necessary, by right-clicking it in the Table of 
Contents and choosing Activate. 
42Î Add the gtopo1km raster from the oregondata geodatabase. 
42Î Return to Data view. You should see the gtopo1km raster in the view. 
TIP: The first time that a raster is displayed, the user is asked whether to build pyramids, which 
speeds the display of the raster on subsequent occasions. You can click Yes. 
43Î Open the gtopo1km layer properties and click on the General tab. Note that the 
elevations are in meters. 
43Î Click on the Source tab and examine the properties of the raster. Examine the cell 
size and, scrolling down, the spatial reference (coordinate system). 
43Î Click on the Symbology tab and examine its settings. 
4. What kind of data type is elevation?________________ What kind of raster display 
method(s) could be used to display it?________________________________________ 
When a raster is added to a map, ArcMap chooses an initial display method based on the raster 
type. In this case, it chose the Stretched method with a grayscale color ramp. Notice the minimum 
and maximum elevation values, from 1 to 3124 meters. The Stretched method slices these values 
into 256 bins for use with the 256-grayscale ramp.  

Chapter 4 
134 
44Î Close the Properties window.  
44Î Click the Identify tool and click on the raster to view 
values for a pixel. 
Figure 4.28 shows the results when a white pixel is clicked. The Pixel 
value is the elevation, 2272 meters. The Stretched value indicates the 
bin number, 241. This bin is displayed as nearly pure white. The 
COUNT field tells how many pixels have this value. 
44Î Click on more pixels in the raster, choosing black, white, and gray ones. Compare 
the pixel values and the stretched values for each one. 
44Î Close the Identify window. 
 
45Î Open the properties for gtopo1km and 
examine the Symbology tab. A Standard 
Deviation stretch is being used with 2.5 standard 
deviations. 
45Î Move the Properties window aside so that the 
map can be seen. Change the Stretch type to 
None and click Apply. Examine the map. 
45Î Change the Stretch type back to Standard 
Deviations. Click Apply. 
 
46Î Try experimenting with different color ramps, clicking Apply after each. 
46Î End by choosing the color ramp shown in Figure 4.29. Click OK. 
The Stretched method utilizes 256 equal interval classes. The classified display method gives 
control of the number of classes and the classification method. 
47Î Rename the gtopo1km layer Elev-Stretched. 
47Î Copy the Elev-Stretched layer and paste it into the Rasters data frame. 
47Î Rename the new layer Elev-Classified and open its symbol properties. 
 
48Î Change the raster display method to Classified. Find the same color ramp used for 
Figure 4.29 and select it. 
48Î Set the number of classes to 10. Continuous data, because they often have 
underlying spatial patterns, can use more classes and colors. Click OK. 
48Î Use the Identify tool to examine the pixel values and the class values (which go 
from 0 to 9 rather than 1 to 10). Close the Identify window when finished. 
One advantage of using the classified display method is controlling the classification. It defaulted 
to Jenks Natural Breaks. However, elevations are best displayed in even classes with rounded 
numbers to appear like a contour map. 
49Î Open the Symbology properties for the Elev-Classified layer. Click the Classify 
button.

135 
49Î Change the classification method to Defined 
Interval. Set the interval to 200 meters.  
49Î Notice the histogram. Most of the elevations 
fall below 2000, with very few pixels in the 
higher elevations. Click OK and OK. 
Notice how few white pixels show now (Fig. 4.30). The 
Stretched method and the Jenks classification overemphasized 
high elevations. The defined interval classification presents a 
more honest view.  
50Î Add the gtoposhd raster from the oregondata 
geodatabase. 
This type of raster is called a hillshade raster. It is derived 
from a DEM by modeling how the illuminated surface might 
appear and contains brightness values from 0 to 255. 
Hillshade rasters provide an intuitive and detailed view of 
the surface and make a useful base for transparent overlays. 
50Î Click on the Elev-Classified layer and drag it 
above the gtoposhd layer in the Table of 
Contents. Remember, layers are drawn from 
bottom to top. 
50Î Open the Elev-Classified layer properties. 
50Î Click on the Display tab. Set the Transparency 
to 50% and click OK (Fig. 4.31). 
 
51Î Use the minus buttons to collapse the legends for the three elevation layers. 
51Î Add the slopeclass raster from the oregondata geodatabase. It shows areas of low, 
medium, and high slope indicated by the values 1, 2, and 3. 
5. What type of data does this raster contain? _______________ What type of map should be 
used to display it?________________________________ 
52Î Open the properties for the slopeclass layer and click the Symbology tab. 
52Î If the Value Field defaulted to the Class field, change it to the Value field. 
52Î Notice that the unique values map was initially chosen. This choice is fine, but for 
ordinal data, a monochromatic color ramp will show the data better. 
52Î Click on the Color Scheme choice and select a monochromatic ramp. Click Apply 
and experiment until you find one that you like. Then click OK. 
 
53Î Add the landcover raster from the oregondata geodatabase. 
53Î Right-click the landcover layer and choose Open Attribute Table.  
The Value field contains the numeric values stored in the raster, and the Count field indicates 
how many cells contain each value. All raster attribute tables contain those two fields. The other 
fields were added to provide information about what the values mean.

136 
TIP: Rasters with fewer than 2000 unique values will automatically be given an attribute table. 
53Î Close the Table window and open the symbol properties for the landcover layer. 
53Î Scroll down and examine the colors and values.  
A new Colormap method appears in the list, which assigns preselected colors to each raster value. 
If a raster has a colormap, then this display method will be initially used. 
54Î Close the Properties window and open the Identify tool. 
54Î Click on different colors of the landcover layer.  
The first row shows the color index, the number assigned to that color (Fig. 4.32). The second 
row is the color specification, indicated as mixtures of red, green, and blue. This raster has 150 
categories of land cover. The raster contains another field, HABNAME, which groups the cover 
classes into fewer categories. Let’s display the land cover using this field.  
54Î Close the Identify window and open the symbol 
properties for landcover.  
54Î Change the display method to Unique Values. 
54Î Change the Value Field to HABNAME and 
click OK.  
This raster has a colormap, so its default colors are the best 
choice. Transparency can be used with any raster or vector 
layer to enhance the display. 
55Î Collapse the legend for landcover layer. 
55Î Click and drag the gtoposhd layer just below the 
landcover layer in the Table of Contents. 
55Î Open the properties for the landcover layer. Click the Display tab and set the 
Transparency to 50%. Click OK. 
Displaying image rasters 
Images represent brightness of land features as measured by a camera or spectrometer. They can 
have one band or multiple bands. This Landsat image over Crater Lake has eight bands. 
56Î Turn off all layers in the Rasters data frame. 
56Î Add the L720021127av2 image from the mgisdata\Oregon folder. Click Close to 
ignore the coordinate system warning.  
56Î Rename the image layer Landsat. 
56Î Right-click the Landsat layer in the Table of Contents and choose Zoom to Layer. 
56Î Open the Landsat layer properties and click the Symbology tab. 
Notice the two ways to display the image. Stretched is appropriate for single-band images or to 
display one band of a multiband image at a time.  
57Î Click Stretched and select Band 1 (blue light) as the band to display. 
Fig. 4.32. Identifying land 
cover pixels

137 
57Î Keep the default Standard Deviation Stretch and leave the other settings. 
57Î Click Apply and move the Properties window aside to examine the image. 
Each band collects a different wavelength of light from the surface. Different materials reflect 
light more or less in each band. Each band highlights different aspects of the terrain. 
58Î Change the display band to Band 4 (near-infrared) and click Apply. 
58Î Examine each of the other bands, noticing how different each looks. 
An RGB composite displays three bands at a time, one in each RGB color gun of the monitor. 
You can experiment with assigning different bands to each color. 
59Î Open the Symbol properties, if necessary, and choose RGB Composite.  
59Î Choose Band 3 for the red channel, Band 2 for the green, and Band 1 for the blue. 
The Landsat bands will match the color guns to create a true-color image. 
59Î Click Apply and examine.  
59Î Experiment with different stretches, clicking Apply after each one. 
 
60Î Choose Band 4 for the red channel, Band 3 for the green, and Band 1 for the blue. 
Click OK. 
Band 4 shows near-infrared light, which is strongly reflected by vegetation. This combination of 
bands is known as a false-color image, and it is helpful in assessing vegetation density and health. 
You can experiment with a few other band combinations if you have time. 
ArcGIS Online has some Landsat image services which give you a subset or all of the image 
bands. If you have a fast Internet connection, try the following. 
61Î Turn off the Landsat layer. 
61Î Click the Add Data button and choose Add Data from ArcGIS Online. 
61Î Search for Landsat in the search box. 
61Î Find the Worldwide Landsat GLS Mosaic image service and add it. 
With large images, the statistics used to calculate the stretches often don’t work well over smaller 
areas. You can use statistics from the local window to get better results. 
62Î Open the symbol properties for the Worldwide Landsat GLS Mosaic layer. 
62Î Under Stretch Statistics, choose From Current Display Extent. 
62Î Choose the Standard Deviation stretch and click OK. 
Notice all the small patches of harvested timber west of Crater Lake. Can you see the national 
park boundary for Crater Lake? Why? 
63ÎZoom further out to see more of the image. 
63Î Continue experimenting with displaying this image if you have time. Zoom to other 
areas of the country to examine different ecosystems. 
This is the end of the tutorial.  
Î Close ArcMap. You can save the map document if you wish.

Exercises  
Use ArcMap and the data in mgisdata\Oregon\oregondata to create a map document showing 
various aspects of Oregon, as described below. Use what you have learned to make each map as 
aesthetic and legible as you can.  
  1. Start with a new, blank map using the Letter (ANSI A) Landscape template. Create four data 
frames, each of which takes up a quarter of the page. Name them Volcanic Hazards, Farms, 
Housing, and Physiography. 
In the Volcanic Hazards data frame: 
  2. Create a map showing the population density of the counties. Also show the hospitals, marked 
with blue crosses. 
  3. Create a proportional symbol map of the volcanoes based on the KNOWN_ERUP field. 
In the Farms data frame: 
  4. Create a map of counties showing the density of farms. Label the county names. 
  5. Create a map showing the transportation routes, symbolized by type (road type, rail, and air). 
In the Housing data frame: 
  6. Create a map showing the vacancy rate of the counties. What would you normalize by in this 
case? Label the county names. 
  7. Show the major cities feature class (majcities) symbolized by population. 
In the Physiography data frame: 
  8. Add the state boundary and the county boundaries, and then add the World Imagery service 
from ArcGIS Online. Use a hollow symbol and a contrasting outline color for the state and 
county boundaries so that you can see them well against the imagery. 
For all the frames: 
  9. Examine the legends in the Table of Contents. Make sure you used good classification 
schemes, rounded label values, and appropriate significant digits or decimal places. Be sure 
that each layer has an informative capitalized name. 
10. Capture a screen shot of each data frame in Data View, including the Table of Contents 
showing the corresponding legends for each frame. Also capture a screen shot of the entire 
layout with all four frames. 
Challenge Problem: Big and Little 
Start with the map created in the Volcanic Hazards data frame and turn off the hospitals. Consult 
the Skills Reference section to learn how to create label classes to label features differently based 
on an attribute. Label the active volcanoes (KNOWN_ERUP > 0) with large red labels and the 
inactive volcanoes (KNOWN_ERUP = 0) with smaller green labels.

Mastering the Concepts 
GIS Concepts 
GIS analysis usually results in sharing information with others in the form of maps. Every map 
has a purpose established by the cartographer, and the success of a map is judged by how well the 
map fulfills that purpose. This chapter introduces some basic design principles for maps, but it 
cannot cover the full range of concepts included in the art and science of cartography. Taking a 
cartography class and reading map or graphic design texts are good ways to improve your skills. 
 
Map design can be envisioned as a six-step process (Fig. 5.1), but it is not linear. It begins by 
developing a vision of the map’s objective, and this vision must inform each step along the way: 
selecting the data, arranging the page, symbolizing the information, reviewing the map, and 
editing to improve it. Each step must constantly refer back to the main objective to ensure that the 
final map supports the objective in every possible way.  
To illustrate this process, the map used in the tutorial will be used as an example of map design. 
Consult these bars to follow through the design considerations.

Chapter 5 
140 
Determine the map objective 
Developing a clearly defined objective is the most important design step for a map. It determines 
the form and content of the map, and it provides the context to review a map and ask whether it 
works. Four issues should be considered: the purpose of the map, the audience for which it is 
intended, the medium in which it will be produced, and the conditions of expected use. 
Purpose 
Maps serve different functions, and the function strongly influences all steps of the design. So the 
first question to answer is “What is the purpose?” A complete list of every map purpose is 
impossible, but a few of the common ones include: 
¾ Locating. Some maps show the location of some place or places of interest, such as 
showing the location of a store or a choice of hotels on a street map, perhaps with 
directions to get there. A walking or biking tour map would also fall into this category. 
Such maps need little more than the point(s) of interest and a street matrix with labels. 
¾ Navigating. In a navigation map, the location of interest is not already known, so the maps 
tend to be richer in data to allow the user to identify and travel to different types of locations. 
A highway atlas, for example, shows many cities, connecting roads, and other features of 
interest such as parks, rivers, or mountain ranges. 
¾ Compiling. Some maps gather information, sometimes very detailed and complex 
information, to meet the specific needs of experts. Geologic maps, utility network maps, 
and construction or landscaping plans are examples. The information will be specific to 
the task at hand. 
¾ Convincing. Many maps are created to make a point or to illustrate the conclusions of a 
study, such as showing the potential sites for a landfill, telling the story of historical battles, 
making an argument for a new park, or identifying hot spots of crime. The information 
included will primarily support the intended message. 
¾ Comparing. Some designs use multiple maps to compare information. A map might 
show the historical and modern street maps, decadal differences in population or climate, 
or the spatial distributions of different types of cancers. 
Part of determining the purpose of a map is identifying its target audience. The characteristics 
and anticipated knowledge level of the audience greatly influence the choice and presentation of 
the data. A traditional geologic map is a wealth of information for an expert but means little to a 
general citizen. A professional might not appreciate whimsical touches designed to appeal to 
elementary scholars. A map produced for residents of a retirement community could have larger 
text and symbols than usual to accommodate vision impairments common to that age group. The 
best maps take into account the likes, dislikes, knowledge, and abilities of the target audience and 
produce the best possible experience for them. 
Medium 
Maps are designed with a specific medium in mind; traditionally paper or vellum, for which the 
size and orientation of the finished product are a main concern. Maps should be designed at the 
size and scale for which they are intended for production; scaling generally introduces unwanted 
artifacts or affects the artistic balance. The properties of the available printers—the size of paper 
it can handle, the type of ink used, and the printing resolution—will also influence the final 
product. If many copies will be produced, the creator must factor in the costs of printing in 
choosing the medium, the paper quality, and whether color should be used.

Today, cartographers have exciting new media to design for: electronic files like PDF or 
presentation slides, web sites, smartphones, and tablets. Electronic maps have different 
requirements than printed maps and present unique design challenges. The author of a web map 
has little control over the size of the product; it could be shown on a conference screen several 
feet across or reduced to a few inches of screen on a mobile device. The maps compete for 
attention in a frenzied cacophony of content, and most users will move on if they don’t find what 
they need in less than a minute. Web maps rarely have the luxury to allow a leisurely unfolding of 
complex content. They must be adaptable, obvious, and attractive. 
The magic of web maps, of course, is that they can be interactive. Users can zoom, turn layers on 
and off, measure objects, and even perform analysis functions like getting directions or viewing 
an elevation profile. However, simplicity is still important. It is tempting to turn a web map into a 
baby GIS with dozens of buttons, but it is better to design a web map to show or do one thing 
really well, rather than to try to pack it with data and functions. 
The conditions of use can be considered part of the medium as well. Posters viewed from a 
distance require larger fonts and symbols than maps intended to be spread on a table. Maps that 
would be used under dim lighting conditions should avoid complex backgrounds like imagery 
and use larger symbols and better contrast than a map viewed under normal room light. Maps 
designed for outdoor data collection on a smartphone must use large symbols and intense colors 
to contend with the tiny screen and bright sunlight conditions. Being aware of special physical 
conditions enables the cartographer to design the map to function properly in its environment.  
The purpose of the tutorial map is to portray the potential dangers of volcanoes to populations 
living in the Pacific Northwest. Its audience is the average adult citizen, and it is intended to be 
printed in color on a letter-size page. 
Select the data 
Once the purpose of the map is clear, the cartographer selects the data it will contain. Think of the 
map as telling a story. A good story has main characters that move the action and minor 
characters that must not outshine the lead players. A mapmaker must know which data play the 
starring role, and which layers must support without intruding. 
The key term in this process is selection. Most of us have databases full of information that could 
be put on maps; more often the trick is to remove what isn’t needed. Simplicity is one of the 
guiding tenets of cartography. Every piece of data should work to support the map objective. 
When selecting data for a map, one should also be aware of potential privacy issues or unintended 
economic consequences of presenting certain types of information. For example, laying a fault 
map on top of the city parcels layer might have consequences for the property values of parcels 
near faults. The public may not be aware that most faults are inactive and do not pose a threat. 
Maps of fossil sites or archeological digs must ensure that the exact locations of fossils or 
artifacts remain out of the public domain to protect them from poaching. One should also be 
cautious about putting private information on public maps, such as the names of parcel owners. 
The scale of the map is an important consideration, and the data layers selected should be 
appropriate. Coarse-scale data should not be placed on large-scale maps. Occasionally large-scale 
data may be needed on a small-scale map, although often some type of simplification must be 
applied to individual layers. This process is called cartographic generalization. Eight different

techniques are commonly employed (Fig. 5.2). With the exception of refinement, which can be 
performed using queries and selection layers, most of techniques will involve creating a new 
simplified feature class to be used in place of the original. 
TIP: ArcToolbox contains many of these generalization tools in the Cartography Tools toolset.  
To present information from a larger scale layer at a smaller 
scale, one might do the following: 
¾ Refine a feature class by omitting certain features, 
especially smaller or more detailed ones, for example 
removing higher order streams and keeping the main 
trunk rivers. 
¾ Simplify lines or polygons by removing vertices 
and/or smoothing to give them less detailed shapes. 
¾ Aggregate many smaller features into larger features, 
such as turning many close-lying small wetland 
polygons into a generalized marsh area. 
¾ Collapse features into more simple forms, such as 
turning detailed building footprints into simple 
rectangles. 
¾ Classify a more detailed set of attributes into a simpler 
set, such as reducing geologic formations to a 
classification of “igneous, metamorphic, or 
sedimentary.” 
Some types of changes involve “falsifying” the underlying 
spatial data and should be used sparingly. A note on the map 
should indicate that such techniques have impacted the 
locations and/or shapes of certain layers. 
¾ Typify features using representative rather than actual 
features, for example, replacing the point markers for 
actual homes with a smaller number of “fake” points 
representing scattered houses. 
¾ Displace features slightly so they do not run over each 
other, for example moving a road to avoid the 
appearance of an intersection with another road. 
¾ Exaggerate the importance of features to give them 
greater prominence, such as enlarging the width of a 
water body to prevent it appearing as a line. 
Map projections 
Selecting the map projection is another important task that 
depends on the objective of the map; for example, a map that 
requires distances to be measured must use a projection that preserves distance. Guidelines for 
choosing an appropriate projection were presented in Chapter 3; it is worth reiterating here that a 
geographic coordinate system is almost never appropriate for a map and should be avoided.

Sometimes the projection can influence the map 
story in unintended ways. The cylindrical Mercator 
projection has been popular for world maps and is 
used in web maps (Fig. 5.3a), but critics have 
charged that this projection enlarges countries in 
Eurasia and North America, sending a subliminal 
message that the northern hemisphere is more 
important than developing countries near the 
equator. Attempts have been made to popularize 
equal-area world projections that don’t exaggerate 
the northern hemisphere (Fig 5.3b).  
The projection may also influence the elements 
placed in a map. A conic projection does not 
preserve direction, and a single arrow cannot 
represent north everywhere on the map. A map that 
distorts distance should not have a single scale bar. 
In these maps, a graticule grid is employed, which shows latitude and longitude markings 
(Fig. 5.4a). Two other types of grids are often used on maps. A measurement grid shows the 
map units present in the coordinate system (Fig. 5.4b). A reference grid shows letters and 
numbers delineating each grid square (Fig. 5.4c). A reference grid is commonly found in a 
telephone directory in conjunction with a street index, allowing streets to be located within 
squares of the map. 
 
The Volcanic Hazards map will be focused on Washington and Oregon and have a scale of about 
1:4 million in an equidistant projection. Volcanoes are the main point; counties and capitals will 
portray populations (census tracts would be too detailed at this scale). Highways are needed to 
show escape routes. Rivers will be needed to show potential lahars (volcanic mud flows). 
Arrange the map elements 
The next step is to decide how the map will be arranged on the page. At this point it is a good 
idea to walk away from the computer and use a paper and pencil to sketch a rough mock-up of the 
design and decide how the parts of the map should be arranged, instead of succumbing to what is 
currently shown on the screen.

Return to the analogy of the map as a story. A story has main characters, supporting ones, and 
a defined path through the events. In a map, the direction of the story and the relative 
importance of the elements is achieved by establishing a visual hierarchy, which refers to the 
order in which the reader perceives the different objects in a design. A good map establishes a 
clear pathway through the map objects by using carefully arranged elements and appropriate 
symbols.  
Tools, not rules 
Map layouts traditionally contain certain map elements in addition to the map itself. A location 
map is used to show where the main map extends, especially when the main map is not easily 
recognizable to the readers. A legend explains the symbols used. A scale bar indicates distances 
and a north arrow shows direction. A graticule grid shows latitude-longitude lines or tics. A 
neatline can be used to enclose the entire map or groups of elements within it. Titles and text 
explain what the map is about and cite the data used to create it. Images or graphic shapes can be 
added to support the story. 
In grade school you might have learned that all maps must have a title, legend, scale bar, and 
north arrow, but that is not necessarily true. Some maps are so simple and well symbolized that a 
legend is not needed. Scale bars and north arrows may not be appropriate for some projections, 
and they may be superfluous even when allowed. A map portraying teacher salaries in the United 
States, for example, could omit both items; most viewers already know where north is, and 
distances have no bearing on the message of the map. It is better to think of this list of elements 
as tools, not rules, and use them only if they support the map objective. 
Balancing the elements 
A map with good balance and a clear visual hierarchy is achieved by paying attention to several 
important guidelines: the size of the elements, the visual center of a page, the rule of thirds, 
alignment of elements, and the treatment of negative space. 
The relative size of the map elements should be considered; larger 
objects will naturally command more attention. The scale of the 
map should be as large as possible to enhance the legibility of the 
map features. Scale bars, north arrows, and legends should be 
unobtrusive. Use large fonts to draw attention to titles and key 
points, and smaller text for informational details. The viewing 
distance must be considered; a poster map requires a minimum of 
18-pt font to be comfortably read from several feet away, and will 
generally need larger symbols as well. 
The visual center of a page is about 5% higher than the geometric 
center in the exact middle (Fig. 5.5). Centering the map on the 
geometric center makes the map appear unbalanced and heavy. 
The rule of thirds is a graphic arts principle used to enliven a 
design; although it is primarily used as a guide to composing 
photographs, it can also be helpful in map design. Imagine the page 
cut into horizontal and vertical thirds (Fig 5.6). Important elements 
placed on these intersections will have greater impact than if placed 
in the center of the map. 
Fig. 5.5. The visual center 
of a map (X) is 5% higher 
than the geometric center. 
Fig. 5.6. The rule of thirds 
suggests putting important 
points at these intersections.

145 
Alignment of the map elements is also important. This goal can be achieved in two ways. First, 
arrange the map elements into columns or rows, rather than letting them wander all over the page. 
Second, be sure that the edges of elements align with each other.  
A rough sketch or mock-up is helpful in evaluating the balance and 
visual hierarchy of a design. In Figure 5.7, the gray boxes represent 
placeholders for the main map elements. Notice that two columns 
have been envisioned, one for the main map on the left (which is 
centered on the left line of thirds), and a second column for the other 
elements. The exterior edges of all three elements are exactly aligned 
at the top, left, and right. 
The visual center and rule of thirds influence the view path, because 
the eye is typically drawn to these areas first, other things being 
equal. In addition, the eye tends to travel from left to right because it is used to reading that 
way (although this would be reversed in countries using right-to-left languages). A good map 
design uses these influences rather than working against them. Which way does the eye move in 
Figure 5.7? Probably you saw the large square on the left first, then moved to the upper right and 
down. Placing the map, title, and legend in these three areas, respectively, would create a logical 
flow through the map. 
The treatment of negative space, or the blank areas on the page, is more important than it might 
first appear. Although large irregular blank areas make a map look unbalanced, too little space 
can make a design appear crowded. Negative space can actually be used as another design 
element, which can separate or group elements more subtly and naturally than neatlines. In 
Figure 5.7, the negative space serves to separate the three main map elements. Page margins are 
an important type of negative space. 
Maps often show irregularly shaped geographic regions that require creativity in achieving 
balance. Imagine placing California in the layout shown in Figure 5.7. The map area is relatively 
small, limiting the scale and the legibility of the features. Moreover, the state’s shape creates 
irregular negative space inside the map frame. Figure 5.8 shows three alternative treatments based 
on a portrait layout that maximizes the scale. The non-map elements are placed inside the data 
frame (a space solution that may not occur to beginning map designers, but which can be highly 
effective). Give each design a swift glance. Which one feels the most balanced?

Figure 5.8a ignored the visual center and placed Californa near the bottom, creating a heavy 
sensation exacerbated by two more blocks added to fill the negative space. The visual center is 
actually blank in this layout. The upper elements draw the eye first and then force it left to the 
map, ignoring the left-to-right preference. Some parts of the map appear crowded, others too 
empty. The edges are not aligned, and the neatline crowds the map. 
In Figure 5.8b, the state is now too high, although the negative space is more evenly balanced. 
The edges are very irregular now and the elements appear haphazardly arranged. They crowd the 
state in some spots and leave open areas in others. The eye is drawn to the map first and travels 
left-to-right across it, which is fine, but then is unsure what to view next. 
Figure 5.8c is the best arrangement so far. In this case, the placeholders for the elements have 
been reshaped to echo the state’s shape, which leaves uninterrupted negative space around 
California and helps draw attention to it. The north and south sections of the state fall roughly in 
the target areas advocated by the rule of thirds and encourage the eye to scan the state left-to-
right. The exterior edges of all elements fall on the boundary of the data frame, which subtly 
encloses the map and allows the neatline to be removed. 
In the tutorial map, Washington and Oregon form a roughly rectangular shape with little negative 
space, so the supporting elements can go outside the data frame. The map can be placed on the 
left to draw the eye first. The elements will include a location map, a legend, and some titles and 
supporting text. An equidistant projection and a scale bar will be used in case the reader wishes to 
estimate distances from the volcanoes to the vulnerable populations. 
Symbolize the data 
Symbolizing the features in the layout has enormous impact on the final result. Chapter 4 
introduced ways in which symbols may be manipulated by changing their shape, size, thickness, 
line type, font, and color. It also discussed the ways that color can be used most effectively for 
different data types, and introduced potential issues, such as color blindness, conventions, and 
connotations, that should influence the choice of colors. All of these principles remain important, 
but in a layout we must also consider the interaction of symbols between multiple layers. 
Symbolization is a powerful tool for manipulating the visual hierarchy in a layout through color, 
contrast, foreground/background relationships, size, symbol type, patterns, and branding. 
Color is one of the strongest influences in a map. Dark, saturated colors attract attention and 
help indicate the focus of a map, and so should be used sparingly. Pastel colors will tend to fade 
away and are perfect for the supporting layers. Color can also be used to group features or 
map elements—objects that are shown in similar colors will be perceived to belong with each 
other. 
Another important aspect of color is contrast, or the juxtaposition of colors with very different 
hue, value, or saturation. Consider Figure 5.9a: How many squares do you see? Did you neglect 
the fifth square? The dark squares seem to stand out above the gray one, commanding the 
foreground, while the gray fades away into the background. This effect is achieved by the 
saturation and value of the colors, and even more by the contrast between them. The blue stands 
out more than the orange, and the outlines heighten the contrast still more, especially the orange 
outline that contrasts with the interior orange as well as the gray exterior. The visual hierarchy 
encourages the eye to start in the lower right and move clockwise.

147 
 
The effects of color and contrast are repeated in Figure 5.9b, with the dark blue lines appearing 
more prominent than the gray one. Line thickness and symbol style also affect the hierarchy, with 
thicker and more continuous lines dominating thinner or discontinuous ones. (Which is more 
prominent, the thick gray line or the thin blue one?) In Figure 5.9c, the additional attribute of size 
is varied; the larger something is, the more attention it commands. Text symbols have font and 
style, in addition to size and color, to rank them in the hierarchy (Fig. 5.9d).  
Humans do not simply perceive objects on a page; the brain 
works actively to organize the objects into patterns and 
interpret what it sees. Consider the four different panels in 
Figure 5.9—what makes them into different panels? First, the 
negative space between the gray squares separates them. 
Second, the similarity of the symbols within each panel 
(rectangles, lines, points, text) encourages the brain to group 
them together. The separation is balanced, however, by the use 
of repeated colors to tie the entire figure together. What is the 
effect of having the single purple triangle? Does it stand out 
more than if it were orange like the square? 
Look at each box in Figure 5.10 and pay attention to how your 
brain tries to group the markers. Which variation (size, color, or 
shape) makes the points easiest to group? Which sets are easier 
to separate? Which ones emphasize that the points belong to one 
map layer? When evaluating symbols for layers, take note of 
how your mind attempts to group or separate objects, and use 
these effects to help support the visual hierarchy.  
Symbols in a map should bring the important elements to the foreground and relegate less 
important features to the background. In Figure 5.11a, the world map has no clear hierarchy; the 
ocean and graticules grab as much attention as the country populations. Three slight adjustments 
make the hierarchy clear: (1) the oceans are displayed in light blue to displace them to the 
background; (2) the graticules are colored light gray to decrease the contrast; and (3) the graticules 
are placed behind the countries to further enforce them as background elements (Fig. 11b).

Of course, establishing the hierarchy is more difficult when many layers (and text) are involved. 
When in doubt how to treat a layer, one should always return to the objective of the map and ask 
what role the layer plays—should it be emphasized, 
downplayed, or even removed, to better achieve the map 
objective? Examine the different ArcGIS Online basemaps 
and study how they achieve visual hierarchy. The Terrain 
With Labels basemap is an especially good example of 
differentiating between multiple background layers without 
swamping user data placed in the foreground (Fig. 5.12). 
Another factor in choosing symbols for the map is the 
desire to achieve branding. An organization may wish to 
impart a certain look or feel to its maps across all of its 
publications through the consistent use of certain colors, 
fonts, marker symbols, line types, or images. It is not 
difficult to select symbols to honor these choices. For an 
example of branding, examine the National Geographic 
basemap in ArcGIS Online. If you were ever a National 
Geographic reader, you will find a familiar face in this map.  
In the tutorial map, the volcanoes and population information are most important, followed by the 
transportation. The county populations will cover the most map area and will be symbolized in 
shades of orange; other colors will be chosen to develop the appropriate contrast. 
Review the draft 
The review step should not be skimped, any more than you would neglect to proofread a research 
paper before turning it in. However, we are looking for more than typographical or grammatical 
errors. We must return once again to the map objective and evaluate how well the map succeeds 
in telling its story. 
Author’s first review 
Start with your own review, applying the principles in this chapter. Is it easy to determine what 
the map is about? Is the map balanced? Is it clear what is foreground and what is background? 
Does the eye go first to the more important elements, or does it dart all over, unsure what to focus 
on? Do the symbols clearly portray the message? Are the colors and arrangement pleasant? 
Hopefully you have been applying these principles all through the design, but now is the time to 
make sure they all work together.

Don’t neglect the details. Make sure the 
margins are sufficient for the printer 
being used. Check for errors in spelling 
and grammar. Evaluate the legend for 
common mistakes, such as using file 
names rather than real words, using 
inappropriate significant figures, or 
allowing the neatline to crowd the text 
(Fig. 5.13). Many cartographers feel 
that the title “Legend” is superfluous 
and do not care to see it on maps.  
Be aware of significant figures in all 
publications. Not only do excessive 
figures make the classes hard to interpret (Fig. 5.13), but also they announce that someone does 
not understand his or her data. Population, for example, is always an estimate, and it is ridiculous 
to state it down to the last place (or worse, with decimals). Classifying already reduces data to a 
small set of bins; variations in the hundreds and thousands make little difference. 
Do not assume that every layer needs to go in the legend. If a set of features is familiar to all map 
viewers (such as state boundaries on a United States map) or is so apparent from the title or 
purpose of the map (labeled paths on a city walking tour map), consider leaving them out of the 
legend. Consider those basemaps again—they generally have no legends, yet most viewers have 
no difficulty recognizing what is being shown (Fig. 5.12). 
Let’s see how an initial map review is conducted by the author. The map on the left in Figure 5.14a 
shows a first draft based mostly on software defaults. (Hopefully a first draft would be better than 
this one, but unfortunately the author has seen similar student maps turned in for an assignment.) 
Assume that the map objective is to educate the viewer about variations in household size in the 
United States, with emphasis on areas with larger-than-usual households. Cover the map on the 
right and see if you can identify all the ways that the draft map might be improved. Then read on. 
Evaluate the balance first. The map is placed in the visual center, but everything else is poorly 
arranged. The elements are crowded on the bottom and leave a large negative space above, from 
which Alaska dangles down, neither in nor out of the map. The cartographer has tried to fill the 
space with a box and shadow around the title, but that is a gimmicky solution. The legend is large 
compared to the map and contains too many significant figures. The neatlines around the legend 
and text boxes distract from the map. The scale and north arrow are too large, the north arrow is 
inappropriate in a conic projection, and the scale bar is immaterial to the map objective. The 
element edges are not aligned. The visual path is not clear; the eye is drawn first to the map, 
which is fine, but then it tends to bounce around between the other elements. 
The symbolization in Figure 5.14a is also ineffective. The map uses a color scheme that 
resembles natural geographic features rather than human ones and, because it is based on hue 
rather than saturation or value, does not clearly indicate quantity. The red hues draw attention to 
the low values in the visual hierarchy—the opposite of the map objective. The rivers and lakes 
are irrelevant to the topic and distract from the message. 
The revision on the right seems like a different map (Fig. 14b). A landscape orientation better fits 
the shape of the United States and allows a larger scale for the map to improve legibility. The

color scheme shows quantities and draws attention to the high values using dark, bold colors. The 
lakes and rivers have been removed. The legend has been reduced to the single layer that needs 
explaining, the significant figures have been corrected, and the redundant “Legend” heading was 
deleted. The distracting neatlines around the legend and text are gone, and the text has been 
anchored across the lower neatline. The new colors and expanded width help the title appear as 
part of the map, rather than floating aimlessly above it. The visual hierarchy is simple and clear. 
External review 
Equally important is to have others look at the map to ensure that the intended message of the 
author is clear to the readers. These reviewers need not be experts; in fact, if one is designing the 
map for a general audience, then those are the type of people who should review it. 
The first impression made by a layout is extremely important. Maps are not just rational, logical 
documents like spreadsheets—they can have emotional impacts, and the author must know what 
kinds of emotions the map elicits from the target audience. Start by giving the reviewers about 
3–4 seconds to look at the map; then take it away and ask: What were the first things that you 
noticed? Was your overall impression positive or negative? What made you feel that way? 
Let them look at the map again for a few more minutes. Then ask them what they think the map is 
about, and what it is telling them. Ask if any part of the map is confusing or too complicated. This 
feedback will help evaluate whether the map accomplishes its objective. At this point one can 
also get more detailed feedback on a design if the reviewers are knowledgeable users, qualified in 
cartography or in the field the map represents. 
As you digest the review information, keep in mind that design principles sometimes conflict 
with each other in a particular situation, and a choice must be made based on which guideline
will best achieve the map objective. On occasion, you may want to break a guideline on purpose 
to achieve a particular effect, as some novelists may sometimes use sentence fragments—just 
make sure you are doing it for a good reason and not out of ignorance or laziness. One should 
also remember that a map is not correct or incorrect, any more than a novel or a painting can be.

However, some maps are better than others. As you review your maps and consider alternative 
strategies to achieve the map objective, keep asking yourself, “Would this make the map better?” 
Observing other people’s maps is a great way to become a better cartographer. Spend time 
training your reviewing eye. When you see a map anywhere, give it the first impression test by 
looking at it for a few seconds. Notice what stood out and whether your first impression was 
positive or negative, and why you felt that way. Practice analyzing the visual pathway through a 
map and how it is achieved (or ignored). Then evaluate the map’s balance and symbology. What 
works well? What doesn’t? How could it be improved? When you see a great technique, 
incorporate it into your own maps. 
We will review the Volcanic Hazards map as part of the tutorial. 
Edit and improve 
Based on the review step, you will likely find some things to change. Sometimes they will be 
minor edits, at other times you may need to go back to one or more of the selecting, arranging, 
and symbolizing steps for a more drastic redesign. Regardless, there are a few principles to keep 
in mind when editing. 
Concentrate the message. Make sure that every part of the design is working toward the map 
objective in the clearest way possible. Include the minimum number of layers and elements 
needed to accomplish the map purpose. You would be surprised at how often removing a layer or 
reclassifying a complex symbol scheme will improve a map.  
Simplify, simplify. Many maps are needlessly complicated, with too many different 
kinds of text, symbols, or fonts. Just because the software lets you give neatlines, 
fill colors, and shadows to objects doesn’t mean that they are always a good idea—
they should serve a purpose, such as a neutral background to separate a scale bar 
from the map behind it. Remember that negative space is often a great way to 
separate or group map elements. Stay away from complicated cartoon symbols—they may be 
popular for web maps but they quickly start to interfere with the map interpretation. The less junk 
is placed on the map, the clearer the intended message will be. 
Experiment. If a design just doesn’t seem to be working well, experiment. Save a copy of the 
map under a new name and try something daring, like changing the page orientation and 
completely rearranging the elements. Rethink, resymbolize. That’s the beauty of computer 
cartography—it is easy to try something different with no risk. 
Test it. Before pronouncing the map complete, test it under the conditions of actual use. For  
paper maps, print a test copy on the same printer to be used for production. Colors on a screen 
may differ significantly from the printed colors, and you may need to adjust to get the desired 
result. Margins may shift, causing the map to appear uncentered on the page. If it is a poster, print 
it full size and hang it on the wall, then step back and make sure that the arrangement and fonts 
work well from a viewing distance of two meters. If it is a web map, try it on several computers, 
on a tablet, and on a smartphone to ensure that it works for all media on which it might be 
viewed.

About ArcGIS 
Maps in ArcGIS 
ArcGIS provides an environment for cartography that 
spans the range from creating a simple map for a report 
to preparing sets of maps for commercial printing. This 
chapter covers the basic steps to create a printer-ready 
map, but the reader should be aware that many advanced 
cartographic tools are available, as well as tools for 
developing graphs and database report printouts; 
although they are not covered here, the Help files have 
more information about them. 
In ArcGIS, the draft of a map intended for printing or 
distribution is called a layout. The layout mode in 
ArcMap facilitates map design by incorporating data 
frames and map elements, such as legends, north arrows, 
scale bars, text, and more. Figure 5.15 shows a map 
from a series of 1:24,000-scale maps produced to show 
properties of aquifers for 7.5-minute quadrangles in the 
Black Hills of South Dakota. The maps were intended to 
mimic the design of a standard USGS topographic 
quadrangle. They can be printed on a large-format 
plotter if one is available but are being distributed 
primarily as PDF-format files. The development of the 
data and the map layout took place in ArcGIS Desktop. 
(The layout has been drastically reduced in the figure, but originals of this and similar maps can 
be downloaded from http://www.sdsmt.edu/aquifers.) 
Each map document can contain one map layout. Map documents may also be saved as 
templates, which can be used to re-create a design again and again or to give an organization’s 
maps a common format and look. It is also possible to create map books, in which the sample 
map design is applied to multiple tiles covering a larger area, with the map extents, legends, titles, 
and other aspects generated automatically for each map using a feature called Data Driven Pages. 
Assigning map scales 
GIS spatial data acquire a scale as soon as they are drawn on a computer screen, printed on paper, 
or saved in a PDF. The first step of creating any map is generally to define the size of the layout 
page, which will be influenced by the page-size capabilities of the available printers. Once the 
page size is set, the data frames are arranged on the layout page, and the user must decide how 
much of the map data will be shown within the data frame. The map extent is defined as the 
range of x-y values displayed in the data frame. Zooming in reduces the map extent; zooming out 
enlarges it. The printed scale is determined by the map extent and the size of the data frame on 
the paper. Assigning the map scale of a data frame can follow one of three strategies. 
Automatic scaling is used most frequently (Fig. 5.16a). The user sets the size and position of the 
data frame on the layout page and zooms in or out of the data until the desired map extent is 
achieved. The user does not try to impose a specific scale but uses his or her eye and aesthetic 
sense to balance the map frame with the other map elements.

Division 
Subdivision 
Division unit 
Fig. 5.17. Terminology of a scale bar 
Fixed scale is employed when the printed map must have a specific scale, such as 1:24,000. In 
this mode, the features always appear at the same size, and changing the data frame size changes 
the map extent (and may crop the map if the user is not careful) (Fig. 5.16b). Zooming in or out 
of the map data would change the scale and is not permitted, but panning is. 
Fixed extent adopts the current map extent and prevents it from changing. The data frame can be 
resized, which changes the scale of the map but not its extent (Fig. 5.16c). The aspect ratio of the 
data frame is also fixed. The Zoom and Pan tools are unavailable in Fixed Extent mode. 
 
Setting up scale bars 
Some maps should contain either a scale bar or a statement of the scale, such as “This map is 
shown at a scale of 1:62,500.” ArcMap can automatically construct a suitable scale and resize it 
when the map scale changes. The user has to set several options, which requires some knowledge 
of terminology. 
The divisions are the sections into which the scale is divided. The scale bar in Figure 5.17 has 
four divisions. The first division may be subdivided, yielding what are called subdivisions. This 
scale bar also has four subdivisions. The division units are the units of measurement used to 
divide the scale bar (miles in this case). The division value is the length of each division, 
expressed in division units. This scale bar 
has a division value of 0.5 mile. The 
division units, the map scale, the division 
size, and the length of the scale bar are 
interrelated. Zooming changes the map 
scale and requires the scale bar to change 
also. Three options control how the scale 
bar responds to changes in map scale. 
Divisions should be expressed in rounded, 
easily divisible numbers to make them 
easy to use for estimating distances.

Adjust Width keeps the division size and number of divisions constant. If the map scale changes, the 
entire scale bar gets larger or smaller. This method keeps nicely rounded numbers for the divisions 
but may result in an unacceptably small- or large-scale bar if the scale changes dramatically. 
Adjust Division Value keeps the scale bar roughly the same length on the page and with the same 
number of divisions but changes the size of the divisions. If the map scale changes, the division 
size of the scale in Figure 5.17 might go from 0.5 mile to 0.6 or 0.4. This option preserves the 
width of the scale bar but may result in awkward division sizes and labels. 
Adjust Number of Divisions leaves the division value constant and adds or subtracts full 
divisions if the scale changes. For minor changes in scale, the bar will increase or decrease 
slightly in size. For dramatic changes, the scale bar will remain about the same size but may have 
more or fewer divisions. The bar in Figure 5.17, for example, might become 1 mile long or 
3 miles long, but the division size would stay 0.5. 
Labeling, text, and annotation 
ArcGIS offers several ways to place text on maps. You have already learned how to create 
dynamic labels, which are derived from a feature attribute and applied to an entire layer at once. 
Graphic text is used to place a few labels, one at a time. Annotation is used to gain exact control 
of labels. We briefly summarize the key features of each type. 
Graphic text items are constructed by the user, one at a time. Different 
tools are provided to create standard, splined, callout, or multiline text or 
to label a feature using the value from its attribute table (Fig. 5.18). All 
graphic text exists on the map as simple graphic elements. Items remain 
where they are placed but are inefficient when many labels must be 
made. You must be in Layout view to create graphic text. However, the 
Label tool is an exception; it derives the text for the label from the 
attribute table and must be placed in Data view. 
Dynamic labels are created from an attribute and are redrawn every time 
the user changes the map view. They can be turned on or off as needed. 
Dynamic labels utilize a placement algorithm that omits overlapping labels. Which labels are 
displayed can vary, depending on the zoom scale and label size. Although largely automatic, 
dynamic labels provide some control options. The Placement Properties help manage the overlap 
and optimization of the labels to give the best possible result. The Conflict Detection options can 
handle priorities between different layers. 
Because the labels are redrawn each time, printing maps with dynamic labels can bring surprises. 
What shows on the screen does not necessarily appear the same way on the map. For many 
purposes a few extra or missing labels do not matter. If they do, however, converting labels to 
annotation provides greater control over label placement. 
Annotation provides precise control of individual labels. Ordinary dynamic labels can be 
converted to annotation. The labels that fit on the map are automatically placed, and the 
overlapping labels are directed to an overflow window for interactive placement. Once placed, 
the annotation label always appears in the same place. Annotation may be stored in three ways.

In the map document. The annotation is stored as graphic text and is edited using the Draw 
toolbar. This annotation can be used only in a single map document.

¾ As a feature class in a geodatabase. The annotation can be used in multiple map 
documents. Editing must be used to modify it, so we cover this method in Chapter 13. 
¾ As a feature-linked annotation in a geodatabase. The annotation is linked to the 
corresponding point, line, or polygon features. If the feature is deleted, so is the 
annotation. This type is available with ArcGIS Standard or Advanced licenses.  
Reference scale 
When labels and annotation are created, they are assigned a size in points. For a given map, the 
size of the text relative to the features, such as the counties shown in Figure 5.19a, is determined 
by the text point size and the current map scale. But what happens if you zoom in? By default, the 
labels (and symbols) stay the same size when the user zooms in or out (Fig. 5.19b); 12-pt text 
remains 12-pt. text regardless of the scale of the map. 
This behavior changes if the user sets the reference scale, which is a property of the data frame. 
The reference scale is the scale at which the labels and symbols appear at their assigned size. If a 
user places 12-pt. labels on a map with a scale of 1:100,000, then the labels will appear 12 pt. in 
size only as long as the map scale remains 1:100,000. If the user zooms in, the labels and symbols 
increase in size (Fig. 5.19c). If the user zooms out, they decrease in size.  
TIP: Be sure to understand the difference among the terms map scale, reference scale, and 
visible scale range. Map scale determines the ratio of features on the map to features on the 
ground. The reference scale is the scale at which symbols and text appear at their assigned size. 
The visible scale range determines the range of scales at which a layer will appear.

Summary 
¾ Designing a map consists of six interlinked steps: determine the objective, select the data, 
arrange the elements, symbolize the elements, review the map, and edit/improve. 
¾ Maps serve many purposes, each of which influences the content, medium, target audience, 
and conditions of use. 
¾ Every set of data included should serve the purpose of the map and be appropriate to the map 
scale. Layers that are too detailed can be simplified through cartographic generalization. 
¾ A suitable map projection that supports the map objective must be used; it may influence 
whether a north arrow or scale bar is appropriate for the map. 
¾ Visual hierarchy refers to the order in which the reader perceives the different objects in a 
design; it is manipulated using the arrangement and symbolization of map elements. 
¾ Balanced arrangement of map elements uses the size, visual center, rule of thirds, alignment, 
and negative space to establish a visual path through the map. 
¾ Symbolization affects the visual hierarchy through size, color, contrast, 
foreground/background relationships, font, symbol style, and pattern. 
¾ The map should be reviewed by the author and also by other to ensure that it meets its 
objective and is free of petty errors. First impressions are important. 
¾ When editing and improving the map, work to concentrate the message and simplify the 
presentation. Be sure to test the map under the conditions of actual use. 
¾ Three types of labeling are available. Interactive labels are used to place any kind of text. 
Dynamic labels are automatically generated for entire layers at a time. Annotation is created 
from dynamic labels but can be precisely controlled.

Mastering the Skills 
Teaching Tutorial  
The following examples provide step-by-step instructions for doing basic tasks and solving 
problems in ArcGIS. The steps you need to do are highlighted with an arrow Î; follow them 
carefully. Click on the video number in the Video Index to view a demonstration of the steps. 
  Î Start ArcMap. Choose Existing Maps > Browse for more… on the splash screen, and 
open the ex_5a.mxd map document from the mgisdata\MapDocuments folder.  
  Î Use Save As to rename the document and remember to save frequently as you work. 
 
1Î Switch to Layout view by clicking the Layout button in the lower-left corner of the 
map window.  
1Î If the Layout toolbar is not visible, choose Customize > Toolbars > Layout. 
1Î Click the Zoom Whole Page button on the Layout toolbar, if necessary, to see the 
entire page. 
Setting up the map page 
This map document has been set up to show volcanic hazards in Washington and Oregon, and we 
will use it as a starting place to learn about creating layouts. First, we are going to change the 
page layout and turn on the grid so we can align the objects more easily. 
1Î Choose File > Page and Print Setup from the main menu bar. 
1Î Examine the options to see what these are. 
Look at the two sections labeled Paper and Map Page Size. The lower Map Page Size section 
controls the size and layout of the map itself. Always set this section first. 
TIP: Always design and edit a map at the size at which you intend to print it. 
The Paper section is used to modify the printer settings at the time of printing. It need not be set 
until you are ready to print. In many cases, the settings will be the same as the Map Page Size. 
However, after you have created an 11-inch by 17-inch map, you might decide to print it on a 
letter-size page for a report. Setting the Paper section makes it possible. 
1Î Uncheck the box to Use the Printer Paper settings if it is checked. 
1Î Check the button to Scale the map elements proportionally to changes in page size to 
help in resizing the frames later. 
1Î Fill the button to change the Map Page Size to Landscape orientation.  
1Î Also set the Paper orientation to Landscape. Click OK. 
TIP: Checking the box to use the Printer Paper settings is not recommended unless you always 
use the same printer. It can cause undesired changes in the layout if you switch printers. 

Presenting GIS Data 
159 
2Î To set the grid, choose Customize > ArcMap Options from the main menu and click 
the Layout View tab. 
2Î Notice the options for setting rulers: the page units (currently inches), the grid, and 
snapping.  
A grid is a set of points a specified distance apart (now 
set to 0.25 inch). When snapping is on, objects within 
the snap tolerance (currently 0.2 inch) will be 
automatically snapped to the closest grid location. This 
feature simplifies aligning map elements.  
2Î Check the Show box under the Grid 
section to show the grid (Fig. 5.20). 
2Î Check the Grid box under the Snap 
elements to section and make sure the Snap 
Tolerance is 0.2 inch. 
2Î Click OK to close the Options box. 
The Layout toolbar (Fig. 5.21) provides zoom tools 
that look similar to those on the regular Tools bar, but 
they affect the view of the page only, not the map inside the data frame. A demonstration will 
help show the difference. 
3Î Find the Fixed Zoom Out 
button on the Tools toolbar 
and click it three times. The 
map gets smaller within the 
data frame, but the page remains fixed in the map window. 
3Î Find the Fixed Zoom In button on the Tools toolbar and click it three times to return 
to the initial extent. 
3Î Now find the Fixed Zoom Out tool on the Layout toolbar and click it three times. 
Notice that the entire page now gets smaller, but the map continues to occupy a 
constant area of the data frame. 
3Î Use the Zoom Whole Page button on the Layout toolbar to fill the map window with 
the layout again.  
TIP: The Zoom/Pan tools on the Tools toolbar control the scale and placement of the map in the 
active data frame. The Zoom/Pan tools on the Layout toolbar control the view of the layout page. 
Now let’s see how grid snapping works. 
4Î Click the Select Elements tool on the Draw or Tools toolbar. Click the Hazards 
frame to select it, and drag it to a new location. Notice that the frame corner snaps to a 
grid point when it gets close. 
4Î Use the blue handles and snapping to give the data frame 0.75-inch margins on the 
top, bottom, and left sides (remember, each dot of the grid is 0.25 inch apart). 
TIP: Always provide ample margins to avoid cropping when the map is printed.

Next, we will set up the basic layout design. Although it is simple to arrange data frames by 
clicking, dragging, and resizing, sometimes precise sizes and locations are needed. Set these 
options using the data frame properties. 
5Î In the Table of Contents, right-click the Hazards data frame and choose Properties. 
5Î Click the Size and Position tab. 
5Î Check that the X and Y positions are set to 0.75 (inch) where you placed the corner 
earlier. The page has coordinates of inches, with 0.0 at the lower left.  
5Î In the Size window, uncheck the As Percentage box if needed. Set the frame size to 
6 inches wide and 7 inches high. Click OK. 
TIP: If the map does not redraw completely, use the Refresh button, located next to the Layout 
and Data view buttons, to redraw it. 
5Î Use the Zoom/Pan tools on the Tools toolbar to center the Hazards map and make it 
fill the frame. 
SKILL TIP: Learn how to set the data frame to use the Fixed Scale or Fixed Extent scaling 
method (Layouts and Data Frames). 
Creating a location map 
Many maps, especially if they show a place that is not commonly known, include a location map 
to inform the viewer where the map is. To add a location map, we need another data frame.  
6Î Choose Insert > Data Frame from the 
main menu bar. 
6Î Click on the Select Elements tool.  
6Î Place it on the new data frame and click 
and drag to move the frame to the lower 
right of the page. 
6Î Use the blue handles and the snapping 
function to place the new frame 0.25 inch 
from the Hazards frame and 0.75 inch 
from the edge of the page (Fig. 5.22). 
6Î Find the New Data Frame name in the 
Table of Contents and click it twice slowly 
to rename it USA. 
6Î If the name appears in boldface type, USA is already the active frame. If not,  
right-click the name and choose Activate. 
 
7Î Add the states feature class from the mgisdata\Usa\usdata geodatabase. 
7Î Use the Zoom In tool from the Tools toolbar to zoom in to the conterminous  
US states. 
7Î Right-click the states layer symbol and choose a light yellow color. 
Fig. 5.22. Arrange the frames like this. 

Presenting GIS Data 
161 
A location map usually includes a box showing the extent of the main map. We can add this as a 
property of the USA data frame. 
8Î Right-click the USA data frame name and choose Properties. Click the Extent 
Indicators tab. 
8Î Click on the Hazards name in the window to highlight it, and click the > button to 
move it to the right side. 
8Î Check the box to Use simple extent (the outline of the data frame). 
8Î Click the Frame button and use the drop-down to choose a 3-pt. border for the extent 
rectangle. Change its color to a dark orange. Click OK and OK. 
We have not yet considered the issue of the map projection for this frame. The Hazards frame 
uses an equidistant conic projection centered on the two states, minimizing distortion. 
9Î Double-click the USA frame to open its properties. 
9Î Click on the Coordinate System tab and read the information. Write the coordinate 
system here. ________________________________________________________ 
Although the USA frame is also using an equidistant conic projection, it is centered in the middle 
of the country and distorts direction at the edges of the map. Notice that north does not point 
straight up, and the extent rectangle is skewed. This makes the location map confusing. We 
should choose a projection that preserves direction for the location map. 
1. Which projection(s) from the front cover of the book preserves direction? ______________ 
9Î On the data frame Coordinate System tab, expand the Projected Coordinate Systems 
> World folder. 
9Î Choose the Mercator (world) projection and click OK.  
9Î Check the box not to warn you again in this session, and then click Yes to use the 
coordinate system. A datum difference at this scale is not significant. 
 
10Î Double-click the USA data frame name to open its properties. Click on the Size and 
Position tab. 
10Î Set the data frame height to exactly 2 inches and click OK. 
10Î Use the Zoom/Pan tools on the Tools toolbar to center the US map in the data frame. 
Using graphic text on layouts 
You can create graphic text on the layout using one of the text tools on 
the Draw toolbar. You must be in Layout view to place graphic text. 
11Î Click the New Text tool on the Draw toolbar. The black 
triangle indicates that more text tools are accessible from this 
icon (Fig. 5.23). 
11Î In the larger Hazards frame, click offshore of the states 
and type Pacific Ocean. Press Enter.  
11Î Click once on the text to select it. The blue dashed line 
around the text indicates that it is selected. 
11Î This horizontal label does not fit well, so click the Delete 
key to remove it. 
Fig. 5.23. Text tools 

Chapter 5 
162 
TIP: To work with graphics, use the Select Elements tool from the Draw toolbar. To delete text, 
click the text to select it and press the Delete key. Use the Select Elements tool to draw a box 
around many text items, or hold down the Ctrl-key to select multiple text boxes.  
12Î Let’s try a different text tool. Click on the black arrow next to the New Text tool 
and select the Splined Text tool. 
12Î Click to enter vertices of a line that curves along the coast of Oregon and 
Washington from south to north. Double-click to end the line. 
12Î A small text box appears. Type in Pacific Ocean and press Enter. The text appears 
splined along the line you entered. 
12Î Change the text size to 24 pt., the style to Italic, and the color to blue, using the 
buttons on the Draw toolbar. 
12Î Right-click the Pacific Ocean text and choose Properties. Change the Character 
Spacing to 36 pt. to stretch the label out along the coast. 
The graphic text tools require you to type the text to be displayed. The Label tool, however, can 
read the label from an attribute field in the feature class table. It uses the primary display field, 
which is one of the layer properties. 
13Î Right-click the Capitals layer and choose Properties. Click the Display tab and 
check the Display Expression Field to verify that it is set to NAME. Click OK. 
13Î Try to choose the Label tool from the drop-down button for the interactive labels. It 
is dimmed because the Label tool must be used in Data view. 
13Î Click the Data view button. Activate the Hazards frame, if necessary.  
 
14Î Choose the Label tool. The Label Tool Options window appears. 
14Î Keep the default option to Automatically find best placement.  
14Î Fill the button to Choose a style. Scroll down and click on the Capital style. 
 
15Î Click on the capital of Oregon and watch the “Salem” label appear. If you 
accidentally click the wrong feature, delete the label and try again. 
15Î Click on the capital of Washington (Olympia). 
15Î Use the Select Elements tool to reposition the labels to be clearly seen. 
15Î Return to Layout view. 
TIP: Graphic text and other types of graphics are termed Elements. To Select All Elements or 
Unselect All Elements, use the functions in the Edit pull-down menu on the main menu bar. 
Working with dynamic labels and annotation 
Dynamic labels are quick to set up, but annotation offers precise control. We will create two sets 
of annotation for this map: one inside the triangles to indicate the number of eruptions and one to 
label the volcano names. Annotation is created from dynamic labels.  

Presenting GIS Data 
163 
To avoid clutter, we want labels only for the volcanoes with more than five eruptions. We will 
use a query to select the desired volcanoes and then create a layer from the selection. 
16Î Right-click the Volcanoes layer and choose Open Attribute Table. 
16Î Click the Select by Attributes button in the Table window. 
16Î Enter the expression KNOWN_ERUP >= 5. Verify it and click Apply. 
The selected volcanoes are highlighted in the table and on the map. Next, we will create a layer 
containing only the selected volcanoes. 
17Î Close the Table window. 
17Î Right-click the Volcanoes layer name in the Table of Contents and choose 
Selection > Create Layer from Selected Features. 
17Î A new layer appears at the top of the Table of Contents, called Volcanoes selection. 
Rename it Volcano Labels.  
17Î Right-click the Volcanoes layer and choose Selection > Clear Selected Features. 
Next, we’ll create dynamic labels for the Volcano Labels layer. Since we are only using the layer 
for the labels, we will also make the symbols invisible. 
18Î Open the Volcano Labels properties and click the Labels tab. 
18Î Turn on the labels, set the label field to NAME, and make the labels Arial 10 pt. 
bold font. Give the labels halos, if you wish. 
18Î Keeping the Layer Properties window open, click on the Symbology tab. 
18Î Set the symbol to Circle 1, the size to 1, and the color to No Color. Click OK twice. 
SKILL TIP: Use the Label Manager to more easily set and control labels for multiple layers at 
once (Labels and Annotation). 
19Î Open the Volcanoes properties and click the Labels tab. 
19Î Turn on the labels, set the label field to KNOWN_ERUP, and set the symbol to 
Arial 8 pt. 
19Î Click the Placement Properties button and fill the button to Place label on top of the 
point. Click OK and OK. 
19Î Examine the map to make sure you set everything correctly. You should have 
eruption numbers in the triangles and name labels for seven volcanoes. (There are 
labels for the inactive volcanoes with 0 eruptions, but we will delete these later.) 
TIP: Annotation is created for the data frame and includes all the labels currently set for the data 
frame. You must turn off any layer labels that you don’t want converted.  
20Î Right-click the Hazards data frame name in the Table of Contents and choose 
Convert Labels to Annotation. 
20Î Fill the button to Store annotation in the map. 
20Î Notice the reference scale value listed in the upper-right corner. This is the scale at 
which the labels will appear at their assigned point size. 

Chapter 5 
164 
20Î Choose to Create annotation for features in the current extent. 
20Î Make sure that only the layers Volcano Labels and Volcanoes are listed. 
20Î Keep the box checked to Convert unplaced labels to unplaced annotation. These 
labels will be put in an overflow window for individual placement later. 
20Î Click Convert to create the annotation. 
View the new annotation. It looks the same, but the labels are now graphic text and are 
individually adjustable.  
TIP: If you made a mistake and want to remove the annotation from the map, open the properties 
for the data frame and click the Annotation Groups tab. Highlight the Volcanoes Anno group and 
click Remove. 
If you had unplaced labels, they were put in an overflow 
window (Fig. 5.24). Your list may be different from the one 
in the figure. We can place these labels manually. If you 
had no unplaced labels, go on to Step 22. 
21Î In the Overflow window, right-click one entry 
and choose Flash Feature. Repeat, if necessary, 
until you see it flash. (You may need to move 
the Overflow window aside.) 
21Î We don’t want the eruption labels for the 
smaller triangles. For each piece of annotation 
that is a number less than 5, right-click it in the 
Overflow Annotation window and choose Delete. 
21Î Right-click each remaining entry and choose 
Add Annotation. The text is added to the map. 
The placement may not be perfect, but we will 
adjust it in a moment. 
21Î Close the Overflow Annotation window when 
it is empty. 
To adjust the annotation, we need to be in Data View. For 
these fine adjustments, it will be helpful to turn the snapping grid off. 
22Î Open Customize > ArcMap Options on the main menu bar, click the Layout View 
tab, and uncheck the Grid box in the Snap elements to section. Click OK. 
22Î Click the Data View button. If you get the USA frame, right-click the Hazards 
frame name and choose Activate. 
2. When you returned to Data view, the labels got larger. What does this tell you about 
annotation? __________________________________________________________ 
22Î Click the Select Elements tool, if necessary. Click on the name label for Baker to 
select it. Adjust the position of the label so that it is clearly visible. 
22Î Click on the 13 inside the Baker symbol to select it. Use the mouse or the arrow 
keys to move it to the center of the triangle.

23Î Carefully select and delete any annotation in the smaller triangles with fewer than  
5 eruptions. (You can hold the Shift key to select more than one at a time.) 
23Î Delete the 0 labels for the inactive volcanoes. You can draw a box around them to 
select them in groups—just be careful not to include any other annotation. 
23Î Center the remaining labels inside their triangles. 
Since we are using annotation, we should set the reference scale of the data frame to scale the 
symbols also when we zoom in or out. 
24Î Click the Layout button to return to Layout view. 
24Î Use the Zoom/Pan tools on the Tools toolbar to resize and center the two states 
within the data frame, if necessary. 
24Î Right-click the Hazards data frame name and choose Reference Scale > Set 
Reference Scale. 
24Î Zoom in to Mt. St. Helens and watch the symbols and labels enlarge. 
24Î Return to the previous extent using the button on the Tools toolbar. 
TIP: To set an exact reference scale, such as 1:24,000, right-click the data frame name, choose 
Properties, click the General tab, and type a specific reference scale in the appropriate box.  
The complex interstate symbols are too prominent in the visual hierarchy, and we don’t need four 
different road classes for this map. We can create a simpler classification. 
25Î Open the Symbology tab for the Highways layer. 
25Î Hold the Shift key and click on the symbols for Interstate and Freeway, so that both 
are highlighted.  
25Î Above the highlighted rows, click on the Value heading and choose Group Values. 
25Î Repeat the previous step to group the Arterial and Unclassified classes together. 
25Î Click on the text under the Label 
heading and change them to simply 
Interstates and Highways. 
25Î Double-click the Interstates symbol 
and set it to a 3.4 pt. simple brown line. 
Set the Highways symbol to 1.5 pt. line 
of the same color. Click OK to accept 
the changes. The final result should 
appear as in Figure 5.25. 
The county lines are too similar to the highways, causing confusion. We can reduce the contrast 
to bring the highways forward and relegate the county lines to the background. 
26Î Open the Symbology properties for the Counties layer. 
26Î Click on the Symbol heading above the shades and choose Properties for All 
Symbols. Change the Outline color to Gray 10%. Click OK and OK.

Adding a legend to the map 
Now that the map is in good shape, it is time to continue creating the layout. 
27Î Choose the Select Elements tool.  
27Î Right-click the Hazards frame name and choose Activate. The legend is always 
based on layers in the active frame. 
27Î Choose Insert > Legend from the main menu bar. A Legend Wizard will appear. 
 
28Î Examine the list of layers and make sure you want them all. Volcano Labels has 
only labels, so select it on the right and click the < button to remove it from the list. 
28Î Now establish the order of layers. To move a layer, click on it to select it and click 
the Up or Down arrow until it is in the right location. Put Volcanoes first, Counties 
next, then Highways, then Capitals, then Rivers, then States. Click Next. 
 
29Î Delete the Legend title. Click Next. 
29Î Choose the 1.0 Point border for the 
Legend. Make sure that the Gap is set to  
10 pt. Click Next.  
29Î To choose a different style patch, click 
the Rivers layer and choose the Flowing 
Water line. Click Next. 
29Î This section gives very detailed control 
of the spacing between different elements 
of the legend. It is fine to leave the defaults 
on this step. Click Finish. 
29Î The legend appears in the middle of the 
map. Click and drag it next to the map 
frame and even with its top (Fig. 5.26). 
TIP: Use Customize > ArcMap Options to turn the snap grid back on to align the boxes. 
If you made a mistake creating the legend, don’t worry. You can change its properties. Note that 
the legend is longer than the space available. We can make changes to help it fit better. The 
Volcanoes layer has two headings, Volcanoes and KNOWN_ERUP. We only need one.  
30Î Right-click the Legend and choose Properties. Click the 
Items tab. 
30Î Click on Volcanoes and click the Style button 
underneath. 
30Î Choose the item style shown in Figure 5.27, called 
Horizontal Single Symbol Layer Name and Label. 
30Î Click OK and OK and examine the change in the legend. 
30Î Rename the Volcanoes layer Known Eruptions in the 
Table of Contents. Notice that the name changes in the 
legend as well. 
Fig. 5.26. Adding the legend

167 
31Î Open the Legend properties again and click the Items tab. 
31ÎClick on the Highways entry and change its item style to the same one used for the 
Volcanoes. Click OK and OK. 
SKILL TIP: Learn more about different legend styles and how to manage them (Layouts and 
Data Frames). 
32Î Click twice slowly on the POP10_SQMI heading under the Counties layer in the 
Table of Contents and change it to People/sq. mile. 
32Î Click twice on the Capitals layer name in the Table of Contents and change the 
name to State Capitals. 
We have shortened the legend, but it still does not fit. Let’s use two columns instead of one. 
33Î Double-click on the Legend to open its Properties and click the Items tab. 
33Î Move the Properties box away to be able to view the Legend. 
33Î Select the Highways and check the box to 
Place item(s) in new column. Click Apply. 
That looks as if it will work, but we want to align the edges 
of the legend with the location map.  
34Î Click the Size and Position tab in the Legend 
Properties window. 
34Î Leave the height alone but set the width to 
3.275 inches. Click OK.  
34Î Use the snap grid to move the legend into its 
final place, 0.25 inch above the location map 
and right of the Hazards frame (Fig. 5.28).  
Notice that the snap grid is helping us make the negative space equal between the elements and to 
ensure that the edges are perfectly aligned. 
Placing a scale bar on the map 
Hazards are impacted by distance from the volcanoes, so a scale bar is appropriate on this map. 
The scale bar is placed in the active frame. 
3. To review the scale bar terms, write the correct 
terms in the boxes of Figure 5.29. 
35Î Make sure the Hazards frame is active. 
35Î Choose Insert > Scale Bar from the 
main menu. 
35Î Choose the Alternating Scale Bar 1 
style bar and click OK. 
 
36Î Move the scale bar to the lower right corner of the Hazards frame, on top of Oregon. 
Fig. 5.28. Final position of the 
legend

Chapter 5 
168 
36Î Use the Zoom In tool on the Layout toolbar to zoom in to the scale bar to examine 
it more closely. 
The bar may be too long or too short, and it may have uneven divisions, such as 110 miles. If it 
appears unsuitable, try resizing the scale bar to improve it. 
37Î Click the Select Elements tool.  
37Î Click the right boundary of the scale bar (a double horizontal arrow will appear), 
and drag it to the left to decrease the length of the scale bar.  
37Î Repeat until the scale bar is about 120 miles long. 
You may have ended up with uneven labels instead of nice, round numbers. We can modify the 
scale bar to get exactly the properties we want.  
38Î Double-click the scale bar to open its properties, and click the Scale and Units tab. 
Notice that the division value is dimmed out. In order to set it explicitly, we must change the way 
ArcMap adjusts the bar when resizing. 
38Î Under When Resizing, set the drop-down box to Adjust number of divisions. 
38Î Set the Division value to 50 miles and set the Number of subdivisions to 2.  
38Î Click the Frame tab and set the Background color to Sand to separate the bar from 
the roads behind it. Click OK. 
38Î Examine the new scale bar. Resize it to 100 miles long and place it neatly in the 
lower right corner of the state. 
Adding other map elements 
Many other elements can be added to the map using the Insert menu. Keep in mind that the 
elements will refer to the data frame that is currently active.  
Adding a north arrow 
39Î Click the Zoom Whole Page button on the Layout toolbar. 
39Î Choose Insert > North Arrow from the main menu bar. 
39Î Click a slender, unobtrusive symbol like ESRI North 60. 
39Î Click the Properties button and examine the settings. Click OK and OK. 
39Î Click the Select Elements tool and move the north arrow to the lower-right corner 
of the Hazards frame. Keep it small and unobtrusive. 
TIP: Some large-scale projections, like UTM, can have a slight direction distortion at the edges 
of the zone; although only a degree or two, it is still noticeable. ArcMap does not tilt the arrow 
automatically. Use the Properties tab to set the north arrow to the correct angle or, even better, 
use the data frame properties to rotate the map so that north is vertical. 
The United States location map might look good with a graticules grid on it. 
40Î Right-click the USA data frame name in the Table of Contents and choose 
Properties. Click on the Grids tab. 
40Î Click New Grid. Choose the Graticule grid. Click Next. 

Presenting GIS Data 
169 
40Î Choose Graticule and labels. Accept the default intervals. Click Next. 
40Î Accept the defaults on the axes and labels. Click Next. 
40Î Accept the defaults on the graticules. Click Finish and OK. 
The grid appears, but the labels extend into the other map frame. A design decision is in order. 
You can reduce the size of the USA data frame so that the labels fit, or you can remove the grid. 
Since this frame merely contains a location map, having a scale or north direction or grid is not 
important, so we will remove it.  
41Î Open the USA data frame properties and uncheck the Graticule box. Click OK. 
Adding titles and text 
Titles and text provide important information about the map including data citations. 
42Î Choose Insert > Title from the main menu bar. A centered text field appears with a 
default title. 
42Î Double-click the text to open its properties. 
42Î In the text box, type Pacific Northwest, press Enter, and type Volcanic 
Hazards on the next line. Click OK. 
42Î Use the Drawing toolbar to set the font size to 18 pt. and make it bold. Center it 
above the legend, aligning it with the top of the Hazards data frame. 
 
43Î Choose the Insert > Text choice in the main menu bar. Find the tiny new text box 
on the map, waiting for you to type the text.  
43Î Type by Your Name and press Enter. 
43Î Move the text to a centered position below the Title.  
TIP: Did you notice the Dynamic text option under the Insert > Text menu choice? You can add 
times, dates, and other types of updatable text to the map. 
44Î To add wrapped text, click the label drop-down on the Draw toolbar to find and 
select the Rectangle Text tool. 
44Î Click and drag to create a box inside the blank area in the legend. 
44Î Double-click inside the new text box to open its properties. 
44Î Click the Text tab and type the following citation into the box without using any 
Enter keys: ESRI Data and Maps [Download]. (2013) Redlands, CA: ESRI 
[October, 2014].  
44Î Make the text left-justified. 
44Î Click the Frame tab and set the border to <None>. Click OK. 
44Î Set the font size to 8 pt. Adjust the text box to fit neatly in the legend space. The 
legend should look similar to Figure 5.30. 
Adding neatlines 
45Î Choose Insert > Neatline from the main menu bar.  
45Î Fill the button to Place around all elements. 

Chapter 5 
170 
45Î Set the gap to 10 pt. (the gap controls the 
distance between the elements and the 
neatline). 
45Î Choose the Triple Graded border from the 
drop-down box. 
45Î Set the Background to White. A gradient 
border looks nice on the computer screen, but 
wastes ink and doesn’t always print well. 
Click OK. 
SKILL TIP: Learn how to add pictures or graphics to a 
layout (Layouts and Data Frames). 
At this point, a test print can be made to make sure the 
colors and symbols work as well on paper as they do on 
screen. The map should appear similar to Figure 5.31. 
46Î Save the map. It is wise to SAVE the map document before you print. 
46Î Choose File > Print from the main menu bar. 
46Î Make sure that the sample map and printer page settings fit each other. 
46Î Click Setup to change the printer or adjust the print settings, if needed.  
46Î When ready to print, click OK.  
TIP: Examine the margins of the print. Some printers shift the map off-center, and you must 
adjust by moving the map elements to center them for that printer. 
Reviewing and editing the layout 
Now for the final review. Go take a break, then return and look at the map at full scale, both on 
paper and on screen. You might notice the following issues (Fig. 5.31). 
¾ The visual hierarchy established by 
the symbols is unclear. All of the 
map layers shout equally for 
attention. The volcanoes are the 
purpose, but they don’t stand out. 
The highways and rivers are 
difficult to tell apart. The Pacific 
Ocean label is distracting. 
¾ The title looks odd by itself when 
the other elements all have neatlines, 
but adding a neatline around it 
would probably be too much. 
Even the current ones create a 
cluttered feel.

As you reevaluate the design, return to the map objective: to draw attention to the fact that 
population centers in Washington and Oregon lie close to historically active volcanoes. Perhaps 
the roads and rivers are not as important as we originally decided. We can edit the map to clarify 
this message and make it more attractive as well, which will be your task in the first exercise. 
Exporting a layout 
Maps can be saved as image files for inclusion in reports or presentations. The PDF format is a 
popular way to distribute maps to others, or to bring the map to a commercial printing center with 
better equipment. 
47Î Choose File > Export Map. 
47Î Choose the location and name for the image file. 
47Î Set the Save As type to PDF. 
47Î Click on the Options drop-down flag, if necessary, to show the Options settings. 
47Î Check the resolution. The minimum resolution for printing should be 300 dpi. It 
could be lower for a web or screen image. 
47Î Click Save to save the map.  
TIP: If planning to place the map in another document, check the box to Clip Output to Graphics 
Extent and save as a JPEG or GIF. Check the resolution; the default of 96 dpi is not good enough 
and should be increased to 300 dpi or more. 
SKILL TIP: Learn to use a map template to produce a quick layout of a map, or learn to create a

Exercises  
1. Save the tutorial map under a new name, and then edit it to produce the version shown below, 
including removing the highways and rivers, and also increasing the sizes of the symbols and 
labels. After you finish, add the World Terrain basemap from ArcGIS Online to the main map 
frame to provide context (but turn off its reference layer of features and names). Make the 
counties about 30% transparent so that the base map shows through slightly. Save the map as 
a PDF to turn in. 
Note: the data frame is using a Clip to Shape option to suppress the 
highways and rivers outside the states, and you must turn it off to see the 
basemap. Use the Frame tab in the data frame properties to set it back to 
No Clipping. 
 
2. Save the tutorial map under a new name, then redesign it using a portrait orientation and 
without the location map. (For better performance, remove the basemap until you are finished 
editing.) 
Challenge Problem: Home Sweet Home 
Design and create an attractive map layout showing some of the data you compiled for your home

GIS Concepts  
Overview of tables 
A table is a data structure for storing multiple attributes about a location or an object. It is 
composed of rows, called records, and columns, called fields or attribute fields. Figure 6.1 
shows an example of a table containing attributes of counties. 
 
In ArcGIS, tabular data files fall into two main categories: attribute tables and standalone 
tables. An attribute table, such as the one shown in Figure 6.1, contains information about 
features in a geographic data set. In an attribute table, there is always one and only one row of 
information for each feature. In a shapefile, the row is linked to the spatial feature in a separate 
Fig. 6.1. A table with information about US counties

Chapter 6 
174 
file using a unique ID number called a Feature ID, or FID. In a geodatabase, the file stores both 
the attributes and the x-y coordinates in the same data file, although the coordinates are not visible 
in the table, and it uses an Object ID, or OID, instead of an FID (Fig. 6.1). In contrast, a 
standalone table simply contains information about one or more objects in tabular format instead 
of having information about map features. A standalone table might come from a text file, an 
Excel  spreadsheet, a global positioning system data file, or a database. Standalone tables exist 
independently of a geographic data set and may be only incidentally related to map features. They 
also have an OID rather than an FID. 
Database management systems 
GIS tables share a history and many current properties of the database programs that are routinely 
used in many commercial, governmental, and academic settings. Most vector-based GIS 
programs use an underlying database to store data, such as the ancient INFO database used for 
coverages, the dBase table structure used for shapefiles, the Microsoft Access engine used for 
personal geodatabases, or a large-scale relational database management system (RDBMS), such 
as SQL Server, used for enterprise geodatabases. These programs are designed to store, 
manipulate, analyze, and protect tabular data of all kinds. Governments use them to store 
information about citizens, parcels, taxes, and more. Companies use them to store information 
about customers. Universities use them to manage information about students, classes, and 
faculty. Three types of databases have traditionally been used. 
A flat file database stores rows of information in a text or binary file. Finding information 
requires parsing the table and selecting the records of interest. They are simple but not efficient.  
A hierarchical database has multiple files, each of which contains different records and fields. 
Parent tables can be linked to child tables through a specified field called a key. For example, a 
table of college classes might be linked to a table of students in each of the classes through a 
course ID number. Relationships between tables are fixed, which makes looking up information 
quick. However, the relationships are inflexible, designed to permit only a small set of operations. 
A relational database also has multiple tables stored as files. However, the relationships are not 
defined ahead of time. Instead, the user can temporarily associate two tables if they share a 
common field. This association is called a join, and the common field becomes the key. This 
database model is extremely flexible and is the preferred choice for GIS systems. 
Because GIS data are intimately linked to an underlying database structure, it is not a far stretch 
to incorporate tables from database programs into GIS analysis. ArcGIS has capabilities for 
connecting to and working with RDBMS data files directly, expanding the type of data available.  
If a county keeps its parcel tax records in an RDBMS such as Oracle or SQL Server, for example, 
a GIS analyst can bring the database tables into ArcMap as standalone tables. 
Queries on tables 
Often one wants information about a subset of records in a table, for example, knowing the 
number of parcels in the city that are designated as commercial. To determine this information, a 
query can be performed on the table. In a query, a logical expression is used to specify certain 
criteria (e.g., zoning = commercial), and then the software searches the table and finds the records 
(parcels) that match the criteria. Those records are returned as a selected set. Selected records can 
become the input to another action, such as printing them, exporting them to a new file (as we 
have already done), or executing a GIS function on them.  

Attribute Data 
175 
Most databases use a special language called Structured Query Language (SQL) to write and 
execute queries. A land use table might contain a field with the zoning code. If the field 
containing the zoning is named ZONE, and the code for commercial property is 492, the logical 
expression in SQL might look like this: 
 
SELECT * FROM landuse WHERE ZONE = 492 
In this example, landuse is the name of the table, ZONE is the field name, and ZONE = 492 is the 
logical expression stating the criteria to be met. SQL queries can have multiple lines and include 
many criteria.  
SELECT * FROM landuse WHERE  
ZONE = 492 AND VALUE > 300000 
This query would find all commercial parcels with a value greater than $300,000. This chapter 
presents methods for performing queries on tables. Chapter 8 examines queries in more detail. 
Joining and relating tables 
In an RDBMS and in a GIS, tables are commonly combined using a join, in order to bring 
different sets of information together. The tables are combined using a common field called a 
key. The key field must be of the same data type in both tables. When a join is performed, the 
two separate tables become one and contain the information from both tables (Fig. 6.2). The join 
is a temporary relationship and may be removed when it is no longer needed. 
 
Joins have a direction. The table containing the information to be appended is called the source 
table. The table that receives the appended information is called the destination table. In  
Figure 6.2, the destination table, US States, is a feature attribute table. The source table 
containing demographic data is a standalone table. When the two tables are joined, the 
Fig. 6.2. Joining on a common field. These two tables are joined into one using the common 
field STATE FIPS. The data from the source table are placed into the destination table. 
Join tables on

Chapter 6 
176 
demographic data are appended to the US States attribute table. Often joins are used to bring data 
from standalone tables into an attribute table for mapping or analysis.  
Join direction matters. Once the demographics are joined to the table of the states shapefile, then 
the information could be used to make a map of the population data. If, however, the join had 
been performed in the opposite direction, with the demographics as the destination and the states 
as the source, then the resulting table would be a standalone table. In this case, a map showing the 
demographics could not be made because the demographics table is not a feature class.  
Multiple joins can combine three or more tables. In ArcGIS, the destination table can have 
multiple source tables joined to it; each join is initiated with the same destination table but a 
different source. Source fields in the first join can be used as key fields in the next join. However, 
a table cannot simultaneously be a source for one join and a destination for another.  
Suppose that you wish to compare the average teacher salary in counties to the state average 
(Fig. 6.3) for all counties in the United States. You have a table of county salaries and one of state 
salaries, but one has a state name field and the other has a state abbreviation field. You can’t join 
them directly. However, the states table has both a name and abbreviation field, so you do a 
multiple join. The counties table is the destination both times. First you join the states to the 
counties table using the StateName field as the key; then you can join the teacher salary table to 
the counties using the StateAbbr field. 
 
Cardinality 
When joining, the cardinality of the relationship between the tables must be considered. 
Cardinality is the numeric relationship between the objects in one table and their matches in the 
other. The simplest kind of relationship is one-to-one, in which each record in the destination 
table matches one record in the source table. In Figure 6.2, each state has one corresponding 
record of demographic data. In a one-to-many relationship, each record in the destination table 
could match more than one record in the source table. For example, a store location could have 
many employees. In a many-to-one relationship, many records in the destination table would 
match a single record in the source table, such as many cities falling within one state. Finally, a 
many-to-many relationship indicates that multiple records can appear in both tables. For example, 
a student may take more than one class, and most classes have more than one student. 
The direction of the join must be taken into account when ascertaining the cardinality of a 
relationship. The destination table is the point of reference and comes first; that is, the 
relationship cardinality is reported as {destination} to {source}. Imagine two tables containing 
states and counties. If one performs a join with states as the destination table and counties as the

177 
source, the cardinality is one-to-many because each state contains many counties (and a county 
may belong to only one state). If the join is reversed and counties is the destination table, then the 
cardinality becomes many-to-one because there are many counties in one state. 
TIP: Putting the destination table first when stating cardinality is not a universal convention and 
may be found reversed in other data management applications. It is used here to match the 
convention adopted by ESRI in its publications and Help documents. It may help to always 
imagine the destination table on the left, as in Figure 6.4. 
 
The cardinality of a relationship dictates whether the tables can be joined. The Rule of Joining 
stipulates that there must be one and only one record in the source table for each record in the 
destination table. Consider the four tables shown in Figure 6.4. 
One-to-one cardinality. In Figure 6.4a, a table containing the number of earthquakes and total 
damage in each state (source) is being joined to a states attribute table (destination), using the 
common field provided by the state abbreviation. Each state occurs once in each table so that 
there is no ambiguity about matching the source records to the destination records. 
Many-to-one cardinality. In Figure 6.4b, a table containing state information (source) is being 
joined to a table of counties (destination) using the common field provided by the state name. 
Although there are many counties in each state, there is only one record for each state in the 
source table and no ambiguity in linking the source records to the destination records. The state 
record does get used more than once, but it still does not violate the Rule of Joining. 
One-to-many cardinality. Figure 6.5 shows the reverse of the join in Figure 6.4b. Now states are 
the destination table and counties are the source table. Many county records in the source table 
match each state record in the destination table. The Rule of Joining is violated, and it becomes 
ambiguous which county record should be matched to the state. One cannot perform a join if a 
one-to-many relationship is present. Instead, we perform a different operation called a relate.

In a relate, the two tables are still associated by a common field, but the records are not joined 
together. The two tables remain separate. However, if one or more records are selected in one 
table, then the associated records can be selected in the other table. For example, selecting the 
state of Washington in the states table allows the selection of all the counties in Washington in 
the related table, as shown by the red boxes in Figure 6.5. Many relationships in the world have 
cardinalities of one-to-many, such as a school to its classes or a well to its yearly water quality 
tests, and relates provide valuable support in dealing with those features and their attributes. 
Many-to-many cardinality. Many-to-many relationships 
exist but are difficult to deal with in a relational database. 
Consider a university. Each class has many students in it. 
However, most students are taking more than one class 
(Fig. 6.6). In practice, one would have to use multiple 
relates to represent the relationships and work with them 
one at a time. A one-to-many relate could be set up from 
the classes table to the students to allow all the students 
in each class to be found. Another one-to-many relate 
would allow the list of classes for each student to be 
generated.  
Sometimes a join is performed in 
which most records have matches, but 
some do not. Occasionally, a user 
makes a fundamental error in crafting 
the join, and none of the records have 
matches. In these cases, the join will 
still be performed, but the records 
without matches will be given zero or 
<Null> values in the attribute fields 
from the source table. In Figure 6.7, an 
earthquakes table (highlighted) was 
joined to a states table (white) based 
on the state abbreviation and a many-
to-one cardinality. Earthquakes in Puerto Rico had no match in the states table, and the source 
fields are given <Null> values in the joined table. It is always a good idea to view the table after a 
join and confirm that it went as intended. If missing values are encountered, a plan can be made 
?

record in the source table matches a record in the destination table.

to handle them. In this case, one might choose to exclude the earthquakes outside the 50 states 
from further consideration or to find a different states feature class that includes territories. 
Statistics on tables 
Statistics 
Exploring data through statistics is a fundamental first step in data analysis, because it is 
important to understand the structure and properties of the data before applying more advanced 
techniques. A standard approach begins with calculating statistical measures such as the 
minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation, and viewing a histogram to evaluate 
whether it is potentially a normal distribution. Careful interpretation of this information can yield 
some important insights, especially when measured against one’s expert knowledge. 
Consider Figure 6.8, showing basic statistics 
and a frequency diagram (histogram) of 
earthquake magnitudes for a feature class of 
historical earthquakes in the United States. 
A geologist would recognize two odd things 
about this data. First, over 300 earthquakes 
have a magnitude of 0, which makes no 
sense physically and must indicate missing 
data values. The missing values affect the 
current statistics, which must be 
recalculated without the missing values. The 
second oddity is more subtle. Without the 
zero values, the histogram resembles a 
slightly skewed bell curve. However, a 
geologist knows that earthquakes follow an 
inverse power law, with many more small 
earthquakes than large ones. The creator of 
this feature class evidently included only 
certain small earthquakes. This data set 
would not be suitable to analyze magnitude 
statistics for earthquakes in general. 
This example illustrates the important step of exploring data and thinking about it critically 
before blindly calculating and accepting a result. Not only does the practice help prevent serious 
mistakes in inferring things about data sets, it can raise interesting questions. Why are there so 
many missing data values? Why are any magnitude 2–3 earthquakes included in this data set at 
all, since they typically do little damage and are rarely even felt?  
A data set that passes the initial exploration can become the subject of more sophisticated 
statistical tests that are often provided with some GIS programs; one can also export the table for 
analysis in standard statistical software packages. GIS professionals can only improve their 
expertise by becoming more knowledgeable about statistics in all its forms. 
Summarizing tables 
The Summarize function is a powerful form of statistics applied to tables. Summarize combines 
the records into groups based on a categorical attribute field and then calculates statistics 
separately for each group. For example, one might group a table of earthquakes according to 
which state the earthquake is in, and generate earthquake statistics for each state separately.

Figure 6.9 contains a table 
showing major historical 
earthquakes in the United States. 
Attributes for each quake include 
the state in which it occurred, the 
number of deaths it caused, the 
total damage caused, and the 
Richter scale intensity (MAG). 
We would like to know which 
states have suffered the most from 
historical earthquakes. In 
particular, we want to know the 
total deaths, total damage, and maximum magnitude for each state. We summarize based on the 
state field, dividing the earthquakes into groups by state, and specify which statistics to calculate. 
Separate statistics are calculated for each group (state).  
Because many statistics can be 
returned from a Summarize, this 
command produces a new table. The 
quakesum.dbf output table, shown in 
Figure 6.10, has one record for each 
state. It also has a Count field 
indicating the number of earthquakes 
in each state and one field for each 
of the statistics we requested. To 
better interpret the data, we sorted 
the table by the damage field in 
descending order to find the most 
grievously affected states.  
Our next step might be to join the quakesum.dbf table 
to the US States layer and create a map showing the 
total damage or total deaths for each state (Fig. 6.11). 
Using Summarize, we collapsed a one-to-many 
relationship between states and earthquakes into a 
one-to-one relationship between states and earthquake 
statistics, allowing the data to be mapped. 
Field types 
Creating database tables always begins with an 
analysis of the fields that the table will contain. Unlike 
a spreadsheet, in which any cell can contain any type of data, a database field (column) must 
contain only one type of data, perhaps text, perhaps integers, but never both. Each field must be 
defined, and the type of its contents must be specified, before any data are entered. Furthermore, 
once a field definition is set, it cannot be changed. The most common field types are numbers, 
strings, dates, and Boolean fields. Each field may also have parameters that further specify what it 
may contain, such as the maximum number of characters allowed in a text field. 
A field STREETNAME would be a text field because street names contain letters. The field 
length defines how many characters can be stored in the name. If the STREETNAME field is

summary field (STATE), the number of earthquakes in 
each state, and the requested statistics.

given a length of 10, then any name longer than 10 characters will be truncated to the first 
10 letters. Thus, “Elm Street” fits perfectly (including the space), but “Maple Street” would be 
truncated to “Maple Stre” to fit in the field. It is important to ensure enough space in fields to 
hold the longest likely value. When designing a database, try to use the smallest field widths that 
will store every possible value because extra spaces increase the size of the database. 
Numeric fields have different parameters. When defining a numeric field, the user may designate 
a storage width (precision) and the number of decimal places (scale). For example, a field with a 
precision of 5 and a scale of 0 could store a number between –9999 and 99999 (the minus sign 
takes one space). A field with a precision of 5 and a scale of 2 could store a number between  
–9.99 and 99.99 (the decimal place also takes one space).  
Numbers can be stored in a variety of ways. Most databases offer several formats for storing 
numeric values, and these formats can differ from database to database. The next section 
describes the common options in general terms. 
ASCII versus binary 
A byte is the basic unit of storage space for a computer—it is composed of a string of eight digits 
(bits), which may be zeros or ones. These zeros and ones represent a number in base 2; such 
numbers are called binary numbers. A single byte can store a binary value from 0 (00000000) to 
255 (11111111). Two bytes can store values up to 216 – 1, or 65,535. The more bytes allotted to a 
value, the larger the number that can be stored. One million bytes constitute a megabyte (MB), 
and one billion bytes equal a gigabyte (GB), terms that probably sound familiar as measurements 
of data storage capacity. 
All text is stored as sequences of characters using a special code called ASCII in which every 
number, every letter, and every symbol (such as $) is assigned a single-byte code between 0 and 
255. To store the word cat, the computer stores the code for c, the code for a, and the code for t. 
Thus, it takes three bytes to store cat. The word horse requires five bytes. Numbers may also be 
stored using ASCII by storing the ASCII one-byte code for each numeral. Thus, it requires three 
bytes of data to store 147 and five bytes to store 147.6. This scheme is a simple and standard way 
to store information. Text files and HTML files, among others, are stored in ASCII. 
Unlike text, numbers have another storage option called binary. In this case, a number is stored 
in base 2 directly rather than being assigned one byte per character. The number 16 would be 
stored in binary as 00010000 in a single byte of information. Binary is a more efficient way to 
store numbers than ASCII. The number 14456 would require five bytes in ASCII but only  
two bytes in binary. It is also faster to compute with binary values because the computer by 
design does all its calculations in base 2. If the number is already stored in base 2, the computer 
does not need to convert it before calculating. Thus, it is often advantageous to use binary 
storage. Many types of files use a binary encoding scheme, including spreadsheets, word 
processing documents, and shapefiles. Raster and image data are also stored as binary data. 
Precision 
Very large numbers, such as 1,000,000,000,000, require many bytes to store, as do very small 
numbers, such as 0.0000000000001. People often use scientific notation when dealing with very 
large or very small numbers; these two would be written as 1.0 × 1012 and 1.0 × 10–13. Computers 
can also use scientific notation, usually called exponential or floating-point data. This notation 
stores values composed of a mantissa (the decimal part of the number) and an exponent. For 
example, the number 123456789 stored as an exponential number would consist of a mantissa of 

Chapter 6 
182 
1.23456789 and an exponent of 8, yielding 1.23456789 × 108 (often written as 1.23456780e08). 
The computer truncates the mantissa at a certain level of precision—when storing values in the 
trillions, differences of tens or hundreds are often of little interest. The number might become 
1.2345e08. In ArcGIS, a single-precision floating-point field stores eight significant digits of 
information in the mantissa. A double-precision field stores 16 significant digits. Floating-point 
data types are much more flexible than numeric or binary types because they can store either very 
large or very small values using the same field.  
Different types for different data formats 
Every attribute must be defined before use; that is, the field type must be specified (text or 
numeric) and the field properties set. Once a field is defined, the definition cannot be changed. If 
a mistake is made defining the field, one must delete the field and redefine it. Different GIS 
systems may have different allowable data types, although most use the basic categories of text, 
integers, and floating-point values. Table 6.1 shows the specific data types used in ArcGIS. 
Geodatabases also have a Raster and GUID type for advanced users.

About ArcGIS 
Tables in ArcGIS 
Tables in ArcGIS may come from any of the underlying database programs supported by ArcGIS. 
The tables may be in different formats for storage, but the table itself always looks the same and 
has the same functions so that users don’t need to learn different commands for working with 
different file types. 
Tables are viewed and manipulated in the Table window in ArcMap (Fig. 6.12). This window 
contains a Table Options menu and several tools at the top. More commands are accessible from 
a context menu that appears if a field is right-clicked. If more than one table is opened, they all 
appear in the Table window. Tabs at the bottom of the window are used to switch between tables. 
Tables may also be viewed side by side or vertically using a menu under the Table Options. 

Attribute Data 
183 
 
In a shapefile, the table is stored in a dBase format file and includes a unique feature identification 
number (FID) that links the spatial and the attribute data. In a geodatabase and in any standalone 
table, each record contains an Object ID (OID) analogous to the row number in a spreadsheet. Both 
shapefiles and geodatabase feature classes contain a Shape field that represents the x-y coordinate 
values of the feature. Geodatabase tables for line and polygon feature classes also have Shape_Area 
and/or Shape_Length fields, which keep track of the areas and lengths of features. 
Figure 6.12 shows some terminology associated with tables. A table consists of rows and 
columns. A row is called a record, and it contains information about a single object or feature. A 
column is called a field, and it stores one type of information. Each field has a name shown in the 
top row. Field names must contain 13 or fewer characters and should contain only letters, 
numbers, and underscores. An alternative name, called an alias, can be set in the layer properties 
to give a field a more descriptive name that does not have to follow the naming rules. For 
example, the somewhat perplexing field MEDREN could be given a more understandable alias, 
such as MedianRent. Aliases form part of a layer definition. If defined in ArcMap, they persist 
only inside that map document. If defined as part of a layer file, they can be used in different map 
documents by loading the layer file instead of the feature class. 
In an attribute table, some fields are required, and they are created and updated by the program 
that creates the geographic data set. For example, a shapefile has a Feature ID (FID) field and a 
Shape field. The geodatabase feature class has an Object ID and a Shape field. These fields 
should never be altered by the user. Likewise, users of shapefiles must make sure that they never 
delete records in an attribute table unless the accompanying features in the spatial data set are also 
deleted. Editing features only within an editing session in ArcMap will meet this criterion, as 
does deleting rows in a geodatabase feature class.  
As we learned in Chapter 1, different GIS data formats use different underlying databases. The 
coverage model uses a database called INFO. Shapefiles use a dBase format file. Personal 
geodatabases use the database underlying Microsoft Access, called Jet. File geodatabases use their 
own format. SDE geodatabases use a large-scale commercial RDBMS, such as Oracle or SQL 
Server. ArcGIS can read comma-delimited text files (fields separated by commas) and tab-delimited 
text files (fields separated by tabs), as well as Excel™ spreadsheets if they are correctly formatted.

Editing and calculating fields 
ArcGIS offers two ways to change the values in a table, by typing the information directly into 
the fields or by calculating the value of a field. Typing information into fields must be done 
during an edit session in ArcMap. Calculating fields can be done inside or outside an edit session 
and uses the Field Calculator to generate arithmetic expressions using fields as variables. For 
example, the percentage of Hispanics in each state could be calculated from the two fields 
containing the total state population and the number of Hispanics.  
Calculating within an edit session is 
safest, because a mistake can be undone. 
However, it can be inconvenient to start 
and stop an edit session each time you 
want to run a calculation. If you choose to 
calculate outside an edit session, you must 
be VERY careful to ensure that the field 
you are calculating either is empty or 
contains data that are easy to replace (by a 
different calculation, for example). 
TIP: Calculating destroys the original 
data in the field, so usually calculations 
are performed in an empty field added to 
the table. Be very sure of what you are 
doing before performing a calculation on a 
field that already contains data. 
The first window in the Field Calculator 
(Fig. 6.13) contains the fields in the table 
that can be used to create the expression. 
The functions box contains different 
functions that can be used in expressions. 
The functions displayed will depend on 
whether Number, String, or Date is selected. 
The expression used to calculate is entered 
in the large box at the bottom. The operators 
(*, /, &, +, –, =) appear to the lower right. 
The Advanced button allows more complex 
VB Script or Python expressions to be 
entered. A complicated expression can be 
saved and loaded for use another time.  
The Calculate Geometry tool (Fig. 6.14) can 
add information on feature areas, perimeters, 
lengths, or x-y centroids to a table. The field 
to contain the information must already 
exist. The user may choose which 
coordinate system and output units to use in 
the calculation.

Importing tables 
Many GIS projects encounter situations 
when external tabular data must be 
imported for use in ArcGIS. Several 
different formats may be used, but one 
must always take care that the layout of the 
records and fields follows the requirements 
of ArcGIS tables. Field names, for 
example, must be present in the first row 
and must follow the ArcGIS naming 
conventions. Columns that are supposed to 
hold numbers must hold only numbers and 
avoid NoData or xx or Null or N/A to 
indicate missing values. Blank rows, 
merged cells, and formulas are not 
allowed. Most import formats are read-
only within ArcGIS. They can be viewed, 
but not edited or changed, and some tools 
and functions may not work on them. 
Usually, the import file is exported to a dbf 
file or geodatabase table if changes to it 
are needed.  
SKILL TIP: Learn about the formatting 
requirements for importing Excel, text, and 
other data types to ArcGIS (Tables). 
Dbf files, or dBASE files, are commonly 
produced by database programs. These 
files can be directly imported to ArcGIS 
and even modified and returned to the 
database program. This is the only import 
format that can be edited within ArcGIS. 
Text files, such as those shown in Figure 6.15, come from a variety of sources. They might come 
from text copied from a web site, data copied from a word processing document, or values 
produced from a statistical program. Nearly any program that handles tabular data has the option to 
save them as text, and it is one of the most basic and standard formats for transferring data 
between programs. All text files are stored using ASCII characters. Three primary formats are 
found. Figure 6.15 shows the same tabular information stored in all three formats. 
A tab-delimited file has the field values separated by the ASCII tab character (Fig. 6.15a). A 
comma-delimited file has the field values separated by commas (Fig. 6.15b). The fixed-column 
format (also known as a formatted or space-delimited file) is most often encountered as the output 
of a computer program, such as FORTRAN. It appears similar to a tab-delimited file, but no tabs 
are present. Instead, each row is composed of a string of characters, and each field starts and ends 
at a specified character location (column). In Figure 6.15c, the first field includes columns 1–5; 
the station field goes from columns 6 to 30, and so on. (The red lines are not actually present in 
the file but have been added to the figure to help you visualize where each field starts and stops.)

Chapter 6 
186 
TIP: ArcGIS can read either tab-delimited or comma-delimited text files. It cannot read fixed-
column text files. (However, Excel™ can read fixed-column files and save them as a comma-
delimited CSV file.) 
Text files have no way to store what type of data is stored in a field. One problem with importing 
tabular data and saving them as a dbf file or geodatabase table is that ArcGIS must interpret the 
data in the field and assign a data type as best it can, and the results may be less than satisfactory. 
For example, a column containing zip codes will be interpreted as numbers, and any leading zeros 
will be eliminated (05575 becomes 5575). Putting quotes around them in the text table will 
enforce that they are interpreted as text. Text fields with only a few characters may be given a 
255-character field in the new table. Often, too, a text file will contain formatting problems, such 
as field names with spaces, or an xx in a numeric column to indicate missing data. Such issues 
will cause the import to fail and may need to be fixed before the import can be successful. 
Simple editing of text files can be done using system tools, such as the Notepad program. 
However, more advanced and powerful editing is available using the Microsoft Excel™ program. 
It can open and save a variety of text formats and can be used to translate one type to another, 
such as converting a fixed-column text file to a tab-delimited file. (The files shown in Figure 6.15 
were all saved from an Excel™ worksheet.) Since ArcGIS can open Excel™ files directly, it can 
also be helpful to assign specific text or numeric formatting to the worksheet columns to aid 
ArcGIS in translating the data types. 
TIP: To read the newer .xlsx spreadsheet format you may need to install the 2007 Office System 
Driver on your computer. To work around it, save the spreadsheet in the older .xls format. 
Mapping x-y coordinates from a table 
Another useful GIS function, Add XY, 
takes x-y coordinates from a table and 
converts them to locations on a map 
(Fig. 6.16). The x-y values must be given 
in a real-world coordinate system, such as 
latitude-longitude or UTM meters. The 
coordinate system details must also be 
known, including the geographic 
coordinate system/datum and the 
projection, and must be explicitly set in 
the Add XY window. Moreover, it should 
match the x-y values in the file, rather than 
the coordinate system of the map. For 
example, if the map is in UTM and the 
table x-y coordinates are given as 
longitude-latitude values, the coordinate 
system must be set to GCS. 
Global positioning systems (GPS) frequently provide tables of x-y data. A GPS receiver can 
calculate its location by triangulating distances and directions from a constellation of orbiting 
GPS satellites and may produce tables of x-y locations as output. Other examples of x-y data 
sources include benchmarks, surveyed points, and locations measured on a map. Regardless of 
the source, the procedure for mapping x-y locations from a table is identical.

The layer added from x-y points is called an event layer. This terminology comes from 
considering each entry in the table to be an event, such as an earthquake or a traffic accident. Not 
all tables contain events, of course, but the terminology remains. Event layers appear similar to 
point feature classes, but they do not constitute an actual feature class, for they remain a table of 
objects represented by spatial points. Some geoprocessing functions will not accept event layers 
as input. In many cases, users will export the event layer to a shapefile or a geodatabase feature 
class to make it permanent. When exported, all the attribute fields in the original table, including 
joined fields, become attributes of the feature class. 
Latitudes and longitude outside GIS systems are commonly reported in degrees-minutes-seconds 
and must be converted to decimal degrees before they can be used to create an event layer. This 
conversion is most easily performed in Excel™ using the formula: 
X in decimal degrees = degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/3600 
For example, 103° 30′ 15″ would be 103 + 30/60 + 15/3600 = 103.504167. Keep in mind that 
degrees are large units, and six or seven decimal places should be kept to ensure reasonable 
accuracy. At the equator, a meter is equal to approximately 10–5 degrees. Also, longitudes west of 
the Prime Meridian in England are negative, but the minus sign is often omitted for convenience. 
If this longitude is reported by a GPS unit in Nebraska, for example, the true value needed by the 
GIS is −103.504167.

Summary 
¾ Tables consist of rows and columns of information. A row is associated with one feature and 
includes columns of information called fields. 
¾ Tables associated with spatial data sets are called attribute tables and contain records, one for 
each feature in the data set. Standalone tables are not associated with map features. 
¾ Relational database management systems construct temporary links between data tables and 
are the preferred model for GIS software. 
¾ Queries allow the user to select certain records based on one or more criteria. Once selected, 
these records may be viewed, exported, or analyzed. 
¾ Tables may be joined or related on a common field in order to access information in one table 
from another. Joins may be performed on tables with one-to-one or many-to-one cardinality. 
Relates must be used on tables with one-to-many or many-to-many cardinality. 
¾ The Statistics function calculates basic statistical values for all selected records in a table. The 
Summarize command generates statistics about groups of features defined by a categorical field. 
¾ Fields must be defined to contain a specific type of data, such as text, integers, dates, or 
floating point values. Once defined, the field type cannot change. 
¾ ArcGIS tables can display and manipulate tabular data from a variety of sources, including 
dBase files, INFO files, geodatabases, SQL queries, or comma-delimited text files. 
¾ New fields may be added to tables by defining names and field types. New tables may have 
data entered by typing in values or by using the Calculate function. The Calculate Geometry 
function can put areas and lengths in attribute tables for the corresponding features. 
TIP: Field names must have 13 or fewer characters; may include letters, numbers, and the 
underscore character (_); and should not contain spaces or special characters, such as @, #, !, $, 
or %. Field names must also start with a letter, not a number.

Mastering the Skills 
Teaching Tutorial 
The following examples provide step-by-step instructions for doing basic tasks and solving basic 
problems in ArcGIS. The steps you need to do are highlighted with an arrow Î; follow them 
carefully. Click on the video number in the Video Index to view a demonstration of the steps. 
  Î Start ArcMap, if necessary. Navigate to the MapDocuments folder in the mgisdata 
directory and open the map document ex_6.mxd. 
  Î Use Save As to give the document a new name and save frequently as you work. 
Viewing tables 
Let’s begin by exploring some tables and learning some basic skills for working with them. Many 
table settings affect only how the tables appear and do not change the underlying data. 
1Î Right-click on the US States layer and choose Open Attribute Table from the 
context menu. 
1Î Narrow the STATE_NAME field to a more suitable width by clicking and dragging 
the right border of the field.  
The OBJECTID field simply counts the rows, so hide it from sight.  
1Î Right-click the OBJECTID field name and choose Turn Field Off. 
Notice that the STATE_ABBR field is also too wide for its data but that narrowing it will cut off 
the field name. Each field has display properties that can be set. 
2Î Right-click on STATE_ABBR and choose Properties. 
2Î Change the Alias to ABBR, and click OK.  
2Î Right-click the STATE_NAME field, open Properties, and give it the alias NAME. 
Scroll to the right and look at the fields of population data from the US Census. It is difficult to 
match the values to the right state, however, because the state names quickly scroll out of sight.  
3Î Right-click on the NAME field and choose Freeze/Unfreeze Column.  
3Î Now scroll again and see how much easier it is to read the data.  
3Î Right-click on the NAME field and choose Freeze/Unfreeze Column again to 
unfreeze the field. 
TIP: An unfrozen column will not automatically go back to its original place. 
Now let’s use the Sort function to obtain information about the largest and smallest states. 
3Î Right-click on the POP2010 heading and choose Sort Ascending from the menu.  
TIP: Right-click a field name and choose Advanced Sorting to sort on more than one field. 

Attribute Data 
191 
Notice that the POP00_SQMI field has decimal values in it, which makes it hard to compare the 
population densities of different states. We can format the field so that no decimals are displayed.  
4Î Right-click on the POP00_SQMI field and choose Properties.  
4Î Click on the button next to Numeric to open the Number Format window. 
4Î Fill the button that says Number of decimal places and enter 0. Click OK and OK.  
We can even modify which fields are shown and the order in which they appear.  
5Î Right-click the US States layer and choose Properties. Click the Fields tab. 
5Î Click the Options menu and make sure that Show Field Aliases is checked.  
5Î Click on the NAME field in the list on the left. Notice the details about its 
appearance and definition on the right (Text data type with a length of 25 characters). 
5Î Click the Turn All Fields Off button to turn all the fields off. Click Apply and move 
the Properties window aside so that the table is visible.  
5Î Turn the check boxes on for the NAME and POP2010 fields, and click Apply. These 
two fields are the only ones shown. 
5Î Click the Turn All Fields On button to turn all the fields back on. Click Apply. 
 
6Î Click on the NAME field in the Properties window to highlight it. 
6Î Click on the Move Down button to move the NAME field back to its original 
position below the Shape field. Click Apply.  
6Î Click on the Options button and examine the menu items. Then choose Sort 
Ascending, and click Apply. 
6Î Click Options again and choose Reset Field Order and click Apply. 
6Î Close the US States Layer Properties window. 
TIP: Use Reset Field Order to move an unfrozen field back to its original place. 
7Î Turn your attention again to the US States table in the Table window. 
7Î Examine the text at the bottom that says (0 out of 51 Selected). It tells you that there 
are 51 records in this table (50 states plus the District of Columbia). 
7Î Right-click the US Counties layer in the Table of Contents and choose Open 
Attribute Table. It opens as a new tab in the same Table window. 
 
8Î Click on the US States tab in the lower-left corner of the Table window to switch 
back to the US States table. 
8Î To see both tables at once, choose Table Options > Arrange Tables > New Vertical 
Tab Group. The tables now appear side by side. 
8Î Choose Table Options > Arrange Tables > Move to Previous Tab Group to return to 
the original layout. 
8Î Right-click the US Counties tab at the bottom of the Table window and choose 
Close, leaving only the US States table.

TIP: The changes to the table demonstrated in this section only affect the properties of the layer 
in this map document. They do not change the source file. 
Using queries and statistics on tables 
Often it is necessary to isolate a subset of records from a table and work with them alone. GIS 
handles this task using a query. Imagine that you are exploring the politics of the larger states. 
Let’s select the states that had more than 5 million people in the year 2010.  
9Î Click the Select By Attributes button in the Table window.  
9Î Enter the expression POP2010 > 5000000 in the query box. 
9Î Click the Verify button to make sure that you entered the expression correctly. If it is 
correct, click OK. (If not, click OK, then Clear, and try again.) 
9Î Click Apply to execute the query, then close the Select By Attributes window. 
TIP: Field names in queries may appear with brackets or quotes or nothing around them (like 
[POP2010] or “POP2010”) depending on the version of ArcMap and the format used to store the 
table. The window will always select the right style if you double-click the field names rather 
than entering them by typing. 
The selected states are highlighted in the map and in the Table window. Also, the text at the 
bottom of the Table window changes to read 22 out of 51 Selected, indicating that 22 states have 
more than 5 million people.  
10Î Click on the Show Selected Records button at the bottom of the Table window to 
view only the selected records.  
10Î Click the Show All Records button to show them all again. 
Suppose you now want to look at the states with fewer than 5 million people. The Switch 
Selection button is faster than another query. 
10Î Click the Switch Selection button in the Table window toolbar (or choose Table 
Options > Switch Selection). 
10Î Clear the selected set by clicking the Clear Selection button on the Table window. 
Now it is time to view some population statistics for the states.  
11Î Right-click on the POP2010 field name and choose Statistics from the menu. 
11Î Review the statistics values and examine the frequency distribution. 
1. Is this a normal distribution? _____What is the population of the largest state? ___________ 
(Be sure to report it using an appropriate number of significant figures.) 
11Î Use the drop-down list in the Statistics box to select the POP10_SQMI field.  
11Î Close the Statistics window. 

Attribute Data 
193 
The Statistics command uses all records, unless a subset of records has been selected, in which 
case it uses only the selected subset to calculate the statistics.  
12Î Click the Select By Attributes button in the Table window again. 
12Î Click Clear to delete the previous expression, if necessary. 
12Î Enter the expression SUB_REGION = ‘New England’. Click Verify to check it, 
and then click Apply and close the Select By Attributes window. 
TIP: Beginners often find it easier to enter expressions using double-clicks and buttons, rather 
than trying to type the expressions manually. The program helps you get the syntax right. 
13Î Right-click the POP2010 field in the Table window and choose Statistics. Examine 
the Count statistic and observe that only six states are included—the New England 
states just selected.  
13Î Close the Statistics window. 
13Î Click the Clear Selection button in the Table window to clear the selected records.  
13Î Close the Table window.  
 
14Î Turn off US States in the Table of Contents and turn on 111th Congress. 
14Î Open the table for the 111th Congress layer by right-clicking the layer name and 
choosing Open Attribute Table. 
14Î Examine the fields, noting the field PARTY. 
 
15Î Open the layer properties for 111th 
Congress layer and click the Symbology 
tab. 
15Î Create a Categories: unique values map 
based on the PARTY field. (Remember to 
click the Add All Values button to show the 
categories). Click OK. 
15Î Right-click the symbols in the Table of 
Contents to change the symbol for the 
Democratic counties to blue, the 
Republican counties to red, and the Vacant 
districts to light gray (Fig. 6.17). 
How many Democratic districts are there? We can find out using a query. 
16Î Click the Select By Attributes button in the Table window.  
16Î Enter the expression PARTY = ‘Democrat’. Use the Get Unique Values button so 
that you can select the ‘Democrat’ value instead of typing it.  
16Î Click Apply and close the Select By Attributes window. 
2. How many Democratic districts are there? ________________  
Fig. 6.17. 111th Congress districts 

Chapter 6 
194 
Finding the number of Democratic districts using a single query is fine. But suppose you wanted 
to know the number of districts for all three categories: Republican, Democrat, and Vacant? The 
Summarize command can generate statistics about multiple groups defined by a field. 
16Î Use the Clear Selection button in the table window to clear the selected records. 
 
17Î Right-click the Party field and choose Summarize. Note that the Party field is 
already entered in box #1 because you right-clicked it. 
17Î You are only interested in the number of districts, which is always counted by 
default, so you need not enter any statistics. Do not change anything in box #2. 
17Î Click the Browse button. Make sure that the Save as type is set to dBASE table and 
that you are currently in the Usa folder. Give the new file the name 
cd111numdist.dbf. 
17Î Click Save and OK, and answer Yes to add the resulting table to the map. 
TIP: Because this table was created to answer a transitory question, we saved it in the folder 
instead of making it a permanent addition to the geodatabase. Be sure to give your saved tables 
descriptive names that indicate what they contain. 
Examine the Table of Contents window. The icons at the top change how 
layers are listed. Originally, it was set to the first icon on the left, List By 
Drawing Order. Because a standalone table was added, it switched to the 
second view style, List By Source. Each layer is now listed under its folder 
or geodatabase name. This is the only view in which standalone tables are visible. 
18Î Right-click the new cd111numdist.dbf table and choose Open. 
18Î See that all three categories are listed, with the Count_PARTY field showing the 
number of districts in each category. 
18Î Right-click the cd111numdist tab in the Table window and choose Close. 
Joining tables 
Let’s find out which districts may have changed their party affiliation since the 110th Congress. 
We need to compare the party in two different tables using a query, so we must combine the two 
tables using a join. To join, we need to find a key field. 
19Î Add the cd110 feature class from the mgisdata\Usa\usdata geodatabase. 
19Î Right-click the cd110 layer and open the table. Examine the fields and try to 
identify the appropriate key field that might work to combine the tables. The key must 
be unique to each record and have the same value in both tables. 
3. What is the best potential key field in this table? ______________________ 
19Î Click the 111th Congress tab in the Table window and confirm that this field is present. 
We want 111th Congress to be the destination table. It is currently the active table in the  
Table window, so it will become the destination table as we intend. 
20Î Open the Table Options menu and choose Joins and Relates > Join. 

Attribute Data 
195 
20Î Make sure that the top 
drop-down reads Join 
attributes from a table  
(Fig. 6.18). 
20Î Choose DISTRICTID as 
the field that the join will 
be based on. 
20Î Choose cd110 as the 
table to join to the layer. 
20Î Choose DISTRICTID as 
the field in the table to base 
the join on. 
20Î Make sure that your 
window reads as shown in 
Figure 6.18, and then click 
OK. Choose Yes if asked 
to create an index. 
20Î Scroll to the right, 
noticing the additional 
fields now in the table.  
The fields from cd110 have been appended to the right of the fields for 111th Congress. 
However, it can get confusing to remember which fields came from which table. 
21Î Choose Table Options and select Show Field Aliases to uncheck it. 
Now each field name is prefixed with the name of its table (the original name, not the title in the 
Table of Contents). Hence, the 111th Congress table fields are prefixed with the name cd111, and 
the cd110 fields are prefixed with cd110. 
Now we can use a query to find the districts that have changed affiliation so that the 
cd111.PARTY field is different from the cd110.PARTY field. 
22Î Click the Select By Attributes button in the Table window. 
22Î Clear the previous expression, if necessary. 
22Î Double-click the cd111.PARTY field to enter it in the expression box; then click 
the “< >” (not equal to) button, and double-click the cd110.PARTY field.  
22ÎThe final expression should look like cd111.PARTY <> cd110.PARTY. Verify it 
and then click Apply. Close the Select By Attributes window. 
22Î Click the Table button to Show selected records. 
4. Which party received most of the changed seats in the 111th Congress? _______________ 
Let’s save the selection as a new layer for future reference and to symbolize it differently.  
23Î Right-click the 111th Congress layer in the Table of Contents, and choose 
Selection > Create Layer From Selected Features. 
23Î The new layer appeared near the top as 111th Congress selection. Rename it 
Changed Party 111. 
Fig. 6.18. Joining the tables 

Chapter 6 
196 
23Î We can turn off the join now. Click the Table Options menu, and choose Joins and 
Relates > Remove Join(s) > cd110. 
23Î Clear the selected records, click the button to Show All Records, and close the 
Table window. 
 
24Î Turn off the cd110 layer. 
24Î Click on the Changed Party 111 layer 
symbol to open the Symbol Selector and 
change it to 10% Crosshatch, which 
shows the changed districts without 
obscuring the party color (Fig. 6.19). 
24Î You may need to click the Refresh 
button (next to the Layout View button) 
to make the feature selection go away. 
Summarizing tables 
Some states have only one district; others have more. Suppose that we want to know many 
districts each state has. The Summarize function will yield this information. It will group the 
districts by state and calculate statistics for each group. 
25Î Open the attribute table of 111th Congress. 
25Î Right-click on the STATE_ABBR field and choose Summarize.  
The Summarize command always counts the number of features in each group and will report it 
in the output table, so you don’t need to request any other statistics.  
25Î Enter the name of the new table to be created, dists_per_state, making sure it 
will be saved as a dBase file in the Usa folder. Click OK. 
25Î Click Yes to add the table to the map document.  
5. Is this new table an attribute table or a standalone table? ____________________  
26Î Find the new dists_per_state.dbf table in the Table of Contents and open it.  
26Î Right-click the Count_STATE_ABBR field and choose Sort Descending.  
6. Use a query to determine how many states have only one district: _______. Clear the 
selection before going on. 
Sometimes the goal is to generate statistics about each group in addition to counting the records. 
Perhaps you would like to know the total area represented by each party. 
27Î Click the 111th Congress tab in the Table window. 
27Î Right-click the PARTY field and choose Summarize. 
27Î Verify that the field to summarize is set to PARTY (Fig. 6.20).  
27Î Locate the SQMI field in the list, expand it, and choose Sum as the statistic to 
calculate. 
27Î Enter a location and name for the output table, calling it partyarea.dbf and 
placing it in the Usa folder. 
Fig. 6.19. Map of changed districts 

Attribute Data 
197 
27Î Click OK and Yes.  
 
28Î Find the new partyarea table in the 
Table of Contents and open it. 
28Î Right-click the Sum_SQMI field and 
choose Sort Descending.  
7. Which party represents the greater area, and by 
how much? ___________________ 
28Î Close the Table window before going on. 
A map showing the number of districts in each state 
would be nice, but the dist_per_state table is a 
standalone table and can’t be mapped. However, it 
can be joined to the US States feature class. In this 
join, the US States table must be the destination. 
8. What is the cardinality of this join? 
____________________  
29Î Right-click on the US States layer and choose Joins and Relates > Join.  
29Î Choose ABBR as the field in US States to base the join on.  
29Î Choose dists_per_state as the table to join.  
29Î Choose STATE_ABBR as the field in the source table to join on.  
29Î Click OK to finish the join.  
29Î Open the US States table, and scroll all the way to the right to find the new fields 
added as a result of the join.  
The number of districts in each state is contained in the Count_STATE_ABBR field.  
30Î Close the US States table. 
30Î Turn off all of the layers in the map, and turn 
on the US States layer. 
30Î Open the US States layer properties, click the 
Symbology tab, and create a Quantities: 
graduated color map based on the 
Count_STATE_ABBR field (Fig. 6.21). 
 
31Î Right-click the US States layer and choose 
Copy. 
31Î Right-click the Layers data frame and choose 
Paste Layer(s). 
31Î Rename the new layer Number of Districts. 
Relating tables 
It would be interesting to group the representatives according to subregion, as they would have 
similar issues to address with their constituencies. However, the SUB_REGION field is in the  
Fig. 6.21. The number of districts 
Fig. 6.20. Summarizing statistics  

Chapter 6 
198 
US States table, not the districts table. Setting up a relate between the US States table and the 
111th Congress table will allow us to select a subregion and obtain a list of representatives from 
it. The common key between the tables is the state abbreviation.  
  9. What is the cardinality between subregions and districts? ____________________________ 
10. Which is the source table, and which is the destination table? _________________________ 
32Î First remove the previous join by right-clicking 
on the US States layer and choosing Joins and 
Relates > Remove Join(s) > Remove All Joins.  
32Î Right-click on the US States layer and choose 
Joins and Relates > Relate. 
32Î Enter ABBR as the field to base the relate on 
(Fig. 6.22).  
32Î Enter 111th Congress as the source table to be 
related. 
32Î Enter STATE_ABBR as the key field from the 
related table. 
32Î Enter Congress for the name of the relate. 
Click OK.  
Now let’s use the relate to find out which representatives are 
from New England states.  
33Î Open the US States table and the 111th Congress table. 
33Î Choose Table Options > Arrange Tables > New Vertical Tab Group so that both 
tables are side by side. Enlarge the Table window if needed to see both tables well. 
TIP: When more than one table is visible, the one with the darker bar across the top is the active 
table, and choices made from the Table Options menu will be applied to the active table. 
33Î Click the title bar of the US States table to make sure it is the active table. 
33Î Click Select By Attributes and select the states in the New England subregion.  
33Î Close the Select By Attributes window. 
Now that the New England states are selected and highlighted, the relate can access the 
representatives from these states. 
34Î Click on the Table Options button and choose Related Tables > Congress: cd111.  
34Î The other table view highlights the related records, now also selected. 
The Changed Party 111 layer is based on a selection from the 111th Congress layer, and so both 
of them show up in the relate. We’re not interested in the changed representatives right now, and 
there is only one match, so let’s close that table. 
34Î Right-click the Changed Party 111 tab in the Table window and choose Close.

11.  How many representatives come from New England states? ___________________ 
Exporting the selected records from the representatives table will provide a new file that can be 
saved permanently and given to interested constituents.  
35Î Click the bar of the 111th Congress table to make sure it is active. 
35Î Choose Table Options > Export. Make sure it says to export the Selected records.  
35Î Click the Browse button.  
35Î Change the Save as type to dBASE Table. Navigate inside the Usa folder. 
35Î Type in NE_reps.dbf as the name of the table and choose Save and OK.  
35Î Say Yes to add the table to the map. 
35Î Open the new NE_reps table and verify that it contains the correct representatives.  
 
36Î Choose Selection > Clear Selected Features from the main menu to clear the 
selection in all tables.  
36Î Click the US States table to make it active and choose Table Options > Joins and 
Relates > Remove Relate(s) > Remove All Relates.  
36Î Close the Table window. 
Editing values in tables 
Sometimes fields in a table must be created or updated manually. Imagine that you wish to add 
more information to the partyarea table you created earlier, indicating status as the majority or 
minority party. 
37Î Open the partyarea table. 
37Î Click Table Options and choose Add Field. Name it STATUS. 
37Î Set the Type to Text and set the Length to 10. Click OK. 
TIP: Always think about how many characters or decimal places you need before creating a field. 
To type values into a table, you must be in an edit session. Editing can be performed in only one 
folder or geodatabase at a time, so you must specify which source you want to edit. 
38Î Click the Editor Toolbar button on the Standard toolbar, to open the Editor toolbar. 
38Î Choose Editor > Start Editing from the Editor toolbar. 
38Î Click the partyarea table to highlight it and click OK. 
Notice that the field headings turn white, indicating that this table is now editable. 
39Î Click in the STATUS field in the Republican row and type Minority. Click Enter. 
39Î Type Majority in the Democrat row and click Enter. 
39Î Type Vacant in the Vacant row and click Enter. 
39Î Choose Editor > Save Edits. 
39Î Choose Editor > Stop Editing to close the edit session. 
39Î Close the Table window.

TIP: You cannot add a new field to a table during an edit session. 
Calculating fields in tables 
Imagine that we are writing a report and need a table showing the percentage of Hispanics in each 
state. The US States table has only the number of Hispanics. Creating a new field and calculating 
the percentage of Hispanics solves the problem. 
40Î Open the US States attribute table.  
40Î Click on the Table Options button and choose Add Field.  
40Î Name the field HISP_PERC and select Float as its type. Click OK.  
Now calculate the percentage of Hispanics. The minority population fields in this table represent 
2000 census data, not 2010, so we will use the POP2000 field for calculating percentages.  
TIP: Be VERY careful when calculating, because you can overwrite existing data and won’t be 
able to undo it unless you are in an edit session. Be sure a field is empty before you calculate it. 
41Î Right-click on the heading of the new, empty HISP_PERC field (located to the far 
right of the table), and choose Field Calculator from the context menu.  
41Î Double-click the field names and the operator buttons to the expression 
HISPANIC / POP2000 * 100 and click OK.  
TIP: Do all of the records equal zero, or null? You might have accidentally selected a single 
record by clicking on the table. Check the bottom status bar to see if any records are selected. If 
so, choose Table Options > Clear Selection from the table and try the calculation again.  
Finally, for a report you need to determine the density of Hispanics per square kilometer in the 
counties. You’ll need to create and calculate two new fields, the area in kilometers and the 
Hispanic density. Because you’re calculating areas, make sure the data frame coordinate system 
is set to an equal-area projection. 
42Î Close the Table window. 
42Î Open the Layers data frame properties and click the Coordinate System tab. 
42Î Set the coordinate system to the Projected Coordinate Systems > Continental > 
North America > USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic projection. 
 
43Î Open the US Counties attribute table. 
43Î Click the Table Options button and choose Add Field. 
43Î Name the field AREA_KM and set its Type to Float. Click OK. 
43Î Add another new field named HISP_SQKM, also making it a Float type. 
TIP: It is safer, but less convenient, to open an edit session before doing field calculations. Then 
you can undo a mistake, if you make one.  

Attribute Data 
201 
Now we will calculate the new fields. Areas are calculated with a special function. 
44Î Right-click the empty AREA_KM field heading and choose Calculate Geometry. 
Click Yes to calculate outside an edit session. 
44Î Set the Property to Area, fill the button to Use the coordinate system of the data 
frame, and set the units to square kilometers. Click OK. 
 
45Î Right-click the empty HISP_SQKM field and choose Field Calculator. Enter the 
expression HISPANIC / AREA_KM and click OK. 
45Î Close the Table window. Turn off all layers and then turn on the US Counties. 
 
46Î Open the symbology properties for US Counties and create a Quantities: graduated 
colors map using the HISP_SQKM field. 
The population density of Hispanics has an extremely 
skewed distribution due to the presence of densely 
populated areas like Los Angeles. The Jenks 
classification method does not show the distribution of 
Hispanics well. 
46Î Open the US Counties symbology 
properties again. 
46Î Use the Classify button and change the

48Î Open the ORstations$ table and examine the fields. Note the LAT and LON fields 
containing the station location in decimal degrees. 
Any table with x-y coordinate locations can be displayed as a point layer. You need to know the 
coordinate system of the x-y locations in the table. In this case the units are degrees of latitude 
and longitude, so we know that it is a geographic coordinate system (GCS). A look at the web site 
where these data were downloaded from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) would tell us 
that the GCS is based on the NAD 1983 datum.

Mastering the Concepts  
GIS Concepts 
Editing can update existing feature classes or create new ones. If a housing subdivision is added 
to a city, the new roads, parcels, sewer lines, and other infrastructure need to be added to the city 
database to ensure that it is up-to-date. Entirely new feature classes can be created, for example, if 
the city planning department decides to create a map of garbage collection zones where none 
existed before. Parcel ownership attributes must be updated when parcels are sold. 
Topology refers to the spatial relationships between features in terms of adjacency, connectivity, 
intersection, or overlap. When editing, care must be taken to create and maintain topological 
integrity between features, so that the relationship in the database matches the relationship in the 
real world. If two parcels share a common boundary, then the boundaries should match exactly. 
Line features, such as streets or water lines, should connect to each other in the feature class. 
Lines that cross each other should intersect at a node. Lines and polygon boundaries should not 
cross over themselves. These basic rules must be observed to ensure the logical consistency of 
features so that they properly represent the relationships of their real-world counterparts. 
Topological data models permit the user to test, locate, and fix 
topological errors. However, topology is even more important 
when editing spaghetti models because the user must manage it 
without help. This chapter introduces two capabilities that aid in 
creating and maintaining topological integrity: snapping and 
coincident boundary creation. 
Snapping features 
When creating line features that connect to each other, such as 
roads, one must take care that the features connect properly 
(Fig. 7.1). A line that fails to connect is called a dangle. Although 
you may not be able to see the gap between the lines, the gap will 
exist unless the endpoints of each line (nodes) have exactly the 
same coordinate values. Even though the map may look correct, 
certain functions, such as tracing networks or locating 
intersections, will not work properly. It is impossible to intersect 
lines properly by simple digitizing.  
Snapping ensures that the nodes of lines and the vertices of 
polygons match. When snapping is turned on, it affects features 
A dangle—the two lines fail 
to connect. 
Correct topology—the 
horizontal line intersects 
the vertical one, creating 
three lines.

being added or modified. If you 
place the cursor within a specified 
distance of an existing node or 
vertex (Fig. 7.2), then the new 
feature is snapped to the existing 
one—that is, the coordinates are 
matched at that one point. This 
distance is called the snap 
tolerance. 
Care must be taken in specifying 
the snap tolerance. If it is too 
small, then features snap won’t 
snap. If it is too large, then features 
may snap when it isn’t appropriate. Snap tolerances are set in either pixels on the screen or meters 
in the map units. A snap tolerance of 10 pixels indicates that features will be snapped if the cursor 
moves within 10 screen pixels of an existing feature. When set in pixels, the snap tolerance 
remains the same as the user zooms in and out, which is convenient. Setting the snap tolerance in 
map units is useful if the user is trying to maintain a particular level of geometric accuracy 
independent of zoom scale. Four types of snapping can be used.  
Point snapping is only used for point feature classes and snaps to an existing point. 
End snapping only allows a new vertex to be snapped to the endpoints of an existing line. End 
snapping can ensure that new streams connect to the ends of existing streams, and only to their 
ends. End snapping only applies to line features. 
Vertex snapping allows the 
endpoints of the new line to be 
snapped to any vertex in an existing 
line or polygon. It can ensure that 
adjacent parcels connect only at 
existing corners. 
Edge snapping constrains the 
feature being added to meet the 
edge of an existing line or polygon 
feature. In this case, the vertex 
being added could be placed 
anywhere on or between vertices. 
Edge snapping can ensure that a 
street ends exactly on another street. 
Figure 7.3 illustrates how snapping changes depending on the snapping type. The vertical line 
already exists in the layer, and the horizontal line is being added. The dashed circle shows 
the snap tolerance. If end snapping is turned on, then the new line will snap to the endpoint of 
the existing line (Fig. 7.3a). If edge snapping is turned on, then the line can be snapped anywhere 
between the end and the vertex (Fig. 7.3b). If vertex snapping is set, then the new line will 
connect to the closest vertex or end (Fig. 7.3c). 
If more than one kind of snapping is turned on, then the most inclusive one takes precedence. To 
ensure snapping only to ends, therefore, both edge and vertex snapping must be turned off.

Adjacent polygons 
Another type of topology to 
consider is the relationship between 
two adjacent polygons. A polygon 
is stored as a series of x-y vertices 
that completely enclose a space. If 
two polygons share a boundary, 
then that boundary gets stored 
twice. If the shared edge contains 
exactly the same x-y pairs for both 
polygons, it is called a coincident 
boundary (Fig. 7.4). If the pairs do 
not match exactly, then there will 
be gaps where the polygons fail to 
touch, or overlaps where they cross 
each other, or both. 
Both types of relationships are possible in the real world. If the two polygons represented fires 
that burned in two different years, then it is possible that the second fire might have overlapped 
the first, or that some space existed between them; in which case the presence of gaps and 
overlaps is real and necessary. However, most polygons should have coincident boundaries—soil 
units, land use areas, school districts, counties, states all represent features for which gaps and 
overlaps are errors, usually caused by careless data entry. Imagine the legal headaches that would 
ensue if the two polygons represent parcels; both overlaps and gaps would likely be in dispute as 
to who owned what. When editing polygons, it is important to ensure that the right relationship is 
incorporated into the database, and that adjacent polygons have coincident boundaries, except for 
the rare instances when gaps or overlaps are justified. 
About ArcGIS 
The editing process begins by opening the Editor toolbar, starting an edit session, and identifying which 
folder or geodatabase will be available for editing. Only one folder or geodatabase (called a workspace) 
can be edited at a time, but all the feature classes in the folder or geodatabase can be edited together.  
The Editor toolbar 
The Editor toolbar provides access and shortcuts to many editing functions (Fig. 7.5). The first 
button on the left opens the Editor menu, used for turning editing on and off, setting options, and 
performing certain editing tasks. The Edit tool selects one or more features for editing. It is 
similar to the Select Features tools on the Standard toolbar but should always be used for editing.

Next come the Sketching tools, an assortment of methods to add vertices to a feature. The default 
is a straight line segment between vertices, but one can also create curves, right angles, 
midpoints, and other specialized vertices. The Sketching tools provide a lot of flexibility in 
creating features. The next four buttons provide access to common tasks, including editing the 
vertices of an existing feature to change its shape, splitting a line into two features, cutting a 
polygon in two, and rotating a feature.  
The final three buttons launch editing windows. The Attributes window provides a convenient 
place for editing feature attributes. The Sketch Properties window is used to examine and, if 
desired, edit x-y coordinates of sketches. The Create Features window contains and manages 
editing templates, which are used to create new features. 
What can you edit? 
ArcGIS offers different levels of editing capability depending on the type of license. ArcGIS 
Basic can edit shapefiles and personal or file geodatabases. ArcGIS Standard and ArcGIS 
Advanced can also edit SDE databases, geometric networks, and planar topology. All of these 
levels are accessed through the same ArcMap interface.  
ArcMap can edit several layers at once, as long as they are all in the same folder or geodatabase 
(workspace). This capability makes it easier to view and edit related layers simultaneously or to 
copy features from one layer to another. 
TIP: Coverages cannot be edited in ArcMap. Use the ArcEdit program in Workstation ArcInfo 
instead, or convert the coverages to shapefiles or geodatabases for editing. 
Editing and coordinate systems 
ArcMap can edit layers with different coordinate systems from the data frame. The edits will 
automatically be converted to the coordinate system of the layer being edited. Consider editing a 
shapefile of roads stored in a GCS while displaying the roads with a digital orthophotoquad 
(DOQ) in a UTM projection. The roads coordinates will be converted into decimal degrees before 
they are put into the shapefile. 
Performance and reliability 
Although ArcMap has many useful capabilities, such as editing across coordinate systems and 
editing multiple files simultaneously, one must be cautious in taking advantage of these benefits. 
If an editing scenario is demanding extensive system resources by having many files open or by 
doing many projection transformations during an edit session, system performance and reliability 
may suffer. Moreover, because spatial data files are complex constructions, the price of an editing 
glitch may be the loss of data integrity; an ill-timed system glitch might not only lose recent 
changes but also corrupt the entire data set. Thus, you are encouraged to use the following 
procedures while editing: 
¾ Always have a backup copy of the file being edited, stored elsewhere on the disk or on a 
different medium. This precaution is especially important when working on data sets that 
would be expensive or impossible to replace, should something go wrong. 
¾ Limit the number of open files. A prolonged editing session should be conducted in its 
own map document and include only the layers that are needed.  
¾ Avoid extensive editing in map documents whose primary purpose is cartography or 
analysis, and in which you have invested hours of effort. The author has found that 

Basic Editing 
209 
editing sometimes corrupts map documents. They look fine, but tools will crash when 
run. The map documents then need to be re-created, potentially wasting hours of effort.  
¾ Save edits frequently in case of a system glitch. ArcMap does NOT automatically save 
edits at regular time intervals. However, remember that saving also clears the “Undo” 
memory of edits. After edits are saved, they can no longer be undone.  
Feature templates 
Editing utilizes feature templates. A feature template stores the information needed to edit a 
particular layer in the map document. It includes the feature class in which the edits will be 
stored, the attributes that are assigned to new features, and the default tool that is used to create 
them. The template shown in Figure 7.6a is named Commercial. It saves features into a polygon 
layer called buildings. By default, the plain Polygon construction tool is used. The fields contain 
default values that are added to each feature, including its designation as a Commercial building. 
Multiple templates may be constructed for each feature class. As shown in Figure 7.6b, the 
buildings layer has another template called Residential. It is identical to the Commercial template 
except that the building type field, Bldgtype, contains “Residential”. If the user is digitizing a new 
commercial building, she clicks on the Commercial template. When the building is added, the 
default attributes “Commercial”, “Austin”, and “TX” are automatically placed in the attribute 
fields. If she wishes to add a residential building, she clicks the Residential template, she digitizes 
the building, and the attributes are entered. Using templates can save a great deal of typing to 
enter attributes. Only the address field, which is unique to each feature, must be edited manually. 
Templates are accessed and managed in the Create Features window (Fig. 7.6b). The upper panel 
lists each available template, and the user selects the desired template from this panel when ready 
to create a new feature.

Features window showing the available templates

Chapter 7 
210 
The lower panel shows the available construction tools for that feature type, with the default one 
defined by the template at the top. Each feature class type has its own set of construction tools 
used to create various shapes or perform special tasks, such as creating an ellipse or a rectangle. 
The two buttons at the top of the Create Features window control the grouping and sorting of the 
templates (left) and the creation and management of templates (right).  
Templates should be automatically created for each active layer in a feature class when editing is 
initiated. However, the user can also create and edit templates as needed. Moreover, templates 
can be saved and reused, and so they also contain descriptions and tags that can help in searching 
for stored templates. The Search window provides access to stored templates. 
How editing works 
An editing session must be initiated before any changes to a file can be made. This requirement 
protects the user from accidentally making changes to a file without realizing it. Also, because 
ArcMap can edit within only one directory or one geodatabase at a time, opening the session 
establishes the workspace being edited. 
Basic editing uses three main components: the Edit tool, the feature templates, and the 
construction tools. The Edit tool selects existing features when they need to be moved, rotated, 
deleted, and so on. It is analogous to the Select Features tool on the Standard toolbar, but it 
should always be used for editing. The templates control the features being added and in which 
layer they go. The construction tools control the characteristics of the feature being created. 
Creating sketches 
The construction tools are used to create a sketch, a 
provisional feature being entered, analogous to an artist 
making a light pencil sketch prior to inking in the final lines of 
a drawing. This sketch is not added to the target layer until it is 
“finished” by double-clicking the last vertex. The green outline 
in Figure 7.7 shows a nearly completed polygon sketch, in 
which green vertices are separated by straight line segments. 
The latest vertex, just added, is shown in red. New vertices are 
added to a sketch using one of the Sketching tools on the 
Feature Construction or Editor toolbar.  
The Straight Segment sketching tool is the default. It appears 
as the first button on the left on the Editor toolbar. It merely 
creates a straight line segment between the last and the new 
vertex. It was used to create the polygon in Figure 7.7. 
Another tool that is commonly used and placed on the Editor 
toolbar is the End Point Arc Segment tool, used to create a 
smooth curve between two endpoints. 
Additional Sketching tools are accessed by clicking the drop-
down menu to the right of the Straight Segment and End Point 
Arc Segment tools (Fig. 7.8). The Right Angle tool, for 
example, forces the sketch corners to be square, making it easier to create buildings. Other 
sketching tools create curves, make parallel or perpendicular lines, trace along existing features, 
create midpoints or tangents, and do other specialized tasks. In this chapter, we learn to use two 
of the most common sketching tools, the default Straight Segment tool and the Right Angle tool.

211 
SKILL TIP: The functions and instructions for all of the Sketching tools may be found in the 
Skills Reference section (Editing). 
While the user is sketching, a 
mini-toolbar known as the 
Feature Construction menu 
floats near the cursor on the 
screen. It provides quick 
access to different sketching 
tools and a choice of ways to 
add the next vertex. If you 
find the floating Feature 
Construction menu 
annoying, you can turn it off 
from the Editor toolbar using 
the Editor > Options menu. 
Vertex and Sketch menus 
During editing you can 
access two context menus to 
aid in certain tasks or 
change edit settings 
(Fig. 7.9). The Vertex 
menu appears when you 
right-click on the sketch 
(Fig. 7.9a). This menu 
provides functions for 
adding, deleting, or moving 
vertices. The Sketch menu 
appears when you right-
click off the sketch 
(Fig. 7.9b). This menu 
provides functions for specifying 
exact angles, lengths, distances, and more. 
The Snapping toolbar 
A small toolbar to control snapping allows easy access to 
snapping tools in the middle of a sketch. The four basic kinds 
of snapping (point, end, vertex, and edge from left to right in 
Figure 7.10) are controlled with the click of a button. A menu extends the snapping types to 
intersection snapping (where two lines intersect at a common node), midpoint snapping at the 
midpoint of a line, and tangent snapping to a curve. The snap tolerance can also be controlled here. 
Adding adjacent polygons 
A special construction tool is used for adding adjacent polygons when they must have coincident 
boundaries. The Polygon construction tool is first used to enter a complete polygon with no 
neighbors. To add an adjacent polygon, you must switch to the Auto Complete Polygon tool and 
digitize only the new part of the polygon. The editor ensures that the polygons share a coincident 
boundary and are free from topological errors, including gaps and overlaps (Fig. 7.11).

context menus: (a) Vertex 
menu and (b) Sketch menu

Chapter 7 
212 
Another way to add adjacent 
polygons uses the Cut Polygons 
construction tool. With this 
method, an outer polygon is 
constructed around an area 
encompassing two or more 
polygons, and then the internal 
boundaries are added by cutting 
the polygons along the intended 
coincident boundary. 
Editing attributes 
Editing features often includes 
editing their attributes. The user 
can modify attributes in two ways. In the first way, edits are typed directly into an attribute table, 
as discussed in Chapter 6. The second method uses the Attributes window to edit the values of 
single or multiple features.  
The Attributes window is 
accessed through a button on the 
Editor toolbar (Fig. 7.12). The 
upper panel shows the currently 
selected records; if no features 
or records are selected, then both 
areas will be blank. The lower 
panel shows the attributes of the 
highlighted feature in the upper 
panel. When the feature is 
clicked in the upper panel, the 
feature flashes on the screen to 
indicate which one it is, and the 
attributes in the lower panel may 
be edited. 
The window also allows editing 
of attributes for multiple 
features. If the top row 
containing the feature class (Streets) is clicked, then the attribute values go blank. Further updates 
to the attributes are applied to all of the selected features.

Summary 
¾ Editing creates and maintains features in a feature class. Care must be taken to ensure 
topological integrity when editing. 
¾ Snapping ensures that features connect properly with each other by automatically matching 
the coordinates of features within a certain distance of each other (the snap tolerance). 
Features may be snapped to points, endpoints, vertices, or edges. 
¾ When adding adjacent polygons, you must ensure that they have coincident boundaries by 
using snapping, the Auto Complete Polygon tool, or the Cut Polygons tool. 
¾ Editing sessions are initiated and controlled using the Editor toolbar. You may edit multiple 
layers of data, but only one geodatabase or folder may be edited at a time. 
¾ Edits are stored in the same coordinate system as the layer, regardless of the coordinate 
system of the data frame. However, editing is streamlined when the layer and frame 
coordinate systems match so that no reprojection need take place. 
¾ Basic editing uses the Edit tool, feature templates, and the construction tools. The Edit tool 
selects features to edit.  
¾ Feature templates define all the properties needed to create new features, including the 
feature class to place them in, the default construction tool to use, and the attributes with any 
default values in them.  
¾ Multiple templates may be created for one feature class, enabling different attributes values to 
be given to different classes of features. 
¾ The construction tools create preliminary figures called sketches. Finishing the sketch creates 
the new feature in the feature class. 
¾ Different Sketching tools provide a variation of functions for placing vertices. Context menus 
provide additional tools for specialized functions.

Mastering the Skills 
Teaching Tutorial  
The following examples provide step-by-step instructions for doing basic tasks and solving basic 
problems in ArcGIS. The steps you need to do are highlighted with an arrow Î; follow them 
carefully. Click on the video number in the Video Index to view a demonstration of the steps. 
  Î Start ArcMap and open the map document ex_7a.mxd in the MapDocuments folder. 
  Î Use Save As to rename the document and remember to save frequently as you work. 
Creating new feature classes 
You are working on a project for Austin regarding the outcrop of an important aquifer, the 
Edwards Limestone. You will digitize from a USGS map that is already scanned and 
georeferenced, using the same coordinate system as the rest of the Austin data. Before starting, 
you need to create empty feature classes that will contain your new digitized features. 
1Î Open the Catalog tab. Right-click the 
mgisdata\Austin folder and choose 
New > File Geodatabase. Name it 
Edwards. 
1Î Open ArcToolbox > Data 
Management Tools > Feature Class > 
Create Feature Class. 
1Î Click the Browse button for Feature 
Class Location (Fig. 7.13). Navigate to 
the mgisdata\Austin folder and select 
the Edwards geodatabase. Click Add. 
1Î Name the new feature class 
karstfeatures. 
 
2Î Set the Geometry Type to POINT. 
2Î Leave the Template Feature Class 
blank. 
2Î Scroll down, if necessary, to locate the 
Coordinate System box. Click the 
Browse button. 
2Î Click the Add Coordinate System drop-down button and choose Import. 
2Î Navigate to mgisdata\Austin\Austin geodatabase and select the Environmental 
feature dataset. Click Add.  
1. We used Import in order to guarantee that the coordinate system of our new feature class 
matched our other data. What coordinate system is it? _________________________ 
2Î Click the newly added coordinate system and click the Favorites button. Click OK to 
close the Spatial Reference Properties window. 
2Î Click OK to finish creating karstfeatures. 
Fig. 7.13. Creating a feature class 

Chapter 7 
216 
The new feature class is automatically added to the map document. Next we’ll create two more 
feature classes for faults and geology.  
3Î Use the Create Feature Class tool again to create a line feature class named faults in 
the Edwards geodatabase. Make sure that the feature geometry is set to POLYLINE 
and that you select the right coordinate system from the Favorites folder. 
 
4Î Create a polygon feature class named geology. Make sure that the feature geometry 
is set to POLYGON and select the right coordinate system from the Favorites folder. 
We also need to set up some fields for these feature classes. 
5Î Open the Catalog tab, find the Edwards geodatabase, and expand it. 
5Î Right-click the faults feature class and choose Properties. Click the Fields tab. 
5Î Click inside the first empty Field Name box and type Linetype to name the field. 
5Î Click inside the Data Type box for Linetype and choose Text for the Data Type. 
5Î Set the Length in the Field Properties box to 10. Click OK. 
TIP: This method of creating fields is better when multiple fields need to be added to a feature 
class, instead of using the Table Options method we’ve used previously. 
6Î Use the Catalog tab to open the properties for the Edwards/geology feature class. 
6Î Add a text field named Unit with a length of 6. Click OK. 
 
7Î Open the properties for the Edwards/karstfeatures feature class. 
7Î Add a text field named Type with a length of 15. Click OK. 
Digitizing points and lines 
Now we set up the editing session. We will be digitizing features by tracing them from the 
scanned and georeferenced image—sometimes called “heads up” digitizing. 
8Î If the Editor toolbar is not visible, click the Editor button. 
8Î From the Editor toolbar, choose Editor > Start Editing.  
8Î Choose the geodatabase to edit by selecting the Edwards geodatabase from the lower 
part of the window. Click OK. 
8Î If no Create Features window appears automatically, choose Editor > Editing 
Windows > Create Features. 
TIP: In Edit mode, some other functions are disabled, such as adding fields, to help prevent 
damage to data sets. It is wise to be in Edit mode only when you are actually editing. 
Examine the Create Features window. It shows a feature template for each feature class. A 
template is a collection of edit settings for a layer. Below the template panel lies a Construction 
Tools panel, showing the tools available for that template. 

Basic Editing 
217 
8Î Click on the karstfeatures template. Notice that two construction tools are available, 
Point and Point at end of line, and that Point is currently active. 
8Î Click on the geology template. A longer list of different tools appears. 
TIP: If you cannot see the entire list of tools, place the cursor on the line between the upper and 
lower parts of the window and move it up to enlarge the lower window. 
First we are going to digitize some springs, shown on the geological map as blue dots. Look for a 
group of six springs near the SW corner of the map (Fig. 7.14). 
9Î Zoom in to the group of springs. 
9Î Click the karstfeatures template again. 
9Î Click inside one of the blue dots to add 
a point. 
9Î Continue adding points until you have 
digitized all of the springs in view. 
Notice that the last one clicked is highlighted, 
indicating that it is selected. 
9Î Click the Delete key. It will delete the highlighted point, the last one entered. 
9Î Click on the spring again to reenter the point. 
We need to enter attributes for the springs as well. 
10Î Right-click the karstfeatures layer in the Table of Contents and choose Open 
Attribute Table. 
10Î Click inside the highlighted box for the Type field and type spring. 
10Î Click the next box up and type spring in it also. 
10Î To select a feature from the table, click on the gray area to the left of a row with an 
empty Type box to select the feature.  
The Attributes window is a handier way to enter attributes while editing. 
11Î Click the Attributes button on the Editor toolbar.  
TIP: If the Attributes window does not appear, look at the bottom of the Create Features window 
for an additional tab. To open it, click the tab and drag it away from the Create Features window. 
11Î The top panel has one feature, the currently selected one, labeled with its ObjectID. 
11Î In the lower panel, find the Type field. Click in the box that currently says <Null> 
and type spring. Click Tab to enter it. Watch it update in the Table window. 
It would be tedious to type “spring” for every single feature. There’s a better way. 
12Î Dock the Attributes window under the Table of Contents. 
Fig. 7.14. Adding the springs 

Chapter 7 
218 
12Î Adjust the boundaries between the Table of 
Contents and the two Attributes panels so that you 
can see several rows of space in the upper panel and 
the two fields in the lower panel (Fig. 7.15). 
12Î Resize and position the Table window to see it.  
 
13Î Choose the Edit tool from the Editor toolbar. 
13Î Click and drag a rectangle around all six springs to 
select them. The Attributes window shows all of them 
(Fig. 7.15; only four are visible in the figure). 
13Î Click the karstfeatures heading at the top of the list 
of selected features. 
13Î Type spring in the Type field at the bottom and 
click Tab. The value is entered in all rows of the table. 
TIP: Highlight the feature class name at the top of the Attributes window to make the field edits 
apply to all of the selected records. 
14Î Right-click one of the features in the top panel of the Attributes window and 
examine the entries of the context menu. 
14Î Close the Table window. 
14Î On the Editor toolbar, choose Editor > Save Edits. 
14Î Clear the selected features using the usual button on the Standard toolbar. 
One of the advantages of templates is that you can easily switch between layers. 
15Î Find the fault that travels diagonally across the map through one of the springs. 
Pan/Zoom so that you can see the entire fault, both solid and dashed ends. 
15Î Click the faults template. Notice that Line is the default construction tool. 
15Î Click to place a vertex at the lower end of the solid part of the line. 
15Î Click another point on the line some distance from the first. 
15Î Keep adding vertices until you reach the end of the solid part. Double-click there to 
complete the sketch. A highlighted line feature appears. 
TIP: If you are not satisfied with the fault, click Delete (while it is still highlighted) to get rid of 
it and try again. If it is no longer highlighted, use the Edit tool to select it. 
16Î In the Attributes window, click in the Linetype box and enter solid. Click Tab. 
16Î Move the cursor toward the lower end of the fault just added, as if you were 
creating the next fault, but don’t click yet. 
Notice that, as you get close to the end of the line, some text and a symbol appear, called Snap 
Tips. They show what the next vertex will snap to. 
16Î Move the cursor along the fault and watch as the Snap Tips change. 
Click and 
drag to 
change size 
of panels. 
Fig. 7.15. The Attributes 
window 

Basic Editing 
219 
The text “Faults: Endpoint” appears at the ends of the existing fault. The text “Faults: Vertex” 
appears when you run over a vertex. The text “Faults: Edge” appears in between vertices.  
16Î Place the cursor on the lower end of the fault, making sure that “Faults: Endpoint” 
is being displayed. Click to enter the first vertex for the new fault. 
16Î Add several vertices on the dashed line. Double-click at the end to finish the sketch. 
16Î Enter dashed in the Linetype box of the Attributes window and click Tab or Enter. 
You probably can’t see the first fault now because its thin symbol does not show up well.  
17Î In the Table of Contents, change the symbol for faults to a 2-pt. green line.  
17Î Add the upper dashed fault, taking care to snap to the end of the solid fault. 
17Î Enter dashed in the Attributes window. 
TIP: The floating mini-toolbar can be annoying. To turn it off, choose Editor > Options, click the 
General tab, and uncheck the box to Show feature construction toolbar.  
18Î Zoom to the full extent of the map. Find some black 
dots east of the six springs and zoom to them. These are 
more karst features—caves or sinkholes.  
18Î Enter the black points using the karstfeatures template. 
18Î Click the Edit tool and draw a rectangle to select them. 
18Î Highlight the top karstfeatures entry in the Attributes 
window and enter the text cave/sink into the Type box in 
the Attributes window. 
TIP: To change the text used to label the records in the Attributes window, change the Display 
Expression on the Display tab of the layer properties. 
19Î Just for a little more practice, click on the faults template. 
19Î Digitize two or three of the short dashed faults in this view. Remember to assign 
their attributes as dashed. 
19Î Choose Editor > Save Edits from the Editor toolbar. 
19Î Click the Save button on the Standard toolbar to save the map document.  
TIP: Saving the map document does NOT save the edits, and vice versa. 
Working with snapping 
Snapping ensures that all the features that are supposed to touch actually do. It helps prevent 
topological errors between features. Let’s see how it works. 
20Î Choose Editor > Snapping > Options. 
20Î Make sure that the snap tolerance is set to the default 10 pixels. 
20Î Examine the Snap Tips check boxes, which control the snapping guides. Click OK. 

Chapter 7 
220 
TIP: Use the Show Tips check box to control whether Snap Tips appear and what they include. 
20Î Choose Editor > Snapping > Snapping Toolbar. 
20Î Choose Snapping from the Snapping toolbar and examine the menu choices. (If it 
does not appear, try choosing it again from Customize on the main toolbar). 
The Snapping toolbar is a quick way to turn each type of snapping on or off.  
21Î Dock the Snapping toolbar in an accessible place. 
21Î Look above the Kprd text in the blue polygon and 
find the fault that starts dashed at the upper end and 
changes to solid at the lower end (A in Fig. 7.16). 
21Î Click the faults template and digitize the dashed 
upper end, moving from NE to SW. Stop where the 
dash ends and double-click to finish the sketch. 
21Î Enter dashed in the Attributes window. 
In the next section, you want to snap only to the end of the 
existing fault—not to its edge. 
22Î On the Snapping toolbar, click both the vertex and 
edge snapping symbols to the off position. 
22Î Begin the next solid section of the fault. As you get to the cave symbol, however, 
the point snapping is a problem. 
22Î Turn off Point snapping on the Snapping toolbar (even in the middle of a sketch!). 
22Î Continue digitizing the fault. Snap to the ends of any faults that touch it, if they 
have been digitized already. 
22Î When you run against the edge of the map, don’t finish the sketch yet. 
22Î Switch to the Pan tool and move the view to show the rest of the fault. 
22Î Click on the faults template again, and your sketch resumes where you left off. 
22Î Continue digitizing, and finish the sketch when you get to the end of the fault.  
22Î Enter solid for the attribute. 
 
23Î Click on the edge of the image to start the next fault below the first. 
23Î Alternate between sketching and panning to digitize the entire solid part of this 
fault, ending where it appears to split into two segments by the caves. Enter solid. 
23Î Start another fault on the end, taking the upper branch and digitizing up to where 
the fault splits again near the text “Buda”. Enter solid. 
 
24Î North and northeast of “Buda” you will see additional caves and springs. 
24Î Change to the karstfeatures template and add the springs (blue circles). 
24Î Use the Edit tool to select them all and assign them the spring attribute.

Basic Editing 
221 
25Î Click the karstfeatures template and add the caves (black circles). 
25Î Change to the Edit tool, select them all, and assign them the cave/sink attribute. 
25Î Choose Editor > Save Edits. Clear any selected features. 
2. Use the Measure tool to find the diameter of the cave or spring point markers in ground 
units __________. What is the source scale of the EdwardsCrop raster? ____________ 
It is not easy to get the points in the exact center of the circles, and a circle occupies a large area 
on the ground. How is the source scale of this map impacting the geometric accuracy of the 
springs? If you put the points on a GPS and tried to find the springs, would it be easy or difficult? 
Using the sketch context menus 
Let’s look at ways in which the Sketch menu enhances editing, such as correcting mistakes. 
26Î Zoom to the full extent of the map. Find a clear area and zoom to it. The next 
editing is just practice. 
26Î Click on the faults template. 
26Î Enter some vertices along a random line. Notice that the last vertex is red and the 
other vertices are green. 
26Î Right-click on top of the last red vertex to open the Vertex menu. 
26Î Choose Finish Sketch. 
Choosing Finish Sketch does the same thing as double-clicking at the end of the sketch. 
27Î Start another line and add some vertices. 
27Î Right-click the last red vertex to open the Vertex menu and choose Delete Vertex. 
The last vertex was deleted and the second-to-last one is now red. This menu can delete any of 
the previous vertices. 
27Î Right-click on any of the green vertices and choose Delete Vertex. 
27Î Right-click another vertex and examine the menu again. 
27Î Click on the window bar at the top to close the menu without choosing anything. 
Notice that all this time we are still in the middle of creating this sketch. 
28Î Right-click on the sketch between two vertices.  
28Î Choose Insert Vertex from the context menu.  
Remember, clicking ON the sketch gives the Vertex menu. A different menu appears if you click 
OFF the sketch. 
28Î Right-click OFF the sketch, somewhere on the map. The Sketch menu appears.  
28Î Choose Delete Sketch from the menu. 
Some of the entries, such as Finish Sketch and Delete Sketch, are found in both menus. If you 
make a mistake as we continue, you can delete the sketch and start over at any time. 
29Î Start a new sketch with several vertices. 

Chapter 7 
222 
29Î Right-click off the sketch to open the Sketch menu. 
29Î Choose the second entry, Direction. 
29Î Type 90 in the Direction box and press Enter. 
As the mouse moves, the cursor is constrained along a vertical line, 
forcing the next segment to follow the specified angle. Angles are 
measured counterclockwise from the east (Fig. 7.17). 
29Î Click along the line to enter a vertex. The new segment 
is exactly vertical. 
29Î Double-click to finish the sketch. 
3. What angle would you enter to create a line going S25°W? _______________________ 
Next, let’s create a segment of a specific length. 
30Î Start a sketch and add several vertices. 
30Î Right-click off the sketch and choose Length from the Sketch menu. 
30Î Type 5000 into the box and press Enter. 
4. What do you think are the units of these distance values? _______________________ 
30Î Move the cursor around, noting how the last segment remains the same length. 
30Î Click somewhere to enter the vertex. 
TIP: If the last segment goes off the page or is too small to see, try entering a different length. 
Simply right-click off the sketch again and type in a different length value. 
The Sketch menu also combines the length and direction functions to enter a line with a particular 
bearing and direction. We will use this feature to enter the next segment of the same sketch. 
31Î Right-click off the sketch and choose Direction/Length. 
31Î Type 45 for the direction and 5000 for the length (you can use different values, if 
necessary, to keep the sketch on the screen). Click Enter when both boxes are filled. 
31Î Note that you didn’t have to click to enter the vertex. Double-click to finish. 
SKILL TIP: Learn to use the other functions on the Vertex and Sketch menus (Editing). 
Digitizing polygons 
Now we will learn how to create polygons. First we will practice with the construction tools. 
32Î Use the Edit tool to select the practice lines and delete them. 
32Î Click on the geology template. The Polygon construction tool is the default. 
32Î Start a polygon by adding several vertices. Notice how the shape remains closed, 
with the last vertex always connected to the first.

Fig. 7.17. Angles are 
measured in degrees 
from horizontal. 

Basic Editing 
223 
32Î Double-click the last vertex to finish the sketch. 
32Î Try adding several more polygons that don’t touch each other, for practice. 
Next we will create some adjacent polygons. It is important to use the Auto Complete Polygon 
tool so that the polygons have a coincident boundary.  
33Î Turn on Vertex snapping by clicking the toggle on 
the Snapping toolbar. 
33Î Change the construction tool to Auto Complete 
Polygon. 
33Î Click INSIDE an existing polygon to start the 
sketch (Fig. 7.18). 
33Î Snap to a vertex of the existing polygon on the way 
out, for neater polygons. 
33Î Add more vertices to define the new polygon. 
33Î Add the last vertex INSIDE the existing polygon and double-click to finish. 
TIP: The Auto Complete tool will not construct a 
polygon unless the space defined by the existing 
polygon(s) and the sketch is completely enclosed. 
34Î Begin a new sketch inside one of the 
polygons, digitize the boundary of a new 
polygon, and end inside the other polygon 
(Fig. 7.19a). Finish the sketch. 
Splitting provides another way to create adjacent 
polygons with coincident boundaries.  
35Î Select one of the polygons with the Edit tool 
(Fig. 7.20). 
35Î Click the Cut Polygons tool on the Editor toolbar. 
35Î Start a sketch OUTSIDE the selected polygon 
and add a line that goes through it. 
35Î Add the last vertex OUTSIDE the polygon and 
double-click to finish the sketch. 
Cutting works on multiple polygons, too. 
35Î Check that the two polygons are still 
selected. If not, select them (Fig. 7.21). 
35Î Sketch another line through both and 
finish the sketch. 
Now you have the basic skills to do some real polygon 
editing. First, let’s clean up.
36Î Use the Edit tool to select and delete the practice polygons.

Chapter 7 
224 
36Î Zoom to the full extent of the map. 
36Î Pan and zoom until you can see the 
polygons shown in Figure 7.22. 
TIP: Sometimes features do not disappear when you 
press Delete. If this happens, click the Edit tool on the 
Editor toolbar and press Delete again. The Delete key 
does not work with some of the cursor tools, but it 
always works if the Edit tool is active. 
Now we will try digitizing some geology polygons on 
the SW end of the outcrop area. Treat the faults as 
geological contacts that define boundaries of the 
polygons. 
37Î Click the geology template. 
37Î Start digitizing polygon A in Figure 7.22. Take care, but it doesn’t have to be 
perfect for this exercise. Double-click to finish. 
TIP: For best results, place vertices at sharp corners. Use fewer vertices on straight lines and 
more on curves. 
38Î Type Kkd into the Unit field in the Attributes window.  
38Î In the Table of Contents, change the geology symbol to 10% Cross Hatch.  
38Î Open the geology layer properties and click the Labels tab. Turn the labels on and 
change the Label Field to Unit. Set the font to Arial 12-pt. Bold. Click OK. 
Polygon B is adjacent to polygon A. To ensure that they have a common boundary, we must use 
the Auto Complete Polygon tool.  
39Î Turn on Edge snapping by clicking the toggle button in the Snapping toolbar. 
39Î Click on the Auto Complete Polygon tool in the Construction Tools panel. 
39Î Start by snapping to the upper-right vertex of polygon A.  
39Î Click along the fault until the purple area ends; then follow the geological contact 
between the purple and brown polygons to the lower fault. 
39Î Click along the lower fault. End by snapping to the vertex of polygon A.  
Double-click to finish the polygon. 
39Î Click in the Unit box in the Attributes window and type Kkbn. 
Notice how the Auto Complete Polygon tool used the boundary from polygon A, ensuring that 
the two polygons shared an identical boundary and that you did not have to digitize it twice. 
40Î Select the Auto Complete Polygon tool again. 
40Î Start at the lower-left corner of the Kkd polygon A and snap to the vertex.  
40Î Digitize counterclockwise around pink polygon C.

225 
40Î At the end, snap to an edge or a vertex of polygon B. Double-click to finish. 
40Î Enter the unit name, Kkd, in the Attributes window.  
 
41Î Start polygon D in the lower-middle part of polygon C, snapping to its vertex. 
41Î Start trying to digitize this narrow slice of polygon D. 
Polygon D is close to polygon C in places, and you may find that it is snapping when you don’t 
want to. Two things might help: zooming in and reducing the snap tolerance. 
41Î Right-click near the sketch and choose Delete Sketch from the context menu. 
41Î Zoom in so that polygon D fills the screen. 
41Î From the Editor toolbar, choose Editor > Snapping > Options. Change the 
Tolerance from 10 pixels to 5 pixels and click OK.  
 
42Î Click the Auto Complete Polygon tool and start digitizing polygon D again, 
snapping to the vertex of polygon C as before. 
42Î Don’t let the sketch cross into polygon C—keep the unit narrow and thin along the 
existing polygon. 
42Î When ending, be sure to snap to an edge or a vertex of polygon B. 
42Î Enter the Unit name Kkbn in the Attributes window. 
Cutting polygons is sometimes easier than using Auto Complete.  
43Î Pan so that you can see the long, thin slice above the fault. 
43Î Click the Auto Complete Polygon tool. Snap to the upper-
right corner of Polygon B, and enter vertices along the fault, 
then up and around to enclose the entire slice. End by 
snapping to the edge or vertex of Polygon A. 
 
44Î While the slice is highlighted, click the Cut Polygons tool from the Editor toolbar. 
44Î Digitize across the slice along the fault, starting and ending outside the slice. The 
slice is cut in two. 
44Î Digitize across the still-selected slice again, following the geological contact 
between the purple and brown units.  
 
45Î Click the Edit tool and select the two brown parts of the slice (hold the Shift key 
down to select both). 
45Î Click the top geology entry in the Attributes window and enter the unit for both 
polygons, Kgru. 
45Î Select the middle purple unit, and enter its attribute, Kkbn. 
 
46Î Switch to the Auto Complete Polygon tool and digitize the purple polygon below 
the slice, starting and ending along the slice edge.  
46Î Enter its attribute, Kkbn. 
Slice 

Chapter 7 
226 
47Î Pan or Zoom, if needed, to see the entire large Kgru brown polygon.  
47Î Use Auto Complete Polygon to enter it, being sure to snap it to existing polygon 
vertices at both ends. Enter its attribute, Kgru. 
Now we have a problem. The new polygon has completely enclosed the 
purple Kkbn polygon, and now they overlap each other. We should fix it. 
48Î Click the Edit tool and select the purple Kkbn polygon.  
48Î Chose Editor > Clip from the Editor toolbar. 
48Î Fill the button to Discard the area that intersects and click OK. 
 
49Î Click the Auto Complete Polygon tool and digitize the small purple polygon that 
remains, snapping it to the polygon above it. Enter Kkbn.  
49Î Close off the last section of brown polygon along the dashed fault. Enter Kgru. 
 
50Î Zoom to the new polygons (Fig. 7.23). 
50Î Choose Editor > Stop Editing. You will be 
prompted to save your edits. Say yes! 
50Î Save the map document.  
When digitizing adjacent polygons, the order is important. 
New polygons must enclose a space completely using a single 
line. In this exercise, you were instructed to create them in a 
suitable order, but you must learn to look ahead and plan. 
Adding buildings 
Now that you have some experience creating features, we will 
investigate some additional tools for city editing. 
Î Open the ex_7b.mxd map document and use Save As to save it with a new name. 
Let’s look at another way to create a new, empty feature class for building footprints. 
51Î Open the Catalog tab and navigate to mgisdata\Austin.  
51Î Right-click the Crestview geodatabase and choose New > Feature Class. 
51Î Enter buildings for the name of the feature class. No alias is needed. 
51Î Leave the Type set to Polygon Features and click Next. 
51Î For the coordinate system, click the NAD 1983 State Plane Texas Central 
coordinate system from the Favorites folder. Click Next. 
51Î Accept the default XY Tolerance and resolution, and click Next.

Challenge Problem: Where Does the Space Go? 
A college campus has many types of space, but how is it all used? You will estimate the total area 
dedicated to different activities on your campus and present it using a map layout. 
Create a file geodatabase containing a feature class for building footprints, using an appropriate 
coordinate system. Include fields for the building names, the number of floors, and the primary 
use of the building (e.g., residential, academic, administration). Use whatever categories you 
think appropriate, but keep it to eight or fewer. 
Use the World Imagery layer in ArcGIS Online to digitize the buildings and enter the data in the 
attribute tables. Calculate the total area for each building, including all floors. Summarize the area 
by use category, both as total area in each use type and the percent of all campus floor space 
devoted to that use. Create an Item Description for the feature class. 
Create an informative map layout showing the imagery, the buildings, and the usage table. Use all 
you have learned to tell a good story. Remember to create a balanced layout with a clear visual

GIS Concepts 
About queries 
Queries are a fundamental tool in GIS, used in nearly every analysis. They serve a critical 
function in data exploration or in picking one’s way through a data set looking for patterns. They 
can also serve as the preparatory step of extracting certain features prior to performing another 
function. Some common applications involving queries include the following: 
 
Selecting features of interest. Queries can be used to search a table and to find which 
features meet certain criteria. How many houses currently for sale fall into my price 
range? Combined with the statistics function, this tool becomes powerful. What is the 
average cost of three-bedroom homes in this town? 
 
Exploring spatial patterns. Creating a map from selected features and examining their 
spatial distribution can be illuminating. Where do the wells with high values of 
contaminants occur? Do they show a pattern relative to known point source pollution 
emissions? Are they widely spaced or clustered together? 
 
Isolating features for more analysis. Select the largest earthquakes and find out how 
many of them lie close to volcanoes. Choose the states that have lost population and 
subject them to a multivariate statistical analysis of demographic data to find out why. 
 
Exploring spatial relationships. Which parcels lie in the floodplain? Which cities are 
close to a volcano? Where do roads cross unstable shale units? 
 
Creating raster queries. Although we have only discussed vector queries, cells of a raster 
can be queried also. Which cells have a slope greater than 10 degrees? Which cells show 
an increase in vegetative greenness as measured by satellite images taken in 1998 and 
1999? Where did land use change between 1970 and 2000?  
A query extracts features or records from a feature class or from a table and isolates them for 
further use, such as printing them, calculating statistics about them, editing them, graphing them, 
creating new files from them, or doing more queries on them. In the simplest kind of query, you 
look at a map or a table and use the mouse to select the desired record(s). An attribute query 
uses records in the attribute table to test a condition, such as finding all cities with population 
greater than 1 million people. Attribute queries are sometimes called aspatial queries because they 
do not require any information about location. A spatial query uses information about how 
features from two different layers are located with respect to each other. A spatial query might 
choose cities within a certain county, rivers that are within a state, or hospitals within 20 miles of 

Chapter 8 
232 
an airport. Attribute queries can be performed on either attribute tables or standalone tables. A 
spatial query requires a spatial data layer. Spatial and attribute queries may be combined, such as 
selecting cities with more than 50,000 people who are within 50 miles of an airport. The spatial 
and attribute queries must be performed separately but can be done in any order. 
Attribute queries 
In this method, the user specifies a certain condition based on fields in the attribute table and 
selects the records that meet the criteria, such as choosing all states with a population greater than 
5 million. We already introduced selecting by attributes from tables in Chapter 4. In this section, 
we extend selection to features and discuss more advanced selection options. 
Attribute queries test conditions between two or more attributes using logical operators, which 
include the familiar <, >, and = operators. The condition is written as an expression in a format 
called Structured Query Language (SQL), which is used by most major databases to perform 
selections. SQL expressions can be complex and sophisticated, or fairly simple. 
SELECT *FROM cities WHERE [POP1990] >= 500000 
SELECT *FROM counties WHERE [BEEFCOW_92] < [BEEFCOW_87]  
The SELECT *FROM and WHERE key words must be present as dictated by the syntax rules of 
SQL. The lowercase words (e.g., cities) give the name of the table from which to select, and the 
terms in double quotes or brackets are the field names. This syntax would be used in any SQL-
compliant database, so SQL is a transportable language. However, minor differences between 
database SQL varieties can be found, such as whether field names are enclosed in brackets or 
quotes, or nothing. 
Care must be taken when performing queries on numeric values depending on the type of field 
used to store the data. The = operator can only be used on integers, because a floating-point value 
is never exactly equal to an integer or specific decimal value. The expression NUM = 3 will not 
work on a floating-point field, and the expression NUM = 3.6 would never work at all. Queries 
on floating-point fields must use only the < or > operators. 
Boolean operators 
When a query includes more than one condition, the additional operators AND, OR, XOR, and 
NOT are needed. Consider the following queries with two conditions: 
SELECT *FROM accounts WHERE Cust = ‘COM’ AND Balance > 500 
SELECT *FROM accounts WHERE Cust = ‘COM’ OR Cust = ‘GOV’ 
SELECT *FROM accounts WHERE Balance > 500 AND Balance < 1500 
The first expression selects records from a customer accounts table that are held by commercial 
customers and have a balance over $500. The second expression finds the accounts held by 
commercial and governmental customers. The third expression finds accounts with balances 
between $500 and $1500. 
TIP: SQL requires that a field name appear in every condition of the expression, even if it is the 
same field. SQL will not correctly evaluate the expression Cust = ‘COM’ AND ‘GOV’.  

Queries 
233 
AND, OR, XOR, and NOT are called 
Boolean operators, and they evaluate two 
input conditions, which may be either true or 
false, and return a set of records meeting 
those conditions. Figure 8.1 represents these 
operators graphically using Venn diagrams. 
The large ellipse labeled T represents all the 
records in the table. Circle A represents the 
subset of records meeting condition A, circle 
B represents the subset meeting condition B, 
and the blue region indicates the records 
selected by the different Boolean operators. 
Examine the first expression in the preceding 
examples of Boolean operators. The first 
condition, Cust = ‘COM’, constitutes 
condition A; condition B would be Balance > 
500. A AND B finds the accounts for which 
both input conditions are true (commercial 
customers and balance over $500). If either 
condition is false, the record is not selected.  
The expression A OR B selects the records for which either condition is true, finding all the 
commercial customers and all the accounts with balances over $500 (commercial or not). A 
NOT B finds all the commercial accounts but excludes the ones with balances over $500, instead 
finding the commercial customers with balances under $500. The “exclusive or” operator XOR is 
not available for attribute queries in ArcGIS but is used in raster analysis. XOR finds instances 
when one or the other condition is true, but not both. 
The AND and OR operators are sometimes confused. In English we would say, “select the 
commercial and the governmental accounts” if we want both, and it seems natural to use the 
expression Cust = ‘COM’ AND Cust = ‘GOV’. However, this expression yields no records 
because a customer account cannot be both commercial and governmental at the same time. The 
OR operator should be used. 
The AND operator is used to find records within a numeric range. Consider the third expression, 
Balance > 500 AND Balance < 1500. If a record with Balance = 1000 is being considered, it 
would test true for both conditions and be selected. Using OR is incorrect; it would return ALL of 
the values instead of those inside the range. A record with Balance = 300 would test true for the 
second condition and so be included. A record with Balance = 3000 would test true for the first 
condition and be included. 
SQL can accept three or more Boolean conditions. Typically, parentheses must be used to enforce 
the correct order of evaluation. Compare these two expressions for selecting parcels: 
(LUCODE = 42 AND VALUE > 50000) OR SIZE > 50 
LUCODE = 42 AND (VALUE > 50000 OR SIZE > 50)

Chapter 8 
234 
In the first expression, all parcels > 50 hectares are chosen regardless of their zoning or value, and 
additional parcels are added if they are code = 42 and high in value. In the second expression, all 
of the parcels must have a zoning of 42 and can be either high in value or large in size. 
Searching for partial matches in text 
Sometimes queries based on text fields need to look for partial matches to a condition rather than 
a perfect match. Consider a table containing customer names. A user might wish to find all 
customers with the last name Smith. If the first and last names were stored in separate fields it 
would be easy, but if they were stored together in a single field it would be necessary to search 
for names that contain Smith as part of the full name. 
Also, when selecting strings, one must allow for extraneous spaces or inconsistencies in how data 
are entered. For example, the string Maple St with a space following St would not match the 
string Maple St or Maple St. or Maple Rd. Often databases have inconsistencies like this one, 
because it is difficult to enforce standard formats perfectly during data entry.  
To solve such problems, most GIS systems (and databases) provide an operator, such as LIKE or 
CONTAINS, that allows searches for a particular substring within another string. This operator is 
helpful in searching for Smith within a field containing both first and last names or Maple within 
a field of street addresses. LIKE searches for the specified set of characters within the field and 
returns any record that contains those characters. When using LIKE, a wild card character (% for 
shapefiles; * for geodatabases) is used to stand for other letters that may appear. Consider 
selecting cities based on their NAME field. The two queries 
NAME LIKE ‘New %’ (shapefile)  
NAME LIKE ‘New *’ (geodatabase)  
would select all cities beginning with the word New, such as New London and New Haven, but 
would not include Newcastle because there is no space in the latter. The expression 
NAME LIKE ‘%Smith%’ 
would return the customers with the name Smith. Notice the second % sign used in the 
expression. One might expect it to be superfluous, and often it would be, but it does ensure that 
an extraneous space character at the end of the name would not prevent it from being selected. 
Spatial queries 
Spatial queries are a powerful tool unique to GIS because they select based on spatial 
relationships, such as finding wells within five miles of a river or finding parcels inside a 
floodplain. A spatial selection uses two layers and one spatial condition. The features of the layer 
being selected are compared spatially with the features of the second layer to see which ones meet 
the criteria, and features meeting the criteria are selected.  
Panning and zooming techniques, already familiar to the reader, are actually a type of spatial 
query. Pans and zooms define a rectangle of interest based on x-y coordinates and ask that the 
software return all features that fall inside it. 
Because feature classes vary in precision and geometric accuracy, it can often happen that two 
objects that coincide in the real world will not match when their GIS coordinates are compared. It 
is helpful to be able to specify a search radius when evaluating a spatial condition so that the 
features need not exactly match.  

Queries 
235 
Consider the problem of selecting cities intersecting 
rivers. A city at a national scale is represented by a 
point, and a river by a generalized line. Even if the 
real-life city intersects a river, it would be only luck if 
the point occurred on the line feature representing the 
river (Fig. 8.2). Using the search radius provides some 
slack. If one assumes that a typical large city might be 
represented by a square 10 kilometers on a side, then 
setting the search radius to 5 kilometers might produce 
an acceptable result. Even so, one would probably 
encounter some false positive or false negative results.  
Users must always remember the difference between 
real-world entities and how they are represented by a 
GIS, and be prepared to mitigate problems that arise 
because of scale or accuracy issues. In this case, for 
example, the user might go ahead with the query, but then 
check each selected city using the online imagery to ensure that 
the correct relationship exists. 
Attribute queries test relationships between attributes using 
logical operators, such as <, >, or =. Spatial queries test for 
relationships using spatial operators, including containment, 
intersection, and proximity. Consider two feature classes, A 
and B. The spatial operators shown in Figure 8.3 test for the 
relationship of each feature in A to each feature in B and return 
the features from A that meet the criteria with respect to B. A 
complete description of each operator can be found in the 
ArcGIS Help. 
Containment tests whether one feature includes another. The 
test A completely contains B returns all features in A that 
fully surround the features in B. A contains B if B is 
inside A but they share a boundary. For example, both the 
yellow and blue counties in Figure 8.4 are contained by 
the state of Oregon, but only the blue counties are 
completely contained by the state. The are within and are 
completely within operators are the inverse of contain and 
completely contain. The have their centroid in operator 
tests whether the center of a feature in A lies inside a 
feature in B. 
Intersection is the most generic operator and returns any 
feature in A that touches, crosses, or overlaps any part of a 
feature in B. The are crossed by the boundary of operator 
is a special case of intersection that returns features in A that are crossed only by the boundary of 
features in B, such as the parcels that are crossed by the city limits. The most stringent condition 
is that the feature from A equals the feature from B exactly (i.e., they have precisely the same 
geometry). This corresponds to the operator are identical to.

Fig. 8.4. The blue counties are 
completely contained by Oregon.  
Fig. 8.2. Features for Minneapolis–St. 
Paul and the Mississippi River 

Chapter 8 
236 
Proximity tests how close features in A are to features in B. The most generic test, are within a 
distance of, selects features in A that are within a certain distance of B, such as returning all 
parcels within two miles of a school. Adjacency is a special case of proximity where the distance 
goes to zero and the boundaries of the features actually touch each other. These conditions are 
covered by the share a line segment with and touch the boundary of operators (which might also 
be considered to be intersection operators because the features touch). Figure 8.5 shows several 
examples of applying various operators to two different feature classes. 
TIP: A complete description of the different spatial operators with graphic examples can be 
found in the ArcGIS Help by searching in the Index for Select By Location, described. 
 
Sometimes a problem calls for testing spatial relationships using a subset of features rather than 
the entire layer. For example, a user might want to select cities within 50 miles of Interstate 80, 
rather than cities within 50 miles of any interstate. This procedure begins with an attribute query 
to isolate the desired interstate, I-80, and then a spatial query to select the cities.  
It must be kept in mind that spatial queries can only select or not select an entire feature. Consider 
Figure 8.5d, which shows the rivers that intersect Texas. Most of the rivers extend beyond the 
Texas border. If the within operator is used, then only rivers inside the state are selected (in this 
case, none of them). A different type of function is needed to extract only the portions of rivers 
that fall inside Texas. 
Extraction functions 
Extraction functions separate features of interest from a larger group. Some consider queries as 
one type of extraction. The functions clip and erase are able to extract both whole features and

portions of features based on a spatial boundary supplied by another feature class and save them 
in a new feature class. Clip and erase have the ability to truncate features when they cross a 
boundary, for example, a road crossing a state line. This ability differs from the Select By 
Location function, which must select (or not select) the entire feature. 
A clip works like a cookie cutter to truncate the features of one file based on the outline of 
another. In Figure 8.6, the county roads layer (gray lines) has been clipped by the land use layer 
(beige) to produce a shapefile of the roads that fall inside the city planning boundaries (red).  
The features being extracted come from the input layer. The feature class providing the boundary 
is called the clip layer. The clip layer must always be a polygon feature class, but the input layer 
may be points, lines, or polygons. Only the outside boundary of the clip layer is used for clipping; 
internal boundaries, if present, have no effect on the output.  
SKILL TIP: To temporarily clip features for display only, use the Data Frame tab of the Data 
Frame Properties menu (Layouts and Data Frames). 
Erase works in the opposite sense of a clip, keeping 
features that fall outside the erase layer and 
eliminating those inside. Given the same input and 
clip layers in Figure 8.6, an erase would keep the 
roads outside the city (gray) and eliminate the roads 
inside the city (red). Erase is only available to users 
with an ArcGIS Advanced license.  
Attributes from both truncated and nontruncated 
features in the input layer are preserved intact during a 
clip or an erase operation. However, attributes from 
the clip or erase layer are ignored. The result of a clip 
or erase is a copy of the input layer that now occupies 
a smaller region of interest. 
In clip and erase, any features crossing the boundary will be truncated, potentially changing areas, 
perimeters, or lengths of features. The geodatabase fields Shape_Area and Shape_Length are 
automatically updated, but user-defined area or length fields are not. A field named MILES or 
ACRES containing highway miles or tract acres, for example, would contain an incorrect value 
for any truncated feature. The lengths and areas of user-defined fields must be updated manually 
using the Calculate Geometry function. 
Rasters may also be clipped to a smaller area of interest defined by a feature class or another 
raster. The tools used for raster extraction are different from those designed for feature data, but 
they work in much the same fashion. 
About ArcGIS 
ArcMap offers three ways to select features. Interactive selection uses a pointer to select features 
on the screen. Attribute queries are performed using Select By Attributes. Spatial queries are 
executed using Select By Location. After a query, the selected features are highlighted in the 
map and in the table.

of a layer by the boundary of another.  

Chapter 8 
238 
Processing layers with selections 
ArcGIS follows an important rule when processing features or records in any of its functions or 
tools: after a query is performed and a subset of features or records is selected, any subsequent 
operation on that layer or table honors the selected set. You have already seen this rule in 
action. If you were to select the New England states and calculate statistics, only the New 
England states would be included. If you selected parcels in a floodplain and then exported the 
features to a new feature class, only the parcels in the floodplain would be exported. Once a query 
has been executed on a layer, the layer behaves as if the unselected features do not exist. 
By default, a layer has no query applied. In this state, all of the features are available for 
processing by a command. If a Statistics command were requested in this state, all of the features 
would be included in the calculations. Executing a query on a layer pushes it into a new state. The 
layer has a selection, and any function applied in ArcMap or in ArcToolbox will restrict the 
operation of the function to the selected features or records. 
Sometimes a user may execute a query that has proper syntax but yields no matching records. For 
example, it is possible to query for cities above 10,000 feet in elevation, but no cities actually 
meet the condition, and no features would be returned. When this happens, ArcGIS removes the 
query and sets the layer back to its default state with all features available. Essentially, it does not 
permit the user to execute a query that returns no records or features. 
Interactive selection 
In an interactive selection, you use the mouse to click on one or more 
objects in the map or table until you have all the desired records. For 
example, to get all the states beginning with A, you could sort the 
table by state name and then find and click on each record containing 
states starting with A. Or, if you wanted the states that have a Pacific 
Ocean coastline, you could look on the map, hold down the Shift key, 
and choose California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska.  
You can use graphics to select features, such as a box, a polygon, a 
circle, or a line. The Standard toolbar has several tools that select 
features by constructing a shape on-the-fly (Fig. 8.7). You can also 
select using an existing graphic, as shown in Figure 8.8. When 
selecting using a shape or graphic object, features only need to touch the object. Notice that three 
states are selected in Figure 8.8b, even though the rectangle does not completely enclose any of 
them. This default setting can be changed in the Selection options menu, however.  
The user can also control which 
layers may be selected using an 
interactive query. By default, all 
layers are selectable, so that the 
rectangle in Figure 8.8a has selected 
states, counties, rivers, roads, and 
more. The Selectable Layers option 
can turn off selection for one or 
more layers. In Figure 8.8b, the 
same rectangle has been used as 
before, but the user has set the 
selectable layers to states only.

TIP: The Selectable Layers option applies only to interactive selection with the mouse. It does 
not affect selecting by attributes or selecting by location using the menus. 
Selecting by attributes 
SQL expressions in ArcMap are 
constructed using the fields and the 
buttons in the Select By Attributes 
window (Fig. 8.9). The window 
automatically enters the first part of 
the expression (SELECT *FROM 
layer WHERE), so in subsequent 
examples we will drop this part and 
focus on the text to be entered. Notice 
a few additional options that can be 
used in this window.  
The check box allows the user to 
restrict the available layers to include 
only the ones set as selectable. By 
default this box is unchecked. 
The Method option controls what 
happens to previous selections when 
this one is executed. By default, a 
previous selection is discarded before 
the new one is applied. For 
information about the other options, 
see the later section “Choosing the 
selection method.” 
The Get Unique Values button adds 
values from the table to the window where the user may select them instead of typing them. This 
button is useful for text and categorical data when you don’t know the values to use. 
The Verify button checks an SQL expression before executing it.  
The Save and Load buttons store queries for use again later or to record what criteria were used, 
especially for long, complex queries with many conditions. Queries are saved in text files with 
the extension .exp and can be edited with a simple text editor.  
The Clear button erases old or invalid queries and starts again.  
TIP: Field names may have quotation marks, brackets, or nothing around them, depending on the 
type of data format and which version of ArcGIS is in use. The Select By Attributes window will 
always contain the proper syntax when a query is performed.

Chapter 8

Selecting by location 
The Select By Location window provides the 
means to set up a spatial query (Fig. 8.10). The 
target layer refers to the layer being selected, in 
this case Interstates. They will be the features 
highlighted after the query. The source layer is 
the one against which the target layer is being 
compared. The spatial selection method 
identifies the spatial operator used to compare 
the layers. This window is set up to select the 
interstates that intersect rivers. 
If the source layer has a query applied, you must 
choose whether to honor the selection. For 
example, if the user previously selected only the 
Mississippi River and checked the box to use the 
selected features, then only interstates crossing 
the Mississippi River would be selected. 
The search distance option provides a way to 
manage potential data accuracy issues.  
Choosing the selection method 
ArcMap has four methods for selecting features 
(Fig. 8.11). The methods may be specified in two 
places, from the main Selection menu when 
doing interactive selection or within the Select By 
Attributes or Select By Location window. 
The selection method applies to all three types of 
selections (interactive, selecting by attribute, and 
selecting by location). These methods give greater 
flexibility in defining selection sets and enable 
selection using multiple steps. When performed 
sequentially, complex expressions involving many 
criteria are often less confusing than when executed 
by entering a long expression full of ANDs and ORs 
and trying to figure out where to put the parentheses. 
Create New Selection selects the specified records regardless of what else is already selected, and 
it replaces any previous selection with the new selected records. For example, if you have 
selected green jelly beans and then choose to select red jelly beans, then you will only have red 
jelly beans selected. This method is the default. 
Add to Current Selection yields the records that fit the query in addition to any that are currently 
selected. Thus, if you have green jelly beans already selected and then select the red ones, then 
you will have both red and green jelly beans selected. Using this method is equivalent to doing a 
single selection step with a double expression using the OR operator, as when selecting beans 
where “color” = red OR “color” = green. 
Fig. 8.10. The Select By Location window 
Fig. 8.11. Selection methods 

Queries 
241 
Remove From Current Selection takes away the records that meet the selection criteria. If you 
already have red, green, and yellow jelly beans selected and you “select” green jelly beans, then 
you will have red and yellow jelly beans left. In this option, what you choose gets deleted from 
your selected set, so you must think backward on this one. It is equivalent to the NOT operator. 
Select From Current Selection chooses the records that fit the criteria from the already selected 
set. If you have red, green, and yellow jelly beans selected and choose to select the green ones, 
then you will have the green ones selected. If you choose to select orange ones, then you will end 
up with nothing because orange jelly beans were not in the original selection. Performing several 
selections in a row with this method is similar to performing a series of AND expressions. 
Imagine selecting earthquakes larger than 5.0 magnitude in 
Mineral County, Nevada (Fig. 8.12). This problem involves 
selecting by attribute and by location, so it occurs in two steps. 
First, use Select By Location to select the earthquakes within 
the county, using Create New Selection as the method (the 
green earthquakes in Fig. 8.12). Then use Select By Attributes 
to choose earthquakes with MAG > 5. However, using Create 
New Selection again in the second step would yield ALL 
earthquakes with MAG > 5, not just those in Mineral County. 
You need to specify Select From Current Selection in order to 
obtain the right earthquakes (circled ones). 
One other selection option, Switch Selection, replaces the 
selected set with the unselected records. In other words, if you 
have red, yellow, and green jelly beans available and the red 
ones are selected, and if you do a switch selection, then you 
will have green and yellow ones selected.  
Managing results from queries 
After a query, it is often useful to preserve the selected features for future use. Several options are 
available, both temporary to permanent. 
Creating a selection layer 
In Figure 8.13, the user selected the southeastern states 
and created a layer from the selected features, resulting 
in the new states selection layer shown above the 
original states layer. 
Creating a selection layer has several advantages. The 
layer can be given its own symbols and can be 
displayed separately from the original layer. The layer 
preserves the selected features for future reference and 
eliminates the risk of accidentally clearing the 
selection and having to redo it. Selection layers can be used to input the same set of features to 
several tools. They are helpful for viewing and recording intermediate results in a complex series 
of queries. The layer can also be saved as a layer file for use in other map documents. 
Creating a layer is the best solution when a selected set is intended for use within a single map 
document (although it can also be saved as a layer file for use in other map documents). It does 
Fig. 8.13. The South Atlantic states were 
selected and used to create a layer. 
Fig. 8.12. Using selection 
methods 

Chapter 8 
242 
not create multiple copies of the data, and edits to the source data will be updated automatically. 
It is the best solution when you need a temporary duplicate of features from your own data or 
from an organizational database shared by multiple users. 
Definition queries 
A definition query is a property of a layer. It is similar to a selection layer, except that instead of 
being created from a selected set, the query is performed in the layer properties window. Like 
selection layers, definition queries refer back to the original database rather than creating a copy 
of it, and they share the same advantages and disadvantages. 
Exporting data 
The export function saves a new feature class that contains only the selected features, and it is 
used when a permanent copy of the selection is needed. Because it creates a physical copy of the 
data, the link to the original feature class is broken. This can be a disadvantage, such as when an 
organizational database with frequent updates is the source. Changes made to the database will 
not be reflected in the exported file, which may eventually 
become out of date. On the other hand, it can be an advantage if 
the user needs to make changes but does not have write access 
to the original data. Exports may also be used to develop a new 
geodatabase based on a subset of existing data, such as 
developing a Texas geodatabase using feature classes from a 
US geodatabase, as we did in Chapter 2. 
The Selection window 
The Table of Contents has a viewing window that facilitates 
working with queries, the List By Selection window 
(Fig. 8.14). It reports which layers currently have selections 
applied and how many features are selected (Counties and 
Capitals), which layers are selectable but have no current 
selection applied (Rivers and Cities), and which layers are not 
available to interactive selection (States and Interstates). The dim 
layers are not currently turned on to be visible on the map. This 
window also allows the user to set selection options and access 
context menus for various selection options and functions.

Queries 
243 
Summary 
¾ Queries extract a subset of records or features from a data set based on a set of one or more 
conditions. 
¾ Extraction functions, such as clip and erase, separate features of interest based on a “cookie 
cutter” provided by a polygon layer and can truncate features at the cutter boundaries. 
Attributes are carried through without change. 
¾ Attribute queries extract features based on conditions from fields in the attribute table. They 
are written in SQL and use operators such as =, >, <, AND, and OR. Partial matches to text 
strings are evaluated with the LIKE operator. 
¾ Spatial queries extract features based on criteria of how two layers are spatially related, using 
spatial operators to test containment, intersection, or proximity/adjacency. 
¾ Data accuracy and scale issues may affect spatial queries and need to be considered in 
evaluating the methods and results. 
¾ ArcGIS uses only the selected features in a layer when a function, command, or tool is 
applied to the layer. If no query has been applied, all features are used. If a query has been 
applied, only the selected features are used.  
¾ An interactive query uses the Select Features tool and lets the user pick certain features by 
finding them on the screen and clicking them. Attribute queries are implemented using Select 
By Attributes, and spatial queries use Select By Location. 
¾ The Selectable Layers option restricts the operation of the Select Features tool to the 
specified layers. By default all layers are selectable. 
¾ Four selection methods add greater flexibility to queries. These methods include creating a 
new selection, adding to the current selection, removing from the current selection, and 
selecting from the current selection. 
¾ Creating a new layer from a set of selected features allows the selection to be stored, 
displayed, and passed on to tools or commands. Exporting creates a permanent copy.

1Î Click on the Select Features by Rectangle tool 
(on the Tools toolbar), and click on the star that 
represents Austin, Texas. 
SKILL TIP: Learn how to set and use bookmarks with 
map documents (ArcMap Basics). 
Your results may differ slightly, but you should now have 
several features selected, including Texas, one or more 
counties near the capital, and an interstate highway  
(Fig. 8.15). Any feature near the clicked point was added 
to the selected set regardless of which layer it came from. 
1Î Try clicking several other spots to see what gets selected. 
1Î Click and drag a box around the Dallas area 
and notice that anything in the box or anything 
that goes through the box is selected. 
You can control which layers are selectable by using the 
List By Selection window in the Table of Contents.

Dallas area. This time, only counties are selected. 
3Î Make Interstates the only selectable layer, and draw a box around Dallas again. 
Notice that when a new selection is made, the previous selection disappears. This behavior is 
called the selection method. By default, when a new selection is made, the previous one is 
discarded. The selection method can be changed. 
4Î Choose Selection > Interactive Selection Method > Add to Current Selection from 
the main menu bar. 
4Î Click the toggle switch to make the States layer selectable. 
4Î Click somewhere inside the state of Texas. It is added to the selected set. 
4Î Click on Oklahoma, the state north of Texas. It is added as well. 
4Î Click on one of the interstates running west out of Texas. Both the interstate and the 
state are selected. 
The Clear Layer Selection button in the Selection window clears only that layer. You can also 
clear the selection for all layers. 
4Î Click the Clear Selected Features button on the Tools toolbar, next to the Select 
Features by Rectangle Tool. 
4Î Choose Selection > Interactive Selection Method > Create New Selection from the 
main menu bar (returns to the default method). 
It’s time to experiment some more with interactive selection. 
5Î Choose Bookmarks > Michigan from the main menu.

6Î Add three more counties using the Shift-click method. 
6Î Now hold down Shift and click one of the counties that are already selected. It will 
be removed from the selected set. 
Imagine that you want to efficiently select all the counties in the northern portion of Michigan 
that lie between Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. 
7Î Click and drag a box that goes through as many counties as possible in northern 
Michigan (Fig. 8.17). Do it several times, if necessary, to get a good result. You will 
probably not be able to get all the counties, however.

The Interactive Selection Method makes it easier to add to 
an already selected group. 
7Î Choose Selection > Interactive Selection 
Method > Add to Current Selection. 
7Î Click on each of the remaining northern 
Michigan counties. Each one clicked becomes 
selected with the previous ones, without needing 
to hold down the Shift key. 
7Î Continue until all of the northern Michigan 
counties are selected. 
 
8Î Now add a few southern Michigan counties by 
drawing a box around them. 
8Î Choose Selection > Interactive Selection Method > Remove from Current Selection. 
8Î Click on or draw a box around the southern Michigan counties to remove them from 
the selected set. 
At this point, you should have all the northern counties selected and none of the southern ones 
(Fig. 8.17). Recall that the Statistics command shows information about the selected features. 
8Î Right-click the Counties layer and choose Open Attribute Table. 
8Î Right-click the POP2010 field and choose Statistics. 
1. How many counties are selected and what is the total number of people in them (in 2010)? 
_________________________________ 
8Î Close the Statistics box and the attribute table. 
Now let’s get back to testing the different selection methods. 
9Î Choose Selection > Interactive Selection Method > 
Select from Current Selection. 
9Î Use the Select Features by Rectangle tool to draw a 
box that encloses the northern peninsula, covering the 
area shown in Figure 8.18. Be sure to include some 
of the southern counties in the box. 
Notice how the northern counties touching the box were selected, but the southern counties were 
not because they were not already part of the selected set. Let’s use some other selection tools. 
9Î Set the Interactive Selection method to Create New Selection. 
9Î Click the tool to Clear Selected features on the Tools toolbar. 
 
10Î Click the Down arrow next to the Select Features by Rectangle tool and examine 
the other tools (Fig. 8.19).

10Î Click on the state capital, Lansing, and 
drag to make a circle (Fig. 8.19). Watch 
the radius measurement in the lower-left 
corner of the window and get it close to 
100,000 meters. Release the mouse button 
when you are satisfied with the circle. 
As you drew the circle, you may have noticed that 
the cursor snapped to Lansing and various county 
corners or edges. As in editing the snapping options 
are controlled by the Snapping toolbar. You can 
specify a circle of exact radius if you wish. 
11Î Click on Lansing again and drag to 
start the circle. 
11Î With the mouse button still down, press the letter r (for radius) on the keyboard. 
When the box appears you can let go of the mouse button. 
11Î Type the desired radius in the box, 100000 meters, and press Enter. 
 
12Î Choose the Select by Polygon tool.  
12Î Click around the lower peninsula to add the vertices of a polygon that touches all of 
the southern Michigan counties without including those from other states or the 
northern peninsula. Double-click to finish the polygon and make the selection. 
 
    Î Experiment with the other selection tools. When you are satisfied that you know 
how to use them, clear any selected features and go on with the tutorial. 
SKILL TIP: Learn to change the Selection Options, such as the color of highlighted features and 
whether features must pass through the rectangle/circle or be inside it (Queries). 
Selecting by attributes 
In previous chapters, you have done queries using the Options button in the table. Another 
method does not require opening the table. 
13Î Choose Bookmarks > USA from the main menu. 
13Î Right-click the Cities layer and choose Properties. Click the General tab. 
13Î Set the scale range to Show layer at all scales, and check the Visible box to make 
sure it is visible. Click OK. 
13Î Choose Selection > Select By Attributes from the main menu. 
The Select By Attributes window is identical to the one accessed by the Table Options menu, 
except that you must set the layer to select in the first drop-down box. 
14Î Use the drop-down box to choose Cities as the layer to select. 
14Î Confirm that the selection method is Create a new selection. 
14Î Enter the expression POP2007 > 1000000 (1 million).

TIP: Most users will find it faster to use the buttons and the windows of the query window rather 
than trying to type the expressions.  
14Î Click Apply and move the Select By Attributes window to show the Table of 
Contents, the map, and the window at the same time. 
2. How many cities in the United States had more than 1 million people in 2007? _______ 
One advantage of using this window is being able to query another layer from the same window. 
15Î Click the Select By Attributes window again to activate it. 
15Î Change the layer being selected to States. Keep the Create New Selection method. 
15Î Enter the expression to POP2010 > 5000000 (5 million). Click Apply. 
Notice that both cities and states are now selected. States and Cities are separate layers and are 
treated separately in this query window. Also note that the states were selected even though they 
were not a selectable layer. The selectable layer applies only to interactive selection. 
Now let’s try a selection with double criteria, all counties that lost population between 1990 and 
2000 and have more males than females. 
16Î Clear the selection using the Clear Selected Features button on the Tools toolbar. 
16Î Click the Select By Attributes box to activate it, if necessary. 
16Î Set the layer to Counties. 
16Î Enter the expression POP2010 < POP2000 AND MALES > FEMALES in the 
query box. Click Apply. 
3. How many counties with more males than females lost population between 2000 and 2010? 
_____ Where are they mainly located? __________________________________ 
Now from these we will select those counties that also have fewer than 10,000 people. Be careful 
to ensure that the new set of counties is pulled only from the currently selected ones. 
17Î In the Select By Attributes window, change the selection method to Select from 
current selection. 
17Î Click the Clear button to erase the old expression. 
17Î Enter the expression POP2010 < 10000. Click Apply.  
Watch as a few of the counties disappear from the selected set. 
4. How many counties remain selected? ________________ 
Springfield seems to be a popular name for cities. Let’s see how many there are. Text queries 
must have quotes around the value being selected.  
18Î Clear the selection for the Counties layer. 
18Î In the Select By Attributes window, change the layer to Cities. 

Chapter 8 
250 
18Î Change the Selection method back to Create a new selection.  
18Î Enter the expression NAME = ‘Springfield’. Click Apply. 
When selecting text, using the Get Unique Values field may be valuable and save some typing, 
but it tends to work best with categorical data. With nominal data like city names, there are so 
many different choices to scroll through that it is usually faster just to type the desired name. 
We might be curious how many cities end with the word City, such as Oklahoma City. The LIKE 
operator is used to search for text within a string instead of an exact match. 
19Î Clear the expression box and enter NAME LIKE ‘%City’. Click Apply. 
19Î Right-click the Cities layer in the Table of Contents and choose Open Table 
Showing Selected Features to check the results. Did you get what you expected? 
19Î Close the Table window when finished looking at it. 
5. How many city names begin with the word New? Be sure to include cities such as New 
Brunswick, but exclude cities like Newcastle. Check the names in the table. __________ 
TIP: The Clear Selected Features tool on the Tools toolbar and in the Selection menu clears the 
selection from ALL layers. To clear the selection for a single layer, use one of the context menus. 
19Î Clear all selections and close the Select By Attributes window. 
Selecting by location 
Next we will try selecting by location. First 
we will select all the counties that are adjacent 
to rivers. The features you want to select 
(Counties) are the target layer. 
20Î Click the Visibility icon to turn 
off the Cities layer. 
20Î Choose Selection > Select By 
Location, and adjust the window to 
show both the Selection window 
and the map. 
20Î In the first drop-down box, 
choose the selection method to 
select features from (Fig. 8.20). 
20Î Check Counties as the target 
layer. 
20Î Choose Rivers as the source 
layer. 
20Î Set the spatial selection method 
to intersect the source layer 
feature. 
20Î Click Apply and view the map.

6. How many counties in the United States are intersected by rivers?_____________ 
Next let’s select the counties that contain state capitals. 
21Î Change the source layer to Capitals and the operator to contain the source layer 
feature. Click Apply. 
7. Which of these counties containing capitals has the smallest 2010 population? ___________ 
What is the capital and which state is it in? _________________ 
Now let’s do an example with points and lines by selecting the cities close to interstate highways. 
21Î Click the Visibility icons (now gray) to turn on the Cities and the Interstates. 
 
22Î In the Select By Location window, change the target layer to Cities (be sure to 
uncheck Counties as well) and set the Source layer to Interstates. 
22Î Change the spatial selection to are within a distance of…(the source layer feature). 
22Î Set the search distance to 20 miles. Click Apply and view the results. 
TIP: Layers from a previous query will remain checked in this window until they are unchecked, 
so get in the habit of making sure only the desired layers are checked.  
8. How many US cities are within 20 miles of an interstate highway? ___________  
You might wonder what percentage of cities this is, because the map looks full of selected cities. 
To find out, you need to know how many cities are in the whole layer. 
23Î Right-click the Cities layer and open the attribute table. 
23Î Notice that the bottom of the table says (3321 out of 3557 Selected). 
23Î Use a handheld calculator, or the one on your computer, to calculate the percentage. 
9. What percentage of the cities is within 20 miles of an interstate? ___________  
TIP: Look carefully at less populous states, like Wyoming and Nevada. Sort the cities by 
ascending population and examine the CLASS field. Do you think this data set contains all cities 
in the United States? What impact might the completeness of this data set have on your analysis?  
In the previous example, we compared all the features in one layer to all the features in the other. 
You can also select features based on a subset, such as selecting the rivers that intersect Texas. 
We must select Texas first and then perform the Select By Location for the rivers. 
24Î Clear all selected features and close the Table window. 
24Î Turn off the visibility for Cities, Capitals, and Interstates. 
24Î Choose Selection > Interactive Selection Method > Create New Selection on the 
main menu bar. 
24Î Make States the only selectable layer. 
24Î Click the Select Features by Rectangle tool and select the state of Texas. 

Chapter 8 
252 
25Î Open the Select By Location window, if necessary. 
25Î Set the target layer to Rivers and the source layer to States. 
25Î To use only Texas, you must check the box to Use selected features. 
25Î Set the spatial selection method to intersect…(the source layer feature). Click OK. 
10. Which rivers intersect Texas? _____________________________________________ 
Spatial queries may also be performed within a single layer, using it both as the target and as the 
criterion layer. The features comprising the criteria must be selected first. For example, select all 
cities within 400 miles of Kansas City. 
26Î Clear all selected features. 
26Î Turn off the Rivers and turn on the Cities in the Table of Contents. 
26Î Open the Select By Attributes window and make sure the selection method is set to 
Create a new selection. 
26Î Make sure that the box to Only show selectable layers is unchecked. 
26Î Select Cities as the layer to select. 
26Î Clear the previous expression and enter NAME = ‘Kansas City’. Click OK. 
 
27Î Open the Select By Location window.  
27Î Set both the target and the source layer to Cities. 
27Î Because the target and source layers are the same, you must use the selected set. 
The box is checked and dimmed, so you cannot change it. 
27Î Change the spatial selection method to are within a distance of… and set the 
distance to 400 miles. Click OK. 
Attribute and location queries gain power when combined 
sequentially. Let’s select all the rivers that intersect states 
in the Mountain subregion. We do this by first selecting 
the mountain states using an attribute query and then 
selecting the rivers that intersect these states (Fig. 8.21).  
28Î Clear all selected features. Turn off Cities 
and turn on Rivers. 
28Î Choose Selection > Select By Attributes. 
28Î Set the layer to States, and enter the 
expression SUB_REGION = ‘Mountain’. 
(This is categorical data, so use the Get 
Unique Values button.) Click OK. 
 
29Î Open the Select By Location window. 
29Î Change the target layer to Rivers, the source layer to States, and the spatial 
selection method to intersect… 
29Î Check the Use selected features box. 
29Î Make sure that the Apply a search distance box is NOT checked. Click OK. 
Fig. 8.21. Rivers that cross the 
Mountain subregion 

Queries 
253 
Notice that many of the rivers extend far to the east to join the Mississippi (Fig. 8.21). Because 
they do pass through the mountain states, though, they are included. You could try selecting only 
the rivers that are within the mountain states instead. 
29Î Change the selection method to are within the source layer feature and click Apply. 
11. Now which rivers are selected? _________________________ 
Now hardly any rivers are selected. Ideally, you might like to select the portions of rivers that fall 
inside the mountain states. However, Select By Location only works on whole features. We will 
learn to extract portions of features later in the tutorial. 
Combining attribute and location queries can create sophisticated selections. Imagine that a 
meatpacking company is considering adding the capacity to slaughter bison and wants to survey 
customers between Pierre and Denver to see if the demand for bison meat justifies the added 
expense of handling these more difficult animals. The company decides to target the survey to 
counties that are within 300 miles of both Denver and Pierre and have more than 10,000 people.  
30Î Clear all the selected features and turn on the Capitals layer. 
30Î Right-click the Capitals layer in the Table of Contents and choose Properties.  
Click the Display tab. 
30Î Check the box to Show MapTips using the display expression. Click OK. 
 
30Î Right-click Capitals in the Table of Contents and choose Make This The Only 
Selectable Layer. 
30Î Click on the Select Features by Rectangle tool and select Denver in Colorado. 
30Î Open the Select By Location window and set it to select all Counties within  
300 miles of the selected features of Capitals (Denver). Click Apply. 
 
31Î Clear the selection on the Capitals layer only by right-clicking Capitals and 
choosing Clear Selected Features. 
31Î Choose the Select Features by Rectangle tool, hold down the Shift key, and select 
Pierre in South Dakota. If you forget to Shift, the county selection will be cleared.  
31Î In the Select By Location window, change the selection method to Select from the 
currently selected features in. Check the Use selected features box and click Apply. 
31Î Close the Select By Location window. 
TIP: You may encounter a bug in redrawing the selected features. If 
your selected set does not look like Figure 8.22, try using the Refresh 
button in the lower-left corner of the map window. 
At this point, a patch of counties between Denver and Pierre should 
show as selected (Fig. 8.22). Now we select from this set the counties 
with more than 10,000 people.  
32Î Open the Select By Attributes window. 
32Î Set the layer to select to Counties.  
Fig. 8.22. Counties

254 
32Î Set the selection method to Select from current 
selection. 
32Î Enter the expression POP2010 > 10000 and 
click OK. 
32Î Right-click Capitals and choose Clear Selected 
Features. The map should look similar to  
Figure 8.23. 
 
33Î Right-click the Counties layer and choose Selection > 
Create Layer from Selected Features.  
33Î Change the Table of Contents view to List by 
Drawing Order. 
33Î Name the new layer Packing Survey. Change the symbol, if necessary, to show up 
well against the background. 
33Î Clear all selected features. 
12. How many counties will be in the survey? ________What is the total number of people who 
live in these counties? _______________ 
Definition queries 
A definition query sets a property for a layer that temporarily restricts the layer to features 
meeting the condition. Imagine that you want to create a map showing only your home state. 
34Î Turn off all layers except States and Counties and zoom to your home state.  
34Î Open the layer properties for Counties and click the Definition Query tab. 
34Î Click the Query Builder button and enter the expression STATE_NAME = ‘your 
state name’.  
34Î After using Verify on the expression, click OK and OK. 
TIP: Be sure to Verify when doing definition queries. An error may cause the layer to disappear 
entirely, which may confuse you. 
35Î Open the properties for the States layer, click the Definition Query tab, and build a 
query to show only your home state. 
The state may appear rotated, especially if it is near the east or west coast. The coordinate 
system for the data frame is set to US Equidistant Conic, optimized for displaying the entire 
United States. For a state map, you should choose a coordinate system that is optimized for the 
state. 
36Î Right-click the Layers data frame name in the Table of Contents and choose 
Properties. Click the Coordinate System tab. 
36Î Expand the folders for Projected Coordinate Systems > State Plane > NAD 1983 
(Meters). 
36Î Choose one of the State Plane zones for your state. If a Central zone is listed, it will 
likely have the least distortion. However, any of them will work for now. 
Fig. 8.23. Target counties 
for the packing survey 

Queries 
255 
A definition query works for a quick map, but for an extended project it is more convenient to 
create a copy of the data with only the selected feature(s) in it. We’ll try that next, but first 
remove the definition queries on these layers.  
37Î Open the layer properties for States and click on the Definition Query tab. Delete 
the query expression and click OK. 
37Î Open the layer properties for Counties and delete its definition query also. 
Exporting data 
A layer with a definition query still refers back to the original feature class. It is a temporary 
exclusion of the features you don’t want. Export creates a permanent subset of a feature class that 
is stored in its own file. You could use it to build a geodatabase for your own state. You did this 
already in Chapter 2, but let’s do it again as a quick reminder of how it works. 
Note: If you still have your home state geodatabase from Chapter 2, you can store the new data in 
it, so skip creating another geodatabase and proceed to Step 39. 
38Î Open the Catalog tab, if necessary, and expand the gisclass folder. 
38Î Right-click the gisclass folder and choose New > Folder. Give the folder the name 
MyHome2 and click Enter. 
38Î Right-click the MyHome2 folder and choose New > File Geodatabase. Give the 
geodatabase the name of your state (omitting spaces, if any) and click Enter. 
  
39Î Use Select By Attributes to select the 
counties in your state. (Make sure that 
the selection method is reset to Create 
a new selection.) 
 
40Î Right-click the Counties layer and 
choose Data > Export Data. 
40Î Choose to export the Selected 
features (Fig. 8.24). 
40Î Fill the button to Use the same 
coordinate system as the data frame, so 
that the new file is stored in State Plane. 
40Î Click the Browse button. Make sure 
the Save as type is set to File and Personal Geodatabase feature classes. 
40Î Navigate inside the new geodatabase and name the feature class stcounties. Click 
Save and OK. 
40Î Click Yes to add the new feature class to the map. 
40Î Clear the selected features. 
Clipping data 
In previous chapters, you learned to assemble data for one state based on an attribute query, but 
we found that certain types of features, such as major roads, cannot be extracted that way because 
they do not belong to a single state. The Clip tool solves this problem. Let’s extract the Interstates 
in your home state, being careful to save it in a State Plane coordinate system.
Fig. 8.24. Exporting features 

Chapter 8 
256 
41Î Turn on the Interstates layer in the Table of Contents. 
41Î Open the ArcToolbox > Analysis Tools > Extract > Clip tool. 
41Î Set the Input Features to Interstates and the Clip Features to stcounties. 
41Î Save the output feature class as stinterstates.  
41Î Click the Environments button on the tool. Click on the Output Coordinates. Set it 
to As Specified Below and choose the correct State Plane Coordinate system. 
41Î Click OK to finish setting the Environments and OK to start the clip. 
 
42Î Symbolize the stinterstates layer with a more visible symbol that is different from 
the Interstates layer symbol. 
42Î Open the stinterstates attribute table. 
There are two user-defined length fields in this table: DIST_MILES and  DIST_KM. The lengths 
of some are likely to be incorrect because the features were truncated during the clip. We will 
recalculate them to be sure they are correct. The data frame is set to the State Plane coordinate 
system, which should preserve distance, so we can use it in the calculation. 
43Î Right-click the DIST_MILES field and choose Calculate Geometry. 
43Î Use the data frame coordinate system and set the units to miles. Click OK. 
43Î Recalculate the DIST_KM field as well, setting the units to kilometers. 
Clipping can also be used on rasters, but the 
process is a little more involved. We will obtain a 
coarse resolution DEM for our state geodatabase. 
44Î Search ArcGIS Online for gtopo30 
and find the 30 arc-second DEM of 
North America (layer package). Add it 
to the map. 
44Î Change the data frame coordinate 
system to match the namer_dem layer. 
 
45Î Turn off the Counties layer and 
symbolize the stcounties layer with the 
Hollow symbol. 
The DEM is in the GCS WGS 1984 coordinate 
system. Because clipping and projecting rasters is 
complex and computer-intensive, we will do it in 
two steps: clip first, then project. We set the data 
frame to match the raster to ensure that only the 
clip will be done in the first step. 
46Î Open the Search window, if 
necessary, and dock the Search window 
on the ArcMap window.

Queries 
257 
46Î Type clip raster in the search box and click the Search button. 
46Î Click the Clip (Data Management) tool to open it and verify that it is the tool for 
rasters (Fig. 8.25). 
 
47Î Set the input raster to namer_dem. 
47Î Set the output extent to stcounties. 
47Î Check the box to Use Input Features for Clipping Geometry, so that the DEM will 
be clipped at the state boundary instead of the bounding rectangle. 
47Î Save the output raster in your MyHome2 geodatabase as statedem. 
47Î Uncheck the box to Maintain Clipping Extent to avoid resampling the raster now. 
Click OK. 
Recall that resampling impacts the accuracy of a raster. We will have to resample the raster when 
projecting it, and we don’t want to resample it twice if we don’t have to. 
48Î Remove the original namer_dem layer package and set the data frame coordinate 
system back to State Plane. 
 
49Î Type project raster in the Search window and open the Project Raster (Data 
Management) tool. 
49Î Enter statedem as the input raster. 
49Î Save the output raster in MyHome2 as dem900m. 
49Î Set the output coordinate system (use the Layers folder) to your State Plane 
coordinate system. A datum transformation will be entered automatically. 
49Î Set the resampling technique to bilinear, since elevation is continuous data. 
49Î Enter 900 as the new X and Y output cell sizes. Click OK. 
 
50Î Remove all the layers 
except the three for your 
home state. 
50Î Symbolize dem900m 
nicely and display it with the 
counties and interstates 
(Fig. 8.26). 
50Î Use Save As to save this 
map as new map document 
in the MyHome2 folder. 
 
51Î Update the Item Description for dem900m, giving an original source citation and 
describing the two operations performed on it (clip and project). 
This is the end of the tutorial.

10. Congress has awarded FEMA $10 million to help large cities prepare for earthquakes. The 
cities that qualify for the funding must have more than 500,000 people and be less than 50 
miles from one or more earthquakes exceeding 6.0 in magnitude. The bill stipulates that the 
funding is to be divided among the qualified cities in proportion to their population. Create a 
feature class that contains only the qualified cities and has a table field listing the amount of 
funding to be given to each. Capture a view of the table showing the city, population, and 
funding amount. 
Challenge Problem  
Use the clip tools to add more data to your home state geodatabase. Search the Internet and/or 
ArcGIS Online to find at least two more line feature classes and one raster at a suitable scale for 
your home state. Keep in mind that rasters can get very large, so try to find something with a 
resolution of about 500–1000 m or 30 arc seconds. Make sure that the final data sets are in your 
home state coordinate system, and be sure to create an Item Description with a citation for each 
one. Create a map layout showing your new data, including your citations.

Chapter 9. Spatial Joins 
Objectives

¾ Learning to solve problems with spatial joins 
Mastering the Concepts 
GIS Concepts 
What is a spatial join? 
Chapter 6 presented attribute joins performed on tables—for example, joining information in an 
earthquake statistics table to a map of states to create a graduated color map of damages. This join 
is based on a common field, the state name, and has a cardinality of one-to-one. The join results 
in combining the two tables as if they were one table. The destination table receives the 
information from the source table. 
A spatial join is similar to an attribute join, except that, instead of using a common field to 
decide which rows in the table match, the locations of the spatial features are used. The spatial 
join uses either a containment criterion (one feature inside the other) or a proximity criterion 
(one feature close to another). 
Like attribute joins, spatial joins 
designate a source feature class and a 
destination feature class. Unlike an 
attribute join, which appends the 
source attributes to the existing 
destination table, a spatial join 
creates a new feature class. It retains 
the features from the destination 
layer and appends the attribute 
information from the source layer 
(Fig. 9.1). The two original feature 
classes are unaffected. The 
destination feature class determines 
the type of features in the output 
feature class. If an airports feature 
class is joined to a cities feature class 
with cities as the destination, then the 
output feature class contains cities. 
Distance joins 
A distance join uses a proximity criterion to link one feature and its attributes to another based 
on whether one feature is closest to another. Figure 9.2a shows the details of the join between 
airports and cities diagrammed in Figure 9.1. The source feature class, airports, has been joined to 
the destination feature class, cities. The output feature class contains cities. Each city has been 
given the attribute information from the airport that lies closest to it, and a new field has been 
cities

added to record the distance. The attribute table contains two parts, the original data from cities 
and the joined data from airports. So McNary Field is the closest airport to Adair Village, and 
Eastern Oregon Regional is the closest airport to Adams. 
Two maps have been created from the new joined layer. Figure 9.2b is a unique values map based on 
the airport name, so each dot gets a color based on the closest airport. The colors indicate which cities 
are served by each airport, assuming that people will drive to the closest one. The second map is a 
graduated symbol map based on 
the distance field, with the larger 
circles indicating greater distance 
from the airport (Fig. 9.2c). The 
units of the distance field are 
always given in the stored 
coordinate system units. These 
data are in the Oregon Statewide 
Lambert coordinate system, and 
the units are meters. 
Inside joins 
In an inside join, the records of 
the feature classes are joined 
based on whether one feature is 
inside another (wholly or partly). 
Figure 9.3 shows a point layer 
containing septic system 
locations and a polygon layer 
showing geological units. 
Imagine that a community has a 
porous geological aquifer that 
provides the city water supplies. 
Fig. 9.3. A spatial join gives each septic system the 
attributes of the geology polygon within which it lies.

Spatial Joins 
261 
Extensive development outside city limits has caused the city concern about potential 
contamination of the aquifer by faulty septic systems. Assessing the threat requires identifying the 
number of septic systems that occur in the outcrop area of the aquifer. 
A spatial join solves this problem perfectly. Septics is the destination layer and becomes the output 
feature class. The geology attributes of the polygon containing the septic system is appended to the 
output septics table. As shown in Figure 9.3, septic system 800 falls inside the Terrace Deposits (Qt) 
polygon in the geology layer, and septic systems 836 and 839 fall inside the Navarro Group (Knb) 
unit. The output table will be helpful in assessing how many septics fall on sensitive geological units. 
Spatial joins may be performed on any two spatial data layers. A user can join points to points, 
polygons to polygons, lines to points, and nearly any combination of the three types of data. The 
output layer will always have the same feature type as the destination layer. 
Cardinality 
Cardinality is an important issue for spatial joins, just as it is for attribute joins. Because records 
in tables are being matched together, the Rule of Joining must be fulfilled in spatial joins also. 
Each feature record in the destination table must have one and only one matching record in the 
source table. This condition is met if the cardinality of destination to source is one-to-one or 
many-to-one. In attribute joins, we had to use a relate if the Rule of Joining was not fulfilled. 
With spatial joins, we must use a summarized join if we encounter a one-to-many relationship. 
Recall that the Summarize function calculates statistics for groups of records in a table. It uses one 
field to divide the records into groups, and then it calculates statistics for other fields for each group. In 
a summarized join, each feature in the destination layer is matched to many features in the source. 
Statistics are calculated for that group of features, and the result is appended to the feature record. 
In Figure 9.2, imagine reversing the join so that 
airports is the destination layer and cities is the 
source layer. Each airport has many cities that are 
closer to it than to any other airport. Instead of 
attaching the single closest city, a summarized 
join finds all of the cities closer to the airport and 
calculates one or more statistics, for example, the 
sum of the city populations. Then for each airport 
we would know the total number of people being 
served by that airport (i.e., the sum of the 
populations of the cities that are closer to that 
airport than to any other). Figure 9.4a shows the 
output table of the joined layer with a Count field 
representing the number of cities and the 
Sum_POP_98 field representing the total people 
in those cities. So Portland International has 69 
cities close to it with a total of 870,598 people. 
Figure 9.4b shows a proportional symbol map 
based on the Sum_POP_98 field to represent the 
total potential population served by the airport. 
This type of problem, estimating usage of airports by surrounding populations, is known as an 
allocation problem, in which provision of services is being assessed. In truth, spatial joins are not

output table; (b) map based on sum of 
population served

Chapter 9 
262 
the best approach—people select airports based on more than distance: cost, schedules, and so on. 
More sophisticated techniques for solving allocation and logistics problems are available but 
require the purchase of the Network Analyst extension. 
Analysis problems typically involve making assumptions about the forces at work, and nearly 
always these assumptions are simplifications of the actual situation. We made an assumption that 
people choose the closest airport based on distance, and although it is true in a general way, it is 
not the whole story. That does not make the analysis wrong—airports close to many people are 
going to be serving many more passengers than airports in a lower population area—but it is 
important that we are cognizant of the assumptions being made in any analysis and remain 
sensitive to how they may impact the results. In this case, we have ignored tourist/business air 
traffic as well as the fact that many people will drive further to get a better deal. Thus we are 
probably overestimating use at the smaller airports and underestimating use at the large ones. 
Types of spatial joins 
Spatial joins fall into four main types according to the cardinality of the relationship between 
the joined layers (simple or summarized) and the choice of spatial criteria (inside or distance). 
Figure 9.5 shows a matrix of the four possible combinations. A simple join may be used 
whenever the cardinality is one-to-one or many-to-one so that the Rule of Joining is 
maintained. In a one-to-many relationship, a summarized join must be employed.

In which county is 
each school?

How many schools are

Spatial Joins 
263 
Consider the simple join types first. In Figure 9.5a, schools and counties are being joined, with 
schools as the destination layer (some call it the target layer). The output layer contains schools, 
and each school will have the attributes of the county it falls inside. With the output layer, one 
could answer the question “In which county does a particular school lie?” This example is a 
simple inside join. The previous example of the septic systems is also a simple inside join. 
If, however, the destination layer is reversed, the cardinality of counties to schools is one-to-many, 
and a simple join is not possible. A summarized join may be employed in this case. The 
summarized join groups the schools together based on which county they are in and generates a 
single record of statistics for the group. This single summarized school record can then be appended 
to the matching county in the destination table. A Count field is always generated, containing the 
total number of schools in each county. Figure 9.5b shows this as a summarized inside join.  
Distance joins also come in simple or summarized varieties. Consider evaluating the desirability 
of several hotels based on their distance to local tourist attractions, using a layer of hotels and a 
layer of attractions with the yearly number of visitors in each one. What is the cardinality of this 
relationship? This question seems confusing because there are several hotel sites and many 
attractions. In a distance join, it is the question that dictates the cardinality. If we ask “Which 
attraction is closest to the hotel?” in order to find out whether that attraction has a large visitor 
pool, we have specified a one-to-one criterion because only one attraction can be closest to each 
hotel. A simple distance join suffices, and each hotel appears in the output table along with the 
attributes of the attraction closest to it and the distance between them. In Figure 9.5c, the circles 
connect each hotel site with its closest attraction. 
A different question may be asked: “How many tourist attractions are closer to this hotel site than 
they are to any other?” In this case, we are interested in evaluating the richness of choice of 
attractions for each hotel or perhaps the total combined visitor pool from all the closest 
attractions. In this case, each hotel is connected with many attractions, as shown in Figure 9.5d, 
and summary statistics for the group, such as the number of attractions and the sum of the visitor 
pools, may be added to the record for each site. This would be a summarized distance join.  
Feature geometry and spatial joins 
The available join types will depend in part on the geometry of the features being joined. When 
joining points to points, for example, an inside join type does not apply. Thus, only two options 
are available when joining points to points, simple distance, or summarized distance. Table 9.1 
lists all of the possible geometry combinations and the join types that can be applied to each. (In 
this table we break the convention of putting the destination first in order to match the

Let us examine some other combinations 
of geometry types. Consider this 
problem: Many counties in South 
Dakota do not have a hospital. The state 
emergency planning office wishes to 
know the hospital closest to each county 
and how far away it is. They require a 
list of counties, each with the closest 
hospital attached to it. Thus, counties is 
the destination layer, and hospitals is the 
source layer. According to Table 9.1, 
joining points to polygons requires either

hospitals to counties.

a summarized inside or a simple distance join. In this case, the simple distance join is the correct 
choice. After the join, each county has a field indicating the name of the closest hospital (Fig. 9.6) 
as well as the distance from the county to the hospital. When the hospital is inside the county, the 
distance of zero is assigned. 
Table 9.1. Join types are available for each combination of feature geometries in a spatial join. 
The second feature type is the destination layer in each case.

In Figure 9.7, a unique values map was created based on the hospital name. In the northeast part 
of the state, the purple counties are closest to the hospital in the purple area, the green counties to 
the hospital in the green area, and so on. The long, hatchet-shaped county in western South 
Dakota (Pennington County) has several hospitals. Since all three lie inside Pennington, they all 
have a distance of zero, and Pennington’s closest hospital was arbitrarily assigned based on which 
hospital was found in the table first. The lighter pink counties in the central part of the state were 
assigned to a different hospital in Pennington County and appear in a different color. The map in 
Figure 9.8 shows each county displayed according to its distance to the closest hospital. 
 
Figure 9.9 demonstrates an example of joining points to lines to predict the susceptibility of streams to 
contamination from septic systems. In this analysis, we make the assumption that, the more septic 
systems that are close to the stream, the greater the stream’s susceptibility to contamination. The point 
locations represent the centers of one-mile by one-mile 
sections, and the size of the symbol indicates the number of 
septic systems in the section. We need to join each stream 
line to the closest septic systems, so streams is the destination 
layer. Joining points to lines requires either a simple distance 
join or a summarized distance join. In this case, a 
summarized distance join, which sums the total septic 
systems that are closest to each stream, is correct. The map 
shows the results: the thicker the line symbol of the stream, 
the more septic systems are closest to that stream and the 
higher the susceptibility of the stream to contamination. 
Coordinate systems and distance joins 
Distance joins should always be performed on layers with 
projected coordinate systems that preserve distance. If a 
join is performed on a layer with a geographic coordinate 
system (GCS) and units of decimal degrees, two problems 
arise. First, the distances reported in the table will be in 
decimal degrees. Degrees cannot be easily converted into 
miles or kilometers because the conversion factor changes 
with latitude. Second, the result could be invalid. The 
distance algorithm relies on the relative x-y coordinates of the features to calculate distances and 
assumes a Cartesian coordinate system to do so. Degrees of latitude and longitude are spherical 
coordinates, not Cartesian, and the relative distances calculated may be incorrect.

Figure 9.10 shows two cases of a summarized distance join of tourist attractions to hotels. In 
Figure 9.10a, the join was done with both layers in a GCS. Notice that the three attractions in the 
northeast corner were assigned to Hotel C based on their distance from it in decimal degrees. In 
Figure 9.10b, both layers were projected to UTM prior to joining, and the attractions were 
assigned instead to Hotel B. Since a UTM projection preserves distance within the zone, we know 
that the second example gives the correct spatial distances between the attractions and the hotels 
and is the valid result. Notice that the spatial distribution of attractions is elongated in 
Figure 9.10a, as a result of being displayed in a GCS. 
It is not sufficient to set the data frame to a projected coordinate system; the layers themselves 
must be projected. Furthermore, the projected coordinate system should be one that preserves 
distance over the region of analysis, such as UTM, State Plane, Equidistant Conic, and so on. 
Otherwise, the distance analysis may again be incorrect.  
About ArcGIS 
Spatial joins are performed on two input feature classes and result in a new feature class that may 
be stored as a shapefile or geodatabase feature class. The original inputs are unchanged. Spatial 
joins are initiated using the same method as attribute joins. 
Choosing the join type 
As in an attribute join, the process begins by deciding which layer is the destination. The user 
right-clicks the destination layer, chooses to join the data based on spatial location (Fig. 9.11), 
and enters the desired source layer.  
The join menu always offers two ways to decide how to match the fields, taken from the four 
types shown in Figure 9.5. Consider joining schools to counties, with counties as the destination 
layer as described in Figure 9.5a. Each county can have more than one school, so it is a one-to-
many join. There are two options in the window based on the choices listed in Table 9.1. The user 
must choose between them based on the desired result (Fig. 9.11). 
For this example, Option 1 offers an inside summarized join, which gives each county a 
statistical summary of the attributes of all the schools inside it, such as the total number of 
schools or the sum of the students. Option 2 specifies that a simple distance join should be

are incorrectly joined to Hotel C (purple stars) when the input feature classes have a GCS.

performed, which gives each 
county the attributes of the 
closest school. In this case, the 
second option is nonsensical. All 
of the schools are inside the 
county and would be assigned a 
distance of zero, so it avails little 
to find the “closest” one. In this 
example, the summarized join is 
the appropriate choice. 
Figure 9.12 shows the result of the 
join. The resulting layer is a map 
of counties with the original 
county attributes plus a field called 
Count_ that contains the number of 
schools in the county. From this 
field, the graduated color map was 
created, showing the number of schools in each 
county. When summarizing, the user can choose 
from several statistics—minimum, maximum, 
average, and so on. All numeric attributes in the 
source table are summarized using the chosen 
statistics and are placed in the output table. String 
fields cannot be summed or averaged, so they are 
not included in the output table. 
Setting up a spatial join 
Performing the spatial join itself is a simple 
process. However, determining that a spatial join 
is required and identifying the destination table 
and the type of join can challenge beginners. This 
section presents a series of questions to be 
answered when setting up a spatial join to help 
produce the correct result. Too many novices 
simply try random combinations until they hit on 
the right one—this process is designed to give the 
right answer the first time. 
When faced with a suspected spatial join problem, first make a simple sketch of the relationships 
between the layers to be joined. Then answer this series of questions, designed to lead to the 
correct solution: 
What should the final output layer or table look like? 
Which is the destination layer? 
Should a distance join or an inside join be used? 
What is the cardinality of the join? 
Should a simple join or a summarized join be used?

counties, one can create a graduated color 
map showing the number of schools in 
each county.

Let us demonstrate this process by using the problem of estimating stream susceptibility to 
contamination from septic systems, as shown in Figure 9.9. Recall that each point represents a 
section and stores the total number of septic systems in the section. First sketch the problem and 
then go on to the questions. 
What should the final output layer/table look like? The desired result is a layer of streams. In 
the attribute table, each stream must be assigned the total number of septic systems that are closer 
to it than to any other stream. Imagine the fields in the table, with the stream followed by the sum 
of the number of septic systems. Once the output is envisioned, it is usually easy to see which 
feature class is the destination layer. 
Which is the destination layer? The features in the output layer are always the same features as 
those in the destination layer. If streams is chosen as the destination, then the output layer will 
contain streams. If the septics layer is chosen, then the output layer will contain septic points. 
Imagining our output table again, we see that what we really want is streams, each of which has 
septic information assigned to it. Thus, streams is the destination layer.  
Should a distance join or an inside join be used? Since we’re looking for septic systems closest 
to each stream, this is clearly a distance join. 
What is the cardinality of the join? Assignment of cardinality depends on the destination layer, in 
this case streams, so consider the relationship between streams and the septic systems. Since one 
stream can have multiple septic points closer to it than to any other stream, this is a one-to-many 
cardinality. 
Should a simple join or a summarized join be used? Since the cardinality is one-to-many, a 
simple join cannot work. Because the goal is to sum all the septic systems closest to the streams, 
rather than simply finding the single closest septic to the stream, a summarized join is indicated, 
with Sum as the statistic. 
Now that the questions are answered, the problem setup becomes clear: We need to do a 
summarized distance join with streams as the destination layer and septics as the source layer. 
Even experienced users may find that following this suggested procedure when setting up a join 
makes it easier to find the right approach. In the next few examples, we will apply this process to 
set up and solve three different spatial join problems. 
Problem 1 
Number of earthquake deaths in congressional districts 
Imagine that a representative from one of the congressional districts in California is sponsoring 
legislation to provide earthquake emergency planning funds and is looking for support for the 
bill. She is planning to throw a big party and invite all of the reps from districts with a significant 
number of earthquake deaths. She asks one staffer, who is a GIS specialist, to draft a list of names 
for the invitation list. The staffer might approach the problem as follows, using the data in the 
mgisdata folder. 
STOP! Write the answers to the questions and then read on to see if you analyzed the problem correctly.

Spatial Joins 
269 
Should a distance join or an inside join be used? __________________________ 
What is the cardinality of this join? ____________________________________ 
Should a simple join or a summarized join be used? _______________________ 
The earthquake table has a state attribute but none for congressional district. The only way to 
associate the number of earthquakes with districts is to perform a spatial join. The goal is a table 
of districts with a field containing the number of earthquake deaths for each one. Thus, the 
districts will be the destination layer. The relationship between districts and earthquakes is 
potentially one-to-many, so a simple join is out of the question. Since the staffer wants to know 
the total deaths from quakes in each district, the summarize option will be the best, and the proper 
statistic is Sum. We will do a summarized inside join, with districts as the destination layer.  
Figure 9.13 shows the spatial join window filled out 
for this problem, as well as the resulting table. After  
performing the join, the staffer uses an attribute query 
to select all of the districts that have had 10 or more 
earthquake-related deaths. The table and the map 
show the selected records from the query—many of 
the districts are in California, as one might expect. 
Finding only 12 districts on the list and knowing that 
the boss wants a BIG party, the staffer then uses 
Select By Attributes to find all the districts that have 
had ANY earthquake deaths. This brings the total up 
to 29 districts. The guest list should be even bigger, 
so the staffer decides to use Select By Location to 
also select any districts that touch the districts with 
earthquake deaths (Fig. 9.14). This brings the guest 
list to 91, and the staffer can make up the invitations.

Problem 2 
Pollution risk of rivers based on county populations 
Imagine that Lindsey must do an analysis estimating the risk of pollution to rivers in the United 
States. She has no detailed information of the sources and types of pollutants, but she can make 
use of the observation that, generally speaking, large numbers of people are generally correlated 
with high risks of pollution. She decides to use the population of counties as a proxy for the 
pollution risk. For each river, she wants to find the total number of people living in counties that 
intersect the river.  
STOP! Write the answers to the questions and then read on to see if you analyzed the problem correctly.  
What should the output layer/table look like? _____________________________ 
Which is the destination layer? _______________________________________ 
Should a distance join or an inside join be used? __________________________ 
What is the cardinality of this join? ____________________________________ 
Should a simple join or a summarized join be used? _______________________ 
The final output layer should contain rivers, with a table listing each river and the total population 
of counties adjacent to that river. Thus, rivers must be the destination layer. Since the counties 
must actually touch the river, this is an inside join rather than a distance join. The cardinality is 
one-to-many, since one river can have many counties touching it. An inside summarized join 
must be used with rivers as the destination layer, and the SUM statistic should be requested. 
Figure 9.15 shows the spatial join window filled out for the join. The output table shows the river 
name, the number of counties adjacent to it, and the sum of each numeric field, including the 
POP2000 and POP2010 fields. The figure also shows a graduated symbol map based on the 
Sum_POP2010 field, in which the width of the river represents the total county population living 
adjacent to it. Notice that ALL of the numeric fields are summed during the join, not just the 
POP2000 field. One drawback to summarized spatial joins is that the chosen statistic is applied to 
all the fields, yielding potentially large attribute tables. 
Fig. 9.15. Estimating pollution risk for rivers based on adjacent county populations 

Spatial Joins 
271 
Also note that the field names appear truncated. Because field names are limited to 13 characters, 
prefixing each with “Sum_” may crop other characters from the end. Notice that the POP2000 
field has become Sum_POP200, the POP00_SQMI field has become Sum_POP00_, and so on. 
The shorter names may cause confusion, and it may be necessary to go back to the original table 
of the source layer to find out which field is which. The fields will be in the same order as the 
original. An alias can then be created, if desired, to avoid further confusion. 
Problem 3 
Closest volcano to a city 
In this final example, imagine that a professor who specializes in volcanoes has built a web site 
about them. He would like to put a table on his web site so that schoolchildren all over the United 
States can enter the name of the city they live in and get an information page about the volcano 
that is closest to them. Since the professor knows nothing about GIS, his graduate student, Cody, 
gets to make the table.  
STOP! Write the answers to the questions and then read on to see if you analyzed the problem 
correctly.  
What should the output layer/table look like? _____________________________ 
Which is the destination layer? _______________________________________ 
Should a distance join or an inside join be used? __________________________ 
What is the cardinality of this join? ____________________________________ 
Should a simple join or a summarized join be used? _______________________ 
The final goal is a cities layer with fields indicating the closest volcano and the distance to it. 
Thus, Cody realizes, Cities is the destination table, and a distance join to the volcanoes layer will 
provide the necessary information. Because the closest volcano is the target, this is a simple 
distance join (only one volcano can be the closest one).  
Figure 9.16 shows the spatial join window settings to produce this analysis and the result of the 
spatial join. The table shows the city name, the state abbreviation, the volcano name, the place 
where the volcano is located, the volcano elevation and type, and the distance to the volcano.  
Fig. 9.16. Table showing each city and its closest 
volcano, with the distance to the volcano in meters: 
graduated color map is based on the Distance field. 

Chapter 9 
272 
Notice the field name volcanoes_NAME in the output table. It happens that the Cities layer has a 
NAME field, and so does the volcanoes layer. The output table cannot have two fields with the 
same name, so during the join the repeated names are automatically converted into unique names. 
The Cities name field remains NAME, but the Volcanoes name field becomes NAME_1. In 
addition, an alias is created, volcanoes_NAME. It is the alias that is being displayed in the table, 
but if the table is set to show actual field names, then the NAME_1 field will be shown instead. 
Also notice that the distance from Boone, Iowa, to the Dotsero volcano in Colorado is over one 
million. These units are clearly not miles or kilometers. In fact, they are meters, indicating that 
the coordinate system of the original data is stored with units of meters. 
TIP: Always check the original coordinate system after a join to be sure you know the units for 
the distance values. Also, remember that distance joins should be performed only on projected 
coordinate systems that preserve distance, or the results will be invalid. 
Summary 
¾ A spatial join combines the records of two feature tables based on the location of the features. 
A new feature class is created by a spatial join. 
¾ An inside join uses the criterion that one feature falls inside another or, in the case of points 
and lines, on top of each other. A distance join matches the destination layer feature to the 
record of the closest feature in the source layer. A distance field reporting the distance 
between the joined features is added to the table. 
¾ A simple join may be used whenever the cardinality of the layers is one-to-one or many-to-one. 
A summarized join generates summary statistics for all the source features matching the 
destination features and is used when the cardinality is one-to-many or many-to-many.  
¾ Four types of spatial joins exist based on the combination of the criterion and the cardinality 
of the relationship: simple inside joins, simple distance joins, summarized inside joins, and 
summarized distance joins. 
¾ Distance measurements are reported in map units of the input layers.  
¾ Distance joins should only be performed with layers having projected coordinate systems that 
do not distort distances. Using layers with a geographic coordinate system may yield 
incorrect results.  
¾ In the joined table, fields with identical names will be renamed in the output file so that all 
field names are unique, such as NAME to NAME_1. Usually, the source field is renamed. 
¾ Use the following series of questions to help you set up a spatial join properly:

The map currently shows the geology and water wells for Austin, TX. For each well, we would 
like to know the geological unit associated with it at the surface (i.e., for each well, we want to 
know the geological unit that the point falls inside). STOP and think it through.  
The desired output is a table of wells containing a field with the geological unit. Therefore, the 
Wells layer is the destination. A well can fall into only one geology polygon, making it a one-to-
one cardinality. Therefore, a simple inside spatial join is indicated.

Look for the second OBJECTID after 
any spatial join to find where the 
appended information begins. 
Locate the UNIT_NAME field at the very end of the new table, containing the geological unit.

4Î Find the aquifer_code field from the wells part of the table and examine the entries. 
Look for codes containing “GLR”. 
The aquifer code field indicates the formation that supplies water to the well at an opening some 
depth underground. The GLR aquifer codes refer to the Glen Rose Limestone, which is a 
prominent aquifer (water-bearing rock) in this part of the country. Wells often get water from a 
different rock formation than is exposed at the surface. Let’s find out how many of the wells ON 
the Glen Rose Limestone actually get water from the Glen Rose Limestone.

The deepest well in this group lies within the Glen Rose Limestone both at the surface and at 
depth, giving us an estimate of the aquifer thickness. The well_depth field gives the depth in feet.

6Î Turn off the wellgeology layer and turn on the Creeks layer. 
6Î Right-click the Creeks layer and choose Zoom to Layer. 
The geological substrate of a creek affects its connection with groundwater. A creek on porous 
limestone will lose more water to the rock than a creek on clay. We assigned geology 
information to wells using a spatial join; we can also do it for creeks. STOP and think through 
the problem. 
We want a table containing creeks with a field indicating the geological unit that the creek is on. 
Thus, Creeks is the destination feature class. A simple inside join is called for.  
7Î Right-click the Creeks layer and choose Joins and Relates > Join. 
7Î Set the source layer to Geology. 
7Î Use the simple join option. (Each line will be given the attributes of the polygon that 
it falls completely inside.)

9Î Turn on the Geology layer again. 

Spatial Joins

The gray creeks cross geological contacts. We assumed 
that each creek was within a single geological unit, but 
we can see that it is not true in all cases. When a creek 
crossed a boundary, no unit was joined to it, and it 
received a <Null> value in the attribute table for the 
geology attributes. 
9Î Open the creekgeology attribute table. 
Examine the fields, particularly the 
UNIT_NAME field containing the geology. 
9Î Right-click the UNIT_NAME field and 
choose Sort Ascending to see the <Null> 
values. Then close the Table window. 
One weakness of inside spatial joins is that they join 
only when features fall completely inside other features. In Chapter 10, we will learn about the 
Intersect tool, which is similar to a join but can split the features when they cross. Let’s take a 
sneak peek ahead. 
10Î Open the ArcToolbox > Analysis Tools > Overlay > Intersect tool. 
10Î Click the dropdown button for input features and select Creeks. 
10Î Click the dropdown button again and select Geology. 
10Î Name the output feature class creekgeolint and save it in chap9results. 
 
11Î Symbolize the creekgeolint layer as you did creekgeology. Compare the two layers 
and also examine the tables. 
The creekgeolint layer has no <Null> values in its table. Creeks that crossed a geologic unit 
boundary have been split into pieces, and the geologic unit has been assigned to each piece. 
A summarized inside join 
A simple join is appropriate for a one-to-one or a many-to-one cardinality. A summarized join is 
needed for a one-to-many cardinality. Think about a watershed, the collection area for surface 
water. Runoff that comes from a watershed with many people is likely to have more pollutants 
than runoff from a watershed with fewer people. Let’s analyze which watersheds in the Austin 
area are at greatest risk for polluted runoff. 
12Î Remove the creekgeology, creekgeolint, and the wellgeology layers from the map. 
They are still saved in the chap9results geodatabase if you want them later. 
12Î Turn off the Geology and Creeks layers. 
12Î Turn on the Watersheds and Block Population layers. 
12Î Right-click the Block Population layer and choose Zoom to Layer. 
12Î Open the table for the Block Population layer. 
Block Population contains points representing the centroids of block groups, the smallest unit for 
which the Census Bureau summarizes population data. Each point represents numbers of people 
and households. We will use these points to determine the number of people in each watershed. 
STOP and think it through. 
Fig. 9.18. Creeks displayed by 
geological unit 

Chapter 9 
278 
This time we want to have a list of watersheds with the total number of people in it. Watersheds 
is the destination layer. One watershed can have many block points in it, so the relationship is 
one-to-many. A summarized inside join must be used. Since we want to know the total number of 
people, we need to request the Sum statistic. 
13Î Close the Table window. 
13Î Right-click the Watersheds layer and choose Joins and Relates > Join. 
13Î Set Block Population as the layer to join to. 
13Î Choose the option to summarize the points inside the polygons and check the box 
for the Sum statistic. 
13Î Name the output feature class watershedpop and put it in the chap9results 
geodatabase. Click OK. 
 
14Î Drag the watershedpop layer just below the Block Population layer. 
14Î Open the watershedpop table and examine the fields on the far right. 
14Î Close the Table window. 
The Count field records how many block points were found in the watershed. The fields prefixed 
with “Sum_” show the totals for each of the numeric fields in the source table. Sum_POP2000 
tells us the total number of people living in each watershed.  
15Î Open the symbology properties for the 
watershedpop layer and create a Quantities: 
Graduated color map based on the 
Sum_POP2000 field and the Jenks classification. 
15Î The population values are influenced by 
polygon area, so normalize the classification 
using the Shape_Area field.  
15Î Symbolize it with a monochromatic color 
ramp and click OK. 
15Î Name the layer Watershed Hazard.  
The map should look similar to Figure 9.19. Note that the 
watersheds extend beyond the block population data. If this 
were a real project, you would need to address this issue by 
dropping polygons with incomplete data or expanding the 
block group data to the full extent of the watersheds. 
16Î Turn off the Watershed Hazard, Watersheds, and Block Population layers. 
16Î Turn on the Streets layer. Add the police_districts feature class from the 
mgisdata\Austin\Austin\Administrative feature dataset. 
Imagine that the city has been reviewing its police department staffing levels. To help assess 
needs, it would be helpful to know the total length of streets for which each district is responsible. 
You have been given the task of finding this information. STOP and think it through.

Spatial Joins 
279 
You want to produce a list of the police districts, each of which has the total street length. Thus, 
the districts are the destination layer. Each district contains many streets, so the cardinality is 
one-to-many. A summarized inside join must be used, with Sum as the statistic. First, notice 
that many streets do not fall in any of the districts. You can reduce the processing time for the 
spatial join by first selecting only the streets that are within the districts. 
17Î Open the Select By Location window. 
17Î Set the target layer to Streets and the source layer to police_districts. 
17Î Set the spatial selection method to are within. Click OK. 
Now when you do the spatial join, only the selected streets will be used, saving time. You will 
also have fewer streets with unassigned districts. 
18Î Right-click the police_districts layer and choose Joins and Relates > Join. 
18Î Set the source layer to Streets and choose the summarized option. Check the Sum 
statistic. 
18Î Place the result in chap9results and name it policestreets. 
18Î Click OK and wait. This join may take several minutes. 
 
19Î Clear the selection and turn off the Streets layer. 
19Î Open the policestreets table. The original Streets layer contained a field called 
MILES with the length of the street. Find the Sum_MILES field in the joined table. 
19Î Close the Table window. 
 
20Î Create a graduated color map of the 
policestreets layer based on the Sum_MILES 
field. For this map, it is best to classify the 
distances using a defined interval of 50 miles. 
The downtown districts are smaller and have fewer miles of 
road than the outlying districts (Fig. 9.20). The next step 
might be to analyze the block population for each district to 
see if they are balanced in that way instead. We will leave 
that as an exercise, and move on.  
21Î Turn off the police_districts layer. 
21Î Remove the policestreets layer from the map 
document. 
Simple distance joins 
Distance joins combine records for features that are closest to each other. Consider the problem of 
post office usage. One might assume that, generally, people will go to the closest post office. For 
each street, it would be nice to know which post office to go to. STOP and think it through. 
We want a list of streets with a field indicating the closest post office, so Streets is the destination 
layer. Since only one post office can be “closest,” this is a one-to-one relationship. A simple 
distance join is appropriate.

Chapter 9

22Î Turn on the Streets and Post Office layers. 
22Î Right-click the Streets layer and choose Joins and Relates > Join. 
22Î Set Post Office as the layer to be joined. 
22Î Choose the simple join option, where Each 
line will be given the attributes of the point 
that is closest to it. 
22Î Name the output file streetpost and save 
it in chap9results. Click OK. 
 
23Î Open the streetpost attribute table and 
examine all of the fields. Find the field that 
contains the names of the different post offices. 
23Î Close the Table window. 
3. Which field contains the post office names? _______ 
23Î Create a unique values map of the 
streetpost layer based on the FACILITY_N 
field, so that each street is symbolized by the 
post office it is closest to. Use thick lines to see 
the colors better (Fig. 9.21). 
A distance join also creates a distance field. In this case it 
shows how far each street lies from the nearest post office 
(as the bird flies, not driving distance). The units will 
match whatever the storage units are for the feature class 
coordinate system. 
4. What are the coordinate system and units for the 
streetpost feature class?  _______________________ 
5. How many streets are more than two miles from a post 
office (as in Fig. 9.22)? _________________ 
24Î Clear the selected features. 
24Î Create a graduated color map of the 
streetpost layer based on the Distance field, 
using a thicker line and a monochromatic color 
ramp (Fig. 9.23). 
 
25Î Remove the streetpost layer and turn off the 
Post Office layer. 
25Î Add the trailheads and restrooms feature 
classes from the Parks feature dataset in the 
Austin geodatabase.  
Before people start a hike, or after they finish, they like to 
find a restroom. Imagine that a hiking club wants to 
analyze the proximity of trailheads to restrooms and make

recommendations for adding more restrooms to serve hikers. STOP and think through the 
problem. 
The club needs a list of trailheads that includes the distance of each trailhead to the closest restroom. 
Thus, trail_heads is the destination layer. There can be only one closest restroom to a trailhead, so 
the cardinality is one-to-one, and a simple distance join will suffice. 
26Î Right-click the trail_heads layer and choose Joins and Relates > Join. 
26Î Set restrooms as the layer to join.  
26Î Choose the simple join option to give each point the attributes of the closest point. 
26Î Name the output feature class trailrest and save it in chap9results. Click OK.  
The club is most concerned about the trailheads that are more than 1000 feet from a restroom. 
You will create a map that will help the club identify optimum locations for new restrooms. 
27Î Open the trailrest table and examine the fields. Find the Distance field. 
27Î Use Select By Attributes to select the trailheads that are more than 1000 feet from a 
restroom. Close the Table window. 
27Î Right-click the trailrest layer and choose Selection > Create Layer From Selected 
Features. Name it Problem Trails. 
27Î Clear the selected features. 
 
28Î Add the parks and the trails feature classes from the Parks feature dataset. 
28Î Symbolize the parks in a light green color and the trails as a dark green thick line. 
 
29Î Click on the restrooms layer symbol to open the Symbol Selector. 
29Î Type restroom in the search box at the top and click the Search button. Choose 
the symbol you prefer and make it about 16 pt. 
29Î Open the restrooms layer properties, click the General tab, and set the minimum 
scale to 1:60,000. 
 
30Î Remove the trailrest and trail_heads layers. 
30Î Create a graduated color map of the Problem Trails layer based on distance from the 
restrooms. The values are skewed, so use the Jenks classification method. Make the 
symbol slightly larger so you can better see the colors (Fig. 9.24a).  
30Î Zoom in to an area with clusters of Problem Trails to test the map (Fig. 9.24b). 
Let’s save this work as a group layer file for future use by the club. 
31Î Click on the Problem Trails layer name to highlight it. Hold down the Ctrl-key and 
click the restrooms, parks, and trails layers. 
31Î Right-click one of the highlighted layers and choose Group. 
31Î Name the new group layer Restroom Map. 
31Î Right-click the Restroom Map group layer and choose Save As Layer File. Save it 
in the Austin folder as Restroom Map.lyr. 

Chapter 9

32Î Turn off the Restroom Map group layer and collapse it. 
32Î Right-click the City Limit layer and zoom to it. 
Summarized distance joins 
A simple distance join asks “Which feature is closest?” A summarized distance join is needed to 
address the question “How many features are closer to one location than they are to another?” 
Imagine that the Department of Recreation is applying for a grant to renovate its recreation 
centers. For guidance, they would like to know the potential population served by each center, 
making the assumption that most people will go to the closest center. The Block population data 
will provide the base data set for the analysis. STOP and think it through. 
We want a list of the recreation centers with a field containing the total number of people who are 
closest to it. Centers is the destination layer, and the cardinality is one-to-many. A summarized 
distance join will be used.  
33Î Add the facilities feature class from the Facilities feature dataset in the Austin 
geodatabase. 
33Î Use Select By Attributes to select recreation centers using the expression 
FACILITY_T = ‘RECREATION CENTER’. 
33Î Right-click the facilities layer and choose Selection > Create Layer from Selected 
Features. Name the layer Rec Centers. 
33Î Remove the facilities layer. 
TIP: Creating intermediate selection layers is often a smart thing to do. It provides a visual test of 
your query, and it saves the selection in case a later mistake requires redoing the analysis. Give 
each selection layer a descriptive name, to avoid confusion later. 
34Î Right-click the Rec Centers layer and choose Joins and Relates > Join. 
34Î Set Block Population as the layer to join. 
34Î Choose the summarized option. You want to know the total number of people, so 
check the Sum statistic.

34Î The default save folder was changed to Austin when you saved the Restroom Map 
layer file. Click the folder Browse button to change it back. 
34Î Change the Save as type to File and Personal Geodatabase feature classes. 
34Î Navigate inside the chap9results geodatabase. Name the output recpop and click 
Save and OK. 
 
35Î Open the recpop table and examine the Sum fields. 
35Î Examine the statistics for the Sum_POP2000 field. 
6. What are the minimum, maximum, and average numbers of people served by the recreation 
centers? _________________________________________________________ 
Clearly there are large discrepancies in the potential usage of each center. What is the spatial 
distribution of this potential usage?  
35Î Close the Statistics and Table windows. 
35Î Create a graduated symbol map of the 
recpop layer based on the Sum_POP2000 
field. Use Jenks Natural Breaks. 
The map is interesting (Fig. 9.25). Small centers clustered 
in the downtown area appear to compete with one another, 
while the outlying centers draw large groups over larger 
distances. The department decides to adopt a strategy to 
turn the downtown cluster into special-interest centers that 
may draw more people, while expanding standard 
activities in the outlying centers. Of course, the final plan 
would take into account many more issues, such as 
parking, public transportation, and current facilities and 
usage. 
Meanwhile, another group is concerned about the effects of population on stream pollution. The 
number of people living close to a stream impacts the likelihood for the stream to be affected by 
pesticides and other pollutants. This group wants to characterize the basic threat to each stream by 
summing the population closer to that stream than to any other. STOP and think it through. 
We want a feature class of streams that contains a field with the total population close to it, so 
streams are the destination layer. The cardinality is one-to-many, so a summarized distance join 
with the Sum statistic is needed. 
36Î Add the named_creeks feature class from the Environmental feature dataset in the 
Austin geodatabase.  
36Î Turn off all layers except the City Limit and named_creeks layers. 
36Î Turn on the Block Population layer, but change the color to Gray 10%. 
 
37Î Right-click the named_creeks layer and choose Joins and Relates > Join.

38Î Sort the Sum_POP2000 field in descending order. 
7. Which three creeks have the highest risk based on total population? 
____________________________________________________________ 
38Î Rename the creekpop layer Population Load. 
38Î Create a graduated color map for the Population Load layer based on the 
Sum_POP2000 field. The data are fairly skewed, so use Jenks Natural Breaks. 
38Î Use a monchromatic color ramp and thick lines so the colors show (Fig. 9.26a). 
It may occur to you that the longer creeks are naturally exposed to more people. You decide to 
create a hazard index based on the number of people per unit length of stream. 
39Î Click the Table Options menu and choose Add Field. 
39Î Name the field HazIndex and set the field type to Float. Click OK. 
39Î Right-click the empty HazIndex field and choose Field Calculator. Enter the 
formula Sum_POP2000 / Shape_Length and click OK. 
39Î Examine the HazIndex field and sort in descending order. 
8. Which three creeks have the highest risk based on the index? 
____________________________________________________________ 
Notice that most of the creeks have an index near or below 1, but the top three are in the range of 
3–6. Notice the Shape_Length field also. These high-index creeks have very short lengths, and 
they are probably scraps of creek remaining after they were clipped to the city boundary. These 
Fig. 9.26. Maps showing pollution hazard of Austin creeks based on (a) population load 
and (b) hazard index 
(a) 
(b) 

Spatial Joins 
285 
high-index values are probably a fluke and should be eliminated from consideration. To avoid 
having them skew the map, you will exclude short creeks from the map. 
40Î Close the Table window. 
40Î Right-click the Population Load layer and choose Copy. 
40Î Right-click the Layers data frame name and choose Paste Layer(s). Rename the 
new layer Hazard Index. 
 
41Î Open the layer properties for the Hazard Index layer. 
41Î Click the Definition Query tab and enter the expression Shape_Length > 1000. 
Click Apply so that it takes effect before you set the symbols. 
41Î Click the Symbology tab and create a graduated color map based on the HazIndex 
field using the same symbols as the Population Load layer (Fig. 9.26b). Click OK. 
As you can see, there are some differences between the two approaches for evaluating pollution 
hazards. (Some color differences may also be due to differences in the Jenks breakout of the 
different values.) Which model do you think might be a more realistic approach? 
A hydrologist who specializes in surface water quality would probably question both models, 
because she knows that surface water runoff is controlled more by elevation than by distance, and 
that a watershed provides a better unit for summing the population impacts. You already did this 
using a summarized inside join. 
42Î Turn on the Watershed Hazard layer and open its properties. 
42Î On the Display tab, set the transparency to 50%. 
42Î Turn off the Block Population layer. 
42Î Compare the Population Load and Hazard Index maps visually against the 
Watershed Hazard map by turning the upper one on and off several times. 
Which of the two creek-based methods appears to agree better with the watershed method? 
Overall, do the three methods agree on which watersheds and creeks bear closer scrutiny? 
This analysis brings up an important consideration in GIS analysis. A problem may be 
approached several ways, using different models based on different assumptions. All three 
approaches had potential problems. In the watershed-based model, the population data set did not 
cover the entire watershed area. In the creek-based analysis, the fundamental assumption that 
distance was an appropriate predictor of influence is flawed, and short creeks resulting from data 
problems could have impacted the results. Each approach yielded similar, but not the same, 
results. Three important lessons should be gleaned from this example. 
First, data issues and problems affect nearly all analysis procedures. You cannot mitigate all 
issues, but it is important to be aware of what they are, as well as what impacts they might have. 
Second, the fundamental assumptions behind a model should be the best available. The 
watershed model had the most realistic assumption about water flow and is the best of the three 
models (or would be if the population data covered all the watersheds). 
Third, do not push the results of a model beyond its limits. Even the watershed model neglects 
important variables. For example, industrial areas produce different amounts and types of 

Chapter 9 
286 
pollutants than residential or farming areas do. Stream flow impacts the ability of a stream to 
dilute pollutants. Although we mapped five hazard levels, whether the model can realistically 
separate the hazard into many categories with distinct boundaries is questionable. 
In the long run, the best you can say about this analysis is that it highlights potential problem 
areas that would benefit from further scrutiny. Toward that goal, all three models performed 
equally well. This observation yields a fourth lesson, that the most detailed and accurate model 
is not always necessary to achieve the objective. 
Data quality issues with spatial joins 
Now we will do one more polygon-to-polygon join to demonstrate some issues to consider when 
joining. We have a census tracts layer for Austin that has a county FIPS code, but no county 
name. We would like to do a spatial join of counties to the tracts in order to provide a field with 
the county name. This is a simple inside join with a many-to-one cardinality. 
43Î Collapse the legends of all of the layers in the data frame and turn them off. 
43Î Add the tracts and the counties feature classes from the Administrative feature 
dataset of the Austin geodatabase. 
43Î Put tracts above counties in the Table of Contents and zoom to the full extent. 
 
44Î Right-click the tracts layer and choose Joins and Relates > Join. 
44Î Set the join layer to counties. 
44Î Choose the simple join option. 
44Î Name the output tractcounty and place it in the chap9results geodatabase. 
 
45Î Change the counties symbol to a hollow shade with 2-pt. purple borders, and place 
it above the new tractcounty layer in the Table of Contents. 
45Î Create a unique values map for the tractcounty layer, using the joined COUNTY 
field containing the county names (it is near the end of the table). 
Notice that the unique values legend has a <Null> entry, 
and many of the tracts are symbolized with this value. 
What happened? 
46Î Open the tractcounty table and scroll far to 
the right where the COUNTY field is. 
46Î Scroll down to examine all the rows in the 
table. 
You can see many <Null> fields in the table. These tracts 
were not matched to a county at all. This fact is puzzling, 
because, from the map, the tracts appear inside the 
counties and should have been matched with one. 
However, the map shows that the affected tracts all share a 
boundary with the county (Fig. 9.27).  
46Î Close the Table window and zoom in to the area shown in the black box in Figure 9.27. 
Fig. 9.27. The orange tracts 
received no match during the join. 

Spatial Joins 
287 
46Î Switch to the List by Selection view in the Table of Contents and make tractcounty 
the only selectable layer. 
46Î Click the Select Features by Rectangle tool and click on one of the tracts that share 
the county border. Click several more. 
It becomes apparent that the tract boundary and the county 
boundary are not exactly the same (Fig. 9.28). In the real world, a 
tract always falls inside a county. In this GIS data set, the tracts 
and counties came from two different sources, and as a result 
their boundaries do not coincide. To be joined, the tract must fall 
within the county. Even the small discrepancies seen here are 
sufficient to prevent the county from being matched to the tract 
during the join. 
How well the GIS data features reflect relationships in the real 
world is called logical consistency. In this case, the data sets are 
not logically consistent because the data features with 
mismatched boundaries do not reflect the real-world boundaries, 
which are identical.  
TIP: Always keep in mind that data accuracy and logical consistency issues may have an impact 
on an analysis. Be alert for potential problems.

Use the data in the mgisdata\Austin\Austin geodatabase to answer the following questions. 
  1. Give the name of the watershed in Austin that contains the most wells. How many wells does 
it contain? Which watersheds have the deepest and shallowest average well depths? 
  2. How many wells are there in the WATERFRONT zoning code in Austin? Use the O_NAME

  5. An elementary school pool fun day is planned. If each school goes to the closest pool to it, 
which pool will have the most schools attending? Create a map that would be helpful to 
planners in reassigning schools to less crowded pools. (Note: You must export the elementary 
school selection to a new feature class before joining, because the distance join does not 
honor the selected set. This may be a bug.) 
  6. Examine the table from Exercise 5 closely, and you will find a problem with your initial 
analysis. What is it? What would you need to change to get a better result? 
  7. Which post office potentially serves the greatest number of people, based on the block group 
population data? Which one serves the least? (Note: The post office locations are one of the

  9. Assuming that an airport’s service area includes all of the cities that are closer to it than to any 
other airport, determine how many cities each airport serves. Which airport serves the most 
cities? How many cities? Which serves the most people? How many people? Why does the 
Sum_POP2000 field contain negative values? 
10. A boating club would like to know which parks in Oregon have the best access to lakes. Find 
the number of lakes and total lake area in each park. Which park(s) have the most lakes and 
how many? Which park has the greatest area of lakes? Examine parks with only one lake. The 
sum of the area fields for these lakes keeps repeating the same few numbers. Explain why.

Challenge Problem 
Imagine that a national body recommends the minimal staffing levels for a police district as one 
officer for every 1000 people plus one officer for every 25 miles of road. The police department 
has asked you to calculate the minimum recommended staffing levels for each district. Create a 
table showing the largest 15 to 20 districts with the district name, the population, the miles of 
road, and the number of officers. Place the table on a supporting map layout (screen capture is the 
easiest method), along with a graduated color map of population and labels for the staff numbers.

Mastering the Concepts 
GIS Concepts 
Over the years many procedures have accumulated for characterizing spatial relationships within 
and between spatial features. Functions can find areas shared by two or more conditions, evaluate 
distances, extract or erase areas of interest, merge similar features together, examine distance 
relationships between points, and more. The entire enterprise of GIS, including gathering the 
data, putting them in digital form, designing the geodatabase, managing the data, and creating 
maps, is justified by the ability to apply these tools to extract information that might be difficult 
to obtain any other way. GIS shares many capabilities with CAD systems and database software, 
but spatial analysis gives GIS unique power to get the most out of map and attribute data.  
Chapter 9 discussed spatial joins as one way to analyze spatial relationships. In this chapter, we’ll 
learn more tools to solve spatial problems. Often two or more functions will be strung together to 
solve a specific problem, a practice called geoprocessing. We’ll begin with a general discussion 
of spatial functions and then investigate how these functions are implemented within ArcGIS. 
Map overlay 
Map overlay combines two layers to create a new output feature class containing information 
from both of the inputs. In Figure 10.1, the polygons from a geology layer and from a land 
ownership layer have been combined to produce a new set of polygons. Each new polygon has

been given the attributes of the originals, and each contains information about both geology and 
ownership for the same feature. The output layer might be useful for selecting areas containing 
certain gem-bearing rock formations on public land that would be suitable for mineral hunting. 
Overlay functions fall into two categories, those that do not combine attributes and those that do. 
Functions that do not combine attributes, also called extraction functions, include clip and erase, 
which were discussed in Chapter 8. In extraction, the input features retain their attributes, but the 
attributes of the clip or erase boundary layer are ignored. The two functions that combine 
attributes include intersect and union. Union preserves all of the features from both inputs; 
intersect only keeps features common to both inputs. 
Overlay with attributes 
The intersect and union functions are related to 
spatial joins in that they correlate features based on 
their spatial relationships to each other. However, 
spatial joins fail when spatial features do not 
overlap exactly (recall the creeks and geology 
example from Chapter 9). Consider the map of 
roads and land use shown in Figure 10.2. The state 
government has requested a report of the total miles 
of road falling into each land use category. At first 
glance, a spatial join might be considered to 
generate this information; by joining the land use 
polygons to the roads, one might expect to get a 
field showing the land use type each road crosses.  
However, the single selected road, highlighted in Figure 10.2, crosses three different land use 
classes. How would a land use type be assigned in this case? If one used the completely within 
join option, no land use class would be assigned for the road because it does not lie entirely inside 
a polygon. A summarized join would do no good because a nominal data type such as land use 
class can’t be averaged. The ideal solution would split the road into three sections and assign the 
land use to each section, and this is what overlay functions do, thereby enforcing a one-to-one 
relationship between features and enabling a perfect correspondence when joining the tables. In 
Figure 10.2, the original single road is now three sections, and each segment in the output table 
(Fig. 10.3) is assigned the attributes of the land use polygon containing it.  
Map overlay with attributes occurs in two forms. Union combines two polygon layers, keeping 
all areas and merging the attributes for both layers. Intersect also merges the attributes but retains 
only the areas common to both layers, and may be performed with points, lines, or polygons.

overlay, each new 
road segment retains 
its original attributes 
and receives the land 
use code and other 
attributes of the 
polygon in which it 
falls.

A union creates all possible polygons from the combination of features in two polygon layers. 
Figure 10.4 shows a union performed on geology and slope class layers to create a landslide 
hazard map. Landslide risk depends primarily on two factors, the strength of the geological units 
(sandstones are less susceptible to sliding than shales) and the slope. The lighter areas in the slope 
class map have lower slopes, and the dark areas have higher slopes. A union produces a new 
feature class with new polygons, each of which possesses the original attributes of its parents. 
The new feature class can then be evaluated for the various combinations of slope and geology 
that may constitute a landslide hazard. 
The intersect operation with two polygon layers is similar to a union, except that it only keeps 
the polygon areas that are shared by both input layers. This function provides a way to find out 
where two or more conditions hold simultaneously, the foundation of a class of problems known 
as suitability analysis—evaluating a landscape to find which areas best serve a given purpose 
based on a set of factors. For example, one could find the potential habitat for a species with 
specific environmental requirements. 
Imagine that a rare species of snail inhabits the Black Hills. This snail prefers limey soils in cool 
and dense coniferous forest and is rarely found above an elevation of 1600 meters or below 1200 
meters. Each data set (elevation, geology, vegetation) is queried to find the areas meeting the 
specified condition, and the resulting three layers are intersected to find where all three conditions 
hold (Fig. 10.5). The habitat polygons in the output contain the full attributes of all three layers, 
 
Fig. 10.5. Intersecting elevation, limestone areas, and dense conifer vegetation can help identify 
areas of potential snail habitat. 
Fig. 10.4. A union creates every possible new polygon from the combined input layers. 
Each new polygon assumes the attributes from both layers; the new polygon marked 
with the circle contains attributes from both the geology and slope class layers.

should that information be needed. Such a map would help biologists create sampling strategies 
for counting populations, analyze whether the habitats are interconnected or widely separated, 
and make decisions about forest management to protect the snails.  
The snail habitat demonstrates polygon-on-polygon intersection. Intersection can assign attributes 
from polygons to lines or points within them. The roads and land use problem described in 
Figure 10.2 is an example of line-in-polygon intersection, assigning land use categories to the 
roads. In Figure 10.6a, line-in-polygon intersection is used to assign a geologic unit to each 
stream reach (as in Chapter 9), 
useful for estimating stream loss to 
groundwater. One can also intersect 
points with polygons, or point-in-
polygon intersection. A realtor 
might have a point feature class of 
houses for sale and intersect it with 
polygons representing school 
districts in order to be able to list 
the school for each house 
(Fig. 10.6b). Note that a point-in-
polygon intersection is equivalent to 
a simple inside join with the point 
layer as the destination, even 
though they use different tools to 
do it. 
Whereas the union function requires two polygon input layers, the intersect command is more 
versatile. Both input and overlay layers may contain points, lines, or polygons. The output 
geometry may vary, but it cannot exceed the dimensionality of the lowest input.  
If the inputs are both polygons, the output 
may be points, lines, or polygons. In 
Figure 10.7a, the two circles might 
represent the drug-free zones around two 
schools. The polygon output shows the 
area of overlap; the line output could 
become a boundary on a map. 
If the inputs are both line feature classes, 
the output may be lines or points 
(Fig. 10.7b). These lines might represent 
hiking trails, in which case the line output 
would find locations where two trails 
travel together. The point output could find 
trail intersections that need to have 
signposts placed on them.  
If the inputs are polygons and lines, the 
output may be points or lines (Fig. 10.7c). 
If the circle represents the area around a 
school where sex offenders are forbidden 
to live, the line output could provide a list 
of the streets and address ranges that are

off limits. If the city intends to put a sign on 
every street entering the zone, the points 
output would estimate the number of signs 
needed and where they should go.  
Intersecting two sets of point data requires 
the output to be points, but is generally not 
a common analysis, unless someone is 
looking for duplicate points in two different 
data sets.  
Comparing overlay functions 
Figure 10.8 summarizes the different 
overlay operations that can be performed 
using two polygon input layers, including 
the extraction functions clip and erase, 
which do not combine attributes, and the 
intersect and union functions, which do. 
Clip and erase can also accept point and 
line feature classes for one input, but the 
boundary input must contain polygons. The 
output feature classes will have the same 
geometry as the input classes.  
Unions and polygon-on-polygon intersections are similar, so a word about when to use each may 
be helpful. The primary use of intersect is to find areas where certain conditions overlap. 
Typically the input layers occupy different regions, as do the elevation range, limestone, and 
conifer layers shown in Figure 10.5. The goal is to find the areas common to the inputs. Although 
the attributes from each input are combined in the final table, the attributes themselves are 
sometimes of little interest. In the snail habitat problem, the pertinent attributes were already 
preselected using queries. The main goal was developing a map of the overlaps. 
In a union, the primary goal is to combine the tables. Generally the input layers all fully occupy 
the same region, as the geology and slope class layers do in Figure 10.4. It is expected that the 
entire map area will remain, but that the new features will contain the attributes of both inputs. 
After a union, the usual next step is to perform attribute queries to find areas with specific 
combinations of attributes, or to symbolize the combinations to show areas of interest. In the 
landslide hazard example, we might have extracted the shale and high slope areas and done an 
intersect to show where the high-hazard areas exist. The 
hazard is either there or not there. With a union, though, we 
are able to analyze different combinations of geology and 
slope to assess potential impacts on slope stability. 
Slivers and tolerances 
Overlaying layers often produces small extraneous polygons 
or lines called slivers (Fig. 10.9). Sometimes these slivers 
represent real features. However, more often they arise when 
overlaying layers share some boundaries, such as voting 
districts and counties. In theory the shared boundaries should 
match exactly, but in practice few data sets have been

corrected to this level of integrity. These slivers do not represent real combinations of values and 
are a nuisance when calculating statistics or performing subsequent operations. It is often 
desirable to prevent slivers when overlaying. 
An XY tolerance can be set during an overlay operation. This tolerance specifies the 
minimum distance between vertices, and it will combine vertices that fall close together. 
Setting an appropriate tolerance during an overlay will eliminate many slivers. However, the 
tolerance applies to all vertices, and using a tolerance may degrade the accuracy of the data 
set. Caution should be used in setting tolerances that are large enough to correct slivers 
without shifting other vertices an unacceptable amount. It must also be remembered that 
outputs from an overlay that uses a tolerance generally have a lower geometric accuracy than 
the original layers. 
Slivers are especially troublesome when multiple overlay or analysis operations are planned, 
because the errors propagate and multiply with each successive step. If XY tolerances are being 
used, the generalization of the boundaries becomes progressively more severe and may 
significantly affect the geometric accuracy of the results. It is impossible to avoid these impacts, 
so users should be aware of what is happening and have realistic expectations for the spatial 
accuracy of the final output. If an XY tolerance is used during processing, its value must be 
included in metadata for the final output. 
Other spatial analysis functions 
Overlay is only one type of spatial analysis available in GIS systems. The remainder of this 
chapter presents additional commonly used functions, including dissolving, buffering, appending, 
and merging. All of these analysis functions, and many others, are found in ArcToolbox.  
Dissolve 
A dissolve is used to group features together based 
on whether they share the same value of an attribute 
field. For example, the road segments in 
Figure 10.10 have the same street name (Main St), 
but they are separate features. A dissolve based on 
the street name field would yield a new file in which 
all streets having that name were one feature. A 
dissolve can also be used to remove lines between 
polygon features that share the same value. For 
example, the map in Figure 10.11 shows ponderosa 
pine stands of different ages. 
Dissolving on the cover type field 
removes the age boundaries and 
yields polygons based on the cover 
type (ponderosa) only.  
The output from a dissolve 
operation may produce either 
single features or multifeatures. A 
multifeature exists when multiple 
unconnected areas constitute a 
single feature, as when the seven 
Hawaiian islands are combined to 
Fig. 10.10. Separate road segments were 
combined using the dissolve function.

produce one state feature. In Figure 10.11, the green polygons constitute many individual 
features. After the dissolve, if the multifeature option was selected, than all of the orange 
polygons will belong to one feature. If the multifeature option was declined, then the data set will 
have many orange features.  
When features are dissolved, the output layer is a new file containing the single attribute on 
which the dissolve was based. However, the user can specify additional fields to summarize the 
information from the original features. For example, in the dissolve shown in Figure 10.11, one 
might request the average canopy percentage of each output polygon, based on averaging the 
canopy percentages of the polygons before the dissolve. 
Buffer 
A buffer is constructed to delineate areas 
that fall within a certain distance of a set 
of features. Buffers can be created for 
points, lines, or polygons (Fig. 10.12). 
They could be used to find 300-yard 
drug-free zones around schools or 
sensitive protected areas within 100 
meters of a stream. Negative buffers can 
be applied to determine setback limits 
from the edge of a piece of property. 
Buffers can be created as simple rings or 
as multiple rings. An attribute can even supply different sizes of buffers for different features—
for example, buffering primary roads by 200 meters and secondary roads by 100 meters. 
Buffers are created for each individual feature and may 
overlap. This option might be appropriate in analyzing the 
distribution of soils in buffers around wells. In many 
cases, however, it is best to dissolve the buffers, which 
gets rid of the boundaries between them and removes the 
overlapping areas to create a single region. Figure 10.13 
shows the difference in results obtained when the buffers 
around roads are not dissolved versus when they are. If the 
areas of the buffers are of interest, then dissolving is 
always the correct action. If areas were calculated from 
nondissolved buffers, they would be grossly 
overestimated, because the overlapping areas would be 
counted multiple times.  
Finally, buffering is an intensive process, and the time 
involved increases quickly as the number of features 
increases. Any steps to reduce the number of buffers 
created at one time will facilitate analysis, for example, by 
performing queries before buffering rather than 
afterwards. 
Append and merge 
The append function is used to combine the features of 
two or more layers and place them into an existing target 
Fig. 10.13. Use the dissolve option 
to prevent overlapping buffers

feature class (Fig. 10.14). The appended layers must have 
the same feature type as the target (i.e., both polygons, both 
lines, or both points). The two layers must also share the 
same coordinate system. Overlapping of layers is 
permitted. 
The treatment of attribute tables during an append requires 
some consideration. If you wish to combine the attribute 
information from both layers, the attribute fields must have 
the same definition and must occur in the same order in both tables. If the two tables differ, one 
can use the NOTEST option. In this case, if a field in the input layer has the same name and data 
type as the target layer, then the information will be copied into the target. Fields without 
matching names will not be carried into the target. 
Merge is similar to append, except that it creates a new feature class and offers more flexible 
treatment of attribute tables. Instead of insisting that the two tables match, it allows the user to 
specify the fields to be included in the output feature class and which table they will come from. 
About ArcGIS 
About geoprocessing 
GIS analysis involves many functions that operate on data objects, such as feature classes or 
tables. Geoprocessing applies one or more of these functions in sequence to solve a problem or 
investigate the properties of data sets. Most ArcGIS tools operate on any allowed data type. In 
performing a road buffer, for example, one may specify a coverage, a shapefile, or a feature class 
from a geodatabase. The tools make the necessary allowances to execute the function on the 
various data types. A few tools operate only on certain data types. An ArcGIS Advanced license, 
for example, provides the user with a suite of additional tools that work on coverages. 
Ways to run tools 
Geoprocessing tools may be executed several ways. Toolbars and menus provide interactive 
control of tools. Users may customize menus and toolbars to add frequently used tools that don’t 
appear on the toolbars by default. Users can also create tools and place them on menus, on 
toolbars, or in ArcToolbox. 
ArcToolbox organizes all of the installed tools into one central location. It provides a window 
with most of the functionality of ArcGIS, containing tools that can be run from ArcMap or from 
ArcCatalog. Each tool has a set of parameters, or inputs, which must be specified before the tool 
is run. Some parameters are required, but others are optional, which means that the software 
supplies a default value that can be changed, if necessary. 
ArcMap has a command line that allows the user to type a command and its parameters rather than 
filling in boxes in a window. Typing requires greater familiarity with the tools, but for experienced 
users entering commands by typing may be faster and more efficient. Becoming familiar with the 
command line also paves the way to writing scripts to execute functions. The command line 
possesses a sophisticated interface to help beginners correctly enter the commands. 
Model Builder provides a graphic canvas to string tools together and execute them in sequence. 
Models have several advantages. First, they record the steps and parameters used to execute an 
analysis in case questions on methodology arise later. Second, models can be used to explore the 
Fig. 10.14. Append combines the 
features of two adjacent layers. 

Map Overlay and Geoprocessing

consequences of different parameters on the final outcome. Consider a model that calculates fire 
danger from precipitation, temperatures, vegetation, and structure locations through a series of 
tools. With a model, one could redo the analysis based on the current day’s precipitation and 
temperature conditions more quickly than if all the steps were executed interactively, and with a 
lower chance of mistakes. Models can be shared with other users, and they permit a less 
experienced user to reliably repeat an analysis set up by an expert. Models can incorporate 
decision structures, conditional statements, and iteration functions if needed. Finally, models can 
be saved as scripts to provide a starting point for creating geoprocessing programs. 
A script is a program that may contain conditional statements (if/then), iterative loops, and other 
control structures that permit sophisticated analysis. Scripts may be written in one of several 
programming languages, although in each case the geoprocessing commands are identical and 
only the control statements differ. ESRI has adopted the readily available language Python as the 
recommended scripting platform. A copy of Python is installed with ArcGIS, and all ESRI 
scripting examples and supplemental tools are written in Python. However, users may elect to use 
any COM-compliant language such as Jscript, VBScript, or Perl. 
Geoprocessing environments 
The operation of tools and commands is impacted by Environment settings specified by the user. 
For example, the default coordinate system setting is Same as Input, meaning that the output file has 
the same coordinate system as the input file. The user could alternatively specify a particular 
coordinate system, such as UTM Zone 13 NAD 1983. Under this setting, every output feature class 
would have the UTM coordinate system regardless of its input system. 
Figure 10.15 shows some of the Environment settings. The 
Workspace setting tells ArcGIS where to initially look for 
data and to save output data sets. It also sets a scratch 
workspace where temporary files are stored. The Output 
Coordinates setting specifies the coordinate system given 
to any outputs. If it is set to UTM Zone 13N, then every 
output data set will be stored in that coordinate system. 
Environment settings are hierarchical. Application settings 
are set using the main menu bar in ArcMap or in ArcCatalog, 
and they affect the operation and output of every tool that is 
run. (They will not cause changes to files that already exist.) 
The application settings are saved along with a map 
document, so it is possible for the settings to be operating 
without the user’s awareness. It is not a bad practice to check 
environment settings if you are getting unexpected results 
from the tools. When a new map document is opened, all 
settings are returned to their defaults. 
All tools in ArcToolbox have an Environments button 
that can be used to change the Environment settings 
temporarily for that one run of the tool. For example, the user might have set the application 
Environment processing extent to a small project area, but needs to buffer some streams and 
allow the areas to extend beyond the current study area. The Environments button in the Buffer 
tool can be used to temporarily override the extent setting. Models, scripts, and tools can all 
have their own environment settings, which take precedence over the application settings.  
Fig. 10.15. Some Environment 
settings 

Chapter 10 
298 
The default Environment settings work fine for most applications. Users may change them when 
doing so provides more efficient or accurate work. For example, Amy might have to clip 10 different 
feature classes and project them from a geographic coordinate system to a projected coordinate 
system. Instead of running both the Clip and Project tools on each layer, she could set the environment 
coordinate system to the desired projection and then run the clips, reducing the amount of work.  
Coordinate systems 
Tools will accept any coordinate system or combination of coordinate systems for input, but rules 
of precedence dictate the coordinate system of the output. Outputs will be projected on-the-fly, if 
necessary, according to the following rules: 
¾ If the output is placed in a feature dataset, the coordinate system will always match that 
of the feature dataset. 
¾ If the coordinate system is set in the Environment settings and the output will not become 
part of a feature dataset, the Environment settings coordinate system is used. 
¾ If the Environment setting is not set, the default rule applies—that the output will match 
the coordinate system of the first input to the tool.  
When setting the output coordinate system in the Environment settings, you can choose Same as 
Input (the default), or Same as Display (the current data frame), or set it to match the coordinate 
system of a particular data set. 
Geoprocessing tools are fundamentally spatial in nature and commonly manipulate areas and 
distances as part of the processing. When geoprocessing, it is best to always use a projected 
coordinate system, rather than a geographic coordinate system (GCS). As with spatial joins, it is 
not enough to set the data frame coordinate system to a projection. The tools operate on the saved 
feature class on disk, and the saved coordinate system is the one being used. When large areas 
such as continents or large countries are being analyzed, no projection can preserve both area and 
distance, and one must then choose the projection based on the type of analysis being done. 
Often a GCS is employed by data providers because they cannot predict what coordinate systems 
the user will need. When downloading data, it will often be in a GCS, and the user must choose 
an appropriate coordinate system and project the data to it. Chapter 3 explains this process. When 
you are setting up a database for a mapping and analysis project, a suitable projection should be 
chosen based on the scale and the extent of the data being analyzed. It must be kept in mind that 
distortions present in the map projection, if significant, will affect distance and area 
measurements. It remains important to choose a suitable map projection with minimal distortion 
of area and distance. Review the coordinate system properties on the inside front cover and the 
coordinate system selection guidelines in Chapter 3, if necessary. 
Areas and lengths of features 
Geodatabases and coverages automatically create and update fields containing the areas and 
perimeters of polygons or the lengths of lines. Shapefiles do not maintain this information. Users 
may create AREA or LENGTH fields for shapefiles and calculate the values manually. However, 
be careful when using information from these fields. If polygons in a shapefile are clipped, 
dissolved, or intersected or they undergo any other operation that changes their shape, the AREA 
fields will not be updated automatically. The user must manually update the fields again to ensure 
they are correct. Be cautious using an AREA or a PERIMETER or a LENGTH field in a shapefile 
unless you are sure they are correct. Chapter 6 introduced the Calculate Geometry tool for 
updating areas, lengths, and perimeters in a variety of units.  

Map Overlay and Geoprocessing 
299 
Summary 
¾ Map overlay resembles a spatial join, but it splits features when they partly overlap. This 
function enforces a one-to-one relationship between features when their attributes are joined 
in the output table. 
¾ Map overlay comes in two basic types. A union keeps all the features from both layers. An 
intersect keeps all the features that are common to both input layers. Attributes from both 
layers are joined together in the output. 
¾ A dissolve combines features within a data layer if they share the same attribute. This 
function can be used to convert many street segments into a single line feature or to remove 
boundaries between parcels with the same zoning. 
¾ Buffers are polygon constructions that enclose the area within a certain distance of features. 
Buffers may be created for points, lines, or polygons, and they may be constructed as single 
or multiple rings. 
¾ Append and merge allow feature classes with the same feature type to be combined as a 
single feature class, such as merging two adjacent quadrangles to make a single file. 
¾ Map overlay and spatial analysis are generally best done using a projected coordinate system, 
especially if one anticipates determining areas and lengths as part of the analysis. 
¾ Geoprocessing involves stringing together a sequence of commands during spatial analysis. 
Spatial functions may be executed from the menus, ArcToolbox, the command line, Model 
Builder, or scripts. 
¾ The Shape_Area, Shape_Length, and Shape_Perimeter fields in geodatabase feature classes 
are stored and updated automatically. Other area-based or length-based fields, such as Area, 
Acres, or Road_km, are not automatically updated.  
¾ Lengths and areas of features stored in shapefiles must be updated manually.

Preparing to overlay 
Our first step is to create layers that contain polygons where each condition holds. We will begin 
with the Geology layer. The limestone areas include the Madison Formation and the Upper 
Paleozoic units. We will use an attribute query to place these units in a separate layer. 
4Î Choose Selection > Select By Attributes from the main menu bar.  
4Î Set the layer to Geology and enter the expression:  
NAME = ‘Upper Paleozoic’ OR NAME = ‘Madison Limestone’. Click OK. 
4Î Right-click the Geology layer and choose Selection > Create Layer from Selected 
features. 
4Î The new layer appears at the top of the Table of Contents. Rename it Limestone. 
TIP: Creating a layer from a selection, although not necessary for processing, is often a good 
practice. It keeps the selection available if a question about the procedure arises later, or if a tool 
must be rerun due to an error. 
Next, we will select the dense conifers and create a layer from them. We will do the query in two 
steps. First we will select the ponderosa pine (TPP) and white spruce (TWS). Then we will select 
the dense areas (class contains C or 5) from the already selected set.  
5Î Turn on the Vegetation layer and turn off the Limestone layer. 
5Î Clear all selected features. 
5Î Open the Select By Attributes window again and set 
the layer to Vegetation. 
5Î To select only the conifers, enter the expression: 
COV_TYPE = ‘TPP’ OR COV_TYPE = ‘TWS’. Click 
Apply. 
 
6Î Change the selection method to select from current 
selection. 
6Î Clear the expression and enter another one that says: 
DENSITY96 = ‘C’. Verify the expression and click OK. 
6Î Right-click the Vegetation layer and choose Selection 
> Create Layer from Selected Features. 
6Î Rename the new layer Dense Conifer. It should look 
like the polygons shown in Figure 10.17. 
The elevation range has already been prepared. You are almost ready to intersect. 
7Î Clear the selected features and turn off the Vegetation layer. 
7Î Turn off all layers except the Elevation Range layer, the Limestone layer, and the 
Dense Conifer layer. 
7Î Zoom in to the middle right of the map and examine the Dense Conifer polygons. 
Fig. 10.17. Dense conifer 

Map Overlay and Geoprocessing 
303 
Notice that these polygons have many 
boundaries inside them because they are 
divided based on age and density as well as 
species. The amount of time needed to 
intersect a layer is proportional to the number 
of features in the layer. To streamline the 
intersect, we are going to remove the 
unnecessary boundaries between these 
polygons using the Dissolve tool. 
8Î In ArcToolbox, expand the Data 
Management > Generalization 
entries and double-click the 
Dissolve tool to start it (Fig. 10.18). 
When using a tool for the first time, it is wise 
to select Show Help to find out what the tool 
does and what the parameters mean. 
8Î Click Show Help on the 
Dissolve tool and read the 
description. 
8Î Click on the Input Features box. The Help message changes to describe the Input 
Features parameter. 
8Î Click on and read the descriptions for the other input parameters in the window. 
8Î To bring the tool description back, click on the gray tool area.  
8Î Click on the Tool Help icon at the bottom of the tool for more detailed information. 
Read about the Dissolve tool. 
8Î Close the ArcGIS Desktop Help window and click Hide Help on the Dissolve tool. 
 
9Î Click the drop-down arrow in the Input Features box and set it to Dense Conifer 
(Fig. 10.18). 
9Î Click the Browse button to place the Output Feature Class in the 
BlackHills/chap10results geodatabase and name it DensConifDisslv.  
9Î Check the box to dissolve on the COV_TYPE field. 
9Î Keep the box unchecked to Create multipart features. We want unconnected 
polygons to remain separate features. 
9Î Notice the other options in the tool. We don’t need to change any of them, however. 
9Î Click OK.  
TIP: When using a tool, be aware that some options may be out of sight, and you must scroll 
down to see them. Often the defaults are fine, but get in the habit of checking before you run it. 
10Î Examine the output file and note that the intervening boundaries have disappeared. 
10Î Right-click the Dense Conifer layer and choose Remove. 
10Î Rename the DensConifDisslv layer Dense Conifer.

Intersecting polygons 
Now we are ready to overlay. We will use Intersect 
because we want to find the areas common to all three 
layers. Because the tool can intersect only two layers at 
a time, we must use it twice.  
11Î Open the ArcToolbox > Analysis Tools > 
Overlay > Intersect tool (Fig. 10.19). 
11Î Click Show Help and examine the entries. 
1. What are the options for the Join Attributes 
parameter? Which one do you think is best to use? 
__________________________________________
__________________________________________ 
11Î Click on the drop-down button under 
Input Features and choose the Dense Conifer 
layer. It will be added to the list of Features. 
11Î Click the drop-down button again to add 
the Limestone layer to the list. 
11Î Enter the Output Feature Class, placing it 
in chap10results and naming it conf_lime. 
11Î Set the Join Attributes option to NO_FID. 
11Î The remaining options can be left with their defaults. Click OK. 
11Î Examine the output. The conifers outside the limestone have disappeared. 
TIP: The Feature ID, or FID, is a unique integer assigned to every feature for tracking. During an 
intersection, new FID values are assigned to each new feature. The NO_FID option eliminates the 
original FID values from the output table, since they have little use. 
12Î Use the Intersect tool again to intersect conf_lime and the Elevation Range layers, 
naming the output snailhab and putting it in chap10results. 
TIP: If you have an ArcGIS Advanced license, you can intersect more than two layers at a time. 
13Î Zoom out to the full extent of the data. 
13Î Rename the snailhab layer Snail Habitat. 
13Î Remove the Limestone, Dense Conifer, and conf_lime layers. 
13Î Zoom in to the extent of the Snail Habitat and turn on the Roads layer. 
Overlay of lines in polygons 
The snails have a three-week breeding season in early June. During this period they seek the open 
areas offered by roads, and many get crushed. The Forest Service wants to consider closing 
primitive roads that traverse through snail habitat during the breeding season to lessen the number 
of crushed snails. They need to assess which roads must be closed. You will make a map with the 
proposed road closures. This process involves a line-in-polygon intersection. 
Fig. 10.19. The Intersect tool 

Map Overlay and Geoprocessing 
305 
14Î Use Select By Attributes to select the Primitive roads TYPE = ‘PR’. (Make sure 
you set the method back to Create a new selection.) 
 
15Î Intersect the Roads layer (with the primitive road selection) and the Snail Habitat 
layer. Name the output propclose and put it in chap10results. 
15Î Rename the propclose layer 
Proposed Closures. Clear the 
selected features. 
 
16Î Create a map similar to 
Figure 10.20, with the closure roads 
highlighted in red and the other 
roads in black. Turn off the 
Elevation Range layer. Set the 
transparency of the Snail Habitat 
layer to 50% to help bring out the 
road patterns. 
16Î Save your map document. 
Clipping layers 
The vegetation layer does not extend as far north as the rest of the data, but the map may give 
readers the false impression that the analysis is valid there. Clipping the Roads layer at the edge 
of the vegetation layer will prevent any misunderstanding. You need the Clip tool. Recall that you 
can use the Search window to find tools. 
17Î On the main menu bar, choose Geoprocessing > Search For Tools. 
17Î Type clip in the search box. Several suggestions appear, including Clip (analysis) 
and Clip (management). The words in parentheses refer to the area of the Toolbox. 
17Î Ignore the suggestions for now and click on the magnifying glass button. 
The list includes some exact matches (clip) and some similar functions, such as clipping rasters, 
along with a description of each. 
17Î Click the Options button in the search window and choose Search Options. 
17Î Click the General tab and check the box to Show Pop-up window in search results. 
17Î Click OK and hover the cursor over the blue tool names to see the descriptions. The 
Clip (Analysis) appears to be the one to use. 
17Î Click the blue Clip (Analysis) text to open the tool. 
TIP: You can pin the Search window to the right tab bar for easy access later. 
18Î Set the Input Features to Roads. Set Vegetation as the Clip Features. 
18Î Store the output in the chap10results geodatabase as roadclip. Click OK. 
18Î Turn off the Roads layer. 
Fig. 10.20. Map showing proposed road 
closures in snail habitat areas 

Chapter 10 
306 
You can quickly transfer the symbology of the old Roads layer to the clipped roads. 
19Î Open the properties of the roadclip layer and click the Symbology tab.  
19Î Click the Import button and choose to import symbology from a layer or layer file. 
19Î Click the drop-down box to set the layer to Roads. Click OK. 
19Î The road classification is based on the TYPE field. The clipped roads use the same 
field, so leave the TYPE name in the box. Click OK and OK. 
 
20Î Rename the roadclip layer Clipped Roads. 
20Î Click and drag the Clipped Roads layer below the Snail Habitat layer. 
Working with buffers 
To prevent snail death on the major roads, which cannot be closed, a Forest Service biologist has 
suggested thinning the tree stands within 200 meters of the roads to make these areas less 
attractive to snails and keep them away from roads. We can prepare a map showing the stands to 
be cleared and determine the total percentage of snail habitat that would be eliminated. 
21Î Use Select By Attributes to select the primary and secondary roads from the 
Clipped Roads layer, using the expression TYPE = ‘P’ OR TYPE = ‘S’. 
21Î Create a layer from the selected roads and name it Major Roads. Clear the 
selected features. 
TIP: Buffers are, time-consuming to create, so it is helpful to reduce the number of features 
before buffering. We will use the Elevation Range layer to clip the roads before buffering. 
22Î Open the tool ArcToolbox > Analysis > Extract > Clip. 
22Î Set Major Roads as the Input Features and Elevation Range as the Clip Features. 
22Î Save the result in chap10results as majroadclip. Click OK to run the tool. 
22Î Turn off the other road layers to examine the new file. 
Now buffer the clipped roads. 
23Î Open the tool ArcToolbox > Analysis > Proximity > Buffer. 
23Î Set the Input Features to majroadclip and the Output Feature Class to roadbuf in 
chap10results. 
23Î Set the Linear unit to meters and type 200 in the box. 
23Î Scroll down, if necessary, and set the Dissolve Type to ALL. Click OK.  
TIP: By default, the Buffer tool does not dissolve boundaries between buffers. This is one case 
where the default option is not right, and the Dissolve Type must be set to ALL.  
Now intersect the road buffers with the snail habitat to determine the potential areas to be cleared. 
24Î Open ArcToolbox > Analysis > Overlay > Intersect. 

Map Overlay and Geoprocessing 
307 
24Î Choose Snail Habitat and roadbuf as the Input 
features. 
24Î Specify the Output file as proposedthin in 
chap10results. Click OK. 
 
25Î Clean up the map display to show the results. 
Turn off the roadbuf layer and make the 
proposedthin layer a symbol that contrasts well 
with the snail habitat (Fig. 10.21). 
Now the final step is to determine the area of snail habitat that 
will be eliminated by the thinning. Geodatabases automatically 
keep track of the areas, lengths, and perimeters of features. 
26Î Open the proposedthin table and examine the Shape_Area and the Shape_Length 
fields. 
These fields were renamed Shape_1_Area and Shape_1_Length during one of the intersections, 
but they will contain the correct areas and perimeters for the feature class. The units of the 
Shape_Area field will be in the same coordinates as the map units of the feature class coordinate 
system, in this case, square meters.  
26Î Use the Statistics function to determine the total area to be thinned. 
TIP: To convert square meters into square kilometers, divide by 1 million (1,000,000). 
2. What is the total area of the proposed thinning in square kilometers? _________________ 
3. What is the total area of snail habitat in square kilometers? _______________________ 
4. What percentage of the habitat would be eliminated by the proposed thinning? ______ 
TIP: Shapefiles do not automatically maintain area, length, or perimeter fields. Values in these 
fields may not be correct if geoprocessing actions have been performed since the fields were 
created. The fields may be updated using the Calculate Geometry tool described in Chapter 6. 
Investigating relationships with union 
Intersect is valuable for finding areas where known criteria exist simultaneously, such as finding 
the snail habitat based on known ideal factors of elevation, geology, and vegetation. Union is a 
powerful tool for investigating relationships between two types of information. 
It is well known that rock units have an impact on the soils that are produced from them. It would 
be interesting to see if the soils then have an impact on the productivity of the forest. We will 
perform a union on the Geology and Vegetation layers to explore this question. 
27Î Turn off all layers except Geology and Vegetation. 
27Î Open ArcToolbox > Analysis > Overlay > Union. 
Fig. 10.21. Proposed thinning 
areas (in pink) 

Chapter 10 
308 
27Î Choose Geology and Vegetation as the Input 
Features. 
27Î Name the output feature class geolveg and put it 
in the chap10results geodatabase. Click OK. 
 
28Î Zoom to the full extent and turn off all layers 
except for geolveg. 
First, notice that all areas of both input layers are included in the 
output, even though the Vegetation layer does not cover as much 
area as the Geology layer does. 
28Î Click the Identify tool. Click on several of the 
large polygons at the top and examine the attributes.  
28Î Click on several small polygons at the bottom. 
Most of the smaller polygons occur where both Vegetation and 
Geology were present. Their attributes are stocked with 
information from both layers (Fig. 10.22). However, the 
polygons at the top came only from Geology, so the vegetation 
fields are full of blanks and zeroes.  
To investigate the relationship between geology and site 
productivity, we will Summarize on the Geology NAME field, and request statistics from the 
SITE_PROD and CROWN_COV fields, both indicators of forest productivity. However, because 
some polygons have no vegetation data, we will exclude the zero values from consideration with 
a query. 
29Î Close the Identify window and open the geolveg table. 
29Î Open the Table Options > Select By Attributes window and enter the expression 
SITE_PROD > 0. Click Apply and close the query window.  
 
30Î Right-click the NAME field and choose Summarize. 
30Î Expand the SITE_PROD field and check the boxes for Minimum, Maximum, 
Average, and Standard Deviation. 
30Î Expand the CROWN_COV field and check the boxes for Minimum, Maximum, 
Average, and Standard Deviation. 
30Î Name the output table geolproductivity and save it in the chap10results 
geodatabase. Click OK and add the table to the map. 
 
31Î Open the geolproductivity table. Find the Average_SITE_PROD field and use Sort 
Descending. Examine the averages and standard deviations. 
31Î Find the Average_CROWN_COV field and use Sort Descending. Examine the 
averages and standard deviations. 
Although both site productivity and crown cover vary from unit to unit of the geology, for the 
most part all the averages are within one standard deviation of the others. This analysis does

union of geology and 
vegetation

309 
not support the hypothesis that the geological units have a significant impact on forest 
productivity. 
31Î Close the Table window and clear all selected features. 
Working with slivers and tolerances 
We will now work on a short exercise to demonstrate the problem of slivers and how to help 
prevent them using tolerances. We need a different data frame for this part of the tutorial. 
32Î Choose Insert > Data Frame from the main menu 
bar. Collapse the Sturgis Area data frame to hide 
the layers you’ve been working with.  
32Î Add the cd111 and counties feature classes from 
the mgisdata\Usa\usdata geodatabase. 
32Î Zoom in to the San Francisco Bay Area in 
northern California (Fig. 10.23). 
32Î Choose Bookmarks > Create Bookmark. Enter 
the name San Francisco and click OK.  
This area will be our experiment. We don’t need to overlay the 
entire country, so to save processing time, we will use the 
Environment settings to constrain the output extent to this 
display window. 
33Î From the main menu bar, choose Geoprocessing > Environments. 
33Î Expand the Processing Extent entry. 
33Î Change the Extent drop-down to read Same as Display. Click OK. 
 
34Î Open the tool ArcToolbox > Analysis > Overlay > Union. 
34Î Enter cd111 and counties as the input features. 
34Î Name the output union_notol and put it in chap10results. Click OK. 
TIP: Once set to an extent, the Processing Extent setting 
will continue to use the same range of x-y coordinates, so 
it will not be affected as you zoom in and out. 
35Î Zoom to the full extent of the data. 
35Î Notice that only a small group of polygons 
around San Francisco is included in the 
output. This is the result of the Processing 
Extent environment setting. 
35Î Choose Bookmarks > San Francisco, and 
examine the output.  
Notice that many slivers occur (Fig. 10.24). The district 
and county boundaries coincide in real life, but these two 
Fig. 10.23. Zoom in to this 
area. 
Fig. 10.24. Slivers from the union 

Chapter 10 
310 
data sets come from different sources, and the boundaries aren’t identical. To specify a processing 
tolerance, it would be helpful to know the typical width of the slivers. 
36Î Zoom in to a region with typical slivers. 
36Î Click the Measure tool on the Tools toolbar. Set the units to meters. 
36Î Measure across several slivers to estimate their widths. Close the Measure tool. 
You will find that a typical width is about 1000 meters. A tolerance is a radius, so we should use 
about half the measured value. Let’s repeat the union and use a tolerance of 500 meters. 
37Î Open the ArcToolbox > Analysis > Overlay > Union tool.  
37Î Set the input layers to cd111 and counties, as before. 
37Î Name the output union500 and place it in the chap10results geodatabase. 
37Î Enter 500 meters as the XY tolerance. Click OK and examine the output. 
37Î Turn the new layer on and off a few times to compare the boundaries with the 
union_notol layer. Many slivers are gone in the new layer. 
Notice two things about the new layer. First, many slivers are still present. Our initial tolerance 
was not sufficient to remove them. Second, the district boundaries have lost some of their detail. 
The XY tolerance may not have fixed all the slivers, but it already is having an effect on the 
accuracy of the output. Nevertheless, we will try a larger tolerance. 
38Î Repeat the union of cd111 and counties, but this time use an XY tolerance of 1000 
meters and name the output union1000. 
38Î Turn on just the union_notol and the union1000 layers and compare them by turning 
the top one on and off a few times. 
Most of the slivers are now gone, but the loss of detail in the district boundaries is apparent. The 
county boundaries don’t look much worse, but they were a lower resolution to begin with. 
39Î Try one more union with a 1500-meter tolerance and compare. 
Now the generalization of the boundaries is obvious, and a few stubborn slivers still remain. 
Further generalization and loss of accuracy are not worth getting rid of the few remaining slivers. 
The 1000-meter tolerance gave the best compromise performance. Before we go on, we must set 
the Environment settings back to their defaults. 
40Î Choose Geoprocessing > Environments from the main menu bar. 
40Î Expand the Processing Extent entry and set it back to Default. Click OK. 
TIP: One challenge of using Environment settings is to remember to reset them after you are 
finished. Note that the Environment settings are saved with map documents. 
Geoprocessing with Model Builder (optional) 
This section shows how to use Model Builder to record sequences of geoprocessing steps. Since 
the snail habitat problem is familiar, we’ll use it as our example.  

Map Overlay and Geoprocessing 
311 
Î Open the original version of ex_10.mxd without any changes.  
Î Use Save As to save it under a new name and save often as you work. 
Model Builder often creates intermediate data sets while it works. You can specify a scratch 
workspace where these are placed, so that they don’t interfere with the original data. You set the 
workspace using the Environment settings. 
41Î Open Geoprocessing > Environments from the main menu bar. 
41Î Expand the Workspace entry. Set both the Current Workspace and Scratch 
Workspace to the chap10results geodatabase. Click OK. 
5. You already set these Environments earlier in the tutorial. Why do you have to set them a 
second time now? 
Creating and running a model 
You store a model inside a geodatabase or in a toolbox. We will create a toolbox for it.  
42Î Click the Model Builder button on the main tool bar. 
42Î Choose Model > Save in the 
Model Builder window. 
42Î Navigate so that you are in 
the BlackHills folder. 
42Î Click the New Toolbox 
button in the Save window. 
42Î Name the toolbox BHtools 
and click Enter. 
42Î Double-click the new 
BHtools toolbox to enter it. 
42Î Type SnailHab as the name 
for the model and click Save. 
 
43Î Choose Model > Model 
Properties from the Model 
Builder menu bar. 
43Î Label the model Snail 
Habitat Analysis and give it 
a description (Fig. 10.25).  
43Î Examine the other settings 
as shown in Figure 10.25 and 
then click OK. 
TIP: Storing relative pathnames for a model makes it work if the model and data together are 
moved to a different folder. Absolute pathnames only work if the data stays put. 
In Model Builder, you paste the desired tool in the window, set arguments for the tool, and run it. 
Each step can be run separately as the model is built or all together. When building the model, it 
is helpful to execute the steps one at a time. In the beginning of this tutorial, we used Select By 
Fig. 10.25. Naming and describing a model 

Chapter 10 
312 
Attributes to select the desired polygons from the geology and vegetation layers. In Model 
Builder, we use the Make Feature Layer tool.  
44Î Find the ArcToolbox > Data Management Tools > Layers and Table Views > Make 
Feature Layer tool. Click and drag it to the Model Builder window.  
44Î Right-click the 
Make Feature Layer 
tool in the Model 
Builder window and 
choose Open.  
44Î Set the Input 
Features to Geology 
and name the 
Output Layer 
Limestone, as 
shown in 
Figure 10.26. 
  
45Î Click the SQL button to enter the selection expression: [NAME] = ‘Upper 
Paleozoic’ OR [NAME] = ‘Madison Limestone’. Verify the expression. 
45Î Click OK to close the SQL window and OK to close the tool.  
45Î The boxes in the model 
become colored, indicating 
the tool is ready to run. 
Choose Model > Run, or 
click the Run button to 
execute this part of the 
model.  
45Î Close the dialog box after 
the tool completes 
successfully. A drop shadow 
behind the model shapes 
indicates that the tool has 
been run (Fig. 10.27). 
The blue ovals indicate inputs, and the green ovals indicate outputs. Both inputs and outputs have 
properties that can be set. 
45Î Right-click the green Limestone oval and choose Add to Display. The new layer 
appears in the Table of Contents and is shown on the map. 
Now we’ll use the same tool to select the dense conifers. Because we’re using a tool, it is easier 
to do the selection in one step.  
46Î From ArcToolbox, click and drag another copy of the Make Feature Layer tool onto 
the model canvas.

Map Overlay and Geoprocessing 
313 
46Î Right-click the tool to open it. Set the Input Features to Vegetation and the Output 
Layer to Dense Conifer.  
46Î Click the SQL button and carefully enter the expression (with the parentheses): 
 
([COV_TYPE] = ‘TPP’ OR [COV_TYPE] = ‘TWS’) AND [DENSITY96] = ‘C’. 
46Î Click the Verify button to ensure that you did not make a mistake in the query. 
 
47Î Click OK to close the SQL window and OK to close the tool window. 
47Î Click the Run button and close the dialog window after it finishes. 
47Î Right-click the Dense Conifers output and choose Add to Display. Make sure that 
the selection looks correct (see Fig. 10.17). 
TIP: Click on a model shape to select it. Use click and drag boxes or the Shift key to select 
multiple shapes. Click and drag selected shapes to move them around on the model canvas or to 
resize them. Use these techniques to arrange the model in neat patterns. 
The Auto Layout button can be used to quickly arrange the model in a logical pattern. 
48Î Click and drag the ArcToolbox > Analysis > Overlay > Intersect tool onto the 
model canvas. 
48Î Right-click the Intersect tool on 
the model canvas and open it. 
48Î Set the Input Features to 
Limestone and Dense Conifer. When 
choosing the layers, be sure to choose 
the ones with the blue symbol, 
indicating that they are outputs from 
the model. 
48Î Name the Output Feature Class 
conf_lime and store it in the 
chap10results geodatabase. Click 
Yes to overwrite the one that exists, 
if you are asked. 
48Î The tool should look like 
Figure 10.28. Leave the other 
arguments set to their defaults.  
Notice the red or yellow warning sign next to the Output Feature Class. Put the cursor on it to 
read the message that says that this output already exists. Of course it does, since we’ve done this 
analysis before. When running models, you generally want to be able to overwrite previous 
results. We can set this option. 
49Î Click OK to close the tool. 
49Î Choose Geoprocessing > Geoprocessing Options from the main menu bar. 
49Î Check the box to Overwrite the results of geoprocessing operations. Click OK.

314 
50Î Drag another copy of the Intersect tool from ArcToolbox to the model canvas. 
50Î Open the second Intersect tool. 
50Î Select the conf_lime model output from the Input Features drop-down box.  
50Î Choose Elevation Range from the Input Features drop-down box. 
50Î Name the output feature class snailhab2 and place it in chap10results. 
50Î Leave the rest of the arguments to their defaults and click OK.  
 
51Î Choose Model > Save to save the model in its current form. It should look similar 
to the model in Figure 10.29. 
51Î Run the model. The two intersections you set up will both be executed.  
51Î Right-click the snailhab2 output to add it to the display and examine it. 
 
Changing and rerunning a model 
The saved model provides a record of the inputs and parameters used to derive the output. It can 
also be edited and run again to try out different solutions. Imagine that a geologist colleague has 
commented that the Lower Paleozoic geological units also contain limestone and should be 
included with the other geology layers.  
52Î Right-click the Make Feature Layer input box for the Geology query and open it. 
52Î Click the SQL button and click at the end of the current expression to place the 
cursor there. 
52Î Add the rest of the expression, OR [NAME] = ‘Lower Paleozoic’, so that all three 
units will be selected. Verify the query and then click OK to close the tool.

Creating a tool from a model 
Finally, models can be set up to run as tools, by turning the inputs into parameters. This 
approach is helpful when the same series of steps is to be run with different inputs each time.  
55Î Right-click the blue Vegetation oval and choose Model Parameter. A small P 
appears to the right of the blue oval, indicating that it is now a parameter. 
55Î Right-click on the snailhab2 green oval and make it a parameter. 
55Î Save the model and close it. 
Before we can run the tool, we must add your toolbox to ArcToolbox.

Toolbox. 
56Î Navigate to the BlackHills folder and click on the BHtools toolbox. Click Open. 
56Î Open ArcToolbox again and double-click the BHtools > Snail Habitat Analysis tool. 
The model is opened as a tool, with input boxes for the two parameters. Examine the titles above 
the boxes, Vegetation and snailhab2. The titles are taken from the names assigned to the ovals in 
the model. Let’s rename them so they make more sense to a user. 
57Î Close the tool. Right-click on the model in the toolbox and choose Edit. 
57Î Right-click the Vegetation oval and choose Rename. Call it Input Vegetation

57Î Save the model and close the model canvas. 
57Î In ArcToolbox, double-click on the model to open it as a tool. 
TIP: Double-clicking or choosing Open will open the model as a tool to be run. To open the 
model canvas, right-click the model and choose Edit. 
There is a more recent vegetation feature class in the Sturgis83 geodatabase called veg2006. 
We’ll run the model again using the new data to see if the habitat has changed in the last 
decade. 
58Î Click the Browse button and find the veg2006 feature class in the Sturgis83 
geodatabase. Add it.

58Î Turn off all layers except the Roads, snailhab2, and snailhab06. 
58Î Compare the snailhab2 and snailhab06 layers, noting the change in habitat. 
Recall that to create the tool we designated the vegetation input and the habitat output as 
parameters that could be set each time the tool is run. You can also set individual arguments as 
parameters. Imagine that we wanted to be able to select different types of vegetation each time we 
ran the tool.

Exercises 
Use the data in the BlackHills folder and Sturgis83 geodatabase to answer the following questions. 
Because solution methods can vary, your answers may be slightly different from the ones in the 
back of the book. 
  1. The Madison Limestone is an important aquifer. Citizens are concerned about gas or chemical 
trucks overturning on roads and causing contamination. What is the total length of roads 
crossing the Madison, in kilometers?  
  2. The infiltration rate of the geological substrate is a strong factor in evaluating the spill hazards 
for roads. Create a map of all the roads based on the infiltration capacity of the geology, using 
appropriate symbols to indicate hazard. Capture your map. 
  3. The use of a road is another factor in evaluating spill hazards. Create a new field in the roads 
feature class with a hazard rating of 3 for primary roads, 2 for secondary roads, and 1 for 
primitive roads. Create a map and capture it. 
  4. Now create new field for a hazard index based on both infiltration and use, adding them 
together. What is the range of values for the index? Create a map of the roads based on the 
hazard index. Capture the map. 
  5. Rangeland can cause significant impacts on surface water quality. Using the lulc and 
wsheds2b feature classes, create a table showing the area of rangeland in each watershed. 
(Include both herbaceous and mixed rangeland categories.) 
  6. Areas that are within 300 meters of both streams and primitive roads are the most popular 
places for fishing. Create a map showing these areas. Capture your map. 
  7. The fishing areas in #6 should be restricted to areas within the national forest (OWNER = 
‘NFS’ in the vegetation feature class). Create a revised map showing the public access fishing 
areas in green and the private fishing areas in red. Capture your map. 
  8. You need a feature class that shows polygons based only on infiltration and only within the 
wshds2b area. Symbolize this layer based on infiltration. Capture your map. 
  9. The Forest Service is concerned about septic systems contaminating the Madison Limestone. 
Create a map showing private land (OWNER = PVT in the Vegetation layer) on the Madison. 
Capture the map. 
10. The Forest Service is considering adopting a policy to not cut timber within 200 meters of a 
primary road (TYPE = P). Assuming that cutting timber includes all SSTAGE96 LIKE ‘4*’, 
determine the total area in square kilometers lost to harvesting if this policy were adopted. 
Capture a map showing the off-limits areas. 
Challenge Problem: A Perfect Place 
Imagine that you have always wanted a vacation home in an aspen stand with a little pond. Create 
a map showing all aspen stands (COV_TYPE = ‘TAA’) that lie on low infiltration geology units 
(INFIL = LOW) and are within 500 meters of a primary or secondary road (TYPE = P or S). 
Capture your map.

Mastering the Concepts 
GIS Concepts 
Raster data 
The availability of two different data models, raster and vector, provides flexibility to options for 
data storage and analysis. (Readers may wish to review the section in Chapter 1 on raster and 
vector data models.) Neither data model is intrinsically superior; they both have areas in which 
they excel and areas in which they are at a disadvantage. The GIS professional who has a grasp of 
both tools holds the keys to developing the most efficient and accurate analysis. 
The analysis functions available for rasters number in the hundreds and include very sophisticated 
applications. This chapter introduces some basic concepts and analysis functions, but the topic 
spans a much greater breadth of theory and technique than we have time to explore here. The 
serious student of raster analysis will find plenty of additional material in the software 
documentation for Spatial Analyst. 
Recall that spatial data come in two forms (Fig. 11.1). Discrete data, such as soil types or land 
use, represent spatial objects and form distinct objects or regions on the map. Continuous data, 
such as elevation, vary smoothly over a range of values and form a surface or field. The vector 
data model best stores discrete data. Rasters easily store and 
analyze continuous data. 
Like vector data, rasters have a defined coordinate system with a 
projection and a datum. The raster is georeferenced by specifying 
the x-y coordinates of the center of the upper-left pixel and the 
cell size (the height/width of the pixels). Usually pixels are 
square. A 30-meter raster has pixels composed of 30 × 30-meter 
squares. The cell size is specified in the coordinate system’s map 
units, and meters or feet are typically used.  
Although one can store a raster in a GCS, this practice is not 
common because the distortion gives an unsatisfactory view of 
the data. Furthermore, many raster analysis functions 
incorporate distance and angle formulas that will give inaccurate

data and a continuous digital 
elevation model 

Chapter 11 
320 
results when applied to a raster in a GCS or in a projection with significant distortion. Therefore, 
raster data are normally stored in whatever projected coordinate system gives the best and most 
undistorted view of the data. The main exception occurs for data providers, such as the US 
Geological Survey, which provide topographic or other data in GCS format. Such data should be 
projected before they are used.  
Raster analysis 
Raster processing is fundamentally different from vector processing. Vector analysis manipulates 
x-y coordinates. Raster processing operates on stacks of aligned cells and can be very efficient. 
This chapter describes the most common functions, but many more are available. 
Map algebra 
A raster is an array of numeric values arranged in rows 
and columns. Several stacked rasters representing 
different attributes can be analyzed using cell-by-cell 
formulas based on mathematical, logical, or Boolean 
operators. This technique is called map algebra. 
Consider the stack of two input rasters in Figure 11.2. 
These rasters can be added together cell by cell to 
produce a new raster with cells containing the sum of the 
corresponding cells in the inputs. If the cells of the input 
rasters are not already aligned, then they must be 
resampled to achieve this. 
The map algebra expression for the operation in 
Figure 11.2 would appear as [Outraster] = [Inraster1] + 
[Inraster2] with the raster names enclosed in brackets. 
Imagine a raster of precipitation in inches. The 
expression [Precip] * 2.54 produces an output raster with precipitation in centimeters. 
Expressions can include multiple rasters, functions, and values. A more complex expression to 
predict erosion potential as a function of rainfall, slope, soil erodability, and vegetative cover 
might read: 
[Precip] * 2 + [Slope] * 4 / ( [Erosion] – [Vegcover]). 
Map algebra also includes logical functions that can return 
Boolean rasters, which have values of true (1) or false (0) 
indicating where some condition holds. Figure 11.3 shows 
the result of entering an expression [Elevation] > 1400; the 
blue area shows the cells that meet this criterion. 
Boolean overlay 
Overlay is commonly applied to suitability analysis, in 
which a landscape is evaluated to find which areas best serve 
a given purpose based on a set of factors. The snail habitat 
problem in Chapter 10 is an example, in which the purpose is 
to provide habitat for snails and the factors included 
elevation, vegetation density, and geology. Raster overlay is 
especially well suited to suitability problems. First, it can 
incorporate conditions from continuous data sets, such as 
elevation or slope, which cannot be easily stored as vectors.

Second, the process is faster because 
corresponding cells are simply added 
or multiplied together, instead of 
splicing the existing polygons and 
creating new ones. Third, raster 
overlay can process more than two 
layers at once.  
Boolean overlay is similar to vector 
overlay, but it uses map algebra with 
Boolean rasters and operators. 
Chapter 8 introduced Boolean 
operators, which evaluate two input 
conditions, A and B, to determine a 
result that is true or false. In raster 
analysis, this function is performed 
on a cell-by-cell basis.  
Figure 11.4 demonstrates the Boolean 
operators. The circles represent input 
rasters A and B, which contain true 
values inside the circles and false 
values outside. The squares represent 
two 4x4 input rasters, and the third column details the operator logic. The AND operator finds the 
areas common to both inputs and is the equivalent of the vector intersect function. The OR 
operator result combines the areas of both and matches the union function. NOT is equivalent to 
the erase function and is the only Boolean operator that is not commutative. The XOR operator 
has no equivalent tool for vectors (although the same result could be achieved with intersect 
followed by an erase). 
Imagine using Boolean overlay creating a potential habitat map for lodgepole pine trees based on 
two criteria: areas above 1500 feet in elevation and with more than 60 cm of precipitation 
annually. In Figure 11.5a, the Boolean raster shows where the precipitation conditions for 
lodgepole are favorable. Areas where the precipitation is greater than 60 cm have the value true

(1), and areas labeled false (0) have precipitation <= 60 cm. Figure 11.5b shows the favorable 
conditions based on elevation, where the cells containing 1 have elevations > 1500 meters.  
To find the lodgepole habitat, we apply the Boolean operator 
AND to the input rasters. If both inputs are 1, the output cell is 
1. If either or both of the input cells has a 0, then the output 
will be 0. Figure 11.5c shows the output raster with the 
potential habitat areas identified as cells with the value 1 (true).  
The Boolean AND operates the same way as multiplication of 
the two input rasters. Figure 11.6 compares the outputs of 
AND and multiplication on two Boolean inputs, and they are 
identical. Thus, either AND or multiplication can be used to 
find the lodgepole habitat. Since both of these operators are 
symmetrical, meaning that the order of inputs does not matter, 
they can be applied to three or more rasters as easily as two. 
Map addition provides another way to model the habitat—to rank the 
probability of finding lodgepole. In this model, if both elevation and 
precipitation are ideal, then lodgepole is most likely to occur. If only 
one is ideal, then it might occur but is not as likely. If neither condition 
is ideal, then lodgepole is very unlikely. To implement this model, we 
add the two input maps instead of multiplying them. The final raster in 
Figure 11.7 has three possible values: 0 if neither condition is true, 1 if 
either condition is true, or 2 if both conditions are true. Thus, 2 
indicates the highest probability of finding lodgepole, 1 a moderate 
probability, and 0 a low probability. Of course, we would wish to test 
our model of lodgepole habitat suitability by testing to see if we 
predicted where lodgepole is actually found. 
Weighted overlay 
Boolean overlay has several drawbacks for suitability analysis. First and greatest, it demands that 
all variables be portrayed as true/false, when in reality it makes little sense that a slope of 10.0 is 
all right for a building site, but 10.1 is not. It is often more realistic to consider a gradation of 
values going from less ideal to ideal. Second, it assumes that all input layers are of equal 
importance. Yet in deciding on a building site, perhaps being close to an existing road is more 
important than slope, because the cost of developing a long driveway is greater than doing some 
extra bulldozing to prepare the site. 
Weighted overlay analysis addresses these two drawbacks. Like Boolean overlay, it 
develops a set of K rasters (R1, R2, …, Rk) specifying the suitability of a set of conditions. 
Instead of a simple true/false, however, each raster is ranked into ordinal values 1 to N from 
worst to best, where N is any positive integer. Each raster is also assigned a weight W k 
between 0 and 1, with all the weights summing to 1 (W1 + W2 + … + Wk = 1). The output is 
then calculated as W1R1 + W2R2 + … + WkRk, yielding a raster with values between 1 and N. 
High values in the output indicate a higher suitability. 
Consider siting a landfill, for example (Figure 11.8). Four factors (K = 4) might be considered: 
slope, soil infiltration, distance from streams, and distance from roads. A suitability index value 
of N = 3 is desired. First, one must reclassify each raster, converting its original values into a set 
0

of new values from 1 to 3, creating four index rasters, one for each factor, as shown in  
Figure 11.8. The final raster is achieved by multiplying each index raster by its weight and adding 
them together. The final raster contains floating-point values between 1 and 3, with the highest 
values (and darkest colors) indicating the most suitable areas. Weighted overlay provides a more 
flexible and sophisticated approach to suitability modeling than Boolean overlay. Its main 
disadvantage is that assigning the suitability ranks and weights is usually a subjective process, 
and the final model is heavily dependent on the 
analyst’s choices. 
Distance functions 
Distance functions calculate a continuous range of 
distances from a specified set of objects. The 
Euclidean distance function produces a raster in 
which each cell represents the shortest distance from 
a set of specified objects, for example, streams (Fig. 
11.9a). A related output is the Euclidean direction 
function, which records the direction of the closest 
object. At any given point, these two grids would 
show the distance from the closest stream and the 
direction you would have to travel to get to it. 
The Euclidean distance function is also the means 
for creating buffers as raster data sets. Once a

distance surface is generated, it is a simple matter to identify the distances that are greater 
than or less than a specified buffer value, to produce a Boolean raster with a 1 value inside 
the buffer and a 0 value outside. 
Cost-distance functions consider more complex and flexible approaches to travel. Consider a 
mountain with two points on opposite sides. The shortest path to the opposite point goes over the 
mountain. However, it is easier to go around the base, even though the path is longer, due to the 
effort (cost) of climbing over the mountain. Slope is one kind of cost. Heavy vegetation, marshes, 
and off-limits areas are other factors that increase the cost of travel. 
In a cost-distance analysis (Fig. 11.9b), a raster is first prepared that estimates the cost of travel 
over a surface. A single cost factor, such as slope, could be used, or the raster could combine 
different types of costs. This cost raster is used to develop a cost direction raster, which tells a 
traveler which directions incur the least cost, and a cost accumulation raster to keep track of the 
total effort expended as the traveler moves. These rasters can be combined to calculate the least-
cost path between two points, indicating the easiest journey rather than the shortest. In Figure 11.9, 
a slope raster was used to designate the cost, and a least-cost hiking trail was calculated. 
Density 
A density function creates rasters showing the 
frequency of objects within a search radius specified 
by the user. The function visits each cell of the output 
raster, counts the points (cities) falling inside the 
search radius centered on that cell, and assigns the 
count to the cell. If an attribute field is specified, the 
counts are weighted by the attribute. Figure 11.10 
shows a point density map of city populations in the 
United States. Without the attribute, the function 
would count the number of cities; with the attribute, it 
counts the number of people. The counts are given 
per unit area, as in people per square mile or cities 
per square kilometer. A large search radius produces 
a smoother map but will show less detail than a smaller radius. Choosing the search radius can 
take some experimentation, but it should be large enough so that every cell will have at least one 
feature within the search radius; to meet this condition in Figure 11.10 a radius of several hundred 
miles would be required because of the low number of cities in the Mountain subregion. 
A line density function counts line occurrences within the circle instead of points, and it weights 
them by length and optionally by attribute. This function could be used to calculate road density 
within a national forest. An attribute field might give stronger weights to primary roads and a 
lesser weight to primitive roads. 
The point density function assumes that the entire weight value is present at each point, but this is 
not always true. A city cannot have 100,000 people living at a single point. A kernel density 
function spreads the population value smoothly over a circular area, with the maximum value in 
the center and decreasing values around it. The kernel density function provides a more realistic 
model of the population distribution, and the resulting raster will appear smoother than the result 
obtained with the point density function. The search radius value has less impact on the kernel 
density function, although larger radii will produce more generalized rasters.

cities using a 500 mile search radius 

Raster Analysis 
325 
Interpolation 
Interpolation takes measured values at points and distributes 
them across a raster, estimating the values in between the 
measurements. A common example involves taking precipitation 
measurements at weather stations and interpolating the 
precipitation values in between stations to create a continuous 
precipitation surface. Figure 11.11 shows the interpolation of the 
total precipitation measured at the stations over the Black Hills 
region, with the watersheds superimposed on the image. 
Four different interpolation methods are common: inverse 
distance weighted (IDW), splines, trends, and kriging. Each 
method uses different assumptions and different means to obtain 
the result. More information about these four interpolators can be 
found in the Help documentation for Spatial Analyst. 
Interpolation is a complex topic and the subject of entire 
textbooks. GIS professionals should become familiar with the 
different methods in order to understand the benefits, drawbacks, 
and assumptions of each one.  
Although interpolated and density maps appear similar, the functions work differently. Density 
functions count occurrences within a radius and divide by the area. Interpolation estimates a value 
for each raster cell based on nearby measurements. 
Surface analysis 
Surface analysis includes a set of functions for 
calculating properties of a surface, such as slope 
and aspect. Although most commonly applied to 
elevation data, these functions can be used on any 
type of continuous raster. Using these functions on 
a DEM could help find an ideal location for a 
cabin, for example. A slope map, showing the 
steepness of the terrain, could help identify sites 
flat enough to build on. An aspect map, showing 
the compass direction of the slope, could locate 
south-facing hillsides to give the cabin a warm 
southern exposure. A hillshade map, which 
represents the surface as though an illumination 
source were shining on it (Fig. 11.12), can help the 
reader visualize the landforms. A viewshed 
analysis, which determines what parts of a surface 
can be seen from specified view point(s) 
(Fig. 11.12), could help in choosing the site with the best view. Finally, the Cut/Fill function 
calculates the differences between two input surfaces and is useful for developing estimates of the 
amount of material to be added or removed from a building site. 
Neighborhood statistics 
Neighborhood functions operate on an area of specific size and shape around a cell, known as a 
neighborhood. A moving window passes over the raster and calculates a statistic from all the cells 
in the neighborhood, records the result, and moves on. Neighborhoods may have different shapes, 
Fig. 11.12. A viewshed map shows the 
areas visible from a point on a hilltop in 
red. The background map is a hillshade. 
Observer

Chapter 11 
326 
including squares, circles, rectangles, and annuli. The statistical functions include minimum, 
maximum, range, sum, mean, standard deviation, variety, majority, minority, and median. Two 
types of neighborhood functions are used: block functions and focal functions. 
A block function moves the window such that it never overlaps the previous window, but it 
produces a set of side-by-side adjacent windows that are independent of each other. Once the 
statistic is calculated for the window, every cell in the neighborhood receives the same value 
before the window moves on. Every cell is used only once. A block function can be used to 
resample a raster from a higher to a lower resolution, as might be needed to adapt a high-
resolution land cover data set for a coarse climate modeling grid. 
A focal function centers the window on a cell, called the target. It calculates the statistic for the 
neighborhood and assigns the value to the target cell, and then it repeats the process at the next 
adjacent cell. Consider a 3×3-cell averaging window (Fig. 11.13). For each target cell, the 
algorithm finds the average of the nine cells in the window and in the target cell of the output 
raster. The window then moves to the next cell. An edge cell is still evaluated but will have fewer 
cells in the neighborhood; the cell in the upper-left corner of Figure 11.13 has only four values to 
average: the target and its three neighbors. A filter is another name for a focal function.

Figure 11.14 shows the difference in output between a block and focal majority function applied 
to a land cover raster (Fig. 11.14a). In both cases, a 4 × 4-cell neighborhood containing 16 cells 
was used, and the statistic is the most frequent land use value found in the neighborhood. The 
white output cells occur where no majority was found. In Figure 11.14b, the focal function 
evaluated each cell with its 15 immediate neighbors and then moved to the next adjacent cell. In 
Figure 11.14c, the block majority function evaluates the 16 cells and then moves to the adjacent 
group of 16. Both generalize the original data set, but to a different degree. 
Zonal statistics 
The zonal statistics function is sometimes considered another type of neighborhood function, but 
the neighborhoods are not a fixed size or shape. Instead, they are defined by another layer, called 
the zone layer. A zone is a region of a raster or a polygon feature class that shares the same 
attribute. A zone might be a watershed, a parcel, or a soil type. The attribute might be a name, a 
category, or a unique identifier, such as a parcel-ID or even the table ObjectID.  
The function gathers all the cells from an input raster that fall inside each zone and calculates cell 
statistics for the zone. For example, if a watershed layer defined the zones and the input raster 
contained slope, then zonal statistics would calculate the average slope for each watershed. 
Figure 11.15a shows a set of watersheds displayed on a hillshade map, and you can clearly see 
which watersheds have more variable topography and a higher average slope. When the zone 
function is executed, the slope values are averaged for each watershed.  
Zonal statistics functions may produce two types of output, a raster or a table. A raster output 
places the calculated statistical value into every cell in the zone. The table output contains the 
zone attribute field plus one or more statistics for each zone. This 
table could be joined to the original watershed polygons using the 
zone field and used to map the average slope of the watersheds 
(Fig. 11.15b).  
Zones need not be contiguous like the watershed zones, however. 
The geology map in Figure 11.16 contains many unconnected areas 
with the same geological unit. The map has only six zones, one for 
each color. 
The zonal statistics function can also assign values from a surface to 
line or point data, such as finding the average slope along a stream 
Fig. 11.15. Using zonal statistics to find the average slope of watersheds: (a) the zone raster 
shown over a hillshade; (b) the watersheds colored by and labeled with the average slope

section or attaching an elevation value from a DEM to a layer of wells. Each line or point must 
have a unique name or ID value that identifies it as a distinct zone. 
Reclassify 
The reclassify function changes the values of a raster according to a scheme designed by the user, 
such as classifying a slope map into three regions of low, medium, or high slope, or ranking 
suitability factors in a weighted overlay (Fig. 11.8). For a map with only a few values, such as 
land use codes, the user might specify a new value for each code individually. Perhaps a town has 
annexed a nearby planning unit that used different land use codes and must convert one set of 
codes to another; the code 143 becomes 347, and so on. With continuous data covering a range of 
values, such as slope, the values are typically classified into a discrete number of ranges. 
Classification uses a tool similar to the one described in Chapter 4 for classifying attribute data. 
Resampling 
Often rasters must be converted to a raster with a different cell size. This process is called 
resampling. Users may resample purposely in order to align rasters with each other or to 
decrease the resolution of a data set. Resampling must occur any time two rasters with different 
cell sizes are analyzed together. Even if the rasters have the same cell size, the cell rasters might 
not be aligned with each other, requiring that resampling occur. 
Figure 11.17 shows an example of resampling. The cell centers on the left are being transformed 
from coordinate system X1-Y1 to a slightly larger one, X2-Y2, introducing gaps between the 
cells. The cell grid for the new coordinate system is shown in the output by the black lines. The 
old cells may be resampled to the new cells using one of three methods. In nearest neighbor 
resampling, the new cell is given the value of the old cell that falls at or closest to the center of 
the new cell. In bilinear resampling, a distance-weighted average is taken from the four nearest 
cell centers. The cubic convolution resampling method determines a new value by a curve fit 
through the nearest 16 cell centers. Nearest neighbor is the fastest method and should always be 
used with categorical raster data. The bilinear method is best for continuous rasters like elevation. 
The block neighborhood function provides an alternative resampling method that is more flexible 
than the three standard strategies, because different types of statistics can be used. In Figure 11.14c, 
a majority statistic was used to find the most frequent land cover value in the block, which provides 
a better estimate of the region’s contents than using the value at the center of the block. Although it 
is not an option for automatic resampling, it can be helpful when a user needs to coarsen raster data 
and wants to do it using the best possible method. 
Resampling can degrade the quality of a data set. Best practices dictate that the user retain full 
awareness of the coordinate systems and cell sizes of all input layers being used for analysis and

endeavor to standardize them before processing occurs. Some GIS systems automatically 
resample without warning. Users must be especially careful with these systems if they are 
attempting to retain a high degree of spatial integrity in their rasters. 
Conversion 
Users can easily convert between rasters and vectors, such as turning a geology shapefile into a 
raster. The user must choose one attribute field to populate the values of the raster, such as the 
geology unit name. Rasters can only store numbers. Numeric fields are converted as is, but text 
values are assigned arbitrary numeric codes for storage in the raster. Some raster formats place 
the original text values in a raster table for reference. 
You may also convert discrete rasters to polygons as long as the number of polygons does not 
become excessive. Continuous data, such as DEMs, should never be converted to polygons, since 
each pixel is different from its neighbors and will become a separate polygon. If too many 
polygons will result from a conversion, the software may be unable to complete the task. 
About ArcGIS 
Storing rasters 
ArcGIS can read many raster data formats and can read and write some of them. Prior to ArcGIS 
Version 10, Spatial Analyst could only operate on a format unique to ArcGIS, called a grid. 
Other rasters, such as TIFF files, SID files, and JPEG files, had to be converted to grid format 
before they could be analyzed, and all raster output generated by Spatial Analyst took the form of 
grids. At Version 10, Spatial Analyst reads any supported raster format and supports four 
different output formats: grids, geodatabase rasters, TIFF, and ERDAS Imagine. In this chapter, 
we will work almost exclusively with geodatabase rasters. 
TIP: Rasters should NOT be stored in folders that have pathnames containing spaces, because 
some functions will not work properly. GIS users are advised to avoid spaces in ALL folder 
names, no matter what.  
TIP: NEVER copy, move, rename, or delete grids using Windows Explorer. Grids have 
complex storage formats, and Windows cannot manage them properly. Always use ArcCatalog to 
manage grids. 
Rasters come in two forms. Integer rasters store whole numbers in binary format. Floating-point 
rasters can store decimal values, but they require 2–4 times as much space as integer rasters. 
Thus, it is foolish to use floating-point rasters except when decimal values are required. When 
creating output, the raster type will usually be the same as the input. If you add or multiply two 
integer rasters, the result will also be an integer raster. If one of them is floating-point, the output 
will be floating-point. Some functions always create floating-point rasters, such as dividing or 
averaging a raster. (Floating-point rasters may be converted into integer rasters using the INT 
tool.) 
TIP: Raster names must contain only letters, numbers, or an underscore. Grids have even stricter 
naming conventions and are limited to 13 characters. Consult ArcGIS Help for more information 
on supported formats and naming rules. 

Chapter 11 
330 
Raster attribute tables 
Rasters can have attribute tables, but they are 
slightly different from feature attribute tables. Each 
record lists one unique value present in the raster. 
The table has three standard fields: the ObjectID 
field, containing a unique ID for the table rows; the 
Value field, showing each unique cell value; and 
the Count field, indicating how many cells contain 
that value (Fig. 11.18). This table shows that the 
Precambrian rock covers the largest area because 
more cells (64,573) have that value than any other. 
The set of all cells sharing the same value in the 
raster is called a zone. 
The attribute table in Figure 11.18 comes from a raster that was converted from a polygon feature 
class using the rock unit Name field, so the Name is included in the table. The Value field 
contains numeric codes representing each rock unit, which were arbitrarily assigned at the time 
the feature class was converted. The Cenozoic unit is represented by the code value 1, the Upper 
Mesozoic by code 2, and so on. Attribute tables may also include fields added by the user.  
Only integer rasters can have attribute tables. The tables of categorical rasters are the most useful, 
as they document a fairly small set of discrete values. However, an attribute table is automatically 
created for any raster with fewer than 500 unique values. 
NoData values 
Rasters may contain a NoData value that indicates a null, or 
missing, value for a cell. Because rasters are always rectangles, the 
NoData value may be used to mask areas outside a nonrectangular 
area, as shown by the black cells in Figure 11.19. NoData values 
are typically displayed with black or transparent color. Some 
raster formats use 0 instead, which may cause skewing of image 
statistics. NoData values are usually ignored in processing, 
providing more consistent results. 
Some tools allow the user to specify different methods for 
handling NoData values. If you choose to Ignore NoData values, 
then the tool tries to complete the computation using the values it 
has available; this is usually the preferred and default option. The 
other option is to assign NoData to the output cell if the input cells 
contain one or more NoData values. In other words, if any input values are NoData, the tool 
assumes that it does not have enough information to calculate a valid result for that cell. 
Using Spatial Analyst 
Spatial Analyst is an extension to ArcGIS and must be purchased separately. It contains a set of 
tools for ArcToolbox, under the heading Spatial Analyst Tools (Fig. 11.20). The tools are 
organized by function type. Spatial Analyst tools are fully integrated into the geoprocessing 
environment. They can be run from the toolbox or the command line, used to build models in 
Model Builder, and incorporated into scripts.

The tools are well documented in the Help files, in many cases 
including complete discussions of the concepts behind each tool. 
Users interested in interpolation, for example, will find extensive 
information on, and references to, the various interpolation 
methods (IDW, kriging, trending, and splining). Reading about 
unfamiliar tools before implementing them is highly 
recommended. 
Environment settings 
The Spatial Analyst tools obey the Geoprocessing Environment 
settings just like any other tool. Several settings are particularly 
useful and bear mention.  
The Workspace settings specify the default input and output 
locations for data sets. Spatial Analyst produces many output 
rasters that may be intermediate steps toward a solution. Specifying 
a separate folder or geodatabase to hold the outputs helps keep 
them separated from permanent data collections and simplifies 
cleanup later. Setting the current workspace to this temporary place 
also streamlines the entry of output file names in tools. 
The Output Coordinates setting specifies the output coordinate 
system. It is usually best left to the default, Same as Input. 
Projecting rasters consumes time and memory and should be done 
only when necessary, preferably as a separate and conscious step 
and not as a forgotten background process. 
The Processing Extent controls the rectangular area 
used to preselect features or raster cells to be used in 
a tool. By default, all areas of the input data sets are 
used. With rasters, this setting is particularly 
important because a raster must have a rectangular 
extent. If two data sets represented by the black 
squares in Figure 11.21 are input to a tool, the output 
raster will contain the entire blue area even though 
the cells outside the black lines will be NoData. The 
default is the Intersection of Inputs option (the 
yellow area containing all cells with valid values 
from both inputs). You can also set it to match the 
display area, or to be the same as a specific data set 
to which everything else should conform. 
The Cell Size setting controls the output resolution of rasters 
(Fig. 11.22). It can be set to a specific value or to match an existing 
data set. The default is the maximum of the inputs. For example, if 
two inputs have cell sizes of 50 meters and 30 meters, the output will 
have 50-meter resolution. The cell size is always measured in 
coordinate system units and is typically in meters or feet. If a raster is 
stored in a GCS, however, the units will be degrees.

settings

Analyst toolbox

settings 

Chapter 11 
332 
Some tools ask for a cell size even if the environment is set. In this case, the cell size box will be 
filled with a suggested value based on the map units and the analysis extent. The suggested size 
will usually create a raster with a sufficient, but not excessive, number of cells. If the suggested 
size is far different from what you expect or want, then double-check the extent settings and the 
map units before proceeding. 
The Mask setting is used to specify a 
polygon feature class or raster that controls 
which cells will be processed. A mask raster 
contains NoData cells outside the region of 
interest, and all output cells there will be 
given NoData values. If a feature class is 
used as a mask, then any cells outside the 
feature class boundary will receive NoData 
values.  
Using a mask is similar to using the clip 
function for vector data. In Figure 11.23, 
areas outside the watershed have NoData 
instead of elevation after the mask is 
applied.  
TIP: Environment settings persist through a work session unless changed, and they are saved 
with map documents. They are reset to the defaults when a new map document is opened. 
Coordinate system management 
Raster functions treat layers as arrays of numbers, which can be processed as a stack. To perform 
raster analysis, all of the input rasters must have the same cell size and extent so that the cells in 
each stack align. If a command receives inputs with different cell sizes or extents, the rasters will 
automatically be resampled to match each other. By default, all rasters are resampled to the most 
coarse cell size present in the input rasters. When input rasters have different coordinate systems, 
Spatial Analyst will automatically project the rasters to match. 
The resampling and projection process is invisible to the user and seems convenient; however, it 
does increase the processing time. Resampling or projecting very large rasters may overwhelm 
the computer and cause a system failure. Since resampling or projecting can also degrade the 
quality of a data set, it is unsettling to realize that it can happen without the user’s knowledge. 
Storing all rasters to be analyzed together with the same cell size and extent can reduce 
unintentional resampling.  
If multiple coordinate systems are input for analysis, the output raster will be given a coordinate 
system based on this order of precedence: (1) the coordinate system specified by the Environment 
settings, and (2) the coordinate system of the first input to the tool.

Raster Analysis

Summary 
¾ Rasters consist of spatial data stored as individual cells in an array and can represent discrete 
features or continuous fields of information.  
¾ Rasters have coordinate systems just like other spatial data. Many raster calculations are 
based on distance and area functions, so it is important to store rasters in a projected 
coordinate system with minimal distortion. 
¾ Map algebra treats rasters as arrays of numbers that can be added, multiplied, and otherwise 
manipulated on a cell-by-cell basis. Arithmetic, logical, Boolean, and bitwise operators and 
functions offer a wide array of options for analyzing rasters and scalars. 
¾ Raster overlay is generally faster and better incorporates continuous data than vector overlay 
for suitability analysis. Boolean overlay uses true/false rasters and Boolean operators. 
Weighted overlay uses reclassification and weights for greater flexibility in modeling 
suitability. 
¾ Distance functions measure distances from a set of objects, and can calculate costs and paths 
associated with traveling over a surface. 
¾ Density functions measure the number of objects occurring within a specified search radius 
and report it in features per unit area. 
¾ Raster interpolation estimates a surface based on measurements at isolated locations. 
¾ Statistical measures can be calculated for rasters based on single cells, within a specified 
neighborhood, or within large, irregular zones. 
¾ Rasters can be reclassified and given new values as needed. 
¾ Resampling occurs automatically when rasters with different cell rasters are analyzed 
together but can degrade the quality of a data set. Users should attempt to minimize 
resampling when possible by aligning raster data before analysis. 
¾ The analysis environment controls certain settings for all new rasters created during a session. 
The settings include the working directory, the extent and cell size of output rasters, and the 
analysis mask.

The following examples provide step-by-step instructions 
for doing basic tasks and solving basic problems in ArcGIS. 
The steps you need to do are highlighted with an arrow Î; 
follow them carefully. Click on the video number in the 
Video Index to view a demonstration of the steps. 
Î Start ArcMap and open ex_11a.mxd in the 
MapDocuments folder. 
Î Use Save As to rename the document and 
remember to save frequently as you work. 
To become acquainted with raster analysis, we will use 
rasters to solve the snail habitat suitability problem from 
Chapter 10 (Fig. 11.24). Spatial Analyst functions are all 
found in a Spatial Analyst toolbox. Before using the Spatial 
Analyst extension, however, it must be turned on.  
1Î Choose Customize > Extensions from the main menu bar. 
1Î Check the box to activate the Spatial Analyst extension, if it is not already checked. 
1Î Close the Extensions window. 
1Î Click the List By Drawing Order icon at the top of the Table of Contents.  
As before, we will create a practice geodatabase to store our results and prevent them from 
mixing with the original data. 
2Î Open the Catalog tab and expand the Folder Connections > mgisdata folder. 
2Î Right-click on the BlackHills folder and choose New > File Geodatabase. Name it 
chap11results. 
It is wise to set some Environment settings before starting. We will be producing many rasters, so 
it helps to have a default workspace to store them. We should also set a default cell size and 
extent, so that all outputs have the same area and resolution as our Elevation raster, 30 meters. 
3Î Open Geoprocessing > Environments from the main menu bar. 
3Î Expand the Workspace entry. Set both the Current Workspace and Scratch 
Workspace to the chap11results geodatabase.  
3Î Expand the Processing Extent entry. Set the Extent drop-down to Same as layer 
Elevation. 
3Î Expand the Raster Analysis entry. Change the Cell Size drop-down to Same as layer 
Elevation. Click OK. 
TIP: It is good practice to form a habit of checking the Environment settings at the beginning of a 
work session. Forgotten settings from previous sessions may cause strange results. 
Fig. 11.24. Snail habitat 
determined by vector analysis 

Chapter 11 
336 
In Chapter 10, we predicted snail habitat from vector layers of geology, vegetation, and elevation. 
We will now perform the same analysis using three Boolean rasters, each one representing one of 
the ideal snail conditions. We will then multiply them together to find the habitat. We’ll begin by 
creating the elevation range from the DEM. 
Performing a Boolean overlay  
The snails prefer elevations from 1200 to 1600 feet. We need to create a Boolean raster in which 
the cells meeting the elevation criteria have a value of 1 and the rest have a value of 0. The 
Reclassify tool is used to convert one set of raster values to another.  
4Î Open ArcToolbox and dock it as a tab on the right side of ArcMap. 
4Î Open the ArcToolbox > Spatial Analyst Tools > Reclass > Reclassify tool. 
4Î Use the Input raster drop-down to select the Elevation raster. 
4Î The Reclass field is already set to Value, the field containing the values stored in the 
raster. This is almost always the field you use when processing rasters. 
You can edit the entries here directly (be sure to put spaces around the hyphens if you do). 
However, it is often easier to use Classify to set up the desired class breaks first, either manually 
or using one of the classification schemes described in Chapter 4. 
4Î Click the Classify button. Click OK if you get 
a sampling error message. 
4Î Change the Classification method to Equal 
Interval and the number of classes to 3. 
4Î Change the Classification method to Manual. 
 
5Î In the Break Values box, change the top 
number to 1200 and click Enter. 
5Î Change the middle value to 1600. 
5Î Look in the Classification Statistics window 
and note that the maximum value is 1958. Set 
the third class break value above it, to 2000. 
5Î Click OK to close the Classification window. 
5Î Enter the 0 and 1 in the New values boxes as  
shown in Figure 11.25, including 0 for NoData. 
5Î Name the output elevrange and save it in chap11results. 
Click OK. 
The new raster should appear as in Figure 11.26 (your colors may be 
different). This is a Boolean raster with two values: a 1 where elevation 
is in the desired range (green) and a 0 where it is not. 
6Î Right-click the 0 value symbol for elevrange and set its 
color to Gray 10%. This helps you visualize the parts of the 
raster that meet the criteria. 
6Î Turn off the Elevation raster and the Roads layer and turn 
on the Geology layer.

Next, we will convert the Geology layer to a raster. Rasters 
store only one attribute value, so we must specify which 
field in the geology table will supply the data. We will use 
the NAME field. 
7Î Choose ArcToolbox > Conversion Tools > To 
Raster > Feature to Raster. 
7Î Select Geology as the input features and set the 
Field to NAME (Fig. 11.27). 
7Î Name the output geolraster and place it in 
chap11results. 
7Î Enter 30 for the output cell size. Click OK. 
7Î Turn off the Geology polygon layer. 
We converted on a text field (NAME), but a raster can store only numbers. Hence, the legend for 
geolraster shows seven different numbers and colors, one assigned to each of the unit names.  
8Î Right-click the geolraster layer and choose 
Open Attribute Table.  
In a raster table, the Value field shows the values stored in 
the cells (Fig. 11.28). A number was assigned to each 
different name, and the NAME field was added to the table 
to show what each value represents. The Count field 
indicates how many cells have that value. 
1. What percentage of this raster consists of Madison 
Limestone? ______ 
TIP: To save space and reading effort, future tutorial references to “ArcToolbox > Spatial 
Analyst Tools > will be written simply as “Spatial Analyst >”. 
Because we are only interested in the limestone, we must reclassify geolraster to create a Boolean 
raster containing pixel values of 1 for the Madison and Upper Paleozoic rock units. 
8Î Close the Table window. 
 
9Î Open Spatial Analyst > Reclass > Reclassify. 
9Î Set the Input raster to geolraster and the Reclass field 
to NAME. 
9Î Change the New values to 1 for the Madison 
Limestone and the Upper Paleozoic units. 
9Î Change the other values, including NoData, to 0. 
9Î Name the output limestone and place it in chap11results. Click OK.

Next, we will create a Boolean raster showing areas of dense conifers. 
10Î Turn on the Vegetation layer and turn off the geolraster layer. 
10Î Open the ArcToolbox > Conversion Tools > To Raster > Feature to Raster tool. 
10Î Set the input features to Vegetation and the value field to DENSITY96. 
10Î Name the output density and put it in chap11results. 
10Î Set the cell size to 30 and click OK. 
 
11Î Turn off the Vegetation layer. 
11Î Open Spatial Analyst > Reclass > Reclassify. 
11Î Set the Input raster to density and the Reclass field to 
DENSITY96. 
11Î Change the New value to 1 for C, and the rest to 0. 
11Î Name the output trees and put it in chap11results. 
We are ready to overlay. We have three Boolean rasters, each containing 1 where the habitat 
condition holds and 0 where the condition is absent. When we multiply them, areas that meet all 
three conditions will be assigned the value 1, and all other cells 
will be 0. 
12Î Choose Spatial Analyst > Map Algebra > Raster 
Calculator.

“elevrange” * “limestone” * “trees”  
12Î Name the output snailhab and place it in 
chap11results. Click OK. 
 
13Î Turn off all layers except for snailhab. 
13Î Zoom to the extent of the snailhab layer and 
compare it carefully with Figure 11.29 (your colors 
may be different). 
TIP: A bug in Version 10.1 gave incorrect results from the Raster Calculator. If your results 
don’t match Figure 11.29, you can work around the bug using the Spatial Analyst > Math > 
Times tool. However, it can multiply only two rasters at a time, so you must use it twice.  
In Figure 11.29, the snail habitat has the value 1 and appears purple. It is the raster equivalent of 
the snail habitat calculated in Chapter 10 by intersecting vector features. With rasters, though, we 
can choose to add them to get a ranking of suitability, rather than just a simple yes or no. 
TIP: If the Raster Calculator is not working, use the Spatial Analyst > Math > Plus tool to add 
the rasters.

14Î Name the output snailhabrank and place it 
in chap11results. Click OK. 
14Î Open the Symbol properties for snailhabrank 
and change the color scheme to a light to dark 
green color ramp.  
This time the best habitat receives the value of 3, and other 
areas are ranked by how many of the preferred conditions 
occur there (Fig. 11.30).  
Distance functions and buffers 
Vector analysis uses buffers to evaluate proximity to features, such as areas within 200 meters of 
a road. Distance analysis using rasters is more powerful and flexible, partly because rasters can 
store continuous distance information, whereas vectors are limited to portraying discrete objects. 
Let’s explore some of the raster distance functions. 
15Î Collapse the legends and turn off all layers 
except for Roads. 
15Î Open the Spatial Analyst > Distance > 
Euclidean Distance tool. 
15Î Set the input feature source data to Roads 
(Fig. 11.31). 
15Î Name the output distance raster roaddist 
and save it in chap11results. 
15Î Leave the maximum distance blank. 
15Î The output cell size should already be 30 
from the Environment setting.  
15Î Give the optional output direction raster the 
name roaddir and save it in chap11results. 
Click OK. 
 
16Î Turn off roaddir for the moment to examine roaddist. 
16Î Open the roaddist layer properties and click the Symbology tab. 
16Î Click Classify and change the method to Jenks. Click OK and OK. 
Normally, equal interval is the proper classification for distance rasters, but in this case the 
roadless area in the upper left is skewing the distance measurements and the symbols.  
17Î Click the Identify tool and click on cells of the raster to see the values they contain. 
Fig. 11.31. Euclidean Distance 
tool 
Fig. 11.30. Ranked habitat raster 

Chapter 11 
340 
Each cell of the roaddist raster 
represents the distance of that cell to 
the nearest road (Fig. 11.32a). The 
distances are calculated in the 
coordinate system units, meters. When 
you click on a point, the pixel value is 
the distance you would have to travel 
to get to the closest road. 
17Î Turn on the roaddir 
raster and examine the 
values in its legend. 
17Î Set the Identify window 
to identify values from 
roaddir, and click on 
several cells. Close the 
Identify window when finished. 
The roaddir raster cells record the direction to the closest road 
(Fig. 11.32b). The raster values are in degrees and range 
continuously from 0 to 360, with 0 (and 360) indicating north, 
90 east, and so on. For any location in the map area, these two 
rasters tell you how far you are from the closest road and what 
direction you would have to travel to get there.  
Chapter 10 introduced polygon buffers. A distance raster can 
be used to create raster buffers in the form of a Boolean raster 
with 1 inside the buffer and 0 outside it (Fig. 11.33). The 
Raster Calculator is a quick way to produce it. Imagine we 
want buffers showing areas within 300 meters of the roads. 
18Î Open Spatial Analyst > Map Algebra > Raster 
Calculator. 
18Î Enter the expression “roaddist” <= 300. 
18Î Name the output roadbuf300 and save it in 
chap11results. Click OK. 
TIP: The attribute table of a discrete raster tells you how many cells have a given value. Each 
cell has a given area defined by the cell size. You can use this information to calculate areas of 
rasters, where: Area = # cells × cell size × cell size. 
2. Using the cell size (30 meters) and attribute table of roadbuf300, calculate the total area of the 
buffers in square kilometers. __________________________________ 
We can also create multiple ring buffers with rasters. As an example, consider the snail habitat 
again. Because snails tend to get crushed on roads, the best habitat is further away from roads. 
Biologists have determined that the snails rarely travel more than 400 meters during their 
lifetimes. We can rank the habitat based on distance by using 200-meter ring buffers.

19Î Open Spatial Analyst > Reclass > Reclassify. 
19Î Set the input raster to roaddist and the Reclass field to 
Value. 
19Î Click the Classify button. Set the number of classes to four. 
19Î In the Break Values box, click the first entry and 
change it to 200. Change the next two to 400 and 600. 
19Î Set the last break value above the maximum, 9400. 
19Î Click OK to close the Classify window. 
19Î Make sure that the New values in the Reclassify tool go from 1 to 4, as shown here. 
19Î Name the output ringbuf200 and save it in chap11results. Click OK. 
Now we have a raster with 1 signifying the least desirable distance and 4 the best. Let us multiply 
the ring buffers with the snail habitat raster. Recall that habitat has a value of 1 and non-habitat a 
value of 0, so multiplying by ringbuf200 will yield a new raster with values from 1 to 4, but only 
in the snail habitat.  
20Î Use the Raster Calculator or the Times tool to 
evaluate the expression: 
 
“snailhab” * “ringbuf200” 
20Î Name the output disthabitat and save it in 
chap11results. 
20Î Turn off all layers except disthabitat and roads. 
20Î Change the color scheme of disthabitat so that 1 
is red, 2 orange, 3 yellow, and 4 green (Fig. 11.34). 
This map might raise new concerns, because very little of the 
habitat lies in the safer regions away from the roads. 
It is important to note that the classified display of a distance 
raster (Fig. 11.32a) looks similar to buffers, but do not be 
fooled. A distance raster contains continuous distances, 
whereas a buffer raster contains discrete values of 0 or 1. You cannot create buffers by changing 
the symbology of a distance raster. Even though it may appear to give you buffers, the values are 
still distances. 
21Î Compare the legends and rasters of the ringbuf200, roadbuf300, and roaddist layers. 
Nor can you create buffers using the maximum distance feature in the Euclidean Distance tool. 
This is a common misconception. 
22Î Open Spatial Analyst > Distance > Euclidean Distance. 
22Î Set the input features to Roads, the output to mindist, and the maximum distance 
to 300. Don’t specify a direction raster; you don’t need it. Click OK. 
22Î Turn off all layers except mindist and roadbuf300. Zoom in and compare them 
carefully. Compare their legends in the Table of Contents as well. 
Fig. 11.34. Snail habitat 
ranked by distance to roads 

Chapter 11 
342 
Superficially, the mindist raster looks like buffers, because only the cells close to roads have 
values. However, the values are distances. The true Boolean roadbuf300 has 1 in the buffer cells. 
To turn mindist into buffers, you would still need to reclassify it. So setting the maximum 
distance does not save any effort, and the output will not work correctly for Boolean overlay. 
Topographic functions 
Topographic functions form an important subset of raster tools that are probably used more than 
any other. They are most often used with elevation data. In this section, we will use them to find 
low-slope, sunny areas as prospective sites to build a winter ski cabin. 
23Î Save the map document and open a new, blank map. 
23Î Save the map with a new name, and save frequently as you work. 
23Î Add the raster mgisdata\BlackHills\Sturgis83\topo30m to the map. 
23Î Set the topo30m symbology to this stretched color elevation ramp.  
You have opened a new document, so check the 
Environment settings. 
24Î Choose Geoprocessing > Environments. Expand the Workspace entry and set the 
Current and Scratch workspaces to chap11results. 
24Î Expand the Processing Extent entry and set the Extent to Same as layer topo30m. 
24Î Expand the Raster Analysis entry and set the cell size to Same as layer topo30m 
(which is 30 meters). Click OK. 
The slope function calculates, in layperson’s terms, how steep the surface is. In mathematical 
terms it calculates the rate of change of the surface. 
25Î Open Spatial Analyst > Surface > 
Slope. 
25Î Set the input surface to topo30m. 
25Î Name the output slope30m and save it 
in chap11results.  
25Î Keep the defaults for the output 
measure (DEGREE) and the Z factor (1) 
(Fig. 11.35). Click OK. 
25Î Turn off the topo30m and examine 
slope30m. 
3. What is the maximum slope of this raster? _________________________________________ 
TIP: From this point onward, only the output file name will be given. Make sure that all output is 
saved in chap11results unless otherwise indicated. 
Let’s find the areas that are flat enough to build a cabin, with slope less than 10 degrees. 
26Î Open Spatial Analyst > Map Algebra > Raster Calculator. 
Fig. 11.35. The Slope tool 

Raster Analysis 
343 
26Î Enter the expression “slope30m” < 10 and name the output lowslope. Click OK. 
26Î Set the 0 values of lowslope to light gray and the 1 value to a nice color. 
To find sunny areas, we need an aspect raster. The aspect is the direction a slope faces—measured 
in degrees from north, with true north being 0 (and 360) degrees, east 90 degrees, and so on. 
27Î Turn off the slope30m and lowslope rasters.  
27Î Choose Spatial Analyst > Surface Analysis > Aspect. 
27Î Set the input raster to topo30m, and name the output aspect30m. Click OK. 
4. The aspect map is automatically colored and labeled according to compass direction. Which 
color indicates a northern aspect? ____________ A southern aspect? ___________ 
Let’s find the areas with a warm southerly exposure, where the aspect is between 130 and 
230 degrees (50 degrees either side of south). 
28Î Open Spatial Analyst > Map Algebra > Raster Calculator. 
28Î Carefully enter this expression, including the parentheses: 
 
(“aspect30m” > 130) & (“aspect30m” < 230) 
28Î Name the output southerly. 
TIP: The parentheses are required to force the calculator to 
evaluate the two conditions (aspect > 130) and (aspect < 230) 
before it executes the Boolean AND (&). 
Now we do a Boolean overlay to find potential cabin sites. 
29Î Use the Raster Calculator or the Times tool to 
evaluate the expression:  
 
“lowslope” * “southerly”  
29Î Name the output cabinsites and click OK.  
29Î Compare your results with Figure 11.36. 
29Î Collapse all legends, and turn off all layers. 
Two other surface functions are worth investigating. The hillshade function creates a raster that 
mimics the illumination of the surface from a light source at a specified direction (azimuth) and 
altitude (zenith angle), both measured in degrees. The result looks similar to what a person might 
see when flying over the surface. 
30Î Choose Spatial Analyst > Surface > Hillshade. 
30Î Set the input raster to topo30m, and name the output hillshd30m. Leave the other 
settings to their defaults. Click OK.  
Compare the elevation and hillshade rasters, and notice how the hillshade brings out fine 
topographic details. It makes an excellent base map. 
Fig. 11.36. Cabin sites 

Chapter 11 
344 
The Viewshed function determines what areas are visible from a set of points. It is used for 
applications such as placing fire watchtowers or determining whether timber clear-cut areas are 
visible from a lookout. We will use it to determine the visibility offered by three fire towers. 
31Î Add the towers feature class from the BlackHills\Sturgis83 geodatabase. 
31Î Open Spatial Analyst > Surface > Viewshed. 
31Î Set the input surface to topo30m, and the observer features to towers. Name the 
output towerview and click OK. 
31Î Save the map document. 
5. Examine the attribute table of towerview. What values does the raster actually store? Use the 
tool Help to determine what the values mean. 
TIP: Notice that, as you accumulate rasters, you have to wait while each draws. For best 
performance, get in the habit of turning off or removing any rasters not currently in use. 
Neighborhood functions 
A neighborhood function examines a target window in a raster and calculates statistics from cells 
in the window. Consider the idea of habitat variety. 
32Î Add the landcover raster from the BlackHills\Sturgis83 geodatabase. 
32Î Open the Symbology properties and change the map type to Unique Values. 
Change the Value field to Covertype and click OK. 
Some areas are homogeneous with only one or two landcover units, but other areas are more 
variable. We can analyze the variety of landcover types in different areas using neighborhood 
functions. Let us calculate the variety of landcover types within a 10×10-cell moving  
rectangle. 
33Î Open Spatial Analyst > Neighborhood 
> Focal Statistics.  
33Î Set the input raster to landcover and 
name the output lcvarfoc (Fig. 11.37). 
33Î Choose a rectangle neighborhood. Enter 
10 cell units for both height and width. 
33Î Select VARIETY for the statistic. 
Click OK. 
33Î These are ordinal data, so change the 
display color scheme to a dichromatic 
color ramp—yellow to blue works well. 
A value of 1 in the lcvarfoc raster indicates that only 
one landcover type is found within a 10×10-cell 
(300×300-meter) area; it is homogeneous. A value of 
9 indicates that nine different types were found. This 
raster gives an objective estimate of landscape 
heterogeneity. 
Fig. 11.37. Focal Statistics 

Raster Analysis 
345 
A block statistics function works much in the same way except that the target window, instead of 
moving cell by cell, moves over to a completely new area each time. 
34Î Open Spatial Analyst > Neighborhood > Block Statistics.  
34Î Use the same inputs as for the Focal Statistics tool, but name the output 
lcvarblock. Run the tool. 
34Î Change the display color scheme to the same one as lcvarfoc. Compare the two 
rasters. Then turn them both off and collapse the legends. 
The neighborhood functions can use different statistics. The focal majority function, for example, 
does a good job of simplifying a raster for conversion to features. This landcover data set was 
generated from raster satellite data, but perhaps you would like a vector version. In its original 
form it would make a complex set of polygons with many tiny spots and stringers, and needs 
simplifying before conversion. The Majority Statistic tool examines the target window and selects 
the landcover value that occurs most frequently. We will use the focal version to get a smoother 
result. The larger the window, the greater the generalization.  
35Î Open Spatial Analyst > Neighborhood > Focal Statistics. 
35Î Set the input raster to landcover and name the output major5. 
35Î Select a 5×5-cell Rectangle window and the MAJORITY statistic. Click OK. 
When simplifying, a smaller rectangle done two or three times usually works better than a larger 
rectangle, so run the majority filter once more. 
36Î Open Spatial Analyst > Neighborhood > Focal Statistics. 
36Î Set the input raster to major5 and name the output major5x2. 
36Î Select a 5×5-cell Rectangle window and the MAJORITY statistic. Click OK. 
To compare the final result, it would help if the colors matched. The landcover raster had a 
colormap stored with it, but it was not transferred to the new raster.  
37Î Open ArcToolbox > Data Management Tools > Raster > Raster Properties > Add 
Colormap. 
37Î Set the input raster to major5x2 and the input template to landcover. Click OK. 
37Î Remove the major5x2 raster and add it again from chap11results to see the new 
colors. Turn off the major5 layer. 
37Î Compare major5x2 (Fig. 11.38b) with landcover (Fig. 11.38a).  
Notice the simpler appearance of the new map. It will convert to polygons more easily. However, 
keep in mind that you have modified the original resolution and accuracy of the data and made 
them more generalized. Keep this in mind when interpreting results based on the new data.  
Converting rasters to features 
Since we’ve done the simplification, let’s go ahead and convert the landcover to polygons. 
38Î Open ArcToolbox > Conversion Tools > From Raster > Raster to Polygon. 
38Î Set the input raster to major5x2 and the field to Value. 
38Î Name the output landcoverpoly and check the box to Simplify polygons. 
(Otherwise, the polygon edges will follow the cell boundaries.) Click OK. 

Chapter 11 
346 
The field you specified, Value, is transferred to the polygon table as an attribute named 
grid_code. Unfortunately, the text field containing the names of the landcover classes, which was 
present in the original landcover raster, was omitted when the neighborhood majority tool was 
run. However, we can copy the field from the original landcover table using a join. 
39Î Open the landcoverpoly table and examine the grid_code field. 
39Î Choose Table Options > Add Field and add a text field called Covertype with a 
length of 25 characters. 
39Î Choose Table Options > Joins and Relates > Join. 
39Î Make sure that the first drop-down reads Join attributes from a table. 
39Î Set the first key field to grid_code, the join table to landcover, and the second key 
field to Value. Click OK. 
 
40Î Right-click the empty Covertype field and choose Field Calculator.  
40Î The names are odd, but enter the second Covertype field name from the landcover 
image (appears as [r_1.img.vat.Covertype]) in the expression box. Click OK. 
40Î Choose Table Options > Joins and Relates > Remove Join(s) > Remove All Joins. 
40Î Examine the newly populated Covertype field and 
then close the Table window. 
40Î Symbolize landcoverpoly using a unique values map 
based on the Covertype field. 
The snailhab raster from the first analysis will serve to demonstrate 
another potential issue when converting rasters to polygons. 
41Î Collapse and turn off all layers. 
41Î Add the snailhab raster from chap11results. 
Notice that the raster has 0 and 1 values. If we convert this raster, 
both 0 and 1 areas will be converted to polygons (Fig. 11.39), even 
though we only want the polygons with 1 values. We must first use 
Reclassify to convert the 0 values to NoData.

42Î Choose Spatial Analyst > Reclass > Reclassify.  
42Î Set the Input raster to snailhab and the Reclass field to Value. 
42Î In the New values box, change the value for 0 to NoData. 
Change the 1 value to 1.  
42Î Name the output snailhab2 and save it in chap11results. 
Click OK. 
42Î Turn off snailhab to better see the new raster. 
 
43Î Open ArcToolbox > Conversion Tools > From Raster > Raster to Polygon. 
43Î Set the input raster to snailhab2, and set the field to Value.  
43Î Name the output snailhab2poly and check the Simplify box. Click OK. 
43Î Examine the polygons. Then save the map document. 
Interpolation and zonal statistics 
Interpolation calculates a raster surface from point measurements. For example, climate stations 
in the Black Hills record precipitation. In between the stations, we don’t know what the 
precipitation is, but we can estimate it at each cell to create a precipitation raster. 
44Î Open the ex_11b.mxd map document. Use Save As to save it under a new name. 
44Î Open the Climate Stations attribute table and examine the fields. This data set 
contains monthly precipitation values in centimeters for 1997, with annual totals. 
44Î Close the attribute table.  
This data set covers a greater extent than the others, and keeping the default cell size at 30 will 
generate rasters with large storage requirements. Nor do we need that much resolution at this 
scale. We will increase the default resolution. 
45Î Choose Geoprocessing > Environments from the main menu. 
45Î Expand the Workspace entry and set the Current and Scratch workspace to 
chap11results again. 
45Î Expand the Raster Analysis entry, set the cell size 
to As Specified Below, and enter 200 underneath it. 
Click OK. 
We will create a raster with an estimate of annual precipitation 
from the Sum field. 
46Î Open Spatial Analyst > Interpolation > IDW. 
46Î Set the input points to Climate Stations and the 
Z value field to SUM.  
46ÎName the output annprecipcm. Keep the defaults 
on everything else (Fig. 11.40).  
46Î Click OK and examine the new raster. 
6. Do you think the precipitation raster is an integer or a 
floating-point raster? _________ Examine its properties to 
check your answer.

TIP: Using interpolation functions properly requires understanding the settings and using them 
appropriately. Spend some time with the Help and/or textbooks when ready to learn more. 
Although we needed all the stations to get the best possible 
interpolation, the estimate worsens farther from the stations. We 
also are only interested in areas inside the watersheds. We can 
extract part of a raster using a mask. A mask works like a clip, 
keeping the areas of interest and assigning NoData to the others. 
Either rasters or polygon features may be used as masks.  
47Î Open Spatial Analyst > Extraction > Extract by Mask. 
47Î Set the input raster to annprecipcm. 
47Î Set the mask data to the feature class Watersheds. 
47Î Name the output precipmask and click OK. 
 
48Î Turn off annprecipcm. 
48Î Symbolize the precipmask raster using the stretched 
method with a green-blue color ramp (Fig. 11.41). 
The Raster Analysis Environment settings include a mask setting. You can specify a mask, and 
every new raster created will have NoData in the space outside the mask area. 
49Î Choose Geoprocessing > Environments and expand the Raster Analysis entry. 
49Î Set the mask to Watersheds and click OK. 
We are doing a hydrology study and wish to calculate the total 
volume of precipitation in each watershed. We start by 
calculating the volume of precipitation per cell. The depth of 
received water in the cell in meters is precipmask* 0.01. The 
area of each cell is 200 × 200 meters. Therefore, V(m3) = 
precipmask (cm) * 0.01 m/cm × 200 m × 200 m (Fig. 11.42).  
49Î Choose Spatial Analyst > Map Algebra > Raster 
Calculator and enter the expression:  
 
“precipmask” * 0.01 * 200 * 200 
49Î Name the output precipvol and click OK. 
The volume per cell ranges from about 16,000 to 35,000 m3. Next, if we add all the cells in the 
watershed, we get the total volume of water in the watershed. Zonal statistics will sum the cell 
volumes in one raster (precipvol) based on zones defined by another raster or feature class 
(Watersheds). In the zone feature class, we must choose an attribute field that holds the unique 
values that define the zones. We will use the field SHEDNAME. 
50Î Choose Spatial Analyst > Zonal > Zonal Statistics (Fig. 11.43). 
50Î Set the input zone data to Watersheds and the Zone field to SHEDNAME. 
50Î Set the input value raster to precipvol.

50Î Name the output shedvolume and set the 
statistic to SUM. Click OK. 
50Î Open the symbol properties of shedvolume and 
give it a light to dark blue color ramp (Fig. 11.44).  
In the output raster, each cell in the watershed contains the 
summed volume over the watershed. The Zonal Statistics as Table 
tool provides an alternative way to calculate and view the totals. 
51Î Choose Spatial Analyst > Zonal > Zonal 
Statistics as Table. 
51Î Fill out the first three boxes as before (Fig. 11.43). 
51Î Name the output table shedvoltable.  
51Î Instead of the single SUM statistic, choose ALL. 
Click OK. 
51Î Open the shedvoltable table and examine the 
statistics for the watersheds. 
The output table lists more information, including the cell count, 
the area, and statistics about the water volumes (min, max, etc.). 
This table could be joined back to the Watersheds layer if needed. 
7. What is the name of the watershed that has the largest volume 
of water? What is the volume? 
_____________________________________________ 
TIP: You can also use zonal statistics on zones defined by points 
or lines. You could calculate the elevation of a set of summits, for 
example, or the average slope of individual streams.

Challenge Problem: My Secret Hideaway  
Imagine that you would like to build a cabin somewhere in the Sturgis area. Develop a combined 
Boolean/weighted index model to evaluate the possibilities. One condition is required: it cannot 
be on National Forest Service land (vegetation layer, OWNER = NFS) (Hint: Create a mask.) 
The other factors can be ranked. The land cannot be too steep; having a southerly aspect is good; 
being close to an existing road is cheaper. It can’t be too close to a stream, but it would be nice 
not to be too far away from one. A forested area is preferable to a meadow, bare rock, or already 
developed land. (Note: You may need to resymbolize rasters after reclassifying them in order to 
see your new assigned values correctly displayed.) 
Create a model design similar to that shown in Figure 11.8, showing the five ranked factors, 
index classes/values, and weights. Capture the final result. Afterward, evaluate your model 
choices. Would you do something differently next time?

Mastering the Concepts 
GIS Concepts 
Chapter 7 presented some basic techniques for creating new features in a feature class. In this 
chapter, we examine additional ways to form and modify features with an emphasis on 
maintaining correct topology during editing. 
Topology errors 
Topology concerns how the features are spatially related to each other. The four types of spatial 
relationships introduced in Chapter 1 included adjacency, connectivity, overlap, and intersection. 
One major goal during editing, other than simply getting features into a feature class, involves 
ensuring the logical consistency of features, in other words, making sure that features are free of 
geometric errors and that their topological relationships are adequate for the purpose intended. 
Some of the topological errors to avoid during editing are shown in Figure 12.1. 
 
Basic topology rules 
  1. Adjacent polygons must share a coincident boundary that is exactly the same for both. There 
are no gaps or overlaps between adjacent polygons.  
  2. Lines should always end on other lines. Failure of two lines to meet is called a dangle. 
Dangles can occur when one line is not quite long enough to meet the other (undershoot) or 
when one line crosses too far over the other (overshoot). 
  3. Lines that intersect should each have a node (endpoint) at the intersection. Lines crossing 
without nodes are termed improper intersections.

  4. Nodes should exist only where three or more lines intersect. A node where only two lines 
meet is called a pseudonode. 
  5. Lines or polygon boundaries should not cross over themselves and form loops. 
  6. There should not be duplicate copies of any points, lines, or polygons. 
Perfectly legitimate exceptions can occur to topological rules. For example, a dead-end street by 
definition does not meet another road and must be a dangle. A highway overpass can cross over a 
street without intersecting it. Polygons showing areas sprayed with pesticide on different dates 
might have gaps or overlaps between them. 
The effects of topological errors can vary. In some cases they are merely a visual nuisance. At 
times they can be a legal liability, such as an overlap between two parcels. In other cases they 
contribute to undesirable outcomes, like the slivers that can be formed during geoprocessing 
operations. In the worst case, they can cause a failure of the data set for its purpose—a street 
network containing improper intersections will not properly route traffic. Each user must evaluate 
the purpose of a data set and establish the topological rules needed. In some cases these rules will 
include more than the six listed previously. However, these six should be considered a basic level 
of integrity to which every data set should conform (not including unavoidable exceptions).  
Topological integrity can be established at the outset by careful editing of features to minimize 
the occurrence of errors. Most GIS software includes tools for ensuring basic topological integrity 
during editing, such as snapping and the Auto Complete Polygon tool discussed in Chapter 7.  
Topology rules and tools 
Even careful editing cannot avoid all topological errors. Moreover, one does not always have control 
over the creation of a data set; one may be stuck with data that were poorly digitized without attention 
to topology. A GIS that is capable of storing topology will generally also possess tools that can be 
used to find errors and fix them. 
Many topological errors are difficult to find by mere inspection; they require software algorithms 
to test and evaluate features at the x-y coordinate level. These tools are generally run on feature 
classes after digitizing is complete. The errors that are found are fixed by additional editing, 
which can create new errors. So the process is repeated until all errors have been found and fixed. 
These routines are extremely important in developing a logical consistency report for the feature 
class metadata. This report describes the procedures used and tests applied to a data set to ensure 
that it meets the topological rules we have listed. 
Some GIS systems contain advanced capabilities for defining topological rules and ensuring that 
they are met. The ArcGIS geodatabase model is one of these. It can create and store a network 
topology, which stores and manages connections between linear features and can be used for 
analyzing flow problems in networks such as roads or a water distribution system. Networks can 
have connectivity rules about how features connect. Feature datasets within geodatabases can also 
contain planar topology, which expands the use of rules to model a variety of topological 
relationships, not just within a single layer but between layers as well.  
One class of rules applies to features within a single feature class. The types of rules available 
vary according to feature geometry. Each of the six topological rules cited above are represented 
by rules such as Must Not Have Gaps, Must Not Have Overlaps, Must Not Have Dangles, and 

Editing and Topology 
353 
Must Not Have Pseudonodes. 
Figure 12.2 shows a planar 
topology in ArcGIS that uses 
these rules to test the topology 
of geology and faults. 
Other rules specify 
relationships between feature 
classes, such as the Must Cover 
Each Other rule that describes 
the relationship between 
counties and states in which 
every bit of the state area must 
belong to a county and no part 
of a county should lie outside the state.  
Figure 12.3 shows typical topological errors occurring between layers. The boundary of the Pine 
Ridge Indian Reservation (stippled area) should match the boundary between Shannon and 
Bennett counties, but it does not. Neither does it match the South Dakota–Nebraska boundary. A 
similar problem was encountered between census tracts and county boundaries at the end of 
Chapter 9 (Fig. 9.28). 
Creating planar topology makes it easier to locate and eliminate boundary errors by using special 
Topology tools while editing. This approach is helpful because many errors are too small to see at 
normal viewing scales—in Figure 12.3 the county boundaries appear to match the state 
boundaries but might not actually do so. Such errors typically occur because data come from 
different sources or because some people do not 
understand or use snapping effectively.  
Using planar topology requires an ArcGIS Standard or 
Advanced license. The tutorial for this chapter includes a 
demonstration of using topology to test for pseudonodes, 
dangles, gaps, and overlaps for users who have the 
appropriate license. However, it is nothing more than a 
brief introduction to an extensive and complex topic. 
Users interested in learning about topology should read 
the appropriate ArcGIS Help files. 
Users with an ArcGIS Basic license have limited tools for 
working with topology and must take responsibility 
during editing to keep features as correct as possible. 
Editing complex polygon shapes 
Some map types, such as geology and soils, have a complex interweaving of different units. It 
takes some forethought and planning to efficiently create polygons with correct topology. 
Experience digitizing such maps is the most effective way to learn appropriate techniques and 
avoid common mistakes. When planning, the key constraints to remember are:

¾ A line created with the Cut Polygons tool must start and end outside of an existing 
polygon selection. 
¾ An island polygon requires creating a separate feature, which will then overlap the larger 
polygon underneath. The overlap must be corrected afterward by clipping. 
Consider the geology map shown in Figure 12.4. It would 
be easy to get “painted into a corner” and not be able to 
finish the sequence of polygons. For example, if one 
digitized polygons 2 and 5 first, polygon 3 would be a hole 
that would be a nuisance to fill. An island polygon, such as 
13, cannot be created by the Auto Complete Polygon tool 
because it lies completely inside another polygon. It must 
be added after the polygon around it, which causes it to 
overlap the existing polygon underneath, violating a 
topology rule. The following are two ways to approach the 
editing. Both methods should help avoid gaps and overlaps 
and result in topologically correct polygons. 
Divide and conquer 
Divide and conquer starts by digitizing the outline of a large area, such as the square outline of 
this map (Fig. 12.4). The Cut Polygons tool is then used to carve out polygons from the larger 
region. One might start with polygons 1, 2, and 6 (creating a fake boundary between 6 and 7b that 
goes through 5). Then create 7 as a single unit, 8 as a single unit, and 9. Finally, use Create New 
Feature to create 5, 10, 11 to 13, and the remaining islands on top of the larger units. After 
creating each island, the Clip command (discussed in the next section) is used to eliminate the 
overlap with the larger polygon underneath. Occasionally with this method one is forced to create 
a superfluous boundary within a polygon, and then merge the two pieces afterward. 
Adding territory 
Adding territory relies mainly on the Auto Complete Polygon tool. One might start with Create 
New Feature to create polygon 1. Switch to Auto Complete Polygon and add 2 and 3. Add 4, 
temporarily closing the narrow neck between it and 6. Add 5 and 6. Go back and merge 4 and 6. 
Add 7a and 7b, leaving a hole where 10 is. Add 11 and 12 using Auto Complete. Add 8a, 8b, and 
9. Finally, close off 10. Go back to Create New Feature and create 13, making sure to clip out the 
underlying polygon area beneath it. 
Combining features 
During editing, especially when editing complex shapes, creating a single feature at a time is 
sometimes not practical. We mentioned that creating island polygons generates an overlap with 
the polygon around it. Occasionally it is easier to create a polygon in two or more pieces, after 
which they must be combined. During editing, several useful techniques can aid in maintaining 
correct topology. The editing functions are similar to the geoprocessing tools, such as Clip and 
Intersect, but they operate on selected features, rather than on entire layers. Moreover, the 
attributes are treated differently. Instead of combining all the attribute fields from both inputs, the 
output feature simply has the same attribute fields as the layer being edited. 
When using these combinations, the user should be sensitive to how attributes of the features are 
handled. In the case of a merge, a union, or an intersect, the resulting features will be given the 
attributes of one of the original features. In a geodatabase, the attributes of the feature selected

FIRST will be copied to the output feature. For shapefiles and coverages, the feature with the lowest 
feature-ID will be copied. If the feature attributes matter, then the user must pay attention to which 
attributes are being copied and must correct any attributes that were not copied as desired. 
Merge 
A merge takes two or more features and combines 
them into a single feature (Fig. 12.5). If the 
features are adjacent, then the boundaries between 
them are removed. If the features are separate, 
then a multipart feature will be created. This 
function might be used frequently to update a 
parcels map when an owner has purchased two 
adjacent parcels and combined them into one. It is 
also useful when one finds it easier to digitize a 
feature in two or more pieces and then combine 
them afterward. 
Union 
A union performs the same operation as a merge, except that the original features remain 
unchanged and a new feature is created in addition to the originals. 
Intersect 
An intersection creates a new feature from an area common to 
both original features (Fig. 12.6). A new feature is created, and 
the original ones are maintained. If two features are selected and 
an intersection is performed, the resulting new polygon will 
consist only of the areas shared by the original polygons. The 
new feature is created in addition to the original features, which 
are not changed or deleted. This function might be used to 
identify repeat infestations of pine bark beetle attacks. Two 
features representing infestations in two different years could be 
intersected to reveal the area attacked twice. 
Clip 
A clip behaves in a cookie-cutter fashion. If one 
feature lies over another, the underlying feature 
will be cut along the boundaries of the overlying 
feature (Fig. 12.7a). Two options may be 
specified, preserving the area common to both 
features (Fig. 12.7b) or discarding the area 
common to both features and retaining what is 
outside the clip polygon (Fig. 12.7c). In either 
case, the feature used for clipping is retained 
unchanged, and the feature underneath is 
modified. As shown in Figure 12.7c, clipping is 
one way to create a “donut” polygon. Clipping is 
useful anytime a polygon must have internal 
boundaries, such as a residential area with a park in the middle. It is also useful for creating an 
island polygon inside another. Clipping is crucial to enforcing the “must not overlap” rule by 
removing sections of a polygon that lie underneath another polygon.

356 
Buffering features 
A buffer delineates the area within a 
specified distance of a feature and can be 
created from points, lines, or polygons 
(Fig. 12.8a–c). The output may be lines 
or polygons. The buffer distance must be 
specified in map units. In the case of 
buffering polygons, a negative distance 
may be used to reduce the size of the 
feature (Fig. 12.8d). Buffers are useful 
for such tasks as identifying setbacks 
from parcels, finding drug-free zones 
around schools, or creating road widths 
from a set of centerlines. 
Stream digitizing 
Two methods can be used to place vertices for lines and polygons. So far you have used the 
point-by-point method in which each vertex is placed with a click (Fig. 12.9a). Stream digitizing 
offers another approach. The user chooses a tolerance that controls how far apart each vertex 
should fall. The first vertex is added with a click. Then the user smoothly moves the mouse 
pointer over the line to be digitized. Each time the tolerance distance is traversed, a new vertex is 
added automatically (Fig. 12.9b). Stream digitizing can be 
faster than point-by-point digitizing, but it does have 
some drawbacks.  
First, in point-by-point digitizing the user adds only as 
many vertices as needed. Straight edges require fewer 
vertices and curved edges need more closely spaced 
vertices. In stream digitizing, one tolerance is used for 
both. Thus, straight lines often have more vertices than 
needed and may not be as straight, and curved sections 
may not have enough vertices. As a result, the features 
may be less accurately captured. Furthermore, the file size 
is often larger due to the extra vertices. The choice of 
stream tolerance is critical for good results.  
Second, when creating a line point by point, the user can place a vertex exactly on the inflection 
points of the feature to capture the shape with greatest accuracy (Fig. 12.9a). In stream digitizing, 
the vertex falls when it reaches the set tolerance and may be offset from the actual inflection. 
The third problem is that a slight movement off the line will create unwanted vertices that must 
be cleaned up later. A steady hand is required for stream digitizing. In Figure 12.9b, the sketch 
shows three places where the curve deviates from the feature being digitized (arrows). 
Most users find that they develop a preference for one kind over the other. The style of the 
features being digitized affects the choice as well. Feature classes with many long, straight lines 
and sharp corners will be much more efficiently digitized using the point-by-point method. 
Feature classes with many smooth curves can benefit from stream digitizing. It is also possible to 
switch back and forth between styles while digitizing a single feature, using stream for curved 
sections and point-by-point for straighter sections. A tablet-type computer with a touchscreen and 
pen are highly effective for stream digitizing.

About ArcGIS 
We now turn to a discussion of some additional tools and techniques for editing in ArcMap. 
Changing existing features 
Once a polygon or line has been created, it can be changed by eliminating unwanted vertices, 
adding vertices, or moving existing vertices. Other modifications include flipping lines, trimming 
them, extending them, and performing a variety of other editing functions. These functions are 
useful for cleaning up errors from stream digitizing. 
Modifying features 
The Editor toolbar contains an option to modify existing 
features by adding, deleting, or moving vertices. The Edit 
Vertices tool causes the sketch of the feature to appear. 
When the edits are complete, the feature is updated to the 
current form of the sketch. Figure 12.10 shows how an 
original, circular polygon is modified by moving vertices 
in the sketch.  
Reshaping features 
The Reshape Feature tool reenters a feature or a portion of a feature by using a new sketch to 
define the revised shape. The sketch must start and finish exactly on the original feature, so it is 
helpful to have vertex or edge snapping on. When the sketch is finished, the original feature is 
modified to follow the sketch. Figure 12.11 shows how to reshape parts of lines and polygons. 
 
Flipping lines 
Although we are generally not aware of it, lines have a direction, beginning at a “from” node and 
ending at a “to” node, which is established according to the direction in which the line is initially 
digitized. Normally the direction of a line generates little concern, and either direction works just 
as well. In some situations, however, the direction matters. In geocoding, it matters because it 
defines which way the addresses increase along the street. A streams feature class used for 
network analysis uses the line direction to encode the flow of 
water. A similar situation would hold for constructing a 
network of water pipes or sewers in which the direction of 
flow must be constrained and recorded. 
The direction of lines may be viewed by drawing them with 
arrow-ended symbols. Once drawn, you can see the direction 
of flow and flip the direction, if necessary (Fig. 12.12).

Editing with map topology 
Building planar topology with rules for a feature dataset and using it during editing requires an 
ArcGIS Standard or Advanced license. However, users with ArcGIS Basic licenses or users who 
are editing shapefiles can use a function called map topology to edit features with shared edges 
or vertices. Map topology creates temporary relationships between features so that they can be 
edited together. Its purpose is to preserve existing coincident boundaries and nodes. 
Topological editing uses a cluster tolerance to help enforce snapping and coincident boundaries. 
When two vertices of features being edited fall closer together than the cluster tolerance, the 
vertices are made coincident. Setting the cluster tolerance requires great care. If too large, it will 
change coordinates unnecessarily. If too small, it does not help prevent topological errors. 
However, it is better to err on the side of too small than too large. The default tolerance is 
designed to preserve the accuracy of features rather than do extensive corrections and should be 
used unless you have reason to do otherwise.  
The user creates map topology by selecting which feature classes will participate in it. The 
topology is created on-the-fly for the set of features currently in the data view. The endpoints of 
lines are called nodes, and lines or polygon boundaries are called edges. The user selects the node 
or edge to be edited using the Topology Edit tool, which is similar to the regular Edit tool, except 
that it selects shared edges or nodes for editing. When the Topology Edit tool is used to select a 
feature or part of a feature, all features sharing that boundary are also affected by the edits. 
Figure 12.13 shows the use of the Topology Edit 
tool and the Reshape Edge tool to change the 
boundary between two polygons. First, the shared 
boundary is selected using the Topology Edit tool. 
The selection color of the Topology Edit tool is 
purple to distinguish the selection from those made 
with the Edit tool. The Reshape Edge tool is then 
used to draw the new boundary between the 
polygons. When the sketch is finished, the new 
boundary replaces the old one, and the change is 
applied to both polygons. 
The Topology Edit tool is also convenient when 
working with connected line features, 
such as roads. If one road node is 
moved, the roads attached to the node 
move also. In Figure 12.14, the road 
node was selected with the Topology 
Edit tool and then moved downward. 
The attached vertices of the other lines 
are also moved when the sketch is 
finished. In Figure 12.14, only the 
node is moved, causing kinks in the 
attached lines. For smoother 
adjustment, one can turn on an option 
to adjust the attached lines 
proportionally.

Editing and Topology 
359 
The Topology Edit tool and other topology editing tools should always be used for editing a map 
topology. They can be applied to moving features, reshaping them, and modifying them. 
However, the map topology must be created prior to using the topology tools.  
Editing with planar topology 
With an ArcGIS Standard or Advanced license, feature classes within a feature dataset may be 
assigned to participate in a planar topology. The topology is created in ArcCatalog, and specific 
rules are invoked concerning the desired topological relationships. Once the rules are defined, 
validation is performed to assess adherence to the rules. Errors are found and marked during the 
validation process. Afterward, the user can view the errors and use specialized tools to fix them. 
The available rules vary depending on what type of feature 
(points, lines, or polygons) they govern and whether they 
apply to a single feature class or to relationships between 
two feature classes. Figure 12.15 shows the rules that 
could be applied to lines (above) or polygons (below). 
The topology is assigned a cluster tolerance when it is 
created. The cluster tolerance is the minimum distance 
allowed between vertices. During validation, if two or 
more vertices lie within the cluster tolerance, they will be 
snapped together. 
By default, the cluster tolerance is the same as the feature 
class XY tolerance, or 0.001 meter. This value is 
designed to preserve coordinate accuracy. If the default is 
accepted, then virtually no vertices will be snapped 
together. Yet it is often desirable to set the cluster 
tolerance to a larger value, because then the topology can 
fix some errors automatically. The cluster tolerance 
should never be less than the XY tolerance. 
Choosing the cluster tolerance can be tricky. Both the 
resolution of the data set and the size of the typical errors 
must be considered. If the tolerance is too small, then all 
edits must be manually done. If too large, it can degrade 
the data set accuracy. Imagine a road data set collected by GPS from a truck, with vertices 
collected every 25 meters. As lines are stopped and started at intersections, an offset of 3–5 
meters typically occurs. These data are then placed in a topology. If the default cluster tolerance 
of 0.001 meter is employed, then none of the ends will be snapped, and each intersection must be 
edited manually. However, if the cluster tolerance is set to 6 meters, then most of the road 
intersections will be snapped automatically, leaving far fewer errors to edit. Since vertices are 
normally 25 meters apart, the cluster tolerance will not collapse actual measurements together.  
During validation, several processes occur. First, cracking places an extra vertex on edges that 
fall within the cluster tolerance of another edge, vertex, or end, and then clustering collapses the 
vertices together. It is important to realize that the validation step can move the vertices of 
features from their original locations. Users can specify ranks for the different feature classes. 
Lower-ranked features will be moved to match higher-ranked features. If features have equal 
ranks, then both sets of vertices may be moved. 
Fig. 12.15. Rules for lines (above) 
and polygons (below)  

Chapter 12 
360 
TIP: Because validation can change locations of features, it is vitally important that a backup 
copy of the data be established before validating, in case of an error specifying the cluster 
tolerance or rules. 
The validation produces a topology feature class that contains point, line, and polygon errors, 
which may be drawn and symbolized during an editing session. Figure 12.16 shows some 
topology errors for the Edwards aquifer geology and 
faults. The pink boxes indicate point errors; the pink line, 
a line error; and the red outline a polygon error. 
The user examines and fixes the identified errors singly or 
in batches, as appropriate. Unavoidable errors, such as the 
dangles that occur where a fault ends, are marked as 
exceptions. Each type of error has different possible fixes 
that can be applied. Dangles may be snapped, extended, 
or trimmed. A gap must have a feature created to fill it. 
An overlap must have the overlap area removed. 
TIP: There is an excellent summary of topology rules and 
error fixes in ArcGIS Help. Search for “topology error 
fixes” and select “Geodatabase topology rules and 
topology error fixes.” 
After all errors are found and fixed, the user must validate again. Often fixing one set of errors 
produces new ones. The process of validating, editing, and validating again must be repeated until 
no new errors are found.  
Summary 
¾ Careful editing helps create and maintain topological integrity between features. Topological 
rules establish requirements for feature adjacency, connectivity, overlap, and intersections. 
¾ Planar topology establishes rules about the spatial relationships within and between layers, 
and it can be used to help locate and eliminate errors.  
¾ Strategic planning helps when digitizing complexly arranged polygon feature classes. 
¾ Features may be combined to create new ones using merge, union, intersect, and clip. Care 
must be taken to ensure that attributes are correctly copied during these transactions. 
¾ New features can be created by buffering points, lines, or polygons. 
¾ Stream digitizing can help create smooth curved boundaries, but it has some drawbacks. 
¾
Modifying and reshaping are two ways to change existing features.
¾ Temporary topological relationships, called map topology, may be used when editing with an 
ArcGIS Basic license, allowing features that share vertices or boundaries to be edited 
simultaneously with the Topology Edit tool.

Mastering the Skills 
Teaching Tutorial  
The following examples provide step-by-step instructions for doing basic tasks and solving basic 
problems in ArcGIS. The steps you need to do are highlighted with an arrow Î; follow them 
carefully. Click on the video number in the Video Index to view a demonstration of the steps. 
1Î Start ArcMap and open ex_12a.mxd in the mgisdata\MapDocuments folder. 
1Î Add the geology layer from the mgisdata\Austin\Edwards geodatabase created in 
Chapter 7.  
1Î Use Save As to rename the document and remember to save frequently as you work. 
Editing complex polygon topology 
Digitizing separated buildings as polygons offers no special challenges, but interlocking polygons 
require experience and planning to avoid dead ends and ensure proper topology.  
2Î Give the geology layer a unique values symbology based on the Unit field. 
2Î Change the symbols so that Kkd is bright pink, Kkbn is purple, and Kgru is brown, 
as they are in the scanned map. 
2Î Use the layer properties Display tab to make the geology layer 30% transparent. 
2Î Give the geology layer 10-pt. bold labels based on the Unit field. 
 
3Î Choose Start Editing from the Editor toolbar. 
3Î Choose the Edwards geodatabase as the workspace to edit. 
3Î Open the Attributes window and dock it beneath the Table of 
Contents. 
If the unique values geology map is made before starting to edit, then three edit templates should 
be created, one for each unit. If they were not created, then create them now by adapting the 
instructions in Steps 57–58 of Chapter 7. 
3Î Zoom in to the pink and purple 
nested polygons near A in 
Figure 12.18, so that they fill the 
screen. 
Nested polygons create a challenge because 
creating them can produce overlaps. These aren’t 
fully nested because they share a boundary, so 
the Cut Polygons tool will work. 
4Î Click the Kkbn template and digitize 
around the outer purple polygon.
 
5Î On the Editor toolbar, click the Cut 
Polygons tool. The first polygon must 
still be selected.

5Î Starting outside of the shared upper boundary (#1 in 
Figure 12.19), digitize around the pink polygon, ending 
outside again at #2. Double-click to finish. 
Now both polygons are selected.  
5Î In the Attributes window, click one of the polygons to 
flash it. Make sure that the Unit code says Kbn for the 
outer polygon, and type Kkd for the inner one. 
The floating toolbar and solid polygon that may appear during 
digitizing are annoying. You can turn these off. 
6Î Choose Editor > Options and click the General tab. 
6Î Uncheck the box to Use symbolized feature during 
editing, and uncheck the box to Show feature 
construction toolbar. Click OK. 
Notice the tiny pink island in the purple polygon. It is almost too small to digitize, but it 
illustrates an important point. It is entirely enclosed by the purple polygon, so we cannot use the 
Cut Polygons tool as we did last time. We must create a new feature.  
7Î Click the Kkd template and digitize around the pink island polygon. Finish the 
sketch. The new polygon should be highlighted. 
7Î Turn off the EdwardsCrop map image for a moment. 
7Î Click the Edit tool and click inside the new polygon, and drag it away from the other 
polygons. Notice that the purple unit underlies it.  
7Î Choose Edit > Undo Move from the main menu bar. 
The new feature rests upon the old one like the top layer of a cake, creating an overlap. We must 
use Clip to delete the overlapping area. 
8Î While the new polygon is still selected, choose Editor > Clip from the Editor toolbar. 
8Î Make sure that the button is filled to Discard the area that intersects, and click OK. 
8Î Drag the new polygon away from the others again, noting that there is now a hole.  
8Î Choose Edit > Undo Move from the main menu bar. 
8Î Turn the image back on again. 
8Î Choose Bookmarks > Main Area from the main menu bar. 
Although you might be tempted to digitize the next group of nested polygons north of the fault, 
an experienced editor would realize that it would produce a problem connecting the two groups. 
You usually want to continue using Auto Complete rather than starting new polygons. 
9Î Zoom in to polygons B and C below the nested ones, shown in Figure 12.18. 
9Î Click the Kkd template and select the Auto Complete Polygon construction tool from 
the lower panel of the Create Features window. 
9Î Digitize polygon B, taking care to snap to the vertices of the adjacent polygon. 
9Î Choose Editor > Save Edits. Also save the map document.

Stream digitizing and section editing 
Point-to-point digitizing gives the best control, but some people prefer stream digitizing. Let’s try 
it on the next polygon. 
10Î Choose Editor > Options and click the General tab. 
10Î Set the Stream tolerance to 100 map units to start with and click OK. 
10Î Click the Kkd template and choose the Auto Complete Polygon tool. 
10Î Enter the first vertex of polygon C, snapping to the lower-left corner of polygon B. 
10Î Right-click off the sketch to open the Sketch menu. Choose Streaming. 
10Î Enter the next vertex to start streaming. Then move the cursor, without clicking, 
along the boundary of the polygon. Notice how closely spaced the vertices are. 
10Î Right-click and choose Delete Sketch. 
The initial stream tolerance was too small, producing more vertices than needed and increasing 
the file size. Let’s try a larger tolerance. 
1. If you planned to create topology for the geology, what size should the cluster tolerance be 
relative to the stream tolerance? ____________________________________________ 
11Î Use Editor > Options to set the Stream tolerance to 300 map units. 
11Î Click on the vertex of polygon B to start. Streaming is still on, so you will begin 
streaming after that first click. Go all the way around, even if you mess up. 
11Î End by snapping to the lower-right vertex of polygon B. Double-click to finish. 
Chances are that your polygon has wobbles in it. Stream digitizing takes some practice. Notice 
how many vertices were entered. They serve an important purpose on the curve edges but are 
more than needed on straight edges along the faults. You can switch back and forth between 
stream and point modes during a single sketch using the F8 function key. 
12Î Click the Delete key to delete the streamed polygon. 
12Î Click on the starting vertex again, and then click the F8 key to turn streaming off. 
12Î Digitize the straight edge along the fault, using only the vertices you need. 
12Î At the corner where the contact leads away from the fault, pause and press F8. 
12Î Click once to start streaming, and then move the cursor along the boundary, 
pausing when you get to the lower fault. 
12Î Press F8 to stop streaming. Enter the straight boundary along the fault. 
12Î Press F8 to start streaming again and digitize the contact between the faults. 
12Î When you get to the upper fault, press F8 to stop streaming. Digitize the remaining 
vertices and finish the sketch. 
TIP: If your computer has no function keys, you must turn streaming on and off by right-clicking 
to open the Sketch menu. Streaming works wonderfully with a tablet pen instead of a mouse. 
Chances are that, even with this new method, you will see spots where your streaming wandered 
from the actual boundary. This is a good place to learn about the Edit Vertices tool. 

Editing and Topology 
365 
13Î Make sure that the new polygon is still selected. 
13Î Click the Edit Vertices tool from the Editor menu. 
13Î The sketch returns, showing the individual vertices. 
13Î Hover over a vertex. The cursor changes to a little box, allowing you to click and 
drag the vertex to a new location. 
13Î To add a vertex, right-click a segment between vertices and choose Insert Vertex 
from the context menu. 
13Î To delete a vertex, right-click it and choose Delete Vertex. 
13Î Edit the vertices until you are satisfied. Then right-click on the sketch and choose 
Finish Sketch. 
Streaming is faster but not as easy to control. Let’s try another one. 
TIP: If you forget that streaming is on and mess up the start of a polygon, just right-click and 
choose Delete Sketch so you can start over. 
14Î Pan, if necessary, so that you can see all of purple polygon D.  
14Î Click the Kkbn template. Choose the Auto Complete Polygon tool. 
14Î Start on the lower corner of the Kkd polygon just finished, on the fault. 
14Î Snap the first vertex and enter more vertices along the fault (with 
streaming off). 
14Î Turn streaming on at the end of the fault portion, and stream your way around. 
14Î At the end, click the mouse to snap to the corner vertex of polygon B. 
TIP: When using Auto Complete with streaming, always click once on the snap point at the end 
to ensure that the polygon actually closes. 
Sometimes you stream well around most of the polygon but have a poor section that you would 
like to fix without having to redo the entire polygon or edit each vertex. The Reshape Feature tool 
is perfect for this task. Consider the southern end of polygon C. Imagine that you would like to 
reenter just the portion between the faults. 
15Î Click the Edit tool on the Editor toolbar and select polygon C.  
15Î Pan/zoom in to the section to be edited so that you can see it clearly. 
15Î Choose the Reshape Feature tool from the Editor toolbar. 
15Î Click on the upper end of the section, being sure to snap to the vertex of the polygon. 
15Î Click F8 to turn streaming off so that you can be careful where you place the 
section vertices.  
It is important to have snapping on to start the new section, because Reshape will not work if you 
don’t start and end exactly on the existing section. However, snapping will probably interfere 
with where we place the new vertices, as some will probably be close to the old ones. 
16Î If the Snapping toolbar is not already open, choose Editor > Snapping > Snapping 
Toolbar. 

Chapter 12 
366 
16Î Click the toggle switches for vertex and edge 
snapping to turn them off. 
16Î Enter the new section of the polygon, pausing 
before you place the last vertex (Fig. 12.20). 
16Î Click the toggle switch to turn vertex snapping 
back on. 
16Î Enter the last vertex of the new section, snapping it 
to an existing vertex. Finish the sketch. 
 
17Î Pan to the other end of polygon C that was 
digitized using streaming. 
17Î Reshape this boundary also, for practice. 
17Î Save your edits. 
Both the Edit Vertices and the Reshape Feature tools are handy for editing part of an existing 
feature. They are useful for fixing problems with streaming but can be used at other times also.  
From this point on, you can choose whether you continue to use streaming. You can use it all the 
time, only for some sections, or not at all, depending on your preference. 
Digitizing by adding territory 
We have been using an “adding territory” approach to digitizing using the Auto Complete 
Polygon tool. We will continue this method for a little longer, even though the polygons are 
getting more complicated. Since we will be using the Auto Complete Polygon tool nearly all the 
time, let’s change the default construction tool for the templates. 
18Î Right-click the Kkd template and choose Properties. Change the Default Tool to 
Auto Complete Polygon (not Auto Complete Freehand). Click OK. 
18Î Change the default tool for the other two templates as well. 
18Î Save the map document, so the 
changes to the templates are saved. 
 
19Î Pan or zoom, as necessary, to see 
all of polygon E (Fig. 12.21). 
Look at polygon E. It is large, so take a moment 
to follow the boundary around so that you know 
where to start and stop. We will use the dashed 
fault on the upper end as a boundary. 
19Î Use template Kkd and the Auto 
Complete Polygon tool to digitize 
polygon E. 
19Î Use Edit Vertices or Reshape 
Feature, if necessary, to fix any 
glaring errors.

20Î Pan or zoom to see polygons F and G, as necessary. 
20Î Click the Kkd template and digitize the pink polygon F. 
2. Why did we choose to do Polygon F next, rather than G? _______________________ 
21Î Click the Kkbn template and digitize the purple polygon G. On the top right edge, 
ignore the fault this time and include the two little triangles with the rest. 
 
22Î Pan/zoom to see polygons H–J. 
22Î Click the Kgru template and digitize polygon H. Note that it stops against polygon I 
at the upper dashed fault, so you don’t need to go all the way around on top. 
 
23Î Click the Kkbn template and digitize polygon I. Go all the way around, leaving the 
pink island of Kkd (polygon J) enclosed in the middle. 
 
24Î Choose the Cut Polygons tool from the Editor toolbar. Start outside, cross the 
shared boundary, and digitize all the way around polygon J to the outside again. 
24Î In the Attributes window, find the inside polygon and change the Unit field to Kkd. 
The last ribbon of brown Kgru is so narrow that it would be easier to digitize it with snapping off. 
25Î Click the Kgru template and enter the first vertex, snapping to the Kkbn polygon. 
25Î Click the toggle switches to turn off vertex and edge snapping.  
25Î Digitize the boundary of the Kgru polygon, stopping before the last vertex. 
25Î Click the toggle switch on the Snapping toolbar to turn vertex snapping on again. 
25Î Enter the last vertex, snapping it to the Kkbn polygon. 
We have been treating the faults as geological contacts because it makes the digitizing easier. 
However, geologists generally do not want faults to separate polygons with like units. We can use 
the Merge command to eliminate false boundaries created by faults. 
26Î Choose Bookmarks > Main Area from the main menu bar. 
26Î Click the Edit tool on the Editor toolbar. 
26Î Select the two pink Kkd polygons at the southern end (B and C). 
26Î Choose Editor > Merge from the Editor toolbar. 
A window appears with both polygons listed. You need to choose one polygon as the host. The 
host will absorb the other one, and all attributes in the host will become the attributes of the 
absorbed polygon. In this case they are equivalent, so it does not matter which you choose. 
26Î Click one polygon in the list, and then the other. The flash tells which is which. 
26Î Click one of them to highlight it, and click OK. 
 
27Î Select the two adjacent purple Kkbn polygons (D and G) and merge them. 
 

Chapter 12 
368 
28Î Select the two adjacent pink Kkd polygons (E and F) and merge them. 
28Î Save your edits. 
TIP: Depending on your software version, you may see the AutoComplete Freehand tool, a new 
addition to the Construction Tools set. Experiment with it if you wish. 
Digitizing by divide and conquer 
Instead of the “adding territory” approach, some people prefer to “divide and conquer.” In this 
method, we digitize the boundary of an area containing many polygons and then cut it up. 
29Î Zoom to the area shown in Figure 12.22. 
29Î Click the Kkd template. 
29Î Use the Auto Complete Polygon tool to 
create the polygon highlighted in  
Figure 12.22, starting at the lower arrow, 
following the boundary along the faults, 
and closing it off against the brown Kgru 
polygon at the upper arrow. 
 
30Î Click the Cut Polygons tool on the Editor 
toolbar. 
30Î Cut out the lowest purple polygon. Be 
sure to start and end outside of the 
“conquer” area. 
30Î After it is done, use the Attributes window to figure out which of the two selected 
polygons is the purple one and enter Kkbn in the Unit field. 
 
31Î Choose the large pink Kkd polygon next to it as the next piece to carve out. 
Remember to snap to or start outside of the polygon that is being cut. 
31Î Make sure the attributes are correct. 
TIP: The polygon to be cut must always be selected before you start cutting. You can turn the 
geology layer off and on if you need to see the colors underneath. 
32Î Continue carving up the “conquer” area. There are various ways to go about it. If 
you need to create extra polygons to get a shape cut out, do it and merge them 
afterward. Try to find the most efficient way that requires the fewest merges. 
TIP: If you end up with an island that does not share a boundary, use the Polygon construction 
tool to create it as a top “layer cake” and then use Clip to remove the overlap. 
33Î When you are done carving, merge any polygons that require it.

Editing and Topology 
369 
34Î Zoom to Bookmarks > Main Area. 
34Î Turn off the EdwardsCrop image so that you 
can see the polygons clearly. They should look 
similar to the polygons in Figure 12.23. 
34Î Save your edits, and save the map document. 
Using map topology to edit polygons 
So far we have demonstrated some techniques for creating 
polygons with logically consistent relationships with a 
minimum of effort—certainly less effort than it takes to fix 
topology errors later. However, creating polygons with 
correct topology is only the first part of the battle. One must 
also be careful that future editing does not introduce new 
topology errors. For this goal, editing with a map topology 
provides the answer. 
35Î Choose Editor > More Editing Tools > Topology. 
The Topology toolbar provides functions for editing topology. First we must create a map 
topology, a temporary topology created on the fly. 
35Î Click the Map Topology tool on the Topology toolbar. 
35Î Check the box to have geology participate in the topology. 
35Î Expand the Options button so you can examine the Cluster Tolerance. Accept the 
default value and click OK. 
The regular Edit tool selects an entire feature for editing. The Topology Edit tool selects a shared 
edge or node for editing. 
36Î Turn the EdwardsCrop image on. 
36Î Zoom in to the nested polygons (H, I, and J) in the central part of the map. 
36Î Find an edge between the nested polygons that could have been more accurately digitized. 
36Î Zoom in closer to the section to be reshaped. 
First we will see what happens when we edit adjacent polygons incorrectly using the Edit tool. 
37Î Click the Edit tool on the Editor toolbar and select one of the polygons next to the 
edge to be reshaped. 
37Î Click the Reshape Feature tool on the Editor toolbar. 
37Î Click to enter the first vertex of the section to be reshaped, snapping to a vertex. 
37Î Turn off vertex snapping and digitize the rest of the section. Turn snapping on 
again to enter the last vertex. Double-click it to finish the sketch. 
Chances are that you introduced a visible gap between the two polygons. You may have also 
created overlaps, although they can’t be seen yet.  
37Î Click the Edit tool again, hold down the Shift key, and select the other polygon 
adjacent to the reshaped edge. 
Fig. 12.23. The final polygons 

Chapter 12 
370 
With both polygons selected, you can clearly see two 
boundaries: the original boundary of the polygons and the 
reshaped edge (Fig. 12.24). The Edit tool selected a 
single polygon feature, and as a result you edited its 
boundary alone, introducing gaps and overlaps. 
37Î Choose Edit > Undo Reshape from the 
main menu bar. 
Now let’s do it properly.  
38Î Click the button on the Standard toolbar to 
clear the selected features. 
38Î Click the Topology Edit tool on the 
Topology toolbar. 
38Î Click on the boundary between the two polygons. It will turn purple instead of blue 
to indicate that it is a selected shared boundary. 
To reshape this time, you will use a different tool. It is similar to the Reshape Feature tool, but it 
works on edges. 
38Î Click the Reshape Edge tool on the Topology toolbar. 
38Î Click the first vertex of the section to be reshaped, as before. 
38Î Turn off snapping, enter the rest of the section, and turn snapping on to add and 
double-click the last vertex. 
 
39Î Click the Edit tool and select both polygons—no gaps and overlaps this time. Clear 
the selected features. 
39Î Find another section that needs reshaping. 
39Î Select it with the Topology Edit tool and reshape it with the Reshape Edge tool. 
Double-click to finish the sketch. 
The Modify Edge tool lets you edit individual vertices along a shared boundary. 
40Î With the boundary selected, click the Modify Edge tool on the Topology toolbar. 
40Î Edit a few vertices; then right-click on the sketch and choose Finish Sketch. 
 
41Î Click the Shared Features button on the Topology toolbar. It shows you which 
polygons share the selected edge.  
41Î Close the Shared Features window and click off the polygons to clear the edge selection. 
41Î Choose Bookmarks > Main Area. 
41Î Save your edits and stop editing. Also save the map document. 
Using map topology to edit lines
Editing roads presents a different set of challenges. 
Î Open the ex_12b.mxd map document from the Map Documents folder. 
Î Save it with a new name and remember to save often as you work. 
Fig. 12.24. Overlaps and gaps

Editing and Topology 
371 
42Î Choose Editor > Start Editing. 
42Î Zoom to the area outlined in Figure 12.25. 
42Î Use the layer properties for Streets to give 
them 10-pt. green labels using the 
STREET_NAM field. 
42Î Zoom in to BRENDA St. 
42Î Turn off all snapping except for end 
snapping.  
Notice that the intersections and centerlines are offset 
from the center of the street. We will try the wrong way 
first to demonstrate what happens. 
43Î Right-click the Streets layer in the Table 
of Contents and choose Selection > Make 
This The Only Selectable Layer. 
43Î Click the Edit tool and select BRENDA 
between MIRANDA and ESTHER. 
43Î Click the Edit Vertices tool on the Editor toolbar. 
43Î Move the vertex at the intersection of BRENDA and ESTHER to the center of the 
intersection. Right-click and finish the sketch. 
Now the BRENDA segment is in the centerline, but the three other segments remain where they 
were. We’ve lost the connection between BRENDA and the other roads. We would have to edit 
the other three segments to match them up again. Map topology makes this editing easier. 
43Î Choose Edit > Undo Modify Feature from the main menu bar. 
43Î Clear the selected features. 
 
44Î Open the Topology toolbar, if necessary, and position it in a convenient spot. 
44Î Click the Map Topology button on the Topology toolbar. 
44Î Choose Streets and Parcels as the layers to participate, and accept the default 
Cluster Tolerance under Options. Click OK. 
 
45Î Open Editor > Editor Options. Click the General tab and make sure that the box is 
checked to Stretch geometry proportionately when moving a vertex. 
45Î Click the Topology Edit tool and click in the intersection of the roads to select the 
junction. If you get an edge, try again.  
45Î Move the Edit tool cursor on top of the junction. The cursor will change to a move 
symbol. Move the junction to the center of the intersection.  
With map topology, all four lines stay attached to the node, which is far easier than editing them 
separately. We will turn end snapping off so it doesn’t snap to the existing location. 
45Î Click the toggle to turn off end snapping on the Snapping toolbar. 
45Î Select the junction at the intersection of BRENDA and DEBORAH and center it. 
 
Fig. 12.25. Zoom to these roads. 

Chapter 12 
372 
45Î Select and center the intersection of BRENDA and HUNTLAND. 
45Î Pan west to ISABELLE St and center its junctions as well. 
Even with the junctions centered, ISABELLE does not follow the street centerline. Its vertices 
need editing. 
46Î Select the lower edge of ISABELLE with the Topology Edit tool. 
46Î Click the Modify Edge tool from the Topology toolbar. 
46Î Edit the vertices to center ISABELLE. You will need to insert a few vertices as 
well as moving existing ones. Right-click and choose Finish Sketch when done. 
That worked, but it was a bit tedious. Reshaping can provide a quicker alternative. 
47Î Pan/zoom to MIRANDA between ISABELLE and BRENDA. Turn on end snapping. 
47Î Select the edge of MIRANDA with the Topology Edit tool. 
47Î Click the Reshape Edge tool on the Topology toolbar. 
47Î Click on the intersection vertex to start, enter the vertices of the new MIRANDA, 
and be sure to snap and double-click to the vertex at the other end. 
This is a good opportunity to show off the capabilities of another Sketching tool. 
48Î Still using the Reshape Edge tool, snap a vertex to one end of 
MIRANDA. 
48Î On the Editor toolbar, click the Sketching tools drop-down button 
and select the Arc Segment tool. 
48Î Click several vertices along MIRANDA and end by snapping to the other vertex 
and finishing the sketch. Smooth curves will be created between each segment. 
 
49Î Zoom out slightly, if needed, to view the entire block of ESTHER. 
49Î Select ESTHER with the Topology Edit tool and reshape it using the Reshape Edge 
and Arc Segment tools. 
49Î Save your edits and your map document, and stop editing. 
The next part of the tutorial requires an ArcGIS Standard or Advanced license. If you do not have 
one, you can stop the tutorial here and go on to the exercises.  
Editing with planar topology (optional) 
In this tutorial, we will see how planar topology can help locate and fix topology errors. Imagine 
that someone has partially digitized the faults and geology of the Edwards aquifer. To create the 
topology, you must put them in a feature dataset. 
50Î Click the New Map File button to start a new, blank map. 
50Î Open the Catalog tab and navigate to your mgisdata\Austin folder. 
50Î Right-click the Austin geodatabase and choose New > Feature Dataset. 
50Î Name it Edwards and click Next. 

Editing and Topology 
373 
50Î Import the coordinate system from one of the feature datasets in the Austin 
geodatabase. Click Next. 
50Î Do not specify a vertical coordinate system. Click Next. 
50Î Accept the default tolerance and resolution values. Click Finish. 
 
51Î In the Catalog tab, right-click the new Edwards feature dataset and choose Import > 
Feature Class (Multiple). 
51Î Navigate to the mgisdata\Austin\Topology folder and select both shapefiles. Click 
Add and OK to start importing. 
TIP: You can’t create a map topology when the participating feature classes are open in ArcMap.  
Now we need to build the topology. 
52Î In the Catalog tab, right-click the Edwards feature dataset and choose New > 
Topology. Click Next. 
52Î Accept the name, Edwards_Topology, and the default cluster tolerance. Click Next. 
52Î Check both boxes so that faultst and geologyt will participate. Click Next. 
52Î The geologyt lines are narrower on the image and therefore more accurate, so rank 
them 1 and the faultst 2. Click Next. 
Next we do the rules. We want to ensure that the geology polygons have no gaps or overlaps. The 
faults should not have pseudonodes unless they join different line types. Faults very close 
together should meet, so we don’t want dangles.  
53Î Choose Add Rule. Select the faultst layer and set the first rule as Must Not Have 
Pseudo Nodes. Click OK. 
53Î Choose Add Rule again. Select the faultst layer and choose the second rule, Must 
Not Have Dangles. Click OK. 
53Î Add a rule that geologyt Must Not Overlap. 
53Î Add a rule that geologyt Must Not Have Gaps. 
When finished, the rules window should look like 
Figure 12.26. 
53Î Click Next and Finish. Click Yes 
when asked to validate the new 
topology. 
 
54Î When it is finished, add the entire 
Edwards feature dataset to the map. 
54Î Choose Editor > Start Editing.  
54Î Choose Editor > More Editing Tools > Topology to open the Topology toolbar, if 
necessary.

We will work on the fault errors first. We can look only at the errors we are working with. 
55Î Turn off the geologyt layer for now. 
55Î Right-click the Edwards_Topology layer and choose Properties. Click the 
Symbology tab. 
55Î Uncheck all boxes except Point Errors. Highlight the Point Errors entry, and choose 
to Symbolize by error type. Click OK. 
The pseudonodes fall into two groups. Some separate a fault with a solid line from one with a 
dashed line and need to be retained and marked as exceptions. The others connect two faults of 
the same type and can be eliminated. 
56Î Create a unique values map of faultst based on the Linetype field, using dashed and 
solid symbols for the respective types. 
56Î Zoom in to the blue pseudonode in location 
A as shown in Figure 12.27. This pseudonode 
connects a dashed and a solid fault and needs to 
be retained. 
 
57Î Click the Fix Topology Error tool on the 
Topology toolbar. 
57Î Click on the pseudonode. It will turn black, 
indicating that it is selected. 
57Î Right-click on the selected error and choose 
Mark as Exception. 
 
58Î Zoom to the full extent of the map and then 
zoom in to the next group of pseudonodes (B). 
58Î Click the Fix Topology Error tool. Hold down the Shift key and select each of the 
four pseudonodes that connect different fault types. 
58Î Right-click one of the selected pseudonodes and choose Mark as Exception. 
58Î Find the pseudonode that connects two dashed faults at an angle. They are the same 
type but are different faults, so mark it as an exception also. 
58Î Leave the pseudonodes joining similar fault types alone for now. 
 
59Î Continue zooming in to each group of pseudonodes, marking the ones that connect 
two fault types as exceptions, until all are marked. 
59Î Zoom to the full extent when done. 
Now that the exceptions are marked, we can automatically fix the others by merging the two like 
faults on either side. The Error Inspector lets you search for and fix errors of a specific type. 
60Î Click the Error Inspector button on the Topology toolbar. It is convenient to dock 
the window to the lower edge of the ArcMap window. 
60Î Set the drop-down to Show: Faultst – Must Not Have Pseudo Nodes.  
60Î Uncheck the box for Visible Extent only. Click Search Now.

60Î Click the top row. Then scroll down to the bottom, hold the Shift key, and click the 
bottom row, so that all are selected. Right-click one of the rows and choose Merge to 
Largest. All pseudonodes should now be gone. 
For the dangles, some simply indicate the end of the fault, and these will be exceptions. Others 
are errors that need to be fixed. 
61Î Zoom to the five dangles at the southwestern end of 
the fault map (C in Figure 12.27). 
61Î Click the Fix Topology Error tool. 
61Î Click on the three dangles that are just the ends of 
faults and select them all.  
61Î Right-click on one error and examine the menu 
choices (Fig. 12.28). Then choose Mark as Exception. 
61Î Zoom to the remaining two dangles in this view. 
 
62Î Use the Fix Topology Error tool to select the lower of 
the dangles that appears to need snapping to the 
adjacent fault. 
62Î Right-click it and choose Snap. Type 500 into the 
box and click Enter. 
The other one might be the end of a fault, or it might need to be connected. We should look at the 
original map to be sure. 
63Î Add the EdwardsCrop.png image from the Austin folder. 
63Î We should connect the fault. Turn off the image until the next time we need it. 
63Î Select the dangle with the Fix Topology Error tool and right-click it. Choose 
Extend and enter 1000 in the box that appears. Click OK. 
 
64Î Zoom in to the next group of five dangles (D in Figure 12.27). These appear to be 
exceptions. 
64Î Click and drag with the Fix Topology Error tool to make a rectangle to select all 
five. Unfortunately, more than dangles are selected. 
We can set the selectable errors to ensure that we get only what we want. 
65Î Click away from the selected errors to clear the selection. 
65Î Right-click the Edwards_Topology layer and choose Properties. 
65Î Click the Selection tab. Uncheck all the boxes except for Select Errors and Must 
Not Have Dangles. Click OK. 
65Î Select the dangles with the Fix Topology Error tool rectangle again. This time only 
the five dangles should be selected. 
65Î Right-click one and choose Mark as Exception.

66Î Continue the process with the rest of the dangles, using one of the error fixes or 
marking them as exceptions. Consult the image if you are not sure which to do. 
TIP: If a Snap or Extend does not work, try entering a larger tolerance in the box. If two dangles 
need to be snapped together, select both and snap instead of trying to do them one at a time. 
67Î Save your edits and zoom to the extent of geologyt. 
67Î Turn geologyt back on and make it 50% transparent.  
67Î Open the Properties for Edwards_Topology again and click the Symbology tab. 
67Î Check the boxes to display the area and line errors as well as the point errors.  
67Î Highlight the Area Errors entry and choose to Symbolize by error type.  
67Î Click the Selection tab. Turn on the check boxes for Must Not Overlap and Must 
Not Have Gaps. Click OK. 
 
68Î Use the Fix Topology Error tool to select the pink line that goes all the way around 
one set of polygons. It will turn black to indicate that it is selected. 
68Î A glance at the Error Inspector panel reveals the type of error. 
The rule is Must Not Have Gaps. The gaps occur because the outer polygons are not touching 
other polygons. This arrangement can’t be avoided—the map has to end somewhere. So this outer 
boundary, and the one around the other polygon group, must be marked as exceptions. 
68Î Right-click the selected black boundary and choose Mark as Exception. 
68Î Select the other outer boundary and mark it as an exception also. 
Now we can concentrate on the smaller errors. 
69Î In the Error Inspector, set the Show box to geologyt – Must Not Overlap and click 
Search Now. Five errors appear. 
69Î Right-click the first entry and click Zoom To. The selected feature is highlighted 
with a black boundary. 
This one appears to be an island error, where the digitizer forgot to clip. The Create 
Feature fix will create a new polygon and remove the overlap.  
69Î Right-click the error and choose Create Feature. It is fixed and disappears from the 
Error Inspector. 
69Î In the Error Inspector window, right-click the top entry and choose 
Zoom To.  
69Î Right-click the error and examine the menu choices for fixing it. 
Subtract will eliminate the overlapping area entirely. Create New Feature will add 
another one on top. The proper solution is to merge the overlap with one polygon or the other. 
69Î Turn on the image to see which edge best represents the boundary. Zoom out a little 
if you need to see more to decide.

69Î Right-click the error and choose Merge. Flash the two polygons in the Merge 
window and choose to merge the sliver with the one that looks like the best choice. 
 
70Î Continue working in the Error Inspector until all of the Overlap errors are fixed. 
 
71Î Change the Show box in the Error Inspector to geologyt – Must Not Have Gaps. 
71Î Uncheck the box to search in the Visible Extent only. 
71Î Click Search Now. You will find four errors. 
Gaps have no polygon covering them. The usual fix is to create a new polygon to fill in the space 
and then merge it with one of the adjacent polygons. 
72Î Right-click the first error and zoom to it. 
72Î Right-click the error again and examine the choices. Then choose Create Feature to 
fill in the space. 
72Î Use the Edit tool to select the filled space and one of the adjacent polygons. Choose 
Editor > Merge. 
 
73Î Fix the other three gap errors using the Error Inspector. You may need to click 
Search Now again in the Error Inspector window after using the Edit tool. 
 
74Î Zoom to the full extent of the map. 
74Î Save your edits. 
74Î Click the Validate Topology in Current Extent button from the Topology toolbar. 
A few new point errors appear, which often happens after validating. You are not really done with 
topology until the validation step produces no new errors. You can fix the new errors now if you 
wish, or do them later. It may take several iterations. 
This is the end of the tutorial.

Mastering the Concepts 
About ArcGIS 
As we have learned, the ArcGIS software has a long history of development, and coverages were 
the first data model used. Later, shapefiles were developed for use in the ArcView package. The 
geodatabase model arrived with the release of ArcGIS 8. The new model offers several 
advantages over both coverages and shapefiles. Like coverages, it can store topological 
relationships between features for added functionality in modeling real-world phenomena, but the 
geodatabase is simpler in construction and more robust in general usage. Like shapefiles, the 
features of a geodatabase are simply constructed and difficult to corrupt, but they provide many 
more benefits than shapefiles. Another advantage of geodatabases over shapefiles is the automatic 
tracking of lengths and areas for features. Geodatabases also provide behavior and validation 
rules that control how features behave, how they can connect, and what attributes are allowed. A 
user can also set up planar topology for features and construct topological rules, such as 
specifying that a state boundary must always match county boundaries or that counties must 
never cross a state boundary. We’ve used feature classes extensively in this text, but this chapter 
describes the feature dataset and the geodatabase capabilities available to users with an ArcGIS 
Basic license. More advanced and powerful features are available to those with an ArcGIS 
Standard or Advanced license; some of these are mentioned as well. 
About geodatabases 
The geodatabase model is constructed on the architecture of standard database systems and can be 
implemented with several commercially available database software packages. Three types of 
geodatabases may be created.  
Personal geodatabases are designed for use by individuals or small workgroups and are stored in 
a single Microsoft Access file. This file is limited to 2 GB in size and works only in the Windows 
operating system.  
File geodatabases are also designed for individuals and small groups, but each data set is stored 
as a separate file within a system folder, and each file can be up to 1 terabyte in size. File 
geodatabases can be accessed by different operating systems and are best for cross-platform 
operations, such as a company that supports Windows, Linux, and Unix computers.  
SDE geodatabases, also known as enterprise geodatabases, store GIS data within one of several 
commercial relational database management systems (RDBMS), such as Oracle®, SQLServer®, 

Chapter 13 
380 
and IBM Informix®. SDE geodatabases are designed to meet security and management needs for 
large data sets accessed by many simultaneous users. Such complex systems are often called 
organizational databases, or Enterprise GIS. For example, at least three groups of users might 
need to edit parcel records in a large city database: the tax department, the city surveyors, and the 
deeds office. Instead of maintaining three sets of data, an ArcSDE geodatabase allows users to 
“check out” certain portions of data for editing and merges the changes back into the central 
database. Potential conflicts caused by simultaneous editing by different users are avoided. An 
additional software package called ArcGIS for Server is required to translate geographic data into 
a consistent and customized format in the large database and share it with large groups. 
Organizational databases have distinct advantages when the spatial data sets are large and/or are 
accessed by many different people. For example, such a system might be developed for the 
planning department of a large city, which may have dozens of people in several departments 
needing access to the information, both for reading and for editing. An enterprise setup allows 
many people simultaneous access to data sets, provides security and permission handling, and 
manages cases of multiple simultaneous editing of the data. It also makes it possible to set up 
version tracking for added data security and protection. 
An additional advantage of ArcGIS for Server is that it allows the administrator to share 
geographic data and geoprocessing tools over the Internet. It can publish data services like those 
found in ArcGIS Online and make data or geoprocessing tools available through web pages or 
mobile devices. It is not easy or cheap to set up an enterprise geodatabase, but it does offer cost 
benefits. For example, it may be that 100% of the employees in your organization need to use 
your GIS data, but 80% of them could perform their tasks using a web interface with a few simple 
tools. Offering this capability on a web page means that you don’t need to buy nearly as many 
ArcGIS Desktop licenses. Many people are discovering productivity perks by moving some of 
their work to tablets or smartphones; now this option is available for GIS data and tools as well. 
However, the additional work in setting up an enterprise geodatabase 
only makes sense when these issues are present. In this chapter, we 
will work exclusively with file geodatabases, but most of the 
commands and functions are the same for the organizational version. 
A geodatabase may contain a variety of objects (Fig. 13.1). Feature 
classes are used to store the spatial information. We’ve used these 
extensively in this book already. Geodatabases may also contain 
rasters, tables, layers, relationships, geometric networks, and feature 
datasets. A feature dataset is a collection of related feature classes with 
the same coordinate system. The oregondata database in Figure 13.1 
contains two feature datasets: Transportation and Water. The Water 
feature dataset has been expanded to show the feature classes, 
including rivers and waterbodies (lakes). The geodatabase also 
contains standalone feature classes such as cities and counties, as well 
as rasters like gtopo1km. In this case, the standalone feature classes 
and rasters share the same coordinate system, but they do not have to.
Geodatabases must be created as empty shells to which feature classes and other database objects 
are later added. Feature classes may be loaded from a variety of sources. Coverages and 
shapefiles may be imported into the geodatabase, either as standalone feature classes or as part of 
a feature dataset. INFO and dBase tables may be loaded. Users may also create empty feature

Geodatabases 
381 
classes and use editing to add features, as we did in Chapters 7 and 12. Rasters, tables, annotation, 
and relationships can also be stored inside a geodatabase. Sometimes new feature classes are 
added to a geodatabase as a result of the operation of a tool or command.  
Many databases are developed by importing shapefiles or coverages of existing data. This process 
is usually straightforward. The entire data set, including features, attribute tables, and coordinate 
systems, is transferred into the database. In the case of coverages, the attribute fields must be 
converted from the coverage field types to the geodatabase field types. This conversion is handled 
automatically, although the user can customize the interpretation of certain fields if desired. The 
user can also request a coordinate system reprojection as part of the transfer process. 
Designing and creating geodatabases 
Good databases do not happen by accident but are the result of careful planning. A project 
database is often accumulated on-the-fly with no terrible repercussions, but a long-term 
repository of data for an organization benefits from forethought. The designer needs to list the 
feature classes to be included and the attributes that they will have. She must decide whether 
feature datasets are needed and how they will be organized, and whether any of them will have 
topology or networks. The designer must decide on coordinate systems, data formats, and even 
what individual feature classes and files will be named. 
It is even important to think through the contents of various attribute fields and decide on content. 
Will street names be all uppercase or a mix of upper- and lowercase? How many different 
categories of buildings are needed? At every step, decisions must be enforced to ensure that fields 
and names are consistent and easily understood. 
Developing a written plan is a must for a good geodatabase. Writing the plan facilitates the 
organization itself, and the written plan serves as a guide to the creator, who may have forgotten a 
particular design decision several months later and needs to look it up, as well as to other workers 
responsible for implementing the design. 
Planning may be done as the task of a single individual or by an entire committee. The most 
important task is to first develop a clear vision of the purpose of the database: what it should be 
able to do and who is going to use it. There is no one way to design a database, but the general 
sequence might follow a process similar to the one listed below. As you perform each step, you 
must continually keep the purpose of the database in mind and ask how each piece will support 
that purpose. As you work through the plan, type it into a document that will serve both as your 
planning guide and a source of documentation once the geodatabase is assembled. 
¾ Define the overall purpose of the geodatabase and its intended users. Determine what 
type of database it will be (personal, file, enterprise), where it will be stored, and whether 
all the equipment and software needed to implement it are available. 
¾ Talk to the intended users, if they are available. Ask them what they expect to be able to 
do, what they must be able to do, and what they would like to be able to do. Then make a 
list of the key tasks that the database should support. 
¾ Define the geographic characteristics. Determine the geographic extent of the area of 
interest and the scale at which most users will spend their time. Decide on a suitable 
coordinate system and projection that will support the intended uses.  
¾ Make a list of feature classes and rasters that are required, and notate them as critical or 
supporting. Start a preliminary organizational diagram, showing the feature datasets you 

Chapter 13 
382 
will have, if any, and how the feature classes will be organized within them. Remember 
that feature classes must be in the same feature dataset to participate in a network or 
planar topology. 
¾ For each feature class and raster, define the specific uses it will support and the required 
scale or resolution it needs. Make a list of the attribute fields that are required, including 
the field types and properties. If subtypes are to be used, list them and create a table 
showing the default values for each subtype. Define whether a planar or network 
topology is required and which feature classes will participate. 
¾ For each feature class, specify where it is to come from. If you have specific sources in 
mind, list them with citations. If they will be developed from scratch, indicate how 
(digitizing from a scanned map, collected using GPS, etc.). 
¾ Create a list of domains to be created for the geodatabase, including the field types and 
lists of all items in coded domains and the upper and lower bounds of range domains. 
¾ Decide what type and level of metadata will be produced and to which standard it will 
adhere. Decide on a process to ensure that the necessary data for producing the metadata 
will be collected and preserved during the data assembly phase. 
¾ If it is a long-term project, develop priorities for which parts of the geodatabase must be 
developed first, and which can wait. Develop a time-line and project goals with 
completion dates. 
Once the plan is fleshed out, then the assembly work can begin. However, no database plan is 
ever a static, finished thing. As the database evolves, the plan can evolve as well, and it should be 
updated accordingly. 
TIP: Designing and creating good geodatabases involve many issues far beyond the scope of this 
book. Users planning to work with geodatabases should read more about them. 
The design and structure of a geodatabase, including the datasets and feature classes, the fields in 
the tables, the standalone tables, the relationship, and other objects, are together termed the 
database schema. The description of all the objects in a geodatabase can be stored and saved 
without any actual data and then reused to generate multiple geodatabases with the same 
structure. This approach offers many advantages for developing large, complex databases with a 
well-designed and tested schema. A city planning department that is relatively new to GIS might 
choose to use a published schema and populate the database with the local information rather than 
trying to design the geodatabase from scratch. Schemas for various industries and applications 
may be downloaded free from the ESRI web site. 
However, using a published schema does not excuse you from planning. A downloaded schema 
may have many more feature classes and capabilities than you can afford to implement. Your 
major tasks will include becoming familiar with the contents of the schema, determining how the 
data will be assembled, and then deciding which portions of the schema will be developed, and 
whether unused portions will be deleted or saved for potential future use.  
Organizing feature classes 
An inexperienced database developer might have difficulty at first in deciding how to organize 
feature classes and what each should contain. Faced with a set of objects to be stored, such as 
interstates, highways, roads, trails, and sidewalks, it might not immediately be obvious whether 

Geodatabases 
383 
these objects should be stored in five feature classes, one feature class, or something in between. 
Moreover, the optiumum design depends strongly on the specific uses to which the data are put. 
An organizational scheme might work very well for one task, but be clunky and difficult for 
another. The designer must take into account the anticipated use of the data and develop a schema 
that will support the most important tasks. 
In general, it is better to keep similar features together in a single feature class, provided that all 
the attributes can be assembled into a single table of fields. For some reason, beginners seem to 
proliferate feature classes, for example, creating a geology map with separate feature classes for 
each geological unit or each quadrangle. This strategy of separation is usually unnecessary. 
Queries make it easy to separate a subset of features from a feature class when it is needed. If one 
wants a map showing only the volcanic rocks, a definition query or a layer selection can 
accommodate that wish. The Select By Location or Clip functions solve the issue of focusing on a 
smaller region.  
When features are stored separately, it is a much harder task to integrate them. It is a nuisance, for 
example, to have to load and symbolize 20 feature classes of different geological units to see a 
single geological map. The Append and Merge tools are valuable but tend to have unsatisfactory 
results unless all the inputs have identical attribute tables; otherwise, attributes may be lost when 
bringing the classes together. It can be tedious work to manually reorganize the data tables so that 
the correct information is ported to the merged table. In addition, gaps and overlaps may be 
generated between adjacent units and will take time and effort to eliminate. 
In short, it is easy to extract the features you want when they are all stored together, but it is 
problematic and time consuming to put separated features together. When in doubt, keep them 
together. You can easily separate them later if needed.  
Creating feature datasets 
A feature dataset is a collection of feature classes that are related 
to each other in some way (Fig. 13.2). For example, a 
transportation feature dataset might contain feature classes for 
roads, railways, airways, and interstates. These features could be 
used to construct a geometric network so that the movement of 
people or goods along the network could be modeled. Similar 
models could be constructed for utilities by using feature classes 
representing water mains, water sources, sewer lines, and 
treatment plants. Feature datasets may also contain planar 
topological relationships between the feature classes, allowing 
for easier identification and correction of errors, such as gaps or 
overlaps between polygons. (See Chapter 12 for a description of 
planar topology.) 
About the spatial reference 
The feature classes in a feature dataset must all share the same spatial reference, which includes 
the coordinate system, the X/Y domain, and the resolution. The coordinate system was discussed 
in Chapter 3.  
The X/Y domain is the range of allowable x-y values that can be stored in a feature class. 
Integers are used because the computer can process them several orders of magnitude faster than 
floating-point values; in the case of SDE databases, they can also be compressed for more

contains related layers with 
a common coordinate 
system. 

Chapter 13 
384 
efficient storage space. The software converts the integers to real numbers on-the-fly when it 
needs them (e.g., when reporting the current x-y cursor location in ArcMap).  
The resolution refers to an underlying coordinate grid to which values are snapped. The units are 
the same as those for the defined coordinate system. A resolution of 0.001 meter in a projected 
coordinate system stores values to the nearest thousandth of a meter. A resolution of 0.000001 in 
a GCS stores values to the nearest millionth of a degree. 
The user chooses the coordinate system for a feature dataset, and the software suggests appropriate 
values for the domain and resolution. The default resolution and domain are determined based on 
the coordinate system chosen by the user and will be fine for most applications. Users requiring 
very high resolution, for example, in laying out a surveying grid, can increase the resolution at the 
expense of a smaller domain. 
Default values 
One advantage of using geodatabases lies in setting 
up default values for attributes. For example, if a user 
is digitizing roads, residential streets (LOCAL) are 
usually the most common type and typically have two 
lanes and a speed limit of 25 mph. The user can set 
default values for each of these fields (Fig. 13.3). 
Then when each road is added, the road type, lanes, 
and speed limit are automatically set to LOCAL, 2, 
and 25, respectively. The information needs editing 
only if the new road differs from the default. A user 
could even set the defaults one way, digitize all the 
local roads, and then close the layer, change the defaults, open the layer again, and digitize the 
next group. This approach saves editing time and helps reduce attribute errors. 
The introduction of editing templates in ArcGIS 10 provides another way to work with default 
values. Different templates can be created for each type of feature, with different default values 
stored in the template.  
Domains 
One great advantage of geodatabases is their tools for helping maintain correct attributes. An 
attribute domain constrains the values that may be entered for a particular attribute. Such 
constraints help ensure correct data entry and keep out incorrect values. For example, imagine an 
attribute field named PipeDiam that contains the diameters of water pipes. Water pipes don’t 
come in an infinite variety of sizes; in fact, a town might use only 1-inch, 3-inch, 6-inch, and  
12-inch pipes. Setting up a domain for the PipeDiam field provides a “pick list” of choices for the 
field and prevents any user from mistakenly entering a 4-inch or 5-inch pipe. These constraints 
can enforce data entry rules in situations when more than one person is entering data and not 
everyone knows or can remember all the rules. The pick lists are also very helpful when entering 
data, whether it is on a desktop computer, in the field on a GPS unit, or in a data collection 
application on a smartphone. 
Domains come in two types. The first type is a range domain, which specifies the lowest and 
highest possible values but lets the values take any number in between. Range domains are 
applicable only to numeric data. For example, a range domain could be applied to a student Grade 
Fig. 13.3. Default values for attributes 
save time during data entry. 

Geodatabases 
385 
Point Average (GPA) field. A GPA ranges between 0 and 4.0. A range domain would allow any 
value between 0 and 4.0 but would exclude negative values or values greater than 4.0. The second 
type is a coded domain, which allows only certain values taken from a list. The PipeDiam 
domain mentioned previously is a coded domain because it allows only four specific values from 
a list: 1, 3, 6, or 12.  
Domains are created and maintained in ArcCatalog as a property of the geodatabase rather than as 
a property of a single feature class or attribute field. Therefore, a domain can be used more than 
once, and it can be used in multiple feature classes. For example, a range domain called Percent, 
which allows values from 0 to 100, could be used in many feature classes whenever percentage 
values were being stored in an attribute. 
Figure 13.4 shows how the properties of a percentage 
domain would be set. The field type is specified as short 
integer. The domain type is range, and the minimum 
value of 0 and the maximum value of 100 are entered. A 
domain can also have split and merge policies assigned 
to it, which we will cover in the next section. 
The field type of the domain must always match the 
field type of the attribute to which it will be assigned. 
(See Table 6.1 if you need a review of field types in 
ArcGIS.) Thus, a short integer domain can be used 
only with a short integer attribute field and not with a 
long integer or float field. Users must pay careful 
attention to the fields for which the domain is 
intended in order to select the appropriate field type 
for the domain. If a database had some fields that 
stored decimal percentages and others that stored 
integer percentages, then two different Percent 
domains would need to be created, one with a Float 
field type and one with a Short field type. 
An example of the PipeDiam domain is shown in 
Figure 13.5. The field type is short integer, and the 
domain type is set to coded values. The codes 
themselves are typed in below. The code is the value 
actually stored in the attribute field. The description 
appears in legends and tables during an ArcMap 
session or in a data collection application, providing 
easily understood information to the people working with the attributes. However, the descriptions 
do need to fit well inside the menus and legends, so it is best to keep them short.  
Coded domains provide a valuable way to combine the ease of numeric codes with the luxury of 
understandable text information for people. Land use planning, for example, often uses numeric 
codes to indicate various zoning types, such as 32 = Residential and 14 = Commercial. Numeric 
codes are advantageous because they are less susceptible to typing errors and take less space to 
store. However, it is difficult for people to remember the meanings of many codes. With a coded 
domain, the zoning codes may be stored as integers, but the information presented to the user 
takes the form of the textual description (Fig. 13.6).

Split and merge policies 
Domains offer a way to control the updating of 
attributes during a split or a merge operation. The 
default policy of making copies or entering blanks 
may be overridden by alternate and more useful 
actions. Split and merge policies are associated with 
each attribute domain. Setting up these policies 
correctly can save much time during editing. 
The split policy 
The split policy is applied when a feature is split in two. The policy choices include Default, 
Duplicate, and Geometry Ratio. If Default is chosen, both split feature attributes will contain the 
default value for that field. If Duplicate is used, then both new features retain the value of the 
original feature. If Geometry Ratio is used, then the new value is assigned based on the relative 
size of the original and split features. 
Examine an example of splitting a 
parcel (Fig. 13.7). The Parcel_ID 
field is nominal data, so it is not 
practical to assign a domain. 
Instead, the normal rules for 
splitting and merging features 
without domains would apply. At 
least one of the new parcels will 
need a new number.  
The Area and Value fields use the 
Geometry Ratio policy. The 
proportion of areas in the two new 
polygons is 60-40; thus the 
smaller parcel is assigned 40% of 
the original area and value, and 
the larger parcel is assigned 60% of the original area and value. Finally, the Default policy is 
applied to the Zoning field, again assigning the most common value of R-1. 
In deciding whether to use split and merge policies, one must consider the number of attributes 
involved and the amount of editing that a data layer receives. Setting up and applying domains to 
attributes takes some time and thought. Unless the layers are being frequently edited, the effort 
may not be worth it. When appropriately used, however, domains can save a substantial amount 
of time and prevent many incorrect data entries.  
TIP: A user can cause a field to receive a blank during a split or merge by setting the policy to 
Default and leaving the default value blank. 
The merge policy 
A merge policy in ArcGIS is not evaluated during editing. It exists so that programmers writing 
advanced applications can take advantage of them, but they will not help the average user. Thus, 
only a brief sketch of merging policies is given.

codes to understandable descriptions 

Geodatabases 
387 
By default in coverages or in 
shapefiles, the merged parcel 
will contain the attributes of 
the first feature found in the 
database. In geodatabases, it 
will contain the attributes of 
the first feature selected 
before merging. The merge 
policy overrides this 
haphazard method by 
specifying a different action 
for each field. 
Three different policies may 
be assigned: Default, Weighted Average, or Sum. 
Default works the same way as the split policy. 
Weighted Average assigns the new value based on 
the relative areas of the two features, and Sum assigns 
the sum of the two input features. In Figure 13.8, the 
Zoning field was assigned the Default policy. The 
Area and Value fields would use the Sum policy. 
Subtypes 
Subtypes are another way to facilitate the entry and 
validation of attribute data. A subtype must be based 
on categorical data, and each feature in the class must 
belong to one of the categories. Roads, for example, 
may belong to one of several types, such as interstates, 
highways, connectors, or local roads (Fig. 13.9). On 
the surface, subtypes are not that different from a 
categorical data field. However, subtypes have 
additional requirements and capabilities. 
A subtype must be based on a short integer field that contains a  
numeric code representing each category (1 for interstates, 2 for 
highways, etc.). Like a domain, the subtype also has a text 
description that lets the user see what the code stands for in plain 
words. The subtype essentially defines its own coded domain for the 
feature class. 
Subtypes provide more functionality for a feature class than a simple 
categorical field with a domain, however. You can think of them as 
subfeature classes within a feature class. First, when a data layer is 
loaded into a map, the subtypes are automatically displayed with 
different symbols. When edit templates are created, each subtype has 
its own template created by default (Fig. 13.10). 
One of the most advantageous properties of subtypes is that each 
subtype can have its own default values for attribute fields. In the 
case of the roads, each road type has characteristic values that are 
Fig. 13.9. Subtypes are formal classes of 
features within a layer.

different from those of the other types. A ramp typically has one lane, a local street has two lanes, 
a connector has four lanes, and an interstate has four lanes. Speed limits can also be assigned for 
each type, such as 25 for local streets, 35 for connectors, 65 for highways, and 75 for interstates. 
When a subtype is established, different default values can be specified for each of the types.  
The defaults are automatically entered in the attribute table when new features are created. To add 
local streets, the user would select the Local template and begin adding streets. As they were 
digitized, each street would immediately receive the Local default values: two lanes, 25 mph 
speed limit, and so on. To enter a connector, the user would select the Connector template, and 
subsequently added streets would receive the default values for connectors. Subtypes streamline 
both data entry and the assignment of attributes to features. Occasionally, features may deviate 
from the default values, such as a connector having six lanes, but such exceptions may be 
corrected as needed.  
Subtypes are an intermediate alternative between placing different groups of features into 
different feature classes or keeping them in one feature class and simply having a field that 
distinguishes them. Because subtypes require effort to create and manage, one must consider 
carefully the design question of whether to use them. 
Consider the roads. If one plans to do any network analysis, it would clearly be a mistake to save 
the different road types in separate feature classes. However, the different types have distinct 
differences in other attributes (lanes, speed limits) that make it attractive to be able to assign 
different sets of default values to each road type. Roads are a good candidate for subtypes. 
Next consider census boundary designations: blocks, block-groups, tracts, and so on. These 
certainly seem like different categories of census polygons. However, they cover each other in 
overlapping sets, like a layer of jigsaw puzzles with ever larger pieces. Trying to map or display 
them together in the same feature class might be a mess. Census areas definitely need to be in 
separate feature classes. 
Finally, consider vegetation polygons. Vegetation type is certainly categorical data, but there are 
so many different types of vegetation, generally, that one would need dozens of different 
categories, making it very tedious to construct the subtypes. Moreover, it is unlikely that other 
fields in the feature class would have values dependent on the vegetation type alone, so that there 
is little opportunity to make use of defaults. Vegetation is not a good candidate for subtypes. 
Before commiting to using subtypes, make sure that they have a purpose and will actually aid in 
the construction or use of the geodatabase. Novices tend to overuse them, so always stop and 
consider whether a single feature class with some categories and a domain would not accomplish 
as much or more for the intended use of the geodatabase. 
Geodatabase annotation 
In Chapters 1 through 3, we learned about dynamic labels and creating annotation that exists as 
simple text within a map document. Annotation can also be stored in a geodatabase, in which 
case it can be used in multiple map documents. Annotation feature classes must be modified 
using the Editor.  
Annotation is another type of feature class, like a line or a point feature class, except that it stores 
labels. Like any other feature class, it has an attribute table, and the table stores properties of the 
annotation, such as the text string, the font, the size, and the formatting (Fig. 13.11).  

Geodatabases 
389 
Annotation may be created as standard annotation, where each text string is a standalone feature 
not connected to anything else. Alternatively, it may be created as feature-linked annotation, in 
which the text string is linked to the feature that it belongs to. With feature-linked annotation, 
deleting the feature deletes the annotation, and vice versa. Feature-linked annotation requires an 
ArcGIS Standard Advanced license, but standard annotion can be edited with ArcGIS Basic. 
Creating annotation begins by creating dynamic labels with the desired font size and other 
properties. When the labels are converted to annotation, they are stored in a geodatabase. Labels 
that overlap are stored in the attribute table as unplaced annotation, and they can be accessed and 
placed at another time.  
After the labels are created, editing can modify the location, style, 
and font attributes for each label. Editing annotation is not that 
different from editing other types of features. Annotation has 
editing templates and a variety of construction tools (Fig. 13.12). 
Annotation can be placed horizontally or on a straight line at an 
angle. It can be placed along a curve or set to follow along a 
feature. 
Annotation is always given a reference scale, which is the scale at 
which the labels appear at their assigned size. The user specifies the 
reference scale at the time that the annotation is created. If the 
reference scale is 1:24,000, for example, and the annotation size is 10 pt. then it only appears as 10-pt. 
text when the map is shown at 1:24,000. If the user zooms in, the labels will increase in size; if the 
user zooms out, the labels will decrease in size. Before creating the annotation, users should view the 
map at the desired reference scale to ensure that the font and size selected for the labels are acceptable.

Summary 
¾ A geodatabase is the native data model developed for ArcGIS. It uses commercially available 
standard database formats and technology.  
¾ Geodatabases offer significant advantages over shapefiles and coverages, including simpler 
and more robust implementation, the storing of topology, geometric networks, and behavior 
and validation rules. 
¾ Geodatabases are created as empty containers and then filled with feature classes, feature 
datasets, layers, tables, relationships, and other objects. 
¾ Designing a geodatabase must start with the purpose and intended users, and should evolve 
into a written plan for future reference. 
¾ Feature datasets contain related feature classes with the same spatial reference. The X/Y 
domain specifies the range of x-y coordinates allowed in the dataset, and the resolution 
specifies the underlying grid to which features are snapped.  
¾ Attribute domains define allowed values for attributes in geodatabases. Attribute domains 
may cover ranges of numeric values, or they may have specific coded text or numeric values. 
¾ Domains also have split and merge policies, which define the assignment of attributes when 
features are merged or split. 
¾ Subtypes allow features in a layer to be classified into categorical groups. Each group may 
have its own set of default attribute values. 
¾ Annotation stored in a geodatabase is available for use in many map documents. Standard 
annotation is simply a type of feature, such as a point or a polygon. Feature-linked annotation 
is connected to its feature and is deleted when the feature is, or vice versa.

Chapter Review Questions 
You may need to consult the Skills Reference section to answer some of these questions. 
  1. List three advantages of the geodatabase model. 
  2. What is the function of a geodatabase schema? 
  3. How does a personal geodatabase differ from a file geodatabase and an SDE geodatabase? 
  4. What is the difference between a feature class and a feature dataset? 
  5. Why is a resolution of 0.001 appropriate for a parcels feature class stored in UTM but not for 
one stored in a GCS? 
  6. Can you have a geodatabase that contains one feature dataset in UTM Zone 13 and another 
feature dataset in South Dakota State Plane? Is it good practice to do so? 
  7. You have a forest feature class with polygons showing individual stands of trees. It contains 
the three attribute fields TreeSpecies, CanopyCover, and Acres. TreeSpecies contains the 
dominant type of tree (e.g., ponderosa pine, aspen). CanopyCover gives the percentage of the 
stand covered by tree crowns. The Acres field contains the area of the stand. For each of these 
attributes, list the most appropriate split policy and merge policy. 
  8. For each of the following zoning attributes—Zoning, StreetAddress, Value, and 
PercentImperviousArea—state whether it would be suitable for a domain. If yes, then say 
whether a coded or range domain would be more appropriate. In each case, explain your 
reasoning.  
  9. Domains are set up as properties of a geodatabase rather than as properties of feature classes. 
Why is this arrangement an advantage? 
10. How does one establish a default value for an attribute in a feature class? In a shapefile?

Mastering the Skills 
Teaching Tutorial 
The following examples provide step-by-step instructions for doing basic tasks and solving 
basic problems in ArcGIS. The steps you need to do are highlighted with an arrow Î; follow 
them carefully. Click on the video number in the Video Index to view a demonstration of the 
steps. 
We will build a geodatabase of Rapid City by importing existing data layers from the 
mgisdata\Rapidcity\archive folder. We will start with ArcCatalog, since we have a lot of data 
management to do before we need to use ArcMap. 
1Î Start ArcCatalog and navigate to the mgisdata\Rapidcity folder. 
1Î Right-click the Rapidcity folder and choose New > File Geodatabase. 
1Î Type in rcdata as the name of the geodatabase and press Enter.  
1. What coordinate system do the feature classes in the archive folder use? 
__________________________________________________________________ 
The new geodatabase will be in UTM NAD 1983. As we work, we will be careful that each 
coordinate system is converted during the import process.  
Creating feature datasets 
Most of the feature classes will go in feature datasets, which are required to have a predefined 
coordinate system, and which we will carefully create using NAD 1983 UTM Zone 13N. Feature 
classes imported to these feature datasets will automatically be converted to match. 
2Î Right-click the rcdata geodatabase and choose New > Feature Dataset. 
2Î Name it Admin and click Next. 
2Î For the coordinate system, expand Projected Coordinate Systems > UTM > NAD 
1983 and select UTM Zone 13N.  
2Î While the UTM Zone 13 coordinate system is still highlighted, click the Add to 
Favorites button, so that it will be easily available next time. Click Next. 
2Î Do not set a vertical coordinate system; click Next. 
2Î Accept the default tolerances, resolution, and domain, and click Finish. 
 
3Î Use the same procedure to create another feature dataset in rcdata named 
Environmental. (This time choose NAD 1983 UTM Zone 13 from the Favorites.) 
 
4Î Create a third feature dataset named Transportation. 
 
5Î Create a fourth feature dataset named Watersystem. 

Geodatabases 
393 
Adding coverages to a feature dataset 
We will begin by importing two coverages, the city 
boundary and the land use data, to the Admin feature 
dataset. Recall that coverages contain multiple feature 
classes, so we must specify polygons as the class to 
import. 
6Î Right-click the new Admin feature dataset 
and choose Import > Feature Class (single) 
tool (Fig. 13.13). 
6Î Click the Browse button for the Input 
Features, navigate to the 
mgisdata\Rapidcity\archive folder, and 
double-click the landuse coverage to see its 
feature classes.  
6Î Select the polygon feature class and click 
Add. 
6Î Enter landuse for the Output Feature 
Class Name.  
The Field Map section lists the attributes in the feature class and controls how they are imported. 
Fields may be removed or added, or the order can be changed. With coverages, some fields are 
part of the coverage storage structure and contain no useful information after the conversion. It is 
best to delete them. 
7Î Click on the AREA field to highlight it, and then click the X button to delete it. (It 
will not be deleted from the original coverage.) 
7Î Also delete the PERIMETER and LANDUSE# fields from the map. 
7Î Leave the rest of the options set to their defaults. 
7Î The window should appear as in Figure 13.13. Click OK. 
7Î Use the Preview tab to examine the newly imported polygons.  
Everything looks in order. Next we import the citybnd coverage.  
8Î Right-click the Admin feature dataset and choose Import > Feature Class (single). 
8Î Set the input feature class to the polygons of citybnd in the Archive folder. 
8Î Set the output name to citybnd. 
8Î Highlight and delete the AREA, PERIMETER, and CITYBND# fields. 
8Î Click OK to start importing. 
Often, users have multiple feature classes to import into the same geodatabase. Another tool 
allows multiple imports to be set up and run in batch mode. 
9Î Right-click the Environmental feature dataset and choose Import > Feature Class 
(multiple). 
9Î Expand the archive folder in the Catalog Tree. Click on the watersheds shapefile and 
drag it over to the Input Features box on the tool. The feature class is placed in the list 
to process. 
Fig. 13.13. Importing a feature class 

Chapter 13 
394 
9Î Click and drag the stategeol shapefile to the Input Features box. Click OK. 
9Î Expand the Environmental dataset and examine the new feature classes. 
Notice that, when using the tool for importing multiple feature classes, you cannot set options 
individually for each one, as you could with the single input tool. We continue importing. 
10Î Right-click the Admin feature dataset and choose Import > Feature Class (multiple). 
10Î Drag these three shapefiles from the archive folder to the Input Features box: 
connects, parcels, and buildings. Click OK. 
10Î Expand the Admin dataset and check the new feature classes. 
 
11Î Right-click the Transportation dataset and choose Import > Feature Class (single). 
11Î Import the rc_roads shapefile from the archive folder. Name the output feature 
class roads. Don’t change the Field Map settings. Click OK. 
We also would like to add schools, but the name of the feature class gives us pause. 
12Î Click the sdschools shapefile in the archive folder and click the Preview tab above 
the display panel, if it is not already clicked. 
As suspected, this shapefile contains schools for the whole state, although we want only the ones 
in the Rapid City area. We need to use the Clip tool this time. The geology map has a good 
boundary for clipping what we need. 
12Î Open ArcToolbox > Analysis Tools > Extract > Clip. 
12Î Click and drag the sdschools shapefile into the Input Features box on the tool. 
12Î Click and drag the stategeol shapefile into the Clip Features box. 
12Î Name the output schools and place it in the Admin feature dataset. 
12Î Accept the default XY Tolerance and click OK. 
Finally, we plan to have a feature class to contain water and sewer lines. This feature class does 
not yet exist—we will digitize it. We must create the empty feature class. 
13Î Right-click the Watersystem feature dataset and choose New > Feature Class. 
13Î Name the feature class waterlines and set the type to Line Features. Click Next. 
13Î Accept the default configuration key word options. Click Next. 
13Î We are not going to create the fields for this feature class yet. Click Finish. 
Creating attribute domains 
During the planning phase for this geodatabase, it was determined that it should have domains. A 
table was developed, listing the domains and their properties (Table 13.1). With the planning 
done, we are ready to start adding the domains to the geodatabase. 
TIP: ALWAYS, ALWAYS click Apply after EACH domain is added, before adding the next 
one. If you make an error in one domain but add more before clicking Apply, then it may not be 
clear which one has the error. You’ll have to delete them all and start again.  

Geodatabases 
395 
14Î In ArcCatalog, right-click the rcdata geodatabase and choose Properties. Click the 
Domains tab. 
14Î Type the domain name, RoadType, into the 
first empty box, and enter the description Type 
of road (Fig. 13.14). 
14Î Set the Field Type to Text. 
14Î Set the Domain Type to Coded Values. 
14Î Set the split policy to Duplicate. 
14Î Set the merge policy to Default Value. 
 
15Î Type the three-letter codes into the Code 
column and enter each description in the 
Description column: INT = Interstate;  
HWY = Highway; RMP = Ramp; CON = 
Connector; and LOC = Local. 
15Î Click Apply. 
Table 13.1 summarizes the characteristics of all the 
domains to be added. Use it for reference, if needed, as you 
continue adding the domains in Steps 16–23.

16Î Click in the next open Domain Name box and enter the name Direction. 
16Î Type Cardinal directions for the Description. 
16Î Set the field type to Text, and the split and merge policies to Duplicate and Default 
Value.
16Î Enter the eight codes from Table 13.1. Be sure to also enter the 
Description for each one using the same values, such as N. 
16Î Click Apply. 
Fig. 13.14. Setting up the 
RoadType domain 

Chapter 13 
396 
TIP: You must always enter a description, even if it will be the same as the code. If the 
description is left blank, then the values will appear blank when you try to view or edit them. 
ArcMap always displays the descriptions, not the codes. 
17Î Create the StreetAbbrev coded domain from the information 
in Table 13.1. Enter the street codes in the Code boxes, also 
entering the full-word equivalent for each one.  
17Î Click Apply. 
 
18Î Create the Diameter coded domain from the information in 
Table 13.1. Enter the number for the Code (it is a Short Integer 
field type, but in the Description enter 1-in, 3-in, and so on).  
18Î Click Apply. 
 
19Î Create the Materials domain from the information in Table 13.1. 
Enter the three-letter code values for Code, but for Description 
enter the full-length words: copper, pvc, and so on.  
19Î Click Apply. 
The last two domains are range domains, so we won’t need to type any codes—just the minimum 
and maximum range values. 
20Î Create the Flow domain. Make sure it uses the Short Integer type. 
20Î Set the minimum value to 1 and the maximum value to 2000, and set the policies as 
Duplicate and Default Value, as for the others. 
20Î Click Apply. 
This last domain is intended to provide suitable split and merge policies for feature lengths, such 
that if you split a line each piece will receive a proportional value of the original length. Thus, it 
will use different policies than the other domains. The Range is irrelevant, but it needs to be large 
enough to hold any reasonable length measure. 
21Î Create the LengthFloat domain. Make sure it uses the Float type. 
21Î Set the minimum value to 0 and the maximum value to 999999999. 
21Î Give it Geometry Ratio for the split policy, and Sum Values for the merge policy. 
21Î Click Apply. 
21Î Click OK to close the Database Properties window. 
3. What would you do if you wanted to apply a similar length domain to fields with a Double 
field type? _____________________________________________________________ 
TIP: Domain policies and codes may be edited after the domain is created. However, the field 
type and domain type, once set, cannot be altered. To change them, you must delete the domain 
and create a new one. To delete a domain, select it and press the Delete key. 

Geodatabases 
397 
Assigning domains and default values 
The roads feature class already exists, and we can assign domains to the appropriate fields.  
22Î Open the Properties for the roads feature class in the Transportation feature dataset. 
22Î Click the Fields tab. 
22Î Click in the little gray box to the left of the PREFIX field to highlight it. 
22Î Click in the Domain drop-down box below and select the Direction domain. 
The Direction domain actually applies to two fields in this table, the PREFIX and SUFFIX2 
fields. Domains can be reused in multiple feature classes. 
22Î Highlight the SUFFIX2 field and set the domain to Direction. 
22Î Highlight the SUFFIX field and set the domain to StreetAbbrev. Click Apply. 
Next, the road type field does not yet exist in this feature class, so we must create it. We will also 
assign a default value, since local residential streets outnumber the other types. 
23Î In the next available field name box, type ROADTYPE. Make it a Text field. Give 
it a length of 3 and set the domain to Roadtype.  
23Î In the Default Value box, enter LOC, the code for local roads. Click OK. 
Later in the lesson, we will see how these domains function during editing. 
Creating subtypes 
The waterlines feature class will have four subtypes: water mains, water laterals, sewer mains, 
and sewer laterals. Subtypes must be based on a short integer field, so we must create this field in 
the feature class in addition to the other fields. We will also assign a domain to each field, if one 
is available for it. 
24Î Open the Properties for waterlines in the Watersystem feature dataset. 
24Î Click the Fields tab. 
24Î Type Linetype in the first available field name box and set the Data Type to Short 
Integer. Click Apply. This will be the subtype field. 
 
25Î Type PipeDiam in the next box and set the type to Short Integer. Click in the 
Domain box and choose the Diameter domain. Click Apply. 
25Î Type PipeMaterial in the next box and set the type to Text. Set the length to 3 and 
the domain to Materials. Click Apply. 
 
26Î Type InstallDate in the next box and set the type to Date. Click Apply. 
26Î Type MaxFlow in the next box and set the type to Short Integer. Set the domain to 
Flow. Click Apply. 
26Î Type Feet in the next box and set the type to Float. Set the domain to LengthFloat. 
Click OK. 

Chapter 13 
398 
TIP: Note that the list of domains varied for the fields. The domain field type must match the 
attribute field type. A short integer domain cannot be applied to a long integer attribute. 
Before we create the subtypes, we must know the default values to be assigned. If domains are 
used, then the defaults must list the actual code value, not the description (6 rather than 6-in, for 
example). For some fields, such as the length in feet or the install date, we cannot predict a 
typical value ahead of time, so there is no point in setting a default for it. 
27Î Open the properties for the 
waterlines feature class. 
27Î Click the Subtypes tab in the Feature

27Î Set the Subtype Field to Linetype. 
27Î In the first Subtype box, enter 1 for 
the code and Water Main for the 
description. 
27Î Highlight the top Water Main row to 
edit the boxes below. 
 
28Î Under Default Values and Domains, 
enter the value 6 in the Default Value 
field for PipeDiam. 
28Î Enter COP in the Default Value field 
for PipeMaterial. 
28Î Enter 700 in the Default Value field 
for MaxFlow.  
28Î Make sure that the window appears as in Figure 13.15 and click Apply.

29Î Click on the second row to highlight it. 
29Î Enter the default values for water laterals as listed in Table 13.2. You don’t need to 
assign domains; they were assigned for the Water Main subtype. Click Apply. 
 
30Î Enter subtype 3, Sewer Main, and then enter the default values. Click Apply. 
30Î Enter subtype 4, Sewer Lateral, and the default values. Click Apply.

30Î Make sure that the Default Subtype drop-down box at the 
top is set to Water Main. The final list of subtypes should 
appear as shown to the right.  
30Î Click OK to close the Feature Class Properties window. 
Using domains while editing  
Now we are ready to see how domains and subtypes work during an editing session, which is 
when they are most noticeable. 
31Î Close ArcCatalog. 
31Î Start ArcMap with a new, blank map. Set the default geodatabase to the 
mgisdata\Rapidcity\rcdata geodatabase. 
31Î Add the roads layer from the Transportation feature dataset. 
31Î Open the Editor toolbar, if necessary, and choose to Start Editing. 
 
32Î Use Selection > Select By Attributes to select all the roads where: 
 
STREET = ‘MOUNT RUSHMORE’.  Close the window when done selecting. 
32Î Click the Attributes button on the Editor toolbar. Dock the window in a convenient 
location and resize it, if needed, to see the field values. 
32Î Click one of the entries in the list and examine its attributes. 
First, notice that the SUFFIX field entries are listed as “Road” rather than RD, which is the code 
actually in the field. This resulted from giving this field the StreetAbbrev domain. 
33Î Click in the space next to the SUFFIX field. 
A coded value domain has a drop-down list showing the 
codes for that attribute (Fig. 13.16). It prevents the user 
from entering an inappropriate value such as AV instead 
of AVE, and it allows the user to see a real word rather 
than a cryptic code. 
The ROADTYPE field was newly added to the feature 
class and thus contains no values at all. Hence, the 
<Null> value appears in the box. We can set it to the 
appropriate value now. 
33Î Click the roads heading at the top, so that 
an edit will apply to all selected records. 
33Î Click in the RoadType box and select the 
Connector road type, setting it for all the 
selected records. 
It would be reasonable to assume that roads designated as 
“Circle” or “Court” are local roads. We can select them 
and assign the road type. 
34Î Open Select By Attributes from the main 
menu bar and clear the expression. 
Fig. 13.16. Coded domains appear as 
drop-down lists during editing. 

Chapter 13 
400 
34Î Start entering the expression SUFFIX = and then click Get Unique Values. Notice 
that both code and description are shown. 
34Î Continue adding the full expression SUFFIX = ‘CIR’ OR SUFFIX = ‘CT’ by 
double-clicking the appropriate values in the Get box. Notice that only the code is 
placed in the expression. Click OK.  
34Î Click the top entry in the Attributes window so that edits apply to all the selected 
features. Set the ROADTYPE to Local. 
Unfortunately, this task must be completed to assign a road type to all of the roads. This is why 
designing your database ahead of time is so important. Adding domains and fields after the 
features exist creates extra work. We’ll leave this task for another time. 
Recall that we assigned a default value, Local, to the ROADTYPE field. Our reasoning was that 
most of the roads in a city are local ones, so whenever we add a local road we do not have to 
enter the type. 
35Î Clear the selected features. 
35Î Click the roads template in the Create Features window, and add a line somewhere. 
35Î Scroll down and examine the ROADTYPE field in the Attributes window. 
Most of the fields are <Null> for this new road, but the ROADTYPE is automatically set to 
Local. If this were indeed a local road, we would not have to enter the value. If it were not, we 
would. Thus, defaults are useful only when a particular value occurs often enough that it saves 
time overall. 
35Î Click the Edit tool on the Editor toolbar. Press the Delete key on the keyboard to 
delete the road that you just added. 
35Î Save your edits. 
Using subtypes while editing 
Now let’s examine how subtypes make our work easier. 
36Î Add the buildings, connects, and parcels feature classes from the Admin feature 
dataset. Turn off the roads. 
36Î Zoom to the extent of the parcels layer, and then zoom out a little bit. 
36Î Add the waterlines feature class from the Watersystem feature dataset. 
This feature class is empty, so no features appear on the map, but each 
subtype appears with its own symbol in the Table of Contents. 
37Î Modify the waterlines symbols so that the mains are thick lines 
and the laterals are thinner lines. Make the water lines blue and the 
sewer lines orange.  
No editing templates have been created for waterlines yet. Let’s do it now. 
38Î In the Create Features window, choose the Organize Templates button. 
38Î Click New Template, and make sure waterlines and connects are checked. 

Geodatabases 
401 
38Î Click Finish and close the Organize Feature Templates window. 
Now let’s digitize some water lines. 
39Î Open the Snapping toolbar, if necessary, using Editor > Snapping > Snapping 
Toolbar. Turn off all types of snapping. 
39Î Click the Water Main template and add a water main that runs north of the block. 
The precise location is not important. See Figure 13.17. 
39Î Examine the attributes in the Attributes window. 
The defaults that we set for a water main, a 
6-inch copper pipe with a flow rate of 700 
gpm, are already entered in the attribute 
fields, saving us the trouble. 
39Î Click the Sewer Main 
template and add a sewer main 
above the water main. 
39Î Examine the Attributes 
window. A different set of 
defaults was entered for the 
sewer, just as we set up. 
 
40Î Click the Water Lateral template and turn on edge and point snapping. 
40Î Add a lateral from the connection point on each house to the water main, being sure 
to snap from the point to the water main edge. Note the default attributes.  
 
41Î Click the connects template and add another connection point to each house, next 
to the first one, snapping to the edge of the building. 
41Î Click the Sewer Lateral template and add a lateral from each second connection 
point to the main sewer line. Note the default attributes. 
 
42Î Open the attribute table for waterlines. 
Look at all the information entered in the table, even though we never typed a word. You may 
have thought that the subtypes were a hassle to create, but now perhaps you begin to see how they 
are worth the effort! Now we just need to assign the attributes that did not have defaults. 
42Î Clear the selected features, if any. 
42Î Right-click the Feet field and choose Field Calculator. The map units are meters, so 
enter the expression SHAPE_Length * 3.281 and click OK. 
42Î Right-click the InstallDate field and choose Field Calculator. Enter the expression 
“3/17/1997” including the double-quotes. Click OK. 
42Î Close the Table window and save your edits. 
Fig. 13.17. The water and sewer lines 

Chapter 13 
402 
We still have not seen the split/merge policies at work. 
43Î Select the water main with the Edit tool and 
examine its attributes, particularly the Feet field 
(Fig. 13.18). Your lengths will differ. 
43Î Click the Split tool on the Editor toolbar, and click 
on the water main about one-third of the way from its 
left end. 
43Î Select the short end with the Edit tool and view the 
attributes. 
43Î Select the long end with the Edit tool and view the 
attributes. 
Most of the fields were copied from the original, using the assigned Duplicate split rule, which 
makes sense. If the pipe was 6-inch copper before it was split, it should not have changed. 
However, the Feet field was assigned the Geometry Ratio split rule from the LengthFloat domain, 
and the length was automatically updated using the proportion to the shape length. 
Imagine that this section of water main ruptured and was repaired using a bigger PVC pipe. You 
are updating the record. 
44Î In the Attributes window, change the PipeMaterial to pvc. 
44Î Click the InstallDate box and click the Today link at the bottom of the calendar. 
44Î You intend to enter 850 for the new flow rate, but pretend to make a mistake and 
type 8500 instead. 
44Î Clear the selected features and save your edits. 
Now let’s see how to take advantage of the range domain error checking. It is done by means of a 
separate step called validation. 
45Î Use the Edit tool to click and drag a rectangle that selects all of the water lines but 
none of the other features. 
45Î Choose Editor > Validate Features from the Editor toolbar. 
If errors are found, it reports the number in a dialog window and places the incorrect records in 
the selected set, ready for editing. Only attributes with domains will be tested. In this case it 
found your incorrect entry of 8500, and the offending water main remained selected. 
45Î Change the flow rate to 850 in the Attributes window. 
45Î Save your edits and stop editing. 
Editing annotation (optional) 
Annotation can be stored in a feature class within a geodatabase, which makes it available for use 
in many map documents. We will create road name annotation for part of the roads layer. 
46Î Turn on the roads layer. 
46Î Zoom out from the parcels to the area shown in Figure 13.19.  
46Î Turn off all layers except the roads. 
Fig. 13.18. Water main

46Î Choose Bookmarks > Create Bookmark 
from the main menu bar. Enter the name 
Anno and click OK. Now you can return to 
this extent whenever you wish. 
Creating annotation begins by creating dynamic labels 
with the desired properties. 
47Î Open the Labels tab of the roads layer 
properties. 
47Î Create labels using the ROADNAME 
field with 8-pt. Arial font. Click OK. 
47Î Set the map scale to exactly 1:10,000. 
This will be your reference scale, the scale at which 
the annotation appears at the 8-pt. size. You want to 
make sure that the labels 
appear as you wish at this 
scale before you create the 
annotation. It looks fine, so 
let’s continue. 
47Î Right-click the 
Layers data frame 
name and choose 
Convert Labels to 
Annotation. 
47Î Choose to store 
the annotation in a 
database. Notice 
the reference scale 
(Fig. 13.20). 
47Î Fill the button 
to create 
annotation for 
features in the current extent. 
47Î Uncheck the box to create Feature Linked annotation. 
47Î Notice the Destination box; the annotation will be 
saved in the Transportation feature dataset of the rcdata 
geodatabase with the name roadsAnno. 
47Î Click Convert. The roadsAnno feature class is added to 
the data frame. 
The annotation is stored as a separate feature class in the 
Transportation feature dataset, as shown in Figure 13.21. 
TIP: If you made a mistake and want to start over, delete the annotation feature class from the 
geodatabase using the Catalog tab.

Chapter 13 
404 
First, let’s examine the effect of the reference scale. 
48Î Zoom in to a smaller area and watch the annotation get larger. Zoom out and watch 
it get smaller. Then return to 1:10,000. You can zoom in a little more, if you wish, to 
see and work with the annotation better. 
 
49Î Start Editing.  
49Î An editing template for roadsAnno should appear in the Create Features window, 
but if not, create one using the Organize Templates button. 
Selecting annotation for editing requires a different tool than feature editing. 
49Î Click the Edit Annotation tool on the 
Editor toolbar.  
49Î Select E OAKLAND ST. 
When annotation is selected, there are four handles with 
it (Fig. 13.22). The shape of the cursor changes when it 
is placed on top of a handle, indicating the action that 
will occur on a click and drag. The two blue handles on 
the ends rotate the annotation. The red triangle enlarges 
or shrinks the text. The black cross allows the annotation 
to be moved. 
50Î Place the cursor near the top middle until it changes to a two-ended arrow. Click 
and drag to enlarge or shrink the text. Leave it large. 
50Î Place the cursor near the bottom middle until it changes to a four-ended arrow. 
Click and drag to move the text to a clear spot. 
50Î Place the cursor near the end until it changes to a rotate tool. Click and drag to 
rotate the text. 
50Î Shrink the text back to its approximate original size and move it back to its starting 
location. 
Unplaced labels are put in the table, with the designation “Unplaced” in a Status field. The 
Overflow window does not open automatically, but you can open it to place the annotation. 
51Î Choose Editor > Editing Windows > Unplaced Annotation. 
51Î Set the Show drop-down box to roadsAnno and click Search Now. 
51Î Right-click the row WALNUT DR, and click Place Annotation. It appears on the 
map, selected. (If it is not in the list, choose another name.) 
51Î Adjust the location or angle, if necessary, using the Edit Annotation tool. 
51Î Right-click the next row and place the annotation. Adjust the location. 
51Î Close the Unplaced Annotation window. 
We will not continue placing annotation right now, but anytime you want to continue placing the 
annotation you can open this window and search for unplaced labels.

The Attributes window has additional tabs and options when working with Annotation.  
52Î Open the Attributes window and dock it in a convenient place. 
52Î Select the E OAKLAND ST annotation with the Edit Annotation tool. 
52Î Click the Annotation tab in the lower panel of the Attributes window and examine 
the settings. You can set the font properties and retype the text, if necessary. 
52Î Examine the Attributes tab. Each piece of annotation can have all its properties set 
individually.  
52Î Return to the Annotation tab. Click the drop-down box, choose Default for the 
symbol, and click Apply. The E OAKLAND ST text will go back to original size. 
 
53Î The Edit Annotation tool should still be active. Hold down the Shift key and click 
on another nearby piece of annotation to select it also. Now both annotation features 
appear in the Attributes window. 
53Î Click on the roadsAnno entry at the top of the Attributes window. 
TIP: You may need to enlarge the lower panel of the Attributes window to see the font size and 
formatting buttons, or undock the entire window. 
53Î Click the B button for boldface type and click Apply. Both annotation items are 
updated to bold font. 
53Î Click B again to return to normal font and click Apply. Leave the Attributes 
window open so you can use it as needed. 
Now we will create new annotation for some streets in the southeast corner. These probably have 
unplaced labels waiting, but we will create new ones, just for the practice. 
54Î Click the roadsAnno template, noticing that the 
default construction tool is Straight. The 
Annotation Construction window appears. 
54Î Type SIDNEY DR in the open area of the 
Annotation Construction window. 
54Î Click on the center of SIDNEY DR, shown in 
Figure 13.23. 
54Î Move the cursor to rotate the text to the desired 
angle and click again to place it.  
54Î If you don’t like where it was put, press the 
Delete key to get rid of it and then place it again. 
(You don’t need to type the text again.) 
Observe an unlabeled street running north into PARK HILL DR. You can use Identify to 
determine its name. 
55Î Click the Identify tool and click the unlabeled street. Leave the Identify window 
open but tuck it out of the way.

55Î Click the roadsAnno template again and type CHURCHILL DR in the Annotation 
Construction window. 
55Î Place the annotation on the unlabeled street.  
55Î Save your edits so far, and save the map document. 
TIP: MapTips would be a great way to quickly find out unlabeled street names. 
56Î Click the Edit Annotation tool on the Editor toolbar. 
56Î Click on E MEADE ST to select it. Move it to the center of the block. 
56Î Right-click E MEADE ST and choose Copy. 
56Î Right-click anywhere and choose Paste. Choose to paste it into roadsAnno. 
 
A copy of E MEADE ST will be placed on top of the original. 
56Î Click and drag the copy to the eastern part of the street below E ST FRANCIS ST. 
Rotate and adjust its position until you are satisfied. 
Flipping annotation, like flipping a line, makes it go in the opposite direction. 
57Î Select BALSAM AV with the Edit Annotation tool. 
57Î Right-click it and choose Flip Annotation. Now it matches the other 
nearby annotation for easier reading.  
57Î Select E TALLENT ST and move it west of HAWTHORNE AV. 
Placing curved annotation is slightly more complicated, but not much. 
58Î In the Create Features window, click the Curved construction tool 
58Î Type E TALLENT ST in the Construction box. 
58Î Find the curved eastern end of E TALLENT ST and click underneath 
on the left, the middle, and the end to enter a curve that follows the street. 
Double-click to end the sketch.  
58Î If you don’t like the result, delete it and try again. 
Annotation can be made to follow a particular feature, either curved or straight. First, you must 
set the follow options. 
59Î Select ROBBINS DR with the Edit Annotation tool. 
59Î Right-click the annotation and choose Follow > Follow Feature Options. 
59Î Choose Curved and set the offset to 15 map units. Click OK. 
You only need to set the options the first time. Now place the annotation. 
59Î Right-click on the curved section of road that you want ROBBINS 
DR to follow and choose Follow This Feature. The text is moved to 
the point you clicked and rotated to follow the street. 
59Î Place the cursor on the text until you see the four-ended arrow. Click and drag the 
text above and below the street, and then leave it below.

407 
59Î Click and drag the text along the street, noticing how it hugs the feature. When you 
are satisfied with the placement, release the mouse button.  
You can also create new annotation that follows a feature. 
60Î Click the roadsAnno template and select the Follow Feature construction tool. 
60Î Type City Bus Route in the Text box. 
60Î Click along the inclined segment of E Meade St to select the 
feature on which to place the annotation.  
60Î Move the mouse until you are satisfied with the position and then 
click again to place the annotation.  
60Î Click the Annotation tab of the Attributes window and change the font to italic. 
Click Apply. 
 
61Î Click the Edit Annotation tool and select MAYWOOD DR. 
61Î Press the O key on the keyboard to open the Follow Feature Options. 
61Î Fill the button for Curved and click OK. 
61Î Right-click on the center of MAYWOOD DR and choose Follow This Feature. 
61Î While the annotation is still selected, place the cursor on it and click and drag it 
above, below, or along the road to get the best placement and curvature. Release the 
mouse button when you are satisfied with the placement. 
 
62Î Select the Horizontal construction tool. 
62Î Type Robbinsdale School in the Text box.

Exercises 
  1. Consider a buildings feature class such as the one you started in the Crestview geodatabase for 
Austin. Make a list of likely attributes that such a feature class might have. 
  2. Take the list of buildings attributes and decide which ones could have domains and what 
types of domains and values they should have. Construct a table similar to Table 13.1 
showing these domains. 
  3. Divide the buildings into categories that would make suitable subtypes. Consider the different 
default values that each subtype would have, and construct a table similar to Table 13.2. 
  4. Using the information assembled in Exercises 1 through 3, create a buildings feature class in 
the Crestview geodatabase. Set up the geodatabase domains, create the fields for the feature 
class, and assign default values. 
  5. If you have an ArcGIS Standard license, create subtypes for the buildings with the default 
values you determined in Exercise 3. If you do not, create editing templates instead of 
subtypes, with the default values stored in the templates. Consult the Help and learn how to 
save and load editing templates. 
  6. Digitize approximately 50 buildings from the Crestview area, distributed among your 
subtypes. Capture a map showing the buildings and a screenshot of the attribute table showing 
the various fields of information. 
  7. Finish editing the roadsAnno annotation in the rcdata geodatabase to make an aesthetic and 
clearly legible set of labels. Capture a map showing the streets and annotation. 
  8. Create geodatabase annotation for the streets in the Crestview geodatabase and edit them for 
optimum placement and legibility. Capture a map showing the streets and annotation. 
Challenge Problem: My Alma Mater 
The Challenge Problem in Chapter 7 asked you to create a campus database and digitize building 
footprints. We will add to this project now in several ways. 
¾ Digitize the roads and sidewalks as separate polygon feature classes. (For sidewalks, you 
may find it easier, if less accurate, to digitize the centerlines and then create buffers.) 
¾ Create and place feature annotation for the roads and buildings. 
¾ Create a point feature class of objects to be collected using a GPS or smartphone (trees or 
trash cans, for example). Include several attributes to collect and create coded domains as 
appropriate, so that they will appear as pick-lists on the devices. 
¾ Remember to create an Item Description for all new feature classes. 
¾ (Optional) If you have a smartphone or tablet, and publication privileges in ArcGIS 
Online, publish the point feature class as an editable feature service. Collect at least 20 
data points using your mobile device and the ArcGIS app. (You can sign up for a 30-day 
trial subscription to ArcGIS Online if you don’t have an account with your university.) 
Write a short report, with screen captures, documenting your work.

Mastering the Concepts  
GIS Concepts 
Metadata is “data about data”—it is critical to GIS, 
providing the ability to discover, access, and use 
geospatial data sets and services. Providing metadata is 
a part of creating GIS data sets. It is a professional 
obligation when data will be distributed to clients or the 
public. Best management practices dictate that metadata 
should also be prepared for in-house data, even if it is 
nothing more than the simple Item Description, so that 
critical information about the source and processing of 
a data set will not be lost. Figure 14.1 shows metadata 
developed for the radar image georeferenced in 
Chapter 3, which you will create in this chapter.  
Preparing complete metadata that complies with a 
standard is a daunting task. However, even partial 
metadata is better than none. This chapter provides a 
basic introduction to the most important elements of 
geospatial metadata and how they can be developed. 
The metadata standards 
To facilitate sharing of metadata across the many GIS formats and applications, the Federal 
Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) and the International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) have worked to develop metadata standards that specify the structure and content of 
geospatial metadata records. The FGDC is “an interagency committee that promotes the 
coordinated development, use, sharing, and dissemination of geospatial data on a national basis” 
(www.fgdc.gov), and it serves as a liaison to the international body of standards. The FGDC web 
site contains a wealth of information on metadata and geospatial data in general.  
A metadata standard lays out the specific information fields that should be included and defines 
which ones are optional and which are mandatory. It also specifies the exact format and 
organization of the information so that programs and metadata interpreters can always find the 
information in the same place and so that the metadata are transportable from system to system. 
Currently, metadata standards in the United States are in a state of flux. For many years, users in 
the United States have used a standard prepared by the FGDC in 1994 and updated in 1998: the 
Fig. 14.1. Metadata example 

Chapter 14 
410 
Content Standard for Digital Geographic Metadata (CSDGM). Companies that produce data for 
federal agencies are required to provide metadata that complies with the CSDGM standard, and in 
turn, data produced by under contracts to many government agencies must be compliant as well. 
Much effort has been expended in development, software, and training for CSDGM, and much of 
the data that you download and use today will use this content standard. 
However, the international community has been using a more generic standard, called the ISO 
19139 standard, for nearly as long. It is not particularly suited for geographic data, so another 
standard, the ISO 19115, has been established for geographic data. ISO standards allow a 
community of users to develop and publish a profile, a customized version of a content standard 
that is designed to meet the needs of that community, as long as they follow rules that ensure that 
the profile will maintain compatibility with the original standards.  
The United States and Canada geographic data committees agreed to jointly develop a profile 
now known as the North American Profile of ISO 19115, or NAP. It has been adopted by Canada. 
The FGDC has formally endorsed the ISO 19115 standard, and federal agencies are being 
encouraged to move to the ISO standard as they are able, although this process may take years.  
The practical upshot of this situation is that users are likely to encounter both CSDGM and NAP 
metadata for some time and must be familiar with both standards (as if metadata weren’t difficult 
and confusing enough before). Much of the information contained in the two standards is similar, 
but the organization is different, and the cross-walk is not perfect or simple. Some, but not all, of 
the content of CSDGM content can be recorded using ISO 19115. For example, documentation of 
attribute tables and attribute fields cannot be recorded using ISO 19915 compliant metadata. 
Many of the ISO standards are being updated as time goes on, while CSDGM has been 
unchanged since 1998. Because of these complexities, many organizations are still using CSDGM 
but are gradually adopting ISO standards as they (and their implementations) are improved. 
The following publications are recommended for users who need to learn about metadata 
standards and implementation. All but the last refer to the CSDGM standard. Users are 
encouraged to explore the FGDC web site http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata for updated information

Institutionalize Metadata Before It Institutionalizes You (2005) by Linda Wayne. Useful discussion 
of templates and incorporating metadata creation into the organizational workflow. 
Some of the information in metadata is easy to understand and document, such as who produced 
the data. Many of the terms used in the standards and literature presuppose an understanding of 
geospatial data topics, such as logical consistency or completeness. Users will develop expertise 
in these areas as they travel the path to becoming geospatial professionals. Merely trying to 
understand these terms as you try to produce metadata will make you a better creator of data as 
well. Some sections of metadata are not applicable to a particular data set and can be ignored. As 
you gain experience reading and creating metadata, you will understand more and more about 
geospatial data, where it comes from, what it is good for, and what happens to it during its 
lifetime. You will also gain experience in evaluating the quality of data and deciding whether it is 
good enough for a particular project or application. 
Data quality issues 
One fundamental purpose of metadata is providing sufficient information for a user to decide 
whether a data set is of sufficient quality for a particular application. Assessing the quality of a 
data set is not a simple judgment of good or bad but a complex analysis of whether a particular 
data set is fit for an intended purpose. A data set that is inadequate for one application might be 
completely suitable for another. The data quality information in metadata is provided so that a 
potential user can evaluate the data set in light of what he or she wants to do with it. During this 
process, six key issues must be considered: (1) lineage, (2) positional accuracy, (3) attribute 
accuracy, (4) logical consistency, (5) completeness, and (6) temporal accuracy. The following 
sections discuss these issues and provide examples of how a user might document the information 
in the metadata. 
Lineage 
Lineage is concerned with documenting the original source of the data set (such as 
the City of Austin web site that provided most of the Austin data for this text) and 
recording the operations and transformations that have occurred between the source 
and the final product. Questions to be answered about the data include who 
collected the data, how and why they were collected, what was the original scale or accuracy, 
how they were converted into digital form, and what operations have been performed on it since.  
The metadata include sections on the process steps, which list the sequence of operations that 
have been performed in producing the data. In particular, the impacts of any of the processing 
steps on the attribute or positional accuracy need to be recorded. For example, if the lines are 
generalized to the nearest 500 meters to prepare a detailed states map for a faster-drawing 
national map, then that information should be recorded. If the feature class is the result of 
intersecting two layers with an XY tolerance of 25 meters, then that information, with the 
potential impact on the feature accuracy, must be noted. 
¾ You digitize published maps of aquifer outcrop areas from two adjacent quadrangles 
generated by the US Geological Survey. You merge the two quadrangles and match the 
edges between them. In the metadata, you include the publication information and a 
complete citation for both maps. You record a process step for digitizing the maps, 
including the RMS errors reported for registering the maps on the digitizer. You report a 
second process for edge-matching and merging the two maps, including the RMS error 
associated with that step. 

Chapter 14 
412 
Positional accuracy 
Positional accuracy is an assessment of how closely features in the data set 
correspond to their actual locations in the real world. Impacts on positional 
accuracy occur at several stages in the development of a data set: (1) errors 
present in the source data or in the original data collection, (2) errors associated 
with transformations or georeferencing, and (3) errors associated with subsequent processing. 
  1. Source data errors are generated in many ways, but the most common are by digitizing a paper 
map or scan, by surveying, by photogrammetry or remote sensing, or by GPS measurement. 
Each of these methods has different sources of error that impact the positional accuracy. 
At minimum, one assumes that maps are accurate to within one line width, or approximately  
0.5 mm. This value can be converted to ground units using the scale, as demonstrated in Chapter 
1. A 1:24,000 scale map has an effective resolution of 12 meters, a 1:100,000 scale map has an 
effective resolution of 50 meters, and so on. If a map is digitized, its accuracy can be estimated 
from the scale. This estimate serves as a minimum, however, for it neglects potential inaccuracies 
in assembling the map data. Some phenomena or objects can be less precisely located than others. 
A road is easy to locate, but a soil map has an inherent uncertainty in placing the boundary 
between two soil types that grade into each other.  
Surveying and photogrammetric methods follow rigorous standards during development and are 
usually subjected to quality assurance and control steps along the way. In general, base data 
sources, such as topographic maps and derived digital products, can be assumed to conform to the 
National Map Accuracy Standards. These standards require testing by comparing at least 20 
checkpoints composed of well-defined and locatable points to corresponding locations on a 
reference map of higher accuracy. No more than 10% of the points can be off by more than 1 in 
10,000 units. In practice, few maps are actually tested due to the time and cost constraints 
associated with mapping projects, although the procedures developed to create the maps have 
been, and therefore they provide some assurance that most of the products meet the standard. 
The accuracy of remotely sensed information varies greatly due to the differences in resolution 
between satellites and the differences in geometric correction that have been applied. GPS units 
also vary widely in their accuracy. 
  2. A paper map or a scanned digital image must be georeferenced, transforming the digitizer, 
scanner, or screen coordinates into a real-world coordinate system (see Chapter 3). The RMS 
error associated with this transformation should be recorded and included with the metadata. 
  3. Various geoprocessing operations, such as generalizing lines or intersecting feature classes, 
can degrade positional accuracy. Processing tolerances, such as the XY tolerance used when 
intersecting to remove slivers or a cluster tolerance applied when correcting topology errors, 
provide an estimate of the impact. These tolerances should be recorded when listing the 
process steps in the metadata. 
¾ You digitize the power lines on a 1:24,000 scale topographic map. You infer the source 
map accuracy to be 12 meters. The RMS error reported when you registered the paper 
map on the digitizer was 4 meters. Report both of these in the metadata. 
¾ You go out in an ATV and collect GPS data for the boundaries of prairie dog towns. 
Previous testing indicated that your GPS unit has an accuracy of 10 meters, and you 

Metadata 
413 
estimate that you can drive within 5 meters of the town boundary without damaging the 
burrows. Report the accuracy as 15 meters. 
Attribute accuracy 
Attribute accuracy assesses how well the values in the attribute fields 
correspond to the true values in the real world. Does the label on Rapid Creek 
represent its real name? Does the 40% crown cover value of a tree stand really 
reflect the actual density of the crown foliage? Because there are so many 
different kinds of attributes, assessing accuracy is complex, variable, and unguided by any sort of 
standard methodology. However, some of the issues that should be considered are as follows.  
For categorical data, attention should be given to the classification scheme. How detailed is it? Are 
the crown-cover categories divided into 10 groups of 10% each or into three groups? Do the land 
use categories represent all possible land use types? Do the geological units provide sufficient detail 
to locate potential gold horizons or are they simply grouped by age or gross rock type? 
Issues related to all data types include the following: What is the expected rate of error in 
assigning values to the field? How often is something misclassified or wrongly recorded? How 
much heterogeneity exists within the measurement unit? The sand percentage in a soil polygon, 
for example, cannot be expected to be uniform over the entire area. Have any attempts been made 
to assess the variability within a unit? 
If any information on attribute accuracy is known or if any tests have been conducted to assess 
the accuracy, these should be reported in the metadata. If nothing is known, then it is acceptable 
to put Unknown. Here are some examples. 
¾ A land use map has been generated from a Landsat satellite image. You have followed 
industry practice and tested the classification against a set of ground data points and 
calculated the overall accuracy, producer’s accuracy, and user’s accuracy for the 
classification. Include these three values in the attribute accuracy report. 
¾ Your survey agency has surveyed all the counties in the state on their approval of the 
governor’s performance and is reporting an approval rating for each county. The survey 
method has an accuracy of  3 percentage points. Include this accuracy in the metadata. 
¾ You have digitized a geological map from a plate in a master’s thesis. The author did not 
include any accuracy assessment, and you have no funds to evaluate the accuracy of the 
map. Put Unknown in the attribute accuracy report in the metadata but include the scale 
of the original map. 
Logical consistency 
Logical consistency is a measure of how well the features in the data model 
correspond to their counterparts in the real world and of how well the data model 
is able to model the relationships in the real world. This is another complex and 
difficult area that is rarely tested in full. However, it is usually possible and 
desirable to test the internal logical consistency of a data set and how well it 
fulfills the topological rules that have been defined for it. These topological rules were described 
in Chapter 12. Polygons should not have gaps or overlaps, lines should intersect at nodes and not 
cross each other, and so on. The logical consistency report can include the topological rules that 
were tested and the results of the test. 

Chapter 14 
414 
¾ You develop a planar topology for a Transportation feature dataset and check for dangles, 
self-intersection, and improper intersections. All identified errors were resolved. Include 
a statement of the topological rules that were tested, and report that the feature dataset 
does not contain violations of those rules in the logical consistency report. 
¾ You digitized a geological map as a shapefile using snapping and Auto Complete 
Polygon, and you are reasonably sure that most of the polygons have no gaps or overlaps. 
However, you don’t have an ArcGIS Standard license and cannot test the topology. 
Report that snapping and coincident boundary protocols were followed during digitizing 
and that the data layer is free or nearly free of gaps and overlaps. 
Completeness 
The completeness of a data set refers to how well it has captured every possible 
instance of the objects in the data set. Completeness for polygons is usually easy 
to assess; do the polygons completely cover the area of interest or not? Lines and 
points can be less certain. Did the Department of Transportation digitize every 
known road in its GPS survey, or could it have missed some? Did it digitize only public roads, or 
are private roads also included? Did it include gravel and dirt tracks or only paved roads? Does 
the table of oil and gas wells in the state include every known well, or have some historical 
records been lost or misplaced prior to the assembly of the data? 
¾ You assembled a database of septic systems by identifying houses on digital orthophotos 
taken five years ago. You realize that you may have missed systems for houses that were 
built after the photos were taken or for houses under heavy tree cover that were not 
visible in the photo. State these limitations in the completeness report. 
Temporal accuracy 
Temporal accuracy is the time period for which a data set is considered valid. 
Some geospatial data, such as a map of greenness condition or a NEXRAD radar 
rain map, represent ephemeral conditions valid for a few minutes to days. Other 
data sets represent phenomena that change more slowly, and data sets might be 
considered valid for several years. Population, for example, is usually referenced to a census year 
or census update. Land use data change slowly as cities grow and new developments spring up. 
Some data can be considered fairly stable. Geology, major road networks, rivers, and 
international boundaries change infrequently on the scale of human affairs. 
For data that will change significantly over the lifetime of the data set, it is important to designate 
how frequently the data provider intends to update the information. Some data are undergoing 
continual revision and are considered to be in progress, with updates planned at irregular or 
regular intervals. Census data, for example, are gathered every 10 years, and estimated updates 
are available every 2 to 5 years for some portions of the data set. However, a lot of GIS data is 
simply produced once, and no updates are ever planned.  
Two sections in the metadata refer to the time period, that of the source and that of the data 
product being documented. These two are often the same but can be different. For example, the 
city planning office might have digitized the original platting records that were updated manually 
until 1995 to produce its parcels feature class (the source), but continued updates bring the feature 
class time period to within the past year (the product). 
¾ Your office performed a GPS survey during 2004 and 2005 to locate and classify the 
existing off-road trails in the national forest, both official and unofficial. No funds are

415 
provided to locate and map new trails created in the future. The temporal period of both 
the source and the product is 2004–2005, and no updates are planned. 
¾ Your office maintains the county parcel records that were digitized from plat maps by a 
consultant in 2001. Every sale or modification is reported to the county as required by 
law through the office of deeds and land titles. You process the updates and make 
changes to the internal database as they come in. You push the updates to the public 
version of the database on your web site every three months. In this case, the time period 
of the source is 2001, the time period of the data set is the date it was last pushed to the 
public site, and the update frequency is quarterly. 
Metadata format 
CSDGM metadata are usually stored either as a simple text file or as a text file in eXtensible 
Markup Language (XML). XML is similar to the more familiar HTML used to develop web 
pages. XML documents can be associated with an “XML stylesheet” which specifies page layout 
and text formats to be used by web browsers and other applications (such as ArcGIS) to display 
the content in a human-readable form. 
The CSDGM metadata content standard includes seven 
main sections (Fig. 14.2). The North American Profile of 
ISO 19115 has its own section organization. In some cases 
they correspond fairly closely with the CSDGM sections, 
but not in others. The following descriptions refer to the 
CSDGM sections, with the NAP sections that contain 
similar information noted in parentheses. 
1.  Identification (Identification, Maintenance) 
This section contains basic information about the original 
source of the data: who created them, what they contain, 
and any restrictions that have been placed on their use. The 
Abstract, Purpose, and Supplemental Information 
communicate what the data set contains and notifies the 
user of any important information. The Currentness 
Reference indicates the time period that the data represent, 
and the Status says how frequently they are updated. The 
Data Set Credit and Citation Details provide information 
on who created the data product and how it should be cited in the literature. The Spatial Domain 
and Keywords help anyone searching for data to determine the location and the content of the 
data. The Access Constraints and Use Constraints specify who can use the data and whether they 
can be given to others and usually contain standard liability and release statements to protect the 
data provider from lawsuits. 
2.  Data Quality (Quality) 
This section provides information for the user to judge data fitness for a given purpose. Sections 
are included on the Logical Consistency and the Completeness of the data set as a whole. There 
is a section to report on the Attribute Accuracy and the Positional Accuracy. The original scale 
and accuracy of the Source data must be given, including the temporal accuracy; the accuracy of 
the source may be different (better or worse) than the final data set. A complete Source Citation 
should also be included. Finally, there is a Process Step section that records the processing steps 
between the source and final product and the impact of these steps on the accuracy of the data. 
Fig. 14.2. CSDGM sections 

Chapter 14 
416 
3.  Data Organization (Spatial Representation) 
This section contains information on the format and organization of the data, such as whether 
they are vector or raster data. ArcGIS fills out this section automatically. 
4.  Spatial Reference (Reference System) 
This section contains the complete spatial reference information on the coordinate system, 
including the GCS used, the map projection and its parameters, and the map units. ArcGIS also 
fills out this section automatically. 
5.  Entity Attribute (Content) 
This section describes the attribute fields present in a vector data set or the Value field in a raster 
data set. This section is critical for giving data users information, such as what the land use codes 
represent or whether the AREA field is in square kilometers or square miles. The user can choose 
one of two methods to describe the attributes. The Overview Description can be used when all of 
the fields are similar or self-explanatory and can be described together in a paragraph or two. For 
example, a city feature class containing decadal population values since 1800 is easy to explain. 
A land use map with only a couple of fields might also fall into this category. The Detailed 
Description is used when each field requires a different explanation. The metadata creator enters 
separate information for each field. 
6.  Distribution (Distribution) 
This section describes how the data are made available, by whom, and under what conditions. It 
states the Distributor and provides information for contacting that person or organization. It 
describes the format of the data (DVD, CD, FTP download) and the Standard Process by which a 
user should request the data, such as the ordering information or download instructions. It also 
reports the Available Time Period when the distributor intends to make the data available.  
7.  Metadata Reference (Metadata, Maintenance) 
This section is metadata about the metadata, including who developed them, in what format they 
are stored, and if any restrictions are placed on the distribution of the metadata (usually, the 
metadata are freely distributable even if the data set is not). Some of this section is filled out by 
ArcGIS. 
Standards identify certain mandatory elements for compliant metadata. There are several 
categories: mandatory, mandatory if applicable, and optional. Table 14.1 provides a brief 
overview of mandatory elements in NAP and FGDC; users should strive to cover these sections at 
a minimum. Some metadata editors provide guidance on required versus optional fields. 
Acquiring metadata 
Many projects utilize data sets that come from another organization, which, if it follows industry 
practice, has already supplied metadata for the data set. In this case, implementing the metadata 
becomes easier. The user need only ensure that the metadata are properly stored with the data set 
in ArcGIS and that any subsequent processing or modification after acquisition has been recorded 
in the Process Step elements. 
For example, if the user has downloaded wetlands from the National Wetland Inventory and 
extracted the features in a particular county for a project, he or she only needs to record the 
extraction. This information would go into the Completeness Report and the Process Step 
sections of the metadata. The rest of the metadata need not change. In fact, it should not change; 

Metadata 
417 
it is important to retain the 
originators of the data set so that 
they receive proper credit and so 
that the prior information about the 
data is not lost. 
However, this process may be 
complicated by the fact that not all 
organizations store the metadata as 
part of the data set, as ArcGIS 
does. The metadata may exist in a 
completely different document 
close to, but not with, the data they 
represent. They might be 
somewhere on the web site where 
the data are downloaded, in another 
folder on their source DVD, or 
occasionally even further afield. In 
many cases, the separate file will 
be in a standard FGDC format (text 
or XML) and can be easily 
imported to ArcGIS. Sometimes, 
however, the format is different or 
not quite correct, and the user will 
have a more difficult time 
implementing the metadata. After 
working with metadata for a while, 
you will learn to recognize the 
formats that are suitable and that can be imported into ArcGIS with a minimum of fuss. A number 
of programs and utilities have been developed to facilitate this process; for example, a program 
called mp (metadata parser) was created by the U.S. Geological Survey to read text-based 
CSDGM metadata and convert it to XML so that it can be ingested by ArcGIS; it is included in 
ArcGIS Desktop and can be run in the Python window (see ArcGIS Help for more information). 
Metadata development 
For data sets developed by you or your organization, the metadata process must start at the 
beginning. Although entering the metadata may be one of the final steps in producing the data set, 
the process begins earlier, when the data are being assembled—critical information must be 
recorded throughout the process so that it can be added to the metadata when the time comes. 
Imagine that you are digitizing a historical map of the Lewis and Clark journey. You initially 
need to record information about the map: author, year of publication, citation, scale, medium on 
which it was drafted, and so on. You would look for information about the positional accuracy or 
time period. Additional information is recorded as you process the data, including the RMS error 
of the georeferencing step, techniques or tests used to ensure topological integrity, processing 
tolerances, or information about content in the attribute fields. 
If you wait until the data set is complete, then critical information may be lost. It is good 
practice to develop a form on which notes can be recorded during the creation of the data, 
organized so that the information can be easily translated to the metadata at the end. You can

About ArcGIS 
Metadata management in ArcGIS 
Metadata functionality has been included in ArcGIS for many years. Although metadata software 
that works apart from ArcGIS is available, metadata managed within ArcGIS is convenient 
because it is stored as part of geospatial data sets. In addition, ArcGIS can automatically populate 
and update metadata elements from the dataset properties (coordinate system, number of features, 
etc.). ArcGIS 9 had two metadata editors, one for FGDC metadata and one for ISO 19115, with a 
translator to convert it (somewhat imperfectly) to ISO 19139. No capability existed to produce 
NAP metadata at ArcGIS 9. On the other hand, ArcGIS 9 supported import and export of text-
based format of FGDC metadata and applying it to data sets. 
In ArcGIS 9, metadata storage and editing capabilities were closely bound to the standard being 
used, making it difficult to meet the needs of all users in North America and internationally. In 
ArcGIS 10, a major redesign of metadata management was done to support multiple standards 
and to adapt to changes over time. This goal was accomplished by storing metadata information 
in an internal ArcGIS format, then translating and exporting it to a standards-compliant XML file 
when needed. Users who are not required to produce data accompanied by a specific metadata 
format can simply stay within the ArcGIS metadata framework. Two different levels of metadata 
support are provided for these users.  

Metadata 
419 
A streamlined set of descriptive information, called the Item Description, can be filled out within 
five minutes. This approach helps solve a long-standing problem—metadata were so complex and 
difficult that many people never bothered documenting a data set. The item description is easy to 
understand and to edit, and although it falls far short of a complete metadata record, it is much 
better than nothing. An Item Description can be created for any item type in ArcGIS, not just 
geographic datasets but also models, tables, scripts, and more. This minimum Item Description is 
required for every data set shared on ArcGIS Online. 
Users desiring greater levels of 
documentation can access and edit 
additional metadata information by 
specifying a Metadata Style in the 
application options (Fig. 14.3). The 
style is based on one of the metadata 
standards, and it controls which fields 
you will see when editing metadata. It 
also defines how the metadata are 
validated and exported to a  
standard. 
Users who are tasked with creating metadata conforming to a standard must edit the ArcGIS 
metadata content and then export it to a separate XML file, which can be posted on the Internet or 
submitted to a data clearinghouse. Metadata created in ArcGIS 9 using the FGDC or the ISO 
editor can be viewed in ArcGIS 10 but must be upgraded to be edited. This upgrade will be 
available (using an Upgrade button) if ArcGIS detects the presence of these metadata formats. 
In this chapter, we will cover the basic editing of ArcGIS metadata items using the North 
American Profile of ISO 19115, more as an introduction to understanding metadata and some of 
their key components rather than as a serious effort to train a metadata producer. 
TIP: The relationship among CSDGM metadata, ArcGIS metadata, ISO metadata, and other 
styles is complex. You can ignore this complexity if you are simply creating new metadata, but if 
you must work with data sets containing FGDC metadata developed prior to ArcGIS 10, you will 
need more guidance. See the ArcGIS Help under Geodata > Data Types > Metadata. 
The Metadata Editor 
In Chapter 2, you learned how to view the item description in the Catalog tab. To move beyond 
the simple description, you must specify a metadata style. Then the Metadata toolbar (Fig. 14.4) 
allows you to view, edit, import, 
export, and validate metadata 
(compare them to the requirements of 
the standard) using that style.  
Clicking the Edit button takes you to the metadata editor (Fig. 14.5). It is easy to use, but its 
organization may take some time to learn. There are three main sections: an Overview of the data 
set, a Metadata section containing information about the metadata themselves, and a Resource 
section containing information about the data set. There is no set order; the sections can be visited 
in any order and at any time. Each section has multiple items to be filled out. In some cases they

Chapter 14 
420 
already exist, and the user simply fills them in. In 
other sections, users must create containers first, 
which are then filled with content.  
Certain metadata fields are required by the standard in 
order to produce minimally compliant metadata. These 
boxes are filled in red to assist you in completing the 
information. In addition, error messages at the top of 
the editor let you known when an item is missing. 
Clicking the hyperlink may open the relevant item if it 
is not currently visible (although this feature may not 
“drill-down” all the way to the item flagged due to 
known ArcGIS software limitations). 
Some sections allow the user to add multiple items in 
an information category. For example, a data set 
might have used three data sources which all need to 
be documented (Fig. 14.6). Documenting at least one 
source is required information, and the entry boxes 
appear automatically. The Down arrows expand a 
section so that you can see its contents, and the Up 
arrows hide it again. You can type a general 
description above. You can also add items, such as a 
full-fledged citation, by clicking the + New Citation 
text. To add a second source, you would click the + 
New Source text to provide another container. The 
small red X symbol lets you delete a container if you 
decide you don’t need it after all.  
The ArcGIS 9 editors had places to enter 
all types of data quality reports, such as 
logical consistency, horizontal accuracy, 
vertical accuracy, and completeness, 
which in some cases were not applicable 
to a data set or the user had no useful 
information to impart. In the ArcGIS  
10 editor, a report entry is created only if 
you need it. You add the report, specify 
the type, and fill in the relevant details. 
Thus, the final metadata that you see 
contain only useful information, not rows 
of blank entries. 
Metadata templates 
Metadata standards require an impressive 
amount of information to be entered. 
Fortunately, much of this information is 
repeated verbatim in different data sets 
produced by the same organization. This 
fact makes the use of templates attractive.

Metadata 
421 
A metadata template contains the information that will be common to every data set produced 
by an organization or for a particular project. The contact information and access and use 
constraints, for example, are metadata fields that are likely to be consistent within an 
organization. 
Metadata templates can take a hierarchical approach (Fig. 14.7). Information common to every 
data set for the organization serves as the starting point. The template is then edited to include 
common information for a specific project (such as the contact information for the project 
manager). The usual practice for a company might be to make all data available only to clients, 
but if a certain project is funded as an educational effort, then the usual access constraints might 
be edited to make the data freely redistributable. Templates might have three levels of specificity: 
Organizational level: Contains fields that are the same for every data set produced by the 
organization. Examples are the organizational contact, the access and use constraints, and the 
metadata distribution constraints. 
Project level: Contains fields that are the same for every data set produced for a particular 
project. Some of the organizational-level fields might be edited for this level. Examples are the 
Purpose, the Data Set Credit, the organizational contact, and some of the key words. 
Organizational metadata template (XML file) 
Copy organizational template to a project template. 
Review project template and modify metadata sections 
that will be constant for this project/client. 
Distribute project template to all coworkers assembling 
data for the project. 
Keep notes as each data set is collected and processed. 
Import metadata from project template to each final 
feature layer. 
Fill out/edit sections that pertain to each feature layer. 
Fig. 14.7. A possible organizational process for using metadata templates 

Chapter 14 
422 
Data set level: Contains fields that must be entered for each data set, such as the Summary and 
Description, the citation information, and accuracy and completeness reports. 
The overall process might look something like Figure 14.7. The blue box refers to the 
organizational-level template, the orange boxes to the project-level template, and the green boxes 
to the data set–level metadata. The user starts by creating an empty XML file to serve as the 
metadata template. He then fills out all the sections common to every data set produced by the 
organization. This data set becomes the basic source for all subsequent metadata. 
When a new project is initiated, the project manager copies the organizational template to a 
project template. She reviews the metadata and edits any portions that will be constant for the 
project. This might include changing some of the organizational fields or adding new information 
to the template. Once the project template is complete and has been reviewed, it is distributed to 
all of the workers who are producing data for the project. As each data set is assembled, the 
workers take notes on the source and processing. When the data set is ready to have its metadata 
created, the worker imports the project template into the metadata for the new feature class. The 
data set–specific information is added to the metadata to make them complete. 
For guidance in filling out NAP metadata, the metadata editor itself provides tags that are visible 
when the cursor is placed on a particular item. In addition, many of the NAP and CSDGM items 
are similar, and suggestions for one are equally valid for the other.  
Metadata maps 
The end of this chapter includes ArcGIS/NAP and CSDGM metadata maps that show the 
structure of the metadata in outline form and suggest what fields should be filled out for the 
organizational template, which ones might be edited or added for the project template, the fields 
that must be filled out for each data set, and the fields that are automatically generated by 
ArcGIS. They provide a good overview of what information is needed. 
When first developing a metadata template, it is easier to compose the material in a word 
processor rather than in the metadata editor itself; it is much easier to see the structure, and it is 
more convenient to e-mail it to an individual or committee to review and get comments back 
using standard editing/tracking methods. Once the draft is complete, the information can be 
transferred to the metadata editor by copying and pasting into the relevant sections. 
The metadata maps printed in the final pages of this chapter are provided as Word and .RTF 
documents in the mgisdata\Metadata folder, if you wish to use them to compose metadata 
templates by deleting the italicized sections and replacing them with the information for the 
metadata. (You cannot see the files in the Catalog, but you will see them in Windows Explorer.) 
Summary 
¾ Metadata records provide information needed to discover geospatial data, document the 
history of a data set, and provide the data quality information needed to ascertain its fitness 
for an intended purpose. 
¾ Metadata standards and formats have been established by the Federal Geographic Data 
Committee (FGDC) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). 
¾ United States metadata standards are currently in flux as users migrate from the current 
FGDC CSDGM standard to a new international standard, the North American Profile of ISO 
19115. International users are more likely to use the ISO 19139 or 19115 standard. 

Metadata 
423 
¾ Six key data quality issues are lineage, positional accuracy, attribute accuracy, logical 
consistency, completeness, and temporal accuracy. 
¾ CSDGM metadata are organized into seven main sections, including Identification, Data 
Quality, Data Organization, Spatial Reference, Entity Attributes, Distribution, and Metadata 
Reference. NAP metadata have a different organization, but many of the sections are similar. 
¾ ArcGIS automatically fills out some sections of metadata. 
¾ Establishing templates can reduce the work needed to prepare metadata.

Mastering the Skills 
Teaching Tutorial 
The following examples provide step-by-step instructions for doing basic tasks and solving basic 
problems in ArcGIS. The steps you need to do are highlighted with an arrow Î; follow them 
carefully. Click on the video number in the Video Index to view a demonstration of the steps. 
In this tutorial, we will first examine some metadata examples to see what good metadata look 
like. We will then create metadata for the weather map that we georeferenced in Chapter 3. For 
an extended metadata editing session, some find ArcCatalog easier to use than the Catalog tab in 
ArcMap, but either may be used as preferred. 
  Î Start ArcCatalog, or open the Catalog tab in ArcMap and open the Item Description 
window. 
Examining metadata 
Most of the feature classes in the usdata geodatabase came from the ESRI Data and Maps DVD 
that is distributed with the ArcGIS software. The ESRI metadata provide excellent examples to 
learn from. 
1Î Navigate to the mgisdata\Usa folder and expand the usdata geodatabase. 
1Î Click the quakehis layer to highlight it, and click the Description tab. 
1Î Skim the information here, making sure you scroll to the end. 
By default, ArcCatalog shows only the basic descriptive information here, the Item Description. 
To view and work with more extensive metadata, the setting must be changed. 
2Î Choose Customize > ArcCatalog (or ArcMap) Options from the main toolbar. 
2Î Click the Metadata tab. 
2Î Change the metadata style to North American Profile of ISO 19115 2003. Click OK. 
2Î Click the Preview tab and then click the Description tab to update the view. 
2Î Scroll down again and notice how much more information there is, including two 
sections for ArcGIS Metadata and FGDC Metadata. 
Styles may be based on a standard such as ISO 19115. ArcGIS stores the metadata information 
internally in its own format. The metadata style controls which information items are displayed 
and edited. The metadata can be exported to the standard format if needed.  
TIP: The large-font blue headings are section headings and may be 
collapsed (side arrow) or expanded (down arrow). Use these headings 
to hide or view the information as directed in the next steps. 
3Î Start by collapsing all the headings under ArcGIS Metadata, if necessary, so that you 
can see the organization of the 18 sections. 
3Î Expand the Topics and Keywords section and skim through the information. 
3Î Close it when you are finished, by clicking the Topics and Keywords heading again 
or by using the Hide hyperlink at the bottom of the section. 

Metadata 
425 
TIP: After you are finished examining each section in the following steps, close it again. 
3Î Examine the Citation section. 
  1. What was the publication date for this data set? ______________ 
3Î Examine the Citation Contacts section. 
  2. Who originated this data set?________________ Who is the publisher? ___________ 
4Î Examine the Resource Details section. 
4Î Examine the Resource Points of Contact to find out whom you might contact with 
questions about this data set. 
4Î Examine the Resource Maintenance section to find out how often this data set is 
updated. 
Let’s look more closely at where this data set came from. 
5Î Expand the Lineage section and look at the process steps 
  3. How many process steps are listed? _______ When did they occur? _______________ 
  4. What source was used to compile this data set? _______________________  
  5. Can you find the original scale (scale denominator) of this data set? ________________ 
TIP: In Chapter 6, we were puzzled why some earthquakes prior to 1960 had magnitudes and 
some didn’t. This metadata suggests the reason: several sources were combined to make this 
feature class, and not all of them may have included magnitude estimates for older earthquakes. 
6Î Examine the Spatial Reference section to see the coordinate system. 
6Î Examine the Spatial Data Properties. 
 
7Î Expand the Data Quality section. There are five data quality reports for this data set. 
7Î Examine the names and content of the five reports, comparing them to the data 
quality issues discussed in this chapter. 
 
8Î Examine the Distribution section. 
  6. How does one obtain a copy of these data? __________________________________ 
8Î Examine the Metadata Details and Metadata Contacts section. 
  7. Who produced the metadata? __________________ What standard was used?____________ 
8Î Examine the Fields section. 
  8. What is the earthquake depth unit of measurement? _____________

Clearly, it takes a lot of effort to document data sets to this level of detail. Not all data sets are 
this well documented, but all data sets need at least minimal information. As you continue to 
learn about metadata, you can go back to the data sets in this usdata geodatabase for good 
examples of how metadata are organized and what types of information go into each section. 
Creating a project template 
You have been provided with an organizational template from a fictional company called Re-GIS, 
Inc., which distributes weather and climate data sets by FTP download, usually at a cost. Imagine 
that you are the project manager for a new initiative to provide a freely distributable monthly 
summary of precipitation based on National Weather Service radar data. You will create a project 
template for use with the data sets to be developed for this project. 
9Î In ArcCatalog, navigate to the mgisdata\Metadata directory and click on the 
REGIS_OrgTemplate XML file to highlight it. 
9Î Click the Description tab, if necessary, and examine the various sections of ArcGIS 
metadata.  
9Î Scroll through the metadata, noting the type of information that is already filled out. 
Since this is only a template, many of the sections are still blank. The spatial information, for 
example, is only applicable to spatial data and is updated automatically by ArcCatalog. Therefore, 
it is not present in this XML template.  
The organizational template contains information that will be the same for all data produced by 
the company. Your project template will include this information, as well as information that will 
be the same for all data sets produced for the project. The sections unique to each data set will be 
left blank, to be filled in as each data set is created. 
10Î Right-click the REGIS_OrgTemplate XML file and choose Copy. 
10Î Right-click the Metadata folder entry and choose Paste. 
10Î Click on the new REGIS_OrgTemplate(1) XML file twice slowly, and rename it 
Radar_Project_Template. 
TIP: To create a completely empty XML file to start your own organizational template, right-
click a folder and choose New > XML Document, and give it a name. 
11Î Click on the Radar_Project_Template file to highlight it and click the Edit button 
on the Description tab.  
11Î Examine the outline of sections on the left side of the editing window. 
The Overview section contains a general description of the data set. The Metadata section 
contains information about the metadata, such as who created them and whom to contact with 
questions about them. The Resource section contains detailed information about the data set. 
TIP: When you place the cursor in a box, a pop-up at the bottom of the ArcCatalog window tells 
you the type of information that it should contain. 

Metadata 
427 
11Î The Title, Tags, and Description will be different for each data set, so leave them 
blank. 
11Î For the Summary, enter This data set was developed for educational use 
for studying the spatial distribution of rainfall events in the United 
States. 
11Î For the Credits, type Based on data provided by the National Weather 
Service. This data set is freely distributable for noncommercial purposes 
with inclusion of citation and full metadata. 
11Î Set the sliders for the Appropriate Scale Range from Continent to State. 
11Î Save your edits and start editing again. 
TIP: A red boundary around an item indicates that the content is required by the standard 
currently specified in the Metadata Style. 
12Î Click on Overview: Topics & Keywords in the outline. 
12Î Check the Atmospheric Sciences box. 
12Î Set the Content Type to Downloadable Data. 
12Î Click on the + New Theme Keywords text. 
12Î Enter precipitation, NEXRAD, radar as key words. 
 
13Î Click on + New Place Keywords and enter United States. 
13Î Click on + New Temporal Keywords and enter 2013. 
TIP: The dates to be entered reflect when this tutorial was written. You may change them to 
dates that make sense for when you are doing the tutorial, if you wish. 
Next you will enter the Citation information, showing how it should be cited by others. 
14Î Click on Overview: Citation. Notice the messages at the top, telling you that this 
information is required by the metadata standard. 
14Î Enter the Citation Title as Monthly Summary of Radar Precipitation for 2013.  
14Î Click on + New Presentation Form and set the Presentation Form drop-down to Digital 
Map. Set the FGDC Geospatial Data Presentation Form to Raster Digital Data. 
14Î Expand the Dates entry. The Created date will be unique for each data set, so leave 
it blank.  
14Î The data are scheduled for publishing on 3/31/2014. Click on the Published 
calendar icon and click the Date, Year heading on top of the calendar to move quickly 
to March 2014. Enter 3/31/2014.  
14Î Notice that the error messages at the top have disappeared, as has the red X on the 
Citation section. 
14Î Save your edits and start editing again. 

Chapter 14 
428 
TIP: Save your edits frequently! 
15Î Click on the Citation Contacts section.  
15Î Expand the Contact and the Contact Information sections. 
This information was present in the organizational template, saving you some typing. It could be 
customized with your name, but generally it is wiser to keep it generic, to a position rather than a 
person, in case of future personnel changes. The next section provides more information about the 
metadata themselves. 
16Î Click on the Metadata: Details section. 
16Î Click Create to create the File Identifier. 
16Î Set the Function to Information. 
16Î Set the Date Stamp to today’s date. 
16Î Set the Language to English and the country to UNITED STATES. 
16Î Set the Hierarchy Level to Dataset. 
 
17Î Click the Metadata: Contacts section. Again, this information was provided by the 
organizational template. 
The previous contact information you saw referenced the data set. This one references the 
metadata. In this case they are the same. 
18Î Click the Metadata: Constraints entry. Expand the Down arrows. The information 
from the organizational template is in here and does not need updating. 
18Î In the Security Constraints section, set the Classification to Unclassified. 
18Î Click Save and start editing again. 
The Resource section contains information about the data set itself. Some of it will seem familiar 
because you already set it in the Metadata section. 
19Î Click on the Resource: Details entry. 
19Î Set the Language to en for English, and the Country to the United States. 
19Î Leave the other information blank, to be filled in for each data set. 
 
20Î Examine the Resource: Extents entry. This part will be filled in by ArcGIS for each 
data set. 
20Î Examine the Resource: Points of Contact. Again, the template took care of it. 
TIP: Notice that the metadata require multiple contacts to be filled in, often with the same 
information. The Overview: Contacts Manager and the Load a Contact button let you reuse 
previously entered contacts to save typing. The drop-down list seems to have a bug and does not 
show the actual names, which makes it confusing. Use it for your own metadata with caution. 

Metadata 
429 
21Î Click on the Resource: Maintenance entry. 
21Î Change the Update Frequency to Not Planned. The rest of the information would be 
filled out if you were planning to update the data after publication, but that is not the 
case for this project. 
 
22Î Click on Resource: Constraints and expand the General Constraints entry. 
22Î Delete the first sentence of the Use Limitation, since the free distribution policy for 
this project is different from the usual company policy. 
22Î Save and start editing again. 
 
23Î Click the Resource: Spatial Reference entry. This section will be filled in by 
ArcGIS. 
23Î Click the Resource: Spatial Data Representation entry. This section will be filled in 
by ArcGIS. 
The Content, Quality, and Lineage sections will be different for each data set produced by the 
project, so these are left blank for now. Going on, the Distribution section explains how someone 
can obtain the data. 
23Î Click on the Resource: Distribution section. 
23Î Click the + New Distribution Format entry. 
23Î For the Format Name, enter ArcGIS File Geodatabase. 
23Î For the Format Version, enter Version 10.1 (or whatever you are using). 
The actual distributor is the manager of the company web sites, so the next section is for the 
company web master. 
24Î Expand the Distributor entry. 
24Î Expand the Contact entry and the Contact Information entry.  
24Î Click the + New Online Resource text. You may need to expand the Distributor and 
Contact Information entries again. 
24Î Enter http://www.ReGIS.MonthlyRadar.com for the Linkage. 
24Î Enter ftp for the Protocol. 
24Î For Name, enter Monthly Summary of Radar Precipitation. 
24Î For Description, enter Download site for educational data sets of monthly 
radar precipitation. 
24Î Set the Function to Download. 
 
25Î Scroll down, if necessary, and click the + New Ordering Process entry. Change the 
Fees to Free. 
25Î You intend to release the data at the end of March 2014. Change the Available Date 
to 3/31/2014. 
25Î Enter Download for Ordering Instructions. 

Chapter 14 
430 
25Î Enter Immediate for Turnaround. 
25Î Click Save. 
The project template is now complete. 
Importing the template 
Now you will create metadata for your first data layer for the project. The nwsradar.img image in 
migsdata\Metadata was downloaded and georeferenced from the National Weather Service (as 
you did in Chapter 3). It will serve as an example of the data used to generate the final product 
and is to be included in the publication data set. We will create metadata for it. 
IMPORTANT TIP: It is recommended to turn off background processing before running the 
Import/Export tools. 
26Î Choose Geoprocessing > Geoprocessing Options from the main menu bar. 
26Î Uncheck the Enable box for background processing, if necessary. Click OK. 
 
27Î Click on the nwsradar.img raster in the mgisdata\Metadata folder to highlight it. 
Note the virtually empty metadata. 
27Î Click the Import button on the Metadata toolbar. 
27Î For the Source Metadata, click the browse button and navigate to the 
mgisdata\Metadata folder. 
27Î Choose the Radar_Project_Template XML file and click Add. 
27Î The metadata you’ve been entering are stored in the internal ArcGIS format, so 
change the Import Type to FROM_ARCGIS. 
27Î Click OK to start importing. 
 
28Î Click on nwsradar.img in the Table of Contents. 
28Î Scroll down and examine the metadata now. 
The metadata for this raster, which were essentially blank a moment ago, have been updated with 
the information from your template. ArcCatalog also filled in some information, for example, 
about the spatial storage format and the coordinate system. 
28Î Click on the Preview tab in ArcCatalog. 
28Î Click the Thumbnail button. 
28Î Click the Description tab again. 
The metadata have been updated to include the thumbnail you just created. 
Entering metadata for an item 
Now we will finish entering the metadata for the nwsradar image. However, you will need to 
know some information about the source data. You had one of your coworkers investigate the 
web site where the information was obtained and talk to the people at the National Weather 
Service who provide the radar data. She has assembled the information in Table 14.3 for you.

30Î Click Save and start editing again. 
The rest of the Overview section should also remain the same, as set up in the project template. 
Next we turn to documenting the Content, Quality, and Lineage sections. The data set is a raster 
representation of a map rather than a directly measured image like a Landsat scene, so we will use 
the Coverage type to describe the content. 
31Î Click on the Resource: Content section. 
31Î Click the red X to delete the Image Description entry. 
31Î Click the + New Coverage Description entry. 
31Î For the Attribute Description, enter NEXRAD Radar in DBZ (decibels) and set 
the Content Type to Image.

We now turn to the Quality section. We only need to enter a report for quality information that 
we actually have, which is an estimate of the positional accuracy. 
32Î Click the Resource: Quality section. 
32Î Set the Level Scope to Dataset. 
32Î Click + New Report and set the Report Type to Relative Internal Positional Accuracy. 
32Î Set the Dimension to horizontal. 
 
33Î Click + New Quantitative Result. 
33Î For Value Type, enter Georeferencing RMS Error. 
33Î Enter 0.02 for the Value and select plane angle: degree deg for the Value Unit. 
33Î Save and return to editing. 
Next we need to document the Lineage of the data, which includes the sources and processing. 
When entering sources, one can be satisfied with a general statement and/or source description, or 
one can construct a detailed citation. We will do both, although some of the fields will be blank. 
This section is somewhat more extended than the others. 
34Î Click the Resource: Lineage section. 
34Î In the Statement box, type Radar image was downloaded from the National

Exercises 
Imagine that your class includes a GIS project (as it may). Search the Internet for two data sets 
that you might use for your project. Print MetadataNotes (.docx or .rtf) in the mgisdata\Metadata 
folder and fill it out for each data set (or fill it out electronically and print afterward). 
Challenge Problem 
Prepare a metadata template for your class project (or use your home state geodatabase). Save a 
copy of one of the metadata maps (see below) in the mgisdata\Metadata folder. Determine which 
sections will be filled for the template; delete the italicized text and replace them with actual 
information. Leave the italicized sections alone if the template will be blank for that section. Print 
and turn in for your instructor to review. Afterward, enter the information into an XML document 
to create the template.

see if the data contain dangles, gaps, or overlaps? What tests were applied, and what were the 
results? 
Completeness Report: Provide information about omissions, selection criteria, generalization, and 
other processes that might impact how complete a data set is. Are all spatial entities included? For 
example, did you get all the wells or might some be missing? Did you subset the data from their 
original source? Were any criteria used in deciding which features to include (public versus private 
roads, for example)? 
Attribute Accuracy Report: Summarize processes used to establish the accuracy of the attribute(s), 
for example, known detection limits of analyses. Evaluate detail or completeness of categorical 
classes. Provide known information about problems with any attributes. If no accuracy data are 
available, enter “Unknown.”

5. Entity Attribute 
Fill out either the Detailed Description tab or the Overview Description tab, whichever makes the 
most sense for documenting the attribute values of that particular data set. 
Detailed Description 
Entity Type 
Attribute 
General 
This section is mostly filled in for you, but, for each attribute important to the data set, you should enter 
a Definition, including units. For a field titled “TMDL”, you should enter “Total Maximum Daily Load 
in mg/l”. For an Area field, you might enter “Feature area in sq km”. If you wish to enter accuracies for 
fields, you can, but this is optional. The Definition Source describes who defined a particular attribute. 
If you are using Anderson landcover categories Level I or Level II, for example, you would enter it. If it 
is very generic or obvious, such as acres or population, just leave this part blank.  
You don’t have to fill in a Definition for every field, but you should do it for anything that is not 
obvious and/or needs interpretation, units, and so on. Think about the information YOU would want 
to know if you had to use this data set. 
Overview Description 
This is the place to save time if you have many fields in a data set with the same type of data. For 
example, an agricultural table might have 20 fields of different animal counts and 30 fields of 
agricultural production for different crops in acres. In some cases, you might have a large table of 
values that are not obvious. If you are using zoning codes and the table does not include a text 
description, you will need to provide that information as a separate table in the database. Here you 
could reference the name of that table so that people know where to find out what the codes mean. 
Data Set Overview 
Describe the general purpose of the table, for example, “This data set lists animal counts and 
production of various crops by county.” 
Entity and Attribute Overview 
Describe the main characteristics, such as animal counts in number of animals, stocking densities in 
cow/calf units per acre, or production in bushels. You can put them all in one entry or add multiple 
entries using the + button at the bottom, such as one for animal counts, one for production, and so on. 
6. Distribution 
This section describes whether and how the data could be ordered from a vendor/distributor, if 
applicable. It also is where you put your standard liability clause. 
General 
Provide general instructions on how to access the data, costs, if any, and what form the distribution 
takes. 
Distributor 
Enter the agency or person responsible for distributing the data and the contact information. 
Standard Order Process 
Enter the procedures to be followed to order or access the data. 
Available Time Period 
This is the time when the data will be available to the clients or public. Enter starting date of data 
availability and end date of availability, if known. 
7. Metadata Reference 
General 
Provide metadata date, contact info of person or organization that created the metadata, and access 
and redistribution limits on metadata, if any.

BASICS 
General 
Starting ArcMap or ArcCatalog 
  1. Look on the computer desktop or taskbar for an icon for 
ArcCatalog (left) or ArcMap (right). Double-click it to start the 
program. 
  2. If no icon is present on the desktop, click the Start button on the computer’s menu bar. 
Navigate to All Programs > ArcGIS and choose the name of the program desired. 
  3. From ArcCatalog, launch ArcMap by clicking the ArcMap button in the menu bar.  
  4. From ArcMap, launch the ArcCatalog window, which sits inside ArcMap and provides 
access to some of the ArcCatalog functions but does not open the standalone program. 
Managing windows 
Both ArcMap and ArcGIS have numerous windows that can be opened when needed and closed 
or tucked away at other times. Windows may float above the main program window, or they may 
be docked in one of several docking locations. When docked, they may also be pinned, which 
causes them to open when the mouse is placed on them and to automatically hide when not in 
use. A window will generally return to the place where it was previously docked or pinned after it 
is closed and reopened. 
Docking a window 
Docking is lengthy to explain because there are so many options, but it is 
really relatively simple. Watch the video, or experiment until you are 
comfortable using the docking functions. 
  1. Click on the bar at the top of the window and drag it to one of the 
blue docking icons that will automatically appear. One icon will turn 
darker blue to show in which location the window will dock when 
you release the mouse. 
  2. If a window is already docked at the location, another set of 
four docking icons will appear next to the original. The second 
set shows where the new window will be docked relative to the 
existing window (left, right, below, or above) on that side of 
the main window. If the window is dragged to the center icon, 
then both old and new windows will be placed in the same 
spot with tabs underneath for switching between them. 
  3. To undock a window, click on its top bar and drag it away from the docked location. 
Dock it somewhere else. 
  4. To make a window float again, click its top bar, drag it off any of the docking icons, and 
release the mouse. 

BASICS: General 
446 
Auto Hide a window 
A docked window will have an Auto Hide button on its bar. 
  1. Click the Auto Hide button to pin the window to the 
docking location (Fig. 1). It will become a tab on that 
side of the main window. 
  2. To access the window, hover the cursor on top of the 
tab. The window should open automatically, but you 
can click it if it is stubborn. 
  3. When you move the cursor off the window, it will 
automatically hide in the tab. Sometimes you must 
actually click elsewhere before it hides. 
  4. Click the X on the window bar to close the window 
and remove the tab. 
  5. Click the pin again to unpin the window. It will remain open 
in the docked location. 
Adjusting window sizes 
  1. The size of a floating window can be adjusted by clicking 
and dragging the corners or edges to the desired size. 
  2. The width of a docked toolbar can be adjusted by placing the 
cursor on the edge until a double-headed arrow appears  
(Fig. 2). Click and drag the edge to the desired width. 
  3. The height of a docked toolbar matches the window edge 
available. However, if two or more windows are docked 
above/below each other, then the relative width may be 
adjusted by placing the cursor on the edge between the 
windows. When the cursor changes to the double-headed 
arrow, click and drag the edge to the desired position. 
  4. Some windows have multiple panels, each of which is 
individually adjustable. Look for the gray line in between 
the panels. Click and drag it to adjust the relative size of the 
panels. 
Managing toolbars 
Dozens of toolbars are available and may be opened and closed as 
needed. Toolbars may be docked on any of the four edges of the 
program window, or they may float above the window 
(Fig. 3). 
  1. To move a floating toolbar, click and drag on 
the bar at the top to move it to a new location. 
To dock it, move it to one of the edges of the 
program and it will dock when it finds an open 
spot.

  2. To move a docked toolbar, click on its handle (the dashed gray line on its left edge) and 
drag it to the desired position elsewhere on the GUI.  
  3. To move a docked toolbar off the GUI, use the handle to drag it off the GUI. It then becomes 
a floating toolbar. It can be docked again by dragging it to a location on the GUI. 
  4. To open a toolbar that is not present, choose Customize > Toolbars from the main menu 
and select the desired toolbar. 
  5. To close a floating toolbar, click on the X box in its upper-right corner.  
  6. To close a docked toolbar, right-click on a toolbar or empty space and choose the toolbar 
to close from the list. 
  7. To find out the name of a tool or button, hold the cursor on top of it for a moment without 
clicking, and the name will pop up. 
Creating/deleting folder connections 
In order to access data files, you must set up a 
connection to the folder in which they reside. 
Connections may be established from ArcCatalog 
or ArcMap and will be available to both programs 
once created. Connections can be deleted when 
they are no longer in use. 
The Connect to Folder button may be found on the 
Standard toolbar in ArcCatalog, on the Catalog tab 
in ArcMap, or on the Add Data window in 
ArcMap. 
  1. To connect to a folder, click on the 
Connect to Folder button.  
  2. Navigate down the directory tree and click 
on the folder (or drive letter) to connect to, 
and click OK (Fig. 4).  
  3. The connections are stored in ArcCatalog 
in an entry called Folder Connections. 
  4. To delete a folder connection, right-click the folder connection in ArcCatalog or in the 
Catalog tab and choose Disconnect Folder. This step only removes the connection; it does 
not delete the data from the disk.

such as background processing, overwriting of existing files, and how long results are 
kept.  
Connecting to an Internet service 
Using ArcCatalog, you can connect to and access data from external databases or from spatial 
database services. A Database Server or Database Connection provides access to a tabular 
database such as Oracle. An ArcGIS or ArcIMS Server provides access to spatial data. You must 
know the type of service and the URL, such as  
http://www.geographynetwork.com. Secure services will 
also require a login and password.  
  1. In ArcCatalog, scroll to the bottom of the Catalog 
Tree to find the server connections (Fig. 5). In 
ArcMap, open the Catalog tab or click the Add 
Data button and find the server connections in the 
file drop-down. 
  2. Expand one of the entries in Figure 5, depending 
on the type of service to be added 
  3. Double-click one of the Add icons. 
  4. Type in the URL of the service in the top box. 
  5. If the server requires a user login and password, 
enter these at the bottom of the window and click 
OK. 
  6. Predefined connections are provided to ArcGIS 
Online and Geography Network.

Layers and layer properties 
A layer includes a pathname reference to a spatial data set plus various properties that control 
how that data set is displayed and used. In ArcMap, layers are held in memory and saved as part 
of the map document. In ArcCatalog, layers are stored in layer files. 
Setting layer properties 
Properties set for a layer do not modify the referenced data set. Detailed instructions for setting 
various properties are found under the appropriate headings.

Environment settings 
Environment settings control the 
operation of tools and functions in both 
ArcMap and ArcCatalog. Environment 
settings may be set at the program 
level, where they affect all tools, or 
they may be set for a single run of a 
particular tool. Environment settings 
are organized into functional groups, 
some of which are shown in Figure 14. 
Use ArcCatalog to specify 
environments that will be used as 
defaults by all tools and map 
documents. Environments changed 
within a map document in ArcMap 
will be saved with that map document.

12. If running in background, a blue scrolling status bar will appear at the bottom of the 
program (Fig. 16), and a notification will appear to indicate that the tool has finished. 
13. In foreground processing, a status window will appear with messages indicating progress. 
Close the window when it is finished, or check the box to close the window automatically 
on successful completion. If errors occur, the box will remain open so you can read the 
messages. 
 
TIP: Background processing is slower for short tasks than foreground processing, and it is more 
likely to cause crashes. The author STRONGLY recommends that you turn off background 
processing and keep it off unless you have a need for it. 
Fig. 16. In background 
processing, a scrolling bar 
keeps track of progress and a

Adding data 
  1. Click the Add Data button on the main toolbar, or choose File > Add Data from the main 
menu bar. 
  2. Use the Add Data dialog box to navigate to the folder containing the data to open  
(see Opening/Saving data sets). 
  3. Click on the data item to select it. Select multiple items by holding down the Ctrl or Shift 
key while clicking additional data sets. 
  4. Click Add. The data will be added to the active data frame. 
TIP: If the disk or directory containing the data does not appear in the list, you probably need to 
add a folder connection to it (Creating/deleting folder connections). 
Removing data 
Removing data removes them from the map document but does not delete them from the disk. 
  1. Right-click the data item in the Table of Contents and choose Remove. 
Saving a map document 
  1. Click on the Save button, or choose File > Save from the menu bar. 
  2. If the document has not previously been saved, a dialog box appears for the user to select 
a location and a name for the map document. Navigate to a directory in which to save it 
and then enter a name for the document. 
  3. Choose File > Save As from the menu bar to save the map document under a new name, 
leaving the original version unchanged. Specify the location and name as for Step 2. 
TIP: The names of map documents, spatial data sets, and folders should not contain spaces or 
special characters such as #, @, &, *. Use the underscore character _ to create spaces in names, if 
necessary. Although ArcCatalog and ArcMap allow spaces in names, spaces can create problems 
for certain advanced functions. It is wise to avoid them entirely.

The Table of Contents window 
The Table of Contents controls many of the display and other functions 
available in the program. It contains the layers and data frames that make 
up the map document. It offers four different views of the data, which are 
controlled by a set of icons on the top of the window. Each view has 
different settings and different options in the context menus. A few of the more common tasks are 
described below for each view. 
List By Drawing Order 
List By Drawing Order lists the layers according 
to the order in which they are drawn, from 
bottom to top (Fig. 18). It is the default view.  
  1. To turn a layer on/off, click the check box. 
  2. Right-click an item name to open a 
context menu. The menu choices 
depend on the type of item clicked.

Preventing script errors when opening geoprocessing tools 
ArcCatalog has a recurring problem that a script error occurs when opening a tool in ArcToolbox. 
It happens if the Description tab, or Item Description window in the Catalog tab, has been visited. 
The next time one tries to open a tool, a script error is generated and the program hangs and must 
be stopped and restarted. If you would like a detailed description of why this error occurs and 
what can be done to prevent it, see https://gisnuts.com/terra/blog/2013/01/22/arcgis-
geoprocessing-tools-scripting-error. 
For a more expedient solution, try the following, with ArcMap and ArcCatalog both closed. 
  1. Open Internet Explorer and choose Tools > Internet options. 
  2. Click the Security tab. 
  3. Click the Custom Level button. 
  4. Scroll down and find the Allow previously unused ActiveX controls to run without 
prompting option, and choose Enable (Fig. 31). 
  5. Click OK in all the windows and close Internet Explorer. 
  6. Start ArcMap or ArcCatalog. The script error should no longer occur.

field, before doing another. 
  8. If desired, enter default values for 
additional items by repeating  
Steps 3–7. 
  9. Click OK to effect the changes and 
close the window. 
TIP: The domain type must match the field type. A long integer domain cannot be applied to a 
short integer field, for example. Only valid domains will be listed for a field. 
Creating subtypes 
Subtypes allow you to specify different defaults and behaviors for groups of features in a single 
feature class. Before starting, make sure that you have planned the subtype categories, created the 
other fields contained in the feature class table, and entered any domains to be used by the fields. 
Also plan the default values to be defined for each subtype. 
  1. In ArcCatalog, open the properties of the feature class to be given the subtypes. 
  2. Click the Fields tab. Create a short integer field that will be used to define the subtype 
categories. See Adding or deleting fields. Do not set any defaults here. Click Apply to 
ensure that the field is created before going on to the next step.

fields in ArcCatalog before creating the network to obtain this information. 
We will assign two distance weights based on both miles and kilometers (Fig. 41). They are 
single-precision Float fields named MILES and KM. 
  8. Click New to add the first 
weight (Fig. 42). 
  9. Enter Distance-MI for the 
weight name and choose the 
Single Type. Leave the 
Bitgate Size alone. Click OK. 
10. The Distance-MI weight is 
entered in the weights list. 
Click on it to highlight it. 
11. In the panel underneath, click 
in the box under Field Name 
and choose MILES as the 
attribute field to associate with 
the weight. 
12. Click New to add the second 
weight. Name it Distance-
KM and set the type to Single. 
Click OK. 
13. Highlight the Distance-KM weight in the upper box. Select KM in the lower field name 
box for the attribute field. Click Next. 
14. Review the summary and choose Finish. 
TIP: For the network to operate correctly, all edges must meet each other at junctions with no 
gaps or dangles. This adjustment may have already been done using planar topology, in which 
case you don’t need to snap when creating the network. If not, you may be able to automatically 
fix the dangles by indicating a snap tolerance in map units. It must be large enough to fix the 
errors but not so large that features are incorrectly snapped together. Setting a good tolerance can 
be tricky, which is why snapping is often done interactively using topology. Choosing Yes may 
make changes to your data, so be careful and have a backup copy just in case. 
TIP: If you make a mistake or need to change the network, the easiest way is to delete it and start 
over. Right-click the Transportation_Net entry in the feature dataset and choose Delete. It will 
remove the logical network but leave the majroads feature class as is.

Creating a planar topology 
A planar topology uses rules to define the desired spatial relationships within and between feature 
classes. It can test features for adherence to the rules, and it provides tools for finding and fixing 
errors. A planar topology can only be created for a feature dataset, and only feature classes in the 
feature dataset can participate. 
  1. Right-click the feature dataset 
to contain the topology and 
choose New > Topology. 
Click Next to begin. 
  2. Enter a name for the topology 
(Fig. 43). 
  3. Change the default cluster 
tolerance if desired. Read 
about the cluster tolerance or 
the Help before changing the 
default. Click Next. 
  4. Check the boxes for the 
feature classes that will 
participate in the topology. 
Click Next. 
  5. Change the default ranks if 
you have features that are 
more accurate than others 
that should not be moved 
during clustering. More 
accurate features can be 
ranked higher and will not 
move. Click Next. 
  6. Click Add Rule. For a single 
feature class rule, choose the 
feature class and the rule. For 
a two-layer rule, choose the 
first feature class, the rule, 
and the second feature class. 
Click OK to add the rule. 
Continue until all rules are 
added. 
  7. Rule sets can be saved and used again for another topology. Click Next. 
  8. Read the summary and click Finish to create the topology. 
  9. Choose Yes if you want to validate the topology immediately.  
TIP: Validation includes clustering, which can move features and degrade feature accuracy 
depending on the cluster tolerance. Always have a backup before you validate.

Adding or deleting fields 
Fields may be added to tables in two ways. The first way uses ArcCatalog or the Catalog tab to 
enter and define new fields in the data set properties. This way is most efficient when you are 
entering many fields at once. You can also add a field in the Table window in ArcMap. 
IMPORTANT TIP: Note that field names must have 13 or fewer characters; may include letters, 
numbers, and the underscore character (_); and should not contain spaces or special characters 
such as @, #, !, $, or %. Field names must also start with a letter, not a number. 
Using the data set properties 
  1. If the table is currently open 
in ArcMap, use the Catalog 
tab. Or use ArcCatalog after 
making sure that the table is 
not open in ArcMap. 
  2. Navigate to the table in the 
Catalog Tree in the 
ArcCatalog window or the 
Catalog tab.  
  3. Right-click the table in the 
Catalog Tree and choose 
Properties from the context 
menu. 
  4. Click the Fields tab (Fig. 53). 
  5. Scroll down the list of fields, 
if necessary, to the first 
empty space at the bottom. 
Click on the empty space and 
type in the name of the new 
field.  
  6. Click on the Data Type box to the right of the new field, and a drop-down list of field 
types will appear. Choose the appropriate type. 
  7. View the field properties in the lower part of the dialog box and change any that need it, 
such as the length of a text field, a default value, or a domain. 
  8. Repeat Steps 5–8 until all the fields have been added. 
  9. Click OK or Apply to enter the changes in the Properties dialog box. 
10. To delete a field, follow Steps 1–4 to bring up the table’s Fields tab. Select the field by 
clicking on the gray tab next to its name, and press the Delete key. Warning: You cannot 
undo this step.

Calculating fields 
Use the Field Calculator in ArcMap to enter information into many records at once, either the 
entire table or a selected set. The information entered can be as a single number, a text value, or a 
mathematical expression. Calculations may be done outside of an edit session, but then they 
cannot be undone. 
TIP: If the field is not empty before you 
perform a calculation, be VERY sure 
that you intend to erase the existing 
values in the field and replace them with 
the calculated values. 
  1. With the table open, right-click 
on the (usually empty) field to 
be calculated and choose Field 
Calculator. The Field Calculator 
will appear (Fig. 55). 
  2. Enter the expression in the box. 
Double-click a field name to 
enter it in the box. Click on 
operators to include those. 
Double-click functions to enter 
them. Numbers may be entered 
from the keyboard. 
  3. For example, the expression in 
Figure 55 was created by 
double-clicking [HISPANIC] in the Fields box, clicking the / operator, double-clicking 
[POP2000], clicking the * operator, and typing 100. 
  4. Click OK. 
  5. Complex expressions that are used frequently may be saved as *.cal files and loaded

Joins and relates are used to link information from two different tables, based on a field that is 
common to both. The fields may be numeric or string fields, and they may have different names.  
In a join, information from the source table is appended to the destination table. The destination 
table will then have its original fields plus the fields from the source table.  
  1. In the Table of Contents, 
right-click on the destination 
layer or table, OR click the 
Table Options button in the 
Table window.  
  2. Choose Joins and Relates >

Preparing the data 
Using Excel data is not difficult, but it requires careful preparation. First, make sure that the 
spreadsheet meets the following requirements.  
¾The first row of the worksheet contains the field headings. 
¾Field headings must start with a letter, must have no more than  
13 characters, and must not contain spaces or shift characters such as %, $, #, 
and so on. 
¾No blank lines occur between the headings and the data or within the data rows. 
¾The spreadsheet contains no formulas. 
¾The bottom of the spreadsheet has no extraneous data, such as column totals. 
¾There are no merged or split cells, and every column contains consistent data 
types. 
¾Numeric columns have only numeric values in them, without text characters 
like “x” or “n/a” to indicate missing values. If present, missing values should 
have a numeric NoData marker value such as –99. 
¾Text fields contain no commas, unless all the text is enclosed in quotes. 
¾It is helpful if each column has been specifically formatted as text data or as 
numeric data with a specified number of decimal places. 
An Excel workbook may have multiple worksheets inside. You must open each one separately. If 
they have not been named, they will appear as Sheet1$, Sheet2$, and Sheet3$, with Sheet1$ 
containing the data. If they have been named, the names will appear. 
  1. Click the Add Data button and navigate to the folder containing the Excel document. 
  2. Double-click the desired spreadsheet document to look 
inside it. Select the named sheet you want, or select 
Sheet1$ if the worksheets have not been named  
(Fig. 57). Click Add. 
  3. Use the spreadsheet as if it were any other table (except 
it is read-only). 
  4. To convert it to dBase format or save it in a 
geodatabase, right-click the spreadsheet table and 
choose Export. See the Skill Reference entry in this 
chapter on Exporting. 
TIP: You must CLOSE the spreadsheet in Excel before you can open it in ArcMap.  
TIP: If you are unable to open a file in ArcMap, try saving it in an earlier Excel format. 
You can also save a spreadsheet in .csv or .dbf format and open it from ArcMap that way.

Displaying x-y data from a table 
Displaying x-y data from a table creates an event theme, which is a temporary display rather than 
a permanent file. To save the event layer permanently as a shapefile or feature class in a 
geodatabase, you need to export it. See Exporting features. 
  1. Make sure the table has fields for  
x and y coordinates and that you 
know the coordinate system and 
datum of the coordinates. 
  2. Right-click the table in the Table of 
Contents and choose Display XY 
Data. 
  3. Specify which fields contain the 
x-y coordinates (Fig. 58). Recall 
that longitude is the x coordinate 
and latitude is the y coordinate. 
  4. Click the Edit button to specify the 
coordinate system of the points in 
the table. See Specifying a spatial 
reference. 
  5. Click OK to create the points. 
TIP: Be sure to set the coordinate system 
to match the x-y values stored in the table, 
not the map currently in the data frame. For 
example, if the table contains latitudes and 
longitudes, the coordinate system must be 
set to a GCS even though the map you are 
viewing may be in UTM or State Plane.

Coordinate Systems 
Examining the coordinate system 
Every data layer has x-y coordinates that 
must be in some type of coordinate system. 
The coordinate system is stored as part of 
the information about a data set, the 
coordinate system label. It is critical that 
the label match the coordinates actually 
stored in the file. 
In ArcCatalog 
  1. Right-click the feature class in the 
Catalog Tree and choose 
Properties. 
  2. Click the XY Coordinate System 
tab (for feature classes) or the 
Projection tab (for coverages) 
(Fig. 59). 
  3. WARNING: Using the folders or 
buttons in this window to change 
the coordinate system will modify 
the label attached to the data set 
and should only be used on feature 
classes with an unlabeled or 
incorrectly labeled coordinate 
system. See Specifying a spatial 
reference. 
In ArcMap 
  1. Right-click the layer name and 
choose Properties. 
  2. Click the Source tab. 
  3. Read the coordinate system 
information (Fig. 60). 
The top panel shows the extent, or range 
of x-y coordinates stored in the file. The 
lower panel shows the source data set 
for the layer and the coordinate system 
label.

Specifying a spatial reference 
The spatial reference is the complete description of a data set’s coordinate system (CS). The same 
sets of windows are used in several places when a coordinate system needs to be specified. 
Coordinate system definitions are stored as text files with a .prj extension. 
  1. Examine the current spatial 
reference name and details.  
The Details panel shows the parameters 
defined for the selected CS (Fig. 61). 
  2. Browse through the folders to 
choose the desired CS.The files 
are organized into geographic and

Defining a custom coordinate system 
ArcGIS comes with many predefined coordinate system files, but sometimes it is necessary to 
define a custom projected coordinate system. (Defining a custom geographic coordinate system is 
rare and not recommended for beginners.) 
  1. Choose Add Coordinate System > 
New from the Spatial Reference 
window (Fig. 61) and select 
Projected Coordinate System. See 
Specifying a spatial reference. 
If you are starting with a standard coordinate 
system as a model, shift the custom window 
aside so that you can see the original 
coordinate system parameters in the previous 
window, and you’ll be able to refer to it when 
entering the parameters. 
  2. Type a name for the new coordinate 
system. Include both the datum and 
projection in the name (Fig. 63). 
  3. Select the type of projection to be 
used. 
  4. Set the parameters such as the central 
meridan or false easting. See  
Chapter 11 for a discussion of these 
parameters. 
  5. Choose the linear unit to be used to 
store the x-y coordinates. 
  6. Click Change to choose a different 
geographic coordinate system than 
the default. 
  7. Click OK. 
  8. The CS is added to the Custom folder 
in the Spatial Reference window. To 
save the definition as a .prj file, right-
click it and choose Save As.

Defining coordinate systems of data sets 
Defining a coordinate system for a data set allows you to display it with other data. It is important 
to set the coordinate system to match the actual x-y coordinates contained in the file. This tool 
should be used only if the data set coordinate system is undefined or incorrectly defined.  
Using the Define Projection tool 
  1. Open ArcToolbox, if necessary. 
  2. Choose the Define Projection tool from 
the section Data Management Tools > 
Projections and Transformations. 
  3. Click the drop-down button (ArcMap 
only) or the Browse button and select 
the data set to define (Fig. 65). 
  4. A warning symbol will appear if the 
layer already has a spatial reference. 
You should only change the spatial 
reference of a data set if the coordinate 
system label is currently Unknown or incorrect. 
  5. Click the icon to open the Spatial Reference Properties window. Select, import, or create 
a coordinate system definition. See Specifying a spatial reference. 
  6. Click OK. 
Using ArcCatalog 
  1. Right-click the data set in the Catalog Tree and choose Properties from the menu. 
  2. Click the XY Coordinate System tab. 
  3. Select, import, or create a coordinate system definition. See Specifying a spatial reference. 
TIP: If a layer is open in ArcMap, then use ArcToolbox or the Catalog tab to define the coordinate 
system. A file lock will prevent ArcCatalog from changing a data set that is open in ArcMap.

Projecting feature classes 
Projecting data changes both the coordinate system definition AND the x-y coordinates of the 
features, creating a new file in the process and leaving the original unchanged. 
  1. In ArcToolbox, choose the Project 
tool from the Data Management 
Tools > Projections and 
Transformations > Feature section 
(Fig. 66). 
  2. Click the drop-down (ArcMap only) 
or the Browse button to select the 
data set to be projected. 
  3. Click the second Browse button to 
specify a folder, a geodatabase, or a 
feature dataset to contain the output 
and give the output shapefile or 
feature class a name. Click Save to 
enter the new name. Click Next. 
  4. Click the button to open the Spatial 
Reference Properties window to 
select a coordinate system to which 
to project the data. See Specifying 
the spatial reference. 
  5. A green dot will appear by the 
Geographic Transformation box if 
one is required to convert from one 
datum to another. Select one or more 
transformations from the drop-down box. 
  6. Click OK to project the data. 
TIP: Projecting coverages requires an ArcGIS Advanced license. If you only have an ArcGIS 
Basic license, a red X button will appear by the Input Dataset box.

Projecting rasters 
  1. If converting from a GCS to a projected coordinate system in meters or feet, calculate the 
target output cell size in meters and convert to feet, if necessary. Round the result to an 
even number. You can also usually take the cell size suggested by the tool and round it. 
Cell size in degrees × 111.3 km/degree × 1000 = output cell size in meters 
  2. Open the ArcToolbox > Data 
Management Tools > Projections 
and Transformations > Rasters > 
Project Raster tool (Fig. 67). 
  3. Click the drop-down (ArcMap only) 
or use the Browse button to select 
the input raster to be projected. 
  4. Enter the name and location for the 
output raster. 
  5. Select the output coordinate system. 
See Specifying a spatial reference. 
  6. If a green button appears by the 
Geographic Transformation box, a 
datum transformation is required. 
Choose one from the drop-down list. 
  7. Set the resampling technique to 
NEAREST if the raster contains 
discrete or categorical data. Set it to 
BILINEAR if the raster contains 
continuous data. See the discussion 
in Chapter 11 for more information. 
  8. Set the output cell size as a value, 
or use the Browse button to match 
it to an existing data set. 
  9. Select a registration point if you 
wish for the cell grid to be snapped to a specific location. 
10. Click OK. 
Georeferencing rasters 
Georeferencing takes a raster with an undefined and unknown coordinate system and assigns a 
coordinate system to it by means of matching points with a reference data set. 
  1. Determine the likely projection of the map in the raster. It need not be exact, but the 
closer it is to the correct shape the more accurate the georeferencing will be. 
  2. Find a reference data set that has a known coordinate system, with features that can be 
identified and matched to locations on the raster. 
  3. Load the reference data set into ArcMap and set the data frame to the coordinate system 
chosen in Step 1. 
  4. Zoom and pan until the reference data set occupies approximately the same position and 
region in the ArcMap window as the raster map does in its image.

  5. Add the image to the map document. It will usually not be visible yet. 
6. Open the Georeferencing toolbar (Fig. 68a). Set the 
image to be georeferenced, if more than one image is part of 
the map document. 
7. Choose Georeferencing > Fit To Display from the 
Georeferencing toolbar. If the image requires, use Flip or 
Rotate to position the image with north up. 
8. Click the Control Points button. 
9. Enter pairs of control points that link a point on the 
raster to a point on the reference layer.  
Always enter the pairs in the same order (raster: reference or 
vice versa). The display will update as points are entered. 
Zoom and pan between pairs to get the points as accurate as 
possible. Place points near the four corners of the image at 
minimum, and more if needed. 
10. When no further improvement is seen as points are entered, open the Link Table to 
examine the control points and residual errors (Fig. 68b). 
11. A point with a high residual error relative to the others can be highlighted and deleted. 
12. Change the Transformation method if a higher-order transformation is needed. 
13. Save the control points as a text file, if desired, for future reference. 
14. Record the total RMS error for inclusion in the data set metadata. 
15. Click Update Georeferencing. The image transformation will be saved as a world file 
with the image. Use Rectify to save a new copy of the raster. See Rectifying rasters.

Rectifying rasters 
Rectifying saves a georeferenced raster as a new raster file with the georeferenced coordinate 
system. 
  1. Georeference the raster. See 
Georeferencing rasters. 
  2. Choose Georeferencing > 
Rectify from the 
Georeferencing toolbar. 
  3. Change the cell size, if 
desired (Fig. 69). 
The suggested size is given in the 
raster coordinate system units 
(degrees in this case) and is an exact 
transformation of the cell size of the 
original raster to the new coordinate 
system. You can use it as is, or 
round it slightly if you wish. 
  4. Set the resampling technique to NEAREST if the raster contains discrete or categorical 
data, or if it is an image. Set it to BILINEAR if the raster contains continuous data. See 
the discussion in Chapter 11 for more information. 
  5. Specify the folder or geodatabase in which to place the output raster. 
  6. Give the output raster a name. Leave the extension blank. 
  7. Set the output format if the raster is being saved in a folder. 
  8. Adjust the compression type and quality if desired. 
  9. Click Save. 
TIP: Rectifying often changes the colors shown in an image raster. To reset it, use ArcToolbox > 
Data Management Tools > Raster > Raster Properties > Add Colormap to copy the colormap 
from the original image to the new image.

Creating adjacent polygons 
It is very important that adjacent polygons have 
identical shared boundaries. You can create adjacent 
polygons with coincident boundaries in two different 
ways by using the AutoComplete Polygons tool or by 
creating a large polygon boundary and cutting it up 
into sections. 
Using the AutoComplete Polygons tool 
  1. Click the editing template for the layer in the 
Create Features window. 
  2. Choose the Polygon construction tool, or one 
of the other construction tools (Fig. 89). 
  3. Create the first polygon. 
  4. Choose the Auto Complete Polygon tool from 
the Construction tools list. 
  5. Sketch only the undefined boundary of the 
next polygon. Be sure to start and end inside 
the adjacent polygon or inside two adjacent 
polygons. 
  6. Finish the sketch to create the new polygon. 
Cutting polygon features 
  1. Click the editing template for the layer in the 
Create Features window. 
  2. Choose one of the polygon construction tools. 
  3. Create the polygon around the outer boundary (Fig. 90). 
  4. Click the Cut Polygons tool on the Editor toolbar. 
  5. Sketch a line that will form the boundary between the new 
polygons. Important: The line must start and end snapped 
to or outside of the existing polygons. 
  6. Finish the sketch. The new polygons will be created. 
TIP: A polygon must be selected before it can be cut with the Cut 
Polygons tool.

By default, a straight segment connects adjacent vertices entered by the 
user. The sketching tools provide additional options for entering a vertex 
or designating the shape of the connecting segment. Each sketching tool 
can be used at the beginning, middle, or end of a sketch. You can use 
multiple tools in succession during a single sketch. The sketching tools are 
selected from the Editor menu. The Straight Segment and Endpoint Arc 
Segment tools have their own icons on the Editor toolbar. The other tools

Creating new symbols 
Symbols are created from one or more layers of symbol objects, as shown in Figure 125. Users 
can create new layers, put predefined symbols in them, and modify their colors and other 
properties to create new symbols. Symbols can also be created from imported bitmap images. 
  1. Click the Edit Symbol button in the Symbol Selector to access the Symbol Property 
Editor (Fig. 126). 
  2. Add new layers using the + button in the Layer area of the window. Delete layers using 
the X. Change the order of layers with the arrow buttons. 
  3. Select the type of symbol character to put in the layer. Markers, arrows, and 3D symbols 
are some of the types available. 
  4. Select the font and the subset. Many different fonts are available, giving many choices for 
symbols and text. 
  5. Select the desired character. 
  6. Modify the size, color, thickness, and other properties of the character. 
  7. Switch to the Mask tab to create a mask or halo around the symbol. This tab is useful for 
creating halos around text to make it easier to read.

Labels and Annotation 
Using graphic text 
Graphic text is placed on a map document interactively and becomes a 
graphic on the map that is unique to the map document. Most graphic text 
uses strings typed by the user. 
  1. Make sure that you are in Layout view. 
  2. Look for one of the labeling tools on the Draw toolbar. Click on 
the black arrow for a drop-down menu to choose one of the tools. 
Adding text to the map 
  1. In Layout view, click the New Text tool. 
  2. Click the desired location on the map and enter the text. Press Enter when finished. 
  3. Newly entered text is always selected, as shown by the dashed blue box around it. At this 
point you can change its font, size, or color using the menus on the Draw toolbar, or you 
can use the cursor to click and drag it to a new location. 
TIP: To delete text, click the black arrow on the Draw toolbar, select the text, and press the 
Delete key. To delete all graphic elements, choose Edit > Select All Elements from the main 
menu bar and press the Delete key. Be careful! This option also deletes annotation. 
Labeling a feature with an attribute 
The Label tool, unlike the other graphic text tools, must be used in Data view. It uses the display 
expression in the layer properties for the text string. 
  1. Open the layer properties and click the Display tab. 
Set the Display Expression Field to the desired 
attribute to appear in the label. Click OK. 
  2. Make sure that you are in Data view. 
  3. Choose the Label tool from the labeling drop-down 
button. The Label Tool Options window will 
appear (Fig. 135).  
  4. Choose whether to Automatically find best 
placement or to Place label at position clicked.  
  5. Also choose whether to use the Label properties 
already set on the Labels tab or to choose a symbol 
from the window. 
  6. Click on the feature to be labeled. ArcMap will 
label the topmost layer clicked if more than one 
layer is present.

Splining text along a line 
Splining text makes it follow along a linear feature such as a road or stream. 
  1. Set the font size and style options desired using the Draw toolbar. 
  2. Choose the Splined Text tool from the labeling drop-down button.  
  3. Click vertices to define the line along which the text will appear. Double-click to end the 
line. 
  4. Type the text in the box and press Enter. 
  5. Use the Draw toolbar to modify the position or font characteristics as needed. 
Adding a callout label 
A callout places text in a box with a pointer to the feature of interest. 
  1. Choose the Callout tool from the labeling drop-down button. 
  2. Click on the feature to be labeled and drag the cursor to define the direction and length of 
the callout pointer. 
  3. Enter the text into the box and press Enter. 
  4. Click and drag on the text box to change its location, if desired. Click and drag on the 
blue dot to change the location of the pointer. Use the tools on the Draw toolbar to 
modify the callout’s font, style, size, and so on. 
Creating wrapped text boxes 
  1. Choose one of the wrapped text tools: the Polygon Text, the Rectangle 
Text, or the Circle Text. 
  2. For the circle or rectangle text tool, click and drag to draw the circle/box, releasing the 
mouse when it reaches the desired size and shape. For the polygon tool, click on each 
vertex to define the desired shape. 
Double-click when finished. 
  3. Double-click inside the empty 
shape to open the text Properties 
box (Fig. 136). Type the text to be 
displayed. Do not use the Enter 
key unless you wish to enforce a 
new line within the text. 
  4. Set the symbol, spacing, or other 
options, if necessary.  
  5. Use the other tabs to change the 
margins, columns, frame border, 
size, position, or area background 
of the text box as needed. 
  6. Click OK to place the text. 
  7. To modify the text later, double-
click it to open its properties box.

Using dynamic labels 
Dynamic labels are used to quickly label all the features in a layer. 
  1. Open the layer 
Properties and click 
the Labels tab. 
  2. Check the Label 
features in this 
layer box  
(Fig. 137). 
  3. Make sure the

features the same 
way. 
  4. Choose the Label 
Field. Click the 
Expression button 
to enter a VBA script. 
  5. Edit the font settings, or select a predefined text symbol by clicking the Symbol button 
and choosing a predefined symbol style. 
  6. For detailed control of label placement, click the Placement Properties button. 
  7. Set the scale range, if desired, by using the label’s scale range or by typing in new values. 
If the map scale is outside the specified range, the labels will not be drawn. 
  8. Select a label style, if desired. A label style includes BOTH a text symbol and predefined 
label placement options. 
  9. Click OK to place the labels. 
TIP: Turn labels on and off for a layer by right-clicking the layer name in the Table of Contents 
and choosing the Label Features option. If the menu choice is checked, the labels are on, and 
choosing it will turn them off. If it is unchecked, choosing it will turn them on. 
Creating label classes 
Label classes are used to assign different label styles to groups within a layer, such as giving 
towns small labels and large cities large labels. We will designate towns as having fewer than 
100,000 people. The instructions below use this example, but they can be customized for as many 
classes as you wish. 
  1. Open the layer Properties and click the Labels tab. 
  2. Check the box to Label features in this layer (Fig. 138). 
  3. Make sure the method is set to Define classes of features and label each class differently. 
  4. The current class is the Default class. Uncheck the box to Label features in this class. 
  5. Click Add to add a new class. Name it Towns. Click OK.

When the class name is showing in the Class box, then all the settings in the window will be 
applied to that class. We continue now by defining the Towns class and setting the label 
properties. 
  6. Click the SQL Query button. 
  7. Enter an expression that defines the Towns class. In this case we use:  
 
[POP2010] <100000. See Entering an SQL query. 
  8. Make sure that 
the box is 
checked to 
Label features 
in this class. 
  9. Select the font 
to be used for 
this class. 
10. Set the 
placement 
properties or 
scale range for 
this class, if 
desired. 
You are finished 
defining and setting 
properties for the Towns class. The next step is to add the Cities class. 
11. Repeat Steps 5–10 for the Cities class. This time the expression will read: 
 
[POP2010] >= 30000. 
12. Continue until all classes have been added. 
13. Click OK. 
TIP: If you see double labels on your features, you probably forgot to uncheck the box for the 
Default class. If you don’t see any labels, or see only some classes, check your SQL queries. 
Using the Label Manager 
The Label Manager makes it easier to work with labels from many layers at one time. You can 
choose layers to modify with a single click rather than having to open and close label properties 
for each one. 
  1. Choose Customize > Toolbars from the 
main menu bar and select the Labeling 
toolbar. 
  2. Click the Label Manager button on the Labeling toolbar. 
  3. Use the check boxes to turn labels for layers on and off (Fig. 139). Notice that both

Creating annotation 
These directions show how to create annotation stored as text graphics in a map. Consult the Help 
files for information on creating annotation as a geodatabase feature class. 
  1. Use the Layer Properties to create dynamic labels for all the desired layers. Take care in 
setting the properties, weights, and so on because these will control the labels that appear. 
  2. Annotation will be created for all layers in the data frame with dynamic labels turned on. 
Turn off any dynamic labels for layers not to be converted. 
  3. Right-click the data 
frame name and 
choose Convert 
Labels to 
Annotation. The 
dialog box will 
appear (Fig. 141). 
  4. Examine which 
layers will be

they are the desired 
ones. 
  5. Choose to create 
annotation in the 
map or in a 
geodatabase.  
  6. Choose whether to 
create annotation 
for all features, 
features in the 
current extent, or selected features. 
  7. If creating geodatabase annotation, check whether to create feature-linked annotation or 
not. This requires an ArcGIS Standard license. Note the name of the feature class being 
created. If map annotation is being created, the annotation will be placed in a group. 
  8. Check the destination for the geodatabase annotation and change it if necessary. 
  9. Check the box to Convert unplaced labels if you want to place overlapping labels 
interactively. 
10. Click Convert to create the annotation.

Placing overflow map annotation 
Map annotation from overlapping dynamic labels will not 
be placed on the map. Instead they will be placed in an 
overflow window and must be placed interactively. 
  1. Right-click a label in the overflow list and choose a 
method to locate it, if necessary (Fig. 142). 
  2. Right-click it again and choose Add Annotation to 
add the label to the map. Click and drag it to adjust 
its location, if necessary. 
  3. If you decide not to place the label, delete it from 
the list using Delete. 
  4. Use Show Annotation In Extent to list only the 
labels in the current view. Place all of these before 
zooming to another location—it saves time. 
Placing overflow geodatabase annotation 
Overflow annotation in a geodatabase is placed in the 
annotation feature class table along with the placed labels, 
but with an attribute field indicating that it is not placed. It 
can be placed at any time. 
  1. Make sure that the 
annotation feature 
class is in the Table 
of Contents and is 
turned on. 
  2. Start an edit

Layouts and Data Frames 
Using the Layout toolbar 
The Layout toolbar provides tools for zooming around the layout page (Fig. 145). It has no effect 
on the zoom in the data frame. The functions of the buttons, from left to right, are as follows: 
  1. The Layout Zoom 
In tool is used to 
enlarge a portion 
of the layout. 
Click the tool and 
then click and 
drag a box around 
the desired area. 
  2. The Layout Zoom Out tool zooms out a specified distance from the layout, centered on 
the clicked point. 
  3. The Layout Pan tool moves the layout within the window. Click and drag on the layout to 
move it. 
  4. The Zoom Whole Page tool zooms so that the entire layout page can be seen. 
  5. The Zoom to 100% tool shows the layout at the same scale as it will be printed. 
  6. The Fixed Zoom In tool zooms in a specified amount, centered on the current display, 
when you click anywhere on the layout. 
  7. The Fixed Zoom Out tool zooms out a specified amount, centered on the current display, 
when you click anywhere on the layout. 
  8. The Go Back to Extent tool returns to the previous extent. 
  9. The Go Forward to Extent goes to the next extent. This button is only available if you 
have clicked the Go Back to Extent tool at least once. 
10. The Zoom Control box sets a particular percent enlargement for the layout. 
11. The Toggle Draft Mode allows you to display each element as a simple labeled box. This 
feature can make setting up the layout easier without waiting for each element or data 
frame to redraw each time a change is made. 
12. The Focus Data Frame mode switches to Data View but lets you keep editing any text 
placed on the layout. It’s a hybrid between Data View and Layout View. 
13. The Change Layout button launches the Template window so you can add or change the 
layout of the map using a predefined template. 
14. The Data Driven Pages button opens the Data Driven Pages toolbar, which is used for 
working with map tiles used to produce map books. See Help for more information.

Setting up the map page 
  1. Choose File > Page and Print Setup from the main menu bar. 
  2. Check the printer and use Properties to change it, if necessary (Fig. 146). 
  3. Set the printer paper size, source, or orientation options, if necessary. 
  4. Set the map page 
width, height, and 
orientation. 
  5. To use the settings 
from the current 
printer for the map 
page size, check 
the box. Otherwise, 
set the page size. 
See the tip below. 
  6. If you plan to 
change the map 
size and want the 
map elements to 
be resized along 
with the page, 
check the box. 
  7. If desired, check 
the box to show 
the printer margins 
in the layout. 
  8. Examine the page 
preview to make 
sure that your map 
(the colored 
picture) will fit on 
the paper (the 
white area). Adjust 
the settings, if necessary. 
TIP: Using the Printer Paper Settings may cause a map document to issue a warning when it is 
opened on a system where the original printer is not available or to make unwanted changes to the 
layout when the printer is changed. The author does not recommend using this check box. 
Setting the scale or extent 
The Data Frame properties tab provides three options for setting the map scale of the frame: 
automatic, fixed scale, or fixed extent. Automatic scaling is the default. Fixed scale or fixed 
extent will deactivate the Zoom/Pan tools for the frame.

Using Automatic 
  2. If you set the extent to Automatic, no other settings are 
needed. The scale will be determined using the 
zoom/pan tools in the data frame. 
Using Fixed Scale 
  3. If you set the scale to Fixed Scale, specify the desired 
scale for the map. The zoom tools will be disabled, 
but the Pan tool will still work. 
  4. Check the map borders, as parts of the data frame

The boxes will be filled 
with the current x-y extent 
of the data frame. Change 
the x-y coordinates, if 
desired.  
  7. Click the Specify Extent 
button for more options. 
You can set the extent to match the current visible extent, set it to match a particular data 
layer, set it to match an existing graphic such as a rectangle, or specify the x-y extent 
values in longitude-latitude degrees instead of map units. 
  8. Click OK. 
Setting the reference scale 
  1. Use the Pan/Zoom, the Scale readout, or Bookmark tools to zoom to the desired scale. 
  2. Right-click the data frame name in the Table of Contents and choose Reference Scale >

Adding neatlines, backgrounds, and shadows 
Neatlines are lines that enclose one or more map elements. Many objects in layouts, including 
data frames, legends, and scale bars, have a tab in their properties to set up borders, backgrounds, 
and drop shadows. To access these tabs, open the element’s properties by either double-clicking it 
or right-clicking it, and choose Properties. To create a neatline or shaded box as a separate object, 
do the following: 
  1. Choose Insert > Neatline 
from the main menu bar. 
The Neatline window 
appears (Fig. 156). 
  2. Choose the desired 
Placement option. 
  3. Set the border, 
background, and drop 
shadow styles. 
  4. To further modify the 
available styles, click the 
Border Selector or Edit 
Border buttons as shown. 
  5. Set the gap between the 
neatline and the elements 
and enter rounding, if 
desired. The higher the 
percentage, the more 
rounding occurs.

  5. The Numbers and Marks tab controls the spacing of 
numbers and marks on the bar (Fig. 158). These 
values can usually be left as defaults. 
  6. The Format tab controls the font of the scale text 
and the style of the scale bar. The defaults are 
usually fine. 
  7. The Scale and Units tab controls the length and 
divisions of the scale bar.  
  8. Set the units for the scale bar to miles, kilometers, 
or some other unit. The default of meters is usually 
not desirable. 
  9. Choose the When resizing. . . option. One or more 
of the input boxes in the window may be dimmed, 
depending on which option is chosen. 
10. Set the division value, the number of divisions, and 
the number of subdivisions, as applicable. 
11. Check the box to place the subdivisions before the 
zero point rather than in the first division. 
12. The chosen units will be labeled on the scale bar 
(e.g., Miles). Choose the label position, change the 
label text and font symbol, and set the gap between 
the scale bar and the label, if desired. 
TIP: To change the properties of a scale bar after it has been created, double-click the scale bar 
using the Select Elements tool, or right-click it and choose Properties. 
Adding pictures 
  1. Choose Insert > Picture from the main menu bar. 
  2. Navigate to the folder containing the picture and click on it to select it. 
  3. Click Open to add the picture. 
  4. Resize and/or move the picture to the desired location using the Select Elements tool. 
TIP: Information on allowed image formats can be found in the online help index by typing the 
entry “rasters” and choosing the subheading “formats, supported.” 
TIP: A bug in the initial release makes it difficult to resize the picture when it appears 
substantially larger than the layout page. A workaround is to set the layout zoom percentage to a 
small value so that the entire picture can be seen and resized. 
Creating a map from a template 
A map template is a set of data frames, titles, styles, and other map elements that are already 
formatted and ready to receive the data in the data frame(s). Use a map template to quickly create 
a map in a standard format. You can save any map as a template to create a similar map again.

Entering an SQL query 
An SQL query is an expression to select features based on an attribute in the table. A similar 
window appears whenever an SQL expression is needed. The query is entered in the expression 
box in the lower part of the window.  
  1. Choose the selection method  
(Fig. 167). For a discussion of the 
different methods, see Chapter 8. 
  2. Enter a field name from the list into

clicking on the field name.  
  3. Enter an operator by clicking it 
once.  
  4. For categorical data, click Get 
Unique Values and double-click the 
desired value from the list. 
  5. Alternatively, enter a value by 
typing it into the box. If it is a text 
string, put single quotes around it. 
  6. Multiple queries use criteria from 
more than one field. The field name 
must be repeated for each query. 
  7. Click Verify to ensure that the 
query is correctly formulated, if 
desired. 
  8. Use the Save button to save a complex query or one that is frequently used. It will be 
saved with an .exp extension. Load it again later using the Load button. 
  9. Click Apply or OK to execute the query.  
TIP: Many users find that typing in or editing the expression by hand tends to generate errors. 
Use the boxes and the buttons provided to enter expressions for quickest results. 
TIP: Field names may be enclosed in brackets, quotes, or nothing, depending on the database and 
the version of ArcGIS being used. 
TIP: When you are using multiple conditions, the field name must appear in every condition. To 
find rents between 500 and 1000 dollars, for example, enter [RENT] > 500 AND [RENT] < 1000. 
You cannot enter [RENT] > 500 AND < 1000.

Using Select By Location 
Select By Location compares the features to be selected (from the target layer) with features from 
another layer (the source layer) using a spatial condition operator such as intersects or contains. 
  1. Choose Selection > Select By Location from the main menu bar. 
  2. Choose the selection method 
(Fig. 169). 
  3. Choose the target layer(s) from 
which to select features. Be 
careful—layers from previous 
queries remain checked until 
you uncheck them. 
  4. Choose the source layer against 
which the target features will 
be tested. 
  5. To use only the selected 
features of the source layer, 
check the Use selected features 
box. 
  6. Choose the spatial condition 
for the test. 
  7. If using the condition within 
distance of, or increasing the 
distance over which the other 
criteria are applied, enter a 
buffer amount and distance 
units, and check the Apply a 
buffer box, if necessary.  
  8. Click Apply to make the selection. 
TIP: To use the same layer as the selection layer and the condition layer (e.g., to select all 
restaurants within two miles of the restaurant you own), you must first use an attribute or an 
interactive query to select the feature of interest—your restaurant. Then do the Select By 
Location and specify the same layer for Steps 3 and 4.

Changing the selection options 
The selection options control several aspects of selections and queries. 
  1. Choose Selection >Selection Options from the main menu bar. 
  2. The first box (Fig. 170) 
controls how shapes select 
features when one is using one 
of the interactive selection 
tools. By default, any feature 
partially or completely in the 
shape is selected. You may 
also choose to select features 
completely within the shape or 
to select features that the shape 
is completely within. 
  3. The second box sets how close 
you need to click to a feature 
before it is selected. If you 
often have trouble selecting 
points, increase this distance. 
  4. This box changes the selection 
highlight color. 
  5. In the fifth box, you may alter 
the threshold that determines 
how many records will be 
modified by a Switch Selection 
command. If the number 
exceeds the threshold, a 
warning prompt will be issued. 
This option prevents you from 
mistakenly doing a switch that will take a very long time to complete. 
  6. Finally, you can choose whether to save layers with the current selections (the default) or 
to clear the selections of all layers when saving the map document.

Overlay and Spatial Joins 
Performing a spatial join 
In a spatial join, the attributes of features in the source layer are appended to the features in the 
destination table. The output layer always contains the same features as the destination table. 
When choosing the join options in Step 4, keep in mind the cardinality of the join to pick the most 
appropriate one. 
  1. Right-click the destination 
layer in the Table of 
Contents and choose Joins 
and Relates > Join. 
  2. Choose to join to another 
layer based on spatial 
location (Fig. 171). 
  3. Choose the source layer 
from the drop-down box, or 
click the Browse button to 
choose one from the disk. 
  4. Choose one of the two join 
options and specify any 
summary statistics desired, 
if applicable.

  3. Enter a second Input Features layer. 
  4. Enter the name and location of the 
Output Feature Class. 
  5. Set the JoinAttributes option to 
NO-FID, the best choice in most 
cases. ALL joins all attributes 
from both tables, NO-FID joins 
all attributes except the FIDs, and 
FID-ONLY joins only the FIDs.  
  6. Set a carefully chosen XY 
tolerance for help in preventing 
slivers. 
  7. Change the default output type, if desired.  
  8. Click OK. 
TIP: Two input layers must be entered if the user has an ArcGIS Basic license. With an ArcGIS 
Advanced license, three or more layers may be entered and the intersections will be performed 
sequentially. 
Performing a union 
A union combines the features and attributes of two polygon layers, preserving all areas from 
both. The Union window is nearly identical to the Intersect window shown in Figure 172. 
  1. Choose ArcToolbox> Analysis Tools > Overlay > Union. 
  2. Enter the Input Features by clicking a choice from the drop-down list or by clicking the 
Browse button to select a file from the disk. Both inputs must contain polygons. 
  3. Enter a second Input Features layer.

Merging or appending layers 
Merge combines two or more feature classes to create a new feature class. Append combines two 
or more feature classes and places them into an existing feature class. The data type of the  
inputs must match (all points, for 
example). 
  1. Choose ArcToolbox > Data 
Management Tools > General > 
Merge (Fig. 175). 
  2. Specify the layers to be merged 
together. 
  3. Specify the output feature class to 
contain the merged features. 
  4. Modify the Field Map, if desired. 
The Field Map lists all unique 
attribute fields from the input 
layers. When the attributes 
match, the field information will 
be combined into the single new 
field. If the layers have different 
fields, each field will be included 
in the output with null values 
from the feature classes not 
containing that field. You can 
rename, delete, and reorder the 
fields in the field map. 
  5. Click OK. 
TIP: The Append tool is nearly identical to the Merge tool window, except that there is no field 
map panel because the fields are defined by the existing output feature class.

  6. Ignore the warning, and click in 
the Statistic Type box to specify 
the type of statistic to use. 
  7. Select as many field-statistic 
combinations as desired. 
  8. Scroll down and uncheck the 
Create multipart features box if 
you wish to ensure that disjoint 
polygons remain separate 
features in the output. 
  9. Check the box for Unsplit lines if you want lines to be dissolved only when they share an 
end vertex. Otherwise, disjoint lines are dissolved into a single feature.

Using surface functions 
The surface functions contour, slope, aspect, and hillshade all 
produce output grids based on an input surface and a few 
arguments. The general procedure is as follows: 
  1. Choose ArcToolbox > Spatial Analyst  > Surface > 
function, where function is the name of the desired 
operation.  
  2. Choose the surface to use as input. 
  3. Specify the parameters for each function as described in 
the following paragraphs. 
  4. Specify the name and the location of the output raster. (If 
you are contouring, the output will be a feature class.) 
To Contour, specify the base contour value and the contour interval. For example, a base of 10 
and an interval of 20 will give the contours 10, 30, 50, and so on. You can also specify a Z factor 
to multiply with the surface before contouring, for example, to create foot contours on a meter 
surface. 
For Slope, enter a Z factor, if desired, and specify degrees or percent for the output units. 
For Aspect, there are no additional parameters. The resulting grid contains values between 0 and 
360 degrees representing the aspect, with 0 = 360 = North. A value of –1 indicates a flat area with 
no aspect. 
For Hillshade, change the default values for the azimuth and altitude of the illumination source, 
if desired. The azimuth is given in degrees between 0 and 360 with 0 = 360 = North. The altitude 
is given in degrees between 0 (horizontal) and 90 (vertical). A Z factor > 1 may be specified, 
which will exaggerate the topographic relief. A Z factor < 1 will subdue the topographic relief. 
You may also check the box to model shadows. If you choose this option, cells in the shadow of 
another will be set to 0 so that later you can extract these to create a map of shadows. The default 
option calculates the illumination of all cells, including shadowed ones. The visual difference 
between the two options is negligible. 
For Cut Fill, specify the before and after surfaces. Adjust the Z factor if necessary. The output 
grid will have negative values for areas that have been removed and positive values where 
material has been added. 
For Viewshed, specify the point or line feature class containing the observer locations. Specify a 
Z factor if desired.

give a linear weighting in which 
the influence of each point 
decreases linearly with distance. 
Entering 2 causes the influence to 
decrease as a square of the 
distance, and so on. 
  7. Enter the type of search radius.  
A variable radius searches for a specified 
number of closest points, with an optional 
requirement to stop searching outside a 
specified maximum distance. A fixed 
search radius uses all points within a 
specified distance, and it has an optional requirement to limit the points used to a specified 
maximum number. 
  8. Enter the values for the search distance and the number of points. 
  9. Optionally specify a line feature class containing barriers across which interpolation will 
not occur.
